Come and to our heart us Direction father we can live together we love you and we bless you Lord the name of the Lord amen let us go to provers Proverbs 5 and then verse 15 up to verse so the Bible says drink Waters of out of thine own tting and running Waters out of thy own well let fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of water in the streets let them be only thine and not The Strangers with thee Fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy [Music] youth let her be as the loving he and pleasant Ro let her breath satisfies all the time and be ravished always with her [Music] and Why th my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger God his word you may be seated praise the name of our Lord again I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ all our visitors you're welcome from the different parts of the country be together with us praise the name of the Lord I just want take a period of time May within one hour then we shall be concluded praise the name of the Lord I want to talk about the wife of your youth the wife of your youth praise the name of the Lord like we see Isaac and Rose they are still in their youth praise the name of our Lord and then we know that in our country as long as you above 18 years you can marry a girl can get a husband as long as they 18 and boy can get a wife as long as he 18 but you know our situation in our country or sometimes in the family that you coming from you may find that it's not wise to marry at that age sometimes at 18 you are still staying with your parents especially like a man and maybe around 18 you are still in school like maybe you're in senior five or senior four or senior six or maybe you have even just done a course and I remember some time ago last year then the Ministry of Health was coming up with a policy that they don't want to admit nurses who are still in teenage age because like when the mother is giving birth says who is this girl is going to help me to give bir so now you see that the time of marriage also matters a lot but in now deved countries like sometimes either in Europe or in the US at 16 years somebody can marry and then in some countries I think it was either portug some country in Europe one of the leaders was proposing to be 13 years now the Bible is telling us about the wife of your youth it matters lot before God praise the name of Lord that you marry when you are still a youth when you are still a youth but then of course you don't say that you don't go to your parents I'm 18 years I want to get a wife I want to get a husband because there are things that go with marriage you must have your own accommodation you know just like a man are you still staying with your parents now if you staying with your parents and then you are trying to befriend a young woman for marriage then they will take you not serious or perhaps you don't have any income you depend on the pocket of your parents and then you also want to marry hey how are you going to sustain this person you know so there are issues that come into play that make you ready for marriage praise the name of our Lord like sometime I was asking Isaac where stay then he told me of course he knew the time and the season of what he wanted praise the name of the Lord okay you have a job how much are you earning because when you marry they responsibilities that come along with it there are responsibilities which you can't run away when you Mar but you know we are living in times that are bad that husbands other than producing children they just their duties doesn't care whether the child is dressed doesn't care the child is treated doesn't care whether the food is at home they have excuses and then some you know there are some irresponsible people you get and then they can tell you I have six children are you sure said yes where is one one is in another another you ask them how are they that the woman went withed very irresponsible so they just leave it to the women who give bir or maybe to the parents of the and then you also get irresponsible girls they just a man and they want to go with a man just only one day you know so but marriage comes with responsibility and now here the Bible is telling us rejoice with the wife of thy youth praise the name of our Lord now my brother Isaac just as you told Rose only you until Jesus speaks let that be in your life even in the midst of challenges that may come along the way because every marriage there are challenges there are every marriage as long as we are still living in this life and we are still living here on this Earth TR come every marriage go through those challenges go through those trials but then the issue is how are you going to handle the challenges that come and that's what now praise the name of the Lord Adam had got a wife from God praise the name of the Lord he got a wife from God but now before Adam could know his wife the serpent knew the wife it was a challenge how didam handle that challenge he didn't go for the divorce but he was able to bear with her in her condition in order to redeem her praise the name of the Lord not only Adam we see even Abraham Abraham married his half [Applause] sister she was a daughter of the father but not the daughter of his mother half sister but they had a challenge in their home there was barness of course there were many daughters in the land praise the name of you know there are those who are real [Applause] FTI children Abraham didn't do first search of who is f not didn't do that but spent many years with Sarah faithful with her and until Abraham told go this is the one is going to be my hair in other words Abraham was ready to live with his wife or was living with his wife much as she was Buren and was not looking for receip from he didn't do that even Zar in Luke one let us go to Luke 1 praise the name of our Lord Luke chapter 1 and then in verse 5 the Bible says there was in the days of Herod the king of there a certain priest named Zacharias of the course of ABIA and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron her name was El and they were both righteous before God walking in all commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless now the Bible says they were both righteous before God and now we like Isaac and Rose you've known one another because of the message of the hour you need to continue in the message of the leing blameless praise the name of the Lord that's what the Bible is telling us here Zaria and Elizabeth they were righteous before who before God nobody had hypocrisy praise the name of our Lord nobody was hiding anything from another but then you get in some scenarios when a man finds the wife is not giving [Applause] birth secretly gets another woman and some of them you find giving excuses you know we have a trip we have been called to go to Guru he gives an exes of his place of work to go hide with another woman but the Bible says Zaria and Elizabeth were righteous before God praise the name of our Lord they were righteous before God and that should be even in our marriages be righteous before God as a husband be righteous before God as a wife be righteous before God praise the name of and then you get some men when they get money they wanton lock themselves if they hear the wife is knocking they hide it very fast what are you hiding but the Bible says Zacharia and Elizabeth Elizabeth they were righteous before God in other words God had a true witness had a true testimony about their life as being righteous before God and even us as individuals we need to be righteous before God praise the name of the Lord not just pretending something you know there are some homes you go to when the husband and the wife don't [Applause] talk but when you go there they pretend and then the other other honey you bring but yet is not but bitterness they only become sweet when you are there when you go away so we need to see that we are righteous before God your personal life Let It Be upright before God and then you know there are some people who get challenges in their home and say if they do this I also do that but that's not right you as an individual you are accountable to God to do what is right regardless of what your wife is doing regardless of what your husband is doing you are required to do what is acceptable before God praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says they were righteous before walking in all the Commandments and the ordinances the Lord blameless praise the name of the Lord how we need our lives be like that whether you are married you are not married God requires us to be righteous God requires us to be blameless God requires us to be obedient to his praise the name of our Lord and if your marriage things are not the [Applause] best why do you fall with the the bad things you know there are some people who have excuses of not coming to church because of their wife or because of their husb you need to make your personal decision that if my wife disappoints me if my husband disappoints me I'm going to stay faithful to the Lord I'm not going to look around an alternative praise the name of our Lord I'm not going to get an EXC and because of the wife or because of the husband we need to walk blameless before the Lord praise the name of our Lord then the Bible says in verse S and they had no child because Elizabeth was B and they were both well stricken in years but Zar he didn't think of another [Applause] woman he knew this is what the Lord has given me and he was faithful to that praise the name of the Lord they had a problem at home the wife was not giving birth but what did Zakaria do the Bible say Zaria honestly prayed to the Lord verse3 but the angel said unto him fear not Zar fory prayer his and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the a son shall call his name praise the name of our Lord they had the problem of barness but the solution is go to the CR of Heaven and Earth and so whatever challenge we have in our the solution is with God praise the name of our Lord you know zabeth praise the name of our Lord you know in I think over 10 years ago there was a witch a witch was called I'm forgetting the name and then find the voice to be a woman that was a man when he became sick he went the hospital when they checked him was a man they said no you made you belong to the [Applause] took off then again he went to another things were and then the whole town had that man and then the men were sending their wies to that woman some of them wanted to kill elizabethe didn't go to which doctor but she was faithful and she waited on the Lord praise the name of also another example Abraham also the wife was bured he was also stricken in age and then Sarah tells Abraham go with this mate but it was not in the mind of Abraham to marry guy but Sarah brought the solution and at the end of the day whatever Abraham did after sah told him was blamed this made here this born son here Abraham took the responsibility they were not able to wait on the timing of the Lord but the Lord had a season where they would give birth to Isaac so whatever challenge that comes in marriage put it before the Lord praise the name of our Lord let us go to Genesis chapter 26 praise the name of our Lord Brother Genesis chapter 19 chter 25: 19 and these are the generations of Isaac abam son AB Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to his wife the daughter of Beth the Syrian of par the sister to laan the [Music] Syrian the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived now Isaac and Rebecca re was she was bar but Isaac didn't seek for alternative but the Bible says he entreated the Lord and said Lord make my wife give birth for 20 years Rebecca was bur Isaac didn't seek an alternative and now you imagine these people they were very rich nowadays people produce many [Laughter] children of course not all of them because they have a lot of money I can afford a wife in in another in because he loed that was not in the mind of Isaac that was not in the mind of Abraham praise the name of and then again there are others who don't have anything but they are producing everywhere they just have one small room maybe a gr at night that's you know where the trouble comes from legs are under the bed the head is where legs are just continuously but they can't raise those children when the time for lunch comes the children are running to the neighbor's place because at told there is no food why do you produce what you can't ra others can't dress their children you get the children with TS and then the back is they can't raise their children but he producing and then the wife says I have produce oil from my stomach until some produce almost danger to kill them they don't care you get this kid is on breastfeeding also want breast and then the other one they have to cut on the and then she's pregant you see God say that you can't produce and multiply you produce what you can take care of not every year every year every year every year and you are just on a small piece of land you can't educate your children you can't take your children to to school you can't take your children to the hospital you can't dress your children then you get those are the children stealing people's things we need to be responsible praise the name of the Lord you know he didn't say that you alone produ and Fe and even the production even to give he didn't say every year no produce what you can raise praise the name of our Lord so Isaac entreated the Lord and the Lord had Isaac in every challenge in marriage you put it before the Lord praise the name of our Lord you learn to put it before the Lord and don't start picking things against one another praise the name of our Lord let us go to Mal chapter 2 and then verse 14 to verse 16 the Bible says yet you say wherefore because the Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thast de treacherously yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant so the Bible says she's a wife of thy Covenant a wife of your in words you agre like we've been here Isaac and Rose exchanging their marriage convenant know somebody was asking where do you get wedding in the Bible the Bible says there's a marriage convenant here praise the name of Lord even Jesus attending attended the wedding praise the name of our Lord so now the Bible says she's the wife of youren so you don't add another praise the name of the Lord and the Bible says the two shall become one flesh one flesh like Isaac and Rose they now one flesh praise the name of the Lord so you can't talk about Isaac and you don't Hur R you can't talk about Rose and then you are not hurting Isaac because they one and if you don't respect Rose then you're not resp in Isaac if you don't respect Isaac not respecting R because they are one now the Bible say she's the wife of your Covenant but now before she become she became the wife of youren she was your companion praise the name of that's why it is good to marry your friend it is good to marry your friend not saying that is it Love at sight or something you don't know who they are you don't know where they come from you don't know their walk you don't know how they Liv you say take you to a place say you're going to meet somebody and then they bring somebody this was a blind date says your companion there's an understanding which has to happen there must be a time you know of kind of you know friendship who is this person who is the other person praise the name of and I believe Isaac had good time when Rose was working in G rose comes to church but Isaac you know Isaac sits this and Ros was sitting the other side and he took courage that sister but Isaac had a soft Landing because Rose was a friend is a friend to Grace and Isaac is a friend to then you see the connection came [Laughter] there so Isaac would just go where and Grace but know he goes to yeah they were trying to make friendship can I talk to her and Grace was maybe a good consultant you know those days there were post Runners there were no phones you must have somebody from either that family brother they give you some information you know she goes to the well at 5:00 so this one comes pretending to come and pick water but to talk to somebody you know even went at the time where the right the time when the right got to pick water and they had to be an exchange of words there had to be some kind of finding out the character of Rebecca you know Rebecca was a young girl but she had a character young girl this man is telling just give me to drink but she had the feeling for everything which was there said no after you drinking let me run and give these animals but those camels they drink tens and tens of liters and then you find that in some homes the wife or the husband will tell the wife or the other I don't want to see your people at my home no character but see Rebecca willing to to be that she's able to take the concern of right character praise the name of and then was like how the Lord has blessed me then I said please you have room at your home is there where we can put our animals don't mind there is and Rebecca how to tell her people but then nowadays you find a woman goes to a man's home without people KN I'm I'm married this way who gave you up like here we see Rose could not come by her own but she had to be given by her parents and that's the principle of the scriptures Even Adam had to receive from the Lord for you where did you receive from did you find in a disco know how to dance dancing stres going to be dancing all the time this one was actually in the beauty Pig are they going to keep them themselves as pige there's a man in Tunisia he went and married a woman and he spent about I think $30,000 or something like that they they went with the woman at home and he didn't know or he didn't see well the the appearance of the woman was artificial fake now when she reached home and she removed all the makeup man was in shock said this is not the woman I married took her to cour foring him I don't the ended but he took her to this is the woman I married this is the woman I'm living you know those who like to put on what they are not can be try to be humble to be but they are fake but you've made the decision bear it so you have to be careful what decision you make for are you taking a fake thing taking genuine thing and then there was also another man he wanted to get wife but he knew the target so he pretended he he came with a car driving all the time he comes driving around where the woman was tells her you know until she accepted and the man takes her she conceives but when she was in the man's house she realized the man doesn't have anything but so there has to be a time praise the name of our Lord to know what kind of person you're going now in the world they have funny things bad things they say you first leave with her and you give her some probation period find out that's not Christian praise the name of the and then say after one year or two years then you can do wedding or you can do your go for introduction that is not Christian so the Bible is telling us that she has to be your companion and then you make youren with herse and did not make one yet he had the res of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a Godly therefore take it to your spirit and let none treacherously against the wife of so the Bible is emphasizing don't deal treacherously to the wife of your youth that's the scripture say don't deal treacherous take heed to your spirit take he to your spirit and noways what the devil has done with the advance of Technology you'll find that people are married husband and wife but one his her [Applause] spirit is not with the husband or the wife their spirit is not together one the spirit is in sports not with the wife another the spirit is on Facebook they can be friend Facebook much more there was a sister she said the husband loves the car more than the spirit was with the car not with the wife and then others the spirit with their work so marriage is a a hard thing at home the man finds joy at his place of work when you go the place of work everybody says this man is good is you go to the house trouble the spirit is not with the wife at work but during the time of [Music] lock you can't go because they are locked you can't go to the gym can't go to the I wonder they wereing from morning to evening you're just there but the Bible says take he to your spirit because all the trouble comes from your spirit what is your mind about your wife what is your mind about your hus have you despised her like David he married s's daughter and when he married s's daughter a prince when she saw David dancing for the Ark of the Lord the Bible say she despised David her spirit was not together with and this is where the Tres come in a home when your spirit is not one the one spirit is on on you get trouble at home find something as a husband and wife as a husband and wife find something that can put you together that can make you rejoice together and the most important thing that can put you together is the word of God praise the name of our Lord when you bring the word of God in the midst of your differen you'll see those contr Spirits run away and then you'll have time for one another you learn to bear with one another you learn to pray for one another you learn you know to forgive one another you learn you know to see that you have compassion for one another compion praise the name of Lord this is mine this is my friend praise the name of our Lord let the word of God put together husband and wife praise the name of our Lord so if the word of God is in our midst then you're not going to deal treacherously treacherously this one is doing this you are thinking something wrong about and even your reaction will show that you are thinking something wrong they asking you for this but you're answering something what where are these things coming from so you need to see that your spirit is one let your spirit move as [Applause] one the of that your companionship continues and then you'll be able to keep youren as a husband and a wife but when your spirits are not together those evil spirits always make you think about somebody else about somebody El somebody else praise the name of our Lord but then the Bible says take he praise the name of the Lord take he to your spirit now in verse 16 for the Lord the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away for one cover violence With His Garment sayi the Lord of hosts therefore take he to your spirit that youal [Applause] [Music] not praise the name of our God says he hates divorce he hats putting away that's a scripture he made one for one praise the name of the Lord one for one not one for two one for one and to one praise the name of that's the mathematics of God 1 oneals one but then some try to make it two when they at home when this one is in the sitting room doesn't want to go there pretend to be busy in the kitchen there because one is in the when when he is almost pretends to be going to the toil dodging and then you get others they live in the same house but they don't sleep in the same bedroom is they are breaking the equation of God they breaking it and then the other will try to befriend the children against the other one other tries to buy children from the other one but the Bible says God hats putting away and then he says why do you cover violence with your gar in other words there is a form of violence there is kind of anger there is bit B in your spirit against your wife against your husband and God says I don't want that praise the name of the Lord says don't cover violence with your government don't pretend be righteous before the Lord praise the name of the Lord let us go to Ephesians 4:31 the Bible says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice now you see as a husband or wife the Bible say bitterness against your wife against your husband put it aside against your wife against your husband put it away against your wife against your husband put it away praise the name of our Lord Ephesians 4 31 [Music] loud speaker to speak to you says Let It Be praise the name of says Let It Be way why don't you talk to that person in sweetness praise the name of they have ears to hear praise the name of Let It Be put away Marice put away evil speaking you like talking bad about your wife you like talking bad about your put it away praise the name of our Lord like we witnessing this fun they have come with love and compassion and tenderness and that love for one another in Mal 2 ver read that part again he says yet you say wherefor and then see the Bible saying 2:4 says wherefore because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth that's what God is saying the first time you convinced her and then smiling God says I was a witness then you prepared I don't know inlaws are going to handle us trembling who is going to be our spokesperson going to us you TR and put on the cult which is not yours God says I was a witness and then that day are you coming not me you know like there are some deceive women and then they they they just don't go for the function God says I was a witness now these are maybe 20 years afterwards and God is asking what has happened from the time you married that right now you despise your wife right now you despise your husband why treacherous I was a witness when you were married I was a witness when you went to her parents I was a witness when were giving up to marriage I was a witness says why now that you're dealing treacherously with her so then he says have your spirit as one with your husband and your wife take all bitterness away take all anger away take all clamor away take all wrath away take all evil speaking away anything praise the name of Lord that would separate you put it away praise the name of our Lord let us go to Ephesians 4:32 praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says and be kind one to another praise the name of our if you want to enjoy your marriage be kind one to another and why do you need to be kind to a person because there's something which may be not measuring up but you are kind you are my wife you are my husband I love you regardless kindness praise the name of our you're not kind because there's no problem but you are kind because there's a problem there is a challenge somewhere says big kind one to another tended tendered you know that kind of soft heart towards one another that's what we should have in our families you know one of the problem of divorce in Matthew chapter 19 praise the name of our Lord Matthew chapter 19 and then verse they were asking Jesus why did Moses tell them to divorce and write a letter of divorce me I'm tired of you you can try elsewhere the Bible says because of the hardness of heart Hardness of Heart you get a man against his [Applause] wife doesn't care anything you get a wife against her husband doesn't care anything so what comes separation hard heart doesn't forgive very wful and others can [Laughter] fight you know in some marriages like when you go to the wedding or the introduction they bring the ball the ball and they bring the drum and then they bring the stick then they bring to the groom that if you are very angry the ball is here you keep the drum is here beat but don't beat her are noted they noted had heart for them the blood of Jesus Christ has not reached their souls but now we have the blood of Jesus Christ that's why there are no letters of divorce if the blood of Jesus Christ has reached your soul regardless of the problem you'll forgive praise the name of regardless of the challenge you forgive but when the blood has never reached [Applause] here heart regardless of what happen it takes the blood of Jesus Christ to convert his soul praise the name of Lord that's why my young brothers and sisters are not married first make sure that the the woman you want to take the man you want to take they are filled with the spirit find out BL has been applied in their soul other you're going to marry a beast or if it's a woman will do everything to hurt you you know what you don't want and does that what you don't want the blood does not the soul but right now the blood of Jesus Christ wases us from all sins and turns our heart until you live forgive even somebody who wants to kill you like St he forgave them when they was turning him to death Christ on the cross father don't put it upon them why we have the blood of Jesus Christ the solution to the hardness of heart praise the name of now my brother Isaac and Rose let the blood of Jesus chist be in your life and in your marriage it will not be difficult for you to tell the other I'm sorry once the blood is there it will not be difficult for the other say I forgive you praise the name of and don't wait I'm sorry forgive them praise the name of our Lord the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so in the message do you now believe brother Bram says now let me tell you something each man that is born again with the spirit of God in him is a cre now that shake you a little but that is the truth we are in the image of God God is a Creator that's the reason you can believe that God could heal a person because God is in you and God made this world he just spoke it and his word become material the very ground that you are setting on is the word of God made manifest if he didn't where where could he get it see he just spoke it and it turned into existence he believed his own and if a man is born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and the part of God is in him and he believes everyone that God says will materialize see and so that that makes him part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of praise the name of God so when you are born again when the spirit of God dwells in you praise the name of it makes you a part of God you can forgive the way God forgives you can bear the way God bear you can have long suffering the God has long you can be gentle the way God is gentle you can be you know make the way the Lord is made and then he say and now did you ever see people nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be you don't have nothing against them but you can't stand to be around then you seen some people that all a little [Applause] old down but you just love to be around that person you just love somehow it is the atmosphere that they've got around them the way they live they create an atmosphere that you like to be into that's lovely people to be with that's how your family should be that's how your home should be lovely home you created an atmosphere where the holy spirit lules in your home praise the name of and that's what should be at our home forgiveness where there is repentance you know in a home where saying I'm sorry is not a hard thing praise the name of us because you have a feeling you want to be reconciled a home where are forgiving is not a problem praise the name of Lord a home where are feeling for one another is always the concern you know you are concerned just like this body the body has many parts praise the name of but if the leg knocks a stone and then there is one toe that is hard the whole body is moved to go to that toe the mouth will try to blow some air to make it cool then the fingers try to fill it the whole body reacts of that should be in our home praise the name of Lord if your husband is hot you are also hot see how best you can help praise the name of the Lord if your wife is hard also hard so then praise the name of the Bible says let us go and read the scripture Ephesians 5 as I try to finish Ephesians 529 he says for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it even as the Lord Church why is he saying that because in verse 28 so old men to love their wiv their own he that love his wife himself praise the name of the wife of your youth she is part of you praise the name of our and then you get some men who married Queens after maybe 10 or years the man's AG is aging even the wife is but it say the wife is not fit for that place want to get a young one old praise the name of the Lord part of your body become Young the Bible says he that love his wife love himself so we need to see that we create an atmosphere of and love covers a m of sin praise the name of Lord I don't know what Rose likes eating praise the name of Lord and maybe Isaac fails to get them the whole month but you know ISAC maybe where they them that you know where to pick the best what she likes you know how to pick it you know how to get it you cherish her you make her happy not saying but you you are demanding too much you were too sck on but you got her part of you so you see that you seek to please one another you seek to do good to one another and the best you can praise the name of our Lord so the wife of your youth should be continuously your friend the Bible says she's the wife of your confidence see that you cherish her all the days of your life even in the midst of challenge there is God help in every challenge praise the name of our regardless of the condition ortion like maybe in some places like we've seen in scenarios in the scriptures where it was barness but then in some families poverty can come the husband loses the job the wife loses the job now if the wife married the man who is Rich look for another rich man to repl so they were not really committed to one another but they were committed to other things around these people but our marriage should be standing on the character of Jesus Christ amen praise the name of our the character of Jesus Christ should not win in our lives it should not disappear in our lives let the sweetness be there the sweetness of God the goodness of God the love of God tenderheartedness bearing with one another that's what the Lord wants you to the way you started as a youth he wants her to continuously be that the wife of your Youth and then you're not going to say those days were very good how about now praise the name of our who has changed it's only the time which has changed but she's still your wife your husband the love should continue kindness should continue one should continue that's what the Lord want praise the name of our Lord living with the wife of your youth praise the name of our Lord and may God always be in your midst create an atmosphere the fear of God praise the name of our don't be complaining there are people don't forgive they will tell you even something of 10 years for his forgiveness but God requires us to forgive from our hearts and the person who doesn't forgive you know the Bible says man who never forget they appointed tormentors to torment him and you know tormentors demons so if you don't forgive you have demons that's what the Bible says let us go and read that scripture praise the name of our Lord let us go to the Book of Matthew and then Verse 18 Matthew 18 verse4 praise the name of our Lord let us start from verse 32 MTH 1832 then his Lord after he had called him said unto him oh th Wicked servant I forgive thee all that dat because me so if you don't forgive the Bible says you are wicked then he says though should not thou also have compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had p on [Music] Thee the Lord and his Lord was Ro to the tormenters till he should pay all that was due to him so until you forgive the demon of will not leave you we need to create an atmosphere an Atmos of forgiving an atmosph of repenting anmos of being tenderhearted anmos of bearing with one another praise the name of our and then you'll have that peace and the presence of God is around you and then the Lord will fight your batt praise the name of our we need to have a marriage a union that is blessed of the Lord the Lord is dwelling in our house the Lord is living in our midst praise the name of our Lord Isaac you've taken Rose in her youth she is the wife of your youth praise the name of make her keep on smiling praise the name of Lord you know smile silently praise the name of our just that is her and Isaac praise the name of our he was just so pleased praise the name of and then we ask him is she the one she's the one praise the name of Lord let her Contin be the one not another praise the name of our Lord delighting in your wife delighting in your husband that's how the Lord wants us to leave not seeking a replacement or seeking something different but living in the fear of God may God bless you am amen let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ oh we thank you heavenly father that you made the marriage and it's you maintains the marriage giving us instructions of what we should do and father ISAC
