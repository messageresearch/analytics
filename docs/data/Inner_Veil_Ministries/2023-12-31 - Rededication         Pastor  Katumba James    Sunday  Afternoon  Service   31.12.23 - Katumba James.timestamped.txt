[48:44] from 300 p.m. up to
[48:50] 3:30 that's where I have been and then I
[48:53] didn't know what to talk about
[48:56] but now when I reached there the Mind
[48:58] came to me about Genesis 8 verse
[49:04] 22 where the Bible
[49:07] says that
[49:10] seasons and
[49:12] times
[49:14] time time
[49:17] winter
[49:19] summer night and day will not cease so I
[49:25] talked about
[49:27] it is God that gives us the
[49:31] time praise the name of our who created
[49:35] it when you read in Genesis 1 verse
[49:39] 14 he says he has put the lives in the
[49:43] Heavens to give us
[49:46] times years month and
[49:50] everything that's now the life here live
[49:53] on earth like when you look at how they
[49:56] talk about a
[49:58] year a year is when the sun has fully
[50:01] rotated I mean the Earth has fully rated
[50:03] around the
[50:06] sun and the
[50:08] day this the Earth rotates in one
[50:14] place and as it keeps on
[50:17] turning then the hours keep on
[50:20] changing when it is when it is on this
[50:23] other side and the Sun is this way
[50:26] then it is dark this side this side is
[50:29] light then it turns like now in
[50:32] Australia Australia they in a new day
[50:35] already in a new year in America is
[50:38] still
[50:40] night so you how the Lord has made it
[50:44] but yet these things are just temporary
[50:47] things praise the name but we have the
[50:51] true
[50:53] son the son of God
[50:56] God praise the name of our Lord and when
[50:59] the Son of God
[51:01] shines there is no
[51:03] Darkness praise the name of the Lord in
[51:06] Revelations 21 and
[51:08] 22 there will be no sun like this
[51:11] one but it will be the lamp of God will
[51:14] be the light
[51:16] of and then it will be
[51:19] eternity there will be no night there so
[51:22] then I was challenging the people as we
[51:26] have got this light the natural light we
[51:29] have the True Light which we also need
[51:32] to get into and that one puts us into
[51:36] eternity praise the name of as we thank
[51:39] God for the new
[51:40] year we need Christ to be in
[51:44] Us Praise the name of our Lord so now I
[51:47] have your
[51:49] testimony our sister
[51:52] da is very grateful for brother o and
[51:55] sister MAA for giving her this
[52:01] radio and she wants us to dedicate
[52:05] it you know I was almost hesitant of
[52:08] bringing it
[52:10] here I said maybe I will pray it from
[52:14] away but you see as small as it may
[52:18] be it signifies something very
[52:24] important
[52:26] praise the name of our Lord and so she
[52:29] requests us to pray for
[52:31] them to pray for the radi and also to
[52:34] pray for our brother and
[52:36] S there is a brother I know
[52:40] of he wanted to buy a camera video
[52:44] camera and even still
[52:46] photo and then he moved around to borrow
[52:50] money and some people were could not
[52:53] even lend him money
[52:55] and others were saying if I'm going to
[52:57] give you the money you'll become my
[53:01] worker and then another said have you
[53:03] have1
[53:05] million and now you want me to give you
[53:08] 3
[53:09] million and he brought he got the
[53:12] million and put it before him have you
[53:14] this kind of
[53:17] money so he told me told him no you be
[53:21] patient God will open so he got his
[53:24] friends who are doing that kind of video
[53:27] coverage and so
[53:28] on and then he was able to get little
[53:31] money and then he start paying half
[53:34] half and then they gave him the camera
[53:37] on
[53:38] credit now he got that
[53:41] camera and then he brought it to his
[53:45] pastor and said pastor I want you to
[53:48] dedicate this
[53:50] camer and the pastor was humble
[53:53] enough got camera brought it before the
[53:57] church and said you're seeing this
[53:59] camera it's for brother so and so said
[54:03] he wants to dedicate
[54:05] it that from it may come other
[54:08] things so they dedicated the C they pray
[54:12] for that
[54:13] camera and if you looked at that
[54:18] camera and the things that came from
[54:20] that
[54:22] camera it is so strange
[54:25] from that
[54:26] camera he got a
[54:28] car from that camera he got land from
[54:33] that camera he built a house from that
[54:36] camera he got a

[56:32] hour
[56:34] also let us go to the book of First
[56:38] Corinthians chapter
[56:41] 6 from verse 15 to verse
[56:53] 20
[56:57] before we read let us

[57:23] you ified and
[57:26] glorified in the name of the Lord
[57:29] Jesus amen amen so First Corinthians
[57:35] 6 from verse 15 up to verse
[57:41] 20 know ye not that your bodies are the
[57:45] members of Christ shall I then take the
[57:49] members of Christ and make them the
[57:51] members of unh harot God forbid
[58:06] what know ye not that he which is joined
[58:09] to a hot is one body for the two says he
[58:14] shall be one
[58:23] flesh
[58:27] but he that is joined unto the Lord is
[58:30] one
[58:34] Spirit free fornication every sin that a
[58:38] man does is without the body but that
[58:41] commits fornication sins against his
[58:53] body
[58:56] what know you not that your body is the
[58:58] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[59:01] which you have of God and you are not
[59:05] your
[59:16] own for you are bought with a price
[59:19] therefore glorify God in your body and
[59:22] in your spirit which are godes
[59:33] may God blessing of his word may be
[59:37] seated so I want to speak about
[59:45] rededication praise the name of our Lord
[59:49] you know when you read in the
[59:53] scriptures
[59:56] you find
[1:00:00] actually like in the Book of
[1:00:03] Judges the Bible
[1:00:06] says when you know when God didn't have
[1:00:10] a judge
[1:00:12] there then the people were
[1:00:15] Fallen but then when God would bring the
[1:00:18] judge then the people would be brought
[1:00:21] back in the hands of God
[1:00:25] and the Victory of the
[1:00:27] people lasted as long as the judge was
[1:00:31] there when the judge was not there the
[1:00:35] people went back to the things which are
[1:00:37] not
[1:00:40] right and now we see that we are living
[1:00:42] in a
[1:00:44] time that even we've had also the seven
[1:00:47] Church
[1:00:49] ages you know as the Gentile
[1:00:52] church and each Church age God has has
[1:00:54] been sending a
[1:00:58] messenger praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:01] and then you see that when God had
[1:01:03] finished sending a
[1:01:06] messenger then after some time when the
[1:01:09] messenger has
[1:01:12] gone then the people who
[1:01:16] believed then the others who come in
[1:01:21] denominate and then the cycle continued
[1:01:23] on
[1:01:25] but now we are living at the end
[1:01:28] time where the Revival that God sent by
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:35] prophet can never be
[1:01:39] denominated praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:42] so then because this is the word in its
[1:01:47] fullness and then you see
[1:01:52] also let us read in this
[1:01:57] message the spoken word is the Original
[1:02:01] Seed he says but in every
[1:02:05] generation every Revival bring forth
[1:02:08] some prophet of
[1:02:11] God a prophet is a
[1:02:14] preacher true preacher on the
[1:02:17] word that stays with the word and they
[1:02:21] bring forth a
[1:02:23] Revival
[1:02:24] that gathers that elect out of that
[1:02:30] generation then in paragraph
[1:02:36] 104 he
[1:02:38] says each generation has its
[1:02:42] Revival God raises up a
[1:02:46] man sets him with his
[1:02:50] word and starts him out for the message
[1:02:53] of that age
[1:02:56] and as soon as that man is taken off the
[1:03:00] scene somebody else catches it and
[1:03:02] hybrids
[1:03:07] it praise the name of our Lord and now
[1:03:10] we see even what's happening in our
[1:03:13] time that if we are not
[1:03:16] careful you find yourself with a message
[1:03:20] that has been
[1:03:23] hybridized
[1:03:25] you know the me the true
[1:03:27] message some people would get it and
[1:03:31] then they mix it with their
[1:03:34] ideas and then maybe some people because
[1:03:37] they are having a different
[1:03:41] background maybe he was a
[1:03:43] Baptist he wants to mix the Baptist
[1:03:46] understanding in and bring it in the
[1:03:51] message or maybe he was a Catholic get
[1:03:54] the Catholic understanding and bring it
[1:03:56] into the
[1:03:58] message or he was a
[1:04:00] Pentecostal still as the p h and wants
[1:04:03] to bring it in the
[1:04:07] message kind of like making it a
[1:04:11] hybd not something that is
[1:04:15] pure so we see that this Spirit still
[1:04:19] exist but the true bride of Christ will
[1:04:23] overcome
[1:04:24] all these
[1:04:27] Spirits praise the name of Lord the true
[1:04:29] bride of Christ will overcome all this
[1:04:33] deception and now we know that we are
[1:04:35] living in a
[1:04:37] time where the challenge is
[1:04:41] great praise the name of our Lord and
[1:04:44] that's why we need to rededicate our
[1:04:48] lives you know you rededicate
[1:04:52] it praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:54] and you know like Paul
[1:04:56] say I'm
[1:04:59] crucified so Christ has to be risen in
[1:05:03] our
[1:05:04] lives I Die daily so if I die daily then
[1:05:09] I can only become alive in Christ and
[1:05:13] that should always be our
[1:05:15] desire a
[1:05:17] rededication if yesterday didn't do
[1:05:19] something
[1:05:21] right if yesterday didn't do something
[1:05:23] well
[1:05:25] Lord help me today to do better than I
[1:05:27] did
[1:05:28] yesterday what are you doing you are
[1:05:31] rededicating
[1:05:33] Yourself Praise the name of our Lord
[1:05:36] you're saying Lord help me in this kind
[1:05:37] of
[1:05:38] situation and that should be a Christian
[1:05:42] Burden Burden in your heart that you
[1:05:45] know you seek the Lord and say Lord I
[1:05:48] want to please you Lord I Want To Know
[1:05:50] Your will for my life Lord I want to
[1:05:53] find out what you want me to do that
[1:05:55] should be always a burden in our
[1:05:57] hearts you know every time that you
[1:06:01] leave every day that you raise up in the
[1:06:04] morning you are saying Lord come to my
[1:06:07] rescue Lord come and help me in this
[1:06:09] kind
[1:06:10] of Lord come and help me this kind of
[1:06:13] weakness read dedication of Our
[1:06:17] Lives praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:06:20] the message it's the seven Church age
[1:06:22] book page 113
[1:06:30] he
[1:06:31] says no True
[1:06:35] Believer is any
[1:06:38] stronger and spiritually
[1:06:42] health and
[1:06:45] Alive than his knowledge
[1:06:50] of and adance to the pure word of God
[1:06:55] God as seen by multitudes of examples in
[1:06:59] the Old
[1:07:02] Testament I just love that he says there
[1:07:06] is no True
[1:07:09] Believer is
[1:07:12] stronger spiritually
[1:07:16] healthy
[1:07:18] alive more than his
[1:07:22] knowledge and
[1:07:26] obedience to the word of
[1:07:28] God so now if you have got the knowledge
[1:07:32] of the word of
[1:07:34] God then you need to be obedient to that
[1:07:37] word of
[1:07:38] God that's how you overcome
[1:07:41] Spirits that's how you overcome
[1:07:44] habits praise the name of our Lord you
[1:07:47] know you hear the word of God and the
[1:07:50] word of God brings to your
[1:07:51] knowledge that this thing is
[1:07:54] wrong so now when you get to know that
[1:07:56] it is
[1:07:57] wrong you start hating the wrong
[1:08:01] thing I don't want to do that kind
[1:08:04] of praise the name of the Lord like I
[1:08:07] this thing just keeps on coming to my
[1:08:10] mind because it is the basic thing we
[1:08:12] can
[1:08:17] our like if you hate
[1:08:19] somebody and then you hear the Bible
[1:08:22] says you should not hate anyone
[1:08:26] say ah it is easier to hate than to
[1:08:31] love because it's a nature to
[1:08:34] hate now you know you hear that is
[1:08:39] bad say Lord help
[1:08:41] me so then your enemy
[1:08:44] comes he really hates you but the Bible
[1:08:47] says you shouldn't hate
[1:08:49] him you shouldn't hate him you shouldn't
[1:08:52] think wrong against
[1:08:55] now
[1:08:56] initially you may not love
[1:09:00] them but now there's a conviction in
[1:09:03] your
[1:09:04] heart that I should not hate them so now
[1:09:07] when you see them
[1:09:12] coming sometimes you feel I don't want
[1:09:14] to meet
[1:09:15] him so the first time you may
[1:09:18] Dodge you pass this way you give them
[1:09:21] their peace then you say
[1:09:25] but they say I should love my
[1:09:27] en and then God brings you back into the
[1:09:30] same
[1:09:33] test and this time either he will get
[1:09:35] you in a
[1:09:38] bank maybe you are the one
[1:09:41] ahead he has lined up a little bit
[1:09:43] behind
[1:09:45] you you come and then your eyes meet
[1:09:49] what are you going to
[1:09:50] do okay you may not say much
[1:09:54] I'm not comfortable with
[1:09:56] that how are you how are
[1:09:59] you and then you feel
[1:10:01] B so it keeps on
[1:10:05] breaking and then you find that that
[1:10:08] terrible heart you had about that
[1:10:12] person it vanishes away the more you
[1:10:15] continue dedicating yourself to
[1:10:19] God it goes
[1:10:21] away praise the name of our Lord you are
[1:10:23] able to overcome that
[1:10:26] situation so now you know the word of
[1:10:29] God you need to oby the word of God and
[1:10:34] that's where our strength
[1:10:35] is praise the name of our Lord we
[1:10:40] grow praise the name of our Lord like if
[1:10:43] a child is starting to to
[1:10:46] walk they walk by
[1:10:49] stumbling and they not
[1:10:51] certain but it doesn't matter how many
[1:10:54] times
[1:10:55] they they will still endeav to
[1:10:59] walk because it is in
[1:11:01] nature and so even the word of God is a
[1:11:06] seat so we just allow it right inside of
[1:11:09] us and then it will bring a
[1:11:12] transformation in our
[1:11:14] Liv just obey it just allow it take
[1:11:19] over in other words you are dedicating
[1:11:22] yourself
[1:11:24] you are surrendering
[1:11:26] yourself the Bible has told us here in
[1:11:29] First Corinthians chapter
[1:11:32] 6 that we are with a
[1:11:35] price
[1:11:37] verse therefore glorify God in your
[1:11:42] body in your spirit which are
[1:11:47] godes praise the name of our Lord you
[1:11:51] just allow him take over your life
[1:11:56] you allowed the Holy
[1:11:58] Spirit to do what he wants to do now in
[1:12:04] the book of Exodus chter
[1:12:07] 25 praise the name of our Lord Exodus
[1:12:15] 25 and then verse
[1:12:19] verse
[1:12:21] 8 the scripture
[1:12:24] says and let them make me a sanctuary
[1:12:27] that I may dwell among
[1:12:33] them so now God told
[1:12:37] Moses that I want to dwell in their
[1:12:41] midst so then God tells
[1:12:44] Moses make me a
[1:12:47] sanctuary and then he told the children
[1:12:49] of Israel to contribute the materials
[1:12:52] for the s
[1:12:55] and then he gave the pattern to
[1:13:00] Moses and then Moses saw the
[1:13:03] pattern and then when Moses you know and
[1:13:06] even God sent the people are going to
[1:13:08] build the
[1:13:10] sanctu he gave them the spirit of
[1:13:14] understanding and then the people
[1:13:15] contributed the
[1:13:17] materials and then Moses was under
[1:13:22] instruction
[1:13:24] that he should do
[1:13:26] everything according to the pattern that
[1:13:29] he
[1:13:31] saw and now the Bible says Moses did
[1:13:37] everything according to the
[1:13:41] pattern which God has shown him in
[1:13:44] Exodus
[1:13:50] 4 Exodus chapter 40
[1:13:55] and then verse
[1:13:57] 31 and Moses and Aaron his and his sons
[1:14:02] wash their hands and their feet there
[1:14:11] at exod 4 ver
[1:14:22] 31
[1:14:25] and when they went into the tent of the
[1:14:27] congregation and when they came near
[1:14:30] unto the altar they wased as the Lord
[1:14:32] commanded
[1:14:44] Moses and heared up the round about the
[1:14:47] Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the
[1:14:51] hanging of the Court gate so so Moses
[1:14:54] finished the
[1:15:18] work praise the name of the Lord so
[1:15:21] Moses finished the work
[1:15:24] the work that he was instructed to do he
[1:15:27] did everything according to the
[1:15:29] Commandment of
[1:15:31] God and that should also be the same
[1:15:33] thing with us to do everything according
[1:15:36] to the Commandment of God what the
[1:15:39] commanded us to do we also should seek
[1:15:42] to do the same thing so now when Moses
[1:15:45] had put everything in its
[1:15:47] position the Bible says then a cloud
[1:15:51] covered the tent of the congregation
[1:15:54] and the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:16:06] Tabernacle and Moses was not able to

[1:16:15] glory of the Lord fill the
[1:16:22] Tabernacle

[1:17:11] you see that when we follow the
[1:17:13] instructions of
[1:17:15] God the Lord will humble himself and
[1:17:18] come
[1:17:19] down that's what happened in the Days of
[1:17:22] Elijah
[1:17:24] you know Elijah when he got the
[1:17:26] instruction of
[1:17:27] God go and gather all the children of
[1:17:31] Israel let them come to mount C so elah
[1:17:35] told Ahab bring the 450 prophets of bir
[1:17:40] bring all of them and then he told them
[1:17:44] we need now to have a
[1:17:46] showdown who is God if B be God worship
[1:17:52] but if the Lord God be godship him and
[1:17:55] then he says let us get two bulls and he
[1:17:59] told them you get the bull
[1:18:02] yourself pick what you want you are very
[1:18:05] many start calling
[1:18:07] on to come and bring fire on the Altar
[1:18:12] and then these people
[1:18:14] here praise the name of they started
[1:18:18] jumping on the
[1:18:20] altar
[1:18:21] oh
[1:18:26] we see of
[1:18:30] now
[1:18:32] bariers they called B from morning up to
[1:18:35] evening and the bar was not
[1:18:37] there and was saying maybe he has going
[1:18:40] to
[1:18:41] hunt maybe sleeping oh shout louder they
[1:18:46] started
[1:18:48] cutting now our God is not like that
[1:18:52] that you punish
[1:18:54] your your
[1:19:04] PR you know this sin which have
[1:19:06] committed need SE be shed his
[1:19:12] blood praise the name of the Lord why
[1:19:14] did Jesus shed his
[1:19:17] blood and then you hear
[1:19:20] somebody saying going in they call it
[1:19:25] dry
[1:19:28] fast and is it how many
[1:19:33] days and this person starts feeling
[1:19:37] hungry but he says no I should not break
[1:19:39] the
[1:19:41] F the Bible says when the fasting
[1:19:46] ended he was
[1:19:49] hungry so the moment hunger comes
[1:19:53] the first is
[1:19:57] over but somebody says I said I said
[1:20:00] this number of
[1:20:01] days number
[1:20:04] ofs now your mind is going to go to
[1:20:08] food and not
[1:20:12] God praise the name of you know Peter
[1:20:15] was praying and
[1:20:16] fasting and he felt
[1:20:19] hungry and when he felt hungry Heaven
[1:20:23] came
[1:20:26] down Jesus was fasting for 40
[1:20:29] days and the Bible says when he had
[1:20:32] finished fasting he became
[1:20:35] hungry so when you become hungry and you
[1:20:39] are fasting no that's the end of the
[1:20:43] F but somebody say no it is this
[1:20:47] this no it's not like
[1:20:50] that and then the Bible says
[1:20:53] that these people
[1:20:54] pray with vain
[1:21:00] repetition and then Jesus says you think
[1:21:03] by much speaking God will hear
[1:21:07] you repeating repeating and some would
[1:21:10] want to go to market places and in
[1:21:13] corners of
[1:21:15] streets you know like you go you got
[1:21:18] Main Street and Main Street and nisam
[1:21:22] Road
[1:21:24] in the corner there he want everybody to
[1:21:27] know oh come and I pray for you come
[1:21:30] what come I
[1:21:32] do the was leaving Fellowship in I think
[1:21:36] two weeks
[1:21:37] ago and then we had stopped at the
[1:21:40] traffic light around
[1:21:45] Road I say woman come she was holding a
[1:21:49] Bible and then she comes I was wondering
[1:21:53] what is she up
[1:21:56] to praise the
[1:21:58] Lord give me some
[1:22:01] Christmas is it you to ask me to feel to
[1:22:04] give
[1:22:07] you no that's not
[1:22:10] right they doing things in
[1:22:16] v and then you're using the Bible
[1:22:20] to no praise the name of our Lord but
[1:22:24] you see there is a lot of B
[1:22:28] worship too much B
[1:22:31] worship but now you look at
[1:22:34] Elijah the Bible says when the time of
[1:22:38] the evening oblation
[1:22:41] came he was referring the
[1:22:45] scripture he knew the time where the
[1:22:47] sacrifice has to be
[1:22:49] made and then he started repairing the
[1:22:51] altar of
[1:22:54] using the 12 Stones of represent the
[1:22:56] children of
[1:22:59] Israel and then he laid every
[1:23:01] stone according to the word of
[1:23:04] God and then he cut the animal and then
[1:23:08] he put it on the on the Altar and then
[1:23:11] he told them pour water several times
[1:23:14] until when they pour the water over and
[1:23:17] then he he rose up and said Lord I have
[1:23:21] done everything sing according to your
[1:23:25] word praise the name of our Lord and
[1:23:27] I've done it according to your word I'm
[1:23:30] not doing it according to my
[1:23:32] understanding but I'm following your
[1:23:35] word and then the scripture says and
[1:23:38] then fire came from
[1:23:40] heaven and then burn the sacrif the same
[1:23:43] thing like now when Moses was dedicated
[1:23:45] was having that Tabernacle
[1:23:49] finished the same thing when Solomon was
[1:23:51] dedicating the
[1:23:54] temple everything was put in
[1:23:57] place the Bible says the glory of God
[1:24:00] came
[1:24:02] down and the ministers could not
[1:24:05] Minister because of the glory of God
[1:24:08] that filled the temple and that should
[1:24:11] be also the same thing with us when we
[1:24:14] have done everything according to the
[1:24:16] command of
[1:24:19] God come and take over all my life you

[1:24:31] you to fill my heart I want you to fill
[1:24:34] my life I want you to take over my life
[1:24:38] to direct me to use me that's the same
[1:24:42] thing he is the same God on the day of
[1:24:46] Pentecost they had also done everything
[1:24:49] according to the Commandment of God and
[1:24:52] then the Bible says the Holy Ghost came
[1:24:55] down from
[1:24:56] heaven Like A Mighty Wind and fill the
[1:25:01] house where they
[1:25:02] were and then CL tanks appeared on
[1:25:07] them and then it settled in them and
[1:25:11] then their ts were
[1:25:14] quickened and then they started speaking
[1:25:16] with and the Holy Ghost filled every one
[1:25:20] of God recognizes when we obey his
[1:25:25] word and that should be our desire if
[1:25:28] this is what the Lord wants you to do be
[1:25:31] obedient to that praise the name of our
[1:25:34] Lord in other words you are becoming a

[1:30:23] he says in the last day that great day
[1:30:27] of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[1:30:29] saying if any man thirst let him come
[1:30:33] unto me and
[1:30:50] drink he that believeth on me as the

[1:41:11] shadows were healing the people that was
[1:41:15] a presence that was an
[1:41:18] overflow a flowing fountain
[1:41:22] they took the hand from

[1:41:37] can lay your hand on a person and pray
[1:41:40] for them even at place of work or at
[1:41:43] school or at home and then the Lord
[1:41:45] hears your prayer praise the name of our
[1:41:48] Lord we need to rededicate our

[1:41:55] reality praise the name of some people
[1:41:58] are disturbed by
[1:42:00] demons you know it's not difficult for

[1:42:30] Holy The Works that I do shall you do
[1:42:34] also praise the name of our Lord God is
[1:42:37] the

[1:43:00] others praise the name of our Lord now

[1:43:06] to Psalms chapter
[1:43:09] 1 praise the name of our
[1:43:12] Lord Psalms chapter
[1:43:16] 1 and then verse
[1:43:19] two start from verse one blessed is the
[1:43:22] man that walks not in the C of the
[1:43:24] ungodly nor that stands in the way of
[1:43:26] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:43:29] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:43:31] of the Lord and in his law does he
[1:43:33] meditate day and
[1:43:49] night
[1:44:01] praise the name of our
[1:44:04] Lord so he says but his Delight is in
[1:44:08] the law of the
[1:44:11] Lord and He meditates upon it day and
[1:44:18] night then the Bible says shall be like
[1:44:21] a river planted by the rivers of
[1:44:27] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:44:30] his
[1:44:33] season his Le also shall not
[1:44:37] wither and whatsoever he does he shall
[1:44:43] prosper and then brother Bram says
[1:44:46] rivers of
[1:44:48] water see
[1:44:51] same
[1:44:53] water but there is an outlet that comes
[1:44:56] this
[1:44:58] way this way and this way depends on
[1:45:03] what
[1:45:04] Outlet it's the same
[1:45:07] spirit so the fountain is here but
[1:45:11] there's an outlet of

[2:31:13] myor and all
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:31:22] good amen praise the name of the Lord so
[2:31:27] come the time of the Lord
[2:31:29] supper in the
[2:31:31] [Music]
[2:31:32] denominations they even take in the
[2:31:36] morning but the Lord is
[2:31:39] supper so we also try to observe that
[2:31:41] the time should be similar the time of
[2:31:44] the
[2:31:45] supper
[2:31:47] praise the name of the Lord and you know
[2:31:50] when the supper time has
[2:31:53] come like you can see mostly in schools
[2:31:56] they start around this
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:31:58] time it is always in the
[2:32:01] evening praise the name of our Lord
[2:32:04] that's why we try to observe it at the
[2:32:06] time when it is
[2:32:11] relevant praise the name of the Lord and
[2:32:14] we know that the Lord is supper
[2:32:17] was the time of the
[2:32:20] Passover and you see in the book of
[2:32:23] Exodus chapter
[2:32:25] 12 they also observed it in the
[2:32:29] evening and then our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:32:33] comes when we go
[2:32:36] to 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:32:42] 11 and then we read in verse 23
[2:32:47] [Music]
[2:32:49] for I have received of the Lord that
[2:32:51] which also I delivered unto you that the
[2:32:54] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[2:32:57] was betro took
[2:33:09] [Music]
[2:33:14] bread and when had given thanks he broke
[2:33:18] it and said take it this is my body
[2:33:23] which is broken for you this do in
[2:33:25] remembrance of
[2:33:37] [Music]
[2:33:41] me so now the bread is unle bread
[2:33:47] nothing is put inside it other than
[2:33:50] mixing it with
[2:33:52] water no oil is put no salt is put no
[2:33:58] nothing is put unle
[2:34:01] bread and said this is my
[2:34:04] body which represents the
[2:34:07] word and then in verse
[2:34:09] 25 after the same manner also he took
[2:34:12] the cup when he had Saed saying this cup
[2:34:16] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[2:34:19] you as often as you drink it in
[2:34:21] remembrance of
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:37] me for as often as you eat this bread
[2:34:41] and drink this cup you do show the Lord
[2:34:43] is death till he come
[2:34:59] whereever shall eat this bread and drink
[2:35:02] this cup of the Lord andw worthily shall
[2:35:05] be guilty of the body and of the blood
[2:35:08] of the
[2:35:15] Lord
[2:35:22] but let a man examine himself and so let
[2:35:25] him that eat of the bread and drink of
[2:35:28] the
[2:35:37] [Music]
[2:35:39] cup so we know our
[2:35:42] lives and when we come before the
[2:35:44] Lord we always need to be
[2:35:48] sincere and you know you examine
[2:35:51] yourself you find you are not worthy
[2:35:55] then you cry to the Lord to help you to
[2:35:59] make you worthy nobody can make you
[2:36:02] worth the Lord
[2:36:05] himself that's why we have the blood of
[2:36:08] Jesus
[2:36:09] Christ that makes us
[2:36:12] worthy by your faith in the
[2:36:14] word makes you
[2:36:17] worthy and then you see that this this
[2:36:20] cup and then the
[2:36:23] bread he says if you don't partake of
[2:36:26] them then you are not part of
[2:36:29] me so it is necessary that you partake
[2:36:32] of
[2:36:33] it and as we said we want to be doing it
[2:36:36] every
[2:36:37] month praise the name of our Lord so let
[2:36:40] us pray as we are going to start
[2:36:43] partaking of it also keep yourself in
[2:36:48] prayer father in the name of
