[10:32] evening and want to appreciate God for
[10:35] the
[10:36] grace and the pastor for the opportunity
[10:39] once
[10:41] again amen and I want to appreciate you
[10:46] all for coming be part of this
[10:51] service amen amen so um let's turn our
[10:56] Bibles in the book of 1 Samuel chap
[11:07] amen amen from verse
[11:10] one for our title this
[11:14] evening we shall be speaking on the
[11:17] reconciliation of God's
[11:22] children praise the Lord in other words
[11:26] the return
[11:29] the
[11:32] reunion of God and his
[11:36] children amen amen so let's pick
[11:41] out uh verse
[11:44] one and the Lord said unto Samuel how
[11:48] long will thou mourn for sa seeing I
[11:50] have rejected him from reigning over
[11:52] Israel fill thine horn with oil and go I
[11:56] will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite
[11:59] for I have provided me a king among his
[12:02] sons
[12:31] verse four and Samuel did that which the
[12:35] Lord spake and came to Beth and the
[12:38] Elders of the Town trembled at his
[12:40] coming and said cometh thou
[12:43] peacefully I
[13:07] and he said peacefully I am come to
[13:10] sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify
[13:12] yourselves and come with me to the
[13:14] sacrifice and Sanctified Jess and his
[13:18] sons and called them to the sacrifice
[13:43] and it came to pass when they were
[13:46] come that he looked
[13:49] on and said surely the Lord is Anointed
[13:52] is
[13:59] Lord other blessing where we may be
[14:02] seated amen amen so um here in the
[14:07] scripture we know we've read about this
[14:10] many
[14:13] times that God had rejected
[14:17] sa and he wanted to
[14:20] appoint praise the Lord so God wanted to
[14:24] appoint a king for
[14:27] himself out of the son of
[14:31] J so God commanded
[14:38] Samuel's praise the Lord and out of the
[14:41] eight
[14:43] Sons you have a
[14:48] king anointed to lead
[14:53] Israel and so when he
[14:55] came they brought the children of of
[14:57] Jess
[14:59] praise the Lord and when he
[15:03] sawab in his
[15:05] mind he saw a
[15:07] man of good
[15:10] St and so he said surely dis anointed is
[15:14] before
[15:18] him but that was not the choice of
[15:23] God praise the Lord looking
[15:27] atab he would fit the test of
[15:32] man to be
[15:36] woring just like so was he was a strong
[15:40] man he was very tall and strong and a
[15:45] giant and
[15:47] vibrant so he had energy praise the Lord
[15:51] and now here when when when Samuel
[15:56] sees and he looked at the sture of of of
[16:02] sa he s that surely was of the same
[16:05] station so he was wor be the
[16:12] king but the choice of
[16:16] man is not the same as the choice of
[16:20] God praise the
[16:22] Lord verse S says but the Lord said unto
[16:27] Samuel look not not on his
[16:31] countenance or on the height of his
[16:36] St because I have refused
[16:40] him for the Lord sees not as man
[16:45] seeth for man look on the outward
[16:48] appearance but the Lord lookth on the
[16:56] heart then they started calling these
[16:58] other children one by
[17:01] one so now when when Samuel had got the
[17:05] inspiration of
[17:09] God praise the Lord God was not looking
[17:12] for
[17:16] St but God was looking for a
[17:22] heart a heart which was like
[17:26] his praise the Lord now they called
[17:30] Abad and made him pass before
[17:35] Samuel God has not chosen
[17:38] him they called
[17:40] sh and the rest of the seven
[17:44] sons and they had not found favor before
[17:49] God and Samuel said unto
[17:53] Jess here all thy
[17:57] children and he say
[18:00] there remain yet the
[18:03] youngest and behold he keepeth the
[18:08] sheep and Samuel said
[18:12] unto send and F
[18:15] him for we will not sit down till he
[18:19] come
[18:22] here praise the Lord so now when they
[18:25] had called the
[18:27] children just said did not think about
[18:31] David praise the Lord because he looked
[18:34] at him as a young
[18:36] man and he was not good look
[18:40] at he spent his life looking after the
[18:43] sheep and the
[18:46] CLE and so when they looked at him they
[18:50] saw he was not fit to be a
[18:53] king So when they called for all his
[18:56] sons they never thought of him so never
[18:59] invited him
[19:01] before praise the Lord but then they
[19:04] realized that none of the
[19:09] seven God had favor
[19:13] upon so now he if there is any
[19:17] other we shall not do
[19:20] anything we shall not sit down until he
[19:23] comes
[19:26] here and so it says go and fetch him
[19:30] and he sent and brought him
[19:32] in and the Bible says he was
[19:39] rud verse
[19:52] 12 and with of a beautiful countenance
[19:58] and good let look
[20:01] to and the Lord
[20:03] said
[20:05] arise anoint him for this is
[20:11] he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and
[20:14] anointed him in the mid of
[20:22] his and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[20:25] David from that day forward
[20:31] that God is
[20:33] choosing the Lord very different from
[20:36] the rest of
[20:39] man praise the Lord he does not look at
[20:42] who you
[20:43] are he does not look at how strong you
[20:48] are how knowledgeable you
[20:51] are God looked for his own
[20:56] heart among all the children of Jess
[21:00] is only
[21:02] David that had the heart and mind of
[21:06] God desire to have a
[21:10] man who has his own mind and his own
[21:15] heart to come and Lead his
[21:18] people this shows us the
[21:22] choice it shows it shows us how God
[21:26] chooses praise the Lord
[21:29] that's how God makes Choice About
[21:33] Us Praise the Lord his choosing is not
[21:36] about how good we
[21:40] are or how good a person we
[21:45] are or how good a family you've been
[21:47] raised
[21:50] in or how powerful your
[21:53] parents or how religious your parents
[21:58] have
[21:59] been but he makes his choice by
[22:06] predestination praise the Lord he chose
[22:09] us not because we wanted him to choose
[22:14] us but he chose us because we were in
[22:18] his mind before the before the
[22:20] foundation of the
[22:23] world no that he chose
[22:27] David not because David presented
[22:29] himself the best
[22:33] King but because it was
[22:36] him that was in it was
[22:39] David that was in the mind of
[22:42] God before the beginning of the
[22:44] world that would be king over
[22:48] Israel now listen close this choice of
[22:54] God can be Len the natural birth
[23:01] praise the Lord see when you're young
[23:04] man you don't know that you having
[23:08] children praise the Lord but you are
[23:11] having
[23:12] children but those children are not yet
[23:15] into
[23:16] manifestation so you cannot call them
[23:20] out you can't have fellowship with
[23:23] them praise the Lord but yet you are
[23:26] having those children
[23:29] because they are a part of
[23:31] you so as you grow up you are growing
[23:36] together with
[23:37] them praise the Lord and now it comes to
[23:40] a
[23:41] point when you
[23:43] feel you want to have these children
[23:48] manifestation but you don't have a
[23:52] picture of how they look like but you
[23:56] know you can bear these children
[23:59] praise the Lord so time comes that now
[24:02] you make a
[24:04] choice and you pick a
[24:07] woman and you Mar them to be your
[24:10] wife so you start a
[24:13] family and as God
[24:16] provided time comes that you begin to
[24:19] Bear
[24:21] children praise the lot but
[24:24] before when you are young when they tell
[24:28] you you have
[24:29] children you cannot even
[24:33] imagine you can't even think about it
[24:36] because you can't see
[24:38] them why because those
[24:41] children are still a part of you they
[24:45] are still in your
[24:46] Lo so they cannot be
[24:49] seen praise the Lord but then when you
[24:52] become a
[24:53] father and you produce these
[24:56] children then they grow up
[24:59] and then you begin to have fellowship
[25:02] with
[25:04] them you begin calling them
[25:07] out and now those
[25:09] children by
[25:11] birth they have a right to call you
[25:17] father praise the Lord they have a right
[25:20] to your
[25:22] possessions they have a right to have
[25:25] fellowship with
[25:27] you because they are your
[25:30] children praise the Lord and I also want
[25:32] to say this that even the
[25:36] children before they are
[25:38] born they have no
[25:41] choice how they should be
[25:44] born which family they are
[25:47] born praise the Lord so it's not until
[25:51] they are born and brought into
[25:56] manifestation that by
[25:59] they have that
[26:02] Authority call you
[26:05] father praise the Lord and now there is
[26:09] no choice to
[26:12] eat that this is the kind of child I
[26:15] want to
[26:17] produce praise the Lord you wait until
[26:21] the child is in
[26:24] manifestation that's when you know that
[26:26] you have a boy a boy a
[26:31] girl and so you give them a
[26:34] name and I want say
[26:37] this that now your
[26:40] children will have
[26:43] authority over your
[26:46] name given to
[26:48] them
[26:50] by Praise the Lord so my children have a
[26:54] right to call me papa
[26:58] because that's who I am to
[27:01] them praise the Lord I have no choice to
[27:04] say you cannot call me
[27:07] Papa because by
[27:10] birs they are part of me they are
[27:13] bearing my
[27:15] life praise the Lord they are bearing my
[27:19] my my my
[27:20] DNA so they are my
[27:23] children because they are having my life
[27:28] of my life was given to them so they are
[27:31] my
[27:34] children praise the Lord and now Jesus
[27:37] said that all that the father brings to
[27:42] me I will not
[27:45] lose praise the Lord so now Jesus praise
[27:49] the Lord as we shall see in the
[27:53] scriptures praise the Lord that when God
[27:55] is choosing us
[27:58] his
[28:00] choosing is not
[28:04] conditional praise the Lord it has no it
[28:07] has no
[28:10] attachment in other words we have no
[28:13] choice over God is
[28:17] choosing and none of us did not ask God
[28:23] to choose them to
[28:25] himself no it's not that it is God
[28:30] himself that chose us praise the Lord
[28:34] God himself that located us but how like
[28:40] the Bible says God CHS
[28:43] us because we were in
[28:46] him the foundation of the
[28:49] world so when we come into
[28:52] manifestation we come to
[28:55] manifest the life and Glory of the
[28:59] father so as my children are growing
[29:03] up when I look at him I look at them I
[29:07] am able to see myself in
[29:10] them and when they pass here you are
[29:14] able to say those children belong to
[29:18] Wilson because they are M there is
[29:21] something that connects me and my
[29:25] children so when you look at them
[29:28] you say those children belong to
[29:31] Joshua or they belong to
[29:33] Dan no but when you see Joshua's
[29:37] children you see these children belong
[29:39] to
[29:41] Joshua because there is an
[29:45] identification something that
[29:47] [Music]
[29:48] proves these children are bearing the
[29:51] life of
[29:53] Joshua that's why even their St
[29:59] their
[30:00] character the way they
[30:02] walk they walk like
[30:04] him because the life of
[30:07] Joshua is Manifest in those
[30:11] children praise the Lord now when we
[30:15] also bear these
[30:18] children we give them a name and when we
[30:21] give them a name we give them a name to
[30:24] identify them
[30:29] so when they get any
[30:32] difficulty when they get
[30:34] scared they run over the
[30:37] father praise the Lord when they are
[30:39] playing
[30:40] around they have the Liberty to
[30:44] pray but when something scares
[30:47] them they will run straight to their
[30:51] parents they won't run to anyone
[30:54] around they make be many people in the
[30:57] congregation
[31:00] child run straight to his
[31:03] parents because they know that where
[31:06] their protection
[31:09] is praise the Lord and they have that
[31:13] Liberty and
[31:16] authority to have protection from their
[31:20] father th why Jesus
[31:23] said whoever the god brings to me
[31:30] I will lose
[31:31] none praise the Lord until the last
[31:36] day so now when God chooses
[31:40] us like I said he chooses Us by
[31:45] predestination praise the Lord but
[31:48] before that in the
[31:50] beginning genis verse the Bible
[31:54] says that the
[31:56] heavens and the Earth were without
[32:00] form and the spirit of God moved upon
[32:03] the face of the
[32:07] waters so he began putting things into
[32:12] existence until
[32:15] day but although everything created was
[32:18] so
[32:20] beautiful there was a desire for
[32:24] God praise the Lord to have children
[32:28] to worship him to have children to take
[32:33] care of all his
[32:36] possession so now God said to the
[32:40] angels I think it is
[32:43] good can we create
[32:46] man in our own
[32:48] image praise the Lord and the Bible says
[32:51] in
[32:56] genes that God said let us create M our
[32:59] own
[33:02] image after our
[33:05] likeness and let them have domion over
[33:08] the fish of the
[33:16] sea and over the the fall of the air and
[33:20] over the C and over all the Earth
[33:28] so God created man in his own
[33:31] image in the image of God created he him
[33:34] male and female
[33:40] created and in 2 verse it
[33:45] says and the Lord God formed man of the
[33:48] Dust of the Dust of the ground and
[33:51] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[33:54] life and Man became a living soul
[34:07] so it was the choice of
[34:10] God to make man it was the choice of God
[34:15] to know which kind of person this man
[34:17] would
[34:19] be and when he chose how man would look
[34:24] like let them be in our own image
[34:29] after our own
[34:32] likeness so it is not
[34:35] Adam that told
[34:37] God that create me and let me be in this
[34:42] kind of
[34:44] form praise the Lord it was not in the
[34:47] choices of
[34:50] Adam praise the Lord it was the choices
[34:53] of
[34:54] God that he chose what to create
[34:58] and what kind of man he
[35:01] created praise the Lord so now when God
[35:04] created
[35:05] man he saw himself in the image of in in
[35:09] the person that he
[35:13] created praise the Lord he saw man and
[35:17] he saw
[35:19] himself praise the Lord and now God
[35:22] rested and he gave all the
[35:26] possession and he gave all the
[35:29] Earth under the control of
[35:32] Adam Adam had
[35:35] authority over everything that was in
[35:37] the
[35:39] earth praise the Lord because he came
[35:43] from
[35:44] God is God who created him andap 2 verse
[35:49] the Bible
[35:51] said that now after God had created this
[35:55] Adam in his own image
[35:58] then God picked his
[36:01] life and he breathed this life into
[36:05] Adam so now Adam became a living
[36:09] soul and now he began to walk upon the
[36:12] face of the
[36:13] Earth exercise domion over the face of
[36:17] the
[36:19] Earth praise the Lord there is something
[36:22] we are driving on
[36:24] to and now suddenly
[36:28] we came into the world like
[36:30] that we came into the
[36:33] world like that then along the
[36:37] way we
[36:39] lost our
[36:42] positions because of
[36:44] sin and a veil came
[36:48] in a
[36:50] veil came in and
[36:54] separated that Fellowship that we had
[36:57] with our
[36:59] father but even when the veil came
[37:03] in it did not take away the
[37:07] life that
[37:10] had because the life that Adam
[37:13] had was given him of
[37:17] God and it belonged to God and it is
[37:20] only God that had the capacity and
[37:24] ability to take out that life out of
[37:29] Adam praise the Lord and now along the
[37:34] wayam was
[37:36] blessed and he went and he bought
[37:39] children he subdued the
[37:42] Earth but that Veil contined to be
[37:47] there praise the Lord until God sent
[37:53] Jesus that by way of the cross
[37:57] the way of sin would be
[38:01] broken and by the blood of Jesus
[38:05] Christ we would be reconciled back to
[38:10] God now we would have
[38:13] access to
[38:16] God not through your
[38:18] father not through the
[38:22] pastor not through any religious kind of
[38:24] leader
[38:27] through Jesus
[38:29] Christ praise the lord we therefore
[38:33] notice that the Journey of our
[38:39] reconciliation begins with God in
[38:44] Christ ends with God in
[38:48] Christ let me quote something here
[38:50] before I
[38:51] proceed in the message the invis of the
[38:55] bride of Christ
[38:59] and
[39:00] son is the attributes of his
[39:04] father and just as you were in the je of
[39:07] your
[39:09] father in the body of your
[39:12] father when he was a young
[39:15] boy you you were in
[39:18] him yet he could not have fellowship
[39:20] with
[39:22] you because he didn't know you but then
[39:26] through the bed grounds of a
[39:30] mother you were brought forth into the
[39:33] Earth and become in the image of your
[39:38] father then he come fellowship with
[39:42] you and so were you sons of God and
[39:46] Daughters of
[39:49] God before there was even a
[39:55] moonar a molecu
[39:59] you are Sons and Daughters of
[40:03] God for you are only the physical
[40:06] manifestation of the attributes that was
[40:09] in God at the
[40:13] beginning remember the Bible says that
[40:15] in the
[40:17] beginning when heaven when the Earth had
[40:20] no
[40:21] form the spirit of God moved over the
[40:24] face of the Earth
[40:28] and it was moving upon the face of the
[40:32] Earth it was moving upon the
[40:35] waters and the prophet
[40:37] says that just the same way we are a
[40:40] manifestation of our natural
[40:46] fathers that were with our
[40:49] fathers when was still young
[40:53] boys he says the same way we were with
[40:56] God
[40:58] when he moved upon the face of the
[41:02] waters we were in
[41:04] go he was still the spiritual in the
[41:06] spirit
[41:09] form but then he wanted something to
[41:12] have fellowship with
[41:14] him so he of
[41:18] him to produce
[41:21] children that now
[41:24] manifest and have fellowship with him
[41:27] so he says you were in the you are the
[41:30] attributes of
[41:33] God that was in God at the
[41:36] beginning for there is only one form of
[41:39] eternal
[41:42] life that was
[41:44] you before the beginning of the
[41:47] world that means we were
[41:52] Eternal the Lord before the beginning of
[41:55] the
[41:56] world we are
[41:58] Eternal praise the Lord because we are
[42:02] Eternal the beginning of the
[42:05] world if we are children of
[42:08] God and if we are the manifestation of
[42:11] the attributes of
[42:14] God God is
[42:18] eternal and if we are the children of
[42:21] God that means we are also eternal
[42:27] Living God and says you don't know
[42:29] nothing about
[42:34] it NE did you know when you was in your
[42:41] father but you are manifested
[42:44] to In His Image in the image of God you
[42:48] are
[42:50] made and you were manifested for the
[42:52] glory and fellowship of God
[42:57] so as sure as you the as sure as your
[43:01] had to be in your
[43:05] father before your natural
[43:09] birth your spiritual had to be in
[43:15] God because you are an expression of the
[43:18] attributes of his thoughts before the
[43:20] foundation of the
[43:26] world that's right now notice then that
[43:31] life being in
[43:34] you which is the life of
[43:36] God God's life being in
[43:40] you from the foundation of the
[43:44] world that makes us
[43:48] Eternal praise the Lord so we come into
[43:51] this
[43:52] body to manifest the attributes of the
[43:56] father
[43:59] praise the Lord
[44:01] spiritually we manifest the attributes
[44:04] of the
[44:06] Father the same way physically we
[44:09] manifest the attributes of us our
[44:11] natural
[44:14] fathers and another message I
[44:18] quote God is his own interpreter
[44:23] 64 1964 vers paragraph
[44:27] says now all we are today is the display
[44:31] of his
[44:35] attributes
[44:37] first he was not even
[44:40] God God we would just call him the
[44:44] Eternal
[44:48] one he wasn't
[44:50] God because the word English word god
[44:54] means object of worship
[44:57] so before he created
[45:00] us he was the Eternal
[45:03] one and there was nothing to worship
[45:06] him so he was the Eternal
[45:09] one the main Fountain of all
[45:15] intelligence and in this Fountain of all
[45:20] intelligence there was not an
[45:24] atom or nothing light nowhere
[45:29] light star moon nothing
[45:36] else so God what we know as
[45:41] God the great spirit that was
[45:46] eternal he was there and in him was the
[45:52] attributes it was the attributes to God
[45:58] then his attributes to be a
[46:03] father he had attributes as
[46:07] God then his to be a
[46:12] father then to be a
[46:16] son to be
[46:19] AI attrib to be a
[46:23] Healer all these attributes was in him
[46:28] these things that has unfolded since
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] then
[46:41] unfolded just his attributes being made
[46:49] manifest what I mean attributes was his
[46:54] thoughts
[46:59] and a word is a thought
[47:05] expressed and then that was in his
[47:09] thinking and when he said let there
[47:13] be
[47:14] there let there be there
[47:18] was and now remember you
[47:22] Christians where his thoughts before
[47:24] there was a world
[47:31] praise the Lord you are
[47:34] hiss praise the Lord you look at
[47:38] yourself who you are you are the
[47:41] thoughts of
[47:43] God before the world
[47:45] was praise the lord we are his SS before
[47:49] the world
[47:52] war and now you are the manifestation of
[47:55] his thinking
[47:59] because when
[48:00] he he to have
[48:03] man praise the Lord he s to have someone
[48:06] to worship
[48:08] Him He s to have someone to have
[48:11] fellowship with
[48:13] him so he called the
[48:16] angels and he said to them let us create
[48:21] man so when he said to the
[48:24] angels let us cre man
[48:27] that was the Sal of God that was to be
[48:31] expressed in the form of a
[48:33] [Music]
[48:34] man that's why the prophet
[48:37] says you are the thoughts of God
[48:44] expressed and the thoughts of
[48:47] God before the world
[48:51] was praise the Lord and so when he
[48:53] thought of creating us into existence
[48:59] when he was moving upon the face of the
[49:02] waters he looked at the Earth had no had
[49:06] no form nor
[49:09] vo so he had to set things in
[49:14] order prise the Lord so now he began to
[49:18] create things into
[49:21] existence and now he commanded
[49:23] everything by his words
[49:28] praise the Lord so he thought of having
[49:32] land separated from the
[49:35] waters that was his
[49:37] thought praise the Lord then when he
[49:40] spoke his
[49:42] thought Let There Be
[49:44] land land came into
[49:48] existence so that
[49:50] land was the
[49:53] expression of the thought of God
[49:57] praise the Lord and said let there be
[50:00] animals and when the animals were
[50:03] created the
[50:05] animals became the
[50:08] expression
[50:10] the that God had in
[50:13] his until the six
[50:17] day everything was in
[50:19] order and everything was
[50:22] beautiful now God said to the angels
[50:27] I have a
[50:28] thought I want to have
[50:31] man praise the Lord I want to have my
[50:34] children to worship me because the
[50:39] animals the plants cannot worship me
[50:44] praise the Lord so now he called the
[50:46] Angels said it is it is good that we
[50:50] create
[50:51] man praise the Lord and he said so let
[50:54] us create man
[50:58] praise the Lord and the Bible says and
[51:01] now he picked out of the Dust of the
[51:03] earth and he created the body of
[51:07] man praise the Lord and everything he
[51:10] made about
[51:12] man was his thought into
[51:16] expression prise the Lord we Canen
[51:20] this an
[51:23] artist arti that made this
[51:29] to begin with he has this
[51:33] bottle the image of this
[51:36] bottle and how this bottle would look
[51:38] like in
[51:41] his now when he begins to make a picture
[51:44] of this
[51:46] bottle it is the expression of his
[51:50] thought made
[51:53] manifest praise the Lord and so he makes
[51:56] this B
[51:59] and he gives it all the
[52:02] time until it comes out as perfect as
[52:05] his thought
[52:08] is so when God said let us create
[52:12] man and he picked out of the Dust of the
[52:16] earth he began to form
[52:20] man which was his
[52:24] expression because he wanted cre man
[52:28] his own
[52:31] image praise the Lord and after he had
[52:33] created the body of
[52:36] man praise the Lord he said it was
[52:39] good it was in the image of
[52:42] God but then he did not have the
[52:46] life so now he got this
[52:49] body and he breathed his own life in the
[52:54] body and man became a living
[52:58] Soul so when the prophet says that we at
[53:03] the
[53:05] manifestation of the of
[53:08] God and that we were in the mind of
[53:12] God before the beginning of the world
[53:15] that exactly what he
[53:18] means praise the Lord so now when he
[53:21] comes back to look for his
[53:24] own praise the Lord
[53:27] God is looking for his own
[53:31] identity praise the Lord so now because
[53:35] we lost our
[53:38] identity at the fall of
[53:40] Man we are reconciled
[53:44] back through Jesus
[53:47] Christ by way of the new
[53:50] birth praise the Lord so now the new
[53:54] bir drops the old nature of
[54:00] man praise the Lord drops the old
[54:05] nature It Breaks Loose the old
[54:09] you and it
[54:13] rest praise the
[54:15] Lord
[54:16] life praise the Lord which God breathed
[54:20] into
[54:21] man it
[54:23] restor the life and the nature of
[54:28] God so it's not
[54:31] until man experiences a new
[54:35] birath by the BM of the holy
[54:39] spirit that we come into the
[54:43] nature that we come into the
[54:46] image and likeness of
[54:49] God without the Holy
[54:52] Spirit which is the life of God in man
[54:58] man is not different from a
[55:02] beast praise the Lord it is the Life of
[55:05] Christ in
[55:07] us that makes the
[55:10] difference and now this
[55:13] new is the thing that is beyond our
[55:17] control it has nothing to do with to do
[55:21] with our
[55:23] abilities your reconciliation back to
[55:26] God
[55:28] nothing to do with our
[55:32] capabilities it has to begin with
[55:37] God that begins
[55:39] it and God that ends
[55:43] it so now I want to say this that we
[55:47] didn't
[55:48] believe praise the lord we don't
[55:52] believe what would be calling belief is
[55:55] simply recognizing our position in
[56:00] God that we are Sons and Daughters of
[56:05] God he is our
[56:07] father so when we hear the voice of the
[56:12] Father by way of the
[56:14] word it speaks about a
[56:19] nature it speaks about our
[56:24] nature that we lost
[56:27] praise the Lord before the
[56:31] fall and in response we come into
[56:37] obedience and
[56:39] believe and follow what the voice of the
[56:42] father
[56:44] says that's when we find ourselves in
[56:46] Obedience of the
[56:49] word you have no control over
[56:53] that it is god making his way
[56:58] out from the
[57:00] inside so you
[57:02] believing praise the Lord each one of
[57:06] us our
[57:08] belief has
[57:10] nothing to do with who we
[57:15] are praise the Lord it had
[57:18] nothing it had
[57:20] nothing to do with who you
[57:24] were it was in the making of
[57:28] God that at such a time and at such a
[57:33] point in such a place you come to know
[57:39] who you
[57:41] are that you are not of the
[57:43] world but you belong to
[57:46] God and when you heard the
[57:49] voice when you heard the
[57:51] word there was a response to the word
[57:57] which was beyond your
[58:00] control praise the Lord because there is
[58:03] a nature of
[58:05] you that is of god and that nature
[58:10] responds to the word of
[58:14] God so God had loc
[58:18] us all our walks of
[58:22] life it didn't matter
[58:26] you were it didn't matter which
[58:30] religious organization you belong
[58:32] to it didn't matter praise the Lord
[58:37] which which which which woman you are
[58:39] you
[58:41] married or which husband you married
[58:45] to to whose parents you were
[58:49] born when the time came for God to call
[58:52] out your
[58:54] name when the time came for God to
[58:56] reconcile you back to
[59:01] himself it had to break this
[59:05] nature and all the powers that were
[59:08] ruling over
[59:10] you it had to
[59:12] break all the religious attachments that
[59:16] we are holding
[59:18] you praise the Lord because there was
[59:21] something on the inside of
[59:23] you that was responding to the nature of
[59:27] God when he called you
[59:30] out like the prophet
[59:33] says was the
[59:35] point when you are
[59:38] recognizing that this is not where I
[59:42] belong so when you heard it you walked
[59:46] up straight and responded to the
[59:49] voice not
[59:52] minding what your father would say
[59:56] minding what your wife would
[59:59] say minding what your husband would
[1:00:04] saying what your boss at work would
[1:00:08] say all that
[1:00:11] matter your response to what that
[1:00:16] call praise the Lord was a deep
[1:00:19] responding to the
[1:00:23] Deep so now when we are being reconciled
[1:00:26] back to
[1:00:28] God when we are being
[1:00:32] reconciled back to that which was before
[1:00:35] the
[1:00:37] beginning the life of God in
[1:00:40] us it breaks all barriers around
[1:00:45] us praise the Lord and it has nothing to
[1:00:49] do with
[1:00:52] yourself you have no control over it
[1:00:56] because that
[1:00:58] call will give you
[1:01:00] Assurance praise the Lord that where
[1:01:03] you're going is the safest
[1:01:06] ground it will give you
[1:01:08] assurance that where you're going you
[1:01:11] are going to your
[1:01:14] inheritance you are going to your
[1:01:16] Eternal
[1:01:19] possession that even if you are rejected
[1:01:22] in this
[1:01:24] body you Assurance on the inside of
[1:01:28] you praise the Lord that you have an
[1:01:31] eternal
[1:01:33] inheritance that shall not reject
[1:01:37] you praise the Lord Jesus says in John 6
[1:01:41] verse
[1:01:43] 35 I am the bread of
[1:01:47] life he that comes to me shall never
[1:01:52] hunger praise the Lord you have no worry
[1:01:55] about what you shall feed on
[1:01:58] tomorrow even when you are kicked
[1:02:02] out praise the Lord and He that
[1:02:04] believeth on me shall never
[1:02:09] thirst and verse 37 he says now this is
[1:02:14] where the thing
[1:02:15] is all that the father give me shall
[1:02:19] come to
[1:02:21] me you like it or
[1:02:24] not you like it all
[1:02:27] not all that the father has given to
[1:02:32] Jesus and the father has given to
[1:02:36] Jesus a role of reconciling all the
[1:02:40] children of God back to
[1:02:44] himself and when Jesus came Jesus says
[1:02:48] all that the father has given
[1:02:54] to and him that cometh to
[1:02:57] me I will in no cast
[1:03:02] out not all that the father given to
[1:03:06] me shall come to
[1:03:08] me from all walks of
[1:03:12] life you shall make your way to
[1:03:16] Christ
[1:03:18] why because where you
[1:03:22] belong to Christ
[1:03:26] the name of living God if God has given
[1:03:29] me
[1:03:30] children by all
[1:03:32] means they shall come into
[1:03:35] manifestation praise the Lord I will
[1:03:38] bear
[1:03:39] them and they will come into
[1:03:42] manifestation praise the Lord if there
[1:03:45] still my
[1:03:46] Lo at the time appointed of the
[1:03:50] Lord those children shall be
[1:03:53] born and they shall come into
[1:03:55] manifestation
[1:03:57] and if you are the children of
[1:03:59] God even when we are lost in the jungles
[1:04:03] of the
[1:04:07] world but because we belong to
[1:04:12] God by all means the father shall call
[1:04:15] us
[1:04:18] out and Jesus says As long as you are
[1:04:23] children by all means
[1:04:26] we shall come to
[1:04:28] him praise the Lord so that's what I
[1:04:31] said it breaks all the barriers around
[1:04:36] us and all that
[1:04:39] matters is our reconciliation to
[1:04:44] God praise the Lord by all
[1:04:47] means when you hear the
[1:04:50] word you hear the
[1:04:52] voice God is locating you
[1:04:56] praise the Lord he is calling out your
[1:04:58] name praise the Lord it was at such a
[1:05:02] time when I heard my
[1:05:05] name I didn't know what it
[1:05:07] was praise the Lord but I heard my name
[1:05:12] because when the word was being
[1:05:14] preached there was something sweet in
[1:05:17] it that compelled me to
[1:05:21] believe that this word has something to
[1:05:25] do with my
[1:05:27] Soul you can't give an explanation about
[1:05:31] it but you respond to it
[1:05:34] anyhow because there is a nature in the
[1:05:37] word because this word himself Is
[1:05:42] God When the word is calling
[1:05:45] out when the word is being
[1:05:48] preached when you hear the words and it
[1:05:51] locates you DRS you to Christ by force
[1:05:57] and then you find yourself believing the
[1:06:01] word and when they ask you but how did
[1:06:03] you
[1:06:05] believe you can't tell a story of how
[1:06:08] you believe why because there was a
[1:06:11] nature on the inside of you that was
[1:06:15] simply responding to a nature that is of
[1:06:21] god that's why the prophet would say we
[1:06:24] come from God
[1:06:27] and we go to
[1:06:29] God praise the Lord is God that calls us
[1:06:33] out he brings us to
[1:06:36] Christ praise the Lord all that the
[1:06:39] father give
[1:06:41] me shall come to me praise the Lord no
[1:06:46] he
[1:06:48] says
[1:06:49] all that the father giveth me then he
[1:06:53] says but you
[1:06:56] you did not choose
[1:06:57] me praise the Lord you didn't choose me
[1:07:01] but I chose you and I didn't choose you
[1:07:06] because you had something pretty about
[1:07:08] you but I chose you because you had my
[1:07:14] life praise the Lord so when the word is
[1:07:17] going
[1:07:18] forward remember the
[1:07:20] message praise the Lord when Jesus was
[1:07:23] talking about the s
[1:07:27] it was being
[1:07:28] sold all over all over and the purpose
[1:07:33] was locate the good
[1:07:38] ground all these other
[1:07:42] grounds way praise the Lord the purpose
[1:07:46] was to locate a good
[1:07:50] ground
[1:07:51] ground is that soil
[1:07:55] has the
[1:07:57] nature of this
[1:08:00] seed of the
[1:08:02] seed no the seed that is falling onto
[1:08:08] it and so he shall provide all the
[1:08:13] nutrients for to
[1:08:17] grow and bring forth
[1:08:19] fruits so when this word of God Goes
[1:08:23] Forth praise the Lord Jesus said I came
[1:08:28] to seek
[1:08:30] those that were
[1:08:33] lost praise the Lord he came to seek
[1:08:37] them that were
[1:08:39] lost lost from
[1:08:41] where that means that with God we
[1:08:47] were praise the Lord and along the way
[1:08:51] we got lost at the fall of
[1:08:54] Man when Jesus comes he comes to seek
[1:08:58] only
[1:09:00] those that were
[1:09:02] lost praise the Lord and we are those
[1:09:07] that had been lost that's why when we
[1:09:09] had a
[1:09:11] voice my sheep knows my
[1:09:15] voice when you had a voice you had to
[1:09:20] respond praise the Lord because the
[1:09:23] voice was calling out your name
[1:09:27] somehow you had your name Wilson being
[1:09:29] called
[1:09:31] out and you said here I
[1:09:35] am and when you you responded that
[1:09:38] voice voice was come
[1:09:44] me
[1:09:48] over I shall give you rest the voice was
[1:09:52] calling each one of us
[1:09:55] that we with God before the foundation
[1:09:58] of the
[1:10:00] world praise the Lord so now we notice
[1:10:03] that your
[1:10:05] salvation our
[1:10:07] Salvation has completely
[1:10:11] nothing to do with the person of who you
[1:10:16] are praise the Lord some of us look at
[1:10:19] ourselves look at where which families
[1:10:22] we are born
[1:10:26] we look at our great
[1:10:30] grandparents nothing good in
[1:10:33] there praise the lord we look at the
[1:10:36] Lage we see most of them were born
[1:10:43] drinking of them may died
[1:10:47] drinking but out of such a
[1:10:51] legacy there was a seed gen of God
[1:10:56] and when the voice went
[1:11:00] F out of such a tinted
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:07] lineage I heard my
[1:11:10] voice and I had respond my
[1:11:14] voice praise the Lord and here we
[1:11:18] are you are here because you had the
[1:11:23] voice you are here because you had your
[1:11:28] name praise the Lord you are not here
[1:11:31] because your
[1:11:33] parents have brought you out in the
[1:11:35] message
[1:11:37] church so many
[1:11:39] children are born in a message
[1:11:42] churches and many of them
[1:11:47] live because the
[1:11:49] father when we
[1:11:52] produce praise the lord we don't know
[1:11:54] what we are
[1:11:56] producing whether it is of god or not
[1:12:00] and the best we do is nurt them in the
[1:12:03] word the time when they come to a point
[1:12:06] of
[1:12:08] decision
[1:12:10] they and they hear the
[1:12:13] word they shall respond to the
[1:12:16] word and there shall be a cry in their
[1:12:20] hearts to come to receive salvation
[1:12:25] praise the Lord that's when the young
[1:12:27] man will
[1:12:28] say I want to be
[1:12:32] baptized praise the Lord there there is
[1:12:35] a nature on the inside of
[1:12:37] him that wants to be identified with the
[1:12:40] word of
[1:12:43] God so you are here because you heard
[1:12:47] that
[1:12:49] voice and I want to say that each one of
[1:12:53] us we are in the image of
[1:12:57] God each one of us are the
[1:13:01] expression of the thoughts of
[1:13:04] God each one of us came from God and
[1:13:09] each one of us is going back to
[1:13:13] God praise the Lord he speaks his word
[1:13:17] he sends his
[1:13:19] message praise the new living God and
[1:13:22] that's why the message of Malachi 4
[1:13:27] the message to this
[1:13:30] age is to bring back reconcile us to
[1:13:36] restore the kingdom of the
[1:13:42] father and his
[1:13:44] people to reunite as the
[1:13:49] children back to the
[1:13:52] father to us
[1:13:55] to Usher us into ever the Everlasting
[1:13:58] Kingdom of our
[1:14:03] God and at the same
[1:14:06] time separating the wheat from the
[1:14:14] tears from the
[1:14:17] tears Revelations
[1:14:23] 11even Ang sound
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:26] and the sth angel
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:30] sounded and there were great voices in
[1:14:40] Heaven There were great
[1:14:43] voices
[1:14:45] saying the kingdoms of this world are
[1:14:49] become the kingdoms of our God
[1:15:03] of the messenger of thean church
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:10] AG the message of the seventh
[1:15:15] angel when it was
[1:15:18] sounded praise the Lord there are
[1:15:21] voices saying the kingdoms of this
[1:15:28] World which theil Satan had
[1:15:33] conquered which has been
[1:15:36] ruling at the sounding of the seventh
[1:15:41] angel the Bible says now these kingdoms
[1:15:45] are being reunited back to
[1:15:51] God and they become the kingdoms of our
[1:15:54] God
[1:15:57] and of his
[1:15:58] Christ and he shall reign forever and
[1:16:05] ever this is a message of
[1:16:09] reconciliation that is calling out the
[1:16:12] nature of
[1:16:15] God that is calling out the life of
[1:16:19] God that is locating the children of God
[1:16:22] wherever they are
[1:16:26] be reconciled back to
[1:16:29] God praise the Lord and now this
[1:16:34] reconciliation is ushering us into the
[1:16:37] kingdom of God and his
[1:16:40] Christ and we shall rule
[1:16:43] forever so now if we are to rule
[1:16:48] forever we have eternal
[1:16:51] life praise the Lord that means the life
[1:16:54] that we receive of Christ is
[1:16:58] eternal why because it is the
[1:17:01] life that we
[1:17:03] wear before the beginning of the
[1:17:06] world so we simply lost it but as long
[1:17:10] as Adam remained the child of
[1:17:16] God the veil that came in
[1:17:20] between not take away that se gen of God
[1:17:23] in Adam
[1:17:26] praise the Lord he still remain the
[1:17:28] child of
[1:17:29] God and that that that
[1:17:33] Veil did not take
[1:17:35] away the life the of in
[1:17:40] us we still have that which is
[1:17:44] eternal and now this
[1:17:47] message simply reuniting
[1:17:52] us back to that
[1:17:57] which we before the foundation of the
[1:18:00] world and
[1:18:02] Jesus and this is the will of him that
[1:18:05] sent
[1:18:07] me that
[1:18:10] everyone which sees the
[1:18:14] son and Believe on
[1:18:17] him may have everlasting
[1:18:20] life and I will raise him up at the last
[1:18:23] day
[1:18:29] no man can come to
[1:18:32] me except the Father which sent me draws
[1:18:35] him and I'll raise him up at the
[1:18:42] last that's John
[1:18:46] 6 it says no man can come to
[1:18:50] me so now where is your ability
[1:18:55] where is your
[1:18:57] striving praise the Lord if you say you
[1:19:00] receive salvation because you prayed
[1:19:05] hard where is your praying
[1:19:08] there it has nothing do with
[1:19:11] you because there is no way you would
[1:19:14] come to
[1:19:16] Christ except the
[1:19:19] Father which sent
[1:19:21] Christ to come and die for you
[1:19:25] draws you to Christ the
[1:19:28] sacrifice prise none of
[1:19:32] us had the
[1:19:34] ability to come to
[1:19:36] Christ none of
[1:19:39] us was
[1:19:41] worthy to come to
[1:19:44] Christ the father loved
[1:19:47] us the father L each one of
[1:19:51] us and even those that are still in the
[1:19:54] world
[1:19:56] as long as they were of God before the
[1:19:58] foundation of the
[1:20:02] world by all
[1:20:04] means they shall come to
[1:20:08] Christ praise the Lord the preacher last
[1:20:11] Sunday was talking about
[1:20:15] theot she was
[1:20:17] aot praise the Lord lived her life as
[1:20:21] aot
[1:20:24] sh had so many
[1:20:27] men praise the Lord but by
[1:20:32] election she found
[1:20:35] herself in the King's
[1:20:38] Arms you look at that that is quite
[1:20:43] interesting a
[1:20:48] woman is part of Christ's lineage
[1:20:54] that
[1:20:55] means her life her
[1:20:59] nature had nothing to do with her
[1:21:04] election your life your
[1:21:08] nature your
[1:21:10] birth praise the Lord your natural birth
[1:21:14] right your
[1:21:16] family all these things have nothing to
[1:21:20] do with our election
[1:21:24] the Lord we are
[1:21:27] elected because we were with God before
[1:21:30] the foundation of the
[1:21:33] world praise the Lord Jesus says no man
[1:21:37] can come to
[1:21:39] me the Father which sent me has drawn
[1:21:43] him to
[1:21:47] me praise the Lord and then in verse 46
[1:21:50] he
[1:21:53] says not that any man has seen the
[1:22:01] father
[1:22:05] he is of
[1:22:08] God praise the Lord you you have not
[1:22:11] seen the
[1:22:13] father no one can be able to see the
[1:22:16] father except
[1:22:19] he that
[1:22:21] is of God we were with
[1:22:25] God praise the lord we were with
[1:22:29] God before the
[1:22:31] foundation are able to know God and see
[1:22:35] God and accept God and believe
[1:22:42] God not because we are good
[1:22:44] people but because we were with
[1:22:49] God praise the Lord no man has seen the
[1:22:55] father except
[1:22:58] he that is of God praise the Lord our
[1:23:05] reconciliation with
[1:23:07] God is of god it starts with God and God
[1:23:13] has to finish
[1:23:14] it praise the Lord when God speaks his
[1:23:19] word praise the Lord he simply speaking
[1:23:23] to his own
[1:23:26] that's why Jesus made that
[1:23:29] statement I didn't come to save
[1:23:34] everyone and I want to
[1:23:36] say this
[1:23:38] message is not sent out
[1:23:42] everyone but it sent out to
[1:23:47] him was with
[1:23:50] God before the world was so it simply
[1:23:54] coming to reunite
[1:23:58] us because we were
[1:24:00] lost so it is opening our
[1:24:03] eyes remember when Jesus was on his way
[1:24:08] to certain of the
[1:24:11] disciples they walked with
[1:24:14] him but yet they never knew who he
[1:24:17] was and yet he had been with
[1:24:20] them but they could not look they could
[1:24:22] not recognize him
[1:24:25] until he picked up
[1:24:27] bread broke it and gave it to them and
[1:24:31] the B says when they ate
[1:24:34] bread eyes were
[1:24:37] open and they knew
[1:24:40] him praise the Lord when you received
[1:24:43] the
[1:24:44] word before you reive the word and you
[1:24:48] ate this
[1:24:50] word Jesus says I am the bread of life
[1:24:54] and if you want life eat this
[1:24:58] bread unless eat this
[1:25:03] bread you have no life and he told the
[1:25:07] disciples and the rest of the
[1:25:09] group that your
[1:25:13] fathers received
[1:25:15] bread which was Mana from Heaven that
[1:25:19] fell every
[1:25:20] morning but that
[1:25:22] bread praise the Lord could not give
[1:25:25] them
[1:25:26] life but says I am he that is sent from
[1:25:31] heaven and I am that bread of life and
[1:25:35] if any man eats of this
[1:25:37] bread he shall not die but he shall have
[1:25:42] everlasting
[1:25:43] life and how are you able to eat that
[1:25:47] bread no man comes to
[1:25:50] me except the father draws him to me
[1:25:54] no man knows the father no man has seen
[1:25:57] the father unless except those that we
[1:26:04] with the
[1:26:05] father I am the bread of life so when
[1:26:09] you ate this
[1:26:10] bread when you receive this
[1:26:14] bread Christ
[1:26:16] Jesus which is the word of God you ate
[1:26:20] this bread and then your eyes got open
[1:26:25] praise the Lord and then you began to
[1:26:29] remember all those that we forgot at our
[1:26:32] first
[1:26:34] birth praise the Lord you began now to
[1:26:38] know who you are that I am of God and I
[1:26:43] am
[1:26:44] Eternal I cannot die because he that is
[1:26:49] in me is
[1:26:52] eternal when the seventh angel
[1:26:56] sounded voes in
[1:26:59] heaven
[1:27:02] that
[1:27:03] behold the kingdoms of go of this
[1:27:08] world have been
[1:27:12] reclaimed been taken back to
[1:27:16] God and His
[1:27:19] Christ and God his Christ
[1:27:24] shall rule this
[1:27:26] world forever and
[1:27:30] ever that is the message of
[1:27:34] reconciliation that is reconciling each
[1:27:37] one of
[1:27:39] us back to
[1:27:41] God as I finish John 15
[1:27:46] ver you have not chosen me but I have
[1:27:50] chosen you and ordained you
[1:27:56] and you should that you should
[1:27:59] go and bring forth
[1:28:02] fruit and that your
[1:28:04] fruit should remain and whatsoever you
[1:28:09] shall ask of the father in my
[1:28:14] name he may give it to
[1:28:17] you I have chosen
[1:28:19] you you have not chosen
[1:28:22] me God chose you
[1:28:30] you are the
[1:28:33] manifestation of the thoughts of
[1:28:36] God we were in the mind of
[1:28:39] God the foundation of the world and we
[1:28:43] are going back to
[1:28:44] God to rule with
[1:28:47] Christ forever and ever and the Bible
[1:28:51] say Jesus said himself
[1:28:54] whoever the father draws to
[1:28:57] me I will not lose him so when you
[1:29:00] receive
[1:29:02] Christ you will never get
[1:29:05] lost when you receive the new
[1:29:09] birth you will never get
[1:29:12] lost Christ has got a grip of
[1:29:17] you until the last
[1:29:20] day we come from God
