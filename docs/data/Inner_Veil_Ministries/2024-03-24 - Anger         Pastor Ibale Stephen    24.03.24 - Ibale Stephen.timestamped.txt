[30:16] Genesis chapter
[30:19] 49 and verse
[30:23] 5 before we read let's
[30:26] pray Father in

[30:53] need father that you may communicate
[30:56] your children
[30:59] we pray that the scripture May mean
[31:01] something
[31:03] special and after this service heavenly
[31:07] father will your children check back and
[31:11] forth and really appreciate being in the
[31:15] word committed this service into your
[31:18] hands in Jesus name amen amen so Genesis
[31:25] chter
[31:26] 49
[31:28] verse
[31:30] five it's a strange
[31:34] scripture he say
[31:37] s
[31:39] Andi
[31:41] areen that's a very powerful
[31:45] statement but even
[31:47] Judah and then nation
[31:51] and they were all their
[31:54] brothers but actually Jacob is saying
[31:58] these
[31:59] two have something in
[32:02] common Simeon and Levi are
[32:07] Brethren instruments of grity are in
[32:11] their
[32:15] habitations
[32:16] amen may the Lord that bless in the
[32:19] reading of his
[32:20] word you may be
[32:23] seated this morning I want to
[32:26] speak
[32:28] on what we call
[32:32] anger
[32:34] anger you see Jacob
[32:38] here he says that they've got
[32:42] instruments of grity in their
[32:49] habitation and looking at this word
[32:53] simply we could be looking at maybe
[32:56] knives or sticks or something like
[33:02] that but it could
[33:05] be tools that
[33:09] hurt maybe uh sh piercing
[33:17] words amen totally unable to handle
[33:24] temper we call it anger
[33:28] verse
[33:29] six oh my
[33:32] soul come not thou into their
[33:38] secretto their
[33:40] assembly mine honor be not thou
[33:47] United in their
[33:50] anger they slew a man and in their self
[33:54] will they dig down a wall
[34:00] C be
[34:03] their now Jacob is not curing Simeon and
[34:10] Levi he's saying that cast be their
[34:15] anger they are nice
[34:17] people but they anger
[34:20] them so he says cast be their
[34:25] anger for it was
[34:29] Fierce and their WRA for it was
[34:38] cruel I will divide them in
[34:44] Jacob I cannot let them stay together
[34:47] like
[34:48] that you see when you go
[34:51] Temple today you'll be
[34:54] United but tomorrow you might be
[34:57] separated
[34:58] and your confuse one against
[35:02] another he says I'll separate them
[35:06] in and scatter them in
[35:10] Israel so today I want to speak about
[35:14] anger in our circles as
[35:18] Christians we become so angry
[35:22] sometimes and sometimes we even get
[35:25] angry on behalf of God
[35:34] so we are people that can become
[35:37] angry at bad things and also at good
[35:42] things and you know
[35:46] because you know somebody can be
[35:49] angry that you we got all this
[35:52] problems because our pastors don't
[35:54] prefer
[35:56] us then another
[36:00] because the pastor is praying for
[36:02] them now why is he
[36:05] praying he says
[36:08] anger cast be their
[36:11] anger so I want over body who really is
[36:16] honest to himself this
[36:19] morning if you are subject to
[36:22] anger just say cast be my
[36:26] anger
[36:29] see so before Jacob changed the
[36:34] dimension amen from M
[36:38] morality he called his sons to a
[36:42] discernment
[36:43] line looking at their
[36:46] past in order to determine their
[36:50] future sometimes our past we always
[36:54] speak great
[36:56] volumes amen
[36:58] about what our future would
[37:00] be except by the blood of Jesus
[37:04] Christ so look back and anything that is
[37:09] negative you just keep picking every
[37:12] negative thing about
[37:14] yourself and keep dropping them in the
[37:17] fountain of
[37:18] blood and you say Lord I even remember
[37:21] this about 20 years ago even that one I
[37:26] drop it in the I remember this about 5
[37:29] years
[37:30] ago this I drop it in the blood this
[37:34] that happened to me last also want to
[37:38] drop amen so he picked out two of
[37:42] them and he says Levi
[37:46] andon and then he Associated them with
[37:51] anger and he says that instruments of
[37:54] grity were in their
[37:56] habitation
[37:59] and yet this
[38:01] anger was ignited by a noble
[38:06] cause so Simeon and Levi are getting
[38:11] anoyed on behalf of
[38:15] God and there are many of us
[38:18] sometimes who get annoyed on behalf of
[38:22] God how can this brother be like this
[38:25] how can that sister do like this
[38:28] and you really find that we go out of
[38:32] range because we really feel God to is
[38:36] annoyed with
[38:38] them but Jacob
[38:41] says cast be their
[38:44] anger These are nice people they are my
[38:48] children Simon and Levi a part of my
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] DNA be
[38:56] their
[38:58] you see he looking at a
[39:01] condition and separating it from a
[39:05] Brotherhood amen so The Story Goes that
[39:10] when Jacob dwelt in
[39:14] second you know din his
[39:17] daughter went into company with the
[39:20] daughters of the
[39:23] land you know and the sons of Jacob were
[39:27] not at home at that
[39:29] time you see which gives them a very
[39:33] good quality of
[39:36] Personality that these sons of
[39:39] Jacob were very protective of their
[39:46] sister amen so some of you young men you
[39:51] watch your
[39:52] sisters go with the daughters of the
[39:54] land but we need to be the sons of
[39:59] Jacob so that we can care for our
[40:03] sisters so and when you know when sh the
[40:07] the son of
[40:10] H Prince of the
[40:12] country when he saw dinner he took her
[40:17] and lay with
[40:19] her and defiled
[40:21] her and not only that but when he did it
[40:27] his soul locked on
[40:31] her he didn't want to let her
[40:34] goed her in the
[40:37] house
[40:38] so speaks to
[40:41] H which was his father to arrange a
[40:45] marriage for him with
[40:48] dinner and all this
[40:50] happens when the sons of
[40:53] Jacob were not at
[40:56] home now let me tell you
[40:58] sons all children
[41:01] forever amen you really need to be
[41:05] so to a
[41:08] level where your father can depend on
[41:14] you that your father can
[41:18] consult you have matured to a
[41:21] level where you can become a coun to
[41:24] your
[41:26] father we cannot do that when we are
[41:30] still living the life that the world
[41:34] lives but the sons of
[41:37] Jacob had
[41:39] matured amen praise the Lord so when
[41:43] they came back Jacob Brees his
[41:48] sons and they were so
[41:51] griev
[41:53] because in
[41:56] Israel
[41:58] in line with their
[42:00] sister which things should not have been
[42:03] done so son
[42:09] his they came to discuss the issues
[42:14] of because the sons have come
[42:17] back and the sons of
[42:19] Jacob
[42:23] [Music]
[42:26] answer
[42:28] and he said because he had failed
[42:31] because he had defiled din their
[42:37] sister then they said well we shall
[42:40] demand one
[42:42] thing go back and
[42:45] circumcise you your son and all your
[42:49] people then you come back we shall talk
[42:52] about
[42:53] Mar and it came to pass on the third day
[42:58] when they were really
[43:02] s that the two
[43:05] sons Simon and Levi took each man his
[43:12] SW and came upon the city
[43:15] board and they slew all the
[43:19] men and no
[43:24] CA are you together with me yeah they
[43:27] shouldn't have done this to their
[43:30] sister and then they
[43:33] annoyed they developed
[43:35] anger they pulled tools out of their
[43:40] habitation and they went and slew the
[43:44] men and they took back their
[43:48] sister and then the rest of their
[43:52] Brethren came and they just ped the city
[44:04] am they took their
[44:07] sheep they took their
[44:10] Ox they took their
[44:13] asses took all their
[44:16] wealth and they even took their little
[44:19] ones and took their
[44:24] wies and
[44:26] Jacob say to Simeon and
[44:30] Levi you have troubled
[44:32] me to make me stink among these
[44:38] inhabitants and answer
[44:41] say should he deal with our
[44:50] sister if they are dealing with a
[44:56] prostitute
[44:58] a no
[45:02] cause are you together with me so the
[45:06] other
[45:08] 10 just joined in the
[45:11] slaughter but the blame goes to Li and
[45:16] Simon which were the ring
[45:19] leaders so I would advise you
[45:22] friends that if there is anything
[45:25] negative
[45:27] be found not to be a ring
[45:31] leader okay so Jacob
[45:35] said I will divide them in
[45:39] Jacob and scatter them in
[45:42] isra cannot allow these two red hes
[45:48] together amen so every
[45:51] assembly has this kind of hot tempered
[45:55] Saints
[45:58] not that they are bad
[46:00] people but cast be
[46:03] their and they use extra
[46:07] Force to deal with situations in
[46:13] church then they start
[46:18] saying the pastor is doing
[46:22] nothing they are extra red hot
[46:30] they want to ear everything by
[46:33] law before Grace can
[46:36] come then brother Bram talks about you
[46:40] know an eating
[46:43] place that dou a that he went
[46:51] to are you together with me I'm
[46:55] dealing with the issue of
[47:00] temper over some kind of a noble
[47:06] cause and they were
[47:08] right should we deal with our sister as
[47:13] one that deals with a
[47:19] prostitute so they kind of pulled out
[47:24] the
[47:25] weapons
[47:27] from their
[47:29] habitation and they went into
[47:31] attack they said Jacob the P of the
[47:35] house stay you are just a useless man we
[47:40] shall handle this
[47:44] situation now let us get brother Bram
[47:48] here he says I hate to say
[47:54] this it just has
[47:57] [Music]
[47:58] me when I walked in the
[48:02] place the first thing was a
[48:05] policeman standing with his arm around a
[48:08] woman in the wrong
[48:11] place playing a SL
[48:15] machine and a man My
[48:19] AG perhaps had children at
[48:23] home standing there with an around the
[48:26] woman
[48:27] I looked and I thought oh
[48:31] man let's follow the mind of the
[48:34] Prophet I heard somebody
[48:38] laugh I heard I looked back towards the
[48:42] back and a bunch of these
[48:46] boys what is what you call them
[48:50] bits
[48:55] all you know that they flat looking hair
[48:59] cut on
[49:02] top and dark sitting like a duck sitting
[49:06] you know with their neck
[49:11] back with overall
[49:15] jackets and their pants P wet down like
[49:22] this bance not start
[49:25] yesterday you see what I mean so
[49:30] boys brother Bram says
[49:33] boys be a
[49:37] man and I'm going to come back with the
[49:40] subject of a
[49:42] man I preached it about 15 years ago
[49:48] here you got better making than
[49:53] that so they are they
[49:57] back
[49:58] there and the young not 17 years or 18
[50:04] years and that young lady the way they
[50:07] were doing and pulling around
[50:11] her it was a
[50:13] shame and I thought
[50:17] well what about
[50:21] that and they said a
[50:23] woman that could have been my grandma
[50:26] and the lady had real short cut
[50:32] hair and painted
[50:38] blue we are describing a
[50:41] situation now that lady's got a
[50:48] right to anything she
[50:50] wants that's nothing to me but I don't
[50:55] believe the Lord ever made anybody with
[50:58] blue
[51:03] hair brother Bram is trying to tell
[51:07] us that whatsoever sister wants to do
[51:10] with her
[51:12] hair it must still look like
[51:17] hair are you together with me not green
[51:22] not
[51:25] blonde it must must be your black
[51:30] hair it took it looked real
[51:34] strange and the poor old
[51:44] thing the meat on her arm was
[51:49] flanging and so I looked at
[51:53] her I'm painting a picture
[51:57] and there was an old
[51:59] man I'm afraid it was summertime late
[52:04] spring around May or
[52:08] June and the old fellow sitting
[52:17] there and a big SC around
[52:22] his they were sitting there
[52:25] drinking they excused
[52:28] themselves and went
[52:30] out and left her
[52:36] alone I stood there I said almighty God
[52:43] creator of heavens and earth I come from
[52:47] a mountain top to a rat
[52:52] den and I said how can you being holy as
[52:58] I know you are ever look upon such a
[53:03] sin as that and let it
[53:06] exist why don't you just send an
[53:10] earthquake and S the
[53:13] world to mean that my little
[53:17] Sarah and
[53:19] re we have to be raised up under such
[53:22] stuff as
[53:24] that to have to like that young woman
[53:28] back
[53:32] there then he comes down
[53:35] here and he says I wanted
[53:39] God to strike her
[53:44] dead strike the whole thing
[53:47] out and I felt a real fun
[53:52] feeling I stepped back behind the door
[53:57] and I said something was going on he got
[54:02] into that
[54:03] atmosphere where he knows the presence
[54:06] of God has come down around
[54:10] him and I looked and it was a vision
[54:15] moving and I saw the
[54:18] Earth and there was like a circle or a
[54:21] mist
[54:25] of the Earth and I looked like that my
[54:30] eyes focused upon myself on the
[54:36] earth doing sinful things that I not
[54:39] do did you hear that he gets into a
[54:43] vision and in this Vision God shows him
[54:47] the Earth but there was a circle of a
[54:50] red
[54:52] M around the earth and then while he was
[54:56] in the spirit
[54:58] real he began to see
[55:00] himself in the Natural Earth
[55:05] reality and he
[55:09] was are you together with
[55:13] me oh praise the Lord and every time I
[55:19] started to do something
[55:22] wrong I know stre would go up before God
[55:27] and if it wasn't for that missing
[55:35] blood I thought somebody would have said
[55:41] amen he says I was looking at
[55:44] myself I was
[55:46] nasty I was doing something wrong and
[55:50] immediately the report would go back to
[55:53] God but before it gets there Mr
[55:57] Blood come and block
[56:03] it and if it you know it says but the
[56:06] blood of
[56:08] Jesus acted like a bum
[56:11] on and every time my sin would hit
[56:16] God before God's
[56:18] Throne looks like it would strike
[56:22] Jesus before it would strike the
[56:25] throne and he would shake his
[56:28] head and the tears would roll down his
[56:33] cheeks and he would say father forgive
[56:38] him he doesn't know what he's
[56:40] doing that was Jesus constantly
[56:45] interceding for
[56:47] him amen then I do something else
[56:52] wrong then looked like he was just
[56:54] acting like a bumper
[56:58] between me and death because God had
[57:01] already pronounced my
[57:05] death the day I
[57:07] sin that was the day I
[57:10] died then I could not understand why
[57:13] that Miss around the
[57:17] earth and I looked up there my book was
[57:22] open and I not that there was my name on
[57:25] the book
[57:27] and all kinds of sin was was wrot
[57:31] against
[57:33] me on that
[57:36] book God was helping him to understand
[57:40] who he
[57:41] is I pray that God would help us to
[57:46] understand who we
[57:48] are help us stand out in that spiritual
[57:53] room and then look back down on
[57:57] we shall learn to thank God for the
[58:03] blood
[58:04] [Music]
[58:06] amen Lord did my sin make you suffer
[58:10] like
[58:12] that and he was
[58:14] crying the tears on his face and he
[58:18] looked so
[58:21] we po poor bro down eyes
[58:31] and I my sins and caused him to
[58:35] suffer I said Lord Jesus I'm sorry I'm
[58:40] sorry that my sins caused
[58:43] you to suffer for me will you forgive me
[58:48] I promise that I'll be G and I do
[58:51] everything I can if you just forgive me
[58:58] did we talk about the fountain this
[59:01] morning how many of you have come to the
[59:03] Fountain
[59:06] ofda amen allow him to was
[59:10] you he says do you want to be
[59:14] well the answer is
[59:16] [Music]
[59:19] yes and he touched his side with his
[59:24] hand and wrote across that
[59:28] book
[59:31] pardon push it over back in the sea of
[59:37] forgetful to remember it no more
[59:40] against and I fell on my
[59:43] knees and I said oh Lord I can never
[59:47] live long
[59:48] enough express to you my
[59:52] gratefulness for you forgiving my sin
[59:57] he said
[59:59] now I freely forgive you of everything
[1:00:03] you done and you want to destroy
[1:00:10] her
[1:00:12] L and
[1:00:14] Sim with a holy
[1:00:22] indignation so we need to
[1:00:24] deal our righteous indignation with
[1:00:30] wisdom you don't like what you see many
[1:00:34] times and it hurts you many times when
[1:00:38] you see how those young people live
[1:00:39] their
[1:00:40] Liv then we need to deal with the whole
[1:00:45] indignation with that are committed in
[1:00:48] the
[1:00:49] city and put a seal upon them that's
[1:00:53] what God wants you to do that you begin
[1:00:56] to s for the sin that you see around the
[1:01:01] church amen so you are too quick
[1:01:05] sometimes because of your ho
[1:01:09] indignation you are too
[1:01:11] quick to judge everything which happens
[1:01:14] around
[1:01:15] church he should be
[1:01:18] excommunicated a righteous
[1:01:21] indignation we have C this
[1:01:24] woman the very
[1:01:27] act and mes says
[1:01:31] we
[1:01:34] indignation sometimes goes with
[1:01:40] quotes the quotes were
[1:01:43] right but Jesus understood the condition
[1:01:47] of that woman better than
[1:01:51] them you know brother
[1:01:54] Bram prise the
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:01] indignation the
[1:02:03] judge brother I mean the man called
[1:02:07] sha you know who was a judge in
[1:02:10] Israel how he went in with holy
[1:02:14] indignation and destroyed that
[1:02:17] guy who was bothering
[1:02:20] Israel but we look at the righteous men
[1:02:26] like
[1:02:28] Levi and Simon whose righteous
[1:02:33] indignation exceeded the
[1:02:38] measure every
[1:02:40] Christian needs a level of temperance in
[1:02:44] our
[1:02:47] lives because our God is a longsuffering
[1:02:53] god what is temperance
[1:02:56] Temperance is a holy
[1:03:00] ghost managing your
[1:03:04] temper are you together with
[1:03:06] me somebody
[1:03:10] brother that when someone gets on
[1:03:14] me all steps on my
[1:03:17] toes amen as the old saying is my temp
[1:03:23] arises how can I overcome
[1:03:27] this I know the Lord will have to do
[1:03:30] it but what can I do in my heart I don't
[1:03:36] want this
[1:03:38] thing he's
[1:03:40] confessing I've got a temper if anybody
[1:03:44] says anything my temper
[1:03:48] flar maybe my husband says something
[1:03:52] maybe my wife says something my temp FL
[1:03:57] and those who are used in Temper they
[1:04:00] don't like
[1:04:04] it I know today they want to be
[1:04:10] Overcomers
[1:04:13] brother and he said sweeten your temper
[1:04:17] with
[1:04:19] prayer
[1:04:24] then when temp
[1:04:26] comes that Holy indignation
[1:04:29] comes it's time for you to go down to
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] knees when holy
[1:04:35] indignation attacked the prophet the
[1:04:38] Holy Spirit took him behind the door
[1:04:42] went down to the knees for the
[1:04:46] people let us learn how to deal with the
[1:04:50] ho
[1:04:53] indignation and the temple
[1:04:58] there are two things here that you want
[1:05:01] to develop an
[1:05:03] anger on behalf of God that's
[1:05:08] indignation but at the same time you've
[1:05:11] got the
[1:05:13] temple somebody stepped on
[1:05:16] my these are two different
[1:05:18] areas we are dealing with them
[1:05:22] today many
[1:05:24] times many people people can be moved by
[1:05:28] Temper and temper can cause you to
[1:05:32] produce you know undesirable
[1:05:38] words and they can go into temper TS and
[1:05:42] hit tables and do
[1:05:46] anything and I want to tell you
[1:05:48] today that kind of
[1:05:51] temper affects holy men
[1:05:54] also it affected
[1:05:57] Levi it affected
[1:05:59] Sim are you together with me and then
[1:06:02] the father looks at his boys as very
[1:06:06] nice
[1:06:07] boys he told them cast be their
[1:06:14] anger are we cting our anger
[1:06:17] today saying Lord I need to be better
[1:06:19] than this unless I'm better than
[1:06:24] this
[1:06:34] Moses and I told you the other day that
[1:06:39] Miracles what we call
[1:06:41] Miracles is not you it's just obedience
[1:06:45] to Holy
[1:06:47] instruction That's What miracles
[1:06:49] are when Gideon wanted them he was taken
[1:06:54] into a divine
[1:06:56] leadership to produce the
[1:06:58] miracle you know that signs and
[1:07:02] wonders Divine
[1:07:06] leadership to produce a desired
[1:07:10] result you should not kill
[1:07:13] yourself trying to cause something to
[1:07:16] happen just stay under the holy spirit
[1:07:19] let himself take over for and you will
[1:07:22] find out that certain things haveed
[1:07:26] happen without you
[1:07:30] struggling amen so he telling him go to
[1:07:35] and stand on the
[1:07:37] Rock and th sh The
[1:07:41] Rock and there shall come out what of
[1:07:44] it then the people may drink and Moses
[1:07:49] did so in the sight of the Elders of
[1:07:54] Israel
[1:07:56] you know children of Israel were Ching
[1:07:58] because there was no water in the
[1:08:03] wilderness and God told
[1:08:06] Moses just Smite The
[1:08:09] Rock and he may bring his
[1:08:13] water smiting The
[1:08:16] Rock PS of Jesus
[1:08:19] Christ on
[1:08:20] Calvary that's what smiting The Rock
[1:08:24] Me because Christ was the rock that
[1:08:29] followed them when they were coming out
[1:08:32] of into the land of promise and God
[1:08:37] allowed that this rock would be smitten
[1:08:41] once and then it would produce his
[1:08:45] water are you together with me Jesus was
[1:08:48] Mitten once and he brought forth his
[1:08:52] water the baptism of the ho to wash and
[1:08:56] cleanse the
[1:08:58] church
[1:09:00] amen so the
[1:09:02] children did not again get satisfied
[1:09:05] they ched again for
[1:09:10] water so in
[1:09:14] numbers and
[1:09:16] verse he tells
[1:09:18] Moses take the
[1:09:20] word and gather thou the assembly
[1:09:24] together
[1:09:26] num
[1:09:34] 20se and gather thou the
[1:09:38] assembly and Aon thy
[1:09:41] brother and
[1:09:43] speak the
[1:09:46] rock before their eyes and he shall give
[1:09:50] forth his
[1:09:52] water and thou shalt bring forth to them
[1:09:56] water out of the
[1:09:59] rock so Thou shalt give the
[1:10:03] congregation and their be to
[1:10:06] drink my my my my are you there this
[1:10:10] morning say strike the Rock and he will
[1:10:15] produce his
[1:10:17] water so this rock here represented
[1:10:22] Christ so the rock is Mitten once
[1:10:26] there after you speak to the
[1:10:29] rock hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[1:10:32] Lord he was Mitten
[1:10:35] once and today we speak to him Lord I

[1:10:46] washing Waters of I am you want to drink
[1:10:51] you don't strike the rock
[1:10:54] again
[1:10:56] so we are now supposed to speak to the
[1:11:00] Rock and the next thing is
[1:11:05] prayer but in Anger
[1:11:09] listen in
[1:11:11] Anger the prophet of God advocated for a
[1:11:15] second
[1:11:19] crucifixion are you together with me
[1:11:22] when he had by himself pged our sins
[1:11:27] sat down on the right hand of the majest
[1:11:30] of to receive our
[1:11:32] petitions because he had pged
[1:11:36] our why him being crucified once
[1:11:40] again message
[1:11:43] indictment brother Bram says I indite
[1:11:47] this
[1:11:48] generation crucifixion of
[1:11:53] Christ submitted once

[1:12:18] the pastor is praying for you learn to
[1:12:21] speak to the
[1:12:24] Rock

[1:12:31] by himself pged our
[1:12:34] SE the Bible says he sat
[1:12:38] down he doesn't need to go back again
[1:12:42] into
[1:12:45] sacrifice numbers 20 verse
[1:12:48] 10 and
[1:12:50] Moses and Aaron gathered the
[1:12:54] congregation together
[1:12:57] The Rock and he said unto them here now
[1:13:01] ye
[1:13:03] Rebels must we fet water out of the rock
[1:13:06] for
[1:13:10] you and Moses lifted up his
[1:13:14] hand and with his
[1:13:16] Rod he SM The Rock
[1:13:20] twice and the water came
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] out the congregation drank and their B
[1:13:30] also he smites The Rock second
[1:13:34] time why does the water
[1:13:37] come because the people needed
[1:13:41] it are you together with me God says I
[1:13:45] forbid a woman to
[1:13:48] preach but when they preach people said
[1:13:52] don't people get saved they get sa but
[1:13:56] that's not because of them it's because
[1:13:59] of the condition of the people and the
[1:14:02] Redemption that they were
[1:14:06] seeking
[1:14:09] Moses he was charged with
[1:14:13] anger and before the people he was
[1:14:17] involved in a second
[1:14:20] crucifixion to say that there is enough
[1:14:22] Power in the
[1:14:24] Blood
[1:14:26] amen was to for
[1:14:28] him that is there enough
[1:14:32] power under the blood to deliver these
[1:14:36] Rick and
[1:14:42] R and feel like you need
[1:14:46] another no sir we had one Calvary he was
[1:14:51] Mitten for our
[1:14:53] SE we just need to
[1:14:55] Lear speak to the
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:00] Rock praise the Lord the prophet says
[1:15:05] but
[1:15:06] Moses in his
[1:15:08] anger he was high
[1:15:12] tempered and then the person who asked
[1:15:15] the
[1:15:15] question he says when somebody steps on
[1:15:18] my
[1:15:19] toe my temper
[1:15:22] flares I don't like it
[1:15:26] I know when you have
[1:15:28] temper you know you have
[1:15:32] temper your problem is how to control
[1:15:36] it sweeten your
[1:15:39] temper with
[1:15:43] prayer are you together with me so he
[1:15:46] says Moses in
[1:15:48] Anger he went down there instead of
[1:15:52] speaking to the
[1:15:53] Rock SM The Rock and SM it
[1:15:58] twice that broke the whole
[1:16:01] picture of God's
[1:16:03] program the work was Christ you believe
[1:16:08] that don't
[1:16:09] you amen was only smitten once and we
[1:16:14] speak to him
[1:16:16] now Moses spoke I mean smoke the the
[1:16:20] Christ the second
[1:16:22] time and it broke the world pi
[1:16:26] God's Great program
[1:16:29] here pieces right there was being
[1:16:33] smitten twice when only Smitt
[1:16:38] once God was
[1:16:41] obligation to give that Prophet the
[1:16:44] power to do so but God dealt with Moses
[1:16:53] later
[1:16:57] are we together this
[1:17:01] morning
[1:17:05] temper enough
[1:17:07] power under the
[1:17:10] blood to deal with your
[1:17:13] fornication to deal with h and
[1:17:16] Mal the blood shall never lose its power
[1:17:21] until the last elected Rick and rors
[1:17:29] no yes sir so the Lord spoke to Moses
[1:17:34] and because you have believed me
[1:17:39] not to sanctify me the eyes of the
[1:17:42] children of
[1:17:43] Israel therefore you shall not bring
[1:17:46] this congregation into the
[1:17:49] land which I have given
[1:17:53] them minister
[1:17:56] should hold that anointing God gives
[1:18:01] us with of
[1:18:05] Grace and
[1:18:11] theater they should not
[1:18:14] provoke the Lord's anointed
[1:18:21] anger it has to be
[1:18:23] both
[1:18:25] Moses you've got the power you can use
[1:18:29] it it has been given to you but you need
[1:18:34] wisdom to operate the
[1:18:38] gift one time brother
[1:18:41] BR was having a a
[1:18:44] meeting and up in the
[1:18:46] balcon was these young kids the girl and
[1:18:50] the boy were kissing as the meeting goes
[1:18:54] on
[1:18:55] and it bothered the
[1:18:58] prophet but this is a man who God gave
[1:19:03] Grace to deal with anger and
[1:19:07] temper God told him anything and it will
[1:19:13] happen then he
[1:19:15] says I forgive
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] them I forgive
[1:19:23] them amen so on
[1:19:27] record
[1:19:30] record mes took the position of
[1:19:34] Christ standing between God's
[1:19:38] judgment and the children of Israel in
[1:19:41] the
[1:19:45] wilderness he put himself there on
[1:19:49] record back again the scripture says
[1:19:55] Moses was the meest man on
[1:19:58] Earth but look at how
[1:20:02] people amen who were
[1:20:05] Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:09] caused him to
[1:20:12] anger and he did not complete his
[1:20:16] mission so there should be a flow of
[1:20:20] Grace and respect from both
[1:20:23] sides
[1:20:25] they
[1:20:26] later give respect to their
[1:20:29] Ministry the ministry giving respect to
[1:20:33] the
[1:20:33] people we can be a successful
[1:20:38] Church in
[1:20:41] Galatians
[1:20:43] 6 and
[1:20:46] verse he says let him that is taught in
[1:20:49] the word communicate unto him that
[1:20:52] teaches in all good
[1:21:11] things says let there be a
[1:21:15] Harmony between the
[1:21:18] L and the
[1:21:21] ministry let
[1:21:23] flow of respect from both
[1:21:29] sides that's
[1:21:31] why the angel told the
[1:21:34] prophet if you can get the people to
[1:21:37] believe
[1:21:38] you nothing shall stand before
[1:21:42] you not even
[1:21:46] cancer are you together with me there is
[1:21:50] no way you can be
[1:21:52] blessed by a man whom you have no
[1:21:57] respect you
[1:21:59] see you know believing
[1:22:06] itself accs
[1:22:08] respect if you can get the people to
[1:22:11] believe
[1:22:12] you to believe you would also involve
[1:22:17] according
[1:22:20] respect and the prophet says as you
[1:22:24] respect that
[1:22:27] servant you respect
[1:22:30] God so when I respect you and you
[1:22:34] respect me and we respect each other
[1:22:38] then we are respecting
[1:22:41] God Amen so in the
[1:22:45] church if the church for
[1:22:49] example let us keep our ministers in
[1:22:53] prayer
[1:22:55] because they are the devil's
[1:22:59] t i strike the
[1:23:01] shepherd and Scatter the
[1:23:07] ship are you together with yeah
[1:23:11] sometimes we really need to
[1:23:13] know how to
[1:23:15] deal with things that make us
[1:23:19] unhappy I'll give you another
[1:23:22] example of the man of God
[1:23:25] his name
[1:23:29] is when Elijah was heading out in his
[1:23:35] Rapture God gave him
[1:23:39] instructions to anoint three
[1:23:42] men
[1:23:49] to to be king
[1:23:53] ofri to be king over
[1:23:56] Israel and elishah to be a prophet in
[1:24:00] the place of
[1:24:04] el so if we can
[1:24:09] say he had the anointing of Elijah upon
[1:24:13] his
[1:24:14] head and it shall come to
[1:24:18] pass that's what now the Holy Spirit was
[1:24:22] saying by Elijah
[1:24:25] after anointing these three
[1:24:27] men he wanted them to work
[1:24:30] in and he say shall come to
[1:24:33] pass but you know he that escapes the
[1:24:37] sword of
[1:24:40] AEL shall
[1:24:44] slay and that escap the sword
[1:24:48] of el
[1:24:53] slay they had an
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:57] agreement because they were supposed to
[1:25:00] minister in the same
[1:25:04] cere and that this man here should not
[1:25:08] raise a sword against
[1:25:11] another he says stay together as
[1:25:14] ministers
[1:25:17] in and I thank God for the Harmon of
[1:25:22] spirit behind the ministers
[1:25:26] God bless
[1:25:30] them so
[1:25:32] je he had the
[1:25:35] permission to use this
[1:25:39] SW that's what Elijah told him but in
[1:25:43] Second
[1:25:45] Kings
[1:25:47] 10 verse
[1:25:49] 18 and who gathered all the people
[1:25:53] together
[1:26:04] andto
[1:26:07] them
[1:26:09] Serv a
[1:26:12] little
[1:26:14] and Shall Serve him
[1:26:19] much he was
[1:26:22] raised he was anointed
[1:26:25] to destroy the family of
[1:26:28] Ahab because they led the
[1:26:31] people into the
[1:26:35] bar now this man
[1:26:38] here being a man anointed by
[1:26:42] Elijah he telling the people that Ahab
[1:26:47] did not was enough going to
[1:26:53] more then he says now
[1:26:56] therefore call unto me all the prophets
[1:26:59] of
[1:27:03] B all
[1:27:05] hiss and all his
[1:27:08] priests let be
[1:27:11] waiting for I have a great sacrifice to
[1:27:14] do to
[1:27:17] bowever shall be wa
[1:27:21] wed he shall not leave
[1:27:25] but did
[1:27:27] it
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:33] in to the int that he might destroy the
[1:27:37] worshipers of
[1:27:41] b a holy
[1:27:48] indignation are you together with me and
[1:27:51] gave them special uniforms
[1:27:55] so that none could
[1:27:58] Escape so in verse
[1:28:03] 23 of Second Kings
[1:28:06] 10 and
[1:28:08] went
[1:28:11] and the son
[1:28:14] of into the house
[1:28:17] of and say to the worshipers of
[1:28:22] B look that they are be here with you
[1:28:27] none of the Servants of the
[1:28:35] Lord but the
[1:28:39] only so the people went around to see
[1:28:43] that there are no worshipers of the
[1:28:45] Lord that had come up and now after
[1:28:49] finding out there was
[1:28:53] none
[1:28:55] then
[1:28:56] je released
[1:29:00] Israel to go and
[1:29:03] slay he
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:07] had who
[1:29:09] anointed who was
[1:29:11] commissioned to slay all the Servants of
[1:29:16] B and
[1:29:18] B all his
[1:29:21] servants were destroyed
[1:29:25] but the scripture
[1:29:27] say je himself did not depart from the
[1:29:37] golds which were in
[1:29:45] and are you together with we are dealing
[1:29:49] with the
[1:29:51] temple sometimes in the ppet
[1:29:55] and the Lord said unto je
[1:29:59] that's because thou done
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:06] well in executing that which is right in
[1:30:09] my
[1:30:13] eye the house
[1:30:16] of according to all that was in my
[1:30:21] heart
[1:30:22] children of the fourth
[1:30:25] generation shall SE on the throne of
[1:30:31] Israel come on now so God is
[1:30:35] appreciating you know
[1:30:38] je for destroying the house of
[1:30:42] Ahab because that's what he was called
[1:30:44] to
[1:30:45] do and God was
[1:30:48] rewarding that then your son will also
[1:30:52] sit on the throne
[1:30:54] and then your grand son will also SE the
[1:30:57] four
[1:30:58] generations he allowed his
[1:31:03] seed the seed of of
[1:31:06] je to sit on the throne of
[1:31:09] Israel for destroying the house of
[1:31:14] Ahab but for the righteous
[1:31:18] indin against the
[1:31:22] bers Hallelujah Hallelujah it was a holy
[1:31:27] indignation but did God appoint you to
[1:31:30] do that it was an
[1:31:35] overstatement for which God rewarded him
[1:31:41] negatively let me tell you about the
[1:31:44] ministry it can be
[1:31:52] powerful
[1:31:54] but in the
[1:31:56] power there must be
[1:32:01] wisdom we need to handle the
[1:32:05] call tole the call with
[1:32:10] wisdom look when you go to 1
[1:32:18] verse chapter 1
[1:32:22] verse4 and the Lord lord said unto him
[1:32:27] call his name jezel for yet a little
[1:32:30] while and I'll
[1:32:33] Avenge the blood of
[1:32:36] jezel upon the house of jeu and will
[1:32:40] cause to seize the kingdom of the House
[1:32:42] of
[1:32:52] Israel
[1:33:02] he says for this I have given you four
[1:33:05] generations of the K but for this all
[1:33:09] indignation the authority of the
[1:33:11] ministry without wisdom I'm turning out
[1:33:15] your
[1:33:17] family so ministers can be pushed into
[1:33:20] holy
[1:33:22] r
[1:33:24] but we need to exercise the same measure
[1:33:27] of
[1:33:29] Grace which God has accorded for us
[1:33:34] also when he called them Rick and
[1:33:39] RI God told Brother BR I have my people
[1:33:44] in
[1:33:50] there we thank God for today
[1:33:54] look at theost of
[1:33:59] love in a holy
[1:34:06] R do you love
[1:34:08] him let's go to Luke
[1:34:12] Chapter John is the Apostle
[1:34:19] of chapter 9 verse 49 and
[1:34:26] and John answered and said
[1:34:32] Master we saw one casting out devils in
[1:34:36] thy
[1:34:39] name and we forid him because he follow
[1:34:45] not with
[1:34:48] us this man here is using the same
[1:34:52] anointing
[1:34:54] which we also use but this man here is
[1:34:58] not part of this church
[1:35:04] CL he does not belong to our camp
[1:35:09] generally he doesn't come to our
[1:35:12] meetings his spiritual ancestry is
[1:35:18] different John was not
[1:35:21] happy and verse 50
[1:35:25] Jesus said unto
[1:35:27] him forid him not for that not against
[1:35:33] us is with us and it came to pass when
[1:35:38] the time was
[1:35:40] come that he should be received up he
[1:35:44] steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:35:50] Jerusalem you
[1:35:52] see
[1:35:55] discipling
[1:35:58] job he now sets his
[1:36:01] face to go to Jerusalem to be
[1:36:07] offered verse
[1:36:09] 52 and sent Messengers before his
[1:36:14] face and they went and entered into
[1:36:18] Village of the
[1:36:22] Samaritans to make ready for
[1:36:26] him prepare
[1:36:28] yourself the master will be coming
[1:36:30] through here there will be signs wonders
[1:36:33] and miracles and you are going to see
[1:36:36] the real power not like that man
[1:36:42] there and now when they went
[1:36:46] there the people did not receive
[1:36:49] Christ because his face was set like he
[1:36:53] would go to
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:36:59] Jalem so verse
[1:37:02] 54 his
[1:37:04] disciples James which is
[1:37:08] Hope and John which
[1:37:11] was they saw
[1:37:15] this that man there he has a greater
[1:37:18] meeting than
[1:37:19] ours the people getting healed the
[1:37:23] master is here has
[1:37:26] nobody then they said Lord will thou
[1:37:30] command
[1:37:31] fire to come down from heaven and
[1:37:35] consume them as theas
[1:37:48] did so that was a righteous
[1:37:52] indignation from those
[1:37:55] disciples that represented
[1:37:58] hope and
[1:38:02] charity why do such denominations have
[1:38:05] more
[1:38:07] people success was being measured in
[1:38:13] numbers but
[1:38:15] success is faithfulness to the amount of
[1:38:18] talent that God has committed to
[1:38:22] you
[1:38:26] do your best if the talents were
[1:38:29] two don't stri for
[1:38:37] five two because at the end of the day
[1:38:42] it's only faithfulness which is
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:50] rewarded to remind
[1:38:52] ourselves
[1:38:54] the cream of the local
[1:39:02] church that Paul had was Ephesus it had
[1:39:07] 12 disciples 12
[1:39:11] believers they could not even make a
[1:39:13] church
[1:39:16] board no deacons and then trustees and
[1:39:19] then this they were not even enough why
[1:39:25] and Paul spent with
[1:39:28] them three years and it looked like it
[1:39:33] was AED
[1:39:38] Church 12 people today 12 people
[1:39:42] tomorrow but brother Bram says that's
[1:39:46] the Church of
[1:39:48] adoption hallelujah hallelujah you want
[1:39:51] to talk about an ad
[1:39:54] people you look at the Ephesian
[1:39:57] church only 12 people and looked like it
[1:40:01] was not
[1:40:03] growing God does not reward numbers God
[1:40:07] rewards faithfulness in
[1:40:11] the amen that's the lesson you John and
[1:40:16] James were being
[1:40:19] T Jesus just
[1:40:22] turned rebed
[1:40:25] them you don't know what man of spirit
[1:40:28] you
[1:40:31] have
[1:40:34] anger they were
[1:40:38] victims with a righteous
[1:40:42] indignation as
[1:40:43] Christians we must exercise
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:50] temp and temperance
[1:40:54] we can be able to
[1:40:56] forgive we can also be able to
[1:41:01] repent
[1:41:03] Temperance takes away your
[1:41:08] right
[1:41:10] Temperance is being toen
[1:41:14] down even when you are
[1:41:18] right that's why we need to sweeten our
[1:41:21] temper with prayer
[1:41:25] all the time whatever the people say
[1:41:28] they tread on your
[1:41:30] toes your temper with
[1:41:35] pray right or
[1:41:38] wrong be
[1:41:40] careful not to
[1:41:42] react with
[1:41:45] anger Jacob
[1:41:48] says
[1:41:49] Sim
[1:41:52] and
[1:41:54] they've got the same quality of
[1:41:58] Personality they are instruments of city
[1:42:02] in their
[1:42:05] habitation form of bitterness in the
[1:42:07] human
[1:42:09] Spirit they are Breen because they share
[1:42:14] the same emotion of
[1:42:19] anger and Jacob says in their anger they
[1:42:25] slew a man and in their self
[1:42:31] will they dig down a
[1:42:37] wall self
[1:42:39] will a no
[1:42:42] cause but handling it with
[1:42:47] excess God says
[1:42:49] no if I let these people stay together
[1:42:54] they'll either hurt
[1:42:57] everybody or they'll hurt
[1:43:05] themselves praise the Lord so they did
[1:43:08] not have
[1:43:10] time to think over their
[1:43:13] actions and Jacob
[1:43:16] says we will divide them in ja and
[1:43:19] scatter them in Israel because we are
[1:43:22] Temple
[1:43:24] all of a
[1:43:27] sudden God have mercy that we may train
[1:43:33] on how to handle
[1:43:36] temper their father says it's danger as
[1:43:39] keeping them
[1:43:41] together they very nice boys they like
[1:43:46] everything right on the
[1:43:50] dot that's
[1:43:52] why made
[1:43:54] L to take the
[1:44:00] priesthood he the man who could handle
[1:44:03] the
[1:44:04] law he was straight on the
[1:44:13] trigger praise the
[1:44:15] Lord

[1:44:52] attitude
[1:44:57] involved you say I will do
[1:45:00] this God doesn't like
[1:45:08] this praise the
[1:45:10] Lord Solomon
[1:45:12] said he that slaugh
[1:45:18] anger is better than the
[1:45:21] mighty
[1:45:23] and he that ruleth his
[1:45:26] Spirit greater than he that taketh the
[1:45:31] city he say

[1:48:05] hone I love
[1:48:10] you isn't that
[1:48:13] beautiful let us talk about
[1:48:17] Elish now in second Kings chapter
[1:48:21] 2 Elisha had just cross
[1:48:25] back from the Jordan freshly
[1:48:31] anointed in the man of
[1:48:35] el the first miracle he
[1:48:38] did
[1:48:40] amen he parted the
[1:48:43] waters when he says where is the Lord
[1:48:45] God of
[1:48:48] Elijah meaning that I don't take a
[1:48:51] man without power you don't take the
[1:48:55] Holy Spirit without the life
[1:48:59] behind are you together with me so he
[1:49:02] says where is the Lord God of
[1:49:06] elij through I'm baptized with the Holy
[1:49:10] Ghost the life that the Holy Ghost
[1:49:14] gives that should always be your
[1:49:16] question before you deal with the
[1:49:20] situation the second miracle
[1:49:23] he healed the
[1:49:25] waters but the third
[1:49:27] Miracle it was now the
[1:49:31] anger of the Prophet just coming over
[1:49:35] back like this he was in a new
[1:49:38] mantle he was trying to
[1:49:41] swell because that man was too big for
[1:49:45] him and so when he came back the
[1:49:49] children instead of saying look at the
[1:49:51] anointed of the Lord
[1:49:54] they were saying B head
[1:49:57] head head
[1:49:59] head they were not raised well child
[1:50:04] delcy I mean parental
[1:50:08] delen are you together with them you see
[1:50:12] sometimes this is caused by the
[1:50:15] families they sit down and they discuss
[1:50:19] a
[1:50:20] minister negatively in the presence of
[1:50:23] their
[1:50:24] children you are destroying
[1:50:29] them and that's what the parents were
[1:50:32] doing and when they came before
[1:50:35] Elisha they were
[1:50:37] negative they were just ridiculing him
[1:50:41] and they were following B head b bhe
[1:50:46] b how can such a minister bless
[1:50:51] you
[1:50:55] say Amen
[1:50:56] somehow that's good
[1:50:59] amen let's go to verse 23 of 2 Kings
[1:51:06] 2 and he went up from then unto
[1:51:11] bethl and as he was going up by the way
[1:51:15] there came forth little children out of
[1:51:18] the city and mocked him and said unto
[1:51:21] him go up thou B head go up thou B
[1:51:48] head you see they are talking to their
[1:51:51] pastor
[1:51:53] you see I have a
[1:51:58] boardhead go up
[1:52:01] boardhead
[1:52:03] go little
[1:52:05] children the next
[1:52:08] verse and he turned
[1:52:10] back and looked on them and cast them in
[1:52:15] the name of the
[1:52:17] Lord and they come forth two
[1:52:21] bears out of the
[1:52:23] wood and tear 42 children of
[1:52:33] them
[1:52:37] as
[1:52:38] ministers are endowed with a lot of
[1:52:41] divine
[1:52:44] Authority and they may sometimes mix it
[1:52:47] with their own
[1:52:51] Humanity and they do wrong
[1:52:55] judgment je mixed it with human
[1:53:00] Zeal but elishah mixed it with human
[1:53:06] anger don't this kids
[1:53:10] know that I am the Lord's
[1:53:13] anointed do they know that this is El's
[1:53:17] garment is now right upon me and don't
[1:53:21] they know I got even a double
[1:53:25] anointing they don't know that b head B
[1:53:29] head Bo head Bo
[1:53:33] head go up go up follow your
[1:53:38] master we don't need
[1:53:40] you go up go
[1:53:45] up we
[1:53:47] ministers should handle this
[1:53:51] authority of the Ministry with
[1:53:54] caution and the later
[1:53:57] also also give the ministry some
[1:54:05] space say Amen
[1:54:08] somebody
[1:54:10] anger andly
[1:54:15] indignation both of
[1:54:17] them is not
[1:54:20] God it's your human
[1:54:27] nature in Joshua chapter
[1:54:30] 3 and verse
[1:54:33] three I like the way the scripture here
[1:54:35] is
[1:54:38] written he
[1:54:40] says the people
[1:54:42] say they are now crossing the Jordan
[1:54:45] into the
[1:54:49] promise of the Covenant of the Lord your
[1:54:52] God
[1:55:01] then you shall remove from your
[1:55:09] place I like that
[1:55:12] scripture the scripture is not making
[1:55:15] the minister the
[1:55:19] subject but he speaking about the
[1:55:25] follow
[1:55:26] it is the AR of the
[1:55:29] Lord and not the
[1:55:32] priests yet there shall be a space
[1:55:35] between you and it not
[1:55:41] them by
[1:55:49] me that he may know Way by which you
[1:55:54] must
[1:55:57] go for you have not passed this way
[1:56:05] before not between you and
[1:56:09] them it is between you and
[1:56:14] the so that children that the bear
[1:56:18] at were not Tau how important it was
[1:56:23] to give the ministry some
[1:56:26] respect and they became victims of the
[1:56:36] prophets we need the balance right
[1:56:41] there listen to the words of the Prophet
[1:56:46] here he says you remember
[1:56:51] Elisha went
[1:56:54] baldheaded when he was young
[1:56:58] man some little children begin to
[1:57:03] sa bhead
[1:57:05] bhead why didn't you go up
[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:10] with that angered the prophet
[1:57:13] now turned
[1:57:16] around and he cast those
[1:57:19] children in the name of the Lord
[1:57:23] and two sheep Bears ran out of the
[1:57:27] woods and killed 4 to little innocent
[1:57:34] children that's not the nature of the
[1:57:37] Holy
[1:57:38] Spirit you know that but that
[1:57:42] was that Prophet that but that Prophet
[1:57:45] was
[1:57:49] angry that's why when I stand out
[1:57:54] here I always
[1:57:57] preach in love to
[1:58:00] you I allow the
[1:58:03] word to transform your
[1:58:06] lives not the
[1:58:08] force of my
[1:58:15] Ministry praise
[1:58:17] God so let us get to the families now
[1:58:25] anger you know families should create a
