him as an elder that I can go with him to Tanzania okay so uh so I'm I'm really looking forward for a good time and also I believe that the Lord has something in store for us this morning so wonderful to come come here as as traveling and moving yesterday evening we were passing we came from from uh from a meeting passing here and so it looks like sometimes the corners the areas it looks so familiar you know and so that's it that's nice if you come to a place where it's where it seems you feel home amen and really we are looking back for many many years of wonderful Fellowship together and I believe it's it was God ordained see I believe that God ordains things you cannot you will not meet every one of the Bride on Earth but the ones that you need to meet you will meet amen amen the rest we will meet on the other side but it's wonderful to see how God ordained things together that we can have a benefit from that amen and that we can be a blessing and a benefit to others I'm so grateful for that and I want to say again thank you for brother Stephen for having me yeah just uh you know uh uh allowing me and supporting and the things because we believe we are on our journey I believe we all believe that we are on our journey not only back into the mind of God because we come from the mind of God Amen Amina but we are not going back into the mind of God but we are going back as manifested God once in God's mind is now becoming manifested and we are going back to Eternity not the way we came from eternity we are going back to Eternity in a different way manifested attributes of God hallelujah going back has manifested attributes what a time that will be on the other side what a worship that will be when you see all those manifested attributes because God is many God is so great we cannot understand him too difficult for our brain to be to catch it so God is so great that he can create evil achieving for a good purpose [Applause] well he didn't create evil but he created Satan I have to understand knowing he would turn evil God is so great it's too great for us to understand amen amen and what a worship that will be on the other side all the attributes manifested attributes and then God according to the Bible will be all and in all amen amen finally the most difficult time of all times to reveal his final plan amen I mean God showed really now he can manifest things that he couldn't manifest years ago all things are possible amen well I I believe we believe this morning all things are possible amen amen make no limitation have no limitations if things look impossible there's nothing too hard [Applause] amen God bless you all yes we are looking forward for a good time together in going to uh there was a brother in our church from the from luanza for five years and that brother had a big burden on his heart he told me I'd like to see uh a little bit more of unity amongst the churches there so and uh so he he asked this time my brother Stephen was there before this time they will have a meeting where it looks like all the churches are joining together amen and I want to say praise the Lord for that yeah it's not the time anymore to do our own business it's we must be busy in the father's business amen not in our own business anymore there's nothing no great men amongst us is the only great man that is amongst us is Jesus Christ yes we are we are not here to vindicate ourselves we are not here indicating some some men but God is indicating his own words amen so we are so grateful to be a part of God bless you all not to keep you standing longer let's turn our Bibles and we want to go to the Genesis okay Genesis amen I mean trust the Lord has uh has his way I just told the church recently at home I just told the church at home it's depending on you the direction we are going I think I have this morning two or three different messages so and I just said to the Lord I because you are involved in it you are involved in the ministry amen amen so we just want to just just be aware you pull you Paul in what direction really we have to go I will just start DR Alika I will just start and we will see you where where the the need has been pulled into I believe I believe we are living in that time amen because you are a part of it I mean you are a part of that amen amen God wants you to be a part of that don't look just to the minister to do it he can only do yeah that's why the god the Holy Spirit told the prophet if you get the people to believe so the people are involved in it do you know you starve to death amen but if you just dare order then the waiter brings you order to the Cook everything the cook is preparing according to your order and then the wager is just coming around bringing you the food that you have ordered your to me sir and the great God the creator of Heaven Jesus Christ has prepared it amen God bless you Genesis the second chapter we want to go videos is the second chapter Genesis 2 we want to read two three verses Genesis 2. and as a as a little subject this morning I want to call our attention to after foreign [Music] [Music] the Jesus Christ is here we can Embrace him amen amen Genesis 2 21. to 24.9 and as we start reading straight away you pay attention to to uh principles that is laid out in the scripture this is how I like to read the scripture I want to see the principles that the scripture is giving us amen amen not just only Doctrine but principles and if you want to understand the principles you will see him moving amongst us and I want to go out from here today was that testimony that Jesus Christ yes crystal is alive amen amen Jesus Christ is alive yes like those who was on the way to Emos they came back that day and they could testify he is alive he is not dead we have seen him away amen Amina and the Lord got caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rip which the Lord God has taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones this is Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed amen amen amen amen now I I think you have you have you have uh recorded already this is the Lord doing and we understand this is not when man was in spirit form [Music] this is when man was in dust form [Music] amen I mean this is when man was in dust form amen that's very important for us to understand because we are here today and kind of a dust form right which it is we know our spirit man is a different kind or it is a different way so we are here this morning in kind of a dust form because when we die this goes back to the dust of the Earth [Music] foreign just a chapter further a very very uh known scripture Genesis 18 1 and 2. and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memra and he said in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked in low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground and he said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy side pass not away I pray thee from thy servantage and maybe the the if the Lord allows us I think I'm saying what we're gonna we will just turn finally this morning or this evening because Genesis 18 is actually our story this happened in our day amen and not Genesis but in time what happened here came God himself got himself coming to Abraham and now we have in our day God coming to the Royal Seed of Abraham that he came to Abraham in this hour his name was Branham [Music] amen Amina amen just to help us to understand it is what's happening now there to Abraham now what's happened to the Royal Seed of Abraham amen and this was Abraham and this is Branham foreign this was his first question he never talked to Abraham in that way he said where is so this second this visit was because of the Bride quietly so this visit is because of you let's pray together Heavenly Father we just enjoy so much you know that you allow us to see that we are a part of the Great unfolding we pray father take complete preeminence have your own way I pray just commit myself into your hands take my thoughts and everything under your control help me speak now you're the one that does the speaking and don't get it I just I Just Surrender myself completely have thine own way I pray bless thy people once again I ask you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen amen God bless you baby amen Amina so uh as we start reading and I like I said we want to talk about the time after Revival has begun and I believe this is a special season we understand this is the most deceptive season yes we see them everywhere like we were sitting this morning with brother Stephen and his wife in the hotel there were some religious program going a big big program off of I think it was Pentecost church and there's honestly the Bible would let us know that all would be deceived [Music] those names were not written deceived means you are in something without knowing it is wrong then you are deceived amen I mean amen amen and the whole world will be deceived this is what is written in the scripture that he will deceive Allah amen and we wonder sometimes how that will be and brother random told us we actually go back to the Garden of Eden he said if was deceived it was not Adam being deceived but if was deceived so she never thought it is wrong what she was doing that is what being deceived means people think what they're doing is absolutely right you know though they are worshiping and trying to serve God and being totally deceived this is what the in the state that the world is in today this is the state that the church is in today amen amen the church is total deceived that's why that's why when the prophet came he actually called a bride out of the church he said come out of here my people Revelation 18. Revelation 18. is taking place amen I mean the bride is called out of the church system amen Amina the brides will not be deceived as if was deceased because she is called out where to come to to Christ himself to unite with him amen that is taking place also next to the greatest the greatest uniting is taking place the marriage takes place on Earth brother Branham says amen amen then we are going to the marriage supper that we have in the sky Amen in the sky in another dimension but the marriage takes place here and we have seen the bridegroom coming down the son of man is the bridegroom um Matthew 25 tells us that example about the bridegroom the marriage finally it says Matthew 25 13. therefore watch because you don't know the hour that the son of man will come so the son of man is the bridegroom the revealing of the son of man in this hour did the son of man came back to Earth again amen he was Son of God through the church ages they went into the marriage there was a uniting taking place and there is a uniting taking place today the world is uniting foreign foreign [Music] just like I said if we have time enough it's not when I'm saying mother you know the foolish and the wise version so very interesting I just preached on that last week at home amen it seemed that only the foolish virgins their main subject was we need the Holy Ghost we need the spirit we need oil that was not the subject of the wise words amen amen it was not the subject the main purpose the main reason of being of the wise version because she had enough oil she was not looking for oil amen amen she was not charging for more of the spirit she had access to more of the spirits [Applause] the holy spirit is [Applause] I trust me can catch that is because you are apart of the original spirit Hallelujah amen so as we go along we can we can we can really see how and as we started here and then we want to see straight away from the beginning that it was the Lord that causing a deep sleep to fall upon Adams is that not amazing is it not amazing he was Adam now alone Yet the woman was inside of him he was complete together and it was not Adam Adam thinking about himself and he said well that's that's not nice I'm alone and I see all the animals they have they have a Partners it is not good that I am alone is what's God foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] God made man now hallelujah hallelujah amen amen in spirit form he told them multiply and replenish the Earth [Applause] and Adam would have asked back how can we being Spirit man foreign it's God's plan he never ask you you never asked me he asked nobody that's him can do whatever he wants God is sovereign [Music] he's sovereign [Applause] [Music] he said I believe the first thing that God created foreign [Applause] amen Amina you see how how the great the great Eternal Fountain of Life start to unveil start to show himself amen God is spirit amen amen God is spirit and he that they then worship it must worship Him in spirit and in truth [Applause] Hallelujah I mean isn't that wonderful is that amazing who created the world who created the universe and the Earth it's just a little spot amen amen so God created everything and then he decided to use the Earth as a place and he was brooding upon the Earth Spirit of God moved upon them his decision his decision not your decision his decision to do what he has done because God is sovereign [Music] he don't have to ask no one amen he can do whatever he wants he's sovereign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay it was God putting Adam to sleep you understand you understand it has nothing to do with Adam and I trust we understand today this is what is going on right now I hope you understand when I say that has nothing to do with the second answer it is sovereign God Katana using now the second Adam do you believe that the second Adam is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ all that God was all that God was he poured into Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ the second Adam yes [Music] is that right do what you did are we going back to Eden are we going back to Eden yes well we are coming back to all Adam lost Adam lost it Adam lost it Adam yes Christo the second Adam redeemed it back yeah died for us amen but watch behind it it's not just Adams behind it is stop I think that's so important today that we understand that and it's about to get it amen amen who's really behind it it was not okay the friendly loving Jesus begging for mercy begging for mercy to the great and Angry God amen amen amen amen because in this case you advocate your Advocate your okay is the judge no um and trust me if I jump into it I trust we catch it is [Applause] God the judge of all the Earth [Applause] [Music] the bride start understanding of knowing who he is and when they have the Revelation who he is then they understand who they are very simple one day the woman would have understood who she is one day the woman would have understood who she is that she was not just a part of Adam but she had to understand that she is a part of God amen so we understand behind all is the father it is God himself putting Adam to sleep it is God himself bringing up that subject it's not good that man is alone hallelujah it's what God calling for a father expression it was not Adam asking God [Music] it is [Applause] shall I send Malachi foreign hit that he never asked you do you want to do you need do you want Elijah so he never asked Adam do you want to have a wife you never asked Adam Adam do you want to have a Revival it's God is too great [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] amen but let's stand there for a few minutes I found it very so important and we understand this principle it is behind all it's not just Jesus Christ the lovely Jesus the Jesus of Nazareth amen amen behind Allah almighty God the judge of Heaven and the apricots became our judge it's Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] because if the holy spirit is moving he is a Holy Spirit like brother Brandon would say welcome back no doubt a spirit can move but if it is really the Holy Spirit if it is the holy spirit is he just moving upon flesh or is he moving upon Souls [Music] Ohio look in the Garden of Eden and really get that principle to your heart it is not what you want it is I want to repeat that he never ask you do you want to have Elijah the prophet do you want your hearts to be turned back he said behold God himself from [Applause] you're not just coming from Jesus Christ can you say Amen you come from God yeah and we are going back to God not to another person we are going back to God means amen amen we are not going to the Trinity person today but when we go back to God then God is complete [Music] amen amen but watch India watch today the church watch Adam allow me Adam Adam and his church was in him yeah okay got it is that right you get the picture now watch a holy spirit filled Church foreign foreign God is sovereign never because of the merits of the people God sends a river because he want to send the revenge it will never be the begging of the church it must be God himself and if we just become instruments in his hands then God can send the Revival cartoon as he wants if I pray for a Revival and God sends a Revival I'm the great person foreign [Music] let that really be anchored that we understand how deceptive today the Antichrist spirit is moving [Music] look the Antichrist spirits in the first church amen amen look how deceptive he was working suddenly one became a little bit more important than the other or only Church there the Holy Spirit died the prophet says two thousand years the Holy Spirit was bound in the church from Pentecost how quickly it started in the beginning the Holy Spirit was free he could do what he wanted it was not the people working it's the Holy Spirit [Applause] and church today we must be careful this is not the church working [Applause] it must be the Holy Spirit and Trust we have time enough you really need to go into it see how the first church fell okay what the deception that was amen what a deception it is okay amen but let's really go back to to Really sink that down it was the father looking a wife for his son um it was God's work I want to make sure that Adam Adam has nothing to do with that is two thousand years at Calvary yeah into a deep sleep energy [Music] it was not Jesus Christ yes yes Crystal taking the bride out of his eyes it was a Roman soldier it was even the enemy foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they they came to the Cross here the son had died Jesus in the Deep Sleep is that right yes like Adam in a deep sleep Jesus here Soldier came by if they wanted to kill him amen amen they wanted to break his legs they wanted to break his legs finally to to make him die okay they found out he was dead already what did they do they put a spear into himself what came out what came out [Applause] oh praise God what came out of his eyes water came out black came out get separated he said right yeah but nobody could see the bride came out life came out so God opened the sight of the second Adam had nothing to do with it it was not God sorry it was not the second Adam making a bride for himself making a bride for the second album taking a bride out of his eyes like he took a bride out of Adam [Music] what is God's plan what is God's plan so we understand we are his workmanship we are we are his workmanship welcome back we have the same father that Jesus Christ says can we say Amen to that [Applause] what a day brother said when I found out that I am not the son of Charles and Ella Branham but I am a son of God amen you're with me so it is the father let's let's stay there for a while because we want to let this thing down you know isn't it amazing God said to them in spirit form multiply and replenish of the Earth God put them and made them put is it okay when I say like this God put the spirit man into a testament yeah amen amen when he made man out of the Justice of the earth man was again his wife was in him amen amen amen amen so allow me to make that a little bit clearer so he just took in spirit man and put him into dust foreign foreign all the Saints on the other side they're in their Japanese right now is that right they will come back to earth that will of course to take up to pick up the glorified condition s is that correct take it over yes then they are completed trust we can see the picture what God is doing hallelujah amen amen and now man was in dust foreign but man was not alone his wife was in him like God as much as he was alone in the beginning he was not so alone as we feel alone is when we feel alone we feel nobody is with us amen amen but God being alone it's actually meaning you know alone means all-in-one mates [Applause] not the doormate that's why he's the wife it's not a doormate you understand what the door mate is where you come into the house and you put the dirt off so God made the woman to be a help mate oh get with me in the beginning what did the first woman had to do what should the first before the fall now God said I will make him and help me what should the woman help Adam with Adam oh well she should maybe wash his clothes foreign so God gives you a wife today if God gives you a wife it's not just that she wash your clothes angry that comes with it amen amen so God had something different in his mind yet we understand the fall came if you take it on your back way down there you can see the position of the woman today we understand that but we are going back Church to before the fall is that correct when we walk with him hey that's Max 20 and we are not ashamed why we are not ashamed because we are dressed because we are close into his righteousness because he died for us that's why the church is not afraid it's not a shame amen oh you see the plan but we are going back Church Calvary Calvary the price was so high no human being could pay okay it had to be the blood of God foreign is that correct amen amen now watch now where is it when he paid the price when he said at Calvary it is finished [Music] Redemption was complete you know what Redemption means to come back to redeem Oklahoma means to come out and to go in because Redemption means to come back come back to where okay to where it was before the fall foreign do you still believe in the power of the blood okay not the blood of the human to the blood of God can he paid the price he can make you clean white welcome to prefer as you are in the world is before the fall Hallelujah that's why we can walk today under the blood of Jesus Christ and we are not ashamed you're not ashamed we are not ashamed church we are not ashamed and we do mistakes we don't have to sit in the back of the church and feel ashamed said I'm not worthy I make so many mistakes one day I will be all right he that blood foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign so the the bleach it's so powerful it breaks up the ink oh nice and makes it bleach [Music] the blood of Jesus Christ is so powerful Hallelujah [Applause] it breaks up soon into in into its Basics the more bleach you finally have this is how powerful the blood of Jesus Christ foreign your brother say brother I have so many things do you believe in the power of the blood of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so you see where where we stopped from man in dust form now not in spirit forms but now man in dust form Hallelujah foreign [Music] being sick of being alone [Music] when God sends the Revival it will never be because the church is praying foreign amen amen nothing wrong in praying for Revival but don't tell God what to do amen amen because God is God amen amen let's turn to uh Matthew 22 quickly let's take a parable Matthew 22. we quickly have to get Matthew 22. amen amen I just love the world amen amen oh it's it's just wonderful Matthew 22. listen what Jesus answered and spake unto them by Parables and then to his disciples he explained those parables so don't don't be confused if God is speaking today through Parables but the holy spirit is unveiling those perils is that right don't never expect the Holy Spirit to speak plain in public [Music] amen amen now watch the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King foreign uh-huh uh-huh so it was never the sun making a marriage for himself you see the principle again like in Eden you're with me so it is a certain King making a marriage for his son Baba foreign [Music] and send forth his servants to call them that were bitten to the wedding and they would not come on to the wedding huh and they would not come I buy them a queen they rejected to be a part of the wedding this is the way it is today people are rejecting to be a part of the great wedding amen amen let's let's read a little further again he that is the Father the king send forth other servants saying tell them which bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen my feelings are killed and all things already come unto the marriage is it is the father I want you really to to acknowledge that this is you know this Chino has nothing to do with Jesus Christ you know that Jesus Christ who never gave you your inheritance Jesus Christ that's supposed to died and paid for your inheritance through Christ we are not Heirs of Christ we are joined as with Christ through Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah amen amen watch this Parable further unfolding send forth other servants okay first five but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm and the other two his merchandise you know why Christ is put outside the church is that condition you see suddenly Christ outside the church you know why they're outside you know why he's outside because the church is saying I am rich I have need of nothing so one is going to his merchandise one is going to his farm one is going through this one is going through that with other words they say no we don't come to the wedding we are too busy we have our own agenda we have our own programs we foreign it's a wedding for a wedding you need the sun one because it is not the wedding of the father of the Sun what do you need more for a wedding remember you need a bride [Music] find in this Parable where the pride is find where the sun is finding this Parable [Applause] finding this Parable the bride allow the Holy Spirit now put it in this Parable like Jesus would do to his disciples he went to them privately showing them that that Parable yeah you have the Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost allow the Holy Ghost to reveal to you this Parable where is the bride in this place I can see it I can see it I can choose the bride why we were reading I could see the bride already foreign let's quickly see what we have read okay we're six and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them [Music] what see people are invited to the wedding can you imagine can you imagine they are invited to come to the marriage who invites them the father the father Baba sends servants how is it not today that the father has again servants going around and waiting to the marriage Hallelujah inviting to the marriage I want to ask you if you are invited to the marriage are you invited as a guests I'm not invited as a guest s I found my position long time ago there um let's go read a little bit further but when the sun heard thereof yeah you're staggering is right the Bible said but when the king heard it not when the bridegroom heard it but when the father heard it he became so angry what [Applause] you don't want to be the bride tomorrow verse 8. or then said he to his servants it's still the Father the king speaking the wedding is ready Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I trust you get the picture what is going on verse 9. to the marriage if you come home in this Parable try to find the bride because she is there okay go ahead all right don't get it or stand those servants went out into the highways gather together as many as they found both for me beds so regardless how bad you are Hallelujah regardless [Applause] the blood of Jesus Christ makes you whiter um [Applause] foreign so there will be bad people in heaven because of the blood of Jesus Christ you see what's going on here can you see the bride they call good and bad regardless who you are if you have good good uh a good pastor a bad person make you whiter as snow so that you can be The Virtuous virtuous unadulterated foreign [Applause] [Music] is that right the bridegroom Jesus Christ the second Adam it's not inviting he's not inviting the second Adam stand at the door he is the door and he sees bad people coming do you want to be my bride [Applause] my righteousness [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh my God the question is do you want oh yeah you see today how churches will miss the Rapture they does how people miss the Rapture apparently that's what we have to go through the tribulation because they reject the full atonement brother random says that's why the foolish version has to go to the tribulation because they reject the atonement in its entire formula no I'm sorry we are too busy wait I'm going to my farm I'm going to my farm you know I'm I'm sorry I'm too busy I have too many things in my church we are helping the poor we're feeding the poor nothing wrong with that but don't let that hinder you coming to the marriage if he's inviting you there's no excuse me accept the invitation of the father I was asking myself the question what is behind that what is behind it is why it is the father Papa why not the son your race that this you know has nothing to do with you isn't that wonderful hallelujah hallelujah amen give you another one very famous for us you have heard about elieza right who knows a story about aliasa you all know the story about elieza by the way brother random what's the type of him looking for a bride it is but again amazing who sent elieza it was not Jesus saying I sent unto you Elijah the prophets it is [Music] it was not Isaac it was not Isaac it was in Isaac one day saying I need a wife it was not saying one day I need to express myself I need to express myself because never came the only man to reveal the son the Sun never came to reveal the Sun but the sun came later to reveal the father that's why Jesus said yes if you have seen me one of his disciples show us the father what did Jesus say yes [Music] and you don't know me [Music] let us give the hand the Lord the hand of praise even if you don't understand I love you Mary did not fully understand but her attitude but her attitude attitude what the angel says made the difference she said yes it be to me it'd be to me Mary said be to me it be to me okay Maria Maria is have just the right kind of attitude to what the angel is telling you know I'm not the angel I'm not the angel the pillar of fire is here Jesus Christ is here yes the father is here the spirit of God and was not the spirit of God the Father hallelujah hallelujah didn't know Jesus said yes there's not the Bible says that the spirit of God is the father of Jesus Christ okay you're still with me in the story one day elieza is commanded not from Isaac who commanded Abraham Ibrahim one day Abraham said hallelujah hallelujah one day Abraham said Abraham Ibrahim Isaac Jacob jacobo Joseph one day Abraham said he blamed he had an Isaac now amen amen is that right Abraham had an Isaac already Ibrahim so Abraham was not asking for a second Isaac amen amen because there was already one Isaac remember Isaac is not Christ is typing Christ in Christ dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily as we go along amen and so we try to keep it really sharp down together amen amen but again we see it as the father and the father makes sure you don't go anywhere else to find a bride for my son the brain behind it foreign [Applause] uh-uh why is he so concerned [Music] what kind of qualities this lady must have um he's telling you Abraham he's sorry he's telling you elieza God will send katanda his Angel before the angel of God yes go before you um is that right did Abraham say that take it no pressure to make sure yes you find the right wife [Music] is Papa so concerned about the right wife [Music] oh wow we understand Hallelujah my God is so concerned how far you know about this bride I will send you Elijah and he is the hearts of the children why is God so concerned Why is God so concerned about this Hallelujah why he did not allow right you're gonna I trust you to understand that why he did not allow for Jesus Christ yes please do to put a hand on it he put him to sleep you're with me hallelujah hallelujah I want I want really to make you excited I don't know why because if you want to know who is interested in you and why you have won already no the victory is yours regardless how many defeats you have nothing can defeat you if you know who you are Hallelujah remember how brother brought this simple example of the son of the king who was a prisoner in a foreign land he was eating slave food he was treated like a slave he was misused like a slave he was sold like a slave but because he knew who he was nothing could get him down nothing could depress him if depression comes your way tell the depression Who You Are [Music] the depression you can never depress me you can depress my body you can impress my mind you can depress my human Spirit but you can never depress me because I am a part of God I come from God and I go back [Applause] amen maybe we stay with us amen and then this evening we continue but you understand why was Abraham right he blamed more concerns about a bride then Isaac was Isaac in the picture Isaac is completely out of the picture we are chosen in Christ Honda [Applause] just we get the picture really clear what is the Mind behind you know what Abraham knew Isaac it's me in another form um and when he will have another son or another daughter Hindi because Isaac is my son is [Music] Jesus Christ yes crystal is God in another form and God is concerned wonderful to find a wife but Jesus Christ because God knows what comes out of that wife will be God in another form Ula can I close with this use the prophet we don't I don't have fuse many I just wanted to use so many statements of the prophet allow me the prophet because we are going back what had God in his mind when he made Adam the wife no he did not took another dust it took from that dust yeah it took from that dust yeah foreign the feminist part out called a rib easy can you say amen he took out from Adam Adam his female parts do you know that God is male and female you can go back to Genesis and God made man in his own image male and female created to him so if man is in his own image and God must be male and female cartoons foreign [Music] hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] allow me to say now let me quote the prophet um I Trust You Are really with me because we are going back to that we're going back to that back to before the fall dust form and before the fall the spirit man was in that dust man [Music] um just to make a little bit more plain foreign amen amen listen what brother was saying in the message does God change his mind about his words amen amen he said just like in the beginning is what it was not God's perfect will because for children to be born to the Earth through sex no sir God created Man Out of the Dust of the earth breathe is the breath of life into him and he became a living Soul he took from that man a held mate and made a wife unto him that was God that was God's first and original will okay wow wow that is God changing his mind about his words never sex was permitted because of the Fall the fall is Adam where I'm thou Adam when God called Adam where Adele Adam was there Adam God saw Adam is that right but still he said Adam and Adam said here this is not God's asking into another dimension hallelujah amen amen they want to read it again he took man from that man to help mate who made your life to him that was God's first and original will okay can we say Amen listen let's go a little bit further but when sin come in and did the thing it did then he permitted man to marry a wife and have children multiply and replenish the Earth that's the way you are going to do it but you see it never was his perfect [Music] okay go ahead guys therefore all these things that have been has to happen all the things that had the beginning all sin has to come to Annihilation all sin has to be done away therefore in the great Millennials the Resurrection comes we will not have to be reborn again but God like he did in the beginning and his help made with him that's right that's the way he did it [Music] isn't that wonderful that's how brother random could say allow me the quote said when God had Man made out of the Dust of the earth and his wife [Music] they they would have gone plump back to the millennium hmm amen amen you understand time was introduced because God because of time because of sin already there's a few attributes God can only express because he allowed him amen amen if they would not be sin God could never show he's a Healer HIV to have the chance to express himself but when that served its purpose when that served its purpose what's allowed for God to express things that he could not do without but yeah when that expression comes to an end then we go back to Eternity is continually expressing himself hallelujah hallelujah I can say what a mighty God we serve what a great God we say yes where's your victory Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah spoken word original seats quickly and closing allow me to read 19 page 69. this is uh spoken about original seats paragraph 79 in the second part okay but we will call it listen when God give a commission which cannot perish God's word is eternal it cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's Eternal purpose to carry that out you cannot die because it is his word you have to live foreign again wow now listen what is it here's a prophet maybe you maybe you find that quote it's a spoken word because it's nice to read it together but if not it's in the message spoken word original seats if that child speaking of the first child what was the first child that came forth I don't speak of Kane because Cain was of the evil one the first time that Adam brought forth Adam [Music] came the wrong way Abel came by sex I made it yeah can we say Amen together yes come on Church should have come right now not by sex since we understand why God allowed the fall right we know how Eve was deceived we don't have time to go into this now but like I said we want to dig down deep into it don't take it casual don't take it lightly don't just come to church don't just come to church to warm a seat don't just come to church to to uh to to just be there come to church sometimes to express then it is easy for you I'm going to stop doing wrong things [Music] okay let's let's read that's wonderful okay okay that's what we read okay multiplier replenish Earth that was God's Eternal purpose to carry that out you cannot die it's his word you have to live or we brought forth right but she couldn't wait ah yeah they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew the strength but that was where my money guy went she couldn't wait today's the church they cannot wait they want to produce it themselves they want to manifest Revival they want to produce the work of the Holy Ghost they want to manufacture the book of Acts if we had time we could go back to the first church to show the Antichrist Spirits doing exactly the same thing in the first church so good that brother Branham called it the Holy Ghost s that must be clear in the in the beginning brother Brandon said the white horse rider is the Holy Ghost it is the Antichrist spirit hallelujah hallelujah oh my my I trust you get it that's what's the matter today you want to see some kind of phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues instead of waiting for the real word of God to be manifested through the bride I trust I didn't lost you on the way because it's too good you know this will help you to understand the working of the Holy Ghost in your life day by day not just from move to move not just from Sunday to Sunday but it will help you to see the holy ghost in your life every day every minute every hour what see so the first son the first child was came forth wrong yes yes Adam Adam to come forth able to come first by sex Ibrahim um it was God's permissive will quality was Adam I was able the Son of God Son of son of Adam would be not a copy of Adam would be a further expression of God Hallelujah said well that was not a copy of Abel says says what a further expression Adam can we say Amen so you should not be a copy of no one it's a your life your life should be an extension your life is a further expression of Jesus Christ this is where we are at church what a Revival began in Eden foreign hallelujah hallelujah amen amen if that first child would be fought brought forth right whoever not by sex so how should the child come forth yeah how should they multiply and replenish with the Earth should the woman give birth foreign like we know birth no the prophet said the spoken word is the original seat you're with me he wasn't the woman he was the man he was the wife he was Adam he is a bride you know he is Christ behind all we are the father looking for a wife foreign [Music] if the first child would be brought forth right allow me to give my own this is what brother Andrew sings about it you don't have to take it what helped me to understand Adam was the brain Adam [Music] [Music] would have thought foreign would have spoken because a thought spoken yes hallelujah hallelujah amen Amina is it not today like this what's the bride today it is what shall I say is it right take it off so how do you write new how to write yamana she had to speak [Music] whatsoever you speak it's God's desire it's God behind it we want to be manifested what should I say you know what the prophet said I don't know [Music] Maybe you need money is that right this is what brother Rana was telling her maybe your sister is sitting here so don't tell me just say what the prophet said you get you get that yeah don't tell me just repeat what the prophet says she loves brother Brandon Hallelujah she was in his church she believed every word and yet she was not repeating what he was telling her yeah she was not of one of the Disciples of John um she had to be become a disciple of Jesus she was looking around waiting for the mind endosa Jesus Christ yes priest waiting all they that wait upon the Lord she was there waiting she said brother Brandon what shall I say he told you you can say this and you can try this and try this okay but he said I don't know I did the sister I am not the mind praise God brother he was a son of man revealing this son of man um brother Brandon was not the mind was waiting and what she was waiting on Adam Adam Jesus Christ yes Christ and she would not have said nothing she could wait on him regardless of the circumstances she could wait for the Holy Ghost and then she said she said I want Ninja the salvation of my two boys I know who that was that was not her intelligence that was the intelligence was Adam Jesus Christ Adam yes let the Mind look at those that was in Christ to be in you now God bless you let us turn to our feet we have to close up who is that statement brother Branham says if the first child would come forth the right way not by sex to acquire data but by the spoken words finally the woman would have brought forth Jesus Christ yes by the spoken word Church this is what the prophet said page page 21 he was deceit Jesus Christ yes please do that Eve should have produced do you get it congregation should bring forth but she hybrid foreign should come forth via the woman now that he fell this Eve cannot fall that is that's why this is predestinated foreign can you hear them this morning God is looking for you give me your life give me your life so that I can express myself this morning who wants to give his life all of your life renew it back to Jesus Christ for a week as I asked Chris too said God here I am use me manifest yourself and don't hold back don't hold back
