[18:13] tonight I pray that you intercede
[18:16] together with
[18:19] me as the spirit does the
[18:23] guidance amen amen so let's turn our
[18:27] Bibles and turn to the book of second
[18:30] Timothy
[18:34] 3 we are going to read verse
[18:42] verse this also that in the last days
[18:47] perious times shall come
[19:04] for men shall be lovers of their own
[19:07] selves
[19:09] cous bers proud
[19:13] blasphemers disobedient to parents unth
[19:17] thankful Unholy
[19:43] without natural affection truth Breakers
[19:47] false accusers incontinent Fierce
[19:51] despisers of those that are good
[20:14] traitors he High minded lovers of
[20:18] pleasure more than lovers of God
[20:30] having a form of godliness but the power
[20:33] thereof from such turn
[20:49] away for of this sort are they which
[20:52] creep into houses and Lead captive s
[20:55] women ladden with sins LED away with
[21:22] last ever learning and never able to
[21:25] come to the knowledge of the truth
[21:38] may the Lord bless his
[21:42] word amen amen so I want us to talk uh
[21:46] to to have a
[21:50] study we're not talking about
[21:55] times but my title shall be
[22:00] at our point of
[22:04] need at our point of
[22:07] need praise the Lord so we are simply
[22:10] taking a a simple text from this
[22:12] scripture of second
[22:18] Timothy says times shall
[22:23] come and when you look at the
[22:26] description of the perious times
[22:31] the Bible says these times will create a
[22:34] virtue of
[22:45] love in the hearts of
[22:47] men because shall come for men shall be
[22:51] LS of their own selves
[22:59] so they shall love themselves more than
[23:01] loving
[23:06] God so now we see a vacuum of
[23:12] love in the hearts of
[23:15] men says there shall be a
[23:18] vacuum because men shall move from Ling
[23:23] and serving
[23:28] and they shall take away that love for
[23:34] themselves and because they don't love
[23:37] God they now they now
[23:42] exposed to the evil
[23:45] spirits says they shall become
[23:50] highed
[23:54] bers
[23:56] Blasphemous disobedient to
[23:59] parents
[24:02] unth
[24:05] unappreciative
[24:07] Unholy not appreciating what they are
[24:10] and what they
[24:15] have and now the Bible says they shall
[24:18] have a form of
[24:22] godliness but yet they deny the power of
[24:25] God
[24:28] for the word of
[24:32] God and now at that
[24:35] time when Jesus was describing those
[24:40] times he says there shall be a spirit of
[24:47] deception why because the people have
[24:50] rejected
[24:51] God he gives them up to unclean
[24:56] spirits he exposes them up
[25:00] become
[25:02] highed praise the Lord they
[25:06] highed they
[25:09] bers they don't love
[25:12] God they love
[25:14] themselves and the things that hold dear
[25:17] to
[25:19] them and now Jesus said it will be such
[25:23] a horrible
[25:26] time because in that time
[25:29] there will be a false
[25:33] anointing false anointing upon the
[25:36] teachers of the
[25:41] word Jesus calls them false
[25:47] prophets says they shall come before the
[25:50] end
[25:52] time and they shall teach
[25:55] people the doctrines of men
[25:59] and not the word of
[26:02] God why because the people have rejected
[26:06] the word of
[26:09] God because the people think they are
[26:12] they have
[26:14] all they are
[26:17] enough so they don't love God they don't
[26:21] love his word they reject him and spw
[26:25] him
[26:26] away praise the Lord and now Jesus said
[26:30] because of that condition of the hearts
[26:32] of the
[26:34] people the people are now
[26:37] [Applause]
[26:38] exposed praise the Lord false
[26:42] teaching and now that false
[26:45] teaching creates
[26:47] AAP it creates a vume of
[26:52] love for the word of
[26:55] God praise the Lord now let us read here
[26:59] in Matthew
[27:03] 24: see what Jesus talks about says as a
[27:09] result as a
[27:12] result no just
[27:15] inter as a result people will have a
[27:20] thirst that isn't being
[27:23] lifted praise the Lord
[27:28] why because the truth has been turned
[27:30] away from
[27:32] them and they have been
[27:35] exposed to a false
[27:38] teaching and because there is a false
[27:42] teaching there is a life
[27:45] inside that shall
[27:48] thir for
[27:51] deliverance
[27:53] shall for the true manifestation of the
[27:56] word of God
[27:58] and it says and many false prophets
[28:00] shall AR shall rise and shall deceive
[28:05] many and because iniquity shall
[28:10] abound the love of many shall Works
[28:15] cold but he that shall endure the
[28:21] end the same shall be
[28:23] saved and then he says and this Gospel
[28:26] of the Kingdom shall be preached
[28:31] in all the world for
[28:34] witness All
[28:37] Nations and then the end shall
[28:41] come praise the Lord the end comes what
[28:45] brother is going
[28:47] through all their
[28:49] attention shall be to their personal
[28:54] satisfaction praise the Lord times of
[28:57] pray for one
[28:59] another the times of pray for one
[29:01] another Sor the times of
[29:05] praying as it was in the other
[29:09] church when the
[29:11] apostles when they prayed one for
[29:14] another when they checked on one
[29:17] another when they move from house to
[29:21] house in these various
[29:25] times that love grow the brothers
[29:31] together shall not be there because men
[29:36] shall only mind about
[29:39] themselves High
[29:41] minded and shall not end
[29:44] there but they shall have a form of
[29:48] godliness they profess to have a
[29:53] religion profess to have a form of
[29:56] godliness
[29:59] yet they deny the power of
[30:02] God deny the true word of
[30:06] God praise the Lord and now Jesus says
[30:10] that in that time there shall come false
[30:15] prophets with a false
[30:18] anointing and they shall receive so many
[30:23] people and then he says iniquity shall
[30:27] increase
[30:31] shall
[30:32] increase and Men shall be exposed to
[30:38] evil and because of
[30:41] that the love of
[30:44] many
[30:47] works praise the
[30:49] Lord and then he says but they so in the
[30:54] midst of all these perils
[30:59] in the midst of all this
[31:02] iniquity in the midst of all this
[31:06] Disobedience he says there shall be a
[31:09] people that shall endure Until the
[31:14] End praise the Lord but he that shall
[31:18] endure to the
[31:21] end the same shall be
[31:24] saved and now Zarah tells us
[31:28] praise the Lord that it shall be such a
[31:31] dark
[31:33] time it shall be
[31:36] darkened because of
[31:38] iniquity because of sin praise the Lord
[31:43] shall be such a dark
[31:46] hour but then the prophet Zarah tells
[31:50] us even in that
[31:53] day praise the Lord it shall be one day
[31:58] we shall be known unto the
[32:02] Lord praise the Lord that shall be known
[32:05] un the
[32:07] Lord zear
[32:11] 14: it shall be one
[32:14] day praise the Lord when the entire
[32:17] world when the Earth has been exposed to
[32:22] fithness When sin has covered theface of
[32:25] the Earth
[32:28] there is no good in the
[32:30] land when the people are
[32:33] evil and they not concerned about
[32:36] it praise the Lord when the evil spirits
[32:39] have taken
[32:41] over praise the Lord said there shall be
[32:45] one that shall endure all those
[32:48] situations Zarah tells us in that day
[32:53] there shall be one day that shall be
[32:55] known unto the Lord
[32:58] nor day nor
[33:00] night because it shall be a of
[33:04] confusion the Lord of
[33:08] Darkness not know whether shall be day
[33:10] or
[33:13] night but there is an
[33:16] assurance that there shall be a day that
[33:18] shall
[33:20] come says it shall come to
[33:23] pass there shall be an evening time
[33:27] evening time it shall be
[33:32] light praise the
[33:34] Lord because there has to be a
[33:38] people that must bear the light of the
[33:42] Lord people that must
[33:47] manifest the true word of
[33:50] God stand the test of
[33:53] time because Jesus said this goes for
[33:57] the
[33:59] kingdom shall out be
[34:02] preached even in the midst of gross
[34:04] darkness and
[34:09] Disobedience this gospel shall be
[34:13] preached in all the
[34:16] world for a
[34:18] witness unto all
[34:21] nations and then the shall come this
[34:25] various time shall come
[34:28] they are not the end of
[34:31] life not the end of the world and Jesus
[34:35] said yes you shall hear them
[34:38] say here is the prophet here is the
[34:42] Christ says don't go after
[34:46] them praise the Lord
[34:49] says gospel which we have
[34:53] believed this gospel which we preach
[34:58] this gospel which is Christ
[35:01] himself he says in the midst of all that
[35:04] is going to happen it must be
[35:10] preached to All
[35:12] Nations for a
[35:14] witness and that gospel which Jesus
[35:18] speaks about is that evening
[35:21] light Zar speaks
[35:24] about in that day in that hour
[35:28] which is not nor
[35:31] night a wave of
[35:34] confusion then he says there shall
[35:38] emerge a
[35:40] light
[35:42] evening is going to come at a
[35:45] time when people are
[35:48] we evening
[35:51] time shall be an evening
[35:54] time the evening people have been
[35:57] working all day
[36:00] long people are
[36:02] tired they have been tossed by the cares
[36:05] of the
[36:07] world they have been tossed by all kinds
[36:10] of wild
[36:13] doctrines and they have a
[36:16] thirst they thirsting to go back home
[36:19] and have a
[36:22] rest praise the Lord they working here
[36:25] and there
[36:28] here is the
[36:29] Christ and they run over the
[36:31] group here is the Christ and they run
[36:35] over and when they they reach there they
[36:39] don't find a thing that shall satisfy
[36:41] their
[36:43] soul they come out and then they he here
[36:47] is another
[36:49] Christ then they run over them and they
[36:52] reach there they don't find him so they
[36:55] are moving here and there
[36:58] and they now very exhausted and very
[37:01] [Applause]
[37:03] tired until some have lost
[37:08] hope praise the Lord many have lost
[37:11] trust in the
[37:15] word the prophet
[37:17] says at that particular

[50:32] life it's a part of our
[50:36] experiences also got
[50:39] perplexed also
[50:43] got in his
[50:45] work the Lord and then he could come to
[50:48] a
[50:49] point and says but I am a good man I'm a
[50:55] servant of God
[50:57] I always
[50:59] strive to do
[51:01] that which is Pleasant unto my
[51:06] master but why every time I think of

[51:18] why praise the Lord also get moments of
[51:24] desperation also get
[51:27] time could come when also reached those

[51:34] desperation those moments of
[51:39] misery moments of tension in his
[51:43] life and he cry out to
[51:46] God praise the Lord but the Bible tells
[51:50] us at such a
[51:52] Time the spirit spoke unto him

[52:39] beinged of total
[52:43] surrender knowing that it's noer you
[52:46] that
[52:48] live knowing that it's no longer your
[52:50] ability to
[52:54] overcome it's not your ability
[52:58] about situation in
[53:01] life but you stand
[53:03] still know that
[53:06] he that is in you is greater than he
[53:11] that is in the
[53:12] world that's when he says you have
[53:15] noticed it my
[53:17] child now my grace is ever sufficient
[53:22] for

[54:32] fast and the healing of the soul is
[54:34] always
[54:36] F while the people are looking for the
[54:39] healing of their
[54:42] bodies let the healing of our souls be
[54:47] F when a man is Born

[56:35] cost them some
[56:38] Hogs it would cost them some Hogs if

[56:48] land and he always goes away when he's
[56:51] not
[56:54] wanted yes sir
[56:57] because they don't
[56:59] believe because of their
[57:02] iniquity he exposes them
[57:05] up to evil spirits and the prophet says
[57:09] here when they don't show that
[57:14] they
[57:17] turns
[57:19] Andes to his own
[57:21] country God speaks considerably
[57:26] and every word has Eternal
[57:31] meaning every word that proceeds out of

[58:40] you when Jesus was on
[58:43] Earth he was
[58:46] all of the godhead
[58:49] Bly he was
[58:51] God tabernacling in flesh in the
[58:58] Jesus was just not a
[59:02] prophet he was
[59:04] God and he if he was
[59:08] able
[59:12] to
[59:15] himself body of
[59:18] Jesus etal great
[59:22] God if he left the throne
[59:26] and he came of
[59:29] man for the purpose of reconciling us to
[59:36] himself how much
[59:38] more will he
[59:41] do praise the Lord when we come to a
[59:44] point of
[59:45] need when we need his
[59:49] intervention praise the Lord he still
[59:52] keeps his
[59:53] words and the prophet says he will cross
[59:58] over to come to our point of
[1:00:03] need he keeps his
[1:00:06] promises and let us look at the Widow
[1:00:09] and
[1:00:11] elah praise the Lord God has a need to
[1:00:17] meet he does everything
[1:00:21] possible anything

[1:00:26] praise the Lord when you have a
[1:00:29] need your need touches
[1:00:33] God touches
[1:00:35] God when he left the
[1:00:38] throne he came down and became one of us
[1:00:43] when he became one of us he overcame
[1:00:47] death after he overcame
[1:00:49] death he went back and now he
[1:00:53] returned as our high priest
[1:00:57] that is
[1:00:59] touched by every feeling that we
[1:01:02] have that is touched by each one of our
[1:01:07] situation and he is ready to do
[1:01:12] anything for the sake of his
[1:01:16] body the sake of his body to prove his
[1:01:20] word that he is our high
[1:01:23] priest that is touched by the feeling
[1:01:27] in so now here is the
[1:01:30] Widow there was the Widow who had the
[1:01:34] son and now in that time praise the Lord
[1:01:39] God had closed the
[1:01:42] heavens and there was no
[1:01:44] rain and now God sent
[1:01:47] Elijah to go to the
[1:01:50] Brooks that was
[1:01:53] before praise the Lord a river that was
[1:01:56] flowing with there was some kind of was
[1:01:58] flowing with
[1:02:00] water or a
[1:02:03] something and now the land had become
[1:02:09] dry it was dry because God had closed
[1:02:13] the
[1:02:15] heavens that there would be no
[1:02:17] rain and now when Elijah was
[1:02:20] there God sent r
[1:02:27] and also water from
[1:02:31] the for his thirst but now time came the
[1:02:36] brook also
[1:02:38] dried praise the Lord and when it
[1:02:41] dried God never spoke the
[1:02:46] brook to bring
[1:02:48] water praise the Lord Remember When the
[1:02:52] Children of Israel were traversing the
[1:02:54] wilderness
[1:02:57] they became
[1:02:59] thirsty and the land was dry there was
[1:03:01] no
[1:03:03] water God spoke to
[1:03:05] Moses the spoken
[1:03:08] word asked him to strike the
[1:03:12] rock to bring out water God had the same
[1:03:17] ability to speak to
[1:03:21] Elijah do something
[1:03:26] so it would bring
[1:03:27] water praise the Lord never did it and
[1:03:32] got to a point of
[1:03:35] need he became
[1:03:38] thirsty and he wanted to
[1:03:41] drink what did God tell him he never
[1:03:44] told him to
[1:03:45] speak elah was waiting upon the
[1:03:49] Lord he was Believing on
[1:03:52] God on every step of his life
[1:03:56] he had
[1:03:58] surrendered it was no longer him that
[1:04:00] was
[1:04:02] living but was living after the life of
[1:04:07] God why
[1:04:10] says this time of
[1:04:12] life it it has to be God
[1:04:17] himself it should be no longer I
[1:04:21] anymore but Christ because if it is I
[1:04:26] I will fail at the test of
[1:04:30] time is Christ he overcame
[1:04:34] already and because he
[1:04:37] overcame I will also
[1:04:39] overcome so now I have to surrender
[1:04:42] myself
[1:04:43] out and allow Christ
[1:04:47] himself to live in
[1:04:50] me now elah never questioned
[1:04:54] God but God
[1:04:56] you instructed the
[1:04:59] Ravens and they bring me
[1:05:02] food praise the Lord in the morning and
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:05] evening you can still instruct
[1:05:08] them to bring me
[1:05:11] water no he never did that he told him
[1:05:15] go
[1:05:16] over praise the Lord and say there is a
[1:05:22] widow God had planned something
[1:05:26] now God wanted to satisfy the thirst of
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:33] Elijah that was his
[1:05:35] need but at the same time the wi the
[1:05:39] other
[1:05:40] side also had a
[1:05:43] need and she was waiting upon the
[1:05:46] Lord maybe she had
[1:05:49] prayed maybe she had
[1:05:51] fasted and it was not raining
[1:05:56] and now she in the
[1:05:59] land now God asks
[1:06:07] Elijah came to
[1:06:09] pass and it came to pass after a while
[1:06:12] that the brook dried up because there
[1:06:15] had not there had been no rain in the
[1:06:18] land
[1:06:34] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[1:06:39] saying that's
[1:06:41] El arise get thee to
[1:06:45] Zer which belong to zidon and dwell
[1:06:49] there behold I have commanded a widow
[1:06:51] woman there to sustain thee
[1:07:07] was a
[1:07:08] Believer a
[1:07:12] faithful he believed that God would have
[1:07:14] the
[1:07:15] ability to do something for him when he
[1:07:17] was
[1:07:18] there but he never questioned
[1:07:21] God he listened and obeyed to the voice
[1:07:25] of the Lord
[1:07:29] and that made the
[1:07:33] difference that makes the
[1:07:36] difference we
[1:07:37] believe and take
[1:07:40] God
[1:07:42] his God
[1:07:44] knows that we have a need in our
[1:07:48] life God knows that we have a weakness
[1:07:52] in our lives
[1:07:56] but let us take God at his
[1:07:59] word let us obey what the word says
[1:08:02] about our
[1:08:08] situation
[1:08:12] and that God come to our
[1:08:17] Rescue of
[1:08:20] need and
[1:08:22] notice the WID say prepared the Widow to
[1:08:26] sustain
[1:08:29] thee but the Widow who God has
[1:08:33] prepared only one meal
[1:08:38] left and she was going to
[1:08:40] die that was her last
[1:08:43] hope she had prayed and she had given
