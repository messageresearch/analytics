[1:09:55] in 1 Timothy chapter 2:9 in like manner
[1:09:58] also that women Adorn themselves in

[1:12:27] it he said that this was so big
[1:12:31] here that one is good for old
[1:12:34] people the name
[1:12:38] of saying that dressing with which
[1:12:48] are you need to find out if I'm dressed
[1:12:51] this way and then I witness to somebody
[1:12:54] that get saved will the person really
[1:12:56] say truly I'm saying the right
[1:12:59] thing the second
[1:13:04] verse in Romans chapter
[1:13:07] 12 it was telling us
[1:13:29] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:13:32] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:13:35] mind that you may prove that which is
[1:13:37] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:13:39] God hallelujah
[1:13:45] amen whenever you prepare your
[1:13:50] body you are actually kind of calling
[1:13:54] upon the ghost to come upon
[1:13:59] you and when you know you determine
[1:14:01] yourself that you are
[1:14:04] saved you are inv to come into your
[1:14:11] life so now if you allow your
[1:14:16] body for if you have been putting on
[1:14:22] a you start now putting your body as
[1:14:25] sacrifice before God praise the name of
[1:14:28] our
[1:14:32] Lord when you live putting on trousers
[1:14:35] when you a
[1:14:37] woman and then you see other women
[1:14:39] putting on trousers
[1:14:42] and and then for you give that
[1:14:46] up giving your body as a Living
[1:14:49] Sacrifice before
[1:14:51] God praise the name of our Lord
[1:14:56] the moment you start being
[1:15:02] ashamed there's a message I was reading
[1:15:04] by
[1:15:07] Brother asking that is your life worth
[1:15:09] of
[1:15:11] the was asking is your life worth of the
[1:15:20] Gospel then he said you move maybe past
[1:15:23] three blocks of houses
[1:15:27] if you not find women who are
[1:15:29] naked you'll come and tell
[1:15:35] me and then he said people have become
[1:15:40] mad if somebody you know doesn't have
[1:15:43] any
[1:15:45] shame becomes
[1:15:48] a if somebody
[1:15:52] undresses when if somebody
[1:15:57] if somebody starts putting on a night
[1:15:59] dress and goes to the
[1:16:02] town if somebody has put on a
[1:16:08] me that person has an evil
[1:16:13] spirit now that evil spirit is the
[1:16:20] madness somebody a woman buying a TR
[1:16:23] knowing that for men
[1:16:26] that person is already
[1:16:29] mad and there something
[1:16:32] compar and I found it
[1:16:36] was and he says many people see mad
[1:16:38] people eating from
[1:16:40] rubbish and they think those are the
[1:16:43] only but then there are mad people in
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:46] church and they are just mad
[1:16:54] get a good cloth and then they
[1:16:57] go that one is
[1:17:00] mise the name
[1:17:06] of when I read that message I said this
[1:17:09] is a
[1:17:11] great so I brought it to
[1:17:15] Romans don't be like the generations
[1:17:19] of because the time we are
[1:17:21] in the generation is spoiled
[1:17:26] the living
[1:17:28] in every person wants
[1:17:31] follow but if you follow the Fashions Of
[1:17:33] The
[1:17:34] World God can never be in such
[1:17:39] a he say we should not be confounded to
[1:17:42] this
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:45] world but let us be transformed renewing
[1:17:48] our
[1:17:51] mind that's how we shall serve the Lord
[1:17:56] to be the
[1:17:58] truth and then we shall see that it's
[1:18:01] pleasing praise the name
[1:18:04] of whenever
[1:18:06] you whenever you behave
[1:18:11] well you can even tell somebody th says
[1:18:14] the
[1:18:15] Lord in that
[1:18:18] message is your life worth of the
[1:18:21] go and then he said that even men
[1:18:26] they have also started becoming
[1:18:29] mad you find a
[1:18:31] man just
[1:18:36] direly
[1:18:39] doesn't then he says isn't that person
[1:18:42] mad you
[1:18:45] know there are three
[1:18:48] things there is being in the
[1:18:51] village and then there's also being in
[1:18:53] the and then is also being in
[1:18:57] your but all those
[1:18:59] things though they
[1:19:02] exist you don't requ those things to be
[1:19:05] in
[1:19:06] you when you in the
[1:19:08] village you don't need the
[1:19:15] village when Village don't allow the
[1:19:18] village to be new but that that one
[1:19:20] cannot refuse from being in the
[1:19:22] village if you are in the town
[1:19:26] you in
[1:19:27] town but don't allow the town to
[1:19:31] influence because there are many evil
[1:19:33] things done in the
[1:19:36] town so if you going to know everything
[1:19:38] which is in
[1:19:40] town you are ending up when you're not
[1:19:42] born again or
[1:19:45] saved we are in this
[1:19:49] age but you don't need this age to be in
[1:19:53] you but yet living in this
[1:19:56] age because this is the age you are
[1:19:58] preaching in the gospel we in
[1:20:02] the but we shouldn't allow the influence
[1:20:04] of this
[1:20:05] age praise the name of our
[1:20:09] Lord then he said that for
[1:20:12] men they have started becoming
[1:20:15] mad they have started you know become
[1:20:18] you know bleaching
[1:20:20] themselves and then you find him maybe
[1:20:22] the way he has worked in the and then he
[1:20:25] stays at
[1:20:26] home and then stays
[1:20:29] there he doesn't wash
[1:20:32] his but again demanding food from the
[1:20:35] wife praise the name of our
[1:20:39] Lord now when you get that one on the
[1:20:43] way between a mad person and this and
[1:20:47] this one who
[1:20:49] says because a mad person is always dir
[1:20:52] and you also dirty
[1:20:57] now who how will differentiate between
[1:20:59] the right the person who is sober and
[1:21:01] one who is
[1:21:03] M whenever I read the
[1:21:05] message I always ra
[1:21:09] my that even
[1:21:12] this a man be
[1:21:15] clean especially man who has
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:18] beli because you're the one with the
[1:21:21] true how would you say thus says the
[1:21:23] Lord
[1:21:25] when you are
[1:21:28] dirty your sht is
[1:21:31] dirty your
[1:21:34] shoes and maybe sometimes you're
[1:21:37] not there even those who get names in
[1:21:40] the
[1:21:41] village that the shirt is always dir so
[1:21:44] they just call them dirty
[1:21:48] person when the people have given you a
[1:21:50] bad name in the
[1:21:52] vage even the Bible says
[1:21:57] don't be like
[1:22:01] confounded but be
[1:22:04] renewed praise the name of our
[1:22:09] Lord this verse did me a lot when I
[1:22:12] understood
[1:22:15] it and then I started witnessing the
[1:22:19] gospel because when I knew
[1:22:22] it and I knew I'm not of
[1:22:27] this as I'm in this world I'm not of
[1:22:29] this
[1:22:32] world so my knowledge has to be
[1:22:35] changed the which was thinking of other
[1:22:40] things let it go away that I may get the
[1:22:43] true
[1:22:45] knowledge the things that are pleasing
[1:22:47] to God you may be
[1:22:50] there and everything you
[1:22:52] doing there is nothing
[1:22:56] and there is nothing
[1:22:58] whiches but you may think that you are
[1:23:01] correct praise the name of our
[1:23:06] Lord but whenever you get you know the
[1:23:09] knowledge your mind be
[1:23:13] renewed that's where God can reveal
[1:23:16] himself hallelujah praise the name of
[1:23:19] because
[1:23:24] like somebody is going to
[1:23:27] marry reveals himself to the wife even
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:32] wife reveals to the husband praise the
[1:23:36] name of our
[1:23:37] Lord now that one put it in
[1:23:39] the but now when we go to the
[1:23:43] spiritual Christ is our
[1:23:46] husband now Christ is our
[1:23:49] groom your husband has to reveal
[1:23:53] himself and then you get to know him
[1:23:56] well even you as a
[1:23:58] wife you must reveal yourself to your
[1:24:01] husband for your husband to know
[1:24:06] you so Christ reveals himself to the one
[1:24:09] who is ready to be revealed
[1:24:12] to so Christ will be revealed to
[1:24:16] you you must change your
[1:24:21] mind you must depart away from the
[1:24:23] things of the
[1:24:26] world I always get surprised
[1:24:31] in God has always been helping
[1:24:36] us I've always been teaching it while
[1:24:39] praying to the
[1:24:41] Lord you find a
[1:24:43] man you find
[1:24:45] a you find
[1:24:47] a you find even a
[1:24:51] woman they have the thinking
[1:24:54] a lot of
[1:24:56] thinking they have a lot of thinking but
[1:24:59] more than what they think about God for
[1:25:03] example we have
[1:25:08] youth can have a football team
[1:25:14] supports can tell you the first SC SC
[1:25:17] the first goal
[1:25:19] inal the first goal
[1:25:22] Aral can even take tell you that
[1:25:29] hisory but when you ask them tell me
[1:25:32] where did preaching
[1:25:34] theel and you can that person
[1:25:37] the and they don't know it praise the
[1:25:40] name of Lord hallelujah
[1:25:43] amen but then he goes and sits in
[1:25:49] the can even know the the price of each
[1:25:53] player the they going to play and all
[1:25:55] the things about the
[1:25:59] football so you find such a person with
[1:26:01] all the know the
[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:14] world but when you ask him just about
[1:26:17] eight verses in the scriptures tell you
[1:26:19] what they mean he doesn't know
[1:26:21] anything praise the name of our Lord
[1:26:26] but he knows all the things of the
[1:26:29] world somebody can Nar you a
[1:26:32] bus how the business canate Mone and how
[1:26:36] the business you
[1:26:37] can all that is in
[1:26:40] his and can even do Accounting in your
[1:26:43] business but when you tell
[1:26:46] them okay
[1:26:48] you tell me about the Bible from Genesis
[1:26:52] Revelation tell me more about the
[1:26:55] how many books are there in the Bible I
[1:26:58] say that one is for the
[1:27:00] pastor praise
[1:27:04] the but he knows how to calculate
[1:27:06] profits and losses in his
[1:27:10] business and then you can get a woman in
[1:27:13] a
[1:27:13] village when for the songs all the the
[1:27:18] world the songs of the
[1:27:20] world when she's maybe
[1:27:22] sorrowful start singing
[1:27:24] those and then tries to count
[1:27:28] them and he tell them sing for me five
[1:27:31] songs when you have not looked in the
[1:27:36] book and say that that to
[1:27:39] sing but other songs which are of the
[1:27:42] world they can sing but for the gospel
[1:27:43] they can't sing praise the name
[1:27:47] of I always tell the
[1:27:51] church I tell them let us learn the
[1:27:53] songs
[1:27:56] when all the songs are in your heart or
[1:27:58] in
[1:28:00] your it's not that going to going to
[1:28:03] move with
[1:28:05] the going to
[1:28:09] your most of those mothers don't
[1:28:16] have so if you don't know the songs how
[1:28:19] are you going to sing the song which can
[1:28:21] help you in
[1:28:22] need now when when I get into the
[1:28:28] message we first desire the message
[1:28:35] songs come with my wife
[1:28:38] here and then he said how can we learn
[1:28:41] those
[1:28:42] songs then I do you want those songs she
[1:28:46] said she wanted these songs of the
[1:28:48] goel then I told her you take them in
[1:28:50] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:54] we never had any song
[1:28:55] book not
[1:29:04] Engish we have many language we have
[1:29:07] many tribes there so there are many
[1:29:19] songs so they have multiple tribes and
[1:29:22] people have learned songs in their
[1:29:23] tribes
[1:29:27] but one thing which excit me the message
[1:29:30] songs The Voice is the
[1:29:33] same if you are
[1:29:36] singing and then when he singing
[1:29:39] [Music]

[1:29:54] the words may be different but the rythm
[1:29:55] is the same praise the name of our
[1:30:00] Lord and then my wife said I want those

[1:30:46] sent us the the voice
[1:30:49] audio and we learned that
[1:30:52] song and we enjoyed that
[1:30:56] song we borrowed a song book from a
[1:31:01] brother for three
[1:31:05] days I told my children don't go to
[1:31:07] class but spend time writing these
[1:31:10] songs we bought the
[1:31:13] books and they started writing those
[1:31:15] books in their
[1:31:17] notebooks when they finished writing the
[1:31:19] books the
[1:31:21] songs now we needed to know how these
[1:31:24] songs are
[1:31:26] Su but we are happy we got those songs

[1:31:36] having their books led by
[1:31:41] themselves when they were going to
[1:31:43] church and it was raining they would
[1:31:44] rather leave the books inad of the book
[1:31:46] being spoed by
[1:31:48] rain so God helped us
[1:31:54] there is a pastor called Pastor M
[1:31:59] there so I told him help us with one
[1:32:02] person from your
[1:32:04] church that he can come to our church
[1:32:06] and teach

[1:39:55] generation praise the
[1:40:01] name so I pray for the sister that God
[1:40:03] Contin reveals to his
[1:40:09] grace when the Bible says that the woman
[1:40:12] should not put on what pertains to a man
[1:40:14] and a man put on what pertains to a
[1:40:18] woman the B
[1:40:20] say such
[1:40:26] but now some some people have changed
[1:40:29] the way they
[1:40:31] dress they go and buy a
[1:40:35] trouser and then gets also a long
[1:40:41] dress so he says the the trous is inside
[1:40:44] and then the dress on
[1:40:47] top not knowing that still she has put
[1:40:50] on a trous
[1:40:54] so anything that's long like maybe like
[1:40:57] you know
[1:41:00] trouser that one is a
[1:41:03] TR and now it pertains to a
[1:41:06] man when I got the
[1:41:10] message you know I tried it on my little
[1:41:14] children and then I brought a
[1:41:21] p trying to prove this pants they put on
[1:41:24] a day for the men or for the
[1:41:28] women so he got a book and Drew
[1:41:32] the I put you know the stretched

[1:42:03] trouser and then asked him who put on
[1:42:05] this
[1:42:06] trouser then he said it's
[1:42:09] men then ask what is
[1:42:12] this this is a
[1:42:14] dress who put on the dress says it's
[1:42:21] women and then now I this is
[1:42:27] now then now a woman says that the leing
[1:42:30] or the PS are for
[1:42:33] women the Bible

[1:44:02] body and then you go and do what the
[1:44:05] body the spirit
[1:44:06] wants praise the name of our Lord huah
[1:44:13] Amen Let me give you my testimony
[1:44:23] from the time I was given birth to up to
[1:44:28] now it can also help
[1:44:32] you it can help one
[1:44:43] another he was born on 12th April 1978
[1:45:00] ande and then the father called
[1:45:06] Francis but the I was
[1:45:18] born you know it was more
[1:45:21] like pick play or something which
[1:45:27] was my mother was 14
[1:45:30] years mostly 14
[1:45:33] years and then the father was 15
[1:45:37] years mother was in
[1:45:43] p and then the father was learning how
[1:45:45] to
[1:45:47] S and then saw the mother
[1:45:50] conceived and then he was given birth to
[1:45:55] so to know my
[1:45:59] father he knew the father after 14
[1:46:03] years praise the name of our
[1:46:08] Lord so I didn't know all that Mom going
[1:46:11] to and then married in another
[1:46:14] place so I was raised like
[1:46:17] that then I came back to the
[1:46:21] grandparents so I was there
[1:46:26] so going to school was a challenging
[1:46:30] thing but God raised me
[1:46:35] up because my mom was married to person
[1:46:38] who was
[1:46:41] drinking and then one day I
[1:46:47] got you know MOS was a painful
[1:46:51] dise children become
[1:46:54] blind and dump then the mother
[1:46:58] said and say that it was almost like
[1:47:00] that when I got
[1:47:05] sick so the father-in-law called
[1:47:09] her and then he says the son has
[1:47:12] died so they started
[1:47:18] weeping but he had given the father
[1:47:20] money to buy medicine
[1:47:26] you know there was things which happened
[1:47:27] during those
[1:47:32] days and you know like when they bury
[1:47:34] somebody they would spend a lot of days
[1:47:36] there and so the father was at the
[1:47:39] funeral so they picked him that your son
[1:47:43] has and even he had used the
[1:47:47] money so about
[1:47:54] for about 3
[1:48:00] hours so after 3 hours they found that
[1:48:03] there was some kind of pation in the
[1:48:06] body and then then I was able
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:12] to so they tell me that I was about six
[1:48:14] years when that
[1:48:16] happened so when when actually I was
[1:48:19] awakened
[1:48:20] up and then I became fully healed
[1:48:28] so I've never been to the hospital
[1:48:30] because of that kind of
[1:48:32] sickness but I see people fall
[1:48:36] sick we have been seeing people going
[1:48:39] hospitals and even some have
[1:48:45] died so when I raised up I thank God for
[1:48:50] protecting but I don't know why God had
[1:48:52] to make me you know be delivered from
[1:48:57] Death so now I was raised by my
[1:49:08] mother so I started demanding my mother
[1:49:11] where is my
[1:49:13] father then she told me just keep
[1:49:16] quiet then I went to my
[1:49:19] grandparents my grandparent
[1:49:25] then I asked my grandparent where is my
[1:49:28] father then they showed me my father
[1:49:31] when they showed me my
[1:49:33] father then i' say let me be
[1:49:38] here so I stayed there with my father
[1:49:42] for trying to know his
[1:49:45] condition you know he was a witch
[1:49:50] doctor I hope you know you understand
[1:49:54] not these ones who
[1:49:55] F but the other one would use a lot of
[1:50:02] charms when I was in p and I told
[1:50:09] him then I told him chased us from
[1:50:12] school for
[1:50:14] 2000s then he told me you better
[1:50:18] get at this age you need to
[1:50:21] marry I felt
[1:50:24] bad then he told
[1:50:27] me if not you better go and line
[1:50:31] up
[1:50:35] because when I was at
[1:50:38] school children would fear
[1:50:40] me saying that you're coming from my
[1:50:43] home of each
[1:50:44] doctor
[1:50:47] because all these people who are
[1:50:50] IM whenever they would hug their wi they
[1:50:53] would
[1:50:55] die praise the name of
[1:51:00] Lord so all the children actually
[1:51:02] isolated themselves from me because I
[1:51:04] was coming from which doctor's
[1:51:06] home so I left that home of my father I
[1:51:08] went to my grandparents and then I
[1:51:10] stayed at my
[1:51:12] grandparents and the grandparent Raised
[1:51:14] Me
[1:51:21] Up So my father
[1:51:23] migrated
[1:51:25] from went
[1:51:34] to but my father was just was running
[1:51:36] away from because they were choosing him
[1:51:38] of things he has done using
[1:51:46] witchcraft so when I grew up after
[1:51:48] around 18 years
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:56] so they told me that there was good land
[1:51:57] there in
[1:51:59] ch when I reached
[1:52:01] there I reached
[1:52:04] there and it was land he gave me about
[1:52:07] 17
[1:52:12] Aces but then the drinking water was
[1:52:16] brown this side used to clean
[1:52:20] water so I left that place and came back
[1:52:23] back in7
[1:52:26] 1997 and so the conditions became tough
[1:52:35] this8 there was a pcor preached to me
[1:52:38] the
[1:52:40] gospel and then accept the Lord Jesus
[1:52:43] as but why was I getting
[1:52:48] saved I wanted my name to be changed
[1:52:50] that is the son of
[1:52:56] that I'm not more counted to be a
[1:52:59] doctor but I wanted to be called a saved
[1:53:03] person and then I said that will be a
[1:53:05] good
[1:53:07] tile I AC the Lord Jesus as my personal
[1:53:17] sai8 the same month that I I I was born
[1:53:20] is the same month that accept the lordes
[1:53:22] as my personal
[1:53:25] savior now in
[1:53:28] 2000 they gave me a church to
[1:53:32] Pastor it was
[1:53:36] in and then I was a pastor of that
[1:53:41] church we had about people in the
[1:53:47] church but then economically was very
[1:53:50] hard to be there
[1:53:54] then I said I
[1:53:55] have why don't go
[1:54:01] there so he
[1:54:04] had told him let
[1:54:07] me he went
[1:54:10] to at
[1:54:13] that was part of not yet been
[1:54:16] divided so I was
[1:54:18] in and then we started you know planting
[1:54:22] then I said let me do all that I
[1:54:26] can but then i' accept the Lord Jesus as
[1:54:29] my when I told my father that you
[1:54:34] know there should not be anything you
[1:54:36] should do like a
[1:54:37] rual may have accept the Lord Jesus as
[1:54:39] my personal
[1:54:42] savior then he told me if you have taken
[1:54:44] Christ as your personal savior you
[1:54:46] better live in my
[1:54:48] life I've never I've never been with
[1:54:50] people are foolish like saved people
[1:54:53] so again I
[1:54:55] left I went to another
[1:54:58] Village so as a
[1:55:02] parent he told
[1:55:05] me when I came
[1:55:08] back he went
[1:55:15] to at that time he had over 60
[1:55:19] children right now he's having over 100
[1:55:21] children
[1:55:23] praise the name of
[1:55:26] Lord but me I'm the
[1:55:29] child
[1:55:31] now so when he told me that you come
[1:55:33] back I came
[1:55:37] back but he came back with two wives
[1:55:40] just young
[1:55:42] women then he told me that this one is
[1:55:44] yours and then this other one is
[1:55:48] mine then him why did you do such a
[1:55:51] thing
[1:55:54] so he said I'm giving you this wife this
[1:55:55] other one is
[1:55:57] mine then I told him father thank
[1:56:02] you for us ased people we don't marry
[1:56:05] like
[1:56:06] that and then he became
[1:56:10] angry he tell tells me come back but
[1:56:13] again he brings a wife for me I refuse
[1:56:17] her so he says either I should just kill
[1:56:21] you then went in my
[1:56:23] heart said God help
[1:56:26] me and then the Lord helped
[1:56:30] me and in the following day he got a
[1:56:32] person would give that girl and then
[1:56:34] they gave him his
[1:56:36] money the girl was in that place
[1:56:41] mon they got when she had
[1:56:45] stolen then I told my father you see
[1:56:47] what you you going to
[1:56:49] do then he said please forgive me
[1:56:54] then he told me let your people get you
[1:56:56] a
[1:56:59] wife then there I was able to get some
[1:57:02] Rel and then I started preaching the
[1:57:04] gospel in on that
[1:57:07] Village there is a place which was given
[1:57:10] out it is
[1:57:13] called and then Village is
[1:57:18] called they said we put there five AC
[1:57:23] every place of
[1:57:24] worship should come and get a free land
[1:57:27] here to worship from
[1:57:32] here were were there
[1:57:36] protests and now for me I was the only
[1:57:38] person who was
[1:57:40] p then I told them also give me the land
[1:57:42] for a
[1:57:43] child then they gave me
[1:57:46] one then I said God we going toship from
[1:57:50] here and I saw God brought one woman she
[1:57:54] was
[1:57:55] saved then I said let us start praying
[1:57:57] from
[1:57:58] here we started from there a
[1:58:03] church and that was the first church of
[1:58:07] Pentecostal in that
[1:58:10] place in that same
[1:58:12] Village the church grew
[1:58:16] up you know they they got many cones
[1:58:20] into church and even
[1:58:25] from and so would sing
[1:58:31] language so when they reached about
[1:58:37] 100 so they found somebody who knew
[1:58:39] their language and they said this is the
[1:58:41] person should P
[1:58:44] us said let that person p and then I
[1:58:47] went to another
[1:58:49] place we started many churches in West
[1:58:54] UGA so I came back to
[1:58:58] to and then I came and handed over
[1:59:03] started and then I was because he was a
[1:59:07] bishop we started many
[1:59:14] churches I was a pastor in church many

[1:59:33] to as I told that they will teach you
[1:59:35] the Bible from Genesis to
[1:59:39] Revelation and we learn the
[1:59:45] Bible so he had a friend called he a
[1:59:49] pastor inal
[1:59:56] so they were under the same Pastor
[2:00:01] in then he told me do you
[2:00:04] know I left all that confusion of
[2:00:07] Pentecostal said if it is
[2:00:10] possible you would have received this
[2:00:14] message then I said

[2:00:21] meeting
[2:00:22] so we prepared for a
[2:00:24] meeting and the meeting would

[2:00:59] bre don't allow those men to
[2:01:02] come then he said that gospel is
[2:01:06] wrong that if you going to receive them
[2:01:09] you are
[2:01:10] finished then
[2:01:13] I if my sister told me what should I do
[2:01:18] now and then called

[2:01:27] me you know there
[2:01:30] Cheng so we better
[2:01:33] postp that's how
[2:01:35] I and so we can the
[2:01:37] meeting for he kept
[2:01:42] quiet now was
[2:01:46] over we went into the year
[2:01:49] 2022 in February
[2:01:55] and then he asked me why don't we
[2:01:56] prepare again another
[2:01:59] meeting and I had many churches under
[2:02:03] myol then I told if this gospel is
[2:02:07] bad let me not bring in my
[2:02:12] church because
[2:02:16] wasters even my wife was pastoring in
[2:02:18] that church
[2:02:24] then I said I will not take this gospel
[2:02:26] to where I stay even where my wife
[2:02:29] pastors let me take them to new
[2:02:33] churches if if the gospel is
[2:02:37] false we shall handle with those new
[2:02:39] people don't
[2:02:42] anything so he invited
[2:02:46] Pastor then he said I'm coming with my
[2:02:50] pastor in a district of
[2:02:55] place and I had friend of mine was a p
[2:03:00] in that church
[2:03:01] called he was also a
[2:03:09] bishop so he had told me that for him
[2:03:11] being a bishop he doesn't Pastor
[2:03:12] churches so he had told me to come and
[2:03:14] Pastor his
[2:03:16] churches they told me that these are
[2:03:18] churches under you betterle them
[2:03:23] then I told him as you have handled this
[2:03:25] churches let me also bring this new
[2:03:29] teaching now when the
[2:03:34] dayed that's when he saw brother
[2:03:36] James then he came and
[2:03:39] ministered then he started
[2:03:42] ministering the first
[2:03:44] day he
[2:03:46] preached the one
[2:03:48] God and that is Jesus Christ
[2:03:53] praise the name of our
[2:03:55] Lord and I just kept
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:00] quiet I didn't want
[2:04:03] to because he
[2:04:08] Wasing and I would check in the Bible
[2:04:10] what is reading and is the
[2:04:13] same then I said am I the one who is
[2:04:16] wrong or not
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:22] then he told me that Jesus is
[2:04:28] God for us we used to three
[2:04:32] Gods then he said God is
[2:04:34] one not two not
[2:04:38] three then he said those three gods are
[2:04:42] in
[2:04:43] Witchcraft and I thought that was
[2:04:45] hurting
[2:04:48] me then I thought maybe this is the
[2:04:50] truth
[2:04:52] when we finished the
[2:04:56] meetings there was a meeting
[2:05:00] in then he told us that if you have
[2:05:04] accepted that this is the
[2:05:10] truth so the bishop where at the church
[2:05:12] we had going to say that this is the
[2:05:14] truth and we have accepted
[2:05:17] it so he picked us
[2:05:20] from and brought us to his
[2:05:23] home so the following after coming back
[2:05:26] we went
[2:05:27] to when we
[2:05:31] reached was also
[2:05:35] preaching and again preach that woman
[2:05:37] should not be
[2:05:39] a then I started asking what has
[2:05:43] this then I said my wife is a good
[2:05:46] pre for the
[2:05:53] you know and then the thought came that
[2:05:55] you know after 3 days they had given us
[2:06:00] 600,000 then I said my wife to miss
[2:06:06] this I was working this they were giving
[2:06:09] me she was and giving and we doing
[2:06:12] well
[2:06:15] and a woman should not be
[2:06:18] a and then he read all the and I also
[2:06:22] reading those
[2:06:26] scriptures then I said how am I going to
[2:06:28] start telling my wife these
[2:06:31] things so we
[2:06:34] left when we reached brother's
[2:06:39] place I thank God that
[2:06:43] brother I've learned many things
[2:06:46] from just like they

[2:08:01] understand she would repeat the
[2:08:03] scripture for six times and said I don't
[2:08:05] understand this it came in the
[2:08:09] morning and then another month there was
[2:08:12] a meeting in
[2:08:14] May so they were able to
[2:08:18] travel so came with other six people

[2:08:49] with the go was putting on
[2:08:55] was you know distinguishing
[2:08:59] differently you know the other had
[2:09:02] something a little bit
[2:09:04] different then we came for the meetings
[2:09:06] in
[2:09:08] May and then Pastor St started
[2:09:12] PR he preached for two hours and 47
[2:09:16] minutes we listen to the message well
[2:09:20] heot the message
[2:09:23] and then goes back into the
[2:09:24] Bible for the message were not
[2:09:29] understanding and then wondering why he
[2:09:31] was reading this we not seeing them in
[2:09:34] our
[2:09:35] Bibles so my
[2:09:40] wife don't you think this is the
[2:09:44] truth so when they were lunch
[2:09:47] in house
[2:09:52] then Pastor asked her pastor pastor's
[2:09:55] wife what have you
[2:10:01] heard she said that I've heard this is
[2:10:03] the
[2:10:05] truth then she said what what do you
[2:10:07] think about
[2:10:09] this then the wife
[2:10:13] said the wife said I don't want to go to
[2:10:17] hell so when they were going back home
[2:10:19] to
[2:10:24] the wife told him that you better get
[2:10:26] another person to become the pastor to
[2:10:31] be you know under Pentecostal being you
[2:10:34] know a great
[2:10:38] hon whenever they say Pastor coming they
[2:10:40] run very fast pick the Bible from
[2:10:43] him now when she reach the church as a
[2:10:47] pastor
[2:10:51] they ran to pick the Bible from she
[2:10:53] refused they asked Pastor what has
[2:10:55] happened to so the wife said you better
[2:10:58] leave me
[2:11:01] alone now that day I had to go to church
[2:11:04] because told me I'm no longer a
[2:11:07] pastor then you know like the owner
[2:11:09] takes up
[2:11:11] the then I told her you better leave I'm
[2:11:13] going to do a pastoring
[2:11:17] work put chair they put her chair at the
[2:11:20] ppit she removed it and she put it
[2:11:24] behind what has happened to you
[2:11:26] Pastor she said that I've seen the
[2:11:31] truth and then she said those women who
[2:11:34] like the pulpit you like the pulpit but
[2:11:36] not that there is
[2:11:37] Hell praise the name of our
[2:11:40] Lord so they thought she was
[2:11:43] joking then I also got the
[2:11:45] mic I preach to them the
[2:11:49] truth that wife of mine you see she has
[2:11:53] seen the truth she's no longer a
[2:11:57] pastor but she's just a
[2:11:59] Christian a true Christian of
[2:12:02] God and now you see as the bride
[2:12:06] ofr she's preparing for Christ's coming
[2:12:10] praise the name of our they were not
[2:12:14] understanding but for us we tell them
[2:12:16] for us we have understood what we are on
[2:12:19] WEAU
[2:12:22] we came with another brother called in
[2:12:24] those
[2:12:25] meetings he also believed the
[2:12:30] message the overse of the district
[2:12:33] refused and then
[2:12:37] started theel is totally
[2:12:41] different we told
[2:12:44] you many are but few are
[2:12:47] chosen we started preaching in our
[2:12:50] church
[2:12:53] and then about the was
[2:12:55] put then I told those were put
[2:12:58] on those are just
[2:13:02] H but when Jesus was on when he was
[2:13:08] preaching he did never put on a
[2:13:13] disting I said if he had a a different
[2:13:15] dress maybe AAR
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:21] they would have come knowing that
[2:13:24] Jesus but because he was dring like
[2:13:28] the he was it was somebody among them
[2:13:32] but when I preached that go
[2:13:35] CH they people were covering my the
[2:13:39] video and then they sent to my
[2:13:41] bishop and then he called me he said why
[2:13:45] are you abusing
[2:13:46] me put
[2:13:49] on don't you know that from
[2:13:53] America you didn't see the white man who
[2:13:55] dressed Us in
[2:13:58] those don't you know that your dressing
[2:14:00] of priest came from
[2:14:02] America now what's wrong with
[2:14:06] that the wrong thing is putting on those
[2:14:09] kind
[2:14:10] of if you want to preach the true
[2:14:13] gospel even our
[2:14:21] I say those put on those callar and
[2:14:23] those PRI ropes are the ones who just go
[2:14:25] in the
[2:14:26] market who want to be recognized in
[2:14:30] meeting I said we don't want those
[2:14:32] things
[2:14:33] anymore praise the name
[2:14:36] of then he told me what I'm you you
[2:14:39] better leave my
[2:14:44] church we had just finished building
[2:14:46] that church in bricks and cement and
[2:14:49] prayed from there 6 months now
[2:14:52] so he told me you better leave my
[2:14:55] church but you know he never had the
[2:14:58] agement he never put there any
[2:15:01] sign then I was
[2:15:06] wondering and even now the other
[2:15:08] Christians were not wanting
[2:15:12] that why have I removed their Pastor who
[2:15:15] is a
[2:15:16] woman others didn't want it others
[2:15:19] wanted it
[2:15:22] so when I saw that every Sunday would
[2:15:24] come to church and we were fighting
[2:15:25] among
[2:15:27] ourselves I was preaching like at this
[2:15:32] time then I told this is my lastone in
[2:15:35] your church here
[2:15:37] today I'm
[2:15:40] this
[2:15:44] message want it stay
[2:15:47] here but from today on I'm no longer
[2:15:49] your
[2:15:51] I've left this
[2:15:53] church the one who wants to follow me
[2:15:55] because of this TR let them follow
[2:15:58] me so I took with my
[2:16:01] wife will you follow
[2:16:03] me I said I will follow
[2:16:06] you then even my children will you
[2:16:09] follow
[2:16:10] me then they say we shall
[2:16:13] follow then I said you better say bye to
[2:16:16] these people so they told those people
[2:16:18] we are going
[2:16:21] others were
[2:16:25] crying then I told them you are cry you
[2:16:27] weeping like for
[2:16:29] which if you have known the
[2:16:32] truth I wouldn't
[2:16:35] have but because you have refus the
[2:16:37] truth that's why I'm leaving
[2:16:38] this so I raised
[2:16:41] the those who are going to follow
[2:16:44] me I'm going to my home to start a
[2:16:46] church
[2:16:49] there we were felling for my home for
[2:16:51] six
[2:16:54] months until the lord gave us our
[2:16:57] place as you know for
[2:17:00] town you couldn't GA from a place
[2:17:03] without
[2:17:05] a until the Lord provided
[2:17:08] that we to
[2:17:12] build and we started now gathering in
[2:17:14] that
[2:17:21] that was in July
[2:17:25] 2023 and we started fellowshipping from
[2:17:27] our own
[2:17:29] place so we separated ourselves
[2:17:32] from they knew that this is a
[2:17:35] church for the message of the
[2:17:39] hour and we started preaching the
[2:17:42] gospel then people told me that I'm
[2:17:48] mad then I said if I'm mad I'm mad for
[2:17:50] for
[2:17:53] Christ then the mayor of the town called
[2:17:56] me then he told me you people are born
[2:18:01] again we thought you as you have built
[2:18:03] your building you're going
[2:18:05] to what is left for you to
[2:18:08] get and now we seeing you have left a
[2:18:12] building said now you you are confusing
[2:18:15] us then I told him you can't understand
[2:18:19] but me I know what I'm doing
[2:18:23] the bishop called
[2:18:26] them then he said the people from him
[2:18:29] aot
[2:18:35] of then he started blacking that they
[2:18:38] tried to give him a car bapti in the
[2:18:40] name of Jesus Christ and then he
[2:18:45] refused then I told
[2:18:48] him then I told him for you you miss for
[2:18:51] me they baptized me without anything now
[2:18:53] for they were promising you things why
[2:18:54] did you refuse those things praise the
[2:18:57] name of our
[2:18:59] Lord and then the Lord started
[2:19:04] establishing
[2:19:07] brother so come frequently that two or
[2:19:11] months then also come this
[2:19:17] way so the wife has been saving us from
[2:19:20] the time we started
[2:19:23] the first time my wife
[2:19:25] visited when she had a small
[2:19:31] baby not knowing anything about the
[2:19:39] message then when you breastfeeding do
[2:19:42] you cover yourself so she breastfeed
[2:19:48] any so for she was just to bre
[2:19:53] fre not knowing
[2:19:56] [Music]
[2:20:00] anything so when we started reading
[2:20:02] about a true
[2:20:06] church we started seeing these
[2:20:09] things the way the church should be
[2:20:12] conduct how should the Christian
[2:20:15] conduct how should the woman conduct
[2:20:18] herself when she saw that
[2:20:21] said God forgive
[2:20:24] me I went to G and I was breastfeeding
[2:20:27] showing people my
[2:20:29] breastfeed said I don't know what they
[2:20:34] about I the times of ignorance
[2:20:39] wined said you have understood it better
[2:20:44] not and God told us how we should
[2:20:46] conduct ourselves
[2:20:51] that's why the you
[2:20:59] people in our church there's no woman no
[2:21:02] girl who puts on a Dr just stopping
[2:21:04] actually at the
[2:21:10] knee and we don't have those young men
[2:21:13] or boys who put on tight
[2:21:21] and we don't have youth in the church
[2:21:24] who have their
[2:21:30] cards we don't person unless
[2:21:33] maybe hallelujah praise the name
[2:21:41] of so our sisters come with the clothes
[2:21:44] if somebody comes not dressed decently
[2:21:46] they give them to cover themselves
[2:21:51] then they give a please cover yourself
[2:21:59] properly so maybe when we have preached
[2:22:01] to somebody in other
[2:22:04] Villages but the village where we
[2:22:10] are the people in the village know those
[2:22:15] dress the youth don't don't dress in a
[2:22:18] very fun way they don't kind of sh
[2:22:27] their those are not
[2:22:30] there we learn how to conduct
[2:22:33] ourselves praise the name of our
[2:22:37] Lord we learn not eat from the
[2:22:41] church not take phone calls from
[2:22:48] the so I ask the people do you have any
[2:22:51] program on phone said then you better
[2:22:53] switch off your phone when you're in
[2:22:58] church because they would you put it in
[2:23:01] silence but then still
[2:23:11] vibrate I said now if Muslims respect
[2:23:13] their M yet what they worship is not
[2:23:17] right they respect their mes
[2:23:22] what about why don't you respect
[2:23:29] God remind
[2:23:33] people
[2:23:37] your maybe when you want to
[2:23:41] take but if you're not going to for
[2:23:43] things of
[2:23:48] church why do you have a phone and rece
[2:23:50] receive it and then you miss eternal
[2:23:52] life praise the
[2:23:54] name so we learn the discipline of the
[2:23:59] church and God kept on removing the
[2:24:02] things of the
[2:24:05] world and my daughters were completely
[2:24:08] Disturbed with the is of
[2:24:13] hair and then my said that she she allow
[2:24:16] issues of air when
[2:24:18] she but when we got the message
[2:24:22] we told her if you don't obey the
[2:24:24] word you are
[2:24:27] justed if you don't obey the word you're
[2:24:30] destined
[2:24:31] for now she has accepted the
[2:24:36] message and then I told don't stop at
[2:24:39] only having long hair and having good
[2:24:41] dresses when you don't have the word
[2:24:43] inside of
[2:24:55] because you like good dresses and they
[2:24:59] message but when you have rejected the
[2:25:01] word it's not good praise the name of
[2:25:04] the
[2:25:06] Lord so God gave me
[2:25:09] Grace and give me
[2:25:12] boldness to preach this message to other
[2:25:19] people and then I said if I've been
[2:25:21] opening churches when I'm a
[2:25:25] pcal now I've got the message of the
[2:25:27] should I just sit
[2:25:30] back then I said I better
[2:25:35] arise every church that I pastored in I
[2:25:39] should go and preach the
[2:25:41] gospel if they refuse that's not
[2:25:43] my but I would have witness to
[2:25:47] them those who receive me I also receive
[2:25:49] them
[2:25:51] so started preaching the
[2:25:54] gospel and started believing the
[2:25:57] message accepting this
[2:26:01] message I went and preached
[2:26:04] in we have bed 50
[2:26:09] people and then we went in the oil
[2:26:11] fields
[2:26:14] Ino the first time I
[2:26:17] baptized people who accepted the message
[2:26:20] the first
[2:26:24] day and then after two weeks I went back
[2:26:26] and baptized about 80
[2:26:29] people then I went to
[2:26:32] R and then I bz another 50
[2:26:35] people accepted the
[2:26:37] message and others would call you on
[2:26:40] phone come and tell us that message you
[2:26:45] got the first subject I learned in the
[2:26:48] message
[2:26:51] it's only one God they not two they not
[2:26:55] three but it's only one and that's the
[2:26:58] Lord Jesus
[2:27:01] [Music]
[2:27:05] Christ even if you come at
[2:27:08] night I would still preach to you
[2:27:11] one I went and preached to
[2:27:14] them we are worshiping other gods we
[2:27:17] don't
[2:27:18] know but we've got one God
[2:27:22] andus talking about we didn't know
[2:27:25] him when I went
[2:27:28] to I Bap
[2:27:31] about then the bishop told me you better
[2:27:33] go to all my
[2:27:35] churches praise the
[2:27:37] name I went back to I baptized another
[2:27:40] 50
[2:27:41] people when we left that
[2:27:44] place we came to
[2:27:46] Joo we also
[2:27:48] baptized and there
[2:27:51] I went
[2:27:55] toana so in all those places churches
[2:27:58] open so I would go back those
[2:28:05] places then I preached
[2:28:08] there church has about 300
[2:28:12] people that time we bz only 180
[2:28:17] people when they had known the truth
[2:28:23] so I continued moving on with the
[2:28:26] word just last year in in
[2:28:32] September brother James came for a
[2:28:34] meeting in our
[2:28:37] place it was for only two
[2:28:41] days
[2:28:45] days we had two days meeting in
[2:29:00] that place in is the place where people
[2:29:02] who are
[2:29:04] cannibal most of them come from
[2:29:07] there so in that same
[2:29:10] town there is a
[2:29:12] church it was being ped by a
[2:29:16] woman the woman was coming from
[2:29:18] preaching on the loud
[2:29:21] speaker she was my
[2:29:25] friend and then she wanted me to become
[2:29:27] her
[2:29:31] P when she left gospel killed
[2:29:35] her so she left that church
[2:29:40] there so they received
[2:29:44] me then I told them you're not going to
[2:29:46] receive me
[2:29:48] alone but I have other
[2:29:52] Brethren so went there with brother
[2:29:55] James so in September I preached
[2:29:58] there after preaching
[2:30:01] there that same
[2:30:03] day people accept to be

[2:31:10] police and then they told the policeman
[2:31:13] that that this man should produce
[2:31:14] documents that allow him to be a

[2:39:44] day they came to be prayed
[2:39:47] for and I was busy praying for those
[2:39:50] people some
[2:39:53] were
[2:39:55] some and every person was coming to be
[2:39:57] prayed
[2:39:58] for even in time of Jesus
[2:40:01] Christ many people didn't
[2:40:04] likees but they only wanted
[2:40:07] Miracles so those who want Miracles were
[2:40:10] coming and
[2:40:13] even because God wanted this work to
[2:40:15] continue praise the name of our Lord
[2:40:20] so I went back
[2:40:26] to so from I went back to strengthen
[2:40:29] these
[2:40:33] people there's another person who is
[2:40:36] about 30 km from that
[2:40:46] place so one of the people have prayed
[2:40:49] for
[2:40:51] who was possessed was delivered and then
[2:40:53] say that he has a wife who is also
[2:40:56] having a
[2:40:57] problem so they took me
[2:41:00] there reached there and then prayed for
[2:41:03] that
[2:41:05] woman the leg had actually some kind of
[2:41:08] for long
[2:41:10] time and she was giving a
[2:41:13] testimony they were amputating the
[2:41:16] leg I prayed for that woman
[2:41:20] when I just finished praying for
[2:41:22] her when the leg was still
[2:41:25] swelling but she was not feeling any
[2:41:27] pain and then she started walking the
[2:41:31] one was not
[2:41:33] walking but the leg was still
[2:41:36] swollen but then she was saying no
[2:41:38] long and then she was moving
[2:41:41] around and people were
[2:41:44] surprised the following day the swelling
[2:41:47] started disappearing
[2:41:51] and then again God raised
[2:41:55] his the Father the father-in-law to this
[2:41:59] woman who was
[2:42:01] healed was a witch doctor in that
[2:42:04] place she he was one of the head of

[2:42:24] the Lord Jesus who healed
[2:42:26] him if you accept the Lord
[2:42:29] Jesus he will do something in your life
[2:42:32] then said for a long
[2:42:34] time he said I've been with wit
[2:42:37] doctors and he said I've been a witch
[2:42:40] doctor for many years but there's no
[2:42:41] life in Witch

[2:43:03] Jesus even if you are dead you will be
[2:43:08] alive this body will
[2:43:11] die but then you have eternal
[2:43:16] life so now he was being convicted in
[2:43:19] his
[2:43:21] heart then he said I have a lot of my
[2:43:29] witchcraft can I bring all my Witchcraft
[2:43:32] and then you take them and then I get
[2:43:34] that life said do
[2:43:37] it then he
[2:43:41] went then he brought something like dead
[2:43:45] body then he brought a pot
[2:43:53] and then things were blood boiling in
[2:43:55] the
[2:43:59] pot like burning almost overing but not
[2:44:03] overing then he said all these are my
[2:44:06] charms are
[2:44:09] here then he said if you can take these
[2:44:11] things away from me then I will get
[2:44:15] sa then I said all these things which
[2:44:18] are in the they have no
[2:44:20] power and then it stopped
[2:44:24] boiling and then he saw that the things
[2:44:26] in the PO boiling then he got
[2:44:30] surprised then he was
[2:44:32] surprised then I
[2:44:34] told if I've been
[2:44:36] in in were
[2:44:40] also all these people who make people
[2:44:42] walk at
[2:44:44] night we would pray for them and then
[2:44:49] now that I've accepted the message of
[2:44:52] the can God really refuse to help
[2:44:58] me then I told them you bring fire and
[2:45:00] we burn all these
[2:45:03] things we burnt all those
[2:45:07] things I got that
[2:45:10] PO and then I went and pour the
[2:45:12] substances in
[2:45:15] the and then I got a and broke it into
[2:45:17] pieces
[2:45:19] I didn't do you accept the Lord Jesus
[2:45:22] then you accept the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:45:24] Hallelujah
[2:45:25] am then I prayed for
[2:45:29] him he wased with
[2:45:35] people and then the lorded working like
[2:45:39] that why am I saying
[2:45:43] that when I told you my birth was not
[2:45:46] easy
[2:45:50] then maybe go so that if this if I die
[2:45:52] when I'm still
[2:45:54] young there is some work I should have
[2:45:57] done praise the name of our
[2:46:00] Lord so God gave me
[2:46:08] Grace but one thing which has
[2:46:10] strengthened me is to read the
[2:46:14] message whenever I read the message it
[2:46:17] gives me encouragement
[2:46:22] I got I read about that message of
[2:46:29] AUD the prophet was
[2:46:36] saying that God is hidden behind a veil
[2:46:39] of a
[2:46:44] person that was behind the veil of
[2:46:47] Elijah
[2:46:51] that was behind the veil of Jesus
[2:46:55] Christ when I learned
[2:46:59] that God was in those
[2:47:01] days the same God we
[2:47:05] Ser then I said God be behind my
[2:47:09] ve that message strengthened
[2:47:12] meise the
[2:47:14] name then I read another message
[2:47:20] the Misunderstood
[2:47:22] God we can maybe read that
[2:47:30] message the Misunderstood
[2:47:36] God
[2:47:47] yes in January
[2:47:53] 1963
[2:48:13] uh there is a portion
[2:48:28] which talks about
[2:48:30] your descent descent or
[2:48:47] descendant asking the
[2:48:51] prophet
[2:48:58] question I was baptized when I got
[2:49:03] saved in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:49:08] Christ how can I live a stubborn
[2:49:14] Spirit which is as if I can't overcome
[2:49:17] that
[2:49:19] to leave that stubborn
[2:49:21] Spirit praise the name of our
[2:49:26] Lord that question Disturbed
[2:49:32] me and when the prophet was answering
[2:49:35] that
[2:49:43] question that even if you are baptized
[2:49:45] in the name of Jesus Christ can you get
[2:49:48] away from that evil
[2:49:50] spirit the prophet said it's okay it's
[2:49:55] true so he
[2:50:02] says so my
[2:50:04] brother oh my
[2:50:06] sister you as a
[2:50:10] Christian this
[2:50:13] question many
[2:50:16] times many times
[2:50:24] when you get people who get those which
[2:50:26] make them like
[2:50:30] [Music]
[2:50:32] M there are always complexes that brings
[2:50:35] this
[2:50:36] out one of
[2:50:39] them either they from their father
[2:50:43] mother
[2:50:51] Auntie
[2:50:54] grandar father
[2:50:56] mother or anybody like
[2:50:59] that and if
[2:51:02] yourself you chase it back
[2:51:05] down through your
[2:51:07] life you'll
[2:51:10] find you have taken it has happened to
[2:51:16] you but now I've taken it by experience
[2:51:21] discernment those
[2:51:24] things but then the
[2:51:26] eyes but in
[2:51:30] future I've seen those things when I'm
[2:51:33] on
[2:51:35] the and many people in
[2:51:38] thousands who have that kind of spirit
[2:51:42] the first
[2:51:50] I was Discerning that
[2:51:54] Spirit Discerning it by The Things Not
[2:51:58] Seen then I found
[2:52:01] out there was a
[2:52:04] grandfather or a
[2:52:07] grandmother or there somebody
[2:52:09] else who is behind these
[2:52:14] things so you inherit this by your birth
[2:52:19] praise the name of our
[2:52:21] Lord that
[2:52:23] message I read
[2:52:26] it and then I it took me into some
[2:52:30] depth many
[2:52:32] times our
[2:52:35] faith is
[2:52:37] limited because of our
[2:52:41] birth when somebody says I'm born
[2:52:44] again because there is a
[2:52:46] spirit there's a spirit from the
[2:52:49] of maybe
[2:52:51] anger or maybe
[2:52:54] Strife or maybe
[2:53:01] quing
[2:53:03] mayal praise the
[2:53:06] name those Spirits can follow
[2:53:11] from even if they been baptized in the
[2:53:14] name of Jesus
[2:53:15] Christ you can find somebody still lying
[2:53:19] but was in the name of Jesus Christ it
[2:53:21] is EAS to find a he a saved person in
[2:53:25] church even the
[2:53:27] wife when God bless you God bless
[2:53:31] you and then
[2:53:32] they but when they reach
[2:53:36] home complaining
[2:53:38] M starts from
[2:53:43] there everybody at chur say that
[2:53:46] person when they reach home they
[2:53:48] different
[2:53:49] it's not the other brother you
[2:53:51] know now that one comes from
[2:53:54] a when I got this
[2:53:57] message when the prophet was talking
[2:53:59] about it is not
[2:54:01] you you it from your
[2:54:04] par because you were born in
[2:54:06] that and then others follows
[2:54:09] the
[2:54:11] I'm I don't
[2:54:13] know what was he
[2:54:15] like the
[2:54:18] but because of
[2:54:20] that because it was not
[2:54:22] mine it is
[2:54:24] EAS when you don't
[2:54:26] know and then you cut them yourself
[2:54:31] off and then that thing cannot come
[2:54:35] back so this message remed me from where
[2:54:38] I come
[2:54:39] from there was a woman who gave birth to
[2:54:43] they gave the child a name when they
[2:54:46] gave the birth the child
[2:54:48] so the child was crying the whole
[2:54:51] day when the child was crying the whole
[2:54:55] day then they went to the witch
[2:54:58] doctors then wit doctors
[2:55:01] actually when they reached
[2:55:06] there then they were told the name you
[2:55:09] this
[2:55:12] child the the the grandfather died
[2:55:15] because he had stolen m
[2:55:19] bananas that she had stolen she had
[2:55:25] stolen said if you you going to stop
[2:55:27] this child
[2:55:29] from go and steal for
[2:55:32] her and then cook
[2:55:36] it and then put one of them then in that
[2:55:41] soup and then make the that not
[2:55:45] Contin they did the same they stole the
[2:55:49] banana they cooked
[2:55:51] it they gave the
[2:55:54] child was 3 days and the child
[2:55:59] sto now don't you see that person was
[2:56:03] in you may also not know what was
[2:56:06] done that's what the prophet was talking
[2:56:10] about somebody can baptize in the name
[2:56:13] ofes but then still having that nature
[2:56:18] and then you see somebody
[2:56:21] doing and then when they come say I
[2:56:23] don't know what
[2:56:25] I'm but when they go home they see the
[2:56:29] same and then they give them the name in
[2:56:32] the village praise the
[2:56:37] name when I got this
[2:56:39] message then I also discovered myself
[2:56:42] then I went
[2:56:47] back I was I was actually born in a
[2:56:49] family where immoral things
[2:56:54] happen all my
[2:56:58] decent none of them was going Beyond
[2:57:06] P so whenever I go to see what is
[2:57:11] happening then I said this Spirit of not
[2:57:13] going to school is maybe from generation
[2:57:16] not maybe there's no
[2:57:20] or maybe saying why do you take children
[2:57:21] to school praise the name of
[2:57:24] our so I called all my
[2:57:27] children and I told
[2:57:29] them then I told them you
[2:57:33] know from our grandparents five
[2:57:37] generations they have not been going to
[2:57:41] school make sure that you don't follow
[2:57:43] this same habit which has happened
[2:57:45] before
[2:57:50] or maybe in your family there are people
[2:57:51] who are
[2:57:52] drun when that
[2:57:55] person that Spirit comes and get for
[2:57:57] another
[2:57:58] person you know they
[2:58:06] say know that what happens to your
[2:58:09] neighbor can at the same time come and
[2:58:10] happen to your home
[2:58:24] so when people die Spirits can come back
[2:58:26] on other
[2:58:28] people it may
[2:58:30] not it may not come and catch the one
[2:58:32] who has received the
[2:58:34] message but then you can get another
[2:58:36] person or a child who has never because
[2:58:39] the Bible
[2:58:41] says that I Vis the iniquity of your
[2:58:44] your
[2:58:45] fathers from the third generation
[2:58:49] up the fourth
[2:58:52] generation when you read in
[2:58:55] Exodus the
[2:58:57] name God has a
[2:59:01] generation but now for us who accept the
[2:59:03] Lord Jesus in
[2:59:05] truth we have to remove
[2:59:10] everything because the prophet was
[2:59:12] talking about
[2:59:14] it when you discover yourself
[2:59:23] so now for my background my mother and
[2:59:26] father the generation was not
[2:59:30] good okay what happened
[2:59:38] there whenever they would say that they
[2:59:40] collecting
[2:59:42] people okay whenever there was people
[2:59:45] gathering at it was a funeral
[2:59:49] there was nothing like any
[2:59:52] function somebody's having over 100
[2:59:54] children
[2:59:55] how what will happen like a function of
[3:00:00] marriage then I said that one is the way
[3:00:03] we
[3:00:05] come then I tell now you better get the
[3:00:08] message you'll be married right when
[3:00:11] they
[3:00:12] are and they will come at
[3:00:15] home then I told them young
[3:00:19] don't take the spirit of my grand my
[3:00:22] grandfa you better take a hold of the
[3:00:25] message you make sure that you Mar right
[3:00:29] praise the name of
[3:00:31] our so the message is preparing
[3:00:34] us to be that we established in the
[3:00:37] truth this is where the Prophet
[3:00:42] said in that message Audible
[3:00:49] there is nothing which can be as
[3:00:51] pleasing
[3:00:55] God like the life that is fully
[3:00:57] surrendered to
[3:00:59] Christ come praise the name of our
[3:01:02] Lord if you give all your life to
[3:01:05] Christ he
[3:01:10] said even if you don't have shoes to put
[3:01:14] on even if you don't have cloes
[3:01:20] but if your life sinks the life your
[3:01:23] life sinks the Life of
[3:01:28] Christ and then he says what does it
[3:01:30] what do you benefit by putting on
[3:01:32] expensive
[3:01:34] clothes but when your life doesn't have
[3:01:38] Christ that's why we go
[3:01:41] back first Timothy Chapter
[3:01:45] 2 says that even women should Ador
[3:01:48] themselves in
[3:01:53] modest not in putting on expensive
[3:01:56] things or costly up or
[3:02:00] whatever but women who profess to be
[3:02:02] doing good
[3:02:05] works what was the Bible talking
[3:02:10] about your well
[3:02:14] dressing let it
[3:02:16] be inside
[3:02:18] if you are dressed
[3:02:20] well you
[3:02:22] man but
[3:02:24] even is singing
[3:02:28] Christ I don't see you appearing well
[3:02:32] outside but then inside something
[3:02:34] contrary to what is
[3:02:38] outside Christ was talking about you
[3:02:40] know
[3:02:42] Graves that they make the gra look nice
[3:02:46] outside but but inside they are rotten
[3:02:49] bones praise the name of the
[3:02:53] Lord the Bible says should not be like
[3:02:55] this
[3:02:57] generation now you try to put them
[3:03:00] together what has been missing in your
[3:03:02] life there is a person in the
[3:03:05] bible let us read
[3:03:08] there first
[3:03:11] Kings chapter 22
[3:03:22] [Music]
[3:03:24] and then verse
[3:03:31] 34 the scripture
[3:03:46] says for
[3:04:36] so First Kings
[3:04:38] 2:34 and a certain man drew a b at
[3:04:41] Venture and smot the king of Israel
[3:04:44] between the joints of the hes wherefore
[3:04:47] he said to the drive of his Chariot turn
[3:04:49] thine hand and Carry Me Out of the host
[3:04:52] for I am wounded and the battle
[3:04:53] increased that day and the King was
[3:04:55] stayed up in his Chariot against the
[3:04:58] syrians and died at even and the blood
[3:05:01] ran out of the wound into the midst of
[3:05:04] The Chariot and there went a
[3:05:06] proclamation throughout the host about
[3:05:08] the going down of the sun saying every
[3:05:10] man to his City and every man to his own
[3:05:14] country so the king died and was brought
[3:05:16] Samaria and they buried the king in
[3:05:29] Samaria so I I read this place and it
[3:05:32] was good to
[3:05:35] me King was in
[3:05:39] battle they were
[3:05:42] fighting Ahab wanted
[3:05:46] Victory but among his
[3:05:51] them there's somebody who drew a
[3:05:56] b and then it went
[3:06:02] up so the Bible says released the bow
[3:06:05] with without you know without maybe it
[3:06:09] went actually
[3:06:12] unconsciously he didn't know whom he was
[3:06:14] he was Notting anybody
[3:06:18] but now when the bow
[3:06:20] went so the arrow actually hit
[3:06:29] Ahab and so this Arrow went to the Joint
[3:06:34] where the metals they cover the
[3:06:36] knees The Joint where in other a free
[3:06:39] space
[3:06:40] between the
[3:06:43] metals the Bible says he was covered
[3:06:46] with a metal
[3:06:56] to a joint between the
[3:06:59] metals praise the name of our
[3:07:01] Lord what does that
[3:07:05] mean in that time was one fighting when
[3:07:09] he was
[3:07:10] fighting right now we are the ones
[3:07:14] fighting fighting the enemy
[3:07:18] he want to take you back for you want to
[3:07:20] go
[3:07:24] for ofab was for a
[3:07:30] physical but for us we have a spiritual
[3:07:36] dressing so even
[3:07:38] Satan is not
[3:07:43] settled he was there when they were
[3:07:45] shooting that Arrow
[3:07:51] even now Satan can release that
[3:07:59] b so how does he find your protection
[3:08:03] does he find your protection with
[3:08:05] gaps
[3:08:10] the if there are gaps in your your your
[3:08:14] your spiritual we that's where Satan's b
[3:08:17] or are all that is going to pass what do
[3:08:20] I
[3:08:25] mean if you are a saved
[3:08:30] person but you have refused to leave
[3:08:34] sin now that's where the devil uses to
[3:08:36] pass
[3:08:42] through when we were still
[3:08:45] young a person in the village
[3:08:48] you know they would kind of like fight
[3:08:51] one another they would wrestle with one
[3:08:54] another and then they would box each
[3:08:55] other to find out who is the best in the
[3:08:58] village but God helped
[3:09:01] us when you
[3:09:05] knew when you know somebody has been
[3:09:07] hurt by maybe
[3:09:11] a then maybe you go and try to disturb
[3:09:14] that person because they already
[3:09:16] had you know that the person you are
[3:09:18] going to fight with is not
[3:09:21] a so when you fight with person who is
[3:09:24] having a prick in the
[3:09:28] foot so for you you step in
[3:09:32] somebody's even if they are so
[3:09:39] strong then they would plead please
[3:09:41] forgive us because they knew they know
[3:09:43] they have a wound which you can press
[3:09:45] into prise the
[3:09:51] Satan knows where
[3:09:54] your where your weaknesses that's Satan
[3:09:56] wants to
[3:09:59] attack so now when Satan know that you
[3:10:01] left him right he can't bring kind of
[3:10:04] wom
[3:10:05] toct I don't
[3:10:09] drink even if you put in maybe in a
[3:10:13] place even if they have a lot of Jans of
[3:10:19] I just when
[3:10:23] noten so Satan knows that one you
[3:10:27] overcame Satan
[3:10:31] knows so Satan knows where your
[3:10:36] weaknesses so he attacks you by your
[3:10:40] weaknesses and that's where the arrow
[3:10:44] passes because this arrow goes in the
[3:10:46] air
[3:10:48] it is
[3:10:49] looking so when it finds a place which
[3:10:51] is free that free space is
[3:10:55] where when it finds a place of that's
[3:10:59] where the arrow will
[3:11:00] pass when it finds a place
[3:11:03] of that's where it will
[3:11:07] pass when it finds a place where there
[3:11:09] is that's where the
[3:11:11] [Music]
[3:11:13] AR when it finds a place where they give
[3:11:16] that's where it will
[3:11:17] pass praise the name of our
[3:11:20] Lord
[3:11:22] now your
[3:11:24] weakness you know where your
[3:11:27] weak but then that's where Satan comes
[3:11:31] and that's why somebody's in the
[3:11:34] church a is over and still in the same
[3:11:38] habit praise the name of our
[3:11:43] Lord Satan know that when I TCH he
[3:11:45] doesn't have power
[3:11:52] so the of the devil looks where you are
[3:11:56] relax so what covers that
[3:11:59] Gap you need to go to the AL of and then
[3:12:03] you cry to the Lord and then he
[3:12:06] covers
[3:12:07] when
[3:12:09] where even if he Pier all that place is
[3:12:13] covered with praise the name of our Lord
[3:12:17] so it's only the
[3:12:20] alar praying to the
[3:12:23] Lord and then the Lord covers all those
[3:12:25] weak points praise the name of
[3:12:28] our David
[3:12:30] say when I knew that I'm going to I was
[3:12:34] when
[3:12:36] I there are people got the presence
[3:12:39] of but they don't know why they have
[3:12:41] come in the
[3:12:43] Pres Prophet says when you go into the
[3:12:45] church keep
[3:12:48] hum
[3:12:50] yourself the S leer
[3:12:53] comes and then starts the but when he
[3:12:56] not yet your life now meditate
[3:13:01] upon that God
[3:13:03] can that time when you're waiting on the
[3:13:06] Lord praise the name
[3:13:08] of it's not good for a person to go to
[3:13:10] the church then you start creting one
[3:13:15] another or doing things of
[3:13:18] conversation it's not good if you read
[3:13:21] the
[3:13:24] message some people don't have phones
[3:13:26] others
[3:13:28] have but for us we use that
[3:13:31] opportunity for us who don't
[3:13:35] haveon as we've been told at the
[3:13:38] [Music]
[3:13:41] beginning there were no phones there
[3:13:43] there were no messages
[3:13:45] that so for don't have any
[3:13:49] excuse we have many message books to
[3:13:54] read if you have a message book get it
[3:13:56] and
[3:13:57] read if you have a t
[3:14:03] listen instead of spending all the time
[3:14:05] on the phone on things which don't
[3:14:07] help praise the name of our
[3:14:13] Lord Jesus said that if your right eye
[3:14:16] stumble you PL it out praise the name
[3:14:22] of if there's something stumbling you
[3:14:25] from going
[3:14:27] forward you better remove it say that
[3:14:30] you get eternal life hallelujah amen
[3:14:33] praise the name of our
[3:14:35] Lord I Thank that he has done good to
[3:14:39] us I than God has given us
[3:14:43] opportunity because of the service we've
[3:14:45] had today
[3:14:47] I wanted to share with you my
[3:14:49] testimony to share with you the
[3:14:57] word but as I said in Romans 12
[3:15:01] verse every day I read Romans 12 it
[3:15:04] becomes new
[3:15:05] to but whenever I see
[3:15:08] it that scripture comes back to
[3:15:12] me the spirit tells me don't be like the
[3:15:15] world
[3:15:18] there's some woman I saw
[3:15:21] Ina she actually split her
[3:15:24] tongue She split
[3:15:27] her whenever she goes to eat she removes
[3:15:30] the
[3:15:32] pen when she finishes eating she puts
[3:15:35] back
[3:15:39] the then I remember said don't be like
[3:15:42] those people of the world
[3:15:47] and you know women have bleached up
[3:15:48] themselves until they were becoming too
[3:15:52] brown but even if all those things they
[3:15:55] just take you to Hell praise the name of
[3:15:58] our
[3:15:59] Lord you beat stay with the word of
[3:16:02] God and then the Lord will your
[3:16:05] hallelujah
[3:16:12] amen God has healed my children last
[3:16:14] year and even this year
[3:16:19] there was my child who who had a
[3:16:22] prostate
[3:16:26] problem then he called
[3:16:31] me
[3:16:33] hospital they treated
[3:16:36] us but there's a
[3:16:38] message which I
[3:16:42] read which says why cry speak
[3:16:47] the prophet was
[3:16:51] saying when you go to a doctor and they
[3:16:53] that you have
[3:16:55] cancer don't just take it
[3:16:58] like reject that thought and just take
[3:17:01] it to
[3:17:06] God do you continue going not saying
[3:17:08] that I don't have that
[3:17:11] cancer somebody tells you're not going
[3:17:13] to leave this
[3:17:14] place you continue moving
[3:17:18] so when were in the
[3:17:20] hospital then he said that your child is
[3:17:22] sick with
[3:17:25] prostate then I remember
[3:17:29] that then I remember the prophet said
[3:17:31] why
[3:17:33] Christ we started
[3:17:36] praying it was the month of
[3:17:41] July they spent four days in the
[3:17:43] hospital
[3:17:47] so he had swollen and then he was all
[3:17:49] brown
[3:17:51] rather all the body was swollen
[3:17:55] up when we
[3:18:02] prayed and then again they started
[3:18:04] asking that why is the child started
[3:18:08] changing then they told us you go and
[3:18:10] check the
[3:18:12] K they said we thinking we're going to
[3:18:14] spend here two months when they checked
[3:18:17] the
[3:18:18] kidney then they found that the problem
[3:18:20] was
[3:18:22] reducing then I told them you better
[3:18:24] release
[3:18:27] us then the doctor said we can't relase
[3:18:29] you in
[3:18:30] this we have just spent there three days
[3:18:33] said you
[3:18:34] wait when it came in the
[3:18:37] morning or the child was no
[3:18:41] more and I told the doctor release us
[3:18:45] and then he released us we came back
[3:18:48] home all that
[3:18:50] time I was reading the
[3:18:52] message the prophet was
[3:18:55] saying there's a woman he prayed
[3:18:58] for after praying for
[3:19:01] her then he told that go back they check
[3:19:05] you and then they you come and tell
[3:19:08] me when the woman
[3:19:11] went she found that she was healed
[3:19:14] already then I said
[3:19:17] let us take the child back so I took the
[3:19:20] child
[3:19:21] back then the doctor
[3:19:24] asked what treatment do you give this
[3:19:27] child and then I was very happy when he
[3:19:30] asked me
[3:19:31] that then I praised the
[3:19:34] Lord then he wrote to me then I came
[3:19:38] back with
[3:19:39] it and when the Lord had heal the child
[3:19:45] completely I have was doing senior
[3:19:50] 4 and then started that
[3:19:53] hicup at
[3:19:56] school and he almost passed away they
[3:19:59] gave him all the
[3:20:00] medicine when he came back
[3:20:03] home when him to go back
[3:20:06] home we laid hands on him and prayed for
[3:20:09] him and then
[3:20:11] it that same day he went back to
[3:20:14] school de Master said go back you are
[3:20:17] still sick say I'm already
[3:20:26] healed the master said the child was
[3:20:28] very bad because took a Jer of
[3:20:31] about just within three
[3:20:33] days but the child was
[3:20:40] healed now my last son of two years
[3:20:47] that come for a meeting which was
[3:20:49] decided around
[3:20:52] November when brother Tim
[3:20:55] came when we went
[3:20:59] back the child was speaking so
[3:21:02] well but we reached home when the child
[3:21:05] was D was not talking at all was
[3:21:10] only when you tell him give me water
[3:21:13] just go to the Jer
[3:21:19] so I called the brother that my child
[3:21:21] cannot speak
[3:21:23] anymore then we
[3:21:25] prayed then we
[3:21:28] prayed I went to the
[3:21:32] hospital then they told me he must have
[3:21:34] been too sick and so the nervous system
[3:21:37] was
[3:21:40] affected then I went into the
[3:21:45] message saying that you better continue
[3:21:48] praying why do you
[3:21:50] Christ the one God you serve is we pray
[3:21:54] to the
[3:21:55] Lord now the child has been
[3:21:59] restored and all the Village People and
[3:22:01] the neighbors say if that child will
[3:22:08] speak we shall know that your God
[3:22:12] is but when we had left
[3:22:15] that they sent a Coke to come
[3:22:23] home but the way they had worked on it
[3:22:27] when it comes at
[3:22:29] night and then start standing
[3:22:32] around as
[3:22:34] if then it work goes in the
[3:22:38] morning so one time my wife followed
[3:22:43] it it went into
[3:22:47] the neighbor's
[3:22:48] house when they had got they were
[3:22:51] speaking
[3:22:52] words but every day would come
[3:22:55] back when I knew
[3:22:58] that I got
[3:23:00] that I'm the one who bought with my
[3:23:04] money if there are any demons in
[3:23:07] you you know at night it was strange
[3:23:10] what was
[3:23:13] happening I I command you to walk
[3:23:17] and then the the coke
[3:23:20] turned and then
[3:23:22] stood I told him you better start
[3:23:26] walking it was at night around
[3:23:30] 9 and then I did when the children
[3:23:33] are the coke
[3:23:36] walked I said if there is any demon in
[3:23:39] you I command it to
[3:23:41] leave in the
[3:23:43] morning the coke moved
[3:23:48] properly he
[3:23:49] went it never came
[3:23:51] back then for us we left to come in
[3:23:55] these
[3:23:55] meetings when we went
[3:23:58] back the child was not
[3:24:01] speaking we said we've never produced a
[3:24:05] death the child was speaking
[3:24:07] before why does he do such a
[3:24:10] thing and then just
[3:24:13] remember Satan was still fighting when
[3:24:16] you go into the
[3:24:17] ministry then the devil gets a word to
[3:24:20] attack
[3:24:20] you that you leave what
[3:24:23] you're then but the prophet said
[3:24:26] continue moving
[3:24:29] forward whatever challenge
[3:24:31] comes or whether it is on the or in your
[3:24:35] business or your wife or
[3:24:38] husband just
[3:24:40] ra don't cry but speak
[3:24:46] from the
[3:24:47] beginning there was the word even now we
[3:24:50] have the
[3:24:52] word speak the word don't
[3:24:56] cry in concluding I want to thank
[3:25:01] God for this church and
[3:25:05] Ministry you stood a lot with the church

[3:25:51] is who don't allow to cut off
[3:25:55] hair I tell them it's not us who refuse
[3:25:57] but it's the Bible which
[3:25:59] refuses may God bless you so
[3:26:02] [Applause]
[3:26:06] much amen praise the name of our
[3:26:09] Lord do you appreciate that testimony
[3:26:13] [Applause]
[3:26:18] amen we thank God for what he's doing in
[3:26:20] our
[3:26:23] mid praise the name of our
[3:26:32] Lord do you appreciate our
[3:26:38] brother there are very many things he
[3:26:40] didn't talk
[3:26:42] about which he didn't talk
[3:26:45] about praise the name of our Lord but
[3:26:48] the Lord has been so
[3:26:51] gracious praise the name of our Lord you
[3:26:54] know when he went
[3:26:56] to and then after he had prayed for that
[3:27:01] Pastor who was backing like a
[3:27:06] dog and then the people
[3:27:09] believed so the following day when he
[3:27:13] was baptizing people
[3:27:17] a white bir came
[3:27:20] down and then it stood on the water
[3:27:23] where I was
[3:27:24] baptizing and then he was wondering what
[3:27:27] this is and he said if this is evil
[3:27:32] power May It Go in the name of Jesus
[3:27:34] Christ but if it is God manifesting

[3:43:20] today praise the name of the Lord maybe
[3:43:23] just before we go
[3:43:25] out praise the name of the Lord Brother
[3:43:28] Peter was
[3:43:32] in and then where I was staying was
[3:43:34] witnessing to seven
[3:43:37] people so when they received the the
[3:43:40] truth they went the following day for
[3:43:43] baptism using Mot
[3:43:45] CES about a distance of 30
[3:43:50] km and unfortunately when they were
[3:43:52] coming
[3:43:54] back there was a truck coming and there
[3:43:56] was a lot of
[3:43:59] dust so the
[3:44:01] rer went head on on on the
[3:44:07] track so the the the the motorcycle who
[3:44:11] was the motorcycle was riding him
[3:44:17] he
[3:44:18] died then was in the
[3:44:21] middle so the person who was behind
[3:44:25] him he broke the leg I think it's the
[3:44:28] leg the one who was riding
[3:44:32] motorcycle brother
[3:44:34] Peter they took them to
[3:44:37] hospital and then you know he was having
[3:44:39] chest
[3:44:41] pain and then the other one the one was
[3:44:44] behind him was
[3:44:46] baptized and then he was saying even if
[3:44:48] I die
[3:44:50] now I've
[3:44:52] taken but unfortunately the one who was
[3:44:55] riding the motorcycle for him it was
[3:44:57] just on his
[3:44:59] business he didn't receive the baptism
[3:45:02] so he died in repentant
[3:45:05] sinner but then God protected brother
[3:45:09] Peter that he never broke anything in
[3:45:12] his body
[3:45:15] but he was feeling chest
[3:45:17] pain so when he went to the HOA
[3:45:20] hospital they scanned him and then they
[3:45:23] found there was some blood collected
[3:45:25] outside the heart
[3:45:28] somewhere and then they said it was
[3:45:31] shock and then they told him that one is
[3:45:33] going to be heal they gave him
[3:45:36] medicine and God protected him like that
[3:45:39] but you can see the protection of
[3:45:41] God in front of you the person has died
[3:45:46] then behind you the person has broken
[3:45:48] their leg and then you see the hand of
[3:45:50] the Lord praise the name of so we always
[3:45:54] need to continue praying for the people
[3:45:55] go out in the
