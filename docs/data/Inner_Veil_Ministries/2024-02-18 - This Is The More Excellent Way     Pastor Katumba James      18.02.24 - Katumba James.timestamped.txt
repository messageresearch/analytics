[14:57] the name of the Lord and that should be
[14:59] our
[15:01] confidence praise the name of our Lord
[15:03] you know
[15:08] brother who came here at the beginning
[15:10] of this year from
[15:12] Zimbabwe we first had the meeting in
[15:16] May and then he preached for 4
[15:20] hours and he was preaching about
[15:24] money what the Lord Jesus talks about
[15:27] money
[15:29] and there is the way I had not looked at
[15:31] these
[15:33] scriptures the way he brought them and
[15:36] then you know there are many scriptures
[15:39] actually when the Apostles of when the
[15:42] Disciples of John came to
[15:45] Jesus when John had sent them find out
[15:47] is he the
[15:49] one then Jesus told them go and tell
[15:54] John that the blind
[15:57] see the lamb
[16:00] walk the deaf
[16:02] here the dead are
[16:05] raised and to the poor the gospel is
[16:10] preached now when you are
[16:12] blind what you need is to see and the
[16:16] Lord was doing it when you are dead what
[16:20] you need is to rise up and the Lord was
[16:24] doing it when you are
[16:26] lame what you need is to walk and the
[16:30] Lord was doing it when you are deaf what
[16:33] you need is to hear and the Lord was
[16:36] doing it when you are dump what you need
[16:40] is to speak and the Lord was doing it
[16:43] but when you are
[16:44] poor he didn't give them
[16:48] money he gave them the
[16:51] gospel praise the name of our Lord and
[16:54] the Bible says let the poor
[16:57] say I am rich praise the name of the
[17:01] Lord so you shouldn't be
[17:05] unhappy because you don't have money
[17:08] because you don't have school Fe but be
[17:10] happy because you have the Lord in your
[17:13] heart praise the name of our Lord and
[17:15] the Lord will take care of every
[17:19] situation and the Bible says let the
[17:22] weak
[17:23] say I am strong let the poor say I am
[17:28] rich
[17:29] praise the name of our lord it's very
[17:32] interesting praise the name of our Lord
[17:35] and you see when poor people live longer
[17:36] than sometimes richer
[17:39] people praise the name of our Lord but
[17:43] then we are bothered I don't have money
[17:45] I don't have job my plants are not doing
[17:48] well my animals are not doing well and
[17:52] then you have a lot of stress for the
[17:53] things of this
[17:55] world so just be happy in the Lord
[18:00] praise the name of our so we want to
[18:02] receive all the visitors who have come
[18:03] here for the first
[18:07] time amen is there somebody coming here
[18:10] for the first time if you just raise up
[18:11] your
[18:13] hand that recogize you yeah there is a
[18:17] sister somebody behind there you're
[18:19] welcome happy to have you
[18:23] around so our pastor is not around
[18:26] today he went to Nairobi yesterday
[18:29] so we just keep him in our
[18:32] prayers praise the name of our Lord and
[18:35] then
[18:36] also we want to appreciate those to come
[18:38] for the midweek
[18:41] services and just want to encourage
[18:43] every one of
[18:45] us let us keep on coming praise the name
[18:48] of our Lord yesterday we had praying and
[18:51] fasting and I want to appreciate those
[18:53] who able to turn
[18:55] up this coming
[18:57] Friday going to have the
[19:00] overnight praise the name of our so
[19:02] again come and we pray
[19:04] together praise the name of then on
[19:07] Wednesday last week we had more of a
[19:10] prayer
[19:13] meeting and then we just want so we can
[19:16] make more Wednesdays into prayer
[19:20] meetings preaching for 30 minutes but
[19:23] most of the time is
[19:26] dedication praise the name
[19:29] we just how much time we can yield to
[19:31] the
[19:33] Lord and you know on that
[19:36] Wednesday that's the day they referred
[19:38] brother Isaac to Mango
[19:44] hospital and he's still in mango
[19:48] hospital but his condition is not
[19:51] pleasing yesterday they put him on a
[19:54] life support machine up to
[19:57] now
[20:07] Andis that's for two times
[20:11] now his heart and kidy kind of like
[20:17] malfunctioning so IAL to sister betri
[20:20] this
[20:21] morning and she likewise appreciates you
[20:23] for your
[20:25] prayers and request to continue praying
[20:27] for them
[20:29] they found that the heart and the lungs
[20:31] are you know in the in the ordinary
[20:34] man's language they are sitting in
[20:40] water and then they found that there is
[20:42] carbon oxide in the
[20:47] lungs yeah so now the issue of removing
[20:50] from a life support machine to take is a
[20:57] challenge
[20:59] is feeding through the
[21:01] tubes and then now she was telling me
[21:04] that they may have to ref again
[21:08] to praise the name of but remember on
[21:12] Wednesday when you read in the book of
[21:15] Acts when James had been
[21:19] killed and then Herod saw that it was a
[21:22] good political tool to kill even
[21:27] Peter if you read in Acts 12 that's what
[21:30] we're sharing on
[21:32] Wednesday so Herod was determined to
[21:35] kill
[21:37] Peter and he arrested him and put a
[21:40] number of gods
[21:42] arounder but the Bible says prayer was
[21:46] made without
[21:48] ceasing of the Church of God for
[21:52] Peter because Herod was determined to
[21:55] kill
[21:56] him he was already
[21:58] prison and then he at the church
[22:01] continually prayed for
[22:04] Peter until now the angel came and
[22:07] delivered
[22:09] Peter and then the angel told
[22:12] Peter go and tell them and show yourself
[22:17] to them so it is until they saw
[22:20] Peter that they stopped praying and it
[22:23] should be the same thing with us now
[22:26] praise the name of until we brother
[22:28] Isaac back in church we shouldn't stop
[22:31] praying for him praise the name of our
[22:34] Lord that should be this burden we have
[22:36] on our heart Lord deliver our brother
[22:39] Lord restore our brother and the Lord is
[22:42] more than able to change
[22:44] things likewise
[22:47] brother the son of our
[22:51] brother he wants appreciate
[22:55] you brother wants to appreciate you for
[22:57] your prayer
[23:01] John's wife was able to give
[23:06] birth and now they dioniz because before
[23:09] they dioniz the child that some systems
[23:12] in the heart are not
[23:15] working but now they have found out that
[23:20] a section of the heart is not developed
[23:22] at
[23:25] all and so they don't understand the
[23:28] child is breathing or is
[23:32] alive I talk to John this
[23:35] morning they also still in mango
[23:38] hospital but then they are being
[23:40] referred to hospital to better manage
[23:43] that
[23:45] situation should also pray for that
[23:47] little son that the Lord May fully
[23:50] deliver him praise the name of our Lord
[23:54] and you know these things come that we
[23:56] can all stand up in prayer for
[24:00] praise the name of the Lord you know at
[24:02] least take some sleep
[24:05] away and then you say this time I'm
[24:07] praying for Johnny's
[24:09] son this time I'm praying for brother
[24:12] Isaac because if it is in your house
[24:16] you'll know how hard it
[24:18] is like the time sister B has been in
[24:21] hospital attending to the
[24:24] husband so we just need to have that
[24:26] kind of love for one another
[24:29] praise the name of our Lord so today we
[24:31] have an afternoon service for the
[24:34] Youth and then next time we shall have
[24:36] only one
[24:38] service praise the name of our Lord so
[24:41] now before we go into the reading of the
[24:44] word we have a dedication of a
[24:47] baby brother Ben's
[24:50] child that song bring them in as they
[24:53] bring the child
[24:55] forward amen bring them
[25:01] in bring them
[25:04] in bring
[25:08] them from the fields of
[25:13] s bring them
[25:17] in bring them
[25:21] in bring the wondering ones to Jes
[25:29] bring them in bring
[25:33] them Hallelujah bring them in oh yes
[25:40] bring them from from the fears of
[25:47] s bring them
[25:52] in bring them
[25:56] in bring
[25:58] [Applause]
[25:59] wondering ones to
[26:04] Jesus amen before we dedicate I always
[26:06] like reading this
[26:09] scripture that's Matthew chapter
[26:13] 19 from verse 13 to verse
[26:18] 15 praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[26:23] says there were brought unto him little
[26:26] children that he should to put his hands
[26:28] on them and pray and the disciples
[26:31] rebuked
[26:31] [Music]
[26:39] them but Jesus said suffer little
[26:42] children and forb them not to come unto
[26:45] me for of such is the kingdom of
[26:48] [Music]
[26:56] heaven and he laid his hands on them and
[27:00] departed
[27:00] [Music]
[27:02] them now we see that in the
[27:08] denominations they baptize little
[27:11] children but in the Bible there was no
[27:15] little child
[27:18] baptized praise the name of the Lord
[27:21] because for you to qualify to be
[27:24] baptized the Bible says You must hear
[27:27] the
[27:28] gospel this child cannot hear the gospel
[27:32] and when you hear the gospel you believe
[27:35] the gospel with your
[27:36] heart This Little Child cannot believe
[27:39] anything and when you believe the gospel
[27:42] with your
[27:43] heart that's in Romans chapter 10 and
[27:46] then verse 8 to verse
[27:48] 10 and then after you've believed the
[27:52] gospel you confess with your
[27:55] mouth this child can not confess
[27:59] anything but now in the
[28:01] denomination they bring an aunt and an
[28:05] uncle are the ones who confess for the
[28:08] child what a deception it is and then
[28:12] they Scar the
[28:13] mothers that if your child dies when
[28:16] they are
[28:18] young they are going to hell but the
[28:20] Lord Jesus is saying these little
[28:23] children of such is the
[28:26] kingdom
[28:28] then how are you putting them out of the
[28:30] Kingdom because the child is
[28:33] faultless in MTH
[28:36] 18 and then verse two it says and Jesus
[28:41] called a little child unto him and set
[28:44] him in the midst of
[28:45] [Music]
[28:49] them verse three and said V I say unto
[28:55] you except you be converted and become
[28:59] as Little Children You shall not enter
[29:02] into the Kingdom of Heaven
[29:09] [Music]
[29:14] nowo therefore shall not humble himself
[29:17] as little child the same is the
[29:20] greatest whoever therefore shall humble
[29:23] himself as this little child the same is
[29:25] greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
[29:33] now you see saying the children have no
[29:36] fault the kingdom belongs to them and
[29:40] then they are scaring parents that they
[29:42] are going to help if they not
[29:44] baptized that's just the deception of
[29:47] Satan as the little children
[29:51] are even when they pass
[29:54] on they are not going into any judgment
[29:56] or cond
[29:59] because the kingdom belongs to
[30:02] them praise the name of our Lord and
[30:04] that's why we are dedicating this little
[30:07] church
[30:09] [Music]
[30:14] amen this is
[30:17] Elijah the gift that the Lord has given
[30:20] the family of our brother Ben and
[30:25] sister let us pray father in the name of
[30:29] Jesus
[30:30] Christ here is Elijah who has been
[30:33] brought into your
[30:36] presence when our lord Jesus was here on
[30:39] Earth he laid his hands upon them and we
[30:44] therefore lay our hands Lord upon
[30:47] Elijah pronouncing your blessings upon
[30:50] his
[30:51] life in the name of Jesus Christ bind
[30:55] all forces and Powers of
[30:59] Darkness all plans of
[31:01] Satan that they may come again that may
[31:04] come against the life of this
[31:06] child we pray that Lord you may appoint
[31:09] your guardian angels upon his
[31:12] life to watch over his life Heavenly f
[31:16] as he grows up Lord father the coming of
[31:20] the Lord
[31:21] Tes we pray for the Salvation of this
[31:25] child that he may come to the know of

[32:45] to our
[32:50] Bibles we go in the book of First
[32:53] Corinthians chapter
[32:56] 12
[32:58] and then we're reading from verse 27
[33:00] verse
[33:06] 31
[33:12] 271 so the Bible
[33:16] says 1 Corinthians
[33:20] 12 verse 27 to verse
[33:25] 31
[33:27] praise the name of the
[33:30] Lord now you are the body of Christ and
[33:34] members in
[33:41] particular and God has set some in the
[33:44] church first apostles secondly prophets
[33:47] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[33:51] then Gifts of healings helps governments
[33:54] diversities of
[33:55] tongues
[34:18] having all gifts have all gifts of
[34:21] healing do all speak with Tong do all
[34:25] interpret but
[34:35] honestly the best gift and yet I show
[34:40] you a more excellent
[34:45] way verse
[34:54] 311 let us pray father in the name of

[35:58] them and father deliver them from any
[36:02] kind of

[36:09] back to their homes we love you Lord and
[36:12] we thank you in the name of the Lord
[36:15] Jesus and ask this amen you may be
[36:19] seated amen so I just want to use that
[36:22] scripture in verse
[36:25] 31
[36:27] which
[36:28] says yet I show unto you a more
[36:31] excellent
[36:35] way so I want to preach on the
[36:38] subject this is the more excellent
[36:43] way this is the more excellent
[36:48] way praise the name of the Lord you
[36:52] know it's just like when you are
[36:55] born you grow into
[36:58] something praise the name of the Lord
[37:01] and then at your
[37:02] maturity then you are able to bring to
[37:06] manifestation all that was inside of
[37:10] you the abilities that you
[37:13] had I want us to receive brother I'm
[37:16] sorry he a pastor
[37:19] in brother and's
[37:22] brother he was once here with us some
[37:25] years ago
[37:27] praise the name of our Lord we happy to
[37:29] have you around brother praise the name
[37:31] of our
[37:33] Lord and then there
[37:36] is Sister
[37:39] Edith you're also
[37:41] welcome
[37:44] amen so we are happy to be in the
[37:47] presence of
[37:48] God and I just request that you pay your
[37:52] attention praise the name of our Lord so
[37:56] the isas is a more excellent
[38:00] way praise the name of our Lord and you
[38:03] know in life you always aspire to do
[38:08] better praise the name of our Lord you
[38:11] always aspire to do to
[38:14] Excel or even then you see that even
[38:17] people who have some
[38:19] things they want to have
[38:21] more you know like I was reading some
[38:25] article sometime
[38:28] and then he said when you get a million
[38:30] do you admire the one who is having
[38:33] two so you want to increase one to two
[38:37] again when you reach two you want to get
[38:40] five when you get five to 10 and then
[38:44] you read about people who having now
[38:50] billions then you start wondering how
[38:52] you can reach there so there is that
[38:55] kind of urge in life of doing better
[38:57] than what I'm
[38:59] doing so here the Bible is telling us
[39:03] that there is a more excellent
[39:06] way you can have different gifts like
[39:10] now the Bible has talked
[39:12] about Apostles as the first gift and
[39:16] then he said secondly puts
[39:19] prophets thirdly puts
[39:21] teachers and then after Miracles then
[39:25] Gifts of healing
[39:27] then
[39:28] helps then governments and diversities
[39:31] of
[39:33] tongues and you know all these
[39:35] things are very good and then he says
[39:39] desire
[39:40] them and then we need to find
[39:43] ourselves what is our position in the
[39:46] body of Jesus
[39:49] Christ praise the name of our Lord what
[39:51] is your position in the body of Jesus
[39:54] Christ what are you serving in the body
[39:57] of Jesus
[39:58] Christ why has the Lord created
[40:01] you why are you still
[40:03] living praise the name of the Lord why
[40:06] has God put you here on
[40:09] Earth so then here he says when you get
[40:12] into the body of Jesus Christ there are
[40:15] gifts that he gives
[40:17] us but then he says we need to
[40:22] desire we need to see that we get into
[40:25] the more excellent
[40:29] way something which is more than all
[40:32] these kind of
[40:34] things now you may not be an apostle you
[40:38] may not be a prophet you may not be a
[40:40] teacher you may not be working miracles
[40:44] you may not be having maybe speaking
[40:45] tongues or interpretation of tongues but
[40:49] all of us should honestly
[40:52] desire the more excellent
[40:55] way more excellent way when we go to
[40:59] First
[41:00] Corinthians chapter
[41:03] 13 and then verse one the Bible says
[41:07] though I speak with the tongues of men
[41:10] and of angels and have not charity I am
[41:14] become as a sounding brass and a
[41:17] tinkering
[41:25] symbol
[41:34] and though I have the gifts of Prophecy
[41:36] and understand all Mysteries and all
[41:39] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[41:42] that I can remove mountains and have not
[41:46] charity I am
[41:55] nothing
[42:07] now you look at
[42:08] this these gifts God gives
[42:11] them he gives you speaking in
[42:15] tongues you can speak in the tongues of
[42:18] angels you can speak in the tones of
[42:21] men but then the Bible says if you don't
[42:25] have
[42:27] charity then you have become a sounding
[42:32] brass and a tinkling
[42:36] symbol so the Bible is telling us let us
[42:40] desire the more excellent
[42:43] way and then the more excellent way is
[42:47] Charity the more excellent way the
[42:51] love and the Bible says God is love
[42:56] and then the Bible says how do you say
[42:59] that you love God if you don't love your
[43:02] neighbor praise the name of the Lord so
[43:06] love is what the holy spirit is calling
[43:08] us upon this
[43:11] morning each of us should get that love
[43:14] in our
[43:15] lives get the love of God in your heart
[43:19] and when you have the love of God in
[43:20] your
[43:21] heart you will hate evil when you love
[43:25] the love of God in your heart you will
[43:28] love your enemies when you have the love
[43:30] of God in your heart you will love your
[43:33] children when you have the love of God
[43:36] in your heart you will love your parents
[43:39] when you have the love of God in your
[43:41] heart you will love your husband when
[43:44] you have the love of God in your heart
[43:46] you will love your you know your wife
[43:49] you will love your neighbors you will
[43:52] love your
[43:53] colleagues you will love strangers
[43:57] so now but you know the the kind of
[43:59] deception of Satan
[44:02] now is you can't become
[44:05] religious you can become
[44:07] religious and you know Satan allows you
[44:10] to be
[44:11] religious you can speak in Tong you can
[44:14] do Miracles or maybe you can preach a
[44:17] gospel or you can confess a message
[44:20] beli now if you don't have the love of
[44:25] God all in West it's all in vain so now
[44:29] the Bible is telling us there is a more
[44:34] excellent and the more excellent
[44:37] way charity the more excellent way is
[44:41] love each of us should have love in our
[44:45] heart and you should grow in
[44:49] love praise the name of our Lord the
[44:52] measure of your love may be
[44:54] small
[44:57] praise the name of the Lord if the
[44:58] measure of Love is
[45:00] bigger grow it praise the name of and
[45:04] you see when you look at the words of
[45:07] English the word
[45:09] more it means
[45:12] that but then he says
[45:15] excellent and excellent there's nothing
[45:17] Beyond
[45:19] excellent when you get 100% say
[45:23] excellent Excell but then he says more
[45:29] Excellence praise the name of Lord so
[45:32] you have to keep on
[45:35] growing in other words there is still
[45:37] room for you to
[45:39] grow there is need for you to surrender
[45:42] yourself more unto
[45:45] God praise the name of the Lord and you
[45:48] see the more you yield yourself to
[45:50] God the Bible says dra n to
[45:54] God and then God will draw n to you so
[45:59] the more you open your
[46:01] heart the more you grow into the love of
[46:04] God the more you grow the life of Jesus
[46:08] Christ and this is the desire of God for
[46:11] everyone of
[46:13] us now in verse three the Bible
[46:16] says 1 Corinthians 13:3 where have you
[46:21] been and though I best all my goods feed
[46:24] the poor and though I give my body to be
[46:27] burned and have not charity it profits
[46:31] me
[46:43] nothing praise the name of the Lord so
[46:47] you can
[46:48] imagine somebody can do charity
[46:54] work you know like these
[46:59] foundations yesterday I was in
[47:03] par and then and they were asking me it
[47:08] was were preaching
[47:13] to and then they were asking me we have
[47:16] many widows
[47:19] here does your church support
[47:23] widows then I told them
[47:26] we preach the word and I remember un the
[47:29] poor he gave the
[47:32] what the
[47:34] gospel because when you have the gospel
[47:37] will open those what you have need
[47:39] of praise the name of so now he says
[47:44] even if I best Goods to feed the
[47:48] poor and so I give my body to be
[47:53] burn and have not charity
[47:56] it pro me nothing and charity is
[48:01] God so you just need to have God within
[48:06] you to take over all your life and then
[48:09] verse for the Bible
[48:11] says charity suffers
[48:14] long and is kind charity EnV
[48:21] not charity V not
[48:24] itself
[48:26] charity is not puffed
[48:30] up see what charity is see what the more
[48:34] excellent way
[48:36] is
[48:38] Charity suffers
[48:40] long check your life I my
[48:45] patient oh every time you are
[48:49] off you know you just want ping
[48:53] pong when somebody speaks you sure that
[48:56] you hit
[48:58] back but the Bible says charity suffers
[49:03] long charity is
[49:07] kind find out yourself am I really
[49:11] kind do I really
[49:14] care charity EnV
[49:19] not you know that kind of jealous
[49:23] Spirit hatred
[49:26] you know
[49:28] Envy you don't desire something good for
[49:32] somebody and then the Bible says charity
[49:36] vth not
[49:39] itself you know is not
[49:42] bful is not want to be puffed
[49:46] up let everybody know who I
[49:49] am we need to strike the most excellent
[49:53] way does not behave s
[49:56] [Applause]
[49:59] unseemingly verse
[50:02] five seek not her
[50:06] own praise the name of the Lord is not
[50:09] easily
[50:11] provoked think no
[50:15] evil praise the name of the Lord thinks
[50:19] no
[50:22] evil may God be gracious to us
[50:27] someone does something
[50:30] bad it's not in your heart you need
[50:33] Grace praise the name of the Lord but
[50:36] the village some of us come
[50:39] from you find a gage for
[50:45] Generations the grandparent who had the
[50:47] other
[50:50] neighbor it's like between the Jews and
[50:52] the
[50:54] Palestinians from childhood they teach
[50:56] their
[50:58] children hate those Jews those Jews are
[51:02] bad we shouldn't have those kind of
[51:06] hearts and then sometimes it becomes so
[51:10] terrible that when the child hurts the
[51:17] parents the parents the thing they think
[51:20] about is curing the
[51:24] child
[51:26] why why is your Char for your
[51:33] child you will not have anything in
[51:35] future are you the father or the mother
[51:36] of that
[51:39] child why don't you bless your
[51:42] children why don't you bear with your
[51:45] children why don't you encourage your
[51:49] children so if you really have the love
[51:51] of
[51:53] God you say Lord have mercy upon my
[51:56] child Lord have mer upon my
[52:00] son you see there are those kind of
[52:04] grudges you know that people are not
[52:07] willing to
[52:10] live they ready to go in GRA with those
[52:19] gr
[52:20] why you are binding
[52:24] yourself you are failing to strike the
[52:26] more excellent
[52:28] way so you just need to leave all those
[52:33] grudges grud against your
[52:36] children grud against your
[52:38] parents and you know there are some
[52:41] children and they will talk bad about
[52:44] their
[52:46] parents and just make sure they don't
[52:49] help their
[52:51] parents that's not the way of the Lord
[52:55] and again you get to married
[52:57] people ah if my husband went with
[53:01] another
[53:04] woman no
[53:06] forgiveness and then he holds that
[53:08] Grudge
[53:11] there the Bible has told us there is a
[53:15] more excellent
[53:17] way praise the name of the Lord and
[53:19] admit and say Lord have mercy upon me
[53:23] Lord deliver me from this kind of Str
[53:26] they from this kind of
[53:28] hatred they from this kind of you know
[53:31] Str and
[53:34] bound praise the name of our Lord and
[53:37] then you allow God to release
[53:40] you praise the name of the Lord you look
[53:43] at the prodal
[53:45] son he took half of his
[53:47] [Applause]
[53:49] inheritance and then he went and wasted
[53:52] it withous living
[53:56] you know and then he after he had spent
[54:00] everything you know he cut off contact
[54:02] with the
[54:04] Father the father had worked hard to get
[54:07] these
[54:08] things but then the son wasted
[54:11] everything and went to a far
[54:14] country and started feeding
[54:17] swine and you know when the pigs would
[54:20] eat
[54:23] Huskers they would just
[54:31] can you imagine fall that child
[54:34] was but God was
[54:36] gracious that he remembered his
[54:40] father he said my father cannot mistreat
[54:43] me like
[54:44] that and there should be the same thing
[54:46] with
[54:47] us let your children have
[54:50] confidence that even when I've sinned so
[54:53] much against my father or my
[54:56] mother they can have an open door for
[54:59] me praise the name of the Lord and then
[55:02] you know in some
[55:03] families you know when maybe a child
[55:06] messes up they want to cast that child
[55:09] to the
[55:11] grandparents I'm not even paying your
[55:13] fees I'm not even doing this that one is
[55:16] still your
[55:18] child you have the
[55:21] responsibility to help that child until
[55:23] they succeed
[55:25] and that's the love of
[55:27] God praise the name of our Lord so the
[55:30] father didn't refuse the prod son when
[55:33] he was
[55:35] coming the Bible says when he saw him
[55:37] were far
[55:38] off he R
[55:41] to what an attitude we need to
[55:44] have he had
[55:47] compassion and we need to have
[55:48] compassion for one
[55:51] another don't hold on the
[55:54] grudges
[55:55] you all the time you are talking about
[55:57] that
[55:59] gra that gra it shouldn't be like
[56:02] that praise the name of the Lord have
[56:06] compassion have
[56:08] forgiveness so now the Bible says
[56:12] charity does not seek her
[56:14] [Applause]
[56:15] own you know you give your life over to
[56:19] another
[56:20] person and then charity rejoices not in
[56:24] iniquity
[56:27] but rejoices in the
[56:30] truth and the truth is the word of God
[56:34] and that should be where your joy is
[56:37] where your happiness is Charity Bears
[56:40] all
[56:41] things beli all things verse seven hopes
[56:45] all things endures all
[56:53] things
[56:56] charity never
[56:59] fath but whether there be
[57:03] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[57:06] be Tong they shall cease whether there
[57:10] be knowledge it shall
[57:13] vanish that's the more excellent
[57:16] way charity we need to seek
[57:20] charity if you don't have Love in Your
[57:22] Heart pray to God and say
[57:25] Lord fill me with your
[57:28] love praise the name of our Lord let
[57:31] your love come down in my
[57:34] heart excise that
[57:39] love praise the name of the Lord he's
[57:42] not saying I love
[57:44] you but there's no action there has to
[57:47] be action following your
[57:49] confession praise the name of our Lord
[57:52] now in first John chapter 4
[57:57] first John 4
[58:02] verse the Bible says
[58:06] beloved let us love one another for love
[58:11] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[58:14] born of God and knoweth
[58:23] God
[58:29] the Bible says let us love one
[58:33] another a more excellent
[58:36] way is love when you have the love you
[58:41] love one another and then the Bible says
[58:45] love is of God so if you want God in
[58:49] your life love one another praise the
[58:52] name of our Lord and then the scripture
[58:56] says he that
[59:01] loveth is born of God and knoweth
[59:06] God verse
[59:14] seven praise the name of the Lord the
[59:17] Bible says let us love one
[59:20] another for love is of
[59:23] God praise the name of in other words
[59:27] it's God that gives us
[59:31] love in other words you've opened
[59:34] yourself and you have allowed God to
[59:36] come and sit in your
[59:38] heart and then you are
[59:41] exercising the attribute of God
[59:44] himself even to the benefit of
[59:48] another and if God comes down in your
[59:51] heart praise the name of our Lord you
[59:53] will love
[59:55] you will
[59:56] forgive praise the name of our Lord you
[59:59] will not rejoice in doing
[1:00:01] evil you want to rejoice in the
[1:00:04] truth praise the name of our Lord and
[1:00:07] then he says he verse 8 he that love not
[1:00:11] knoweth not God for God is
[1:00:18] love now let us measure our knowledge of
[1:00:23] God how much much do you know God the
[1:00:26] Bible says if you don't love you don't
[1:00:29] know
[1:00:31] God so how much of God do you
[1:00:35] have it's expressed by your
[1:00:38] love if you have
[1:00:41] hatred that's not of
[1:00:43] God that is of
[1:00:45] Satan so now we need to grow in
[1:00:50] love we need to get a more measure of
[1:00:53] love in our lives
[1:00:56] praise the name of our Lord then in
[1:00:58] verse
[1:00:59] 9 in this was manifested the love of God
[1:01:02] towards
[1:01:07] us because that God sent his only
[1:01:10] begotten son into the
[1:01:17] world that we might live through
[1:01:22] him here in is
[1:01:27] love not that we loved
[1:01:31] God he loved
[1:01:34] us and sent his son to be the
[1:01:36] appropriation for our
[1:01:40] sins
[1:01:42] beloved if God so loved
[1:01:45] us we ought also to love one
[1:01:51] another no man has seen God at any time
[1:01:56] if we love one
[1:01:58] another God dwelle in
[1:02:01] us and his love is perfected in
[1:02:08] Us Praise the name of our Lord he says
[1:02:12] if God is in
[1:02:13] us then we love one another and this is
[1:02:17] what the Lord Jesus say by this shall
[1:02:20] men know that you are my
[1:02:23] disciples
[1:02:25] when you love one
[1:02:27] another so love is of
[1:02:29] God and love is
[1:02:32] God so how much of God do you
[1:02:36] have check your
[1:02:38] love praise the name of our now you know
[1:02:41] there are some things which are
[1:02:44] strange praise the name of
[1:02:46] our somebody can be friends with the
[1:02:51] neighbor but he not friends with his
[1:02:53] children
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:59] somebody can be friends with their
[1:03:03] colleagues but is not friends with the
[1:03:05] wife or the
[1:03:07] husband
[1:03:12] hypocrisy praise the name of the person
[1:03:15] you live
[1:03:19] with and then there is
[1:03:22] hatred there is enmity
[1:03:26] that's not of
[1:03:27] God praise the name of Lord you wish the
[1:03:30] other to
[1:03:33] die got a problem you are
[1:03:37] happy that's not of
[1:03:40] God praise the name of our Lord but we
[1:03:42] just need to allow God to come down in
[1:03:45] our
[1:03:47] hearts you know when God comes down in
[1:03:50] your heart he changes you he takes that
[1:03:55] bad mind or bad desire out of
[1:03:59] you he transforms
[1:04:02] you praise the name of our Lord the love
[1:04:05] of God
[1:04:07] himself comes down your heart that even
[1:04:11] you love your
[1:04:13] enemies you even love for you even love
[1:04:16] your bosses who who exploit
[1:04:20] you they don't pay your money you're not
[1:04:24] praying a problem to come upon them but
[1:04:27] you see you love them how about your own
[1:04:32] household praise the name of our Lord so
[1:04:35] we need to exercise the love of
[1:04:38] God and then the Bible says in John
[1:04:42] 14 and then
[1:04:47] verse Jesus said unto him I am the way
[1:04:51] the truth and the life no man comes unto
[1:04:55] the father but by
[1:05:07] meise the name of Lord so you need
[1:05:11] Christ in your life to exercise his
[1:05:16] love when Christ is not in your heart
[1:05:20] you will not have that love you will
[1:05:23] pretend but then you need Christ
[1:05:27] himself he says I am the
[1:05:30] way without Christ you can't find
[1:05:33] that I am the truth it is Christ himself
[1:05:38] so when you are in the way you will find
[1:05:40] the truth and then you get life and the
[1:05:44] Bible says Abundant
[1:05:47] Life the life of God
[1:05:50] himself the love of God being exercised
[1:05:55] in you praise the name of our Lord so
[1:05:58] you
[1:05:59] start by removing hatred from your
[1:06:09] heart stop those
[1:06:12] conf at least be ashamed to mention
[1:06:20] that praise the name
[1:06:23] of
[1:06:27] be ashamed to say
[1:06:29] that and when you
[1:06:31] ashamed then you remember I need to Love
[1:06:34] My
[1:06:35] Enemy and then there are people who hate
[1:06:38] others without any
[1:06:41] cause there is nothing somebody has done
[1:06:44] to
[1:06:45] them they
[1:06:48] hate they
[1:06:50] hate praise the name of the Lord you
[1:06:53] know we need not to have broken
[1:06:58] systems let us go to Jeremiah chapter
[1:07:02] 2 and then verse
[1:07:17] 13i the Bible
[1:07:22] says for my people have committed two
[1:07:24] evils they have forsaken me the Fountain
[1:07:27] of Living Waters and have held them out
[1:07:30] systems broken systems that can hold no
[1:07:52] water
[1:07:58] now these broken
[1:08:03] systems the Bible says they cannot hold
[1:08:06] any
[1:08:08] water you shouldn't be that kind of
[1:08:12] Christian who cannot have the spirit of
[1:08:16] God who cannot retain the spirit of
[1:08:19] God so the Bible is saying my people
[1:08:22] have committed two
[1:08:25] they have forsaken
[1:08:27] me the Fountain of Living
[1:08:32] Waters so when you don't have
[1:08:35] love you have forsaken the
[1:08:37] Lord because God is love and now the
[1:08:41] Bible says love one
[1:08:50] another the Bible says you have forsaken
[1:08:53] me the Fountain of Living
[1:08:56] Water now if you forsake the Fountain of
[1:08:59] Living
[1:08:59] wat then what are you going to
[1:09:03] retain praise the name of the Lord what
[1:09:05] are you going to
[1:09:07] contain how shall many know who you
[1:09:11] are and then the Bible says by this
[1:09:13] shall men know that you are my
[1:09:16] disciples if you love one another but
[1:09:19] then you have forsaken the Fountain of
[1:09:21] Living
[1:09:22] Water how are you going to be a
[1:09:25] well how are you going to to have water
[1:09:28] flowing
[1:09:30] through how how is it going to
[1:09:33] happen and yet when God makes you
[1:09:37] aware he also you know he also wants you
[1:09:40] to be giving
[1:09:42] out that's the principle of God when
[1:09:46] there is life in you that life must be
[1:09:50] manifested that life must also be tested
[1:09:52] by others
[1:09:54] it's not you saying I have life but
[1:09:57] there is no benefit to
[1:09:59] others praise the name of Allah Jesus
[1:10:02] was telling the woman at the
[1:10:05] word that the Living Water that I give
[1:10:08] you shall also be a well shall be
[1:10:13] springing up to life in John chapter
[1:10:22] 4
[1:10:24] and then verse
[1:10:26] 14 but soever drink of this water that I
[1:10:30] shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:10:33] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:10:36] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:10:40] everlasting
[1:10:52] life
[1:11:05] praise the name of our Lord he says he
[1:11:07] gives you that
[1:11:09] water the living water and then the
[1:11:12] Living Water becomes a
[1:11:16] spring and then that Springs keeps on
[1:11:18] flowing out flowing out praise the name
[1:11:23] of
[1:11:24] and that's what we need the life of
[1:11:26] Jesus Christ himself to come down in us
[1:11:30] and when you have the Life of Christ it
[1:11:33] will keep on flowing
[1:11:35] out like Psalms
[1:11:37] 1 the Bible says blessed is the
[1:11:40] man who does
[1:11:43] not praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:11:45] go and pick that scripture
[1:11:48] there Psalms
[1:11:51] 1 and then verse one
[1:11:59] blessed is the man that walks not in the
[1:12:01] C of the ungodly nor stand in the of
[1:12:04] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:12:19] scold the Bible says he does not to
[1:12:24] walk in the Cel of the
[1:12:28] ungodly the ungodly will never
[1:12:32] forgive they don't have anything like
[1:12:34] forgiveness in
[1:12:36] their until the Bible
[1:12:38] says that the tender masses of of an
[1:12:42] evil
[1:12:44] person is
[1:12:52] Cru
[1:12:56] and
[1:13:01] then and the Bible says The Tender
[1:13:05] Mercies of the wicked person is to
[1:13:09] well for you see spping is so
[1:13:13] cruel but this man Sayes have forgiven
[1:13:15] him I would have even killed him now the
[1:13:19] Bible is telling us you don't stand in
[1:13:22] that cel
[1:13:25] of the
[1:13:26] ungodly you don't stand in the C of
[1:13:30] Revenge you don't stand in the C of
[1:13:33] envy you don't stand in the C of
[1:13:37] hatred you take hatred from this
[1:13:40] generation to the other
[1:13:44] generation until some
[1:13:51] people I don't want made da Mar in that
[1:13:55] family or in that you know there is just
[1:13:59] that kind of ungodly
[1:14:02] C because they saw somebody do
[1:14:06] this only one person is a conclusion to
[1:14:10] condemn
[1:14:12] all the Bible says you don't stand in
[1:14:15] that
[1:14:16] c and you don't stand in the way of
[1:14:21] sinners in other words
[1:14:23] you are not following what they are
[1:14:26] doing praise the name of the Lord you
[1:14:29] don't take that as your
[1:14:37] stand I also do that's not the word of a
[1:14:41] Christian then the Bible says they don't
[1:14:44] sit in the seat of the
[1:14:52] scornful how to pick on
[1:15:01] this until people make decisions on
[1:15:07] rumors this one oh no and then there are
[1:15:12] those who know how to make
[1:15:15] rumors and they
[1:15:22] experts
[1:15:27] the news have moved
[1:15:29] everywhere we shouldn't sit on the seat
[1:15:31] of the
[1:15:33] SC praise the name of our Lord for you
[1:15:36] what what the hot news is H this has
[1:15:41] happened should not be our purpose if
[1:15:44] you know somebody has done something
[1:15:46] wrong take that in prayer and say Lord I
[1:15:50] Saw sister son so do I son so do this
[1:15:55] Lord have mercy
[1:15:56] upon and don't take that as a
[1:15:59] ground to put another person
[1:16:03] down praise the name of the Lord now the
[1:16:06] Bible says in verse
[1:16:07] two but his
[1:16:12] Delight is in the law of the
[1:16:16] Lord praise the name of our Lord your
[1:16:19] Delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:16:23] and then if you Delight in
[1:16:27] something you take time in that
[1:16:31] thing praise the name of our Lord you
[1:16:34] take time because you Delight in the
[1:16:37] word of
[1:16:38] God you meditate upon the word of
[1:16:42] God day and
[1:16:46] night so you don't
[1:16:49] Delight to sit in the seat of the
[1:16:52] scornful
[1:16:55] other if you sit in the seat of
[1:16:58] the then you Delight
[1:17:02] inning you Delight in
[1:17:05] ruming but if that is your
[1:17:08] weakness say Lord have mercy upon me
[1:17:12] Lord deliver me from this kind of
[1:17:13] situation Lord change me praise the name
[1:17:17] of our Lord so we need to Delight in the
[1:17:20] word of the
[1:17:21] Lord you hear the word
[1:17:24] you think about the word you meditate
[1:17:27] upon the word when you hear the word of
[1:17:30] God it will change your
[1:17:33] thinking when it changes your
[1:17:36] thinking when your enemy comes and
[1:17:39] you've been meditating upon the word of
[1:17:41] God you remember the word of God says
[1:17:45] love your
[1:17:47] enemies and now if the devil was
[1:17:49] bringing something to do bad about
[1:17:52] him
[1:17:54] the word said I should love my
[1:17:56] enemy now the devil can now come and
[1:17:58] tell you maybe speak bad
[1:18:01] things then you remember
[1:18:04] Ah that's not
[1:18:06] right and then the devil can tell you ah
[1:18:09] let me do this bad
[1:18:11] thing no that's not right so when you
[1:18:15] take the word of
[1:18:17] God it changes your thinking it changes
[1:18:21] your speech changes your
[1:18:24] action and so as you keep on
[1:18:29] yielding the word of God will bring you
[1:18:33] into the maturity of
[1:18:35] that and when you get into the maturity
[1:18:38] of the
[1:18:39] world then you are striking a more
[1:18:42] excellent
[1:18:43] Way You Are

[1:18:55] Flowing it keeps on washing that that
[1:18:58] away it washes away head it washes our
[1:19:02] evil imaginations it washes our evil
[1:19:05] things it washes away all those things
[1:19:08] that are contrary to the world and then
[1:19:10] you find that when the clean water
[1:19:14] comes it comes inside when it is going
[1:19:18] out it is dirty but just keep allowing
[1:19:21] it flowing
[1:19:23] it will keep on kind of cleaning the
[1:19:28] channel it will clean your
[1:19:31] heart the other evil spirit of Envy the

[1:19:51] allow the Lord to take over your
[1:19:56] life praise the name of the Lord now in
[1:19:59] the message questions and
[1:20:02] answers I hope you get it it is in
[1:20:09] 1963 there's something I want to
[1:20:14] read questions and answers
[1:20:17] of March
[1:20:21] 24th
[1:20:23] it says rivers of
[1:20:28] water I don't know if you can type that
[1:20:30] rivers of
[1:20:41] water rivers of water
[1:20:47] sea same
[1:20:51] water
[1:20:54] I'm trying to get it also on my phone
[1:20:57] now he
[1:21:04] says let us start from this
[1:21:07] way and then and like in the prayer for
[1:21:10] the
[1:21:12] sick that's all together
[1:21:16] different it is visions and
[1:21:20] things you study different
[1:21:24] and you are anointed
[1:21:26] different it's just like the Bible
[1:21:30] say a tree that's planted by the rivers
[1:21:34] of
[1:21:37] water rivers of
[1:21:43] water same
[1:21:46] water but there is Outlet Comes This
[1:21:50] Way while your outlet comes com this
[1:21:54] way there is this way and that way in
[1:21:58] other words it is the same
[1:22:03] spring but he has different
[1:22:08] Outlets praise the name of our Lord and
[1:22:11] so when you have the Fountain of Living
[1:22:14] Water it releases its
[1:22:18] attributes like the Bible says the fruit
[1:22:22] of the
[1:22:23] spirit let us go to Galatians chapter
[1:22:30] 6 let us go to the book of
[1:22:36] Galatians rather chapter 5 and verse 22
[1:22:39] says but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:22:44] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:22:48] goodness Faith weekness Temperance
[1:22:52] against such there is no
[1:22:55] law Galatians Galatians 5:2 and verse
[1:23:10] 23 oh God but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:23:14] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:23:20] goodness faith
[1:23:23] meekness Temperance against such there
[1:23:25] is no
[1:23:28] law verse
[1:23:34] 22 verse 5 verse 5 Galatians 5 verse
[1:23:51] 22
[1:23:53] verse
[1:23:59] 23 so now you see it is the same Holy
[1:24:03] Spirit it is the same Fountain of Living
[1:24:06] Water but now when it goes into your
[1:24:12] system when it comes in your heart it
[1:24:16] will give an outlet of
[1:24:18] love to give an outlet of Joy give
[1:24:22] Outlet of peace to give an outlet of
[1:24:25] long suffering to give an outlet of
[1:24:28] gentleness to give an outlet of
[1:24:31] meekness an outlet of goodness an outlet
[1:24:35] of Fai an outlet of
[1:24:38] temperance same
[1:24:40] Fountain praise the name of our Lord and
[1:24:43] that's what we should always
[1:24:45] desire make me a
[1:24:48] fountain not a broken
[1:24:51] system which cannot retain anything but
[1:24:55] a fountain you know a broken
[1:24:58] system it can have it can have those
[1:25:02] things like
[1:25:04] frogs things there your system should
[1:25:08] not have those kind of
[1:25:10] things praise the name of our Lord now
[1:25:12] in the message broken
[1:25:14] systems he says be therefore perfect as
[1:25:18] your father in Heaven is
[1:25:21] perfect can you
[1:25:23] be because a perfect
[1:25:26] one represents
[1:25:29] us that Fountain is there every day
[1:25:38] fresh it is
[1:25:41] continuous it's a living
[1:25:44] Fountain even when the storms are so
[1:25:47] high it's a living Fountain and that
[1:25:50] that's which D desire
[1:25:52] you know have the spirit of God through
[1:25:55] in your life and now when the spirit of
[1:25:58] God is with a challenge of
[1:26:03] hatred the outlet of love will come
[1:26:07] out the spirit of
[1:26:09] hatred when bitterness come the spirit
[1:26:13] of God in you will come out with
[1:26:17] goodness to combat that
[1:26:20] bitterness when kind of fear and and
[1:26:23] unrest
[1:26:25] comes then the spirit of God will come
[1:26:28] out with that kind of
[1:26:31] meekness with that kind of
[1:26:33] gentleness it keeps on flowing out and
[1:26:37] that is the life of Jesus Christ that's
[1:26:40] the more excellent way that we need to
[1:26:43] desire in our Liv in the midst of the
[1:26:46] challenges you face at your place of
[1:26:49] work at your home let the fountain keep
[1:26:53] on
[1:26:54] flowing praise the name of our Lord let
[1:26:56] it not be a broken
[1:26:58] system let it not contain things that
[1:27:00] are wrong let it be a living
[1:27:04] Fountain and so the prophet says not
[1:27:08] some
[1:27:12] something but fresh every
[1:27:15] day washes away all my
[1:27:19] sins and he is that
[1:27:23] Fountain praise the name of our Lord you
[1:27:25] know a living
[1:27:27] Fountain has life in it we should also
[1:27:30] have Life of
[1:27:32] Christ and when we have the life of
[1:27:34] Jesus Christ let us manifest that
[1:27:38] life let it be manifested in us let it
[1:27:42] become alive in us praise the name of
[1:27:45] our Lord then he says now in
[1:27:48] closing I may say this anything
[1:27:52] different from this is broken
[1:27:57] systems and we will finally will and we
[1:28:00] finally lick
[1:28:07] out in
[1:28:09] it if you are putting all your
[1:28:13] hopes all your
[1:28:15] time and everything in one of those
[1:28:19] staged
[1:28:21] systems
[1:28:25] Jesus said they were broken
[1:28:29] systems they are
[1:28:31] broken they will lick out whatever you
[1:28:34] put in
[1:28:35] them you can't go any fur with them
[1:28:39] because they leak out for he is the only
[1:28:43] way to the
[1:28:45] truth the life and to Eternal joy and
[1:28:50] eternal peace he is the only one and the
[1:28:54] only one to that the inexhaustable

[1:29:31] pumping no
[1:29:33] pulling no
[1:29:35] joining no bailing just
[1:29:39] believing and resting that's what is he
[1:29:43] is to the
[1:29:45] believing like Father
[1:29:48] Abraham he never
[1:29:50] pulled he never
[1:29:52] threatened he never worried he heard the
[1:29:56] word he laid upon El Shad
[1:30:03] bre when Abraham was 100 years
[1:30:06] old God appeared to
[1:30:10] him and said I am the
[1:30:15] almighty the Hebrew word
[1:30:18] El means the blessed one
[1:30:23] and you are
[1:30:25] old and your strength is gone
[1:30:28] out but let upon my
[1:30:32] bosom and enance your strength from this
[1:30:37] Fountain amen what did himself
[1:30:42] to a a new
[1:30:45] body he had the baby by
[1:30:48] Sarah and 50 years later had seven
[1:30:51] children by
[1:30:53] another that's what we need to depend
[1:30:56] upon a living Fountain and when that
[1:31:00] fountain comes into you you also become
[1:31:02] a living Fountain you start flowing out
[1:31:07] and let the people see your good
[1:31:10] works and glorify the father who is in
[1:31:12] heaven we need to strive the more
[1:31:16] excellent praise the name of our Lord
[1:31:19] the more excellent way
[1:31:22] now it may have
[1:31:24] stages you know like for example when we
[1:31:27] go to John chapter
[1:31:29] 15 and then we read in verse
[1:31:32] one praise the name of our Lord John 15
[1:31:36] and verse
[1:31:38] one I am the True Vine and my father is
[1:31:42] the husband
[1:31:47] man every branch in me that beareth not
[1:31:51] fruit
[1:31:52] he taketh away and every branch that
[1:31:55] beareth fruit he pures it that it may
[1:31:58] bring forth
[1:32:10] more now you look at these stages here
[1:32:13] he says if you don't bear
[1:32:16] fruit he cuts it in other words you are
[1:32:20] in a bad condition
[1:32:23] you are scoring
[1:32:26] 0% you have not allowed the life to pass
[1:32:30] through but if you are planted in the
[1:32:34] vine if you are joined in the
[1:32:37] vine allow the life of the
[1:32:40] vine to flow through you and now when
[1:32:44] the life of the vine throw
[1:32:46] you the Bible says you bear
[1:32:50] fruit praise the name of the Lord allow
[1:32:53] that life to flow through you allow the
[1:32:57] word of God richly dwell in you and when
[1:33:02] the word of God is richly dwelling in
[1:33:05] youy that
[1:33:07] word follow that word and that's how
[1:33:10] that word will bear its own
[1:33:14] kind praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:33:17] if you are in the branch or if you are
[1:33:20] the branch and then you are
[1:33:23] joined and then you are joined to the
[1:33:26] vine allow the life of the
[1:33:29] vine flow through you and then when the
[1:33:33] life of the vine flows through
[1:33:35] you then you will bear fruit but that
[1:33:38] should not be the end the Bible says
[1:33:42] there is a more excellent way in other
[1:33:45] words there are more fruit to
[1:33:47] Bear praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:33:50] if you have allowed the life to flow
[1:33:52] through you then you bear
[1:33:55] fruit but then when you bear fruit the
[1:33:58] Bible say he PES
[1:34:02] you he cleans you he sanctifies you he
[1:34:07] rebukes you don't do this don't go in
[1:34:11] that kind of place stop those kind of
[1:34:14] evil what is he doing he is puding you
[1:34:18] he is cleaning you why because wants you
[1:34:21] to Bear more
[1:34:23] fruit you are bearing
[1:34:25] fruit but he wants you to Bear more
[1:34:29] fruit he's calling you to a higher
[1:34:32] level he's calling you to a more
[1:34:35] excellent
[1:34:36] level praise the name of our Lord each
[1:34:39] and every one of us the Lord is calling
[1:34:42] us to a higher level than what we are
[1:34:46] now praise the name of our Lord you can
[1:34:49] say me I don't hate anybody
[1:34:52] but the issue is do you love
[1:34:55] everybody praise the name of the Lord
[1:34:57] I'm not guilty of hating
[1:34:59] anybody but yet you don't love
[1:35:02] everybody so he's calling you to a
[1:35:04] higher
[1:35:05] level come
[1:35:07] up praise the name of the Lord and then
[1:35:10] I will show you things that are going to
[1:35:12] happen and you know you can't when you
[1:35:14] are down
[1:35:15] here you can look at the trees
[1:35:19] here but when you go up
[1:35:22] you look at them better and when you go
[1:35:25] higher the the vision
[1:35:29] broadens praise the name of our Lord and
[1:35:31] that's what should be our
[1:35:33] desire higher higher every day living
[1:35:38] higher praise the name of the Lord more
[1:35:41] excellent way so he says if you bear
[1:35:44] fruites
[1:35:48] you you know some of this business the
[1:35:51] things that take your
[1:35:53] time yeah you know you are all the time
[1:35:56] on social
[1:35:59] media until even sleeping at night you
[1:36:11] don't there is a higher to live than
[1:36:14] that and then you find the whole week
[1:36:16] you've not read any message
[1:36:19] book week
[1:36:24] even the scriptures you don't
[1:36:27] know is it Jesus who said this or it is
[1:36:31] joh it doubt has already started coming
[1:36:34] in your
[1:36:36] mind and then the devil can start
[1:36:38] telling
[1:36:39] youh Jesus didn't die and then you can
[1:36:43] believe
[1:36:44] that why because your mind has been
[1:36:47] taken away from the
[1:36:50] truth the life is not
[1:36:53] flowing but now you talk about these
[1:36:56] programs on
[1:36:58] television you know there are some of
[1:37:00] those movies they
[1:37:02] put then they put the next one then they
[1:37:05] give you a
[1:37:06] preview and then maybe if you at home
[1:37:09] you start
[1:37:10] discussing I don't know what they are
[1:37:12] going to do I don't know how this is
[1:37:14] going to receive
[1:37:15] this where is the word of God what are
[1:37:18] you benefiting from that even those
[1:37:21] people don't know
[1:37:26] you just like the Sports
[1:37:29] World somebody will have a team he
[1:37:33] likes and then he will convince the
[1:37:36] other are going to buy the other one how
[1:37:39] much money have you put
[1:37:42] there and then he says the other time we
[1:37:46] didn't allow the other one to play they
[1:37:48] even don't know you but you're putting
[1:37:51] your time into
[1:37:56] the and then there is a time here in
[1:37:59] ginger I was moving to town and then I
[1:38:02] saw a vles in
[1:38:05] Convoy and then they had the flag of
[1:38:07] some team in Europe and they were busy
[1:38:09] moving on the
[1:38:11] streets that they celebrating because
[1:38:13] they want another
[1:38:15] team
[1:38:19] them actually brainwashed
[1:38:23] NE
[1:38:26] colonialism they can't even support
[1:38:28] their local teams
[1:38:30] like they can't support these teams
[1:38:32] which are here but the other ones there
[1:38:35] out they know
[1:38:37] them you how the devil
[1:38:40] place I was yesterday in a village a
[1:38:44] Countryside and then I was
[1:38:46] surprised there is there in the
[1:38:49] village and then they put European teams
[1:38:51] are
[1:38:53] play
[1:38:56] brainwashed so how are you going to Bear
[1:38:59] more
[1:39:00] fruit if you put your time in those
[1:39:04] things you don't have time to wait on
[1:39:06] the
[1:39:07] Lord you don't have time to seek the
[1:39:09] face of the
[1:39:10] Lord but the devil has put
[1:39:14] Alternatives and you know the devil is
[1:39:17] smart he puts
[1:39:20] alternatives you don't want to spend
[1:39:22] time on
[1:39:22] phone he puts there television you don't
[1:39:26] want that he puts there radio if you
[1:39:29] don't want that he put in the trading
[1:39:35] center or he put their sports
[1:39:38] betting so all these things are there to
[1:39:40] cheat
[1:39:42] you this one takes you other one Tak if
[1:39:46] you can't afford he puts also friends
[1:39:48] who can't
[1:39:50] afford and then you're going to
[1:39:54] L and you are just there
[1:39:56] busy because you may say I don't go to
[1:39:59] disco but there's something Satan has
[1:40:02] put around
[1:40:03] you so you can't bear
[1:40:06] fruit and then the Bible says he cuts
[1:40:09] off the
[1:40:11] branch you become
[1:40:13] dry praying at home is difficult reading
[1:40:17] the Bible you
[1:40:19] feel and you know there some
[1:40:21] people after church they forget where
[1:40:24] they put their Bible they remember on
[1:40:28] Sunday is my
[1:40:32] Bible and some of them have got new
[1:40:35] Bibles and it is still new for 5
[1:40:39] years don't read
[1:40:42] it they don't know where to find this
[1:40:45] book talking about the book of
[1:40:48] Nehemiah Isiah a book
[1:40:52] you know they just don't know where
[1:40:54] they're
[1:40:57] standing sometime has been put in
[1:41:01] something but when you ask that
[1:41:04] person who was the top
[1:41:06] scorer oh the other man his 23 years of
[1:41:10] age he was able to save this was able to
[1:41:15] this where is your heart now and the
[1:41:18] Bible says where are your Pleasures
[1:41:22] are that's where your heart but those
[1:41:25] things don't have
[1:41:26] life they have
[1:41:29] pleasure praise the name of our Lord
[1:41:31] there's a scripture you have just
[1:41:34] remembered in Luke chapter
[1:41:36] 8 and then verse
[1:41:39] 14 the Bible says and that which fell
[1:41:42] among the
[1:41:45] thores are they which have
[1:41:48] heard go forth and are chocked with the
[1:41:52] cares and
[1:41:59] riches and the pleasures of this
[1:42:02] life and bring no fruit to
[1:42:08] Perfection now you look at how the devil
[1:42:11] is also a
[1:42:14] strategist now the Lord is telling us if
[1:42:17] one doesn't bear cuts off
[1:42:21] but when you bear fruit he purges you
[1:42:25] and you bear more
[1:42:27] fruit praise the name of our Lord we
[1:42:30] shall get back to this scripture let us
[1:42:33] go back to John chapter
[1:42:35] 15 and then we read in
[1:42:41] verse verse
[1:42:45] four abide in me and I in you as the
[1:42:49] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:42:52] except it abide no more can you except
[1:42:55] you abide in
[1:43:10] me I am the vine and you are the
[1:43:14] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:43:18] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:43:22] for without me you can do
[1:43:35] nothing look at these four
[1:43:39] stages first of all no bearing
[1:43:43] fruit zero bad condition then the next
[1:43:49] stage you bear fruit but the
[1:43:54] master God himself he wants you to do
[1:43:58] better he wants you to
[1:44:01] excel from bearing fruit to bearing more
[1:44:06] fruit and there are things that he does
[1:44:09] in our
[1:44:11] lives to take us
[1:44:14] higher come up
[1:44:16] here you've been doing well but you know
[1:44:19] to do better than
[1:44:22] each and every one of us we do well to
[1:44:25] come to church but we need to do better
[1:44:28] to come in time to
[1:44:30] church praise the name of our Lord you
[1:44:33] do well to come to church on Sunday but
[1:44:35] you need to do better to come on
[1:44:38] Wednesday to
[1:44:39] church praise the name of our Lord you
[1:44:42] do well to come on Wednesday I don't
[1:44:44] Sunday but you also need to do better by
[1:44:47] coming also on
[1:44:49] Saturday coming for the overnight what
[1:44:52] is too busy for you that you deny God
[1:44:55] the
[1:44:56] time to power his living water in your
[1:45:00] life to refresh you and every time we
[1:45:04] come to church there is a refreshment of
[1:45:08] God something that encourages you
[1:45:11] something that lifts you
[1:45:13] up so the Lord is calling us to a higher
[1:45:17] level you be at
[1:45:19] 30% but you need to go to
[1:45:22] 60% You' been at 60% but you need to go
[1:45:25] to
[1:45:26] 100% that's what the Lord is calling us
[1:45:30] there is a more excellent way and we
[1:45:33] need to strive to get that way so the
[1:45:36] Bible is telling us if he doesn't
[1:45:39] bear cuts off if you bear fruit he pures
[1:45:44] you praise the name of the Lord when he
[1:45:47] pures you you bear more fruit
[1:45:51] and when you bear more fruit he says
[1:45:54] abide in me in other words deny
[1:45:59] yourself abide in me then I abide in you
[1:46:03] let the mind of God be in
[1:46:06] you the mind that was in Christ he
[1:46:10] offered
[1:46:11] himself he surrendered himself he
[1:46:14] allowed all God to pass through
[1:46:17] him and if we can also do the same then
[1:46:20] he says you'll bring much
[1:46:25] fruit from
[1:46:28] zero pray for
[1:46:31] grace then you bear
[1:46:33] fruit
[1:46:35] 30% he works upon you so that you bear
[1:46:39] 60% so that you bear more fruit when you
[1:46:42] bear more
[1:46:43] fruit you at
[1:46:46] 60% he wants you to get much
[1:46:54] too
[1:46:56] 100% there is a more excellent way
[1:47:00] praise the name of and now don't allow
[1:47:03] the devil to deceive
[1:47:05] you be involved in all the church
[1:47:10] programs praise the name of the Lord if
[1:47:12] the door has been open be there
[1:47:16] available and be faithful in your
[1:47:19] duty praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:47:23] go to Luke chapter
[1:47:25] 8 praise the name of our Lord Luke
[1:47:29] chapter
[1:47:31] 8 and
[1:47:35] then verse 15 verse
[1:47:41] 14 so he says and that which fell among
[1:47:45] the thorns a day which when they have
[1:47:48] heard go forth and and are chocked with
[1:47:51] the cares and riches and pleasures of
[1:47:54] this life and bring no fruit to
[1:48:15] Perfection now you know the devil is so
[1:48:19] evil
[1:48:21] and he a
[1:48:23] strategist you know he says
[1:48:28] cares now that is a stage of its
[1:48:32] own praise the name of our then another
[1:48:35] stage is
[1:48:38] riches that's a stage of its
[1:48:41] own and then another stage is
[1:48:44] Pleasures now you can't have
[1:48:48] Pleasures if they are disturbing
[1:48:53] you don't
[1:48:57] e you don't have you don't have enough
[1:49:00] money for
[1:49:11] Pleasures so you work
[1:49:13] hard and when you work hard you get
[1:49:18] riches but every stage has its own
[1:49:23] Temptations every stage has
[1:49:26] traps so because
[1:49:36] you and you know there are some of those
[1:49:43] people because I'm poor so he goes and
[1:49:45] gets where he can get and then he thinks
[1:49:48] after becoming rich he will come to
[1:49:53] praise the name of Lord the Bible says
[1:49:57] he that is faithful in the
[1:49:59] little is faithful in the much if you
[1:50:02] don't have and you're not faithful you
[1:50:06] think you'll be when you
[1:50:09] have so the devil puts all these kind of
[1:50:13] things now when you get the
[1:50:15] riches they getting
[1:50:19] Temptations there is this mind has come
[1:50:22] that mind has come now when you get the
[1:50:25] riches then another level is
[1:50:31] pleasur we have football this
[1:50:36] afternoon time is coming to one
