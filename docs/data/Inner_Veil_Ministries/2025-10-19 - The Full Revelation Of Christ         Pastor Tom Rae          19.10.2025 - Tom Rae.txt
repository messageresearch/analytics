[Music] One day. [Music] Life can have so many [Music] stand [Music] and Pharaoh is bearing down. I have no more to flee across. So I raise this hand of faith and I cry out, "Oh Lord, remember me [Music] when I'm down in the valley. Lord remember losing my way. I'm down on my knees, Lord. Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. &gt;&gt; When I'm down in the valley, &gt;&gt; Lord, remember my way. &gt;&gt; Remember I'm down on my knees, Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. [Music] Sometimes I take the wrong road and I let the devil know that when you cut my prayer, I'm as powerless as any man. And like Samson in the dancing, I'm blinded and scared. But I still cry out, "Lord, remember me. [Music] When I'm down in the valley, Lord, &gt;&gt; remember my way. &gt;&gt; I'm down on my knees, Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. Like h in the temple. &gt;&gt; Lord, remember us. &gt;&gt; Will you be blessed? Lord remember to live in a foreign distant land. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord remember me. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord the three remember in the dead of life. &gt;&gt; Lord remembering the money Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, when I'm down in the valley, Lord, &gt;&gt; remembering my way. &gt;&gt; Lord, remember down on my knees, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, remember me. Like the thief on the cross, I'm at the end of my road. But I know within my heart that my soul is a part of you. When the moon was there. When the stars of the morning sun. When you come into your kingom. Remember me [Music] like that thief on the cross. I'm at the end of my room. But I know within my heart that my soul is a part of you. I know that time was there when the stars of the morning sun. So when you come into your kingdom, remember me. Oh, when I'm down in the valley, Lord, remember &gt;&gt; losing my way. &gt;&gt; Oh, remember on my knees, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, remember me. like in the temple. &gt;&gt; Lord remember you blessed me. &gt;&gt; Lord remember the thing that God loves for a land. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord remember me like the three Hebrew children. Lord remember the day of life. Lord remembering God's harmon. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord remember me &gt;&gt; when I'm down in the valley. Lord &gt;&gt; Lord remember me. &gt;&gt; Sing my way. &gt;&gt; Lord remember my knees Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. Do we have the same cry this morning? &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me. Amen. Like the thief on the cross, just at the last minute, he realized &gt;&gt; that his name was on the love's book of life. &gt;&gt; God caused that man said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are certainly happy to be here. Are you happy to be in the presence of the Lord? Amen. We are very blessed people. Amen. When I say blessed, I mean blessed. Amen. Uh to have brother Tom Ray with us. [Applause] I've known brother Tom for almost 40 years. [Applause] One thing about me is I never lose friends. If you lose a friend, you've lost something. But if you gain you keep a friend, you got everything that that friend is. So we have everything that brother Tom is this morning. Amen. Just keep opening up the different tabs. Amen. Amen. and every point you will see a divine flow. Amen. Amen. So, uh he has proved to be steady ministry over years. He solidly stood behind his pastor for over 50 years before the Lord took brother Ed Bisco. &gt;&gt; I tell you that's being solid. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the dove leading the eagle. That ego could be fast, but he has to restrain himself. Amen. Could have run a little bit ahead, but he had that real anointing of the eagle that obeys the dove. Amen. God bless you, brother Tom. [Applause] Now he's the pastor of the work of Glodale Bible in Canada. All this work you see is this. Pastor Tim. [Music] Amen. [Applause] [Applause] So he's the man that has been standing behind all this work. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] for making time to come and be with us. We should value this [Applause] because his pastor just changed dimension the other day. [Music] He has just passed on to do with the Lord I think two three weeks ago. Amen. That's where the funeral service and everything were done. It takes somebody to love you. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] his brother Harold, I mean brother Becket &gt;&gt; from South Africa. &gt;&gt; He came two weeks after losing his daughter. [Music] We looked at it as a very great sacrifice and brother Tom this is a great sacrifice. [Applause] All things are possible when you believe this morning. enter is still a substance. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's not a need, it's a substance and your need can pull everything you have need of that dream [Music] into your possession. So as our brother ministers in your faith and pull whatever you have need of the Holy Spirit ministers to us this morning. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, [Applause] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] It is how we [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] might [Music] [Music] have a confession now. I love I [Music] love I hear [Music] all [Applause] I [Music] Now I love [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] We just bow our heads in a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father is precious. sacrifice they made to me in the house of God this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm a humble man. &gt;&gt; Humbled by their graciousness, [Music] humbled by their lives. Lord, could you take the bread this morning [Music] and we could have communion with Melzdc that you could feed our hungry souls, inspire our hearts to see only Jesus Christ. Lord, I just pray and commit now this morning service to you that thy will be done in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Good morning. Why don't you have your seats? &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful to be here with you. As our dear pastor has mentioned, we have known each other for a few years. [Music] boring or it is over &gt;&gt; and I &gt;&gt; I'm not a person that must be seen or heard preaching, but I realize the quality of men of God that God has given me. And you'll never know what you have &gt;&gt; until you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And I would like to give a rose to our our precious brother, Pastor Steven. [Applause] Another whenever our dear brother has been our way. And I can't can honestly say I know Jesus in a better way. &gt;&gt; That's very important. &gt;&gt; It's not to know about the message. It's to know him who is the message. [Music] And so I thank the quality of the word of God that our precious brother these many many years. And I want to thank the Lord Jesus. We often say at Cloverdale, &gt;&gt; Brother Visll said it When we hear men of God such as pastoral, &gt;&gt; he said Africa doesn't need missionaries. Africa does not need missionaries. America needs missionaries. And by the grace of God, you've sent a missionary to Cloverdale Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I'm not a flowery type of guy. But I &gt;&gt; But I mean that from the depths of my heart. We are privileged to walk with such caliber to meet is a great honor. &gt;&gt; And thus here we are. It took 40 years and we're here. In fact, I know the first time we ever had a meeting with a brother Steven realizes it or remembers it. We were sitting in our little hotel room and it was a missions meeting with brother Harold &gt;&gt; and that's the year I met brother Tim &gt;&gt; and brother Steven and they both are my best friends today. Amen. So we remember those times and he says why don't you come to Uganda &gt;&gt; brother Steven is shooting the big big gun shooting I was shooting [Music] big gun I was shooting a peashooter I'm still shooting a peashooter But we feel it dee and deem it a great honor to have my son Michael Ray with me. [Applause] [Music] I don't mean this in a derogatory way at all because I always felt honored he introduced as brother Biscoll's son-in-law. Not not brother Tom Ray. &gt;&gt; Not &gt;&gt; not brother Tom. It was brother Tom Ray &gt;&gt; is brother Eddie Bisco's son-in-law. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now I'm brother Michael's daddy. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; He's he's a great preacher. Oh, [Music] amen. And I feel honored to have my dear son. This is special. I'm going to drink it in if that's okay. &gt;&gt; I've heard about you. I've seen you on video. I've heard the reports of Brother Tim do. And over the years, all I've done is heard. [Music] But by the grace of God, I stand here. I can read the message. I have heard, &gt;&gt; but now I see. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that that is a reality. I I would love just to have you all around me and hear each one's testimony of how God came into your life and I always say if God had not sent a messenger, we would never have met. It's it's true. I wouldn't I've known your pastor &gt;&gt; and now new pastor. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have met you. &gt;&gt; Said, "Behold, send you." Amen. So God sent me Elijah. I can meet you, a part of my body. And I give God the glory this morning. that we could be together. We were once together in the thoughts of God, but now this season has come for the manifestation of the day. That scripture has been fulfilled. [Applause] This day is the manifestation of the sons of God. Not knowing the message Jesus Christ who is the message and that's why our burden is to get this message &gt;&gt; into your hands so that you can realize who you are in Christ. The opening of the seals, the opening of the seals was the very vehicle God used your name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Bless be the tithe that binds. [Applause] It's the blood that ties us together to God be the glory this morning, saints of God, his love and mercy to us. Amen. Again, I I I'm so thankful we've had this time. &gt;&gt; And so, if you don't mind, we'll stand. I must bring greetings from my wife, sister Joanne. Sorry, &gt;&gt; she loves sister Sarah. &gt;&gt; She said, "Am I coming?" &gt;&gt; I said, "No, honey. &gt;&gt; This is a quick trip. But one day, &gt;&gt; sister Sarah Sarah, &gt;&gt; if we can have the blessing to sit at your table, &gt;&gt; that will be a great day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you would uh turn please to Matthew. I'm &gt;&gt; I'm asking you to turn to Matthew 16. Is everybody okay? I now I'm looking way in the back. Is everybody in the back? All right. Matthew 16 verse 13. Such a simple scripture. Such a profound scripture. Without this scripture, there's no church. &gt;&gt; There's no church. All right, let's take a look at it. &gt;&gt; Matthew 16:13. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came into the coast of Cesariah, Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the son of man, am? [Music] And they said, "Some say thou are John the Baptist, some Elias, others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." Here is a key scripture. Amen. He said unto them, "To whom say ye that I am?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could you please read that with brother Emanuel? &gt;&gt; That's very, very key. And Simon Peter answered and said unto him, "Thou art the Christ." &gt;&gt; That's key, the son, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. Amen. And James answered, I'm sorry, and Jesus answered &gt;&gt; and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto you, but my father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, thou art Peter, &gt;&gt; and upon this rock &gt;&gt; will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Let's bow our heads, please. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we've read your word. Now, would you bring the revelation of that word into our hearts this morning as we approach you? Would you make it real to each and everyone saved by the Holy Ghost saved? &gt;&gt; I pray you'll reveal yourself to them. Ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. God bless you. I'd like to read a quote that I have been using over the last little while and it's out of the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said there is nothing of such prevailing power revelation of the word. And now I want you to just concentrate now on There's and I'll say I want to say it exactly how he said it. &gt;&gt; He said it's that simple. &gt;&gt; There is nothing of such prevailing power [Music] &gt;&gt; as a revelation of the word. Now we all sit here today by the revelation of the word. Is this not true? &gt;&gt; Is this not true? &gt;&gt; You're not here because you're getting a hand out. You're not here that somebody can better your life. You are here because Jesus Christ has allowed revelation to come your way. So that you can realize you can realize realize who you are in the word and to have that realization is great power. Now I know we we'll get into it. I'm sorry I move around but I'm I'm not stately like brother Steven. Every time brothers pastor Ivali Iwali preaches at Cloverdale, &gt;&gt; he stands here so nice and every word has a meaning and I look at that. &gt;&gt; I say someday I might be able to do that. So I'm I'm you know when unless I'm digressing right now &gt;&gt; so everybody understands there's different kinds of preachers when the wise men brought gifts to Jesus. One brought gold, &gt;&gt; frankincense and myrr. caught to revelation that he's gold. He's deity. He's almighty God. And that that wise man when he goes home, he preaches on the deity of Christ because that's all he sees. Then he'll veer into frankincense and he'll veer veer into myrr. But he comes back to deal. He comes back to deal because he sees gold. &gt;&gt; So now the other uh wise man frankincense, &gt;&gt; we got to serve God's people. We got to serve him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he might go over to gold. He's the deity of God. He's a man of God. He's the alpha God. But let's serve God. Let's serve him. &gt;&gt; That's the my gold. I'm sorry. Frankincense. That was service. &gt;&gt; And now the brother got a revelation. &gt;&gt; Gold, frankincense, and myrr. Oh, [Music] you got to die. You got an evangelistic experience. Die yourself needs to have a real dying. He'll go to gold. He'll go to my but his whole thing. But now we've come to a time where gold and frankincense and myrr are one. will speak on the soul. Speak on the dying, but each one has their revelation. No such prevailing power. Not such. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the pre prevailing power. One saw gold, one saw frankincense, one saw myrr. All together is a revelation of who Christ is God put in the church, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. What is that all for? Build you up to the faith. come into the unity. So I'm not here to speak speak on anything different than you've already heard. Brothers Ibali might speak on gold and I might be on frankincense. But I'll speak by the grace of God on the full revelation. All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; To God be the glory this morning. We are the redeemed of almighty God. The almighty God himself body came down in the body died on the cross so that you and I could be redeemed. Without the blood we're nothing. And that's why at the end of the son of man ministry is the bleeding because it's the bloody word. Say with me, you are cleansed from every sin. Amen. Amen. God cleanse you. washed you, &gt;&gt; forgave you. &gt;&gt; You had nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; You had nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It was the word coming to you. No different going to the well. No different than Jesus going to Jericho blind man said in the rising of the sun. He said it was the resurrection that came by your way. Can I say to you this morning that you're being resurrected at another place said he said the resur resurrection has already started. Why? He called you to the end of the ages and they without us be made perfect. Hallelujah. Think how important you are. You have to see how important you are. You are the bride of Christ. You're not a church member. [Music] &gt;&gt; You're the queen. I'm the king. Like it. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not enthused about this. With with revelation comes stimulation. If God's made it real to you, there's something sticking. It's not a dead church. It's a living body. It's an organism. Hallelujah. To God be the glory. Revelation's important. And I'm laying a trap. I like laying traps. Yeah, it's very important because you have to realize brother said in Christ God reveals. He says when a bride realizes who she is, then we're out of here. We're out of here. &gt;&gt; We're gone. But she will. that and that's why we preach. We're not preaching to get numbers. We're preaching to get the last seed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want God's seed. That's why Jesus Jesus went throughout Israel. Matthew, come. Matthew. &gt;&gt; Matthew. &gt;&gt; Look at you. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Not him. &gt;&gt; He's a tax collector. &gt;&gt; He works for the room. Come, master. Come. God didn't see the flesh. God sees the seed. We all fail in the flesh. But you've never made a mistake. You are the virtuous. &gt;&gt; Right of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And if you can't rejoice over that, nothing can happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you can't rejoice over that. Hallelujah. Amen. [Applause] You don't know what I was like &gt;&gt; and I don't know what you were like God can save me and this message could hold me. This message could direct me. He can do it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we said yesterday, I've done the Freddy's He's got saving powering power. Amen. And holding power kept by the power of God. Not a mental, not mental heart. &gt;&gt; Give me your heart. &gt;&gt; Don't give me your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I'm we all have a different delivery, &gt;&gt; but I like looking at who I'm preaching to. [Music] Huh? You know, eagle people play into a soccer [Music] or they go to cricket. &gt;&gt; They play cricket. &gt;&gt; That's the best. Come to church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is greater than any demon power. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brown said, "Don't jump any higher than you're living." So, so if you are like this, &gt;&gt; you're not living. But when you get like this, &gt;&gt; that's tremendous. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's born again. [Applause] Glory. [Applause] Oh my &gt;&gt; Oh my brother James. &gt;&gt; Oh why at least smile. [Applause] This is the greatest. He is the Almighty. Whenever two or three are gathered, &gt;&gt; I will be in their midst. &gt;&gt; I just listened to brother Brand morning. Sorry. I listened to Brother Brand yesterday. He says, "There's thousands of angels in this building." [Music] Come on. Come on. It's not a story. It's a reality. Catch it. You're just about over the finish line. Keep running. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm an old man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I was told I was a very, very old man. Hey, &gt;&gt; but you know, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; I was this way at 21. I'm this way at 51. &gt;&gt; I was this way at 71. This is what I am. So, as I said yesterday, when you get over into glory, you're going to see somebody jumping, praising, glorifying because I know what I was. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We made it. &gt;&gt; We made it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It comes from God. We're going back to God. We made it. &gt;&gt; Hey, tell the devil. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil &gt;&gt; he's a liar. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to hear it. &gt;&gt; Devil, you're a liar. [Applause] and you're under my feet. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; It's not a thought. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. When I had three boys for them, prayed for them. We wanted them not to be good, rich young rulers. Good boy. Come to church. Good boy. We wanted them filled with the fire of God. And I can say to you today God be the glory. Nothing we have done. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven knows my family. &gt;&gt; We have a big family now. We're all serving God. &gt;&gt; So if he does it for me, how about you? &gt;&gt; God's no respector of persons. [Music] If he saved me, &gt;&gt; he can save you. He gave me a wife, he can give you brothers a wife. &gt;&gt; That That's That was free and bonus. &gt;&gt; I don't know who's married or not. &gt;&gt; But God has got the right one for you. Oh. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me so far? &gt;&gt; Cuz I got to watch the clock. We got about 45 minutes left. &gt;&gt; So, you help me preach fast. Turn to Genesis 1. Glory. &gt;&gt; Why can't we enjoy ourselves? &gt;&gt; Why can't we enjoy church? &gt;&gt; You've walked a long way. &gt;&gt; You spent a lot of money to come to church with you guys. We're here to enjoy God's presence. Amen. Amen. come to enjoy the word of God as in our heart. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to take you to Genesis 1:1. Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." Have you got that? &gt;&gt; Almighty God, Elohim, &gt;&gt; Elohim, &gt;&gt; the Alpha, the Omega, &gt;&gt; created. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, &gt;&gt; God created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Genesis 6,000 years ago. I'm talking about your earth. &gt;&gt; Come on. I God created and earth God created you. &gt;&gt; Now just remember something here. And here we go off in another when when Joseph Joseph &gt;&gt; was given the place of Pharaoh, &gt;&gt; God gave him a dream and he's to store up food. Was that food for Egypt &gt;&gt; or was it for Jacob &gt;&gt; and his brothers? God cares less about serpency. Oh, &gt;&gt; just a second. He doesn't care about serpency. &gt;&gt; He only cares about his. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there was a storehouse, a storehouse, not for Egypt, &gt;&gt; but for Jacob, Judah, Simeon, Napali Dan. &gt;&gt; God had them in mind. &gt;&gt; God has you in mind. Jose a storehouse. &gt;&gt; A storehouse. &gt;&gt; Not for the world. I'm so sorry. [Applause] [Applause] Glory. It's for you. We have a burden. Message into the hands of his people. &gt;&gt; Serpency got into my hand. and long hair blonde. Blonde, by the way, &gt;&gt; blonde. &gt;&gt; Blonde, nobody you wanted to be with. But then God sent his word &gt;&gt; in flesh. My brother-in-law got saved. I didn't know what he got saved into. &gt;&gt; I didn't have a clue. Yeah. And we were all the same. We grew up the same. But then he looked like James, a gentleman. I said, "What happened to you?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I found the storehouse." I said, "I want some of that storehouse. You can't have it. You can't have it." Why can't I have it? &gt;&gt; He says, "Unless you're a seed, &gt;&gt; you can't have this." You know what that was like saying? &gt;&gt; You tell your little children, "Don't touch that. Don't touch that." But they want to touch it. I said, "Don't touch it." So when I say, he said, "You can't have this. Give me &gt;&gt; what you got. and look at me. &gt;&gt; This is what it does. It just changes you. &gt;&gt; It changes you &gt;&gt; and it's going to keep changing you. Brother said things that are to be. He said, "Since a little boy, a little girl, [Music] you desired this, but you didn't know where to go. You finding God. It was God finding you. Amen." And so I here we are and we start to understand at the end of the age and the son of man's being revealed revealing. Who is he revealing? A son of man revealing the son of man which is Christ. Who's Christ Almighty anointed &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; in the beginning &gt;&gt; created &gt;&gt; the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; So now here we are &gt;&gt; we said all that as we get into our subject. I'm not preaching to you this morning a past tense God of future. &gt;&gt; I am preaching to you a message right now. Say you're always looking for Messiah. We have Messiah. Have the opening of the word. Where's God? Sorry. Where's God? Where's God? Where's God? &gt;&gt; I don't see God. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just look left? Just look. &gt;&gt; Look at one another. &gt;&gt; Where's God in earth, our Father, who are in heaven, heavens, and the earth. &gt;&gt; Be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. in earth. Come on, &gt;&gt; in earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Give us this day &gt;&gt; our daily bread future man. All right. &gt;&gt; Said Moses went down to Egypt and he told the church fathers &gt;&gt; that the Lord God has visited him. Here comes a prophet. He said, "I met God." &gt;&gt; How did he reveal himself? What did he say who he was? He says, "I the I am. &gt;&gt; I am the I am &gt;&gt; in the beginning. &gt;&gt; The I am &gt;&gt; created, the heavens &gt;&gt; and the earth, [Applause] &gt;&gt; not past, &gt;&gt; not future. I am the I am &gt;&gt; right now. Whatever you desire when you pray, I'm getting it back onto you now. Preacher, I'm putting it back on you. Are you a son of God? Are you a son of God? You ask anything in my name. What you ask? You ask. [Applause] What day on that day you will know that I'm in the father, the father's in me, &gt;&gt; I in you [Applause] and Christ are one. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Should have got some of you out of your chairs right there. I It was better than scoring a goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just hit a home run. &gt;&gt; And 80,000 people go crazy. It's a ball. &gt;&gt; It's a stick. [Music] [Music] God &gt;&gt; Godlu. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Take that one, devil. [Applause] He can't have you. And they overcame him by the testimony and by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Overcome him. &gt;&gt; Satan &gt;&gt; is under your feet. [Music] &gt;&gt; I like church, &gt;&gt; but when I get home, &gt;&gt; I'm not so happy. You should be happy &gt;&gt; 24/7. [Applause] [Music] I'm watching you. So now God reveals himself to the prophet and the prophet reveals God to his people. What does he call himself? &gt;&gt; The I am. &gt;&gt; Not I will be, &gt;&gt; not I was, but by what I am, not past, not future, he's a very present. Hallelujah. Amen. In Exodus 3:14, &gt;&gt; Exodus 3:14, &gt;&gt; he says, "And God said unto Moses, &gt;&gt; I am that I am. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt tell the children of Israel, I am sent you." [Music] &gt;&gt; Now the I am &gt;&gt; is a very interesting word. So now here God &gt;&gt; was now starting to unveil himself. Mighty God was unveiling himself. &gt;&gt; Not just God, but I I am. So now when you said God in the beginning, he was telling his people that my presence is with you always. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now we'll just settle it down a little bit. Okay. So by revealing himself as the I am, I am a very present help. I'll never leave you nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; So then you start to wonder, &gt;&gt; who's the he will never leave me? God. &gt;&gt; God. [Music] &gt;&gt; God in you, the hope of glory. Amen. Amen. Now, now we're just going to take a little bit slower now. very important. So then he's not a god of history. That's why a prophet in this generation raised him out of history. The present he spoke about Moses. He was talking about himself. When he's talking about Joshua, he was talking about himself. Come on. Out of the I am. Moses was always in God. Always in God. Always in God. Matthew was always in God. Are you with me? Isaiah, &gt;&gt; Malachi, &gt;&gt; they were all in God. So the God &gt;&gt; that was with Moses &gt;&gt; Joshua &gt;&gt; Isaiah &gt;&gt; Elijah &gt;&gt; Elishah &gt;&gt; that God &gt;&gt; who is an everpresent God that same God &gt;&gt; is not just with him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You mean I got God in me? That's what the whole message all about. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached the message. &gt;&gt; Here it is here. Super sign mighty but God unveiled before us. God was behind Badger Skin. &gt;&gt; God was behind Badger Skin. That was the glory behind Badger Skin. God is in the tabernacle and only the high priest can go. Only the high priest. I want to go. Get away. Fight. I want in there. &gt;&gt; No, you couldn't do that. You die. But God had a greater plan for you. &gt;&gt; You're not in the wilderness. You're not in the inner court. You are kings and priests to God. [Applause] Go into that shikina glory. That shina glory in you. [Applause] What does the back of the church say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now it's not behind Badger skins. &gt;&gt; He says it's behind your skin. Amen. Whose skin? I'm going to ask you who skin and get a personal your skin. &gt;&gt; That's me, mama. &gt;&gt; I'm seeing in the mirror. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's me, mama. Amen. I'm not hearing about it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I'm only here for a very short time. I just want to encourage you. He said, "Now the glory of God, the glory of God, &gt;&gt; that is the thought of God, that's the opinion of God, that's the shining glory, our God is in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk like it. Hallelujah. Come on. Walk like you're a son like you're a daughter. [Applause] You say, "Oh, but we're just a little little church here in Are you kidding me? You're not a little church. &gt;&gt; You're not the toe. You're not the thigh. You're not the breast. You're not the tongue. You pass the eyes. Now you're in the intelligence. [Applause] I am you. No such prevailing power. If you could catch a revelation that God in the beginning has walked through seven ages thousand years and now he's found his adopted sons. We love terminology, &gt;&gt; but terminology won't get you to heaven. Revelation will get you to heaven. Oh, I I know where brother says that. Live it then. Okay. Live it. When you go out of this out of this church, &gt;&gt; I want you with your shoulders back. I'm a son. Not a just a king. I'm a son of the king of kings. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of the king of kings. Then you got that gene in you. So now &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then it's the providence of God &gt;&gt; that you're here this morning. [Applause] I'm I know brother Stephven can preach way better than me, &gt;&gt; but we do have the same message. I'm not saying anything new. I'm just saying what the messenger said. So the messenger said under her messenger, she &gt;&gt; is the final voice to the final age. same voice that said, "Let there be in you and me, Satan. We bind you, Satan. We bind you. Get behind us. We're tired of you. I'm a son of the king." [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] A power a power. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about infinite [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; infinite power. is living in his bride. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So the sovereignty of God, his providential care by his great fornowledge [Applause] you sons and daughters of God. Not in Luther's age. Not &gt;&gt; not in Luther's age. Not in Wesley's age and not even in Pentecost. The end of the age of man is revealed revealing Christ. If he's revealing Christ, he has to reveal you because you're the one that's in him. him found. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not mind over matter. I got to have [Music] faith comes by revelation by hearing the word of the Lord. We want to get this message out in Uganda. &gt;&gt; We want to get it in books. Look what it did to your pastor. If I remember correctly, sitting around my son Sam, my oldest son. &gt;&gt; He said, "Pastoral, how did you come in?" Brother Ivali says, "I got a church age book." &gt;&gt; Am I correct? And a church age book is the thought of God brought down in this generation. &gt;&gt; So if look what it did to brother Steven, &gt;&gt; why do you think we have a burden to get this message into your hands? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then the sovereign God The one with full authority, supreme authority, the self-sufficient one, &gt;&gt; the omnisient one, &gt;&gt; the om the present one. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Okay, you got to stick with me now. &gt;&gt; So now I'll break it down. &gt;&gt; The god is a god of emissions. So that means he knows everything at all times, effortlessly, &gt;&gt; effortlessly and instantly. &gt;&gt; Lord, what should I do? &gt;&gt; Lord, lead me. He's omnisient. &gt;&gt; He'll guide you. Those that are the sons of God are led of his spirit. So it's omniscience leading you. God leading you. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So we know he's omnisient. He knows all things inside effortlessly. He knows everything. So he's omnipresent. Brother said he's omnipresent. He feels all space and time. Think about it. Think about it. He's omnipresent. &gt;&gt; He feels all space and time. &gt;&gt; And he's omnipotent. Omnipotent. &gt;&gt; Omnipotent means he's all powerful. His power is unlimited &gt;&gt; and he's able to do anything. Like I said, I'm setting a trap. I got God in me. &gt;&gt; But barely have victory. You should be the most victorious because brother Bram said in Christ and Mr. God revealed that is his victory. Not the omnipotence of God. You can't separate them and say he can't help me now. You can't do that. &gt;&gt; That's what God is. &gt;&gt; So now all that God is, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] All that was in God &gt;&gt; poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, &gt;&gt; he's poured into you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now God's everywhere in your life because he's omnipresent. He's all knowing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He's omnipotent. &gt;&gt; That's why he can bind the devil. That's why we can put that serpent under your feet. &gt;&gt; You got power to bind. Power to loose. Power to bind. Power to bind. Power to loose. Amen. Amen. Where is that power? &gt;&gt; We've got the power. We all do that. We all do that. &gt;&gt; But then we get outside &gt;&gt; and our car breaks down. &gt;&gt; You got no more power. &gt;&gt; The power is not in mechanics. is in dynamics. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got all the mechanics and it's failed people. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; There's something I want to understand. &gt;&gt; Power in dynamic. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Oh, we got it. We got it. We've struggled. &gt;&gt; Congratulations. &gt;&gt; All right. God gives gifts to the church. Oh, &gt;&gt; I want this gift. I want this gift. &gt;&gt; You got gifts all around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got deacons, trustees, pastors, song leaders, singers, symbol makers. &gt;&gt; Oh, there should be a smile on everyone. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, what God is declaring in the beginning, God, &gt;&gt; what he's declaring &gt;&gt; is that he is a city. You can read it right here. &gt;&gt; God is a Hebrew. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Meaning &gt;&gt; meaning self-existence. &gt;&gt; Oh. So in the beginning, the self-existing one, the God that's always present, that God &gt;&gt; is revealing himself so that you and I could know who we are. Let me let me try and break this down. You cannot know who God is unless God sends a prophet. Cuz the Lord himself can do nothing until he reveals himself the prophet. So then God who's the allsufficient one has to reveal himself as the all powerful God. So then he had to change his mask to come in more feet. So he changed his mask [Applause] &gt;&gt; and walked to Abraham's tent. But Sarah didn't catch the revelation of who Elohim was. Abraham to reveal who Elohim was. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So then when God &gt;&gt; came in the flesh, &gt;&gt; he had to have John here, &gt;&gt; John the Baptist because a prophet has to reveal immorphy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you getting? &gt;&gt; So there had to be John to reveal Jesus. &gt;&gt; So every time God changes his mask, we have a prophet. Oh, so now here God changes his mask. He gone in the pillar of fire. Where's his prophet? &gt;&gt; You had Andrew. Hey, you had Peter. Where was Paul? &gt;&gt; God had to get Paul &gt;&gt; because he's going to be the prophet of the age. It's &gt;&gt; a prophet to show the changing of him and bless the spirit again. So then in this day, God had to have Malachi 4. He had to send you a prophet to let you know God in &gt;&gt; morphing. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; I hope you God in me &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. I can do all &gt;&gt; now. You read the scriptures different. &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ. that strengthen one present one. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So now now God is trying to reveal to his bride who she is in him. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How many times how many times &gt;&gt; did Jesus say, &gt;&gt; "I am &gt;&gt; the bread of life." &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; the light of the world. I am &gt;&gt; the door to the sheepfold. What was he doing? Revealing himself as thee. The full omnipotence of Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he says, I am the door to the sheepfold. I am the resurrection and the life. I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am the true vine. Glory. I am before Abraham was. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God's revealing who he is. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. What? Your eyes of understanding opened up at last. True victory is mine. &gt;&gt; I was chained down in the past. That's why David writes in the Psalms, "My soul waiteth only upon God, &gt;&gt; for my expectation is in him. Amen. Amen. Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not talking about the first poll. &gt;&gt; We are not talking about the first. &gt;&gt; As I was saying to brother Freddy's church yesterday, &gt;&gt; when you have sheep, you don't have to get up in the morning say, "Make me some wool." &gt;&gt; It's always there, right? Uh-uh. because he's a sheep. Sheep make wool. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm a son of God." &gt;&gt; Am I a son of God? Am I saved? &gt;&gt; Please. You're not a goat. You're a sheep. [Music] [Applause] Oh, God is good. &gt;&gt; Think about it, saints. &gt;&gt; God is revealing not in the first poll, &gt;&gt; not in the second pole. Even though Egypt benefited, &gt;&gt; they benefited. But the first pole made way for the second pole. The second pole made way for the third pole. &gt;&gt; Remember the story brother talked about the fishing. &gt;&gt; So he first had to learn it. He took him by the hand. Then God said, "There's another change in your ministry. Be the second pole and you'll discern the Then brother said he was looking for the third pole. &gt;&gt; And so in the third pole, &gt;&gt; God reveals to the prophet that it's the opening of the word. Huh? It's the spoken word and it's preaching to the lost three. &gt;&gt; So now we're in the third pole. All right. We don't have the time. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Are you sure? &gt;&gt; It's not good. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Okay. Couple more minutes. &gt;&gt; Is everybody okay? &gt;&gt; All right. So now in the in the third poll &gt;&gt; is the opening of the word and that is only pertains to the elect. Amen. It only pertains to the elect. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the open word had to take place. &gt;&gt; So then the God that was in Genesis came down in Revelation 10:1, the mighty angel descended, [Music] taking with him the open book. And brother Brown as being Revelation 10:7 was waiting for that book to be open, but it couldn't be opened unless there was a prophet pres. And brother Michael and I were fellowshipping last night up to 1962. He says, "We're looking for Malachi 4, Malachi 4 ministry. started at the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach anything that's different than what you've been taught. Paul was now saved for the elect. And Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4 had to be on earth to introduce. Behold the lamb of God taken away sin of the elect. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to be on earth and he saw that mighty angel descend over something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so then the book was open. Seven seals were loose. We make the saying, &gt;&gt; "I saw my name in the book." &gt;&gt; And I'll I'll end on this point. Everybody say, "I saw my name in the book." &gt;&gt; I did not see Tom Ray in here. &gt;&gt; He said, "You saw your name in the book." &gt;&gt; I go, "Where is Thomas?" &gt;&gt; I see Thomas the doubter. &gt;&gt; Not me. No, I had to believe because I'm his seed &gt;&gt; because so the storehouse that Joseph had stored the grainph The seals had to be open. Rain could come. But it wasn't for Egypt. &gt;&gt; It wasn't for Egypt. It was only for the elect. The opening of the word to the world. It is for you. [Applause] God opened the book for you. &gt;&gt; You okay? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we want to see our names. Brother said in the first seal, &gt;&gt; he says, "Now listen, the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world. This book, the Bible, &gt;&gt; was written before the foundation of the earth. And Christ being the lamb was slain before. And the members of his bride, [Music] their names were put in the lamb's book of life. before the foundation of the world. But it was sealed up. We had to have Malachi 4. We had to have Revelation 10:7. But it was sealed up. But now it's being revealed. Christ &gt;&gt; is the mystery &gt;&gt; of God revealed &gt;&gt; in you. It was once sealed up. Do you understand? All throughout those ages, they have desired to see what you see. The book wasn't open yet. A prophet wasn't here yet. So it took a prophet to study Revelation 10:1 to say. Do you understand? Do you saw the cloud over Mount Sunset? Oh, I know there's a lot of controversy. &gt;&gt; There's no controversy. &gt;&gt; They're just unbelievers. That's it. Brother Ram said in the rising of the sun, he said, "When I saw that cloud up there, here's your quote. That's the Lord up there. That's the Lord up there. It was a mystery to the world, but it was now being unveiled &gt;&gt; to you, &gt;&gt; to me. See him almighty God authority supreme authority living in me to God be the glory. [Applause] So the book, &gt;&gt; your name Tom Ray, &gt;&gt; Tom Ray &gt;&gt; was not in the book. &gt;&gt; But the revelation of who Tom Ray was. [Applause] Everybody say, "What's the big deal about the seven seals?" Without the seven seal opening, there's nobody that's going to manifest Christ. Now listen, but it was sealed up. &gt;&gt; But now it's being revealed. &gt;&gt; So now Malachi 4 ministry was blending revealing himself who he was. He believed he was Malachi 4. But it takes a revelation. Takes prevailing power. You see that's Malachi 4. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now here's let me break it down for you. &gt;&gt; He says, "But there is some that's got their names written in the lamb's book." &gt;&gt; There is some &gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some &gt;&gt; that's got their names written. Are you listening? We want to close on this main point because we've been speaking of the I am of God. upon this rock I'll build my church. &gt;&gt; So now we find that our names were written before the foundation of the world up in the book. So until there was a prophet on the scene before Revelation 10:7, [Music] the son of man revealing the son of man. [Music] Now he says there's those have got their name written in the lamb's book. And when those seals were thrown open, There they saw their name. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit speaks to them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, brother James. So when the seals were loose, it wasn't William Brandham speaking. God through the son of man. Amen. The mighty God unveiled revealing who he was to you. To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Without the opening of the seals, you couldn't see your name. So people say the seals aren't open. Well, &gt;&gt; there's no name for them. If there's one, I'm the one. &gt;&gt; If there's only one name written there, not you. Me. Me also. No, only me. Brother Bram said, "If there's only one going, you got to believe it's you. [Applause] Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; That hope in the Greek &gt;&gt; does not mean hope. So &gt;&gt; no, it doesn't mean I hope I get it. &gt;&gt; Because you have to read the book like it's an eastern book. You got faith, hope and charity. Hope &gt;&gt; faith. I'll move mountains. &gt;&gt; Charity. Force. Hope. Poor hope. She's the third one in there. The weakest one in there. Hope &gt;&gt; in the Greek &gt;&gt; does not mean hope. So &gt;&gt; has a powerful expectation of fulfillment. Uhhuh. Amen. powerful expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got powerful expectation. I'm going to be I'm going to be changed. You're going to be changed. Why? The open book revealed my name. I'm going to heaven because I came from the Almighty. Genesis 1. Revelation 10:7. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please, please one favor don't make just knowledge. [Music] Then we failed you. [Music] The church is built on revelation. God built on knowledge on revelation who you are. My Bible says when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; the common people &gt;&gt; the common people &gt;&gt; heard him gladly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've been a wonderful audience this morning. Thank you for pulling on the word. [Applause] [Music] You sing I've got the life of God. Do you sing that song? I've got the life of God in me. &gt;&gt; Oh, you do? &gt;&gt; Not me. &gt;&gt; Not you. &gt;&gt; Not me. They are here. &gt;&gt; Well, you stay with me. &gt;&gt; You stay with me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So we sing it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. This is the way we sing it. &gt;&gt; And I'm not a singer. He's the singer. &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me. &gt;&gt; I got the life of God in me.

Come on, Michael. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're gonna sing it until you get it. &gt;&gt; That's why we preach so you can get it. Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to sing it with some life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me. &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me. I've got his life, his nature, and his ability. I've got the life of God in me. I've got the life of God in me. I've got the life of God in me. I've got his life, his nature, and his ability.

I've got that life from God in me. I've got the life of God in me. I've got his life, his nature, and his ability. I've got the life of God in me. Amen. Do you appreciate Pastor Tom? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us sit for a little while and invite pastor &gt;&gt; to come praise the name of our lord. You can sit and then invite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you enjoyed the word? &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching the God of history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the brother said. He's preaching a present tense God before Abraham was a &gt;&gt; and he'll always be a when he spoke about I mean to to Moses He says, "I am the father of Abraham, &gt;&gt; Jacob, Isaac, &gt;&gt; not I was, &gt;&gt; but I am." &gt;&gt; Do you believe the I am? I am the resurrection. I am. &gt;&gt; You're not that man at the cross. Remember me when you come. He says, "I am the resurrection." &gt;&gt; Not I will be. I am. &gt;&gt; And tonight, tonight you will be with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We deal with the God who is present tense. Amen. To God there is no time. He has no time to himself. Are you together with me? And when we got the perfect faith, it is a substance. Substance means something that exists or things that we hope for that we expect and believe strongly that we are going to receive. I want to tell you something. You know brother Brham says faith is find God's will for you and then he says faith is a substance. This is the present tense God we are dealing with. So when he created you he mapped your path. He mapped all your junctions. Amen. He knew that Israel will go under captivity for 450 years and then I'll come again and redeem them. And therefore everything that they needed for that journey created it to come forth in the season when they needed it. Are you together with me? It would look like the children of Israel are the ones who called God to hear and then come down. But it was predestinated plan. Are you together with me? So the brother says this message is for believers. I said the same also. We preach predestinated sea. The rest of the people will be here. They will listen. They will put it here. But yours is here because we deal with present God. I want to say that when God created you, he created you with all your opportunities. Amen. in life to the extent that when the challenges come you just call those things into existence. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see this is what the brothers been saying. If you knew what he was talking about the hallelujah the praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Because he's bringing God from history to bring him down here with you to a God you fellowship with, a God you live with, a God who leads your What can I say? Praise God. Amen. Amen. So, we really thank God. Brother Tom is a a special man. He goes that way, goes that way, goes that way, collects the world think here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I trust that you've all been blessed. Let me tell you, he knew your journey and he prepared for you what you have need of today. So you will never be deficient. So you need faith which is a substance. You just pull the substance you have need of at that time they needed Moses. He was the substance substance God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Let's give praise to the Lord this morning this afternoon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To me he you know he he he brought out that issue of the mind, the mind. &gt;&gt; And that mind comes into you. And when the mind comes into you then the mind goes before the word. So whatever you speak when the mind is in there you are speaking the unfailing words because that will be God speaking that will be the speaking. He was bringing you away so that God can come at the control of his pride. And once you have the word, the mind of God, you have everything you need. No wonder the prophet says the rapture is within you. It's not something we are going to look for. When we have the word, the mind of God, we have it. When we come to this season, we shall be changed. Amen. We appreciate you, brother Tom. You kept bringing many things there. We really appreciate God. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; So, um, before we close the service, Uh, brother Tom Rem is going to do an ordination for us today. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven Odoi is going to be ordained for the work that the Lord has led him to start. in the area. So I would ask brother Odoi to walk forward with his family to be witnesses as he gets ordained for that job today. You love him. Amen. So you are not going to preach the god of yesterday. You are not going to preach the god of tomorrow. I am that I am. I am that I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Let the I am his mind in you that when you speak to God's people, you are speaking God's word. You are speaking life, not past tense, not future tense. You are speaking life itself into the hearts of the people. God bless you. Do I have the mic on the bra said when God calls a man, &gt;&gt; he calls his wife. &gt;&gt; So it's not unusual for a brother to want his wife standing with him. Brother so often referred to me. She was white before her time. &gt;&gt; Because she was carrying the burdens of the people. So today we're standing here because brother Steven wants to be ordained. Brother Brham ordained a lot of men. Where they went, we do not know. &gt;&gt; We don't know. But it's personal. So I'm not worried about tomorrow, Stephen. As we've been preaching, &gt;&gt; he's the God of the present. So you keep focused on the cross, focus on this message. Don't add or take away as we were in the book of Revelation. One word, added or taken away, shall take your name out of the lamb's book. Brother said, "Do not add to this message." The angel confirmed what he preached. You preach the same thing the prophet preached. The same angel will confirm your &gt;&gt; because it's already been confirmed. You understand that, brother Stephen? &gt;&gt; This is an incredible thing. I had a scripture and I told Michael yesterday, I've got a scripture the Lord gave me for the minister. ministers at brother Freddy. &gt;&gt; He had a bunch of ministers, &gt;&gt; but it was for you, brother Steven. Before this event even took place, God had you in mind. Amen. Now the Bible says in &gt;&gt; blessed are the feet. &gt;&gt; Blessed are the feet &gt;&gt; that preach the gospel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feat's very important. &gt;&gt; Taking a step is possession. and you're taking possession this morning. &gt;&gt; You step forward. You're claiming your land, &gt;&gt; your position in Christ because under the word, &gt;&gt; Paul writes in Romans. &gt;&gt; Now to him that's able to the power to establish power &gt;&gt; according to his word. The God of peace shall bruise Satan's under your feet. [Music] &gt;&gt; Did we bruise the devil today? &gt;&gt; By the gospel and by the gospel living in flesh for them. God has said in his word that you're a blessed man and he's a God that will lead and keep you believe the message with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand for it. Take the persecution for it. Love it. It's like a marriage. &gt;&gt; It's like a marriage. &gt;&gt; Will you take him? be your great bride and friend. All right. How can they hear unless you sent may the Holy Spirit and whatever God has in store for you. May you bring in many for the kingdom. And I'm going to give you brother Bis's favorite scripture. when that woman with the alabaster box &gt;&gt; and she poured the oil on Jesus and they gave such a bad time to this woman. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, &gt;&gt; she did all she could. And that was the way brother Bisco lived. He said, "I have done all I could. Brother Steph, may you do all you can. Don't look at the trials. Those trials are ordained to make you a better man. Can we all bow our heads in a word of prayer? Father, &gt;&gt; it's not by the laying of hands on a man, &gt;&gt; but it's to recognize that the man is called by God. The brothers have recognized our dear brother Steven and his dear wife. We pray Lord under the anointing of God that is present that you will use him Lord in a mighty way. May he go down paths ordained of God. When he comes to the crossroad of the road, may he look for the bloody footprints that shall lead him all the way. Lord, open his eyes to see more of your glorious grace. Give him uncction of the spirit. Anointed from above, Lord, to discern the right from the wrong. May you bless his dear wife as they now go down this journey. Lord, as we recognize him as a minister of the gospel of Jesus, we ask that your grace rest be upon him and his wife. Pray God that when he opens the word become a living word and may the spirit of God quicken him spirit Christ from the dead and our brother Steven he'll conquer many kingdoms. Lord we ask you to bless him and guide him great shepherd as we ask now as we finish this little ordination that he will look to the lamb of God and be led by the great shepherd of Jesus. We commit him and his dear wife to you now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless you and you and use you sister one for the kingdom. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You remember when brother Tom Ray was winding up the service, &gt;&gt; it was about the name Where is the name in the book? &gt;&gt; Your name is writing there. &gt;&gt; In the book which is the word. That's where you will find your name. Amen. And remember, John was able to see his name after it was revealed to him that there was a lamb that bled for his sake. It gave him the confidence. He lifted up his hands. He praised God together with the elders and all the heavens and the earth and all that was under the earth had him praised. It takes confidence. When you have seen your name, you will not say amen. &gt;&gt; No sir, how will you say? God bless you. Heaven will hear you. Earth will hear you. Under the earth they hear you. You have got the confidence. The lamb has slaying for you. He has pled his blood upon you. And before God there is no condemnation. Then you can say hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Let the pastor tell you what comes up after in the afternoon service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us stand up and sing that song. We are children. Each of us praise to God. Having heard your name. I believe you had your name personal. I've heard my name.
