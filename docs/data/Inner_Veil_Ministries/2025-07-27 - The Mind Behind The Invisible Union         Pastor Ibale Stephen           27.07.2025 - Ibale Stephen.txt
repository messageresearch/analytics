I come before your presence, Lord, this morning. I'm just as I am, Lord. But, Father, I want to thank you, oh God. Your word has taught us this morning that Hezekiah came back. Oh father, when you told him he was going to die, he said, "Oh God, have I not served you with a faithful heart? Oh God, have I not obeyed your commands? Father, be merciful to me. Lord, I want to be that Hezekiah this morning, Lord. May you have mercy and compassion upon me, Lord. all my weaknesses, Lord. All my shortcomings, oh heavenly father, Lord, I'm thankful this morning, Lord, because you are that friend, oh Lord, who never forsakes me. Oh Lord, you are that friend when other friendships cease.

You said, oh God, in your word that even if your sins be as red as crimson, come and I wash them white as snow.

Not your troubles. &gt;&gt; Lean on Jesus this morning. &gt;&gt; No matter the circumstance, &gt;&gt; no matter what trouble you have, find power in him. Oh gave all power that I am a dream. I'm learning to lean on just the church and the keyboard alone learning to lean as the pastor comes. Learning to lean. I'm learning to lead. Oh, learning to lean. Why to lean on Jesus? Oh, I'm gaining more power than I ever dream. I am to Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are you learning to lean on him this morning? Amen. You may be seated. So I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus. And it's a great blessing to be in his presence. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in a as I always say in a time of transition. And now transition is when two uh different phases kind of merge together. And I appreciate God that brother James has really been very effective in this. He has been able to catch up quickly. You know when you look at some of the great stories in the Bible, it is around 17 years when David killed Goreas. He was just a little lad, a little boy. And then you know we can look back and from the time when he was anointed by Samuel to the time when he went to the wall was about five or six years. So he was anointed at around 12 years and then he was able to kill Goras. And all that is now a time of transition. He has been anointed to be king at 12 years. But he takes the throne at 30 years. You see it is very interesting that after the killing of Goras that is about uh it took another seven and a half years and he was reigning over Judah and he had taken over the 10 tribes. So at 30 years he unified the entire Israel. So it was 18 years when the gift of a king was being formed. Isn't that a long time? Yeah. A lot of things come during the time of the transition. And you see when you look at men like Elisha, you know, he gets the mantle of Elijah parted on him and he felt the anointing and he began to fall for about eight years and then the mantle of Elijah fell on him. But it took another 10 years to fit into that matter. So the transition is always a long time. But we appreciate that in that period of time, God is preparing the mind of the man going to take over and even the mind of the people that are going to receive it. So we appreciate God. that he has been able to merge the two together. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we just appreciate God for that. And one thing I say is that I am blessed to have a pastor. Amen. Amen. Don't you say the same thing today? It's a blessing to have a pastor, a man who cares for your soul. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to greet everyone of you and welcome you to the house of the Lord and I want to say what a blessing it is to be called the sons of God. You know I thank God for my family. Amen. They are all here this morning. Amen. Amen. you know, except two of them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think three of them. Uh my son-in-law John, &gt;&gt; my son-in-law Reuben, and then my granddaughter. &gt;&gt; They are the only three that are not here with us. But the entire family is here. All my four daughters are here this morning. Amen. And the six grandchildren are here. The one missing is Amen. &gt;&gt; So we certainly appreciate that God is good to us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got brother Sam here, my son-in-law. Brother William, I really appreciate my family. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing for God to give you a family that serves the Lord. It's a special grace and I want to say you may not be able to understand that until you have grown children. When they are very young, you can always command them around. But when they are grown and they remain under the inspiration you placed them, it's a great blessing. Amen. Amen. So of recent, I was caring for the back condition of my wife. So attending to her at home, I was the one doing everything she wanted to have and taking her to hospital three times a week. And while we did that, a little Remma became sick. She got me and she could not continue at school. I had to attend to her also because her mother was in Nairobi. So my wife in the circumstance wrote me a heartwarming message. You know it's very interesting. You stay in the same room, but somebody chooses to write you a message and she says, "Thanks for taking care of me. May the Almighty God bless you, reward your love for me, the girls, the grandchildren, and especially Yadel, your labor is not in vain. God sees all your sacrifices and he rewards his faithful children. I loved that. Praise the Lord. Yeah. You know, it's nice to stay in a home when your friends is not a man having a woman in the house, but a man having a wife in the house who fits in what a wife must be. and I appreciate my wife for the last 45 years. Amen. &gt;&gt; So before we can continue, I think you know uh the little girls here admiring that. God bless you. The musicians you can come give us one song and we can get into the word. &gt;&gt; Have you come to church? &gt;&gt; Have you come to church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you come to church, you act to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feel happy. Worship God. Say how great he is. Amen. Brother Brham says in message experiences, don't be late at your church. You who have to go to church, you get right on. Did you hear the admonition of the prophet? Don't be late at your church. How many know that this is your church? Don't be late at your church. You who have to go church, you get right on. Okay. God bless you as we get to hear from these brethren. [Music] [Music] God. At night I lay in bed and I [Music] begin to cry. [Music] And my mind just fails to know exactly why. I can't explain with tongue or pain. The spirit's groing deep within. It must be here in my soul. As I feel the pool, I feel the &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hear the call. [Music] And I know his spirit's moving me to give my all to me. [Music] Oh, and I agree. [Music] Lord, please come and take on shore. I feel the poor. I went to hear the word and we each line and phrase. He was drawing me to give a higher praise. These are deep. Cold to the deep like a great magnet pulling me. I know for sure that I receive cuz I feel the &gt;&gt; Yes, I feel the praise God. Oh, I hear the call and I know his spirit is moving me to give my all. His speak to me. Oh, and I [Music] Lord, please come and take on joy. I feel the P. I feel the P. Oh, I hear the call and I know his spirit is moving me to give my heart. He speaks to me. He speaks to me. [Music] Oh, and I am free. My Lord, please come and take control. I feel the P. He speaks to me. Oh &gt;&gt; and I Lord please come. &gt;&gt; Lord please come and take control. I feel the [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you feel the pull this morning? Is something pulling? Amen. That's what we need to feel this morning. If you got a deep on the inside. Amen. Amen. Then you are going to hear from another deep this morning. Deep call to the deep. Amen. So let's stand up. Get into the scripture reading. We shall go to Romans chapter 7 and we shall read the first four verses. But before we do, I invite you to a word of prayer. Father, we want to thank you for giving us the grace to come before your presence. The pathway has already been sprinkled by blood and we have come through the blood. We feel we are fresh and clean to come before your presence and we pray Lord that you may receive us with open hands and that you may break of your bread that you may share with us the words of eternal life. Bring our burdens, Lord. All our fears Lord, all our weaknesses, Father, that you may address them this morning. Encourage us. Speak to us. Teach us, Lord, and above all in your word, in the circuits of our hearts. water it with water of the spirit. As father we keep moving along this pilgrim journey, whatever of these words you fulfill, help us remember them and say like those of old that this day this scripture has been fulfilled. We pray for our pastor and all the offices that hold his hand that together you may bless us in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Romans chapter 7 verse one know ye not brethren for I speak to them know the law. That's a very great spring point. &gt;&gt; I speak to those that know the law. &gt;&gt; How that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth. Amen. Amen. As long as a man is alive, the law rules over him. And then after showing that the law rules over him, then he singles out a woman out of the man race and tells her, "For a woman which has for the woman which has an husband has is bound by the law of husband, so long as he liveth. Yes. But if the husband be there, she's lose from the law of husband. So there was a law for this. There was a law for that. There was law for everything. And then Paul is bringing forth the law concerning a woman in marriage. So the subject matter here is the woman. She's bound to the law of a living husband. Amen. Amen. Verse three. &gt;&gt; So then if while her husband leaveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adult. But if husband be dead, she's free from that law so that she's not an adulteress though she be married to another man. So the death of a former husband releases this woman to be married to another. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Yes sir. Verse four. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, my brethren, &gt;&gt; you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ. So now Paul changes the tone and he talks to you as a woman which is the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Are you together with me? So he says wherefore my brethren you also are become to the law by the body of Christ. that he should be married to another, &gt;&gt; even to him who is raised from the dead, &gt;&gt; that we should be, I mean, we should bring forth fruit unto God. &gt;&gt; God bless the word that has been read. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning? I've got a very interesting title here. We all know that brother Brandham taught the message invisible union. But this morning, I want to speak on the mind behind the invisible union. Amen. Amen. So Paul takes a junction here. and brings in the church. Therefore, this part of scripture uses a natural marriage to help us to understand that after the law, the church was free to be married to another and the other is Christ so that we may bring forth fruit unto him. Are you together with me? Okay. So the law is out of the way. So what is in the way now? It is grace. So when I preach grace I am not promoting sin whatsoever. Are you together with me? but rather that grace is the pathway to our eternal salvation. The grace failed I mean the law failed and therefore grace came. Amen. So grace is the strength of God to bring a person to living the life of Christ. Amen. So there is no other way we can be saved and sustained in our salvation except by grace. And this eternal grace will walk a man through his justification. Amen. Then lead him into his sanctification by keeping him in the word. As long as a man saved by grace will keep himself in the word, that man will be sanctified to the intent that he may be filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Are you together with me? Yeah. That's what we are supposed to be. that when the Lord died, the church was free to be married to another husband and that husband is the Lord Jesus Christ. So, brother Brham uses Romans chapter 7 to teach the invisible union. And I want to title this message The mind behind the invisible union. The mind which brother Brham had while he was teaching the invisible union. The mind is a thought that drives the direction of the objective. Well, we can call it the concept. The concept is a standing picture that is that stands in the mind of a minister. And while the minister is preaching, he's having every area of his effort to kind of paint that concept before you. to paint the reality of the picture. So, brother Brham who understood the Bible, he understood it because he always went behind the mind of the writer. He could not go by what he saw the letters were, but he went behind the writer's mind. Because listen here, this is an old woman. She's about 75 years old. &gt;&gt; And there is a young king called me. And now when you know uh uh David was uh uh out of the kingdom because of the pressure of famine. I mean Abraham rather. And now he goes out there. He goes with his wife Sarah. Are you together with me? She was not a young girl. She was an old woman. But this young king admired this woman. And brother Brham says for Sarah to have a child to reverse her age. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; You see, he was really understanding the Bible was getting behind the righteous man. So the letter without an abstract idea to it kills. So we must teach the life behind the word. So in the natural aspect we sometimes fail to paint the concept by a natural vocabulary. That's why you must get in the spirit that you may not just listen to the words you are hearing but trying to get behind the minister's mind and see what the spirit spoke to him. Amen. so that you may listen to this minister by the concept like John says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day then I heard if he was in the not in the spirit he would have not heard if you want to understand what I speak this morning it's necessary to get in the spirit and Be like a John. Like a John. Now let me tell you something. If you come to church to hear me, you'll stop at my word. But then you don't have an interpreter. But if you come to church in the spirit, are you together with me? You will not only hear me, but you will hear. And the interpreter will interpret what you're hearing. Because the same interpreter that will interpret for you is the same one who brought it as revelation to the preacher. Amen. Amen. So if you enter and get it from the teaching of the spirit You will be getting revelation. You will not be hearing the word of knowledge. Are you together with me? You'll be hearing revelation. So by being in the spirit, you catch the word by the concept and not by the letter. You begin to see a stunning picture that the minister was looking at. as you try to labor to bring forth the message. So the concept here is like the full crumb or a pivot point where you know this arm can move this way can move that way. If it didn't have this focus wouldn't be able to move easily. Amen. Amen. The concept of this message today is the invisible union. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In church, we've got different husbands and uh different wives to different husbands. Amen. I'll take one example. Brother Mutambbo here is married to her sister Julia. I don't want to bring them here again. But if I do, what's the problem? Brother, come here. Where is your wife? Come here. Clap for them as they come. [Applause] Praise the Lord. Now one day I joined these people in a marriage union. Now they are looking at one another smiling. Now this man here and this woman here and united in a marriage. But these two here are not an invisible union. We saw them coming like we are seeing them come here. They are a visible union. So now the prophet uses this kind of picture of a visible union to illustrate an invisible union. God bless you. [Applause] So we are going to take that kind of uh avenue as we talk today. Romans 7 Paul uses the example of a natural woman while his focus is on the church which is liberated from the power of the law. Amen. So, brother in the message invisible union, he says now in Romans 7 this message out of here. It seems like it's on marriage and divorce, but it really isn't. To me it's a prophecy for the church in the last day. So while you study the message invisible union, don't you look for a visible union. So the mind behind visual union has nothing to do about marriage and divorce but is a prophecy for the church in the end time. So set your mind right now. So this church moves towards the union with the capstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the church keeps growing from service to Philadelphia and it's growing towards marriage to become stone. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. This is the prophecy of the church in the end time that in the end time there will be an invisible union between Christ and the church. Are you together with me at the opening of the seven seals at the sunset mountains the Lord himself came down. What was happening there was now the fulfillment of the message of visible union. Amen. So this union starts building after the death of the law. But it comes to maturity in the end time when we see the headstone coming down and is crying grace grace grace. Why grace? Because you cannot save yourself. So he comes down to save you and to lead you in your sanctification. All that is grace. Justification is his grace. Sanctification is his grace. And even the baptism of the Holy Spirit is his grace. Because you don't have the righteousness. that would really bring down the holy God but is just coming down saying grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? So this capstone comes after Christ has built the life of grace in his bride by giving her what she needs to overcome. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you overcome on your own? No. God himself will give you what you need to overcome the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will give you his faith. And he says after you take your faith upon your faith and virtue is giving you everything that you need to overcome the devil. Amen. It is God who is going to make sure that he that started a good work will bring it to completion. through your sanctification to the change of your life to the b of the Holy Ghost to the testimony of adoption. It will be him. He started a good work. He will bring it to the end. Amen. So the captain comes crying grace grace and this grace as revealed in the opening of the seven seals. Not the grace to mean this grace. But grace as revealed in the opening of the word. Are you together with me? Okay. In the message, is this the sign of the enders? The prophet says that is some of the mysteries that this angel is supposed to wind up. All the mystery, all the mysteries of God. So that's paragraph 255. And then he begins to name those mysteries. Then when he comes to verse paragraph 258, he names one of them as the grace straightened out. Not disgrace but real true grace. Amen. So in the end time true grace could not unfold if the church was still married to law. Are you together with me? Yeah. They could not mar together. And we must understand that the law was until John the Baptist that after that grace and truth comes by Christ. Amen. And this grace here was pouring out. Amen. until the end in the end of the church ages the fullness of God's grace is revealed with the fullness of atonement and then that headstone which comes down which is the invisible union come crying grace grace grace So right now the church is not under the law. And what the people call a legalistic preacher is not there at all because the law was given to Moses and it is defined defined. So we know what the law is. If you are not preaching the law as defined by Moses, then you are not preaching law. Because the law has been defined as ten commandments, as the seven feasts, as the judgments, like a one caught in adultery was stoned, like a cutting off the thieving hand. Then the society principles Thou shalt not love I mean thou shalt love thy neighbors thyself owe no man anything but love one another for he that loveth another fulfilled the law that's now society laws. And finally, the moral responsibility that have not died up to now because they are summed up in the love of the brotherhood. Are you together with me? Praise God. Romans 39. Be very attentive. be in the spirit &gt;&gt; like a John to catch the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 3:9. For this, thou shalt not commit adultery. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not kill. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not steal. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not bear false witness. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not coveret. &gt;&gt; And if there be any other commandment, It's briefly comprehended in this saying, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." So that's the nutshell of the law. It is properly defined. So if a man is preaching and is known to be legalistic, And if he's not coming by this law, then he's not a legalistic preacher. He preaches the commandments of men. Are you together with me? He's preaching the commandments of men. You must you must not you must and you must not and bring even some kind of uh uh uh measuring tape. We said the dress must be 2 in from the ankle. And then you say where is that written? He bring out scripture. that ladies must be decent. &gt;&gt; But who has the definition of decent? The one who has the Holy Ghost understands what decent mean. There are certain passions that she will throw out because that they are not decent. They give up the V because it's intended to to show the split. Let them also see. Why do you show him? &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. But a person with the Holy Ghost will know will know &gt;&gt; and will say this is too tight for me. I I want something that's a little better. This is too loose, you know. I think let it be moderate. A person with the Holy Ghost will know. I don't have to give you a commandment. I just want to teach you modesty and that modesty can only be done by a Holy Ghost filled woman. Anybody else cannot be able to do that. You don't argue with people. The people will know they are lying because they in contact with the Holy Ghost all the time. When they go to the shop to shop for a dress, they're in contact with the Holy Ghost. So now the law as given to Moses cannot live together with grace. The law was a husband that had to die for us to be married to Christ by grace. But as I said, when I preach sanctification, it's not under the law, sanctification is part of the unfolding of grace. Amen. Amen. Because when the Holy Ghost comes into the life of a believer, one thing he does first is to justify this man. To justify is to make him feel like he never did it before. God justifies it in the times of ignorance. As far as the elect is concerned, God wked. He never saw your past. Amen. But as the pastor was preaching here last Wednesday, When you come under the blood, you must keep everything under the blood. Whatever happens, take it back to the blood. That is sanctification. How will you take it back to the blood? Because whatever is not of the word is made manifest in the word. So when you go to the word, you'll always throw off what is not of the word. That is sanctification. It's not of the word for a sister to cut off her hair. So you retain your hair. It's not of the word. for a sister to paint her face. So you throw it off because you see the first woman who did it was Jezebel that was fair to the dogs. If you have the Holy Ghost, you don't need a pastor to come and tell you stop painting your face. Why? Because the Holy Ghost is the one who sanctifies your spirit. Amen. If your pastor tells you and you stop it, but you are grudging blessed you need to get into whatever you get into. Amen. By the conviction of the Holy Spirit himself. Amen. Amen. When I preach sanctification, I'm not preaching the law. Are you together with me? Is part of grace. Now, Hebrews chapter 8, I'm just trying to jump through this that we may be able to cover the Lord. Hebrews chapter 8 verse seven. The scripture said, "For if that first covenant had been fruitless, then should no place have been sold for the second. If the first husband, the Lord, Amen, was perfect, then there was no need for another husband. called grace to take the church. But the first husband, the Lord had to die first. &gt;&gt; And that's what the invisible union is dealing with. The bride qualifies by sovereign grace. Hallelujah. Praise God. The law has died. They must do, they must not, they must do. Amen. But then grace comes in and he said, &gt;&gt; I will have mercy because I love mercy. Are you together with me? And he had mercy on you. And stems back to your election because God forneew you. from before the foundation of the world and fitted you with a seed gene of life. That's the only thing that God can show mercy. That gene right there. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He bypasses Esau who was a good boy to his father and picks a sisfied Jacob. reflection of grace. I have a quote here in the vis here is giving an illustration in our scripture about the law and grace and illustrating it like a marriage and knowledge and divorce. This passage is seldom preached on &gt;&gt; because it's more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce. You know, not many preachers pick Roman 7 because they look at it as something that deals with marriage and divorce. But boy is picking it up to illustrate your salvation by grace. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the natural marriage here is being used as a physical illustration to describe our spiritual union with Christ. So in the first union there must be a death first before there can be another marriage. The first husband called Mr. Lo that was given to Moses and was wedded to the church of Israel and to die first. And when Israel rejected, &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Christ moved over to the Gentiles that had no knowledge of the Lord to save them but knew not the Lord. Are you together with me? So in the first union, there must be a death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; So is that union? &gt;&gt; How can she be united to another husband when another is still alive? Praise the Lord. Joshua, come here. &gt;&gt; I want to make it easy. Where is the woman? She loses her name. Praise the Lord. I want an illustration down here so that I can make this clear and you are going to live. You are going to live. You are not going to die. Now this song leader here out there on YouTube. &gt;&gt; This is his beautiful wife &gt;&gt; so that you may know. &gt;&gt; So, so this man here loves his wife. You see them? And then come The travel begins. &gt;&gt; You are not taking her. Just illustrate when this man is alive and you are trying to take her. [Laughter] You see what I mean? It doesn't work. It creates a battle, a conflict between law and grace. Because this grace here cannot marry her as long as the law is still alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the Lord dies, this woman becomes lonely. And I'm not going to describe to demonstrate. Do you understand what I mean? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I think you understand it very well. So in the natural marriage until the first husband died, she cannot marry in the spiritual marriage. Unless the Lord died, Christ wouldn't have come. So the law was until John the Baptist but after that grace came by grace and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the quote here. The prophet Paul invisible union. here is saying that a woman cannot marry another until her husband is dead. She cannot remarry as long as her first husband is leaving by no circumstance at all. She must remain single as long as her first band is leaving. And if she should do such a thing, she shall be called an adulterous. I'm speaking of the natural now to type with the spirit. So that's now the prophet saying. Now according to the illustration here we are going to look at the death of the three husbands. The first illustration is that if a woman is married naturally and the husband is still alive no chance for another husband. There must be a death of the first husband. And then the second illustration is the death of the law for grace to come in. The second husband is the law. Then there is a third husband that must die. The third husband is the old Adamic nature with the pleasures of the world. It must die for the newness of Christ to come. Brother Brham says we were born married to the nature and the character of the first Adam. The nature that must die for us to be married to Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So three husbands must die. But in our case now, which is the church, we are going to concentrate on two, the law and the fallen nature of Adam. For us to be fully married to Christ, the law must die. And the second thing is that the nature that commits sin and is married to sin also die. Two husbands when they are dead when you are fully married to Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you want to be married to Christ in entire fullness? Let us go to Romans chapter 6. and verse six. Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you put to death, &gt;&gt; Amen. the old man that live to sin so that sin may not have dominion over you. This old man here is the nature of sin that we inherited by the natural birth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A natural birth is possible but it comes through or it comes with certain attributes that is passed on from parent to parent. some kind of a DNA may be the nature the look the behavior the ways of Adam &gt;&gt; which chose sin. Amen to redeem his wife. Are you together with me? Are you together with me this morning? the nature of Adam chose a sin to redeem his wife. But when he redeemed her, he could not get rid of that nature. So now the children that were born took of that nature which chooses him. So it doesn't matter whether you are born and you are hidden in a house and you never see anybody and food was being brought by robots so that you cannot admire any woman. And if you are a man, you could not have an opportunity to lie to anybody. You would still be a sinner by representation because Adam represented you. And all the birth that comes in the world comes by the possibility of passing on a gene except by one birth which was born of a virgin without an interaction of a man. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. No wonder that was the only life that could redeem a man. Are you together with me? So this old man is the nature of sin and it must die so that the new man could be born and the new man after this only man is dead. He begins to form his life. Amen. justification sanctification best of the Holy Ghost and then then comes all the virtuous life of Christ for me. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Go to Ephesians 4:22. Ephesians 4:22. That you put off concerning the former conversation, the old man. which is corrupt according to that deceitfulness of lust. So the old man is corrupt and will always lean towards the deceitfulness of sin. He's deceitful. When he's alive, he will desire to lie. There will be a little bit of malice, &gt;&gt; envy, [Music] you know, he will lean towards the wrong thing. When she goes to the shop, she will choose this kind of shoe because it will form a form of a a way to walk. That's what she'll choose very high will choose the dress that they have told me to wear. what ends here then I'll put on one which comes here but it will look like plastic upon my body and then reveal every part of my body and if you go two inches everything &gt;&gt; and you see them like they cannot stretch their leg oh these are designed to walk in a certain way and that's what a person will choose sitfulness of sin. But when he put off the old man by the new birth and then we constantly renew our mind by the word, then you are referred to as the new man in Christ. Verse 23 says, "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind. and that you put on a new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. The new man is a creation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And creation comes by the word. Let there be. Amen. &gt;&gt; So as you study the word, &gt;&gt; you are recreating yourself every day. There is more of God that's created around you. Amen. So the first birth is your father and mother. That's the old man. But the new birth is the new man. And that new man responsed in righteousness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This man here, he rejoices in studying the word that when he comes to church, he's not a stranger to the pastor. When the pastor says something here, the Holy Ghost will tell you that's the message you read yesterday. That's the verse you were meditating on yesterday. And you always be saying that you rejoice in the life of prayer. His life pulls towards fellowship not going on Sunday clubs and women's groups chapters rotary clubs you know Sunday's day nothing should take it away from you there is something in you that you pull towards that's the new man the new loves the brotherhood and will produce a nature of his parent. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't struggle to walk like your father. No. It's natural. You don't struggle to walk like your father. I know one young man who talks like his father. my grandson. You push a chest up to the front and you will know that's a [Laughter] Are you together with him? He doesn't struggle. He doesn't go to a training. But there is a life in him that starts coming out. Amen. There's a life in you that will start coming up as you study the word. You are not going to struggle to produce the life of your parent. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Paul says against such there is no law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's no law that will cause me to love you. It's the life of Christ in me that will love you. Amen. Hallelujah. It's a lived life on the inside bearing the fruit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think let's go back a little bit. Romans chapter 7. Do you love him this morning? Amen. And verse 4. That scripture. Amen. Amen. Romans 7:4, the Holy Spirit says, "Wherefore, my brethren, he also become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God, &gt;&gt; mangoes, No &gt;&gt; apples. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the life of Christ will begin to flow. So the allegiance of your mind [Music] changes from the natural mind where we think like all the people and you begin to think like a god. What dies is your nature that dies. the old man, the traits of your father and your mother, they begin to die. Amen. Are you together with me? I don't say that you begin to look different but there are certain forced behaviors because you come from a certain lining I'll say this there are certain traits that will come forced in your life because you come from a certain line The German behave a certain way, the German behave a certain way, the Americans behave certain way and when you get a German and an American, put them together, if there's no Christ in them, they clash. A friend of mine took me to a place and said, "Come here, brother Steven. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you somewhere here in a very great castle, which was built hundreds and hundreds of years while the Americans were still living in Kenya. It's a competition. This nation against that nation, this tribe against that tribe. And some of these things, they get forced on you, short temper, short temper. It runs through the family. And when you sit down to listen to the history of the family, oh that great grandfather, he killed a person had a lot of temper. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, those things are true. But when Christ comes in, those are the things he believe in you. That's the killing of the nature. The killing of the Adamic nature is God coming in to make you stronger by making you weaker. He first of all makes you weaker because you lose all the things you think make you strong. me. I'm not ashamed. I can tell you to your face. He takes those things away. And you may think you are becoming weaker, but he'll make you stronger because he'll be giving you his virtuous life. Have you heard what I said? He'll be giving you his virtuous life. You learn how to be patient instead of blowing up with people that's killing that nature. That's the nature of Christ and be built on this earth here now is talking about this husband. called the nature of she was born or married connected with her first husband the first Adam by the adulterous wife of Eve's first wife. Amen. Amen. But she claims &gt;&gt; that this Adam, this first Adam is dead. Oh, sure. He died long a time ago. I'm reborn again. She said, "And I'm certainly married to the second Adam, Christ, the word, how notice what she loves, what her love You want to see who she is in love with. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to look at what she loves. for you to know whether the oldic nature is dead. The movies on your phone, &gt;&gt; the words that you use, the love of the nightclub. One time I testified to a certain lady with my wife. She was married to a very famous footballer in the 70s and 80s and she was such a nice beautiful lady. Her mother was a believer of this message and there was a man called Moses in Jericho. That was the husband. She loved nightclub. So she kind of believed in her heart but she was you know still bound &gt;&gt; by the first husband. Are you together with her? The first husband had so much bound her. And so one time she was sleeping and she had a dream that the end was coming and people were getting being bound and thrown into the fire and bound thrown into the fire. And then all of a sudden her turn came and she was getting bound. When she was being thrown into the fire, she woke up out of the dream and was jumping out of bed. So she decided to follow Christ. But the man Adam &gt;&gt; was not dead in her life. She lived very close to a nightclub. So whenever the nightclub would start to play, she would put on her dancing clothes and dress like she was going to the nightclub and she would dance. That's what brother Brandham says. Watch what she loves. Who is her husband? &gt;&gt; Her own fruits prove what she is. Exactly. Shows what she is. She was born fast to Adam because that's her natural birth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This here is a servant. But the nature of Adam is built around the human spirit. The human spirit, your choices, your desires, your reasoning are the things that must die. Help this one bear the fruit of the spirit. Okay. So the first influence of the fallen nature must die. Love for the things of the world. That's the nature that must die justified. Yes. But there must be a sanctification of your spirit. Amen. Listen to stretch of a perfect man now. Last for money, lust for big things. Last for popularity, these things are dead to the believer. Let me count them again. Last for money, it doesn't mean you must not work. I'm sitting at home. You know, l for money things are dead to the believer. No, &gt;&gt; what we mean is the love for money to the extent that when you go to work, you can misuse your pain and it doubles the figures. You love the money. That's what he means. Last for big things. It's not bad to have a big house. It's not bad to have a big car, but do you afford it? That's what he's talking about. L for popularity. Do you put somebody down that you may be up? That way of life must come, must die. All those things are dead to the believer. Amen. And you are not under struggle to change your life even when you cannot afford. You wait for the opportunity. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So as a believer, a tent or a cage, we don't care. a tent or a cottage. Why should I care? Live or die. Sink or drown. This is the thing that I am interested in the kingdom of God. Whether I maintain my home, whether I maintain my family, whe maintain whatever it is, let me maintain Christ our hope of glory. Then Christ build me up, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; into this. Let Christ be my head that's working through me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the old husband, the lust of the flesh must die. We die to the Adamic nature. The nightclubs are dead to the believer. The versions of the world are dead to the believer. Even the law is dead to the believer. The spirits of competition are dead to the believer. The spirits of marriage are dead to the believer. That's the nature. The husband of Adam nature must die. God help me that I may get into Galatians 2:20. that no longer I liveth but Christ lives in the next you know that must die is the denominational husband God help us this husband has a dying life if doesn't die easily. The denominational husband, &gt;&gt; Israel was redeemed from their denomination called Egypt. But when they were brought into the promise, they kept their eyes on the other denomination across the road. And they said to Samuel, "Give us a king that we may dance like that group there, that we may also do hard rock. And these fingers are tempted. My friend, you can ask Steen. He struggles with his fingers. But then his spirit says, "Stay in balance. Stay in balance. &gt;&gt; You are a child of God." And he says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; You know that husband must die. &gt;&gt; We need kings that we may be like, friends, we've got this thing here. &gt;&gt; But when you look at people post They forget their believers. They post they post people, you know, they are looking at those kings there. [Music] They've got good music, but they are horribly dressed and they post them. &gt;&gt; What are they saying? We want to be like those people. Give us those kings. They've never fully come out. Amen. Give us the cakes that would think like those people and plan our church like those people is old. &gt;&gt; Listen to this quote. So to be married to the second Adam, Christ the word, you must separate yourself by death from your first denominational husband because there isn't one of them that can take all the word of God. Did you hear that? You must die. Amen. That we fish out a little thing and I can be able to tell where you came from because some of those little things when I look at them. They are Baptist concepts, maybe Catholic concepts, maybe Pentecostal concepts. And then you know that this one here is Jacob's wife escaping with the gods of lab. Why would you bring those evil gods you know just come out come out of her my people. So the message of Israel reunion may have some components of marriage and divorce, but it's not about marriage and divorce. It's about the horning of the church [Music] at the end time. Everything must be horn out. The bride will have to hone away. Everything that cannot make the stretch of the path. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Like the church has been horny from the wide base of Ephesus then smaller much smaller smaller to smaller. Lord, this you're so small so that the headstone can fit. Even you as an individual, there are certain things that God wants to horn out over. [Music] &gt;&gt; He wants to horn them out. He knows you are your child is your child. I mean, you are his child. But you got things that don't belong to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it takes time with you. And sometimes the horning is a bit painful. He cuts off this. He cuts off that. And God is very good. When you are bleeding, he gives you a time to heal. When you are healed, then he cuts off this. Then you cry a little bit. He nurses you. He gives you a time to heal. That's what God is doing. Sanctification is not God cutting you down at once. God keeps horning you. Sanctification is continuous until we come to the stage of a perfect God is good. Now listen to the true Easter Seal. Now that's what God is doing to his church. He's horning off the people and making it in such a perfect way that when the headstone come it fits the building together. and then a resurrection of the world theme. The church is gone up. So he's taking the church into the horning because when Christ comes down Indian time. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First in the invisible union before the visible union. First in the invisible union. He must find After the when the the the Christian has been home, the church has been home, the house has been swept. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He wants to come into a clean house. He's taking the church into the horning because he must find a fitting spot where he can sit. Amen. Amen. To take on the whole arm of God. In this message, the prophet says there's no other age to come, but he's taking that Pentecostal church and taking the elect out of that. Taking the elect out of that. Out of what? Out of the Pentecostal church. So we come out out of Lisa and then he says horning it. Who is he horning? He's horning the one who has come out of organization. What is he horning of? Everything that belongs to organization, he holds it. What is he doing? &gt;&gt; He's killing that denominational husband, horning it so that when his ed comes upon it, we have to be like the rest of it. So every weight that we brought out of Pentecost, out of Baptist, out of Catholic, We throw it out of the window. We go to be born into this message. Amen. Are you together with me? He swore by himself in this message he says. And when he pulls that sinner through that blood cell, he cleanses him from all unrighteousness and brings him in by the Holy Ghost into himself. And the sinner is a new creature in Christ baptized in there by the Holy Spirit. Pulls him in here. And the part of man in there is godly. He's the son of God. He's the daughter of God. And the desires of the world is dead. between him &gt;&gt; and the world is the blood of Jesus. So you cannot pull those things across the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; So between the two husbands, the world and your nature, they are two. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean the two worlds. That's the denominational world and your fallen nature between you and your foreign nature. God push the blood between you and your denomination. He puts the blood. So it's impossible anything from your natural weakness God will not want you to cross the blood. Amen. Anything from organization don't pass through my blood. He puts the boundary of the blood. Are you under that? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to get into the message. I've already laid down the foundation. Praise the Lord. Amen. So tie your belts. Now you need to take your mind away from you know marriage and divorce because this is an invisible union. It's nothing to do with what we do here. When we are marrying these young people to one another, those are visible union where a physical man walks to the platform with a physical woman and they united into marriage. So take your mind away from that. God does not know you. by this. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; God does not you know you by this. &gt;&gt; God knows you &gt;&gt; by the seed &gt;&gt; that came from him. I've always &gt;&gt; tried to let you know &gt;&gt; that man was created in the image and likeness of God. God just cut off a piece of himself to make Adam. And in Adam was hidden the book of life that was supposed to multiply. Amen. And make children to fill the earth. But Adam failed. But those sons were there predestinated of God. Is there a soul store somewhere that was created before the foundation of? No. What is there is the predetermination of God that so and so will come in this age. So and so will come into this age. And whenever that age comes, those souls and those predestinated genes which were predestinated of God, they come out and take a body. But when they enter into the world, they enter a fallen world. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; They get out of the kingdom and they are blind to the kingdom. That's what Jesus told Nicodemus. Unless you are born again, you cannot see the kingdom, unless you are born again, you cannot enter. He was telling Nicodemus and Nicodemus who was the seed gene on the inside. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was the seed chin of Israel. When we come here on earth, we are blinded by denominationalism. We are blinded by the fall of the nature. Hallelujah. So when God comes in every age and sends the word, the word is looking for those seeds that have been cast in a body of flesh. That's what God is looking for. He's not looking for this. Amen. He'll bypass you. If you want a blessing from him, he will bless you. If you want healing, he can heal you. But when he's talking about salvation, he's talking about the seed on the inside. Amen. That egg, the egg which the mother eagle lost. Are you together with me? And when he's coming down, he look for this seed. He preaches the word. And that Jesus, it has a memory of where it came from. When it hears the word, it says, "Amen." And the word is not strange. Even if you've never heard the word, but if you are a seed gin came from God and you've never heard the word preached in that way, the day you hear it, you just feel like you've always heard it. There is something which tells you that's the truth and you take it. That's the truth and you take it. That's the truth, brother. You are an ego. The ego that was looking for the lost egg began to click in a certain way. And then this little igllet that had suffered in a chicken had a voice like this is not new to me. And when it tried the voice It found out that it could cry like that voice. The deep calling to the deep. There is a deep to answer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this little igllet tries to cry and immediately the mother eagle says, "You are the seed G. come up yonder. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why you are here today. That's why you are not in the Catholic church in the ugly country. You come to the right clicking. Amen. So now we are coming to the real point. Now I pray that the Lord may store this into your soul. God knows you by your city and this is the the the turning point here. So this union here we are talking about is the union of your invisible Jesus and the invisible God coming to unite with it. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And now he says here in the invisible union, excuse me, he says, "Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and his church." Now the spiritual union of Christ and his church. So in this reunion is God dealing with your seed gene of God and not just anoint your flesh which can produce emotion which is okay but going beyond that to that CG that he predestinated to come forth in this age. Are you together with me? So, it's more than just a little shaking. Amen. And then you say that well, the path is a mess. And then you want to fall and you roll and you come into a mess. No, &gt;&gt; this is an invisible union. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Invisible union. When the Lord comes like a thief slowly catches your soul and begins to build it and like a thief, he will take you into the rapture, invisible union, and put in his own life like the seed in Mark 4. When it goes into the ground, we know not how it grows, but it grows. Anyway, invisible union to impart life in the believer. There was an invisible union, hallelujah, in the womb of a virgin. Are you together with me? and the life come up. There was no emotion. There was no man holding. It was just the seed coming down to the egg. [Music] That's the way the Holy Spirit comes into the life. Now, why do we see people quake? I'll give you a quote here. Stretch of a perfect man. Not it. I'm not opposed to emotion. But the emotion and the baptism of the Holy Ghost are two different things. And the pastor has been preaching here through the church ages about the evidence. Many people look for the evidence, but you may never get what you're looking for. And yet you've got what matters in your life that you already have the baptism of the Holy Spirit but you are looking for emotion. Listen now. A lot of people go to the altar and pray and say, "Lord, forgive me." And a great experience of sanctification come upon them. Then you have a great time. Get up to the altar shouting. You go back saying, Bless God. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; He says, "No, &gt;&gt; you just started to a place where you can grow. You ain't done nothing yet. The only thing you done is just lay the foundation." Now, whenever the Holy Spirit comes down, There is always an emotion. Understand me right? When the Holy Ghost comes into group, not everyone that go through an emotion has got the Holy Ghost. Understand it right? Because the Holy Spirit has come down among the people. Sometimes as the prophet says people get conviction for sin a great experience of sanctification come upon them. Then they begin shouting at the oath is not saying they got the baptism of the Holy Spirit. There is a star of starring when the Holy Spirit many times came down in the meetings. But there is a difference between the baptism and these emotions. And sometimes you already got the Holy Ghost, but your problem is you are looking for emotions which may never come your way and you suffer all your time and you looking for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? He is your teacher. &gt;&gt; Don't go by experience. We've had a prophet messenger in this age. He has explained those things to us many times. We know &gt;&gt; see a great experience of sanctification when it comes down it is God dealing with your human spirit because that's where emotions dwell your reasoning your emotions, your affection, your memory. You remember how you drank, you are now remembering in that that time in the witchcraft shrine, you are remembering things is your human spirit. And then you cry &gt;&gt; in the spirit area is where we have all these emotions. But the seal of God does not come with emotions. It's an invisible union. That's how we get into marriage with God. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the natural &gt;&gt; cannot come into marriage in that way. Is only the spiritual to the spiritual G. That's when the Holy Spirit can bond to produce fruit. Listen to this quote. And so were you, sons of God and daughters of God. Before there even was a moon, stars or molecule, you were sons and daughters of God. for you only physical manifestation of the attribute that was in God at the beginning. For there is only one etern one form of eternal life and that was you before. Thou is talking about you before this. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; So now when it comes down to the union, he's coming to unite with you that was eternal before this. We understand it. I'm taking about 24 five minutes. He says, "Neither do you know when you was in your earthly father, but you are manifested in his image. In the image of God, you are made and you are manifested for the glory and fellowship of God. Therefore, as sure as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth, your spiritual G had to be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your attribute, your attribute &gt;&gt; is not your flesh, &gt;&gt; but the germ of life. That's what you are. And that's what the Holy Ghost comes to baptize. He comes to baptize that seed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why brother Brham says that the Holy Ghost can baptize your human spirit all the time and still go to hell. But if it touches the soul, that's where the life is. And there is no sensation there. one invisible junior to produce a spiritual life. And this man here then becomes a faithful servant. Don't go to the bar. He says amen. Don't fight. He says amen. Don't do marries. He says amen. Why is he getting the commands? The man at the center there has been renewed from an old man to a new man. Ephesians 2. Before you were born again, you were servant to the old man. But after the new part, you are now somebody who takes control. You are married to produce fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. In the visible union, flesh unites with flesh to bring forth fruit, the natural children. But in the invisible union, the invisible God unites with the invisible G that's in the soul to bring forth the fruit of the spirit. Is that amen? &gt;&gt; Okay. So the message invisible union is not a doctrine but the reality of the token life of Christ coming down in the end time with the seed Jes. And this token life is the Lord himself. Hallelujah. Invisible union is the prophecy to the church in the end time that the Lord himself the invisible broken life will come down. And what is he coming down for? To look for the seed that's on the inside there. The Holy Ghost is the high priest who walks through, he walks you through justification, sanctification and unites you into marriage with the seed gene on this side. So you are hidden beyond the veil. That's where you are and that's where God wants to come. That's why brother Brham says it he says to me Romans 7 is a prophecy for the church in the last day. It's the Lord himself coming down first into your soul to seal you. Then second, he comes to the church to bring the life of the word into the church. Now let's go to first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16. For the Lord &gt;&gt; himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of an archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise fast. that is the invisible union. The prophecy for the church in the last day, the Lord himself at the opening of the seven seals, he stood at the sunset mountainset and at the opening of the seal, Christ was being married. to his bride, the church, an invisible union. He's here to find a bride that would seal &gt;&gt; into the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. He says by visible union, the coming down of that headstone, what was it coming to? to the bride that's ready for marriage. &gt;&gt; Listen, do you love him? &gt;&gt; I know you do. &gt;&gt; Jesus is giving us this now. Jesus is giving us this description of himself in relation to the last age. The days of grace are winding up. He has looked from the first century right through the 20th century and told us all things concerning this age. Before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us, he gives us one final look. at his own glorious and supreme duty. This is the capsule revelation of himself. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, thus says the amen because this is where we are in the final work of the church. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we are praying for this food. No. Amen. Comes at the last. And now to the Loudesian churches, identify himself as the [Music] main. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Because I have found my bride. through the seven church ages. This seven which is the last is why I'm saying amen. That's why there is no other church. That's why the next is a throne, a kingdom. So why are we friends? Look at what is happening in the world. The pastor always talks about it. Even in the exaltations, look at Israel, our calendar. Look at Russia. Look at America. The whole world is becoming a war field. We have come to the end. Everything which spells amen. &gt;&gt; Everything which says life is over. &gt;&gt; The whole world has become a global sodomite condition prophesying the end of life. &gt;&gt; This is where we are. He says thus says the amen. Jesus is the man of God. Jesus is the so let it be of God. Amen stands for finality. It stands for approval. It stands for prevailing promise. It stands for the unchanging promise. It stands for the seal of God. &gt;&gt; So the person has come down &gt;&gt; as the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's here. So right now when we talk about the invisible union, there must be two. the eternal CDG and the person &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ himself &gt;&gt; who is revealing himself as the capstone headship to the church. So these are the two invisibles. The seed in you and Christ himself coming to baptize that seed in their time. The seed which is the entire body of Christ and then the Lord himself coming down as the message of the hour to baptize that sea. Amen. Let me break it up this way. Genesis 1:26. As I finish, Amen. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let us make man in our image." Amen. and let and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over the creeping thing that creepeth upon them. So the image &gt;&gt; here is Adam as an invisible He didn't have a body, but Adam coming forth as a spirit being. So this image &gt;&gt; is what God looks for to baptize with the Holy Ghost. That's the seed he looks for to marry as his wife. the invisible union. So the union is uniting with what? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; And what's the word? &gt;&gt; The word is the spirit of life. &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of life comes down in the end time to anoint and baptize his own bride. He's looking for the seed Jesus. And when he comes down as the revealed word, the word made alive, it's only the bride who has got a representation in eternity that will say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this union is a union with the world in the uniting time and sign. He says God is uniting his bride. She is coming together from east and from west and north and south. There is a uniting time and that's on right now. What is she uniting for? The rapture. God getting her ready. Uniting. &gt;&gt; What is she uniting with? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So listen now. &gt;&gt; This seed here. &gt;&gt; Let us make man in our own image. It was supposed to multiply. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And fill the earth. But at the end of it all, it was supposed to be gathered back together, one thing called the bride of witches. &gt;&gt; So the bride while they are called seeds in their individual identity, they are one seed, the bride of Christ. This is a little deep. You go back to the tape. He says, "Then here is this man." Now the man sinned and when he sinned and fell, then that little cloud there become mad and blood. Then the logos came down and made flesh and wrote among us to redeem this man back to the love of the father. And he came in by the Holy Spirit and chest sin out of the human and brings man back again in fellowship with God. So right now God deals with the inner man to resurrelect him by a union. Are you together with me? Until he comes on the side, there cannot be a reunion. So he says, I'm going down to unite myself with my bride. And this union is an invisible union to the single individual and to the entire body. We are united to produce the fruit. Amen. The fruit of the spirit an invisible union. Amen. Then invisible union as I'm winding up. Amen. He says that you are separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you are born again. Or you are married again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of the eternal life that was in you at the beginning found you. Hallelujah. Then again he says that's my message to you. That's a union. Union that you are dead to the old husbands, you are born a new try to dig them up. If you are born again Christian, that little gem that was predestinated to you, it's word coming on word on word on word on word and come in full stature Jesus Christ. That's right. So he can get his bride. Are you together with me? Oh, praise God. The word comes down, the Holy Spirit comes down, baptize you into the bas of the Holy Spirit. Not this one here, but the seed Jes. And when he gets in there, he's more like a B of a shirt. But as you feed on the word, he keeps growing and growing to crowd out all the darkness. And when you are light, then are you ready for the rapture? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Why? Because now you are light. You are light of his light. You are what? &gt;&gt; Of his word. Now that means the bride &gt;&gt; which is the seed has made herself ready. And what God will do is to come and change this thing so that it can come into the same form with inside life. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Are you born again? Children of God, you got the invisible union. That's why you're here. That's why you leave all those things. There is a power that is controlling you from the inside, controlling you purely. Amen. That's why you are becoming better every day. That's why when you make a mistake, you run back to the blood. There is a command from the center. Amen. There is a union. The person of the Holy Spirit has come into your life. Don't baptize this, but awaken the things. water it, bring it to life, into union, and be able to bring forth fruit. God bless you. Amen. Amen. The mind behind the invisible union, we can stand up. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Do you love the word? Amen. Amen. The invisible union is not about marriage and divorce, but it's God coming into your life in a secret way of the third pool to a wakened word which is on the side of you. And then that word seed gin once it's woken up then the life of God begins to form on the inside and then grow to the out. Where does the life begin from the holy of holies? Are you together with me? It begins from the inside. Then it pours out on the earth. So, I'm looking forward to looking at some of the children to see some of the children of God that are going to start pouring out that life in their life, in their work, in their places of work, in the way they dress, in the way they live, and life will start pouring out. Why? Because there has been an invisible union and that pouring out is the fruit of your union. God bless you. God bless you. Do you love him? Amen. Thank God for that union. Amen. Precious heavenly father, we give you thanks and honor and glory to know that you are God and you work in mysterious ways. Father, you explain to us how the seed goes into the ground and how it comes back again. Nobody know with how but it comes to life from the blade all the way to bringing forth itself again. Heavenly father that the life that you have hidden in the lives of your children may begin to pour out as a sign that the life on the inside is bearing fruit. bless your children in a special way in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] How deep the father's love for us. How vast beyond all measure [Music] that he could give his only son to make our riches.
