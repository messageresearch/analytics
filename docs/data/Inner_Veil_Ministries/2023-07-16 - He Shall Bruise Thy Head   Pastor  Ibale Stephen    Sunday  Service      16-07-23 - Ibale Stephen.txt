[Applause] to me that's enough worth everything Amen to know who we are and to know what you are raised up for now to know why we came in this season and I would relate with God amen amen it's very important so I bring greetings from Tanzania into soccer we had very very very wonderful meetings there with the brother Andrew from Germany when we left we went growth 900 kilometers but we reached safe and well amen Amina and we had a good three days of services amen amen so um I want to encourage the church that for you to be fully immersed in this message spend your time and study whatever we say here is from the message and as long as you are not studying the message it will be very hard for you to grow by just listening to the preacher okay amen amen because the preacher goes all over the place amen and if you have got no idea then you get it not a big problem to follow up [Music] I remember when we believed this message you we are digging through the messages especially when we were still young people I'm talking about 45 years ago amen we didn't have books as much as you have them now but you would hear of your brother about 200 kilometers away a kilometers who was a particular message you are looking for you and then you would go all the way to that place you sit down for two days you read that book you make your notes you come back amen amen but now we've got everything we have we needed amen Amina you see you just get in the back as you get out of the church amen Amina you pick just one book and then the following week you pick another day amen make sure that you read the message a week that will help you to grow amen are you happy amen Amina let's stand up and get into the teaching of the word this morning amen Genesis amen so before we read the words we thank you for you've given us this opportunity to come to the house of God in here we come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost to be taught of god father I pray that you may take the word this stores [Music] [Music] [Music] so we go to the Book of Genesis chapter 3. and I want you to settle down amen see what's the word is being told learn to sit in the presence of the holy spirit amen amen don't just walk out back and forth just sit yourself under the teaching of the Holy Spirit and as the spirit speaks to the church you are saying God help me amen I mean as we teach be in prayer God have mercy amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 15. this is after the Fallen amen Adam and Eve have eaten of the fruit amen amen so God comes down and the first thing he does is to Usher out a promise of redemption to come by the same woman who had fallen amen amen that's how God is good amen he looks at the fall and he says out of this I can bring something go down amen amen and I'll put enemy between thee and the woman he was addressing the serpents and between thy seeds never [Music] the head [Music] which ultimately became the Lord Jesus Christ you know the Holy Spirit was dealing with me on this area so it's one of the subjects that I took called when I was in Tanzania Tanzania and uh you know I had so I'll take foreign [Music] and so every one of us your life becomes a rebuke your life becomes a correction and sometimes your word may become a prophetic Ataris might be a rebuke somebody The Way You Walk might to be a rebuke to any corruption and sometimes your life becomes prophetic before it speaks to some people and God could do this for so and so God will do this for me your life becomes a prophecy in some ways we all have teaching experiences towards to one another because we have followed one another's lives here and then we see how they've come Progressive that life becomes a certain form of teaching maybe those Brothers but they come to a point and they gain stability they are like a plane which is taking off in the sky foreign foreign perfect strength by Perfect week amen which is the needs of a paradox because how can perfect strength be in perfect weekend so if we have weaknesses to take a text of weakness because we are always testifying we are strong [Music] you know because that's the way of Pentecost I'm increased with Goods we are strong we are more than Overcomers and he says now here I come with a subject and Minister people who always speaking about strengths I'm going to speak on weakness so you know and the scripture says you know we need everybody you know to stand and recognize who we are Twitter and your strength only measures in your weakness so what is perfect strength as opposed to perfect weakness what does that [Applause] come on if you got a big brother and somebody is intimidating you your strength is in the big brother so that's your perfect strength in your perfect weekend so Paul says so the scripture in itself teaches themselves abide in me as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself so perfect is hidden in the big brother because the big brother so I want us to look at the coming of Christ the coming of Christ was first promising Genesis 3 15. where he says that uh we bruise so the woman is the same that was prophesied to come in Genesis is the coming forth of the Lord Jesus Christ and the purpose was defined in Genesis 3 15. it is when Jesus said yes it is finished are you together with me he says it is foreign [Applause] we just have to get that understanding by Falling Back Into the Book of Genesis to understand in the foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is responsible for your foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because your human Spirit works by way of the Mind the reason okay you think you get some kind of uh uh conclusion so the human Spirit works from this mind area and that was the area that the Lord was responsible foreign just in a natural body of five senses and this kind of body is motivated by a human spirit amen I brought you towards that career chapter 12 verse I want us to go there and establish [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] but yet as long as he was born a soul like I said he needed the human Spirit to operate this body are you together foreign that's why she failed the soul and spirits that as long as we are born again the club of Glory comes around are you together with me so if we are going to fall you have to walk out of that Glory first but as long as we're in Christ we shall always inside [Applause] foreign are you together with me what is it so but you know what protected Adam was because he came forth in that original image but this is which means our body changes to keep us possible is to eliminate the human spirit foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] really not on your own understanding [Applause] amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the Soul MMA of the believer and sits in there is the determinant in everything that we do that's why the scripture says yeah so what God does to protect his elect is to take that element of college creator of eternal life [Applause] [Music] so when the Devil comes to the human spirit and it comes to a point yeah it requires now when they contact the soul the soul is full of the world you just stand like a Christopher praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen he fills the soul with the Holy Spirit and this forces your human Spirit to fullness the center is is to do with termination by a heavy blow for example um you have bruised over 20 are you together with me what is it so that's what Paul is teaching here in Romans chapter 12 verse he says that the seek you therefore Brethren a commercial find them that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice which is your reasonable service into reasonable service [Applause] so when your mind is your human spirit is [Applause] what happens now it is possible for you to submit your body [Applause] that you may prove what is good foreign [Applause] does not accept those things so to bruise the Serpent's head is Fallen civilization has imparted upon the believer's life to crash that there was Intelligence which is important to your human Spirit to crush the wisdom but he used to entice is to crash the wild desires foreign foreign [Applause] because [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and right to life uh [Applause] the day you die and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life are you together with what is it yeah so eternal life [Applause] was lost [Applause] amen amen so Satani bruised bruised on his heels it is amen Amina so what did the Satan put here that brings us to achievement what will that Holy Father purifying when it comes to purifying the earth [Applause] and the prophet called us the politics the Sinners the end the systems foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] yeah Mega Man no sending it but then the professor said into your um when the mega mind of the devil has to be bruised [Applause] is there atonement that's where we find perfect strength in the past next week where we cannot rely on ourselves because our Redemption is so a successful Minister therefore it is not necessarily a big church take an ISO but rather use your fullness in stewardship okay in the days eight Souls so this morning the holy spirit says your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he will be right there amen amen Isaiah 14 12. he says from Heaven All Lucifer son of the morning which weakened the nation amen Amina so he fell from heaven how has thou fallen from heaven okay so he says he fell from heaven and we know what the voice from Heaven says what the inhabitants of the yes because he knows that he has but a short time he fell from heaven and The Voice prophesies amen amen he is ruthless because he is in a competition [Music] you see what makes him better he's in competition but in the foreign are you together with me one reason if God makes another Pastor have a big church [Applause] that has nothing to do with me this is the measure that God gave me and I'm thankful for it if there is a better preacher somewhere that's okay with me this is the measure that God has given the moment they come my competition in spiritual things [Applause] that God is not in it foreign [Applause] you know designing Lucy and he said for those I will Ascend in heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God of the congregation in the sides of the north descended when you are thrown down he says he said no it's not of us competition hear the desire to ascend again constant competition he never rests on with the spirit of competition you lose peace because when this sister buys a good dress you'll shall buy a better one okay when this brother builds a good house you go to the internet you look for the best plan on your plans I'll put you down when this brother buys this car the other brother says they'll buy another one the brother gets a master's degree and then you say he has come to my level I'm going for repair today yeah there's no peace through the wicked there's no peace to the wicked that's what the Bible says in thy heart now the nature of ambition for the headships had reason above the love of human Spirit which is expressed by the mind to the heart a greater desire for power rude to be restless are you together with me what is it look look at the election the characters he says this was after now the temptation of the mountains all the Temptations He departed from him for a season yeah is in a constant competition [Applause] I was beaten out of heaven but I will Ascend again above the stars of God above the heights of the clouds [Applause] if I can't be him I'll be like him huh now but all this is formatted by a big man because so in Genesis 3 15. Christ comes down to bruise this desire foreign because when Christ comes down from heaven he comes as a stone cut without hands to bruise the kingdoms of this house are you together with me what is it yes sir so now I want you to see something here but in this coming intimacy that way to Bruce the Serpent's head okay Christ does it in a process [Applause] he does it in a process and I want to tell you right now but he's in a process the serpent sea is doing it praise God you're not the way it does amen he declares this intention I mean this intention while the prophets fast because we know Christ is the spirit eternal spirit the spirit of life [Applause] he became Jesus the Christ Crystal Crystal Crystal I mean I mean yasu Jesus the anointed are you together with me what is it are you together with it what is it so that eternal spirit after the fall in the garden he started coming forth amen amen to crash all the time Amen to promise and whatever the devil does comes crashing it until finally makes the kingdom here yeah when he says the Stone comes from Heaven welcome back without hands it's not a big Stone coming down it's the Lord Jesus Christ coming down [Applause] he has already redeemed and you are the Kingdom right now forget [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] he didn't know what he was doing okay they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days it couldn't come out then it was only being demonstrated but in the end of time why Indian time foreign [Music] waiting for to make it known in this last day waiting for it to be fully comprehended [Music] to prove that there will be a kingdom praise God amen amen that's why you don't drink your life amen Amina that's why you don't do all this kind of stuff you become a testifying life amen amen like the scripture says when he came you know and he came and brought in a city called Nazareth yeah which was spoken by the prophet he shall be called in that way Christo [Music] are you together with him what is it those things that our brother Wilson has taken time to preach here maybe I've been to take Wilson has taken time he was saying don't tell the world that this Jesus Anointed with the same spirit that created the heavens preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God that time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is repentance [Music] is the people so let's go to the bruising of disciples now he could never come forth as a millennial King in the Millennium before he impairs the authority of the devil [Applause] to impair the intelligence so being lord of the humanity that's what the Bible says and there was war in heaven what was the wine Heaven There yeah the war in heaven the devil Stanley just rejected the divine order yeah I will not be rude I have refused I also want to rule happened you see many times as long as we don't catch the concepts of the world then we shall be in trouble you read one thing to bruise foreign foreign [Music] and when it comes down here and he says War unto you but God is building a church amen is building a kingdom by Building a Church if there comes the performance [Applause] that stops the work of God amen amen that's exactly the mega mind of the enemies so we need to watch our positions in the body of Christ as long as you are standing in your positions that's your blessing in Christ Christian he says you are not going to be the only one day I also master rise and come to the same level are you together with me you remember when Jesus was here on Earth these sons of Zebedee the sons of Zebedee their parents and he says in the kingdom come on it brought a lot of indignation among the disciples as long as the devil can tear the order of the church he's tearing the kingdom foreign this is a kingdom Center a kingdom setup amen I mean he sounds like was he younger commanded submit yourself all of you be subject to one another with humility meaning be closed with brother alive foreign [Music] [Music] foreign are not a part of the Kingdom you're in trouble God is building a kingdom cartoon are you together with me when is it so he looked the word I said which was fought in heaven was rejecting the words that the word establishes another man without superintelligence so that intelligence so he looked at the intelligence are you together with him what is it that's how the devil was looking at it if I be wise I can take the kingdom he uses the mind yeah foreign [Music] he had to be part of the church are you together with me yeah what does that ever have to do with the bad stunning what does the devil need in the nightclub stunning yeah but if the devil is brought in the church and his weapons has always been a Mega Man [Music] the Bible says the serpent was most subtle thank you than the Peace of the field which is the Lord the fall is beginning here on Earth the Bible is pointing at a shrewdness the Bible is pointing to somebody's crafty Bible the Bible says [Applause] It's Beginning by pointing at a big mime [Applause] that's a mind he had in heaven now he around us he says like you've got another Point here according to dinner I'm going to anoint him and the Bible says he was mushrooms Ephesians he says put on the wall arm of God that he may be able to stand against the wires foreign with negative influence planting seeds that finally breaks the church praise the Lord this is what I preached in Tanzania then the spirits begin to wreck many of you know the attorney the church now numbers 25 16. listen now and the Lord spoken to Moses [Music] good mix and smite them you'll read as the scripture says 25 16 numbers praise the Lord for the exacts you with their wives why are we they have beguiled you ever said praise the Lord so bruising the Serpent's heads is not Christ using a hammer is Christ the crystal teaching you how to deal with the devil's wives to attempt to build Lordships over the children of God because when we fails he came with the same desires on how to maintain the lordship of Christ in the church okay [Music] Ephesians 4 14. are you together he says that we henceforth be no more children today Uganda and carried about with every wind of Doctrine then listen here by the Slate of men craftsness is what the devil is done comes to Bruce let this mind be here you know what why did she demons are helpless the serpent demonstrated his intelligence and the desire for leadership [Applause] [Music] I see it in the seat of God in the midst of the sea meaning I am literally worshiped among men amen amen he feels so great and how important he was [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] money yeah huh perfect strength in perfect week so now this king of tires he's lifting himself to a level where you can literally be worshiped and then he says yet thou art a man yeah and it says you are so anointed that you are wiser than Daniel that can be hidden are you together very anointed so the devil and those men with a staggering ability foreign [Applause] until some people can prove to you that's brother brother he's not even a prophet smartness but when Jesus in the life of the man has to bruise to bruise your intelligence to bruise your wisdom perfect strength in the perfect weekend [Music] and our strength is hiding behind the big brother 20 20. he says here with thy wisdom and we then understand thou has gotten the riches and has gotten golden silver and the next verses the source of this poem and wisdom magazine for the king of terrorists so Ezekiel 28 12. he says Lamentations [Applause] [Applause] praise God so since when was the king of terrorists ever in the garden of God that is Satan you understand displaying the same smartness which he displayed against Michael in heaven um he displayed in the garden embodied in the king of Tyrus so when a gift to given of God [Applause] exposes that way of working of the devil then it's Genesis 3 15. the wisdom the intelligence because that's the devil when he was sent out of Heaven he came to continue yeah he sent them the same powers Son of God how does he do that intelligence to appeal to your reasoning foreign amen Amina and when the tempter came to him the Bible if thou be a Son of God that's what he fights if you are a son of God amen I mean he says command that these Stones be made bread whatever Miracle foreign [Applause] the signs are not intended to back me it's supposed to back the world which is that's why Jesus did not bow down to the challenges are you together if you are a son of God do this to what purpose you remain the same devil not to do it foreign [Music] if somebody comes over the way down why did he teach this right question you know there is a purpose for every message that comes if you are a son of God command the stones to be bread um but let us look I got one in those temptations there was also a point about the bruising of the Hill so for a moment and he was proud about it I now own your inheritance yeah are you together with me he owned the kingdoms of this world on a personal note we are dealing with the bruising of the head amen the removing of human intelligence because as long as your human intelligence is dead because his wisdom I am dead number four I'm here to leave Jesus Christ [Applause] he has no weapons when that mind is bruised down God never uses a man who is still in charge of himself okay for God a man trusting in his intelligence and his ability because the over such a while God has no headship perfect strength in a perfect week when you look at a minister don't look at his qualities look at Christy are you together with him listen now Christ first of all gave him a personal revelation of who he was Christopher yes and after that he tore down the glory and the glamor of Peter before the people he was going to lead um are you together with me what is it he had to puncture the headship the intelligence [Music] in front of the people he has the keys so that they cannot rely on the Charisma of Peter um the Bible says but in the Christ I am a Christian that's what he was doing Peter get behind him [Applause] that he used to stand up to claim leadership foreign together so God never uses a mystery man amen amen who's Mystics in life have never been known are you together what is it so listen to brother Branham we said okay but I was told one time but over at The Ballad into it which they call the balance there was a fellow went over to get a job anymore and that's him to say in his name foreign foreign yeah are you together with me what is it I told people for four to five years standing behind the people I mean in front of the people the mystics and so we would be many compared to somebody that stood for three five years but we thank God for the rubber there is with blood drawn from me [Music] [Music] now what brother foreign foreign he looks at him and he didn't even understand yet again what love he was talking about when you're outside here the game is always very easy but come to the center there's a brother called Richard I mean there is a brother he's not Richard God but he's also called God yeah [Music] he was a sailor um those who go with big ships cutting woods from continent to continent okay and so Italian he traveled many countries but after some time of America he became a believer yeah he came to the church in Eddie mountain and he became a Believer he's the first man who made a friend named in 1988. when I first went to Canada I slept in his house his wife became sick and they tried every treatment and it was not working so he went to Brother Hilda Branch God bless him he's arrested now yeah and he says brother Harold what all gone hurt I think my wife is going through this because I've run away from the ministry foreign [Music] it was wonderful he told the church now let's stand up and go into the reading of the world when he read the scripture finished it started in five minutes daddy Captain he says brother hear the bread there's no food take over foreign you can take the people to the east at the end of the day you've said nothing uh praise God amen amen now he was a man with the temper yeah Jesus asks him a second time yes foreign temper are you together with him didn't even know what he was getting involved with Jesus came to die yesterday for the sinner but Peter says to him why can I not follow Thee I will let down my life for me Peter thought he could become the Messiah you know Peter's wavering nature was totally exposed so that we may understand today that God can never use a man who is full of himself Commando Peter Pedro he was having a monopolistic nature everything when you know the Lord says to him follow me he looks behind John is coming he says what will this man do come on he exposes his nature learning from Peter's experience God will allow your good personality to be dragged into the mind foreign [Music] [Music] perfect strength in perfect weakness and to make things worse they came to you Pastor mother's wife was there um why would God allowed this small bites woman because you know um to become nothing so that in you is Christ Crystal let's go to Philippians I'm trying to sum it up verse 8 a Canadian the testimony of Paul we are doubtless I count all things but laws for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord is suffered in the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ is giving us a family that I lose everything about me my wisdom my knowledge my history that I may gain Christ your girlfriend so you must lose your entire song to The lordship of Christ for you to be used the real thing is nothing in my arms I pray tonight but I need you to correct foreign [Music] [Applause] Jesus our lord I Die daily in February probably John yeah [Music] Kingdom should start within me the serpent said um say to the Lord Jesus start with me bruise run out to my intelligence amen Amina and you bound to be back you are bound to be backsliding constantly your community so it takes a constant prayer to God says how much more I am going to have to stay there stay there Dead all the time to stay right with God and so we all have to do that just die out of yourself and that's going and that's getting good God's way amen so every one of us we need the Power Rangers um emptiness with himself release himself amen Amina brother the Bible said when a man thinks himself is something he's nothing it's actually it's nothing that's exactly right you think yourself nothing come down because amen you are trying to feel yourself that's the biggest job for the church but that's rough but it's good the moment that to become my promises foreign money [Music] [Music] [Music] that's our strength behind the big brother and brother Branham says this is a very strange subject to know so much bringing it among the Pentecostals who always speak about power and the strength I'm not normal together the greatness is you can do nothing is that's what the Lord tells us so all that we want to be Let It Be Christ [Music] ah I see in US [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] closer foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I say it now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is already building
