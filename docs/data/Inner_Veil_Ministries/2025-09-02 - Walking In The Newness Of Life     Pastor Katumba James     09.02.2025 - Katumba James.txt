every moment we Talk of the Nation Uganda you are in the center of the focus of the message [Applause] thank would like to thank the Lord that God gave us Grace at this time round we have always had our celebrations Ina but this time we said let us make a shift and we thought of having celebration in ginger celebrating the [Applause] achievements of our family academic achievements of my wife academic achievements of my daughter Fai and there was nowh that we could celebrate without this church being represented because this is our fellowship when we are in chinger and you know you do not know what impact this church has had on my family every moment when we are down in campala we think about this church we know the Lord is doing a lot through you and any moment we go on our knees when we are praying we are praying for this church we like to appreciate God for Pastor James kba and our precious Pastor Ste and their families they mean a lot to us they have mentored my children and even when they are out there they have tried to replicate this church sometimes they are always given tasks and always ask them how does Ging Church do this so this has been a point for benchmarking you know sometimes you can be close to Gold close to but you may not know that you really have gold people from a every moment they cherish that which you have they talk about it they want to be close to it but you who is close you may not see it I pray that the Lord God who said beginning at Jerusalem he had a reason why he said beginning at Jerusalem and I than God that P chose to begin in because charity begins at home let's keep giving him strength and giving strength to Pastor Jac such that when they are out there they can lift that flag higher and higher I bring you greetings from my pastor and all the saints who knew of our being here and we are looking for a time when we shall when I will come specifically to have fellowship with you here because with my wife so long as she's best here she specifically comes for Fellowship here not long ago just I want to end with this testimony Pastor just let me give this testimony uh I've been in the civil service for a long time until last year around November when I retired but yet when you look at me I'm still young but I said not it is time for me to retire from the Civil Service and enter into the service which has no time limit it has no age limit it has no conditions set to hinder me to serve him and has been Joy on my heart for this time to come but before this time came some years ago when I was a teacher on the blackb I was in prayer and something happened and it was hard for me to believe that it would come because I didn't know how to go about it but right there in prayer I was caught up in a vision and the Lord spoke to me and told me I have made you a head teacher amen this is several years ago and I said God how will I so much salt from the Blackboard to that office but about two three years ago when I was substantive Deputy I didn't know that the Lord was out to fulfill this before I can retire but just as he spoke he brought it to come to pass I've given this testimony for some of you who are struggling with your status God remains true even when it is remaining one day he will fulfill it otherwise I I'm here to enjoy the service [Applause] you appreciate brother amen certainly one day we shall find out when he will be in ginger and then we shall have him come and minister to us amen do you appreciate the testimony amen amen really thank God a lot was said yesterday by hope and then

I [Music] am I am his and I know him [Music] amen amen amen praise the name of our Lord very interesting song Praise the name of our Lord and you know the song says I am sealed are you sealed praise the name of the Lord when they were singing and ending it something came to my mind that you get the seal not at the end of The Journey but at the beginning of the praise the name of so you don't look for the at the end but you get it at the beginning very interesting praise the name even the token is given at the beginning so if you have not got the token if you have not got the se you not started the journey praise the name of our Lord so let us stand up and then go to the scriptures in Romans chapter 6 praise the name of our Lord let us first pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we are so thankful and grateful unto you Lord that you give us the seal you give us the token right at the beginning of the and we are thankful you father that the spirit of God works in our MST to remind us these things to encourage us these things if we are not mared how would they know that we are different from if we are not sealed how shall we reach the end we are thankful father for the Seal of the holy we pray that Lord as we go into the word may you speak to us father may you reveal yourself to us father and manifest us your love and goodness bless us all together Heavenly Father every one of us Lord Jesus to partake of your divine nature according as you purposed for us this day the SI in our Lord meet all the needs of your children glory and hon of your name in the name of the Lord Jesus this amen amen let us go to Romans 6 we're reading from verse one to verse 4 I was wondering I had something to preach in the course of the week then when I reach this morning and then I was wondering what should I Minister and then what was in my heart turned away and then I got something new here which I believe will be of blessing to all of us in Romans 1 vers Romans 6 verse1 verse4 the Bible says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God for how shall we that are dead to sin live and no longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the new of life May word you may be seated so this morning we want share on walking in the newness of Life walking in the newness of Life praise the name of our Lord and I believe the Lord will give us Grace praise the name of our Lord to understand our Christian walk from the very beginning praise the name of the Lord now newness of life that means it is the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord and you can never be a true Christian you can never be a true message believer without the life of Jesus Christ without the life of Jesus Christ you have not started praise the name of the Lord You've not started so he brings it right at the beginning praise the name of our Lord and so that's why Jesus told the apostles that don't go out unless you wait in Jerusalem for the spirit of God himself to come down when they were with Jesus Christ they were not converted but now when the spirit of God came down on the day of Pentecost then they were converted and then you'll see that a number of places in the scriptures as long as people had the word of God of that time praise the name of our Lord like when we can start the story from the book of Act 2 there were people who were at Jerusalem and then when they saw the apostles and all the 120 you know they were speaking in Tong you know then they were saying these people must have drunk new wine but it was in the morning and then when Peter preached to them about the Fulfillment of the scriptures they were convicted and so that's the same thing that the the Holy Spirit does you know our interface with the Holy Spirit you start interfacing with the Holy Spirit right when you are still a sinner and it is the holy spirit that anoints a minister to preach to you the gospel it's the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Ghost is using a minister and then that same Holy Spirit that's using the minister to speak the word of God the same holy spirit that comes down in your heart brings conviction in your heart so you the Holy Ghost starts dealing with your life right at the beginning when you are still a sinner the Holy Ghost does not wait from afar he actually send the minister and then he anoints the minister to speak particular words to your life and now when those words are spoken to your life you are convicted it is the holy spirit that convicts you you don't convict yourself and now when you get convicted then you say Lord what shall I do like on the of Pentecost asking what shall we do men and Brethren then what did Peter tell them repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that was the spirit speaking to them and so now when they repented and they were baptized the Bible says 3,000 were added to the church how are they added to the church they received the baptism of the holy spirit for them they didn't have again to wait another 10 days it wasn't that it's the moment you receive the word and obey the word the spirit right away comes praise the name of the Lord It's Only in a place where Philip went to Samaria and then they had to wait Peter and John coming to play their hands on them other places why did that happen in Samaria because Peter had the keys he had open he had he open the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost to the Jews then in Acts 8 he opened the Holy Ghost to the samarians acts 10 he open the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles and now from that time the moment you obey the word of God and you do what the word of God is telling you the Holy Ghost comes down praise the name of the Lord that's what the scripture is praise the name of the Lord now let us go in this message he says in the message Church age and anoint thine eyes with i s that th may see now that one is picking it from Revelations 3 praise the name of our Lord Revelations 3 and then Verse 18 he says I canel the to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich and white rment that thou may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with iel that thou mayest see Verse 18 Revelations 3:8 then he says let us go back to the church age book that is Page 352 and then paragraph three he say and anoint th eyes with i that may see then brother says he does not say that you have to buy this iave that's a very interesting thing praise the name of the Lord oh no there is no price tag on the Holy Spirit that's what saying there's no price St on the Holy Ghost In other words God does not say you first go and do this then I give you the holy GH it's not that there's no price T want you to pick it you Ty there is no price t on the Holy Ghost okay right there that's good he says there is no price tag on the Holy Ghost it is freely given how is it given just obedience praise the name of the Lord just obedience praise the name of the Lord doesn't attach anything on the baptism of the Holy Spirit other than obedience so the question is if you say you don't have the Holy Ghost for one year two years years four years years does it me that you've not been obeying then why are you walking praise the name of but he says there is no price St he's not demanding you go and do this [Music] year this year Peter told them just repent and repent means you acknowledge your weaknesses it means you know your condition Lord this is my station Lord have mercy upon me Lord forgive me and now when you receive that word and Obey that word then the Holy Ghost comes down he says there's no price praise the name of the Lord no price on the Holy Ghost it is freely given praise the name of but now when you when you look at this other the same scripture in Romans in Revelations chapter 1 and verse it says I the to buy me of gold tried in the fire and brother says this is character and character you go through trials you go through a very fun so God does not take you through trials he does not take you through a very fun SP praise the name of Lord then he says now I can give you the Hol brother Bram says here there's no price on the on the Holy Ghost then the scripture says what Pastor was reading last week Galatians 3: Mage church he says he does not say that you have to buy this ice Slave oh no there is no price tag on the Holy Spirit received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Fai Galatians 3:2 then brother Bram says without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the word and without the spirit a man without the spirit is blind to God and his truth now you can find out yourself you can find out whether you're blind to God and His truth praise the name of our Lord now we shall understand as we go by and praise the name of our Lord now in the message you must be born again brother Bram says so now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again but you must now we as English speaking people understand what the word must means that is it is absolutely you've got to do it it is a must not you ought to you would better be off if you did but you must be born again or if would just take that word this morning and break it down what it means how that it is totally impossible and then if it is that essential and that great that it is totally impossible to enter in the Kingdom of Heaven or even to see it until you were born again and so many different interpretations of the word born again we all to see it we ought to seek it out with all our hearts and find out what it means so now Jesus told them let us go to John 3:3 praise the name of our Lord John 3 and then verse he says Jesus answered and said unto him very very I say unto you you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God that's the scripture and then when you continue reading in verse five Jesus answered I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now you see so to enter the kingom you must be born again to see the kingdom you must be born again where is it given at the entrance at the beginning it's not given to you at the end but given right at the because Jesus is the door even when they were getting into the wedding garment they had to be closed at the door so even the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ gives it to you at the beginning because if you are not with the Holy Ghost you're not in the Kingdom if you don't have the Holy Ghost you start the journey so he gives it at the beginning and it is freely given by your obedience to the word of God praise the name of the Lord now still in that same message you must be born again in paragraph 43 he says and remember to the first thing until you are born again you will never understand that's brother saying twice he spoke it except a man be born again he cannot enter into the king except a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom now that is pun the word in the making all those words it says they tell me that they had to write it out they and when they say very very that is a punctuation like a I say you and the word in one place or many places it islated that this is what you should doely absolutely I say unto you who said that did a prestor evangelist pop God himself now there is no excuses then he says he will in nose no wise at all canot in any other way no matter how great he is what his name is how big he is how popular he is he cannot even understand the kingdom of God until he is born again it's a great subject very I say unto you watch go get the Greek translation you'll find not to see with the eyes you see with the heart see you can't see the kingdom of God with your eyes because it is a spiritual Kingdom see otherwi you will never be able to understand the kingdom of God until you are born again it's all UNR mystery and when you are born again the plans of the Kingdom the kingdom itself becomes real to you that's what is saying he says if you are not born again brother you're going to St at the word of God so we need the new new B is not given to us at the end let me bring it the other way the new is not the climax the new is not the top but the new it's at the beginning praise the name of our Lord the new bus is the door into the kingdom now if you not born again you are still outside of the king and now the the the the thing that God requires us to enter the kingdom hear the word have faith in the word the word you enter into the kingom then how can you have in your mind I've taken 10 years without the Holy Ghost you've been outside the kingdom now God cannot play games of hide and that's not God praise the name of know praise the name of the Lord the condition of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Obedience of the word nothing more to that so the question is are you obedient to the word or you're not obedient let us go to Acts chapter 5 praise the name of our Lord acts 5 and then we read in [Music] verse 32 the Bible says and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey him praise the name of the Lord so if you don't have the Holy Spirit it means you're not obedient praise the name of that's the thing he says he has given the holy to those who obey him and any work in Salvation it's all about obeying God obeying the word of God praise the name of our Lord let us get another scripture here because the Bible says a witness of 203 let every word be established let us go to John chapter 14 praise the name of our Lord John chapter 14 and then we read in verse 21 it says he that has my Commandments and keepe them it is he that love me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him I will manifest myself to him it's a promise the Holy Spirit speaks to the word what is your response when you hear the word of God he says if you have my word and you keep my word how do you keep the word of God you keep the word of God by obeying that word that's how you keep it and you keep what is precious to you praise the name of the Lord you keep what is precious to you like the banks know how to keep the money they have some kind of thing like I'm forgetting how they call them but they dig underground in some places and then they get SS and to access that you may find that in some areas the bank manager has the password or the key even the accountant has another person has about three people have to be present when they opening the self and each person does something for it to open they Al is around they have cameras around so you just can't break into it they know how to keep they keep treasure so now even us if we receive the word of God as a treasure praise the name of the Lord you keep it praise the name of the Lord you keep it in your heart and when you keep it in your heart you are meditating on the word you are thinking about the word you are talking about the word you are obeying the word what does Jesus say it is you that love him praise the name of the Lord that shows you love him like have an illustration here you know these days it is hot praise so you need to drink water when I came in I felt I need drink more water I drun before I came but now I'm moving with this bottle in town everybody said that man wants not to really I keep it because I have the water inside of it but the moment the water is over I try to look where to put it immediately put it because what I need is not there praise the name of Lord but I keep it because there's something I need there's something I value that is the same thing with the word of God you should keep the word of God in your heart because you value it you treasure it now Jesus says if you keep the word you value the word you treasure the world that shows you love him now when you love him what does he do he says I will manifest myself to him very simple have the word keep the word obey the word then he comes and manifest himself he reveals himself to you praise the name of our Lord then in verse 23 he says Jesus answered and said unto him a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love me he's putting an emphas if you say you love God you'll keep the word you will cherish the word praise the name of our and then when you do that he says my father will love him and he doesn't come doesn't stop saying that I love him it doesn't stop at that but then he says and we will come unto him and when they come unto you what do they do and make our B in him that's the BM of the Holy how hard is that very simple you've heard the word cherish the word love the word obey the word then the Holy Spirit himself who has given you that word will come into your heart where the word is that's the BM of the holy spirit it's not complicated and this happens at the beginning it doesn't come at the end it comes at the beginning praise the name of the Lord so the problem is why don't you have a heart that want receive the whole of God praise the name of the Lord now in that message you must be born again and then verse4 paragra 44 says like a contractor to build a building unless he could read the blueprint there's no need of him trying to build the building now he's putting it to theal like the church we have if we get a contractor to come and build it brothers who are Builders here we have our brother Moses we have brother Andre we have brother St if you go to them that you want to build for them to build for your house they will ask you what kind of house maybe you give them a plan now if you give them a plan and they don't know how to interpret the plan they're not going to build what you want they not how are you going to do something you don't know how so brother bam says if he doesn't understand the blueprint so he can't build and then when he understands the blueprint then he knows how to build the building that is the way it is that's what happens about building the kingdom of God you got to understand the blueprint and You Want Build and you want know the blueprint until you are born again and when you are born again and then you deny the blueprint what takes place so then he says he's trying to give explanation on the word unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of and to see is to understand praise the name of our Lord so to understand the kingdom of God comes when you have been born again praise the name of our so to understand comes by the new birth and then you'll appreciate the things of God then you know this is I'm in the kingdom of God but now if you don't see how can you enter the door when you can't see he says unless you are born again you cannot see you cannot understand unless you are born again you cannot enter you don't know the door it all comes by the new bus praise the name of our Lord so then the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord let us go to Hebrews chapter 6 Hebrews chapter 6 and then we read in verse one the Bible says therefore living the principal doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not the laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God now he's saying the principle doctr of Christ that's the beginning and then which are these doctrines of Christ which at the beginning laying the foundation of repentance fa toward godse and of the doctrine of baptism it says baptisms so there is water baptism then there is baptism of the Holy Spirit he says there are the principle Doctrine the beginnings not the end praise the name of Lord they the beginnings and if you want to reach somewhere you're not going to stay in primary one praise the name of how will reach Senor University still in primary but you see we are saved at different time praise the name of our there are those who have gone ahead then there are those who are beginning who need to be picked up to be taught to have faith in God to be taught how to repent to be taught to forgive one another to be taught that the reason there is a reason to be taught live this kind of things to be taught how to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to be taught how to receive the Holy Ghost praise the name of our be taught about the laying on of hands that if you are a Believer at home and one of you one of you is sick you can lay hand on your brother you can lay hand on your husband you can lay on your and you believe and the scripture is saying Beginnings praise the name of the Lord so you go forward and then you come back you go forward and then you come back but to grow praise the name of our you need meat praise the name of our Lord you need to move forward praise the name of our Lord now let us continue in that same area verse two of the doctr of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God praise the name of Lord it's the beginning baptism in the name of Jesus Christ baptism of the Holy Ghost at the beginning praise the name of the Lord without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have not entered into the you are still but how long do you want to be outside you say I've been outside one year why don't you enter it has no price tag just obedience and then you enter praise the name of our Lord in Hebrews chapter 5 the scripture says verse 11 of whom we have many things to say and had to be uttered seeing you are D of hearing but when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teaches you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and have become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is UNSC in the word of righteousness for he is a baby then Hees to say but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who are by reason of Youth have their senses exercise to discern both Good and Evil praise the name of Lord he says the principles you know the beginnings for babies praise the name of the Lord but if we are grow if we are to mature up we need the meat praise the name of our Lord going higher praise the name of our Lord but you see all the stages of our Christian walk our conviction it is the Holy Ghost who does our justification the Holy Ghost does that our sanctification is the Holy Ghost our baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost then there you've entered the kingdom but even to grow in the kingdom it is the holy spirit he teaches you he guides you he you he takes you into different trials our Lord Jesus Christ could not go into the trial without the baptism of the Holy and the Bible says when he was filled with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost took him to the Wilderness to bet tried of Satan praise the name of the Lord so they come when you are born [Music] again praise the name of they come here when you are born again and it's the spirit of God that gives you the ability to overcome the trials The Temptations you don't overcome them by yourself it is the spirit of God that has convicted you and then you accepted the Lord Jesus as your person and then the spirit justifies you the spirit sanctifies and the spirit fills you so every day you walk it has to be the spirit of praise the name of our now in the message questions and answer of 1954 he says there is only one scripture in the entire Bible that people was reaped and that was those who was baptized by John the Baptist before the Holy Ghost came in Acts 19 verse5 told them that heart be rebaptised again in the name of Jesus Christ in order to receive the Holy Ghost he's not putting it at the end he's putting it right at the beginning then he says now you don't have to be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost because you can receive the Holy Ghost when your heart is right not difficult he says to receive the Holy Ghost your heart has to be right so the question is praise the name of if you say you have not received the Holy Ghost 10 years I've been looking for the holy what's wrong with you why don't you have a right praise the name of the Lord so you see it is a misunder it's a misunderstood way of how the Holy Ghost comes in our Liv and you say I accept the Lord Jesus as my personal Savior and I've obeyed everything God wants me to and God has never given me the Holy Ghost that's a false witness because the Bible says here repent and be baptized and you shall receive and brother Bram says as long as your heart is Right you've obeyed the word of God then the Holy Ghost comes then he says because in Acts chapter 2 Peter give a formula to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but in Acts 10 ver 49 God turned around and gave the Gentiles the baptism of the Holy Ghost before they was ever baptized at all you see so you see it is the condition of your heart what is the condition of your heart now our walk with Christ should be so personal so personal that you love him with all your hearts all your mind praise the name of our and that's how the Holy Spirit Works in our lives praise the name of our Lord now in the message the Queen of Sheba and so she took off and here is something else that had to confront her the children of isma was on the desert Fleet footed Riders robbers murderers what a pray that would be for them why that great band of men could ride in on that little company and mop it out in a few moments time and look at the thousands of dollars of money and well she had on those camels why was it set up for them but you know what her faith and desire to see the kingdom of God God stopped it for her he made a way for her and I said to you both visible and invisible audience if your heart is so hungry and thirsting to come to God God will make a way for you to get to him he always did it and he will always praise the name of that's all you need you heard the word said Lord I need more of you transform me prise the name of our that's what you need when you hear the word tring at the word you know you desire more of God in your life Holy Spirit comes and takes over your life he fills your life and he takes leadership of your life like this woman the Queen of Sheba you know she had to give all and God made a way for her praise the name of our Lord and that's the same thing that we need praise the name of our Lord is when you hear the word obey the word of God surrender yourself to the word of and now when the Lord himself comes by in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit now I'm not saying that should be at the end praise the name of at the beginning praise the name of Lord it comes at the beginning not at the end praise the name of of Lord so he starts with you and allow him to work upon your life to bring you into the image of Jesus Christ praise the name of our so we need allow God that he can work in our lives to bring us into the image of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord let us go back to Romans chapter 6 and then verse four he says therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of Life praise the name of our Lord he says we should walk in the newness of life so then how do we walk in the newness of life and now this new life is the life of Jesus Christ another words the life is in you the Life of Christ Is In You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot be the newness of life so it has to be the spirit of God coming down in your heart and when the spirit of God is in your life then you are in a new life you have been born again you are a new creation we are not looking at becoming the new creation at the end but we are telling you become a new creation right at the beginning praise the name of our Lord not at the end but at the beginning praise the name of our Lord and so when you are new when you have been created praise the name of the then you live by the spirit of you walk by the spirit of you are no longer yourself but it is Christ that is in you that lives his life praise the name of God is not asking you first do this then I'll do this no salvation is all of the lord it's all the working of God from the beginning up to the end What You Do Lord here I am take over my life praise the name of our Lord take over my life that's what you need all the working of the Lord in the message revelation of Jesus Christ brother says he has made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he has made us not I have made myself you'll fail along the way but allow him to take over your life from the very beginning when you accept him as your personal savior that's the time you say Lord here I am take over my life allow him to work in your life what is pleasing unto him you don't begin giving yourself what to do just allow him to take over your life allow him to bring the conviction allow him to bring the justification all to bring the sanctification all to F you with the Holy Ghost allow him to feed you with the word allow him to raise you up allow him to adopt you it's God doing all those things so he says he has made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord praise the name of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings and spiritual Kings we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on the throne but right now We Are Spiritual Kings and we re over a spiritual King he has made us praise the name of our every one of us he has made us that should be your confession in the midst of the challenges that come at your work in the midst of the challenges that come at home ask God lord here I am I stand in this challenge I stand in this trouble Lord come down and show your praise the name of our Lord he has made us he's the one who gives you the ability to the right thing praise the name of our Lord is the one who gives you the ability to go to the right place why is ever present to help you in the challenges that come in life then in the Philadelphian Church age says but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice the blood of bulls and [Music] goats made nothing it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect praise the name of our Lord then he says the Jews would not take that but not about the Philadelphian age and yes the other ages to did they really accept this reality in Christ no sir even though R brought the truth of justification the Rish church and it stand counter at the Orthodox Church still cl to work now works are fine but they cannot save you they don't make you perfect it is Christ perish and it's not even Christ and works in other words you don't say I have Christ and now let me add Works only it is Christ Alone this age begin began the years of arminianism Amis that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood but it SS of nothing but the blood and my own conduct now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from the start to the Finish it's all God let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses let his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and my mouth let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness that I have done no sir is my life praise the name of our that's how we need to see that we walk in the newness of life you're not working in the newness of Life by your ability you'll fail on your own but now when you have the spirit of God and the spirit of God takes over your life he knows every place he knows every Junction he knows every turn so then you yield yourself to the spirit of and then the spirit of godge over your life and then he will lead you up to the destination praise the name of our let us go to Ephesians chapter 2 and then verse one walking in the newness of life you can never walk in the new by your own self it has to be the spirit of God who comes when you're starting the journey to guide you all the way praise the name of like it was interesting when they were singing that song I am sealed the SE happens at the beginning these containers before they are destined they put a SE the same thing with God a seal on us he wouldn't allow them to go and preach without the Holy Ghost wait until you receive even our Christian walk a true Christian walk means you have been born again you have the Holy Spirit otherwise how would you overcome Satan you can't praise the name of Lord it takes God at the beginning you to fill you with the Holy Ghost to reach your destination praise the name of the Lord so then he says in Ephesians 2 verse1 and you has quickened you know that quickening he makes you alive dead in trespasses and sins so when you had the gospel and then the Holy Ghost convicted you you repented of your sins you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you receive the you know the Forgiveness of sins you are Justified the same Holy Ghost sanctifies You by separating you from evil things you don't like the other things you don't like the other you don't like the other it's the same Holy Spirit and then the same Holy Spirit fills you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when he FS with the baptism of the Holy Ghost then the life of Jesus Christ becomes ested in your life praise the name of the Lord where in the time pass you walked according to the course of the world according to the course of the world according according to the prince of the power of air the spirit that work in the children of disobedience now he's saying there is a change in your life when you didn't have the new life you walked by your thought anything happens you just do the way you want to do praise the name of our if your wife doesn't obey you you can beat her that's in the old life if your wife has L to give you food you abuse her that's the old life but if it is a new life there is the sweetness of God bitterness has gone away even in the midst of being challenged you will hold Yourself Praise the name of our so you have turned away from the things of the old nature you have a new nature come by the baptism of the Holy so the life is changed praise the name of Lord your life is different there is something different praise the name of our Lord now let me just read this message he says in the message the Queen of Sheba he says if it is the truth I want it then power in every treasure that you've got all your heart all your soul all your love all your devotion all your thoughts all your songs everything that you have give it to Christ and if it's truly the son of God and has raised from the dead support it with everything you are so you become so salty until the people of your community will say if there ever was a change it is in that person there there you are if I'm ever a Christian I want to be like that man or that woman they have love they have joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience weakness and so forth the nine fruits of the spirit dwells within them they are not easily provoked you can't make them you can't make them mad at you they will not become hungry they are so loving that in their very presence you feel Christ there you are there you are that's what the church needs not because you can argue about your relig standpoint that doesn't minute it's your life that proves what you are that's what proved what God when came down it was his grace that Prov that he's the god of Grace this the children of Israel praise the name of our Lord so there is a change in our lives when the Holy Ghost comes he lives his own life and that's the newness of life we should walk in How often daily praise the name of the Lord our walk in the newness of life doesn't stop here at church doesn't stop at home doesn't stop where people know you but it's a life that you live and that newness of life you live it unconsciously praise the name of you know in Psychology they teach people how to behave well how to hold your temper and somebody was telling a woman who complains whenever the husband comes that when your husband is is coming you take this medicine but don't swallow it so keep the medicine in the mouth he's complaining he's complaining when he finishes you that is psychology that's not Christianity the is a life that is inside that is a life that you manifest notet about I'm going to meet hard people what am I going to do me just maybe go this way no that's not Christianity in the world they teach how to behave but still those things can be proved that it is fake praise the name of but this is a life that comes from within like brother gives an illustration of the ship it will grow because the life is inside it will come and Grow Ave it clean from inside out the oil comes from inside the oil comes from inside and then comes on the skin and then it keeps it clean there's a newness of life when you have the spirit of God in us you're not going to be be all the time somebody has done you wrong you can't even forgive them all you talking about that where is your forgiveness where is the newness of Life praise the name of our there is a change that happens when the Holy Spirit comes down let us go back to Ephesians chapter 2 and then verse verse three among whom also you had conversation the times past in the lust of your flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of WRA even as others but God is rich in Mercy for his great love with loved us even as we were dead in sins has quickened us together to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ verse seven for by grace are you saved faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any should burst praise the name of our Lord we are saved by grace so it's God that comes down in us to live his own life praise the name of our Lord allow him to start to live his own life allow him to take over your thoughts allow him to take over your mind allow him to guide your actions to guide your decision making what you decide at a place of work what you decide on the journey

praise the name of our reveal himself to you praise the name of the Lord so you don't walk by your ability but then you walk by the grace of God that has saved you we need to walk in the newness of Life at our homes praise the name of our let there be a testimony that this man is Born Again is born again the differences at home should not separate you from Christ praise the name of Lord they challenge at place of work separate you from Christ you know there are some people who don't come to church because the wife has done this or the husband has done this or the parents have done this

you're not going to fulfill the last of the flesh when you deny the spirit leadership Satan is going to take over but allow the spirit of God to take over all your life your thoughts your desires your intent your targets allow the spirit of God take over then the spirit of God will give you the strength to fulfill his word when they hate you the spirit of God will bring love you know the Bible says

reality that you have been changed no more evil thoughts no more evil desires but the Life of Christ himself living in you we need to walk in the newness of praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says verse 24 and they that are chrises have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts praise the name of the Lord have you crucified the flesh the Bible says they that are Christies so if you are of Christ you crucify the flesh the Bible says the body motify this body that the spirit can take charge over your life then you can walk in the newness of life not only on Sunday not only
