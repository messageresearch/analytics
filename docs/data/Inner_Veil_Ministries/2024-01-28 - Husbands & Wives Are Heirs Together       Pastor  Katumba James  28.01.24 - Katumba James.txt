going through by your grace Lord we call upon your name again this afternoon that Lord you may come and speak to us the things that you've ordained for us this afternoon press upon this meeting Lord grant to meet the needs of all your children may the glory and honor be back you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and ask this amen we turn to our Bibles First Peter chapter 3 reading verse 7 to verse 9 the Bible says likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being haers together of the grace of life that your prayers be not [Music] hindered finally be of one mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courtious not rendering evil for evil or ring for ring but cont wise blessing knowing that you are they are AR called that you should inherit a blessing amen and God blessing of his word you may be seated so I want to preach this afternoon husband and wife are hairs together praise the name of the Lord the husband and the wife are hairs together praise the name of Lord so when we read in verse S it says husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto a weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not Hind that praise the name of the Lord so you look at this scripture it says that the husband and the wife they hairs together hairs of the grace of life that means that God blesses you together praise the name of the Lord God blesses you together and you see when God is calling a man and the man is married even the wife partakes of that calling now when we go in the message possessing all things praise the name of our Lord he says and right here we could start I believe that when God calls the man to service if he is a married man he has a help meet he calls his wife with him because they two are one praise the name of our Lord so now when God called Abraham leave the land of and come to the land I show you Abraham didn't leave Sarah behind because Sarah was part of Abraham Sarah was a hair with Abraham so then when Abraham moved out he went with his wife praise the name of our Lord and see even when you are living or when you stay in a place you stay together you eat of the same food you share of the same Sorrows many times if one is sorrowful you can't be happy because it affects you and when you get children they are both your children so now as husband and wife you know they are hairs together anything that God comes to bless the family every body is blessed partakes of that same blessing so then he says still in that message possessing all things and so wherever we find later on that God possibly would have killed Sarah when she doubted the Angel's message 25 years later when they were sitting under the oak that day and when she left when the angel told her oh told Abraham that she was going to be a mother and sah left within herself how could I old 0 years old and her husband 100 years old her womb had been dried up for years her womb had been dried up for years and the body was was as good as de then how could she ever have pleasure with her husband again she laughed and the angel with the back turned to the tent why did sah and she denied it now that's telling God to his face that is wrong and that would have took her life but God could not take Sarah because she was a part of Abraham and she was in the convenant with him so she had to go with him so he could not take Abraham S without taking part of Abraham for these two are one praise the name of our Lord so Sarah had made a mistake but then because she was part of Abraham then God would not take Sarah they were joined they were hairs together they were become one and that's now the same thing we need to consider your husband or your wife that you are part of him she is part of you so then whatever things that you desire whatever thing that you desire for yourself you need to desire it also for the other praise the name of our Lord and that's how you can be happy in marriage if you want your husband to be good to you then are you good to your husband if you want your wife to be good to you then are you good to your wife you need to keep give consideration to one another because God has made you one praise the name of our Lord so you should be able to know that this thing will hurt my husband or this thing will hurt my wife and then you learn how to consider one another and the Bible says one another in other words desire more for your husband or for your wife and then you'll have peace at home and then you'll see these differences don't really just come up like that you are able to bear with one another praise the name of our Lord so then it is important that we move together as a family unit and you know sometimes the devil would always want bring things that separate you but there are more things that unite you than what separates you so then you don't look at the things that brings division the thing that put you off from the other but then you try as much as possible to be reconciled to the other and so the Bible says having compassion one for another in other words when you have compassion for the other you are not so much looking at their weaknesses you're not so much looking at their fail but you know you are able to stand in the Gap you are able to stand in their position and then you are considerate of each other and this is how you know you can run your marriage and then you'll see God has given you Grace from one year two years and the time keeps on going until you find that you can't be yourself you can't be alone you feel you are missing praise the name of our Lord you feel that you are missing a part of you praise the name of our Lord like this week last week on Tuesday we took our young daughter es to boarding school and now when we left her there I felt a part of me is not around until now in the night you were thinking how did she sleep she has never been away from her parents and then the whole day I was thinking I think when we get back home we need to call the met and find and talk to and find out how she is it's just something that becomes part of you that when they take it away you feel there is some kind of Gap and that should be the concern of the husband and the wife if you are not there with your wife you are concerned how is she and even sometimes they will ask you hey did you eat praise the name of the Lord have you had the meal you know you are concerned praise the name of our Lord you know you are concerned about another because you have become so much part of each other so the Bible says we should have compassion one for another love as Brethren praise the name of our Lord love as Brethren you know like the sometimes when this one happens especially among young women you know they just want to go to the bathroom together you know they they just feel like even clothes they keep on changing this one wears the others the other wears the other you know there is that kind of connection that you know they just want to move together what are you going to eat today they want also to eat the same where would you want to go they also want to be there there is that kind of feeling of being together in everything and then until some of them even when they are going to school you will take me to the school of this one you know there is a closeness that comes in and now that should be the bond that we have in our families as husband and the wife you know you are so much concerned you may have this thing you like but then you know your mind is what will my husband think about this what does my husband like what does my life my wife like what will interest my wife what will make her happy and then you work out towards that and then the Bible says a married man let us go to First Corinthians chap 7 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and then we read in verse can
