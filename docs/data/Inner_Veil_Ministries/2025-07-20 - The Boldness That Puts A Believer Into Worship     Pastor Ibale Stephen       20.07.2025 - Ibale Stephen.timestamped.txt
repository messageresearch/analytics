[23:06] So you are welcome.
[23:08] Want to appreciate those who came

[23:11] meeting.
[23:14] And I would just encourage you to always
[23:16] come for the services when the church is
[23:18] open.
[23:22] Then on Sunday we shall have only one
[23:24] service.
[23:27] But on Friday again
[23:31] there is a brother called Benjamin.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; He's the son of brother Salam from

[24:46] support for those services.
[24:50] And we just keep on praying for all
[24:52] these meetings.
[24:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So I want
[24:57] to invite the youth to come and sing as
[24:59] our pastor comes.
[25:01] Are you happy to have our pastor back?
[25:05] Amen. Amen. Okay. Maybe before they
[25:07] come, I'm sorry I' forgotten another
[25:09] crucial program
[25:11] which made me come and stand here. I
[25:14] believe brother was wondering what's
[25:16] happening to my request. Before
[25:24] they come, let us sing a song. Bring
[25:26] them in as brother comes with his three
[25:29] children.
[25:34] Brother, if you can come for
[25:39] bring them in.
[25:43] Bring them in.
[25:47] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[25:55] Bring them in.
[25:59] Bring them in.
[26:03] Bring the wondering ones to Jesus.
[26:10] Oh, bring them bring.
[26:14] Halleluah. Bring them in.
[26:19] Bring them in from the fields of sea.
[26:28] Bring them in.
[26:32] Bring them in.
[26:36] Bring thou wondering ones to Jesus.
[26:43] [Music]
[26:44] Brother does come with his children
[26:50] that they can be dedicated into the
[26:52] hands of the Lord
[26:55] and we want to appreciate you. Let us
[26:57] clap for him.
[27:02] The mother of the children has not been
[27:03] able to come.
[27:06] She had a aunt who was sick.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; So that's why she went to attend since
[27:12] Thursday.
[27:15] Now children were never baptized,
[27:19] but they brought the children into the
[27:21] hands to the Lord
[27:24] in Mark chapter 19.
[27:27] And then verse 13,
[27:30] the Bible says, "Then were there brought
[27:33] unto him little children that he should
[27:36] put his hands on them and pray. And the
[27:39] disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said,
[27:42] "Suffer little children and forbide them
[27:45] not to not forbide them not to come unto
[27:48] me, for of such is the kingdom of God."
[27:51] And he laid his hands on them and
[27:53] departed.
[28:11] [Music]
[28:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Lord
[28:25] blessed the children.
[28:28] He never baptized them.
[28:31] And then he tells us, "Unless we are
[28:35] converted like little children,
[28:42] we shall not enter into the kingdom of
[28:44] heaven
[28:46] in Mark 18
[28:49] and then verse one to verse 4.
[28:54] So he says, "At the same time came the
[28:57] disciples unto Jesus, saying, who is the
[28:59] greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
[29:13] [Music]
[29:15] And Jesus called a little child unto
[29:18] them, and set him in the midst of them,
[29:20] and saying, Verily, I say unto you,
[29:22] except you be converted and become as
[29:25] little children, you shall not enter
[29:28] into the kingdom of heaven.
[29:45] [Music]
[29:49] And whosoever shall receive one of such
[29:51] little children in my name receiveth me.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] And let us pray for them.
[30:14] Okay, let us pray for chaos.
[30:17] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[30:20] dedicate this little child into your
[30:22] hands.
[30:24] As the father has brought them into your
[30:26] presence,
[30:27] we pray that your blessings comes upon
[30:30] her life. Father,
[30:32] may you watch over in the name of Jesus
[30:34] Christ.
[30:36] It has told us that forbide not little
[30:40] children to come unto me.
[30:43] So we commit her life into your hands
[30:46] that Lord may watch over her all the
[30:48] days of her life.
[30:51] protect us from all evil plans of Satan,
[30:56] all negative influences,
[30:59] from all powers of darkness and all
[31:01] diseases.
[31:03] And may you give the grace to the father
[31:05] and the mother
[31:08] to raise this child in the fear of the
[31:10] Lord
[31:11] that they may be an a good example unto
[31:14] her father.
[31:16] May you also provide for all her
[31:18] physical and spiritual needs.
[31:22] that Lord you may help her father. She
[31:24] may always be influenced by the word of
[31:26] God
[31:29] that when she grows up heavenly father
[31:32] may she be your handmade lord
[31:35] now that lord she may serve in the
[31:38] kingdom of god.
[31:40] Bless our father and all things ordained
[31:42] in her life.
[31:45] May they come for the glory of your holy
[31:46] name
[31:48] in the name of Jesus.

[41:13] [Music]
[41:15] became
[41:17] my savior
[41:22] and no cost too.
[41:33] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. And all
[41:37] God's children,
[41:42] &gt;&gt; they dwell in him
[41:44] because every one of us
[41:47] contribute to that fullness
[41:52] here and the gene here
[41:55] and here
[41:58] all dwell in him and we make the
[42:01] fullness of the godhead.
[42:04] So I want to greet you in the precious
[42:06] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:09] Amen. It's a privilege beyond any
[42:11] possible measure
[42:15] for us to be called sons and daughters
[42:17] of God.
[42:21] Sometimes we take it lightly.
[42:26] that if you really came to think
[42:30] that God bypassing all the creation
[42:33] around you,
[42:37] passing all the nice boys in the area,
[42:40] nice girls
[42:44] and he on you and he says you are my son
[42:49] to me that's a very great thing.
[42:52] Amen. Amen. By grace are we fellow
[42:56] hairers with God's own son.
[43:01] In all eternal inheritance,
[43:06] we share the same life with his son.
[43:10] We share in the authority of the name.
[43:13] He has reserved for us a body.
[43:17] Amen. That's going to be exactly the
[43:20] same quality with this body.
[43:24] Because when he comes, we shall be like
[43:27] him. He has identified himself together
[43:31] with us.
[43:33] And Paul calls him the firstborn of many
[43:35] brethren.
[43:39] And John says, "As he is, so are we."
[43:45] Amen. Sometimes we don't look at that as
[43:49] strongly as we should.
[43:52] We want to know that we are a class
[43:54] above the ordinary
[44:00] and that we need to esteem one another.
[44:05] Amen. Paul said, "Let nothing be done
[44:10] through strife or vain glory,
[44:16] but in loneliness of mind,
[44:20] let each esteem other better than
[44:22] themselves."
[44:27] Amen. It's very important that we esteem
[44:30] one another.
[44:33] When you look at this brethren,
[44:36] Amen. Don't put him below yourself.
[44:40] You know, I like Jonathan
[44:43] in the Bible. The son of Saul,
[44:46] you know, he discovered
[44:48] the importance of esteeming one another
[44:50] above.
[44:55] The virtue of being a son to King Saul,
[45:00] Amen. he was going to be the next king.
[45:04] But when he saw the attributes in the
[45:06] life of David,
[45:10] he preferred David to become the next
[45:13] king.
[45:15] That is preferring one another above
[45:18] self.
[45:21] So we really thank God for each other.
[45:25] Amen. Amen. Let's just turn around and
[45:27] shake one another's hands. Welcome one
[45:30] another to the house of the Lord.
[45:33] Just learn to relax
[45:36] that the Lord may speak to you
[45:40] this morning. The purpose why we come to
[45:42] the house of the Lord
[45:44] is that we may have fellowship with him.
[45:48] And the fellowship we have,
[45:51] one must develop fellowship with God
[45:56] in order for him to have fellowship with
[45:58] the other brother.
[46:01] So, are you in fellowship with Christ?
[46:04] The last time we were here,
[46:06] we talked about going through the waters
[46:09] of purification.
[46:13] Amen. The waters of separation.
[46:16] And from the waters of separation,
[46:19] we come into fellowship with Christ.
[46:22] And if every one of us has gone through
[46:24] those waters,
[46:27] that's the only way they could come
[46:29] together.
[46:31] When before God, they were perfect. So
[46:35] we thank God for our pastor
[46:39] and it's important that we give him the
[46:42] right hand of fellowship.
[46:45] Amen. Amen. And I want to advise you
[46:49] with such a ministry
[46:52] Amen. You don't stay away when the
[46:53] church doors are open.
[46:57] Amen. I have a belief
[47:00] and I honestly believe it that brother
[47:03] James has the ability to take this
[47:07] church to another level high.
[47:11] But you need him.
[47:14] I mean he needs you.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. to pray for him, support him in
[47:20] every way possible
[47:23] and the only way you can encourage his
[47:25] ministry
[47:27] to practically be part of it.
[47:31] Amen. Amen. Never miss any services.
[47:34] Amen.
[47:36] Amen. So I want to welcome you this
[47:38] morning
[47:40] into the presence of the Lord. Let us
[47:43] stand up as we go into the scripture
[47:46] reading.
[47:48] Hebrews chapter 10
[47:50] and verse 19.
[47:53] We talked to the author
[47:57] before we get there to read it.
[48:00] Precious heavenly father,
[48:02] we want to give thanks to you for the
[48:05] opportunity you have given to us to come
[48:07] into the house of of correction.
[48:11] When you say house of correction,
[48:15] father we are here before you
[48:18] just as open
[48:20] can be
[48:22] that you may check on the inside.
[48:25] Encourage us where you have to Lord.
[48:29] Rebuke where you have to father.
[48:32] You are father and we are children.
[48:34] We don't come to you simply because we
[48:38] are perfect.
[48:40] We come to you heavenly father
[48:43] in imperfection
[48:45] that you may make us perfect.
[48:48] That's the only we can get into the
[48:50] presence when you yourself makes it
[48:53] possible. I pray heavenly father
[48:56] every need that your children have.
[49:00] I pray that in the preaching of the word
[49:03] you may reach
[49:05] every area
[49:07] that your children
[49:15] desires of their hearts
[49:18] in Jesus
[50:16] can be knocked down in the Holy of
[50:18] Holies.
[52:32] back.
[52:34] Our God is not happy when you step back.
[52:39] Amen. We are not of those who step back.
[52:43] We are of those that fight
[52:46] all the way to the end of this world.
[52:49] And at the end, sister Mary,
[52:53] &gt;&gt; we shall say we have fought a good
[52:54] fight.
[52:56] Amen. God is there with you when they
[53:00] are trying to to touch that cancer out
[53:02] of your life.
[53:07] Amen. You are fighting a good fight.
[53:10] If there is a very serious situation
[53:13] in your family and you say, "I will not
[53:17] draw back.
[53:19] fighting a good fight. Are you together
[53:22] with me? If the devil is trying to pin
[53:26] it on you,
[53:27] you say, "I'll fight on. I'm going to
[53:30] fight a good fight. I'm not going to be
[53:33] of those
[53:35] who fall back in the
[53:38] Amen." Revelation 13
[53:41] and verse 4, the scripture says, "And
[53:46] they worshiped the dragon which gave
[53:49] power unto the beast.
[53:55] And they watch the beast saying,
[53:58] "Who is like the beast?
[54:03] Who is able to make war with him?
[54:06] In the end time, the beast will kind of
[54:10] become so powerful."
[54:14] Amen. In different uh sectors of of
[54:18] life.
[54:20] Amen. It will be the power behind
[54:23] politics.
[54:25] It will be the power behind religion.
[54:29] It will be the power be behind the
[54:31] economy.
[54:36] And even in the end times, he'll be
[54:38] given power against the saints.
[54:43] So those who don't see by the word,
[54:47] they will say, who is able to make war
[54:49] against the beast?
[54:53] Amen. Amen. Because he has been given
[54:55] power. He has been allowed.
[54:59] In the end time, God allows us to be
[55:01] tested.
[55:04] And as we get into this test,
[55:08] it's only those that are in the Lamb's
[55:10] book of life
[55:12] that will have the boldiness
[55:15] to worship God.
[55:17] The rest of them, the scripture says if
[55:21] their names were not written on the
[55:23] lamb's book of life,
[55:27] then they are going to worship the
[55:29] beast.
[55:31] Amen. So God allows certain things.
[55:36] He allows disappointments.
[55:41] He allows complaints in the church.
[55:45] He allows misunderstanding.
[55:48] He allows bad forces
[55:52] and all that
[55:54] is supposed to drop those that were not
[55:57] written in the lamb's book of life.
[56:03] This morning say I thank God I'm part of
[56:05] the blam's book of life.
[56:08] There is no circumstance
[56:11] that can kick the elect out of of
[56:13] worship.
[56:17] The boldness.
[56:19] Amen. That the elect has to step into
[56:23] the presence of God for worship.
[56:27] In the good times, in the bad times,
[56:31] they are right in there. whether they
[56:33] have the worst goods
[56:36] or they don't have the worst goods
[56:39] inside their worshiping.
[56:41] Amen. Whether disappointed in my
[56:44] marriage,
[56:47] I'm not stopping my worship
[56:50] because the boldness
[56:52] because I'm not entering in there
[56:55] depending on my work.
[56:59] Amen. The Lord went ahead of me.
[57:03] and sprinkled the with the blood of
[57:04] Jesus.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And there was given unto him
[57:12] a mouth
[57:14] speaking great things and blasphemies.
[57:18] And Paul was given unto him to continue
[57:22] for two months.
[57:26] Now this happens here
[57:29] in the tribulation.
[57:31] But we understand
[57:33] that with the work of God, working of
[57:36] God,
[57:38] you know, there is no clearcut stop.
[57:44] Amen. That this age stopped here. This
[57:47] age begins to go forward.
[57:50] We understand
[57:52] that the ages overlap.
[57:56] Amen. Now being in the end time,
[58:00] the next thing we are looking for
[58:03] is the rapture of the church.
[58:06] And then comes in the tribulation.
[58:09] But all that the tribulation will be
[58:14] is already here in baby form.
[58:19] Are you together with me? All these
[58:22] things we see
[58:24] are here in baby form.
[58:27] And we need to be careful
[58:30] because these situations
[58:33] are going to become harder as we keep
[58:35] going forward.
[58:39] That's right. Amen. Amen. And he opened
[58:42] his mouth in blasphemy against God
[58:48] to blasphe his name and his tabernacle
[58:53] and them that dwell in heaven.
[58:56] And it was given unto him to make war
[58:59] with the saints
[59:03] and to overcome them.
[59:05] And power was given him
[59:09] in all kindreds
[59:11] and tongs
[59:13] and nations and all that dwell upon the
[59:16] earth
[59:18] shall worship him
[59:20] because he will not exhibit a lot of
[59:23] power.
[59:26] Amen. But there are those who are not
[59:29] looking at drama in the Pentecostal
[59:32] world.
[59:35] Amen. How fabulous they are becoming.
[59:39] The colorful worship they could
[59:40] exercise,
[59:43] the great music they do.
[59:46] They are those that will keep their
[59:48] eyes.
[59:50] I said they are going to keep their eye
[59:53] on the message of the hour because it's
[59:56] the guide
[59:58] that will walk by.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; But if they are not in the lamb's book
[1:00:04] of life,
[1:00:07] the scripture says, "Amen. All that
[1:00:10] dwell upon the earth
[1:00:13] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:00:16] written
[1:00:18] in the book of life of the lamb
[1:00:23] from the foundation of the world."
[1:00:27] The scripture says the book of life
[1:00:33] of the lamb.
[1:00:36] We shall break that up a little bit.
[1:00:39] So in the end time,
[1:00:41] the antichrist anointing pours out
[1:00:46] in a very great measure
[1:00:49] in every sect of life.
[1:00:52] So this fool's anointing
[1:00:55] powers out. Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; At the same time
[1:01:00] when the son of man
[1:01:03] Amen is being revealed
[1:01:07] and proceeding all the way through into
[1:01:10] the tribulation
[1:01:14] in a greater measure.
[1:01:18] Are you together with me? So and is
[1:01:22] given power against the saints.
[1:01:26] is given power over politics,
[1:01:30] is given power over trade,
[1:01:34] is given power over religion.
[1:01:38] All the leaders of the world,
[1:01:41] they perform a pilgrimage
[1:01:44] and they go into wrong
[1:01:47] when they get power.
[1:01:49] All of them go.
[1:01:51] Amen. So because of the exhibition of
[1:01:55] this authority
[1:01:58] and the anointing,
[1:02:00] many whose names were not written in the
[1:02:02] lamb's book of life,
[1:02:07] they will worship this beast
[1:02:10] that had the ability
[1:02:13] that zipped the anointing
[1:02:16] that he received from the dragon.
[1:02:20] And the dragon is the devil.
[1:02:23] He anoints this beast.
[1:02:26] Now this perverted worship
[1:02:30] will easily take on the people
[1:02:34] that the devil has already deceived
[1:02:39] into worship.
[1:02:41] Are you together with me? They are a
[1:02:44] people that the devil has already
[1:02:46] deceived
[1:02:49] into force worship
[1:02:51] like the worship of idols
[1:02:54] like the worship of the stars.
[1:02:58] Amen. I'm not talking about these stars
[1:03:00] here.
[1:03:02] I'm talking about the stars.
[1:03:07] The man who seem to shine.
[1:03:14] In the sports world,
[1:03:16] in the music world,
[1:03:19] in film industry,
[1:03:21] there are people there
[1:03:23] that are worshiped.
[1:03:25] In the time of brother Brham,
[1:03:28] there was the band called the Beatles.
[1:03:33] And they said that they were more famous
[1:03:36] than Jesus.
[1:03:39] They could go into places
[1:03:42] And when people would hear
[1:03:45] that the beles were coming,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; they would do a drive.
[1:03:52] And when they come into places,
[1:03:55] even the cripples would get out of their
[1:03:57] chairs
[1:04:00] and the blind
[1:04:02] would open their eyes to see the beles.
[1:04:07] That's a power from somewhere.
[1:04:13] They would worship the stars
[1:04:18] and some of them worship the self
[1:04:21] success
[1:04:26] who is like me who is like a king
[1:04:32] are you together with me they begin to
[1:04:35] worship the self
[1:04:40] I cannot cannot be preached to by so and
[1:04:42] so.
[1:04:44] I cannot go to church. They wash their
[1:04:47] success.
[1:04:49] They wash their money.
[1:04:52] They worship of great personality.
[1:04:56] And some of them they worship holy men.
[1:05:01] Isaiah had been trapped into it
[1:05:04] in the worship of a great man.
[1:05:08] was a great king.
[1:05:10] He prospered Israel
[1:05:14] and ruled for many years.
[1:05:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He was so god-fearing.
[1:05:21] And in the eyes of Isaiah, he trapped on
[1:05:26] your father brought him out of there. He
[1:05:29] preached the message influence.
[1:05:32] Who is your influence?
[1:05:34] The worship of men.
[1:05:37] Even in churches,
[1:05:39] they are faces that are worshiped.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; If brother so and so says this,
[1:05:47] that's all. I don't want another person
[1:05:50] to send me.
[1:05:55] So those kind of elements,
[1:05:59] you know, those kind of elements,
[1:06:03] those are going to be easier to
[1:06:10] for the enemy
[1:06:12] in the end time because Isaiah says
[1:06:16] in the year that King died,
[1:06:20] I saw also
[1:06:24] he had seen
[1:06:31] his gift.
[1:06:33] He didn't know he was a prophet in
[1:06:35] calling.
[1:06:37] He couldn't even see God.
[1:06:41] Amen. And so now is very easy for those
[1:06:46] kind of I mean spirits
[1:06:50] to be taken over
[1:06:53] in the end
[1:06:55] because we must be in church
[1:06:59] because we have seen the law
[1:07:02] not because we are seeking to worship a
[1:07:04] holy man.
[1:07:07] But we have seen the Lord.
[1:07:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That should be
[1:07:12] your testimony.
[1:07:14] We have seen the Lord.
[1:07:17] While God can only receive direct
[1:07:19] worship. Remember,
[1:07:24] Satan can accept worship.
[1:07:28] In any form.
[1:07:30] He can trap you in any form.
[1:07:34] In the worship of your money,
[1:07:37] in the worship of your whatever it is,
[1:07:41] it means more to you
[1:07:43] than God. That is the worship. So
[1:07:47] worship means adoration
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:53] or devotion to something
[1:07:58] that unconsciously
[1:08:02] you regard it more than God
[1:08:11] even in your subconscious.
[1:08:15] So
[1:08:21] sometimes you don't even know what you
[1:08:23] are doing.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; But that's why you need a gift
[1:08:27] to come and comb the word
[1:08:30] and show you the position where you
[1:08:32] stand.
[1:08:35] And when you see the position where you
[1:08:37] stand
[1:08:39] is the moment you have to say, "Lord,
[1:08:42] give me grace.
[1:08:44] I need to come into a perfect worship.
[1:08:49] Amen. So in the end time the worship
[1:08:53] will be so specific.
[1:08:58] This is where we are headed to. You
[1:09:01] either worship God
[1:09:04] or you worship the beast
[1:09:07] because we are in the time where the
[1:09:10] word is picking out the elect.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; The elect is being picked out by the
[1:09:17] word
[1:09:19] and any other that will not be found in
[1:09:23] the L's book of life.
[1:09:27] We certainly have to wash the beast.
[1:09:30] This is the hour to identify ourselves
[1:09:34] to tell the devil who you are. I am the
[1:09:37] son of God.
[1:09:39] I come from God.
[1:09:41] There's no devil that can twist my mind.
[1:09:46] Amen. Brother Brham says demons are
[1:09:50] working on every hand
[1:09:53] and God's spirit
[1:09:55] moving right on the other hand
[1:09:59] to counteract every time.
[1:10:04] Amen. Demon is at work every time.
[1:10:08] And you know brother Brham says
[1:10:11] that the devil cannot work without a
[1:10:14] body.
[1:10:16] He has to be embodied
[1:10:19] where the devil came.
[1:10:21] I don't know in a spirit form
[1:10:26] in this assembly of uh Job
[1:10:30] in Job's church.
[1:10:33] He did not materialize much.
[1:10:40] He was not able to catch Job
[1:10:43] until God allowed
[1:10:48] Are you together with me? But when the
[1:10:50] devil puts on a body
[1:10:53] and becomes Judas
[1:10:55] and comes into church with the rest of
[1:10:57] the saints,
[1:10:59] he can achieve much.
[1:11:04] After you have fed on the word,
[1:11:07] Judas will say, "Look at this.
[1:11:10] This oil we could have sold
[1:11:14] and we could help the poor.
[1:11:16] How many voices are operating on the
[1:11:19] alternative all the time
[1:11:24] when the ministry has preached?
[1:11:27] Then comes this alternative voice.
[1:11:31] And it's always easier to see the
[1:11:33] negative
[1:11:36] than to see the positive.
[1:11:39] I thank God there is that who were
[1:11:42] elected from before the foundation of
[1:11:44] the world.
[1:11:47] They always have the positive look at
[1:11:49] the feast.
[1:11:52] Amen. Because we are heading out now
[1:11:57] in the time of the great showdown.
[1:12:00] Brother Brham says coming pretty soon
[1:12:08] between God and the devil.
[1:12:12] Amen. That countdown.
[1:12:17] Amen. Between God
[1:12:20] and the devil.
[1:12:24] Somebody say amen somewhere.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:12:30] And this beast
[1:12:32] that we are talking about
[1:12:35] will be a man
[1:12:37] at the top of the religious system in
[1:12:40] the end time.
[1:12:44] He will drive the general belief system
[1:12:50] in the end time.
[1:12:52] He also control politics
[1:12:56] and the economy.
[1:12:58] Now in revelation chapter 13
[1:13:02] and verse 18
[1:13:04] he says here is wisdom
[1:13:09] because the scriptures say those who are
[1:13:12] not written
[1:13:14] in the lamp's book
[1:13:18] of life
[1:13:22] says that they will worship the beast
[1:13:27] and Now worship
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; is adoration.
[1:13:33] Worship
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; is devotion.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:42] Now we are here
[1:13:45] and now there comes some form of
[1:13:48] adoration.
[1:13:52] He says here is wisdom.
[1:13:55] Let him that has understanding
[1:13:59] count the number of the beast.
[1:14:03] For it's the number
[1:14:05] of a man.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; So the beast is a man who raises himself
[1:14:12] above God.
[1:14:15] And when
[1:14:17] raised himself above God
[1:14:20] and he says, "Look at my mighty
[1:14:23] kingdom."
[1:14:26] The spirit
[1:14:28] of an animal
[1:14:30] entered into Nebuchadnezzar
[1:14:33] and he went and lived with the beast in
[1:14:36] the wild.
[1:14:39] and he began to eat grass
[1:14:42] like the beast of the wild.
[1:14:45] Are you together with me? But he was a
[1:14:47] man and he was king of Babylon.
[1:14:52] So in the end time in this Babylon
[1:14:55] system where we are
[1:14:58] there rises up a beast
[1:15:02] with the same kind of anointing
[1:15:05] because it has devolved itself above
[1:15:08] God.
[1:15:11] is like the king of Tyrus
[1:15:15] in Ezekiel chapter 28
[1:15:18] who considered himself to be God.
[1:15:22] So when we are talking about this beast
[1:15:26] we are talking about a man
[1:15:29] are you together with me in revelation
[1:15:32] chapter 17
[1:15:35] the Bible says that beast
[1:15:38] is riding a woman
[1:15:42] is riding a woman.
[1:15:45] Amen. And the woman is a church system.
[1:15:51] So now even in the book of Revelation,
[1:15:55] he controls the economy.
[1:15:58] Amen. To the extent the time will come
[1:16:03] if you don't have a mark
[1:16:06] in your forehead
[1:16:08] which means the doctrine which is
[1:16:10] acceptable to him
[1:16:13] or the mark in the hand
[1:16:16] meaning that you give him your hand of
[1:16:18] fellowship
[1:16:21] you will not be able to buy
[1:16:24] or to sell.
[1:16:28] We are talking about the time where we
[1:16:30] are
[1:16:32] and the scripture says all the kings of
[1:16:35] the earth
[1:16:37] have made spiritual fornication with her
[1:16:42] meaning that they've got a great
[1:16:44] adoration
[1:16:48] towards this church system
[1:16:51] that the beast rights is of I mean that
[1:16:54] rights by the authority of the beast
[1:16:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; But then in the face of all this,
[1:17:05] there is another worship
[1:17:08] where the elect on the other hand
[1:17:11] worships God in appreciation of his
[1:17:15] redemption.
[1:17:18] Are you together with me? When John
[1:17:21] realized
[1:17:23] that his name was in the book, are you
[1:17:26] together with me? The one who has his
[1:17:28] name in the book will worship God.
[1:17:32] We not miss a church service.
[1:17:36] We always be in his Bible.
[1:17:38] We always feed on the message.
[1:17:41] So we don't come to church
[1:17:44] to meet friends.
[1:17:48] This is not a you know a social society.
[1:17:55] Are you together with me? We come here
[1:17:58] because we realize that our names are
[1:18:03] written in the Lamb's book.
[1:18:07] Whoever has gone through the waters of
[1:18:09] separation
[1:18:11] and is in fellowship with God
[1:18:14] will be able to look for his brother
[1:18:18] so that he can have fellowship with him.
[1:18:21] Why do we do that? Because all of us
[1:18:25] come from God. You realize you are
[1:18:28] missing your brother.
[1:18:31] Hallelujah. And when we come down here
[1:18:35] because we have fellowship with God, we
[1:18:38] can have fellowship with one another.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; We don't come here because the pastor
[1:18:48] preaches us happy.
[1:18:52] We come here because we already
[1:18:55] recognize the lordship of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We realize how
[1:19:03] great
[1:19:05] the hope has been to our lives.
[1:19:08] We realize where grace picked us from.
[1:19:13] We realize that even if you are not what
[1:19:16] you want to be,
[1:19:19] you are not what you used to be. So
[1:19:22] therefore, you come into his presence.
[1:19:25] Keep worshiping by the washing waters of
[1:19:28] the world.
[1:19:30] Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Where would I be without Calvary?
[1:19:35] The answer is very simple.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would be a drunker
[1:19:42] lying in the gutters in
[1:19:46] what I would be. I would be a prostitute
[1:19:51] out there in the prostitute houses
[1:19:55] in my body.
[1:19:58] Sometimes I would be a witch.
[1:20:01] Sometimes I would be a senseless bugler
[1:20:09] breaking in houses of hardworking
[1:20:11] people.
[1:20:13] I would be a hopeless husband,
[1:20:18] taking away peace from my family.
[1:20:22] But the grace of God has made me what I
[1:20:25] am. That's what I come to church for.
[1:20:30] Is that amen for you? You are not here
[1:20:33] to meet your friends.
[1:20:36] Amen. I would be a condemned sinner
[1:20:41] and a sure candidate for the lake of
[1:20:44] fire.
[1:20:47] Amen. that the elect
[1:20:50] will worship the lamb
[1:20:53] in this same time because he has a
[1:20:56] revelation
[1:20:57] of who he is. He knows who he came to
[1:21:01] believe.
[1:21:03] Oh hallelujah.
[1:21:05] Praise God. Because the book of
[1:21:07] redemption
[1:21:09] is revealed and the elected enter
[1:21:15] by the opening of the seventh seal.
[1:21:19] So when the book of redemption
[1:21:22] broke open to John
[1:21:25] and he saw his name,
[1:21:27] oh praise the Lord, he lifted up his
[1:21:30] hands in what
[1:21:33] worship.
[1:21:34] Have you seen your name?
[1:21:37] Can you be able to say amen?
[1:21:40] Because your name is in the lamb's book
[1:21:42] of life.
[1:21:45] Amen. As the ministers preach the word,
[1:21:49] you keep saying that's me.
[1:21:52] You keep saying that's me. Because the
[1:21:54] minister
[1:21:56] is holding a mirror for you
[1:21:59] so that you can see who you are. that
[1:22:02] you are washed in the blood, that you
[1:22:05] are a son of God, that you predestinated
[1:22:09] that the enemy, Satan cannot and should
[1:22:12] not
[1:22:14] block you from going into the holy of
[1:22:17] holies to lift up your hearts,
[1:22:21] those holy saraphim
[1:22:23] to worship God, holy, holy, holy Lord
[1:22:28] God Almighty.
[1:22:31] The true purpose in life
[1:22:34] comes with God
[1:22:36] revealing his word to you.
[1:22:40] Worship now.
[1:22:43] Amen. Is to those in the end time
[1:22:48] who have seen their names in the lamb's
[1:22:51] book of life.
[1:22:54] That's what it is.
[1:22:56] It will be a clear cut in the end time.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; So we go back into the book of Genesis.
[1:23:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:13] What goes back way back
[1:23:17] in the book of Genesis?
[1:23:20] It was genuine.
[1:23:28] Because there were two people,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; whose names were in the in the Lamb's
[1:23:36] book of life.
[1:23:39] And God was the first builder
[1:23:44] of the house of God.
[1:23:47] In the evening time, he could come to
[1:23:50] the tabernacle.
[1:23:52] And then Adam and Eve and Eve
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; would be there to worship God.
[1:24:00] See this what I'm saying that if we have
[1:24:03] been redeemed
[1:24:05] and taken back to the moment of Adam
[1:24:09] before the fall
[1:24:12] when the word begins to unfold it so
[1:24:16] you don't even walk out to go out of
[1:24:17] church.
[1:24:19] You are there to wait for the next
[1:24:21] statement
[1:24:23] the Holy Ghost is going to bring forth.
[1:24:27] Amen. God knows
[1:24:31] those that are his
[1:24:33] and when they got their knees,
[1:24:37] he hears them is because
[1:24:40] they were created to worship.
[1:24:45] That's the boldness.
[1:24:48] That's what we were created for.
[1:24:52] But sin separated us from it.
[1:24:56] But when the blood came
[1:24:59] and brided the gap,
[1:25:02] it has the boldness
[1:25:05] which takes you to worship.
[1:25:08] Not your righteousness now,
[1:25:11] but it's the blood of Jesus.
[1:25:15] It takes you to the holy of holies.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; The cherubims
[1:25:21] with the flaming
[1:25:24] is no longer there.
[1:25:27] But what God made
[1:25:30] is come to me.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] Praise the Lord. Those men, the creation
[1:25:41] of God,
[1:25:43] and character
[1:25:45] was designed to worship God.
[1:25:49] And when they move into worship,
[1:25:53] they fit
[1:25:55] in the description of what a worshshiper
[1:25:57] is.
[1:26:01] When Abdel entered into there,
[1:26:04] fitted into the description
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:08] what a worshiper is
[1:26:12] because his name
[1:26:14] amen was in the lamb's book of life
[1:26:19] those men who worship God
[1:26:23] who got the three sets of saraphim
[1:26:26] wings.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Today
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I want to bring you to what brother
[1:26:34] Brham told us.
[1:26:37] He described to us the nature of the
[1:26:41] saraphim
[1:26:43] relating it back to the washer.
[1:26:47] Amen. These saraphim they had their
[1:26:50] wings
[1:26:53] and then another set covered their feet
[1:26:57] and another set they fly.
[1:27:02] Are you together with me? They cover
[1:27:05] their faces
[1:27:07] in reference
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; to the presence.
[1:27:12] Are you together with me? So you come
[1:27:14] down here and then you become reverent
[1:27:17] to the presence of God
[1:27:21] in the presence of the in the ministry
[1:27:24] of brother Brana
[1:27:27] when he was always going into the prayer
[1:27:29] life
[1:27:31] he would say I'm waiting on him
[1:27:35] and when the angel of the Lord came down
[1:27:39] he would say he's here now
[1:27:42] and then he says Be real reverent now.
[1:27:46] Be reverent now. Are you together with
[1:27:49] me? And he says now when you jump
[1:27:51] scream, you jump out of it. Be reverent
[1:27:53] now.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Be like those
[1:27:58] angels.
[1:28:00] Be like the saraphims.
[1:28:03] They don't come to church to chew on
[1:28:06] chewing gum.
[1:28:09] They don't come to church looking at the
[1:28:12] hour.
[1:28:14] They come to church and they are still
[1:28:18] until the preacher is done
[1:28:22] because the work of the preacher doesn't
[1:28:24] come. It is the washing waters of the
[1:28:27] world.
[1:28:29] The preacher is not washing himself.
[1:28:32] The preacher when he preaches
[1:28:35] pouring the washing water.
[1:28:38] Oh, praise God.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature is that another set
[1:28:44] covered their feet in humility.
[1:28:51] They get in the spirit of service.
[1:28:55] Amen. They don't come to church
[1:28:58] to listen to the accent.
[1:29:02] They come to church
[1:29:04] because they are, you know, that's where
[1:29:07] they are supposed to be.
[1:29:11] Creation created them that way
[1:29:15] and fitted them with those saraphim
[1:29:17] wings
[1:29:20] to recognize that presence
[1:29:23] and be in that presence.
[1:29:26] They know how to bring God down.
[1:29:29] They don't come to watch a preacher.
[1:29:32] They come to feed on the word.
[1:29:36] And when the word gets home,
[1:29:39] they know how to say amen.
[1:29:42] Amen. They don't come down
[1:29:45] to participate in a daily service.
[1:29:48] No sir. He come down here to have a
[1:29:52] service like the one they had in the
[1:29:55] times of Israel
[1:29:58] where a man stood up
[1:30:00] behind a wooden pulpit
[1:30:04] open the word
[1:30:07] says out of the world
[1:30:09] others were lifting up their
[1:30:12] saying amen.
[1:30:14] When you say amen you are not doing
[1:30:17] anything wrong. You are just being in
[1:30:19] the word.
[1:30:23] Praise the Lord. You see, they sit still
[1:30:29] until they see the goodness of the Lord.
[1:30:33] Amen. And then there was another set.
[1:30:38] This is the set to fly with.
[1:30:42] They are active.
[1:30:45] They are not dominant.
[1:30:48] They don't come to church
[1:30:51] to become wall flowers.
[1:30:54] When they come to church because they
[1:30:57] come from God,
[1:30:59] they always sensitive about their
[1:31:01] calling in the body.
[1:31:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If they are to
[1:31:07] sing,
[1:31:08] they sing the best way possible.
[1:31:11] If they are preachers, they preach the
[1:31:14] best way possible.
[1:31:16] They are prayer warriors. They pray the
[1:31:19] best way possible.
[1:31:21] Their boldiness has been provided.
[1:31:24] You don't need to stay away
[1:31:27] because the blood of Jesus has atoned
[1:31:30] for the condition.
[1:31:32] Amen. Everybody knows his position in
[1:31:35] Christ
[1:31:38] and happily serves in it.
[1:31:41] Amen. We are supposed to be flying
[1:31:44] fields.
[1:31:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. So the elect
[1:31:51] cannot afford
[1:31:53] according to this description
[1:31:56] to be arrogant
[1:32:00] and live in the presence of the Lord at
[1:32:02] the same time.
[1:32:08] Arrogant. No, it is not possible.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; So he knows that he's he is because of
[1:32:17] the grace of God.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. He is
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; because of the grace of Cal.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; So when Cain tried his worship,
[1:32:35] it could not be received.
[1:32:38] Why?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; He was not created with those
[1:32:42] attributes.
[1:32:46] He didn't come from God.
[1:32:48] He was not created fitted to worship.
[1:32:54] Are you together with me? He evidently
[1:32:57] lacked reverence
[1:33:03] and he didn't also have humility.
[1:33:07] He didn't have the wings.
[1:33:11] God does not deal with arrogant spirit.
[1:33:18] There are some people
[1:33:20] that will never be under anybody
[1:33:25] unless they are the one leading.
[1:33:30] I thank God I have a pastor.
[1:33:37] Are you together with me? There are some
[1:33:40] arrogant spirits
[1:33:44] that they cannot just afford
[1:33:47] to be under anybody
[1:33:51] unless they're the ones leading.
[1:33:56] God have mercy.
[1:34:02] God does you know the kingdom of God
[1:34:09] is about the nature and attribute of the
[1:34:13] saraphims.
[1:34:17] Look at them. They don't have any sin in
[1:34:21] them
[1:34:23] but look at the reverence
[1:34:27] with which they come to God.
[1:34:31] How about me,
[1:34:33] a man washed by the blood of Jes?
[1:34:39] How much more humble should I be?
[1:34:44] Kane's name's
[1:34:47] name was not found in the lamb's book of
[1:34:55] Revelation 13.
[1:34:58] Because Cain was not found
[1:35:02] Even in Genesis,
[1:35:04] his worship
[1:35:06] could not be received.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Do you see now? Because Genesis
[1:35:13] is the seed book
[1:35:17] and Revelation
[1:35:19] is the harvest book.
[1:35:23] The name that was not in the lamb's book
[1:35:27] in Genesis.
[1:35:31] could not worship
[1:35:34] and in the end time that name again will
[1:35:38] not be able to worship. When you look at
[1:35:41] the character and the nature of the of
[1:35:43] the uh of the saraphim,
[1:35:48] you begin to watch yourself
[1:35:52] and say where do I lack in this
[1:35:56] and say God have mercy upon me.
[1:36:00] The gin seed in the elect in the n the
[1:36:04] non-elect. I begin from that angle.
[1:36:11] The gene of life in the non seed
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:18] speaks the language of Cain.
[1:36:22] Because the language of Ken says,
[1:36:26] "From thy press,
[1:36:29] from thy face shall I be hid."
[1:36:37] Are you together with me? From thy face
[1:36:42] shall I be he.
[1:36:44] I don't want to go to church.
[1:36:48] That's the language of Cain. After he
[1:36:51] was found in sea,
[1:36:54] instead of humbling,
[1:36:57] he walked farther away in the east.
[1:37:01] And he said, "From thy face
[1:37:05] shall I be hid?
[1:37:08] Will you be hid from the face of the
[1:37:10] Lord?
[1:37:13] Will you always have the boldiness
[1:37:16] to come into the house of the Lord?
[1:37:19] Have fellowship with your brothers.
[1:37:22] These are the people you are going to
[1:37:24] share with.
[1:37:28] Amen. Amen. Are you together with me?
[1:37:31] But Kane says, "I will not be a church
[1:37:33] boy no more.
[1:37:36] They desert the presence after a
[1:37:38] mistake."
[1:37:42] And he says, "I shall be a fugitive and
[1:37:44] a vagabot."
[1:37:50] Are you together with me? He's only
[1:37:52] swearing negative things.
[1:37:56] If I hurt,
[1:37:58] that's what I am.
[1:38:01] If I don't forgive,
[1:38:03] that's who I am. You know when I read
[1:38:06] the scripture the other day,
[1:38:09] I found out that Cain
[1:38:12] after going out to sacrifice with his
[1:38:15] brother,
[1:38:18] it was after that God says no your uh
[1:38:22] sacrifice has been rejected.
[1:38:29] Amen. And then he says if you only
[1:38:33] consulted your prayer
[1:38:37] You would also be accepted.
[1:38:40] But there are some people that even
[1:38:43] don't like to consumpt.
[1:38:48] But yet iron sharpens iron.
[1:38:55] Amen.
[1:38:57] When you come to church, you are
[1:38:59] consulting your breath
[1:39:02] because he's talking to you
[1:39:05] is answering the questions of your heart
[1:39:09] in the preaching of the word.
[1:39:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:14] You must remember
[1:39:17] is not immediately at the altar
[1:39:22] that Kane killed his brother.
[1:39:26] No, it is afterwards.
[1:39:29] I don't know after how long
[1:39:32] time is not put there. It could be after
[1:39:35] 5 years,
[1:39:37] maybe after 10 years. Then he told his
[1:39:40] brother, "Let us go back to the garden.
[1:39:44] Poor sheep
[1:39:48] following Cain
[1:39:50] who says, "From thy face shall I be
[1:39:52] healed."
[1:39:55] and you see some poor sheep
[1:39:58] in a local church
[1:40:01] following some gods.
[1:40:07] There's no forgiveness.
[1:40:10] There's no, you know, tying that, you
[1:40:14] know, thing upon the heart.
[1:40:18] I will never forgive you.
[1:40:22] your your sacrifice
[1:40:26] accepted mine rejected
[1:40:29] and God says me to consult you 10 years
[1:40:34] later
[1:40:35] let's go to the garden
[1:40:42] are you together with me just like
[1:40:46] who was of that wicked one
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; and slew his breath even in the end time
[1:40:54] they don't try worship again.
[1:41:00] That's why the scripture says that all
[1:41:03] that dwell upon the earth
[1:41:06] shall worship the beast
[1:41:08] whose names are not written in the lamb
[1:41:11] of life
[1:41:15] the foundation of the world.
[1:41:18] Are you together with me? So when you
[1:41:20] come here
[1:41:21] You are giving your testimony.
[1:41:24] My name is in the lamb's book of life.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; The lamb
[1:41:33] has got the ways of his life written in
[1:41:35] a book.
[1:41:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if you
[1:41:44] live by the way of the lamb's book of
[1:41:46] life,
[1:41:49] then you'll be able to worship God
[1:41:52] in the end time. A true believer should
[1:41:56] not close light and fire
[1:42:00] with that kind of class in the end time.
[1:42:05] That's why the scripture says, "Come out
[1:42:08] of my people.
[1:42:11] Why? Let's go to the garden.
[1:42:15] Let's go to the garden.
[1:42:17] And now when you get to the garden, he's
[1:42:20] trying to pluck out every seed
[1:42:26] that has been planted into that innocent
[1:42:28] heart.
[1:42:31] God have mercy.
[1:42:34] Listen now.
[1:42:36] Let's deal a little bit with the Lamb's
[1:42:38] Book of Life.
[1:42:40] The lamb's book.
[1:42:43] It doesn't say book that belongs to the
[1:42:47] lamb,
[1:42:51] but the lamb's book
[1:42:56] of life.
[1:42:58] Meaning that the ways of life of the
[1:43:00] lamb
[1:43:04] has been written here.
[1:43:06] And those who walk by the ways of this
[1:43:09] book
[1:43:13] shows that they came from the same
[1:43:16] source with the lamb.
[1:43:20] They were created
[1:43:22] and designed
[1:43:24] with a worshshiper's nature.
[1:43:28] Are you together with me? Amen. Amen. So
[1:43:31] now this the message Hebrews chapter 5
[1:43:35] and 6.
[1:43:37] Brother Brham says, "Oh, I know there is
[1:43:40] many rise up
[1:43:43] and go out and say, "Oh, I don't need to
[1:43:46] go to church anymore.
[1:43:49] Praise God. The Holy Ghost has come.
[1:43:53] He's the teacher." When you get that
[1:43:56] idea,
[1:43:58] you are just wrong. For why did the Holy
[1:44:01] Ghost set teachers in the church?
[1:44:05] He's if he was going to be the teacher,
[1:44:11] they are first apostles,
[1:44:13] prophets, teachers, evangelists, and
[1:44:17] pastors. The Holy Spirit, set teachers
[1:44:20] in the church.
[1:44:22] So he could teach through the teachers.
[1:44:26] Hallelujah.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said teach us in the
[1:44:29] church
[1:44:30] that he could teach
[1:44:33] by the teacher.
[1:44:36] That's why we come to church. We have
[1:44:39] the boldness.
[1:44:41] The boldness tells me that. But if you
[1:44:44] run away,
[1:44:46] if your life is wanting,
[1:44:52] amen, then that means you didn't come
[1:44:55] from God.
[1:44:58] But if your life is wanting,
[1:45:01] the Bible says you run.
[1:45:10] That's when you go to the Holy of
[1:45:11] Holies.
[1:45:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The blood went
[1:45:16] before you.
[1:45:19] So you need the boldness
[1:45:22] because the blood went before you. You
[1:45:25] are safe
[1:45:29] in whatsoever condition to go to the
[1:45:32] house of the Lord. Whether you are
[1:45:34] righteous or you in a state that's not
[1:45:38] perfect,
[1:45:40] this is where you can find help.
[1:45:46] Amen. The true seed
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; will lab to identify with the other
[1:45:52] seeds in service.
[1:45:58] Now listen, the only time Adam did not
[1:46:02] get into the divine presence
[1:46:06] was when sin had set him
[1:46:10] when Jesus,
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; the anointing,
[1:46:14] the Holy Ghost, the Lord came into the
[1:46:18] tabernacle.
[1:46:19] He said, "Adam, where are you?"
[1:46:22] And he says, "I have hidden."
[1:46:25] And then he did say, "Are you sick?"
[1:46:28] He said, "No. Have you eaten of the
[1:46:31] tree?" He knows the only thing that
[1:46:34] keeps a man away from church
[1:46:38] is the condition of his soul.
[1:46:43] When people are sick,
[1:46:45] sometimes they come and we pray for
[1:46:47] them.
[1:46:49] But the reason why people stay away
[1:46:52] is because their souls are sick.
[1:46:57] They've eaten of the fruit.
[1:47:00] God have mercy.
[1:47:02] Because at that time, God put a cherubim
[1:47:07] with a flying I mean with a shining
[1:47:09] sword.
[1:47:11] But today the cherubim
[1:47:15] has been taken away.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus
[1:47:19] calls you to the oath
[1:47:22] in any condition you are in.
[1:47:25] Come to the church.
[1:47:28] It's the house of correction.
[1:47:30] It's where you find the washing waters.
[1:47:33] This is where you belong.
[1:47:37] Hallelujah.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; The lamb has his book of life and your
[1:47:44] name is in that book. And brother Brana
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; he says that that name
[1:47:52] is not nephew
[1:47:57] or
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; no he says that name
[1:48:04] can only identify by you
[1:48:10] when you read the word
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; and then you realize
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; the word is talking to you
[1:48:18] when the word recommends a way of life
[1:48:23] which is the way of the lamb
[1:48:26] and then you feel like that's what you
[1:48:28] desire
[1:48:30] then that's your name
[1:48:32] in the book
[1:48:37] that's why today you are identified with
[1:48:40] worship
[1:48:43] you come to church
[1:48:45] because your name requires that
[1:48:50] in that book we find the names of the
[1:48:54] elect.
[1:48:57] And I told you the name
[1:49:01] signifies character.
[1:49:06] The name
[1:49:08] is the character
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; of those
[1:49:13] who are identified
[1:49:16] with the life of the lamb written in the
[1:49:21] book.
[1:49:26] That's simple.
[1:49:28] Tell your brother, "My name is in the
[1:49:31] lamb's book of
[1:49:34] Yes, sir. It's there. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:38] And as you walk,
[1:49:40] you come to church, that button on the
[1:49:43] inside
[1:49:45] begins to get brighter
[1:49:48] and brighter
[1:49:49] and brighter.
[1:49:51] Are you together with me? Every time you
[1:49:55] listen to the exaltations,
[1:49:58] that battle becomes brighter.
[1:50:02] Every time you come to church,
[1:50:05] that button becomes brighter.
[1:50:08] You hear what I'm saying?
[1:50:10] That's your boldiness
[1:50:12] to enter into the holiest
[1:50:15] by the blood of Jesus.
[1:50:18] Amen.
[1:50:20] The lamb's life is the charact of
[1:50:22] worship
[1:50:24] because worship is the way of life for
[1:50:27] the elect.
[1:50:29] When we get out of here, when the nature
[1:50:33] of sin has been washed away, the
[1:50:35] original purpose
[1:50:38] will be restored.
[1:50:40] We are not going to be engineers up
[1:50:42] there. We are going to be washers.
[1:50:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we had
[1:50:48] rather begin to practice now
[1:50:52] our God
[1:50:56] because that's what we are.
[1:50:59] Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; God has the names of those
[1:51:03] who shares the same life with the lamb.
[1:51:07] Amen. These are eternal because they
[1:51:10] originated from the same source with the
[1:51:13] lamb.
[1:51:17] They share of that life.
[1:51:20] They think like the lamb.
[1:51:23] They speak like the lamb. They act like
[1:51:26] the lamb.
[1:51:28] because they live by the life of the
[1:51:29] lamb.
[1:51:33] Are you together with me? They are dead
[1:51:35] to theirselves
[1:51:38] and alive
[1:51:40] because the lamb's life
[1:51:44] lives in that spot
[1:51:46] where their lives used to live.
[1:51:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now it takes
[1:51:52] away that wrong life.
[1:51:55] Then the life of the lamb
[1:51:58] comes at the center.
[1:52:01] When the lamb keeps looking from up
[1:52:03] yonder,
[1:52:06] when the seraraphims look from up yonder
[1:52:10] and they look like this, they say look
[1:52:14] holy, holy, holy to the Lord.
[1:52:19] The whole earth is filled with his
[1:52:22] glory.
[1:52:25] They see you.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul says, "Christ liveth in
[1:52:32] me and the life which I now live in the
[1:52:36] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[1:52:39] God
[1:52:42] and gave himself for me."
[1:52:45] Amen. So I am as eternal
[1:52:50] as the lamb is eternal.
[1:52:53] Did you hear that? If you are a son of
[1:52:56] God,
[1:52:59] amen, you are as eternal
[1:53:02] as the son of God is eternal
[1:53:06] because you came from the same source.
[1:53:10] He broke off of himself
[1:53:13] his own spirit
[1:53:16] to make you.
[1:53:19] Let's make man
[1:53:21] in our image and in our form.
[1:53:24] That's your nature.
[1:53:26] That's why you've got the ability to go
[1:53:30] before God and worship.
[1:53:34] That's why when sin gets into your life,
[1:53:39] you know where to run back to
[1:53:42] because you cannot run towards the devil
[1:53:46] because you know what happens.
[1:53:49] It is fire out there.
[1:53:51] They will ask David
[1:53:54] now you have done something wrong. Would
[1:53:57] you want to fall in the hands of your
[1:53:58] enemy?
[1:54:00] And he says, "No, no, no, no, no. I
[1:54:04] would rather fall in the hands of God."
[1:54:07] How many of you would rather fall in the
[1:54:10] hands of God?
[1:54:12] I would rather fall in the hands of God.
[1:54:15] That's what my desire is.
[1:54:19] Anything wrong,
[1:54:21] I run back to the Holy of Holies. The
[1:54:25] door is open for me by the blood of the
[1:54:28] lamb.
[1:54:30] I came from the same spirit
[1:54:33] to live the life of the lamb here on
[1:54:35] earth.
[1:54:38] You are eternal beings
[1:54:40] in a natural body.
[1:54:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. You
[1:54:48] are eternal beings
[1:54:50] in a natural body.
[1:54:53] So this natural body is putting up a
[1:54:57] fight against you
[1:55:00] on the Israel
[1:55:02] and say I will fight a good fight.
[1:55:09] Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; My daughter always keeps asking me my
[1:55:14] granddaughter.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:19] She says, "Dather,
[1:55:22] if the stranger comes to touch me,
[1:55:28] what would you do?" I say, "I would
[1:55:30] punch him.
[1:55:33] You beat him." And what would he say? I
[1:55:37] say he would cry out.
[1:55:40] And then he says, "Okay, will God hear?"
[1:55:44] I says, "Yes, you have ears and you are
[1:55:46] protected.
[1:55:50] Are you together with me? Yeah. We are
[1:55:52] little children.
[1:55:54] God cannot afford to lose us.
[1:55:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; We must beat off the effects of the
[1:56:02] hybrid body.
[1:56:04] We must beat off.
[1:56:07] Amen. The effects of the hybrid body
[1:56:12] so that we can be able to worship.
[1:56:15] He beats off these commitments.
[1:56:19] You know I work a six day
[1:56:24] and then on Sunday I am tired
[1:56:27] but pastor you brought the zoom.
[1:56:32] So I'm always there
[1:56:36] when you are drinking your cup of coffee
[1:56:41] and you are eating bread and butter
[1:56:45] you are zooming in
[1:56:48] and then you are saying that's right
[1:56:52] that's correct to show you have been
[1:56:54] present
[1:56:56] God have mercy
[1:57:02] We need to come into this presence.
[1:57:06] This is where the anointing is.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord to the elect.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; You know me, I didn't like that. Uh what
[1:57:16] do you call it? That uh
[1:57:19] streaming streaming.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; It's the pastor.
[1:57:28] me I'm from that analog age
[1:57:33] where I want to look at the people
[1:57:38] and I can be able to know this one here
[1:57:41] is resenting me
[1:57:46] this one here is taking it you know when
[1:57:49] you stand here the Holy Spirit refuse
[1:57:53] the people to you like
[1:57:56] That's why people say
[1:58:01] that pastor who tells him things nobody
[1:58:03] tells you but when you sit here the Holy
[1:58:07] Spirit takes over.
[1:58:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; So
[1:58:13] now you see we must be willing.
[1:58:18] We must be able to beat off the effects
[1:58:20] of this flesh.
[1:58:25] which is the seed on this side. The
[1:58:28] spirit is always
[1:58:31] this thing here
[1:58:33] is always weak
[1:58:37] until that on the inside
[1:58:43] and begins run
[1:58:47] to the water brooks.
[1:58:51] Amen. Whether you are hurt
[1:58:55] Because when that is called a heart,
[1:58:57] when it is hurt,
[1:59:02] it does not stop
[1:59:04] until it gets to the water brooks.
[1:59:08] These are the water brooks
[1:59:11] with all these I mean pillars of fire
[1:59:15] around
[1:59:17] a mighty presence of the Lord.
[1:59:21] It doesn't matter whether you are hurt,
[1:59:25] you tell God,
[1:59:27] I must go to the water.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I cannot just
[1:59:33] kind of get satisfied
[1:59:37] with painted fires on on streaming.
[1:59:45] Praise God.
[1:59:47] Now
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; there is a nature
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; his nature
[1:59:57] you were created to worship.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to confess this
[2:00:05] I was created to worship.
[2:00:11] So your entire life
[2:00:14] is about worship.
[2:00:19] You know, God
[2:00:22] told Moses, "Go and tell Pharaoh
[2:00:26] that let my people go and worship me."
[2:00:33] Pharaoh says, "Oh, it's okay. They can
[2:00:35] go
[2:00:37] and they can come back. Let them leave
[2:00:39] the children."
[2:00:42] says no. Everything of ours will have to
[2:00:47] go and worship.
[2:00:49] My car
[2:00:52] will go and worship the Lord.
[2:00:56] It will take me to church.
[2:00:59] My children must be taught how to
[2:01:01] worship God.
[2:01:03] So the worship actually God was meaning
[2:01:09] was an Exodus.
[2:01:13] from a a heathen life
[2:01:18] and a lifestyle
[2:01:21] that was commanded and led by the word.
[2:01:28] That's why God was in their planting.
[2:01:32] God was in their worship.
[2:01:35] God was in their feast.
[2:01:37] God was in their children.
[2:01:41] There are circum everything of that kind
[2:01:46] we shall get an opportunity
[2:01:48] and expand those elements.
[2:01:52] God separated them
[2:01:55] to make them a church
[2:01:58] called out people
[2:02:01] who live a life of worship.
[2:02:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And in our time
[2:02:06] today,
[2:02:07] the Lord has gone before us.
[2:02:10] open a way to bring this assembly here
[2:02:17] to live a life of worship
[2:02:20] that we can come together.
[2:02:23] We can tell what God has done through
[2:02:24] the week.
[2:02:26] We can be able to testify.
[2:02:29] We can tell our conditions.
[2:02:32] Then our brothers will pray for us. We
[2:02:35] have the boldness by the blood of Jesus.
[2:02:39] to the holy.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if you feel a call
[2:02:48] to worship, then there is a seed gene in
[2:02:51] you
[2:02:53] that needs to be awakened.
[2:02:56] And this awakened gene
[2:03:00] is the one which will beat the
[2:03:01] influences of the flesh
[2:03:05] because it will be thirsty.
[2:03:08] It should be thirsty.
[2:03:10] It can leave a palace.
[2:03:13] And there he was happy. When they said
[2:03:16] unto me, let us go to the house of the
[2:03:18] Lord. If the king can leave a house of M
[2:03:22] and go,
[2:03:26] how about you leaving these simple
[2:03:29] houses with tiles
[2:03:32] to come into the house of the Lord?
[2:03:35] Tell your brother, I belong to the house
[2:03:38] of God.
[2:03:41] Amen. You are here because there is a
[2:03:44] pool
[2:03:46] and this pool
[2:03:48] causes you sometimes
[2:03:51] to pray in the closet in your house.
[2:03:56] That pull
[2:03:58] causes you to forgive.
[2:04:01] That pull causes you to do the works of
[2:04:04] Christ.
[2:04:06] Are you together with me? You testify.
[2:04:09] You can do anything. You can't pass a
[2:04:12] book. Whatever you can do. Yes. Because
[2:04:15] there is a call
[2:04:18] on the inside.
[2:04:21] The message go tell.
[2:04:24] Brother Bronham says,
[2:04:28] "Praise the Lord, Lord God,
[2:04:32] for my precious little brother here."
[2:04:36] That was a prayer line the deepness and
[2:04:40] depth of his spirit
[2:04:44] cause like the deep calling to the deep.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because God
[2:04:52] is one deep
[2:04:55] and we we another deep and then the deep
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; was caught in the deep.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; And we are the deep
[2:05:08] that are part of God.
[2:05:11] The deep goes to the deep.
[2:05:13] The only one that can hear from God
[2:05:17] is the one who has got the seed gene.
[2:05:23] Some of them may be tears.
[2:05:27] So you don't listen to the tears.
[2:05:30] You listen to the deep call going to
[2:05:32] your deep.
[2:05:38] Praise the Lord. He wants the Holy
[2:05:41] Spirit.
[2:05:43] He's respected your servants
[2:05:47] in every way that he could
[2:05:51] by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:54] May it come upon my brother
[2:05:57] and he be filled with God's power
[2:06:00] and grace, the Holy Ghost. Receive him.
[2:06:06] Receive him
[2:06:09] as I commit.
[2:06:11] He says, "I see his deep."
[2:06:15] Is God seeing your deep today?
[2:06:18] If you are a hungry soul, I want you to
[2:06:21] hear this also.
[2:06:23] When the beep calls to the deep, it
[2:06:27] takes more than joining a church.
[2:06:34] It takes more than shaking hands with a
[2:06:37] preacher.
[2:06:40] It takes more than living a good
[2:06:43] straight life.
[2:06:47] It takes something to satisfy inside of
[2:06:50] you
[2:06:53] that powers down from God into the soul.
[2:06:58] The deep calling to the deep
[2:07:01] at the noise of thy waters sprout.
[2:07:06] Oh Lord, the deep calling to the deep.
[2:07:12] There must be something
[2:07:14] pouring from God
[2:07:17] into your soul.
[2:07:22] Are you together with him? There must be
[2:07:25] something
[2:07:27] get a hold of you.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Abraham
[2:07:34] had something holding.
[2:07:38] He could st out of the land,
[2:07:42] but there was something that was calling
[2:07:44] him always back to the Holy of Holies.
[2:07:48] Do you feel a call to the hall of holies
[2:07:51] to come into his presence
[2:07:53] to worship the Lord this afternoon?
[2:07:57] So worship is linked with eternity
[2:08:01] first.
[2:08:07] That deep dropping into the deep
[2:08:13] and coming into a union,
[2:08:17] the husband and wife.
[2:08:21] You being a bride,
[2:08:24] there must be something
[2:08:26] come together with you
[2:08:29] to bring forth a life
[2:08:32] that can worship God.
[2:08:36] Not on a particular mountain,
[2:08:40] not in Jerusalem.
[2:08:42] So going to church is good,
[2:08:45] but linking with eternity
[2:08:48] sparks the anointing of worship.
[2:08:53] Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; John 4:23,
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; he says, "But the hour cometh,
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; and now is when the truth worippers,
[2:09:10] the true worippers."
[2:09:14] Now he's not saying worshippers
[2:09:18] because Cain worshipped.
[2:09:20] But he says the true worshipper
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; shall worship the father
[2:09:26] in spirit and in truth. For the father
[2:09:31] taketh search to worship him.
[2:09:37] And the scripture says, "The son of man
[2:09:41] came to seek
[2:09:43] and to find." What is he looking for?
[2:09:47] That seed.
[2:09:49] You remember the ego story.
[2:09:52] The mother ego when he came.
[2:09:56] Amen. Hurrying up in the space
[2:10:00] knowing her voice.
[2:10:04] He was looking for something specific
[2:10:10] that came from him.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; He seeketh such
[2:10:22] to worship him because God is a spirit.
[2:10:28] And they that worship him
[2:10:31] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[2:10:37] Now listen here. We worship in spirit.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And it's only those
[2:10:45] that came from the spirit.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Amen. That can
[2:10:54] worship in the spirit.
[2:10:57] And those are the ones
[2:11:00] that can stay with the truth
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; in spirit
[2:11:08] because they come from the spirit
[2:11:11] and truth because they are part of that
[2:11:14] truth.
[2:11:16] They come from that spirit
[2:11:18] so that we can be able to worship in
[2:11:21] spirit.
[2:11:23] Let us make man in our image.
[2:11:26] And when we receive his word,
[2:11:29] we abide in the word.
[2:11:34] Amen. So coming from the same spirit,
[2:11:39] abiding in the same character of the
[2:11:41] world
[2:11:43] on the constant
[2:11:46] spirit
[2:11:48] and truth. For there is a nature in you
[2:11:53] where the dove
[2:11:57] can come and roast
[2:12:00] and that way he can take over your life
[2:12:04] and you'll be able to worship
[2:12:08] because you are alive
[2:12:11] upon which the father spirit can come
[2:12:16] upon you because he comes with the same
[2:12:19] nature.
[2:12:25] So are you together with me? Let us go
[2:12:28] to Romans chapter 8. Look at this.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 verse 26.
[2:12:38] He says, "Likewise,
[2:12:40] the spirit also helps our infirmities."
[2:12:47] He helps
[2:12:49] our infirmities.
[2:12:51] Amen. Amen. For we know not
[2:12:55] what we should pray for as we,
[2:12:59] but the spirit himself
[2:13:02] makes intercession for us with groanings
[2:13:06] which cannot be uttered.
[2:13:10] So in this scripture,
[2:13:13] the Holy Spirit comes in as a comforter.
[2:13:19] He steps into your weakness
[2:13:22] as a comforter,
[2:13:24] the advocate.
[2:13:26] He knows what we want
[2:13:28] and yet we cannot perform the right
[2:13:31] approach
[2:13:34] because many times when you are caught
[2:13:37] in something wrong,
[2:13:41] your heart melts.
[2:13:47] Amen. You don't have the boldness.
[2:13:50] You cannot sit stand before God
[2:13:53] and say, "Father's mercy upon you."
[2:13:56] You need an
[2:14:00] you need the Holy Spirit.
[2:14:03] Amen. To go with you through the strips
[2:14:06] of blood.
[2:14:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Into the Holy of
[2:14:11] Holies.
[2:14:13] Listen what the prophet says here.
[2:14:15] Sometimes when we go to the Holy Ghost,
[2:14:19] we ignorantly stagger into something.
[2:14:26] Amen. And sometimes when you know,
[2:14:32] but the nature
[2:14:34] pulls you that way. The son of God
[2:14:38] cannot stay there because he knows that
[2:14:42] a blood strip has been beat
[2:14:48] all the way from where he is
[2:14:51] to the master seat.
[2:14:53] Where will you find if you run away from
[2:14:55] his presence?
[2:14:59] Come into his presence.
[2:15:02] Amen. The Holy Spirit
[2:15:05] is there to take advocate for us.
[2:15:09] He's our advocator.
[2:15:13] He stands there.
[2:15:15] He's our attorney.
[2:15:18] He stands there and pleads for us. We
[2:15:22] don't plead for ourselves because the
[2:15:24] Holy Ghost in us
[2:15:27] pleads for us. Holy Spirit giving
[2:15:30] utterance
[2:15:32] sometimes with words you cannot
[2:15:34] understand
[2:15:36] and he makes intercessions for us.
[2:15:39] That's what the Holy Ghost is.
[2:15:41] When I walk into anything,
[2:15:45] I walk like a a little kid.
[2:15:50] We walk like a little fellow.
[2:15:53] We walk in a dark world
[2:15:56] full of enemies, full of sin, full of
[2:16:00] traps,
[2:16:03] full of everything.
[2:16:05] You Oh, I'm afraid
[2:16:08] to take a Christian life. I'm afraid to
[2:16:11] do this. I'm afraid I'll do this. Don't
[2:16:15] be afraid. We have an advocate.
[2:16:19] He stands by us. He's in us and he makes
[2:16:24] intercessions for us.
[2:16:27] The Holy Spirit constantly
[2:16:31] making an advocate for us all the time.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So petition him
[2:16:41] and the advocate
[2:16:43] will be present
[2:16:45] to petition before the father.
[2:16:50] Amen.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Don't wait
[2:16:53] saying that, oh maybe I need to be
[2:16:55] perfect
[2:16:57] before I approach the father.
[2:17:00] You need to go the father and the lord
[2:17:02] of your sin
[2:17:06] and it is him. He will bring you into
[2:17:09] the perfect work.
[2:17:13] He doesn't call us to throw our burdens
[2:17:18] before we go to him.
[2:17:20] Because that way you would have never
[2:17:22] needed a savior.
[2:17:25] But he says come unto me all you who
[2:17:29] labor as a heavy
[2:17:32] carry your burdens and come to me. You
[2:17:36] start coming
[2:17:38] and you are limping
[2:17:39] and you are fearing and you are afraid
[2:17:43] but he has called
[2:17:46] come unto me. Amen.
[2:17:49] Come at me. Come at me.
[2:17:53] So there is an advocate
[2:17:56] and the advocate
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; is not for the seed of Cain.
[2:18:03] The advocate
[2:18:05] is there to advocate for the seed gene
[2:18:08] of God.
[2:18:12] Meaning that you can be a seed
[2:18:15] and as the prophet uses the word
[2:18:19] You stagger.
[2:18:21] What shows you a receipt
[2:18:24] is to run back to the father
[2:18:28] to thank God for the advocate
[2:18:32] because he receives you with your burden
[2:18:36] and he takes it away
[2:18:39] and gives you his yoke.
[2:18:45] And when you take his yoke,
[2:18:48] he says, "Learn from me,
[2:18:53] what does that mean that present
[2:18:56] yourself
[2:18:59] to where you can learn from him?
[2:19:03] Come back to the house of the Lord.
[2:19:06] He has bless teaching priests
[2:19:12] to learn from him."
[2:19:14] So the blood is the open door
[2:19:18] to worship.
[2:19:20] As you walk into the fountain,
[2:19:23] you are just opening up into presence.
[2:19:28] Do you love him? Do you love the
[2:19:31] presence of the Lord?
[2:19:34] Amen. So the blood is the open door to
[2:19:39] divine worship.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now during the season
[2:19:46] of the son of man
[2:19:48] listen on earth some Greeks came to
[2:19:53] Jerusalem
[2:19:56] to worship. I want to put an emphasis
[2:19:58] here on the blood
[2:20:01] because without the blood they cannot be
[2:20:04] worshiped.
[2:20:05] much as you may need to worship
[2:20:10] like these Greeks
[2:20:12] who came on the feast of the Passover,
[2:20:16] the season of the blood atonement
[2:20:20] because they had heard of the miracles.
[2:20:23] They had heard the signs,
[2:20:26] the wonders, the nature and character of
[2:20:29] Christ.
[2:20:31] Amen. as it was defined.
[2:20:35] So they came
[2:20:37] amen to Philip
[2:20:40] and they said sir
[2:20:43] we would see Jesus.
[2:20:46] But the scripture earlier on says they
[2:20:49] had come to Jerusalem to worship.
[2:20:54] So Jesus with that prophetic anointing.
[2:20:59] He knew what they were looking for.
[2:21:03] They were looking for an object of
[2:21:05] worship.
[2:21:08] They were looking for God.
[2:21:11] They came to worship. So they came to
[2:21:14] Philillip and they said s would see
[2:21:17] Jesus.
[2:21:19] Philip went to Andrew
[2:21:23] and together they went to Jesus.
[2:21:26] But when the two disciples came to
[2:21:27] Christ,
[2:21:29] the revelation
[2:21:31] of the purpose of him coming into the
[2:21:34] world
[2:21:37] broke open to him and was very eminent.
[2:21:45] some person
[2:21:48] to come to me
[2:21:50] and say there are some Greeks that
[2:21:52] desire to worship
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:57] because the records in the word.
[2:22:01] It says that they came to worship him.
[2:22:06] They came to worship him
[2:22:08] because they wanted a miracle.
[2:22:12] They washed him because he had performed
[2:22:15] a miracle.
[2:22:17] But these Greeks,
[2:22:19] they came to worship. Hallelujah.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; I like those Greeks.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; They came to worship. And when
[2:22:31] this was brought to the master,
[2:22:34] the master
[2:22:36] answered and said in John 12:23,
[2:22:41] "And Jesus answered them, saying,
[2:22:46] "The hour is come
[2:22:48] that the Son of Man should be
[2:22:51] glorified." Very
[2:22:54] ver very I say unto you,
[2:22:57] except the cord of which fall into the
[2:22:59] ground and die,
[2:23:03] it abides alone,
[2:23:05] but if it die, bringeth forth much
[2:23:09] fruit.
[2:23:11] So the time had come
[2:23:14] for Jesus to open the gate
[2:23:18] into the Holy of Holies.
[2:23:21] The time had come for the curtain
[2:23:26] to be torn from top to bottom.
[2:23:30] The time had come for the cherab beans
[2:23:35] to put back those shining swords
[2:23:41] into their pro
[2:23:43] that everybody
[2:23:45] to have the access to go into the hall
[2:23:48] of holy.
[2:23:50] Hallelujah. He to feed his life.
[2:23:56] Amen. Oh, praise the Lord to have a
[2:23:59] great harvest.
[2:24:02] He shed the blood.
[2:24:04] He opened the worship.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; The blood because it breaches the chasm
[2:24:14] that was caused by sin.
[2:24:18] And by this blood, we get the B
[2:24:23] to enter into the holiness.
[2:24:27] by the blood of Jesus.
[2:24:30] The blood needed to be there.
[2:24:34] Has the blood moved ever since?
[2:24:38] The blood
[2:24:39] all the way from Calvary
[2:24:42] has never lost its power
[2:24:45] until the last elected is safe to sin no
[2:24:48] more.
[2:24:54] So let's wind up with Hebrews here
[2:24:59] chapter 10 verse 19.
[2:25:02] Having therefore brethren
[2:25:08] boldness to enter into the holiest
[2:25:12] by our righteousness.
[2:25:16] Does it say so?
[2:25:19] No.
[2:25:21] by the blood of Jesus.
[2:25:25] So this morning in whatsoever condition
[2:25:30] the blood has opened the way for you
[2:25:36] go into the hall of holies
[2:25:38] and after you've gone in there
[2:25:41] then you realize the righteousness of
[2:25:43] God.
[2:25:46] His perfection comes upon you.
[2:25:51] You walk a life
[2:25:54] that stays under sanctification
[2:25:58] by the study of the word.
[2:26:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am talking
[2:26:03] about the presence of the blood this
[2:26:04] week.
[2:26:06] I am therefore talking about the
[2:26:08] boldness.
[2:26:10] Enter into the holiest.
[2:26:13] How many of you believe you've been
[2:26:14] washed by the blood?
[2:26:17] That's your boldness.
[2:26:19] every wickedness
[2:26:21] remember the fountain.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. With the blood of bulls and goats,
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; the high priests
[2:26:32] entered timidly.
[2:26:34] But with this blood, the repenting
[2:26:37] sinner
[2:26:39] is getting in there.
[2:26:42] Amen. under the boldiness
[2:26:45] of the presence of the blood
[2:26:48] into the presence worship
[2:26:51] breaking in revelation.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Of the blood.
[2:26:58] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. When we break
[2:27:00] it that revelation,
[2:27:03] we see the fountain
[2:27:05] flowing in and then out of the soul.
[2:27:12] Praise the Lord. The fountain flowing in
[2:27:17] and then out.
[2:27:21] Something drops
[2:27:24] from the deep.
[2:27:27] That's the life.
[2:27:29] behind the blood
[2:27:32] drops in here
[2:27:34] and builds a fountain of grace
[2:27:41] and then
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; you are a worshipper
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; and then your conscience
[2:27:49] gets washed.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; If anything else comes
[2:27:54] that's a good fight.
[2:27:58] It's a good fight.
[2:28:00] When you get in temptations,
[2:28:03] when you get in trials,
[2:28:05] it's a good fight.
[2:28:08] You ought to fight it
[2:28:14] and be able to overcome.
[2:28:16] Don't become like a king.
[2:28:19] From thy presence shall I hide.
[2:28:24] Go back.
[2:28:26] This is where you belong.
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:36] with blood.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; I want to hear it. Don't
[2:28:40] [Music]
[2:28:42] me.
[2:28:49] I see
[2:28:52] blood.
[2:28:57] That flood
[2:28:59] lo
[2:29:03] there again.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Are you having stains of guilt?
[2:29:12] Come to the blood.
[2:29:17] We are still in Hebrews. Before I finish
[2:29:21] verse 21 and verse 22.
[2:29:26] and having a high priest
[2:29:29] over the house of God.
[2:29:32] Let us draw near. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:29:36] Hallelujah.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Not draw away.
[2:29:39] Let us draw near
[2:29:42] with a true heart.
[2:29:49] You don't come to church trying to find
[2:29:52] whether you can stay.
[2:29:57] No, a true heart
[2:30:01] in full assurance of faith
[2:30:05] having our hearts sprinkled from
[2:30:07] univerience
[2:30:14] and our bodies wash with a pure water.
[2:30:20] That's the boldness
[2:30:22] to enter to the real worship.
[2:30:25] Amen. Amen.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Before I
[2:30:29] finish,
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to know that your conscience
[2:30:34] is sprinkled.
[2:30:38] Amen. You don't think yourself towards
[2:30:40] evil.
[2:30:43] You think yourself towards
[2:30:45] righteousness.
[2:30:47] And when something wrong,
[2:30:50] gets into your life. You don't think
[2:30:53] yourself towards hell.
[2:30:56] You think yourself towards restoration.
[2:30:59] And I want to see restoration this
[2:31:01] morning.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A heart fully assured,
[2:31:09] fully the sprinkling of the blood
[2:31:13] wash the conscious of self condemnation.
[2:31:19] to have a self condemnation.
[2:31:22] When Jesus himself at for you, why do
[2:31:26] you condemn yourself?
[2:31:30] You need to come
[2:31:32] into the house of worship. You come into
[2:31:37] the holy of holies and you fall before
[2:31:40] him and you say, "Father, I am here."
[2:31:44] You need to become that prodigal son.
[2:31:48] Don't become
[2:31:50] that from thy presence shall I be
[2:31:53] healed. When you make a mistake in your
[2:31:57] presence shall I come. That's the sea.
[2:32:01] Amen. So at Calvary when the blood was
[2:32:05] finally released
[2:32:08] he didn't say you are condemned.
[2:32:11] He says it's finished. What has been
[2:32:14] finished that I have released
[2:32:18] the city,
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; the life in the blood.
[2:32:23] Amen. Come down
[2:32:27] and get united to the seed gene in your
[2:32:30] soul.
[2:32:33] And when that happens,
[2:32:36] it ignites
[2:32:39] the life of the lamb in your life.
[2:32:44] That's the only way you can have the
[2:32:46] life of the lamb
[2:32:49] by the life
[2:32:51] that was in the blood
[2:32:54] to unite himself
[2:32:56] with your seed
[2:32:59] of something supernatural
[2:33:02] and be born in you.
[2:33:06] And when he released the blood, he said
[2:33:09] it's finished.
[2:33:12] Are you together with me?
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; It is finished in the sense that you
[2:33:17] have attained your salvation
[2:33:21] and the door to the hall of holies
[2:33:24] is now open for you. You can enter the
[2:33:27] holiest
[2:33:29] to express yourself
[2:33:32] in worship.
[2:33:34] You are God's finished work.
[2:33:38] He said it's finished.
[2:33:41] in the Old Testament.
[2:33:45] He would go every year. He would go
[2:33:48] every year. That's the priest, the high
[2:33:51] priest. But when he went in,
[2:33:55] Hallelujah. He rose
[2:33:58] after taking captivity captive
[2:34:02] and he ascended up your
[2:34:05] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He presented the blood
[2:34:10] as the master seat and then the Bible
[2:34:13] said he sat down. Hallelujah. Because
[2:34:18] he's not coming back
[2:34:20] into the temple again, the natural
[2:34:23] temple. He finished the redemption
[2:34:27] and he sat down.
[2:34:29] It is finished.
[2:34:31] He has given you everything you need
[2:34:34] to live the life of a Christian.
[2:34:37] Ephesians 2:10 say
[2:34:40] you are his workmanship.
[2:34:43] So you have everything
[2:34:46] that moves you into the presence of God
[2:34:48] to worship.
[2:34:52] Sometimes you become so fundamental
[2:34:55] in determining whether we can or we
[2:34:57] cannot enter into the holiest to
[2:35:00] worship.
[2:35:07] Mhm. The door is open for you. Sometimes
[2:35:10] we become so fundamental
[2:35:13] to the extreme
[2:35:15] as whether we can receive the Holy Ghost
[2:35:17] or we may not.
[2:35:21] But God,
[2:35:27] he gave his son,
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; died for your condition,
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; and he says it's finished.
[2:35:34] And good news for you, he's still at the
[2:35:38] master seat.
[2:35:43] He's still there.
[2:35:45] What is he there for?
[2:35:48] For you. Because as long as you are in
[2:35:51] this flesh
[2:35:53] is because there is a work God still
[2:35:55] wants to do on your life.
[2:36:00] If you are away
[2:36:04] from the heavenly places,
[2:36:08] I want you to do one thing. declare
[2:36:11] yourself,
[2:36:13] that prodigal son,
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; and you say,
[2:36:17] "I'll go back to the father
[2:36:21] and confess my shortcomings.
[2:36:25] Have sinned against heaven
[2:36:27] and in thy sight. I'm no more worth to
[2:36:31] be called thy son.
[2:36:34] But as far as the father is concerned
[2:36:37] once a son
[2:36:39] forever son.
[2:36:41] Why? Because the seed
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; is eternal. God bless you. The seed is
[2:36:48] eternal.
[2:36:49] You are a child of God.
[2:36:53] Praise God.
[2:36:56] God will follow
[2:36:59] to catch up with you
[2:37:02] to build a feeling on the inside
[2:37:07] like he built in that prodigal son
[2:37:12] who was begging to eat of sheep's food.
[2:37:18] But being a son,
[2:37:21] the deep began to call to the deep
[2:37:25] Do you have a deep that's calling to the
[2:37:27] deep this afternoon?
[2:37:30] You have a deep.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; You are a child of God.
[2:37:35] The
[2:37:37] suffer
[2:37:43] with blood
[2:37:46] from
[2:37:48] me.
[2:37:50] You will see.
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:38:05] Why don't we stand up and raise our
[2:38:06] hands?
[2:38:10] [Music]
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh yes.
[2:38:31] and we start to feel like a grace
[2:38:35] cannot cover our condition.
[2:38:39] But heavenly father,
[2:38:41] there's nothing stronger
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; than the grace that brought you from
[2:38:46] heaven
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; to pour the blood
[2:38:50] that you yourself.
[2:38:53] Your eternal spirit
[2:38:56] may come down in the upper room
[2:39:00] and keep coming down.
[2:39:02] Every other congregation sins
[2:39:05] [Music]
[2:39:07] to attach yourself as a pill of fire
[2:39:11] upon the seed chin in the lives of the
[2:39:13] people
[2:39:16] they are yours every
[2:39:18] eternal
[2:39:20] may you come down every fire
[2:39:23] shake out
[2:39:26] every situation
[2:39:28] in the lives of your children
[2:39:30] because you love
[2:39:32] You will never lose any.
[2:39:35] Father, I therefore pray that you may go
[2:39:39] and stand
[2:39:41] before every soul
[2:39:44] that seeketh to be restored
[2:39:47] in the name of Jesus.
[2:39:50] May the grace of God rule over us. They
[2:39:54] are your children. They are yours.
[2:39:59] Amazing grace. will deserve.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[2:40:09] [Music]
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; It's amazing grace, brother.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; So amazing
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; to say
[2:40:24] a race like you and me. I
[2:40:30] Christ God.
[2:40:33] I
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; I once was lost. Oh,
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; found never to be lost.
[2:40:45] [Music]
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:40:56] [Music]
[2:41:04] Heavenly Father,
[2:41:07] we lift up our hands
[2:41:10] in humility.
[2:41:12] Thanking you, heavenly father
[2:41:15] for the amazing grace.
[2:41:18] Lord, what shall we be
[2:41:22] without that grace?
[2:41:25] But give us the grace
[2:41:27] that we may display
[2:41:30] the attributes of the saraphim.
[2:41:33] Always reverent to the calling of God
[2:41:38] and always heavenly father, humble
[2:41:42] and willing to serve.
[2:41:45] I pray dear Lord Jesus
[2:41:48] that these are your children.
[2:41:51] Embrace them.
[2:41:53] bring them before the Lord
[2:41:56] and just negotiate a little bit with
[2:41:58] them,
[2:42:00] Father. Because here and there
[2:42:04] there are ways of evil that grip your
[2:42:06] children,
[2:42:09] but they are your children, Father.
[2:42:12] Bring them back to you in Jesus name.
[2:42:16] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[2:42:18] of praise.
