[3:36] [Music]
[3:46] foreign
[3:50] [Music]
[3:56] I thank God so much that I'm before you
[3:59] this day
[4:01] I have not been so
[4:04] regular in church
[4:06] but you know family tells me
[4:10] but my heart has always been that I
[4:12] should be here for service
[4:16] God has given me victory over so many
[4:19] things
[4:21] other place of work
[4:23] I've seen him fight for me
[4:27] I love
[4:29] I know it's there for me
[4:32] thank you so much for those who daily
[4:34] prayer for me
[4:36] you know being an administrator is not
[4:40] an easy thing you actually have to make
[4:43] enemies every day as you take decisions
[4:46] but like God has been on my side
[4:49] but for today
[4:51] I personally want to thank God last week
[4:54] my daughter hope
[4:56] give birth
[4:59] she gave birth much to us with a
[5:01] testimony
[5:03] she has been pregnant
[5:05] but the devil has been in a fight
[5:09] the first diagnostic bleed
[5:13] which was not good
[5:15] but we said good this is not supposed to
[5:18] be so
[5:19] intervene
[5:22] under clothes disorders we praised God
[5:26] for that
[5:27] [Music]
[5:30] she started live on Thursday last week
[5:33] she lived by the Thursday no progress
[5:37] she left Friday
[5:40] should get contractions she goes to
[5:42] hospital they disappear
[5:45] a liar
[5:47] this United
[5:49] on Saturday
[5:52] I went to God In Prayer
[5:54] I made tea at home
[5:57] I prayed for the tea
[5:59] I told God I'm going to hospital this
[6:02] tea
[6:03] lever must progress
[6:06] so I gave her the tea
[6:09] labor started very strong this time
[6:12] went to hospital
[6:14] it was a journey of no return
[6:17] and she delivered normally
[6:23] yet with science
[6:25] she was operated last year she was
[6:27] actually supposed to have been operated
[6:29] again
[6:30] but he prayed against the operation
[6:33] God did a wonderful thing
[6:36] is always there
[6:38] and it's a programmer
[6:57] and he actually delivered her
[6:59] successfully and safely that is the
[7:02] glory of God to help the work as they
[7:05] know
[7:06] that one was supposed to be impossible
[7:08] because she had what is called aroska
[7:11] but to me I see all that has been
[7:14] brought
[7:16] and finally
[7:18] we just need to pray for me that I don't
[7:21] get very busy when is this
[7:23] and at least I come to church
[7:26] God has opened the door for me
[7:29] I have a weekend program
[7:31] that is going to be taking me away every
[7:34] weekend
[7:35] and if taking me away every weekend
[7:38] it means I will also not be having a
[7:40] Sunday to pray
[7:42] and that is the vision of the Soul
[7:45] pray with me that my Witnesses become
[7:47] lighter for me but I should actually
[7:49] find him to come to church
[7:52] because there are times when I have
[7:53] meetings the whole day one after the
[7:55] other
[7:56] there was a witness that came out of a
[7:58] meeting at six I was so stressed but I
[8:01] really pray God gives me opportunity to
[8:03] be able to come to church on Wednesday
[8:04] so pray together with me
[8:09] I just want to sing a short song

[25:07] amen
[25:08] brother Branham told the
[25:11] that little ego story
[25:16] and he says an ego laid some egg
[25:22] and then the egg were taken by some
[25:27] farmer
[25:31] and that farm approached that egg and
[25:33] the chicken
[25:36] and it was hatched together with the
[25:38] chicken
[25:41] but that ego
[25:45] held the nature much as it was hatched
[25:48] under the chicken
[25:51] and now it had some difficult times
[25:55] to kind of feed with the chicken
[26:00] try to live on that stuff and
[26:04] dead stuff
[26:06] you know and it was having a lot of
[26:09] trouble at his stomach
[26:12] but then the mother never gave up
[26:16] he knew his egg was somewhere
[26:20] and she kept looking for the ego
[26:24] and you know what she was always doing
[26:28] she was putting out the ego sound
[26:32] [Music]
[26:34] and that's how this little egos were
[26:36] doing
[26:38] and the chicken always looked at them
[26:41] and said what kind of a noise do these
[26:45] our sisters make
[27:06] [Music]
[27:39] [Music]
[27:42] and when God speaks
[27:51] foreign foreign
[29:13] this is your message it came direct to
[29:17] you because God knew you from before the
[29:20] foundation of the world

[29:30] amen we have heard from heaven
[29:33] and we have the voice of God

[29:45] us
[29:46] that were not in Jeffersonville at the
[29:49] time of the ministering of the world
[29:53] and the most important thing here is
[29:56] to hold that message
[30:00] nobody should take it away from you
[30:03] it is
[30:08] praise God isn't that wonderful to know
[30:12] that God wrote a love letter to you
[30:15] and you blessed it in the mystery of his
[30:18] word
[30:19] and once you read the mystery

[48:29] [Applause]
[48:34] [Music]
[48:58] [Music]
[49:04] uh
[49:06] I remember as a young boy
[49:10] my precious daddy here
[49:13] told me to come and say something
[49:17] and I laughed at him
[49:20] knowing me I I like flying planes
[49:23] this is not my portion and he kept on
[49:27] telling me son you're a preacher
[49:29] and I just thought this dream of him may
[49:33] God help him
[49:37] several years later
[49:39] [Music]
[49:44] [Applause]
[49:48] you know how God works

[50:25] foreign
[51:01] Mark the place wait against H4 bride of
[51:04] Christ Mark the place wait against H4
[51:07] amen amen so it provides us an insight
[51:10] into the concept of laying in God's
[51:13] presence
[51:15] in this particular verse
[51:19] the Mother-in-law of Ruth
[51:22] advises her to approach boys
[51:26] a close relative
[51:28] while he's laying down
[51:31] after a day of winnowing barley New
[51:35] Mexico
[51:38] to truly understand this
[51:41] the significance of laying in God's
[51:44] presence
[51:46] we must fast
[51:48] recognize the symbolic meaning of behind
[51:52] this act
[51:54] the symbolic meaning laying down signify
[51:58] a posture again
[52:01] foreign
[52:29] acknowledging our dependence
[52:32] on God and His Divine guidance
[52:38] there is an attitude that you have to
[52:40] approach
[52:42] as you lay in his presence again
[52:46] amen Amina
[52:48] no means structures to lay down at both
[52:53] feet
[52:56] amen amen as a song has gone they'll
[53:00] find me on my knees
[53:02] as submission I Surrender
[53:06] demonstrate you a commitment of loyalty
[53:11] oh Lord Jesus Christ
[53:14] Jesus Christ himself is here present he
[53:19] is a revealed one of the day
[53:26] great mystery of God the godhead being
[53:31] finished that's what he is so we should
[53:36] be laying in his presence
[53:37] again amen amen we see in the second
[53:41] Corinthians
[53:43] three
[53:45] second Corinthians 3.
[53:48] from verse 17.
[53:58] amen
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:47] Hallelujah
[54:50] it gets sweeter
[54:52] how's it is
[54:58] the Bible speaks the transform
[55:03] transformative work
[55:07] of the holy spirit in the lives of
[55:10] Believers amen amen let now the Lord is
[55:15] that spirit
[55:17] and when the spirit of the Lord is
[55:20] there is freedom amen amen and we all
[55:25] with unliving and unveiled face
[55:29] behold in the glory of the Lord
[55:33] are the same being uh are the same being
[55:37] image of one degree transformation
[55:42] into Glory into our glory in another
[55:46] one for this comes from the Lord who is
[55:49] the spirit amen
[56:14] [Music]
[56:24] [Applause]
[56:25] it teaches us
[56:31] transformation into God's image
