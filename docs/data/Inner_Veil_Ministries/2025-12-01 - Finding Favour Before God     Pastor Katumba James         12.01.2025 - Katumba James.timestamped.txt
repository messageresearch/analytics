[31:19] time listen to
[31:21] this such that you are
[31:24] built praise the name of the Lord we've
[31:27] taken a about I think two or three
[31:31] weeks talking about the Holy
[31:34] Ghost what is the Holy
[31:37] Ghost you know the Holy Ghost being the
[31:41] teacher the Holy Ghost being the
[31:45] seal the Holy Ghost being the

[31:53] Advocate

[32:02] token which we have been talking about
[32:04] through this last
[32:06] week and then we want to also take
[32:10] timeing from Wednesday
[32:13] morning to talk about the Holy
[32:16] Ghost as
[32:18] Charity praise the name of the Lord
[32:21] really encourage
[32:23] you take your

[32:29] we don't have enough time to teach here
[32:31] at
[32:32] church praise the name of our Lord
[32:35] whereby you take that time maybe picking
[32:37] one scripture and expound on
[32:41] it so you take time and this things will
[32:44] help
[32:46] you you know we are living in days of
[32:50] deception a lot of
[32:53] deception and you know Storms
[32:55] Come and then as if there is no ST
[32:58] storm then again they come and every
[33:02] storm that
[33:04] comes makes some people
[33:07] fall just like in a
[33:12] forest and those who are weak they fall
[33:16] down and then after another
[33:20] season those who are weak they fall down
[33:24] you get it and so there are storms of
[33:27] Doctrine
[33:31] some coming like
[33:33] earthquakes some coming like big storm
[33:36] like those which are making fire burning
[33:38] Los
[33:41] Angeles then some comes you know like
[33:45] fire wind different
[33:49] things and they come you know with a lot
[33:52] of
[33:53] force they take your
[33:56] attention they can sweep you off if
[33:58] you're not
[33:59] careful but none of those
[34:02] things none of those
[34:04] things took alah's
[34:07] attention none of them took El's
[34:11] attention until El had the still Small
[34:16] Voice praise the name of our now just
[34:19] before we
[34:21] continue I didn't plan to say
[34:23] this but I feel I need to read
[34:26] it can put it on the
[34:30] stream brother Bram
[34:36] says he says in the message God keeps
[34:38] his
[34:40] word he
[34:42] says I've went into

[35:52] running around like the
[35:53] pastor if the pastor
[35:56] jumps everybody starts
[35:58] jumping and then he
[36:01] says you watch every one of congregation
[36:04] catch the same

[38:44] then you get a spirit gets a hold of
[38:47] us and then somebody no longer
[38:50] listen only one what amen they run
[38:53] around they run
[38:56] around no
[38:58] sit and be
[39:00] Faith praise the name of our so we want
[39:03] to thank God for
[39:04] that and we just want to move by
[39:08] that praise the name of our not the Ws
[39:11] that have
[39:13] come no praise the name of you know
[39:17] those winds come and they sweep
[39:20] many at the end of the day you've moved
[39:23] around run running around
[39:28] comes you have no word in you you
[39:33] fall praise the name of the Lord so we
[39:35] just need to really be careful
[39:38] about praise the name of our Lord so
[39:40] brother said that a
[39:43] church where a pastor is a solid gospel
[39:49] teacher all
[39:51] hell Will Never Move that
[39:54] church praise the name of our Lord but
[39:57] this
[39:58] wins they will be
[40:02] moved praise the name of our Lord but
[40:04] when we stand on the solid word of
[40:07] God we know where we are
[40:09] standing and we can discern what kind of
[40:12] spirit is in
[40:15] our praise the name of I see brother
[40:18] Peter you're welcome Simon you're
[40:23] welcome praise the name of
[40:26] Lord quite a number of activities to
[40:30] do and I pray you'll bear with us we
[40:32] have only one
[40:34] service the name of the
[40:37] Lord so we have dedication of brother
[40:39] emo jong's grandchildren
[40:44] again let sing let them bring them in as
[40:47] the children grandchildren come
[40:52] forward bring them in bring bring them
[41:00] in bring them in from the fs of
[41:08] s breing them
[41:12] in bring them
[41:16] in bring down wondering ones to
[41:24] Jes amen we want to thank God for our
[41:26] brother em
[41:30] is concerned
[41:32] about his second or third
[41:38] generation you know the Bible
[41:40] says I'm forgetting how the scripture
[41:42] puts
[41:43] it but talks about a
[41:47] man who can live his wealth or
[41:55] inheritance for his grandchildren
[41:58] praise the name of many of us look at
[42:01] our
[42:02] children which is good because if you
[42:05] don't take care of your
[42:06] children you may lose your
[42:09] grandchildren and so we need to see that
[42:11] we pass what we
[42:14] believe to our children and our
[42:18] grandchildren and our brother is trying
[42:20] to to bring the children the
[42:21] grandchildren to the
[42:24] Lord now in Matthew chapter 19
[42:28] and then in
[42:30] verse3 the Bible says then were there
[42:34] brought unto him little
[42:37] children that he put his hands on
[42:41] them and pray and the disciples rebuked
[42:46] them but Jesus said Ser little
[42:51] children I forb them
[42:54] not to come unto me
[42:57] for of such is the kingdom of
[43:02] heaven and he laid his hands on
[43:05] them and departed then so Jesus didn't
[43:09] baptize little
[43:12] children the way we see being done in
[43:15] denomination baptism of small children
[43:18] is not
[43:19] right but the little children are
[43:21] brought to the
[43:22] law and he dedicated them and this what
[43:27] for these little
[43:29] children
[43:33] [Music]

[1:08:53] live
[1:08:55] you know favor when you get meet
[1:08:59] strangers so we want to talk about
[1:09:01] finding favor before
[1:09:04] God let us stand up and go to Proverbs
[1:09:07] chapter
[1:09:11] 3 Proverbs chapter
[1:09:14] 3 we're reading from verse
[1:09:22] one okay before we read it us pray again
[1:09:27] father we thank you again this
[1:09:31] time we are going to the reading of the
[1:09:33] word and the preaching of
[1:09:36] it and you said that the scripture is of
[1:09:38] no private
[1:09:41] interpretation we pray therefore that
[1:09:43] the Holy
[1:09:44] Spirit may come and search our
[1:09:47] hearts that Lord you may speak to us
[1:09:50] that we have need
[1:09:51] of and bless us father and help us to
[1:09:55] leave by Your
[1:09:56] Word In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and
[1:10:00] this amen prover 3
[1:10:04] vers1 up to
[1:10:07] verse it says my son forget not my law
[1:10:11] but let thine heart keep my
[1:10:21] Commandments for length of days and for
[1:10:24] long life and peace shall they add unto
[1:10:37] thee let not mercy and Truth forsake
[1:10:40] thee bind them about thy neck write them
[1:10:44] upon the table of thine head
[1:10:59] so shalt thou find favor and good
[1:11:01] understanding in the sight of
[1:11:12] and trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:11:16] heart and lean not unto thy own
[1:11:19] understanding
[1:11:28] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:11:32] Shall
[1:11:41] direct be not wise in thy own eyes fear
[1:11:45] the lord and depart from
[1:11:52] Evil may God bless of his word you may
[1:11:57] so verse three the Bible
[1:12:01] says okay verse for so shall you find
[1:12:05] favor and good understanding in the
[1:12:08] sight of God and
[1:12:17] man so we are talking about finding
[1:12:21] favor before God
[1:12:25] how do I find favor before

[1:12:43] acceptable to be
[1:12:46] received you know the Bible the Bible
[1:12:49] talks about the children in the
[1:12:53] marketplace praise the name of Lord and
[1:12:56] then when we go to Luke chapter
[1:12:59] 7 and then verse
[1:13:02] 29 the scripture
[1:13:04] says and all the people that heard
[1:13:07] him and the publicans Justified God
[1:13:12] being baptized with the baptism of John
[1:13:28] but the Pharisees and the lawyers
[1:13:30] rejected the counil of God against
[1:13:33] themselves being not baptized of
[1:13:44] him now he's talking about when John the
[1:13:47] Baptist
[1:13:49] came when John the Baptist came and was
[1:13:51] preaching the
[1:13:53] gospel on River
[1:13:55] Jordan you know people were coming to
[1:13:58] him from the towns and from all the
[1:14:02] villages because they heard that God had
[1:14:04] risen a
[1:14:07] prophet and then when people were coming
[1:14:09] to
[1:14:10] John the sodas came and they said what

[1:14:28] what is meant to
[1:14:30] be you know different people are coming
[1:14:34] they were asking him what shall we
[1:14:36] do and John was preaching the
[1:14:40] gospel he was preaching the gospel of
[1:14:44] repentance the baptism of
[1:14:47] repentance now when the Pharisees
[1:14:50] came and the scribes came they asked
[1:14:55] John who are
[1:14:58] you praise the name of and the Bible
[1:15:02] says they rejected the councel of
[1:15:05] God because they were not baptized of
[1:15:07] John the
[1:15:09] bapti and now when they come to the Lord
[1:15:11] Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ praise the name of our Lord let
[1:15:16] us go to
[1:15:18] Matthew okay maybe we leave that we just
[1:15:21] continue with
[1:15:22] Luke so when they come to Jesus chist
[1:15:26] they ask Jesus Christ the Pharisees and
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:31] scribes by what
[1:15:34] power do you do those
[1:15:39] things you know so they also rejected
[1:15:42] the councel
[1:15:44] of when Jesus Jesus now also asked
[1:15:48] them the baptism of John was it of men
[1:15:53] or was of God
[1:15:56] then they said ah wait a little then
[1:15:59] they go and say let us have a meeting
[1:16:01] here and then they get into a meeting
[1:16:04] then they say if we tell him of
[1:16:07] men there are many people
[1:16:10] here people know John was a prophet they
[1:16:13] will St
[1:16:15] us said what do we do when we tell him
[1:16:18] it's of God he will ask us why didn't
[1:16:21] you believe him say what do we do let us
[1:16:24] go back
[1:16:25] and tell him we don't
[1:16:28] know
[1:16:30] Pharisees and those religious Spirits
[1:16:32] are still
[1:16:35] there they don't want to acknowledge the
[1:16:38] truth but they want to debate with
[1:16:41] it find what is The Fault in it and then
[1:16:45] reject
[1:16:46] it now so now Jesus was telling these
[1:16:51] people when we continue in the Book of
[1:16:53] Luke
[1:16:56] praise the name of the Lord in verse
[1:17:00] 31 chter 7 verse 31 and the Lord said
[1:17:03] where then shall I liken men of this
[1:17:06] generation and what are they
[1:17:14] like they are like children sitting in
[1:17:18] the
[1:17:20] marketplace and calling one to another
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:26] saying we have piped unto
[1:17:30] you and you have not
[1:17:33] danc we have mourned unto
[1:17:36] you and you have not
[1:17:40] wept now you look at this
[1:17:43] scenario you get fellow
[1:17:46] children you know it's just like when
[1:17:48] the children
[1:17:50] meet and if there's maybe a field
[1:17:52] somewhere even if it's is not a big
[1:17:54] field
[1:17:56] one comes with a ball even if they don't
[1:17:59] have money to to buy a
[1:18:02] ball they will make one out of banana
[1:18:09] fibers and then they would do get maybe
[1:18:11] make one from
[1:18:13] poly and then blow
[1:18:16] inside praise the name of and nowadays
[1:18:19] there is a lot of
[1:18:21] policy so you can make men and make a
[1:18:24] good ball
[1:18:26] and get a rubber band and tie
[1:18:28] around and then you bounce
[1:18:31] it and then you get children playing
[1:18:34] together but now this is a scenario they
[1:18:37] go into the
[1:18:39] market and when they reach into the
[1:18:42] market they find their
[1:18:45] friends seated there in the
[1:18:48] market and start
[1:18:50] wondering so what they did they get
[1:18:53] pipes
[1:18:55] all they get jar and then start
[1:18:59] playing Amazing Grace house in the sound
[1:19:03] they start playing the other people
[1:19:05] don't get moved at
[1:19:07] all they just there then they start
[1:19:11] asking we thought he would Rejoice
[1:19:13] together with
[1:19:14] us said now maybe they are so
[1:19:17] sorrowful then they start
[1:19:21] mourning those they are not m
[1:19:24] and says this is the kind of generation
[1:19:26] that we are
[1:19:27] living in other words there's nothing
[1:19:30] that can attract
[1:19:32] someone to get into the Same
[1:19:35] Spirit of what is taking place so now
[1:19:39] the Bible has told
[1:19:41] us that if you obey the word of
[1:19:44] God you will find
[1:19:47] favor before God good
[1:19:51] understanding praise the name of our
[1:19:53] Lord we have another we can take up
[1:19:56] here in Genesis chter
[1:19:59] 4 praise the name of the Lord Genesis
[1:20:03] chter
[1:20:04] 4 and then we go to verse
[1:20:08] three and in the process of time it came
[1:20:12] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[1:20:14] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[1:20:25] and Abel he also brought of the
[1:20:28] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[1:20:31] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[1:20:34] Abel unto his
[1:20:45] offering but unto Kan and his offering
[1:20:48] he had no respect and Cain was Roth and
[1:20:51] his countenance fell
[1:21:03] now came to the same God that AB was
[1:21:10] worshiping came to the same God that
[1:21:13] Adam
[1:21:15] had but now how he
[1:21:18] came he brought the Bible says the first
[1:21:21] fruits of the ground
[1:21:25] you know he brought
[1:21:27] mango he brought you know fruits and
[1:21:30] different
[1:21:31] things he had the
[1:21:33] thinking that the original
[1:21:36] seene was a tree so he brought the mango
[1:21:40] different things like
[1:21:41] that just like the religious system of
[1:21:44] the
[1:21:46] day they think they ate the lital
[1:21:52] fruit so that's what Kan was is now
[1:21:57] propagating and then the Bible says but
[1:22:00] Abel brought the fings of
[1:22:05] his and then his
[1:22:09] sacrifice had the
[1:22:11] Revelation it was by the
[1:22:14] blood there was an exchange of
[1:22:18] blood from a wrong
[1:22:21] SE that brought sin and then the Bible
[1:22:25] says that God had
[1:22:29] respect you know
[1:22:31] Abels and even his
[1:22:34] offering God had
[1:22:37] respect AB even what Abel
[1:22:42] offered and now we need to look at
[1:22:45] this that for God to accept
[1:22:49] us what is the condition of your heart
[1:22:54] praise the name of our Lord what is the
[1:22:57] condition of your
[1:22:58] heart it doesn't matter how much
[1:23:01] sacrifice you can
[1:23:04] give it doesn't matter how much worship
[1:23:07] you can
[1:23:09] give it doesn't matter what you can
[1:23:13] offer but the issue is about your heart
[1:23:18] condition in Psalms
[1:23:21] 51 praise the name of the Lord
[1:23:25] 51 and then we read in
[1:23:29] verse
[1:23:32] 16 he says for desire not
[1:23:38] sacrifice brought the
[1:23:40] sacrifice but he rejected the sacrifice
[1:23:44] he rejected Cain
[1:23:46] himself then he said or else I would
[1:23:49] give it
[1:23:56] though Delight not in Bur
[1:24:06] offering then verse
[1:24:09] 17 the sacrifices of God are a
[1:24:13] broken
[1:24:17] Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh
[1:24:21] God you will not despise
[1:24:28] praise the name of our he says that one
[1:24:31] God you're not going to reject
[1:24:34] it if you have a broken
[1:24:37] heart if you have a broken and
[1:24:42] contrite and we see that was the
[1:24:46] condition of he had an evil
[1:24:50] heart so he was
[1:24:52] rejected even what was doing was
[1:24:56] rejected and so we know that when we are
[1:24:59] living before
[1:25:01] God make sure that your heart is not
[1:25:06] evil make sure that your
[1:25:09] heart is not kind of like a heart living
[1:25:12] in
[1:25:16] dishonesty you know and we see the
[1:25:18] generation that we're
[1:25:20] living people are too
[1:25:23] smart they can talk this but their heart
[1:25:26] is somewhere
[1:25:27] else they can do this but their heart is
[1:25:30] somewhere
[1:25:31] else like the Bible talks about a king
[1:25:34] in the scriptures
[1:25:36] here in the book of second
[1:25:39] chonicles praise the name of our Lord
[1:25:42] second
[1:25:44] chonicles and then verse 25 chapter 25
[1:25:50] rather verse one and verse two
[1:25:57] second
[1:26:02] chonicles 25
[1:26:05] verse1 it says Amia was 25 years old
[1:26:10] when he began to Reign and he reigned 2
[1:26:13] and9 years in Jerusalem and his mother's
[1:26:16] name was Johan of Jerusalem and he did
[1:26:19] that which was right in the sight of the
[1:26:21] Lord but not with a perfect heart
[1:26:50] so the Bible
[1:26:52] says that which was right in the sight
[1:26:55] of
[1:27:03] God I don't have anything I've done
[1:27:06] which is
[1:27:08] wrong like we can give the same
[1:27:11] testimony I always come to
[1:27:14] church is there a fault of coming to
[1:27:17] church no
[1:27:19] fault I always pay my
[1:27:22] tit I pay my
[1:27:25] offering I make sure that I do that
[1:27:27] which is
[1:27:29] right how about your
[1:27:32] heart praise the name of because that's
[1:27:34] where the problem
[1:27:36] is so Amia did which was
[1:27:40] right when you go to the
[1:27:43] law and you give a checklist of the
[1:27:48] law he said this one I have done I
[1:27:51] worship one
[1:27:52] God I don't name the name of the Lord in
[1:27:55] vain I obey my parents I don't steal I
[1:28:01] don't lie I don't commit a doubt you
[1:28:04] know I don't C
[1:28:07] anothers like the Rich
[1:28:09] Young he was doing that which was
[1:28:14] right even coming to the
[1:28:16] Lord what a great the Rich
[1:28:21] Young to meet the Lord himself
[1:28:25] and then he talked to him first to face
[1:28:27] the Bible says he
[1:28:30] ran and then when he met him he knelt
[1:28:34] down said good what shall I
[1:28:37] do can eternal life the Bible says Jesus
[1:28:42] loved
[1:28:43] him because he was doing
[1:28:46] right but now when the Lord told him go
[1:28:50] and sell all that you have
[1:28:54] that's where the
[1:28:55] problem his heart was not right with
[1:28:59] God and so we should also examine
[1:29:03] our what is my heart's
[1:29:06] condition
[1:29:08] Lord because your heart
[1:29:11] condition determines your
[1:29:15] destiny determines what's going to come
[1:29:19] next on the
[1:29:21] surface people can see a good person
[1:29:25] but what is inside the
[1:29:28] house praise the name of our Lord what
[1:29:30] is not inside the
[1:29:32] house so now we see
[1:29:36] that the lord gave him
[1:29:39] victory over his enemies
[1:29:42] around praise the name of the Lord go to
[1:29:45] verse
[1:29:46] 13 that same
[1:29:48] chapter so he went and fought
[1:29:52] battles and he destroyed his
[1:29:55] enemies praise the name of our Lord and
[1:29:58] then the problem
[1:30:01] came let us read that
[1:30:04] verse let us start from verse
[1:30:10] 12 and other 10,000 Left Alive did the
[1:30:13] children of Israel carry away captive
[1:30:15] and brought
[1:30:19] them un the Top of the Rock and cast
[1:30:21] them down from the top of the rock that
[1:30:24] they were broken in
[1:30:47] pieces but the soldiers of the army
[1:30:49] which amazia sent back that they should
[1:30:52] not go with him to the B
[1:30:54] fell upon the cities of Judah and
[1:30:56] Samaria and even bethon and smot 3,000
[1:31:00] of them and took much
[1:31:22] spoil and it came to pass that after
[1:31:25] amazia had come from Slaughter of the
[1:31:27] that he brought the gods of the
[1:31:30] children of sea and set them up for his
[1:31:32] gods and bought down himself before them
[1:31:36] and burned incense unto them
[1:31:58] now you see this
[1:32:00] St he was doing that which was right in
[1:32:03] the sight
[1:32:04] of God sent him to the
[1:32:07] battle and he fights the battle and is
[1:32:12] Victorious he destroys those people who
[1:32:14] are Idol
[1:32:16] worshipers but again he picks the idols
[1:32:19] of the people he has
[1:32:21] Ked and Tak them to his home and then he
[1:32:25] starts
[1:32:27] worshiping he did that which was
[1:32:30] right but not with a perfect heart so at
[1:32:33] the end of the
[1:32:35] day his unperfect
[1:32:39] heart him into idol
[1:32:42] worship so we need to see that we are
[1:32:46] careful praise the name of our Lord look
[1:32:49] at you know
[1:32:51] Saul look at Saul King SA
[1:32:55] you know God sent him to fight the
[1:32:58] Amit and now he doesn't do everything
[1:33:02] the Lord Has
[1:33:04] Told heally does What the Lord Has
[1:33:09] Told he never did the word of God with a
[1:33:12] perfect
[1:33:14] heart he never did the word of
[1:33:18] God a whole
[1:33:20] heart and then the Bible tells us that
[1:33:24] the greatest
[1:33:26] commandment is love the Lord your God
[1:33:29] with all your
[1:33:33] hearts all your
[1:33:35] mind with all your
[1:33:43] soul loved just
[1:33:47] halfway the rich loved God just halfway
[1:33:53] and now when they don't commit
[1:33:56] themselves entirely to
[1:33:59] God they give room to the
[1:34:03] enemy to take a hold of their
[1:34:06] lives praise the name of the Lord so
[1:34:10] went and worshiped the
[1:34:13] idols of the people that he had
[1:34:17] killed praise the name of our Lord and
[1:34:20] then the Bible says in second coric 25:1
[1:34:27] 15 wheree the anger of the Lord was
[1:34:30] kindled against amazia and he sent unto
[1:34:33] him a prophet which said unto him why
[1:34:37] have th sought after the gods of the
[1:34:39] people which could not deliver their own
[1:34:42] people out of thine hand
[1:35:02] why did you do such a foolish
[1:35:04] thing you killed these people but then
[1:35:07] you are picking their
[1:35:09] Idol to be your God and see that's where
[1:35:13] the devil gets a
[1:35:16] hold you know if you are not fully
[1:35:20] established in the word of God by the
[1:35:24] spirit of God another Force comes and
[1:35:27] takes you
[1:35:29] off praise the name of our so you need
[1:35:32] to see that you are
[1:35:35] grounded with all your
[1:35:38] heart praise the name of know what you
[1:35:41] have
[1:35:42] believed be strong on what you have
[1:35:46] believed don't have doubt on what you
[1:35:48] have
[1:35:50] beli don't give room to the devil
[1:35:54] to come and show you something
[1:35:56] different and you know the devil likes
[1:35:58] showing things that look
[1:36:00] nice you know brother Bram
[1:36:03] says Hollywood hwood
[1:36:07] shines so much glamour
[1:36:12] everything but the gospel
[1:36:17] blows you know like a light which is
[1:36:19] just small like this growing
[1:36:26] that's what the gospel
[1:36:28] is praise the name of no wonder elah was
[1:36:31] not moved by those heav
[1:36:35] things but it was still Small
[1:36:38] Voice gospel
[1:36:43] glowing praise the name of our now in
[1:36:46] the scriptures Proverbs Chapter 11
[1:37:00] 11 and then we can read
[1:37:04] from
[1:37:09] 18 he says the wicked worketh a
[1:37:12] deceitful work but to him that sth
[1:37:15] righteousness shall be a sure reward
[1:37:28] as righteousness tendeth to life so he
[1:37:31] that pursues evil pursues it to his own
[1:37:45] death they that are of FR heart are an
[1:37:48] Abomination to the Lord but such as are
[1:37:50] upright in their way are his
[1:38:13] Delight praise the name of the Lord so
[1:38:16] we need to
[1:38:17] see that our
[1:38:19] hearts are not
[1:38:22] fraud they are not
[1:38:24] evil praise the name of our see and
[1:38:28] examine your
[1:38:30] heart that it's not after things
[1:38:33] contrary to the word of
[1:38:35] God otherwise that will be your weak
[1:38:41] point and that weak point is your
[1:38:46] strength the devil will just come by the
[1:38:48] weak
[1:38:50] area and then he takes a hold of you
[1:38:54] praise the name of our let us read verse
[1:38:56] three of Proverbs
[1:39:00] 11 he says the Integrity of the upright
[1:39:04] shall guide them but the perverseness of
[1:39:07] transgressors shall
[1:39:20] destroy and you see all these are
[1:39:23] condition of the
[1:39:25] heart he says if you have integrity as
[1:39:28] an upright
[1:39:32] person that Integrity in your
[1:39:35] heart will guide you even in challenging
[1:39:40] times will challenge you when
[1:39:43] Temptations
[1:39:45] come because your heart condition you
[1:39:48] not look at things the way they
[1:39:52] appear you will go further before that
[1:39:55] thing you find out what exactly is
[1:40:00] this what is behind this
[1:40:03] thing what is the motive of this
[1:40:07] thing what are the objectives
[1:40:10] of so you're not going to fall for
[1:40:17] anything because you see everybody is
[1:40:20] running there they are also running
[1:40:22] there
[1:40:24] where is your
[1:40:26] integrity where is your perfectness of
[1:40:29] the
[1:40:30] heart praise the name of the Lord and
[1:40:33] then the Bible says the perverseness of
[1:40:37] transgressors we still reading in
[1:40:42] verse the wickedness that they
[1:40:46] have the one that leads them to
[1:40:50] destruction and that's what the
[1:40:52] scripture is telling us
[1:40:54] praise the name of our Lord and then in
[1:40:57] verse
[1:40:58] five the righteousness of the perfect
[1:41:01] shall direct his
[1:41:07] way your
[1:41:09] righteousness your heart condition the
[1:41:13] Bible says shall direct
[1:41:17] you in your way see Joseph in P's house
[1:41:24] his
[1:41:26] righteousness his
[1:41:28] Integrity could not allow
[1:41:32] him by the naked's
[1:41:38] wife do such a
[1:41:41] thing said we are only alone in the
[1:41:45] house and then every day she would
[1:41:48] undress
[1:41:50] herself until this time she said that
[1:41:55] she's the one who went to take a hold of
[1:41:57] him and then he pulled out the clothes
[1:41:59] and took
[1:42:01] off these are
[1:42:04] powers evil
[1:42:06] powers and now these evil Powers when
[1:42:09] they come to
[1:42:11] attack what would they find in your
[1:42:14] heart if they find in your
[1:42:16] heart there is no good man of the
[1:42:21] house which is your faith in the world
[1:42:25] you will fall by
[1:42:27] that you will
[1:42:29] fall but Joseph was able to resist
[1:42:34] that and so the Bible says the
[1:42:37] righteousness of the
[1:42:39] upright shall deliver
[1:42:42] them but the
[1:42:46] transgressors shall be taken in their
[1:42:49] own
[1:42:50] nness six now
[1:42:58] so the Bible says in verse six the
[1:43:01] rightousness of the upright shall
[1:43:03] deliver
[1:43:05] them but the
[1:43:08] transgressors shall be taken in their
[1:43:11] own
[1:43:18] nness praise the name of
[1:43:21] our heart
[1:43:24] you know a heart which doesn't desire
[1:43:26] others to have
[1:43:28] good so you go to a
[1:43:31] place and you are like
[1:43:37] H hmon had
[1:43:41] a you know he woke
[1:43:43] up in the
[1:43:46] night when
[1:43:49] mod in the course of the day refused to
[1:43:52] OB oy
[1:43:54] him then the wife said that man you need
[1:43:57] put him on a
[1:44:01] g so he made the girl very
[1:44:05] high that everybody would
[1:44:15] sit very
[1:44:17] high and after making it because he was
[1:44:20] able to make it at night so he in the
[1:44:23] morning to the
[1:44:25] king and he want to seek the favor of
[1:44:27] the
[1:44:29] king and now the king in the night was
[1:44:34] troubled and then he went and got the
[1:44:36] book of
[1:44:38] Chronicles and read about mod how he
[1:44:41] saved his
[1:44:43] life and then he asked the servants what
[1:44:46] have we done
[1:44:48] to they said we have done
[1:44:51] nothing said ah
[1:44:53] now early in the morning the king said
[1:44:57] who is
[1:44:58] there and and her man had gone to seek
[1:45:01] for Mod's
[1:45:05] life the wickedness in
[1:45:08] his made him make
[1:45:12] a what a tower to
[1:45:17] kill not knowing that he's going to fall
[1:45:19] by
[1:45:21] that so the says when the King was
[1:45:25] talking to
[1:45:28] mod what shall we do for a man who the
[1:45:30] king Delight what shall we do for a man
[1:45:33] who the king Delights to
[1:45:36] please and H thought it is
[1:45:46] me so he
[1:45:49] said this man was lasting for the throne
[1:45:51] of the king
[1:45:55] we put him on the king's White
[1:45:58] Horse we dress him like a
[1:46:01] king he get the most honorable Prince
[1:46:06] around and then he walks in the the
[1:46:09] city on Main
[1:46:12] Street and then tell
[1:46:18] people the king is pleased with this one
[1:46:21] and then the king told
[1:46:23] H go and do that
[1:46:28] to don't
[1:46:31] fail now you see how his fall started
[1:46:35] coming so the King goes the H gets
[1:46:40] everything he had talked
[1:46:43] about and gets sit on the on the of the
[1:46:48] king and started declaring this is the
[1:46:51] man the king is H
[1:46:53] man man the king
[1:46:56] is he left that place
[1:46:59] embarrassed covering his
[1:47:01] face going home then the wife told him
[1:47:06] if you have started falling before this
[1:47:07] I called the
[1:47:10] Jew sure going to fall when he was still
[1:47:14] there The Messengers come the king is
[1:47:17] calling you to the B of
[1:47:23] and now when they reach the banquet of
[1:47:25] Esther and the king is kind of you know
[1:47:28] having a heavy
[1:47:30] heart he wants to know what does Esther
[1:47:33] want of
[1:47:35] me
[1:47:36] declares we have been
[1:47:39] sold we have been given
[1:47:41] over to be
[1:47:44] destroyed young and
[1:47:46] old
[1:47:48] everything then the King was who is this
[1:47:54] and then she said this hmon
[1:47:59] here from there was put on his
[1:48:03] Galls so the Bible has
[1:48:06] said praise the name of our in verse six
[1:48:11] but the
[1:48:12] transgressors shall be taken in their
[1:48:15] own
[1:48:20] nness praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:48:23] need to see that our heart condition is
[1:48:26] upright before
[1:48:30] God praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:48:32] go back to Genesis chter
[1:48:36] 4 and then verse
[1:48:39] 6 and the Lord said unto Cain why art th
[1:48:43] Ro and why is thy continence Fallen
[1:48:57] if you do well shall you not be accepted
[1:49:00] and if you do not well sin lies at the
[1:49:04] door and unto thee shall be his desire
[1:49:06] and th shall rule over him
[1:49:24] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[1:49:26] if you do
[1:49:29] well you will be
[1:49:32] accepted praise the name of our Lord and
[1:49:35] we need to see that from the bottom of
[1:49:37] our
[1:49:39] heart we are
[1:49:41] sincere we are genuine in whatever thing
[1:49:44] we are
[1:49:45] doing we are not looking for vain
[1:49:50] Glory we are not looking for being above
[1:49:54] others but we are looking to serve the
[1:49:58] Lord we are seeking to do the will of
[1:50:00] the
[1:50:02] Lord something that is acceptable of the
[1:50:06] Lord the name of our
[1:50:08] Lord did what that which was wrong but
[1:50:12] the lord gave him an
[1:50:14] opportunity do right think right act
[1:50:19] right Bram says that is our duty to
[1:50:24] God think right do right praise the name
[1:50:28] of you know your
[1:50:30] thoughts let them be acceptable
[1:50:34] before in in their
[1:50:36] heart let it be acceptable
[1:50:39] before don't things like men
[1:50:44] Pleasers you know at place of work what
[1:50:47] you are doing is just to please
[1:50:49] men but then your heart is not in what
[1:50:52] you
[1:50:54] you end up doing something
[1:50:57] wrong your judgment will become
[1:51:00] wrong because a challenge will come and
[1:51:04] then will try to find
[1:51:05] out why would he do this kind of thing
[1:51:09] why this kind of
[1:51:10] thing so the unperfect
[1:51:14] heart will make you make a wrong
[1:51:18] decision your unperfect heart will make
[1:51:21] you make a wrong
[1:51:24] choice praise the name of our Lord but
[1:51:27] now if your heart is
[1:51:29] perfect you will be actually
[1:51:33] inspired to make the right
[1:51:36] decision because the Lord has been
[1:51:39] gracious because you have found favor
[1:51:42] with the
[1:51:44] Lord because it is God who knows the end
[1:51:47] from the
[1:51:48] beginning he knows what is going to
[1:51:50] happen next
[1:51:52] now when the Lord when you find favor
[1:51:55] before
[1:51:56] God you always do the will of
[1:52:00] God but now how can you find fav before
[1:52:04] God let your heart be right before
[1:52:08] God praise the name of our Lord let your
[1:52:11] right be
[1:52:14] acceptable praise the name of our Lord
[1:52:16] the Bible says in Acts
[1:52:20] 10 and verse 34
[1:52:26] 10 and
[1:52:30] verse4 the scripture says then Peter
[1:52:34] opened his mouth and said of truth I
[1:52:37] perceive that God is a respector of no
[1:52:42] persons Acts 10:34
[1:52:55] praise the name of the Lord he says God
[1:52:59] is a respector of no
[1:53:03] person but in every
[1:53:06] nation he that fear
[1:53:09] Him and work
[1:53:12] righteous is acceptable with
[1:53:15] him we want find favor with God how can
[1:53:19] I find favor with God
[1:53:22] when I hear the word of God let me obey
[1:53:26] the word of
[1:53:27] God let me be you know following the
[1:53:30] word of
[1:53:32] God he says he that fears
[1:53:35] God and work
[1:53:38] righte in other words to the best of
[1:53:41] your
[1:53:43] knowledge you are doing what is
[1:53:47] right praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:53:50] get back to our Liv
[1:53:53] the things that you do the decisions
[1:53:56] that you make is that the best to your
[1:54:02] knowledge praise the name of our husband
[1:54:05] and
[1:54:06] wife the decisions you make the way you
[1:54:10] treat one another is that the best to
[1:54:13] your
[1:54:16] knowledge praise the name of our your
[1:54:19] children how you handle them the best to
[1:54:23] your
[1:54:25] knowledge or you are doing
[1:54:27] something to just say let me do because
[1:54:29] I'm meant to
[1:54:32] do and not with a perfect
[1:54:35] heart your heart is not
[1:54:38] complet like
[1:54:42] David
[1:54:45] halfheart allowed AB to
[1:54:48] come but he said you know he said he can
[1:54:52] come from those
[1:54:54] countries but you not come to
[1:54:57] Jerusalem
[1:54:59] halfed it brought a problem to the
[1:55:03] kingdom and sometimes there are also
[1:55:06] things we do which are meant to be
[1:55:10] right but not with the whole
[1:55:14] heart it becomes a
[1:55:16] problem you know you are taking
[1:55:19] right but then there is wrong you also
[1:55:21] accepting with
[1:55:23] it so you are getting a
[1:55:27] hybrid becomes a
[1:55:30] problem and it became a problem to
[1:55:33] David but the Bible is telling us if we
[1:55:37] do
[1:55:39] right praise the name of the Lord it
[1:55:41] shall be
[1:55:44] acceptable before God let us go to the
[1:55:47] Book of Ruth chapter
[1:55:49] one praise the name of the Lord Ruth
[1:55:53] chapter
[1:55:56] 1 and then we read
[1:56:01] in read in verse let me get the verse
[1:56:08] here Luke L chapter
[1:56:13] 1 and then we go to verse
[1:56:17] 7 wherefore she went forth out of the
[1:56:21] place where she was
[1:56:22] and her two daughters in-law with her
[1:56:25] and they went on the way to return unto
[1:56:27] the land of
[1:56:40] Judah now you see that
[1:56:44] Naomi had two daughters
[1:56:49] inw you know he had one Ruth
[1:56:53] and the other
[1:56:56] Opera Opera the husbands had
[1:57:01] died and now to go back to
[1:57:07] Judah and then he was moving with the
[1:57:09] two
[1:57:10] daughters and then he reached along the
[1:57:13] way and put them to a
[1:57:16] test praise the name of our Lord Andi
[1:57:19] said unto her two daughters in the
[1:57:22] go return each to her mother's house and
[1:57:25] the Lord deal kindly with you as you
[1:57:28] have dealt with the dead and with me
[1:57:59] the Lord grant you that you find rest
[1:58:01] each of you in the house of her husband
[1:58:03] then she kissed them and they lifted up
[1:58:06] their voice and wept
[1:58:26] and said return unto your
[1:58:39] people and say turn again my daughters
[1:58:42] why will you go with me are there yet
[1:58:45] any more sons in my womb that they may
[1:58:48] be your husbands
[1:59:03] you know she started explaining to them
[1:59:05] one thing after
[1:59:08] another said you go
[1:59:10] back now D said we are going with you
[1:59:14] then she says I'm no longer going to
[1:59:17] Mar even if I married and give birth to
[1:59:19] a son
[1:59:22] for to marry that
[1:59:24] son and then Opera said let me go
[1:59:27] back I'm now
[1:59:30] free but then the Bible says Ruth
[1:59:35] cled in other words Opera was doing it
[1:59:38] with a half
[1:59:40] heart now when she saw she's going
[1:59:42] there's no physical
[1:59:47] benefit this is my
[1:59:50] opportunity she went back
[1:59:52] but now when Ruth left to
[1:59:57] Naomi she went with Naomi into the land
[2:00:00] of
[2:00:03] Bethlehem and she was a virtuous
[2:00:07] woman and now because she desired
[2:00:11] Naomi and she said your God will be my
[2:00:16] God where I will die I
[2:00:19] die left toomi
[2:00:23] the Bible says Naomi told
[2:00:27] Ruth go into the Harvest and get some
[2:00:31] food to do some work and then you see
[2:00:34] the goodness of
[2:00:36] God that Ruth was divinely
[2:00:41] inspired to go into the garden of
[2:00:46] B praise the name of our and now when
[2:00:49] she came back from the Harvest
[2:00:52] with what she was given and then she
[2:00:54] came to Naomi and then Naomi was asking
[2:00:57] her where have you gone today she said I
[2:01:01] went into the garden of
[2:01:04] boas theni said blessed be the
[2:01:08] Lord has led you to that F because for
[2:01:12] us is our K
[2:01:15] red praise the name of our Lord and
[2:01:17] there are so many things God allows in
[2:01:19] our
[2:01:20] lives that permits a circumstance to
[2:01:24] happen but this circumstance
[2:01:27] happening is leading you to your
[2:01:30] Victory is leading you to your
[2:01:33] deliverance is leading you to something
[2:01:35] you least
[2:01:37] expected praise the name of our so we
[2:01:40] need to see that we have an upright
[2:01:43] heart we have a
[2:01:45] heart that fears God the Lord himself
[2:01:49] will guide us
[2:01:52] challenges at the place
[2:01:53] of you stand upright the Lord knows what
[2:01:57] he will do in those
[2:01:59] challenges praise the name of our Lord
[2:02:01] like now we see the world in its
[2:02:04] confusion the Bible say the footsteps of
[2:02:07] the
[2:02:08] righteous they are ordered of the
[2:02:11] Lord praise the name of then the Bible
[2:02:14] says commit all thy ways unto the
[2:02:18] Lord then he will direct your p
[2:02:23] praise the name of our Lord on the
[2:02:26] surface people may despise that
[2:02:28] thing God has hidden something behind
[2:02:32] it that he will guide you to
[2:02:36] that and then when you get into that
[2:02:39] after some time the on who despised it
[2:02:43] will find I wish had made that
[2:02:46] decision and that's how Ruth was so she
[2:02:50] found favor before
[2:02:54] until now she was
[2:02:57] redeemed became her
[2:03:00] husband and she found
[2:03:02] peace praise the name of the Lord so we
[2:03:05] need to see that we find favor before
[2:03:09] God praise the name of our Lord Noah in
[2:03:12] his days when it was all
[2:03:16] evil when it was all
[2:03:19] Wicked people are doing all the evil
[2:03:21] things they want to
[2:03:23] do like the time we are living in the
[2:03:26] world is so wicked the world is so
[2:03:29] immoral we need to find favor before
[2:03:33] God so in Genesis
[2:03:35] 6 and then verse
[2:03:38] 5 and God saw the wickedness of man was
[2:03:41] great in the earth and that every
[2:03:44] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[2:03:46] was only evil continually
[2:04:12] and it he repented the Lord that he had
[2:04:14] made man on Earth and it grieved him at
[2:04:17] his heart
[2:04:23] praise the name of the Lord and the Lord
[2:04:26] said I will destroy man whom I have
[2:04:28] created from the face of the Earth both
[2:04:31] man and Beast and the creeping thing and
[2:04:34] the Falls of the air for it repenteth me
[2:04:36] that I have made them but Noah found
[2:04:39] Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[2:04:58] praise the name of Lord the Bible says
[2:05:01] Noah was a just man in his
[2:05:05] generation what is our
[2:05:07] condition where we work where we live
[2:05:12] what is our heart
[2:05:14] condition prise the name of look at
[2:05:17] Simeon the Bible says Simeon was a just
[2:05:21] devote
[2:05:23] man and then he was looking for the
[2:05:26] promises of the
[2:05:27] Lord so every day said Lord thank you
[2:05:32] for this new day I want to see your
[2:05:37] Redemption and then the Bible says that
[2:05:39] the Holy Ghost was upon
[2:05:42] Simon and when the Holy Ghost was upon
[2:05:45] Simon the Holy Spirit revealed to
[2:05:49] Simeon that he will not
[2:05:52] die until he sees the Lord is
[2:05:55] Christ now God has given us the promise
[2:05:59] of our day and the promise of our day is
[2:06:04] the change of our bodies the promise of
[2:06:06] our day is a
[2:06:08] rupture praise the name of our Lord and
[2:06:11] the Lord who has given us that promise
[2:06:14] he has come down to us in his word when
[2:06:19] we believe the word of God obey the word
[2:06:22] of God the Holy Spirit comes so when you
[2:06:26] have the spirit of God that same spirit

[2:06:37] promise praise the name of our Lord we
[2:06:40] are partakers of the Divine
[2:06:42] prise Praise the name of our Lord now
[2:06:45] you may start asking how am I sure that
[2:06:49] I'm going to be in the rupture how am I
[2:06:52] sure that my body is going to be changed
[2:06:55] the assurance that I have is that I have
[2:06:58] the life of Jesus Christ praise the name
[2:07:01] of our I have the life of Jesus Christ

[2:07:19] us with his holy spirit it is an
[2:07:22] assurance that we have like Simeon the
[2:07:26] spirit was upon Him Praise the name of
[2:07:29] our and the spirit that was upon
[2:07:31] Simeon when Christ was born that same
[2:07:35] Spirit Led
[2:07:37] Simeon where Jesus was praise the name
[2:07:41] of our Lord there were hundreds of
[2:07:42] babies who had come for
[2:07:45] circumcision and the babies almost look
[2:07:49] alike and those Jews dress alike

[2:08:24] had the Virgin
[2:08:27] birth he didn't do that but the Holy
[2:08:31] Spirit led him to
[2:08:35] exactly the and we also have the Holy
[2:08:39] Spirit that the Holy

[2:15:12] decision of many
[2:15:15] years within one month two months three
[2:15:20] months to bind yourself to somebody for
[2:15:22] the rest of your
[2:15:25] life whom you even don't
[2:15:28] know you don't know why he left the

[2:15:44] good that brother is so
[2:15:46] nice oh that brother is good sister that
[2:15:50] sister is good

[2:16:14] in has come to you find out what is
[2:16:18] behind yeah
[2:16:21] what is there behind
[2:16:23] there because some people are not
[2:16:25] sincere to declare who they
[2:16:28] are they not
[2:16:30] sincere you fall this one I think
[2:16:33] everything will be
[2:16:36] okay and now when you start living
[2:16:39] together you start
[2:16:42] discovering and your spirit becomes
[2:16:45] low because you made the wrong
[2:16:48] decision so the Bible says
[2:16:51] people's thoughts are evil
[2:16:57] continually
[2:16:58] evil and there are some people who are
[2:17:07] real just like
[2:17:10] spies you know spy can come and live in
[2:17:12] your house and you don't
[2:17:15] know either
[2:17:18] housekeeper have sent him to pick
[2:17:23] is a
[2:17:24] house to find out what you like they
[2:17:27] take their
[2:17:29] time until they get their
[2:17:33] catch but when you are living upright
[2:17:36] before
[2:17:38] God he will reveal this kind of f
[2:17:41] Spirit that's what the Lord does
[2:17:45] Sons he
[2:17:48] exposes praise the name of the Lord May
[2:17:51] pretend to be
[2:17:53] good but they can't hide when the spirit
[2:17:56] of God
[2:17:59] comes and finally the right thing will
[2:18:01] come
[2:18:04] out he says only one
[2:18:10] statement only one word troubles
[2:18:13] you why has that one say that but then
[2:18:17] it comes back and then you pray to God
[2:18:21] then he
[2:18:22] says that small word is a big package to
[2:18:25] evil
[2:18:29] things
[2:18:31] exposes so we need to see that we live
[2:18:34] with an upright
[2:18:36] heart praise the name of our and that's
[2:18:39] how Noah lived in
[2:18:41] his until God was saying why have I
[2:18:44] created
[2:18:46] man and then God said I'm going to
[2:18:49] destroy the man that I've have created
[2:18:53] from the face of the
[2:18:54] Earth both man and
[2:18:57] Beast and
[2:18:59] theing and the Falls of the air which me
[2:19:02] why I have made
[2:19:04] them but
[2:19:06] Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[2:19:10] Lord praise the name of and we have also
[2:19:13] found Grace in the
[2:19:16] eyes God has sent us a
[2:19:18] message praise the name of
[2:19:21] let us live the message of the
[2:19:24] hour while people are just you know
[2:19:27] living in
[2:19:32] hunger we have a message from the
[2:19:36] Lord God has revealed to us the
[2:19:39] message praise the name of our Lord that
[2:19:42] when people don't have what to
[2:19:45] eat God has given us food spiritual food
[2:19:49] in this season
[2:19:51] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[2:19:53] message God keeps his
[2:19:55] word brother Bram says in paragraph
[2:19:59] 29
[2:20:01] oh
[2:20:03] oh what started in the
[2:20:10] C it was hungry
[2:20:15] children trying to find something to eat
[2:20:22] now you see when people are
[2:20:25] hungry they can even eat
[2:20:29] anything and then he says and if you a
[2:20:33] bunch of preachers w't give them the
[2:20:36] gospel they will eat out of aage
[2:20:51] then he says they will eat out of a
[2:20:54] garbage
[2:20:55] can that is
[2:20:58] right I lay it on you
[2:21:02] preachers that's right if you won't give
[2:21:05] the children the bread of
[2:21:09] life they will take some kind of a scam
[2:21:12] out of a garbage
[2:21:17] can that's what's happening
[2:21:20] that is what is
[2:21:23] happening praise the name of the Lord
[2:21:25] where you know church has put the word
[2:21:27] of God
[2:21:29] aside and then they are busy on fun
[2:21:35] things
[2:21:45] temporary here
[2:21:49] garbage when you have
[2:21:51] God you have everything you
[2:21:54] need but then how will you have that
[2:21:58] God if you are living in
[2:22:01] wickedness no doesn't work out praise
[2:22:05] the name of our Lord so when people are
[2:22:08] hungry that they even eat dir
[2:22:11] things they even believe false
[2:22:15] Doctrine and the Bible says like J and
[2:22:19] James
[2:22:23] corrupt
[2:22:26] mind
[2:22:35] reprobates we are living in the days of
[2:22:38] Noah until even you get homosexuals also
[2:22:44] preaching and they ordaining their
[2:22:48] ministers yeah they're eating from that
[2:22:51] and they promote their
[2:22:54] stuff praise the name of our Lord and
[2:22:56] you know many things have come up in the
[2:22:58] time we are
[2:23:00] living and now when the word of God is
[2:23:03] taken away from
[2:23:06] people their lives become
[2:23:10] Wicked they become
[2:23:12] evil they rebel against
[2:23:16] God they cannot have faith in the sound
[2:23:19] Doctrine
[2:23:22] and somebody want to
[2:23:24] think if I don't get
[2:23:27] excited if I don't get
[2:23:30] emotional I don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:23:33] that's not sound
[2:23:35] doctr praise the name of our Lord so
[2:23:38] somebody wants to roll how many
[2:23:41] times now I have the Holy Ghost that's
[2:23:44] not the proof is the life of Jesus
[2:23:48] Christ and then you see that there
[2:23:50] Spirit of
[2:23:55] emotionalism if you want
[2:23:59] bitter you go
[2:24:01] there
[2:24:04] bitterness praise the name of the Lord
[2:24:06] you know you find that the
[2:24:09] devil gets into
[2:24:12] something and then somebody wants to go
[2:24:14] by that
[2:24:15] thing and then you said the other
[2:24:17] doesn't have the Holy
[2:24:19] Spirit but that's not the way of
[2:24:22] God when you receive the word of God and
[2:24:25] you obey the word of God then the spirit
[2:24:28] of God
[2:24:29] comes you don't look for
[2:24:32] emotions you don't look how much I've
[2:24:34] jumped
[2:24:39] around be built on the solid word of
[2:24:43] God pra the name of our Lord and see the
[2:24:46] challenges that Noah
[2:24:48] had but then you bring in the days of
[2:24:50] lot and you know
[2:24:53] Sodom we are living in the same
[2:24:56] days that there's a lot of Darkness
[2:25:00] around there's a lot of wickedness going
[2:25:04] on until it has to take the message that
[2:25:07] God has given unto
[2:25:10] us to discern the spirits of the
[2:25:14] time because the devil is always
[2:25:17] attacking is always coming praise the
[2:25:21] name of our then how do we find favor
[2:25:23] with
[2:25:24] God God has sent us a
[2:25:27] message take the message of God and
[2:25:31] believe it with all your
[2:25:32] heart when you obey the word of God you
[2:25:36] find favor before God that while the
[2:25:39] storms are
[2:25:40] passing God keeps you standing
[2:25:43] strong praise the name of our Lord in
[2:25:46] Genesis chter
[2:25:48] 18 praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[2:25:52] says in verse
[2:25:53] one and the Lord appeared unto him in
[2:25:56] the plains of
[2:25:57] memory and he as he sat in the tent Door
[2:26:01] In the Heat of the day and he lift up
[2:26:03] his eyes and looked and lo three men
[2:26:06] stood by and when he saw them he ran to
[2:26:09] meet them from the tent door and bought
[2:26:11] himself toward the ground
[2:26:37] and said my Lord if now I have found
[2:26:39] favor in thy s pass not away I pray thee
[2:26:43] from thy servant let a little water I
[2:26:46] pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[2:26:49] and Dr your
[2:26:50] under the
[2:27:09] tree praise the name of our Lord Abraham
[2:27:13] found favor before
[2:27:16] God until God had Abraham
[2:27:21] and God did according to what
[2:27:25] Abed praise the name of our Lord we need
[2:27:27] to have that kind of personal
[2:27:29] relationship with God until you were
[2:27:32] before the Lord I said Lord all this all
[2:27:36] Lord this all Lord this and then the
[2:27:39] Lord says what you have said I'm going
[2:27:42] to do praise the name of the Lord like
[2:27:45] the children in the
[2:27:48] marketplace they were just they are
[2:27:50] seated and then their friends come to
[2:27:53] them they
[2:27:55] pipe they never responded then these
[2:27:58] ones want to take their attention they
[2:28:01] start mourning they never respond but
[2:28:04] now when we hear the word of God we need
[2:28:07] to respond to the word of God by acting
[2:28:11] it and say Lord I believe that Lord
[2:28:14] receive that that is mine praise the
[2:28:17] name of our Lord and then you get that
[2:28:19] favor of
[2:28:21] God when brother Bram was giving a
[2:28:25] testimony about the creation of the
[2:28:28] squirel and then sister
[2:28:32] said that is the
[2:28:34] truth it brought down the Holy Spirit
[2:28:38] the Holy Ghost say what do you want God
[2:28:41] to
[2:28:42] do that is Finding Forever
[2:28:45] before praise the name of Lord where the
[2:28:47] Lord will ask
[2:28:49] you want me to do for
[2:28:51] you praise the name of the Lord we need
[2:28:53] to find
[2:28:55] favor and you know Finding favor means
[2:28:59] that your heart is given to the Lord and
[2:29:03] you are willing to receive from the when
[2:29:06] you're willing to receive from the Lord
[2:29:09] the Lord asks you what shall I do for
[2:29:12] you praise the name of our Lord and then
[2:29:15] the Lord after communing with Abraham
[2:29:20] giving him his
[2:29:21] promises and says it will come to pass
[2:29:24] in the time of life Sarah will
[2:29:27] conceive then Sarah was
[2:29:30] laughing in the heart say why did Sarah
[2:29:34] laugh and then Sarah said I
[2:29:37] didn't lying in the presence of God but
[2:29:40] the grace of God came down praise the
[2:29:43] name of our Lord not to destroy her
[2:29:46] praise the name of our Lord and then
[2:29:47] when God had finish communion
[2:29:50] he was walking Abraham was walking with
[2:29:53] God and the two
[2:29:55] angels and then the angels went forward
[2:29:57] to
[2:29:58] Sodom Abraham started talking with the
[2:30:01] Lord and then the Lord told
[2:30:04] Abraham I have come to see what is in
[2:30:07] Sodom God revealing his
[2:30:11] secret to them that fear
[2:30:14] Him Praise the name of our if you fear
[2:30:17] God God will reveal to you his
[2:30:21] SEC that's what the Bible says in verse
[2:30:25] 18 praise the name of our
[2:30:27] Lord Genesis 18
[2:30:32] ver8 the scripture
[2:30:36] says let us start from verse 17 and the
[2:30:39] Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that
[2:30:42] thing which I
[2:30:48] do seeing that Abraham shall surely
[2:30:52] become a great and mighty nation and all
[2:30:55] the nations of the Earth shall be
[2:30:57] blessed
[2:31:06] of for I know him that will command his
[2:31:11] children and his household after him and
[2:31:14] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[2:31:16] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[2:31:19] May bring upon Abraham that which he has
[2:31:22] spoken of
[2:31:41] Hima the name of Lord God had promised
[2:31:45] Abraham but the word of God to be
[2:31:48] fulfilled
[2:31:50] Abraham had to fear
[2:31:53] God Abraham had to keep the word of
[2:31:57] God same thing also with us what does
[2:32:00] the word of God say in the
[2:32:02] SC and then you seek the counsel of
[2:32:05] God you do according to the will of
[2:32:09] God see the Lord perform
[2:32:12] his praise the name of so whatever God
[2:32:15] spoke of
[2:32:17] Abraham praise the name of our Lord
[2:32:20] obeyed it and the scripture say when God
[2:32:24] told
[2:32:25] Abraham that your seed is just like the
[2:32:31] sky you know
[2:32:33] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[2:32:37] unto
[2:32:38] him for
[2:32:40] righte it's the same thing with us we've
[2:32:43] had the gospel of Jes we had the message
[2:32:46] of the
[2:32:47] hour take it receive it obey it and when
[2:32:53] you obey it that is
[2:32:55] righteousness praise the name of our

[2:33:48] not enough
[2:33:51] reached 10 they are not even
[2:33:53] 10 and the Bible says when God went to
[2:33:57] destroy s
[2:33:59] and God remembered
[2:34:03] Abraham and when God remembered
[2:34:06] Abraham he
[2:34:08] [Music]

[2:37:10] with the Lord Our God to walk in his

[2:40:35] thereof is the Lord
[2:40:37] is your body is the Lord is your life is
[2:40:42] the Lord even your portion of land
[2:40:50] the even the materials you using to
[2:40:53] build is the
[2:40:55] L you don't have anything of your

[2:41:34] life because you are there to serve
[2:41:38] him praise the name of our Lord we have
[2:41:41] all been
[2:41:42] created the Bible says for his
[2:41:46] pleasure for his glory
[2:41:49] were are
[2:41:50] created so we go to the
[2:41:54] Creator that's what brother Bram says
[2:41:57] you need to go back to
[2:41:59] God and ask
[2:42:02] God why have you created
[2:42:05] me Lord I'm
[2:42:07] here why have you created me and then
[2:42:11] you ask him and then God
[2:42:15] himself he will give you an
[2:42:17] answer I created you for
[2:42:20] this I I made you for
[2:42:24] this in the message God doesn't call man
[2:42:26] to judgment without first warning
[2:42:30] him brother Bram says and now we find
[2:42:33] out that his nature
[2:42:38] was let me jump there say he always
[2:42:42] gives
[2:42:43] warning a reminder to
[2:42:46] we a responsibility
[2:42:49] we are
[2:42:53] responsible and
[2:42:56] God has put us here on
[2:42:59] Earth for a
[2:43:01] reason and that reason that he has put
[2:43:05] us here
[2:43:08] for we are responsible to
[2:43:11] him for that reason you should go to him
[2:43:16] and find out what he wants you to
[2:43:21] do praise the name of the Lord he has
[2:43:24] kept you up this
[2:43:26] time seek the Lord you have raised me
[2:43:30] this
[2:43:31] far you have made me reach this
[2:43:34] age what would you want me to
[2:43:37] do words you are seeking the will of
[2:43:41] God you want to make sure you are found
[2:43:45] doing that which is
[2:43:47] right and accept before
[2:43:50] the so David was telling
[2:43:53] Solomon seek the
[2:43:55] Lord and seeking the Lord is
[2:44:01] continu if you have S him today and
[2:44:05] elected you what you are going to do how
[2:44:09] you going to do it even tomorrow do the
[2:44:12] same you are seeking him you want to
[2:44:15] know the mind of God
[2:44:19] of God and the more you seek Him the
[2:44:23] more you find favor before
[2:44:25] him until he can give a
[2:44:28] testimony God gives a
[2:44:30] testimony that there is nobody like so
[2:44:33] and
[2:44:34] so he has always sought me to find out
[2:44:39] what is my will in this
[2:44:41] issue what does the Lord desire me to do
[2:44:43] in
[2:44:44] this praise the name of the Lord now let
[2:44:47] us go to
[2:44:50] to First Kings chapter 11 as I try to
[2:44:56] finish First Kings 11
[2:45:02] verse4 the scripture
[2:45:06] says now
[2:45:08] Solomon when he got
[2:45:11] older First Kings 11:4 for it came to
[2:45:15] pass when Solomon was old that his wife
[2:45:18] stand away his heart after other gods
[2:45:22] and his heart was not perfect with the
[2:45:24] Lord his God as was the that of his
[2:45:27] father
[2:45:47] David the Bible says
[2:45:50] for Solomon went after ath the goddess
[2:45:52] of the zidonians after milon the
[2:45:54] abomination of amorites and Solomon did
[2:45:57] evil in the sight of the Lord and went
[2:46:00] not fully after the Lord as David his
[2:46:03] father
[2:46:31] praise the name of our Lord so
[2:46:33] Solomon turned away from the way of the
[2:46:37] Lord by his wife from strange
[2:46:41] lands and the Bible says he never
[2:46:45] followed with a full heart
[2:46:49] you know obeying the word of God so he
[2:46:52] go toing this
[2:46:55] idoling the other
[2:46:57] iding other
[2:46:58] ID you know the wife stand away from the
[2:47:03] Lord praise the name of so then it
[2:47:06] became a problem in his
[2:47:09] kingdom until when reob was a
[2:47:15] son was King
[2:47:19] the kingdom was
[2:47:21] divided praise the name of our Lord his
[2:47:23] kingdom was
[2:47:25] divided so now we need to see that we
[2:47:27] follow the word of
[2:47:29] God the word of God from the bottom of
[2:47:32] your heart and if you are speaking to
[2:47:36] somebody talk from the
[2:47:39] heart not dodging and finding out I
[2:47:43] don't know what he's talking
[2:47:44] about praise the name of the Lord let us
[2:47:47] go to First Corinthians chapter
[2:47:53] 4 okay at Second Corinthians chapter
[2:47:57] 4 I just love that scripture
[2:48:00] there it says therefore seeing we have
[2:48:03] this ministry as we have received Mercy
[2:48:06] we faint
[2:48:15] not but we have renounced the hidden
[2:48:19] things of dishonesty and not walking in
[2:48:22] craftiness nor handling the word of God
[2:48:26] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[2:48:28] truth commending ourselves to Every
[2:48:32] Man's conscious in the sight of God
[2:48:58] praise the name of says we have
[2:49:00] renounced the hidden things of
[2:49:03] dishonest not walking in
[2:49:06] craftiness nor handling the word of God
[2:49:09] deceitfully but by the manifestation of
[2:49:12] the
[2:49:13] truth commending ourselves to Every
[2:49:16] Man's conscious
[2:49:18] [Music]
[2:49:21] in the sight of God speak the truth from
[2:49:24] the
[2:49:26] heart not a
[2:49:28] pretense you say this you mean this
[2:49:33] praise the name of Lord like when they
[2:49:35] say when she says
[2:49:37] yes she means
[2:49:40] no when she says no she means a yes then
[2:49:45] you start a hunting trip around
[2:49:57] praise the name of Lord when they say no
[2:50:00] I think now they didn't mean
[2:50:03] it then you start around persuading here
[2:50:07] persing here no praise the
[2:50:11] name in the message to see
[2:50:16] Jesus he says and so
[2:50:19] that is the way it is
[2:50:21] tonight those who desire to see
[2:50:25] God must come with a perfect
[2:50:30] heart with all strange feelings set
[2:50:35] aside with all toward neighbor set
[2:50:41] aside with all towards the other
[2:50:43] churches set
[2:50:46] aside and all other individual
[2:50:49] and forms of
[2:50:51] worship you must come with that perfect
[2:50:56] heart could I see you
[2:50:58] Lord could I see you
[2:51:01] Lord take all the superstitions
[2:51:08] away and I am going to seek
[2:51:11] tonight to seek the Lord
[2:51:14] Jesus now I hope that is your intention
[2:51:19] every one of you and I believe that if
[2:51:23] you come with that kind of
[2:51:25] intention God is under
[2:51:28] obligation to reveal himself to you
[2:51:32] don't you believe that God is under
[2:51:35] obligation to reveal himself to you here
[2:51:40] tonight and you know God is so
[2:51:43] gracious that if your heart is right if
[2:51:47] your heart is pure
[2:51:49] even when you are going into error un
[2:51:53] knowing the Lord will always stand there
[2:51:56] to tell you that is wrong like
[2:52:00] a he was taking Abraham's
[2:52:03] wife because Abraham said this is my
[2:52:06] sister and then the Lord came in the
[2:52:08] night told him you you are as good as
[2:52:12] dead and then he said Lord how will you
[2:52:15] punish a righteous people
[2:52:19] said you have taken a man his wife but
[2:52:21] the man said his wife
[2:52:24] sister then the Lord told him because
[2:52:27] your heart is right that's why I've have
[2:52:29] come to warn you but now the
[2:52:33] wicked he just goes with
[2:52:36] it that's what the Bible say to the
[2:52:40] wicked
[2:52:43] [Music]
[2:52:45] nness leads them to destruction
[2:52:49] like H the bad heart he had for
[2:52:53] mod him to
[2:52:55] destruction praise the name of our Lord
[2:52:57] so we need that we have Pure
[2:52:59] Heart upright before the Lord obeying
[2:53:03] the word of
[2:53:05] godam says when you come with that kind
[2:53:08] of
[2:53:10] intention a perfect heart looking unto
[2:53:13] the Lord God is under
[2:53:16] obligation to reveal himself
[2:53:20] now you find
[2:53:21] favor you know the will of God you know
[2:53:25] the mind of
[2:53:26] God praise the name of our Lord in
[2:53:29] Psalms
[2:53:32] 25 praise the name of our Lord Psalms
[2:53:36] 25 this is my second last
[2:53:40] scripture Psalms 25 then verse
[2:53:45] 12 the scripture says
[2:53:49] what man is it that fears the Lord him
[2:53:52] shall it teach the way that he shall
[2:54:02] choose verse 14 The Secret of the Lord
[2:54:06] is with them that fear Him and He will
[2:54:08] show them his
[2:54:16] Covenant praise the name of our Lord
[2:54:19] fear the lord he will show his
[2:54:21] confidence he will reveal to you those
[2:54:24] hidden
[2:54:25] things praise the name of our Lord like
[2:54:28] if you want to
[2:54:29] marry but then you find a sister or a
[2:54:34] brother seek the
[2:54:36] Lord he will reveal more about
[2:54:39] that but now if your heart is not right
[2:54:43] with how are you going to see
[2:54:46] right when yourself you are wrong
[2:54:49] you can't see right you'll see that
[2:54:52] which is like
[2:54:54] you so if you are FR in the
[2:55:00] heart you get another one like
[2:55:04] you hey the Bible says they shall
[2:55:10] deceive and what happens to them they
[2:55:13] also
[2:55:14] deceived so you try to hide something
[2:55:16] behind you
[2:55:18] you go to God God doesn't answer you
[2:55:22] like Saul when he went to
[2:55:26] the there was no answer no answer from
[2:55:29] the prophets no answer from the
[2:55:33] dreamers where did he
[2:55:35] end what the prophet told
[2:55:39] him to obey is better than
[2:55:43] sacrifice and then the prophet told him
[2:55:46] Rebellion
[2:55:51] is like
[2:55:53] witchcraft he ended up in
[2:55:56] witchcraft a
[2:55:58] spirit and the prophet's word was
[2:56:02] fulfilled but then if he
[2:56:05] oby if you did everything according to
[2:56:08] the word of
[2:56:10] God would answer
[2:56:12] him it was always answering
[2:56:15] David when David would ask that should I
[2:56:18] go to
[2:56:19] battle it would answer no don't go will
[2:56:22] I find these people and then it would
[2:56:25] answer you'll find but when Saul went
[2:56:28] there with a fraud
[2:56:31] heart with bad
[2:56:33] intentions it was
[2:56:36] silent and then he went to the
[2:56:38] witch praise the name of our Lord so the
[2:56:41] Bible says the secret of the Lord is
[2:56:45] with them that fear him you'll always
[2:56:48] not the Covenant of God the Lord will
[2:56:51] show it to
[2:56:52] you praise the name of let us finish
[2:56:55] with second Corin chapter
[2:56:59] 16 and then verse
[2:57:02] 9 praise the name of the
[2:57:04] Lord for the eyes of the Lord run to and
[2:57:08] fr throughout the whole earth to show
[2:57:11] himself strong in the behalf of them
[2:57:15] whose heart is perfect toward him here
[2:57:18] in thou Hast done foolishly therefore
[2:57:21] from henceforth thou shall have wars
[2:57:31] [Music]
[2:57:53] praise the name of the Lord he says the
[2:57:55] eyes of the Lord they run to and
[2:57:59] FL they come in your house they even go
[2:58:03] to your
[2:58:05] bedroom they go to your place of work
[2:58:08] they go to your office they even run in
[2:58:11] the taxi you are
[2:58:14] using when you are in eyes of the Lord
[2:58:19] they run to and
[2:58:21] FL and the Bible says throughout the
[2:58:27] Earth they are seeking that
[2:58:30] person whose heart is perfect toward
[2:58:33] God now when your heart is
[2:58:38] perfect in the times of
[2:58:42] Crisis
