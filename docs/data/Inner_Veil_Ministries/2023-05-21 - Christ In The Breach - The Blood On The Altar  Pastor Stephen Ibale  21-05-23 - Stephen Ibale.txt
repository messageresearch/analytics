TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] talking my head 900 years to witness the best and he says unto us the son is born but if you are not in the dimension of the problem you'll think that the man is a little bit because [Music] he's talking about the same son he says for he shall grow up now he's talking about him in the future before he must attend a plan and that's the root out of the dry ground then he goes into the past presence he says he has no forms amen like he's right there and then he goes in welcome back foreign [Music] um so you really need to understand what I got together how the Holy Spirit uses prophets so we step into the subject of the blood on the outer equality by a principle that Revelation 5. is the bridge foreign amen Amina so listen to what brother Branham says here now now we are going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not Seven Seals is not a physical place it's first whenever that is [Music] a spiritual maturity and in that maturity there are certain benefits the children of God so now it's like in the world there is what we call evacuation amen they deliver you from where there is a lot of trouble you know all kinds of things going on and then they [Music] from all those out of organizations [Music] [Music] who has the power to save praise the Lord foreign [Music] are you together with the man is it and we see the advocate so the judge listens to the prostitute and the prostitute in this case he knows how many peer bottles you've drunk he knows how many nightclubs you have gone he knows how much witchcraft you have exercised so he stands and says [Music] this one here is [Music] what to come to hell with me foreign [Music] [Music] are you together with me what is it and one of the others now in Israel the tribe of Judah was the king and the King was the judge so now the Elder here he says [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] we do are you together with Ryan is there so he buys you as a slave and maintains you as a slave if you are going to be redeemed it only required somebody who was the king's man Church somebody is related to you is and if we try to redeem the land also it had to be the Kinsman yeah to redeem you because in Israel the land was not given to individuals [Music] who received an individual property and that was calebu the rest of them the land belonged to the tribe yes [Music] [Music] and that was not accepted in the law Iran that's why it's required to be a kingdom foreign [Music] are you together with me that's why Jesus became a man he had to become a king's man I know to fit in the love Redemption it required you must be born of the human race [Music] and produce the production that's why when John turned to see he says in the midst of the throne Hallelujah [Music] to come and do the judgments but when he turned to see the Bible says how did he see that love yeah foreign those are symbols because after his Redemption after redeeming then he became the spirit in the midst of the church are you together with me he became the authority in the church he became the Revelation he became the power in the church so now seven [Music] has been moving through the seventh Church [Music] are you together with me when he came down into church his presence was the power guardian of the church are you together so now that's where the symbol of the horns come from Jesus and then it says seven eyes now speaks about the seven Messengers [Music] [Music] he has been prevailing he has been fighting America to help the church praise God position [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] told him to send the message [Music] [Music] he was dealing with them in a different particular way the anointing was different so now that one is considered to be one Spirit then the Same Spirit comes moving with the chance and the church has changed the dimensions in form of corrects [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the devil has nothing to hold you foreign [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] presenting himself [Music] it becomes you know when you do that then the outer Timber is smoking the moment you remove foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] amen Amina so where brother Branham speaks about the blood being of of the Sun Challenge cannot be the bridge but it's just the Holy Ghost Crossing Borders the Holy Ghost speaking in the future reference like Isaiah in one sentence foreign [Music] foreign [Music] amen Amina remember look it up he had been on the Mediterranean work back here but remember these seals are ready to be open they said no this was foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen Amina one half hour that it is silent that's Revelation the sanctuary there's no intercession the script I mean the sacrifice has left is Judgment for the blood covered lamb has walked away then he says don't you wait till that time remember in the Old Testament as long as the blood was of the mercy it was judgment but as long as the blood was on there there was Mercy but when the lamb walked away there is power in the yeah when it comes to the success and call for rocks to follow them and the scripture says yes we run away from them at that time the scripture says in the streets because it can't reduce [Music] but we thank God we are under the blood you need to get under that soul of the blood of Jesus Christ because it is don't judge yourself praise God now we must know that this service is the bridge he's doing the bridge but it crosses out the borders into the trumpets which is the time when God is dealing with Israeli in the time of the triplets amen amen listen here listen I'm giving you a quote amen Amina but now everything when it comes to dealing then with Israel let me explain this a little bit the principle of God is that God doesn't deal with Israel and then the Gentiles at the same time accepting special foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] in Acts chapter 13. after they had tried to go back to recognize but this Christ was the message and they rejected in Acts chapter five seeing that you have rejected now we turn to the Gentiles that's why we see the Gentiles have Christ by another question the Jews don't understand Christ too but then it's Professor that when God is finishing with the Gentiles he has to go back and get the juicy I know and that is going to be a work of three and a half yeah are you together [Music] now when we are done he goes back to the Jews then you can understand this but when it comes to dealing with Israel in this last part of the 70th week he deals with them as a nation when the Gentiles are finished the hour is sooner Rising is very nice that God turn from the Gentiles all together [Music] come when there's two times put your sin to the old castle as long as the blood is there don't you wait for Asus time and the father did nothing to do the time of is so he says they shall trap Down the Walls of Jerusalem right now the Gentiles until the Gentile disposition be finished let him that's fill this stuff that is the time we are going against when the gospel will mean nothing that's why you are here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to the Jews [Music] [Music] [Music] as it was in foreign [Music] we are coming at the End of Time the blood is still on the altar um ask for forgiveness the blood still works don't you run on guns me I think I'm finished the blood is [Music] says that sacrifice has been removed There's Nothing But Smoke and that's exactly what's poured out tonight is being finished from over on the floor and the sacrifice as we've typed him perfectly the Kinsman redeemers that come from foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh that did it see he was a prophet he would stand and watch amen Amina so he has been an interesting no other person is amen amen tell me where Mary could make intercessions then what could Mary offer because it was necessary to give life for the Redemption of man and see sin cause death if Mary gave herself she couldn't come back to bring us to life she would also be a victim of the effects [Music] aguana but he is the intercessor what could Saint Francis how could Saint Francis of asses or any other Saints and Francis John never saw thousands of saints come out from the mediteria is [Music] that was at the end now when John was already out of the denominational age amen because they had rejected Christ and the journey was told in Revelation chapter 4 verse and you see things [Music] [Music] that are benefiting us is that the end of the year praise God Amen I want you to take this now well I believe with all my heart the city is still open [Music] [Music] [Music] when 10 foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is filled with blood [Music] and he started to sing his songs [Music] [Applause] [Music] well [Music] that blood loses [Music] oh yes lose your yeah again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they're guilty is still sickness [Music] Bloods that fly he got the Revelation yes and if you get the revelation of the blessings you'll put it all under the blood you put the adultery under the blood always always foreign [Music] [Music] okay beautiful it was you know a foggy morning and he was looking yeah for the river so that he could dump himself into it it was so real churches [Music] and the life so he says the life of the Flesh and I've given it to you what have I given to you [Music] amen amen he says I've given it to you to make an attorney for yourself [Music] you know somebody can have a structure for another man foreign [Music] [Music] because the real atonement was behind the life so the life of the Bulls and the life of the God could not match the king's manship Hallelujah so what that blood is not to take away amen amenities a New Testament scripture [Music] he was actually you know giving us a New Testament scripture God was crossing his borders foreign [Music] okay 17 11. what a New Testament scripture that was in the Old Testament sought me out praise the Lord okay now continuity is a new testament not through him Amina we caught them mechanics they know how to question guy no I don't think whether that's not knowing how to question because they do it at the wrong time amen I think we are sorted out now you see as I was saying let me know Leviticus speaks about a tournament coming from the Life In The Blood um and now as they gave the godsamboo in 10 minutes the blood that was coming from that the life that was coming from that sacrifice manship to the scene so we forget let's just go on thank you again [Applause] the weakness America [Music] is lost myself amen [Applause] ities [Music] but God himself had to come in Salvation of his children but then I won't tell you here that when he comes down here to be a king a spirit would not die for us but he calm down through a blood cells for the purpose of death [Music] [Music] when foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] are you seeing where your Redemption is praise the Lord your Redemption is not just the place but out of the blood of countries [Music] and then the life itself foreign [Music] are all things foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] it was necessary for all of them to come at one stature so which cause he's not ashamed to call them brethrens foreign [Music] [Music] foreign that's where the blood comes touches and releases his life so that he become the possessor of your soul he makes it his throne at your full interview in a circle the soul that sinneth it shall die amen but it comes and takes control Yeah by making your soul your personal Pentacles is the life in the blood and we are saved by The Life of Christ amen amen when he comes back wake up to the altar of your soul amen amen so the New Testament foreign [Music] [Music] to give birth to give birth to that life Glory had to be a virgin Mariah in order to bring forth that life and he also you must be a virgin of the word of God in order for you to bring forth that nothing is true to you but the word of God [Music] whatever you started becomes part of you and once it gets a hold of you I want to tell you one thing Brothers something unusual is going to happen amen amen that's why the prophet says don't obedience to the world Amen so God's word the promise speaks [Music] Hallelujah we could not speak [Music] the life in the animals could not be compatible to our lives the language of animals was not known to us [Music] they were just covering their sin by the chemistry of the black but if I wake up but in the New Testament the life himself when he died he released the blood yes which has got the component of life that's compatible with you Hallelujah and that's the life of God [Applause] and that lies there problem about has the ability to speak he says he will print the Lord that's the life it speaks better things okay how many of you have ever felt that but make a life that's the blood on the altar okay it has a life that speaks [Applause] in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22. [Music] with Heavenly realities foreign [Applause] [Music] so the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn amen which is written in heaven and to the spirits of Justice he's describing your location that you are now here in the general assembly and the Church of the first name is the first born himself Amen to a New Creation the Lord Jesus Christ is now called The Church of the first yes it belongs to Jesus yeah yes this church is amen amen praise the Lord and you are written in heaven praise God yes sir and then we are gathered together as spirits of Justice [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he was limited to the chemistry foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] That's The Voice of thy Brothers amen the New Testament the blood speaks the blood is speaking the blood has got a voice that's the voice the voice of the blessings amen then he says again your testimony in the New Testament it speaks of redemption [Music] will not keep speaking judgments will convict you of righteousness [Applause] [Music] [Music] in the New Testament he speaks of redemption he speaks of death [Music] his brother knowing that he had killed where they are saying the black I'm sorry of Jesus and speaks peace [Music] all the Redemptive blessings it speaks for us [Applause] we still have the blood on the earth remember foreign [Music] [Music] yeah it hides you from Raptors and the message [Applause] you are getting purified [Music] just like sanctification is a compound word means set aside for service what does that yes [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] because there is no Idol membership in the blood of Christ he wants to bless you we already Justified and brought you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] by the four living [Music] [Music] and the life foreign Messiah that was the Rich was under the blood inside comes up of Christ that's what it is that's what it is it was not the chemistry anymore now you've been Justified you've been sanctified it's the power of the blood look at the prophet speaking about that blood and the stretch of the perfect because the life of the flesh is in the blood and therefore the prophet says if you die and to sing offer you take the blood of a man out foreign [Music] even if he was your daddy you don't want to enter that room there is a thing of death so you're taking the blood out of a man he's gone then the only thing you do is to get another Blood back in him so you had to die to sin and then we get another Blood In which is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that's what we are talking about this afternoon and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the persons of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ [Music] of Jesus Christ which is Jesus Christ he transfers his life away into you foreign amen Amina that comes from the blood he says then God representing his church as a bride a woman who's the bride um is the church mechanism as the body of Christ controlled by the Life of Christ his soul where does that life come from the blood on the order God represents his church as a pride and the way it brings each individual to being a son to go in the Rapture he has also brought the bride through these ages are you a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ found a new body Christian transferred this life by death through the life in the blood then came back to live in the instrument Target of the church we thank God we still love the blood and if [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's all the Old Testament Saints received their atonement it's not just that brother or Uganda you share that same life God Bless you that's the blood okay in the bridge we still have the blood on the altario God bless you so much brother Moses if you can come and sing song Amen I mean he doesn't worship then brother James has got a few announcements we don't know whether we are going to have some kind of a meeting together we can support Martin uh Comfort we leave that brother momenta we are in that safety zone my grandchildren always sing that number I mean that number I mean that number and then they go back again um [Music] if my brother can come forward let's stand up and just say I mean that now I mean that number number that number [Music] [Applause] [Music] John saw that number [Music] number [Music] and why why numbers [Music] [Music] the blood was number the blood was number the blood was number
