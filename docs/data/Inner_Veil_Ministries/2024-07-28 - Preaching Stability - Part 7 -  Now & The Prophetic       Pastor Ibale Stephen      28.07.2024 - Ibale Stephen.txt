forever the ever present help in time of trouble when we come in your presence is only possible because of the blood we pray father that we may lay every negative thing in that precious blood that you may wash us as clean as clean can be so that we can have an acceptable [Music] Fellowship so number of children come before you today they've got different pressures of life but they will always depend on you I pray that may bless them bless them in a special way as you meet their needs we want to remember our brother is not feeling well and all the others who have unspoken requests father I pray that you may reach them and touch them and on the same token father we also bring our brother James katumba who is right now father doing services in Hari father I pray that you may bless them bless this particular one also in a special way just the same way you've been together with us we pray that you may even magnify your presence today in Jesus name amen so let's turn to Second Timothy chter 4 amen second Timothy chter 4 and verse two these are instructions from Paul to Timothy he tells Timothy preach the word be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exalt with all long suffering and doctr so he's telling this young man don't be very Hy in doing things he says all this do it with long suffering brother Bram says for over 30 years he had been preaching to Sisters not to cut their hair and he says have they stopped he says with all long suffering and doctr God bless the service today you may be seated so I've got a very uh interesting title out of this scripture it is now and the prophetic now and the prophetic so Timothy's Church to preach the word and to be instant and to be instant means that he should be found doing so being instant both in season and out of season to be instant to be constant to be found ready to be in season is to bring forth what Peter called the present truth Amen in second Peter chter 1 and verse 12 he says wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth so while all scripture is truth there is what Peter is referring to as present truth because it is present Tru when we read Isaiah 14 that a virgin shall conceive much as is truth is not present truth when we read about Moses Leading The Exodus it is truth but it is not present truth so Peter says of all the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation find yourself so that you may always stand in season amen and present the present truth to the people brother message entitles entitled recognizing your day and its message amen when you that message he's saying that you must come to a spot where you standing the present tense in your Fai that is the now amen that's why I called it now you should not the very hour and time and sign and message that you are living amen but then there's the prophetic part of the ministry Amen brother Bram says you know he preached a message like things that are to be future home talk to the Rapture amen the new home and all things so Timothy was admonished to be instant in both Amen in the now and the prophetic the people to know what they live for and live by in the present tense and also help the people to know where they are going to put their next is that amen so that's what Paul means in season and out of season so every Ministry Works in both seasons and out of the Season means that every ministry will have a prophetic element in it much as Timo you are not a prophet but you must stand in season and out of season not the M didn't explain very well in season you have to bring the people to their present out of season you must help them look into the future so all the Ministries are like that so when we come to church we should watch with inent statement that the Holy Spirit brings before us some of it is in season and some of it is a future reference praise the Lord so the Holy Ghost knows those things that were and those that are and those that are to come and now is exactly the same much as he has known everything along the course of time but still the Holy Spirit knows everything about you he knows your past he knows your present he knows your future so when he begins to minister he may speak and address you practically and looks like the ministry was with you at home because you come down here for God to deal with your life and sometimes things are sa which you may even question why would have Pastor said such a thing you just don't need to discard it because it may be in your so we serve a God who knows today who knows tomorrow and who knows everything is the same yesterday today and forever amen the Holy Ghost is the prophet but he only uses versus to prophesy so I want take you down here into the book of Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 6 we are going to look at a few scriptures here and we pray that the Holy Spirit may help us to internalize them so Revelation 19 verse and I heard as it were I heard as it were the voice of a great mouth multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of munder saying hallelujah for the Lord God nown not hear voices but you know he had a single voice but it was as the voice of many Waters meaning that these voices were blending into one voice as the voice of many Waters and this voice here is certainly the voice of Christ but the voice of Christ was coming through from so many different vessels but it has always been one voice that's the voice of Christ PA was that voice Mar was that voice and even the local Ministry is The Voice of Christ even you also when you were anointed in a certain way in times of fell we speak as Christ speakers is the voice of many Waters verse seven let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made us and her to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine L clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he says unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage of the L and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God my my my praise the Lord now John was not in the now John was in the prophetic you cannot take it away you see when people believe they need something to keep them in their daily work but then there must also be something that should keep their hopes going you understand what I mean look at what sand has been singing she has a mind about her father but she has the prophetic there will be a meeting in the end are you together with me so now listen to verse 10 and I fell at his feet to worship him and said and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus God for the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of propy are you together with me the spirit of Christ is I mean the testimony of Christ is the spirit of Prophecy now I want to put it in perspective here that now after the Judgment of the Great in Revelation 18 the voice of the ministers echoed back echoed back [Music] amen so that they had preached I mean th uh the it back what had been preached Through the Ages that there would be a judgment to the but then there would be a bride Through the Ages that would be adored with the Garment of Jesus righteousness and I want to believe you that brother amen I hope you are raed with the fine linen and we need to keep it clean and also white so the Garment is kept clean by the present truth are you together with me the present truth of the word help us to keep the Garment clean praise the Lord Brother Bram here you know uh through this P Vision he says you know he's uh talking about the vision that John saw of Christ he says like wool and his eyes were flames of fire and his feet like brass burn in the furnace and his voice the sound of many Waters this means that is word is broadcast by many people but it remains one voice the voice of the word amen I can never preach anything different than what the word is and since Christ is the word when I preach the word I'm also joining and blending in amen with the voice of many Waters amen they back amen that this was preached this was preach it kept the people clean it contributed to keeping the Len clean are you together with me so we come down here to present ourselves to the washing water to wash our G as we walk through the week we may pick some dir here and there but God is very gracious he takes you to the washing Waters to present you finally without spot or wrinkle amen he says voice of many Waters what does Waters represent amen if you want to mark it down turn to Revelation 17:15 and you'll find that the Bible says the waters which you saw is thickness and multitudes and people and [Applause] T all right voice what a horrible thing for a drifting Soul on the sea of [Music] life amen you know what we call drifting on the sea of life no pilot to guide SL floating with the tides amen tides that that rumbling Waters to hear the RO of the great [Music] CS you know the amen what a horrible thing it would be to a SW voice of many Waters what is his voice is the Judgment the voice of the minister through the Holy Spirit God cried out to the people in every age standing there so many Waters out thickness multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his right hand to the church preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism in the name of Jesus speaking in Tong the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many water came forth from this one that looks like a son of man are you together with me say Amen somebody so all these voices were summed [Music] up as the testimony of Jesus Christ the voice of Paul voice of and all the ministers of William and all the ministers they all make one testimony testimony of Jesus Christ the voice of many Waters yet One Voice which is the voice of Jesus Christ so the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy so as I preach I would say as I prophesy I have to be instant in season and out of season to present you the present and to give you the hope of the future so the prophet beems all of souls encompassed by this drifting you know Souls on the sea of life amen there are those who are drifting they are just drifting on the sea of Life they are not stable they are not committed to the voice of many wers they are like drifting Souls they do not know how to station themselves on the sea of life God desires us to find our position and align ourselves with the ministry of the Holy Spirit he says what a horrible thing for drifting Soul the Sea of Life their rejection of the voices of many Waters is when you don't submit and subject to the voice which is the voice of Christ is atonment your joy is to open up for the world and whenever the word is preached just say Amen father that is mine hallelujah hallelujah that's what we need so that we can stabilize on the sea of life you should not be a lose Soul floating with the time every wind of doctr he says what be a drifting soul amen so we preach for now bringing people to recogize the finished work of to bring the people into repentance to straighten up their lives from the sinful Gentile Traditions to set forth precepts of work in the present now to break codes to break codes you know all you know with the works of the flesh that's now that Ministry putting you into the now because if we don't have it now then we are not part of the prophetic are you together with me amen Galatians 5 amen because this is the now to break a codes Amen to set ourselves free because if the codes are holding us amen a voice will keep calling you up higher but then you were stuck and now Paul tells Timo release the people from the things that hold them instance preaching season the things that are controlling the people and when they are free then I the Lord amen is waiting for them into the prophetic tell them what it shall be that are to be tell them about the Rapture about the New Jerusalem in season season is that amen amen so Galatians 5:19 he says the works of the flesh amen manifest which are these fornication uncleanness lavious idolatry witchcraft hatred Varan ulations St sedition heresies EnV MERS drunkenness reings and such like of which I tell you before as I have always told you in the time p but they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God together with me you failing the now you cannot be the prophetic so in season of season release them release the People by the preaching of the word and once they are released then tell them about the kingdom that they will inherit the kingdom of God Amen so we Vis the needs of the people in we put the church in order by putting them into life of worship you understand what I mean you see you you need not be like pharaoh when Moses went to Egypt he told Pharaoh God says that you release these people to go and worship then Pharaoh says it's okay but you can leave the children and then Moses said no everything that sour must go with us into the worship so worship was not something they were going to do on the mountain of Si once but worship was life that was led by the word so when they cross over then God began to put them into the life of worship are you together with me yeah so this is what we are dealing with here that God be gracious that we put the church in order to be accepted in the worship amen there are certain things we break l there are certain battles that you go through but as we keep going one step after time we shall come to our Victory amen so here we are now and in the now amen we car the word to perfect the Saints we pray we baptized we went to the [Applause] [Music] C andate the children we establish the people in the present but then in the prophetic is it over when we get out of here no sir there is a lot more amen what eyes have not seen what ears have not had the things that God has prepared for amen there is a law that God is going to un for when we break the curtain of time amen but for now God has allowed me as a minister to establish the people in the present amen so we teach to make the people understand the season we the season of the restoration of all amen but there is still a future ahead of us if you don't understand this it will be easy for you to drift and go to another spot provided it's just a matter of worship I'll go to the Catholic church because you don't understand the now you don't understand what God is doing are you together with me okay Acts chapter 3 and verse 18 listen to what he said but those things which God before had showed by the mouth of All His prophets Christ should suffer he has fulfilled so Peter is putting the church into phases of the movement from time into eternity we are only Jour this worship and we are not going back we keep gaining ground are you together with me yes okay Peter says but there are certain Old Testament prophecies concerning the death and resurrection of Christ all the way from Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 up to calary then Peter says all those things which were prophesied are now [Music] [Applause] fulfilled so at the time Peter commands that as the people waited for the oncoming prophetic fulfillment again amen praise the lord we need to keep in a life of repentance and cleaning our lives until we break again into another pH which is eternity am amen so God wants to work on our lives amen he says in verse 19 repent and be converted that your sins he says all the things which you prophesy have been for now this is the present so far keep a life of repentance so that we may step again into the next phas are you together with me that's how we live a Christian Life when they were called into season of worship it was phase after phase it was phase after phase a prophet would come prophesy them into the next phase hallelujah hallelujah and they needed to step into the next phase and then they kept going God would rebuke them God would correct them God would I mean chastise them and they kept repenting and God is a good god each time they repented he put them back from the chest and then brought them back again he would love them the way he loved them and this is the way God is dealing with every [Applause] individual he says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be brought down so that the next season may find a clean vessel so Peter now sends the church into the next phase and the next phase was the time of refreshing that would come to the entire church from the presence of the Lord and the time of Peter the time of refreshing was prophesying that time but now this is our now we are in the time of refreshing okay at the time the spirit said in verse and he shall send Jesus Christ after the refreshing he sends Jesus Christ which before was preached you are you together with me we are in the T of the refresh but then he says then after he send Jesus Christ in season out of season now and prophetic are you together with me the church has been moving like that and that's what Paul was telling timoth amen so he say Heaven Must receive whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of is prophets since the world began so now Peter is telling the people of his time that we are waiting for the time of refresh because that was still in the future which is our present now are you together with me he says but when that time com there will be a restoration of all things and this is where we are now and it says after the restoration of all things then God will send Christ whom the heavens would hold until after all things are restored are you together with me so seeing that now we in the time of the restitution of all things our eyes must be open to the coming of the Lord are you together with me look at what is happening in isra Israel is our calendar Hallelujah It Is encompassed by all [Music] forces it's a type of the church are you together with me we are getting closer for all the Fulfillment of the last prophecy amen of those seven Visions hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah are you together with me time shall be normal we are standing between Time and Eternity you see God will give me Grace and we pick up the prophecies that the prophet gave us to show us the signs of time whoever [Music] knew that a woman will come and be very powerful in America brother BR talked about a powerful woman I don't care whether Cala Harris wins the election or she doesn't win it has come forth that there come a powerful woman who puts all the men down I can be president of the United States we are waiting it will be exciting are you together with me everything is just coming down to to this now I Shar out about the Hand of Death you see during the Cold War when Soviet Union was still they were so scared that America would hit them with an atomic bomb and so they said okay if they do that they started going into their heads and they developed the Hand of Death that even if America beats the world Soviet Union they developed the Hand of Death that just senses amen and the moment it senses it [Music] triggers so it doesn't matter for brother told us that Russia will destroy America so it doesn't matter whether they come number one still the hand of death is right there you see we are standing at the brink of Prophecy and God tells instant in season out of season teach the people to walk the walk teach the people to look into prophecy we're in the time of the restoration of all things and so what after this amen after this then comes the change of our bodies are you together with me you gather all of the evidence which is prophetic it was given to us we cannot ignore it and keep looking at the present can't keep looking at the prophecy and ignoring the Pres we have to balance the thing amen much as one walks on one leg 12 B to balance the one do you know no man walks on two legs you walk on one leg we walk by one leg you need the other one to balance the other one I'm walking on one leg that's how it is are you together so you need the now and the amen so let's go to see the season where we are amen Mali 45 he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and rful day of the Lord and he shall turn the house of the fathers to the children and the house of the children to their fathers lest they come and smite the Earth with a curse now that was prophetic but now it's the present T this day this scripture is fulfill we can now read it on this order behold I sent you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Greatful day of the Lord because it's already and he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children by John the Baptist and the Heart of the children to their fathers by the Min of the Prophet message of the church so now is an anointing I've always told you and this anointing comes five times it began with who tored the kingdom of Ahab who would bind the sky released the sky who condemned the 400 prophet into fire a man who was a man of like passions like uses just put him a and he says but he prayed a man of light passions but he prayed That's The Power of Prayer hallelujah hallelujah in your weakness pray don't give up Elijah would keep fleeing with fear but he prayed hallelujah hallelujah will you be a Praying person today however weak you feel don't give up pray amen that anointing came up in a double person on El the same anointing comes join the Baptist who restor the hearts of the patriarch fathers to the Jud children amen which were supposed to be the Pharisees but then you know it was able to catch 120 of them hallelujah hallelujah you see that anointing was able to catch 120 and took them to the upper room and anointed them to become fathers [Applause] to become the apostolic father amen and they went us 12 but then that anointing of Elijah comes upon the evening time messenger the prophet message of this age and turns the denomination children who fell away to the apostolic 120 that were in the upper are you together with me amen we are back in the world in the restoration of all things so when John the Baptist came he was the third pych of the Elijah's anointing He restored the hearts of the patriarch fathers and this heart here it got about 120 people hallelujah and took them to a revelation of who Jesus Christ was then these matured at the B of the Holy Ghost and they became fathers but our time Elijah's anointing is on the fourth cycle amen the cycle that rest the denomination children back to the apostolic father oh hallelujah hallu what does that mean that the denomination has nothing to tell you you are going to hear listen to the apostolic father go to the Bible and see what the Bible tells we are being restored back to the apostolic father we are in the time of the restoration of all things this is where we are we are in the time of the restoration of all things hallelujah hallelujah that was what Peter was speaking about it was but it is our message now hallelujah hallelujah and our prophecy that the heavens after we have been restored we return Jesus hallelujah hallelujah there will be a voice amen there will be a voice that will speak for and say come come for my come for this is our next step so we are sorting out our [Applause] [Music] now are you together with me now we are sorting out our now Peter says while all the things that were prophesied have been fulfilled repent until God send the time of restitution now that we in the time of restitution that's where the Holy Ghost is working from repent that you may be found wor when that's the way God works start in season and out of season so our time is the fourth cycle of the anointing of the restoration of all things this is the hour that Daniel peed into and he saw but could not understand even Daniel was given a hope every Christian must have a Living Hope are you together with me yeah every Christian must have a living hope God has a way of putting hope to the age and even to the individual hallelujah hallelujah if there is nothing to live for you can die any time with the precious which is around you you have got this loan you've got this you got this child is sick and then this problem that problem this one against you against you if there is nothing to live you die [Music] that's the way God made a man and that's the way God has worked with the church he has to put something ahe there's something that keeps Us Alive Living Hope hallelujah hallelujah God knew how to get Joseph going hallelujah hallelujah when they gives him a dream sun is bowing the Moon is bowing the stars are bowing it starts to wonder then he keeps going out with his brothers they were gathering some kind of F and then he stood and all the others they bow down then he got in trouble because of his vision they got him they said we are going to kill you he went back to the vision Hallelujah there was something he was living for he says but how about this the stars have not bowed yet amen the shs have not bowed yet think Joseph was scared he was not God we always give you something to live for he will give you something even in your individual life that will be so precious and you are living for it you may give you children they are so precious and you want to bring them to a certain it is something that you live for even when you are and you feel like you D you Lord but my children he said yes they keep you going God is a good god that's how he works with you that's how he works with the [Applause] church he came out of the pit they took him he started looking at the princely house he went to amen the house of potifa powerful special he looks at it he begins to wonder what this would be and then he says no this is a very great place very magnific but it is not that Vision are you together with you must get the right Vision in your life without which small things can take you a little excitement can take you amen are you together with me there was a time when the church danced here about 30 years ago and they thought that was a Revival we thank God that was just a face are you together with me I don't think brother Peter you can be taken by the same thing and you call it Revival it is not these are phes so if people are going through that it is okay it's the phase of their growth so this service we are having is reaching stability s now the the church must be stable not driven by every wind of understand the high calling in Christ Jesus keep the focus up there Joseph looked and said no great as this place is I'm a slave in the other one I was a king and all the others were buing before me did you hear that understand the phes god takes the church through and takes you [Applause] through there will come when you get down into the pit that's not the end of you'll make a mistake that's not the end there isas the end of the road a higher calling in Christ Jesus what you should look at Daniel was in prayer he was in captivity he was wondering what then and God was telling me it's not over the nation of Israel shall stand again not just as a nation but as a prince with God Amen so then Daniel 12 Daniel 128 he was in prayer and I heard and I understood not [Music] then say Oh Lord my God what shall be the end of these things and he said go th Daniel for the words are closed upap and see time of the SOI was seeing our time of the restoration of all things and he saw even beyond that to the hour of redemption So Daniel saw all but because he was seeing that which was out of season he was told to S till the fourth cycle of the anointing of Elijah amen so now we have John in Revelation 5 the book was still sealed with seven SE amen but Revelation 10 John saw what was written in the book but because it was still out of se he was told SE it there will always be something to live for and it looks like it is here when you are getting there you see brother Andrew ring he told the story when you were in in Tanzania and he says when you want to get a mule going a mule a running very [Music] fast you get the carrot sit on it and then you the stick with the car front I tell you that it thinks it's going to and it will go but the is is wonderful he knows how to keep you going every one of us has something so that Hees on the inside I pray that the Lord helps it may be your grandchildren I want to see my children become mothers also I want to see them become and that one becomes realy and it keeps you going that God wonderful he knows how to run the church know even how to run us amen you look at people like young mother sister mother there they've got something they are looking at they discipline children with a view there something they want to get out of them are you together with me God is very wonderful okay Revelation 10 five it is closed I mean in Daniel it is closed in Revelation 5 is closed in 10 John sees it but was verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that was the prophetic when shall begin to the of God should be finished de Serv the prophets so in the days of the seventh angel amen what was out of season becomes Christ that had been sealed in the book makes himself revealed and this is our time where isn't that wonderful we have come to the time the mystery that was hidden before the foundation of the world is now fulfilled we are in the time of the restoration all things and let me tell you this can only let excite and elect because he understands what it is amen we are coming to the end of time okay I take you a little bit here what brother Bram says he's the one who opened those seals then he says he is the seal for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open was the opening of the seals revealing Christ hallelujah hallelujah that's what we were looking for he was always under the seal oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus before the found the world Amen he was seed away he was that El there was nothing that saw him then in the beginning he stepped down into the Loos and he says Let There be but he was still a my and then he started revealing in different ways he come through the pro and the prophets would speak they would speak isah would speak but that was Christ on and then he came down and veiled himself in the Jesus body are you together with me he was still a mystery in that body Philip says show us the father he says Philip I've been with you and you still don't know he came and veiled in the church but thank God Amen praise the Lord on the sunset Mountain the Lord himself descended revealing himself as a [Applause] bridegroom who has come to prepare his bride have you ever seen a thing like that where a bridegroom himself comes down to prepare his own have you ever seen the that I'm going to marry my wife but I'm going there myself prepare Jesus yes came down to prepare his own that's wonderful we can never fail the Lord himself came down so Christ revealed is the message of the hour the emphasis of our ministry of our ministry our Ministries are not the message of the hour we don't make ourselves the empasis not even the messenger is the message of the hour no sir it is the revealing of Christ that's our emphasis in the absolute message this is a powerful quot now if you are not Health enough you study [Laughter] I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass by you I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay any attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the message God will take it away from you he will share his glory with nobody don't watch the message watch the message Hallelujah we cannot be two of us here let me decrease let him increase are you together with that's Revelation 19 don't was me if a man running here he might be black yellow brown or R if he's got a check for you for a bank draft for a million do you don't care what color he was or how he was dress the message he has for so doesn't matter whether brother Bram spoke the right oh it was wrong it doesn't matter he had the message for us hallelujah hallelujah and this message is the restoration of all things and we need to thank God for we are part of the restoration of all things it is Christ and him revealed that's our message amen second Timothy 42 prach the word instant in season out of season rebuke ex with all long suffering and so let's now break up that scripture and then we shall come back with a coup [Music] service are welcome with your [Music] every Ministry has a prophetic element the Holy Spirit may be pointing you sometimes to your future never consider any message that it is irrelevant don't say that what they preached didn't even touch me every Ministry has got an element of the prophetic then there are these two interrelated words but theyy in degree amen because when he told Timothy he told him to preach in season out of season then he tells him reprove rebuke those are interrelated word and then afterwards he told him to ex but with long suffering don't be impatient with people is now telling a minister on how to deal with the people so in chch and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chust then he says to rebuke is to reprove those words are almost the same to rebuke is to reprove to repr I mean to prove I mean to reprove is to expose with a view so to reprove is more of teaching a person out of error by teaching understanding for without a vision the people perish so when we teach we are reproving the people to reprove is to convict with a suggestion of Shame of the person convicted to you know by conviction so that you may bring this person to life you expose you by the word whether it's Error you see what I mean so let's go down here and understand this John chapter 16 and verse and when he is come the Holy Ghost he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment three things are mentioned here that the Lord will reprimand the world for righteousness and judgment but then when you you read it here it's a little bit General but then in verse 9 10 is kind of separating these things verse he will reprove the world of sin because they believe not in me so he rebukes the world of sin because they don't believe sin is unbelief and because you don't believe you will commit sin sin is the nature and sins is what you commit sins is the fruit of unbelief are you together with with me then he says of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more so this is where our rebuke as beli rejecting to grow into His Garment into his righteousness that's where you are condemned what's with you I'm your righteousness I'm your righteousness but what's wrong with you I'm your righteousness who would want to say the devil tells you and then he says I reprove you because you reject what I say of you and you accept what the devil says about you you know what the devil says you are not even savedes the whis that where you come to a point and you even doubt am I Born Again I got so [Music] angry it's true but he says come under the blood and the moment you get under the blood you are righteous but the devil sits in the no man's mind I mean in the No Man's Land that's your mind and one of the senses there is memory you remember the cigarette you smoked 30 years ago and he says you see and yet God says the church will be without spot or I think me have failed that's what the devil does so God reproves you for you accepting what the devil says about you because it paralyzes your growth if you accept what God says it progresses your grow are you together with me the scene of the children in the supermarket in the marketplace they piped and these kids did Dan then they decided toar and these ones didn't lament and then that's the kind of the church the believer is reminded of him that we have a high priest of the slain lamp at the mer seat the blood is offered for your condition and therefore by Faith accept your righteousness do you accept your righteousness this morning amen yeah Romans 51 amen let's be patient I preached two Services yesterday amen and I came back very tired I was not through with this and I was not through with even the evening Serv so I slept about 2:00 and apart from Brother no man has got more hair than me so if I can be patient let us be patient together amen he says in Romans 51 therefore being justified by [Applause] [Music] faith because you know is p test and if there is a problem today then there is no remedy but Paul is saying therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ no need for self condemnation we are being justified present continu sacrifice amen so just submit your so now you know you just go and present yourself and say father have you wake up in the morning and the devil is standing at the door he's ready to knock you down temper anger malice certain things that you can never forgive you know he's always there but each time you open your door and he's right there look at the cross the sacrifice is still bleeding for you amen so but then we are rebuked amen uh I don't know how I can bring this out but let us get back to that scripture of chapter 6 I mean 16 verse 8 and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of Jud I mean and of righteousness and no of judgment amen so we have a rebuke also which is dealing more with iniquity so rebuking is to a person that tends to insist in error reprove and then to reprove you are correcting but rebuke is dealing with more of a person that doesn't want to get out of the condition amen so Church brother Bram says and now he says to his own as many as I I rebuke and to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with the view of Correction does not mean to punish it means to disit because the subject amendment is in mind are you together with me so when you punish you know there is pain of judgment amen that's a punishment it is Judgment so go God does not condemn his [Music] seed there is therefore no condemnation but when you error and you and the purpose is not to give you pain the purpose is reconcil they are very delicate words amen so let's just fall back in second Timothy again and re look at them very well preach the word in season out of season reprove rebuke exalt all longsuffering and so the instruction is laid out amen when you reprove you are teaching you rebuke you try to come down in a little bit of a higher level deal with a person who does not want to restore himself and now after that is done he also says exalt Amen to exalt is to uplift you don't rebuke a person and you shut him away from you he says that's not the way work you rebuke a person open the door ex [Music] him it is possible to overcome those things many people have suffered it is possible that your family can be reconciled so as you have come back together you begin to exalt that's the way God works to work Sal is to comfort by [Applause] [Music] teing and instruction and this goes with long suffering we about the how is patient with such things that's the instruction of the Min amen we must exalt with long suffering and with so I come put you in the word and this Doctrine must bring people to the Christ of c are you together with me any teaching that teaches the people Christ the central them Crystal amen is not God in all this Christ is the standard doctr of the church we may have our desire we may have a way we would have done things but our doctr muste the will of Christ for the people amen second Timothy [Music] 2:15 so we are now in the landing amen you know he says to show yourself approv a Workman that needs not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of J amen you don't take the people too much this way you don't make the people too much this way like Solomon says not too much of a righteous not too much of a wicked so if you don't have the right ears you may fail to understand that but to everything there is the mid of the RO to study is to dig into the world and let God approve you as a Workman that when you get the word doesn't throw you out of the world are you together with me a man gets one thing and throws him again over the other side no he says stud put the word together in season and out of season but Christ must remain of our amen never preach away from Christ many people take certain things and they become thetick who a Believer is if you are a Believer you would be shouting and you are teaching the people away Christ is the central identity of the believer in each age he kept introducing himself to the people with the life relevant that age it was always Christ it was Christ in the Ephesian AG when he was holding Seven Stars in his right hand walking am the seven golden candlesticks he alone was the absolute Authority amen Behind The Messengers behind all the ministers the entire church all the way from Ephesus toia and all those SP and they spoke to their age Hallelujah hallu but all together they came up under the one voice the voice of Christ to the seven Church ages are you together with me amen so I want to say now we are in the last Church age and now to the last Church age all the voices of the seven Messengers are heard through the messenger of Malachi amen is the sering up voice the voice of Malachi 4 this message here is the voice of Christ is the voice of many Waters whatever voice speaks it must speak through this words we must say what the messenger say because what the messenger say is the Capstone of the spirit of Christ through the seven Church ages hallelujah hallelujah so he's finishing up here now and let us finish with him in Revelation 3:14 to the end of the Church of the Lans right this thing says the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so by handling the word in season we are identifying with him amen because our season here is the season of the amen hallelujah hallelujah you cannot preach the people father because the next thing is to release Christ the Heavens to release him so we preach to prepare the people for the second coming of Christ that's our Focus amen so now we must identify him as the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God these are the areas where God wants us to identify ourselves [Music] we can't preach the people further we can't bring an e messenger he has no place they know how to hide in some of those areas but there's no place Jesus is giving this description of himself is giving this Des deson of himself a quot in relation to the last age are you in the last age church so see how Christ is identifying himself in the now he says the days of grace are winding up he looks back from the first century right through the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme Dy this is the Capstone revelation of himself that says the [Music] amen is all people say that Jesus is enough Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus is what we in the cstone of everything then he says Jesus is the man of God Jesus is the soul Let It Be of God Amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of this is where we are I've walked all the seven churches Jesus will be heard saying and now I am in the whining of the days of grace the days where men are standing between Time and Eternity I am the Amen in this age we are in the amen age the age which seales everything the age of adoption in this age is here to vindicate himself as [Music] faithful as faithful are you together with me when you opened the seven seal the seventh the angel came down let me read that to prove his the amen give me Revelation 8 verse1 because he's faithful he's amen he's in the time where he meets all needs of his people he knows that we are weak but then listen to me but then we can pray and when he had opened seven SE there was silence in heaven about the space of hour what was the silence for the person himself had come down to reveal himself and prep his Bri go to verse two there and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and them were given seven trumpets verse and another Ang hallelujah hallelujah The Messengers seven trumpet angels and another angel that was seen in Revelation 10 this time he referred to as another Angel he now comes at the altar because the one who who answers the prayer of people his he the amen he has come down at the altar having a god s there was given unto him that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was Before the Throne he's here to receive your prayers I am amen we are living in the edge where all things are possible the problem we fail to understand the season we've got chronic problems we've got chronic conditions but God be gracious that we may recognize we in the age of the amen where are all things are possible he never you know he he never said by my strip you are healed and he fails on the promise because amen means a prevailing promise and he's faithful that's how is introducing himself in this age is the age of the faithful amen he has promised the Rapture for his body he will not fail he promised that he will be perfect he will not fail this is the Now message hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen this is a long quot but I'll read it for you these things says the faithful and true witness faithful and true two things some people will give promises they'll fail on them but this one is faithful and true is there anything you have need of today he's faithful and true he never fails he can create opportunities amen I said that one time and the ziman who was seated back there he said pastor I'm going to create a job the next week he got a job and he ran away are you together with me yes see they know the principles they are Pentecostals they understand and they catch those things by faith but some of these people in the message they just say that is right but the ziman in the corner mixed it with faith and walk out with your blessing so we are in the time of the third po are you together with me the time of the power of the spoken word in the presence of theen and is willing to receive the prayers who will pray today let's identify the now what we are dealing with we are dealing with the revelation of Christ in the now who never fails in anything amen amen these things says the faithful and true Witness now I want to show you what I found in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about great and changing God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after the manner we often get a view of him that makes seem very imp personal it is as though God made the world universe and the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a great impal it's like they've done these cars which brother Bram saw in the vision which don't have a driver you just program then you can sleep forever and then it will tell you you have arrived that's not the God we Ser amen God cares it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross but and when and then when the death of Christ has atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God folded back his arms and stood back this is how they believe it in the message that God made of Salvation sent his son he died on the cross whoever believes him goes to heaven and he goes there that's how people think no God is concerned for your daily activities he's the god of now he cares in your ca he cares in your job he cares in your school he cares what you eat he cares how you eat that's the god of [Applause] [Music] now are you together with me he cares when you get in your car he cares when you enter your house he cares when you walk on the street God cares that's the god I want us to believe is a God who cares for a young mother who is raising up the children because the scripture says she shall be saved by childbearing she shall be saved by child bear praise the Lord it as if we measured in believing a great Creator who have been created most personal interest in his creation Now I say that is how too many people think but that's what thinking for God is governing in their faith of men now he's both Creator and sustainer he's caring in your entire life he cares about your breakfast come on I'm telling you something he cares about your supper are you together with me learn to tell him he came down here to make it easy for his bride but too much has been preached into mind that after he made away he his hands he's waiting for you to overcome and he takes you home no sir now God cares now and the prophetic in the now cares he cares because you have got children he cares when they go school he cares when you cry for a job God cares that's the God you must worship he's not an idol he not a dead Idol amen he not a computer programming like that car no sir God cares cares for your children cares for your mother cares for your father cares when you cry car when you are happy that's the God now amen he says here by reading Colossians 1:16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that in the earth visible and invisible whether they be throned all dominions all principalities all powers all things were created by Him and for him and he's before all things and by him all things consist he's a sovereign God by his own councel the plan of the Salvation of his own elect for he saw he fall knew it the son died upon the cross and establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father carefully he's working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he's right in the midst of it all is in the MST of his church the great Creator savior God is Faithfully working among his own right now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep amen his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them he his eye is over upon them when the word says that your lives are HID in Christ with God it means exactly that I am so glad that my God abides faithful amen he the true to himself he won't lie he's true to the word he back it up he true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day I am glad that I am resting in his rest being confident of this one very thing that he which has begun a good work in you before me to the day of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah do you have any problem is right there that's the god of now is not an idea he's a person he cares for our everyday life he's both faithful and a true witness my my my do you love him friends Amen Let me give you this quote also he is the faithful and true [Applause] witness you know we think that the word witness well that word is the one we get the word matter from amen the Bible speaks of Steven and anti and others as matters amen they are matters they were also Witnesses Jesus was a faithful matter the Holy Ghost is the witness to that the spirit Bears record to that the world hated Jesus it killed him but God loved him and he went to the Father the proof that he went
