[0:00] and with his son Jesus Christ is
[0:16] and these things right we unto you that
[0:19] your joy may be full
[0:22] name
[0:28] this then is the message which we've
[0:31] heard of him and declare unto you that
[0:35] God is light and in him is not Darkness
[0:38] at all
[0:54] if we say that we have fellowship with
[0:56] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[0:59] not the truth
[1:08] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:12] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:15] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18] his son cleanses us from all sins yes
[1:41] governor
[1:53] contribution
[1:57] then it also means joint participation
[2:04] you know like even as many opportunities
[2:07] of fellowships
[2:11] praise the name of our Lord and you know
[2:13] as a human being
[2:15] remember in the beginning
[2:17] God said it's not good for man to be
[2:21] alone
[2:23] so then he made Eve
[2:26] and he now was a good Fellowship
[2:32] you know she complemented him
[2:36] you know she kind of like and then you
[2:40] know Eve was the reflection of Adam
[2:45] praise the name of our Lord and then our
[2:48] Lord Jesus Christ comes down and then he
[2:51] tells us that where
[3:08] a family is a good Avenue of fellowship
[3:13] and then now when you go and visit
[3:15] another it's also another time of
[3:17] fellowship and then when we come here to
[3:20] church then the fellowship is bigger
[3:24] it's bigger than we can have at our
[3:26] families
[3:28] and now like for example the children
[3:30] are in holidays
[3:32] but then how much time do you spend
[3:35] talking to your children
[3:38] how much time do your children spend
[3:40] talking to you
[3:42] and then you see what the devil has done
[3:46] he has brought technology
[3:50] so everybody can be on their phone
[3:52] foreign
[3:57] [Music]
[4:24] foreign
[5:26] foreign
[5:30] [Music]
[5:36] [Music]
[5:52] and you know sometimes
[5:57] somebody would want to talk to you some
[5:59] things
[6:01] and for you
[6:03] for them they may think this is the
[6:04] right time to speak to him
[6:07] but then for you and maybe on your phone
[6:10] or you are engaged on something
[6:13] and maybe when they are talking you're
[6:16] not seeing their expressions
[6:19] you're not seeing you're not getting
[6:21] into their feelings
[6:23] at the end of the day you pay little
[6:26] attention
[6:28] to that issue and yet some of these
[6:32] things
[6:33] can affect that person
[6:36] because you've not really get the
[6:39] feeling of the person
[6:40] and then you know there are some places
[6:43] oh there are some people who are smart
[6:46] about this maybe these are places of
[6:48] work or maybe in some kind of society
[6:52] they know right that they will time you
[6:55] when you are busy
[6:57] when your mind is caught up somewhere
[7:00] else and then they will ask you
[7:16] your mind is not in it
[7:19] you are not about you're not so much
[7:22] kind of like giving in what they are
[7:25] telling you
[7:26] then afterwards you hear that something
[7:28] has been done
[7:29] and they say but you're the one who gave
[7:32] the concepts
[7:35] yet you you did but because you are not
[7:39] in True Fellowship with that
[7:42] so you see the devil many times also
[7:45] comes
[7:46] that it takes that sweet moment of
[7:49] Fellowship from us
[7:51] like as a family you get this one the
[7:55] devil is making him do the other side
[7:58] and they had to have time together
[8:01] but when need to make good use of the
[8:05] time
[8:06] when we come together
[8:08] praise the name of our Lord
[8:11] when we come together we need to make
[8:14] good time when we come into the presence
[8:18] you know you come with all your hearts
[8:21] you come with all your mind you come
[8:25] with all with one Accord with the noble
[8:28] move praise the name of God you don't
[8:30] come to church and then your mind is
[8:33] somewhere maybe in your business
[8:34] you don't come to church maybe your mind
[8:38] is maybe at school or some work you're
[8:41] meant to do or assignments
[8:45] like now the devil can start telling you
[8:48] oh time has gone
[8:51] praise the name of our Lord and then
[8:53] your mind is completely switched to some
[8:55] other activities
[8:57] then your body is present but then your
[9:01] heart is far away from there
[9:24] you know we should not be like the
[9:26] children in the marketplace
[9:28] let us go to Luke chapter 7.
[9:33] praise the name of Allah Luke chapter 7
[9:36] and then verse 29.
[9:42] so the scriptures say yes
[9:44] and all the people that had him and the
[9:48] publicans Justified God being baptized
[9:51] with the baptism of John
[9:56] never never never never
[9:58] was under
[10:07] you know there is something interesting
[10:11] about John and Jesus
[10:14] praise the name of us you know when the
[10:18] Pharisees
[10:20] when the secrets
[10:22] when the priests
[10:24] when they went to John the Baptist
[10:28] because he was baptizing in the desert
[10:31] praise the name of our Lord and then
[10:35] they were asking him
[10:36] who are you
[10:39] who do you call yourself
[10:42] praise the name of our Lord but when the
[10:44] saudias
[10:45] the publicans the prostitutes when they
[10:50] went to John the Baptist they were
[10:52] asking him what do we do
[10:56] praise the name of Allah
[10:59] then when they come to Jesus Christ
[11:02] the Pharisees they're secretes you know
[11:06] the priests started asking him by what
[11:10] Authority do you do these things who
[11:13] gave you permission when the prostitutes
[11:16] came to Jesus when the Sinners come to
[11:19] Jesus
[11:20] have mercy upon us Deliver Us
[11:24] Praise the name of Allah so then it
[11:27] depends on how one comes to the
[11:29] fellowship
[11:31] praise the name of our Lord so now after
[11:34] now that kind of scenario the Bible says
[11:40] Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the
[11:43] cancer of God therefore is
[11:49] against themselves
[11:51] being not baptized of him
[11:55] so they come to Jesus and then they were
[11:58] asking him by what power
[12:01] do you do this then Jesus told them I
[12:06] will also ask you one question the
[12:08] baptism of John is it of God or it's
[12:11] from men
[12:14] these were Pharisees
[12:17] so what they did they said let us go and
[12:20] have some kind of material that's kind
[12:23] of disgusting
[12:26] and the people were there waiting so now
[12:29] they started the same I had this
[12:31] question here if we tell him it is of
[12:35] god
[12:36] he will ask us why didn't you believe
[12:39] John all right
[12:40] so the deliberate rejected
[12:45] and then they say if we say it's of men
[12:49] the people around will Stone us
[12:52] because they believe John was a problem
[12:56] so they're just playing politics
[13:00] so when then they say so what we tell
[13:03] him we don't you know that we did so
[13:05] they came back and told him we don't
[13:07] know
[13:10] and the same Spirits are around today
[13:13] they keep on playing Colorado praise the
[13:17] name of our Lord so then Jesus gives
[13:19] this Parable yes in verse 31 because of
[13:22] Netherlands and the Lord said where unto
[13:25] then shall I liken the men of this
[13:27] generation
[13:32] and to what are they like
[13:36] they are like children sitting in the
[13:39] marketplace
[13:41] calling one to another
[13:44] and saying we have pipe down to you
[13:48] [Music]
[13:50] and you have not danced we have more
[13:53] than to you and you have not wept
[13:56] look at this scenario
[13:59] you get your friends in the marketplace
[14:02] and then maybe you think your music
[14:06] will excite them but you start playing
[14:10] music you start they are not dancing
[14:14] and then now this one thought maybe they
[14:17] are sorry
[14:18] maybe they have lost something
[14:21] [Music]
[14:23] when they started
[14:29] praise the name of our Lord so when you
[14:32] look what that stration
[14:33] there can never be fellowships
[14:38] as much as you may be in a common place
[14:41] but when you don't have the same Spirits
[14:49] so now I went at our homes let us learn
[14:53] to get into the spirit of fellowship
[14:56] and when we get into Fellowship let it
[15:00] be sweet Fellowship
[15:02] praise the name of Allah
[15:06] the love of God coming down the kindness
[15:10] of God you know that family members are
[15:13] comfortable being at home
[15:17] even if now the children but if they
[15:21] have made the mistake at school or
[15:23] somewhere let them be peaceful at home
[15:26] let them find comforters
[15:37] let the children not find the home is a
[15:40] dangerous place to live
[15:44] like most of these Street children when
[15:47] you follow them they had problems at
[15:50] their homes either the parents were
[15:53] mistreating only that made the mistake
[15:55] and they had thrown them they end up on
[15:58] the streets
[16:00] so we shouldn't allow those kind of
[16:02] circumstances
[16:06] so even as when we come here to church
[16:10] and we are coming for Fellowship
[16:14] let us seek sweet fellowships
[16:18] the presence of God coming down
[16:22] praise the name of Allah now in the
[16:24] message
[16:33] foreign
[16:35] amen so brother Brandon says
[16:38] this time of fellowships
[16:42] all Dr boswas
[16:45] a friend of mine many of you might have
[16:49] known brother
[16:52] he was one of the centralist old man
[17:15] it is two fellows
[17:19] in one ship
[17:22] so they have to share a little bit
[17:27] so that's what Fellowship is
[17:34] share with each other to our governance
[17:40] so you come
[17:43] you know like the brother was exalting
[17:45] us you come prayed up what we're going
[17:47] to happen
[17:49] you know you come with something to give
[17:52] him
[17:53] not only your presence but now when it
[17:57] is time to praise the Lord then you live
[18:00] raise up holy hands
[18:02] praise the name of Allah the Bible says
[18:05] lifting up holy Hearts
[18:07] praise the name of our Lord amen and you
[18:10] know we need to have more Liberty here
[18:12] at church
[18:14] then we have at home you know our
[18:17] presence of one
[18:19] praise the name of God we need to get
[18:21] into the spirit of Fellowship
[18:24] praise the name of Allah when you go to
[18:27] the spots those footballers they get
[18:30] into the spirit of them
[18:32] the athletes when you see watching them
[18:36] running they get into the spirit even
[18:40] that's when we come into here we need to
[18:43] allow
[19:01] you know we need to be happy when we
[19:05] come into the presence of God we need to
[19:07] always seek a time of sweet fellowships
[19:13] and you know when you come with that
[19:15] kind of you get into anatomas your sweet
[19:17] Fellowship
[19:20] then you find that your burdens are
[19:22] taken away
[19:24] you go home
[19:27] you are delivered from your bosses you
[19:30] are delivered from your fears
[19:34] how we need to seek such each time of
[19:36] feelings
[19:40] the message God has a provided way
[19:43] God has a provided
[19:49] when the time
[19:53] it of God Honda which is right here
[19:58] which is here right now
[20:00] the great Holy Spirit
[20:03] moving over the building
[20:06] that sweetness of Fellowship
[20:10] that draws Us close to him
[20:14] letting us know that our sins be
[20:17] pardoned that money sentence
[20:20] our iniquity is gone
[20:23] when we are ready to confess our wrongs
[20:27] God is willing to forgive us
[20:33] so whenever we come to church we need to
[20:37] see that Lord I want to be in your
[20:40] presence
[20:42] enjoy the presence of God
[20:44] being in that kind of sweet Fellowship
[20:51] take time speak to one another
[20:56] remember Pastor was telling us
[20:59] that he
[21:02] there is a brother in the U.S
[21:06] so he was preaching a service and he
[21:10] told the people to remove their wrist
[21:11] watches
[21:16] and then you just wait you just hear the
[21:19] preaching
[21:22] foreign
[21:38] [Music]
[21:48] [Music]
[22:13] foreign
[22:55] so Fellowship is not so much
[23:00] talking that in me I think in the 50s
[23:06] people's love for one another is not
[23:09] there
[23:10] everybody
[23:12] until you hear about the Neighbors
[23:15] on the news
[23:18] some people are no longer concerned
[23:20] about it
[23:23] you just hear something has happened but
[23:26] somebody else is telling you may be a
[23:28] stranger calls you that I'm told that in
[23:29] your place there was decent over here
[23:34] so we are we seem to be just
[23:36] individualistic because
[23:39] praise the name of our Lord but that was
[23:42] not the purpose of God
[23:44] desires us to have such a good time of
[23:46] fellowships
[23:48] praise the name of our Lord then in the
[23:51] message remembering the Lord
[23:54] let us just in sweetness of Fellowship
[23:59] while sitting together in Heavenly
[24:01] places in Christ
[24:07] everything from your heart
[24:11] and remember God's word says I am his
[24:16] servant he's here then let us shake
[24:20] hands with somebody
[24:30] rise up and go
[24:52] [Applause]
[25:16] you know you are so much in that
[25:18] fellowship with the Holy Spirit
[25:21] until you know you are so happy
[25:24] praise the name of Allah you are not
[25:27] traveled about anything
[25:29] and you know God is someone such
[25:33] concerned about our emotions
[25:40] about you know what comes out of your
[25:43] heart
[25:44] praise the name of our Lord in Luke
[25:46] chapter one
[25:48] and then verse 14.
[25:53] you know Zachariah was in the temple
[25:57] offering sacrifices and then the angel
[26:00] came down and then the angel told him
[26:03] about his prayer being answered
[26:06] in Luke chapter 1 verse 13.
[26:09] but the Angels said unto him
[26:14] for thy prayer is
[26:18] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the
[26:22] essence
[26:28] and then now you see how God
[26:31] take so much interest
[26:36] and
[26:39] gladness
[26:42] and many shall rejoice at his best
[26:47] so God is always concerned you know
[26:51] about the state of your heart foreign
[27:41] stood for stimulation
[28:41] you know they were quoting the
[29:42] talking about what you Gaga
[30:13] and they work together and they talk
[30:15] together of all these things which had
[30:18] happened
[30:22] and it came to pass that while they
[30:26] commune together
[30:28] and the reasons
[30:30] Jesus himself brought near yes and went
[30:34] with them but their eyes were holding
[30:38] that they should not know him by the
[30:41] moment together and he said unto them
[30:43] what manner of communication
[30:46] and this that you have one over another
[30:50] foreign
[31:40] so we are looking at like we have
[31:42] problems at home
[31:44] we are brothers but if I tell you that I
[31:48] didn't sleep at night and then you say
[31:51] oh may I even had good dreams and then
[31:53] you say we are not Brothers
[31:56] let us encourage one another
[31:59] praise the name of our Lord have
[32:01] something good to bring up like now this
[32:05] is for yourself for about Christ
[32:08] I'm saying now we thought it would
[32:10] deliver us we thought you'd do this like
[32:14] the disciples
[32:16] even the disciples they were saying we
[32:19] thought you're going to take away these
[32:20] Romance
[32:23] when are you going to come and take over
[32:25] the country and then he told them it's
[32:29] in the father's time to know the times
[32:32] and the seasons
[32:36] so these people are communing together
[32:39] by the way
[33:22] [Applause]
[33:33] where is your face
[33:44] they were having the same The Same
[33:47] Spirit of the rest of the unbelievers
[33:49] upon them
[33:52] like now the days
[33:55] how the Bible says
[34:01] should we also cry the way the world
[34:04] cries
[34:05] to tell the world in the midst of all
[34:09] those troubles we have our Lord Jesus
[34:12] Christ
[34:15] in the midst of the challenge in the
[34:18] ministry of the troubles
[34:22] we have one Lord who is a master of all
[34:26] those things
[34:29] so now Jesus told them why are you
[34:32] saying
[34:32] you're communing with one another
[34:34] fellowship
[34:37] but in sadness
[34:40] [Music]
[34:49] we need to get into an atmosphere of the
[34:52] sweetness of Fellowship
[34:56] praise the name of Allah now we shall
[34:59] get back the scripture but I want us to
[35:02] go to Acts chapter 2.
[35:04] and then verse 42
[35:09] so the Bible says
[35:13] and they continued steadfastly in the
[35:17] apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in
[35:20] the breaking of bread and in prayers
[36:00] and
[36:04] they continuing daily with one Accord in
[36:08] the temple
[36:11] and the breaking bread from house to
[36:14] house
[36:17] did eat their meat with gladness
[36:21] and singleness of Hearts
[36:25] praising God and having favor with all
[36:29] the peace
[36:38] foreign
[37:56] and then you broke he took the bread
[38:01] in verse Luke chapter 24 verse 30.
[38:04] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[38:08] with them
[38:09] he took bread and blessed him and break
[38:13] and gave to them and their eyes
[38:18] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[38:22] their sights
[38:24] and they said one to another
[38:27] they did not our heart ban within us
[38:31] while he talked with us
[38:34] by the way and while he opened to us
[38:38] description
[38:41] we need that kind of Fellowship
[38:44] Lord speak to me speak to my house
[38:48] reveal yourself to me
[38:51] we need to seek moments of sweetness
[38:58] good communion
[39:08] [Music]
[39:22] praise the name of our living God
[39:25] I'm saying time is running fast
[39:28] praise the name of our Lord now let us
[39:32] go to
[39:35] let us share another scripture here
[39:39] in Exodus chapter 4.
[39:43] and then verse 14. a Canada
[39:52] Exodus
[39:55] and then verse 14. so here Moses was
[39:58] giving good excuses
[40:04] they will not hear me you are sending me
[40:08] and then God told him
[40:11] Exodus chapter 4 verse 14.
[40:14] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[40:17] against Moses
[40:19] and he said it is
[40:24] and I know that he can't speak well
[40:29] and also behold the cometh first meeting
[40:35] and when he sees thee
[41:30] when Jacob was meeting Joseph
[41:33] after very many years
[41:38] let us go to Genesis
[41:43] praise the name of our Lord Genesis
[41:45] chapter 46
[41:47] and then we read from verse 4.
[41:52] and Israel took his journey with all
[41:55] that he had and came to Bathsheba and
[41:57] offered sacrifices unto the god of his
[42:00] father
[42:01] Isaac Israel
[42:13] and God spoken to Israel in the visions
[42:15] of the night and saying Jacob Jacob and
[42:19] said here am I
[42:27] oh no
[42:30] and he said I am God the god of thy
[42:34] father fear not go down into Egypt for I
[42:38] will they are make of thee a great
[42:41] nation now your guarantee he is
[42:51] I'll go down with thee into Egypt and I
[42:55] also surely bring thee up again and
[42:59] Joseph shall put his hand upon Thine
[43:01] Eyes
[43:13] what an assurance from God
[43:17] praise the name of Allah Jacob seeking
[43:20] God
[43:21] before he would go to Egypt and then the
[43:24] lord gave him an assurance
[43:26] that I will be with you and I will
[43:29] multiply
[43:30] and even Joseph whom you are seeking
[43:33] children he was going to touch your eyes
[43:38] what an encouragement and the Lord would
[43:41] desire to encourage us
[43:43] he likes to encourage so when we come
[43:47] into Fellowship
[43:49] let us have sweet fellowships
[43:58] and you know Fellowship as we say
[44:02] means communion
[44:04] means communication
[44:07] means distribution or contributions
[44:14] means Association
[44:19] so each of us has a path to play
[44:24] praise the name of Allah each of us has
[44:28] a part to play now in fast Korean
[44:30] Corinthians
[44:44] the scripture says
[44:47] God is faithful
[44:50] by whom you were called unto the
[44:54] fellowship
[44:56] of his son Jesus Christ
[45:00] so we have been called into this
[45:03] Fellowship
[45:04] of our Lord Jesus Christ what does it
[45:07] mean we have been called to be part of
[45:11] the body okay
[45:15] First Corinthians chapter 12
[45:17] says we are members of one body
[45:22] so depending on what kind of party
[45:26] let your path contribute because
[45:31] Fellowship is sharing Fellowship is
[45:36] contributing Fellowship is participating
[45:40] praise the name of Allah so each of us
[45:43] when we come
[45:44] let us be praying let let us be
[45:48] meditative you know about the word of
[45:51] God and you know what the Lord you
[45:54] desire the Lord to do
[45:56] and let every joint Supply
[45:59] praise the name of our Lord let us all
[46:02] of us be willingness
[46:07] like brother Brandon I'm saying we are
[46:10] all leaks of fire so when we come
[46:13] together then we have a bigger fire she
[46:17] call me praise the name of us so each
[46:20] joint should Supply let us go to First
[46:24] Corinthians
[46:27] praise the name of Allah each of our
[46:30] joints should supplies
[46:33] praise the name of Allah
[46:38] that's verse 25.
[46:41] later that there should be no Schism in
[46:45] the body but that the members should
[46:47] have the same care one for another
[46:52] movie
[46:59] and whether one members suffer all
[47:02] members suffer with it or one member be
[47:05] honored all members Rejoice with it is
[47:18] now are you the body of Christ and the
[47:21] members in particular
[47:24] Christ
[47:27] praise the name of Allah so every part
[47:30] should participate
[47:33] praise the name of our Lord and then we
[47:35] can have that kind of sweet Fellowship
[47:38] foreign
[48:09] lesbian
[48:13] the Bible says
[48:16] the cup of blessing which we bless is it
[48:19] not the communion of the blood of Christ
[48:22] the bread which we break is it not the
[48:26] communion of the body of Christ is
[48:34] true
[48:36] um
[48:41] praise the name of Allah like we have in
[48:44] communion tonight
[48:45] we are going to share governor
[48:50] of the body of Christ when we come to
[48:53] church right now what are we doing we
[48:56] are sharing of the world
[48:59] praise the name of Allah so then he says
[49:01] here the cup of blessings
[49:06] is it the communion of the blood of
[49:09] Christ
[49:12] and then what does the blood stand for
[49:16] the spirit the Holy Spirit
[49:20] and then he says the bread which we
[49:23] break is it not the communion of the
[49:27] body of Christ
[49:29] so the body stands for words
[49:35] so whenever we come into Fellowship
[49:39] let us seek that the presence of the
[49:42] Holy Spirit
[49:43] comes down in our hearts even as the
[49:47] word is shared
[50:49] and then
[51:19] now let us finish with second
[51:22] Corinthians chapter six
[51:26] second Corinthians chapter six
[51:28] and then read in verse 14.
[51:31] the Bible says be not an equally yoked
[51:36] together with unbelievers for what
[51:39] Fellowship has righteousness without
[51:41] righteousness
[51:50] and what communion has light with
[51:53] darkness
[51:57] and what conquered as Christ with
[51:59] failure or what part are they that
[52:02] Believers with an Infidel era
[52:05] crystals
[52:13] when we receive Christ in our hearts we
[52:17] have accepted that fellowship and our
[52:20] fellowship with Christ should always be
[52:23] continuous
[52:25] praise and the name of Allah should
[52:27] always be continued no wonder the
[52:30] scripture read in first John chapter one
[52:33] and say that we have fellowship with one
[52:36] another and our fellowship is with the
[52:40] father
[52:41] it should be a continuous Fellowship but
[52:45] areas of unrighteousness
[52:48] things of Darkness come and this thought
[52:52] that Fellowship
[52:56] they come and disrupt that Fellowship so
[53:00] you cannot commune with Christ
[53:04] so then you need to get out of those
[53:06] kind of areas
[53:08] that disrupt The Fellowship of the Holy
[53:11] Spirit you need to avoid those kind of
[53:14] things
[53:17] bitterness
[53:21] you know they grieve the Holiness so
[53:25] then you get time for
[53:49] we need to seek sweetness and have that
[53:52] sweet time of Fellowship
[53:56] the sweetness of Fellowship we cannavity
[54:00] at church
[54:03] as a family and then you can have it
[54:06] also as an individual
[54:08] praise the name of Allah
[54:10] and when you're in the sweet Fellowship
[54:13] of the Holy Spirit
[54:14] you know praise the name of our Lord the
[54:17] Bible says that Angels coming down
[54:21] ascending and descending praise the name
[54:24] of our Lord just coming down to
[54:26] sweetness
