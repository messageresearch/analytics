[Music] [Music] thank you yes sir I've got the wedding garmentor pressure sovereign [Music] I'm not so I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and I trust that all is well with you amen amen it's not been so easy but the Lord makes everything possible and I trust that the Lord will speak to us this morning amen there is a quote I want to give you as before we get into the reading of the scripture is in the mess that glorified Jesus he says and in here there is all Motors on this side all that side men are influenced by one side this side comes from God and this side comes from the devil now let's just take it a great conglomeration of Darkness [Music] and divisiveness of this world everyone in a while you'll see a little white spots amen that's a Christian like a light in the middle of a great Darkness it says once in a while you see a white spot and it says that is a Christian who lives the life of a light now those that are in darkness are influenced from beneath those that are lights are influenced from above now when you leave either one of these now why we live here on Earth every one of us is influenced by a spiritual World while we are here on Earth especially those who have heard from their fear facts the Holy Spirit speaks to them and they are influence from Baba and then those who are darkness in their form of life they are also influenced from beneath bonavascript occupancy so you cannot be here whether you are a saint or a sinner without an influence from a spiritual world so you better know where your influence comes from amen amen either from above or from below so my prayer is that I get born again and then I keep hearing from the spiritual every single day of my life one day at a time to overcome the weaknesses of the flesh amen amen so uh let's stand up then and get in the scripture reading here we are continuing with uh our Bridge studies we saw the life before the bridge last time before the bridge amen that was looking at the conduct and character of Lord this year so uh we stopped at a spot when I promised to speak about the nakedness in Lord this year is a naked age and once you almost want to go naked honestly they are having an influence is so we pray that the Lord may be gracious that we may not reflect Lord this year but that we may reflect the Bride of Jesus Christ who is fully adorned in the world so we shall go to the Book of Revelation chapter 3 verse 17. amen amen foreign [Music] are you awaited this year had one Assumption of herself but the reality was to the contrary church so today we want to look at what nakedness foreign [Music] Souls naked Souls our souls need to be dressed this year they did not understand the dream it was dealing with with the Lord the master was talking to the spirit man and Lord this year was giving a natural confidence of herself a natural testimony so they were not flowing on the submarines so while they thought they were dressed because they will come to church and their thinking the master was looking at another form of dresses so they were naked amen so today we are continuing with Christ in the bridge that's where we are working from now he said that they need a trap a white trained man because is the fruit of the spirit the character that the word produces but the absence of that character is what the holy spirit is calling the shame of thy nakedness was not only naked of white training but they were not conscious of their nakedness amen praise the Lord amen so this white trainment is literally the dress the scripture says see that overcomes the same shall be closed with right right when you go through the scriptures you find the 24 Elders were seen in white trainers seated around the throne in Revelations is the dressing that Christ prefers for his brother but in Revelation 19. we see that the white Reign men granted by Grace amen is granted and why for the frightening is the righteousness of the Saints so we are granted because our righteousness is his righteousness that is made manifest by the fruit that we Bear yes Abraham's righteousness was imputed by faith in the world because faith [Music] it comes forth with a causative anointing through the seven churches the church was the hiding of power for the love amen amen it was seven homes to the land and in Revelation 19. they are called the armies which were in heaven amen that is the Church of Jesus Christ and these were dressed in the character of the world in Revelation 1914. the scripture says and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses so we want to go through the uh concept of the government because Lord this year could not be any of those who are called the armies of the Lord because they were naked Souls they were not dressed in the garments of the reviewed words because that's the only way they could be the hiding of power because the lamb had them seven ohms and Horn is the power of the Beast of an animal against [Music] he says for we know that if our Catholic House of this stuff that were dissolved now Paul is talking about this house he says if it is we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens now let me show you how you describe yourself you say oh I have hurt my foot is that right you can say this my body now that means there is somebody who possesses that body there is somebody who has hurt his food and that's somebody who lives in this body and therefore Paul calls him this body here a house to that somebody who draws on thyself but once this body falls dead then that house has been told yeah so I want you to see Paul describing you and the real you is the man who lives in that body that's why you have this body to yourself as a house so he says when these bodies are told we have another house but it's not it's now again give us another reference as you know the spiritual bodies being aprils that's the one which covers our nakedness didn't have the word it was referred to as naked if you don't stand in the world the scripture refers your soul as a naked song If so be that being closed we shall not be found in naked impossible so it's the faith in this message that creates the Garment for the soul that the garments it is so let's now fall back to Adam in the creation in Genesis the Bible says and God said let us make man in our image and let them have dominion over the fish [Music] which makes you a living [Applause] [Music] these are the chronological patterns as things followed amen he says these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created without wondering in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of valency I want you to understand now going up to it again Genesis 1. Adam has been created but Genesis 2. the scripture says there was not a man to kill the ground so you cannot tell the ground as a spirit the only way you can till the ground is if you have been given a body to leave are you together with me so notice Genesis as opposed to Genesis Genesis speaks about the creation of the spiritual man who wanted the man to till the ground and mad for him he's calling that body a house so God made the house for the spirit of this house here is the one that can tell you the ground seven and the Lord God from the man of the Dust of the grounds the breath of life and man become a living Soul um are you together with me now in Genesis it was a creation in Genesis it was forming and Magic amen amen so now let's look at what brother Branham says here now in the beginning when God made Man In His Image the first man Adam was a man like a god yes he was a spiritual man then we later on we find after he had met Man In His Image there was no man to kill the soul so he put man in frame senses to contact his athletes and then he says that's where a man fell away a body of five senses so the body here is your enemy it's your enemy normal level that's where you fell from so the Divine spirit that Adam was in Genesis 1. was dressed in a natural body but that natural body cannot live without a human spirit without a natural spirits of the word of the Lord for Israel says the Lord which stretches forth the heavens the foundation of the Earth the spirit of man within him are you together with me what is it so now he forms man but then he forms also the spirit of Man Too this is what he says in the message now is it not you know he's talking about the body now he says inside of that is the spirit which you become when you are born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into it that spirit is of the worldly nature because it's not given from God but it was permitted by God so we are taking this teaching here in a slopes so that we can understand the kind of nakedness that Lord is so going by the career chapter 12 verse 1. it describes that when God finished forming the heavens and the Earth he formed man in the dust of the earth and also formed the spirit of man now let me tell you that was the only way Eve could fall because of the human spirit is just a natural Spirit there is nothing good about that the flesh came with this human spirit and this Natural Spirit is a free moral ages [Applause] because there was a part of him that was in the original image of God that was the difference and that's why Adam could not fall so far he says and Adam was not received but the woman being deceived he was interested so there is a difference here between Adam and Eve that's the difference that is making the subject today was a byproductive amen of the body of others Adam amen Amina you know did not come direct from God from the body of Adam amen and that's why she failed in order to redeem his wife [Applause] the same with Christ [Applause] amen amen what Adam did was the Redemption he could not fall in the original Spirit which was the nature of God amen amen so he could not fall yes amen amen but then when the woman fell and he went in then that's when he lost the glory of God [Music] to redeem his wife the church okay so before the fall because which body was Natural Body Soul and Spirit welcome back he was a more glorified nature of beings and she needed the protection of others to stay perfect okay are you together with me one is just like we are Body Soul and spirits and we need the constant protection of the holy spirit [Applause] for us to stay perfect therefore all Humanity to be under the same uniform which is born Body Soul and Spirits a bride that needs the second Adam um to maintain our perfection foreign but the more white you believe and exercise is the more your body your Symphony gets manifest [Applause] so each time you are studying the books you are listening to the text at the same time you are meditating on the world you're coming to church you are cementing your body together amen you cannot be referred to as naked because the Lord this year but we are not rejecting the words I believe I will always say man where he really feel this is a joy turning part to My of your friends and don't be you know our amen should be a healthy one I mean amen amen I'm hungry person can speak like a dying person that somebody was fed on the world and it's full enough so Christo had to go into the culture of sin and death and this death and Resurrection won the victory over death and the sin nurturing amen amen and now in the new body gambo [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign for weed that in this Tabernacle a command foreign [Music] foreign now around the soul we get another ring we can call the spirit with your quest [Music] bend the outermost is the body temperature so when he blesses the senses in the middle Rings he seems to be blessing them to the soul but actually after his correction I will find more work long Assam we find out that actually that's what the spirit is supposed to be because there is the spirit of man which makes the body alive amen Amina and there's the spirit of God amen amen those are two different things I think you understand so the prophet says now in here there is one two three four five five attributes to the soul but actually later he makes us know he met the spirit now you want to write them down the first one is Imagination the second is consciousness and the third one is memory and the fourth is the fifth one is so he comes later to clarify and he says no outside this man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has five senses to that body amen Amina then he calls them body I mean without that you can't touch the body that's the only way you have to the body amen now that is the evil one on the outside would you better know your movie he always wants to see he wants to touch five senses and there's five senses they are enemies of faith that's where the enemity of faith is because we pray for you but you are still feeling and now you start saying I'm not here and yet what you still have is just the effects native one of what the disease has done but the life of that disease has been killed in Jesus name so that outside one is an enemy of faith amen Amina then he continues to say now inside of that is the spirit yeah which you become when you are born in the earth and the Breath of Life is that spirit is a worldly nature because it was permitted by God there is five senses so life of God does not stay in the flesh amen Amina are you together with it what is it and the life of the spirit does not step in your human Spirit where there is reasoning imagination I know these are the things the life of God says that the center in the soul foreign amen Amina they decided says don't smoke and the body says I will not eat the food says don't go to a disco and then the outside says the woman doesn't dress like that the body says to the master who dwells at the same time hallelujah praise God amen amen Life Begins amen Amina I'll give you another quote here that little inside of the inside [Music] that's where you start which is your soul amen amen then come from that then the spirit you know uh foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign you cannot God cannot share your throne that the fountain is Flowing bitter water and Sweet Water no God doesn't do that when light comes to God are you together with me when the theophan attaches the body questions begins amen Amina you can you cannot share there is a governor praise God he only has to be be that particular seed that cannot be said the evidence we shall see your dresses changed if the dressing is not changing then your soul is the naked because what is on the inside outside is going to reflect if God is on the inside there are certain things that will begin to refresh now let me tell you something first the challenge in the garden from the middle room which has five senses [Music] you're beautiful thank you you know what is happening she's contemplating at every statement that's where there is Imagination where is the conscience then reason foreign [Music] [Applause] if I become the wife amen you see that's imagination he has said a few words and now the words of sun imagination begins you say well we shall talk about it you get home it has settled in the memory you begin reasoning the pros and the cones [Applause] [Applause] very far foreign that I have chewed this up here and that's why I'm The Sinner today Jesus says that could not be possible yes because it enters not into the heart but on to a belly and goeth into the drought packing or mix that I'm like yeah um that which comes out of the man that defiles the man is saying that that which proceeds from the spirits from the human spirit and settles itself into the soul is what the files foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] the evil nature to see them from within the serpentine is what is and eventually committed listen to First John chapter 2 verse 16. he says for all Baptists in the world not some of waters in the world but all that is in the world the last of the flesh the last of the eyes of pride of life oh that is last fight under those three things the last of the flesh the last of the eyes the pride of life that is not of the father oh that is of the world you start looking at this theme and then you go to the arapa profession and you know those things kind of get on the east side and we start seeing a sister doing cat works cut work Tumblr they are so smart they design a skirts that will not allow your legs to part when you walk it is all that is in the world the last of the flesh the pride of life and the pride I'm in the the the the the the the the uh less of the eyes is not of God Amen I mean the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life are all activities of the human spirit and that's what the serpent used against even the garden but you can shut all that out yeah amen Amina so we close the channel by feeding on the world now Satan again uses those three against Christ on the mountains but Jesus victory was sealing the channel by the word amen that's how you close the chain of your human Spirit by saying it is Jesus is tempted by the devil yes he overcame the personal Temptations [Music] which was the last foreign so the human spirit is the nature that must die nobody knows in order for it to come under the influence of the Holy ghosts amen Amina so the prophet says we know what the spirit is it controls the flesh praise the Lord he says we know what the spirit is and we know pretty what the spirit is it controls the flesh let's go to Romans chapter six I enjoying the world amen amen Romans 6 16 weather of sin unto death or obedience that one becomes your master if you yield yourself to sin at the same is unbelief then you become a servant man your focus of sin after this so Eve jump to the fortification like Lord this is the absence of the world is the nakedness of the church so when Eve jumped over the fortification of the world she was as naked yeah and she cannot be able to overcome the devil that way so Lord this is the kingdom of God the Bible says she was wretched meaning that she was enduring toys and troubles simply because the Comfort had worked out foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] but when the devil came I started he was an alternative child and I never told them if you eat of the fruits that's where the problem came there was an alternative challenge knowing good and evil before that methods now she had tested and now she had no power but yeah huh are you together [Applause] I don't know today we've been given the child of good brilliant we've been given the child of God but I don't know why you want to open up all this other channels you read this literature you read that literature religion Catholics amen I mean that was the problem of ease human spirit ambitious amen I mean let's go to Romans chapter 7. understand the channel that he failed to control Romans 7 8 says but sin taking occasion by the Commandment wrote in me all manner of Consciousness so when it opens up channels of lust for this channel so this is what Paul says different cravings and longing for everything that's forbidden so after the fall the son of evil became stronger foreign [Applause] Africa the condition of the Soul you put on this video up to you a Christian will reveal her body but each time your desire is to unveil your flesh is [Applause] it positively becomes the nature of the spirit because the nature of the spirit defines the kind of soul that you are when by knowledge amen amen when in the wilderness Iran cause the people to jump the fortifications that the people were naked for everyone amongst their enemies cannot have the confidence [Applause] he stays away from the government amen Amina so any true child of God is soul that is to be part of fellas God gave us Grace let us look at the king calling a party amen amen and look at this naked guests he had the desire to be part of the party Matthew chapter 22. then says it to his servants the wedding is ready but today which were beaten were not worthy just look at the calling of Lord this year to the marriage of the Lamb he says those who are bidened to come on to the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and together together all as many as they found both good and bad and the wedding was finished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests when the king came in to see the guests had not a garmentor he was naked at the wedding he had no wedding garments are you together with him so we are beaten to come to the wedding but then we need to prepare that's why we come here to sow our wedding garments because out there the king came to see the guests and found a man who had no wedding gown and he says that to him friend how come is not having a wedding garment and they were speechless you know the Lord hard Cuts towards him and he says praise the Lord so the Lord does not use rough speech in expressing his displeasure towards somebody who fails to use the garments of the world that's the way the Lord Works amen amen he gives you the truth it's up to you really which side you take because you are a free moral agent he is not coming here to threaten you thank you he says it's not necessarily funny it's not necessary referring to you know God's children and call them all kinds of names for them to be converted this gospel is for the election day foreign that's what he told him Where Art Thou come from then say to the king to the servants Oh Praise amen that's verse 13 now binding hand and foot and take him away and cast him into the outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nothing because he had no Gamers of the world therefore he was bound knowledge the players are not thrown out in Canada taking the wife amen when you just don't take the word you are binding yourself out of the Fellowship of the Saints this man desire to be part of the wedding um towards the garments of the world and presenting it in Truth by I mean presenting the word in its truth is The Binding of the people that would have wanted to be part of us that will be bad amen Amina so let us look at one a little bit into the ministry of the the bro I mean of in the bridge amen I'm finishing soon praise the Lord I've never preached the Sunday morning service in the condition where I feel like yeah amen amen he says you know bro this is Brother Branham now oh no I hope those are he will Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and the dress is bright in the cloth of the world and for his righteousness let me stand that day and say Behold the Lamb of God are you together with the man that's the Brother program he says to dress his prize you dress them with words of the world so the bridge is the preparation for the bread of the world so brother the response [Music] foreign for when they are dressing the lamps and so in the videos [Music] to take a personal responsibility we better take inventory it might be real later than we think might be would wake up someday and see that we've missed something be careful don't let it pass over you amen amen as an individual let us take inventory how is the spirit of God in our house [Applause] foreign [Applause] in the blood I mean [Applause] yeah let's cry for the pasta this morning get up on our feet as you sing the same song foreign [Applause] where are your garments supposedly are you through [Music] who are you [Music] alone [Music] [Music]
