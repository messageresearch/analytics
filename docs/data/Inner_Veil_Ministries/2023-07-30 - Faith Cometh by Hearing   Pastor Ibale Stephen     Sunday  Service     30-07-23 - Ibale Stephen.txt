unfailing world that has been given to us in this time amen amen let's turn to Romans chapter 10. so God willing uh is going to be brother Jones Day we shall give him the money and then he's going to share with us on the world and then he comes back in the evening to do uh you know um to do his voice of good work amen amen so let us all be here and be an encouragement to him he is one of the ministers now in the Nairobi church and is going all over the country as he does his voice of good work so that's the ministry so it will be a blessing to have him with us amen amen you see when it stands in front of this church it is something so small compared to what the church is back home but where two or three are gathered together in my name amen amen so Romans chapter 10 verse 17. example let's pray before we read precious Sovereign to find certain area foreign so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now the scripture doesn't say fearing from the world you see it is deeper than that so as the message teaches only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to the Earth and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church so when we say a messenger to the true church then there must be also a false chance so we are not talking about local churches now but we are talking about the true church which is the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ he speaks for God and by Revelation to the churches both true and false so the messenger speaks to both churches [Applause] [Applause] because each individual foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when we talk talk about fearing we're talking Amen in the spiritual aspect it's totally a deeper understanding so each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear yeah what the spirit is saying by weight of the messenger it's broadcast to Allah according to Revelation because the scripture says meaning that there will be served that will be regarded as they do not have the ears that can listen privilege if you can hear the voice of the spirit you need to give thanks to later [Applause] who is the group getting their Collective revelation foreign cause the mouth to feed with [Applause] [Applause] so it is to catch the revelation of who you've always been from before the foundation of the world this Revelation cannot come by intellectuals it comes by the holy spirit amen amen it's god making it possible for you to catch the Revelation who you've always Foundation you get under the influence of your fearful is you know who knows all things when Jesus came into this Dimension he had come through his fearful and then he had come through and when he came here [Music] and we come into the flesh so when we come into the flesh we disconnect from what we wear before the foundation of the world we cannot remember who we were looking like before the foundation of the world he says to be tried and tested amen amen so there was a man his name was John he was perfect he was right here went through moments of trouble and once you get into moments it's the devil trying to touch this flesh so that he can reach yourself and destroyed thank you so everyone whoever you are when you get into moments of traffic there is always a hard feeling on the inside [Applause] you are saying oh God have mercy oh God help me and you know he got through the this depressed I know but one time I removed God came down to him to remind him that is not a product of Power are you together with me when you get under that stress when you feel you cannot go anywhere amen amen God will always come down to remind you of Who You Are because you didn't come through yourself amen so when we hear the words [Music] are you together with me you get under the influence of your future who knows all things starts breaking forth as Revelation to you are you together with me it breaks forth to you that's why brother brought himself faith is a revelation it's not your man to understand in a revelation that has been given to the inner man so now when you catch that Revelation everything comes to you as a substance a spiritual substance which is in another dimension but waiting to before are you together with me when is it amen amen so in the message there is this America said that we welcome he says then after you recognize what again the very word of God as ego food then you leave you have then been formed into living image of the Living God you had enough you had what you heard from yourself [Applause] [Applause] and hearing by way of yourself are you together with me that's the perfect Faith it's not your common sense but it is something I make it like the Brotherhood here last week he talked about the fall yeah the phone has a SIM card and this SIM card here it connects this phone to the main station Eddie the main station [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's not speaking to your ears Hallelujah [Music] does not apply into human mind is totally far away from there are you together with me because it is a revelation [Applause] when you look at Abraham he doubted about the promise [Applause] about the promise of his own so faith is not positive thinking it's not that because Paul Wanga Paolo who says faith is a revelation because you know it is speaking to you Hallelujah which is so that you can be able to hear him is the one who came down and he says by faith Abraham by faith but if we read ourselves I sing that to us we would not have looked at that as Faith now remember when Peter was in prison and the Saints came together to pray for the release of people we were praying by that Faith are you together with me and then finally the angel came down released and when the girl wrote and looked through the kingdom amen amen foreign [Music] are you together with me what is it so Faith that's how quick it is that it's a supernatural you cannot feel it in your mind you cannot feel it in your understanding are you together with me so I want to declare to you today that you have faith Hallelujah everyone here but your man has faith I know quickly otherwise you would not be here in a discernment life one time the Holy Spirit movement and you pointed to a certain woman yes and then she started looking around and she says you right there amen and then brother Branham who is Seated on a pink pillow [Applause] she got surprised you didn't know you had that much face did you oh my trading and then he says faith is unconscious foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it is something that absolutely you have amen it is something that you possess and what is it it is the evidence of things that you hoped for whoever is the evidence of things but you do not have as yet [Applause] you have the authority of God I don't want to say that you have it [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] That was supposed to surround that event foreign area [Applause] so that jam of life is what God speaks too and that's what the Holy Spirit through the seventh Church [Music] foreign foreign [Music] so as you feed with your mouth to feed the natural man you feed by the a of the spirit to feed you in America we said this is my hand this is my hair then who are you there is somebody on this side my name is this body so when God foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] that will tell him because he was speaking to Judas also so he turned to the truth we also go away and they say that to whom shall we go you have the words so it is this year that catches the teaching of the spirit flesh and blessed I mean reveal this to you let you know a good teacher [Applause] he can teach it but unless you got that you cannot catch it speaks from behind the veil are you again amen he's in the third Court in the holy of holies because he has dedicated himself to feed God's children and as we come to church we come dressed in our priesthood governments ready to step forward into the holy of holies amen amen and join with the ministry there is no more results together we may feel because the Holy Spirit speaks to the message from The Messengers you start catching Revelations [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I don't know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not from [Applause] Supernatural mechanism foreign are you together with me when is it yes sir by the ears of the five senses and we feed the human intellectually is we can't be smart enough to explain it but that's not what Romans 10 17 he says Romans 10 17. is deeper than audio here foreign Faith cometh by hearing okay and hearing by the word of God so the seed chain of God in your soul is The Passion of God but you hear back amen amen so the faith is another type of phrase it's different from all we ever renderings of faith hahaha praise God this one is a revelation and it's unconscious
