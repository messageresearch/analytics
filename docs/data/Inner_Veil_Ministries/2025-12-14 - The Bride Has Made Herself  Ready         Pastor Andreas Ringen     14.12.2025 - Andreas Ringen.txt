So when our brother comes here to minister, don't remain on the perimeters, but come in the center. in the anointing. And you say, "Lord, this is my burden. That is my burden." And I want to leave it there. Amen. Amen. Before the blood before, I mean before the, you know, Calvary, John, Peter, and James, they were on the perimeters. that after Calvary, when the blood has been poured, we have the ability to come to the center and experience the resurrection power where Elijah and Moses were in the presence when the Lord was unfolding his glory. So when our brother ministers, that's what we need to do this morning. How many of you have got needs this morning? Take them to the Lord. Leave them there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we are very privileged once again to have our friend brother Andreas Ringan [applause] to be here again.

As we as we stand, uh I just have something on my heart to say put it up here. That's good. Something on my heart and I want to uh um speak on a on a subject this morning. The bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So are we ready? &gt;&gt; So we understand the bride has made herself ready. Are we ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn the take the scripture. We want to go to Revelation 19. And uh we want to start read one we read one scripture &gt;&gt; and then we pray and then we read some more scriptures. &gt;&gt; Revelation 19 and watch very carefully how it is introduced here. Amen. Revelation 197 to9 Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready. And to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. And he said unto me, "Write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said unto me, And he said unto me, "These are the true sayings of God. Those who are called to the marriage supper of the lamb. They are the true sayings of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us pray together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we are so grateful that we are together again. And Father, we just ask you now, may you come and take this service. speak to our hearts. I pray father take the minister take the thoughts may you direct them father and may only things come out &gt;&gt; which you want to be said and father all that is listening here sitting here and listening may they have an open ear to hear what the spirit want to say to the church it father all to your own and to your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You as you take your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I [clears throat] think it's so wonderful. I I I I wonder if you have if you have listened very carefully to that scripture. The Bible actually here makes makes a little difference between the marriage and the marriage supper. As we have read that the bride for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made us have ready. So there's a readiness for the marriage of the lamb. Amen. Amen. So the marriage of the lamb is come. And then we have read in verse 9. And blessed are they that are that are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb. Amen. Amen. Amen. so ready for the marriage and then invited and called to the marriage supper. Now who will be there at the marriage supper? Who will be there at the marriage supper? Only those who were ready for the marriage and the prophet would say and I think that's so wonderful. He would say that out of pruning his words. Listen very carefully how the prophet said. He said in the day the son of man will be revealed to join the church to the head to unite. The marriage of the bride. Amen. Amen. The bridegroom call will come right through this. Son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together. The church has to be the word. He is the word and the two unite together. To do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. Jesus son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh amongst us and will make the his word so real and let's unite the church and him as one then she'll go home to the wedding supper she is already united then we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage. So the marriage takes place here on earth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? The marriage takes place here on earth. &gt;&gt; The invisible union takes place. And as we have read Revelation 19, the marriage of the lamb is come. Watch very carefully. Not the marriage supper, but the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was granted to her that she should array in fine linen which is the righteousness of the saints. Keep that a little bit in in in mind, &gt;&gt; what she's clothed with, what her readiness is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as she is ready for marriage, now it's a question, are we ready also for the rapture, which is going to the wedding supper? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you follow? &gt;&gt; So ready for the marriage. The marriage takes place here on earth. And then we go to the wedding supper which is by by the rapture. Is it right? We are raptured. So the marriage supper takes place in another dimension. &gt;&gt; As the marriage takes place here on earth. Amen. This is what we have seen. The son of man has come down and the bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question? Can I ask you a question? Do you feel ready? &gt;&gt; I must be honest with you. I seldom feel ready. I seldom feel ready. You understand that? To be ready and to feel ready is two different things. Many times I don't feel ready. You know why? because I'm living in a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; And this body of flesh still needs redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't trust your feeling. Don't trust your feeling. Don't depend on your feeling. Depend on what the Lord has done for you. JUST DEPEND ON WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU. AMEN. AMEN. And the bride has prepared herself. And she was she was it was given unto her that she would array in fine linen. The fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. Amen. So you get that. So we the marriage takes place here on earth. That's why the son of man was manifested in human flesh again. And this is brother Bham says this is God uniting. There's an invincible union taking place. You and him become one. AND THEN WE GO TO THE MARRIAGE SUPPER. Is that right? We go to the marriage supper. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IN THE MEANTIME, OUR BODIES WILL be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, are we READY FOR THE FOR THE MARRIAGE? The bride has made us ready. THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB is come. Are we ready for marriage? When we ready for marriage, then we are ready for the wedding supper. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care how we feel. As you get older, many times your feelings are betraying you more. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You feel tired. You feel sick. You feel worried. You cannot handle things so good anymore. So don't trust your feelings. Trust what the Lord has done for you. Don't trust your feelings. Your feelings don't represent you before God. YOUR FEELINGS IS NOT PRESENTING you before God BECAUSE GOD IS NOT influenced by your feelings. SO YOU YOU'RE NOT PRESENTED BEFORE God in behalf of your feelings. YOU ARE PRESENTED BEFORE GOD. AND WHAT KIND OF attitude you have? &gt;&gt; What kind of attitude you have? &gt;&gt; Is that right? And &gt;&gt; we will see that a little later. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "Your attitude presents you before God, not your feelings. I'M SO HAPPY &gt;&gt; THAT MY feelings don't represent me. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD THAT MY ATTITUDE REPRESENTS ME. SO GOD KNOWS WHAT I WANT TO DO. HE HE KNOWS MY HEART AND THAT REPRESENTS ME BEFORE HIM. That represents me before God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So as we speak uh ready for marriage WE WE ASK THE QUESTION ready for translation because AS WE ARE READY FOR THE marriage &gt;&gt; and are we ready for the marriage? &gt;&gt; THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE ALREADY. &gt;&gt; THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE ALREADY CHURCHMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; The marriage takes place here on earth. YOU ARE UNITED RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR ATTITUDE. What do you do with what the messenger said about you and all that matters AS IT WAS WITH MARY? WHAT DID SHE SAY? And be to me according to your words. I DON'T CARE HOW SHE FELT. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE FELT. I WILL ASK HER when I meet her how she would have felt. But it doesn't matter HOW YOU FEEL, IF YOU FEEL GOOD OR IF YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD. AMEN. Your attitude presents you before God. AND MARY SAID IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION. She said IT BE TO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORDS. HALLELUJAH. AND GOD HONORED THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD HONORED THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's go to first Corinthians. We want to read a story. First Corinthians. makes it very very more clear. &gt;&gt; That makes it a little bit more clear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; First Corinthians &gt;&gt; the sixth chapter. Let's read that first. &gt;&gt; So that we really understand to lay a little background for what we want to say. KNOW YE NOT THAT UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL NOT inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminates, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. And [snorts] such were some of you, but ye are washed. But ye are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right? &gt;&gt; So we understand who shall inherit thee the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And now this is now re this is now for believers. Amen. This is now for the true believers coming. Amen. You understand that? Amen. Amen. Only those shall inherit the kingdom. who are washed, who are sanctified, who are justified in the name of Jesus, and by the spirit of our God, &gt;&gt; only those shall inherit the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. ARE YOU WASHED? ARE YOU WASHED? NOT ONLY BY THE WATER, BUT ARE YOU WASHED? BY THE BLOOD OF THE lamb sanctified. AMEN. AND ARE JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. Justified means you have never done it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Luke 18. We want to read another because I needed to do that before to put a a good foundation down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luke 18. This morning we want to go really as far as the Lord leads us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know you see as much as you build a house, it's very important that the foundation is strong enough. is that right that we have a strong foundation where we build on because we are not following fables. &gt;&gt; Okay. Luke 18. Let's read from 9 to 14. AND HE SPAKE THIS PARABLE unto a certain which trusted in themsel that they were righteous and despised others. Vers. Verse 9. You understand? Here were some they were trusted in themselves that they were righteous. And we have read in Revelation, the bride it was given unto her that she would clothe herself, which is the righteousness of the saints. But here were people that trusted in their own righteousness. I TRUST NO ONE HERE this morning trust in his own righteousness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It must be the righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two men went up into the temple to pray. The one a Pharisee and the other a publican. And the Pharisees stood and prayed thus within himself. God, I thank thee that I'm not as the other men extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week. I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican standing a far off would not lift up so much his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, "God, be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man WENT DOWN TO HIS HOUSE justified rather than the other. For everyone that exaltth himself shall be abased, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted. SO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS THIS PUBLICAN HE WENT HOME JUSTIFIED. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT? JUST BECAUSE HE HAD THE right attitude. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh church TO BE READY IS SO DIFFERENT THAN WE THINK. I ASK YOU A QUESTION. WAS THIS MAN, THIS PUBLICAN, was he ready to go home? This publican, HE WENT HOME JUSTIFIED. He was ready to go home. &gt;&gt; COME ON, LET'S WAKE UP. &gt;&gt; The other man, &gt;&gt; the other man that felt good about himself and he prayed and he fasted, WAS HE READY TO GO HOME? &gt;&gt; NO. That's right. I want to let that sink a LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THIS PUBLICAN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT attitude &gt;&gt; went home justified. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. DO &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FELT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS MIND. HE WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT HIS LIFE, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS THAT MAN WENT HOME JUSTIFIED. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh church TO BE READY SO DIFFERENT THAN we think. THAT'S WHY DON'T TRUST YOUR FEELING. IF YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, A CHILD OF GOD, FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CANNOT MISS THE RAPTURE. You cannot MISS THE RAPTURE. REGARDLESS WHERE YOU GO THROUGH, REGARDLESS HOW DEEP YOU ARE, REGARDLESS HOW DOWN YOU ARE, YOU CANNOT MISS THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; What a what a day and hour we living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's take another scripture. &gt;&gt; Let's go to James to James 5. Let's we want to read two verses &gt;&gt; and again as a scripture is beautiful. The scripture is so connected. Hallelujah. The scripture is so connected and I trust we we understand 40 different writers. 40 different writers wrote the Bible over the space of 1,500 years. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's all connected. &gt;&gt; They had no headquarters. headquarter. Their headquarter was God himself. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? NOW HERE James comes. WATCH HOW JAMES COMES. AND WATCH HOW HE CONNECTED WITH THE OLD TESTAMENT. Let's read from 16 to 18. Confess your faults one to THE OTHER AND PRAY for one another that you may be healed. Now listen very carefully. THE EFFECTUAL FE FERENT PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS man avail much. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The effect TO YOUR FAVORITE PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE READ THAT THE BRIDE WAS CLOTHED IN his righteousness. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THE PUBLICAN JUST BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT ATTITUDE went home justified. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER WAS CLOSED IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT HE BECAME CLOSED IN GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS. BECAUSE JUSTIFY means you have never done it in the first PLACE AND ONLY THEN YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS. YES, IT'S NOT YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT if he IF HE GIVES YOU HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, THEN YOU HAVE NEVER DONE IT. YOU STAND RIGHTEOUS. IS IT RIGHT? NOBODY CAN BLAME YOU. NOBODY CAN BLAME YOU. THERE'S NO SIN UPON YOU. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST WASHED IT AWAY. WHITER THAN THE SNOW. THAT MEANS TO BE THAT MEANS TO BE REALLY JUSTIFIED. HALLELUJAH. AND ONLY A TRUE JUSTIFIED PERSON is closed in the righteousness of God. AND THE FEVER PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS man avail much. Listen what? Listen further. Verse 17. &gt;&gt; Is it amazing? Listen, &gt;&gt; I can't do this. &gt;&gt; And I know it's it's still early and so you're awake, right? &gt;&gt; Watch how James &gt;&gt; suddenly brings a character in. &gt;&gt; Give it please again. 17 Elias &gt;&gt; WAS A MAN SUBJECT TO LIKE PASSIONS &gt;&gt; AS we are. That means ELIJAH HAD THE same problems that you and I have. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; AND HE PRAYED EARNESTLY THAT IT MIGHT not rain AND IT RAINED NOT ON THE EARTH BY THE space of 3 years and 6 months. THE PRAYER OF A righteous man, THE FEVER PRAYER, not the symbolic prayer, the fever prayer of a righteous man avail much. LOOK HOW IT'S ALL CONNECTED. THAT MAN PUBLICAN JUST WITH THE RIGHT attitude went home justified. &gt;&gt; We see that a little later. VERY AMAZING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. VERY AMAZING. SO VERY IMPORTANT IS YOUR ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; YOUR ATTITUDE PRESENTS you before God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What attitude do we take this afternoon or this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 18 shows us a MAN THAT WALKTH OUT righteous ready for rapture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say AMEN TO THAT? &gt;&gt; YOU WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE? &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE? &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ELECT SEAT THAT WOULD COME IN? HOW MUCH TIME HE WILL have to prove that he's worthy? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; SHALL WE WAIT ANOTHER 10 YEARS so now he can prove that he's worthy? WHEN THE LAST ONE COMES IN, WHEN THE LAST ONE COMES IN, IT DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG. REMEMBER, as we go there a little later, 2,000 years ago, there was already a last one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know him. HE WAS THAT MAN THAT WAS HANGING AT THE CROSS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There was a man. How do you call him? We call him the sheer. THERE THERE IS THAT MAN THAT WAS HANGING AT the cross. With Jesus together, is that right? With Jesus together, there was someone hanging with him. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And one said, "HEY, IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD, HELP US DO SOMETHING. HELP US FROM THE CROSS. DO IT YOURSELF. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The other one said &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; The other one said, "Hey, &gt;&gt; we deserved our punishment. We have done wrong in our life. We have deserved our punishment. But this man has done nothing wrong. What is it all about attitude?" And then he is asking, &gt;&gt; he's asking, &gt;&gt; he's asking, "Can I find grace? Remember me. Remember me when you come and do YOUR KINGDOM?" JESUS TURNED AROUND AND HE SAID, "TODAY. Today you will be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? WHAT DID THIS MAN DO &gt;&gt; to go? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Jesus said to him, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE LAST ONE, THE LAST [screaming] ONE OF THE OLD DISPENSATION. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? BECAUSE JESUS TOLD HIM, "Today you will be with me in paradise, and I come today." Amen. &gt;&gt; TO TAKE CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE. &gt;&gt; WHEN I GO DOWN TO PARADISE, YOU GO WITH ME TO PARADISE. AND YOU COME TODAY OUT OF PARADISE. COME ON CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Can we believe that? &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS THAT WAS IN PARADISE WHO CAME OUT OF PARADISE. IS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT RIGHT? SO WHAT DID DID THIS MAN DO TO COME AND GO INTO PARADISE? AND ALLOW ME TO SAY &gt;&gt; AND TO BE RAPTURED OUT OF PARADISE. WAS HE READY FOR RAPTURE? WAS HE READY FOR RAPTURE? &gt;&gt; YES, HE WAS. [screaming] JESUS TOLD HIM TODAY YOU WILL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. LET'S GET RID OF OUR OWN IDEAS. WHAT IT means to be ready. THAT MAN WAS READY. HOW? JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE. JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; THAT MAN COULDN'T GO DOWN AND TO PAY ALL HIS DEATH. THE MAN HAD NO TIME ANYMORE TO GO HOME AND SAY SORRY TO ALL THE PEOPLE. JESUS TOLD HIM BECAUSE THAT MAN DIED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE DIED, &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WENT INTO INTO A WRONG PLACE. HE WENT INTO INTO PARADISE. AND AS HIS MEN RUN INTO PARADISE, THAT MAN COULD SAY, "COME ON, I'M THE LAST ONE. YOU'RE COMING INTO PARADISE. PREPARE. PREPARE. HE'S COMING. BECAUSE HE TOLD ME, HE WILL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE." WHY DID JESUS WENT TO PARADISE? Why did Jesus went down to paradise? Why did Jesus go to paradise? Amen. To take the Old Testament saints out of paradise. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The Old Testament saints because they were under the blood of bulls and goats and they died. Then they died. They went to a place called paradise. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not going to paradise. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GO AND WE PASS, WHEN WE DIE, WE HAVE A BODY WAITING. &gt;&gt; We have a body waiting. We don't GO TO PARADISE. WE ARE GOING TO HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO HEAVEN. IN HEAVEN IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE LAST ONE THAT CAME IN THE TIME OF JESUS. &gt;&gt; THE LAST ONE THAT ENTERED PARADISE. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE TODAY? &gt;&gt; WILL come into the fold. What? That will come into the fold. that will come into HOW LONG HOW MUCH TIME WILL HE HAVE. &gt;&gt; SO YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT YOUR WORKS &gt;&gt; THAT MAKES you ready. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR WORK SHOULD BE there of an appreciation of what God has done for you. BUT YOUR WORKS, YOUR effort will never make you ready. NOT YOUR MONEY THAT YOU GIVE TO THE CHURCH MAKES YOU READY. NOTHING YOU CAN DO MAKES MAKES YOU READY. WHAT MAKES ME READY, BROTHER? JUST KEEP [screaming] THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.

Why don't go to the doctor? BUT IF THE DO IF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR, GO WITH ATTITUDE. I am healed already. GO WITH ATTITUDE. THE DOCTOR IS NOT HEALING YOU, BUT HE HELPS YOU ON THE WAY TO your healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; JUST KEEP THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT MAN SAID, HE SAID THAT MAN SAID, "LORD, BE MERCIFUL FOR ME A SINNER." AND HE WENT HOME. &gt;&gt; HE WENT HOME JUSTIFIED. WHY? BECAUSE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. YOU WILL NEVER BE WORTHY. YOU WILL NEVER BE WORTHY TO BE RAPTURED. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED YOU &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU were unworthy. &gt;&gt; GOD GOD'S LOVE IS SO different than human love. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE LAST THING THAT COMES DOWN CAPPING THE WHOLE THING off is divine love. Is that right? It's divine love. And we say that is it okay when I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen divine MOUTH GOD'S love is selective love. &gt;&gt; God loved you when you were still a sinner. Is it is that true? &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN YOU BECOME A BELIEVER GOD LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; God can you not cannot love you more. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT LOVE YOU more and he cannot LOVE YOU LESS. BECAUSE his love is elective. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE A SINNER, WHEN YOU COME OUT OF DENOMINATION, WHEN YOU WERE IN DENOMINATION, GOD LOVED YOU. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE SENT THE TRUTH your way THAT CHOSE HIS LOVE TO YOU. NOW, WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF DENIMATION, WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE WRONG THING, God didn't love you more. Human love knows, helio love knows more and less. Agap love DOES NOT KNOW MORE OR LESS. AS PARENTS we have we have felio love. THAT'S WHY WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE performing we love them more. When our CHILDREN DO MISTAKES BE HONEST. MANY TIMES YOU love them a little less. NOT SO GOD. Not God. God's [screaming] love. &gt;&gt; HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WERE A SINNER. HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU BECAME A SAINT. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU MORE WHEN YOU BECOME A SAINT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT LOVE YOU MORE BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S LOVE. GOD CANNOT LOVE YOU LESS. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD DAY, WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, WHEN YOU FALL, GOD CANNOT LOVE you less. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember our brother Brham, how the devil could get him because this mighty God was not unveiled. BUT THE MIGHTY GOD IS UNVEILED NOW. Remember when BROTHER RAM HAD THE DARKEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE? BECAUSE HE MADE A MISTAKE, RIGHT? HE DIDN'T GO WITH THE PENTECOSTALS. His wife died. His kids died. &gt;&gt; GOD EVEN CLOSED THE CURTAIN. COME ON. RIGHT. SO THERE CAN BE REALLY DARK MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE. When you make mistakesh WHEN YOU MAKE MISTAKES, &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES TERRIBLE MISTAKES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND AS GOD WAS DRAWING THE CURTAIN, AMEN. I had many times in my life I had the feeling the impression &gt;&gt; God pulled the curtain &gt;&gt; and it depressed me &gt;&gt; because I thought God don't love me anymore till I found out that God cannot love me less. Remember [applause] brother Brandham said and the devil came to him AND ALL THE THINGS SATAN TOLD him was the truth. WHAT DO YOU DO IF Satan is telling you the truth? HE TOLD BROTHER BRANDHAM ALL YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE THIS AND GOD NOW DON'T LISTEN TO YOU ANYMORE BROTHER SAID HE TOLD ME THE TRUTH &gt;&gt; SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE DEVIL THROWS THE TRUTH AT BROTHER BRHAM &gt;&gt; ACCEPTED. WHAT DID JESUS DO? &gt;&gt; A Satan. A Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan throw the truth at him. &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH OF IT IS WRITTEN. &gt;&gt; WAS IT IS WRITTEN THE TRUTH? SO THERE THE DEVIL SAID &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE DEVIL &gt;&gt; WAS TAKING THE TRUTH AND PUTTING HIM TO JESUS. &gt;&gt; What did Jesus do? &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT IS ALSO WRITTEN. YES. IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT GOD LOVES ME. YES. IS ALSO TRUE. &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, IT'S A TRUTH THAT GOOD PO GOD PULLED THE CURTAIN. YES, IS A TRUTH I HAVE MADE MIS THEY MAKE MISTAKES. YET IS A TRUTH THAT I'M A FAILURE BUT IT'S ALSO THE TRUTH THAT HE LOVES ME. [cheering and applause] YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? THIS IS HOW JESUS WAS ANSWERING. &gt;&gt; HE COULDN'T SAY &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN is not the truth. Hallelujah. AND THAT WAS THE GREATEST TEMPTATION. GREATEST TEMPTATION IS WHEN WHEN SATAN COMES WITH TRUTH. OH YES, &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR GREAT BATTLE MIND. THE DEVIL TELLS YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WRONG. HE TELLS YOU THE TRUTH OF ALL YOUR MISTAKES. IS IT RIGHT AND THAT BATTLE IS RAGING IN YOUR HEAD AND THEN GOD IS GIVING YOU AN ETERNAL TRUTH. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS FINALLY FINALLY &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH &gt;&gt; WILL SET you free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WATCH HOW SATAN CAME TO BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AND HE TOLD HIM ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE TRUE. And then HE TOLD BROTHER RAN NOW EVEN GOD HAS PULLED [screaming] THE CURTAIN. &gt;&gt; GOD IS NOT LISTENING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS TRUE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; We're coming to the end. &gt;&gt; We are in the end time. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SATAN IS NOT TRYING TO TEMPT YOU. SATAN IS NOT TRYING TO TEMPT YOU with great lie, WITH AN OPEN LIE. HE'S NOT TEMPT YOU with drink and smoke, BUT HE'S TEMPTING YOU WITH A PART OF THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And listen what brother Brandham said. our church. We should be on our on our chairs right now. YOU KNOW WHY? AT THAT TIME, at that time, God had not unveiled himself completely. BROTHER BRANDHAM DIDN'T KNOW &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE love of God. &gt;&gt; HE DID NOT KNOW THAT GOD'S LOVE is elective. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SATAN COULD TELL HIM, "GOD, DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE." And this nearly LED BROTHER RENHAM TO SUICIDE. WHEN THE DEVIL CAN TELL YOU, &gt;&gt; "BROTHER RENHAM SAID, SATAN COULDN'T tell me. that there is no God. He said because I know him. BUT HE COULD TELL ME THAT GOD DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE. IF THE DEVIL &gt;&gt; CAN TELL YOU THAT GOD DON'T LOVE you anymore, he has won. He has the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IT PULLS YOU MUCH DAM DOWN IN DEPRESSION. BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON BELIEVED &gt;&gt; THE LIE [screaming] OF THE DEVIL. AMEN. AH. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my &gt;&gt; and then &gt;&gt; as the Lord God is unveiling himself, &gt;&gt; it came out that God's love, church age book is elective. Even if he pulls the curtain, even if he chastise you, even that even that it's love can never change. I want to say that again. Oh my my my my my my &gt;&gt; God loves you &gt;&gt; when you were a sinner because he loved you. He saved you. You know that because you are saved by grace according to scripture through faith and that not of your own. It is a gift of God. That faith that you need to be saved is a gift of God. BUT &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SAVED BY GRACE. WHAT IS GRACE? WHAT IS GRACE? BROTHER RANDOM SAID WHEN LOVE [screaming] IS PROJECTED, GRACE TAKES OVER. THAT'S WHY I CAN SAY YOU ARE SAVED BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT &gt;&gt; TO THE elect and THEN YOU ARE SAVED. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW BY GRACE, &gt;&gt; GRACE GOES BACK TO BEFORE EDEN WAS THERE. WHEN WAS THE [screaming] LAMB SLAIN? &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. FOR WHOM THE LAMB WAS SLAIN. &gt;&gt; FOR ALL THOSE THAT GOD LOVES FOR THE WORLD, [screaming] &gt;&gt; SO HAS GOD LOVED THE WORLD? You're with me? &gt;&gt; JOHN 3:16. SO HAS GOD LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON? WHAT KIND OF WORLD GOD IS LOVING? JOHN SAID, &gt;&gt; JOHN SAID THE BELOVED DISCIPLE, HE SAID, CHILDREN, IF YOU LOVE THE WORLD, THE LOVE OF GOD IS not in you. BUT JOHN 3:16, HE SAID, "SO HAS GOD LOVED THE WORLD." WHAT WORLD IS GOD LOVING? &gt;&gt; THAT WORLD THAT WAS THERE BEFORE THIS world was formed. [applause] Oh my. If you could go back, we would make clear that God's world &gt;&gt; is his people. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; You understand? Let's let's quickly go to the Garden of Eden to make that more clear. Remember when Adam and Eve had fallen, they fell in God's Eden. We are here in Satan's Eden. They they were falling in God's Eden in a beautiful environment. NO TELEVISION, NO CELL PHONE, NOTHING. IT WAS IT WAS CALLED THE ATMOSPHERE OF INNOCENCE. They were NAKED AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW. IN THAT KIND OF CONDITION, &gt;&gt; ADAM AND Eve fell. My my MY MY NOW WE ARE IN SATAN'S EDEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT CALLED INNOCENT. THIS CONDITION CANNOT BE CALLED INNOCENT. THIS CONDITION CAN BE CALLED CRAZY, &gt;&gt; BLIND, NAKED, AND THEY DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; Is it right? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NAKED AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW. IN LAIA, THEY ARE NAKED AND THEY DON'T KNOW. MAN WAS INNOCENT. God's innocence. HERE IS SATAN'S PERVERSION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Just to show you where we are living, what is bombarding your mind. COME ON NOW. IN GOD'S Eden with Adam, when Adam and Eve his wife were fallen, WHAT DID GOD DO AS THE FIRST ACT? They was dressed in fig leaves. Is that right? What did God do? He brought his skin. Is it right? He brought his skin. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS STANDS FOR? GOD'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; NOW, just stay shortly with me. &gt;&gt; Why did God brought a skin out for Adam and Eve? Pointing to Calvary that the lamb would die. WHY DID JESUS CHRIST DIE AT CALVARY? BECAUSE HE LOVED THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I go a step further. &gt;&gt; You think God felt sorry for Adam and Eve? You think God was now afraid his two children would go to hell. When was the lamb slain? Before the foundation of THE WORLD. BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, there was no place for hell. Hell is not eternal. It has a beginning, it has an end. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. HELL IS NOT ETERNAL. IT WAS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. YOU UNDERSTAND? &gt;&gt; WHEN IN EDEN, HE BROUGHT A LAMB. THE LAMB WAS SLAIN IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BECAUSE OF GOD'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S GRACE LOOKS TO PREDESTINATION. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE WAS NO hell in view yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when God comes now &gt;&gt; and saves you &gt;&gt; in Satan's Eden, &gt;&gt; if he saves you and you can say like Paul, you can say like Paul, I'm saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Can we say that? &gt;&gt; I'm saved by grace. You're not saved &gt;&gt; because God feels pity for you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I think it that doesn't really hit &gt;&gt; IN GARDEN OF EDEN AND GOD BROUGHT FORTH A LAMB SHOWING THAT CALVARY WOULD COME. BUT THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION. GOD WAS NOT AFRAID THAT HIS CHILDREN WOULD GO TO HELL. SO WHEN GOD SAVES YOU, HE FEELS NO PITY FOR YOU. HE'S NOT THINKING, "IF I DON'T SAVE THEM, THEY'RE GOING TO HELL. When God saves you &gt;&gt; by grace, &gt;&gt; he saves you because he has a plan for you. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THAT'S WHY HE THAT'S WHY HE BROUGHT A LAMB SKIN TO ADAM AND Eve because HE HAD A PLAN OF REDEMPTION. HE SAID, "I BRING THAT LAMB SO YOU CAN COME BACK TO WHERE YOU FELL FROM." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. SO THAT WE COULD COME BACK TO WHERE WE WHAT WE WAS BEFORE THIS EARTH BEGAN. THAT'S WHY HE DIED AT CALVARY. THAT'S WHY HE SHED THE BLOOD. [screaming] MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BLESS. &gt;&gt; And watch very carefully. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We go. We go slowly. But just let me deal for a few minutes on the importance of attitude. Brother Ram said the message Balamin Gilead. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said when the rapture comes, you ready? He said it will be a day &gt;&gt; that you will do &gt;&gt; your daily routine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily you are in church. We don't know. &gt;&gt; It can be. Well, can you imagine we having now church Sunday morning in Australia? &gt;&gt; It is already Sunday night. They're sleeping already. &gt;&gt; We are in church. &gt;&gt; They are not in church anymore. &gt;&gt; Is that right? In Germany, the people are coming to church now. In my church in Germany, they're just singing the songs. Now, in Germany, YOU GET THAT. WE ARE IN CHURCH RIGHT NOW. I HAVE A GOOD BROTHER IN AUSTRALIA. IF I PHONE HIM NOW, I DON'T GET him because he's sleeping. IN AUSTRALIA IS IT'S ALREADY NIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS, YOU MIGHT BE IN CHURCH OR YOU MIGHT BE IN BED, YOU MIGHT BE SLEEPING, YOU MIGHT BE WORKING. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THE RAPTURE WILL COME AS A DAILY ROUTINE. COME ON. &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE DENOMINATIONS TAUGHT US? &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE DENOMINATIONS CONFUSED US? &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE WILL BE LIKE THIS. THEN ON WHATSAPP WHATSAPP &gt;&gt; THERE COME a big news maybe YOUR WHATSAPP IS NOT workings what I WANT TO SAY IS THE RAPTURE DOES NOT DEPEND ON HOW YOU FEEL THE RAPTURE CONDITION DOES NOT DEPEND. IF YOU ARE JUST SINGING, IF YOU'RE JUST SAYING AMEN, EVEN IF YOU SLEEP, [screaming] &gt;&gt; THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO TO, THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO. REMEMBER THE BIBLE SAID WHEN THE DEAD IN CHRIST, THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS ROSE, THEY APPEARED TO many [screaming] to whom they appeared to the believers. NO, I I JUST STAY a few minutes. REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY FELT, REMEMBER THE CRUCIFIXION JUST TOOK PLACE. EVERYBODY WAS HIDING. EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID. IS THAT RIGHT? THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHURCH. THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHURCH. EVERYONE WAS HIDING BECAUSE THEY CRUCIFIED JESUS. THE PERSECUTION WAS ON. Is that right? &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS, THE BIBLE SAID, THERE APPEARED TO MANY. My my my my YOU WERE NOT WAITING. THEY WERE NOT WAITING TO COME. They were coming. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us &gt;&gt; that we get out of our denominational &gt;&gt; understanding. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it will not be like this. You know how how how the people had their impression 2,000 years ago as the Bible would say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THE THE DISCIPLES SETS THE impression when John and he will sweep THAT MESSIAH WHEN HE COMES HE WILL CLEAN THE SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; AND HERE HE WAS KILLED BY THE SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So never never depend on your feelings. Always keep the right attitude. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he brought a lamb in Eden, It was not to save them from hell. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; It was to bring them back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God saves you, &gt;&gt; when God saves you, he does not only save you from hell. He saves you because he has a purpose for you. That's the bride of Jesus Christ. THAT'S WHY BROTHER ADAM SAYS YOU ARE NOT SAVED ON ANY DAY. YOU WERE ALWAYS SAVED. JUST you didn't know that. BUT ONE DAY HE SHOWED YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU WERE NEVER LOST. YOU WERE ALWAYS A SEED. YOU WERE ALWAYS HIM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WERE THEY READY FOR RAPTURE 2,000 YEARS AGO? &gt;&gt; YES, THEY WERE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT TIME FOR THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; It was not time for the rapture. THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS THEY CAME FROM paradise and they WERE THEY WAS TRANSFERRED INTO A place but we know where they are today. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Waiting for us. IS THAT RIGHT? WERE THEY READY? NOW THOSE IN JERUSALEM WERE THEY READY? YES. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT THE TIME FOR THE RAPTURE. BUT THEY WERE READY BECAUSE THE THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS CAME TO THEM. You're with me. [applause] SO YOUR READINESS DOESN'T DEPEND OF HOW READY YOU FEEL, YOUR READINESS, EVEN IF THERE'S AN ANXIETY ATTACK ON YOU. UHHUH. &gt;&gt; OH, we will go there in a few minutes. You will be shocked. Surprised. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Now Eve was the right womb. and she received the wrong seat &gt;&gt; and the result was &gt;&gt; Kane. Is that okay? Right womb seat. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Cain was the result. &gt;&gt; Now, Hagga &gt;&gt; was the wrong woman and the right seat. What was the result? &gt;&gt; Was Ish seed of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. [laughter] So Eve the right womb the wrong seed. &gt;&gt; HAGAR THE WRONG WOMB THE RIGHT SEAT. SARAH, &gt;&gt; the right womb &gt;&gt; and the right seat. &gt;&gt; But watch very careful. &gt;&gt; What came out? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; But Isaac &gt;&gt; died. Isaac died. So she brought forth &gt;&gt; a natural man a good natural man. You will you will understand why the prophet in the church ages he would let us know the church age book &gt;&gt; speaking about elective love. speaking about pick up the pen and write. &gt;&gt; Why? He would say the word &gt;&gt; is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Why not Sarah? &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE difference between Sarah and Mary? Amen. &gt;&gt; Sarah had the right womb, &gt;&gt; received the RIGHT SEAT. &gt;&gt; MARY WAS the right womb received the right seat. &gt;&gt; What was the difference? &gt;&gt; The attitude. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just the attitude. &gt;&gt; WHAT ATTITUDE SARAH HAD? &gt;&gt; ME, an old woman. &gt;&gt; ME, A 2,000Y OLD CHURCH. ME, a human being. &gt;&gt; What did Mary say? &gt;&gt; IT BE TO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So you understand. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; That's actually too much to it. As as we speak of rapture, as we speak of the rapture now and the rapture condition, I thought, it would be very good to really to look very close to the characters of the Bible who they were &gt;&gt; and what was the secret. of them being raptured. of them being raptured. As the prophet said, there's three raptures in the Old Testament and three in the new. Is that right? How many raptures did that already taken place? Four. &gt;&gt; Raptures took already place. Is that is that right? two is still waiting &gt;&gt; which is the rapture of the bride of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what the sixth rapture is? SIXTH RAPTURE IS THE TWO witnesses Moses and Elijah. Maybe we start with them. It didn't happen. But we know according to the Bible what will happen. AND WE ALSO KNOW EXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE WHAT HAPPENS IN our rapture because brother BRANDON &gt;&gt; TOOK PSALM 27. He took Psalm 27 AND SHOWED &gt;&gt; THAT THIS WILL BE THE CONDITION WHEN the rapture takes place IN A TIME OF great trouble. HE SHALL HIDE ME IN THE SECRETS OF HIS TABERNACLE. SO, BROTHER TOLD US ALREADY THAT OUR RAPTURE WILL happen in a time of great trouble. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you feel in great trouble? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T BE BETRAYED BY YOUR FEELINGS. Let let's start with the last ones. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that the system they will do great signs and wonders. IS THAT RIGHT? FINALLY, they get killed. HOW LONG DO THEY LAY DEAD IN THE STREETS? &gt;&gt; Three days. killed &gt;&gt; by the beast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, are they ready for rapture? Are they ready for rapture? WHEN THEY LAY [screaming] DEAD IN THE STREETS, THE BIBLE SAID THEY WILL LAY THREE DAYS DEAD IN JERUSALEM. AND then they are raptured. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will ask them when I meet them how how they have felt. How do you feel when you get killed? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When you get COME ON. THEY GET KILLED by the system. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Are they ready for rapture? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Great attitude, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, &gt;&gt; if the if Satan comes &gt;&gt; and he's trying to make you afraid &gt;&gt; because of your sick and when you are sick, you are down. Is that right? &gt;&gt; If you're sick, you are down. You don't feel hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IN THE GOOD DAYS, &gt;&gt; PRAISE HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; IN THE BAD DAYS, DO THE SAME. [applause] You understand? &gt;&gt; BUT YOUR FEELINGS total different. &gt;&gt; That's right. CAN YOU ONCE AGAIN MOSES AND ELIJAH &gt;&gt; THEY GET killed &gt;&gt; which is not nice. &gt;&gt; THEY LAY FOR THREE DAYS. THE WHOLE WORLD THEY CELEBRATE A BIG feast and after three days &gt;&gt; they're raising &gt;&gt; in a rapture what I can get killed &gt;&gt; and still rapture ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if Satan wants to scare you, you are sick, &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO FACE TO FOR HEALING, HOW CAN YOU GO IN THE RAPTURE? [laughter] Ah yes, come on church. THIS IS WHAT IS GOING IN YOUR HEAD. If I WANT TO BE BODY CHANGED, if I want to have a body change, please must have faith for my body. Is it not what THE PROPHET SAID? AND WHAT SATAN IS USING? &gt;&gt; Is it okay when I go there? Church, WE ARE FIGHTING THE GREATEST BATTLE TODAY. We have a brother right now in our church. He's laying in hospital and they found out a cancer and he's going through a terrible time. Sometimes he's crying at the hospital. Sometimes he's begging. Some cannot understand. Sometimes he's just hallucinating because of the medication. Is he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Satan is trying to scare you, said, "You are sick. You will die." Tell him, "I'm a believer." &gt;&gt; And I don't die with the sickness. &gt;&gt; I die when my time has come. Did Elisha &gt;&gt; The Bible said Elisha Elisha &gt;&gt; type of the church &gt;&gt; the the follower of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Elijah was raptured. &gt;&gt; Elijah &gt;&gt; died with his sickness. Read your read your Bible. &gt;&gt; WAS ELISHA rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Had the quickening power. &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN HAVE THE QUICKENING POWER AND DIE WITH THE SICKNESS. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Is it right? &gt;&gt; Because after he had gone, &gt;&gt; they put a dead soldier on his body. And brother said, "Elijah had so many quickening, so much quickening power EVEN IN HIS DEAD BONES THAT WHEN THEY PUT A DEAD SOLDIER ON TOP, THE DEAD JOSEPH JUMPED OUT OF THE GRAVE." BECAUSE ELIJAH HAD THE QUICKENING power to be raptured AND HE DIED WITH A SICKNESS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; SO TO BE RAPTURE READY, TO BE MARRIAGE READY IS SO DIFFERENT than are we ready? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You not don't look to a feeling now. &gt;&gt; YOU LOOK TO THE PROMISE. WE LOOK TO THE PROMISE FOR THE BRIDE HAS PREPARED HERSELF. SHE took she took what was granted to her. &gt;&gt; THE RIGHTEOUSNESS of the saints. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you understand that chose the bride? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need the right kind of attitude &gt;&gt; to be dressed proper. &gt;&gt; You need the right attitude &gt;&gt; to be dressed proper. Is that right? Uhhuh. If he puts on you his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Will you receive it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So as we are closing, &gt;&gt; may we take only one more example. &gt;&gt; We could go to Jesus. &gt;&gt; We could go to Enoch. &gt;&gt; Enoch was raptured, right? Enoch was raptured, right? Was the first rapture in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Who was else raptured? &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; Do you remember? We have read James. We have read James. &gt;&gt; James 5 when it and James &gt;&gt; actually speaking of someone WAS LIKE SAME KIND OF PASSION AS WE ARE. HE'S SPEAKING OF THE THE PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN. &gt;&gt; And then HE SAID ELIJAH WAS A man of like passion. And then he prayed &gt;&gt; and Elijah &gt;&gt; went in a in the rapture. &gt;&gt; With this we are closing because I found it very beautiful the condition he was in the day he was raptured. And you will be amazed. And it makes clear attitude &gt;&gt; makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Just have the right kind of attitude. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a man once, an old negro, an old colored man. &gt;&gt; He came one morning to church. It happened not long ago, maybe 50, 60 years ago. He came one morning to church, a group like this group, &gt;&gt; a group like this group. And he came to church as you came to church. And when he came TO CHURCH, THE WHOLE CHURCH WAS UPSIDE DOWN. People were crying. People were crying. PEOPLE WERE PRAYING. People were were were a little bit nervous and that old fellow said, "Hey, what's going on here?" And somebody rose and said, "Oh, the news came. The rapture has taken place and we are left behind. Now we cry AND WE PRAY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO." The old fellow said &gt;&gt; that's not possible. &gt;&gt; He said BUT THERE WAS A MAN THAT HE HAD A you know you know they had a prophecy and a vision and a dream and whatever whatever witness is proof that THIS IS THE TRUTH. THE RAPTURE HAS TAKEN PLACE. The brother said, &gt;&gt; "That's not possible." He said, "BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW?" HE SAID, "I spoke to him this morning and he never said anything about it." So you must be wrong. That man had a right attitude. &gt;&gt; HE BELIEVED what God said about him. AND IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE, YOU BELIEVE WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT YOU THAT THE RAPTURE CANNOT GO WITHOUT YOU. THAT YOU ARE SAVED [screaming] FOR A PURPOSE. I HAVE A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT WAITING FOR FAITH. &gt;&gt; I am because THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FAITH. THIS IS A PERSONAL FAITH. Normally we thought faith cometh by hearing which the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But be honest. Faith is not coming to you. You have already faith. That faith comes to you means it's quickened. So the hearing of the word quickens, THAT FAITH THAT you are. &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO SAY CLEAR, &gt;&gt; NOT THAT FAITH WHAT YOU HAVE, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT FAITH WHO YOU ARE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that Elijah did a lot of miracles, &gt;&gt; but Elijah &gt;&gt; did more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was raptured? &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; So if the mount of miracles shows that we are ready for rapture, It should be Elisha. &gt;&gt; Very simple, right? &gt;&gt; Once again, &gt;&gt; did Elisha did as double as much as Elijah? &gt;&gt; Because on him was a double portion, right? But the one that was raptured &gt;&gt; was the one with least miracle. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; SO THE AMOUNT OF MIRACLES that you can perform doesn't make you rapture ready. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE MANY SHALL COME TO ME IN THAT DAYS. MANY SHALL come to me in THAT DAYS. HAVE WE NOT DONE THIS? HAVE WE NOT DONE THIS IN YOUR NAME? THEY HAVE DONE MANY MIRACLES IN THE NAME of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on. And Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "I never knew you." &gt;&gt; You know what their problem was? &gt;&gt; Their attitude. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we had time, you understand? JESUS SAID, "I NEVER KNEW YOU." YES, Jesus knew them. He said they never knew you BUT WE HAVE DONE we &gt;&gt; you understand we &gt;&gt; wrong attitude very simple is it not is it not the hour &gt;&gt; of I &gt;&gt; me &gt;&gt; selfie. &gt;&gt; Is it not the hour? Come on, church. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ABOUT ME. ME. ME. &gt;&gt; Not rapture ready. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JESUS TOLD THOSE THAT DID MIRACLES EVEN IN HIS NAME SAID, "I don't know you. Isn't that beautiful? [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my &gt;&gt; Now let's go quickly quickly. Oh yeah. Is running the time. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So Elijah Elijah &gt;&gt; was a man of same kind of passion. You know, Elijah had his ups and he had his down. I have my ups and I have my downs. Have you your ups? Who has his ups? Who has his downs? Yeah, we have &gt;&gt; Elijah was THE SAME. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT GREAT UP ON MOUNT CARMEL. &gt;&gt; Goodness me, what a victory on Mount Carmel. What a victory. All the the the priests of you know the of the the the B priest get killed. Is that right? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHAT UP OF ELIJAH? HE WAS SO SO ENERGIZED THAT HE WAS OVERTAKING THE CHARIOTS. Was he was he rapture ready NEXT DAY? SITTING UNDER A TREE. SAY, LORD, &gt;&gt; now listen very carefully with his suicide spirit on him. I want to say that again. With his suicide spirit on him. You know what he said to God? &gt;&gt; Take my life. &gt;&gt; TAKE I WANT TO DIE. TAKE MY LIFE. I asked you a question. Was he rapture ready? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give you a little bit something that will help you &gt;&gt; so that you don't come in that condition where you are trying to commit suicide. Elijah did a great mistake. That why this spirit of suicide was so close to him that he is asking God take my life. It's very interesting. &gt;&gt; God didn't get God did not get angry with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God didn't get angry with him &gt;&gt; because God knew him. &gt;&gt; You know what God did? &gt;&gt; You know what God did? Ah, &gt;&gt; you said Elijah, &gt;&gt; rest yourself here. &gt;&gt; What did God do? &gt;&gt; What did God do? He brought him a good meal. GOD GOD DIDN'T SEND. Now get me right now, please. I don't want to say that offensive. God didn't send a group of Pentecostal preachers to cast out that suicide spirit. God brought down a good meal. [cheering] So you understand &gt;&gt; when you are in depression, &gt;&gt; watch what you eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's very simple. &gt;&gt; I was praying FOR A GIRL NOT LONG AGO. For a young woman, a married mother of two children that went into a state of schizophrenic. Two people shitzu schizophrenic. She was a beautiful She She is a beautiful Christian girl, had a wonderful husband, &gt;&gt; two children, &gt;&gt; and she fell into a ditch and she rejected the husband. She rejected her child and she felt the rapture has taken place and we are out of it. She didn't want to live with the husband. That's a spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the devil. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But I TELL YOU SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET HAD TOLD US in demonology the devil cannot take you unless he finds a weak spot. THAT'S WHY CANCER &gt;&gt; CANNOT COME to a healthy cell. &gt;&gt; Cancer &gt;&gt; comes to a weakened a broken cell. Uhhuh. Right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? The demon of cancer &gt;&gt; cannot take you &gt;&gt; unless you have a broken cell somewhere. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So how how can I help my body heal my broken cell? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen as we go from Elijah on him the depressive spirit that wanted to commit suicide and God just give him a good meal shows this is what he needed. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? NOW, WAS HE RAPTURE ready even WHEN HE WAS IN HIS LOWEST MOMENT? &gt;&gt; YES. I will show you a little later. Now one great mistake Elijah did you can read it in second kings we don't read it but you can read it at home it is in second kings uh the first kings 19 I think it is where Elijah after the great VICTORY AS HE WAS DROPPING INTO THE valley he sends his servant away because he wants to be alone. This is typical a sign when depressions is hitting you. You want to be alone there. He made his mistake. He sent even his servant away. WHY WAS THE SERVANT THERE? TO LIFT HIM UP. WHY WAS THE SERVANT THERE? TO HELP HIM. WHY WAS THE SERVANT THERE? WHY WE HAVE ONE ANOTHER TO LIFT US UP? IF A BROTHER FALLS IN BATTLE, LIFT HIM UP. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And Elijah Elijah made a great mistake. He sent the servant away and then he fell into his ditch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CHURCH. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THAT'S WHY COME TO CHURCH. IF YOU FEEL DEPRESSED, IF YOU FEEL YOU WANT TO BE ALONE, THAT IS THE TIME TO COME TO CHURCH. THAT IS THE TIME STILL TO COME. SHOW THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE. IN THE GOOD DAYS, &gt;&gt; IN THE GOOD DAYS I COME TO CHURCH. IN THE BAD DAYS I COME TO CHURCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; As we are closing. &gt;&gt; As we are closing. Watch very close. So here Elijah &gt;&gt; goes to be changed. Right. Elijah goes now and he knows his time has come. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He hears a lot of prophecy, the sons of the prophets coming to him speaking about this is his time. You know what he's saying? I know. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS A TIME CHURCH WHEN the translation comes. This is a time of our rapture. &gt;&gt; What do you say? &gt;&gt; Yes, we know. &gt;&gt; The prophet has told us and we see all those things coming. AND LIFT UP YOUR EYES FOR YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWS NEAR. THE REDEMPTION OF OUR BODIES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HEY, come on. &gt;&gt; I tell you what &gt;&gt; now. Okay. You are you are Elijah. Okay. &gt;&gt; You're the favorite one. You're raptured. &gt;&gt; Remember that day when he was taken away, he stood Elijah &gt;&gt; and there should Elijah. &gt;&gt; Elijah. He stood in the chariot and the chariot went up. &gt;&gt; That was his change, right? &gt;&gt; They talked to one another. Nobody was praying. Nobody was on his knees. One was in the chariot. One stood outside the chariot and they talked with one another. Rapture will be daily routine. Rapture will be some daily routine. &gt;&gt; I must be honest. If I would be Elijah, &gt;&gt; if I would be Elijah, &gt;&gt; I would step with him in a chariot. You understand that? So it was such a normal happening. AND AS ELIJAH WAS GOING, &gt;&gt; ELIJAH SAID, "HEY, THE MANTLE [screaming] WITH OTHER WORDS, &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING." AND ELIJAH SAID, "OH, HE TOOK THE MANTLE." AMEN. CHURCH. It will be your day in your daily routine. The rapture will come. The rapture will go. But watch as I'm closing one. Have you watched? There was a way that Elijah went to his rapture, from Gilgal to Bil from Bal to Jericho and from Jericho to the Jordan. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS OUR WAY TO THE RAPTURE. FROM GILGAL TO BAL, FROM BAL TO JERICHO AND FROM Jericho to the Jordan. AND WHEN THEY CROSSED JORDAN THERE, THE chariot came to them. Watch very close. This will surprise you. This will surprise you. Okay. Now, I'm Elijah. Okay. I'm Elijah. He's Elisha. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, we start our journey in Gilgar. &gt;&gt; What is Elijah doing? &gt;&gt; Elijah is telling Elijah, "Stay here." &gt;&gt; You know why? He wants to be alone. He wants to be alone. &gt;&gt; A typical sign of someone &gt;&gt; that is in depression. &gt;&gt; Now watch. &gt;&gt; What is Elisha doing? [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. ELISHA IS NOT LAYING HANDS ON him because he's on his way to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; ELISHA IS JUST SAYING. NO, I don't leave you alone. I go with you. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I HAVE LEARNED &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOOD THAT YOU ARE ALONE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY COME TO THE NEXT PLACE. &gt;&gt; THEY COME TO BETH. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS ELIJAH DOING? &gt;&gt; They come to Beta. &gt;&gt; You know THE PROPHETS, THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS COME AND THEY SAY THIS IS THE DAY WHERE ELIJAH IS GOING. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? EVERYONE IS CONFESSING. THIS IS THE HOUR the rapture. What is Elijah doing? He's telling Elisha, "Stay here." What is Elijah do? Elisha doing said, "No, I'm coming with you. It's not good that YOU ARE ALONE." COME ON, CHURCH. ON HIS WAY TO THE CHANGE. ON HIS WAY to his change. Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They come to Jericho. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH IS SO SO DENSED. He's so under pressure &gt;&gt; to his rapture on THE WAY TO HIS BODY CHANGE. SO MUCH MENTAL AND detention against taking alone. I want to be alone. &gt;&gt; What is Elisha saying? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; I go with you. My my my my my. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND TODAY &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS ARE WORKING. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW GOD IS WORKING. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW SATAN IS WORKING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Was Elijah rapture ready? &gt;&gt; And remember even when they came to the Jordan, he said stay here. So bad was that burden on Elijah. This should be the happiest day. I'm going to my rapture. Come on, church. Come on. Do you THINK ON YOU ON YOUR WAY TO YOUR BODY CHANGE? WHAT IS OUR IMAGINATION? OH, WONDERFUL. EVERY DAY WITH Jesus sweeter than the day before. Amen. &gt;&gt; He Elijah finds himself on his way to his body. Amen. &gt;&gt; James tells us, &gt;&gt; James tells us &gt;&gt; Elijah and of same kind of passion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus in G. Was Jesus raptured? &gt;&gt; Was he raptured? Now here you see him in the garden of Eden, in the garden of Gethsemane, excuse me. &gt;&gt; The spirit had left him. &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; I want to say again, when the spirit left him in Gethsemane, was he still rapture ready? because he was the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Whatever situation &gt;&gt; God allows in your life &gt;&gt; that it's according to your purpose. you remain rapture ready. [applause] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus asked three times. Three times. First time he went in, he said, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup depart from me, but not my will be done." He walked back, find his disciples sleeping. He goes back. He said, "FATHER, IF IT IS POSSIBLE, I CAN'T DEPART from not my will be done." He went out again, he comes BACK AGAIN. THE THIRD TIME HE'S ASKING GOD, &gt;&gt; please not me. &gt;&gt; But not MY WILL BE DONE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT [screaming] ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; Right attitude. &gt;&gt; HE KEPT THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And then the greatest miracle happened. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16. &gt;&gt; Voice. &gt;&gt; Shout. &gt;&gt; Shout. Voice. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Voice. Shout. Voice. Trumpet. &gt;&gt; Shout. Wasn't the message? Where's the voice? &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And the trump of God. What is the trump of God? &gt;&gt; Not Mr. Trump from the United States. The trump of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who Who is the trump of God? &gt;&gt; A trump is an instrument &gt;&gt; that is moot. &gt;&gt; It's silent instrument. It cannot play itself. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The trump is an instrument that needs somebody to play it. &gt;&gt; Who is playing you? &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS IS THE MARRIAGE OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; You know what it was 2,000 years ago? &gt;&gt; You know what it was? The voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; My God. My God. &gt;&gt; Why has thou forsaken me? And then he cried with a loud voice, &gt;&gt; "It is finished." &gt;&gt; That voice is the voice of the resurrection. What is the voice of the resurrection in this time? Is it becoming clear? When Jesus was hanging AT THE CROSS, MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN ME? &gt;&gt; Was he raptured already? &gt;&gt; Now I ask you again and I trust you are a little bit diverse from your feelings. who is rapture ready. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let us stand together. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us pray together. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we thank you for your grace and mercy. We thank you for all that you have done. We thank you for a peace that the world cannot give. a reality that the world cannot give. This is not a fable. This is your story in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Stories in the Bible &gt;&gt; of men that was ready for rapture. And here we are standing today as Elijah. Oh God, [music] &gt;&gt; may it defeat &gt;&gt; every enemy &gt;&gt; that is trying to bring us down. &gt;&gt; May it defeat any depressive spirit that tells the people you cannot make it to the rapture. May it defeat the enemy. [music] I pray father and as we are continuing we love you and we thank you for your grace and for your mercy and may your kingdom come as it is in heaven so now on earth. We thank you for the marriage of the lamb and we are so grateful that we are ready for the marriage supper. We love you and we appreciate you.

Bring them [singing] in from the fears of sin. [music] Bring [singing] them in. Bring [music] them in. bring [singing] the wondering ones to [music] Jesus. [singing] &gt;&gt; You know in the Bible they never baptized any child. But in Matthew chapter 19, they brought the [music] little children and they gave them to Christ to bless them. And that's what we do. We don't baptize little children because baptism is for people understand what they are doing. The Bible says man believes with the heart and confesses with the mouth. Excuse me. So this little child that's being [music] brought here, we are not going to baptize but just to dedicate these children. So let us pray for Brenda. Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we dedicate a team Brenda into the [music] hands of God. We pray that father your grace may come down upon this child. [music] You may protect this child in it in her life. And we pray you may give the ability to the parents [music] to raise this child in the fear of the Lord. May you also open the doors for all the needs of this child. her welfare, her health, her education, dressing and feeding, protection and everything. Lord, that you've commanded the parents how to raise their children. May you bring this child also to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ during the course of her life here on earth that she may accept you as a personal savior [music] and be born into the kingdom of God. We rebuke all forces and all powers of darkness that always come against little children even against people. We command them in the name of [music] Jesus Christ. We pray that your grace be upon this child the gift of good health and even to grow up as a normal child that she can be your handmade in your kingdom. Bless this family father. provide for all that they have need of that they may never lack to raise this child in the name of the Lord Jesus pray and ask this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have some few announcements to make them go out. We are running out of time but we have only one hour to be out. [music] and then we come back immediately that we can feed more. So I just want to announce to the church members here on 20th which is this Saturday we are going to have a praying and fasting meeting here. Then on Sunday, 21st of December, the coming Sunday, we are going to have two services. [music] The first service for all of us, an afternoon service for the youth who are still in school. Then also we have a convention, youth convention starting in starting on 18th this Thursday up to 21st December. So you invited those who can make it already. Three people have made willingness to go there. Then on we have another invitation. There is another youth convention in Gaza starting on 29th of December up to 1st January. And I would encourage our youth here so much to be part of that. Praise the name of our Lord. Even the parents if you can support your children to be part of that. And I believe will be built when they attend it. They will be built when they attend it. So those who want to attend the Gaza convention, get in touch with brother William. We generated the list for the poor going. We just need to see that that is done. Praise the name of. So let me invite brother to come and close the service with prayer. Brother, if you can come and then bless the food. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we are just going to go out singing that song.
