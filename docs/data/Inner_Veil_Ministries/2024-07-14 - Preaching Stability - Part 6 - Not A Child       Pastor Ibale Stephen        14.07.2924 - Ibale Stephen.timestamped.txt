[57:26] amen do you love
[57:28] him amen we shall go straight to the
[57:31] word of
[57:33] God Amen we shall go to the Book of
[57:38] Luke Chapter
[57:40] 2 and verse
[57:43] 52
[57:46] amen and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[57:51] stature and in favor with God and man
[58:05] may the Lord bless in the reading of his
[58:08] word we may be seated amen am so the
[58:14] title
[58:16] today is preaching
[58:20] stability
[58:23] part and the emphasis is not a
[58:29] child Amen brother Bram
[58:33] says in the message Faith once delivered
[58:36] the
[58:38] Saints you are the same yesterday today
[58:41] and
[58:43] forever the Christ that lived in the
[58:46] body called
[58:48] Jesus is the same logos
[58:51] tonight that lives in the body of the
[58:54] church
[58:56] performing the same
[58:58] things living the same
[59:00] ways loving the same
[59:03] ways and doing the same
[59:05] things The Same Spirit producing the
[59:08] same
[59:09] things the same Jesus yesterday today
[59:15] and
[59:16] forever amen so
[59:19] we have the same spirit in
[59:23] us that was in Christ Jesus
[59:27] we as the
[59:28] church we are the
[59:31] body of that
[59:33] Christ so when Christ was born in
[59:37] flesh the scripture shows
[59:40] us that he grew in three
[59:44] phases he grew in
[59:47] wisdom he grew in
[59:49] St and also in favor with God and then
[59:53] men
[59:56] so when he was born in the moral
[1:00:00] flesh he was certainly governed by the
[1:00:03] elements that control the body of
[1:00:07] Flesh he could get emotional and
[1:00:12] cry he could you know visibly re reveal
[1:00:16] when he was
[1:00:20] hungry amen the devil saw he was
[1:00:23] hungry and wanted to capitalize on that
[1:00:28] condition you know the pressure of the
[1:00:31] ministry beat down his
[1:00:36] body and his body went you know
[1:00:41] forward it went forward 17
[1:00:45] years and when they saw him they said
[1:00:49] you are a man not 50 years and you say
[1:00:51] you know before Jesus was you were
[1:01:05] he was also threatened by
[1:01:08] death so all the
[1:01:11] elements that governed the human
[1:01:14] flesh also governed the body of
[1:01:19] Christ he was born into the veil of
[1:01:23] Flesh and Paul says but we see
[1:01:27] Jesus who was made a little lower than
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:33] angels for the suffering of
[1:01:36] death that's why he came in this
[1:01:39] flesh so that he could suffer
[1:01:43] death the penal of
[1:01:46] sin that you can live so and being
[1:01:51] found in fashion as a
[1:01:53] man he humbled himself
[1:01:57] and became
[1:01:58] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:02:02] the Cross so now we see just the coming
[1:02:06] forth of a
[1:02:09] man and so he kept
[1:02:13] increas in wisdom and in St so in
[1:02:18] wisdom God kept
[1:02:22] revealing amen certain revelations in
[1:02:25] season
[1:02:27] as it was needed for the
[1:02:31] son amen and you know I want to remind
[1:02:35] you one
[1:02:36] thing which I've told you a few times
[1:02:40] here that gra I mean growth is a very
[1:02:45] interesting because you keep
[1:02:49] learning and as you learn you
[1:02:52] drop amen you learn this
[1:02:56] and then you drop sometimes you come to
[1:02:59] what you
[1:03:01] learn again you drop it a second
[1:03:04] time just that's what growth
[1:03:07] is growth is not an instant leap into
[1:03:13] destination it's an evolution from one
[1:03:16] glory to another
[1:03:20] glory and yet the glory after that is
[1:03:23] greater than the glory before
[1:03:27] amen you see we grow into those
[1:03:32] phases just as become a
[1:03:35] Christian justification itself is a
[1:03:39] glory you rejoice deeply in your
[1:03:42] life but then you find that
[1:03:45] again when sanctification
[1:03:48] comes is a greater glory than
[1:03:53] justification and when the B of the Holy
[1:03:55] Ghost
[1:03:56] comes a more greater
[1:03:59] glory so growth is going from glory to
[1:04:04] glory and looking back at the
[1:04:08] children where they are
[1:04:11] growing they celebrate every
[1:04:15] level amen of their growth when they
[1:04:19] start finding out they can
[1:04:22] craw they celebrate that level and they
[1:04:26] keep wanting to
[1:04:28] go when they stand they celebrate that
[1:04:33] all the time they want to
[1:04:34] stand are you together with me and when
[1:04:38] they discover they can
[1:04:39] walk they want walk all over the
[1:04:42] place amen and when they discover they
[1:04:45] can
[1:04:46] run they want to run all over the
[1:04:49] place so you know uh they celebrate
[1:04:53] every station they get to
[1:04:58] but they don't station in that
[1:05:00] station they keep growing
[1:05:03] up so as sons of
[1:05:06] God we understand and celebrate every
[1:05:11] growth but yet at the same
[1:05:14] time we must keep our
[1:05:17] eyes on the mark of the high calling in
[1:05:20] Christ
[1:05:21] Jesus knowing that there is more that
[1:05:24] God is going to give
[1:05:27] amen we've got a God who keeps revealing
[1:05:31] his attributes day after
[1:05:34] day even when we
[1:05:37] erupt even when we get back
[1:05:40] home Amen in the New
[1:05:43] Jerusalem God will always be revealing
[1:05:48] himself in greater
[1:05:50] things praise the Lord so now listen at
[1:05:54] this
[1:05:55] different
[1:05:57] children may be born at the same
[1:06:01] time and also fed on the same
[1:06:05] food their level of growth is not
[1:06:09] uniform are you together with me it's
[1:06:12] exactly the same thing even in the
[1:06:15] church that you find people who are born
[1:06:18] in a similar
[1:06:22] season their growth is not the same
[1:06:26] and so is the
[1:06:28] form amen you can s Cor in the same
[1:06:34] day and then on the same
[1:06:37] plant you find this C is
[1:06:42] ready and this one is not your
[1:06:44] ready are you together with me so you
[1:06:48] know con was planted the same
[1:06:52] day but it's not being harvested on the
[1:06:57] so we need to appreciate the change God
[1:07:00] takes us
[1:07:03] through however small it
[1:07:06] is and however slow it
[1:07:09] is if it is a
[1:07:11] chance Le to appreciate God
[1:07:14] for amen and keep pushing the
[1:07:19] battle trusting that if this little
[1:07:22] Chang has come
[1:07:25] there is more that God is going to
[1:07:28] bring brother Bram speaks about a
[1:07:32] colored
[1:07:33] sister that he met in a
[1:07:36] meeting she said I want you all to know
[1:07:40] one
[1:07:42] thing I'm not what I want to
[1:07:46] be and I'm not what I ought to
[1:07:50] be but there is one thing sure I'm not
[1:07:54] what I used to be
[1:07:56] hallelujah hallelujah so for every
[1:07:59] little
[1:08:02] change in your Christian
[1:08:05] Life you need to learn to appreciate
[1:08:08] it because that's God and it's a sign
[1:08:13] that you can be able to
[1:08:15] grow and I know some of you
[1:08:18] mothers when you are mother for the
[1:08:21] first
[1:08:22] time and you have got a baby
[1:08:26] and the baby took a step for the first
[1:08:29] time most of the mothers clap their
[1:08:32] hands and they get very
[1:08:35] excited they know there is a growth
[1:08:38] taking
[1:08:39] place so growth natural or
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:44] spiritual is a mystery in
[1:08:47] itself you cannot let a finger on
[1:08:51] Gross whether it is spiritual or natural
[1:08:56] if you put your corn in the
[1:09:00] field you cannot wake
[1:09:02] up and say that I want to
[1:09:05] see when this corn is
[1:09:08] growing you will look at it from
[1:09:12] day tonight you will not testify of the
[1:09:16] growth but that core is
[1:09:19] growing amen that's true so you know we
[1:09:24] cannot put a finger on our spiritual
[1:09:30] growth but the truth of the
[1:09:33] matter is that we are growing
[1:09:37] anyhow hallelujah hallelujah amen and so
[1:09:42] spiritual
[1:09:43] growth which cannot be computed in
[1:09:48] years amen a person may be in
[1:09:53] church for about 4
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:57] but he still a
[1:09:59] child so the spiritual
[1:10:02] growth is not computed in how many years
[1:10:06] we've been in the
[1:10:08] church the spiritual growth is measured
[1:10:12] by the depth of the Life of
[1:10:16] Christ manifested in an
[1:10:19] individual amen spiritual growth is
[1:10:24] measured by by one being
[1:10:29] seasoned amen
[1:10:32] seasoned seasoned uh is not
[1:10:37] eratic eratic is
[1:10:40] somebody
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:43] okay is
[1:10:48] not amen
[1:10:51] so this person here
[1:10:57] amen his spiritual
[1:11:00] growth this man is measured by the form
[1:11:03] of training of the word he has
[1:11:09] taken you know to be reflected that he's
[1:11:13] not an
[1:11:16] novice to show that he's
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:20] reliable because of
[1:11:23] experience and long standing proof of
[1:11:26] the Christian
[1:11:29] experience so the mystery of
[1:11:33] growth comes by
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:37] laying under the
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:42] malach and then you are feeding on that
[1:11:46] word and as you feed on that
[1:11:49] word it Seasons
[1:11:52] you amen praise Lord and once you take
[1:11:57] the
[1:11:58] seeds of the message of the hour and you
[1:12:02] place them in your
[1:12:04] heart and provide
[1:12:07] them the
[1:12:09] atmosphere that the seed requires to
[1:12:13] grow that seed will grow and that seed
[1:12:17] will bring forth
[1:12:19] life amen so the word is a
[1:12:23] seed that is s
[1:12:26] souls and a seed if it's a dramatized
[1:12:32] seed and it goes into the
[1:12:35] ground then that seed under the right
[1:12:38] conditions of the
[1:12:40] Sun an
[1:12:42] atmosphere will bring forth the
[1:12:45] life that is in the
[1:12:48] sea and so is the word of
[1:12:52] God if a person can take that word
[1:12:56] and place it in their heart and give it
[1:13:00] the right
[1:13:02] sunshine the right
[1:13:05] temperature not s n but s o
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:15] n and right temperature
[1:13:19] faith
[1:13:21] that and promise
[1:13:26] we
[1:13:27] live amen praise the Lord and
[1:13:32] begin the one before
[1:13:34] him praise the Lord I see let's get to
[1:13:39] Mark chapter

[1:15:18] Rise night and day and the seity should
[1:15:21] spring
[1:15:23] up and grow up
[1:15:25] he knoweth not
[1:15:28] how amen you cannot keep
[1:15:33] track the rate of growth of the
[1:15:37] seed much as it's
[1:15:39] growing you cannot
[1:15:43] recognize the rate at which that seed is
[1:15:47] growing I want to stand before you this
[1:15:51] morning and tell you you are all growing
[1:15:57] amen I've got a testimony you are not
[1:16:01] what you used to
[1:16:02] be much as you are not what you want to
[1:16:05] be that's a true testimony that there is
[1:16:09] a growth going on in
[1:16:12] your amen and by the way on Sunday next
[1:16:16] Sunday we've got a minister from Zambia
[1:16:19] who is going to speak
[1:16:21] here amen so let us be here

[1:16:28] God Amen so he says in verse
[1:16:33] 28 for the
[1:16:35] Earth bringeth forth fruit of
[1:16:43] herself there now you know Jesus is
[1:16:48] explaining
[1:16:50] grow he says that the Earth bringeth
[1:16:53] forth of
[1:16:57] herself first the
[1:17:01] blade then
[1:17:04] the after that the full in
[1:17:09] the so then it goes through potential
[1:17:16] stages amen it brings
[1:17:19] forth the first
[1:17:22] blade and that first blade
[1:17:26] is potentially the
[1:17:28] seed amen if you lose it at that
[1:17:33] stage you cannot get the
[1:17:36] seed amen so the seed goes through
[1:17:39] potential
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:42] stages and why all these stages are
[1:17:45] celebrated by The
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:52] Farmer they are not
[1:17:55] sea amen but they are just stages of the
[1:17:59] growth of the
[1:18:02] sea amen we are very happy this morning
[1:18:06] to see sister Florence

[1:18:45] anymore one time they brought a not
[1:18:49] here that she is going to face surgery
[1:18:55] and you know when you are coming here to
[1:18:58] minister your mind is wrapped up in what
[1:19:01] you are going to
[1:19:04] say and I didn't want anything to take
[1:19:07] my
[1:19:09] mind I just say
[1:19:12] father before the doctor touches
[1:19:16] her let that thing
[1:19:19] disappear and just as the doctor
[1:19:22] came started looking for that
[1:19:26] human it was not
[1:19:32] there and the doctor I mean she
[1:19:36] said give me a
[1:19:39] note that this thing has
[1:19:42] disappeared and he says no but I'll
[1:19:46] operate you
[1:19:48] sometime to the best of my
[1:19:51] knowledge she has not been operated up
[1:19:53] to now
[1:19:56] amen so we appreciate our sister being
[1:20:00] with us
[1:20:02] again amen so you know the seed goes
[1:20:07] through
[1:20:09] stages for it to bring
[1:20:12] back the nature of its
[1:20:16] par hallelujah hallelujah amen so what
[1:20:21] are you growing
[1:20:23] towards you are growing towards the
[1:20:26] nature of your
[1:20:30] parent that's what we call the stat of
[1:20:32] the
[1:20:34] perfect that is our
[1:20:36] parent that's what we are
[1:20:39] growing are you together with me this is
[1:20:42] what brother Bram said in the quot
[1:20:46] here amen that the Christ that lived in
[1:20:50] the body called
[1:20:53] Jesus is the same logos
[1:20:56] tonight that lives in the body of the
[1:20:59] church are you together with me even the
[1:21:03] body called
[1:21:05] Jesus he grew through
[1:21:08] phases to manifest the
[1:21:10] father even in the church he grow
[1:21:14] through phases to man The
[1:21:17] Father amen so that's the mark of the
[1:21:21] high calling in Christ
[1:21:24] amen verse 28 he says for the Earth
[1:21:29] bringeth forth fruit of
[1:21:32] our first the
[1:21:34] blade then the
[1:21:36] ear after that full Conn in the
[1:21:40] ear it's going through
[1:21:43] phases then it goes through a potential
[1:21:47] stage while all these stages are
[1:21:50] celebrated by the farmer
[1:21:55] they are not the
[1:21:56] sea but is looking
[1:22:00] forward to the High
[1:22:03] Calling which is the
[1:22:06] manifestation of the par
[1:22:09] she that put in the
[1:22:12] ground amen verse
[1:22:15] 29 but when the fruit is brought
[1:22:19] forth immediately put forth the SE
[1:22:25] because the
[1:22:27] sea because the Harvest is
[1:22:31] come amen so the testimony of Christ in
[1:22:35] you will have to develop
[1:22:41] gradually until you
[1:22:44] bear The Life of
[1:22:47] Christ
[1:22:49] himself so in these bodies of growth I
[1:22:52] mean of Flesh
[1:22:55] we grow as we also
[1:22:58] grow in spiritual
[1:23:04] fields we are not children
[1:23:08] anymore not a
[1:23:13] child are you together with me not a
[1:23:18] child that being the title
[1:23:22] today there's no par that be
[1:23:25] happy of having a
[1:23:28] child that doesn't
[1:23:33] grow he will remain a little
[1:23:37] kid he remain doing child
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:41] things he cannot support
[1:23:44] himself he needs the support of the
[1:23:47] father of the
[1:23:49] time there's no parent who want see a
[1:23:52] child like that
[1:23:54] we want to see our children go through
[1:23:56] an
[1:23:59] evolution from one glory to another
[1:24:04] Glory everything with life
[1:24:07] grows and growth in
[1:24:10] itself is like a
[1:24:13] journey when you are taking a
[1:24:15] journey maybe you are going
[1:24:18] TOA while you are going to Nairobi you
[1:24:21] don't keep seeing this same building the
[1:24:26] time the is
[1:24:30] changed amen here you are in a
[1:24:33] vol you in a hill down there you are
[1:24:37] taking
[1:24:39] turn so we grow through changing
[1:24:45] experiences it's just like us ministers
[1:24:49] also our Ministries
[1:24:52] grow if I sound like what I was 10 years
[1:24:58] ago you are going to ask what is
[1:25:01] happening with
[1:25:03] our because a Ministry is supposed to
[1:25:07] grow a gift must
[1:25:09] grow amen it's like this song
[1:25:13] leaders they are also ministers by
[1:25:18] song Amen they also have to pray and say
[1:25:23] heavenly father
[1:25:25] help my gift to
[1:25:26] grow amen so basically in the
[1:25:31] age we've got the
[1:25:33] example of brother BR he was a minister
[1:25:38] that
[1:25:39] grow amen the prophet
[1:25:43] grow in the ministry just like a
[1:25:48] Christ are you together with amen you
[1:25:52] know Christ
[1:25:55] grew in
[1:25:56] wisdom and St there are certain
[1:26:00] things that he could say but not even
[1:26:05] the son
[1:26:08] knows amen he says not even the son
[1:26:13] knows amen about the coming now what
[1:26:17] does that mean it means that the fact
[1:26:22] that he wanted the to the the disciples
[1:26:26] were asking
[1:26:28] for it was not for their
[1:26:32] season so God could not release it to
[1:26:37] him there were certain things that
[1:26:41] brother Bram said and then later in his
[1:26:45] ministry he said something
[1:26:47] different that is a sign that a Ministry
[1:26:51] grows it grows in Revelation
[1:26:55] grows in understanding it grows in
[1:27:02] compassion amen so you know the growth
[1:27:07] of any living
[1:27:11] organism living
[1:27:13] orm is a
[1:27:18] multiplication of
[1:27:20] Cs and this cells here keep taking a
[1:27:26] nature that has got the
[1:27:28] capacity to support that organism at a
[1:27:32] certain level of
[1:27:35] life amen and when you are a human
[1:27:39] being even your brain cells
[1:27:44] change it keeps
[1:27:46] growing you begin to think
[1:27:49] different because your mind has to
[1:27:53] support the of your
[1:27:56] body amen so on this
[1:28:01] principle even our Ministries
[1:28:03] grow speaking about the ministry of
[1:28:07] Christ brother Bram
[1:28:11] said but as soon as Jesus begin to tell
[1:28:15] them the
[1:28:17] truth about the gospel what happened the
[1:28:22] servant went away
[1:28:25] the others went
[1:28:27] away and Jesus
[1:28:31] popularity Contin to
[1:28:33] fail until finally they crucified him
[1:28:38] but his ministry R deeper and deeper and
[1:28:44] it
[1:28:46] lasted now some of the people could
[1:28:50] confuse the fame
[1:28:56] with the
[1:28:58] ministry you see a Ministry at a
[1:29:01] particular
[1:29:03] time could be handling a
[1:29:06] level which makes it
[1:29:09] popular because he handling what the
[1:29:12] people
[1:29:14] want amen but Jesus rose a level
[1:29:21] higher and took the people
[1:29:24] into the
[1:29:26] world are you together with me and he
[1:29:29] says eat of My
[1:29:31] Flesh drink of my blood and the people
[1:29:35] could not catch that
[1:29:37] level the people were used to the
[1:29:41] level pick up your bed and
[1:29:44] go rise and walk and everybody
[1:29:49] why because super things were happen
[1:29:54] but he now took them to a different
[1:29:57] level where they required
[1:30:01] Revelation and
[1:30:03] submission the people who followed him
[1:30:07] started walking
[1:30:09] away the
[1:30:11] seven walked away he had come to a level
[1:30:16] of the depth of the
[1:30:18] ministry brother Brenham says the
[1:30:21] minister kept growing deeper and
[1:30:25] deeper the popularity
[1:30:27] [Applause]
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] fa because he was now dealing with
[1:30:36] issues of
[1:30:40] life so and speaking of the changing of
[1:30:44] his own
[1:30:47] Ministry brother Bram called the last
[1:30:52] change the
[1:30:54] stage of my
[1:30:58] Ministry meaning that the ministry had
[1:31:00] gone through
[1:31:03] phases in the last
[1:31:06] pH he was asking
[1:31:09] God to allow him to dress the bride with
[1:31:14] the Govern of the
[1:31:16] world are you together with me yeah not
[1:31:20] those massive
[1:31:22] Crusades so the growth here is like the
[1:31:28] pyramid it is wide at the
[1:31:31] bottom but as the person grows higher
[1:31:35] and
[1:31:36] higher there are so many things that
[1:31:39] follow that's how the church
[1:31:42] grows it doesn't grow into
[1:31:46] majority it grows into the
[1:31:49] minority and when I'm talking about the
[1:31:52] church I'm not talking about this local
[1:31:55] church here I'm talking about the body
[1:31:57] of
[1:31:59] Christ amen it grows into the
[1:32:04] minority not little
[1:32:06] flock for it's your father's good
[1:32:10] pleasure to give you the kingdom amen so
[1:32:14] life grows through
[1:32:17] stages just like our Ministries grow
[1:32:21] rest bram's Ministry
[1:32:24] R through three
[1:32:28] phases Amen in the anointed onean
[1:32:33] time he said the first
[1:32:37] pool
[1:32:39] healing second
[1:32:41] pool
[1:32:43] prophesying third pool the opening of
[1:32:47] the word the Mysteries
[1:32:51] revealed are you together with me
[1:32:54] so now it grew through three
[1:32:59] phases and all these
[1:33:02] phases was to pull the elect of the
[1:33:08] season to bring him in into the
[1:33:13] flock so now that gift with
[1:33:17] there when it was
[1:33:20] ministered it was exercised
[1:33:24] it was not a
[1:33:29] show it was to pull the
[1:33:33] people and so the three
[1:33:36] phrases he called them three
[1:33:40] pools he said the first
[1:33:42] pool was the healing of the
[1:33:45] people and the people were so
[1:33:48] excited they were happy with the
[1:33:51] pool and then the second pool
[1:33:54] was
[1:33:55] prophesying telling the secrets of the
[1:33:57] people's
[1:33:59] heart and then the third po was the
[1:34:03] opening of the
[1:34:05] word the Mysteries
[1:34:08] revealed Hallelujah so these
[1:34:12] pools existed in the ministry of Christ
[1:34:16] too just as they did in the ministry of
[1:34:19] brother
[1:34:21] BR and at one time brother Bram
[1:34:24] say pools exist in every
[1:34:31] Ministry so
[1:34:34] now praise the Lord no the first
[1:34:39] pool deal with the condition of the
[1:34:43] flesh
[1:34:46] healing and mes would
[1:34:49] come you are healed in Jesus name
[1:34:53] and they would go
[1:34:55] excited take up your bed and
[1:34:58] go they would get
[1:35:01] excited that was the ministry of brother
[1:35:04] brother people threw
[1:35:07] crutches and they walked off their
[1:35:12] wheelchairs some of them were
[1:35:14] resurrected from the
[1:35:16] dead but those were tempor
[1:35:20] side because the people died again
[1:35:24] are you together with me and that would
[1:35:27] make a man very
[1:35:30] popular the second
[1:35:32] po dealt with the condition of the human
[1:35:39] Spirit and the prophet called it
[1:35:43] prophesy
[1:35:45] amen yeah you know he would
[1:35:50] tell what was on the inside of a p
[1:35:56] where the person come
[1:35:58] from how many doctors you
[1:36:01] seen amen and at one time he
[1:36:05] says if I had to
[1:36:08] say everything that I
[1:36:10] see some of the people would end up in
[1:36:18] jail he was looking into the human
[1:36:22] Spirit of the people
[1:36:25] people whereing sin is
[1:36:30] brewed
[1:36:34] amen praise the lord it's brewed like a
[1:36:38] brew in
[1:36:40] there amen so now he was looking into
[1:36:44] there and now the third
[1:36:48] po it dealt with the soul
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] the opening of the
[1:36:57] world Hallelujah
[1:36:59] [Applause]
[1:37:02] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[1:37:04] Mysteries being
[1:37:07] revealed to
[1:37:10] unveil the Christ which was hidden in
[1:37:13] the
[1:37:15] world hallelujah hallelujah and this was
[1:37:18] specifically to the
[1:37:21] elect are you together with me all the
[1:37:25] others the first pool and the second
[1:37:29] pool was to
[1:37:31] everybody but the
[1:37:33] third was God dealing with the seed gen
[1:37:38] of a
[1:37:40] man he was dealing with
[1:37:43] ear he that has an
[1:37:46] ear amen so he was speaking the
[1:37:50] word to he that had done
[1:37:53] that was the third po the revealing of
[1:37:58] Christ Amen brother Bram says here
[1:38:02] Christ the Myster of God
[1:38:04] revealed he says
[1:38:07] look God in his
[1:38:10] body
[1:38:12] Christ and Christ in his
[1:38:15] body the
[1:38:18] bride it's the same God
[1:38:24] God in his body was Christ and Christ in
[1:38:30] his body is the
[1:38:33] church oh my God what
[1:38:39] manifest God made manifest in
[1:38:43] Christ and Christ made manifest in the
[1:38:48] blood and as God from the body of Adam
[1:38:52] and
[1:38:53] took uh from the body of Adam the
[1:38:59] woman and she
[1:39:01] fell then God was to take from the body
[1:39:04] of
[1:39:08] Christ his flesh his
[1:39:12] body which is his
[1:39:15] word and is bringing a bright
[1:39:19] out that won't fall by Creed or
[1:39:22] denomination
[1:39:25] but she's coming back with the
[1:39:29] pure anded word of
[1:39:33] God being
[1:39:37] manifested are you together with me so
[1:39:40] this last pull
[1:39:43] here is not
[1:39:45] popularity it's not people taking the
[1:39:49] sick amen even if when they bring them
[1:39:54] they can be healed but the purpose God
[1:39:58] is looking for your
[1:40:02] soul this is the
[1:40:04] pool it deals with the
[1:40:07] word the raling of
[1:40:10] Christ which is the MST of God
[1:40:14] revealed praise God so we learn from
[1:40:17] John
[1:40:19] 5 of the man at the well of Bethesda
[1:40:24] who was weak in his
[1:40:27] limbs amen for 38
[1:40:31] years the first
[1:40:34] pull was the healing of his
[1:40:37] body amen then Christ moved
[1:40:42] on to tell him see no
[1:40:47] more that was the second pool dealing
[1:40:51] with the human spirit
[1:40:54] then asked they
[1:40:56] him the people now what man is that
[1:41:00] which said unto
[1:41:03] thee that take up thy bed and
[1:41:06] walk and he that was
[1:41:09] healed was not who it
[1:41:13] was for Jesus had conveyed himself
[1:41:18] away IM being in that place
[1:41:24] after
[1:41:26] where Jesus finds him in the
[1:41:29] temple and said him behold Thou
[1:41:38] made see no more L the worst thing come
[1:41:42] unto
[1:41:44] thee the man
[1:41:48] departed and told the Jews it was Jesus
[1:41:53] which made
[1:41:54] me so in this particular aspect
[1:41:58] here we see the first pool we see the
[1:42:02] second pool and we see the third pool
[1:42:06] are you together with me amen the first
[1:42:09] is the healing of the
[1:42:11] body the
[1:42:14] outer and the second now is the human
[1:42:18] Spirit which is the middle C S no more
[1:42:23] but then the final
[1:42:27] C is when
[1:42:29] Jesus revealed himself to
[1:42:32] him are you together with me so every
[1:42:36] oncoming
[1:42:38] pool was a stage higher than the
[1:42:44] previous with God working himself
[1:42:47] towards the center of human life
[1:42:53] works from the
[1:42:55] outside so he enters into the outer
[1:42:59] cor of your
[1:43:01] flesh that's where signs and
[1:43:05] wonders then he goes into the
[1:43:08] middle that's Christ the high
[1:43:11] priest that's where the ceremonies were
[1:43:14] done and then finally he goes into the
[1:43:18] holy of
[1:43:20] hly taking the blood on the altar
[1:43:24] hallelujah
[1:43:25] [Applause]
[1:43:27] hallelujah until the
[1:43:29] blood has been
[1:43:32] applied to your soul amen from
[1:43:37] body to human Spirit human Spirit to the
[1:43:43] soul God perfected in
[1:43:48] threes
[1:43:51] listen just like God living in the three
[1:43:57] courts he sure lives in the court of the
[1:44:04] congregation amen which is the outer
[1:44:06] Court he also lives here to the ho
[1:44:10] place but his Abiding
[1:44:14] Place this was just attributes of his
[1:44:19] presence from the holiest of holiest
[1:44:24] amen you see now
[1:44:27] listen all these different
[1:44:32] worshipers met God at different
[1:44:38] levels because they all went to the
[1:44:43] Tabernacle there was the outer
[1:44:46] Court when the priest goes
[1:44:49] in they experience that presence
[1:44:54] he goes into the middle
[1:44:56] place the experiences what
[1:45:00] presence are you together with me so we
[1:45:04] as we come together as a local church
[1:45:09] and the presence comes down everybody
[1:45:13] will experience God at a certain
[1:45:19] level you cannot come to church and you
[1:45:23] go back
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:27] and understand amen so now you must
[1:45:33] Express his
[1:45:35] presence by your body Soul and
[1:45:39] Spirit God being perfected in
[1:45:44] thre amen so when the first pool was
[1:45:48] manifested in the
[1:45:51] ministry of Christ it was Healing The
[1:45:55] Sick it not requireed to go
[1:46:01] away for the second one to
[1:46:05] come the first
[1:46:08] pool did not require to go
[1:46:11] away the second one to
[1:46:14] come the second the first was
[1:46:18] there and the second pool came
[1:46:23] and while the second pool was
[1:46:26] there the third pool
[1:46:29] came so all these three
[1:46:32] pools leaving the church
[1:46:39] today the one who needs
[1:46:42] healing God is here to
[1:46:45] heal the one who needs the healing of
[1:46:47] the human
[1:46:50] Spirit God is here preaching to your
[1:46:53] human
[1:46:55] spirit amen and for those who want to
[1:46:59] catch
[1:47:00] life hallelujah hallelujah he is also
[1:47:03] here to
[1:47:05] baptize Every Soul that seeks to have
[1:47:10] him amen oh praise
[1:47:14] God let's go to this quot here he says
[1:47:19] watch
[1:47:21] three watch three
[1:47:24] everything in the Bible is
[1:47:28] three three blanks to
[1:47:32] one father son Holy
[1:47:35] Spirit not three Gods one faith hope and
[1:47:41] [Music]
[1:47:43] charity not three different
[1:47:45] things but all the essence of
[1:47:50] one do you love him
[1:47:53] you see I want you to see how these
[1:47:56] threes still work in
[1:48:01] one amen he says faith help
[1:48:08] charity not three different
[1:48:12] things but all the essence of one
[1:48:18] love now then there was justification
[1:48:26] Bas of the Holy Ghost not three
[1:48:29] different
[1:48:32] dispensation not three works of
[1:48:36] Grace but one
[1:48:38] work in three different
[1:48:42] manifestations same Holy Spirit was with
[1:48:46] Luther under
[1:48:49] justification was under
[1:48:51] wle with
[1:48:53] sanctification in the church now in the
[1:48:57] B of the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit
[1:49:01] not two Holy Spirits not three Holy
[1:49:04] Spirits Same Spirit are you together
[1:49:08] with me amen so now that's
[1:49:12] why the first pool does not have to go
[1:49:17] away for the second pool to come because
[1:49:20] it was one God
[1:49:23] pulling at different
[1:49:27] levels he has to be
[1:49:30] here to keep pulling at different
[1:49:34] levels because we still have some
[1:49:37] people that can understand by the first
[1:49:41] pool we still have people that can only
[1:49:45] understand by the second
[1:49:46] pool when you preach to condemn
[1:49:50] sin we still have them here
[1:49:53] we also have people that can pull by the
[1:49:57] revelation of
[1:50:00] Christ
[1:50:02] amen that's the same way these three
[1:50:04] pools
[1:50:07] work the work of
[1:50:09] Luther did not die away from the
[1:50:12] church for the work of Wesley to
[1:50:15] come but rather Wesley became a higher
[1:50:20] order
[1:50:23] of the same God and when Pentecost
[1:50:27] came it was just
[1:50:29] God lifting the church to a higher order
[1:50:34] that the same
[1:50:36] God that's the growth of the
[1:50:42] ministry are you together with me when
[1:50:45] you did with the
[1:50:49] blade you know when the cor is coming up
[1:50:53] there's no way you can have
[1:50:59] the so the life in the
[1:51:03] plant keeps posting
[1:51:06] on until all the
[1:51:10] stages packed back in the
[1:51:14] sea and if you plant the seed
[1:51:19] back it will do the same thing
[1:51:22] all those
[1:51:24] pools are a part of the maturity of the
[1:51:30] SE are you together with me the third
[1:51:34] pool
[1:51:35] therefore is not a
[1:51:39] Doctrine but rather the coming
[1:51:42] forth of the person of Jesus
[1:51:46] Christ in
[1:51:48] manifestation is the opening of the word
[1:51:52] when we sing of the world we are not
[1:51:56] basically talking about
[1:51:58] doctr but we are talking about
[1:52:02] Christ coming forth the
[1:52:07] manifestation in the beginning was the
[1:52:11] word
[1:52:14] amen do you love
[1:52:17] him the first pull is when he healed
[1:52:22] the second pool is when he convicted men
[1:52:26] of
[1:52:27] sin in order to killing the human
[1:52:31] Spirit the third pool he proves himself
[1:52:34] as the voice of the
[1:52:36] word that rested in the holy of
[1:52:41] holies amen the third pool has now being
[1:52:48] Vindicated brother Bram uses those words
[1:52:52] in the message Look Away to
[1:52:56] Jesus and many
[1:52:58] people attribute the the third
[1:53:04] po they only put the
[1:53:08] teaching so they say from
[1:53:13] 1963 that was the third po but all the
[1:53:18] things that is spoke
[1:53:20] about to vindicate the third
[1:53:24] P were done before
[1:53:30] 196 it is the same
[1:53:33] God he was just crossing his own
[1:53:39] borders the same one who
[1:53:43] justifies amen he sanctifies you and
[1:53:47] fills with the Holy Ghost but when you
[1:53:50] sin again doesn't mean you cannot be
[1:53:53] Sanctified anymore Hees his borders as a
[1:54:04] whale are you together with me you know
[1:54:08] the three I mean the the three son
[1:54:12] names Son of
[1:54:15] God
[1:54:17] Amen we had him first a son of
[1:54:21] man when came in the Jesus
[1:54:25] body and then when he died he manifested
[1:54:29] the office of Son of
[1:54:32] God because the blood was now
[1:54:36] available to cleanse the
[1:54:39] people Son of God the sacrifice of
[1:54:43] sin but then
[1:54:45] afterwards before he comes a son of
[1:54:49] man I mean a son of David to become king
[1:54:54] he comes again a son of man to fulfill
[1:54:59] St Luke
[1:55:03] 173 and so many people
[1:55:06] say you see today he son of
[1:55:11] man yes but he crosses his borders as he
[1:55:17] will because today he still forgives
[1:55:21] sin is the Son of God we are still
[1:55:25] baptizing are you together with me God
[1:55:28] crosses his
[1:55:33] borders
[1:55:36] amen now remember there will never be an
[1:55:39] impersonation of that third
[1:55:44] po because it can't
[1:55:46] be he says it cannot beated
[1:55:52] because it will
[1:55:55] be a manifestation of Christ
[1:55:59] himself walking from the side of a
[1:56:05] [Applause]
[1:56:06] Believer if it's just
[1:56:09] doctr it can be
[1:56:12] passionated but since it's the
[1:56:16] word bringing forth his own
[1:56:19] life it cannot be personated
[1:56:23] the opening of the
[1:56:25] word is the opening of The Working of
[1:56:30] Christ on the side of his own
[1:56:37] bride
[1:56:39] amen
[1:56:41] okay not a
[1:56:43] child let's go to First Corinthians
[1:56:48] 13 we
[1:56:51] identify the
[1:56:54] subject he says in 1 Corinthians
[1:56:59] 1311 when I was a
[1:57:04] child meaning
[1:57:06] that I'm
[1:57:09] grown not a
[1:57:13] child are you together with me not a
[1:57:18] child and that's the desire of every
[1:57:21] patient
[1:57:23] I want to be like
[1:57:24] Jesus to grow in wisdom and
[1:57:27] Stat and also in favor with
[1:57:30] man Paul is testifying on when I was a
[1:57:35] child Paul is saying I'm not a
[1:57:43] child when I was a
[1:57:45] child I SP as a
[1:57:48] child I understood as a child
[1:57:52] I thought as a
[1:57:53] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:57:58] child's
[1:58:03] feel when I
[1:58:06] was not when I
[1:58:09] am amen so this is a powerful
[1:58:14] concept when it comes to
[1:58:17] grow a young
[1:58:20] child understands as a
[1:58:23] child and it speaks with the authority
[1:58:27] of the child's
[1:58:31] knowledge
[1:58:35] he and then he
[1:58:38] serious he wants you to
[1:58:40] understand he speaks as a
[1:58:43] child but he wants
[1:58:48] communication when I was a
[1:58:51] child I understood as a
[1:58:53] child and I spoke as a child a child can
[1:59:00] insist on
[1:59:04] error and this is applicable to in
[1:59:08] spiritual
[1:59:11] reference a
[1:59:13] child can completely insist in
[1:59:18] error in the spiritual field
[1:59:22] and I told you that a child is not the
[1:59:26] many years youve spent in
[1:59:29] church are you together with me a
[1:59:34] child amen is
[1:59:36] somebody that has not
[1:59:43] evolved amen amen he says when I was a
[1:59:48] child I spoke as a child
[1:59:52] it affected
[1:59:55] Paul he's saying I was at one time a
[1:59:59] child it affected
[2:00:02] Peter he was trying to insist in
[2:00:06] circumcision he was a
[2:00:10] child so knowing the spiritual
[2:00:15] maturity is not necessarily a
[2:00:17] chronological age
[2:00:22] we have got
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:24] seniors in the church that can speak
[2:00:28] like a
[2:00:30] child they'll be so
[2:00:32] sincere they'll be so
[2:00:35] sincere because that s they can
[2:00:43] go you see I thought as a
[2:00:47] child there was a level of maturity
[2:00:52] that
[2:00:54] control his
[2:00:59] manifestations he would do
[2:01:03] things because he's alive on
[2:01:06] side but at a particular
[2:01:12] level when I was a
[2:01:14] child there is a way I looked at the
[2:01:18] ministry and some of the people talk to
[2:01:21] you
[2:01:23] about the ministry with the sincerity of
[2:01:26] the
[2:01:30] child the way the way I looked at the
[2:01:36] Brotherhood saying that oh If This one
[2:01:39] belongs to my group of
[2:01:43] Brethren that's the
[2:01:45] brother when I was still a
[2:01:48] child I thought that I could cont
[2:01:53] the
[2:01:54] regions where Christ works
[2:02:00] from that's when I was a
[2:02:04] child I could draw
[2:02:06] zones I
[2:02:13] could that one is not a
[2:02:16] brother he doesn't dress like
[2:02:18] us that one is not a brother he doesn't
[2:02:22] come to a convention that one is not a
[2:02:25] brother when I was a child I thought as
[2:02:29] a
[2:02:30] child I dressed as a
[2:02:36] child praise the Lord amen I Associated
[2:02:41] as a
[2:02:42] child so that's why we should keep
[2:02:46] fixing our
[2:02:47] eyes on the mark of the ey calling in
[2:02:50] Christ Jesus
[2:02:53] we have come to this
[2:02:55] level it is okay it's the Life of Christ
[2:03:00] but I need to go to another level and
[2:03:03] when I get on this one I should not make
[2:03:06] it a station as long as there is a life
[2:03:09] to walk
[2:03:10] into let us keep walking
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:16] up amen
[2:03:18] amen oh there is an image to
[2:03:23] into
[2:03:24] the of a
[2:03:27] perfect Amen brother
[2:03:30] Bram he was a maturity Above the Rest of
[2:03:34] the
[2:03:36] ministry he was two Wilds apart from him
[2:03:40] and the
[2:03:43] others you know he used to see
[2:03:46] things from the spirit
[2:03:49] world they used to see things
[2:03:52] for a natural
[2:03:58] interpretation you
[2:04:00] know he s the Fallen Roman Catholic
[2:04:06] church amen as the Fallen
[2:04:11] system saw he saw the Fallen Roman
[2:04:14] Catholic
[2:04:16] Church as the
[2:04:18] system that the Antichrist would use
[2:04:23] but the rest of them were just
[2:04:32] analysts they look at
[2:04:35] communism that was against
[2:04:38] church and they said that's the
[2:04:42] Antichrist they were
[2:04:45] kids they spoke as
[2:04:50] children are you together with me but
[2:04:53] when I became a
[2:04:55] man he says that I put away Child
[2:05:00] Things
[2:05:01] maturity looks Way Beyond the child's
[2:05:08] mind and the worst problem you'll have
[2:05:11] in
[2:05:13] church is the young man
[2:05:20] spiritually amen am trying to understand
[2:05:24] spiritual
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:27] things and trying to put your
[2:05:33] authority over the things that you have
[2:05:35] not grown into
[2:05:40] Yet brother Bram
[2:05:42] said I don't remember the quote very
[2:05:46] well but when they chose a certain young
[2:05:49] man
[2:05:52] to be a judge at a very low
[2:05:55] age is necessary to
[2:06:00] grow are you together with me I was very
[2:06:06] surprised when they were swearing
[2:06:09] in
[2:06:10] MPS in the
[2:06:13] UK 22
[2:06:16] years 24 years 25 years I said God
[2:06:23] what experience are they bringing to the
[2:06:30] parliament are you together with me and
[2:06:33] that's why also Parliament has gone that
[2:06:39] way the young men just jump out of
[2:06:45] University I'm going to the Parliament
[2:06:47] and there you
[2:06:49] go Jesus
[2:06:52] could not start his
[2:06:54] ministry until he had
[2:06:56] grown in wisdom
[2:07:04] and are you together with me maturity
[2:07:08] looks Way
[2:07:09] [Applause]
[2:07:11] Beyond so like yesterday we're dealing
[2:07:14] with the
[2:07:16] subject desire the sincere mil of the
[2:07:19] word
[2:07:22] which you are going to grow
[2:07:24] back feed on the
[2:07:26] word pick on sincere vitam of the
[2:07:31] world spiritual
[2:07:35] muscle amen because when
[2:07:38] God was
[2:07:40] recommending the office in
[2:07:43] church he says not
[2:07:52] so somebody must be
[2:07:55] mature in the word
[2:07:58] wisdom
[2:08:03] and listen to the advice of
[2:08:09] Pauli
[2:08:11] 2
[2:08:13] verse
[2:08:16] and as he have therefore received Christ
[2:08:19] Jesus the Lord
[2:08:24] walk in
[2:08:27] him not only walking in
[2:08:30] him verse
[2:08:32] seven rooted and built up in
[2:08:38] him are you together with me you are
[2:08:41] rooted in
[2:08:45] him you are not a
[2:08:48] baby you know baby who needs to be
[2:08:54] B and then you rock him
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:02] and
[2:09:04] no that's not how God
[2:09:08] works he needs your
[2:09:12] maturity when the servant walked
[2:09:15] away he did not say what shall I do
[2:09:18] without the
[2:09:20] 12 he will also go
[2:09:26] away are you together with me yes when
[2:09:30] Elijah found
[2:09:32] Elisha and then elishah said let me go
[2:09:36] and build my
[2:09:38] people I want to go with you he was
[2:09:41] always asking what have I done to
[2:09:44] you then he says as my go your God
[2:09:48] lives I'm not going to let you go I
[2:09:51] you
[2:09:53] El amen he could not give
[2:09:57] up he gets in g
[2:10:00] girl why don't you stay here he said no
[2:10:04] I'm coming along with you they get to
[2:10:07] the Crossing Jordan why don't you stay
[2:10:10] here I'm going with you what you want I
[2:10:14] want a double portion of your
[2:10:17] anointing that was the mark of the High
[2:10:20] Calling
[2:10:22] nothing nothing could put El
[2:10:29] back so when we come down here in
[2:10:33] church we walk in him but also we get
[2:10:37] rooted and built up in
[2:10:42] him amen so you get rooted into
[2:10:48] him wrapped up
[2:10:51] that you cannot be uprooted from
[2:10:54] him because he's the one holding you
[2:10:57] hallelujah
[2:10:58] [Applause]
[2:11:00] hallelujah he says rooted and built up
[2:11:02] in
[2:11:05] him and established in
[2:11:08] FA amen they have been
[2:11:12] taugh amen abounding there in with
[2:11:17] Thanksgiving walk in him be rooted in
[2:11:20] him
[2:11:22] establishing him amen praise the
[2:11:27] Lord
[2:11:29] abound and to abound is to remain and
[2:11:37] increase to fish
[2:11:40] richly so that one has
[2:11:44] abundance to
[2:11:46] abound is used in a flower
[2:11:51] growing from a bir to full
[2:11:56] blood amen growing into a full
[2:12:00] manifestation not a child
[2:12:03] anymore but rather the hidden
[2:12:07] beauty of Christ must be made
[2:12:13] manifest so
[2:12:16] maturity is the Lady of the Valley
[2:12:22] that has way out of the
[2:12:26] m c around the
[2:12:30] tree to come to the
[2:12:32] beauty and come to the top to display it
[2:12:38] Beauty and therefore
[2:12:40] grow is a
[2:12:42] process grow is a
[2:12:47] PA must have a testimony
[2:12:55] are you together with
[2:12:57] me that's what we are talking
[2:13:00] about not a
[2:13:03] child Ephesians
[2:13:08] 4 and verse
[2:13:11] 14 that we forth be
[2:13:14] normal
[2:13:19] children what classifies you as a
[2:13:25] child toss you to and
[2:13:28] FL carried about with wind
[2:13:34] of
[2:13:40] [Music]
[2:13:46] little a man just put his castol on the
[2:13:50] on the road
[2:13:53] side and put a table
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:06] there were putting the T
[2:14:13] Wasing
[2:14:16] ears let me go see what they will say
[2:14:23] children are TOS to
[2:14:26] anded by every wind of
[2:14:29] doct if they are 10 years in the
[2:14:33] message they've had about 15 shades of
[2:14:36] faith
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:58] that's
[2:15:02] a children are TOS to
[2:15:06] and from Doctrine to
[2:15:09] Doctrine thinking that's what will give
[2:15:11] them the
[2:15:13] maturity being blown by every wind of
[2:15:17] Doctrine but we need to be rooted
[2:15:22] and built up in
[2:15:24] Christ and get established in the
[2:15:31] faith
[2:15:32] simple you already have the
[2:15:35] faith I was preaching faith in
[2:15:39] Tanzania we had a conversion of more
[2:15:41] than a thousand
[2:15:44] people and I tell
[2:15:47] you I've never really seen I preached it
[2:15:50] in a few
[2:15:54] but it hit the
[2:15:58] not the
[2:16:00] people
[2:16:01] know they have the
[2:16:05] faith but you know if you don't have the
[2:16:09] faith what saved
[2:16:12] you what saved
[2:16:15] you you see the time of the fing the
[2:16:17] Bible
[2:16:19] says they will be running running to and
[2:16:22] from so running from convention to
[2:16:26] convention is not a sign of
[2:16:30] maturity you are looking for
[2:16:33] something and the Bible says you will
[2:16:37] not find
[2:16:39] it God established a local
[2:16:43] church and the principle of
[2:16:46] God is let the fivefold ministry
[2:16:51] in there and feed the
[2:16:56] people have
[2:16:58] confidence in the Ministries that come
[2:17:00] your
[2:17:01] way amen listen to what he says here in
[2:17:05] Hebrews
[2:17:07] 139 amen so converstions are very
[2:17:11] nice Amen to people who are too busy and
[2:17:15] maybe find a little time to concentrate
[2:17:21] they are very nice but your local church
[2:17:25] is the best
[2:17:26] place because at your local church God
[2:17:30] is feeding you with exactly what you
[2:17:33] have need
[2:17:37] of Amen Hebrews
[2:17:41] 139 be not carried about with diverse
[2:17:45] and
[2:17:46] strange doctr
[2:17:52] for it's a good
[2:17:54] thing that the heart be established with
[2:18:00] Grace hallelujah
[2:18:03] hallelujah for the heart to be
[2:18:05] established with
[2:18:08] Grace it's not different doctrines that
[2:18:10] will bring you to the
[2:18:13] maturity but when your heart is anchored
[2:18:18] in the finished work of calv
[2:18:21] it brings the Holy Spirit into that hat
[2:18:26] and then the Holy Spirit that's the
[2:18:30] worship
[2:18:32] amen so time
[2:18:34] comes you know when you plant a
[2:18:38] seed uh how many of you know those white
[2:18:43] peas they br in a pod like this
[2:18:48] white yeah those PE
[2:18:52] is it is green but also you know when
[2:18:55] the sun is
[2:18:58] come if you don't take them out of the
[2:19:01] farm
[2:19:03] quick the
[2:19:05] Shar will keep throwing away the
[2:19:09] sea have you seen that it keeps vomiting
[2:19:13] the
[2:19:14] sea there Comes A Time of
[2:19:18] maturity when the shark can't hold
[2:19:26] you are you together with me so you know
[2:19:31] and the
[2:19:33] sh are
[2:19:36] things that when necessary
[2:19:39] before but when you come to
[2:19:42] maturity you don't depend on those
[2:19:45] anymore they just vomit
[2:19:48] you amen so I want you to know that when
[2:19:53] certain classes of
[2:19:56] people amen when they feel like you are
[2:19:59] not necessary for them
[2:20:01] anymore don't you start saying oh my
[2:20:05] neighbors don't have a need of me or at
[2:20:08] my place of work they don't talk to me
[2:20:11] they feel like the level of your
[2:20:14] life is not what can benefit them so the
[2:20:19] seed has to be separate
[2:20:22] Hallelujah and we have come into the
[2:20:26] time where the sea is being gathered in
[2:20:30] the
[2:20:33] world Amen the Fe is thrown out of the
[2:20:38] shark because it has all the
[2:20:41] life the parent seed
[2:20:45] had and now the time has come for to
[2:20:50] give a test hallelujah
[2:20:54] hallelujah that look at what I look
[2:20:58] like I look like my
[2:21:01] parents look at my
[2:21:03] character I look like my
[2:21:06] parents praise God Amen First
[2:21:10] Corinthians
[2:21:12] 3:10
[2:21:15] 1310 but when that which is perfect is
[2:21:18] come
[2:21:21] that which is in
[2:21:23] part is done away
[2:21:26] with that which is in
[2:21:28] part was
[2:21:30] necessary at a certain level but when
[2:21:34] that which is perfect is
[2:21:39] come so we need to go back into the
[2:21:42] context of this
[2:21:44] scripture we have to pick it from the
[2:21:47] top of the chapter
[2:21:50] and see as we
[2:21:52] grow from the
[2:21:56] imperfect to the
[2:22:00] perfect verse
[2:22:02] one
[2:22:05] TKS TKS without the
[2:22:08] evidence the evident presence of
[2:22:13] character
[2:22:16] amen yeah what how can I say it's like
[2:22:20] speaking
[2:22:22] tongues without the evident
[2:22:26] presence of child
[2:22:30] himself the give of the
[2:22:33] spirit that's
[2:22:37] imperfect is talking about
[2:22:40] gifts that can be
[2:22:43] exercised but yet without
[2:22:47] charity so he's speaking now about the
[2:22:50] Corinth
[2:22:51] Church which is the reflection of
[2:22:55] Pentecost verse
[2:22:58] two
[2:22:59] gifts without the evident presence of
[2:23:02] Charity The
[2:23:06] Giver that is
[2:23:09] imperfect verse three
[2:23:12] benover without the evidence of the
[2:23:14] presence of character the I mean of char
[2:23:17] The Giver bover is the ability to give
[2:23:20] of what you
[2:23:21] have to support your
[2:23:24] community to support your church you
[2:23:29] bant you can give of your money but
[2:23:33] without
[2:23:34] charity that's
[2:23:36] imperfect so from verse
[2:23:39] one they exercise the gifts of
[2:23:44] T give some
[2:23:46] Miracles and exercise giving
[2:23:50] to charity
[2:23:52] organizations but they
[2:23:54] lacked the evidence of his
[2:23:57] presence all those good
[2:24:00] things were
[2:24:03] imperfect because while they did them
[2:24:07] they lacked long suffering they lacked
[2:24:10] kindness they were
[2:24:12] envious
[2:24:14] theyed meaning they were
[2:24:18] bful they behaved unseemly
[2:24:22] are you together with me because they
[2:24:24] did all that and charity
[2:24:28] was Char is long
[2:24:31] suffering but they had quick
[2:24:33] temper amen they had no
[2:24:36] feeling for the flock and they were
[2:24:40] easily
[2:24:41] provoked they rejoiced in
[2:24:45] iniquity they are happy when the hear of
[2:24:48] a brother who was Fallen
[2:24:52] they exercised all
[2:24:54] these negative
[2:24:57] attributes and yet still they held the
[2:25:03] gifts
[2:25:06] so
[2:25:07] then that which is perfect
[2:25:12] therefore is
[2:25:15] come it
[2:25:17] means that which is perfect
[2:25:21] will be
[2:25:22] higher than all these
[2:25:25] gifts that are mentioned in the
[2:25:28] chapter that which is
[2:25:31] perfect is the maturity of the
[2:25:34] seed in the body of the
[2:25:39] church listen to what brother Bram
[2:25:42] say in questions
[2:25:45] Anders
[2:25:47] please explain First Corinthians 13
[2:25:59] 8
[2:26:01] now that the perfect
[2:26:05] word is restored to the
[2:26:09] church are these virtues
[2:26:13] fulfilled then brother Bram says and
[2:26:17] when that which is perfect is come
[2:26:21] that which is in
[2:26:24] part it doesn't mean it is not part of
[2:26:29] the
[2:26:31] word but just holding things in
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:38] pieces shall be done away
[2:26:41] with hallelujah hallelujah are you
[2:26:45] together with me amen Paul say though I
[2:26:49] speak with tongues of men and
[2:26:52] angels and do all things but when that
[2:26:56] which is perfect is
[2:27:00] come now is there anything perfect but
[2:27:07] God no sir is God the
[2:27:12] perfect when that which is perfect is
[2:27:16] come and the
[2:27:18] perfect by the grace of God is the third
[2:27:25] Po and the
[2:27:27] perfect came
[2:27:29] down on the sunset
[2:27:32] Mountain with the interpretation of the
[2:27:38] word so the gifts are
[2:27:41] good they can reveal the hidden life of
[2:27:45] a
[2:27:47] person but that's as far as they can go
[2:27:52] but when that which is perfect is
[2:27:56] come and that being the perfect
[2:27:59] interpretation of the
[2:28:01] word with the Divine
[2:28:04] indication it will bring the power of
[2:28:10] transformation gifts are good they can
[2:28:14] show what is happening in that
[2:28:17] family but they can't bring Deliverance
[2:28:22] are you together with me but that which
[2:28:25] is
[2:28:26] perfect which is the perfect
[2:28:28] interpretation of the world when the
[2:28:30] word is
[2:28:32] taken to the heart of a Believer and he
[2:28:35] allows that word to
[2:28:38] work then that which is in part will not
[2:28:42] even be
[2:28:45] necessary because you are obedient to
[2:28:47] the word
[2:28:51] the word transforms your
[2:28:53] life the word designs
[2:28:56] you is in the
[2:28:59] perfect where rapturing faith is
[2:29:04] built amen maturity is not in the
[2:29:09] gifts maturity is allowing the
[2:29:12] word to have the
[2:29:14] preeminence in the life of a
[2:29:17] Believer amen
[2:29:20] life led by the
[2:29:21] word is the life led by the
[2:29:24] guy the person himself DWS in that life
[2:29:29] and if there is a
[2:29:31] gift that comes with Christ at the
[2:29:35] bottom of the heart is
[2:29:41] different
[2:29:43] Colossians
[2:29:46] 316 let the word of Christ dwell in you
[2:29:52] richly in all
[2:30:00] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[2:30:04] another in SS and
[2:30:09] HS and spiritual
[2:30:12] songs singing with Grace in your hearts
[2:30:15] to the
[2:30:18] Lord so maturity
[2:30:20] is the word dwelling in you
[2:30:22] richly and demonstrating
[2:30:26] itself as the living
[2:30:29] word amen it dwells in you
[2:30:34] richly that in you it begins to dig
[2:30:39] deep amen from the benefits that are
[2:30:42] hidden in
[2:30:44] there maturity is the word amen dwelling
[2:30:49] in you and making you a teaching
[2:30:53] life an admonishing
[2:30:56] life a life of
[2:30:59] worship that's
[2:31:01] maturity your life can teach amen you
[2:31:06] are un admonishing
[2:31:09] life and then even yourself you are
[2:31:13] singing melody in your
[2:31:15] heart you just feel like you should sing
[2:31:18] some
[2:31:20] amen so The Church Must goow to that
[2:31:24] maturity and that maturity must be
[2:31:28] constant amen when Israel relaxed on the
[2:31:34] experience they
[2:31:36] lost their
[2:31:38] Victory to the Gentile
[2:31:45] kingdoms when they were going
[2:31:47] out Moses told pharaoh
[2:31:51] we want to go out and Worship On The
[2:31:56] Mountain little they
[2:31:58] know that they were talking about Mount
[2:32:04] hor
[2:32:05] amen no no the Mount
[2:32:09] Zion that's where they wanted to go and
[2:32:14] worship oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah they
[2:32:17] were talking about the place where
[2:32:20] Christ was going to put his
[2:32:25] foot amen you
[2:32:28] see and then Pharaoh
[2:32:32] says you you you you can go but leave
[2:32:35] your children and the animals
[2:32:39] behind they said no whatever we have
[2:32:43] goes with us in the worship even our
[2:32:46] children we take them into the worship
[2:32:50] how many of us have told our children to
[2:32:53] pray it's very
[2:32:55] important The
[2:32:59] Exodus the
[2:33:01] Passover to enter into the place into
[2:33:05] the land of
[2:33:07] Canaan they had gone to
[2:33:10] worship everything they did was worship
[2:33:15] the way their lives was
[2:33:16] designed was it was designed around in
[2:33:20] the
[2:33:21] Tabernacle even their
[2:33:24] Clans they were governed under
[2:33:27] worship even when they
[2:33:29] planted what they ripped was governed
[2:33:33] under worship everything they leave
[2:33:36] worship when God calls you out he calls
[2:33:40] you out to
[2:33:44] worship he wants you to
[2:33:46] live a life of productive mat
[2:33:52] but when they started
[2:33:57] backsliding the Gentile
[2:34:00] Nations took them
[2:34:05] over we must be a productive
[2:34:10] maturity not children
[2:34:15] anymore as I said that gross
[2:34:20] just keep string
[2:34:24] in but then the H says that which you
[2:34:30] have till I
[2:34:32] come that is
[2:34:37] stability the Lord will ask that one he
[2:34:40] gave you that which you
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:45] have
[2:34:48] a the
[2:34:50] potentials to give
[2:34:53] bir another
[2:34:57] seat because the life is already on
[2:35:00] their
[2:35:02] side and the life on this
[2:35:05] seat is the very life which was in the
[2:35:10] previous are you together with me so any
[2:35:13] real SE that is
[2:35:16] mature has got the ability
[2:35:20] to give bir to another
[2:35:24] seed which matures like it
[2:35:28] matured that's what Isaiah
[2:35:34] 5 verse
[2:35:36] 12 and they that shall be of
[2:35:41] the shall build the old places
[2:35:53] are you together with me Lord G
[2:35:57] maturity such a
[2:35:59] maturity that I can also transfer that
[2:36:03] same
[2:36:04] life to my own children and they that of
[2:36:09] thee shall have the same life and they
[2:36:13] build the W
[2:36:16] places he says Thou shalt raise up the
[2:36:20] foundation of many
[2:36:24] generations and thou shall be called the
[2:36:27] repair of the bridge the rest of
[2:36:37] Towell that's the way God looks
[2:36:41] at and if God has some mature seeds
[2:36:45] here he's looking at them to see
[2:36:50] that that life must be
[2:36:53] constant that they've got the
[2:36:55] ability to pass it on they
[2:36:59] testify they pray they do everything to
[2:37:03] keep that life
[2:37:05] alive so when we are
[2:37:10] [Music]
[2:37:11] gone we want the seed Left
[2:37:15] Behind to mature enough to maintain The
[2:37:19] Life of Christ in the
[2:37:23] church that's what Isaiah is
[2:37:26] saying that shall be of
[2:37:30] the shall build the old west
[2:37:34] places hallelujah hallelujah the pastor
[2:37:37] will not
[2:37:38] worry to be away for a
[2:37:41] month because the people left behind
[2:37:45] they got a hold of that
[2:37:48] life and it is
[2:37:52] constant not a child
[2:37:55] anymore so that's the
[2:37:58] SE I want
[2:38:00] leave when I'm gone I don't want leave
[2:38:04] behind another Book of
[2:38:08] Judges I want to live
[2:38:10] behind real fertilized
[2:38:15] eggs amen
[2:38:19] the Lord they have fed on the work and
[2:38:22] the world is now being
[2:38:28] productive let us look at the contrary
[2:38:34] here judges chter
[2:38:36] 2
[2:38:38] verse I'm finishing in a short
[2:38:43] while and the people served the Lord all
[2:38:46] the days of Joshua
[2:38:51] and all the days of the ERS that outed
[2:38:56] Joshua who had seen all the great works
[2:38:59] of the Lord that he did for
[2:39:05] Israel and Joshua the son of n the
[2:39:09] servant of the Lord died being 110 years
[2:39:13] old
[2:39:15] [Music]
[2:39:21] and they bued him in the border of his
[2:39:24] inheritance in Tim
[2:39:32] timus the M of
[2:39:35] [Music]
[2:39:37] epim on the side of the
[2:39:42] [Applause]
[2:39:43] H and all that Generations were gathered
[2:39:47] unto their fathers
[2:39:53] and there arose another
[2:39:58] generation which knew not the
[2:40:03] Lord no yet The Works which he had done
[2:40:06] for
[2:40:09] Israel and the scripture says they were
[2:40:12] sons of
[2:40:16] bar andal means good for nothing
[2:40:22] handsome but
[2:40:26] nothing strong muscles but
[2:40:30] nothing they took over the
[2:40:38] church I don't want the church to be
[2:40:40] dependent on one
[2:40:43] man because after those had
[2:40:47] died the class of the
[2:40:51] maturity there came up a
[2:40:54] people that knew not the Lord and then
[2:40:57] the Gentile
[2:40:59] nations would come and overrun them and
[2:41:03] the Bible says God would raise a
[2:41:06] judge and God was with the
[2:41:09] judge and after the death of the judge
[2:41:13] amen I mean and when the judge
[2:41:16] comes amen then God would give Victory
[2:41:22] to the
[2:41:23] judge but when the judge die again the
[2:41:27] nations take over we don't want to have
[2:41:30] a church that stands on the stability of
[2:41:36] [Music]
[2:41:39] one we must
[2:41:42] grow whereby we shall be
[2:41:46] mature we adopted children
[2:41:50] God can have confidence in
[2:41:53] us that we may enter the
[2:41:56] holiest by the
[2:41:58] blood and that's maturity and
[2:42:02] stability so that every one of us has
[2:42:06] access to the holy of holies toad his CA
[2:42:10] with
[2:42:14] God not waiting for Deon
[2:42:17] SW not wa for pastor
[2:42:20] J but we have got the
[2:42:23] ability to enter into
[2:42:25] theol by the blood of
[2:42:28] Jesus that's not children
