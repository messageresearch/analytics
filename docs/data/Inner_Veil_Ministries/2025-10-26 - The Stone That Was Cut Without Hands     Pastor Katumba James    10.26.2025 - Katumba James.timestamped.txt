[1:06:09] month,
[1:06:11] that is 2nd of November,
[1:06:15] we're going to have the Lord's Supper.
[1:06:17] That means we shall have two services
[1:06:21] for all of us. Then at five we start the
[1:06:23] Lord's suppor
[1:06:36] time is running fast.
[1:06:39] Praise the name of our Lord. So we are
[1:06:42] going to have our youth concert in

[1:20:35] what you have done. And now we pray
[1:20:38] heavenly father
[1:20:40] that you may take charge heavenly lord
[1:20:43] speak to our hearts the words of eternal
[1:20:47] life
[1:20:48] and we are grateful lord
[1:20:51] and all these other things are going to
[1:20:53] pass away
[1:20:55] but your word will never pass away and
[1:20:58] we want to receive that eternal portion
[1:21:02] that will transform our lives. bless us
[1:21:05] all together
[1:21:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus. We pray
[1:21:08] and ask this.
[1:21:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Let us go to the book of Daniel.
[1:21:17] Daniel chapter 2.
[1:21:23] Then we are reading from verse
[1:21:28] Daniel chapter 2.
[1:21:34] We're reading from verse 31 to verse 35.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Though, O king, so and
[1:21:46] behold, a great image. This great image
[1:21:50] whose brightness was excellent stood
[1:21:53] before you, and the form thereof was
[1:21:56] terrible.
[1:22:14] This image's head was of fine gold, his
[1:22:18] breast and his arms of silver, his belly
[1:22:21] and his thighs of brass.
[1:22:26] His
[1:22:44] legs of iron, his feet of iron and part
[1:22:47] of clay.
[1:22:57] Though so still that a stone was cut out
[1:23:00] without hands, which smote the image
[1:23:03] upon his feet, that were of iron and
[1:23:07] clay, and break them to pieces.
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:25] Then was the iron, the clay, the brass,
[1:23:29] the silver, and the gold broken to
[1:23:32] pieces together, and became like the
[1:23:35] chaff of summer. Three things flows, and
[1:23:38] the wind carried them away, and no place
[1:23:41] was found for them. And the stone that
[1:23:44] smought the image became a great
[1:23:46] mountain and filled the whole earth.
[1:24:26] May God bless of his word.
[1:24:29] You may be seated.
[1:24:31] So my subject,
[1:24:34] the stone cut without hands.
[1:24:40] We've read this in Daniel chapter 2:34.
[1:24:47] Daniel 2:34
[1:24:51] that though still a stone was cut out
[1:24:55] without hands,
[1:25:00] So we want to take time and look at what
[1:25:02] this stone is
[1:25:06] and what impact
[1:25:10] you know on the image.
[1:25:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Now you
[1:25:15] notice here that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:25:19] you know he was the king of Babylon
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; and Babylon was a great empire.
[1:25:29] you know, it was big.
[1:25:32] It was dominating all the known parts of
[1:25:35] the world
[1:25:39] all over the world. And now
[1:25:41] Nebuchadnezzar as the king,
[1:25:45] praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:25:48] Nebuchadnezzar as the king,
[1:25:51] you know, he was of course put on that
[1:25:53] throne by God.
[1:25:56] You remember when God was telling the
[1:25:58] children of Israel
[1:26:01] that I will send my servant
[1:26:04] Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:26:08] So he allowed Nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:11] to go and take the children of Israel
[1:26:13] into captivity.
[1:26:17] And so when the children of Israel were
[1:26:19] taken into captivity into Babylon,
[1:26:23] praise the name of our Lord.
[1:26:25] Daniel
[1:26:27] is one of those unac
[1:26:31] you know living in the kingdom of
[1:26:33] Babylon.
[1:26:36] Nowadar
[1:26:39] he had a dream at night
[1:26:42] and when he dreamt at night he forgot
[1:26:46] the dream.
[1:26:49] And so now one thing he would remember
[1:26:51] in the morning
[1:26:53] I dreamt
[1:26:55] But he wouldn't tell what he dream.
[1:26:58] So then he went to the wise men
[1:27:02] and he told them tell me my dream
[1:27:06] and what the dream means.
[1:27:09] They told him it's not possible
[1:27:12] for us to tell you your dream.
[1:27:15] You tell us your dream then we shall
[1:27:18] tell you the interpretation.
[1:27:20] Then he said you are looking for reasons
[1:27:22] to deceive me.
[1:27:25] He demanded it.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Now that's very interesting
[1:27:32] that you know he said tell me what I
[1:27:34] dreamt
[1:27:36] and tell me what it means.
[1:27:39] And the Bible says it's only God who
[1:27:42] knows the secret things.
[1:27:46] You know the things that are concealed.
[1:27:50] So now he commanded that all the wise
[1:27:53] men be put to death
[1:27:58] because they told the king the his dream
[1:28:01] or even the interpretation.
[1:28:04] And then they came to Daniel
[1:28:06] and then his other fellows
[1:28:09] and they were telling them we are going
[1:28:10] to kill you
[1:28:12] because you told the king the dream.
[1:28:17] Then Daniel told his friends, "Let us
[1:28:20] pray. There is a dream the king had
[1:28:25] and he forgot it and he wants to kill
[1:28:28] all the wise men of Israel."
[1:28:31] So they prayed and then the Bible says
[1:28:36] God revealed the secret
[1:28:39] to Daniel. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:28:42] And our God works in ways
[1:28:47] that are beyond understanding.
[1:28:51] Like the children who are doing
[1:28:52] examination,
[1:28:54] who are going to do examination,
[1:28:57] you pray to God, Lord, give me wisdom
[1:29:01] to understand the question
[1:29:04] and then be able to interpret the
[1:29:06] question to give the right answer to the
[1:29:09] question or maybe in some issues in your
[1:29:12] life,
[1:29:14] some things you don't understand,
[1:29:16] some things you don't know about,
[1:29:19] you can pray to the Lord.
[1:29:21] I said Lord reveal this thing to me.
[1:29:24] Lord show me what this thing mean. But
[1:29:26] now also another thing we need to
[1:29:28] understand
[1:29:30] is that God cannot bring a mysteriously
[1:29:34] without appointing a person there
[1:29:38] who is going to interpret it.
[1:29:40] There was no way God would give far a
[1:29:44] dream
[1:29:46] if there was no Joseph God.
[1:29:49] And this is what brother Brandham
[1:29:50] teaches us, you know, because dreams if
[1:29:54] they are mysterious,
[1:29:56] they need to be interpreted by the
[1:29:58] prophet.
[1:30:00] But yet, not all dreams are mysterious.
[1:30:04] There are dreams that are plain.
[1:30:09] You know, like when Joseph dream,
[1:30:12] the angel telling him, "Don't fear to
[1:30:15] take your wife Mary."
[1:30:17] That was an open dream.
[1:30:20] Then when God told Joseph, take Jesus to
[1:30:24] Egypt, it need didn't need an
[1:30:26] interpretation
[1:30:28] because there was no prophet at that
[1:30:30] time to interpret that dream. But now by
[1:30:34] the time since a dream with a mystery,
[1:30:38] there must be a prophet he has appointed
[1:30:41] to interpret that dream.
[1:30:44] Praise the name of our Lord. There's
[1:30:46] somebody who called me. I think it was
[1:30:48] on a radio program. He said, "I dreamt.
[1:30:52] I was in forest.
[1:30:56] I was in Mira forest."
[1:30:59] Then I said, then he said, "What does it
[1:31:01] mean?"
[1:31:03] I told him I'm not an interpreter of
[1:31:04] dreams.
[1:31:08] Praise the name of Allah. You know
[1:31:10] people want to go by dreams.
[1:31:13] Then there is somebody who has written a
[1:31:15] book on dreams
[1:31:17] and then he said when you get a dream
[1:31:19] like this it means this when you get
[1:31:22] this put away those things.
[1:31:26] Praise the name of God. If God gives you
[1:31:28] a dream,
[1:31:30] he will give you the understanding of
[1:31:32] it.
[1:31:34] You pray over it and then the Lord will
[1:31:37] show you what it's meaning.
[1:31:40] Praise the name of our Lord. So when
[1:31:42] Daniel got the dream,
[1:31:46] when he saw the vision of the dream of
[1:31:49] Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:31:51] God gave him the interpretation.
[1:31:55] Even now in the times of brother brother
[1:31:58] people would come with dreams
[1:32:01] and then they tell him their dreams
[1:32:04] and what God does he reveals to the
[1:32:07] prophet what you have dreamt
[1:32:10] and then he gives him the
[1:32:12] interpretation.
[1:32:13] That's how the Lord does it.
[1:32:17] And brother Brandham would say you came
[1:32:19] and told me your dream but you forgot a
[1:32:22] lot of things.
[1:32:24] Then is the one who reminds the one who
[1:32:26] has dreamt that you dreamt like this.
[1:32:28] You were here said yes yes yes that is
[1:32:30] true
[1:32:32] so that so that you can believe that the
[1:32:35] interpretation
[1:32:38] is correct. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:32:41] Like when you would tell people in
[1:32:42] discernment
[1:32:45] for example that congressman
[1:32:49] congressman opera who came to the
[1:32:52] meeting
[1:32:54] brotherham told him about his past life
[1:32:59] things that he knows in private alone.
[1:33:04] He told him ABCD then he told him God
[1:33:08] has healed you stand up. Then the the
[1:33:12] WIFE TOLD HIM, "NO, DON'T."
[1:33:15] THEN the the congressman told the wife,
[1:33:18] "If he can tell me things I know alone,
[1:33:23] he knows even what is in the future.
[1:33:26] Praise the name of our Lord." LIKE
[1:33:28] MOSES, GOD SHOWED HIM THE PAST.
[1:33:32] In the beginning, God created heaven and
[1:33:34] earth.
[1:33:36] YOU ASK MOSES, "WHERE were you?
[1:33:40] So if you would to see what is in THE
[1:33:42] PAST
[1:33:44] WHERE HE wasn't
[1:33:46] then you should believe HIM
[1:33:49] FOR TELLING YOU WHAT is going to be in
[1:33:51] the future.
[1:33:52] And this is the message that we have.
[1:33:55] Praise the name of our Lord telling us
[1:33:57] what IS IN THE PAST TELLING US WHAT IS
[1:34:00] in the present. So we should believe for
[1:34:02] even what is in the future.
[1:34:05] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[1:34:08] Daniel got this dream,
[1:34:10] he said there was
[1:34:13] an image
[1:34:16] very exceedingly dreadful image,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; an image of a human being.
[1:34:25] Then it had the head of God.
[1:34:28] Now Daniel
[1:34:30] interprets the head of God
[1:34:34] in Daniel chapter 2.
[1:34:37] And then verse 37,
[1:34:39] he says, "Though O king
[1:34:43] at the King of Kings,
[1:34:46] the God of heaven has given you a
[1:34:49] kingdom
[1:34:52] and power and strength and glory.
[1:34:57] And wheresoever the children of men
[1:34:59] dwell,
[1:35:03] the beasts of the field and the falls of
[1:35:05] the heaven,
[1:35:09] He has given them into thy hand
[1:35:13] and has made thee ruler over them all.
[1:35:20] You are this head of God
[1:35:25] and God is excellent,
[1:35:29] you know. So the kingdom of Babylon,
[1:35:32] you know, was that HEAD OF GOD
[1:35:36] NOW WE NEED ALSO TO understand
[1:35:40] that the days of the Gentiles
[1:35:44] they start from that time
[1:35:47] when Nebuchadnezzar took over Jerusalem.
[1:35:52] So the days of the Gentiles
[1:35:56] ruling over Jerusalem
[1:35:58] started with Nebuchadnezzar
[1:36:01] and until now
[1:36:04] Jerusalem
[1:36:05] is not full in the hands of Israel.
[1:36:11] Palestine demanding half of Jerusalem.
[1:36:15] The international community
[1:36:19] they said Jerusalem is an international
[1:36:21] city.
[1:36:24] So it doesn't belong to only one
[1:36:25] country.
[1:36:27] They have dominion over it.
[1:36:31] And so YOU SEE THAT ALL THE BATTLES OF
[1:36:33] MIDDLE East
[1:36:35] are focused on Jerusalem.
[1:36:40] The Muslims have the eastern part.
[1:36:44] the Arabs
[1:36:47] where they have that mosque
[1:36:49] and that mosque is in the same place of
[1:36:53] Solomon's temple.
[1:36:57] The Jews want to go back to worship.
[1:37:00] The Muslims said this belongs to us.
[1:37:04] Praise the name OF ALLAH. BUT ALL this
[1:37:08] the dominion of Jerusalem
[1:37:12] started in the days of Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:37:16] Praise the name of our Lord. So now he
[1:37:18] said you are the the gohead of God.
[1:37:23] And then he says then after you in verse
[1:37:26] 39
[1:37:28] shall arise another kingdom
[1:37:33] inferior to you.
[1:37:35] So now you will notice here
[1:37:38] that the head of God is a kingdom
[1:37:42] gentile kingdom. And then NOW FROM THE
[1:37:45] HEAD of God,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; there was the breast and the the arms
[1:37:51] and the belly of of silver.
[1:37:58] And that was the Persian Median kingdom.
[1:38:03] And then from that there was the thighs
[1:38:07] of brass.
[1:38:11] That was the Greek kingdom.
[1:38:15] Then after that there was the legs of
[1:38:18] iron.
[1:38:21] And then the feet
[1:38:24] the feet part of iron and part of clay.
[1:38:30] That's the Roman kingdom.
[1:38:33] Now we can pick up a scripture here.
[1:38:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:38:41] Daniel chapter 5,
[1:38:46] And then we read in verse 30,
[1:38:51] the Bible says,
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; "In that night was Bela, the king of the
[1:38:56] child in slain.
[1:39:03] Now Belshazza was the king of Babylon.
[1:39:09] of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:39:13] in verse 31. And Darius the Median took
[1:39:17] the kingdom being about three score and
[1:39:20] two years.
[1:39:32] So we see that the Medians
[1:39:35] they took over the Babylonian kingdom.
[1:39:39] So you can see from Babylon
[1:39:42] the head of God now to actually medi
[1:39:47] Persian kingdom,
[1:39:50] you know, the silver of the chest and
[1:39:54] then the arms
[1:39:58] and then from the that kingdom
[1:40:02] there was the Greek kingdom
[1:40:05] under Alexander the Great.
[1:40:09] which was actually
[1:40:11] the size of brass.
[1:40:16] And then from that
[1:40:18] we come to the last gentile kingdom.
[1:40:23] The fourth gentile kingdom
[1:40:27] which was actually the legs of iron
[1:40:34] and then the toes of clay and iron
[1:40:40] and that is the Roman kingdom.
[1:40:44] And so it was under the Roman kingdom
[1:40:49] that a stone was cut
[1:40:52] without hand and then it came and smote
[1:40:56] the image
[1:40:59] and it smote. The Bible says
[1:41:02] it smote the image
[1:41:06] upon the feet
[1:41:08] and it broke the iron and clay
[1:41:12] and broke them to pieces.
[1:41:16] Iron and clay
[1:41:20] and brass
[1:41:22] and silver and gold were all broken up
[1:41:26] in pieces
[1:41:29] and taken away.
[1:41:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Now this is
[1:41:34] prophecy.
[1:41:37] Praise the name of the Lord of what will
[1:41:39] be happening
[1:41:41] under the gentile kingdom.
[1:41:45] Now you notice THAT WHEN THE STONE IS
[1:41:48] CUT,
[1:41:50] it destroys the whole image.
[1:41:55] And one thing we also need to know that
[1:41:58] the kingdoms of this world
[1:42:00] are the kingdoms of the devil.
[1:42:04] At the time we are living in, the
[1:42:06] kingdoms of this world, are the kingdoms
[1:42:09] of the devil.
[1:42:12] When Pilate
[1:42:14] asked Jesus
[1:42:16] that are you also a king?
[1:42:20] Let us go to the book of Luke.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Got the
[1:42:25] book of Luke.
[1:42:33] And then we can read in Luke chapter
[1:42:37] 23.
[1:42:47] And then we read in verse
[1:42:55] okay I beg your pardon. It is actually
[1:42:57] John
[1:43:02] the book of John
[1:43:05] and then chapter 18
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse 35
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Pilate answered
[1:43:16] am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief
[1:43:19] priests have delivered thee unto me.
[1:43:22] What hast thou done?
[1:43:35] Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of
[1:43:39] this world. If my kingdom were of this
[1:43:42] world, then would my servants fight that
[1:43:45] I should not be delivered to the Jews.
[1:43:48] But now is my kingdom not from hence.
[1:43:53] for
[1:44:05] next.
[1:44:15] Praise the name of our Lord. So he's
[1:44:17] saying my kingdoms are not of this
[1:44:19] world.
[1:44:22] But the devil testifies
[1:44:25] that if you will worship me,
[1:44:28] then I will give you all these kingdoms,
[1:44:33] for they are delivered unto me.
[1:44:37] Praise the name of our Lord. In Matthew
[1:44:40] 4:8,
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; again, the devil takes him up into an
[1:44:46] exceeding high mountain and shows him
[1:44:48] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[1:44:51] glory of them.
[1:45:02] and says unto him, "All these things
[1:45:05] will I give you if you will fall down
[1:45:08] and worship me."
[1:45:14] Praise the name of our Lord. Satan
[1:45:16] saying, "These are my kingdoms."
[1:45:21] Now you will notice here
[1:45:25] THAT WHATEVER kingdom was succeeding,
[1:45:30] the devil was taking ownership of that
[1:45:33] kingdom.
[1:45:36] Praise the name of the Lord because he's
[1:45:38] the prince of the air.
[1:45:41] He rules the kingdoms of the earth.
[1:45:44] So now when Daniel
[1:45:47] was under the Pian kingdom
[1:45:51] and Daniel prayed,
[1:45:54] his prayers were held.
[1:45:58] The answers were heard.
[1:46:02] Let us go to the book of Daniel.
[1:46:05] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:46:09] Let us go the book of Daniel.
[1:46:14] And then we can read in
[1:46:17] chapter 10.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 10. And then we read in
[1:46:25] verse
[1:46:26] 12.
[1:46:30] Then said he unto me, "Fear not, Daniel,
[1:46:34] for from the first day that you did set
[1:46:36] thine heart to understand, and to
[1:46:38] chasten thyself before thy God. Thy
[1:46:42] words were heard, and I am come for thy
[1:46:45] words.
[1:47:03] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[1:47:07] withtood me one and 20 days. But lo, one
[1:47:12] of the chief princes came to help me.
[1:47:14] And I remained there with the kings of
[1:47:17] Persia.
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:35] Now, this was an angel telling Daniel,
[1:47:39] "From the time you prayed,
[1:47:42] God had your prayers
[1:47:44] and I came down to respond to them.
[1:47:48] But for 21 days,
[1:47:51] the prince of Persia
[1:47:54] withtood me. Now we need to know how
[1:47:57] Satan works.
[1:48:00] That Satan would try to withhold your
[1:48:03] blessing.
[1:48:06] Satan will try to hold the answer of
[1:48:08] your prayers.
[1:48:11] So now when your heart is moved to pray
[1:48:13] over something,
[1:48:16] don't let it go. Praise the name of our
[1:48:20] Lord. Keep on believing God. KEEP ON
[1:48:23] ASKING GOD REGARDLESS OF THE OPPOSITION
[1:48:26] THAT COMES.
[1:48:28] Regardless of maybe there is no answer,
[1:48:30] I HAVE GOT YOU NEED TO HOLD TO THAT.
[1:48:35] SO EVEN DANIEL, he held to his prayers.
[1:48:39] HE BELIEVED GOD IS GOING TO ANSWER HIM.
[1:48:42] So he kept on praying and he didn't know
[1:48:45] what was happening you know in the
[1:48:47] spiritual world.
[1:48:49] And sometimes also we may not know
[1:48:51] what's HAPPENING IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.
[1:48:54] BUT YOU NEED not to give up.
[1:48:57] Praise the name of OUR LORD. DON'T GIVE
[1:48:59] UP ON THE WORD OF GOD. DON'T GIVE UP ON
[1:49:02] OPPOSITION.
[1:49:04] DON'T GIVE UP BECAUSE YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.
[1:49:08] PRAISE THE NAME OF OUR LORD. DON'T GIVE
[1:49:09] UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILED. You just
[1:49:12] keep on holding on.
[1:49:14] Praise the name OF OUR LORD KNOWING WHOM
[1:49:17] you have believed. THAT WAS HOW DANIEL
[1:49:20] WAS HOLDING ON HIS HAND, PRAYING
[1:49:22] CONTINUOUSLY.
[1:49:24] And then the prince of air
[1:49:27] center was busy resisting the answer OF
[1:49:30] DANIEL.
[1:49:31] BUT DANIEL WOULD NOT GIVE IT. PRAISE THE
[1:49:34] NAME of our Lord. He kept ON PRAYING.
[1:49:37] HE KEPT ON WAITING ON THE LORD. AND THAT
[1:49:39] SHOULD ALSO BE THE SAME THING WITH US
[1:49:42] THAT I'M NOT GIVING UP ON WHAT I DESIRE
[1:49:44] FROM GOD. REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS
[1:49:47] HAPPENING, REGARDLESS OF THE FAILURES,
[1:49:50] REGARDLESS OF THE FRUSTRATION,
[1:49:53] REGARDLESS OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
[1:49:56] YOU SHOULD NOT give up. Praise the name
[1:49:58] of our Lord. HE KEPT ON PRAYING
[1:50:01] UNTIL WHEN THERE was a breakthrough
[1:50:04] that Satan would not withstand it
[1:50:06] anymore.
[1:50:08] Praise the name of our LORD BECAUSE THE
[1:50:09] BIBLE SAYS resist the devil and you will
[1:50:13] flee away. But if the devil comes weak
[1:50:16] and then you just fall. You're not
[1:50:18] resisting him. YOU NEED TO RESIST THE
[1:50:21] DEVIL IN WHATEVER FORM THAT HE COMES.
[1:50:25] WHATEVER EVIL THOUGHTS THAT HE PUTS UPON
[1:50:27] YOU, MAYBE YOU KNOW NEGATIVE IMAGINATION
[1:50:31] OR NEGATIVE ANYTHING, YOU JUST KEEP ON
[1:50:34] REJECTING IT. Say this is not part of
[1:50:36] me. I REFUSE THIS. I REJECT SICKNESS.
[1:50:41] I REJECT FAILURE. Praise the name of our
[1:50:44] Lord. AND THEN YOU CONFESS IT. PRAISE
[1:50:47] THE name of our Lord. YOU BE LIKE
[1:50:49] JOSHUA. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS.
[1:50:53] MUCH AS we see THE SONS OF ANAKAH BIGGER
[1:50:55] THAN US,
[1:50:57] but let US GO ALL AT ONCE. PRAISE THE
[1:50:59] NAME OF OUR Lord because we have the
[1:51:01] promise of God.
[1:51:03] Praise the name OF OUR LORD. DANIEL
[1:51:05] NEVER gave up
[1:51:08] 21 days.
[1:51:10] He kept on pressing
[1:51:12] and then the angel gave him the reason.
[1:51:15] YOU KNOW WHY I'M GLAD TO COME? THE
[1:51:17] PRINCE OF PERSIA. WHO WAS THE PRINCE OF
[1:51:20] PERSIA?
[1:51:21] NOW WE NOTICE THAT Daniel
[1:51:24] sought God in the days of Cyrus the king
[1:51:27] of Persia.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Cyrus,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; not this Cyrus here. Now
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; you know in Daniel 10:1
[1:51:40] it says in the third year of Cyrus king
[1:51:43] of Persia
[1:51:49] a thing was revealed unto Daniel.
[1:51:55] So on earth it was Cyrus the king of
[1:51:58] Persia.
[1:52:01] He was the physical king.
[1:52:04] But then there was a prince of air over
[1:52:06] that people.
[1:52:09] So you'll notice that Satan would take
[1:52:12] the same title
[1:52:15] of the kingdoms that are ruling THE
[1:52:17] EARTH
[1:52:19] RIGHT now is the prince of the world.
[1:52:23] ALL the kingdoms of the world
[1:52:26] because there are many kingdoms of the
[1:52:27] world. We have the kingdom of Uganda,
[1:52:31] the kingdom of Kenya, kingdom of
[1:52:33] Tanzania, all these different kingdoms.
[1:52:36] Now, Satan says, "I'm now the prince.
[1:52:41] I lure them. I govern them. Praise the
[1:52:46] name of our Lord." So now, Satan
[1:52:49] is the prince of the kingdoms of this
[1:52:51] world.
[1:52:53] NOW OUR LORD JESUS Christ is the stone
[1:52:57] that was cut without hand
[1:53:02] and that stone that was cut without hand
[1:53:06] comes to smite the image
[1:53:09] at the time
[1:53:11] of the Roman Empire.
[1:53:14] Now we need to realize HERE THAT OUR
[1:53:18] LORD JESUS CHRIST WAS BORN in the Roman
[1:53:22] Empire.
[1:53:24] Rome was lulling.
[1:53:27] You remember the emperor.
[1:53:30] You know who declared THAT PEOPLE SHOULD
[1:53:32] GO FOR census
[1:53:35] and then the Joseph and Mary.
[1:53:39] They had to go to Bethlehem Judea.
[1:53:43] SO IT WAS UNDER THE ROMAN Empire
[1:53:46] that the Lord Jesus Christ was born. AND
[1:53:50] IT IS STILL UNDER the Roman Empire
[1:53:53] that the Lord Jesus CHRIST AS A STONE
[1:53:56] CUT WITHOUT hands
[1:53:58] and destroys the kingdoms of the
[1:54:00] Gentile.
[1:54:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:54:05] message
[1:54:09] the mark of the beast,
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says
[1:54:15] every Orthodox believer here knows that
[1:54:17] the gentile reign
[1:54:23] began with King Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:54:27] Is that right? Every Orthodox believer
[1:54:30] is knows that. And King Nebadnezzar
[1:54:36] had a vision
[1:54:38] and Daniel gave him the interpretation.
[1:54:43] Is that right? And it was the head of
[1:54:45] God
[1:54:47] which was the Babylonian.
[1:54:50] The second was Medis and Persian.
[1:54:57] The next was the Greek Empire.
[1:55:01] Then the Roman Empire
[1:55:05] and at the end of the Roman Empire,
[1:55:09] Jesus Christ was the rock
[1:55:13] that was held out of the mountains
[1:55:15] without the hands
[1:55:22] and rolled in
[1:55:24] and broke down the image.
[1:55:27] And then that stone covered the earth.
[1:55:31] And how that in the last days
[1:55:36] when they broke up into these many
[1:55:38] different kingdoms,
[1:55:42] you know,
[1:55:45] and so forth the to
[1:55:49] was iron and clay.
[1:55:53] And it means the And it means that the
[1:55:57] prophet said, "As much as though did
[1:56:01] iron and clay won't mix together,
[1:56:07] neither will this leave one to another,
[1:56:13] but they will mingle the seat.
[1:56:16] In other words, they will marry into
[1:56:19] them
[1:56:22] trying to raise their children and break
[1:56:24] for the powers
[1:56:29] like that. And you know that's the
[1:56:31] truth. But a hold of it got
[1:56:36] now in the message the beginning and the
[1:56:38] ending of the gentile dispensation.
[1:56:43] The head of God has passed away as
[1:56:46] Daniel said it would.
[1:56:51] The Babylonian kingdom
[1:56:53] succeeding that he said would be Medis
[1:56:56] and Persian.
[1:57:01] They succeeded the Babylonian kingdom
[1:57:06] and they fell away to who?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; The Grecians. Alexander the Great.
[1:57:14] And they fell away
[1:57:17] to what? To the Romans.
[1:57:21] And the Romans broke up to all the world
[1:57:26] and the eastern and western rock,
[1:57:30] two legs.
[1:57:32] And he said iron and clay was on the
[1:57:36] toes,
[1:57:41] the 10 toes.
[1:57:43] the 10 kingdoms.
[1:57:45] And he said they would not mix
[1:57:50] and they intermar
[1:57:53] among one another, Romanism and
[1:57:56] Protestantism.
[1:58:00] And in that day when the thing exists,
[1:58:06] then the stone that was held out of the
[1:58:08] mountain without hands
[1:58:13] and he rolled in and broke the things to
[1:58:17] pieces
[1:58:19] and it took the place of the image.
[1:58:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So you see
[1:58:25] the kingdoms of the world
[1:58:28] and now you see that the gentile
[1:58:30] kingdoms
[1:58:32] have been doaining over THE EARTH.
[1:58:35] BUT NOW we are living in the time for
[1:58:39] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:58:40] Christ.
[1:58:42] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:58:45] message
[1:58:50] he says, "And so he come first
[1:58:57] redeem his bride,
[1:59:00] second as the rapture,
[1:59:04] to take away his bride. He comes third
[1:59:09] with his bride, king and queen. After
[1:59:14] that's when many people are expecting
[1:59:16] the coming.
[1:59:20] Praise the name of OUR LORD. NOW GOD
[1:59:23] does things in threes.
[1:59:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You know as
[1:59:28] father, son and holy ghost not meaning
[1:59:32] there are three person but the same God,
[1:59:36] the same person
[1:59:39] manifesting himself in different ways.
[1:59:43] So even the Lord Jesus Christ come three
[1:59:46] times. The first time he came was coming
[1:59:50] to redeem the bride
[1:59:52] when he was born here on earth
[1:59:55] and then the second time he comes. He
[1:59:58] comes to pick the bride he has redeemed
[2:00:02] and that is the rapture and that's the
[2:00:05] time we are living in. We are living in
[2:00:07] the time
[2:00:09] for the second coming of our Lord Jesus
[2:00:11] Christ.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So he takes
[2:00:15] the bride.
[2:00:17] Praise the name of our Lord. And he's
[2:00:19] with the bride in the air for three and
[2:00:20] a half years.
[2:00:23] He's with the bride in the air for three
[2:00:27] and a half years.
[2:00:29] Now the during the time of the three and
[2:00:31] a half years,
[2:00:33] it is A GREAT TRIBULATION.
[2:00:37] AND IT IS DURING these three and a half
[2:00:39] years
[2:00:40] that the gospel
[2:00:43] turns away from the Gentiles
[2:00:45] and then it goes to the Jews.
[2:00:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Now at the
[2:00:50] end of the three and a half years, THE
[2:00:52] LORD JESUS CHRIST COMES back
[2:00:56] to rule over the earth. Now when he
[2:00:59] COMES BACK, HE COMES BACK AS THE STONE
[2:01:02] CUT WITHOUT HAND.
[2:01:05] AND THEN HE DESTROYS ALL THE KINGDOMS OF
[2:01:08] THIS world
[2:01:10] and he establishes his millennial reign
[2:01:12] here on earth.
[2:01:14] Praise the name of OUR LORD. BUT NOW IN
[2:01:17] THE BIBLE SAYS, let us go to Daniel
[2:01:19] chapter 2.
[2:01:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Daniel
[2:01:24] chapter 2 and then verse 44.
[2:01:30] The Bible says, "And in the days of the
[2:01:34] these kings shall the God of heaven set
[2:01:38] up a kingdom which shall never be
[2:01:40] destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be
[2:01:44] left to other people, but it shall break
[2:01:46] in pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[2:01:50] and shall stand forever.
[2:02:09] Guang.
[2:02:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So we are
[2:02:25] living in the days of these kings.
[2:02:28] He said God of heaven
[2:02:31] to establish his kingdom.
[2:02:35] And now God is establishing his kingdom
[2:02:40] by the preaching of the gospel of Jesus
[2:02:43] Christ.
[2:02:45] BEHOLD the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[2:02:49] And so he's calling men TO BE BORN INTO
[2:02:52] HIS KINGDOM.
[2:02:55] ACCEPTING THE LORD JESUS AS THEIR
[2:02:56] PERSONAL SAVIOR,
[2:02:59] being born again. We are living in this
[2:03:02] TIME THAT THE GOSPEL IS GOING FOR
[2:03:06] ALL MEN.
[2:03:09] Come in. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:03:12] JUST LIKE NOAH WAS CALLING THEM TO enter
[2:03:14] into the ark,
[2:03:16] YOU KNOW, HE'S CALLING PEOPLE COME INTO
[2:03:19] THIS THIRD EXODUS.
[2:03:22] COME UNTO me you are heavy laden.
[2:03:25] I will give you rest. Praise the name of
[2:03:28] our Lord. So Christ praise the name of
[2:03:31] our LORD TO THE JEWS IN HIS FIRST
[2:03:33] COMING.
[2:03:36] He was the rejected stone.
[2:03:40] HE WAS THE STONE OF STUMBLING.
[2:03:43] They couldn't understand WHAT HE WAS
[2:03:44] ABOUT.
[2:03:46] He blinded them. Praise the name of OUR
[2:03:49] LORD. BUT NOW TO THE BELIEVERS
[2:03:53] CHRIST IS A PRECIOUS STONE.
[2:03:56] Praise the name of our Lord TO THE
[2:03:58] BELIEVERS.
[2:03:59] Christ
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; is the cornerstone
[2:04:03] to the believers. CHRIST IS OUR ROCK
[2:04:08] WHERE WE BASE OURSELVES.
[2:04:12] Praise the name of our Lord. But then to
[2:04:14] the unbelievers,
[2:04:17] it's a crushing stone.
[2:04:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So now in
[2:04:28] this message,
[2:04:30] what was the Holy Ghost given for?
[2:04:33] He says THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY to find it,
[2:04:38] THERE WAS A STONE CUT OUT OF THE
[2:04:40] mountain
[2:04:42] without hands that rolled into the world
[2:04:46] and smashed it out
[2:04:49] and become
[2:04:51] with a chaff
[2:04:55] on the threshing floor.
[2:04:59] Let that stone, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:05:04] that stumbling stone to the world,
[2:05:08] a stone of offense,
[2:05:11] you know, a laughing stone,
[2:05:14] a stumbling stone to the church,
[2:05:18] but a precious
[2:05:20] to the believer,
[2:05:22] stone of assurance,
[2:05:24] stone of rest,
[2:05:27] resting.
[2:05:28] I know that I've passed from death unto
[2:05:31] life.
[2:05:33] Praise the name of our Lord to us. This
[2:05:36] is not a a stone of stumbling.
[2:05:40] Praise the name of our Lord. It is a
[2:05:42] stone. Praise the name OF OUR LORD. SO
[2:05:45] PRECIOUS TO US like the way Peter says
[2:05:48] in second Peter in first Peter chapter
[2:05:50] 2.
[2:05:52] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:05:55] First Peter chapter 2.
[2:05:58] And then if we read from verse 4 to
[2:06:00] verse 8,
[2:06:02] the Bible says,
[2:06:05] "To whom come as a living stone,
[2:06:08] disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of
[2:06:12] God and precious,
[2:06:25] praise the name of our Lord. So to us,
[2:06:29] Christ is a living stone.
[2:06:31] CHRIST IS A PRECIOUS STONE.
[2:06:35] CHRIST IS A CHOSEN STONE.
[2:06:38] Praise the name of our Lord. AND THEN HE
[2:06:40] SAYS, "YOU also
[2:06:43] as lively stones
[2:06:47] are BUILT UP A SPIRITUAL house
[2:06:52] and an holy priesthood
[2:06:55] to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
[2:06:59] acceptable to God
[2:07:02] by Jesus Christ." SO NOW WHEN YOU ARE
[2:07:05] BORN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
[2:07:08] you become a living star.
[2:07:11] You become a lively star. So you become
[2:07:14] a habitation of God.
[2:07:17] When the scripture tells us in Ephesians
[2:07:21] chapter 2
[2:07:23] and then verse 20
[2:07:25] THAT WE ARE BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATION OF
[2:07:28] THE apostles and the prophets,
[2:07:32] Jesus Christ himself.
[2:07:34] being the chief cornerstone.
[2:07:37] Praise the name of our Lord. So he has
[2:07:39] we have been built
[2:07:41] the VERY LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST
[2:07:45] through us. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:07:48] He says we are livelessly stone
[2:07:51] BUILD UP A SPIRITUAL HOUSE
[2:07:54] only priesthood.
[2:07:57] So we are not on guess work.
[2:08:02] Maybe I will be in that kingdom. YOU ARE
[2:08:04] CERTAIN RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE
[2:08:07] kingdom of God already.
[2:08:10] We are looking for its manifestation in
[2:08:12] the physical form
[2:08:15] but in THE SPIRITUAL FORM. WE HAVE THE
[2:08:17] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIR which is the
[2:08:20] kingdom of god. So he says we are
[2:08:23] livelessly stone.
[2:08:26] WE HAVE BUILT A SPIRITUAL HOUSE.
[2:08:29] WE ARE A HOLY PRIESTHOOD.
[2:08:32] WE OFFER UP SPIRITUAL sacrifices
[2:08:35] acceptable to God
[2:08:37] by Jesus Christ. Verse six of second
[2:08:41] chapter 2.
[2:08:44] Wherefore also it is contained in the
[2:08:47] scripture. Behold I lay in Zion a chief
[2:08:51] cornerstone elect precious. And he that
[2:08:55] believeth on him shall not be
[2:08:57] confounded.
[2:09:15] Praise the name of our Lord. He says he
[2:09:17] lays a precious stone there,
[2:09:21] the chief cornerstone.
[2:09:25] And then he says, he that believeth on
[2:09:28] him
[2:09:30] shall not be confounded.
[2:09:33] Unto you therefore which believe,
[2:09:37] he is precious.
[2:09:39] But unto them,
[2:09:42] which be disobedient,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS DISALLOW,
[2:09:50] the same is made the head of the corner
[2:09:56] and a stone of stumbling,
[2:10:00] a rock of offense.
[2:10:04] EVEN TO THEM WHICH STUMBLE AT THE word
[2:10:08] being disobedient
[2:10:11] where unto also they were appointed.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So you can
[2:10:19] see Christ
[2:10:21] the stone. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:10:24] We are not waiting just for him
[2:10:27] to BE THE STONE CUT out of WITHOUT GOD.
[2:10:31] BUT TO US right now, it is the chief
[2:10:34] cornerstone.
[2:10:36] All our faith
[2:10:39] is in the Lord Jesus Christ. And if our
[2:10:41] faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ, THE
[2:10:44] WAY THE BIBLE HAS TOLD US THAT WE ARE
[2:10:47] BUILT UPON THE foundation
[2:10:50] of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus
[2:10:54] being the chief cornerstone.
[2:10:58] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
[2:11:00] ALL OUR TEACHING,
[2:11:03] all our belief
[2:11:06] is based on what is given in the Bible.
[2:11:09] Praise the name of the Lord. The
[2:11:11] apostles,
[2:11:13] they never preached trinity baptism.
[2:11:17] They never preached that. THE APOSTLES
[2:11:21] NEVER PREACHED WOMEN PREACHING.
[2:11:24] They never preached that. THE APOSTLES
[2:11:27] NEVER PREACHED baptizing little
[2:11:29] children.
[2:11:31] SO ALL THOSE THINGS CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS
[2:11:33] TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE.
[2:11:37] They don't have a chief cornerstone as
[2:11:39] Christ.
[2:11:42] Praise the name of our Lord. THE
[2:11:43] APOSTLES NEVER PREACH A trinity of three
[2:11:46] persons in one.
[2:11:49] They preach THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE
[2:11:51] LORD.
[2:11:54] Praise the name of our Lord. WE HAVE
[2:11:56] BUILT ON THAT cornerstone
[2:11:59] Jesus Christ.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our LORD BEING THE
[2:12:03] CHIEF STONE.
[2:12:05] AND NOW YOU NOTICE THAT WHEN THEY WERE
[2:12:06] BUILDING THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON,
[2:12:10] they were getting stones from different
[2:12:12] countries.
[2:12:14] AND THERE WOULD BE VERY BIG stone
[2:12:18] from Arabia,
[2:12:20] from you know Median,
[2:12:23] from Italy, from different countries.
[2:12:28] They were cutting them from the
[2:12:30] mountain.
[2:12:31] THEN THEY WOULD load them on the boats
[2:12:33] and things like that.
[2:12:35] and they would bring them to Jerusalem.
[2:12:38] NOW WHEN THE stones were at Jerusalem,
[2:12:42] nobody cut them there.
[2:12:45] There was no hammer on any stone.
[2:12:49] AND THAT'S HOW GOD PICKS US. He picks us
[2:12:53] from different background.
[2:12:56] Praise the name of the Lord. HE PICKS US
[2:12:58] FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
[2:13:00] Some come from the south. Some come from
[2:13:03] the east.
[2:13:04] Some come from the north, some come from
[2:13:07] THE WEST.
[2:13:09] WHAT IS IT? GOD PICKING his elect all
[2:13:11] over the earth
[2:13:14] and then he brings them together.
[2:13:16] Praise the name of the Lord. He gives
[2:13:18] them his word. He gives them HIS SPIRIT
[2:13:22] AND ALL OF US WE COME TOGETHER AS the
[2:13:25] temple of the living God.
[2:13:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So they
[2:13:29] WERE GETTING THIS STONE.
[2:13:32] PRAISE THE NAME of our Lord. AND EACH
[2:13:34] STONE WAS REPRESENTING a member of the
[2:13:36] body of Christ
[2:13:39] receiving the same Holy Spirit.
[2:13:42] So this stone builds here, another stone
[2:13:45] builds there, another there. That's why
[2:13:49] we cannot do the same thing in the body
[2:13:50] of Jesus.
[2:13:53] One is doing this, another is doing
[2:13:56] this, another is doing this. YOU FIND
[2:13:58] THIS ONE IS good at this. You find this
[2:14:01] one is good at this. Anyone is good at
[2:14:03] this? What are we doing? We are building
[2:14:06] the temple.
[2:14:08] And when we are building the temple, the
[2:14:11] Bible say, let each joint supply.
[2:14:16] So what is your position in the body of
[2:14:18] God?
[2:14:20] Which stone are you?
[2:14:22] Are you the locking stone in a certain
[2:14:24] point?
[2:14:28] receiver.
[2:14:31] You know like this building
[2:14:33] it has different sections
[2:14:36] or different portions of the wall. There
[2:14:39] is a straight wall here
[2:14:41] but then here there is a window there is
[2:14:43] a door. So there are some good stones
[2:14:46] which can look at the door
[2:14:49] others can maybe be down
[2:14:52] up different stones. So what value are
[2:14:56] you to the kingdom of God?
[2:15:00] Praise the name of the Lord. Just coming
[2:15:02] to church to be part of the service is
[2:15:04] not enough.
[2:15:07] Participate.
[2:15:09] Show your relevance in the body of
[2:15:11] Christ.
[2:15:13] Participate in the activities of the
[2:15:14] kingdom.
[2:15:16] Praise the name of our Lord. If you
[2:15:18] can't testify, PRAY FOR THE one who is
[2:15:21] testifying.
[2:15:22] Praise the name of our Lord. If you
[2:15:24] can't go out, support that one who is
[2:15:26] going out.
[2:15:28] If you can't come and help in the work
[2:15:30] activity,
[2:15:32] let me put this there. Praise the name
[2:15:35] of our Lord. If maybe we are having a
[2:15:37] time of washing the
[2:15:40] busy, but you know to wash, we don't
[2:15:44] need only water.
[2:15:48] Water is not for free. Praise the name
[2:15:50] of our Lord. say, "I'm not going to be
[2:15:52] there, but I'm sending some
[2:15:54] contribution.
[2:15:56] Let me put let me pay the water bill
[2:15:58] this month.
[2:16:01] Let me pay the power bill this month.
[2:16:04] Let me pay the the streaming bill this
[2:16:06] month.
[2:16:08] All those are needs,
[2:16:11] but they all work together
[2:16:14] for the good of the body of Jesus.
[2:16:17] Let me contribute this. let me go and
[2:16:20] participate in this. PRAISE THE NAME OF
[2:16:23] LIKE SOME BROTHERS says were going to
[2:16:25] Toro yesterday,
[2:16:27] but then there are others who spend time
[2:16:29] at church yesterday.
[2:16:32] Make this service work out.
[2:16:35] Praise the name of our Lord. We all may
[2:16:36] not be in the same place at the SAME
[2:16:38] TIME
[2:16:40] ALL involved into the kingdom.
[2:16:44] I'm doing this. I'm doing this. I'm also
[2:16:47] going to find out this. Praise the name
[2:16:49] of our Lord. That's how we NEED TO WORK
[2:16:51] AS A BODY.
[2:16:54] Show your activity in the body of God.
[2:16:58] Praise the name of our Lord. It's our
[2:17:00] place.
[2:17:02] So I find rubbish there.
[2:17:05] I'm not just going to to kick it, but
[2:17:08] I'm going to pick it. Put it in the
[2:17:10] right position. Praise the name of the
[2:17:12] Lord. You are showing concern.
[2:17:16] Praise the name of the Lord. You're
[2:17:17] saying this belongs to me.
[2:17:21] This is our place. This is our
[2:17:23] sanctuary.
[2:17:25] So you see, you do everything you can
[2:17:28] to make the place better.
[2:17:31] Praise the name of the Lord. So they
[2:17:33] picked them from different kingdom
[2:17:37] stones.
[2:17:38] But now when it came to the builders,
[2:17:42] [Music]
[2:17:44] most of the builders,
[2:17:47] they were slaves.
[2:17:51] This these builders should we get
[2:17:53] builder here.
[2:17:55] They never had the conviction of the
[2:17:58] temple that they were building.
[2:18:04] So now they get a stone.
[2:18:07] This one looks funny. Let us put this
[2:18:09] aside. So they continue picking one
[2:18:12] another, joining them, joining them.
[2:18:16] Now the chief cornerstone.
[2:18:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Now you see
[2:18:22] that these stones were cut by
[2:18:23] inspiration.
[2:18:27] God would show those those cutters where
[2:18:30] to go.
[2:18:33] Take this dimension. THEY WERE VERY BIG
[2:18:35] STONES.
[2:18:37] bigger than our cars,
[2:18:40] big
[2:18:42] transport them there.
[2:18:44] When they reached there, God had to
[2:18:47] inspire the builders.
[2:18:51] But now here God
[2:18:54] made sure
[2:18:56] that they reject the chief cornerstone
[2:19:02] and they just threw it
[2:19:05] in the rubbish pit. It's looking funny.
[2:19:09] It is not pleasant.
[2:19:13] And that's how the gospel is rejected.
[2:19:16] Why do you waste your TIME IN CHURCH?
[2:19:19] WHY DO YOU WASTE your time praying?
[2:19:22] Why do you waste time this and this?
[2:19:25] Is rejected. It becomes a rock of
[2:19:28] offense.
[2:19:31] It is a stumbling stone. What can I use
[2:19:34] this stone for
[2:19:36] but the Bible say for us who believe
[2:19:40] it is very precious. Praise the name of
[2:19:43] our Lord. And that's how God is building
[2:19:46] his kingdom.
[2:19:49] Praise the name of our Lord. There are
[2:19:50] those who are rejecting.
[2:19:53] There are those who are accepting.
[2:19:56] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[2:19:58] they reached building the temple,
[2:20:01] they rejected the right stone. When they
[2:20:04] reached the end, they found things are
[2:20:07] not matching somewhere.
[2:20:10] When they reached the rubbish pit,
[2:20:13] there was a stone which they must have
[2:20:16] put at the cornerstone.
[2:20:18] And the Bible says it was the Lord's
[2:20:22] doing.
[2:20:24] Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord
[2:20:27] had allowed it to happen.
[2:20:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[2:20:32] to Matthew chapter 21
[2:20:34] and then verse 42.
[2:20:39] The Bible says Jesus said unto them, did
[2:20:42] you never read in the scriptures the
[2:20:45] stone which the builders rejected? The
[2:20:48] same is become the head of the corner.
[2:20:51] This is the Lord is doing and it is
[2:20:53] marvelous in our eyes.
[2:21:13] Therefore, I say unto you, the kingdom
[2:21:16] of God shall be taken from you and given
[2:21:20] to a nation, bringing forth the fruits
[2:21:23] thereof.
[2:21:39] Now he was talking to the Jews
[2:21:42] because they had rejected him. Then he
[2:21:45] says the kingdom of God
[2:21:49] taken from you and given to the
[2:21:52] Gentiles.
[2:21:54] They rejected the kingdom.
[2:21:58] As they rejected stone.
[2:22:01] So he says okay you have rejected it. It
[2:22:04] has become a stone of offense.
[2:22:08] It has become a stumbling stone.
[2:22:12] Let it turn to those people who receive
[2:22:14] it.
[2:22:17] Now we are living in the time. Praise
[2:22:21] the name of the LORD WHERE THE GENTILES
[2:22:23] also
[2:22:25] are rejecting the stone.
[2:22:28] Praise the name of the Lord. We are
[2:22:30] living in a time where the gospel
[2:22:34] is laughed at.
[2:22:36] People don't want IT ANYMORE
[2:22:39] LIKE YOU GO TO TOWN OR YOU START
[2:22:41] TESTIFYING
[2:22:43] OR YOU PREACH THE GOSPEL, NOBODY WANT to
[2:22:46] listen TO YOU. BUT LET SOMEBODY WHO
[2:22:49] COMES WITH SOME trickster
[2:22:55] this one IS CORRECT. THIS ONE
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; ALL THE PEOPLE WILL COLLECT there and
[2:22:58] even block the road.
[2:23:02] They don't want the gospel ANYMORE
[2:23:05] BUT THEY WANT things of deception.
[2:23:09] YOU GO AND START PUTTING THE WORD OF
[2:23:10] GOD.
[2:23:12] PUT THE WORD OF GOD. NOBODY WILL come
[2:23:15] there. If I let a politician come and
[2:23:19] just say a crowd,
[2:23:22] it is now a stone of offense.
[2:23:26] NO MORE WANT NOBODY WANTS TO IDENTIFY
[2:23:29] THEMSELVES.
[2:23:32] They have rejected the stone. So we are
[2:23:35] living in a time WHERE THE GOSPEL IS
[2:23:39] going back to the Jews.
[2:23:42] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[2:23:44] says in verse 44,
[2:23:46] WHATSOEVER SHALL FALL ON this stone
[2:23:48] shall be broken.
[2:23:53] But whomever it shall fall, it will
[2:23:55] grind him to powder.
[2:24:03] Praise the name of our Lord. So this
[2:24:06] time we're living in,
[2:24:08] let Christ be a precious stone to us.
[2:24:13] precious.
[2:24:15] And when you have something precious,
[2:24:18] you think about it. Praise the name of
[2:24:21] our Lord. You care about it.
[2:24:25] Blessed be the name of our Lord because
[2:24:27] it is precious.
[2:24:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[2:24:32] should be our love to God
[2:24:36] him all the time.
[2:24:38] He's so precious to you.
[2:24:40] You desire to be with him. You desire to
[2:24:44] live with him. Praise the name of our
[2:24:46] Lord. You don't only think about him
[2:24:48] only on Sunday.
[2:24:51] You don't think about him when you have
[2:24:52] problems,
[2:24:54] but even in your free time, in your busy
[2:24:57] time,
[2:25:00] praise the name of the Lord. Like I
[2:25:02] believe our brother Adonai
[2:25:05] Adonai whatever time he has
[2:25:08] you know whether he's too busy
[2:25:11] if he sees a call from patience
[2:25:16] he wants to excuse himself on anything
[2:25:20] precious
[2:25:23] praise the name of because there's that
[2:25:26] love
[2:25:28] that desire and that should be our LORD
[2:25:30] JESUS
[2:25:33] YOU'RE NOT TOO BUSY to pray. You're not
[2:25:36] too busy to read your word. You're not
[2:25:38] too busy to hear the word.
[2:25:40] So precious.
[2:25:43] Praise the name of our Lord. You are in
[2:25:45] great expectation.
[2:25:47] If he comes in THE MORNING, YOU'LL FIND
[2:25:50] ME READY. If he comes in the afternoon
[2:25:54] ready come at night, you'll make find me
[2:25:57] ready. AND THAT'S WHERE THE BIBLE PUTS
[2:25:59] IT.
[2:26:01] TWO WERE IN THE field
[2:26:03] working in the morning.
[2:26:05] One was ready. Two were preparing a meal
[2:26:11] day. One was ready. Two were resting at
[2:26:15] night.
[2:26:17] One was ready. Second. That should be
[2:26:20] the way we live our lives.
[2:26:23] You know in that kind of you know
[2:26:24] continuous communion.
[2:26:27] You continuously commune with him.
[2:26:30] Every day is not far from you. You are
[2:26:33] talking with him. You are hearing him
[2:26:36] speaking. You are praising him. You are
[2:26:39] testifying about him. That's how Christ
[2:26:42] should be to us.
[2:26:44] A precious stone, not a stumbling stone.
[2:26:48] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[2:26:50] hear his word, you should rejoice your
[2:26:53] heart.
[2:26:55] It will make you happy and say, "Lord,
[2:26:57] I'm thankful.
[2:26:59] LORD, I'VE HEARD WHAT you've told. IF
[2:27:01] YOU FIND YOU ARE MISSING SOMETHING,
[2:27:04] LORD, HELP ME IN THIS AREA. I WANT TO DO
[2:27:07] BETTER THAN WHAT I've been told.
[2:27:11] That's how you respond.
[2:27:13] Don't say I don't no longer want those
[2:27:15] kind.
[2:27:16] I don't want this kind of this thing is
[2:27:19] just offending me.
[2:27:22] This thing is just putting me down.
[2:27:25] The Bible says, "Praise the name of that
[2:27:29] stone will crush
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; to ashes.
[2:27:35] Nothing.
[2:27:37] But to us who ARE REDEEMED OF THE ROCK,
[2:27:40] it's the rock that we stand upon.
[2:27:44] My faith is built upon the sorrow.
[2:27:48] Praise the name of our Lord. On Christ,
[2:27:51] the solid rock I stand.
[2:27:53] Praise the name of the Lord. All other
[2:27:56] foundation
[2:27:58] sinking sand.
[2:28:02] Why? Because you've got the revelation
[2:28:04] of Jesus Christ.
[2:28:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[2:28:08] to the book of Romans.
[2:28:12] Let us start from the book of Luke
[2:28:13] chapter 21 and then verse 24.
[2:28:20] The Bible says, "And they shall fall by
[2:28:23] the edge of the sword, and shall be led
[2:28:26] away captive into all nations, and
[2:28:30] Jerusalem shall be trodden down in the
[2:28:33] gent of the Gentiles until the times of
[2:28:36] the Gentiles be fulfilled.
[2:28:58] Praise the name of the Lord. Now we are
[2:29:00] living in the times
[2:29:02] where the gentile days are numbered.
[2:29:07] They are being fulfilled.
[2:29:10] And God gave us this season.
[2:29:14] of the seven church ages
[2:29:17] to get a bride
[2:29:20] for his name's sake. And we are living
[2:29:22] in the Ludician church age
[2:29:25] at the end of time
[2:29:28] where the Lord Jesus Christ will come
[2:29:31] and take his bride.
[2:29:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Now as we
[2:29:36] are living at this time
[2:29:39] a junction of time
[2:29:41] there are many things that are
[2:29:43] happening.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now we are
[2:29:48] living in a time where the religions are
[2:29:51] uniting
[2:29:55] and everything
[2:29:57] will have to fulfill the prophecy.
[2:30:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[2:30:03] Revelations 13:1,
[2:30:07] the Bible says,
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Revelations 13 and verse one,
[2:30:13] and I stood upon the sand of sea, and
[2:30:16] saw a beast rise up out of the sea,
[2:30:19] having seven heads and 10 horns, and
[2:30:23] upon his horns 10 crowns, and upon his
[2:30:27] heads the name of Baram.
[2:30:47] And the beast which I saw was like unto
[2:30:50] a leopard, and his feet were as the feet
[2:30:53] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
[2:30:56] a lion. And the dragon gave him his
[2:30:59] power and his seat and great authority.
[2:31:28] Now you see that the Bible says he saw a
[2:31:32] beast rise up out of the sea
[2:31:37] and sea
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; means water
[2:31:42] and water means people.
[2:31:46] Praise the name of our Lord. In
[2:31:48] Revelations
[2:31:50] chapter 17
[2:31:52] and then verse 15, he says, "The waters
[2:31:55] which you saw were where there was
[2:31:58] cities are the peoples and the
[2:32:00] multitudes and nations and tongues.
[2:32:21] And then you see that still in
[2:32:23] Revelation 17:1
[2:32:26] and there came seven angels which had
[2:32:29] the seven vows and talked with me saying
[2:32:32] unto me, come he and I will show you the
[2:32:36] the great judgment.
[2:32:37] of the great war that siteth upon many
[2:32:40] waters.
[2:33:00] That means that there are others who
[2:33:02] come from her
[2:33:05] being a great war.
[2:33:08] The Bible says in verse five, "And upon
[2:33:12] our forehead was a name written,
[2:33:19] Babylon the great,
[2:33:22] the mother of harlots
[2:33:25] and abominations of the earth."
[2:33:29] She's the great one.
[2:33:31] She sits upon many waters.
[2:33:36] She sits upon many people.
[2:33:40] In other words, she's composed of
[2:33:42] people.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; You know, tongues,
[2:33:47] nations,
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; you know, tribes,
[2:33:50] kingdoms. That means that she's all over
[2:33:53] the world.
[2:33:55] It is a religious system
[2:33:59] that opposes God,
[2:34:01] that opposes the word of God.
[2:34:05] this religious system
[2:34:08] is a mother of her lot.
[2:34:11] Other denominations have come out of
[2:34:13] her.
[2:34:15] So she says I'm the mother church.
[2:34:19] So from her proceeds others
[2:34:22] and then the Bible says she's mystery
[2:34:25] Babylon.
[2:34:27] Praise the name of our Lord. NOW WE
[2:34:29] NOTICE here that in the days of
[2:34:32] Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:34:34] he was the king of Babylon.
[2:34:36] And what did Nebuchadnezzar do on
[2:34:38] worship?
[2:34:40] He introduced an image
[2:34:43] to be worshiped.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He
[2:34:48] introduced an image to be worshiped.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says he put the
[2:34:56] image of Daniel
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; because Daniel
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; was given a name of his God.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of OUR LORD. THAT'S WHY
[2:35:09] YOU SEE Daniel
[2:35:11] was not forced to worship it
[2:35:15] but it was his fellows
[2:35:18] Shadrach
[2:35:20] and Abenego who were worship for forced
[2:35:22] to worship
[2:35:24] the image of Daniel.
[2:35:27] SO NOW UNDER BABYLON
[2:35:30] THEY PUT an image of a holy man
[2:35:34] as a worship.
[2:35:37] And even under the great war
[2:35:41] they get THE IMAGES OF HOLY PEOPLE
[2:35:46] WORSHIP.
[2:35:49] You get others the images in the neck
[2:35:54] they worship them.
[2:35:57] Like during these examinations,
[2:36:02] many of these
[2:36:05] students,
[2:36:08] they had those images on their tables
[2:36:10] when they were doing examinations.
[2:36:17] Pray for us
[2:36:21] image
[2:36:23] on the tables when they're doing
[2:36:25] examination.
[2:36:28] Maybe when they forget they look at the
[2:36:29] image
[2:36:31] but the image is dumb.
[2:36:35] It can't walk by itself where
[2:36:39] then you start carrying it on your back.
[2:36:41] You put it on your neck, put it on your
[2:36:43] armor, put it in your sitting, you go
[2:36:46] and give it gifts, it will not take.
[2:36:50] They will even ro from there.
[2:36:53] You give it flowers, they will dry from
[2:36:56] there.
[2:36:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[2:37:01] notice that in the days of Babylon,
[2:37:05] NEBUCHADNEZZAR
[2:37:07] put the image of a holy person
[2:37:10] and they forced them to worship.
[2:37:13] Even now in the end time
[2:37:17] under the relig under the union of
[2:37:20] religions
[2:37:22] you know they are coming together
[2:37:25] to force the world to worship
[2:37:30] not God but something else. And we also
[2:37:34] see that at the beginning of Babel
[2:37:39] praise the name of our Lord there was
[2:37:40] Nimrod the mighty hand.
[2:37:45] He was a mighty hunter before God.
[2:37:49] He was hunting souls of men
[2:37:52] who are failing refusing to worship his
[2:37:54] image.
[2:37:57] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[2:37:59] to this message
[2:38:01] in the pagan church age
[2:38:04] [Music]
[2:38:06] page 187 82
[2:38:10] and then paragraph one.
[2:38:12] Babel is the original for Babylon.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; It means confusion.
[2:38:23] It was literally started by Kosh.
[2:38:28] the son of h
[2:38:30] but was brought to a kingdom of power
[2:38:33] and grandeur under his son
[2:38:38] Nimrod the mighty hunter.
[2:38:43] Nimrod according to Genesis 11
[2:38:47] and also according to history
[2:38:51] he set out to accomplish three things.
[2:38:55] He wanted to build a strong nation.
[2:39:00] He did that. He wanted propagate his own
[2:39:03] religion.
[2:39:06] He did it. He wanted to make a name for
[2:39:09] himself.
[2:39:11] He also accomplished it. His
[2:39:14] accomplishments
[2:39:17] were so monumental that the kingdom of
[2:39:19] Babylon
[2:39:22] was called the head of God.
[2:39:25] among all the world governments.
[2:39:31] that his religion
[2:39:33] gained prominence
[2:39:36] is proven by the fact that the
[2:39:38] scriptures
[2:39:41] that it it that that
[2:39:45] identifies it with Satan
[2:39:50] completely in Isaiah chapter 14
[2:39:53] and in Revelations chapter 17 and 18
[2:39:58] and by history.
[2:40:00] We can prove that it invaded the whole
[2:40:03] world
[2:40:06] and is the basis for every system of
[2:40:08] idolatory
[2:40:15] and the theme of myology.
[2:40:17] [Music]
[2:40:21] Though
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; the names of the gods differ in
[2:40:24] different sections of the land according
[2:40:26] to the language of the people.
[2:40:34] So you see the spirit under the mystery
[2:40:37] Babylon and then it comes to the the
[2:40:41] time of Nebuchadnezzar
[2:40:43] and then we track it in the time of
[2:40:45] Nimrod.
[2:40:47] Nimrod was the first person
[2:40:50] to make people start worshiping another
[2:40:52] god.
[2:40:55] Cain
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; was worshiping the same God with Abbe
[2:41:00] but now Nimrod
[2:41:02] with his religion
[2:41:05] his own establishment.
[2:41:07] So you see that Babylon
[2:41:10] Babel confusion
[2:41:13] then he comes to Babylon the times of
[2:41:14] Nebuchadnezzar
[2:41:18] under mystery Babylon.
[2:41:23] It is a religious system
[2:41:26] and has to bring the world together
[2:41:30] to worship the beast.
[2:41:32] That's what the Bible say.
[2:41:35] Worship the beast. AND NOW THE BIBLE IS
[2:41:38] TELLING US in Revelations 17 that this
[2:41:43] great war
[2:41:45] she sits on a scarlet colored beast.
[2:41:53] And the BEAST ACCORDING TO THE Bible
[2:41:57] in Revelations 13 and verse 18
[2:42:02] here is wisdom.
[2:42:05] Let him that has understanding count the
[2:42:08] number of the beast.
[2:42:12] For it is the number of a man.
[2:42:16] The beast is a man.
[2:42:19] Praise the name of Allah. The beast THAT
[2:42:23] BROUGHT THE FALL IN THE GARDEN OF Eden
[2:42:27] was a serpent.
[2:42:30] But now, praise the name OF OUR LORD.
[2:42:33] THE SERPENT IS seen
[2:42:37] beings.
[2:42:39] So the beast
[2:42:42] that CAUSES THE FALL OF THE WHOLE world
[2:42:46] is a man, religious man.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now in 2
[2:42:53] Thessalonians
[2:42:55] chapter 2.
[2:42:58] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[2:43:01] says
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; in verse three,
[2:43:05] "Let no man deceive you by any means,
[2:43:09] for that they shall not come except
[2:43:11] there be a falling away fast and the man
[2:43:14] of sin be revealed, the son of pition.
[2:43:38] who opposes and exalts himself above all
[2:43:42] that is called God, all that is
[2:43:44] worshiped, so that he as God sits in the
[2:43:47] temple of God, showing himself that he
[2:43:51] is God.
[2:44:09] He says he's a man of sin.
[2:44:13] So the beast is a man
[2:44:16] and that beast
[2:44:18] leads a religious system.
[2:44:23] The great war
[2:44:26] sits on that beast
[2:44:28] and then the beast moves here, moves
[2:44:30] here, moves here and then the moves
[2:44:34] and the war also sits among many people
[2:44:38] and then they all go where the beast
[2:44:39] tells them to go.
[2:44:42] Praise the name of our Lord. Now at this
[2:44:44] end time,
[2:44:46] the Bible says that this beast,
[2:44:52] let us go back. Revelations 13:2.
[2:44:58] And the beast which I saw was like unto
[2:45:00] a leopard,
[2:45:03] and his feet were as a bear, and his
[2:45:05] mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the
[2:45:07] dragon gave him his power and his seat
[2:45:11] and great authority.
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; Verse two, two
[2:45:41] Now this dragon
[2:45:45] in Revelations 12
[2:45:48] and verse 9
[2:45:50] and the great dragon was cast out that
[2:45:53] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[2:45:57] which deceives the whole world. He was
[2:45:59] cast out into the earth and his angels
[2:46:01] were cast out with him.
[2:46:18] So the Bible told us that the great the
[2:46:22] dragon
[2:46:24] Satan
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; gave this beast
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; his seat.
[2:46:33] great authority
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; and great power.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So the the
[2:46:40] beast,
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; you know, was Satan incarnate,
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; Satan was in this beast,
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; the way Satan was in the serpent.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; So now Satan gets into this beast.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; The way Satan ENTERED JUDAS'S CAROTION,
[2:47:04] LIKE LAST TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SATAN
[2:47:06] entered Judas.
[2:47:09] Now at this end time, Satan enters a
[2:47:12] religious man
[2:47:15] and causes the whole world
[2:47:18] to WORSHIP HIM. HE CALLS HIMSELF holy
[2:47:22] father.
[2:47:24] But in THE SCRIPTURES,
[2:47:26] THERE IS NOBODY WHO WAS CALLED A HOLY
[2:47:28] father
[2:47:30] other than God Almighty.
[2:47:32] In John chapter 17,
[2:47:36] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; In John chapter 17
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; and then verse 11.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; And now I am no more in the world, but
[2:47:47] these are in the world. And I come unto
[2:47:51] thee, holy father, keep through thy own
[2:47:54] name those whom you have given me, that
[2:47:57] they may be one as we are. John 17:11
[2:48:20] Praise the name of our Lord. A title
[2:48:23] that belongs to God.
[2:48:27] Now the man says I'm the one.
[2:48:30] Then says he sits in the temple of God.
[2:48:36] I am God.
[2:48:39] Worship me. I'm the holy father.
[2:48:44] Now the Bible says Satan
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; gives him his power,
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; his seat
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; and great authority.
[2:48:56] Now you SEE THAT IN ISAIAH CHAPTER 14,
[2:49:00] Satan wanted to be worshiped.
[2:49:04] So he finally fulfills it
[2:49:07] at the end time
[2:49:10] where the world worships him as God.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Because the
[2:49:15] Bible says
[2:49:17] if you don't worship him,
[2:49:21] you are going to be killed.
[2:49:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[2:49:28] continue in Revelations chapter 13.
[2:49:34] Revelations chapter 13
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; and then we read
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; verse four
[2:49:46] and they worshiped the dragon which gave
[2:49:49] power
[2:49:50] unto the beast and they worshiped the
[2:49:53] beast saying who is like unto the beast
[2:49:57] who is able to make war with him.
[2:50:15] verse eight.
[2:50:19] And all that dwell upon the earth shall
[2:50:22] worship him whose names are not written
[2:50:25] in the lamb's book of life slain from
[2:50:27] the foundation of the world.
[2:50:42] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we are
[2:50:45] living in a time where the Bible says
[2:50:49] another beast came up out of the earth.
[2:50:53] Verse 11.
[2:50:56] And I beheld another beast coming out of
[2:50:58] the earth, and he had two horns
[2:51:01] like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.
[2:51:15] [Music]
[2:51:20] Now, brother Brandham teaches us that
[2:51:23] this beast that came out of the earth
[2:51:27] which had two horns
[2:51:29] like a lamb
[2:51:31] that is religious power
[2:51:34] and then and then another one
[2:51:39] praise the name of our Lord speaking
[2:51:41] like a dragon.
[2:51:44] So it had this religious power,
[2:51:49] civil power,
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; the USA.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; So now it causes the world
[2:51:59] to make a union of religions
[2:52:03] and the union of religions
[2:52:06] becomes the image of the beast.
[2:52:09] AND THEN THE BIBLE SAYS, "Whosoever
[2:52:14] does not worship the image of the beast
[2:52:17] shall be killed in verse 15."
[2:52:28] Verse 15.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; 13:14.
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; 13:15.
[2:52:48] [Music]
[2:52:53] And he causes all both great, small,
[2:52:57] rich, poor, free, bonded to receive a
[2:53:00] mark in their right hand or in their
[2:53:03] forehead.
[2:53:20] that no man might buy or sell. Save he
[2:53:23] that has the mark or the name of the
[2:53:26] beast or the number of his name.
[2:53:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the the
[2:53:44] mark
[2:53:46] in the forehead
[2:53:49] is your believing what they teach.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; Believe in the trinity.
[2:53:59] You already have the forehead mark.
[2:54:02] They are teaching. You may not be
[2:54:04] collecting with them.
[2:54:10] But you believe
[2:54:14] the mark is there
[2:54:16] in the right hand
[2:54:19] fellowship.
[2:54:22] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:54:28] You know we have taken long without
[2:54:29] having overnight. We have them every
[2:54:31] day.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have them.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; We don't have even lunch hour.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; Let me go there and have lunch hour.
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; Right hand.
[2:54:43] You accept your fellowship.
[2:54:47] You know, you you link up with them.
[2:54:51] So you get the mark.
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now you
[2:54:57] will see that all the kingdoms which
[2:54:59] were there
[2:55:03] Babylonian kingdom
[2:55:06] then the Persian kingdom
[2:55:10] and the Greek kingdom
[2:55:13] all their attributes
[2:55:16] they wind up in the Roman Empire.
[2:55:22] Praise the name of the Lord. All those
[2:55:24] things
[2:55:25] whatever they were doing, they wind up
[2:55:28] here.
[2:55:30] And then the Bible says in Revelations
[2:55:33] 13:2
[2:55:35] that this beast I saw
[2:55:39] was like a low party.
[2:55:42] And when you go in the scriptures here
[2:55:46] Daniel chapter 7,
[2:55:50] you'll find Daniel chapter 7 describes
[2:55:53] the four gentile kingdoms.
[2:56:00] You see THAT THE SPIRITS COME FROM there
[2:56:04] and then they wind up in the in the
[2:56:06] beast
[2:56:09] of the end time.
[2:56:12] So you see that in Daniel
[2:56:15] 7 verse 6
[2:56:18] I beheld and another beast like a
[2:56:21] leopard.
[2:56:27] which was the Greek kingdom.
[2:56:31] So the spirits wind up here.
[2:56:34] And then he says his feet
[2:56:38] just now interpret as I read
[2:56:41] where as the feet of the bear.
[2:56:45] [Music]
[2:56:46] So now you go to Daniel chapter 7
[2:56:50] verse 5. He says another beast,
[2:56:54] the second one like a bear.
[2:56:58] So the spirits which were in the med
[2:57:01] persian kingdom
[2:57:03] they end up here with this.
[2:57:06] [Music]
[2:57:08] Then he says and his mouth as a mouth of
[2:57:12] a lion.
[2:57:15] You go back to Daniel chapter 7
[2:57:18] verse 4. The first beast was like a
[2:57:22] lion.
[2:57:24] So all those spirits
[2:57:27] they wind up here at the end time.
[2:57:31] And then when the Lord Jesus comes and
[2:57:34] the stone cut without hands
[2:57:38] might the image
[2:57:40] all its components are destroyed.
[2:57:44] Praise the name of we are living at the
[2:57:47] time of the coming of the Lord Jesus.
[2:57:50] So we need to see that we prepare
[2:57:52] ourselves.
[2:57:54] Praise the name of our Lord. You see
[2:57:56] what's happening already in the world.
[2:57:58] Praise the name of our Lord. The union
[2:58:00] of religion.
[2:58:02] You know the chaos in Middle East and
[2:58:05] all the things that are taking PLACE
[2:58:08] THEY ARE SHOWING us time is no longer.
[2:58:12] Praise the name of our Lord. This is the
[2:58:14] time we need to see that we prepare for
[2:58:16] the change of our body.
[2:58:19] It's the time YOU NEED TO CHECK your
[2:58:21] your vessel
[2:58:24] oil. Praise the name of our Lord. And if
[2:58:27] you really HAVE OIL, YOUR LOVE SHOULD BE
[2:58:29] BURNING.
[2:58:33] The life of Christ
[2:58:35] should BE MANIFESTED.
[2:58:37] THAT'S THE LIGHT OF the world.
[2:58:40] In the darkness at places of
[2:58:43] show them a true Christian. Praise the
[2:58:45] name of our Lord. In the community where
[2:58:47] you live, you show them I'm a TRUE
[2:58:50] CHRISTIAN. SO YOUR LAMP is shining.
[2:58:55] And when we come to church here, we have
[2:58:57] come for a refilling.
[2:58:59] Praise the name of our Lord. We've come
[2:59:01] to refill OUR LOVE.
[2:59:04] LORD, FILL me more. Let my cup run over.
[2:59:09] Praise the name of our Lord. So you OPEN
[2:59:11] UP ALL YOUR HEART.
[2:59:13] FILL ME LORD.
[2:59:16] PRAISE THE NAME OF LORD. EVERY PART IN
[2:59:18] ME FEEL IT.
[2:59:20] MY MIND IS ON CHRIST. MY WORDS ARE
[2:59:23] TALKING about Christ. My walk is about
[2:59:26] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:59:29] Filled with the Holy Spirit. SO TO US,
[2:59:33] PRAISE the name of our Lord. He is a
[2:59:35] precious stone.
[2:59:38] Praise the name of our Lord to the
[2:59:39] kingdoms of the world. HAVING AS A STONE
[2:59:43] CUT OUT OF WITHOUT earth to destroy all
[2:59:46] the gentile kingdom.
[2:59:49] Praise the name of our Lord. We are
[2:59:51] living at the time where we need to see
[2:59:53] the change of our body.
[2:59:56] Praise the name of our Lord. See that
[2:59:58] you take it serious.
[3:00:00] Have a personal relationship with God.
[3:00:04] Let him be precious to you. Worshiping
[3:00:07] him all the time. Living a life that is
[3:00:10] holy.
[3:00:12] at your place of work. Don't put it off
[3:00:15] at your home. See that you live a life
[3:00:18] that is worthy of the gospel.
[3:00:21] Praise the name of our Lord. What a day
[3:00:23] that we are living.
[3:00:25] Praise the name of our Lord. All these
[3:00:27] things are being fulfilled before.
[3:00:30] Blessed be the name of our Lord. So you
[3:00:32] need to see that you are filled with the
[3:00:34] oil.
[3:00:35] And it's not difficult. The oil is
[3:00:38] already here.
[3:00:40] Praise the name of our Lord. You just
[3:00:41] keep on receiving more. Lord, fill me.
[3:00:45] Lord, change me. Lord, transform me.
[3:00:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Let Christ
[3:00:50] be a precious stone to
[3:00:53] not wait to be a crushing stone.
[3:00:58] Let him be a stone,
[3:01:00] precious,
[3:01:02] adored,
[3:01:04] lovely.
[3:01:06] Praise the name of our Lord. and you've
[3:01:07] become also a living stone
[3:01:11] building the temple of God.
[3:01:14] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[3:01:16] bless you.
[3:01:18] Amen. Amen.
[3:01:21] Let us sing that song. Nations are
[3:01:24] breaking as the song leader comes.
[3:01:28] Praise the name of our Lord. The day of
[3:01:30] redemption is near.
[3:01:34] Praise the name of our Lord.
[3:01:37] The day of redemption is here.
[3:01:42] [Music]
[3:01:44] Men's heart
[3:01:46] are failing
[3:01:48] for fear.
[3:01:51] Be filmed
[3:01:58] and clear.
[3:02:02] Look,
[3:02:04] your redemption
[3:02:06] is here.
[3:02:11] Nations are breaking.
[3:02:14] Israel are awake.
[3:02:18] A sign that the prophets for to
[3:02:24] [Music]
[3:02:26] the gentile
[3:02:29] number with sorrows
[3:02:33] uncomfort.
