[46:40] mercy will
[46:42] follow my life and I'll dwell in the
[46:46] house of the Lord forever. What a
[46:47] beautiful song.
[46:50] So um in the interest of time
[46:54] I want to believe that 95% of us have
[47:01] uh I will request that we get to our
[47:06] speeches and uh I would like to humbly
[47:12] request that uh like I mentioned
[47:16] before everybody
[47:19] here means a lot to the
[47:24] pastor and has had quite a wonderful
[47:27] relationship if I could say with
[47:33] him and I'm sure that would be wonderful
[47:36] to listen to each and everyone here
[47:42] speak but you'll agree with
[47:46] me that that may not be
[47:49] possible to listen to
[47:51] everybody yet. It will be
[47:54] wonderful. So, we'll just have a few
[47:59] representatives who will be speaking on
[48:02] behalf of others.
[48:07] Yes. To speak to us.
[48:10] So, in the morning there were two uh uh
[48:13] speeches we didn't listen to.
[48:19] I would want to start
[48:21] there. Let me invite our dear precious
[48:24] brother Fred
[48:30] MB to come and make his remarks
[48:36] also and after
[48:39] him brother Alex will be following.
[48:46] the following. So, Brother Fred, you're
[48:50] welcome. You can play some music as
[48:52] Brother Fred
[48:57] comes. Welcome
[49:21] Thank you my
[49:25] brother for this
[49:29] opportunity to allow
[49:36] usimony that we can
[49:40] over our
[49:44] pastor who has pastored us for these 40
[49:48] years.
[49:53] My name is Frederick.
[49:59] Um, I came to know the message
[50:04] through my brother Steven
[50:12] when he brought to my house
[50:22] and
[50:23] uh, Brother
[50:26] Beno started on
[50:30] [Music]
[50:34] me
[50:38] shortly. I got some message
[50:42] books and
[50:44] uh
[50:46] notably the one thing that I really
[50:51] cherished was the Lord God had spoken.
[51:00] It brought out the godhead
[51:05] and a few
[51:07] other
[51:10] doctrinal message principles.
[51:17] Just to draw a little bit
[51:22] back. Brother is my uncle.
[51:33] But what is even more
[51:41] interesting? He's a brother.
[51:44] [Music]
[51:46] He's a brother. He's a brother of my
[51:49] stepmother.
[51:53] He's a brother of my stepmother.
[52:01] So in such circumstances there is a
[52:03] reason why I'm trying to pull out
[52:05] [Music]
[52:08] this that in such situations it will not
[52:11] be very easy for me to work closely with
[52:13] brother.
[52:19] But here's a
[52:21] guy who picked me from a bar,
[52:26] brought me to the
[52:29] message, taught me the
[52:32] godhead and whatever I know in the
[52:35] message, I believe I've learned it
[52:36] through his ministry.
[52:43] It was not only
[52:46] that but accepting to work with
[52:53] me to the extent
[52:56] that if it was something
[53:02] political I would be a
[53:05] PA assistant.
[53:15] That is the quality of man that we are
[53:17] talking
[53:22] about.
[53:23] [Music]
[53:24] Um during my secular
[53:31] service I worked with uh a farm of
[53:35] advocates
[53:44] Okay. And
[53:46] uh by
[53:48] training I handle
[53:56] figures. So when we came
[53:59] together a lot of those things fell on
[54:02] my laps.
[54:07] the registration of the churches, the
[54:10] filing of
[54:12] returns, preparation of audit
[54:18] reports. You can see the
[54:25] epics.
[54:27] Um, I'll draw a little bit
[54:32] back to fill in gaps.
[54:38] in my brethren that spoke in the
[54:43] morning. Uh this church started at
[54:49] school and it had three
[54:55] members, the
[54:58] pastor and two believers. Those that
[55:02] were here in the morning, you know who
[55:03] those people were
[55:08] from school, which was the pastor's
[55:15] house. This church went to a nursery
[55:22] school which was at Search Road. Brother
[55:24] Emma told us that
[55:27] already and that was next to
[55:31] uh the regional police
[55:39] office. They didn't stay
[55:43] long. Uh they had to relocate
[55:47] again. And this time the church went
[55:50] into brother's
[55:56] place. From there it went to another
[55:58] nursery school.
[56:04] before it got to ginger girls, I
[56:07] [Music]
[56:09] believe girls when they were chased out
[56:12] of ginger girls because at ginger girls
[56:14] I peed in once and ran
[56:23] back. Um they went back to brother's
[56:27] place.
[56:30] from where they went west primary school
[56:35] and that is
[56:36] when I seriously came
[56:42] in and since that
[56:45] time he has given me the
[56:49] opportunity to work in the Lord's
[56:56] vine. Um, I would like to say this.
[57:01] When we identified this plot, plot
[57:05] number
[57:09] one, we didn't have
[57:12] money. And my pastor was very
[57:17] shy about money
[57:20] issues. How he got the money that we
[57:23] paid for the plot.
[57:27] None of us
[57:30] and none of us can put our hand up and
[57:32] say he
[57:37] contributed. But he's doing all
[57:40] this and is staying
[57:43] in a humble
[57:48] house. He was in his first house which
[57:51] he constructed in
[57:53] [Music]
[57:55] An unfaithful
[57:58] person would not have been
[58:01] able to get all those
[58:05] resources and give them to the
[58:08] community. Possibly would have thought
[58:10] of himself first.
[58:17] Um we worked hand in hand
[58:21] in the construction of this
[58:25] building and even
[58:27] then I believe that none of us
[58:30] contributed a
[58:36] brick. The first contribution that he
[58:40] told us to
[58:41] [Music]
[58:45] make was after the first benches.
[58:51] After even the first benches were not
[58:54] bought by us.
[58:58] But the current benches are the ones
[58:59] that he told us let each
[59:04] family
[59:06] contribute in the
[59:11] church. This is the
[59:13] quality of
[59:15] man that has been in the
[59:18] ministry and that we are all proud of.
[59:24] uh I would like to
[59:30] that our pastor is
[59:34] blessed. The words is
[59:38] here from all of
[59:41] us in most cases are spoken at a
[59:47] funeral. But he's blessed that we've
[59:49] spoken them in his hearing.
[59:54] Pastor, we appreciate
[59:58] you.
[1:00:00] Um, pastor,
[1:00:04] you taught me
[1:00:09] holistically, you picked me from the
[1:00:14] bedroom, you brought me to the sitting
[1:00:16] room,
[1:00:18] and you put me out to the public.
[1:00:24] And
[1:00:26] uh I would like to attest this
[1:00:33] but because of what you had put in
[1:00:37] me. I've laid down two jobs.
[1:00:42] I've refused two
[1:00:45] jobs because they had identified me to
[1:00:48] be the chairman of the public service
[1:00:53] commission service commission in
[1:01:04] Camry. The second one after I had
[1:01:06] refused that one after about 3 years
[1:01:08] they came back to me.
[1:01:13] And this time they wanted me to chair
[1:01:15] the district water board
[1:01:22] in. But knowing what goes on in those
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:30] offices and the integrity that we have
[1:01:33] held,
[1:01:36] I thought it was not worth it.
[1:01:48] Um because of that integrity
[1:01:54] somebody said in the
[1:01:57] morning pastor being offered quite
[1:02:01] handsome money loans and
[1:02:08] things. But we can even put that
[1:02:12] aside and let me say this
[1:02:15] also. Pastor right from president's
[1:02:21] office. They was sought
[1:02:24] out and they saw nobody in
[1:02:29] Ginger for the position of a
[1:02:33] mayor. He turned it down.
[1:02:37] I was turning down these jobs because I
[1:02:39] saw you turned down that
[1:02:47] job. Oh, like I was saying,
[1:02:53] He has taught us
[1:02:56] or he has taught me
[1:03:00] to be a father,
[1:03:03] to be a husband,
[1:03:06] to be a person that serves the public.
[1:03:12] There are many things that I learned
[1:03:15] from
[1:03:19] pastoral not because he
[1:03:22] had spoken them in the
[1:03:27] pulpit but by watching the way that he
[1:03:33] lives. I don't know if he remembers
[1:03:36] this.
[1:03:38] One
[1:03:40] time we were going back to his home
[1:03:44] in it was around 10
[1:03:50] p.m. So we get to the gate.
[1:03:55] And he tells me, Fred, you know
[1:03:59] what? I forgot to buy
[1:04:02] tomatoes. Sent me for
[1:04:07] tomatoes. So to me, I was like, we can
[1:04:10] buy the tomatoes tomorrow.
[1:04:17] He told me no
[1:04:18] friend I was sent to buy
[1:04:23] tomatoes. So we
[1:04:27] turned and went back
[1:04:31] to in the
[1:04:34] center and we bought the tomatoes.
[1:04:39] What kind of humility?
[1:04:44] So as he was doing that I was learning
[1:04:47] something.
[1:04:52] It is
[1:04:53] not always chest
[1:04:56] thumping. I am the man. I am the
[1:05:04] this. He has taught me to
[1:05:08] learn. And those of us who have cared to
[1:05:13] learn that a home does not belong to a
[1:05:19] man. A home belongs to a
[1:05:23] woman. She's the
[1:05:27] queen. That's her
[1:05:31] kingdom. There's no other place where
[1:05:33] she can exercise that authority.
[1:05:40] But in that
[1:05:42] place as I conclude,
[1:05:46] I would like also to bring this
[1:05:50] out that uh many
[1:05:55] times
[1:05:56] when I walked close to
[1:06:03] ministers, I always thought, God, why?
[1:06:11] Because these are human beings like us.
[1:06:16] But the word says three chits
[1:06:20] away from the
[1:06:28] ark. Uh and I believe the reason why the
[1:06:31] God said
[1:06:34] that that you may not see the back parts
[1:06:37] of the
[1:06:40] ministers which would cause you maybe to
[1:06:48] disrespect. I'm not in any
[1:07:00] uh because in my
[1:07:03] walking this Christian life I've walked
[1:07:06] with
[1:07:09] ministers. I have served ministers
[1:07:19] and it's not easy.
[1:07:22] But I appreciate,
[1:07:25] the man that was before me,
[1:07:28] the man that I looked
[1:07:31] to that made it very easy for the people
[1:07:34] that were around him
[1:07:41] in the
[1:07:46] vineyard. This to the young
[1:07:49] people whenever you get an
[1:07:53] opportunity to walk close to a God
[1:07:56] called
[1:08:00] man. I assure
[1:08:02] you
[1:08:04] you will reap the blessings.
[1:08:10] That
[1:08:10] one is a testimony
[1:08:14] that is in the local Christian
[1:08:17] assembly ministries known
[1:08:22] today. All the people that have walked
[1:08:25] around
[1:08:29] brother have stable homes.
[1:08:34] they have children that can be brought
[1:08:36] out and shown to the
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:41] people. So I would encourage
[1:08:48] everybody that if you have an
[1:08:50] opportunity to
[1:08:52] serve, serve with all that is in
[1:08:58] you. I also want to say what the pastor
[1:09:01] has already said.
[1:09:06] That pastor was
[1:09:11] hired by the Almighty God.
[1:09:17] And the only person that can fire
[1:09:23] him, Almighty
[1:09:25] God. Why am I saying
[1:09:28] this? That he is retiring.
[1:09:34] but he's not
[1:09:36] tired and I believe he'll continue
[1:09:38] leading us.
[1:09:41] God bless you, our
[1:09:43] pastor. We respect
[1:09:46] you. God bless you,
[1:09:49] mama. You've kept the church
[1:09:52] together. God bless my
[1:09:59] cousins. You've been an example to this
[1:10:01] church.
[1:10:04] We appreciate you brother James.
[1:10:08] We appreciate mama.
[1:10:11] We love you.
[1:10:13] We shall hold your hands.
[1:10:17] God bless you my
[1:10:23] brethren. Thank you very very much dear
[1:10:27] brother Fred.
[1:10:30] Wonderful
[1:10:33] words. Without wasting time, let me call
[1:10:36] brother
[1:10:38] Alexand Alex. Brother
[1:10:41] Alexand
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:57] Alex. Yes, please do listen.
[1:11:00] to this lovely
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:10] testimony. God bless
[1:11:23] you,
[1:11:27] sister.
[1:11:32] and all the
[1:11:36] ministers greet you in the name of our
[1:11:38] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:41] I was discussing with the brother behind
[1:11:46] there that you are in this place right
[1:11:50] now. You see it is something which is
[1:11:55] sudden and the time will come when we
[1:11:58] shall cross and be on the other
[1:12:03] side with the
[1:12:05] saints. So when I look at something like
[1:12:08] this
[1:12:09] one I keep on
[1:12:13] meditating that how is it going to be on
[1:12:16] the other side.
[1:12:19] God bless you very
[1:12:21] much. I thank the Lord that I'm standing
[1:12:23] before
[1:12:29] my
[1:12:32] pastor. Pastor
[1:12:35] Steven used to be
[1:12:40] photographers. He was a small
[1:12:43] man and I was also a small
[1:12:46] man but used to to to interact to
[1:12:53] chat. So one time we met him it was a
[1:12:56] Sunday
[1:12:58] morning he was going to church to
[1:13:00] minister I think it
[1:13:02] was in his place I think around in place
[1:13:05] or I don't know it's because ginger
[1:13:07] girls that had not started
[1:13:14] He told me, he told me go to
[1:13:16] church. You see, I had my camera was
[1:13:19] going to
[1:13:21] photograph. I told him no. He said, "You
[1:13:26] come to
[1:13:27] church and just walked
[1:13:30] away. I think there was something in
[1:13:32] me."
[1:13:36] So I thank the
[1:13:37] Lord that since
[1:13:42] 1987 he has been my
[1:13:48] pastor and he actually has really been a
[1:13:52] blessing to
[1:13:55] me because it helped me to bring all my
[1:13:58] children the fear of
[1:14:02] God. Praise the Lord. I'm a pastor in my
[1:14:07] home. Don't play with my
[1:14:10] home and no child can play with me when
[1:14:13] I'm really handling
[1:14:20] them very
[1:14:23] greatly to bring them in the fear of the
[1:14:26] Lord.
[1:14:29] So been a real blessing to to me and my
[1:14:32] family.
[1:14:36] And there was a certain sect I was in
[1:14:38] when I was a
[1:14:44] Pentecostal. And uh you see there was a
[1:14:48] problem which we we
[1:14:51] got for his elect when he wants to pull
[1:14:54] him from a certain
[1:14:59] confusion can create a certain
[1:15:03] environment and you vomited
[1:15:06] out. So, so
[1:15:09] uh when when you had that confusion the
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:17] sect certain brother you know divorced
[1:15:20] his
[1:15:23] wife and then he went back to church of
[1:15:28] Uganda. I was really hurt.
[1:15:31] I was very much hurt and then the sex
[1:15:34] were in it was not a very sexy.
[1:15:38] So brother, my precious
[1:15:45] brother, we were in the
[1:15:50] same when he saw that thing was really
[1:15:52] declining, you know, breaking
[1:15:58] away started, you know, going to
[1:16:02] pastoral church.
[1:16:07] I told about that
[1:16:28] problemat even we start with
[1:16:33] brother
[1:16:34] things and then We are 14
[1:16:40] girls and I also started going
[1:16:44] there with my small
[1:16:48] family. So from as I told you from
[1:16:53] 1987 but I got saved
[1:16:58] 1977 but I was in that
[1:17:01] group. So when I sat
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:08] under
[1:17:10] blessed, I was really
[1:17:13] blessed really, you know, got hold of me
[1:17:17] and taught me
[1:17:19] and I was really lifted
[1:17:21] up. So I really give him
[1:17:25] respect and honor.
[1:17:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:30] And when he appointed us deacons,
[1:17:36] we the first deacons in ginger
[1:17:41] church actually really loved
[1:17:44] me. He used to send me to places to
[1:17:47] preach.
[1:17:50] I remember he sent me
[1:17:54] to
[1:17:59] church and he would send me to other
[1:18:01] places. One time he sent me to
[1:18:06] church I feared I said that's a very big
[1:18:11] church and then sickness actually caught
[1:18:14] hold of me.
[1:18:16] I was to go but because of the sickness
[1:18:18] I couldn't
[1:18:21] go after they would send me to other
[1:18:25] places to
[1:18:27] preach like I
[1:18:29] [Music]
[1:18:31] remember and you
[1:18:34] know certain certain
[1:18:38] places and one time I went with with him
[1:18:41] to to
[1:18:43] to Rwanda Chigari
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:48] twice. Praise the
[1:18:52] Lord. Let us go
[1:18:56] to and went and we had to go with
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:03] brother but he had some
[1:19:05] problems. So we drove all that
[1:19:09] night and we slept early in the morning.
[1:19:15] But
[1:19:21] certain shall we pass in that place was
[1:19:23] full of wrong
[1:19:27] people. But then he said just pray.
[1:19:31] So around around 6 or before 6 we drove
[1:19:39] off
[1:19:50] to Praise the Lord.
[1:19:54] So loved me so
[1:19:57] much and I believe he's still loving me.
[1:20:02] Praise the Lord. Because even recently
[1:20:04] my wife talks about talked about them
[1:20:06] coming to my home with to our home with
[1:20:09] his with the
[1:20:16] sister. And when I told him this
[1:20:18] morning, he said, "Yeah, you tell us
[1:20:20] when we shall come.
[1:20:30] I don't know where I would be. I would
[1:20:32] be
[1:20:33] finished. Maybe I will not even be
[1:20:36] existing in this
[1:20:38] world. So, praise the Lord. God bless
[1:20:40] you very
[1:20:43] much and sa
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:21:01] since he started the
[1:21:03] ministry you sit under his
[1:21:06] ministry you get when you're really
[1:21:08] blessed.
[1:21:10] So I thank him as the pastor was
[1:21:14] saying that actually is just continues
[1:21:16] that

[1:26:56] team which has led which has held your

[1:27:09] here. Um, brother
[1:27:13] God coming here all the way from across
[1:27:17] the
[1:27:20] bridge. I greet you all in the name of
[1:27:24] the Lord Jesus
[1:27:27] Christ and I want to appreciate God for
[1:27:30] this
[1:27:32] day for he has made
[1:27:35] it. I have lived under the ministry of
[1:27:40] my
[1:27:43] brother senior
[1:27:46] pastor and our
[1:27:51] brother I would
[1:27:53] say if there's a place I can rejoice
[1:27:59] in
[1:28:00] here if there is a
[1:28:03] ceremony if I can feel free to be There
[1:28:06] it is.
[1:28:10] Here. This is the place you can see the
[1:28:16] cleaniness and I know God is
[1:28:20] here. So I will not say much because my
[1:28:25] ear brothers have said it all.
[1:28:31] But I'm
[1:28:32] glad to see a soldier of the
[1:28:38] cross with
[1:28:42] scars because he has been on front line
[1:28:45] many
[1:28:51] times before
[1:28:54] me. It's a great
[1:28:57] joy and I commend him to the Lord.
[1:29:02] Who has lifted him to that
[1:29:05] far in such a way that whoever has come
[1:29:08] under his ministry has
[1:29:12] benefited unless you came and shut your
[1:29:19] heartel but
[1:29:21] otherwise may God bless him
[1:29:25] and may God bless our pastor JK
[1:29:31] Whenever we listen to the message he
[1:29:35] preaches, we

[1:30:20] many things to say about them. some good
[1:30:26] things because there are many things
[1:30:28] I've seen
[1:30:30] here which are which have been done in a
[1:30:32] perfect
[1:30:35] way. I shall bless every brother
[1:30:38] here. I shall bless every sister
[1:30:43] and I shall bless every
[1:30:45] minister who is under the voice of God
[1:30:48] for this
[1:30:50] day for the great work.

[1:30:57] prayer that the the work of God may go
[1:31:02] forward. I bless you
[1:31:04] all. I'm grateful to witness this day.
[1:31:10] for the glory of his holy
[1:31:12] name. God bless
[1:31:17] you. I am brother
[1:31:20] Julius who has been a deacon with the
[1:31:24] brother
[1:31:28] Steven have been very close to
[1:31:32] him. But as the brother
[1:31:36] spoke, we have been brought up on the
[1:31:41] epidm to know who called
[1:31:46] you, not to work under influence of
[1:31:52] ministers and look up to
[1:31:56] God when
[1:31:58] brother of time
[1:32:04] It was not because of
[1:32:07] anything but he preached what Paul
[1:32:09] preached.
[1:32:12] The rest is of God. Yes. The rest is of
[1:32:17] God. Preach the
[1:32:19] truth and the God will have his way.
[1:32:24] He has taught
[1:32:26] us to look up to
[1:32:30] God and we don't disturb anybody that I
[1:32:33] lack this or that lack
[1:32:38] that we go up to
[1:32:41] God. We do not compromise.
[1:32:46] One thing with
[1:32:50] brother I'm not an easy
[1:32:54] man I'm
[1:32:59] controversial one
[1:33:01] time we are going
[1:33:05] with
[1:33:07] brotheras we are crossing the
[1:33:10] bridge we met a drunkard left nand
[1:33:17] with nine
[1:33:19] guns. He commanded me to greet
[1:33:23] him. When had just come to
[1:33:26] power, he told me greet
[1:33:30] us. I told
[1:33:32] him leftand
[1:33:35] under the
[1:33:36] law, what powers do you have told me to
[1:33:38] greet you? I won't greet you.
[1:33:44] is very
[1:33:51] keen. Brother,
[1:33:54] brother Castas,
[1:33:56] they
[1:33:57] greeted. I
[1:33:59] refused. I went
[1:34:02] back. But under God's
[1:34:06] service, when you are saying, the power
[1:34:09] of God is behind you.
[1:34:13] The late brother Kasamba told me after
[1:34:16] two days they were all arrested. Why do
[1:34:18] you put a fake roadblock here?
[1:34:28] This is the sort of
[1:34:31] man has
[1:34:36] managed. He's
[1:34:39] temperant. He's
[1:34:42] patient. He has been slow with me.
[1:34:48] If I'd had been very very
[1:34:52] ruthless, if he was very
[1:34:57] ruthless, he would he would have broken
[1:34:59] me
[1:35:03] down. But here I
[1:35:05] am. I am
[1:35:08] standing. God bless you very
[1:35:11] much. Thank you. May God bless you.
[1:35:16] I will never stand against
[1:35:21] you. I will pray for you. You too pray
[1:35:24] for me because you are my
[1:35:28] pastor. God hears you better than me.
[1:35:32] And by the way, I want to remind
[1:35:35] you I was at one
[1:35:38] occasional you
[1:35:45] said I am
[1:35:48] retiring. You told
[1:35:51] him does not
[1:35:54] return. So you are not
[1:35:57] retiring. Your retirement is death.
[1:36:01] But you are still
[1:36:02] alive and you are still
[1:36:05] strong. We shall pray for you. We still
[1:36:09] need your
[1:36:10] ministry. He has helped us.
[1:36:13] Thank you very
[1:36:17] much. Dear sons, are you all very
[1:36:21] happy? Let us give God a hand
[1:36:24] clap. Very good.
[1:36:28] You call me and castas.
[1:36:33] And
[1:36:36] casters, that is my
[1:36:39] name. Praise God.
[1:36:44] I was mendered by my pastoral
[1:36:51] from the year
[1:36:55] 1986 June the 8 June the
[1:37:01] 8th up to the year
[1:37:06] 1992 when he dictated me when he
[1:37:09] dedicated me
[1:37:13] as a pastor
[1:37:16] to come over to
[1:37:19] and there God has done a lot of
[1:37:23] things and churches have come
[1:37:26] up among all the pastors in Campala
[1:37:30] within Ginger is only my pastor Stephen
[1:37:32] Ibal who has followed me up
[1:37:45] road. This road has been tak
[1:37:51] recently but he was able to travel that
[1:37:55] distance which has been all dusted.
[1:38:01] My pastor, I love you for that love you
[1:38:04] have for your sins.
[1:38:11] I think one of the pastors who has made
[1:38:13] it lastly is my brother, pastor
[1:38:16] Kabasi, Pardon. The one who has who has
[1:38:21] come up lastly to come over
[1:38:25] to just this year in March the 1st.
[1:38:32] is
[1:38:35] pastor and they have moved to do that to
[1:38:38] that far
[1:38:40] journey traveling over 24
[1:38:45] hours. I remember one person said
[1:38:48] it that the pastor is able to follow his
[1:38:51] flock up to where they are.
[1:38:57] God bless you very much for that spirit.
[1:39:00] The first day I got
[1:39:02] saved and when I came to Ginger,
[1:39:07] I got surprised to see that a sister
[1:39:11] will welcome me for lunch.
[1:39:19] Among all the churches, I'd never seen
[1:39:23] such experience.
[1:39:26] And I took note that this is a special
[1:39:32] family. Praise God.
[1:39:35] I just want to thank you very greatly.
[1:39:39] I remember after having stayed two years
[1:39:42] in
[1:39:43] Arua, I came back to visit Ginger
[1:39:48] and one of the first brothers who
[1:39:50] supported
[1:39:52] me spiritually and material
[1:40:01] pastor
[1:40:03] gift. I know that was the spirit brother
[1:40:07] pastor Steven imputed in
[1:40:11] him
[1:40:16] brother take that leadership in your
[1:40:20] life the right person being chosen for
[1:40:23] this job
[1:40:25] here may God bless you the family and
[1:40:28] the
[1:40:30] children praise
[1:40:32] God as the rest of them were
[1:40:36] saying three of us were not
[1:40:40] easy. Whenever we will come to a
[1:40:44] home to find issues concerning
[1:40:48] you and that was
[1:40:50] terrible. Praise
[1:40:53] God. Praise God.
[1:40:57] There's much to say but for the sake of
[1:41:02] timeless God bless you my sister.
[1:41:07] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:10] God bless you.
[1:41:17] Pastor
[1:41:22] James outgoing pastor
[1:41:26] responsible to show you the people you
[1:41:29] gave me
[1:41:32] please
[1:41:34] people and I was the head of the
[1:41:40] group and I've kept
[1:41:45] them not by my
[1:41:48] ability but your good
[1:41:52] leadership thank you very
[1:41:57] And there were young
[1:41:59] people here. They would meet me in the
[1:42:02] street and
[1:42:05] hide. He has he has committed no offense
[1:42:08] but only seeing me he
[1:42:12] hides. This was a very hard
[1:42:16] group. I cannot cheat you. Neither can
[1:42:19] anybody cheat me. Somebody was timing
[1:42:22] me. I was about to tell him that I can
[1:42:25] assume my authority here.
[1:42:30] So God bless you, brother Steven. I just
[1:42:33] want to give one
[1:42:36] testimony about you. But I have very
[1:42:38] many and there was a great one I wanted
[1:42:41] to give in the presence of my my uncle
[1:42:44] Ben witness.
[1:42:48] I want to appreciate ginger church.
[1:42:53] It brought us up in a hard
[1:42:55] way and we became strong and we are not
[1:42:58] ready to
[1:43:00] fall. Wherever we are, we are standing
[1:43:03] the way we are
[1:43:12] left. One day when we were in
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:24] The
[1:43:26] Lord impressed upon his heart. He was
[1:43:28] very
[1:43:31] heart. He was forced to re to retach
[1:43:37] about
[1:43:41] work and he was very authoritative at
[1:43:44] that
[1:43:46] moment because we were not complying.
[1:43:51] You know we are not a small small group
[1:43:54] very we are very difficult
[1:43:58] people. So he had told
[1:44:02] earlier should be standing at the
[1:44:06] doors on
[1:44:10] standby but I did not see
[1:44:13] it. I thought it was too much.
[1:44:19] the front. He was on the palpit.
[1:44:28] So I was seated on the bench. The door
[1:44:30] was here. I was seated on the bench
[1:44:32] because standing was the thing which was
[1:44:35] this is too
[1:44:39] much become
[1:44:43] like so I was seated on the bench.
[1:44:47] So the pastor was preaching very
[1:44:52] hard stand
[1:44:59] up. So I
[1:45:02] stood and I was quarreling in my heart
[1:45:07] again. It's too much.
[1:45:10] You
[1:45:12] see when God uses his servant
[1:45:18] Now by the time I raised my
[1:45:23] eyes man had already crossed under my
[1:45:26] nose and he was at the pastor said give
[1:45:29] me some
[1:45:33] fig but the man would have even banged
[1:45:40] me physical practically
[1:45:46] I really appreciate you for
[1:45:49] standing from that time. I've never
[1:45:54] wavered. What the word says, what the
[1:45:57] pastor says, what I do, that's what I
[1:46:01] teach. So, praise be the name of the
[1:46:04] Lord.
[1:46:06] I came to know the message in
[1:46:10] 1982
[1:46:13] immediately receive the
[1:46:17] message that's my pleasure.
[1:46:20] Okay. When I went, they believed the
[1:46:24] message. You know the first
[1:46:26] pastor, brother,
[1:46:29] he was my pastor there again.
[1:46:33] But you know the other church was hard
[1:46:34] to
[1:46:36] pastor could be 2,000 or less than
[1:46:39] 2,000. So you can imagine how you can
[1:46:41] survive when you're foreigner there.
[1:46:46] So I love pastor and I love this ginger
[1:46:50] church.
[1:46:52] There is not a church I've seen that
[1:46:54] love
[1:46:57] manifested. I lost a
[1:47:00] child like they were testifying all of
[1:47:03] us who are
[1:47:07] poor was very poor.
[1:47:12] I've lost a child.
[1:47:16] Some two
[1:47:18] brothers because of that love rode
[1:47:22] bicycles from Ginger up to that 100
[1:47:29] miles and where is my leader brother?
[1:47:35] I was shocked. God bless you brother.
[1:47:40] Without a strong pastor, people cannot
[1:47:42] have
[1:47:45] that. Praise be the name of I have many
[1:47:50] testimonies for ginger
[1:47:53] church. I will
[1:47:56] find one I wanted to speak. My witness
[1:47:58] is brother
[1:48:01] Ben. Simple people but very good people
[1:48:03] to God.
[1:48:07] Praise God. So that if you know, brother
[1:48:11] Steven will just call
[1:48:14] you. He's very intelligent,
[1:48:18] extra
[1:48:21] intelligent and when he calls you, he
[1:48:24] scans you
[1:48:25] through knows what you are going to tell
[1:48:27] him. What a liar.
[1:48:31] What? Brother deacon, I want this thing
[1:48:34] done.
[1:48:37] How will you do it upon you? But it must
[1:48:39] be done.
[1:48:45] Praise be the name of the Lord. So it
[1:48:47] trained us to be very attentive with
[1:48:50] what we are doing.
[1:48:54] God bless you. Amen.
[1:48:59] So
[1:49:00] members the foundation
[1:49:04] matters. That's why because of that
[1:49:07] training we have never thought of any
[1:49:10] other way.
[1:49:25] Praise be the name of the Lord. You have
[1:49:27] done a very good job.
[1:49:31] Brother James,
[1:49:33] you have somebody to to pick up
[1:49:36] from. Amen. Amen. Our training in ger me
[1:49:41] the Lord brought me to be trained.
[1:49:45] I received the message to be trained and
[1:49:48] then I'll tell you what
[1:49:53] happened. Once I was trained, I was sent
[1:49:57] out. God bless you my
[1:50:00] brother. God bless
[1:50:02] you with us. These are not easy people.
[1:50:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. When we step
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:23] into a lot of
[1:50:26] testimonies, praise the Lord. I thank go
[1:50:30] I thank the Lord for my fellow former
[1:50:34] brother.
[1:50:40] instilled in us
[1:50:46] about coming to church very
[1:50:49] early is a part of
[1:50:53] me want to come to church
[1:50:57] late before
[1:50:59] God looking at
[1:51:03] me looking at
[1:51:10] I usually feel so bad. So my wife
[1:51:13] struggles very much to make a breakfast
[1:51:16] for
[1:51:19] me so that
[1:51:26] before what you saying is
[1:51:29] right that in
[1:51:33] us all actually they are time conscious
[1:51:41] us very time
[1:51:43] conscious and I thank God for
[1:51:47] pastoral because I was reading in a
[1:51:49] certain
[1:51:51] message you know he loves him very much
[1:51:53] there's even you know a certain
[1:51:56] instrument which he gave
[1:52:00] me the message very much
[1:52:04] you know I don't know he really likes
[1:52:08] He gave me that radio. So I listen to it
[1:52:11] very
[1:52:13] much and I was reading certain
[1:52:20] book. He said a certain a certain man
[1:52:23] got
[1:52:25] saved. He was asked how did you get
[1:52:29] saved? Because of a good test a good
[1:52:33] preaching. He said no. Is it because of
[1:52:37] good
[1:52:38] singing? He said no. Is it because of
[1:52:42] this and
[1:52:43] that? He said no. He said in that office
[1:52:47] he was
[1:52:48] working. He was a
[1:52:50] man. He looked at his
[1:52:53] life and that's what made him get
[1:52:57] saved. So the small work I forot is
[1:52:59] because of
[1:53:00] pastoral
[1:53:02] pastoral. So I thank the Lord. Thank you
[1:53:05] very
[1:53:06] much. May the Lord bless him.

[1:55:42] Thank you very
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:49] much. This has been the
[1:55:54] chairperson. I've just been doing the
[1:55:56] work as a on his
[1:56:01] behalf. Thank you very much. May we give
[1:56:03] a big hand clap to the
[1:56:07] deacons and thank you very much for
[1:56:10] those
[1:56:12] words. There was a lot to learn from
[1:56:16] you. At least I visibly
[1:56:21] remember the day the madman walked to
[1:56:23] the pastor at the
[1:56:27] parit when I became a
[1:56:29] deacon. I knew what to do.
[1:56:34] Uh thank you.
[1:56:36] So about 36 years
[1:56:40] ago we had a visitor come
[1:56:45] home. That visitor rode on a very big
[1:56:50] bike. By then we were used to small
[1:56:53] motorbikes, those vespers, those
[1:56:57] most. So when he came
[1:57:00] unpacked, we stayed at highlight and
[1:57:02] there were many other houses
[1:57:06] around. I admired this big man on a big
[1:57:11] bike. I thought for me was living my
[1:57:17] dream. So when I watched to say where he
[1:57:19] was going cuz we were down playing
[1:57:22] downstairs, he climbed up the steps.
[1:57:26] Then I saw him enter our
[1:57:29] house. In my mind of a child, I thought,
[1:57:32] "Okay, I think I'm going to have an
[1:57:34] opportunity to sit on this big bike
[1:57:37] now." I quickly rushed into the house to
[1:57:40] greet this
[1:57:42] visitor who was actually
[1:57:45] pastoral. So I knew that I'll have
[1:57:47] opportunity to ride on ride on that
[1:57:51] bike. The problem was now how to ask for
[1:57:54] the opportunity to ride on the
[1:57:57] bike. We had been raised very strict.
[1:58:00] You only greet the visitor, go back and
[1:58:02] play outside. You don't
[1:58:06] interrupt. And now fast
[1:58:09] forward, fast forward. That's how the
[1:58:11] message came to our
[1:58:14] home. And we are grateful that for the
[1:58:17] last 36
[1:58:19] years from 1989
[1:58:23] Pastor Steven has been our pastor as a
[1:58:28] family from West Primary
[1:58:32] School. But what I want to say
[1:58:34] importantly before I invite the next
[1:58:36] person who is going to
[1:58:39] speak when this church was
[1:58:43] built, there were
[1:58:46] sisters, our
[1:58:49] mothers, very
[1:58:52] dedicated. They would come to church on
[1:58:54] Friday for fellowship.
[1:58:59] They would remain after the service and
[1:59:01] have an overnight as
[1:59:10] sisters. Then in the
[1:59:12] morning they would clean the whole
[1:59:16] church then walk
[1:59:20] home. At that point people never had
[1:59:22] vehicles or all
[1:59:25] that. So we thank God for them.
[1:59:29] And I saw on the
[1:59:30] program that we listen to something from
[1:59:33] at least one of the elder
[1:59:37] sisters. One of them was my
[1:59:41] mom who is not here
[1:59:43] today had been sort because of my
[1:59:46] grandma who is quite aged
[1:59:50] now making 98 years this year.
[1:59:55] She couldn't be here but uh appreciate
[1:59:58] our dear
[1:59:59] pastor did even call to say thanks.
[2:00:04] The other one is our sister who was
[2:00:06] rested in the
[2:00:10] Lord whom we really appreciate her labor
[2:00:13] of love
[2:00:15] also. At least here today we have sister
[2:00:18] Winnie and sister
[2:00:21] Vicki. I want to invite
[2:00:23] them and uh let them say a few
[2:00:28] words as we invite others to speak.
[2:00:30] Sister Winnie and Sister Vicki, please
[2:00:32] do come. Sister Winnie, Mr. Vicki, there
[2:00:36] they come.
[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:12] to my lady.
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:31] God bless
[2:01:34] you. I'm so so so
[2:01:38] grateful. I think I will not have the
[2:01:41] words to express whatever I want to say.
[2:01:48] My brothers and sisters,
[2:01:55] I am lost.
[2:01:58] I thank God
[2:02:00] for Pastor Steven.
[2:02:06] And I'm so so grateful that God brought
[2:02:09] Pastor
[2:02:10] Steven in
[2:02:12] ginger at the right
[2:02:19] time otherwise
[2:02:22] I don't think I would be what I
[2:02:26] am but
[2:02:30] I am so so grateful
[2:02:34] before the Lord God Almighty.
[2:02:39] Your ministry has made me what I am.
[2:03:00] from the right
[2:03:03] path. I'll continue testing my God for
[2:03:10] you and thank you for what you have
[2:03:15] done. Pastor
[2:03:20] James, he has done the right thing.
[2:03:26] I appreciate
[2:03:28] for what he has
[2:03:29] done. It is
[2:03:32] a
[2:03:38] car all of us
[2:03:42] Christians. Let us also take our portion
[2:03:45] of the
[2:03:49] word and let's continue with
[2:03:52] it as he will continue us, guiding us,
[2:03:57] protecting us to do the right thing.
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:04] We must take heed to this word.
[2:04:21] I came in March.
[2:04:25] I found brother David.
[2:04:30] He was in ginger
[2:04:33] with some other colleagues
[2:04:37] when we got this message about pastor.
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:48] Pastor heard of it.
[2:04:52] We didn't have the books to read
[2:04:57] but we heard of the
[2:05:01] prophet and from that
[2:05:05] time they were again the preaching you
[2:05:09] are not supposed to gather yourselves
[2:05:14] together then you will wonder what is
[2:05:20] that so Many things
[2:05:23] happened and then we were fellowshipping
[2:05:26] from
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:38] houses.
[2:05:40] until God brought
[2:05:53] to appreciate God for my pastor.
[2:05:58] I do believe he is God orained
[2:06:05] pastor. What I've seen in my life
[2:06:10] I am what I am because of his ministry.
[2:06:17] So I remembered my husband coming back
[2:06:21] from from
[2:06:27] he told us there's fellowship in ginger
[2:06:30] girls. We should be going there.
[2:06:38] Then we started going for fellowship in
[2:06:40] ginger
[2:06:44] girls. And now the fear I remember when
[2:06:47] some other people came
[2:06:49] in in the same
[2:06:55] school. They refused for us to be there.
[2:07:03] girls. So my husband requested,
[2:07:08] let's go fellowship from my house.
[2:07:13] Then we started fellowshipping from our
[2:07:15] house.
[2:07:19] I think until people got
[2:07:23] many then they got a place for
[2:07:30] us primary
[2:07:33] school
[2:07:34] then you know I used to work in council
[2:07:41] every meeting
[2:07:43] they will say we don't want in our
[2:07:46] schools in our community
[2:07:55] until God really helped us when brother
[2:07:58] David got a place in Main Street Primary
[2:08:01] School.
[2:08:07] Then he requested for a place there.
[2:08:13] from Main Street Primary School
[2:08:19] until God blessed us with this place
[2:08:22] here.
[2:08:35] left
[2:08:36] us. You are next to us
[2:08:40] in
[2:08:43] everything. So Lord, so my brothers and
[2:08:50] sisters, we should take heed to this
[2:08:55] message. Let us
[2:09:00] continue. Let us bring it forth to a
[2:09:03] reality.
[2:09:08] Let this goel be seen in
[2:09:13] us. I thank God for each and
[2:09:19] everything. There is one thing of my
[2:09:22] past
[2:09:28] with when I got my last born.
[2:09:36] This boy had a problem.
[2:09:40] I don't know what it was.
[2:09:44] I think when he got an attack in the
[2:09:47] morning, I went to the doctor's
[2:09:53] place. The doctor looked at
[2:09:58] me and said, "You stupid woman. How can
[2:10:01] you bring me such a
[2:10:07] child? I said doctor this thing happened
[2:10:10] in the night. That's why I'm here early
[2:10:13] in the
[2:10:17] morning. I think from there he kept
[2:10:22] quiet. Then God brought in
[2:10:30] He prayed for this boy.
[2:10:34] After praying for him,
[2:10:37] he said, "Sister Winnie,
[2:10:40] Sister Winnie, go and get cold liver oil
[2:10:45] if you have some money."
[2:10:48] Cold liver oil.
[2:10:52] Cold liver oil. Cold liver oil.
[2:10:57] So I went and bought that liver
[2:11:02] oil. I gave this boy to
[2:11:06] take. He finished the first
[2:11:11] bottle. I went and got the second
[2:11:15] bottle. He finished it.
[2:11:19] And from that time
[2:11:22] this boy never got an attack as he used
[2:11:27] [Music]
[2:11:30] to.
[2:11:33] So it's really the Lord God Almighty who
[2:11:37] sent you to us.
[2:11:42] I'll continue thanking God for
[2:11:47] you family.
[2:11:51] Let God's blessings never part from your
[2:11:55] home.
[2:12:03] I am so so
[2:12:06] grateful and I'm very humbled.
[2:12:11] God will continue standing with
[2:12:15] you after giving up your
[2:12:20] job knowing that you gave it up because
[2:12:23] of you know corruption corruption
[2:12:29] corruption. You never had that in your
[2:12:33] heart.
[2:12:36] That's
[2:12:37] why it's your job.
[2:12:41] This God who has brought us this far,
[2:12:48] he is the same God.
[2:12:52] Hebrews
[2:12:53] 138. Yep.
[2:12:59] Hebrews 138.
[2:13:04] This God will never leave
[2:13:06] us. He has brought us this
[2:13:10] far. He knows us right from our
[2:13:17] hearts. It's my
[2:13:21] prayer. Let's take heed to the word of
[2:13:26] God. We live by it.
[2:13:32] Let's walk by it
[2:13:36] and let's continue until the Lord Jesus
[2:13:39] will come.
[2:13:44] Thank you so
[2:13:48] much. We shall pray for
[2:13:50] you. That is the best we can do.
[2:13:57] We are living because of other people's
[2:14:00] prayers.
[2:14:05] Thank you so much. I appreciate you.
[2:14:09] Amen. Amen.
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:16] Praise God.
[2:14:19] It's indeed a great day.
[2:14:22] We are so grateful to God.
[2:14:27] I came to know the ministry of
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:38] 1994 through my
[2:14:45] friend. We were all
[2:14:48] working
[2:14:51] then marketing board. Uh it was not an
[2:14:56] easy journey
[2:14:59] but thankfully I got a ministry that
[2:15:02] would encourage me on the on the
[2:15:04] journey.
[2:15:10] My background was
[2:15:15] Catholic and I could never sleep without
[2:15:17] a rosary on my
[2:15:21] neck, especially when I lost my
[2:15:26] mother. So to hear something
[2:15:29] else didn't make any sense to me.
[2:15:35] But God's way our
[2:15:39] understanding. Yeah. So when I got this
[2:15:43] message, I was in some kind of
[2:15:49] crisis and I got
[2:15:52] support from these
[2:15:56] sisters from the pastor.
[2:16:00] I just remember one particular
[2:16:05] instance. I had children, small
[2:16:07] children, two small
[2:16:09] children. They were going to many
[2:16:11] street.
[2:16:13] At that time, I had lost the
[2:16:16] job. So there was
[2:16:19] nothing. You would wake up not knowing
[2:16:21] what to do
[2:16:25] next. And the pastor had traveled
[2:16:29] because I had explained my problems. He
[2:16:31] came to
[2:16:34] know. So this particular time I woke
[2:16:39] up as usual. I was there lost for what
[2:16:42] to do. I had prayed and prayed out my
[2:16:47] heart. I told God I'm like that widow
[2:16:50] woman in the
[2:16:54] Bible. the
[2:16:56] children. He had two
[2:16:59] children and he had nothing to put
[2:17:02] before them.
[2:17:04] But when she prayed,
[2:17:07] you send your
[2:17:10] prophet to
[2:17:12] her. So I said, "Where is your
[2:17:17] prophet?" So I was just lost there. But
[2:17:21] a few minutes after that prayer,
[2:17:26] I had a knock at the
[2:17:29] door. I wip I wiped up my tears
[2:17:34] quickly. I came to check who was
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:39] knocking and I found it was
[2:17:43] sister and she said pastor sent her to
[2:17:47] me a message.
[2:17:51] At that time I had something to give my
[2:17:55] children and his pastor who really
[2:17:58] reaches out to whoever was
[2:18:05] in he got to know everyone's
[2:18:10] condition over it and provided where
[2:18:13] there was need.
[2:18:18] I thank God so much for
[2:18:22] that. Thank you so much pastor for
[2:18:25] holding my
[2:18:28] hand, devising, praying and
[2:18:32] everything. So grateful to
[2:18:35] God. No doubt God has bless you, will
[2:18:38] continue to bless you.
[2:18:44] want to thank God so much for our
[2:18:48] brothers. Definitely a big that you are
[2:18:51] stepping
[2:18:54] in a good thing you have been
[2:18:59] rehearsing too
[2:19:03] heavy. Yeah. So we shall definitely keep
[2:19:06] you in
[2:19:08] prayer. His grace will suffice.
[2:19:12] Thank you very much. The Lord bless you
[2:19:18] all. Thank you very much.
[2:19:22] The Lord bless you.
[2:19:26] Uh one day I was having a conversation
[2:19:29] with
[2:19:32] pastor in the last year last year but
[2:19:35] one and
[2:19:36] then he just mentioned to me said Peter
[2:19:40] I said yes
[2:19:42] pastor he said I pastored your
[2:19:46] parents I have pastored you now again I
[2:19:50] pastor your
[2:19:52] children they will think I am mad
[2:19:58] said I think I am going to hand over
[2:20:03] but also ministers over
[2:20:07] but uh we thank you pastor
[2:20:10] you know there are many
[2:20:13] stories pastor is a real pastor it was
[2:20:16] just beyond the
[2:20:17] [Music]
[2:20:19] preaching I remember one time after he
[2:20:22] came back from out he'd been away on
[2:20:24] missionary out of the
[2:20:28] country and you know suddenly realizes
[2:20:31] but there's this brother who is
[2:20:34] missing and you know he would go after
[2:20:38] them this lost
[2:20:41] sheep. So while pastor was away the
[2:20:44] brother found himself a wife and settled
[2:20:49] somewhere. Pastor goes and looks for the
[2:20:53] brother and finds him in a very terrible
[2:20:58] state and pastor went to buy food for
[2:21:02] him. I was just wondering then just one
[2:21:05] thing said my son don't let this message
[2:21:08] slip from you.
[2:21:12] It was very bad and the brother was in a
[2:21:14] very sorry
[2:21:16] state and the pastor had gone like his
[2:21:19] father really trying to you know picking
[2:21:21] up from this pit he had fallen
[2:21:23] [Music]
[2:21:26] into the pastor whom we have
[2:21:29] had we thank you very
[2:21:31] much pastor has been doing a lot of
[2:21:34] missionary
[2:21:35] work this moment I want to invite
[2:21:38] brother Herodas
[2:21:42] to speak on behalf of the new
[2:21:47] ministers just very briefly and then
[2:21:50] I'll pastor to speak on behalf of the
[2:21:53] elderly
[2:22:02] [Music]
[2:22:04] ministers. God bless
[2:22:11] you. Yeah. That you allow him speak in
[2:22:15] the language he can explain
[2:22:19] properly. He's pastor
[2:22:23] Rogers because of God's
[2:22:28] grace that is going to be brief. He will
[2:22:31] not delay us.
[2:22:34] Don't get worried of him. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:40] I welcome all the pastors but most of
[2:22:43] them have already
[2:22:47] left. Those who are who have remained,
[2:22:51] please stand up
[2:22:58] for Yes.
[2:23:03] So just come here for recognition
[2:23:06] whether you have come from
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:13] as long as you came out of the
[2:23:14] denomination. Amen. You are most
[2:23:19] welcome because even the Pentecostals is
[2:23:22] a denomination. Amen.
[2:23:27] Yes. So
[2:23:31] Much has been spoken.
[2:23:36] Those who have not been here have missed
[2:23:38] a lot.
[2:23:42] We want to thank you pastor
[2:23:46] Steven since morning when we
[2:23:51] arrived. Whatever is coming out is
[2:23:53] giving us
[2:23:55] courage. Ever since we reached
[2:24:01] here, we have found out that somebody
[2:24:04] can stay with an individual for 20 years
[2:24:07] when you are serving.
[2:24:09] But that's not there in Pentecost. Yes.
[2:24:20] I've learned it from here that you can
[2:24:22] serve with somebody for all that long,
[2:24:25] but when he's still loving you and gives
[2:24:27] you respect,
[2:24:30] you have really surprised
[2:24:35] us. What I'm going to say is a bit
[2:24:38] different from other
[2:24:41] pastors because I'm hearing two people
[2:24:47] Steven, we have pastoral Stevens.
[2:24:53] And then we have Pastor James
[2:24:59] Kumba. You allow me speak these two
[2:25:05] things. The first thing I learned from
[2:25:08] Pastor
[2:25:10] Steven and what I usually tell these
[2:25:13] brothers that I stay with
[2:25:17] apart from serving in the
[2:25:20] church and in the whole ministry.
[2:25:26] He has built a name in the
[2:25:31] world. I remember
[2:25:36] in refused to ride motorbikes.
[2:25:45] Uh we went and we went to minister in
[2:25:53] Uganda after crossing. No no no no.
[2:25:59] Yes. But before reaching
[2:26:04] roundabout we found there the traffic
[2:26:06] and they they got us.
[2:26:14] They had captured so many motorcycles
[2:26:17] and loading them on the road is taking
[2:26:21] them and we didn't have any letter to
[2:26:27] us the truth. We deceived them
[2:26:32] somehow. Yes.
[2:26:35] We told them that we are
[2:26:37] ministers and we are from ministry
[2:26:43] work. Were you not told that you were
[2:26:46] not supposed to ride this
[2:26:49] motorcycle? We were asked where we came
[2:26:54] from. We told them we fellowship
[2:26:58] from church.
[2:27:06] this pastor who preaches on
[2:27:11] radio then said these are for a great
[2:27:16] man since that
[2:27:22] day I learned that building a name is
[2:27:26] very
[2:27:28] great because of his name we were
[2:27:31] released to
[2:27:33] When we come to the
[2:27:38] ministry though others were saying that
[2:27:40] they were very
[2:27:45] difficult but to the Pentecost for us
[2:27:48] who were Pentecostals were very very
[2:27:54] difficult. We thank that he has handled
[2:27:58] us very well.
[2:28:04] Yes. Yeah. He has withtood so many
[2:28:07] things because of
[2:28:09] us. We were in one place that I will not
[2:28:13] mention and even the person who said it,
[2:28:16] I will not
[2:28:18] mention. We were seated in a service.
[2:28:28] One person said those have come to
[2:28:31] there's nothing that can make them the
[2:28:33] message
[2:28:37] here. By the time I told for him he had
[2:28:40] them long ago but he was just patient.
[2:28:46] You have really handled
[2:28:49] us. Amen.
[2:28:52] We have not come to discourage
[2:28:56] you but we have
[2:29:00] learned. People can give testimonies on
[2:29:03] you what you're
[2:29:05] saying. We shall take it back to our
[2:29:08] churches. that heart of
[2:29:15] ministering. Pastor Steven has had it
[2:29:19] ever since we joined him in
[2:29:21] 2007. I remember one
[2:29:24] thing. I had no food at
[2:29:27] home. That heart of
[2:29:32] ministering. I told him we slept hungry.
[2:29:36] Brother, he said, "Brother Rogers, I
[2:29:39] don't have
[2:29:42] money and where we come from, they don't
[2:29:45] expect that we don't have
[2:29:48] money." He told me, "Let's go home.
[2:29:55] what I know since that
[2:29:59] day. He told the
[2:30:02] mother, "Brother Roger has nothing to
[2:30:06] do. Is there some
[2:30:11] FL?" I realized really the man has no
[2:30:15] money but wants to help
[2:30:17] me. It touched me.
[2:30:22] But what has he has helped us in this
[2:30:26] group
[2:30:30] first that we are not supposed to corn
[2:30:33] but we are supposed to eat what is
[2:30:36] right I remember one
[2:30:42] year there's a brother we
[2:30:47] had he went there and he wanted some
[2:30:53] money. But when we
[2:30:56] reached where we were going to meet
[2:30:59] him, he asked us, "What is
[2:31:08] your we left when we had even lost the
[2:31:12] appetite of requesting for money apart
[2:31:14] from going to
[2:31:16] dig? We want to thank you
[2:31:20] together with the
[2:31:25] mother. I learned
[2:31:28] from place that you can call your wife
[2:31:33] mommy in Pentecost that is not there.
[2:31:40] You learn all the kind of
[2:31:42] discipline
[2:31:48] ministry. I want to assure you that in
[2:31:51] this in your old age, you are going to
[2:31:53] be
[2:31:56] peaceful. Because what would disturb
[2:31:59] you, you have already laid a
[2:32:01] foundation. We want to encourage
[2:32:03] you what you gave
[2:32:07] us until
[2:32:12] You'll
[2:32:14] be we shall still have
[2:32:17] it. We shall not go back
[2:32:21] because to go back. You already brought
[2:32:24] us
[2:32:26] from want. Thank you for pastor James
[2:32:29] that you are
[2:32:31] handed. You just produced yourself. Yes.
[2:32:40] We have not made any
[2:32:48] loss. The the love is the
[2:32:51] same. The teaching is the
[2:32:56] same. And what is very important, James
[2:32:59] can manage us. He can manage
[2:33:04] us. and he can manage us there
[2:33:12] more. Yeah, he was difficult when I
[2:33:19] not and
[2:33:21] he was encouraging me be patient with
[2:33:24] him.
[2:33:29] The one you have left to us, we love him
[2:33:31] so much.
[2:33:34] We love him and we love him.
[2:33:48] I had never seen it in Pentecostal and
[2:33:50] it has never happened that somebody can
[2:33:54] load his vehicle, personal vehicle and
[2:33:57] put put people even up
[2:34:01] to that is a sign of
[2:34:05] love. Our precious
[2:34:08] God when we call
[2:34:11] you don't say that I left you
[2:34:18] James I have finished God bless you
[2:34:22] brother as the programmer
[2:34:28] comes thank you for the church
[2:34:32] buildings and even the pieces of
[2:34:36] and you would be changing
[2:34:43] vehicles. May God bless you so much.
[2:34:51] Thank you. Can we give a big hand clap
[2:34:54] to the
[2:34:58] um Thank you very
[2:35:02] much. May I take this opportunity to
[2:35:04] invite Pastor James Misaka please
[2:35:09] as the IAL family prepare to speak after
[2:35:13] Pastor James has spoken. So
[2:35:16] [Music]
[2:35:18] let me find your
[2:35:23] grace
[2:35:27] in God bless
[2:35:30] everybody. too.
[2:35:33] Uh on behalf
[2:35:36] of
[2:35:37] the elders, elder elder
[2:35:43] ministers and on behalf of my church
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:48] in I want to appreciate the
[2:35:52] opportunity of coming here to stand here
[2:35:56] on this day on a very important occasion
[2:35:59] like this.
[2:36:04] uh
[2:36:05] when uh when the brother was asking me
[2:36:09] to
[2:36:12] speak, I thought he had forgotten the
[2:36:14] way I had
[2:36:19] dressed and not I've not dressed like
[2:36:24] ministers because I didn't know that I
[2:36:26] would come and appear here.
[2:36:32] So I
[2:36:35] ask and pastor James to forgive me
[2:36:40] for behaving like this but I didn't know
[2:36:47] uh I don't know what I can say which can
[2:36:52] be different or any better than what has
[2:36:54] been spoken.
[2:37:00] But there was somebody who made a
[2:37:05] statement that an old man when he is
[2:37:11] seated. He can see he can see where a
[2:37:14] young man who is standing cannot see.
[2:37:23] So if I could not come here and say
[2:37:26] something about my
[2:37:30] friend who has done a lot of good things
[2:37:33] spiritually in my
[2:37:38] life who has made the message in Uganda
[2:37:41] to be what it
[2:37:46] is. I remember I believed this message
[2:37:50] when I was in Kenya
[2:37:54] and uh when I could come over to Uganda
[2:37:59] comparing to the message that we were
[2:38:01] having in
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:05] Kenya. Uh I used to feel there is
[2:38:09] something
[2:38:12] needed that is in the 80s.
[2:38:16] uh early 80s and
[2:38:22] mid80s. But things
[2:38:25] changed when God gave brother a
[2:38:32] vision. God has given him special
[2:38:36] grace that when he reads a message book
[2:38:44] uh or he comes to present a
[2:38:49] subject even if you have read that
[2:38:53] book you wonder where you
[2:38:56] read you wonder where whether what you
[2:38:59] are hearing comes from the message you
[2:39:01] believe.
[2:39:05] So he has an eagle
[2:39:07] eye. He sees
[2:39:10] far on the things of
[2:39:12] God. And I remember in the
[2:39:16] 80s God helped him
[2:39:19] and
[2:39:24] [Music]
[2:39:25] and they took the teaching under his
[2:39:29] leadership.
[2:39:34] and things
[2:39:35] changed and I felt at home in the
[2:39:38] message world in my
[2:39:44] place. God bless you my
[2:39:48] brother. God has given you special
[2:39:50] wisdom. Nobody can can refute that.
[2:39:58] God has given you
[2:40:01] humility that you can hear a lot of
[2:40:03] things spoken about
[2:40:07] you that you can meet a minister even
[2:40:09] who has less than what you
[2:40:15] have and respect and respect his his his
[2:40:19] path his
[2:40:23] calling and encourage
[2:40:27] until out of
[2:40:30] that ministers who have worked with
[2:40:34] you have always changed
[2:40:38] and I want to
[2:40:39] say some of us have
[2:40:43] changed because of our association with
[2:40:47] you. God has given you grace to
[2:40:50] understand
[2:40:53] people. You can talk with somebody and
[2:40:55] uplift him, yet you know his
[2:41:01] weaknesses and you can be able to handle
[2:41:06] somebody still remain a friend when he's
[2:41:09] an
[2:41:13] enemy. I think that's the spirit of
[2:41:17] God. No wonder your
[2:41:20] calling. When we look at your calling,
[2:41:24] Very rarely somebody can live such a
[2:41:26] fine family, rich
[2:41:31] family, everything you want in
[2:41:34] life and get on the streets and roads on
[2:41:39] foot. Get on streets and roads on
[2:41:45] foot and suffer
[2:41:49] lack and forsake
[2:41:52] such important resources in your
[2:41:57] home for for something for a new found
[2:42:03] faith that is
[2:42:05] unique and we want to thank God for such
[2:42:08] a
[2:42:10] leadership. I am I want to appreciate
[2:42:14] God for the spirit of
[2:42:20] respect that you have for each one's
[2:42:24] level of
[2:42:28] faith. You understand we are not the
[2:42:33] same. We want to thank
[2:42:35] God that you together with your precious
[2:42:39] wife. You have raised your
[2:42:43] children in such a special
[2:42:45] way that what we see you behave with
[2:42:48] your
[2:42:51] wife is exactly what we see your your
[2:42:54] children behave with their
[2:42:59] husband. We want to thank God for that.
[2:43:03] It's a level. It's a leaf we must
[2:43:08] pick. And
[2:43:10] uh brother,
[2:43:14] God bless you so
[2:43:16] much. I was in your church for about two
[2:43:24] months in
[2:43:27] 1985. I've never forgotten your fiery
[2:43:30] services.
[2:43:35] And the grace of God he has given you up
[2:43:37] to
[2:43:40] now leading big congregation like that
[2:43:43] in cities is not
[2:43:48] easy. Congratulations for what happened
[2:43:55] recently for God giving you a bride to
[2:43:58] to comfort you.
[2:44:03] I met
[2:44:05] brother in
[2:44:09] 1996 with
[2:44:12] brother when brother came to Uganda the
[2:44:15] first
[2:44:18] time I know he doesn't
[2:44:21] know we traveled with him from
[2:44:27] to the same taxi
[2:44:32] And one thing I knew about the
[2:44:35] two, they were both sick that
[2:44:39] time. The brother was very
[2:44:42] sick. The late brother was also very
[2:44:47] sick. But they later turned out to be
[2:44:49] buddies and friends to me.
[2:44:54] uh brother uh Steven we have traveled
[2:44:58] with him somehow on missions
[2:45:03] out I remember three
[2:45:07] incidences one time the enemy wanted to
[2:45:09] capsize us on the
[2:45:14] [Music]
[2:45:17] lake in the middle of the the
[2:45:22] lake And the fuel was
[2:45:26] depleted. It was finished.
[2:45:29] So we stayed there. We didn't know what
[2:45:30] to do.
[2:45:33] Lord helped us to go out to come out.
[2:45:36] Another day we were going
[2:45:41] to we don't know what happened in the
[2:45:43] vehicle.
[2:45:45] Most of us passengers got
[2:45:50] asleep and even the driver also
[2:45:56] dozed and we're going to get a fatal
[2:46:01] accident. God helped him. We
[2:46:05] stopped when he jumped out of a vehicle
[2:46:07] with a very big
[2:46:10] snake. We
[2:46:14] stopped. Then another day we are
[2:46:16] traveling with him alone in the
[2:46:22] night. We saw a man coming in
[2:46:26] front carrying a big
[2:46:30] log. We thought he was taking a ball at
[2:46:34] home. So when we reaching
[2:46:38] nearby he threw it in front of us.
[2:46:42] So he wanted to to get the vehicle I
[2:46:45] think
[2:46:48] overturn how he wrestled through that
[2:46:51] problem and we
[2:46:53] crossed. It's only God who understood
[2:46:56] the mechanism.
[2:47:00] So the grace of God
[2:47:04] has been great on you my brother.
[2:47:08] You have wiped many tears.
[2:47:12] You have broken uh difficult
[2:47:16] spirits. You have awakened many to the
[2:47:21] faith. And you have established a
[2:47:25] legacy.
[2:47:29] You have done you have run a wonderful
[2:47:34] race is recognized.
[2:47:38] You can dispute that.
[2:47:40] I remember in
[2:47:43] history brother uh John
[2:47:47] Wesley was a man of prayer.
[2:47:51] But whenever there would be an
[2:47:54] [Music]
[2:47:55] opposition, he would tell them, "Let
[2:47:58] that man come and meet
[2:48:01] me." However vocal and intelligent that
[2:48:04] man would
[2:48:06] be when he stood in the presence of John
[2:48:11] Wesley, he wanted it or not, he would
[2:48:16] believe. God gave him special power.
[2:48:22] And we cannot go without mentioning
[2:48:26] this. God has given you, as you said,
[2:48:29] God has given you knowledge with
[2:48:34] power that whenever you speak to
[2:48:38] somebody, God comes
[2:48:40] down. At first, I thought you are just
[2:48:43] an
[2:48:45] evangelist. I'm using the word just. I'm
[2:48:47] not I'm not minimizing the ministry of
[2:48:49] an evangelist, but I thought you an
[2:48:55] evangelist. But when I saw you again
[2:48:57] preach, I thought you are a
[2:49:02] pastor. When I see again you preach, I
[2:49:04] thought you an apostle. So I didn't know
[2:49:06] who you
[2:49:13] are. You know, people talk about being
[2:49:17] Uh the round man they say what all
[2:49:23] around. We thank God for the grace God
[2:49:26] has given
[2:49:28] us in your
[2:49:32] person and we thank God for such an
[2:49:36] occasion that we come and rehears the
[2:49:38] things God has done in your life.
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:43] have not been
[2:49:45] selfish. You have not been
[2:49:50] disrespectful. When you see brother
[2:49:52] Steven at a
[2:49:55] distance, you don't see the right
[2:49:58] man. But if you want to see the right
[2:50:00] man, come close to
[2:50:03] him. At a distance, you think he's an
[2:50:06] arrogant, proud man.
[2:50:12] But when you he comes
[2:50:14] near, you see he's a kind person. He's
[2:50:17] understanding.
[2:50:22] There is a lot we have learned from
[2:50:25] you. God bless you so
[2:50:29] much. What you have
[2:50:32] done. I know uh in the word of
[2:50:38] God we don't just I remember you said
[2:50:41] one time we don't minister
[2:50:47] statements but you pass
[2:50:53] over to another
[2:50:55] person. So what you have done you have
[2:50:58] passed over the
[2:51:01] genes who sit in the ministers who have
[2:51:04] gone all
[2:51:07] over and we are also going to enjoy the
[2:51:11] same
[2:51:14] genes in our brother
[2:51:17] James if I've ever found a very humble
[2:51:21] young
[2:51:25] man Like I've said, when you see brother
[2:51:29] James also at a
[2:51:33] distance, you cannot understand him.
[2:51:38] But when you come closer,
[2:51:40] you can think he's a very soft
[2:51:44] man. When it comes to handling the
[2:51:46] things of
[2:51:48] God, you discover he's a very hard
[2:51:52] man. You see and that is how a minister
[2:51:56] is supposed to
[2:51:59] be. So with the wisdom of brother
[2:52:01] Steven,
[2:52:03] [Music]
[2:52:05] you have given us a
[2:52:08] challenge, I think we are not going to
[2:52:11] hold on power even when we are weak the
[2:52:14] way some of us are.
[2:52:21] We must go back and set our houses in
[2:52:27] order. You know this question rose
[2:52:31] up during the barrier of our brother
[2:52:35] [Music]
[2:52:37] bowlers. We started scratching our
[2:52:39] heads.
[2:52:40] Ah I think that thing must be
[2:52:45] addressed. You have set a pace.
[2:52:50] You have given us
[2:52:53] wisdom. We have a path to
[2:52:57] follow. Just be strong, brother James.
[2:53:03] Just know that the God who you know you
[2:53:06] are not you are not
[2:53:09] young. I believe you are past the age of
[2:53:13] kings in in Israel like like David, the
[2:53:16] the noble king we know of.
[2:53:25] after 30
[2:53:30] years. So you have come to the
[2:53:32] leadership at an a later
[2:53:37] age than brother
[2:53:42] Steven. I've known you are intelligent.
[2:53:47] I known you are
[2:53:50] strong. I don't think there is anything
[2:53:52] which will make you
[2:53:56] tremble. We shall be praying with
[2:54:00] you. Shall be standing with
[2:54:02] you. God bless you sister
[2:54:06] Sara. You have been a very wonderful
[2:54:09] mother, a very wonderful example in the
[2:54:12] church.
[2:54:15] And uh I know you have been a wonderful
[2:54:18] mentor to sister Beatric.
[2:54:24] To me this hand over
[2:54:28] and this take
[2:54:30] over. I see it beyond natural
[2:54:37] relationship. I look at
[2:54:41] character. You know when you are going
[2:54:42] for a relay
[2:54:45] However much you run a race very
[2:54:49] well, you watch the person you are
[2:54:51] handing the
[2:54:54] steak. So by God's
[2:54:58] wisdom, we the brothers handed the right
[2:55:03] person. God bless you so much.
[2:55:11] Thank you very much uh pastor James for
[2:55:13] those
[2:55:14] [Music]
[2:55:17] words. You would have a lot
[2:55:22] more. I would like to invite the
[2:55:27] family as the youth will be preparing to
[2:55:31] speak after.
[2:55:33] [Music]
[2:55:42] Pray for so um after the family we shall
[2:55:46] have the youth
[2:55:48] and then after youth we shall cut the
[2:55:50] cake. God spoke to humble Mary of
[2:55:55] Emmanuel the
[2:55:57] [Music]
[2:55:58] King to Elizabeth he spoke of John and
[2:56:03] Jesus Christ our
[2:56:09] Lord could have had the world but she
[2:56:12] prayed for her son
[2:56:15] [Music]
[2:56:16] soul and many times I've seen God's
[2:56:20] grace
[2:56:21] Because my mother
[2:56:28] [Music]
[2:56:34] pray let us call on his
[2:56:38] name and lift our eyes to the hills.
[2:56:43] from
[2:56:44] when our help we wait on you to hope
[2:56:50] never fails.
[2:57:00] God bless you.
[2:57:03] Thank you so much for being here.
[2:57:07] We appreciate you for the very long
[2:57:11] journeys you've taken.
[2:57:16] to be here and celebrate our daddy,
[2:57:22] our hero.
[2:57:25] Our daddy is our
[2:57:29] guardian. Our daddy has been uh
[2:57:33] everything to
[2:57:35] us and we really appreciate him so
[2:57:38] much. We thank God for him.
[2:57:43] all the years he has been in
[2:57:47] ministry. Thank all of you for standing
[2:57:50] with
[2:57:53] him, praying for
[2:57:55] him. All those who visited when daddy
[2:57:58] was away on mission, he used to travel a
[2:58:04] lot. Daddy was always the
[2:58:06] disciplinarian, not mommy.
[2:58:11] Mommy, I don't remember mommy beating
[2:58:14] us,
[2:58:17] but daddy. Daddy. Oh, daddy said, "I'm a
[2:58:24] pastor. I have a big
[2:58:27] ministry." And there's no way you're
[2:58:29] going to spoil this
[2:58:32] ministry. You have to stay in line.
[2:58:36] And we thank you, Daddy, for that.
[2:58:40] because if you had let us go probably
[2:58:42] would not be standing
[2:58:45] here. We really thank God because um you
[2:58:50] took what the word says spare the
[2:58:53] road spoil the
[2:58:59] child. And when you ask all our babies
[2:59:02] here, they'll tell
[2:59:05] you that is a scripture we really
[2:59:08] treasure so
[2:59:12] much. We thank you uh daddy. We thank
[2:59:16] mommy for being by your side.
[2:59:22] Mommy has been very strong,
[2:59:26] a very source, very big source of
[2:59:29] support for
[2:59:32] dad. She's been a pillar while daddy is
[2:59:35] away in
[2:59:40] ministry. But like daddy said to pastor
[2:59:44] James is also my so
[2:59:51] that the family should be his first
[2:59:54] church.
[2:59:58] We would wake up so early in the
[3:00:01] morning and daddy would play the tape.
[3:00:06] would listen to the tape before we go to
[3:00:11] school. And at that time, we were all
[3:00:15] dozing, but we kept pinching each
[3:00:20] other cuz he would
[3:00:23] pause and then ask
[3:00:26] you and we could just couldn't
[3:00:32] remember where we were. Then mommy told
[3:00:36] daddy
[3:00:40] and mommy told daddy that you leave the
[3:00:43] children they have to go to
[3:00:47] school wake up like an hour before cuz
[3:00:50] we needed to listen to the
[3:00:56] tape. It was very good training and we
[3:00:59] thank God for
[3:01:01] that. Daddy has been
[3:01:04] u a missionary all over the country and
[3:01:08] we were we are privileged to travel with
[3:01:17] him but one thing uh maybe you don't
[3:01:20] know about
[3:01:23] dad is that his daughters have been his
[3:01:27] u weakest point.
[3:01:34] We know the church was daddy's first
[3:01:36] girlfriend
[3:01:41] and then his family came after the
[3:01:44] [Music]
[3:01:46] church because several times he had to
[3:01:49] stay home without school fees because he
[3:01:51] had to pay school fees for some of the
[3:01:53] believers in church.
[3:01:58] [Music]
[3:02:03] Like pastor said, uh, people would come
[3:02:10] home, they wanted some food and whatever
[3:02:13] was in the house would be taken and
[3:02:15] would take porridge.
[3:02:18] [Music]
[3:02:21] But uh it's not that we are
[3:02:25] complaining. We are thankful to God that
[3:02:28] there are lessons we learned
[3:02:31] from when we had uh that maybe a
[3:02:35] brother's home has burnt down or
[3:02:41] something. You would run
[3:02:44] home. The first thing you would do was
[3:02:46] to hide our nice clothes from the
[3:02:48] suitcase.
[3:02:52] Because you would get home, mommy would
[3:02:54] tell you, "I
[3:02:56] am you would tell mommy open your
[3:02:59] suitcase." And then she would tell us,
[3:03:01] "You don't give out the bad ones."
[3:03:04] She always wanted us to give the good
[3:03:07] ones and pick out your best ones and
[3:03:13] hide. So that when they come, she comes
[3:03:17] to sort.
[3:03:20] You know, your best ones are safe.
[3:03:23] [Laughter]
[3:03:24] [Music]
[3:03:26] We had we missed meals in our house
[3:03:29] several
[3:03:33] times. There are so many times when
[3:03:35] mommy had served and then visitors would
[3:03:37] come
[3:03:41] in. Then she would come for your plates
[3:03:43] of food,
[3:03:46] visitors. again. So we decided to learn
[3:03:50] one thing. Try
[3:03:58] again that when mommy served us food,
[3:04:04] the first thing we did was to eat our
[3:04:06] meat.
[3:04:11] So that when the visitors
[3:04:14] come, at least you've eaten some meat.
[3:04:23] Growing up as a pastor's daughter, as
[3:04:26] pastor's children was really
[3:04:32] fun. But I think we accepted it and uh
[3:04:37] we embraced it. We enjoyed it. We say
[3:04:39] this was our
[3:04:44] life. We used to
[3:04:47] I think they also didn't know better
[3:04:51] then because we had one
[3:04:55] bedroom for the
[3:04:57] children and then it had a triple
[3:05:02] deca.
[3:05:04] So we used to sleep share those decas
[3:05:08] and visitors would come and would share
[3:05:10] those with them.
[3:05:16] So one time we had a a believer from
[3:05:20] Nairobi who came and stayed with us for
[3:05:22] a very long
[3:05:27] time. And uh I used to stay on one
[3:05:32] up in the
[3:05:34] middle and a visitor
[3:05:38] down. So hope
[3:05:46] So now we had to exchange
[3:05:50] beds and a visitor come in between and
[3:05:52] hope goes
[3:05:55] down in all this. We thank
[3:05:59] God very good to
[3:06:01] us and uncle James that is going to
[3:06:04] become your
[3:06:08] life. Please just try to make sure your
[3:06:10] children have their bedroom.
[3:06:16] making that when there is food at least
[3:06:20] uh the babies have theirs and the
[3:06:22] visitors have
[3:06:26] theirs and we thank God that he didn't
[3:06:28] traumatize
[3:06:31] us but we got to know that this is dad's
[3:06:36] ministry and when God calls a man he
[3:06:38] calls him with his family
[3:06:43] We appreciate all of you for being here
[3:06:46] for us, for supporting daddy.
[3:06:51] One time we went for a mission with
[3:06:56] dad and uh the church was down. So, and
[3:07:00] then somewhere in the west and
[3:07:03] the the home where we're sleeping was on
[3:07:06] top of the hill.
[3:07:12] It had rained
[3:07:15] heavily. So we were walking
[3:07:18] up and then my daddy fell.
[3:07:23] And then I was like, "Oh my god, my
[3:07:24] daddy can also
[3:07:27] fall. That's not something I ever
[3:07:32] imagined." So he fell the second
[3:07:35] time and then I just started crying.
[3:07:39] And then he fell the third day. Oh, it
[3:07:42] was heartbreaking
[3:07:45] to see your hero just struggling
[3:07:48] to come
[3:07:49] up. This should not
[3:07:52] happen. But dad has traveled the whole
[3:07:56] nation for missionary
[3:07:59] work. We have seen God in his
[3:08:03] life, seen God in his ministry.
[3:08:07] If um there's a man I can show you who
[3:08:09] has stood for
[3:08:13] God, anything for God,
[3:08:18] it's our daddy.
[3:08:20] We really thank
[3:08:22] you so much for supporting his ministry.
[3:08:27] of you who came and stayed home, visited
[3:08:30] us while daddy was away
[3:08:35] on you brought home. We say thank
[3:08:39] you. Every other time you harvested food
[3:08:42] and it came to
[3:08:43] [Music]
[3:08:45] our food that came and we had to share
[3:08:48] it and we say thank you so much. May God
[3:08:51] richly bless you.
[3:08:56] May God bless the deacons, all the
[3:08:58] officials of the church.
[3:09:05] We pray that you support our the new
[3:09:11] pastor the way you supported our senior
[3:09:17] pastor. We pray that you hold his
[3:09:22] hands and may God richly bless you.
[3:09:39] Oh, okay. Thank you. The youth come and
[3:09:42] join.
[3:09:45] Thank you very much for those lovely
[3:09:48] words. I bear
[3:09:52] witness. The first time I went to
[3:09:54] pastor's
[3:09:57] home in
[3:10:00] here, I think it was
[3:10:03] 90 something.
[3:10:07] It was the first time I saw a home that
[3:10:09] is flooded with
[3:10:14] visitors. I've never seen that.
[3:10:18] midnight somebody's
[3:10:21] knocking coming in
[3:10:24] and they would have to prepare food for
[3:10:26] them.
[3:10:29] When I went back home, I thought, my
[3:10:31] goodness, what kind of home is
[3:10:33] this? The visas are
[3:10:36] endless. I've never seen that. And I
[3:10:38] wondered then I remember the comi.
[3:10:43] So finally at about a
[3:10:46] midnight uh about five ministers arrived
[3:10:50] at the same
[3:10:52] time. So these
[3:10:54] people got their bed
[3:10:57] sheets, went and slept in the comi
[3:11:02] because the ministers had to use their
[3:11:06] rooms. It was real and I wondered I
[3:11:09] really really wondered but growing
[3:11:12] up I never asked pastor about it.
[3:11:17] because I knew the obvious answer you
[3:11:18] would give
[3:11:20] me. I'm talking as I wait for the So
[3:11:22] when I was in the
[3:11:25] UK, I asked Pastor Oello
[3:11:29] and his wife.
[3:11:31] So I put that to them.
[3:11:35] I said I witnessed this, but is this
[3:11:38] what happened to you when you in Uganda
[3:11:39] as a
[3:11:43] pastor? Oh. So then the wife actually
[3:11:47] spoke looked at me just told me one
[3:11:51] thing said brother Peter
[3:11:54] I think some things was not right to do
[3:11:58] don't do
[3:12:00] that so by the grace of God when we were
[3:12:02] beginning to think of houses to
[3:12:06] build we had to think about minister
[3:12:10] rooms so that the children don't get
[3:12:16] inconvenienced because there are
[3:12:17] instances I
[3:12:22] know there are instances I
[3:12:26] know where actually some ministers
[3:12:28] children hated this
[3:12:32] message because they thought it was
[3:12:34] depriving them of anything
[3:12:39] good it's better now
[3:12:45] Welcome to give your
[3:12:53] speech. MC. Thank
[3:12:58] you. We want to thank
[3:13:02] everyone who has made this occasion very
[3:13:09] colorful as the youth.
[3:13:14] We've learned a lot from our precious
[3:13:20] pastor and I can testify that
[3:13:24] um no youth who has been under his
[3:13:32] guidance who has gone through his
[3:13:36] hands remains the same
[3:13:40] because of his guidance.
[3:13:45] spiritually and
[3:13:46] physically. Like many have
[3:13:50] testified, he's a pastor who wants to
[3:13:52] see his congregation better each and
[3:13:55] every
[3:13:58] day. Moving from glory and
[3:14:03] glory so that we can have a
[3:14:05] self-sustaining
[3:14:08] church. And that's the thing uh that has
[3:14:11] been inculcated in
[3:14:15] us that we stand as young people
[3:14:20] and we support the ministry
[3:14:24] and I want to appreciate you pastor.
[3:14:30] We thank you for all the words you've
[3:14:32] given unto
[3:14:35] us. I know your
[3:14:41] counel because you're still with us.
[3:14:45] And uh Pastor
[3:14:51] James, I don't I don't even know what to
[3:14:53] say,
[3:14:58] but you've been with us.
[3:15:02] Uh
[3:15:03] sometimes we come with our own foolish
[3:15:09] intentions and the excitement of the
[3:15:14] youth and you have a way you calm us
[3:15:19] down. Yeah. And some of us we think oh
[3:15:22] why did the pastor have to say
[3:15:26] that and we are like oh maybe we need to
[3:15:28] go back to senior pastor.
[3:15:32] We thank
[3:15:33] God for the way you're handling
[3:15:37] us. And this I promise you that behind
[3:15:41] you, we are going to work together with
[3:15:44] you because we are the church of
[3:15:47] tomorrow. Amen. Amen. I want to give
[3:15:50] brother Wilson to say a few
[3:15:56] words. Okay. God bless you all.
[3:16:01] It is such a blessed day for us to
[3:16:04] gather here
[3:16:07] together and witness the
[3:16:15] handover of pastoral to pastor
[3:16:19] [Music]
[3:16:21] James. And as young
[3:16:23] people, we are such a big group.
[3:16:28] Some are still here and they
[3:16:32] busy, but we are a representation of the
[3:16:35] rest of
[3:16:37] them. We want to say a few
[3:16:40] words to the ministry of
[3:16:45] pastoral. But before I say the words,
[3:16:49] uh the the deacon has a child
[3:16:54] here. Mother has disappeared kindly.
[3:16:59] come over here and pick your
[3:17:02] child. Thank you. So I want to say a few
[3:17:06] words on behalf of the
[3:17:10] youths. You know growing up under the
[3:17:14] ministry and teaching of
[3:17:19] pastoral has been the greatest treasure
[3:17:22] life could ever give to any young man
[3:17:24] growing up in this age.
[3:17:31] For we all know the generation we are
[3:17:34] living
[3:17:36] in such a challenging one for the young
[3:17:40] people. But getting the chance to sit
[3:17:44] under his
[3:17:47] teaching has been the bless the greatest
[3:17:50] blessing God could ever give to each one
[3:17:52] of us.
[3:17:56] We've heard the oldtimes say their
[3:18:02] testimonies and we also want to say that
[3:18:04] we have been so blessed by his
[3:18:08] teaching from pointing us to
[3:18:12] Christ and nurturing us in in the
[3:18:15] humility of the
[3:18:18] word. We appreciate you pastor for your
[3:18:22] sacrifices.
[3:18:26] with the young
[3:18:27] people. Want to appreciate you for the
[3:18:30] lifeless gift you've been to us.
[3:18:37] extending beyond the limits of a
[3:18:44] shepherd to uh to a
[3:18:48] parent of each one of
[3:18:51] us with a capacity to
[3:18:55] accommodate and transform so many of us
[3:18:58] from all walks of life.
[3:19:02] And get us to be numbered among the
[3:19:04] blessed.
[3:19:09] We appreciate you for
[3:19:12] that. And the best gift that we can ever
[3:19:14] give to you as the young
[3:19:18] people is to stand behind the ministry
[3:19:21] that you have labored
[3:19:25] for. Give it a
[3:19:29] continuity. As on behalf of the young
[3:19:32] people, we commit to support the
[3:19:34] ministry.
[3:19:40] in all
[3:19:43] aspects in the church and outside the
[3:19:47] church. Amen. Amen. And I want to appeal
[3:19:50] to all the young people
[3:19:53] here. We have seen a life
[3:19:58] lived. A man who has given up his life
[3:20:01] for the
[3:20:04] gospel. And now the best gift that we
[3:20:06] can give to
[3:20:09] him is when we also give our lives for
[3:20:12] the
[3:20:14] same and we commit to do
[3:20:18] it. And for pastor
[3:20:20] James to us he's not assuming office
[3:20:26] today. He has been our pastor, the youth
[3:20:31] pastor for the last 10
[3:20:34] years. Praise the Lord. He has visited
[3:20:38] us in our
[3:20:41] cubicles, when we are
[3:20:45] singles. He's always our first visitor
[3:20:47] when we
[3:20:50] marry. He has encouraged
[3:20:53] us. He has taught us. He has rebuked
[3:20:58] us. See, where need be, he brings a
[3:21:03] wiping and see, you know, because he's a
[3:21:06] father, we still love him. Because of
[3:21:10] his
[3:21:12] wiping, his
[3:21:14] instructions, we were able to see this
[3:21:17] group of young men standing before
[3:21:21] him. And we commit dear
[3:21:25] pastor to follow your
[3:21:28] teaching. We shall stand at our post of
[3:21:33] duty to bring this
[3:21:37] ministry to where God has ordained it to
[3:21:41] be. And we pray that God gives us the
[3:21:45] grace with
[3:21:48] humility to keep continuity of the
[3:21:50] message and the ministry that pastor has
[3:21:53] put
[3:21:59] forward for a very small
[3:22:02] gift. We have organized a few things
[3:22:05] that we can give to our pastor.
[3:22:12] things that are going to be placed in
[3:22:14] the
[3:22:16] office. We have a
[3:22:19] carpet such that it can decorate, you
[3:22:22] know, it can be at the
[3:22:27] floor. Then we have a
[3:22:30] fridge such that at least there is
[3:22:32] something cool for him to
[3:22:36] take. Then in case you need something
[3:22:39] warm, we have a
[3:22:43] kettle. And for
[3:22:45] now, in case it is hot,
[3:22:49] we've uh we've procured a
[3:22:53] fan, but we pledge in the
[3:22:57] future to have a better uh a better
[3:23:01] gadget, say um an S
[3:23:08] So very soon when the office is fully
[3:23:12] established, young people will ensure
[3:23:14] that everything is set out
[3:23:18] there so he can continue in the comfort
[3:23:21] of the ministry.
[3:23:26] one say God bless you
[3:23:29] all for blessing our
[3:23:32] pastors and for
[3:23:35] accepting the invitations to come and be
[3:23:37] part of us

[3:25:00] We'll bring our gifts as we go so that
[3:25:02] we have enough time to speak to them.
[3:25:04] But before that I would like to invite
[3:25:08] sister Martha Via to come and have one
[3:25:11] minute as pastor comes to cut his cake.
[3:25:14] Sister ma you're welcome. Why you will
[3:25:16] sing it? I don't know sing your speech
[3:25:18] or say something but uh
[3:25:22] yes you're welcome as the cake is being
[3:25:28] prepared to speak

[3:25:42] hands. Thank you
[3:25:45] Lord. Thank Thank you Lord.
[3:25:49] My God forneew
[3:25:52] me. My God ordained
[3:25:55] me
[3:25:59] predestin before the world was
[3:26:02] made. I am for
[3:26:06] him. God bless you saints.
[3:26:10] I'm so thankful for the ministry of
[3:26:12] brother.
[3:26:18] For it was through his
[3:26:21] ministry that I got
[3:26:24] children. I was barren for three
[3:26:28] years. But God spoke to him. It was on
[3:26:33] Friday. So the first time God spoke to
[3:26:38] him saying tell sister she's going to
[3:26:41] get a child.
[3:26:43] Then we could look at him while looking
[3:26:45] at the congregation thinking that maybe
[3:26:47] it is through the congregation that a
[3:26:48] person is
[3:26:52] speaking. Then the the second time again
[3:26:56] God told him you stop preaching and tell
[3:26:59] her that she's going to get a
[3:27:02] child. Then she could stop he could stop
[3:27:05] at once when he's preaching and look at
[3:27:07] the congregation thinking that voice is
[3:27:10] coming from the congregation.
[3:27:14] Then when God spoke through a very tough
[3:27:17] voice in the third
[3:27:20] time and he said, "Sister Ma, you are
[3:27:24] going to get a
[3:27:27] child but he couldn't understand himself
[3:27:31] because when we got out he sat on the
[3:27:34] floor as smart as he
[3:27:38] was and he said that please
[3:27:42] Don't say I was maybe um mocking
[3:27:47] you. I was hearing a very tough voice
[3:27:50] saying that I should say
[3:27:53] this. So I thank his
[3:27:56] ministry. It was through his ministry
[3:27:58] that I got
[3:27:59] children. May God bless you
[3:28:03] pastors. And I I think he's blessed
[3:28:06] because he knows how God speaks. If
[3:28:08] maybe this familiar voice comes again,
[3:28:12] you can hear it. God bless
[3:28:17] you. Amen. What a wonderful
[3:28:20] testimony. She's a mother of boys,
[3:28:25] five. They call her mommy
[3:28:28] girl. But that's what happened. It was a
[3:28:31] really inspiration to the pastor as he
[3:28:35] preached great and wonderful mighty
[3:28:37] blessings.
[3:28:38] [Music]
[3:28:40] So I uh choir where are you and us to
[3:28:43] sing for our pastor as he comes to cut
[3:28:45] this
[3:28:48] cake as pastor
[3:28:53] comes. Are we ready with the cake team?
[3:28:55] We're ready. That's right.

[3:29:08] comes

[3:29:15] and we lift your
[3:29:18] name. You are my
[3:29:22] sheer. You are my
[3:29:25] keeper who delivers me.
[3:29:29] from the evil
[3:29:32] hands. Thank you,
[3:29:35] Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[3:29:39] You never
[3:29:42] change. You never
[3:29:45] fail. You can't
[3:29:48] forsake me at this
[3:29:52] time. You are faithful.
[3:29:56] You remain the
[3:29:59] same
[3:30:02] yesterday, today, and forever.
[3:30:06] You are the Lord.
[3:30:09] Mommy, mommy, mommy,
[3:30:12] Lord. That's why we leave your name on
[3:30:18] high. That's why I sing.
[3:30:23] That's why
[3:30:24] [Music]
[3:30:46] I redeemer.
[3:30:48] [Music]
[3:30:58] [Music]
[3:31:06] who delivers
[3:31:08] me from evil
[3:31:12] hearts. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Uh
[3:31:16] no. Um, in the interest of time, I'll
[3:31:18] let pastor speak
[3:31:20] now. Do the cutting of the
[3:31:23] cake.
[3:31:25] Yes, God bless
[3:31:28] you. I'm very happy for the day.
[3:31:34] Uh I
[3:31:37] remember in the
[3:31:40] '9s a team came from
[3:31:44] Kenya and they were preaching the
[3:31:46] baptism of the Holy
[3:31:49] Spirit. I allowed the church to
[3:31:53] go but when they came
[3:31:56] back I saw there was a
[3:32:00] problem. So I took st of a perfect
[3:32:06] man to really bring what brother Brham
[3:32:10] told it.
[3:32:13] So while I was out
[3:32:18] there, what I
[3:32:21] spoke, I told Sister
[3:32:24] Ma, if what I'm preaching is the
[3:32:28] truth, nine months from
[3:32:31] now, you are going to have a son.
[3:32:36] 9 months the son
[3:32:43] came and now she tells
[3:32:46] me she has no
[3:32:49] daughters because I said
[3:32:51] [Music]
[3:32:53] son so it is sons who
[3:32:58] come we have seen the goodness of the
[3:33:03] lord and we are firm believers
[3:33:06] us of the power of the spoken
[3:33:10] word. The word of God works in
[3:33:16] humility. One time a sister was
[3:33:21] sick and we didn't know.
[3:33:25] She went to
[3:33:27] hospital and she
[3:33:29] was you know held.
[3:33:33] She was having a a a
[3:33:35] tumor at the end
[3:33:39] here and she was supposed to be
[3:33:43] operated but ministers
[3:33:47] know when you are going to
[3:33:50] preach. You don't want anything to cross
[3:33:52] your
[3:33:55] mind. So I made a prayer
[3:33:58] request that sister was going to be
[3:34:02] going to
[3:34:05] surgery. But my mind was preaching
[3:34:08] already, I said before the doctor
[3:34:11] touches
[3:34:13] her, let her be
[3:34:15] well. And we went
[3:34:17] on. And immediately at the time when I
[3:34:21] was starting to
[3:34:23] preach that's when the doctor was
[3:34:25] supposed to do the
[3:34:28] surgery looked for the
[3:34:31] tumor and it was not
[3:34:35] there. It was totally
[3:34:38] gone. So this old sister
[3:34:41] says give me a
[3:34:45] certification that a miracle has
[3:34:47] happened.
[3:34:49] The man
[3:34:50] refused and he says I don't know but I
[3:34:54] will operate this thing
[3:34:57] sometime. Up to this time the surgery
[3:35:01] has not taken
[3:35:05] place
[3:35:07] sometimes when God does certain
[3:35:12] things you know he does them in such a
[3:35:16] simplicity.
[3:35:20] that you know you will not even if you
[3:35:23] are not
[3:35:25] spiritual you'll doubt what God has
[3:35:27] done.
[3:35:32] So one time
[3:35:35] we
[3:35:37] know
[3:35:38] brother
[3:35:41] David who is uh the chairman of
[3:35:45] board his wife started getting
[3:35:49] sick and she went for
[3:35:52] autopsy and they told her that she had
[3:35:55] cancer on the breast.
[3:36:00] She was just a young
[3:36:02] girl, a
[3:36:04] teacher and she was going to lose a
[3:36:08] breast. She came to me. She was crying.
[3:36:12] We remembered what God told brother
[3:36:16] Brham in the case of sister
[3:36:19] Mida when you know he was praying. He
[3:36:24] said she washed my clothes. She looked
[3:36:27] for the after the children while I was
[3:36:29] gone and just put forward whatever she
[3:36:33] was a benefit to the ministry of brother
[3:36:39] Brham. And one time the prophet I mean
[3:36:42] God told her told
[3:36:44] him speak the
[3:36:47] word. And when he spoke he says before
[3:36:50] the doctor touches
[3:36:53] her. So I told
[3:36:56] sister that you see before you
[3:36:59] married you were the young girls who
[3:37:01] were singing around
[3:37:03] here but when you got married it is
[3:37:08] gone. I said you know you need to bring
[3:37:13] back reason and
[3:37:15] purpose why God should heal you.
[3:37:20] So she started coming
[3:37:22] back. She would sing and she would cry.
[3:37:27] But when the time which was given to
[3:37:31] her to go for the surgery, the cancer
[3:37:36] disappeared up to
[3:37:40] now. So many
[3:37:42] things they happen in
[3:37:45] simplicity without falling on the floor.
[3:37:51] is always
[3:37:53] God. So I want to appreciate you
[3:37:56] all for coming to be with
[3:37:59] us. I pray that the Lord may greatly
[3:38:02] bless
[3:38:04] you and as uh you know pastor Kamat
[3:38:10] said it's just a matter of understanding
[3:38:14] right what has
[3:38:16] happened. I didn't say I will never
[3:38:20] preach. I'm still a preacher. That's why
[3:38:23] he said he has retired. He's not
[3:38:27] tired. So I pray that you may pray for
[3:38:30] my other
[3:38:34] phase that after this the good Lord will
[3:38:39] give me grace to go where the
[3:38:43] gift will be
[3:38:46] needed. And you see the gift can only
[3:38:50] work where the doors are
[3:38:52] open. That's the way God works. He told
[3:38:56] the prophet. If you can get the people
[3:38:59] to believe you, nothing can stop I mean
[3:39:02] can you
[3:39:04] know nothing can uh stand before
[3:39:07] you and not even
[3:39:10] cancel. So it's the same
[3:39:13] principle for our gifts. They'll always
[3:39:17] work where they are
[3:39:19] accepted. I appreciate you. Thank you so
[3:39:23] much for coming,
[3:39:27] brother. All of you,
[3:39:30] brother. God bless you so much. We've
[3:39:34] been all over the place and God has
[3:39:37] blessed us. Amen. Amen. I remember
[3:39:41] years when there were no
[3:39:43] cars and we could go to preach the
[3:39:47] gospel. You know the people from West
[3:39:53] Ni, they should have been here. Amen. It
[3:39:58] was very difficult when we started out
[3:40:01] there. And one day we were going with a
[3:40:05] bicycle with brother
[3:40:07] Godfrey who is now in
[3:40:10] glory. And what happened is that it got
[3:40:16] punctured and then we had to
[3:40:19] walk a
[3:40:22] distance over 30
[3:40:26] kilometers to reach the place where
[3:40:29] we're
[3:40:30] going. And part of that
[3:40:33] place is a game
[3:40:37] park. The Lord has always been
[3:40:40] gracious. If the Lord sends you, he goes
[3:40:44] with you. God bless you. Thank you for
[3:40:49] coming. And uh brother
[3:40:52] Jion asked the brother to come and
[3:40:54] represent him
[3:40:56] here. And we just want to appreciate
[3:40:59] you, brother.
[3:41:01] God bless you so much. Amen. Pastor,
[3:41:05] where are
[3:41:07] you? Where are you?
[3:41:11] You
[3:41:15] come. Praise the
[3:41:17] Lord. This man
[3:41:19] here is part of
[3:41:22] us. He
[3:41:27] always want to hear him call me again.
[3:41:36] I appreciate you my pastor.
[3:41:42] May God bless you
[3:41:45] brethren. I also thank
[3:41:50] God for the ministry that he put in our
[3:41:55] pastor which has been so exemplary to
[3:41:57] us.
[3:41:59] He has really nurtured
[3:42:02] us. We've learned many things from
[3:42:08] him. We've got the courage to
[3:42:12] serve our God through his
[3:42:15] ministry in a ministry of
[3:42:18] simplicity. Our pastor, may the Lord
[3:42:21] bless
[3:42:22] you in the name of our Lord
[3:42:25] Jesus. And I want to appreciate God.
[3:42:31] give us our pastor, our elder, our
[3:42:35] pastor. In
[3:42:37] fact, we feel so
[3:42:40] happy whenever we know that he's there.
[3:42:44] He's very
[3:42:45] safe. That's our
[3:42:47] joy. And we
[3:42:51] also that we are behind you in
[3:42:55] everything. In all things we are behind
[3:42:57] you our pastor.
[3:43:03] I remember that I got the message from
[3:43:05] the sister peace
[3:43:12] and she told me that our pastor will be
[3:43:14] handing
[3:43:20] over. I was invited in a
[3:43:24] meeting
[3:43:28] at he invited he had invited me to go
[3:43:31] and minister in that
[3:43:34] convention but because of this
[3:43:39] reason I told him you have invited me
[3:43:41] but I'll spend there two days only
[3:43:43] Friday Friday and Saturday on
[3:43:48] Sunday I was invited at
[3:43:52] That's where I will
[3:43:55] be for sure. We left there
[3:43:58] night after
[3:44:00] ministering and we
[3:44:05] drove we reached in Ginger at 4 in in
[3:44:09] the
[3:44:11] morning. 4:30 in the
[3:44:14] morning in the morning when it is a
[3:44:16] breaking day. Amen. Amen.
[3:44:19] [Music]
[3:44:22] Then we started struggling to get where
[3:44:24] we can take
[3:44:26] care. And God did us
[3:44:32] well because we saw a that was behind
[3:44:35] us when we were in the town of
[3:44:38] Ginger where we parked.
[3:44:41] It also parked in front of
[3:44:45] us and the man came out and said that
[3:44:48] you have a flat
[3:44:49] tire at
[3:44:51] night. We said, "Oh, our
[3:44:54] Lord to come
[3:44:57] out." Our tire was really
[3:45:01] flattened. But that God who reaching
[3:45:06] grace that we that front car had a
[3:45:10] mechanic
[3:45:12] The one that was following
[3:45:13] us, it
[3:45:19] was the big man said, "You come out and
[3:45:22] save these
[3:45:24] people and they helped
[3:45:26] us. They entered this
[3:45:29] one and they prepared for us the spare
[3:45:33] tire. We requested them to lead us where
[3:45:36] the hotel is and they led us. They took
[3:45:41] us. But we didn't know them. They didn't
[3:45:44] know us. We've never seen them. They had
[3:45:48] never seen
[3:45:49] us. That's the grace that the Lord did
[3:45:52] for
[3:45:54] us. Now we sleep at
[3:45:57] 5 in the
[3:45:59] morning and we woke
[3:46:01] up. After the
[3:46:04] breakfast, we came in the
[3:46:06] service. We thank God.
[3:46:09] Thank our
[3:46:13] pastor God for God to inspire him to get
[3:46:17] for
[3:46:18] us. Praise in the name of the
[3:46:23] father. If you ask me some of the
[3:46:26] pastors who are very
[3:46:27] humble in this this
[3:46:31] country, I see that our pastor.
[3:46:35] Yeah. He got a photo copy.

[3:46:41] Lord. He's very
