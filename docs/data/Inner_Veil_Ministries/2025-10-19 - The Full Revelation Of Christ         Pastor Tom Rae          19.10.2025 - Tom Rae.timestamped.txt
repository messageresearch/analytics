[31:52] [Music]
[32:02] One day.
[32:06] [Music]
[33:01] Life can have so many
[33:06] [Music]
[33:10] stand
[33:11] [Music]
[33:13] and Pharaoh is bearing down.
[33:17] I have no more to flee across. So I
[33:22] raise this hand of faith and I cry out,
[33:27] "Oh Lord, remember me
[33:31] [Music]
[33:33] when I'm down in the valley. Lord
[33:37] remember losing my way.
[33:41] I'm down on my knees,
[33:45] Lord. Lord. Oh Lord, remember me.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; When I'm down in the valley,
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember
[33:59] my way.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Remember I'm down on my knees,
[34:05] Lord.
[34:08] Oh Lord, remember me.
[34:13] [Music]
[34:14] Sometimes I take the wrong road and I
[34:19] let the devil know
[34:22] that when you cut my prayer, I'm as
[34:27] powerless as any man. And like Samson in
[34:32] the dancing,
[34:34] I'm blinded
[34:36] and scared.
[34:38] But I still cry out, "Lord, remember me.
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] When I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[34:49] &gt;&gt; remember
[34:51] my way.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; I'm down on my knees,
[34:57] Lord.
[34:59] Oh Lord, remember me.
[35:06] Like h in the temple.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember us.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Will you be blessed? Lord remember to
[35:14] live in a foreign distant land.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord remember me.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord
[35:26] the three
[35:29] remember
[35:30] in the dead of life.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Lord remembering
[35:36] the money Lord.
[35:39] Oh Lord, remember me.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, when I'm down in the valley,
[35:47] Lord,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; remembering
[35:50] my way.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember down on my knees,
[35:56] Lord.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, remember me.
[36:05] Like the thief on the cross,
[36:08] I'm at the end of my road.
[36:12] But I know within my heart that my soul
[36:17] is a part of you.
[36:20] When the moon was there.
[36:24] When the stars of the morning sun.
[36:28] When you come into your kingom. Remember
[36:33] me
[36:34] [Music]
[36:36] like that thief on the cross.
[36:40] I'm at the end of my room.
[36:44] But I know within my heart that my soul
[36:49] is a part of you.
[36:52] I know that time was there
[36:56] when the stars of the morning sun.
[37:00] So when you come into your kingdom,
[37:03] remember me.
[37:06] Oh, when I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[37:11] remember
[37:12] &gt;&gt; losing my way.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, remember
[37:17] on my knees,
[37:19] Lord.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, remember me.
[37:28] like in the temple.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Lord remember
[37:33] you blessed me.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Lord remember the thing that God loves
[37:38] for a land.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord remember me
[37:48] like the three Hebrew children. Lord
[37:52] remember
[37:54] the day of life. Lord remembering
[37:59] God's harmon.
[38:00] [Music]
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord remember me
[38:08] &gt;&gt; when I'm down in the valley. Lord
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Lord remember me.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Sing my way.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Lord remember
[38:18] my knees
[38:20] Lord.
[38:23] Oh Lord, remember me.
[38:39] Do we have the same cry this morning?
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me.
[38:46] Amen.
[38:48] Like the thief on the cross,
[38:52] just at the last minute,
[38:54] he realized
[38:56] &gt;&gt; that his name was on the love's book of
[38:59] life.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; God
[39:08] caused that man said the right thing.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; So we are certainly happy to be here.
[39:17] Are you happy to be in the presence of
[39:19] the Lord?
[39:22] Amen.
[39:23] We are very blessed people.
[39:28] Amen. When I say blessed,
[39:31] I mean blessed.
[39:35] Amen.
[39:37] Uh to have brother Tom Ray with us.
[39:43] [Applause]
[39:47] I've known brother Tom
[39:51] for almost 40 years.
[39:54] [Applause]
[39:58] One thing about me is I never lose
[40:01] friends.
[40:05] If you lose a friend,
[40:07] you've lost something.
[40:09] But if you gain you keep a friend,
[40:13] you got everything that that friend is.
[40:19] So we have everything that brother Tom
[40:22] is this morning.
[40:28] Amen. Just keep opening up the different
[40:31] tabs.
[40:34] Amen. Amen. and every point
[40:38] you will see a divine flow.
[40:42] Amen. Amen. So, uh he has proved to be
[40:46] steady ministry
[40:51] over years.
[40:54] He solidly stood behind his pastor
[41:00] for over 50 years
[41:04] before the Lord took brother Ed Bisco.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; I tell you that's being solid.
[41:16] Praise the Lord.
[41:18] Amen. That's the dove leading the eagle.
[41:24] That ego could be fast,
[41:28] but he has to restrain himself.
[41:32] Amen.
[41:35] Could have run a little bit ahead,
[41:40] but he had that real anointing
[41:45] of the eagle that obeys the dove.
[41:51] Amen. God bless you, brother Tom.
[41:54] [Applause]
[41:56] Now he's the pastor
[41:59] of the work
[42:01] of Glodale Bible in Canada.
[42:08] All this work you see
[42:13] is this.
[42:20] Pastor Tim.
[42:22] [Music]
[42:26] Amen.
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:45] [Applause]
[42:48] So he's the man that has been standing
[42:50] behind all this work.
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:54] [Music]
[42:56] [Applause]
[43:00] for making time to come and be with us.
[43:06] We should value this
[43:09] [Applause]
[43:11] because his pastor just changed
[43:13] dimension the other day.
[43:16] [Music]
[43:19] He has just passed on to do with the
[43:21] Lord
[43:23] I think two three weeks ago.
[43:27] Amen. That's where the funeral service
[43:30] and everything were done.
[43:34] It takes somebody to love you.
[43:38] [Applause]

[48:06] prayer.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father
[48:18] is precious.
[48:22] sacrifice they made to me in the house
[48:24] of God this morning.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a humble man.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Humbled by their graciousness,
[48:35] [Music]
[48:37] humbled by their lives.
[48:43] Lord, could you take the bread this
[48:45] morning
[48:47] [Music]
[48:49] and we could have communion with Melzdc
[48:55] that you could feed our hungry souls,
[49:00] inspire our hearts
[49:03] to see only Jesus
[49:06] Christ.
[49:10] Lord, I just pray and commit now this
[49:12] morning service to you
[49:17] that thy will be done
[49:20] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[49:23] Amen. Amen.
[49:27] Good morning. Why don't you have your
[49:28] seats?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful to be here with you.
[49:36] As our dear pastor has mentioned,
[49:43] we have known each other for a few
[49:44] years.
[49:47] [Music]
[49:48] boring or it is over
[49:53] &gt;&gt; and I
[49:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not a person
[49:59] that must be seen or heard preaching,
[50:05] but I realize the quality of men of God
[50:07] that God has given me.
[50:13] And you'll never know what you have
[50:18] &gt;&gt; until you don't have it.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And I would like to give a rose to our
[50:24] our precious brother, Pastor Steven.
[50:29] [Applause]
[50:37] Another whenever our dear brother has
[50:40] been our way.
[50:43] And I can't can honestly say
[50:49] I know Jesus in a better way.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That's very important.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; It's not to know about the message.
[51:01] It's to know him who is the message.
[51:04] [Music]
[51:07] And so I thank
[51:09] the quality
[51:11] of the word of God
[51:14] that our precious brother
[51:19] these many many years.
[51:23] And I want to thank the Lord Jesus.
[51:28] We often say at Cloverdale,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Visll said it
[51:38] When we hear men of God such as
[51:41] pastoral,
[51:46] &gt;&gt; he said Africa doesn't need
[51:47] missionaries.
[51:51] Africa does not need missionaries.
[51:56] America needs missionaries.
[51:59] And by the grace of God, you've sent a
[52:01] missionary to Cloverdale Bible.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And I I'm not a flowery type of guy.
[52:16] But I
[52:19] &gt;&gt; But I mean that from the depths of my
[52:20] heart.
[52:24] We are privileged
[52:28] to walk with such caliber
[52:32] to meet
[52:34] is a great honor.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And thus here we are.
[52:41] It took 40 years and we're here.
[52:45] In fact, I know the first time we ever
[52:46] had a meeting with a brother Steven
[52:48] realizes it or remembers it.
[52:54] We were sitting in our little hotel room
[52:58] and it was a missions meeting with
[53:01] brother Harold
[53:05] &gt;&gt; and that's the year I met brother Tim
[53:10] &gt;&gt; and brother Steven
[53:12] and they both are my best friends today.
[53:18] Amen.
[53:20] So we remember those times and he says
[53:22] why don't you come to Uganda
[53:28] &gt;&gt; brother Steven is shooting the big big
[53:31] gun
[53:34] shooting I was shooting
[53:37] [Music]
[53:40] big gun
[53:42] I was shooting a peashooter
[53:47] I'm still shooting a peashooter
[53:51] But we feel it dee and deem it a great
[53:54] honor to have my son Michael Ray with
[53:55] me.
[53:58] [Applause]
[54:00] [Music]
[54:02] I don't mean this in a derogatory way at
[54:04] all
[54:08] because I always felt honored
[54:11] he introduced as brother Biscoll's
[54:12] son-in-law.
[54:18] Not not brother Tom Ray.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Not
[54:22] &gt;&gt; not brother Tom. It was brother Tom Ray
[54:25] &gt;&gt; is brother Eddie Bisco's son-in-law.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Now
[54:35] I'm brother Michael's daddy.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; He's he's a great preacher. Oh,
[54:45] [Music]
[54:47] amen. And I feel honored to have my dear
[54:49] son.
[54:53] This is special. I'm going to drink it
[54:54] in if that's okay.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; I've heard about you.
[55:00] I've seen you on video.
[55:02] I've heard the reports of Brother Tim
[55:04] do.
[55:08] And over the years,
[55:11] all I've done is heard.
[55:13] [Music]
[55:14] But by the grace of God, I stand here.
[55:18] I can read the message.
[55:20] I have heard,
[55:22] &gt;&gt; but now I see.
[55:24] Amen. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And that that is a reality.
[55:30] I I would love just to have you all
[55:32] around me
[55:36] and hear each one's testimony
[55:41] of how God
[55:44] came into your life
[55:47] and I always say if God had not sent a
[55:51] messenger,
[55:53] we would never have met.
[55:56] It's it's true.
[55:59] I wouldn't I've known your pastor
[56:02] &gt;&gt; and now new pastor.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have met you.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Said, "Behold,
[56:10] send you."
[56:14] Amen. So God sent me Elijah.
[56:18] I can meet you,
[56:21] a part of my body.
[56:25] And I give God the glory this morning.
[56:29] that we could be together.
[56:32] We were once together in the thoughts of
[56:34] God,
[56:36] but now this season has come for the
[56:40] manifestation of the
[56:43] day. That scripture has been fulfilled.
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:49] This day is the manifestation
[56:53] of the sons of God. Not knowing the
[56:56] message
[56:57] Jesus Christ
[56:59] who is the message and that's why our
[57:02] burden is to get this message
[57:06] &gt;&gt; into your hands so that you can realize
[57:09] who you are in Christ.
[57:12] The opening of the seals,
[57:16] the opening of the seals
[57:19] was the very vehicle God used
[57:24] your name.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:30] Amen. Bless be the tithe that binds.
[57:33] [Applause]
[57:37] It's the blood
[57:41] that ties us together
[57:44] to God be the glory this morning,
[57:48] saints of God,
[57:50] his love and mercy to us. Amen.
[57:53] Again, I I I'm so thankful
[57:57] we've had this time.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; And so, if you don't mind, we'll stand.
[58:04] I must bring greetings from my wife,
[58:05] sister Joanne.
[58:11] Sorry,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; she loves sister Sarah.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; She said, "Am I coming?"
[58:18] &gt;&gt; I said, "No, honey.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; This is a quick trip.
[58:23] But one day,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; sister Sarah Sarah,
[58:26] &gt;&gt; if we can have the blessing to sit at
[58:28] your table,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; that will be a great day.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; So, if you would uh turn please to
[58:38] Matthew.
[58:41] I'm
[58:41] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you to turn to Matthew 16.
[58:49] Is everybody okay?
[58:52] I now I'm looking way in the back. Is
[58:54] everybody in the back? All right.
[59:00] Matthew 16 verse 13.
[59:06] Such a simple scripture.
[59:09] Such a profound scripture.
[59:13] Without this scripture,
[59:16] there's no church.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; There's no church.
[59:21] All right, let's take a look at it.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Matthew 16:13.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came into the coast of
[59:29] Cesariah, Philippi, he asked his
[59:32] disciples, saying, "Who do men say that
[59:35] I, the son of man, am?
[59:42] [Music]
[59:50] And they said, "Some say thou are John
[59:53] the Baptist, some Elias, others Jeremiah
[59:56] or one of the prophets."
[1:00:07] Here is a key scripture. Amen. He said
[1:00:11] unto them, "To whom say ye that I am?"
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Could you please read that with brother
[1:00:26] Emanuel?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; That's very, very key.
[1:00:37] And Simon Peter answered and said unto
[1:00:39] him, "Thou art the Christ."
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's key,
[1:00:50] the son,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:00:58] And James answered, I'm sorry, and Jesus
[1:01:01] answered
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; and said unto him, "Blessed art thou,
[1:01:06] Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath
[1:01:10] not revealed this unto you, but my
[1:01:13] father which is in heaven.
[1:01:29] And I say unto thee, thou art Peter,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; and upon this rock
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; will I build my church, and the gates of
[1:01:38] hell shall not prevail against it.
[1:01:52] Let's bow our heads, please.
[1:01:54] Heavenly Father,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; we've read your word. Now, would you
[1:01:58] bring the revelation of that word
[1:02:03] into our hearts this morning
[1:02:06] as we approach you?
[1:02:09] Would you make it real to each and
[1:02:10] everyone
[1:02:13] saved
[1:02:15] by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:17] saved?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll reveal yourself to them.
[1:02:22] Ask it in Jesus name.
[1:02:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may have
[1:02:27] your seats. God bless you. I'd like to
[1:02:30] read a quote that I have been using over
[1:02:34] the last little while
[1:02:38] and it's out of the revelation of Jesus
[1:02:40] Christ.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said there is nothing of
[1:02:45] such prevailing power
[1:02:49] revelation of the word.
[1:02:54] And now I want you to just concentrate
[1:02:56] now on
[1:03:00] There's and I'll say I want to say it
[1:03:02] exactly how he said it.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; He said it's that simple.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; There is nothing of such prevailing
[1:03:12] power
[1:03:13] [Music]
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; as a revelation of the word.
[1:03:20] Now we all sit here today
[1:03:23] by the revelation of the word.
[1:03:27] Is this not true?
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Is this not true?
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You're not here because you're getting a
[1:03:34] hand out.
[1:03:38] You're not here that somebody can better
[1:03:39] your life.
[1:03:42] You are here because Jesus Christ has
[1:03:46] allowed revelation to come your way. So
[1:03:50] that you can realize
[1:03:52] you can realize
[1:03:54] realize who you are in the word and to
[1:04:00] have that realization
[1:04:05] is great power.
[1:04:08] Now I know we we'll get into it. I'm
[1:04:11] sorry I move around but I'm I'm not
[1:04:14] stately like brother Steven.
[1:04:20] Every time brothers pastor Ivali Iwali
[1:04:24] preaches at Cloverdale,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; he stands here so nice
[1:04:32] and every word has a meaning
[1:04:37] and I look at that.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I say someday
[1:04:41] I might be able to do that.
[1:04:45] So I'm I'm you know when unless I'm
[1:04:48] digressing right now
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; so everybody understands there's
[1:04:54] different kinds of preachers
[1:04:59] when the wise men brought gifts to
[1:05:02] Jesus.
[1:05:04] One brought gold,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; frankincense and myrr.
[1:05:13] caught to revelation
[1:05:16] that he's gold.
[1:05:18] He's deity.
[1:05:20] He's almighty God.
[1:05:23] And that that wise man when he goes
[1:05:27] home, he preaches on the deity of Christ
[1:05:32] because that's all he sees.
[1:05:35] Then he'll veer into frankincense
[1:05:39] and he'll veer veer into myrr.
[1:05:42] But he comes back to deal.
[1:05:45] He comes back to deal
[1:05:47] because he sees gold.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; So now the other uh wise man
[1:05:53] frankincense,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; we got to serve God's people. We got to
[1:05:59] serve him.
[1:06:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; And then he might go over to gold.
[1:06:10] He's the deity of God. He's a man of
[1:06:13] God. He's the alpha God. But let's serve
[1:06:17] God.
[1:06:19] Let's serve him.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; That's the my
[1:06:25] gold. I'm sorry. Frankincense.
[1:06:29] That was service.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And now the brother got a revelation.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Gold, frankincense, and myrr. Oh,
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:39] you got to die.
[1:06:41] You got an evangelistic experience.
[1:06:44] Die yourself
[1:06:47] needs to have a real dying.
[1:06:51] He'll go to gold. He'll go to my but his
[1:06:55] whole thing.
[1:06:59] But now we've come to a time where gold
[1:07:02] and frankincense and myrr are one.
[1:07:06] will speak on the soul. Speak on the
[1:07:09] dying,
[1:07:11] but each one has their revelation.
[1:07:16] No such prevailing power. Not such.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what he said.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the pre prevailing power.
[1:07:33] One saw gold, one saw frankincense, one
[1:07:36] saw myrr.
[1:07:40] All together is a revelation of who
[1:07:44] Christ is
[1:07:46] God put in the church,
[1:07:49] prophets, evangelists, pastors,
[1:07:53] teachers. What is that all for?
[1:07:56] Build you up
[1:07:59] to the faith.
[1:08:01] come into the unity.
[1:08:05] So I'm not here to speak speak on
[1:08:07] anything different than you've already
[1:08:08] heard.
[1:08:12] Brothers Ibali might speak on gold
[1:08:17] and I might be on frankincense.
[1:08:20] But I'll speak by the grace of God
[1:08:24] on the full revelation.
[1:08:26] All right. Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory this morning. We are
[1:08:31] the redeemed of almighty God.
[1:08:35] The almighty God himself
[1:08:38] body
[1:08:40] came down in the body died on the cross
[1:08:44] so that you and I
[1:08:47] could be redeemed.
[1:08:49] Without the blood we're nothing.
[1:08:53] And that's why at the end of the son of
[1:08:56] man ministry
[1:08:59] is the bleeding
[1:09:04] because it's the bloody word.
[1:09:10] Say with me, you are cleansed from every
[1:09:12] sin.
[1:09:20] Amen. Amen. God cleanse you.
[1:09:24] washed you,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; forgave you.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; You had nothing to do with it.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; You had nothing to do with it.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It was the word coming to you.
[1:09:39] No different
[1:09:42] going to the well.
[1:09:44] No different than Jesus going to Jericho
[1:09:48] blind man
[1:09:51] said in the rising of the sun. He said
[1:09:55] it was the resurrection that came by
[1:09:56] your way.
[1:10:00] Can I say to you this morning that
[1:10:02] you're being resurrected
[1:10:06] at another place
[1:10:08] said he said the resur resurrection has
[1:10:11] already started.
[1:10:14] Why? He called you
[1:10:17] to the end of the ages
[1:10:23] and they without us
[1:10:26] be made perfect.
[1:10:29] Hallelujah. Think how important you are.
[1:10:34] You have to see how important you are.
[1:10:39] You are the bride of Christ.
[1:10:42] You're not a church member.
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You're the queen. I'm the king.
[1:10:55] Like it.
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:02] Hallelujah.
[1:11:04] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not enthused about this.
[1:11:10] With with revelation comes stimulation.
[1:11:14] If God's made it real to you,
[1:11:18] there's something sticking.
[1:11:21] It's not a dead church.
[1:11:24] It's a living body.
[1:11:26] It's an organism.
[1:11:30] Hallelujah.
[1:11:32] To God be the glory.
[1:11:36] Revelation's important.
[1:11:38] And I'm laying a trap.
[1:11:41] I like laying traps.
[1:11:46] Yeah, it's very important because you
[1:11:48] have to realize brother said in Christ
[1:11:52] God reveals.
[1:11:55] He says when a bride realizes who she
[1:11:57] is,
[1:11:59] then we're out of here.
[1:12:01] We're out of here.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; We're gone.
[1:12:06] But she will. that and that's why we
[1:12:09] preach.
[1:12:10] We're not preaching to get numbers.
[1:12:14] We're preaching to get the last seed.
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] We want God's seed.
[1:12:25] That's why Jesus
[1:12:31] Jesus
[1:12:32] went throughout Israel.
[1:12:35] Matthew, come.
[1:12:37] Matthew.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Matthew.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Look at you.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Not him.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He's a tax collector.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; He works for the room.
[1:12:50] Come, master.
[1:12:52] Come.
[1:12:54] God didn't see the flesh.
[1:12:58] God sees the seed.
[1:13:03] We all fail in the flesh.
[1:13:06] But you've never made a mistake.
[1:13:10] You are the virtuous.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Right of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And if you can't rejoice over that,
[1:13:18] nothing can happen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you can't rejoice over that.
[1:13:24] Hallelujah.
[1:13:33] Amen.
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:13:40] You don't know what I was like
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; and I don't know what you were like
[1:13:47] God can save me
[1:13:49] and this message could hold me.
[1:13:52] This message could direct me.
[1:13:55] He can do it to you.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we said yesterday, I've done
[1:14:03] the Freddy's He's got saving powering
[1:14:08] power.
[1:14:10] Amen. And holding power
[1:14:16] kept by the power of God.
[1:14:21] Not a mental,
[1:14:23] not mental
[1:14:25] heart.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Give me your heart.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Don't give me your mind. Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And now I'm we all have a different
[1:14:41] delivery,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; but I like looking at who I'm preaching
[1:14:48] to.
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:15:01] Huh?
[1:15:03] You know, eagle people play into a
[1:15:06] soccer
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:13] or they go to cricket.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; They play cricket.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; That's the best.
[1:15:21] Come to church.
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; This is greater than any demon power.
[1:15:31] Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brown said,
[1:15:47] "Don't jump any higher than you're
[1:15:49] living."
[1:15:53] So, so if you are like this,
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; you're not living.
[1:15:59] But when you get like this,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; that's tremendous.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] He's born again.
[1:16:13] [Applause]
[1:16:18] Glory.
[1:16:23] [Applause]
[1:16:34] Oh my
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother James.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Oh why at least smile.
[1:16:42] [Applause]
[1:16:47] This is the greatest.
[1:16:50] He is the Almighty.
[1:16:53] Whenever
[1:16:55] two or three are gathered,
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; I will be in their midst.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; I just listened to brother Brand
[1:17:04] morning. Sorry. I listened to Brother
[1:17:06] Brand yesterday.
[1:17:09] He says, "There's thousands of angels in
[1:17:11] this building."
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:16] Come on. Come on.
[1:17:18] It's not a story. It's a reality.
[1:17:26] Catch it.
[1:17:28] You're just about over the finish line.
[1:17:32] Keep running.
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:41] Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I'm an old man.
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; I was told I was a very, very old man.
[1:17:56] Hey,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; but you know,
[1:17:59] I am what I am.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; I was this way at 21.
[1:18:05] I'm this way at 51.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; I was this way at 71.
[1:18:14] This is what I am. So, as I said
[1:18:17] yesterday,
[1:18:19] when you get over into glory,
[1:18:23] you're going to see somebody jumping,
[1:18:26] praising,
[1:18:28] glorifying
[1:18:30] because I know what I was.
[1:18:32] [Applause]
[1:18:36] Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We made it.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; We made it.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It comes from God. We're
[1:18:44] going back to God. We made it.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Hey, tell the devil.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; he's a liar.
[1:18:58] [Applause]
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; I want to hear it.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Devil, you're a liar.
[1:19:07] [Applause]
[1:19:08] and you're under my feet.
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; It's not a thought.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[1:19:20] When I had three boys
[1:19:23] for them, prayed for them. We wanted
[1:19:27] them not to be good, rich young rulers.
[1:19:32] Good boy. Come to church. Good boy. We
[1:19:37] wanted them filled with the fire of God.
[1:19:41] And I can say to you today
[1:19:44] God be the glory. Nothing we have done.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven knows my family.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; We have a big family now.
[1:19:54] We're all serving God.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So if he does it for me,
[1:20:01] how about you?
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; God's no respector of persons.
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] If he saved me,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; he can save you.
[1:20:12] He gave me a wife, he can give you
[1:20:14] brothers a wife.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; That That's That was free and bonus.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know who's married or not.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; But God has got the right one for you.
[1:20:25] Oh.
[1:20:29] [Applause]
[1:20:31] Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me so far?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz I got to watch the clock.
[1:20:44] We got about 45 minutes left.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; So, you help me preach fast.
[1:20:50] Turn to Genesis 1.
[1:21:00] Glory.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Why can't we enjoy ourselves?
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Why can't we enjoy church?
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You've walked a long way.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You spent a lot of money to come to
[1:21:13] church with you guys.
[1:21:17] We're here to enjoy
[1:21:20] God's presence.
[1:21:22] Amen. Amen. come to enjoy the word of
[1:21:25] God as in our heart.
[1:21:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to take you to Genesis
[1:21:32] 1:1.
[1:21:34] Genesis 1:1 says,
[1:21:37] "In the beginning,
[1:21:40] God created the heaven and the earth."
[1:21:47] Have you got that?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Almighty
[1:21:51] God,
[1:21:54] Elohim,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Elohim,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; the Alpha, the Omega,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; created.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; In the beginning,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; God created
[1:22:07] the heavens and the earth.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Genesis
[1:22:15] 6,000 years ago.
[1:22:21] I'm talking about your earth.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:26] I God created
[1:22:31] and earth
[1:22:39] God created you.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Now just remember something here.
[1:22:44] And here we go off in another
[1:22:48] when when Joseph Joseph
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; was given the place of Pharaoh,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; God gave him a dream
[1:23:00] and he's to store up food.
[1:23:04] Was that food for Egypt
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; or was it for Jacob
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; and his brothers?
[1:23:14] God cares less about serpency.
[1:23:17] Oh,
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; just a second.
[1:23:21] He doesn't care about serpency.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; He only cares about his.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there was a storehouse,
[1:23:34] a storehouse,
[1:23:36] not for Egypt,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; but for Jacob,
[1:23:41] Judah, Simeon, Napali Dan.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; God had them in mind.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; God has you in mind. Jose a storehouse.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; A storehouse.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Not for the world.
[1:23:58] I'm so sorry.
[1:24:00] [Applause]
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:28] Glory.
[1:24:29] It's for you.
[1:24:32] We have a burden.
[1:24:34] Message into the hands of his people.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Serpency got into my hand.
[1:24:45] and long hair
[1:24:48] blonde.
[1:24:49] Blonde, by the way,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; blonde.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Blonde,
[1:24:58] nobody you wanted to be with.
[1:25:01] But then God sent his word
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; in flesh.
[1:25:09] My brother-in-law got saved.
[1:25:14] I didn't know what he got saved into.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I didn't have a clue.
[1:25:24] Yeah. And we were all the same. We grew
[1:25:26] up the same.
[1:25:30] But then he looked like James,
[1:25:34] a gentleman.
[1:25:37] I said, "What happened to you?"
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "I found the storehouse."
[1:25:46] I said, "I want some of that storehouse.
[1:25:51] You can't have it.
[1:25:55] You can't have it."
[1:25:57] Why can't I have it?
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "Unless you're a seed,
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; you can't have this."
[1:26:06] You know what that was like saying?
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; You tell your little children,
[1:26:10] "Don't touch that.
[1:26:14] Don't touch that."
[1:26:17] But they want to touch it. I said,
[1:26:19] "Don't touch it."
[1:26:24] So when I say, he said, "You can't have
[1:26:26] this.
[1:26:30] Give me
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; what you got.
[1:26:34] and look at me.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; This is what it does.
[1:26:38] It just changes you.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; It changes you
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; and it's going to keep changing you.
[1:26:53] Brother said things that are to be.
[1:26:57] He said, "Since a little boy, a little
[1:26:59] girl,
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:02] you desired this,
[1:27:04] but you didn't know where to go.
[1:27:08] You finding God.
[1:27:11] It was God finding you.
[1:27:14] Amen."
[1:27:15] And so I here we are and we start to
[1:27:19] understand
[1:27:20] at the end of the age and the son of
[1:27:23] man's being revealed
[1:27:27] revealing.
[1:27:29] Who is he revealing?
[1:27:31] A son of man
[1:27:33] revealing the son of man
[1:27:36] which is Christ. Who's Christ
[1:27:40] Almighty
[1:27:42] anointed
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; God
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; in the beginning
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; created
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; the heavens and the earth.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; So now here we are
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; we said all that as we get into our
[1:28:01] subject.
[1:28:03] I'm not preaching to you this morning
[1:28:07] a past tense God
[1:28:11] of future.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I am preaching to you a message right
[1:28:18] now.
[1:28:20] Say you're always looking for Messiah.
[1:28:24] We have Messiah.
[1:28:27] Have the opening of the word.
[1:28:31] Where's God? Sorry. Where's God? Where's
[1:28:34] God? Where's God?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I don't see God.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just look left?
[1:28:41] Just look.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Look at one another.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Where's God in earth,
[1:28:50] our Father,
[1:28:52] who are in heaven, heavens, and the
[1:28:56] earth.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
[1:29:01] be done.
[1:29:03] in earth.
[1:29:05] Come on,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; in earth as it is in heaven.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Give us this day
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; our daily bread
[1:29:16] future man.
[1:29:21] All right.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Said Moses went down to Egypt
[1:29:30] and he told the church fathers
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; that the Lord God has visited him.
[1:29:39] Here comes a prophet.
[1:29:42] He said, "I met God."
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; How did he reveal himself?
[1:29:48] What did he say who he was?
[1:29:50] He says, "I the I am.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; I am the I am
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; in the beginning.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; The I am
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; created, the heavens
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; and the earth,
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; not past,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; not future.
[1:30:09] I am the I am
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; right now. Whatever you desire when you
[1:30:15] pray,
[1:30:18] I'm getting it back onto you now.
[1:30:21] Preacher,
[1:30:22] I'm putting it back on you. Are you a
[1:30:25] son of God? Are you a son of God? You
[1:30:29] ask anything in my name.
[1:30:33] What you ask?
[1:30:35] You ask.
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:40] What day on that day you will know that
[1:30:45] I'm in the father, the father's in me,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I in you
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:57] and Christ are one.
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Should have got some
[1:31:07] of you out of your chairs right there.
[1:31:13] I It was better
[1:31:16] than scoring a goal.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just hit a home run.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And 80,000 people go crazy.
[1:31:33] It's a ball.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; It's a stick.
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:49] God
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Godlu.
[1:31:54] [Applause]
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Take that one, devil.
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:09] He can't have you.
[1:32:11] And they overcame him
[1:32:14] by the testimony
[1:32:16] and by the blood of the lamb.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Overcome him.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Satan
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; is under your feet.
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; I like church,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; but when I get home,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not so happy.
[1:32:37] You should be happy
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; 24/7.
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:50] I'm watching you.
[1:32:54] So now God reveals himself to the
[1:32:56] prophet
[1:32:58] and the prophet reveals God
[1:33:03] to his people.
[1:33:05] What does he call himself?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; The I am.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Not I will be,
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; not I was,
[1:33:18] but by what I am,
[1:33:22] not past, not future,
[1:33:26] he's a very present.
[1:33:30] Hallelujah. Amen. In Exodus 3:14,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Exodus 3:14,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; he says, "And God said unto Moses,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; I am that I am.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt tell the children of Israel,
[1:33:48] I am sent you."
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Now the I am
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; is a very interesting word.
[1:33:59] So now here God
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; was now starting to unveil himself.
[1:34:06] Mighty God
[1:34:08] was unveiling himself.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Not just God,
[1:34:14] but I I am.
[1:34:16] So now when you said God in the
[1:34:20] beginning,
[1:34:23] he was telling his people
[1:34:26] that my presence is with you always.
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now we'll just settle it down a
[1:34:35] little bit.
[1:34:37] Okay. So by revealing himself as the I
[1:34:40] am,
[1:34:43] I am a very present help.
[1:34:48] I'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; So then you start to wonder,
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; who's the he will never leave me?
[1:34:59] God.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; God in you, the hope of glory.
[1:35:10] Amen. Amen. Now, now we're just going to
[1:35:12] take a little bit slower now.
[1:35:16] very important. So then he's not a god
[1:35:18] of history.
[1:35:20] That's why a prophet in this generation
[1:35:24] raised him out of history.
[1:35:26] The present
[1:35:31] he spoke about Moses.
[1:35:33] He was talking about himself.
[1:35:36] When he's talking about Joshua, he was
[1:35:38] talking about himself.
[1:35:40] Come on.
[1:35:43] Out of the I am.
[1:35:45] Moses was always in God.
[1:35:48] Always in God.
[1:35:50] Always in God. Matthew was always in
[1:35:52] God.
[1:35:54] Are you with me?
[1:35:56] Isaiah,
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Malachi,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; they were all in God.
[1:36:03] So the God
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; that was with Moses
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Isaiah
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Elijah
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Elishah
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; that God
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; who is an everpresent God that same God
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; is not just with him.
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; You mean I got God in me?
[1:36:31] That's what the whole message all about.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached the message.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Here it is here. Super sign
[1:36:44] mighty but God unveiled before us.
[1:36:48] God was behind Badger Skin.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; God was behind Badger Skin.
[1:36:57] That was the glory behind Badger Skin.
[1:37:04] God is in the tabernacle
[1:37:08] and only the high priest can go.
[1:37:15] Only the high priest.
[1:37:18] I want to go.
[1:37:21] Get away. Fight. I want in there.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; No, you couldn't do that. You die.
[1:37:28] But God had a greater plan for you.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; You're not in the wilderness.
[1:37:36] You're not in the inner court.
[1:37:39] You are kings and priests to God.
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:47] Go into that shikina glory.
[1:37:53] That shina glory
[1:37:56] in you.
[1:37:57] [Applause]
[1:38:04] What does the back of the church say?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; So now it's not behind Badger skins.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; He says it's behind your skin.
[1:38:19] Amen.
[1:38:21] Whose skin? I'm going to ask you who
[1:38:24] skin
[1:38:26] and get a personal
[1:38:28] your skin.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's me, mama.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing in the mirror.
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; It's me, mama.
[1:38:41] Amen. I'm not hearing about it.
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now
[1:38:51] I'm only here for a very short time. I
[1:38:54] just want to encourage you.
[1:38:57] He said, "Now the glory of God,
[1:39:00] the glory of God,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; that is the thought of God, that's the
[1:39:04] opinion of God, that's the shining
[1:39:07] glory,
[1:39:09] our God is in you."
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Walk like it.
[1:39:17] Hallelujah.
[1:39:20] Come on. Walk like you're a son
[1:39:23] like you're a daughter.
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:33] You say, "Oh, but we're just a little
[1:39:35] little church here in
[1:39:38] Are you kidding me?
[1:39:41] You're not a little church.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; You're not the toe.
[1:39:46] You're not the thigh.
[1:39:48] You're not the breast. You're not the
[1:39:50] tongue.
[1:39:52] You pass the eyes. Now you're in the
[1:39:54] intelligence.
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:57] I am
[1:39:59] you.
[1:40:03] No such prevailing power.
[1:40:09] If you could catch a revelation
[1:40:12] that God
[1:40:14] in the beginning
[1:40:17] has walked through seven ages
[1:40:21] thousand years
[1:40:24] and now he's found
[1:40:26] his adopted sons.
[1:40:31] We love terminology,
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; but terminology won't get you to heaven.
[1:40:40] Revelation will get you to heaven.
[1:40:44] Oh, I I know where brother says that.
[1:40:48] Live it then. Okay.
[1:40:51] Live it. When you go out of this out of
[1:40:55] this church,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; I want you with your shoulders back.
[1:41:02] I'm a son. Not a just a king.
[1:41:07] I'm a son of the king of kings.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter
[1:41:18] of the king of kings.
[1:41:24] Then you got that gene in you.
[1:41:36] So now
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:41] Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; So then it's the providence of God
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; that you're here this morning.
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:53] I'm I know brother Stephven can preach
[1:41:56] way better than me,
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; but we do have the same message.
[1:42:02] I'm not saying anything new.
[1:42:05] I'm just saying what the messenger said.
[1:42:08] So the messenger said under her
[1:42:11] messenger,
[1:42:14] she
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; is the final voice
[1:42:18] to the final age.
[1:42:21] same voice
[1:42:24] that said, "Let there be
[1:42:30] in you and me,
[1:42:32] Satan. We bind you,
[1:42:36] Satan.
[1:42:38] We bind you.
[1:42:40] Get behind us.
[1:42:42] We're tired of you.
[1:42:45] I'm a son of the king."
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:42:49] Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:42:58] A power
[1:43:03] a power. Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; We're talking about infinite
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; infinite power.
[1:43:17] is living in his bride.
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; So the sovereignty of God,
[1:43:28] his providential care
[1:43:31] by his great fornowledge
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:36] you
[1:43:38] sons and daughters of God.
[1:43:41] Not in Luther's age. Not
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; not in Luther's age.
[1:43:46] Not in Wesley's age
[1:43:49] and not even in Pentecost.
[1:43:53] The end of the age
[1:43:56] of man is revealed
[1:44:00] revealing Christ.
[1:44:02] If he's revealing Christ,
[1:44:05] he has to reveal you
[1:44:10] because you're the one that's in him.
[1:44:15] him
[1:44:17] found.
[1:44:20] Amen.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; So it's not mind over matter. I got to
[1:44:25] have
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:29] faith comes by revelation
[1:44:33] by hearing the word of the Lord.
[1:44:36] We want to get this message out
[1:44:40] in Uganda.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; We want to get it in books.
[1:44:44] Look what it did to your pastor.
[1:44:47] If I remember correctly, sitting around
[1:44:48] my son Sam,
[1:44:53] my oldest son.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Pastoral,
[1:44:59] how did you come in?"
[1:45:02] Brother Ivali says, "I got a church age
[1:45:04] book."
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Am I correct? And a church age book
[1:45:12] is the thought of God
[1:45:14] brought down
[1:45:16] in this generation.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; So if look what it did to brother
[1:45:20] Steven,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; why do you think we have a burden
[1:45:26] to get this message
[1:45:28] into your hands?
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; So then the sovereign God
[1:45:39] The one with full authority,
[1:45:43] supreme authority,
[1:45:46] the self-sufficient one,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; the omnisient one,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; the om the present one.
[1:45:55] [Applause]
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, you got to stick with me now.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; So now I'll break it down.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; The god is a god of emissions.
[1:46:08] So that means he knows everything at all
[1:46:11] times,
[1:46:13] effortlessly,
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; effortlessly and instantly.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, what should I do?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, lead me. He's omnisient.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; He'll guide you. Those that are the sons
[1:46:31] of God
[1:46:33] are led of his spirit.
[1:46:36] So it's omniscience leading you.
[1:46:40] God leading you.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; So we know he's omnisient. He knows all
[1:46:47] things inside
[1:46:49] effortlessly. He knows everything.
[1:46:52] So he's omnipresent.
[1:46:54] Brother said he's omnipresent.
[1:46:58] He feels all space and time.
[1:47:03] Think about it. Think about it. He's
[1:47:06] omnipresent.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; He feels all space and time.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And he's omnipotent.
[1:47:14] Omnipotent.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Omnipotent means he's all powerful.
[1:47:20] His power is unlimited
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; and he's able to do anything.
[1:47:29] Like I said, I'm setting a trap.
[1:47:33] I got God in me.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; But barely have victory.
[1:47:39] You should be the most victorious
[1:47:43] because brother Bram said in Christ and
[1:47:45] Mr. God revealed
[1:47:49] that is his victory.
[1:47:54] Not the omnipotence of God.
[1:48:00] You can't separate them
[1:48:03] and say he can't help me now.
[1:48:07] You can't do that.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; That's what God is.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; So now all that God is,
[1:48:15] he poured into Christ.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:28] All that was in God
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; poured into Christ.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; he's poured into you.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; So now God's everywhere in your life
[1:48:44] because he's omnipresent. He's all
[1:48:46] knowing.
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; He's omnipotent.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; That's why he can bind the devil.
[1:48:54] That's why we can put that serpent
[1:48:59] under your feet.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; You got power to bind.
[1:49:05] Power to loose.
[1:49:08] Power to bind.
[1:49:11] Power to bind.
[1:49:14] Power to loose.
[1:49:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:23] Where is that power?
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; We've got the power.
[1:49:31] We all do that. We all do that.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; But then we get outside
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; and our car breaks down.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; You got no more power.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; The power is not in mechanics.
[1:49:52] is in dynamics.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got all the mechanics and it's
[1:49:58] failed people.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; There's something I want to understand.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Power in dynamic.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:50:23] Oh, we got it. We got it. We've
[1:50:24] struggled.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Congratulations.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:31] God gives gifts to the church.
[1:50:34] Oh,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; I want this gift. I want this gift.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; You got gifts all around you.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got deacons, trustees,
[1:50:41] pastors,
[1:50:43] song leaders, singers,
[1:50:47] symbol makers.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, there should be a smile on everyone.
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; So, what God is declaring
[1:51:02] in the beginning,
[1:51:04] God,
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; what he's declaring
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; is that he is a city.
[1:51:15] You can read it right here.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; God is a Hebrew.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Meaning
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; meaning self-existence.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:51:32] So in the beginning,
[1:51:34] the self-existing one,
[1:51:37] the God that's always present,
[1:51:42] that God
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; is revealing himself
[1:51:46] so that you and I could know who we are.
[1:51:52] Let me let me try and break this down.
[1:51:56] You cannot know who God is
[1:52:00] unless God sends a prophet.
[1:52:05] Cuz the Lord himself
[1:52:08] can do nothing
[1:52:11] until he reveals himself
[1:52:15] the prophet.
[1:52:18] So then God
[1:52:20] who's the allsufficient one
[1:52:23] has to reveal himself
[1:52:26] as the all powerful God.
[1:52:29] So then he had to change his mask
[1:52:33] to come in more feet.
[1:52:38] So he changed his mask
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; and walked to Abraham's tent.
[1:52:48] But Sarah
[1:52:50] didn't catch the revelation
[1:52:54] of who Elohim was.
[1:52:58] Abraham
[1:53:00] to reveal
[1:53:02] who Elohim was.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; So then when God
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; came in the flesh,
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; he had to have John here,
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist
[1:53:17] because a prophet
[1:53:20] has to reveal immorphy.
[1:53:22] [Applause]
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Are you getting?
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; So there had to be John
[1:53:30] to reveal Jesus.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; So every time God changes his mask,
[1:53:39] we have a prophet.
[1:53:41] Oh, so now here God changes his mask. He
[1:53:44] gone in the pillar of fire.
[1:53:49] Where's his prophet?
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You had Andrew.
[1:53:54] Hey, you had Peter.
[1:53:56] Where was Paul?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; God had to get Paul
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; because he's going to be the prophet of
[1:54:02] the age.
[1:54:04] It's
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; a prophet
[1:54:06] to show the changing of him
[1:54:12] and bless the spirit again.
[1:54:16] So then in this day,
[1:54:19] God had to have Malachi 4.
[1:54:24] He had to send you a prophet
[1:54:26] to let you know
[1:54:29] God in
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; morphing.
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:38] Amen.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; I hope you God in me
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. I can do all
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; now. You read the scriptures different.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ.
[1:54:54] that strengthen
[1:54:58] one
[1:55:00] present one.
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; So now now
[1:55:07] God is trying to reveal to his bride who
[1:55:10] she is in him.
[1:55:15] Amen.
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; How many times
[1:55:22] how many times
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; did Jesus say,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; "I am
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; the bread of life."
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; the light of the world.
[1:55:37] I am
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; the door to the sheepfold.
[1:55:44] What was he doing? Revealing himself as
[1:55:49] thee.
[1:55:51] The full omnipotence of
[1:55:55] Oh my.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; So now he says, I am the door to the
[1:56:01] sheepfold. I am the resurrection and the
[1:56:03] life.
[1:56:07] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:56:12] I am the true vine.
[1:56:15] Glory.
[1:56:17] I am before Abraham was. Glory.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; So God's revealing who he is.
[1:56:28] Mine eyes have seen the glory of the
[1:56:32] coming of the Lord. What? Your eyes of
[1:56:36] understanding
[1:56:39] opened up at last.
[1:56:43] True victory is mine.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; I was chained down in the past.
[1:56:53] That's why David writes in the Psalms,
[1:56:57] "My soul waiteth only upon God,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; for my expectation
[1:57:07] is in him.
[1:57:11] Amen.
[1:57:13] Amen.
[1:57:15] Amen."
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:19] We're not talking about the first poll.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; We are
[1:57:25] not talking about the first.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; As I was saying to brother Freddy's
[1:57:29] church yesterday,
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; when you have sheep,
[1:57:35] you don't have to get up in the morning
[1:57:36] say,
[1:57:38] "Make me some wool."
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; It's always there, right? Uh-uh.
[1:57:49] because he's a sheep.
[1:57:53] Sheep make wool.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm a son of God."
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Am I a son of God?
[1:58:05] Am I saved?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Please. You're not a goat. You're a
[1:58:11] sheep.
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:16] [Applause]
[1:58:25] Oh, God is good.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Think about it, saints.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; God is revealing
[1:58:33] not in the first poll,
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; not in the second pole. Even though
[1:58:37] Egypt benefited,
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; they benefited.
[1:58:43] But the first pole made way for the
[1:58:45] second pole.
[1:58:48] The second pole made way for the third
[1:58:49] pole.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Remember the story brother talked about
[1:58:53] the fishing.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; So he first had to learn it.
[1:59:00] He took him by the hand.
[1:59:03] Then God said, "There's another change
[1:59:04] in your ministry.
[1:59:07] Be the second pole
[1:59:09] and you'll discern the
[1:59:14] Then
[1:59:16] brother said he was looking for the
[1:59:18] third pole.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; And so in the third pole,
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; God reveals to the prophet
[1:59:29] that it's the opening of the word.
[1:59:33] Huh? It's the spoken word
[1:59:37] and it's preaching to the lost
[1:59:41] three.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; So now we're in the third pole.
[1:59:50] All right. We don't have the time. I'm
[1:59:51] sorry.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; It's not good.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. Couple more minutes.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Is everybody okay?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; All right. So now in the in the third
[2:00:13] poll
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; is the opening of the word
[2:00:17] and that is only
[2:00:19] pertains to the elect.
[2:00:24] Amen. It only pertains to the elect.
[2:00:33] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; So now the open word had to take place.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; So then the God that was in Genesis
[2:00:44] came down in Revelation 10:1,
[2:00:48] the mighty angel
[2:00:51] descended,
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:54] taking with him the open book.
[2:00:59] And brother Brown as being Revelation
[2:01:02] 10:7
[2:01:05] was waiting for that book to be open,
[2:01:08] but it couldn't be opened unless there
[2:01:10] was a prophet
[2:01:13] pres. And brother Michael and I were
[2:01:16] fellowshipping last night
[2:01:19] up to 1962.
[2:01:23] He says, "We're looking for Malachi 4,
[2:01:26] Malachi 4 ministry.
[2:01:29] started at the opening of the word.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach anything that's
[2:01:36] different than what you've been taught.
[2:01:42] Paul
[2:01:44] was now saved for the elect.
[2:01:49] And Revelation 10:7
[2:01:53] Malachi 4
[2:01:55] had to be on earth
[2:01:58] to introduce.
[2:02:00] Behold
[2:02:02] the lamb of God
[2:02:04] taken away
[2:02:06] sin of the elect.
[2:02:11] Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] Amen.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; He had to be on earth
[2:02:16] and he saw that mighty angel descend
[2:02:17] over something.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; And so then the book was open.
[2:02:26] Seven seals were loose.
[2:02:29] We make the saying,
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; "I saw my name in the book."
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; And I'll I'll end on this point.
[2:02:40] Everybody say, "I saw my name in the
[2:02:41] book."
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; I did not see Tom Ray in here.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "You saw your name in the
[2:02:52] book."
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I go, "Where is Thomas?"
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; I see Thomas the doubter.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Not me.
[2:03:10] No, I had to believe
[2:03:13] because I'm his seed
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; because
[2:03:21] so the storehouse
[2:03:24] that Joseph had stored the grainph
[2:03:29] The seals had to be open.
[2:03:34] Rain could come.
[2:03:37] But it wasn't for Egypt.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for Egypt.
[2:03:43] It was only for the elect.
[2:03:47] The opening of the word
[2:03:51] to the world. It is for you.
[2:03:55] [Applause]
[2:03:56] God opened the book
[2:04:00] for you.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; You okay?
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we want to see our
[2:04:07] names.
[2:04:09] Brother said in the first seal,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; he says, "Now listen, the book actually
[2:04:15] was planned and written
[2:04:21] before the foundation of the world.
[2:04:25] This book,
[2:04:27] the Bible,
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; was written before the foundation of the
[2:04:31] earth.
[2:04:33] And Christ
[2:04:35] being the lamb
[2:04:38] was slain before.
[2:04:43] And the members of his bride,
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:47] their names were put in the lamb's book
[2:04:50] of life.
[2:04:54] before the foundation of the world.
[2:04:58] But
[2:05:00] it was sealed up.
[2:05:04] We had to have Malachi 4.
[2:05:08] We had to have Revelation 10:7.
[2:05:12] But
[2:05:14] it was sealed up.
[2:05:17] But now
[2:05:18] it's being revealed.
[2:05:24] Christ
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; is the mystery
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; of God revealed
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; in you.
[2:05:36] It was once sealed up.
[2:05:41] Do you understand?
[2:05:43] All throughout those ages,
[2:05:47] they have desired to see what you see.
[2:05:52] The book wasn't open yet.
[2:05:56] A prophet wasn't here yet.
[2:06:00] So it took a prophet
[2:06:02] to study Revelation 10:1 to say.
[2:06:07] Do you understand? Do you saw the cloud
[2:06:10] over Mount Sunset?
[2:06:13] Oh, I know there's a lot of controversy.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; There's no controversy.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; They're just unbelievers.
[2:06:22] That's it. Brother Ram said in the
[2:06:25] rising of the sun, he said, "When I saw
[2:06:28] that cloud up there,
[2:06:30] here's your quote.
[2:06:32] That's the Lord up there.
[2:06:37] That's the Lord up there.
[2:06:39] It was a mystery
[2:06:42] to the world, but it was now being
[2:06:44] unveiled
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; to you,
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; to me. See him almighty God
[2:06:53] authority
[2:06:55] supreme authority living in me
[2:07:00] to God be the glory.
[2:07:03] [Applause]
[2:07:07] So the book,
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; your name
[2:07:11] Tom Ray,
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Tom Ray
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; was not in the book.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; But the revelation of who Tom Ray was.
[2:07:22] [Applause]
[2:07:24] Everybody say, "What's the big deal
[2:07:26] about the seven seals?"
[2:07:30] Without the seven seal opening,
[2:07:33] there's nobody that's going to manifest
[2:07:36] Christ.
[2:07:39] Now listen, but it was sealed up.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; But now it's being revealed.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; So now Malachi 4 ministry was blending
[2:07:50] revealing himself who he was.
[2:07:53] He believed he was Malachi 4.
[2:07:56] But it takes a revelation.
[2:07:59] Takes prevailing power.
[2:08:02] You see that's
[2:08:03] Malachi 4.
[2:08:06] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; So now here's let me break it down for
[2:08:10] you.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "But there is some that's got
[2:08:16] their names written in the lamb's book."
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; There is some
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; that's got their names written.
[2:08:25] Are you listening?
[2:08:27] We want to close on this main point
[2:08:31] because we've been speaking of the I am
[2:08:33] of God.
[2:08:36] upon this rock I'll build my church.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; So now we find that our names were
[2:08:44] written before the foundation of the
[2:08:45] world
[2:08:48] up in the book.
[2:08:51] So until there was a prophet on the
[2:08:53] scene
[2:08:55] before Revelation 10:7,
[2:09:01] [Music]
[2:09:04] the son of man revealing the son of man.
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:11] Now he says there's those have got their
[2:09:13] name written in the lamb's book.
[2:09:17] And when those seals were thrown open,
[2:09:23] There they saw their name.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit speaks to them.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, brother James. So when
[2:09:36] the seals were loose,
[2:09:39] it wasn't William Brandham speaking.
[2:09:43] God through the son of man.
[2:09:46] Amen. The mighty God unveiled
[2:09:50] revealing who he was to you.
[2:09:55] To God be the glory.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Without the opening of the seals, you
[2:10:00] couldn't see your name.
[2:10:05] So people say the seals aren't open.
[2:10:08] Well,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; there's no name for them.
[2:10:18] If there's one,
[2:10:20] I'm the one.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; If there's only one name written there,
[2:10:31] not you. Me. Me also. No, only me.
[2:10:38] Brother Bram said, "If there's only one
[2:10:40] going,
[2:10:43] you got to believe it's you.
[2:10:46] [Applause]
[2:10:50] Christ in you the hope of glory.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; That hope in the Greek
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; does not mean hope. So
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; no, it doesn't mean I hope I get it.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Because you have to read the book
[2:11:12] like it's an eastern book.
[2:11:17] You got faith,
[2:11:19] hope and charity.
[2:11:22] Hope
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; faith. I'll move mountains.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Charity.
[2:11:31] Force.
[2:11:33] Hope.
[2:11:34] Poor hope. She's the third one in there.
[2:11:39] The weakest one in there.
[2:11:44] Hope
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; in the Greek
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; does not mean hope. So
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; has a powerful
[2:11:54] expectation of fulfillment.
[2:12:04] Uhhuh.
[2:12:10] Amen.
[2:12:15] powerful
[2:12:17] expectation.
[2:12:20] Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; I've got powerful expectation.
[2:12:26] I'm going to be
[2:12:28] I'm going to be changed.
[2:12:32] You're going to be changed.
[2:12:34] Why? The open book
[2:12:38] revealed my name.
[2:12:41] I'm going to heaven
[2:12:44] because I came from the Almighty.
[2:12:48] Genesis 1.
[2:12:50] Revelation 10:7.
[2:12:52] [Applause]
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Please, please one favor
[2:13:01] don't make
[2:13:04] just knowledge.
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:08] Then we failed you.
[2:13:10] [Music]
[2:13:14] The church is built on revelation.
[2:13:18] God built on knowledge
[2:13:21] on revelation
[2:13:24] who you are.
[2:13:28] My Bible says
[2:13:31] when Jesus came,
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; the common people
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; the common people
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; heard him gladly.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; You've been a wonderful
[2:13:51] audience this morning.
[2:13:53] Thank you for pulling on the word.
[2:13:56] [Applause]
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] You sing I've got the life of God. Do
[2:14:06] you sing that song? I've got the life of
[2:14:08] God in me.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, you do?
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Not me.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Not you.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Not me. They are here.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Well, you stay with me.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; You stay with me.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So we sing it.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. This is the way we sing it.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm not a singer. He's the singer.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; I got the life of God in me. I got his
[2:14:44] life, his power, and his ability. I got
[2:14:48] the life of God in me.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. Did you get that?
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, let's get the right key.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me.
[2:15:04] I' got the life of God in me. I got his
[2:15:10] nature and his ability.
[2:15:13] Come on.
[2:15:14] Come on, Michael.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're gonna sing it until you get
[2:15:18] it.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's why we preach so you can get it.
[2:15:23] Okay.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to sing it with some
[2:15:27] life.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me.
[2:15:38] I've got his life, his nature, and his
[2:15:41] ability. I've got the life of God in me.
[2:15:46] I've got the life of God in me.
[2:15:50] I've got the life of God in me.
[2:15:55] I've got his life, his nature, and his
[2:15:58] ability. I've got the life of God in
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; I've got the life of God in me.
[2:16:07] I've got the life of God in me. Well,
[2:16:11] I've got his life, his nature, and his
[2:16:14] ability. I've got the life of God in me.
[2:16:19] I've got that life from God in me. I've
[2:16:24] got the life of God in me.
[2:16:28] I've got his life, his nature, and his
[2:16:31] ability. I've got the life of God in me.
[2:16:41] Amen. Do you appreciate Pastor Tom?
[2:16:45] Amen.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us sit for a little while and
[2:16:48] invite pastor
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; to come praise the name of our lord. You
[2:16:56] can sit and then invite.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you enjoyed the word?
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching the God of history.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; That's what the brother said. He's
[2:17:32] preaching a present tense God
[2:17:36] before Abraham was
[2:17:38] a
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; and he'll always be a
[2:17:43] when he spoke about I mean to to Moses
[2:17:46] He says, "I am
[2:17:49] the father of Abraham,
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Jacob, Isaac,
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; not I was,
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; but I am."
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the I am?
[2:18:01] I am the resurrection.
[2:18:05] I am.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; You're not that man at the cross.
[2:18:09] Remember me when you come.
[2:18:11] He says, "I am the resurrection."
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Not I will be. I am.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; And tonight,
[2:18:21] tonight
[2:18:22] you will be with me.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We deal
[2:18:28] with the God who is present tense.
[2:18:33] Amen. To God there is no time.
[2:18:37] He has no time to himself.
[2:18:39] Are you together with me? And when we
[2:18:42] got the perfect faith,
[2:18:45] it is a substance.
[2:18:47] Substance means something that exists
[2:18:52] or things that we hope for
[2:18:55] that we expect and believe strongly that
[2:18:59] we are going to receive.
[2:19:02] I want to tell you something. You know
[2:19:04] brother Brham says faith is find God's
[2:19:07] will for you
[2:19:11] and then he says faith is a substance.
[2:19:15] This is the present tense God we are
[2:19:17] dealing with.
[2:19:19] So when he created you he mapped your
[2:19:23] path.
[2:19:26] He mapped all your junctions.
[2:19:30] Amen. He knew that Israel
[2:19:34] will go under captivity
[2:19:36] for 450 years and then I'll come again
[2:19:40] and redeem them. And therefore
[2:19:43] everything
[2:19:45] that they needed for that journey
[2:19:48] created it to come forth in the season
[2:19:53] when they needed it. Are you together
[2:19:56] with me? It would look like the children
[2:19:58] of Israel
[2:20:01] are the ones who called God
[2:20:04] to hear and then come down. But it was
[2:20:08] predestinated plan.
[2:20:12] Are you together with me? So the brother
[2:20:14] says this message is for believers.
[2:20:18] I said the same also.
[2:20:21] We preach predestinated sea.
[2:20:24] The rest of the people will be here.
[2:20:27] They will listen. They will put it here.
[2:20:30] But yours is here
[2:20:33] because we deal with present God.
[2:20:37] I want to say that when God created you,
[2:20:41] he created you with all your
[2:20:44] opportunities.
[2:20:47] Amen.
[2:20:49] in life to the extent that when the
[2:20:52] challenges come
[2:20:55] you just call those things into
[2:20:56] existence.
[2:20:59] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; You see this is what the brothers been
[2:21:02] saying.
[2:21:04] If you knew what he was talking about
[2:21:07] the hallelujah
[2:21:09] the praise God. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:21:13] Because he's bringing God from history
[2:21:17] to bring him down here with you
[2:21:20] to a God you fellowship with, a God you
[2:21:23] live with, a God who leads your
[2:21:27] What can I say? Praise God. Amen. Amen.
[2:21:32] So, we really thank God. Brother Tom is
[2:21:35] a a special man.
[2:21:38] He goes that way, goes that way, goes
[2:21:42] that way, collects the world think here.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I trust that you've all
[2:21:50] been blessed.
[2:21:55] Let me tell you, he knew your journey
[2:21:59] and he prepared for you what you have
[2:22:03] need of today.
[2:22:07] So you will never be deficient.
[2:22:12] So you need faith
[2:22:15] which is a substance.
[2:22:17] You just pull
[2:22:19] the substance you have need of
[2:22:23] at that time they needed Moses.
[2:22:27] He was the substance
[2:22:30] substance God.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:22:36] Let's give praise to the Lord this
[2:22:39] morning this afternoon.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; To me he you know he he he brought out
[2:22:49] that issue of the mind,
[2:22:55] the mind.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; And that mind comes into you.
[2:23:01] And when the mind comes into you
[2:23:04] then the mind
[2:23:06] goes before the word.
[2:23:14] So whatever you speak
[2:23:17] when the mind is in there
[2:23:20] you are speaking the unfailing
[2:23:22] words
[2:23:26] because that will be God speaking
[2:23:29] that will be the speaking.
[2:23:33] He was bringing you away
[2:23:37] so that God can come
[2:23:41] at the control
[2:23:43] of his pride.
[2:23:46] And once you have the word,
[2:23:49] the mind of God, you have everything you
[2:23:52] need. No wonder the prophet says the
[2:23:56] rapture is within you.
[2:24:00] It's not something we are going to look
[2:24:02] for.
[2:24:04] When we have the word, the mind of God,
[2:24:08] we have it. When we come to this season,
[2:24:11] we shall be changed.
[2:24:14] Amen. We appreciate you, brother Tom.
[2:24:17] You kept bringing many things there. We
[2:24:20] really appreciate God. Do you love him?
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; So, um, before we close the service,
[2:24:30] Uh,
[2:24:32] brother
[2:24:35] Tom Rem
[2:24:37] is going to do
[2:24:40] an ordination for us today.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven Odoi
[2:24:49] is going to be ordained
[2:24:53] for the work that the Lord has led him
[2:24:56] to start.
[2:25:00] in the area.
[2:25:03] So I would ask brother Odoi
[2:25:08] to walk forward
[2:25:10] with his family to be witnesses
[2:25:14] as he gets ordained for that job today.
[2:25:20] You love him.
[2:25:23] Amen.
[2:25:26] So you are not going to preach the god
[2:25:28] of yesterday.
[2:25:32] You are not going to preach the god of
[2:25:33] tomorrow.
[2:25:36] I am that I am.
[2:25:41] I am that I am.
[2:25:45] Amen.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:25:48] Let the I am
[2:25:51] his mind in you
[2:25:54] that when you speak to God's people,
[2:25:58] you are speaking God's word.
[2:26:00] You are speaking life,
[2:26:03] not past tense,
[2:26:06] not future tense. You are speaking life
[2:26:10] itself
[2:26:12] into the hearts of the people.
[2:26:15] God bless you.
[2:26:20] Do I have the mic on
[2:26:34] the bra said when God calls a man,
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; he calls his wife.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; So it's not unusual for a brother to
[2:26:44] want his wife standing with him.
[2:26:49] Brother so often referred to me.
[2:26:54] She was white before her time.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Because she was carrying the burdens of
[2:27:00] the people.
[2:27:05] So today we're standing here because
[2:27:08] brother Steven wants to be ordained.
[2:27:11] Brother Brham
[2:27:14] ordained a lot of men.
[2:27:18] Where they went, we do not know.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; We don't know.
[2:27:24] But it's personal.
[2:27:27] So I'm not worried about tomorrow,
[2:27:31] Stephen.
[2:27:33] As we've been preaching,
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; he's the God of the present.
[2:27:38] So you keep focused on the cross,
[2:27:42] focus on this message.
[2:27:45] Don't add or take away
[2:27:48] as we were in the book of Revelation.
[2:27:51] One word, added or taken away, shall
[2:27:56] take your name out of the lamb's book.
[2:28:01] Brother said, "Do not add to this
[2:28:03] message."
[2:28:05] The angel confirmed what he preached.
[2:28:10] You preach the same thing the prophet
[2:28:12] preached.
[2:28:14] The same angel will confirm your
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; because it's already been confirmed.
[2:28:21] You understand that, brother Stephen?
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; This is an incredible thing. I had a
[2:28:26] scripture
[2:28:28] and I told Michael yesterday, I've got a
[2:28:30] scripture the Lord gave me for the
[2:28:32] minister.
[2:28:36] ministers at brother Freddy.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; He had a bunch of ministers,
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; but it was for you, brother Steven.
[2:28:47] Before this event even took place,
[2:28:51] God had you in mind.
[2:28:54] Amen.
[2:28:59] Now the Bible says in
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; blessed are the feet.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Blessed are the feet
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; that preach the gospel.
[2:29:16] Hallelujah.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Feat's very important.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Taking a step is possession.
[2:29:25] and you're taking possession this
[2:29:27] morning.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; You step forward.
[2:29:31] You're claiming your land,
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; your position in Christ
[2:29:38] because under the word,
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Paul writes in Romans.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Now to him that's able
[2:29:48] to the power to establish power
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; according to his word.
[2:29:56] The God of peace shall bruise Satan's
[2:29:59] under your feet.
[2:30:06] [Music]
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; Did we bruise the devil today?
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; By the gospel
[2:30:14] and by the gospel living in flesh for
[2:30:16] them.
[2:30:19] God has said in his word
[2:30:21] that you're a blessed man
[2:30:24] and he's a God
[2:30:27] that will lead and keep
[2:30:30] you believe the message with all of your
[2:30:33] heart.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand for it. Take the persecution
[2:30:38] for it.
[2:30:40] Love it. It's like a marriage.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; It's like a marriage.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Will you take him?
[2:30:49] be your great bride and friend.
[2:30:54] All right. How can they hear unless you
[2:30:57] sent
[2:31:00] may the Holy Spirit
[2:31:04] and whatever God has in store for you.
[2:31:08] May you bring in many for the kingdom.
[2:31:12] And I'm going to give you brother Bis's
[2:31:14] favorite scripture.
[2:31:18] when that woman with the alabaster box
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; and she poured the oil on Jesus
[2:31:26] and they gave such a bad time to this
[2:31:28] woman.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said,
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; she did all she could.
[2:31:36] And that was the way brother Bisco
[2:31:38] lived.
[2:31:40] He said, "I have done all I could.
[2:31:46] Brother Steph, may you do all you can.
[2:31:51] Don't look at the trials.
[2:31:53] Those trials are ordained
[2:31:56] to make you a better man.
[2:31:59] Can we all bow our heads in a word of
[2:32:00] prayer?
[2:32:03] Father,
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; it's not by the laying of hands on a
[2:32:08] man,
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; but it's to recognize that the man is
[2:32:13] called by God.
[2:32:15] The brothers have recognized our dear
[2:32:17] brother Steven and his dear wife.
[2:32:20] We pray Lord under the anointing of God
[2:32:22] that is present
[2:32:25] that you will use him Lord in a mighty
[2:32:27] way.
[2:32:29] May he go down paths ordained of God.
[2:32:33] When he comes to the crossroad of the
[2:32:35] road, may he look for the bloody
[2:32:38] footprints
[2:32:39] that shall lead him all the way.
[2:32:42] Lord, open his eyes to see more of your
[2:32:45] glorious
[2:32:47] grace. Give him uncction of the spirit.
[2:32:51] Anointed from above,
[2:32:53] Lord, to discern the right from the
[2:32:55] wrong.
[2:32:57] May you bless his dear wife
[2:33:00] as they now go down this journey.
[2:33:04] Lord, as we recognize him as a minister
[2:33:06] of the gospel of Jesus,
[2:33:09] we ask that your grace rest be upon him
[2:33:13] and his wife. Pray God that when he
[2:33:16] opens the word
[2:33:19] become a living word
[2:33:22] and may the spirit of God quicken him
[2:33:25] spirit Christ from the dead and our
[2:33:29] brother Steven
[2:33:31] he'll conquer many kingdoms.
[2:33:34] Lord we ask you to bless him
[2:33:37] and guide him great shepherd
[2:33:40] as we ask now as we finish this little
[2:33:43] ordination
[2:33:46] that he
[2:33:47] will look to the lamb of God
[2:33:51] and be led by the great shepherd of
[2:33:53] Jesus.
[2:33:56] We commit him and his dear wife to you
[2:33:58] now
[2:34:00] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[2:34:05] God bless you.
[2:34:07] God bless you and you and use you sister
[2:34:12] one for the kingdom. God bless you.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's give the Lord a
[2:34:18] hand of praise.
[2:34:19] [Music]
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:34:26] You remember when brother
[2:34:29] Tom Ray was winding up the service,
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; it was about the name
[2:34:38] Where is the name
[2:34:40] in the book?
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Your name is writing there.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; In the book
[2:34:49] which is the word.
[2:34:52] That's where you will find your name.
[2:34:56] Amen. And remember,
[2:34:59] John was able to see his name
[2:35:03] after it was revealed to him
[2:35:07] that there was a lamb
[2:35:10] that bled for his sake.
[2:35:13] It gave him the confidence.
[2:35:15] He lifted up his hands.
[2:35:18] He praised God
[2:35:20] together with the elders and all the
[2:35:23] heavens
[2:35:25] and the earth and all that was under the
[2:35:28] earth
[2:35:29] had him praised.
[2:35:34] It takes confidence.
[2:35:37] When you have seen your name,
[2:35:40] you will not say amen.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; No sir, how will you say?
[2:35:49] God bless you. Heaven will hear you.
[2:35:53] Earth will hear you. Under the earth
[2:35:55] they hear you. You have got the
[2:35:57] confidence. The lamb has slaying for
[2:36:01] you. He has pled his blood upon you. And
[2:36:06] before God there is no condemnation.
[2:36:11] Then you can say hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Shalom.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Let the pastor tell you what comes up
[2:36:19] after in the afternoon service.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; Let us stand up and sing that song. We
[2:36:29] are children.
[2:36:30] Each of us praise to God. Having heard
[2:36:33] your name. I believe you had your name
[2:36:37] personal. I've heard my name.
[2:36:40] And brother Brandham says that one of
[2:36:43] the most exciting thing
[2:36:46] is when you hear your name being
[2:36:47] mentioned in the public
[2:36:50] and the Lord Jesus says
[2:36:53] I will mention their names
[2:36:55] before my father and the holy angels.
[2:36:58] What a glorious thing to hear our names.
[2:37:02] Amen. Amen.

[2:37:08] of the father.
