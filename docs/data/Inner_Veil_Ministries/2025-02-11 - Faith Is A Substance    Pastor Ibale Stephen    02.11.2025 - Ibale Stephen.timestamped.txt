[38:20] &gt;&gt; His [singing and music] blessed.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, a world [screaming] of fire.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; A [music and singing] world of fire.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; I have nothing to fear.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Have nothing.

[38:55] shall ever flow. Halleluah.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; He is the living. He's the lady
[39:02] [singing] of the [music]
[39:03] &gt;&gt; bright and morning star.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; The bright and morning star.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he's the [singing] per [music]
[39:11] 10,000
[39:13] to my soul.
[39:18] Amen. [music]
[39:21] [applause]
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[39:29] I greet you in the precious name of our
[39:31] Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:35] Amen. Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to be back home again.
[39:41] Whenever I'm not here,
[39:45] I'm somewhere
[39:47] trying the best to do to serve the Lord.
[39:52] So, it's uh the grace of God for us to
[39:55] be back together again.
[39:59] Amen. Amen. And trusting that this grace
[40:03] may speak to us.
[40:06] We want to appreciate the great things
[40:08] that God has been doing
[40:13] especially amongst us.
[40:16] We thank God for sister Mary.
[40:20] Amen.
[40:24] She never misses service.
[40:27] She was just out of surgery the other
[40:29] day
[40:32] and she's here today.
[40:34] Amen. Amen. That's total commitment.
[40:41] Cancer
[40:44] and I trust that the Lord
[40:47] has prepared a healing for you.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. that you walk out here
[40:57] and testify of the grace of God.
[41:01] Amen.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; So we appreciate the service,
[41:06] &gt;&gt; brother Joshua for the singing.
[41:10] Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; We appreciate brother Wilson.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Sunday school.
[41:18] Amen. And we should always be in time
[41:23] that we may always be part of the Sunday
[41:25] school
[41:28] because it's part of the church program.
[41:32] Amen. Amen. Can you say it's not a
[41:35] blessing being late in church?
[41:39] How many know that?
[41:41] That it's not a blessing to be late in
[41:43] church.
[41:47] People don't know.
[41:49] But I know it's not a blessing being
[41:52] late in church.
[41:56] Amen. Amen. We rejoice together with
[41:58] brother Adam.
[42:01] Amen. Amen. [applause]
[42:06] He's trying to project into what they
[42:08] call a man.
[42:12] Amen. Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Steven
[42:16] was telling me
[42:18] I was the one who dedicated sister
[42:21] patience.
[42:23] Patience
[42:24] &gt;&gt; but I just cannot recollect.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know there are many kids that
[42:33] come through
[42:39] and some many people come to be
[42:41] baptized.
[42:44] But it's a blessing.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:47] when they hold her
[42:52] &gt;&gt; and we are happy to see sister patience
[42:55] patience.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That she's holding.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Just do one thing for me this morning
[43:04] for me as I talk to you.
[43:07] Amen. Amen. Sometimes I preach,
[43:11] sometimes I teach,
[43:14] &gt;&gt; but sometimes I encourage.
[43:17] And I feel the way I need to come this
[43:20] morning
[43:22] is to encourage the church
[43:26] that one of these days
[43:28] we shall behold
[43:30] and for every troubles we have along the
[43:33] way.
[43:36] God has prepared a solution
[43:40] and it's only your faith
[43:42] that can bring the solution down.
[43:47] Amen. How many of you have faith today?
[43:51] I do. If I don't have faith,
[43:54] I wouldn't be here.
[43:57] Faith brought me in.
[44:00] Faith will keep me in.
[44:03] faith will take me to the end of the
[44:05] journey.
[44:09] Amen. We thank God for perfect faith
[44:13] upon which our salvation is found.
[44:18] Amen. Faith is our foundation.
[44:22] So we thank God for the pastor.
[44:27] Amen.
[44:28] And the labors of service.
[44:33] May the Lord bless you.
[44:36] As a pastor,
[44:38] he has a responsibility to pastor the
[44:40] people.
[44:43] And you know to pastor, you have to go
[44:45] certain directions.
[44:49] Amen. So when you listen to me, you are
[44:52] not listening to the pastor.
[44:55] I'm totally different cut.
[44:59] Amen. But all together is one ministry,
[45:05] the ministry of Christ.
[45:07] Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand up
[45:11] and get into a scripture reading.
[45:15] Amen.
[45:16] He that cometh to him
[45:20] must believe that is he
[45:23] and is the reward
[45:26] of those that diligently seek him.
[45:31] And this morning we've got diligent
[45:33] seekers before his presence.
[45:37] Are you seeking diligently this morning?
[45:40] And may the Lord reward you.
[45:44] Amen. God bless you, brother Mut.
[45:47] I think he drives the longest to be in
[45:49] church
[45:52] and is always very persistent.
[45:57] Amen. The Lord bless him so much.
[46:00] Amen. Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews
[46:04] chapter 11
[46:06] and verse one.
[46:08] Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; If you have got any today
[46:13] is a solution in glory.
[46:16] Amen. Amen. You see that deep cause to
[46:19] the deep.
[46:21] You can't be crying
[46:24] before the Lord without an answer
[46:28] being somewhere.
[46:30] Amen. Amen. It would break the laws of
[46:33] faith
[46:35] because faith is the substance
[46:38] of things that we are patiently waiting
[46:41] for.
[46:44] Amen. Amen. So, Hebrews chapter 11
[46:49] and verse one.
[46:52] But let us have a word of prayer.
[46:55] Heavenly Father, we want to give thanks
[46:58] to you this morning
[47:00] because your grace
[47:02] has brought us into your presence.
[47:06] We thank you for the doorway of the
[47:10] blood
[47:12] that washes us clean.
[47:15] And father, when we get before your
[47:17] presence,
[47:19] you just keep looking at us through the
[47:21] blood.
[47:23] Thank you for the perfection of grace
[47:27] that you have given to us. And it's that
[47:31] by which we come.
[47:33] And we pray that you may speak to us
[47:36] this morning
[47:38] as you speak to son,
[47:41] as you speak to your children
[47:44] with grace and favor,
[47:48] father that you may make everything work
[47:51] the way you said it will.
[47:56] We bring the needs Lord
[47:58] at the foot of the cross
[48:01] trusting heavenly father that when we
[48:04] walk out of here
[48:06] will be a testimony in our lives
[48:09] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Verse one of
[48:13] Hebrews 11.
[48:16] Now,
[48:18] not tomorrow,
[48:21] not yesterday,
[48:23] but now.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Now.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of things hoped
[48:33] for.
[48:36] The evidence of things
[48:39] not seen.
[48:44] May the Lord add blessing the reading of
[48:45] his word.
[48:48] You may be seated.
[48:50] So I want to speak on the subject of
[48:54] substance.
[49:00] Substance
[49:03] and you know substance is an evidence.
[49:10] This is substance
[49:14] and is an evidence.
[49:17] Amen. Amen. So substance is a very
[49:21] interesting subject
[49:24] and I pray that the Lord may pour
[49:29] revelation and understanding
[49:32] not for only this service
[49:35] but for our journey
[49:39] all the way into eternity.
[49:42] Now substance
[49:44] means that which has actual existence.
[49:51] And Paul says as long as his substance
[49:57] it's an evidence.
[50:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; It means
[50:03] we are dealing with something.
[50:07] Something that you somehow heard before.
[50:13] And therefore you're looking for
[50:16] substance.
[50:20] And once you get that substance,
[50:24] it's the evidence
[50:26] that you have what you've been hoping
[50:28] for.
[50:30] Amen. So substance
[50:34] actually is the existence
[50:38] of something
[50:40] and hope in this particular scripture
[50:45] is not maybe or may not be
[50:51] because in the human language
[50:54] hope is maybe
[50:58] and hope may also being may not be
[51:05] but in the divine language
[51:08] hope is just the patience
[51:12] that you have invested
[51:15] in waiting for the promise
[51:18] because the promise is there
[51:21] is an evidence. Are you together with
[51:24] me? It's a substance.
[51:26] So people pray
[51:29] and they think what they are praying for
[51:32] as long as they in the will of God.
[51:36] But yet at the same time
[51:39] they are not sure whether what they are
[51:41] praying for will come
[51:44] or will not come.
[51:46] Faith says
[51:48] it will come.
[51:51] Amen. Amen. So faith brings into
[51:53] existence
[51:57] the things that were ordained along our
[52:00] life's journey.
[52:03] As long as God ordained you and elected
[52:06] you as a son of God,
[52:10] there are certain things along the
[52:12] junctions of time
[52:16] that God has ordained for you to pull
[52:18] down
[52:22] to support you along that journey.
[52:26] Are you together with me? That's why we
[52:29] pray
[52:31] because faith
[52:33] prepared an answer for you.
[52:36] Amen. When the children of Israel pray
[52:41] and they were suffering in Egypt,
[52:44] God in his predestinated plan
[52:48] had planned a Moses.
[52:51] So Moses just come into existence.
[52:55] is the answer to the prayers of the
[52:57] children of God.
[53:00] So your path, your earthly path
[53:05] was seen of God
[53:07] and you came into the path of life
[53:11] to be tried
[53:13] in certain areas of your life.
[53:17] The prophet says we come from the
[53:20] attribute
[53:23] into the flesh to be tested. Are you
[53:27] together with me? Yes. That's why we
[53:29] come into this flesh.
[53:32] We come from the attribute
[53:35] into this flesh to be tried. And when we
[53:40] overcome, we get back home. But we were
[53:44] not brought here
[53:46] to be tried and fail.
[53:49] We were brought here to be tried and
[53:53] perfected by those trials.
[53:57] For as we go through trials,
[54:00] THERE WILL BE some cry.
[54:02] And as you cry, there will be answers
[54:06] that will be dropping
[54:09] from eternity to support YOU ALONG YOUR
[54:12] LIFESPAN.
[54:15] AMEN.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Without which we would never make it.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But God has
[54:23] prepared
[54:25] and has ordained answers to your prayer.
[54:30] As long as you pull.
[54:33] Amen. And you are pulling simply BECAUSE
[54:38] that's the only WAY YOU ARE GOING TO
[54:40] MAKE IT.
[54:42] God will not hide himself away from you.
[54:47] FAITH is a substance.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis
[54:54] &gt;&gt; and try to use Genesis chapter 15
[54:59] and verse 13
[55:02] to understand what I'm talking about.
[55:06] The scripture said, "And he said unto
[55:10] Abraham,
[55:12] This is God now.
[55:15] He's talking to Abraham.
[55:18] He's not talking to Abraham.
[55:21] He's talking to Abraham.
[55:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Before his
[55:25] change of the body come.
[55:28] Amen. He's talking to a man whose change
[55:32] was coming on
[55:35] but had not come yet. And he says, "Know
[55:38] of assured
[55:41] that thy seed shall be a stranger
[55:45] in a land that's not theirs,
[55:48] and shall serve them,
[55:51] and they shall affect them for afflict
[55:54] them 400 years.
[55:59] And also that nation
[56:02] whom they shall serve
[56:05] will lie judge.
[56:07] and afterward
[56:10] they shall come with great substance.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I said, God [screaming]
[56:20] is talking to Abraham.
[56:23] This man here
[56:25] does not have the seed
[56:28] that he expects to have
[56:30] because God had promised a child.
[56:34] God is speaking about gratitude.
[56:39] Amen. Meaning that the sun
[56:43] was a substance
[56:45] that was somehow somewhere
[56:49] which was only waiting for time.
[56:53] That substance
[56:56] are you together with me? So faith is
[56:59] the substance.
[57:02] FAITH OF ABRAHAM
[57:04] WAS A SUBSTANCE
[57:06] that was in AN
[57:10] substance
[57:12] was a son and he was called Isaac.
[57:16] And when the season came because with
[57:20] faith you have to wait
[57:22] FOR THE SUBSTANCE
[57:24] TO COME DOWN.
[57:28] I thought somebody would say
[57:32] I love that.
[57:33] Amen. So now God here to Abraham
[57:38] is mapping his path
[57:42] and that of his seed after him.
[57:46] God
[57:48] was a substance.
[57:51] JACOB WAS A SUBSTANCE.
[57:53] THE PATRIARCHS were substance
[57:57] of the patriarch.
[57:59] They existed in a realm
[58:02] and now Abraham
[58:04] needed just to wait.
[58:08] Faith
[58:10] &gt;&gt; is the substance of things
[58:14] TO FALL. AND THEREFORE BY FAITH Abraham
[58:22] praise the Lord. to the path who is
[58:26] being prepared
[58:28] and he's speaking to Abraham
[58:31] not about me
[58:36] but he's speaking to him about substance
[58:40] and he's talking him about distance of
[58:43] time
[58:48] substance
[58:49] of things HOPED FOR [screaming]
[58:54] THEY exist in a rim
[58:57] and time brings them
[59:00] at the right time.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is mapping out this path
[59:07] and that of the seed after him
[59:11] to the path through Isaac,
[59:14] Jacob, and then through the 12 pat
[59:18] that made the nation of Israel.
[59:22] So God is looking at them
[59:26] 400 years of trial
[59:30] till they come back again to Canaan
[59:33] and God sees their seasons
[59:37] and God sees their trials.
[59:41] Amen. Sometimes we get into situations
[59:45] and you begin to think like God does not
[59:48] care.
[59:51] But God cares
[59:54] for every step of your life.
[59:57] And when the time comes for you to cry,
[1:00:02] THE SUBSTANCE COMES BACK.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. God works with Jesus.
[1:00:10] Amen. So they developed faith.
[1:00:14] Amen. So God mapped out
[1:00:18] what they needed in answer to their
[1:00:20] trial
[1:00:23] during the 400 years of captivity.
[1:00:28] Amen. That answer
[1:00:32] was waiting looming somewhere.
[1:00:36] Let me tell you and the ANSWER TO THE
[1:00:40] CRYO OF THE children of Israel
[1:00:43] was going to work by Moses.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So Moses could
[1:00:50] not come 200 years before.
[1:00:54] He had come directly at the right spot
[1:00:58] because he was going to be the answer to
[1:01:00] the prayers of the people.
[1:01:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sometimes you
[1:01:06] think you're desperate
[1:01:08] as long as you are a child of God.
[1:01:11] Brother say your path has been MARKED
[1:01:16] AND THE TIME YOU CRY
[1:01:19] HAS BEEN WAITING.
[1:01:21] It's the substance.
[1:01:24] Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, praise God. We
[1:01:27] just need to trust that God cared for us
[1:01:32] even before the foundation of THE WORLD.
[1:01:36] HE KNEW WHEN YOU CRY FOR school
[1:01:39] and he made sure that when you cry it
[1:01:42] will come.
[1:01:45] HE KNEW WHEN YOU CRY FOR YOUR RENT
[1:01:49] AND WHEN YOU CRY GOD WILL ALWAYS put our
[1:01:52] faith.
[1:01:54] Faith is a substance.
[1:01:57] Amen. If it's NOT SUBSTANCE
[1:02:01] THEN OUR FAITH would fail.
[1:02:05] Amen. They devolved faith
[1:02:09] for what God had already reserved for
[1:02:12] them in eternity.
[1:02:15] Amen. Come in the right season.
[1:02:19] So he saw their path
[1:02:21] and revealed it to Abraham.
[1:02:25] He says,"Abraham, come here. I'm going
[1:02:28] to show you the substance
[1:02:31] that's waiting up yonder.
[1:02:35] Amen. He says your sin will be taken by
[1:02:40] a strange people
[1:02:42] in captivity
[1:02:44] 400 years. After that I'm going to bring
[1:02:48] them out with a mighty heart.
[1:02:51] Abraham would ask my seed I DON'T HAVE
[1:02:56] ANY CHILDREN.
[1:02:58] BUT THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
[1:03:00] WERE UNSEEN SUBSTANCE. [screaming]
[1:03:05] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. And along the
[1:03:07] way as you go
[1:03:09] in your life's journey blessing now
[1:03:14] may not be visible,
[1:03:17] but it is a service
[1:03:19] in an invisible real.
[1:03:22] WHEN THE SEASON COMES AND YOU PRAY, GOD
[1:03:26] BEGINS to remen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; On the same token,
[1:03:37] listen. God had given Joseph
[1:03:41] the preview of his life.
[1:03:44] And when Joseph entered his trials,
[1:03:48] he knew the trials
[1:03:50] were not the end
[1:03:53] of his life.
[1:03:56] [laughter]
[1:03:57] He said,
[1:04:00] you know, the ships will bow,
[1:04:04] the stars will bow,
[1:04:07] the moon, the sun.
[1:04:09] Amen. And you know, I mean, Jesus
[1:04:13] knew
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; that that glory
[1:04:17] was only awaiting substantial.
[1:04:25] Are you together with him?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; He knew that the GLORY
[1:04:30] WHERE HIS brothers bow
[1:04:33] WHERE THE SON BOWS, HIS father
[1:04:40] It's just a matter of time.
[1:04:43] So faith
[1:04:45] in that area was a substance
[1:04:50] that Joseph HAD TO PATIENTLY WAIT FOR.
[1:04:57] AMEN. There are certain things that have
[1:05:00] been given to us in scripture.
[1:05:04] And when you study the scripture, you
[1:05:07] realize the promises of God to you
[1:05:11] as substance.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now Joseph,
[1:05:23] he kept calling for his deliverance to
[1:05:25] come,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; but in season
[1:05:29] he went in the pit
[1:05:33] with a vision.
[1:05:35] He was sought to the Israelite,
[1:05:40] and he went,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; but with a vision,
[1:05:44] he became a slave
[1:05:46] in the house of Portifer,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; but with a vision.
[1:05:50] He went to prison but with a vision.
[1:05:54] Hallelujah. The vision always stood
[1:05:56] before him.
[1:05:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let the vision
[1:06:02] of the GLORY OF GOD
[1:06:04] ALWAYS STAND BEFORE YOU.
[1:06:07] Let the vision of your adoption
[1:06:11] before you. Trials will come.
[1:06:15] Keep that vision alive.
[1:06:18] You may go DOWN IN THE PIT.
[1:06:21] KEEP THAT VISION ALIVE.
[1:06:23] You may stumble somewhere.
[1:06:26] KEEP THAT VISION.
[1:06:29] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHEN YOU
[1:06:32] FALL BACK,
[1:06:34] the vision is NOT THERE
[1:06:37] CALLED AS A SON of God.
[1:06:40] PERFECTION
[1:06:41] IS A SUBSTANCE.
[1:06:47] And you say Lord,
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; it's a matter of season
[1:06:53] overcome this condition.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's go to
[1:07:00] Psalms here.
[1:07:02] And every form of deliverance he needed
[1:07:08] was hidden as by God
[1:07:12] as a substance
[1:07:14] that needed to be revealed in season.
[1:07:20] Brother Joshua,
[1:07:22] you may cry sometimes
[1:07:25] just because the season
[1:07:28] has not come here yet.
[1:07:31] [laughter]
[1:07:32] Sister Beatrice,
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; you may cry sometimes
[1:07:36] because the season has not come.
[1:07:40] YOUR FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE
[1:07:44] is not your mental attitude
[1:07:48] but is a substance.
[1:07:51] that would only come in existence
[1:07:55] because the season is right.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Psalms 105
[1:08:08] and verse 17.
[1:08:10] The Holy Spirit says, "He sent a man
[1:08:14] before them,
[1:08:16] even Joseph who was sold for a servant.
[1:08:23] HE SENT A MAN BEFORE THEM.
[1:08:26] And this man was sold as a slave,
[1:08:30] but he was PART OF THE PLAN OF GOD.
[1:08:35] What are you going through?
[1:08:37] DON'T C YOUR BROTHER.
[1:08:40] DON'T C YOUR BROTHER.
[1:08:42] DON'T C YOUR sister
[1:08:45] because they are responsible
[1:08:48] for what you are going through.
[1:08:50] No, IT WAS NOT HIS PARENTS. They were
[1:08:55] responsible.
[1:08:56] God used THEM
[1:09:00] ahead
[1:09:01] of substance.
[1:09:06] Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] Thus they would need
[1:09:10] WHEN THE TIME FOR CRYING COMES.
[1:09:14] HE HAD TO SEND JOSEPH AHEAD OF HIM.
[1:09:18] HE WAS PART OF THE GREATER vast
[1:09:22] that had come to Abraham.
[1:09:25] And now Joseph he wonders how he fix it.
[1:09:30] But then all the time HE HAS TO HOLD THE
[1:09:33] VISION
[1:09:35] THAT VISION SUBSTANTIAL.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; So he says verse eight in whose feet
[1:09:46] they hurt with fetters.
[1:09:50] He was laid in iron
[1:09:56] until the time that his word came.
[1:10:02] THE WORD OF THE LORD TRIED IT.
[1:10:07] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WHATEVER YOU ARE
[1:10:09] GOING THROUGH, THE word allows you to be
[1:10:14] tried
[1:10:16] until the word of the Lord
[1:10:19] comes to your substance.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; You may spend sleepless nights.
[1:10:30] But that's part of the journey.
[1:10:35] Keep holding the faith alive.
[1:10:39] Never allow
[1:10:41] the situation you go through.
[1:10:44] Ever try to change your attitude
[1:10:49] about your breath.
[1:10:51] Because if you are a CHILD OF GOD,
[1:10:55] ALL things work together for good.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU EVER TURN YOUR MAN
[1:11:04] AGAINST your brother. I wouldn't be
[1:11:07] suffering
[1:11:09] if it were not for my brethren.
[1:11:12] They sold me to Joseph.
[1:11:14] Now I mean the fetas
[1:11:16] and the fetas are hurting
[1:11:19] that it required that
[1:11:22] to prepare the substance
[1:11:25] ahead of them.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; you know, we are so quick
[1:11:36] to say things about people
[1:11:40] and think that maybe if it were not for
[1:11:42] so and so,
[1:11:45] I would do not been in such such a
[1:11:46] situation.
[1:11:49] God allowed that
[1:11:52] to reveal his blessing ahead of time.
[1:11:57] Joseph's path
[1:11:59] was seen
[1:12:01] and described in dreams.
[1:12:08] He goes to his brethren, I had a dream
[1:12:12] and then he goes there another time
[1:12:15] yet another dream
[1:12:18] and yet another dream. So under the same
[1:12:21] token,
[1:12:22] the path of an elect
[1:12:26] is MARKED ALONG YOUR PATH JOURNEY.
[1:12:30] And all that was ordained for you
[1:12:35] is in store
[1:12:38] as substance.
[1:12:43] We are NOT GOING TO PASS the same
[1:12:45] journey.
[1:12:48] Much as the destination is the same,
[1:12:53] the trials will not be the same
[1:12:56] and the blessings will not be the same.
[1:13:00] Are you together with me? GOD HIMSELF
[1:13:03] WHO PREPARED YOUR PATH.
[1:13:06] HE KNOWS at what junction
[1:13:09] he needs to come down.
[1:13:12] and be able to hold your hand.
[1:13:15] Amen. By providing THE ANSWER
[1:13:19] IN YOUR PRAYER. When Israel cried, he
[1:13:23] told Moses, "I have heard and I have
[1:13:26] seen I AM COME DOWN, BUT you are the
[1:13:30] hand of
[1:13:35] Praise the Lord."
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; And by grace
[1:13:40] God
[1:13:41] has led predestinated faith
[1:13:47] which can reach out
[1:13:49] and possess your inheritance
[1:13:54] and all that you need
[1:13:57] to empower you along your calling.
[1:14:05] Never think that you get to a point
[1:14:11] and you in a stuck situation
[1:14:15] and there's no answer.
[1:14:17] There will always be an answer.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; This journey here is not your labor.
[1:14:27] It's a predestinated journey.
[1:14:31] God knows how you are going to go
[1:14:36] and the situation that you are suffering
[1:14:38] from now.
[1:14:42] He knows. BUT HOW DOES he bring the
[1:14:45] answer?
[1:14:47] YOUR FAITH WHILE YOU'RE CRYING in that
[1:14:50] situation
[1:14:52] becomes the creative anointing
[1:14:56] to bring down an answer for you.
[1:15:01] Amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Listen to what brother Brham says
[1:15:06] in the adoption message part three.
[1:15:11] Listen here we begin to come.
[1:15:15] See predestinated us
[1:15:18] to our inheritance
[1:15:22] in him
[1:15:24] which was predestinated to us.
[1:15:27] WE INHERITED IT BEFORE THE foundation of
[1:15:31] the world
[1:15:35] for his own purpose.
[1:15:38] Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For his own what
[1:15:42] for his own purpose
[1:15:45] to work out his own good will
[1:15:50] to be a God savior.
[1:15:54] Amen. Amen. Which means
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; we did not come here
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; as products
[1:16:04] of cano union.
[1:16:10] Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:16:15] Adam was a creation. Adam,
[1:16:21] Eve was a creation
[1:16:24] because they come from God.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; But Cain
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; was a product
[1:16:32] of a car union
[1:16:38] in him. There was no seed of God.
[1:16:42] Therefore, he didn't come from God. His
[1:16:45] path
[1:16:46] did not have a predestinated
[1:16:49] journey.
[1:16:54] at you as a seed of God.
[1:16:58] Who has got A SEED OF GOD IN YOU
[1:17:04] predestinated
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; to SUCH AN EXTENT
[1:17:10] THAT you come
[1:17:13] to inherit your I mean to to inherit
[1:17:16] your adoption.
[1:17:20] Your adoption
[1:17:22] was NOT PREPARED WHEN YOU COME INTO THE
[1:17:24] FLESH,
[1:17:27] BUT IT WAS ORDAINED OF GOD.
[1:17:31] THEREFORE, WHEN YOU COME, IT EXISTS.
[1:17:34] YOU COME TO POSSESS those possessions.
[1:17:40] AMEN.
[1:17:41] AND BECAUSE YOU ARE ADOPTED CHILD OF GOD
[1:17:44] AND you are you are an elected child of
[1:17:46] God,
[1:17:49] there is something in you which cries
[1:17:52] above.
[1:17:56] When you seem like you ARE IN THE DARK
[1:17:58] spot
[1:18:01] and you HAVE COME TO A JUNCTION
[1:18:04] and you don't know where to go, THERE IS
[1:18:07] SOMETHING in you that has always cried.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; The rest of the world know.
[1:18:22] But you as A CHILD OF GOD,
[1:18:25] YOU know when you are lost,
[1:18:28] you know when you've lost your path
[1:18:31] AND YOU BEGIN TO CRY
[1:18:34] AND YOU SAY, "ABA, FATHER."
[1:18:38] AND EACH TIME YOU CRY, A VOICE COMES
[1:18:41] FROM HEAVEN AND SAYS, "THIS IS THE WAY.
[1:18:45] WALK YE IN IT."
[1:18:49] THERE ARE SO MANY times
[1:18:51] when you seem to have lost your path
[1:18:55] and you lose your peace.
[1:18:57] You don't have joy. YOU KEEP CRYING AND
[1:19:01] THEN SOMEHOW a voice comes and speaks to
[1:19:06] you. Do this
[1:19:10] AND YOU TURN
[1:19:12] YOU BEGIN TO walk right.
[1:19:15] WHEN THE JOY COMES BACK, THE PEACE COMES
[1:19:18] BACK. God for his children has ordained
[1:19:24] particular positions.
[1:19:27] Amen. Where they ARE GOING TO CALL
[1:19:30] CERTAIN answers
[1:19:32] to come.
[1:19:37] Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:45] I tell you God is good.
[1:19:49] Let us deal with substance a little bit.
[1:19:53] You see along the pilgrim journey of the
[1:19:55] church,
[1:19:58] God allowed the shadows
[1:20:02] to declare
[1:20:04] the existence
[1:20:06] of substance.
[1:20:11] Have you heard that?
[1:20:14] that along
[1:20:18] the prim journey of the church,
[1:20:22] God allowed church
[1:20:27] to declare the presence of substance
[1:20:33] and faith
[1:20:35] gives you the confidence
[1:20:38] TO PULL DOWN THE substance
[1:20:42] along. ong your life's journey.
[1:20:45] That's why
[1:20:47] FAITH NEVER FAILS to deliver
[1:20:52] because it's dealing with substance.
[1:20:59] THAT'S WHY FAITH NEVER FAILS
[1:21:03] BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEALING WITH myth
[1:21:07] is dealing with substance
[1:21:11] and that FAITH HAS GOT ENOUGH POWER
[1:21:16] to create that substance.
[1:21:21] Yes.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Faith is not Faith
[1:21:29] is not an evidence only.
[1:21:34] Uhuh. Faith is not
[1:21:40] [laughter]
[1:21:42] faith is not online evidence.
[1:21:47] It is a substance.
[1:21:50] Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So faith
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; is not only an evidence.
[1:22:02] Yeah. Yeah. Faith faith will
[1:22:07] say faith is also a substance.
[1:22:15] Faith itself is a substance.
[1:22:19] evidence of things
[1:22:21] that the senses of the body
[1:22:25] won't declare.
[1:22:29] Your senses
[1:22:31] will not touch it,
[1:22:33] but it's there. Your eyes will not see
[1:22:37] it, but it's there.
[1:22:45] I'll take you to this message of faith
[1:22:46] in God.
[1:22:49] HE SAYS NOW
[1:22:51] SOME think
[1:22:54] that it's an emot I mean a mental
[1:22:57] conception of the word
[1:23:02] but that's not right
[1:23:06] is a substance
[1:23:09] I want you to mention that
[1:23:12] faith is
[1:23:16] I want to hear That
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; faith is a substance.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Faith is a substance.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Faith is not a myth.
[1:23:29] Faith is a substance of things hoped
[1:23:32] for. [screaming]
[1:23:37] Meaning that it's a substance
[1:23:41] that you are only patiently waiting to
[1:23:45] achieve.
[1:23:51] Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; He says to have an evidence.
[1:24:01] It must be a substance.
[1:24:05] So it's NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT you
[1:24:07] imagine in your mind.
[1:24:11] It is something that absolutely
[1:24:16] You HAVE
[1:24:19] [laughter]
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; You have it.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; But momentarily,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; it's being held by the heavenly bank.
[1:24:34] Okay. So, is something that you possess
[1:24:39] in your own being
[1:24:42] and what is it?
[1:24:45] It's the evidence of THINGS
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU have hoped for.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of things
[1:24:54] you do not have as yet,
[1:24:56] but you have the authority of God
[1:25:01] to say that you have it.
[1:25:04] Amen. It's an evidence something you
[1:25:08] have in your heart.
[1:25:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Faith is a substance.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; The reason why
[1:25:26] something in you
[1:25:29] gives you confidence as you pray
[1:25:33] is because
[1:25:35] your answer is a substance.
[1:25:39] It's only going to come
[1:25:42] in the right time.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; So let me put a powerful statement here
[1:25:53] that the God who created you
[1:25:57] predestinated for a certain path.
[1:26:02] He also saw the challenges along the way
[1:26:08] and fitted you with enough faith.
[1:26:14] to speak solutions along the way.
[1:26:19] IF YOU CAN SETTLE THIS MOUNTAIN,
[1:26:23] you have mountains along THE WAY.
[1:26:26] IF YOU SAY TO THIS MOUTH,
[1:26:29] not that the pastor says it for you,
[1:26:33] but if you say,
[1:26:36] you've got creative anointing.
[1:26:40] Amen. And we CALL IT FAITH.
[1:26:44] Faith is a creative power.
[1:26:48] So we are not dealing with the shadows.
[1:26:52] When we deal with faith,
[1:26:54] we are not dealing with shadows.
[1:26:57] We are dealing with the substance.
[1:27:02] We are not dealing with shadows of
[1:27:04] Christ.
[1:27:06] But we are dealing with the substance
[1:27:08] Christ himself,
[1:27:12] the person of the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Because in the Old Testament,
[1:27:22] WE'VE GOT SHADOWS THAT SPOKE OF.
[1:27:26] We've got the lamb.
[1:27:29] We've got the feast.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; We've got THE SACRIFICES.
[1:27:34] ALL those things were shadows.
[1:27:37] But thank God that faith has brought the
[1:27:41] article himself down to us.
[1:27:47] Amen. We are not dealing with shadows.
[1:27:50] We are dealing with the person of the
[1:27:52] Lord JESUS CHRIST
[1:27:56] who got a creative power
[1:28:00] and a creative anointing
[1:28:02] that sits on the inside of your heart.
[1:28:08] We are not dealing with the chemistry of
[1:28:10] the blood
[1:28:13] but the life himself.
[1:28:16] Are you together with me? I'm trying TO
[1:28:19] TAKE AWAY
[1:28:21] THAT MENTALITY,
[1:28:23] that faith is what you just think
[1:28:27] and then you pray for.
[1:28:38] Okay, let us talk about the Old
[1:28:40] Testament shadows.
[1:28:43] Let's go to Hebrews chapter 10
[1:28:47] and verse one.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; For the law,
[1:28:54] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:29:03] and not the very image of things
[1:29:09] can never with those sacrifices
[1:29:13] which they offered year by year
[1:29:19] make the overcome as they run to perfect
[1:29:26] says
[1:29:28] the law was a shadow
[1:29:31] of things
[1:29:34] of circumstances.
[1:29:39] that existed in the divine dimension,
[1:29:44] but then with time
[1:29:47] they would be released
[1:29:50] into manifestation.
[1:29:54] So the New Testament
[1:29:57] is those shadows
[1:30:00] putting on flesh.
[1:30:04] Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to pick me very well here.
[1:30:08] CHRIST THE SHADOW, for example,
[1:30:13] stepped forth from the shadows
[1:30:20] and John recognized him
[1:30:24] throughout the Old Testament.
[1:30:27] He was hiding in a shadow
[1:30:30] of a lamp.
[1:30:33] But then when it come to reality,
[1:30:36] John says, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:30:40] that take away the sins of God."
[1:30:44] So Christ in the shadows of atonement,
[1:30:48] stepped forth on Calvary,
[1:30:51] and died for our sins
[1:30:54] once for all.
[1:30:57] And today is the propation of our sins.
[1:31:03] SO A SHADOW COMES forth
[1:31:06] because light
[1:31:09] light
[1:31:10] is striking on an object somewhere.
[1:31:17] So the light
[1:31:20] would BE HITTING ON THE OBJECT
[1:31:24] IS HITTING ON THE SUBSTANCE.
[1:31:28] AND BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT ON THE
[1:31:30] SUBSTANCE,
[1:31:32] it sets down a shadow.
[1:31:38] So a shadow
[1:31:41] just you know declares
[1:31:45] THAT THERE IS SUBSTANCE
[1:31:48] which is existing somewhere.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; If you are in the house alone,
[1:31:58] Maybe like this church, we have a big
[1:32:00] compound
[1:32:02] and when you are here alone, maybe you
[1:32:05] are studying or praying
[1:32:08] and then you see a shadow
[1:32:10] of a tall big man.
[1:32:13] You don't expect to see a snake
[1:32:15] crawling.
[1:32:20] It's a man
[1:32:23] and you need to be worried.
[1:32:29] Who is this? Is it a brother?
[1:32:32] Is a shadow is declaring
[1:32:36] a coming object?
[1:32:40] [laughter]
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So in the mind of God,
[1:32:48] listen,
[1:32:50] Christ existed
[1:32:53] and so the light of revelation
[1:32:58] released these shadows
[1:33:02] as a lamp.
[1:33:08] And in the days of atonement,
[1:33:11] it was the lamb, the lamb, the lamb.
[1:33:16] a shadow. But when the New Testament
[1:33:19] came
[1:33:21] when the season had come
[1:33:24] AFTER THE FULLNESS OF TIME,
[1:33:27] the shadow produced the person of the
[1:33:29] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33:33] Meaning that this Lord Jesus CHRIST
[1:33:38] existing somewhere.
[1:33:43] was just released because the season had
[1:33:46] come.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; There is something I want to bring out
[1:33:53] here.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I want to go with you.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. In first Peter chapter one
[1:34:01] and verse 19.
[1:34:06] This is what Peter says.
[1:34:09] But with the precious blood of Christ,
[1:34:14] as of a lamb without blemish
[1:34:19] and without spot.
[1:34:23] Who very
[1:34:25] WAS FORAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of
[1:34:28] the world,
[1:34:33] but was manifest in these last times for
[1:34:36] you.
[1:34:43] HE WAS EXISTING IN THE MIND OF GOD.
[1:34:48] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. That the
[1:34:50] fullness of TIME
[1:34:53] came from the mind.
[1:34:56] Amen. TO THE MANIFESTATION.
[1:35:00] BUT FIRST OF ALL, IT HAS BEEN declared
[1:35:03] by the shadows
[1:35:07] that pertain to WHO CHRIST IS.
[1:35:10] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE WAS ORDAINED
[1:35:14] IN THE MIND of God
[1:35:17] come forth in this season.
[1:35:19] So faith,
[1:35:22] PRAISE GOD,
[1:35:24] deals with a spiritual substance
[1:35:31] that exist a substance
[1:35:35] in the mind of God
[1:35:38] AND FACE
[1:35:40] THE SUBSTANCES
[1:35:42] into the natural real.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. AND GOD BLESSED YOU HERE.
[1:35:51] You come from his mind
[1:35:54] so that you can be ABLE TO OVERCOME
[1:35:56] THAT ALONG YOUR JOURNEY. HE SAW THE
[1:35:59] CHALLENGES.
[1:36:05] AMEN. HE SAW THE CHALLENGE of Elijah
[1:36:09] and he prepared the window woman.
[1:36:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. WITH A LITTLE
[1:36:15] FLOUR AND A LITTLE OIL.
[1:36:19] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. TO ELIJAH. GO TO
[1:36:23] CERTAIN SUCH A PLACE.
[1:36:26] FIND A window woman
[1:36:28] to your prayer.
[1:36:33] Faith
[1:36:35] is a substance.
[1:36:38] [laughter]
[1:36:39] Faith therefore
[1:36:41] has creative power.
[1:36:45] Let me show you here in the same Jesus
[1:36:48] tonight.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus of Nazareth,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; send forth thy spirit tonight.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Thy creating spirit
[1:37:04] and thy great presence
[1:37:07] to drive back the darkness of the enemy.
[1:37:12] And may ALL THE PEOPLE
[1:37:15] HAVE A CREATIVE power
[1:37:18] in their hearts tonight.
[1:37:20] The power of faith
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; creative.
[1:37:29] Praise God.
[1:37:31] It brings things from the shadows
[1:37:35] into reality in the real
[1:37:41] pull THINGS
[1:37:43] substance
[1:37:45] from the mind of God
[1:37:48] so that THOSE THINGS CAN PUT ON them in
[1:37:52] flesh.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; It is a creative power,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; creative anointing.
[1:38:01] Just like Moses existed in the mind of
[1:38:04] God,
[1:38:06] BUT THE CRY OF THE [screaming] PEOPLE
[1:38:10] BROUGHT HIM DOWN.
[1:38:12] NOT IN THE FIRST 100 YEARS.
[1:38:15] Not in THE NEXT 200 YEARS.
[1:38:18] BUT IN THE right season.
[1:38:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Still
[1:38:25] in the needs of the people.
[1:38:29] Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says,
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; "So was Christ for or dead
[1:38:39] before the foundation of the world,
[1:38:42] but was manifest
[1:38:45] in these last times for you
[1:38:49] in the fullness of time."
[1:38:52] Are you praying over something
[1:38:55] in the fullness of time?
[1:38:59] God
[1:39:02] will never desert his elect.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; He has given you creative anointing
[1:39:14] called faith.
[1:39:17] You pull the substance of deliverance
[1:39:23] and it comes. It takes
[1:39:28] When the season is right,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; faith creates the answers.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to create your job at the
[1:39:38] right time.
[1:39:41] You can be able to create opportunities.
[1:39:46] None of that which was ordained for you
[1:39:49] along your life's journey
[1:39:54] that will ever come to not.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So you just keep in prayer
[1:40:05] EVERY TIME YOUR SITUATION
[1:40:09] this is what I am. He knows what he's
[1:40:11] going to do. HE WILL TELL YOU SUCH AND
[1:40:15] SUCH A PLACE. There is the widow woman.
[1:40:18] Hallelujah. WITH SOME OIL AND SOME I
[1:40:22] mean fl.
[1:40:27] But the problem is we always adise God
[1:40:30] in prayer.
[1:40:37] [laughter]
[1:40:39] That's why it doesn't work.
[1:40:44] Let me take you into this quote.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:40:50] "Where was Jesus lard
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; at Calvary?"
[1:40:57] And he says, "No, sir."
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; was slain before the foundation of the
[1:41:03] world.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS A SUBSTANCE.
[1:41:11] FOR THE CRY OF the sinner.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; THE SUBSTANCE WAS THERE.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; It was waiting
[1:41:26] FOR THE CRY of the sinner.
[1:41:32] He says, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:41:35] that was slain before the foundation OF
[1:41:37] THE WORLD.
[1:41:40] GOD IN THE BEGINNING
[1:41:43] WHEN he saw the scene,
[1:41:46] he saw that what would happen.
[1:41:49] He spoke the word and Jesus was slain
[1:41:54] before the foundation of the world.
[1:41:57] And every person who was saved was
[1:41:59] saved.
[1:42:03] According to the Bible, when the lamb
[1:42:05] was slain,
[1:42:07] the mind of Christ, [screaming]
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; so the lamb was already a substance
[1:42:16] before the foundation of God.
[1:42:19] The prophet says, you included in
[1:42:22] salvation then.
[1:42:26] Hallelujah. In the mind of God,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU COME
[1:42:31] DOWN TO THE ALTAR,
[1:42:33] YOU ARE SAYING LORD FORGIVE ME. You just
[1:42:36] come into real life
[1:42:38] and you are creating
[1:42:41] THE BLOOD OF GOD UPON YOURSELF
[1:42:45] BY FAITH. THE BLOOD BEGINS TO flow upon
[1:42:50] you included in the salvation of God.
[1:42:55] Faith is a substance
[1:42:58] of things hoped.
[1:43:01] God has arranged your path of life
[1:43:06] much as it's not put on paper
[1:43:10] like that of Israel.
[1:43:14] Oh, you'll have a seed. They'll be in a
[1:43:17] foreign land,
[1:43:20] but then I'll come down deliver them.
[1:43:24] Yeah, that was put on paper
[1:43:27] for you to resource faith.
[1:43:31] But that's the way God deals with his
[1:43:33] children.
[1:43:37] He maps their journey.
[1:43:40] Let me tell you another thing. And he
[1:43:43] puts an angel by their side
[1:43:48] to walk this journey.
[1:43:52] Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You will never walk alone.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; He was an elect
[1:44:04] came to an inheritance
[1:44:06] that was already ordained for you.
[1:44:14] You have seen that
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; you know God told Abraham the mind of
[1:44:22] God about Israel.
[1:44:27] Their deliverance
[1:44:30] substance in the mind of God
[1:44:34] and the I mean the coming of Moses
[1:44:37] brought that mind.
[1:44:43] into manifestation.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And God makes it so dramatic.
[1:44:54] It goes for so many years.
[1:44:58] First Abraham goes years without a
[1:45:00] child.
[1:45:04] Then the child was born
[1:45:06] and then it was played out.
[1:45:10] Amen. Like Abraham would slay his son.
[1:45:15] Amen. And God would say no.
[1:45:18] Then comes Jacob
[1:45:20] and then the patriarch
[1:45:22] substance was building up.
[1:45:26] The nation then would go into strange
[1:45:28] land.
[1:45:31] Amen. And when Jacob was aging
[1:45:35] and then blessing his children,
[1:45:38] he demanded that when he's gone on,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; they should not leave his bones
[1:45:48] in a strange land.
[1:45:50] They'll go with those bones.
[1:45:52] He was reminding his
[1:45:56] there is a deliverer
[1:45:59] that was coming on.
[1:46:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; So Joshua.
[1:46:06] Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; What you think to be the end of your
[1:46:09] life
[1:46:12] is just God building the narrative of
[1:46:15] your testimony.
[1:46:20] Amen. Six years
[1:46:25] God is building the narrative.
[1:46:30] Amen. Of sister Mary.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; When you'll meet her, there are no SIGNS
[1:46:38] OF CANCER.
[1:46:40] God has sustained her.
[1:46:44] SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE
[1:46:46] PULLING DOWN her some.
[1:46:50] Amen. And in the right season,
[1:46:54] faith is going to bring the substance.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; What you are faithful
[1:47:05] and falls into line of your calling
[1:47:10] already exists
[1:47:12] in the eternal dimensions of substance.
[1:47:20] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; So I want to talk here about fellowship.
[1:47:27] What we call divine fellowship.
[1:47:32] You know it's not holy
[1:47:35] to come into this fellowship late.
[1:47:40] You need to come in good time
[1:47:43] and build the temple.
[1:47:46] Not the temple.
[1:47:57] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Come and be part of the worship.
[1:48:02] Let the Lord open up your mind with the
[1:48:04] Sunday school
[1:48:07] and that when the minister comes here,
[1:48:11] you already in.
[1:48:16] You see, sometimes when we come to
[1:48:18] church here,
[1:48:20] we treat it as a religious,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; but it's more than that.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you
[1:48:33] that you are in fellowship here this
[1:48:36] morning
[1:48:39] because you've always been.
[1:48:43] Are you together with me?
[1:48:46] You've always been part of that eternal
[1:48:48] fellowship.
[1:48:51] And if you've been part of that eternal
[1:48:54] fellowship,
[1:48:57] then you are going to be a manifestation
[1:49:01] of that eternal fellowship
[1:49:05] here on earth.
[1:49:08] Nobody will come and tell you
[1:49:11] come let us go and worship together.
[1:49:15] Nobody,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; you know, there is something in there
[1:49:20] that is calling and bringing you
[1:49:22] together
[1:49:25] into the economy of God in a local area.
[1:49:30] Are you together with me? Yeah, that's
[1:49:33] what is happening.
[1:49:35] If you are not part of the economy of
[1:49:38] God,
[1:49:40] there is nothing that can pull you.
[1:49:43] to worship
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; together with the saint.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; But there is something here
[1:49:50] that calls you
[1:49:53] to be part of the worship service.
[1:49:57] If you're PART OF THE LOCAL BODY,
[1:50:01] AMEN. You don't feel comfortable
[1:50:04] if this hand here has been broken off.
[1:50:09] It will keep jumping up and down
[1:50:12] because it's looking for the body.
[1:50:15] Amen. You see people out there, they
[1:50:18] begin to jump up and down because they
[1:50:21] are looking for the body.
[1:50:24] Amen. Some of them, they got to this
[1:50:27] place. They got to that place. But God
[1:50:31] saw you as a part of this assembly here.
[1:50:38] [applause]
[1:50:39] And you NEED TO BE PART of it.
[1:50:43] Amen. BE A MANIFESTATION
[1:50:46] THAT WHEN THE ROLL call is called,
[1:50:51] I'LL BE GATHERED TOGETHER WITH MY
[1:50:53] PEOPLE.
[1:50:56] We are your kind of people.
[1:50:59] WHY do you keep away?
[1:51:02] Amen. Praise the Lord. The situations
[1:51:06] you GO THROUGH IN TIME
[1:51:09] DO not
[1:51:11] and should not
[1:51:14] change this reality
[1:51:18] the situations you go through.
[1:51:21] They should not
[1:51:24] and they must NOT
[1:51:27] change this understanding
[1:51:31] that you from the beginning.
[1:51:37] You were part of this gathering and
[1:51:39] fellowship which eternal
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; eternal fellowship with God.
[1:51:45] The situations you go through sometimes
[1:51:49] moments of turmoil
[1:51:52] They shouldn't take away the narrative.
[1:51:56] They shouldn't take away the story
[1:52:00] that I am A CHILD OF GOD.
[1:52:03] I AM PART [screaming] OF GOD. WE ALWAYS
[1:52:05] BE PART of God.
[1:52:08] Amen. You see, Job was shaken
[1:52:13] in HIS FAITH.
[1:52:15] AND GOD CAME down
[1:52:17] to reveal to Job
[1:52:20] THAT JOB LISTENED. YOU WERE PART OF AN
[1:52:23] ETERNAL FELLOWSHIP.
[1:52:27] YOU ARE PART OF A HEAVENLY SUBSTANCE.
[1:52:31] REGARDLESS OF THE TRIALS YOU ARE GOING
[1:52:33] THROUGH.
[1:52:35] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. There are some
[1:52:37] PEOPLE THEY STEP BACK a little bit
[1:52:42] when THEY GET SOME KIND OF CHALLENGES.
[1:52:46] When they lose their job, when they've
[1:52:49] GOT MARITAL PROBLEMS,
[1:52:51] when they get SOME TROUBLE, STEP BACK.
[1:52:55] But let me tell you, THE MORE TROUBLES
[1:52:58] YOU HAVE, the closer to God you should
[1:53:01] be.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Tell the devil I will
[1:53:06] not be like a cave.
[1:53:09] When you are trouble, you walked away
[1:53:11] from the presence of
[1:53:14] the trouble you have
[1:53:16] the son OF GOD
[1:53:18] WHERE YOU CAN find the suffering.
[1:53:22] Hallelujah. BECAUSE YOUR ANSWER TO THE
[1:53:26] CHALLENGES
[1:53:28] IS ALREADY THERE in eternity. YOU KNOW
[1:53:31] YOUR FAITH. [screaming]
[1:53:33] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY YOU
[1:53:35] SHOULD COME HERE.
[1:53:37] Faith the church.
[1:53:40] Amen.
[1:53:42] Yes, sir. God told Job, you shouldn't be
[1:53:46] shaken by your trials.
[1:53:49] Because you came from the attribute.
[1:53:53] Amen. To be tested.
[1:53:56] Hey, that's what Malachi 4 told us. You
[1:54:00] come from the mind of God.
[1:54:02] come here in the flesh to be tested. So
[1:54:06] when you are tested, you need to come
[1:54:09] AROUND HERE SO THAT you can have a
[1:54:12] shoulder to lean on
[1:54:15] together so that YOU CAN CALL THE
[1:54:18] substance
[1:54:22] of God come down.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to fellowship here. fellowship
[1:54:32] with God through reconciliation.
[1:54:37] The prophet says when we get over this
[1:54:41] little shadow
[1:54:43] that we are passing through
[1:54:49] THIS HERE IS JUST a little shadow
[1:54:53] we are passing through.
[1:54:56] The reality
[1:54:58] is that
[1:55:00] it WILL TAKE SOME TIME
[1:55:03] 70 years
[1:55:05] going through this shadow.
[1:55:08] Oh,
[1:55:10] praise God. Amen. So when WE GET OVER
[1:55:16] THIS LITTLE shadow
[1:55:19] that we are passing through now
[1:55:22] called the earth journey
[1:55:25] and we arrive on the other side
[1:55:29] then it will be
[1:55:31] an eternal fellowship.
[1:55:35] When this little type
[1:55:38] this little type type
[1:55:45] that we we have here
[1:55:48] merges into eternity
[1:55:51] when time and eternity merges together.
[1:55:57] So the trials
[1:56:00] that we are going through
[1:56:03] should not blacken our minds
[1:56:06] when we are in Christ.
[1:56:14] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; ALL THIS temporal joys,
[1:56:23] they should not blacken,
[1:56:26] the revelation of who you are
[1:56:30] here on earth. You are a shadow.
[1:56:36] [laughter]
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE JUST A SHADOW.
[1:56:40] AND SO GOD HAD TO REMIND JOHN
[1:56:45] that John the earth here is not your
[1:56:49] destination.
[1:56:51] WE ARE ETERNAL beings
[1:56:56] going through an earthly experience.
[1:57:00] That's who we are.
[1:57:03] Yes.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; he's defining Job to himself.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Job 38 verse4.
[1:57:15] He's asking Job.
[1:57:17] Job is in pain.
[1:57:20] His body is popping out maggots.
[1:57:26] the earthworms.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; You know, he has got a a portion and
[1:57:35] he's trying to scratch his body
[1:57:40] and God is not coming to Job
[1:57:43] and say
[1:57:47] sorry
[1:57:49] Jobhu
[1:57:51] no.
[1:57:54] He's telling him, "Cut yourself that I
[1:57:58] talk to you like a man."
[1:58:02] That's the problem.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; We need to be sympathized with
[1:58:09] you know, I lost,
[1:58:11] you know, my back has been this
[1:58:14] I don't come to church because of this.
[1:58:18] the principles of God.
[1:58:21] An elect
[1:58:23] rugged in his faith.
[1:58:31] Rugged. You know,
[1:58:43] you know, you don't have to start
[1:58:45] saying, "Oh, now Elijah
[1:58:48] I need a double portion of your
[1:58:50] anointing.
[1:58:52] Don't let me go back and say to my
[1:58:56] people by
[1:58:58] Elijah will just tell you right you go
[1:59:00] back if you're not ready.
[1:59:07] He's not going to beg the seven
[1:59:11] go away.
[1:59:14] And when the 12 are saying Jesus, will
[1:59:17] you also go away?
[1:59:23] You should know God
[1:59:26] from that angle.
[1:59:28] That God does not beg and elect
[1:59:33] and the elect never falls away
[1:59:38] because of situation.
[1:59:43] SO GOD IS NOT BEGGING JOB.
[1:59:47] He's trying to make him UNDERSTAND
[1:59:52] JOB. You cannot be advising me
[1:59:57] OF HOW I SHOULD DEAL WITH IT.
[2:00:01] Are you together with me? WE DON'T
[2:00:03] ADVISE God of how he has to deal with it
[2:00:08] BECAUSE THE PATH HAS BEEN set
[2:00:12] on THE PATH OF JOB. HE WAS GOING TO GO
[2:00:15] through those trials.
[2:00:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. YOU DON'T HAVE
[2:00:20] TO SAY brothers have never been the way
[2:00:23] I've been.
[2:00:26] pass and keep calling
[2:00:29] the substance.
[2:00:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is trying to
[2:00:35] tell Jo.
[2:00:37] Amen. Do you have a better understanding
[2:00:39] than me?
[2:00:42] I'll ask you a few questions.
[2:00:46] Well, you know, where were you when I
[2:00:49] laid the foundations of the earth?
[2:00:53] Well declare if thou has understanding
[2:00:58] to begin with job you don't have a
[2:01:01] supernatural clarity of who you ARE
[2:01:06] I can only release you a little bit as a
[2:01:10] shadow.
[2:01:13] So these realities
[2:01:16] ARE SUBSTANCES
[2:01:18] THAT CAN BE PULLED DOWN BY FAITH.
[2:01:23] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We come to verse five.
[2:01:28] Who has laid the bur thereof?
[2:01:33] If thou knowest,
[2:01:35] oh who thou who has stretched the the
[2:01:38] line upon it,
[2:01:42] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[2:01:44] fastened.
[2:01:48] Or who laid the cornerstone there.
[2:01:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When the morning
[2:01:55] stars together
[2:01:59] and all the sons of God shouted for joy,
[2:02:06] you lost that memory.
[2:02:10] BUT YOU ARE PART OF THAT ECONOMY.
[2:02:13] HALLELUJAH. But you must know
[2:02:17] FROM UP THERE. YOU BYPASS YOUR
[2:02:21] come down to the bottom to be tested.
[2:02:26] Are you going through trials?
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; YES. YOU CAME here
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; to be tested
[2:02:35] and your FAITH
[2:02:38] MUST BE RUGGED.
[2:02:42] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. PULL THE
[2:02:44] SUBSTANCE
[2:02:47] that will deliver you from that
[2:02:48] condition
[2:02:51] AND BRING YOU TO YOUR STATE OF
[2:02:53] PERFECTION.
[2:02:57] So you are not here as a VISITOR
[2:03:01] THAT you came to church to visit for 5
[2:03:04] years
[2:03:06] and then you go away. You are here
[2:03:10] because you've always been part
[2:03:13] of the economy of God.
[2:03:17] And even when YOU CAME INTO YOUR SHADOW
[2:03:19] HERE,
[2:03:21] HALLELUJAH, you cannot break that
[2:03:23] fellowship.
[2:03:26] Amen. You must always look for your kind
[2:03:29] of people.
[2:03:31] Amen. not go to the volleyballs
[2:03:35] or soccer where there is fellowship
[2:03:39] here.
[2:03:40] You are coming here because it's an
[2:03:44] eternal fellowship.
[2:03:47] Hallelujah. IT'S ETERNAL
[2:03:51] TOGETHER in heaven.
[2:03:53] AMEN. A SUBSTANCE
[2:03:55] AND WE ARE NOW HERE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE
[2:03:58] COME ASH
[2:04:00] BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS WE ARE GOING TO GO
[2:04:02] BACK TO THE SUBSTANCE
[2:04:06] WHERE we came from.
[2:04:11] Amen. So these fellowships we enjoy now
[2:04:16] are not car gatherings.
[2:04:19] We are in the presence
[2:04:22] of the living God.
[2:04:26] If only you can be able to understand.
[2:04:31] You have not come here to gather body to
[2:04:34] body.
[2:04:36] You have come here to fellowship
[2:04:40] SEED TO SEED
[2:04:42] THAT WHO CAME FROM GOD
[2:04:45] HAVING FELLOWSHIP
[2:04:47] and that came from God
[2:04:50] and THAT OUR FELLOWSHIP
[2:04:53] IS NOT ENDING HERE.
[2:04:56] THAT IT DID NOT START FROM HERE.
[2:04:59] IT CAME FROM HEAVEN. WE CAME ON THE
[2:05:02] EARTH TO BE TESTED TOGETHER.
[2:05:06] COME TOGETHER and go back home together.
[2:05:11] [applause]
[2:05:13] Amen.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; So we don't assemble
[2:05:19] around an imaginary God.
[2:05:22] is here
[2:05:24] with the same power and authority.
[2:05:28] God is real substance.
[2:05:35] Can you believe that? Now
[2:05:38] it can break
[2:05:40] all your chains.
[2:05:47] Yes, it can.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Because Hebrews
[2:05:52] 11:6,
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; for he that cometh to God
[2:06:00] must believe
[2:06:03] that he is.
[2:06:07] He's a susest God
[2:06:10] and that is a rewarder
[2:06:13] of them that diligently seek.
[2:06:17] Hallelujah.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Are you in the presence of the substance
[2:06:23] not an imagination?
[2:06:27] He is a rewarder.
[2:06:31] He is a rewarder.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:34] That is the reality.
[2:06:38] Each time we come together in person,
[2:06:41] he is present.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered
[2:06:46] together,
[2:06:48] he's present.
[2:06:50] Amen. Amen.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Uh let's track this eternal fellowship a
[2:06:54] little bit.
[2:06:56] You see this earth is
[2:07:02] simply because it was spoken into
[2:07:04] existence.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; And God had this earth
[2:07:10] in his mind and spoken.
[2:07:14] Let there be.
[2:07:18] Amen.
[2:07:21] I am
[2:07:23] because I'm part of God's eternal mind.
[2:07:28] And you also
[2:07:30] you are a part of God's eternal mind.
[2:07:35] So we don't come here
[2:07:38] to meet one another.
[2:07:40] We come here because we have met before.
[2:07:47] HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE MET BEFORE, BROTHER.
[2:07:52] We were part of God.
[2:07:55] And when we come down here, we have an
[2:07:58] eternal fellowship.
[2:08:00] It is not starting here.
[2:08:03] It started in eternal.
[2:08:07] So how can you walk away from it?
[2:08:11] Where can we go? Because this is the
[2:08:13] word of eternal life.
[2:08:19] You were made to fellowship with God
[2:08:23] and therefore with one another.
[2:08:27] We come from God
[2:08:30] to fellowship with God.
[2:08:33] And therefore with one another
[2:08:35] because we both came from God.
[2:08:39] We are all drawn to God in fellowship
[2:08:43] because we come from the same source.
[2:08:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:08:50] Brother Brham said,
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; "But to really come into fellowship with
[2:08:56] God
[2:08:58] means to accept the blood."
[2:09:02] Have you accepted the blood?
[2:09:05] But to REALLY COME INTO FELLOWSHIP with
[2:09:07] God
[2:09:11] means to accept the blood
[2:09:15] is it is being applied to your heart
[2:09:21] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:09:24] by a new birth.
[2:09:27] Then you become a son
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; and in relationship back with God again.
[2:09:42] It means you have come to the throne of
[2:09:45] grace
[2:09:47] that we may obtain mercy
[2:09:49] in the time of need.
[2:09:52] that your sins,
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; your sins
[2:09:57] may be constantly cleansed
[2:10:01] because you are under the blood.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; You have a daily sacrifice.
[2:10:09] You report yourself to God
[2:10:12] daily because God loves perfection
[2:10:18] and perfection
[2:10:20] is working according to the provisions
[2:10:23] of the world
[2:10:26] and where you sin.
[2:10:29] You say Lord came in the blood.
[2:10:33] It means that you have been accepted
[2:10:36] in the beloved
[2:10:38] because that's where you always belong
[2:10:41] in the beloved.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as a part of the bride,
[2:10:50] you are in thought
[2:10:52] and therefore an eternal part
[2:10:58] of this eternal fellowship.
[2:11:05] Make that confession.
[2:11:08] an eternal
[2:11:12] partnet
[2:11:16] fellowship.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when you speak it,
[2:11:24] the devil trembles.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; You've mentioned it
[2:11:31] because you believe it.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; So, as part of the bride,
[2:11:37] you were in his thoughts
[2:11:40] and therefore an eternal part
[2:11:45] of that eternal fellowship.
[2:11:49] So the bride
[2:11:51] has always
[2:11:53] been in his mind.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[2:12:01] you come from God.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:08] You came from God.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you look at this flesh.
[2:12:16] But some of the people in this flesh
[2:12:18] here,
[2:12:20] they didn't come from God.
[2:12:24] If they came from God,
[2:12:27] some of them would be here this morning.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Because this is an eternal fellowship.
[2:12:38] I wish you understand what it means.
[2:12:42] We are not bringing the flesh
[2:12:46] but we are bringing the CD Jesus
[2:12:50] to meet God
[2:12:52] and that makes it an eternal fellowship
[2:12:58] in this earth.
[2:13:01] And from here
[2:13:04] we shall go back
[2:13:06] into our eternal fellowship.
[2:13:10] Amen. Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Look, you came from God's mind.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; I want to emphasize this
[2:13:18] you have always been
[2:13:21] supernatural substance.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes you think oh
[2:13:32] Now I got eternal life because I came to
[2:13:35] the altar sir. You came to the altar
[2:13:40] because you had eternal life.
[2:13:44] You realize who you are.
[2:13:47] So you are an eternal substance
[2:13:52] in fellowship with an eternal God.
[2:13:57] That's how glorious this fellowship is.
[2:14:04] Okay.
[2:14:08] He says, "See how this works."
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; God always had his thoughts for Adam.
[2:14:16] Put your name there.
[2:14:19] God always had his thoughts for Steven.
[2:14:28] Steven as he thought
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; was yet unexpressed.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; But you were there
[2:14:39] SOMEWHERE
[2:14:41] A SUBSTANCE.
[2:14:45] I feel good this morning.
[2:14:47] But when the season comes,
[2:14:50] the substance
[2:14:52] puts on flesh.
[2:14:57] SO WHEN WE COME DOWN HERE ON EARTH,
[2:15:01] GOD GIVE US THE GRACE
[2:15:03] that we live the life
[2:15:06] as eternal substance
[2:15:10] that comes from God.
[2:15:12] We don't go to the baropium
[2:15:17] this kind of things
[2:15:19] because you come for an eternal world.
[2:15:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU CALL UPON GOD
[2:15:29] TO HELP you overcome,
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; that faith WILL CREATE A PERFECT LIFE
[2:15:36] FOR you
[2:15:40] so that you can come down
[2:15:43] as a substance from above.
[2:15:47] He says Psalms 139.
[2:15:51] Amen. and verse 15 and 16
[2:15:56] will give you a little idea of this.
[2:16:00] Now this is like Adam SAYING
[2:16:04] MY substance was not hid from thee.
[2:16:09] Hallelujah.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; WE WERE SUBSTANCE
[2:16:16] in the mind of God.
[2:16:19] HE SAYS MY SUBSTANCE
[2:16:23] WAS NOT HID from thee.
[2:16:26] When I was made in secret,
[2:16:29] and curiously wrote in the lowest parts
[2:16:32] of the earth,
[2:16:36] thine eyes did see my substance.
[2:16:41] yet be unperfect.
[2:16:46] AND IN THY BOOK
[2:16:49] WERE ALL MY MEMBERS written
[2:16:52] which incontinence were fashioned
[2:16:56] when as yet there was none of them
[2:17:02] BUT YOU IN SUBSTANCE FORM.
[2:17:06] The thought of God
[2:17:09] is a reality.
[2:17:15] The mind of God
[2:17:17] is a substance.
[2:17:20] When God
[2:17:22] thought you going to get in such and
[2:17:23] such a problem
[2:17:27] at such and such a time,
[2:17:29] he prepared
[2:17:32] a solution for you.
[2:17:34] AND THAT SOLUTION
[2:17:36] WHEN YOU PRAY, IT COMES DOWN A
[2:17:39] SUBSTANCE.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that the widow woman
[2:17:47] could have been created
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; just because of Elijah?
[2:17:53] Are you together with me? There are some
[2:17:55] people I have supported, I've helped,
[2:18:01] they are believers. But sometimes I was
[2:18:05] created to support them.
[2:18:11] So when they WERE PRAYING,
[2:18:13] GOD was looking at substance somewhere.
[2:18:21] One day you may be substance to me.
[2:18:28] Praise God.
[2:18:30] Yes sir. God planned your path
[2:18:34] that will be part of this eternal
[2:18:36] fellowship
[2:18:39] and the light shined on it
[2:18:42] and gave the shadows
[2:18:46] of this eternal fellowship.
[2:18:49] It was in the mind of God.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; And then God shines the light of
[2:18:57] revelation.
[2:19:00] And then the light of revelation
[2:19:03] produces this eternal fellowship
[2:19:08] in types and shadows
[2:19:12] and it was given to Moses.
[2:19:16] Brother,
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; I was part of that revelation.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; I'll take you here to Exodus
[2:19:25] chapter 25. I'm finishing. Don't mind.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Do you love God?
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Do you love the word?
[2:19:33] Amen. Amen. Exodus 25:8.
[2:19:38] Now this vision
[2:19:41] of this eternal fellowship
[2:19:45] has been brought down to Moses.
[2:19:48] But when Moses is speaking,
[2:19:51] he's speaking
[2:19:53] that let us make something
[2:19:59] which represents this eternal
[2:20:01] fellowship,
[2:20:04] a shadow of the reality.
[2:20:10] Verse eight. And let them make me a
[2:20:13] sanctuary
[2:20:15] that I may dwell among them.
[2:20:19] God dwelling among his people
[2:20:23] according to all that I show thee.
[2:20:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. He took
[2:20:29] Moses and showed him the new Jerusalem.
[2:20:35] The new Jerusalem
[2:20:37] was a city coming from heaven, but it
[2:20:41] was like a people
[2:20:44] and bride of the Lord Jesus.
[2:20:50] Are you together with me? And God shows
[2:20:53] Moses that.
[2:20:56] From that Moses comes to build a t
[2:21:04] is building it
[2:21:06] from the substance
[2:21:09] and this tabernacle
[2:21:12] is the shadow.
[2:21:18] He built that shadow tabernacle.
[2:21:21] And listen now, WHEN THE ARK OF THE
[2:21:24] covenant
[2:21:27] was blessed into the holy of holies,
[2:21:31] the pillar of fire
[2:21:34] came down to say, "This is what it is.
[2:21:40] A pillar of fire
[2:21:42] over the shadow."
[2:21:45] [laughter]
[2:21:47] [snorts]
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; A PILLAR OF FIRE.
[2:21:52] OVER THE SHADOW.
[2:21:54] Let me tell you this afternoon,
[2:21:58] WE ARE NOT BAD KINGS
[2:22:03] WHERE MOSES MET THE OTHER TABERNACLE.
[2:22:07] We are living tabernacles
[2:22:11] of the living God.
[2:22:13] The substance of the new Jerusalem
[2:22:18] is unfolding itself.
[2:22:21] and you are part of it.
[2:22:23] If there was A PILLAR OF FIRE THERE, I
[2:22:27] WANT TO TELL you there is a pillar of
[2:22:28] fire.
[2:22:32] THERE IS MORE OF THAT HERE.
[2:22:36] So when YOU COME DOWN HERE, IF there was
[2:22:39] A PILL OF FIRE, IF THERE WAS GLORY AND
[2:22:43] SHADOW, the tabernacle of Moses, how
[2:22:47] much more glory
[2:22:49] when we come together.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; If we can realize
[2:22:58] that this is an eternal fellowship,
[2:23:01] we wouldn't be staying in our house.
[2:23:04] We would run. to be part of the
[2:23:07] presence.
[2:23:11] We would do not come to church to listen
[2:23:14] to a lecture.
[2:23:16] We would come to church and be part of
[2:23:19] the service.
[2:23:23] Praise the Lord. Yes, we are a temple
[2:23:27] not made with hands with a pillar of
[2:23:31] fire in it AND OVER IT.
[2:23:36] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; IN it and over it
[2:23:41] the B of fire.
[2:23:44] Amen. Seal
[2:23:48] over the church.
[2:23:50] Eternal fellowship.
[2:23:54] Let's go to Exodus chapter 40
[2:23:58] verse 33.
[2:24:01] He says, "And he rared up the court
[2:24:07] round about the tabernacle
[2:24:14] and the altar and set up the hanging of
[2:24:17] the court gate."
[2:24:24] So Moses
[2:24:27] finished the work.
[2:24:30] Then
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; a cloud covered the tent of the
[2:24:35] congregation
[2:24:41] and the glory of the Lord
[2:24:43] filled the tabernacle.
[2:24:48] Amen.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Moses
[2:24:54] finished the work of the tabernacle.
[2:24:59] It was a finished work
[2:25:02] that attracted the glory of the Lord
[2:25:06] in the you know in the shadow of divine
[2:25:09] fellowship
[2:25:12] finished work.
[2:25:15] And then when
[2:25:18] you know the tabernacle was finished,
[2:25:22] the blood had flown
[2:25:25] on Mount Calvary.
[2:25:28] It was a finished work.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; And then the glory of the Lord
[2:25:36] comes down on the day of Pentecost
[2:25:40] upon the tabernacle.
[2:25:42] And that glory
[2:25:44] has never left.
[2:25:48] It's always with us. When we come
[2:25:51] together, there was a glory
[2:25:54] in that house of Moses.
[2:25:57] They would see the pill of fire,
[2:26:00] sufficient miracles.
[2:26:02] The road of Aaron
[2:26:05] would enter in the holy of holies
[2:26:08] and would bear arm wounds.
[2:26:11] I'm telling you, brother.
[2:26:14] This moment here,
[2:26:16] we are that living tabernacle.
[2:26:20] The glory of God
[2:26:23] is more here
[2:26:25] than it was there,
[2:26:28] but your faith
[2:26:30] brings it down.
[2:26:36] You come into presence
[2:26:40] out there. It was shadows.
[2:26:43] God shadowed himself out there.
[2:26:47] But today is a real tabernacle
[2:26:52] with a real God
[2:26:54] for a greater glory.
[2:27:01] Brother Brham
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; used to call the glory down.
[2:27:07] substance.
[2:27:09] We don't come down here to place shadow.
[2:27:15] We come here because we are the real
[2:27:17] temple
[2:27:19] in fellowship
[2:27:21] with the real God
[2:27:24] substance eternal fellowship.
[2:27:31] Listen to the prayers of the prophet.
[2:27:34] gifts and callings are without
[2:27:35] repentance.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:27:40] we pray now that as we dedicate the
[2:27:44] building
[2:27:46] and ourselves to you for service that
[2:27:50] you drive back every foul spirit.
[2:27:56] May men and women
[2:27:59] that's come under this roof
[2:28:02] come under the conviction
[2:28:05] May the angels of God
[2:28:08] stand by every post.
[2:28:14] Amen. around the place and take their
[2:28:17] seats.
[2:28:19] Oh God,
[2:28:21] every person here as in your divine
[2:28:25] presence.
[2:28:27] May there be such a meeting
[2:28:30] never been before in
[2:28:33] May every sinner be inspired.
[2:28:36] Every member,
[2:28:38] every Christian sinners fall under the
[2:28:41] conviction
[2:28:44] and may there be grace
[2:28:46] growing on the people
[2:28:49] and may there come the knowledge of
[2:28:51] Christ
[2:28:53] by the same great Christ.
[2:28:56] Hallelujah.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; In expectations,
[2:28:59] he says, "May the angels of God,
[2:29:03] may they stand in the
[2:29:08] may the great angel OF GOD,
[2:29:12] SPREAD forth his wings
[2:29:15] throughout this tent tonight.
[2:29:19] Are you together with me?" Do you see
[2:29:21] what I'm talking about?
[2:29:23] Then he says, "Father,
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; oh may you just take over
[2:29:31] from right now and anoint the building
[2:29:36] and dedicate it for you. May the angels
[2:29:39] of heaven come down of those ladders of
[2:29:43] Jacob
[2:29:46] positions now
[2:29:48] soldiers
[2:29:50] at THEIR POST OF DUTY.
[2:29:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; If you realize
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; that we are not in shadows anymore,
[2:30:01] we are the tabernacle.
[2:30:04] If we realize
[2:30:06] that God is not playing shadows anymore
[2:30:11] comes in every fellowship,
[2:30:16] then it's that eternal fellowship.
[2:30:21] You have come an eternal fellowship
[2:30:25] in the presence of God,
[2:30:27] the ministering of angels,
[2:30:30] the great healing power
[2:30:32] to the extent
[2:30:34] that if THERE IS A SOUL HERE,
[2:30:37] if there's
[2:30:39] he can also prophesy
[2:30:42] is an anointed house.
[2:30:46] Are you together with me? Eternal
[2:30:48] fellowship.

[2:30:55] lessons.
[2:30:57] We come here to bring you to that

[2:31:05] what you will. And God can supply.
