[23:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:04] amen amen let us go to Ezra chapter six
[23:15] reading from verse 11 to verse 15.
[23:24] also I have made a decree that whosoever
[23:28] shall alter this word let Timber be
[23:32] pulled down from his house and being
[23:36] and being set up let him be hung there
[23:39] on and let his house be made a downhill
[23:42] for this is
[23:50] [Music]
[24:03] [Music]
[24:07] and the god that has caused his name to
[24:10] dwell there destroy all Kings and people
[24:14] that shall put their hand to Altar and
[24:17] Destroy This House of God which is at
[24:19] Jerusalem I Darius have made a decree
[24:23] let it be done with speed
[24:34] [Music]
[24:43] is
[24:51] governor on this side River
[24:55] and their companions according to that
[24:59] which Darius King had sent so they did
[25:03] speedily uh
[25:08] um
[25:20] and the Elders of the Jews build it and
[25:24] they prospered through the prophesying
[25:26] of haggai the prophet and Zachariah the
[25:29] son of Ido and they builded and finished
[25:32] it according to the Commandment of the
[25:35] god of Israel and according the
[25:37] Commandment of Cyrus and dairas under
[25:40] Texas King of Persia
[25:47] um
[26:09] and this house was finished on the third
[26:12] day of the month Ada which was the 60th
[26:15] year of the reign of Darius the king
[26:18] room
[26:30] may God blessing of his word something
[26:32] you may be seated
[26:38] I want to preach on the subject
[26:41] from verse 14.
[26:44] and it says that and the Elders of the
[26:47] Jews build it
[26:50] and they prospered through the
[26:52] prophesying of haggai
[26:57] so I want to preacher prospering
[27:01] through the prophecy of Elijah
[27:05] praise the name of Allah
[27:09] through the prophecy of Elijah
[27:13] let us try to expand this word prophesy
[27:16] rather prospering
[27:21] so now when we go to Joshua chapter 1
[27:24] soccer
[27:26] husband
[27:33] in Joshua chapter 1 and verse 7 yes
[27:36] he says only be those strong and very
[27:40] courageous
[27:42] that though May observe to do according
[27:46] to all the laws
[27:49] which Moses my servant commanded
[27:54] turn not from e to the right hand or to
[27:57] the left
[28:00] that you may Prosper
[28:03] whatsoever
[28:06] praise the name of our Lord so then you
[28:10] see here God is telling Joshua yes
[28:17] all the law that Moses has commanded
[28:22] praise the name God had given them
[28:26] and then he demanded that they follow
[28:29] the word of God
[28:33] that observe to do all the law
[28:37] don't turn to the left or don't go to
[28:41] the right hand side
[28:42] but do everything
[28:46] according to what is
[28:50] when you do that you will prosper in the
[28:56] whatsoever things you do
[28:59] and everybody wants to prosper but here
[29:03] the principle of God of prosperity is by
[29:07] us following the one that he has given
[29:09] us
[29:10] you don't turn to the right the things
[29:13] that are easy for you you don't turn to
[29:16] the left maybe the things that are hard
[29:18] for you but we want you to walk in the
[29:21] middle line
[29:22] right following the word you don't fall
[29:26] to the side of many people or you don't
[29:29] fall to the side of you know whatever
[29:31] but you know just to follow the word
[29:34] exactly and then he's saying when you do
[29:38] that then you will prosper
[29:41] praise the name of it then in verse 86
[29:45] this book of the Lord
[29:48] shall not depart out of your mouth
[29:52] but you shall meditate there in day and
[29:56] denial
[29:58] that you may observe to do according to
[30:02] all that is written there
[30:05] for then you shall make your way
[30:08] prosperous
[30:10] and then you shall have good success
[30:15] every day we struggle to have good
[30:17] success
[30:19] every day we struggle you know to be
[30:21] prosperous
[30:23] [Applause]
[30:24] but then here the Bible is giving us the
[30:27] principles
[30:28] the law of God or the word of God should
[30:33] not depart out of our mouth
[30:36] but we need to meditate upon it is
[30:42] and when you meditate upon it watch for
[30:45] me when you think about it then you do
[30:49] what is there
[30:50] you obey what is written and now when
[30:54] you obey what is written then you make
[30:57] your way successful you make yourself
[31:00] prosperous
[31:01] now when we got Deuteronomy chapter six
[31:05] praise the name of Allah Deuteronomy
[31:08] chapter 6
[31:09] and then verse
[31:11] the scripture says we are all Israel the
[31:16] Lord our God is one Lord
[31:19] and you shall love the Lord with all
[31:23] thine hearts
[31:25] with all thy songs and with all thy
[31:29] minds and then he says the same thing
[31:32] here personal
[32:13] [Applause]
[32:33] uh
[32:34] praise the name of it and and those that
[32:37] observe what is
[32:41] good Revelations
[32:45] praise the name of Allah
[32:48] so then he says
[32:52] I wish you are fast enough just the
[32:54] scripture blessed is he that readeth and
[32:57] they that hear the words of this
[32:59] prophecy
[33:02] and keep those things which are written
[33:06] therein
[33:08] so God wants you to read what's
[33:12] according
[33:16] so we see that in the tournament is
[33:19] saying the one should be in your house
[33:22] and when the world is in your house
[33:25] think about you keep on hearing
[33:29] keep on you know reading it
[33:32] and when you hear it you read it you
[33:37] think about it it's in your heart then
[33:41] he says teach it
[33:44] talk about it
[34:21] [Music]
[34:39] does he know what you believe
[35:41] minimum so let the word of God rule in
[35:45] your place of wine
[35:47] the work you do how you behave yourself
[35:52] let the one take charge over there
[35:55] that when you speak somebody will know
[35:58] this guy is different
[36:00] when you do some action oh you do some
[36:05] kind of work
[36:07] somebody will know this person is
[36:10] different
[36:10] and then he says between you the flaunts
[36:14] of Lying Eyes
[36:15] you know it should be like your mirrors
[36:19] it should be like your your glasses
[36:23] you know you sit through the wire and
[36:27] you also see yourself through the world
[36:29] so your judgments your decision
[36:34] every kind of course of action you do in
[36:37] your life
[36:38] is based upon the world
[36:40] and then God said
[37:00] so the Bible says
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:07] and they prospered through the
[37:09] prophesying
[37:13] what were they building they were
[37:16] building the Temple of God
[37:19] and when we look what the elders
[37:22] when we go into the scriptures
[37:24] the elders in the New Testament and
[37:28] ministers they were doing the building
[37:31] and right now we are also building
[37:35] praise the name of Allah we are building
[37:38] the Temple of God
[37:40] in the Old Testament when they were
[37:43] building the temples when Solomon was
[37:46] building
[37:47] he had the peace
[37:50] but now when the temple was broken down
[37:53] and it was being revealed
[37:57] it was being built in the trouble last
[38:00] time
[38:02] they had a lot of oppositions they had
[38:07] many people were pulling them left and
[38:09] right now
[38:11] the enemy was against them when they
[38:15] were rebuilding the temple and here we
[38:18] are we are also the temple of God we are
[38:22] under construction
[38:23] but we need to know that even as the
[38:27] enemy is against us
[38:28] I wish they would control that sound
[38:32] praise the name of our Lord so the enemy
[38:35] is against us
[38:37] is doing everything he can
[38:40] to see that the work stops
[38:45] now the Bible says in First Peter
[38:48] chapter five
[38:52] and then verse 8 only come none praise
[38:55] the name of our Lord First Peter chapter
[38:57] 5 and then verse 8.
[39:05] be sober be vigilant because your
[39:10] adversary the devil has a roaring lion
[39:14] walks about seeking whom he may divide
[39:26] that's what the devil is doing is moving
[39:30] up and down whatever
[39:33] and you know Satan is not just settled
[39:36] in one place
[39:37] he goes this way again
[39:40] he comes in the morning he checks your
[39:43] condition
[39:46] have you prayed have you read the word
[39:49] well if you have prayed
[39:51] then he gets away yeah then around 10
[39:55] o'clock he again comes at your place
[39:59] are you doing what you read or your
[40:02] dreams
[40:04] he finds your doing
[40:10] [Applause]
[40:45] in the face
[40:47] foreign
[41:37] let us go to Israel again
[41:42] foreign
[41:52] of captivity build the temple unto the
[41:56] Lord God of Israel
[41:58] available
[42:05] then they came to zalupa Bell and the
[42:09] chief of the fathers and said unto them
[42:12] let us build with you for we seek your
[42:15] God as you do and we do sacrifice unto
[42:19] him since the days of escarhadon king of
[42:23] Assad which brought us up
[42:31] Caesars
[42:41] is
[42:48] now the Bible says when they are
[42:52] diversaries
[42:56] when they had they are building the
[42:59] Temple
[43:00] when the adversary when the adversary
[43:04] Center
[43:14] foreign
[43:34] it's kind of like a religious kind of
[43:37] affiliation
[43:40] they said let us build together
[43:43] we seek the same God but the question is
[43:49] before the construction
[43:51] why do they want to identify with the
[43:54] work
[43:55] when it is just starting
[43:59] when Satan Satan said that Jesus was
[44:03] hungry
[44:04] then he came as a friend oh you are too
[44:08] hungry the market is
[44:12] you may die along the way foreign
[44:44] [Applause]
[46:00] has commanded them
[46:24] [Applause]
[46:33] [Applause]
[46:43] [Applause]
[46:56] born again was something which was a
[46:58] curse in the country
[47:02] even in all foreign
[47:37] [Applause]
[47:51] are the people really getting saved
[47:56] praise the name of our Lord and then
[47:58] they say ah you you how many wants to be
[48:02] saved like when you attend some of these
[48:04] funerals
[48:07] and then the people raised their hearts
[48:08] and then they tell them oh now you
[48:11] confess like this don't like this
[48:16] they even deceive them that write my
[48:20] name in The Book of Life the Bible says
[48:24] the book of life was written before the
[48:27] foundation
[48:28] now which book are they writing
[48:33] deception
[48:37] and then they tell them
[48:40] that now but you know you are saved but
[48:44] the Bible says he that Believers and is
[48:48] baptized
[48:50] but then some of them say you will have
[48:54] baptized when you are young
[48:56] now which is fast to believe and be
[48:59] baptized to be baptized
[49:04] because the Bible
[49:06] he that believes
[49:08] and is baptized shall be saved but then
[49:13] for them they say are you baptized when
[49:15] you are yeah
[49:21] do you put the cat before the the the
[49:24] horse or it is the horse before they cut
[49:28] it
[49:33] which comes first check soccer
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:03] that is not in the Bible
[50:07] the true baptism is you must be immersed
[50:11] in the world
[50:12] in the name of Jesus Christ
[50:15] because the Bible says baptism you know
[50:19] you are being buried
[50:21] you don't bury people by sprinkling
[50:23] small
[50:25] soil on top of them
[50:33] so even baptism you must be immersed in
[50:36] the world
[50:38] praise the name of Allah but you see the
[50:41] devil has schemes of understand
[50:48] that may keep holding holding people to
[50:51] his side
[50:52] so here the Bible says
[50:58] Judah
[50:59] the hands
[51:02] they traveled them in the building
[51:05] and the Bible says in verse 5. they
[51:09] hired counselors against them
[51:15] you read it
[51:24] so they hired the counselors
[51:29] politicians
[51:30] to frustrate them
[51:36] the first one they came we worshiped the
[51:38] same God
[51:39] [Applause]
[51:41] religious Satan coming in a religious
[51:44] range
[51:45] to oppose now when he goes through the
[51:49] religious and maybe he has not been able
[51:51] to achieve then he goes through the
[51:55] political
[51:56] using politicians to frustrate
[52:00] to threateness
[52:06] and then when they failed that move
[52:09] when this for Captain building the Bible
[52:13] says and in the reign of ahasuelas
[52:17] in the beginning of his Reigns
[52:22] against the inhabitants of Judah and
[52:25] Jerusalem
[52:31] foreign
[52:44] [Applause]
[52:52] death spoke in the whole thing
[52:57] and religious and demon powers mixed
[53:02] together
[53:03] praise the name of Allah when you read
[53:05] in Revelations chapter six
[53:09] about the Seven Seals
[53:12] and then you look what the Ghost Rider
[53:15] seals
[53:19] you see that in Revelations chapter six
[53:22] and then verse
[53:25] the Bible says and I saw when the lamb
[53:28] opened one of the seals
[53:32] what I heard as it were the noise of
[53:35] sand the empire
[53:40] one of the four beasts saying come and
[53:43] see
[53:45] um
[53:54] and I saw and behold a white horse
[54:00] so the devil was riding on a white horse
[54:05] as a deceiver
[54:08] as an impersonator
[54:11] coming in the religious Rings
[54:16] something like Ezra
[54:20] foreign
[54:29] the second series
[54:41] and there went out another host that was
[54:45] red
[54:49] and power was given unto him
[54:52] to take peace from the earth
[54:55] killing people so here he came as a
[55:00] political force
[55:02] and now on the third season he writes on
[55:06] the black horse
[55:08] demonic power that man again
[55:14] understand what the Devil comes and
[55:16] approaches these things
[55:19] so he says in the fourth season
[55:22] politics he is the king of politics sure
[55:32] as I have all went through it before
[55:36] all smart educations and things like
[55:39] that uh
[55:41] from the wrong side just follow it
[55:45] through the scripture
[55:46] find out if that is right
[55:49] follow Kane's children I see what they
[55:53] become then follow thesis children see
[55:57] what they want everybody not as not as
[56:00] I'm supposing I'm supporting ignorance
[56:03] not at all but you take any person
[56:09] so now you see how the devil follows him
[56:13] so then we see that in the rebuilding of
[56:17] the terms
[56:18] they were doing it under a lot of
[56:21] oppositions
[56:23] but now for them to be strengthened in
[56:27] the work of God
[56:29] God sent them a prophet
[56:40] [Applause]
[57:31] foreign
[57:38] [Applause]
[58:00] [Music]
[58:07] he wants to hold you down he wants to
[58:11] keep you out of the Kingdom he wants to
[58:14] keep you out of the blessing of God he
[58:17] wants to keep you not being prospered by
[58:19] the Lord
[58:21] but the Bible says
[58:25] now when God sent prophets the scripture
[58:29] says in Israel 5 2.
[58:32] foreign then Ross up the rubber Bell the
[58:36] son of shelter Joshua the son of zodiac
[58:39] and began to build the house of God
[58:42] which is at Jerusalem and with them we
[58:44] are the prophets of God helping them
[58:57] yes
[59:04] God send them prophets
[59:08] helping them in the construction
[59:11] and then the scriptures that the Elders
[59:15] of the Jews
[59:17] when they were building the Temple
[59:20] they prospered
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:23] through the prophesying
[59:27] praise the name of Allah
[59:30] as we are under construction
[1:00:25] [Applause]
[1:00:31] so now God
[1:00:33] sent us a message in our generation and
[1:00:37] the message that God
[1:00:38] is what will make us ready
[1:00:42] for the Rapture is what will make us
[1:00:45] ready for the coming of Our Lord
[1:00:48] so in the season we're living you can
[1:00:52] never overcome
[1:00:55] us without the prophesy of Elijah the
[1:00:59] prophet Allah
[1:01:03] because God that sent us
[1:01:08] any time if you can take it to the word
[1:01:12] of God you will be able to overcome all
[1:01:15] powers
[1:01:17] but if you don't take it to the message
[1:01:26] foreign
[1:01:57] praise the name of our husband let us go
[1:02:00] to Genesis chapter 41.
[1:02:02] and then verse 53 a Canadian
[1:02:09] Genesis 41 53.
[1:02:14] the Bible says
[1:02:18] and the seven years of plentiness that
[1:02:21] was in the land of Egypt where ended up
[1:02:31] under seven years of death began to come
[1:02:34] according as Joseph had said and the
[1:02:38] death was in all the lands but in all
[1:02:41] the land of Egypt there was bread is
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:53] and when all the land of Egypt was
[1:02:56] famished the people cried far out for
[1:03:00] bread and pharah said unto all the
[1:03:03] Egyptians go unto Joseph that his and
[1:03:08] what he says to you do is
[1:03:29] so here the Bible says
[1:03:41] it was not training
[1:03:43] there was no planting there was no
[1:03:46] harvesting
[1:03:48] and then everybody felt the famous
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:57] and then the Bible says 56.
[1:04:02] and The Feminine was over all the face
[1:04:05] of the Earth and Joseph opened all the
[1:04:07] store houses and sold unto the Egyptians
[1:04:10] and The Feminine walked somewhere in the
[1:04:13] land of Egypt Angela nebula and his
[1:04:16] owner you see
[1:04:24] and all countries came into Egypt to
[1:04:28] Joseph for to buy corn because that the
[1:04:31] famine was so sore in all the lives
[1:04:41] now you look what distression in
[1:04:46] Egyptian that there was severe feminine
[1:04:51] so terrible destruction was
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:55] praise the name of it and then the Bible
[1:04:58] says money failed in Egypt
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:25] to buy a loaf of bread
[1:05:29] that's how bad it was
[1:05:31] hyper inflation for example questions
[1:05:35] maybe you have to put the man on a
[1:05:38] wheelbarrow oh yeah
[1:05:39] to buy only one piece of bread
[1:05:44] manifold
[1:05:47] praise the name of our Lord and we
[1:05:49] should also know do you know that they
[1:05:51] are circumstances when money can
[1:05:55] failure money can fail says when the
[1:05:59] sickness is severeign
[1:06:03] pestilences
[1:06:05] people dying left and right
[1:06:08] manifest yes
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:14] it doesn't help you you have too much
[1:06:17] but you can't help it is
[1:06:21] the name of Allah and the Bible says
[1:06:23] your riches cannot help you in the time
[1:06:28] of trouble you may have a lot but it
[1:06:32] becomes useless
[1:06:33] so now we see at the destruction in
[1:06:36] Egypt
[1:06:38] in Genesis 47. and then verse 13.
[1:06:44] praise the name of our Lord
[1:06:47] the Bible says
[1:06:50] and there was no bread in all the land
[1:06:53] for the famine was very sore so that the
[1:06:56] land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan
[1:06:59] fainted by the reason of famine whatever
[1:07:12] and Joseph gathered up all the money
[1:07:15] that was found in the land of Egypt and
[1:07:18] in the land of Canaan for the corn which
[1:07:21] they brought they bought and Joseph
[1:07:23] brought the money into Farah's house
[1:07:38] and when money failed in the land of
[1:07:41] Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the
[1:07:45] Egyptians came unto Joseph and saying
[1:07:48] give us bread for why should we die in
[1:07:51] thy presence for the money Faith a face
[1:07:54] is
[1:08:21] so if you have too much
[1:08:25] and it's not say sure
[1:08:28] oh it's not backed up by something solid
[1:08:31] any time it can collapse
[1:08:35] praise the name of our Lord so now when
[1:08:38] there are money failed because
[1:08:42] the Bible says they started bringing
[1:08:45] their animals
[1:08:47] so animals have greater value than money
[1:08:50] cavities
[1:08:52] when all they are animals were given
[1:08:55] over to Joseph
[1:08:57] then they started now selling their land
[1:09:00] for food
[1:09:05] is more valuable than animals
[1:09:08] and the animals are more valuable than
[1:09:11] the money
[1:09:12] so when you have more animals you are
[1:09:16] better than somebody just having money
[1:09:18] when you have more land you are better
[1:09:21] than somebody just having animals
[1:09:23] so you just need to learn the principles
[1:09:26] of the Bible
[1:09:29] depreciates
[1:09:32] but animals multiply
[1:09:35] foreign
[1:10:09] Bill gets the one of the richest men in
[1:10:11] the world
[1:10:14] he has bought a lot of farmland
[1:10:20] until they say is either one of the
[1:10:22] biggest
[1:10:23] Farm owners as an individual in the U.S
[1:10:26] America
[1:10:30] because they know where the real value
[1:10:33] is
[1:10:34] so we see that in Egypt all the animals
[1:10:38] we are taken by pharaohs and even all
[1:10:42] the land
[1:10:42] was taken by Pharrell and then the
[1:10:46] people became slaves
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:50] so people should learn how to work hard
[1:10:55] and when you can maybe don't spend
[1:10:58] whatever you get
[1:11:00] some put it into somebody like if you
[1:11:04] are staying in your place the money you
[1:11:07] have why don't you put in an animal also
[1:11:09] right and
[1:11:11] you know there are some people they come
[1:11:14] from they get from only one chicken
[1:11:18] and then after one or two years that
[1:11:22] chicken has multiplied
[1:11:23] and they can get from that goats
[1:11:27] now they are talking in millions of
[1:11:30] Shillings
[1:11:31] not in thousands of Shillings
[1:11:35] praise the name of it so we also need to
[1:11:39] learn how the thing goes
[1:11:42] so now you see that money failed in
[1:11:46] Egypt
[1:11:47] that was the situation the Earth was
[1:11:50] going through yeah
[1:11:52] that was
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:53] foreign
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:13:15] praise the name of Allah
[1:13:18] he says now therefore be not grieved
[1:13:22] Nora angry with yourselves that you
[1:13:24] sowed me hither for God did send me
[1:13:27] before you to preserve life is
[1:13:43] for these two years has the famine been
[1:13:46] in the land and yet there are five years
[1:13:49] in which there shall neither be hearing
[1:13:52] nor Harvest
[1:13:55] Moon see
[1:13:57] um
[1:14:06] and God sent me before you to preserve
[1:14:09] you a posterity in the earth and to save
[1:14:13] your lives by a great Deliverance
[1:14:16] foreign
[1:14:33] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:14:36] hither but God that has made me a father
[1:14:40] to pharaoh and the Lord over all his
[1:14:43] house and a ruler throughout all the
[1:14:46] land of Egypt because
[1:15:01] so God sent them a prophet
[1:15:04] God sent them Joseph to be in their
[1:15:09] medicine
[1:15:10] and as long as they obey the prophesying
[1:15:13] of Joseph
[1:15:14] the land Prosperity
[1:15:17] praise the name of Allah it's also the
[1:15:20] same thing God has sent us
[1:15:24] a prophet in the end of time
[1:15:32] [Applause]
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:16:01] take them seriously
[1:16:04] praise the name of our Lord you know one
[1:16:06] thing about the life of brother Branham
[1:16:10] is that God was showing him things
[1:16:14] that where we are you that are
[1:16:17] everywhere and that are to me
[1:16:19] praise the name of Allah he kept on
[1:16:22] revealing everything to him he showed
[1:16:25] him what is in here and then he showed
[1:16:28] him what is in here
[1:16:29] praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:16:31] beyond the curtain of time
[1:16:33] to know that the people believe the
[1:16:36] message this is the place that God has
[1:16:39] ordained for him this is the place that
[1:16:42] God has towered for us so it is not a
[1:16:46] blind message
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:47] praise the name of us we have the sure
[1:16:50] word of prophecies
[1:16:52] like when Joseph told Pharaoh we are
[1:16:55] going to have seven years of playing
[1:17:00] but when it came to pass
[1:17:12] preparations for ourselors
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:18:14] oh Father
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:19:15] kept Egypt never
[1:19:50] at that time they were following that
[1:19:52] but right now that's how we have the
[1:19:55] shoe Award of prophets
[1:19:58] we am the sure word of prophets
[1:20:01] that the Lord has given unto us so you
[1:20:05] need to believe that way to prosper
[1:20:10] in all that you do
[1:20:12] wherever you go take the message
[1:20:16] and the message
[1:20:19] talks about different things
[1:20:22] different ways as a young woman the
[1:20:26] message he talks about how you're meant
[1:20:28] to conduct yourself
[1:20:29] as a young man
[1:20:34] I say husband the message talks about
[1:20:37] how you're meant
[1:20:38] as a wife The person talks about how
[1:20:41] your Mentor
[1:20:42] each and every one of them God has given
[1:20:46] us the sure word of prophecies
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:48] I have to put on time demons
[1:21:54] you're not going to prosper by that
[1:21:56] foreign
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:32] less though and thy household and all
[1:22:35] that though Hast come to Poverty
[1:22:39] is
[1:22:49] the name of our Lord so you see famine
[1:22:53] brings poverty
[1:22:57] praise the name of Allah
[1:22:59] famine brings poverty
[1:23:03] actually in life
[1:23:06] the thing you spend most of your money
[1:23:08] on is food event we are seeing that
[1:23:10] might have percentage and even in the
[1:23:13] Uganda Bureau of Statistics did that
[1:23:15] research
[1:23:19] they found around the 40 around 40
[1:23:23] percent of somebody's income is spent on
[1:23:25] food
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:24:06] we can't
[1:24:08] live by ourselves
[1:24:12] now that's a bad condition we know
[1:24:15] praise the name of us and each of us as
[1:24:19] God has given you ability
[1:24:22] put your hand to work
[1:24:34] but when it comes to the US
[1:24:37] you are deprived like Lazarus
[1:24:44] could not afford rent
[1:24:47] so he was always on the money's gate
[1:24:51] we shouldn't be like that
[1:24:54] Lazarus could not afford the meal he was
[1:24:58] always the wanting those cramps which
[1:25:00] come from the rich man history
[1:25:02] you shouldn't be like that praise the
[1:25:05] name of Allah
[1:25:07] could not go to hospital he couldn't
[1:25:10] afford the medical bills so he was all
[1:25:13] having wounds
[1:25:15] until dogs were licking
[1:25:18] them you shouldn't live like this
[1:25:21] we have the promises for God to give us
[1:25:25] all that we have problems
[1:25:33] it is God who said God and keep the
[1:25:35] garden

[1:25:40] school be serious with your training
[1:25:43] and learn those skills say that you
[1:25:47] Excel and become and become a better
[1:25:49] profession of that
[1:25:53] if you don't have any skills they are
[1:25:56] also jobs for people without skills
[1:26:01] [Applause]
[1:26:03] and when you are there be humble and
[1:26:07] learn from the one who knows
[1:26:11] like nowadays

[1:26:40] because it can be an interview
[1:26:43] for a driver they bring the tools they
[1:26:46] use in the garage
[1:26:48] and then they ask him if I want to
[1:26:51] remove the tire
[1:26:53] which tools do I use

[1:27:16] learning from being a time a tire man
[1:27:20] or a tiny man
[1:27:23] now you become a driver
[1:27:26] he's being a driver but now maybe you
[1:27:28] become a planting
[1:27:31] mechanically and then there now you can
[1:27:34] know how which spells to you

[1:28:01] it is maybe kind of like lifting blocks
[1:28:04] can't do that oh yeah
[1:28:06] and then as you lift blocks
[1:28:12] as you mix
[1:28:14] they put the bricks on the walls
[1:28:17] you are gaining skills and do not belong
[1:28:21] you are an expert in what you're doing
[1:28:24] praise the name of it so famine brings
[1:28:28] poverty
[1:28:31] the Bible says in almost chapter 8
[1:28:35] and then verse 11.
[1:28:40] Amos they live in
[1:28:43] and then almost chapter 8 verse 11.
[1:28:47] the Bible says behold the days come says
[1:28:51] the Lord
[1:28:52] that I will send a feminine in the land
[1:28:54] not a famine of bread Nora is asked for
[1:28:58] water but of hearing the words of the
[1:29:01] Lord lover
[1:29:04] is
[1:29:16] and they shall Wander from sea to Sea
[1:29:19] and from the north even to the east they
[1:29:21] shall run to and fro to seek the word of
[1:29:24] the Lord and shall not find it
[1:29:44] so the Bible says
[1:29:46] [Applause]
[1:29:48] he's going to send famine in the
[1:29:53] landing
[1:29:56] is a famine of hearing
[1:29:59] of the word of God
[1:30:02] hearing the word of God
[1:30:06] now
[1:30:07] if you are going to here
[1:30:09] then there has to be somebody to speak
[1:30:32] but he says Famine of hearings
[1:30:37] the words of God
[1:30:39] and the word is God
[1:30:42] so the Famine of hearing God speaking
[1:30:49] praise the name of us and then we said
[1:30:52] foreign
[1:31:04] foreign
[1:31:32] and he went out to meet ASA and said
[1:31:36] unto him
[1:31:38] and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is
[1:31:43] with you while you be with him and if
[1:31:46] you seek Him He will be fond of you but
[1:31:49] if you forsake Him He will forsake you
[1:32:38] now for a long season
[1:32:54] three things
[1:32:56] foreign
[1:32:58] [Applause]
[1:33:26] foreign
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:58] foreign
[1:34:12] so then the Bible says they were without
[1:34:15] God through God they are without the
[1:34:18] teaching priests they were without the
[1:34:20] Lord
[1:34:21] and that can be a condition of an
[1:34:24] individual
[1:34:25] or it is the condition of the age of
[1:34:28] loudness
[1:34:29] they don't know the true God because
[1:34:33] they have rejected the message
[1:34:35] they don't have the word of God because
[1:34:38] they don't care for you three things so
[1:34:42] then it brought a condition of famine
[1:34:46] Famine of hearings
[1:34:49] they don't want to hear God
[1:34:53] from the time
[1:34:56] the Bible says
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:00] he calls Israel to sin against God
[1:35:05] by bringing him the two cups that he
[1:35:08] brought
[1:35:09] in First Kings chapter 12
[1:35:12] David
[1:35:15] and then verse
[1:35:18] 25.
[1:35:22] then
[1:35:23] shechem in Mount Ephraim and drilled
[1:35:27] there in and went out from thence and
[1:35:29] built panel foreign
[1:35:42] to the House of David
[1:35:53] if these people go up to do sacrifice in
[1:35:57] the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[1:36:00] shall the heart of these people turn
[1:36:02] again unto their lord even at rehoboam
[1:36:05] king of Judah and they shall kill me and
[1:36:08] go again to rehoboam King of Judah oh
[1:36:11] abant
[1:36:15] yes
[1:36:29] where upon the king took counsel and
[1:36:33] made two cups of God and said unto them
[1:36:35] it is too much for you to go up to
[1:36:38] Jerusalem Behold thy gods or Israel
[1:36:41] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:36:44] Egypt is
[1:36:51] foreign
[1:37:19] of the people which were not the sons of
[1:37:22] Levi
[1:37:25] najiga
[1:37:31] that was first
[1:37:33] verse 31.

[1:37:46] amen amen now you see
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:53] the kingdom to go from him
[1:37:55] he devised in his heart
[1:37:58] that now I'll make two cars of God
[1:38:02] foreign
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:39:02] foreign
[1:39:23] and then verse 14.
[1:39:27] Second Chronicles chapter 11 verse 14.
[1:39:34] for the Levites left their suburbs and
[1:39:37] their possession and came to Judah and
[1:39:39] Jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had
[1:39:43] the cast them off from executing the
[1:39:45] priest's office unto the Lord is
[1:40:08] and the ordaining priests for the high
[1:40:10] places and for the devils and for the
[1:40:14] cows which had he had made
[1:40:17] a way before
[1:40:20] [Music]
[1:40:27] praise the name of Allah the Bible says
[1:40:30] that the Levites
[1:40:33] left their suburbs
[1:40:36] and their positions
[1:40:42] praise the name of it
[1:40:44] they left their Villages
[1:40:47] they left their Investments
[1:40:50] they left their positions
[1:40:53] and they went to Judah and Jerusalem
[1:40:58] why we're actually to serve the Lord
[1:41:02] in the place where they were which
[1:41:04] foreign
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:56] it comes to a time of decision
[1:42:01] foreign
[1:42:56] [Applause]
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:09] we want you to give them all back
[1:43:12] together
[1:43:15] I have nothing of myself but I give you
[1:43:19] everything
[1:43:20] praise the name of that in the message
[1:43:23] the unfailing reality of the Living God
[1:43:26] who says God can only use what we give
[1:43:29] to people
[1:43:31] now but there is a lot of you will say

[1:44:23] even hospitals were closing down
[1:44:27] even big schools like Buddha we are
[1:44:29] telling their teachers who are supported
[1:44:31] by parents please this is Nani paid
[1:44:34] leave
[1:44:55] one they made money
[1:44:58] until to be on oxygen for only one day
[1:45:03] three millions are five million
[1:45:07] there's somebody in the building I don't
[1:45:09] have many millions
[1:45:11] unfortunately the person died and then
[1:45:14] they wouldn't release the dead body
[1:45:16] until you pay them there
[1:45:19] but now if being on Nokia they were
[1:45:22] charging five Millions
[1:45:26] how much do we need to pay to God
[1:45:28] foreign
[1:45:32] how much can you pay to God
[1:45:40] you have to preserve some oxygen in my
[1:45:43] house foreign
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:36] surrender to him
[1:46:38] that he can lead you and guide you and
[1:46:42] put you into places where he wants you
[1:46:45] to go again lead of him
[1:46:51] God wants all of us
[1:46:55] and he wants all of you
[1:47:00] everything you have God wants you
[1:47:04] praise the name of Allah God also wants
[1:47:07] your talents
[1:47:08] God wants your possessions
[1:47:11] put them into his use put them into his
[1:47:15] kingdom praise the name because it is he
[1:47:18] who has made your being
[1:47:21] it is who gives you understanding in our
[1:47:24] hearts
[1:47:25] he's the one who gives you the
[1:47:27] understanding he's the one who gives you
[1:47:29] the ability
[1:48:06] the message prepares us for the Rapture
[1:48:10] the message prepares us for the second
[1:48:13] coming of God
[1:48:16] now in the message things that are to be
[1:48:19] moved
[1:48:21] a prophet is a reflect of God
[1:48:25] he is
[1:48:27] so that he cannot speak his own words
[1:48:32] it has to be Goddess
[1:48:35] that is speaks he is just like a
[1:48:39] reflector
[1:48:40] and he is goddess mouthpiece
[1:48:48] we've had the mouthpiece in this place
[1:48:55] take him to the message
[1:48:57] [Applause]
[1:49:02] and you will profess prosper
[1:49:05] in the message as long as you hear the
[1:49:09] message you are obeying the message the
[1:49:13] message will make you prosperous
[1:49:16] man the message you will make you
[1:49:19] prosperous
[1:49:20] doing the things of God
[1:49:23] following the things so now we see that
[1:49:27] in the times of
[1:49:29] Israeli there was feminine
[1:49:33] and then we see that in every time of
[1:49:36] Elijah
[1:49:37] in the time of the faster
[1:49:41] in the times of Elisha Mexico
[1:49:45] in terms of John the Baptist there was
[1:49:48] also feminine of hearing the words
[1:49:50] you know they were following the
[1:49:52] traditions of Maine
[1:49:54] and now when they had the word of Christ
[1:49:57] they couldn't take him because they were
[1:50:01] following Traditions they were used to
[1:50:03] the Traditions like in the time of the
[1:50:06] robots
[1:50:08] so even now in the end time the Bible
[1:50:11] says there will be Famine of here
[1:50:14] [Applause]
[1:50:15] but the Famine of hearing them
[1:50:18] comes because people have rejected the
[1:50:22] truth
[1:50:32] in second chronicles
[1:50:52] [Applause]
[1:50:57] [Applause]
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:28] they rejected the ministers
[1:51:36] foreign
[1:51:54] it was a condition of rebellion against
[1:51:58] these things
[1:52:01] which are going to give an example as I
[1:52:03] try to wind up
[1:52:06] praise the name of Allah let us go to
[1:52:09] the Book of Jeremiah
[1:52:14] chapter 18 and verse 18.
[1:52:18] the Bible says
[1:52:22] then say they come and let us devise
[1:52:25] devices against Jeremiah for the Lord
[1:52:28] shall not perish from the priest Nora
[1:52:31] cancer from the wise nor at the word
[1:52:34] from the Prophet come let us might him
[1:52:37] with the tongue and let us not give heed
[1:52:39] to any of his words unfortunate yeah
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:10] they said let us get devices
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:23] put them off from their work
[1:53:26] s
[1:53:30] so they were without teaching priests
[1:53:34] and then they said Prophet
[1:53:36] the word always comes to the prophet
[1:53:39] said no don't hear anything he tells you
[1:53:42] uh
[1:53:45] and the Bible says let us might them
[1:53:48] with the tongues
[1:53:50] let us talk even against them let us not
[1:53:54] give it to whatever they are saying let
[1:53:57] us block our ears and this is what the
[1:54:00] GC generation is doing
[1:54:02] it has blocked their ears
[1:54:06] to the message
[1:54:08] they have put away the message
[1:54:11] they are put down the messenger
[1:54:13] no we don't have anything to do with
[1:54:16] that we don't want to hear that one we
[1:54:18] don't want to hear that
[1:54:22] they were telling this man who was
[1:54:24] healed
[1:54:25] for us we have Moses for that man we
[1:54:28] don't know then he said that man was
[1:54:31] born in the scene that man is the prince
[1:54:34] of Belize
[1:54:37] there was mayor in Jesus
[1:54:40] that nobody would hear him
[1:54:43] you can imagine even
[1:54:51] but can you imagine they were planning
[1:54:55] to kill Lazarus
[1:54:58] because the miracle of Resurrection was
[1:55:01] great
[1:55:03] yet it was part of the scripts
[1:55:06] so they are planning to hit to kill him
[1:55:10] so that people don't follow Jesus
[1:55:12] because
[1:55:26] where did the spirit of God yeah
[1:55:36] [Applause]
[1:55:51] [Applause]
[1:55:55] the son of Hosea and all the people from
[1:55:58] the list even to the greatest came near
[1:56:01] uh
[1:56:16] and said unto Jeremiah the prophet let
[1:56:20] we be City our supplication to be
[1:56:23] accepted before you and pray for us unto
[1:56:27] the Lord thy God even for all
[1:56:29] discriminant for we are left but a few
[1:56:32] of many as thine eyes do beholders
[1:56:58] that the Lord thy God may show us the
[1:57:01] way we are in we may walk under the
[1:57:04] thing that we may do
[1:57:07] um
[1:57:14] then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them
[1:57:18] I have heard you behold I will pray unto
[1:57:22] the Lord your God according to your
[1:57:24] words and it shall come to pass that
[1:57:26] whatsoever think the Lord shall answer
[1:57:28] you I will declare it to you I will keep
[1:57:32] nothing back from you oh yeah
[1:57:54] then they said to Jeremiah the Lord be a
[1:57:57] true and faithful witness between us if
[1:57:59] we do not even according to all things
[1:58:02] for which the Lord thy God shall send
[1:58:05] thee to us
[1:58:09] um
[1:58:19] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[1:58:22] we will obey the voice of the Lord Our
[1:58:24] God to whom we send thee and it may be
[1:58:28] well with us when we obey the voice of
[1:58:30] the Lord your God
[1:58:36] yeah yeah
[1:58:38] yes
[1:58:47] praise the name of Allah so he said we
[1:58:51] will obey account without wonder it
[1:58:54] doesn't matter we are going to obey
[1:58:55] everything
[1:58:57] and now when Jeremiah went to the Lord
[1:59:01] the Lord told him
[1:59:04] let these children of
[1:59:06] Israeli let them not to go to Egypt but
[1:59:10] let them stay in their lives I will
[1:59:13] protect them I will keep them
[1:59:16] let them not be afraid of who you know
[1:59:23] when Jeremiah came and brought the word
[1:59:26] of God to the ruminants of the Jews
[1:59:30] the Bible says God has not spoken to you
[1:59:39] and he said we have supplication
[1:59:43] our prayer to the Lord let the Lord tell
[1:59:46] us his mind what he tells us whether it
[1:59:50] is
[1:59:51] we are going to do that
[1:59:54] verse chapter 43 Verse
[1:59:57] and it came to pass that when Jeremiah
[2:00:01] had made an end of speaking unto all the
[2:00:03] people
[2:00:05] yeah
[2:00:10] for which the Lord
[2:00:13] to him even all these foreign
[2:00:29] those speakers falsely the Lord Our God
[2:00:32] does not send it to say go not in Egypt
[2:00:35] to sojourn them
[2:01:00] foreign
[2:01:25] they wouldn't believe the true prophet
[2:01:27] of God
[2:01:28] so they never prospered
[2:01:32] they were all destroyed
[2:01:34] praise the name of Allah we are living
[2:01:37] in this end times
[2:01:43] you know where we see a lot of things
[2:01:46] are happening
[2:01:48] we are in the Days of Elijah the
[2:01:51] prophets
[2:01:52] praise the name of us you know Elijah's
[2:01:55] Spirit comes five times
[2:01:57] the first time it was Elijah himself
[2:02:01] the second time it was Elisha in the
[2:02:05] second Kings chapter two the Bible says
[2:02:08] the spirit of Elijah rests upon Elijah
[2:02:12] the third time it was on John the
[2:02:15] Baptist Luke chapter one praise the name
[2:02:19] of our Lord he says will come in the
[2:02:21] spirit
[2:02:22] and now the first time
[2:02:41] was sent foreign
[2:03:25] technology
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:04:25] foreign
[2:04:54] people who don't have God they can
[2:04:58] afford to come out and walk on streets
[2:05:00] barely naked
[2:05:03] in those developed countries there are
[2:05:06] places where they go and they say is it
[2:05:08] a naked beach
[2:05:12] completely naked the money naked the
[2:05:16] woman naked in some of these countries
[2:05:20] they have days
[2:05:22] where they drive when they are naked
[2:05:24] walk when they are naked
[2:05:26] ride motorcycles
[2:05:34] so we see that Vision was also full
[2:05:37] first of Allah
[2:05:40] and then the sexist Vision
[2:05:43] he was shown a woman loading United
[2:05:45] States of America
[2:05:47] but the time he was speaking
[2:05:50] the women in the USA were not voted
[2:05:54] Africa
[2:06:12] and the vice president is a woman vice
[2:06:14] president so what what what is that yet
[2:06:18] these seven major Visions
[2:06:19] we are given to him and the voice these
[2:06:24] things will happen before the end of the
[2:06:26] world
[2:06:29] now only one vision is left
[2:06:32] the seventh one and the seventh one
[2:06:35] which is the blowing out of America
[2:06:38] America
[2:06:49] [Applause]
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:15] [Applause]
[2:07:25] in Russia
[2:07:30] [Applause]
[2:07:46] before the end of last
[2:07:51] groups and videos
[2:07:55] and say that the people in Mexico
[2:07:58] you know Mexico is in the southern part
[2:08:01] of the USA Mexico America is another
[2:08:04] country in the South
[2:08:08] the people in Mexico
[2:08:10] we'll see the nuclear Banning America
[2:08:13] like a
[2:08:14] mushrooms
[2:08:18] then they showed the picture of a
[2:08:20] mushroom saying that's how America is
[2:08:22] going to be foreign
[2:08:51] God sent Joseph to Egypt when they had
[2:08:55] Joseph
[2:08:56] they didn't perish even this generation
[2:09:01] God has sent us a message
[2:09:08] [Applause]
[2:09:13] I think 45 or 46 or 47. I've forgotten
[2:09:17] the time
[2:09:19] had the visitation of the angels
[2:09:22] and then the Angels saying as Moses was
[2:09:26] given to signs you've also been given to
[2:09:30] signs
[2:09:31] praise the name of Allah the fastest
[2:09:34] sign that God gave Moses putting the
[2:09:38] hand in the bottom
[2:09:40] and then to become leprosy and then he
[2:09:43] puts the hand back and the repo says
[2:09:45] here then the second sign holding his
[2:09:49] sticks throwing it down
[2:09:51] foreign
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:03] don't touch that stick don't touch that
[2:10:06] snake by the head
[2:10:08] it will bite you without said just touch
[2:10:11] the table towards the real snake
[2:10:14] praise the name of our Lord until when
[2:10:17] guns and gambling through theirs
[2:10:23] it was real where are you going so
[2:10:25] brother Brandon was given to science
[2:10:27] the first sign was of the hands
[2:10:31] a sick person on his hand
[2:10:33] and then he would vibrate
[2:10:36] different colors and so on
[2:10:39] and then dots and stuff like then he
[2:10:42] would be able to know that you are sick
[2:10:44] of this
[2:10:45] you are sick of this so when he was pray
[2:10:48] for that person
[2:10:50] and the hand and the person gets here
[2:10:52] then the hand would stop vibrating so
[2:10:56] you declare the person you are here
[2:10:58] that sign works
[2:11:01] then he was given the second son
[2:11:06] is the sign of the Messiah
[2:11:10] foreign
[2:11:53] foreign
[2:12:45] Luke chapter 17.
[2:12:49] foreign
[2:13:13] they did it they dragged they married
[2:13:16] wives they were given in marriage until
[2:13:18] the day Noah entered into the ark and
[2:13:21] the flood came and destroyed them all
[2:13:23] burying
[2:13:32] likewise also as it was in the days of
[2:13:35] Lord they did it they drank they bought
[2:13:39] they sowed they planted they builded
[2:13:51] but the same day that lot went out of
[2:13:54] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[2:13:57] heaven and destroyed them all right
[2:14:06] even thus shall it be in the day when
[2:14:10] the son of man is revealed
[2:14:16] um
[2:14:19] he says as it was in the days of Noah
[2:14:22] and if you want to know the days
[2:14:27] there was population increase the beauty
[2:14:31] of women increase
[2:14:32] there was increasing violence
[2:14:35] there was those cross marriages
[2:14:41] something which is happening in the days
[2:14:44] of Lord
[2:14:45] they were homosexuals
[2:14:48] until they were forcing Angels
[2:14:51] you know these homosexuals have no
[2:14:54] negotiations
[2:14:56] they force you but what is that
[2:14:59] that's what is happening in those
[2:15:02] countries they force children to change
[2:15:04] their sex
[2:15:23] [Applause]
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:16:06] that's all foreign
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:17:12] and robbed what was there and started
[2:17:16] drawing
[2:17:18] one by one putting every details
[2:17:23] proving the seven Church agency preached
[2:17:26] okay
[2:17:30] that's your message
[2:17:34] we have the mouthpiece of God
[2:17:39] has sent us Elijah
[2:17:42] and we need to take it
[2:17:47] if we are going to prosper
[2:17:50] through the prophets
[2:17:54] in 1963 he got the vision of seven
[2:17:58] angels and then he was told go and
[2:18:01] preach the seven seas
[2:18:05] and then he comes and then starts
[2:18:07] preaching the Seventh Son
[2:18:09] and every morning an angel came down
[2:18:18] [Applause]
[2:18:31] love you
[2:18:53] [Applause]
[2:19:16] foreign
[2:19:23] therefore we
[2:19:25] ought to give more honest heed to these
[2:19:29] things which we've had lest at any time
[2:19:33] we should let them sleep
[2:19:55] [Music]
[2:20:05] [Applause]
[2:20:19] [Applause]
[2:20:30] [Applause]
[2:20:34] but when you
[2:21:10] [Applause]
[2:21:33] praise the name
[2:21:35] [Applause]

[2:23:22] if it isn't but if the life is is not
[2:23:27] there are you oh
[2:23:34] it's such a funny one it's such a glory
[2:23:37] to God
[2:23:40] and tell me that that is Christ don't
[2:23:42] come into any question Christ was humble
[2:23:44] Christian
[2:23:47] go into a town okay let me jump to that
[2:23:51] then he says
[2:23:54] false keep enough of the truth to make a
[2:23:57] form of godliness
[2:24:03] just scroll down false keep enough of
[2:24:07] the truth to make it a form of godliness
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:13] in other words they do a lot of
[2:24:16] impersonations
[2:24:22] [Applause]
[2:24:24] to make it a form of God
[2:24:27] and listen now I'm saying something here
[2:24:30] I want you to listen them kind of false
[2:24:34] conception
[2:24:40] you know what a false conception is
[2:24:48] yeah conception
[2:24:52] leads millions of people to a false bus
[2:24:58] false teachers lead the people to
[2:25:01] believe in a sensation
[2:25:04] cause you jacked all over you got it
[2:25:08] or because you got a real funny feeling
[2:25:11] went over here
[2:25:13] oh you've seen the lights in front of
[2:25:16] you
[2:25:17] and got blind and staggered
[2:25:20] like just jacket on you
[2:25:23] that's right you got it oh you know what
[2:25:26] you are you are a manifest Son of God
[2:25:30] where do you find yourself
[2:25:33] defeated that's right
[2:25:38] [Applause]
[2:26:35] and again they pure word was lost for
[2:26:38] organizations
[2:26:41] for organization tends towards dogma and
[2:26:44] Crips
[2:26:46] are not the simple one they could no
[2:26:50] longer speak for God
[2:26:52] then God sent Western
[2:26:55] and it was the voice with the word
[2:26:59] the people who took his Revelation from
[2:27:02] God became the living Epistles
[2:27:10] none of all men for their generation
[2:27:13] when the method is failed
[2:27:16] God raised up others
[2:27:19] and so it has gone on through the years
[2:27:22] until this last night
[2:27:26] there is again another people in the
[2:27:29] Life
[2:27:29] who under their Messenger
[2:27:32] will be the final voice
[2:27:43] [Applause]
[2:28:02] [Applause]
[2:28:32] the world does reject all the time
[2:28:36] but now we are living in a time
[2:28:39] where are we
[2:28:41] as the temple of God
[2:28:43] as the Lively stones that have been put
[2:28:46] into this building
[2:28:49] that have been put into the bride of
[2:28:51] Christ
[2:28:53] we become the mouthpiece of God we will
[2:28:57] become the voice of God
[2:28:59] how does that happen
[2:29:01] take it to the message
[2:29:04] take it with all your heart it will
[2:29:07] change your thinking to change your
[2:29:09] speech to change your actions
[2:29:17] like in the days of Egypt they prospered
[2:29:20] by the message of Joseph
[2:29:23] they never perish in the days of you
[2:29:26] know
[2:29:28] and Joshua building rebuilding
