[2:20:15] God all the joury master that where we
[2:20:18] are he made us to reach
[2:20:25] amen I want us to read just one
[2:20:33] verse
[2:20:36] bless amen so let's go to the Book of
[2:20:42] Mark chapter
[2:20:46] 11 just read one verse
[2:20:51] the Bible
[2:20:53] says verse
[2:20:56] 22 Mark
[2:21:00] 11se
[2:21:03] 22
[2:21:09] Jesus and he answered and he and Jesus
[2:21:14] answering them
[2:21:16] sayto them
[2:21:21] have faith in
[2:21:24] God the Lord
[2:21:27] blessing reading of the
[2:21:29] words you may be
[2:21:33] seated
[2:21:35] amen
[2:21:37] so you know I want to thank God for the
[2:21:42] pastors for the opportunity they gave me
[2:21:45] to stand before
[2:21:48] you I'm always challenged
[2:21:53] standing the
[2:21:56] of
[2:21:59] ithy Praise the Lord otherwise you make
[2:22:03] mistakes otherwise you make
[2:22:07] mistakes if you make
[2:22:10] mistakes you know they know how to to
[2:22:12] entangle you and get
[2:22:17] you they read the word
[2:22:21] Prophet so there's no way you can
[2:22:25] bypass it's such a
[2:22:29] challenge but we only depend on thece of
[2:22:34] God Amen so here the Bible
[2:22:42] said Jesus was telling these
[2:22:46] people that have faith in God
[2:22:52] so my title is faith in
[2:22:58] God Amen so you
[2:23:02] see it's a plain
[2:23:06] statement No play like light you know
[2:23:10] it's weak and light and you
[2:23:15] know which someone can take for granted
[2:23:23] Jesus said have faith in
[2:23:29] God Amen this
[2:23:33] statement it's not easy to
[2:23:36] make praise the lord it's not easy
[2:23:38] without
[2:23:41] God because why did Jesus say how faith
[2:23:44] in
[2:23:48] him you know one time
[2:23:52] Jesus was
[2:23:54] hungry and he wanted to
[2:23:56] eat so while he was
[2:24:00] passing
[2:24:03] far there was a fig
[2:24:06] tree praise the Lord
[2:24:12] that Jesus wanted to eat on
[2:24:16] it and then the tree had no fruit
[2:24:21] praise the
[2:24:23] Lord
[2:24:25] then when he found it not with
[2:24:29] fruits he
[2:24:31] said I think verse
[2:24:35] 12 verse 12 he said
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:52] yes verse 12 okay let me go to
[2:24:56] 14 verse
[2:24:59] 14 and Jesus answered and said unto eat
[2:25:04] the
[2:25:08] tree no man eat fruit there there no man
[2:25:13] eat fruit of the herea forever
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:25] and his dises
[2:25:28] it when they had
[2:25:31] it they kept
[2:25:33] it praise the Lord they kept it but the
[2:25:36] truth
[2:25:37] is this tree had no
[2:25:42] problem praise the Lord it had no
[2:25:45] problem it was not because it was not
[2:25:48] bearing fruits
[2:25:52] this tree was not
[2:25:58] Burse verse
[2:26:01] says and seeing a fig tree
[2:26:07] far having
[2:26:11] leaves if happily he may find anything
[2:26:18] there and when he came to e he found
[2:26:23] nothing and the Bible says but
[2:26:27] thees he found nothing but the
[2:26:30] leaves but now for the time of the
[2:26:36] Fig was not yet so the tree had no
[2:26:41] problem like you find doesn't okay you
[2:26:44] find the season is not
[2:26:47] for will
[2:26:49] be but the fruits will wait for the
[2:26:53] season so this big tree had no problem
[2:26:58] is that right
[2:27:00] whereby
[2:27:02] Jesus wanted to demonstrate something
[2:27:07] here and what he wanted to
[2:27:10] demonstrate
[2:27:12] verse something what Jesus wanted to
[2:27:15] demonstrate
[2:27:16] here then in the morning
[2:27:20] they passed by they saw the fig tree
[2:27:23] dried
[2:27:25] up the
[2:27:27] roots and
[2:27:29] then Peter calling to
[2:27:33] remembrance him Master behold the Fig
[2:27:37] Tree which thou cast castest is withered
[2:27:43] away
[2:27:45] 22 and Jesus said answering and
[2:27:48] answering sat to them
[2:27:52] have
[2:27:53] faith praise the Lord where God wanted
[2:27:57] to demonstrate
[2:28:00] Fai he used some
[2:28:06] impossibility he used some
[2:28:09] impossibility
[2:28:10] whereby it's very
[2:28:14] hard if a tree is given
[2:28:18] environment it will bear fruits it was
[2:28:21] called to bear
[2:28:24] fruit given
[2:28:26] season it will bring forth praise the
[2:28:30] Lord but Jesus wanted to demonstrate to
[2:28:34] these
[2:28:35] men you got to have faith in
[2:28:40] God so he used the tree and
[2:28:44] cast and it right but behind it
[2:28:50] the
[2:28:51] scenario Jesus wanted them to have
[2:29:00] faith that they can
[2:29:03] say praise the Lord Jesus wanted
[2:29:09] them
[2:29:11] whatever speak but he us that tree to
[2:29:15] show them that you can do it even when
[2:29:18] I'm not around
[2:29:21] you know something like because he left
[2:29:24] the power
[2:29:25] behind all these
[2:29:28] things praise the Lord Jesus said have
[2:29:32] faith in
[2:29:34] God praise the Lord now the
[2:29:39] illustration of making the mountain move
[2:29:42] to
[2:29:46] Seas is abolutely
[2:29:57] praise the Lord how can somebody
[2:30:02] call come and fall in L
[2:30:07] Victor first of
[2:30:12] all
[2:30:14] because
[2:30:18] Victoria praise
[2:30:21] okay on
[2:30:23] it there are
[2:30:25] people so you mean you're going to kill
[2:30:29] them praise the Lord Jesus wanted
[2:30:35] them even believe the
[2:30:39] imposs if you have faith in
[2:30:42] him so the fig tree
[2:30:45] right because it doesn't bear fruits
[2:30:51] because the Bible says at that moment
[2:30:54] when Jesus found
[2:30:57] it was not
[2:31:00] yet praise the Lord the season was not
[2:31:03] yet Jesus wanted to demonstrate
[2:31:06] power behind a spoken
[2:31:10] word praise the Lord
[2:31:13] only have faith
[2:31:16] in and that's
[2:31:18] all praise the Lord have faith in
[2:31:21] God is
[2:31:24] impossible have faith in
[2:31:26] God praise the Lord but you know
[2:31:34] sometimes According To
[2:31:38] Jesus that's the
[2:31:40] point the hardest
[2:31:43] moment
[2:31:46] impossible that impossible moment
[2:31:50] is when God requires you to have faith
[2:31:53] in
[2:31:56] him praise the Lord many of us we know
[2:32:00] the imposs in our
[2:32:02] lives we know them just
[2:32:09] imagine becoming a
[2:32:13] manager Man Without
[2:32:16] papers in Uganda here
[2:32:20] It seems
[2:32:26] impossible becoming a prime
[2:32:31] minister it's impossible without papers
[2:32:34] without
[2:32:37] elections
[2:32:39] but was
[2:32:41] one
[2:32:43] without without
[2:32:46] election but just faith in God
[2:32:50] made him what he
[2:32:52] was but where did he go through to reach
[2:32:55] there in
[2:32:57] imposs prison casted down in the
[2:33:01] dit did he have faith that he can become
[2:33:04] a prime minister when he was in the
[2:33:09] ditch the Lord The
[2:33:11] Impossible when God calls
[2:33:14] us to have faith in
[2:33:17] him and while we have faith in
[2:33:21] I want to assure you nothing is
[2:33:25] impossible praise the Lord nothing is
[2:33:28] impossible where God
[2:33:31] is the Lord there's nothing which is
[2:33:36] impossible
[2:33:38] unless he has not come for
[2:33:42] that praise the Lord because Jesus said
[2:33:47] there were many leers in the days of n
[2:33:53] the
[2:34:00] reason so faith in
[2:34:04] God is what we do all things that we
[2:34:09] think they are
[2:34:12] impossible like in this book
[2:34:15] Mark the gospel tells us and Mark has
[2:34:19] always emphasized
[2:34:23] Believers EMP
[2:34:27] Believers to believe
[2:34:30] God
[2:34:32] only praise the Lord
[2:34:37] otherwise without believing
[2:34:41] God then how can he work for
[2:34:45] with praise the Lord without God how can
[2:34:49] I mean without believing in
[2:34:51] God how can he work with
[2:34:54] you praise the Lord God can't work with
[2:34:58] people who don't have faith in
[2:35:00] him work with
[2:35:03] people who doubt his
[2:35:07] word praise the
[2:35:09] Lord now I want us to go through some of
[2:35:13] the
[2:35:15] things which are
[2:35:17] impossible but to God
[2:35:20] they were
[2:35:21] possible praise the Lord now faith in
[2:35:25] God it is aing
[2:35:28] [Music]
[2:35:29] thing to many
[2:35:32] people as I said it is not
[2:35:37] easy that statement is not
[2:35:41] easy so brother
[2:35:44] say faith in
[2:35:47] God it is a St
[2:35:52] to
[2:35:54] people going ask
[2:35:57] how praise the Lord faith in God is a
[2:36:02] staggering thing to many
[2:36:05] people and yet we ought to be ashamed of
[2:36:09] [Music]
[2:36:11] ourselves to confess that we don't have
[2:36:14] faith in
[2:36:16] God first there is cowardness or
[2:36:21] [Music]
[2:36:23] cowards who di 10,000
[2:36:29] deaths while they they are here on
[2:36:32] Earth that's what the prophet says
[2:36:36] dying why they on
[2:36:40] Earth why are they dying because they
[2:36:43] are
[2:36:44] cowards and God hates cowards
[2:36:49] the God hates cowards people are of
[2:36:54] cowards don't say this death which we
[2:36:58] think about and you know that death
[2:37:00] there are many
[2:37:04] death somebody can die of
[2:37:07] cancer and is not
[2:37:12] healed
[2:37:14] brother God told
[2:37:16] him nothing shall stand before you
[2:37:21] even
[2:37:22] cancer but cancer is killing
[2:37:26] believer don't Mis me please I want to
[2:37:30] talk about the
[2:37:34] imposs praise the
[2:37:36] Lord is killing
[2:37:39] people and yet the
[2:37:42] healer is telling
[2:37:45] us what is hard before
[2:37:47] you cancer
[2:37:50] have faith in
[2:37:52] God praise the Lord
[2:37:57] another and usually
[2:38:00] people who have faith are people who
[2:38:03] have
[2:38:08] experience praise the Lord those who
[2:38:11] have
[2:38:12] faith they that have
[2:38:17] experiences praise the Lord
[2:38:20] talk about one day we here
[2:38:25] overnight and I remember brother was
[2:38:31] testifying in a certain Lake
[2:38:36] there so when you think about people who
[2:38:39] can
[2:38:42] call not gone through
[2:38:44] se you don't have
[2:38:47] experience you don't have
[2:38:49] and it is very hard you to have faith in
[2:38:54] that
[2:38:55] but knows what it
[2:38:59] takes to redeem you out of
[2:39:01] there most of us who have gone in
[2:39:06] legs this Rivers we see
[2:39:08] here I remember I I know he knows it I
[2:39:12] know he knows when you are in Lake
[2:39:14] Victoria Lake Victoria you can neither
[2:39:17] see where you came from
[2:39:20] neither east or west or north
[2:39:26] whatever
[2:39:28] water so where are you
[2:39:31] going praise the Lord but these people
[2:39:34] wanted to
[2:39:37] gr and it was you know me I'm just
[2:39:40] talking it
[2:39:42] plainly brought it until I was like now
[2:39:45] how did this man come out
[2:39:49] but then has
[2:39:52] experience in case it
[2:39:55] happens have
[2:39:57] faith and he
[2:40:04] know
[2:40:06] experience brings Faith that's what
[2:40:09] brother
[2:40:11] say that
[2:40:13] experience brings
[2:40:16] Faith praise the Lord so usually people
[2:40:19] have
[2:40:20] faith they have
[2:40:23] experience praise the Lord so
[2:40:27] now you know one
[2:40:30] day there was a
[2:40:33] man
[2:40:35] David this
[2:40:37] man he believed God and he knew god
[2:40:42] father told him how God
[2:40:46] operates not only that but he went
[2:40:49] through
[2:40:51] experience of how God
[2:40:54] works to I mean to believe I mean to for
[2:40:58] [Music]
[2:41:00] sure I don't know how many people have
[2:41:02] seen
[2:41:03] [Music]
[2:41:05] Lions you know how big a lion let me say
[2:41:09] a lion is not such
[2:41:10] [Music]
[2:41:11] big a is large and big
[2:41:17] [Music]
[2:41:19] throw down the
[2:41:22] right isn't it but a man cannot throw it
[2:41:30] down in other words to
[2:41:35] us can carry us on the
[2:41:39] MTH is that right it can carry us on the
[2:41:44] M
[2:41:45] sometimes tin
[2:41:49] can
[2:41:50] car and CLS with it on a
[2:41:54] tree but to
[2:42:02] us
[2:42:05] water don't think somebody can climb
[2:42:08] steps with
[2:42:12] them
[2:42:14] back like to even get support and stuff
[2:42:17] like that
[2:42:19] but I want to assure
[2:42:21] you while he was in the in the
[2:42:25] bush looking after the the flock of the
[2:42:29] father there came something that
[2:42:31] threatened the
[2:42:34] flock threatening
[2:42:37] animal but God stood with
[2:42:40] David and gave him
[2:42:43] confidence training him the
[2:42:46] experience to depend on God
[2:42:50] because he didn't have a
[2:42:52] b nether he have a
[2:42:54] gun so what was the depend of David for
[2:43:00] that if it
[2:43:03] wasn't praise the Lord sometimes
[2:43:07] dogs can
[2:43:10] threaten if you don't have
[2:43:15] a can make even I don't know how you can
[2:43:18] I don't know
[2:43:26] running but very small animal
[2:43:30] like praise the Lord so in other words
[2:43:34] David was teaching him
[2:43:37] experience of something that was
[2:43:40] coming he even didn't know and what was
[2:43:44] that he was
[2:43:46] glor praise the Lord he went through
[2:43:50] for so that can develop
[2:43:53] experience which will bring
[2:43:57] Faith act on God's
[2:44:00] program praise the Lord and here
[2:44:04] comes very young not trained in the
[2:44:08] Army and here
[2:44:10] goes the father sends him check on your
[2:44:15] brothers are they alive
[2:44:19] some food to them so here comes
[2:44:23] David on the
[2:44:25] ground on the
[2:44:28] battle is hearing
[2:44:30] someone threatening the whole arm of
[2:44:36] God imagine the trained
[2:44:42] of
[2:44:43] Israel just one voice it is threatening
[2:44:47] the whole nation
[2:44:52] let's go to
[2:44:53] [Music]
[2:44:57] First praise the Lord first Samuel
[2:45:02] 1 praise the Lord
[2:45:06] gor verse I think I just want one verse
[2:45:13] 11 is calling who can come and encounter
[2:45:17] me
[2:45:21] among one
[2:45:22] man to come and encounter me
[2:45:26] 11 praise the Lord and
[2:45:31] then the Bible says well he was
[2:45:36] talking when the
[2:45:39] king and all
[2:45:42] Israel heard these
[2:45:47] words they were
[2:45:50] dismayed and
[2:45:52] greatly afraid now this is a
[2:45:56] nation one man threatening them
[2:46:00] all and at the end of the day they don't
[2:46:03] have even one solution for
[2:46:07] him they started
[2:46:10] trembling you know the king you are the
[2:46:13] one who has more
[2:46:14] experience you should go there my friend
[2:46:17] you King was
[2:46:20] afraid who was the most trained
[2:46:24] man the most giant in
[2:46:28] Israel praise the Lord afraid of just
[2:46:31] one
[2:46:32] man the whole
[2:46:34] Army none could stand
[2:46:37] him look at how God does
[2:46:40] things David is coming find such things
[2:46:44] then he asking them who is this uncircum
[2:46:54] Frey is
[2:46:56] afraid one manav
[2:47:01] the he asking a question of Mo to
[2:47:08] theise the
[2:47:11] Lord then he said
[2:47:30] then he said I want to go to verse
[2:47:34] [Music]
[2:47:51] verse 33 was 30
[2:47:57] something the Bible
[2:48:05] says then and David said to S let no man
[2:48:10] heart
[2:48:13] fail of him thy servant will go and
[2:48:17] fight with this
[2:48:21] the Lord this man everyone is afraid of
[2:48:27] him why because they don't have
[2:48:31] experience of
[2:48:34] God where had they got that
[2:48:36] experience to stand the
[2:48:40] imposs they had no experience they were
[2:48:43] depending on the training they had gone
[2:48:45] through
[2:48:49] and they had had
[2:48:50] history about this giant man had
[2:48:54] defeated him
[2:48:57] in Praise the Lord now he comes here
[2:49:01] challenging the whole nation these are
[2:49:04] children of
[2:49:06] God
[2:49:09] lordus Only Have
[2:49:13] Faith praise the Lord but because they
[2:49:16] don't have experience
[2:49:19] then it is very
[2:49:21] hard apply
[2:49:23] fath
[2:49:26] what David to go there he
[2:49:32] [Music]
[2:49:33] testimony to stand
[2:49:36] glorious
[2:49:37] experience and that
[2:49:40] experience if you hear his
[2:49:42] testimony he say The God Who delivered
[2:49:46] me
[2:49:49] so he had
[2:49:50] experience God can still deliver him
[2:49:55] that's why this man to
[2:49:57] David he was
[2:50:00] nothing this impossible to
[2:50:02] Israel was possible to
[2:50:05] God praise the Lord therefore because of
[2:50:09] this man's experience with
[2:50:12] God brought faith and took away
[2:50:16] fear and took away
[2:50:19] card and then
[2:50:23] cowardness and then God came and
[2:50:26] stood on
[2:50:28] his praise the Lord because he had a
[2:50:32] good
[2:50:33] word is this
[2:50:38] uncircumcised then was say
[2:50:43] wow the army of
[2:50:46] God then God said
[2:50:50] a might
[2:50:52] coner prise the Lord so God
[2:50:55] him
[2:50:58] then
[2:51:00] nothing praise the Lord was nothing with
[2:51:05] God The
[2:51:07] Impossible they are
[2:51:09] possible praise the Lord in other words
[2:51:13] where man
[2:51:14] ends that is the beginning of God
[2:51:19] where you have
[2:51:22] ended God is just planning even to
[2:51:27] start praise the
[2:51:29] Lord people
[2:51:35] ended they were afraid this man may come
[2:51:39] for
[2:51:40] us they were
[2:51:42] afraid praise the Lord but the
[2:51:45] impossible God makes them possible
[2:51:50] then if God is for
[2:51:53] us
[2:51:55] Us
[2:51:57] Praise us I doubt
[2:52:02] whether until one p
[2:52:05] say sometimes children of God can live a
[2:52:10] life that can make the
[2:52:14] devil doesn't understand anything
[2:52:20] CRA where you can know this that theil
[2:52:24] can run
[2:52:25] czy this David knows it and he that
[2:52:29] story because even when he said I'm
[2:52:32] going for
[2:52:34] that the king said my
[2:52:38] boy don't don't come here called
[2:52:43] you
[2:52:45] Brothers go back home
[2:52:48] you mean you can stand
[2:52:52] him
[2:52:54] with what what
[2:52:57] a imagine
[2:53:05] mancing them I'm the only one has
[2:53:08] experience to
[2:53:12] keep before he finishes the statement
[2:53:18] praise the Lord first of all to shoot a
[2:53:24] g no
[2:53:25] experience do you know
[2:53:29] to do you know how to salute for
[2:53:34] the so which stat you
[2:53:38] tell even before you reach
[2:53:44] them the Lord but David for that
[2:53:51] just imagine you are the captain of
[2:53:56] that if I was
[2:53:58] one I take off
[2:54:03] myav has defeated
[2:54:06] me praise the
[2:54:11] Lord with the
[2:54:13] imposs is possible to
[2:54:16] him and if God is for
[2:54:19] us then why do
[2:54:23] we reason we don't have experience with
[2:54:29] him praise the Lord if you don't have
[2:54:32] experience
[2:54:33] with very easy to The
[2:54:40] Impossible sometimes you explain
[2:54:44] them they very right
[2:54:49] when they are very right if when the
[2:54:52] doctor looks at your
[2:54:54] report
[2:54:56] it but when God says it can't
[2:55:02] Beed then why why don't you depend on
[2:55:06] him praise the
[2:55:09] Lord praise the Lord so without
[2:55:13] experience it's hard to live with the
[2:55:16] life of faith
[2:55:18] that's why Jesus
[2:55:22] said a very easy
[2:55:25] statement but it's very hard to
[2:55:30] stand if you don't have experience with
[2:55:34] Christ praise the lord we sing
[2:55:37] songs to be like
[2:55:42] Jesus but have we thought how Jesus
[2:55:46] was before we want to be like
[2:55:51] him praise the Lord to be like
[2:55:55] Jesus on Earth I
[2:55:59] long thank you for
[2:56:02] longing but
[2:56:04] Christ without his
[2:56:07] experience you can't stand what he
[2:56:10] did and yet with him it's very
[2:56:16] possible I don't know
[2:56:21] C praise the Lord one thing I tell
[2:56:25] you to be like
[2:56:28] Jesus one
[2:56:31] day Jesus was on the
[2:56:34] cross praise the Lord he was on the
[2:56:37] cross and then on the cross the hands
[2:56:41] nailed
[2:56:47] across the legs
[2:56:50] nailed and he was in
[2:56:54] pain praise the Lord and then if that
[2:57:01] Jesus if that
[2:57:03] Jesus they brought something around
[2:57:08] him maybe
[2:57:11] dancing I don't think he would
[2:57:14] dance to be like
[2:57:16] Jesus praise the Lord
[2:57:18] I don't think dance on the
[2:57:22] cross is going on maybe parties at
[2:57:28] school if they not Christian
[2:57:35] parties
[2:57:38] Jesus he cannot dance the
[2:57:41] tunes reason he in pain and yet the
[2:57:46] Bible tells us car your cross and follow
[2:57:51] me then the cross is
[2:57:55] forward for you to nail
[2:58:00] there while you on
[2:58:03] the then some friend of
[2:58:07] yours brings you the
[2:58:11] Min time when we are going
[2:58:15] there put on like this
[2:58:22] office but
[2:58:24] the how will you handle
[2:58:28] such the
[2:58:29] Lord to be like
[2:58:32] Jesus as
[2:58:35] you first
[2:58:39] Christ before you
[2:58:41] for first have an experience with him
[2:58:45] you long for him otherwise
[2:58:48] a trial will
[2:58:52] come and you will forget to be like
[2:58:58] Jesus something very light and
[2:59:02] minor come before you you forget that
[2:59:08] song at the end of the day
[2:59:13] you for sure even youie
[2:59:20] but then to be like
[2:59:24] Jesus there are so many things that
[2:59:26] come and we forget the promises
[2:59:31] in but in all
[2:59:34] things
[2:59:36] Jesus have faith praise the Lord what is
[2:59:40] too
[2:59:41] hard have
[2:59:43] faith praise the Lord now another thing
[2:59:49] there was a man in the days of
[2:59:55] elij then this
[2:59:57] man one
[3:00:01] day there were
[3:00:05] scenarios that in the days of prophet
[3:00:12] El then the
[3:00:14] king
[3:00:16] said who is telling our
[3:00:22] secrets who who is telling our
[3:00:26] secrets because whenever we are going to
[3:00:29] do
[3:00:30] something it is not
[3:00:33] done in other words those
[3:00:35] days when they used to prepare to go and
[3:00:38] attack
[3:00:41] Israel would beat them in their
[3:00:45] land before they set
[3:00:49] then the person was asking who is
[3:00:52] against us in
[3:00:54] oury one
[3:00:56] man no one everyone of us is
[3:01:03] faith we are
[3:01:05] disciplined we them not to share out
[3:01:10] Secrets but there is only
[3:01:13] one can tell even the secrets of your
[3:01:22] the Lord then somebody said who is that
[3:01:27] one the
[3:01:30] king him when
[3:01:33] Hew that I wish
[3:01:41] was other if he can tell secrets in your
[3:01:46] bed then what about your
[3:01:51] movement so here comes the
[3:01:53] scenario they are aware that
[3:01:57] El theyed to attack
[3:02:01] him on their way they
[3:02:04] Rich
[3:02:06] then in the in the
[3:02:10] morning the ran out
[3:02:18] alas my
[3:02:21] master that is second Kings chapter
[3:02:25] 6 second Kings chapter
[3:02:28] 6
[3:02:30] verse
[3:02:32] 15 and he
[3:02:35] said my
[3:02:37] master what shall we
[3:02:40] do and he
[3:02:42] said that's now the
[3:02:44] prophet Second Kings chapter 6 and verse
[3:02:49] 15 he
[3:02:52] says what shall we do verse
[3:02:56] 16 then he
[3:02:59] says not for they that be with
[3:03:04] us
[3:03:06] more be with
[3:03:11] them praise the Lord this man has SW the
[3:03:15] whole Army around in the mountain
[3:03:21] and was afid why was he
[3:03:25] afraid he had no
[3:03:28] experience praise the Lord why was this
[3:03:32] this servant
[3:03:34] afraid he had no
[3:03:38] experience
[3:03:40] with the Lord surrounded
[3:03:44] them for sure we are gone
[3:03:50] but God who is of the
[3:03:56] imposs made it
[3:03:58] way praise the Lord and then he
[3:04:04] said so what I wanted here this man the
[3:04:08] servant because of lack of experience
[3:04:11] with
[3:04:12] God then fear came and when fear came
[3:04:17] what
[3:04:18] happened lacked faith in
[3:04:21] God and when heed
[3:04:24] Faith he didn't know how the Army would
[3:04:28] leave that
[3:04:30] M but what did I mean the prophet
[3:04:34] said had experience with
[3:04:37] God was not even
[3:04:39] afraid but
[3:04:41] yet come to
[3:04:48] so what happened experience with
[3:04:52] God he didn't
[3:04:54] fear what he told this
[3:04:57] man he rebed
[3:04:59] [Music]
[3:05:01] him and told him don't fear those people
[3:05:07] much as they are many the ones who are
[3:05:09] with us are more than
[3:05:13] them and what did El say
[3:05:18] he said Lord Open the Eyes of the young
[3:05:23] man and when the young
[3:05:27] man what happened the experience
[3:05:33] developed experience experience
[3:05:37] came
[3:05:38] God helped him and he had
[3:05:43] Faith therefore
[3:05:46] experience brings
[3:05:49] faith and when Faith
[3:05:52] Comes what happen the
[3:05:56] imposs
[3:05:58] turn and what
[3:06:02] happens
[3:06:08] El then he went down and asked them what
[3:06:13] do you
[3:06:14] want that El
[3:06:20] follow
[3:06:21] me he took them back to their
[3:06:24] land then he disappeared then he said go
[3:06:28] open their
[3:06:30] eyes but is that what the servant
[3:06:36] expected maybe saw this Chariot full
[3:06:40] with
[3:06:41] fire thought they going to bur them
[3:06:47] the experience of
[3:06:49] God came down into his mind and then
[3:06:55] brought Fai in
[3:06:58] him
[3:07:00] God way made way until that Army left
[3:07:05] the
[3:07:06] mountain with
[3:07:11] ignorance the enemy
[3:07:13] himself the one who them back
[3:07:17] for
[3:07:19] sure is
[3:07:21] impossible you're looking for
[3:07:24] cus
[3:07:25] [Applause]
[3:07:27] here I don't know how blind they
[3:07:31] were I can't express
[3:07:35] the most of us talk
[3:07:39] aboutness but
[3:07:41] brother the darkness that struck
[3:07:46] Egypt it was even
[3:07:50] fa it's not this one here where you put
[3:07:54] buls and you chase it
[3:07:55] out the
[3:07:58] one for is
[3:08:02] impossible
[3:08:03] us
[3:08:06] very to ask
[3:08:09] God is
[3:08:11] possible to them who don't have his
[3:08:15] experience who don't have faith in him
[3:08:18] God has already seemed
[3:08:22] impossible praise the Lord he has
[3:08:24] already
[3:08:26] seemed just imagine crossing the Red
[3:08:32] Sea leads them to
[3:08:36] the come
[3:08:41] them this side
[3:08:44] mountains this side deserts
[3:08:48] in
[3:08:49] front a SE there which you don't have
[3:08:53] experience to
[3:08:55] swim that you and run
[3:09:00] quickly after the
[3:09:02] armies had more experience in anything
[3:09:05] that was around
[3:09:07] them driving on the mountain they had
[3:09:10] more experience running in the desert
[3:09:14] they were more experienced talk about
[3:09:16] even I think swimming
[3:09:19] they had
[3:09:20] experience then the miserable
[3:09:26] Israelites
[3:09:30] the
[3:09:33] were
[3:09:37] not
[3:09:40] in and then comes a
[3:09:43] scenario that you are meant to fight
[3:09:46] with the experienced
[3:09:50] when they looked back the was coming
[3:09:55] detected they detected it was for
[3:09:59] Pharaoh they started Ting
[3:10:02] Moses was there no graes in
[3:10:06] egyp that you let us to die in the
[3:10:10] wilderness reason they had no
[3:10:14] experience on how God could help them
[3:10:18] which brought down their
[3:10:21] faith and God hates
[3:10:27] cowards that's why along the way when
[3:10:31] they were developing
[3:10:35] cowardness
[3:10:39] open because
[3:10:41] of and let me assure you where there is
[3:10:45] unbelief
[3:10:47] you know the mysteries of the
[3:10:49] Bible where there is
[3:10:52] unbelief brother says God cannot
[3:10:57] work he can't work where there is
[3:11:03] unbelief canot
[3:11:06] work praise the Lord he can't work
[3:11:10] therefore the
[3:11:14] imposs if you have faith in God
[3:11:18] praise the Lord like I
[3:11:21] [Music]
[3:11:24] said okay in the
[3:11:27] message our faith
[3:11:29] [Music]
[3:11:33] today so we talked
[3:11:37] about and then the prophet
[3:11:41] says while in the armies of the
[3:11:46] Israelites
[3:11:47] sa the great
[3:11:51] warrior if there was any man in the
[3:11:54] whole Army that was more opt to be able
[3:11:58] to
[3:11:58] [Music]
[3:12:02] go and fight this
[3:12:09] giant but the Bible says he
[3:12:14] greatly feared but yet
[3:12:17] was the most
[3:12:21] able
[3:12:24] that then he said first he was well
[3:12:29] trained
[3:12:33] Warrior he know all the
[3:12:39] Maneuvers how to dodge the
[3:12:42] Spears and how to knock them off of him
[3:12:48] and above that he was a Head and
[3:12:51] Shoulder above any man in
[3:12:56] this phally for
[3:13:01] ACH and he was a trainer of
[3:13:07] men but here comes a
[3:13:10] man without
[3:13:12] experience with all the qualities
[3:13:18] but he
[3:13:20] feared praise the Lord all the
[3:13:23] qualities but when it came to
[3:13:26] sin and action no
[3:13:29] sin when it came to
[3:13:31] action he
[3:13:34] fear praise the Lord why no
[3:13:38] experience and the prophet continues to
[3:13:41] say
[3:13:43] another he continues to say
[3:13:47] and such that is paragraph 19 and
[3:13:51] such
[3:13:54] today okay but if we
[3:13:58] notice while this giant was making his
[3:14:01] great
[3:14:04] boast and his great
[3:14:10] theologi as it would be stand there well
[3:14:14] trained to know how to fight
[3:14:18] he had never had any experience with
[3:14:24] God and SE a Pity
[3:14:28] to to see men and
[3:14:31] women who have
[3:14:33] lived church and been brought up in the
[3:14:38] cand
[3:14:41] [Music]
[3:14:43] RO okay and now the Bible
[3:14:49] yet has never witnessed an experience
[3:14:52] with
[3:14:55] God so such
[3:14:57] people they are trained in church they
[3:15:00] know the Bible the
[3:15:06] P without the experience of
[3:15:09] God when
[3:15:13] [Music]
[3:15:14] stand Lord people would
[3:15:19] fly one
[3:15:22] scenario brother Bram was on the
[3:15:26] pit and then there came a
[3:15:30] giant and the prophet says all the
[3:15:34] ministers on the platform
[3:15:45] here I don't want to State any statement
[3:15:48] against
[3:15:50] them the prophet says
[3:15:55] fled now the police which was guarding
[3:15:59] the the camp
[3:16:01] [Music]
[3:16:04] theori came against
[3:16:06] him was pushing them the prophet said
[3:16:11] leave
[3:16:12] him then the people said brother
[3:16:17] he said leave him then he came because
[3:16:21] the prophet had
[3:16:23] experience he
[3:16:26] stood but this man he had been told come
[3:16:31] and box the
[3:16:33] prophet him he come to box him one and
[3:16:40] go because he was a man who had taken
[3:16:43] all the F of people
[3:16:48] people then they they they brought him
[3:16:51] that giant now he
[3:16:53] comes and the prophet
[3:16:57] true and when he came the prophet said
[3:17:01] he went beyond his
[3:17:05] bound and when he
[3:17:08] went what
[3:17:10] happened faith in
[3:17:13] God prophet
[3:17:17] came what happened he made the man bend
[3:17:23] down kissed the
[3:17:28] Propet
[3:17:32] butet praise the Lord experience with
[3:17:36] God these
[3:17:38] Giants these Giants of ours we have
[3:17:44] Giants but when they are before us
[3:17:48] the experience we have with
[3:17:50] God can
[3:17:54] them but if you don't have God's
[3:17:57] experience
[3:17:59] Giants will make you
[3:18:02] fly even though you know the
[3:18:06] Mysteries the Lord so these
[3:18:09] Giants brother
[3:18:12] [Music]
[3:18:13] says but yet he has never witnessed an
[3:18:17] experience with
[3:18:20] God what we need is to go back to the
[3:18:24] real heartfelt
[3:18:29] experience to know who we've got
[3:18:35] faith our faith is in God as Jesus told
[3:18:40] us the truth
[3:18:44] is cannot stand
[3:18:48] where we
[3:18:50] are because the fa we have
[3:18:53] in put him of the
[3:18:58] platform
[3:19:00] cannot praise the Lord he
[3:19:04] says not some
[3:19:08] writings okay he says we've got to have
[3:19:13] we've what we need is
[3:19:17] get back to the real heartfelt
[3:19:20] experience to know who we've got faith
[3:19:25] in not some
[3:19:28] writings but the true and living
[3:19:33] God who lives
[3:19:36] now praise the Lord The God Who lives
[3:19:41] now is the one whom we are meant to have
[3:19:45] experience and faith
[3:19:49] if he has not worked for
[3:19:52] you which I
[3:19:54] doubt none of us has not felt
[3:20:00] experience but you know
[3:20:03] why we tend to take them as
[3:20:09] light let me give you an
[3:20:12] example being alive
[3:20:15] now don't think is a
[3:20:17] [Music]
[3:20:19] granted oh don't think it is it is it is
[3:20:24] the it
[3:20:31] is the Lord to be alive now and
[3:20:36] breathing it's not
[3:20:39] granted
[3:20:45] no it's it's a it's part of you you
[3:20:52] know that every have to
[3:20:56] breae the truth
[3:20:58] is what about when you are
[3:21:01] sleeping have you realize that you bre
[3:21:03] or
[3:21:03] [Music]
[3:21:05] not but sometimes we
[3:21:10] UNC
[3:21:12] inaming amever
[3:21:17] then even when you're
[3:21:18] America your dream is telling you that
[3:21:25] you
[3:21:26] living is the grace of God and it is the
[3:21:31] gift that God has
[3:21:34] given without him then you are not meant
[3:21:37] to
[3:21:40] be so people take it
[3:21:43] as thing
[3:21:48] but it's
[3:21:50] not okay talk about
[3:21:53] eating people say have aot of
[3:21:57] food you're right but there are many
[3:22:00] people in
[3:22:01] hospital have you
[3:22:10] have praise the
[3:22:12] Lord I want you to see that we live by
[3:22:15] God
[3:22:18] so each of us at least we have an
[3:22:24] experience with God that can en
[3:22:29] US have Fai in
[3:22:31] Him Praise the
[3:22:34] Lord talk about that
[3:22:37] woman when it was a scenario of of
[3:22:41] drought
[3:22:43] [Music]
[3:22:46] all food

[3:22:56] water but
[3:22:58] then
[3:23:01] have
[3:23:03] oil but other people
[3:23:06] outside they eating their
[3:23:09] children others eating
[3:23:14] D you you have food
[3:23:17] now that woman in that
[3:23:21] condition she can't
[3:23:26] boast because you
[3:23:28] remove you find
[3:23:31] one has
[3:23:33] Prov and leaves his fingers
[3:23:36] on then you say who this you make a
[3:23:39] certain shape you
[3:23:42] remove then God brings
[3:23:45] back that woman
[3:23:49] can't praise the Lord so we every one of
[3:23:53] us we have
[3:23:56] experience of how we can have faith in
[3:24:02] God praise the Lord walk
[3:24:05] outs I wish you people move at
[3:24:08] night you see that
[3:24:12] people sleeping on the in
[3:24:17] you I wish you have OPP to go to
[3:24:21] to they sleep on their like
[3:24:25] this but for
[3:24:27] you have a very comfortable
[3:24:31] bed
[3:24:37] think
[3:24:39] learn we have exper at
[3:24:44] least experience
[3:24:48] praise the
[3:24:49] Lord last time we were in
[3:24:51] hospital you know my baby was you know
[3:25:01] threaten then to us

[3:25:16] me to be at home then we are me to be at
[3:25:20] home because we are
[3:25:26] okay praise the Lord like four babies
[3:25:29] died before
[3:25:31] us but to us when
[3:25:37] is
[3:25:39] like
[3:25:42] people praise the
[3:25:44] Lord I wish people
[3:25:46] [Music]
[3:25:52] some of us we have
[3:25:56] F oh we can
[3:25:59] move we can go but people who want to
[3:26:04] move
[3:26:05] oned their legs are like
[3:26:11] this some of them they are straighten
[3:26:14] they put some weight
[3:26:17] the other
[3:26:20] side we are
[3:26:23] very we need to thank
[3:26:25] God that is just an
[3:26:28] experience to help you to have Fai in
[3:26:32] God praise the Lord I I know we have
[3:26:36] experience don't only think maybe we
[3:26:39] take
[3:26:42] them Journey
[3:26:47] you to be walking part of your
[3:26:50] journey that every day you meant to have
[3:26:53] it
[3:26:55] no praise the Lord but if God gives you
[3:26:59] you know
[3:27:01] sometimes the Old
[3:27:03] Testament was for our
[3:27:06] example praise the Lord it was for our
[3:27:09] example look at how
[3:27:12] suff for me to know that even in
[3:27:17] I can thank God and I can praise
[3:27:21] him but is that so with
[3:27:25] us praise the Lord so
[3:27:29] reason in
[3:27:35] thatal and then we
[3:27:37] [Music]
[3:27:40] are
[3:27:42] weing and
[3:27:44] yet likes us
[3:27:47] have experience with him then after the
[3:27:51] experience it draws Faith down and when
[3:27:56] faith comes
[3:27:57] down in that
[3:27:59] message St of a perfect
[3:28:02] man the prophet
[3:28:05] said
[3:28:07] faith is the
[3:28:11] foundation now if the foundation is such
[3:28:15] hard like
[3:28:18] then what
[3:28:20] aboutt praise the Lord because on
[3:28:26] faith but then what will you
[3:28:30] on faith is not
[3:28:33] there praise the Lord so he says
[3:28:37] faith is the
[3:28:39] foundation of all
[3:28:43] of Praise the Lord and then he says
[3:28:46] for without
[3:28:49] faith it's impossible to pleas
[3:28:55] God is this what the prophet says
[3:28:58] without
[3:28:59] faith it's
[3:29:05] impossible praise the Lord maybe
[3:29:11] another one thing I know is God
[3:29:16] but
[3:29:17] first it's going to be
[3:29:20] Faith let me stay on the foundation
[3:29:24] for Is What You Must
[3:29:28] Believe
[3:29:30] substance HED
[3:29:32] for
[3:29:33] it's it's you already have
[3:29:37] it when you have
[3:29:48] no that same point is what I wanted but
[3:29:50] I wanted to analyze it so that it is
[3:29:52] clear that same point where we were
[3:29:55] [Music]
[3:29:56] reading
[3:30:01] it's yes
[3:30:03] there he says faith is the substance of
[3:30:07] things hoped
[3:30:11] for it's you already have it when you
[3:30:16] have
[3:30:19] faith because it's revealed in
[3:30:24] faith faith is the substance of things
[3:30:27] HED
[3:30:29] for
[3:30:31] what kind of an
[3:30:34] Evidence
[3:30:36] Brothers
[3:30:38] evidence maybe
[3:30:43] another another one
[3:30:46] [Music]
[3:30:49] another
[3:30:51] [Music]
[3:31:05] one I want that one which says
[3:31:09] faith
[3:31:11] brings good down
[3:31:19] the prophet
[3:31:21] says
[3:31:23] fath go down go
[3:31:26] go yes there I want you to State there
[3:31:29] he says that's
[3:31:32] go when they make a phone
[3:31:35] call and
[3:31:38] say that that contact and your
[3:31:43] faith brings God
[3:31:46] it's the thing that brings the prayer
[3:31:49] which you have come to
[3:31:52] do
[3:31:55] and our
[3:31:57] prayer
[3:31:59] and what brings them
[3:32:02] here the faith without the
[3:32:06] faith these two they un
[3:32:13] effect
[3:32:14] come no
[3:32:17] where there is no faith because without
[3:32:20] faith you can't please God if you have
[3:32:23] not pleased God if when you bring him
[3:32:28] down he just judge you
[3:32:30] [Music]
[3:32:33] immedi because you have not pleased him
[3:32:36] if you bring him down when you have your
[3:32:40] faith your prayer and God together sin
[3:32:46] then he says prayer Faith changes from
[3:32:51] here to here it brings it
[3:32:56] together that's what the prophet
[3:32:58] says I want I want to
[3:33:01] finish praise the Lord I want to finish
[3:33:04] that's what the prophet
[3:33:06] says our
[3:33:09] faith brings
[3:33:11] him and the prayer together and when
[3:33:16] pray and
[3:33:19] together
[3:33:24] then the
[3:33:27] answer there it brings God from up
[3:33:34] down what you have prayed and comes back
[3:33:38] with it then there's an
[3:33:41] answer praise the Lord so what have you
[3:33:44] prayed for
[3:33:46] what have you come to pray
[3:33:49] for what brings God
[3:33:52] down faith in
[3:33:54] him if you've not brought God
[3:33:59] down don't judge me
[3:34:02] wrong
[3:34:07] prer other we've come for
[3:34:12] show after is the ground there
[3:34:16] you have come to show you know a
[3:34:20] show is I don't know they have always
[3:34:23] brought plantations which
[3:34:28] already to show you
[3:34:30] course no to show
[3:34:32] you you know actually to please
[3:34:37] you some sugar cane which is
[3:34:40] Big you think you can make it the way it
[3:34:43] is then you buy SE
[3:34:46] bring them to
[3:34:54] your when we come to show
[3:35:00] grounds is
[3:35:07] not doesn't come
[3:35:10] to praise the Lord he comes in
[3:35:14] reality he brings
[3:35:17] the
[3:35:18] banana when God breaks banana in
[3:35:25] this praise the
[3:35:28] Lord they bring a certain
[3:35:32] animal toce that this one can get big in
[3:35:36] three
[3:35:39] months when you take it it takes years
[3:35:43] without even
[3:35:45] wonder what was it but you forgot it was
[3:35:50] a
[3:35:51] show yeah you have come to show
[3:35:54] you me
[3:35:58] money the Lord that's why many of
[3:36:02] ministers use the power
[3:36:04] of
[3:36:07] for at the end of the day oh man of
[3:36:11] God oh man of God when the man of God
[3:36:15] say
[3:36:18] people are for the man
[3:36:23] of until people are sing you know I S
[3:36:26] WhatsApp people selling PL to go to heav
[3:36:30] right oh my God and are of
[3:36:39] they praise the Lord so even us when we
[3:36:44] come in prayer
[3:36:46] when we come for prayer
[3:36:48] meetings and we have not drawn God
[3:36:54] down there are two
[3:36:56] things if maybe God is waiting for
[3:36:59] something to
[3:37:01] answer I it
[3:37:04] a yeah praise the Lord oh my you really
[3:37:10] help me to stand am praise the Lord here
[3:37:15] as finish I
[3:37:17] said where there is
[3:37:21] unbelief I
[3:37:23] said God cannot do any great
[3:37:28] work praise the Lord there is
[3:37:32] UN cannot do
[3:37:36] any
[3:37:38] work because inth 13
[3:37:47] Matthew 13 if I'm not mistaken
[3:37:53] 58 Jesus never did any
[3:37:58] miracle in that
[3:38:00] point just because of their
[3:38:05] unise the Lord he did
[3:38:08] not did not many mighty works there
[3:38:12] because of their unbelief
[3:38:19] [Music]
[3:38:22] the Lord do
[3:38:24] anything
[3:38:27] un what Jesus told
[3:38:30] thews father died in the
[3:38:34] wilderness because of
[3:38:38] un praise the Lord so as I I want to
[3:38:42] finish
[3:38:46] brother
[3:39:01] says the prophet
[3:39:05] [Music]
[3:39:12] says when that servant had the
[3:39:17] experience and he saw Chariots of
[3:39:21] Fire he had an
[3:39:23] experience and when the experience of
[3:39:26] God
[3:39:27] came the prophet says there was no more
[3:39:35] doubt he
[3:39:39] fa praise the Lord he got faith there
[3:39:42] was no doubt in him
[3:39:45] and what
[3:39:46] happened he got faith praise the Lord
[3:39:50] and when he got
[3:39:53] faith
[3:39:58] there praise the Lord and another thing
[3:40:01] he says when you have an
[3:40:06] experience then it
[3:40:08] gives
[3:40:11] fath and Faith goes
[3:40:15] by your
[3:40:17] experience praise the Lord that's the
[3:40:19] prophet Faith goes by your
[3:40:25] experience praise the Lord so without an
[3:40:29] experience God can't
[3:40:33] work praise the Lord can't work so even
[3:40:36] he
[3:40:38] says first they come to God and have an
[3:40:43] experience for salvation
[3:40:46] before they approach God for their
[3:40:51] healing before you approach God for the
[3:40:54] healing you got to have
[3:40:58] experience with
[3:41:00] him or it will work wonders if you can
[3:41:06] only
[3:41:10] believe praise the Lord there are things
[3:41:13] which are impossible
[3:41:16] and to go he has displayed
[3:41:20] them one
[3:41:22] day there's a sister in the
[3:41:25] message I believe in the message
[3:41:30] expectation uh brother
[3:41:32] Bram was
[3:41:34] traveling in
[3:41:36] air praise the Lord and that old
[3:41:41] sister that yeah that old auntie
[3:41:46] I think I'm not
[3:41:50] mistaken praise the
[3:41:53] Lord prayed and when she
[3:41:57] prayed
[3:42:00] thee come
[3:42:03] down praise the Lord just
[3:42:07] imagine if we were outside

[3:42:12] moving first of all do you know that
[3:42:15] there's a man of God
[3:42:19] there praise the Lord but this woman is
[3:42:23] praying where
[3:42:28] is where is
[3:42:31] that but he was
[3:42:33] going and then when the plane met the
[3:42:39] [Music]
[3:42:42] prayer had to First reach the prayer
[3:42:47] and what was
[3:42:48] that told in
[3:42:50] a you stand here and she went stood on
[3:42:56] the
[3:42:57] there now imagine the time the plane
[3:43:01] came
[3:43:02] down she's
[3:43:04] waiting then the prophet is being told
[3:43:08] move then is
[3:43:11] moving is
[3:43:12] waiting God you told me I Stay
[3:43:16] there he comes the prophet is moving
[3:43:21] keep
[3:43:22] moving is telling the prophet go but
[3:43:26] where he going there somebody who has
[3:43:29] requested you
[3:43:32] there but the prophet didn't
[3:43:35] know even after that was a strange place
[3:43:38] for
[3:43:39] him then at the end of the day the devil
[3:43:42] came
[3:43:43] in brother
[3:43:45] brother you
[3:43:49] go
[3:43:51] youil it

[3:44:02] it that is
[3:44:03] [Music]
[3:44:05] all how I will come

[3:44:21] me
[3:44:23] prayed and God showed me he showed me
[3:44:27] you but you know what was
[3:44:30] surprising when I read that told the
[3:44:34] prophet where is the the handbag there's
[3:44:38] a bag which the prophet
[3:44:41] had that God showed her person have a
[3:44:45] bag and then the prophet left it in the
[3:44:49] car then when he moved he said where is
[3:44:53] that
[3:44:54] b the prophet said I left it in
[3:44:58] thee so that was exactly God answering
[3:45:02] her then when she had the experience
[3:45:05] with God she was able to
[3:45:09] recognize someone who had brought the
[3:45:12] answer of her
[3:45:16] praise the Lord praise the Lord at the
[3:45:19] end of the
[3:45:21] day
[3:45:25] works just imagine
[3:45:27] AE to come down just because of one
[3:45:35] woman then what
[3:45:38] ISO we have all of the
[3:45:41] experience some of them are written of
[3:45:45] them we are walking
[3:45:46] them we walking the
[3:45:49] experience no we
[3:45:52] walk and we speak
[3:45:54] experience we breathe experience we act
[3:45:58] experiences but
[3:46:00] yet faith in
[3:46:02] God is another
[3:46:06] struggle as the prophet said staggering
[3:46:09] thing to many
[3:46:11] people and yet it is the foundation
[3:46:19] found if it is
[3:46:22] so
[3:46:25] then and you
[3:46:27] stand then on top of
[3:46:30] that on
[3:46:33] it on top of
[3:46:36] thatl
[3:46:40] kindness it
[3:46:45] other than when all the virtues are on
[3:46:46] you and then you are wanting to fall
[3:46:48] because of many things like
[3:46:53] that reason Foundation maybe was not
[3:46:57] right so if faith is
[3:47:01] strong then what can stand against
[3:47:05] us so having faith in God what will
[3:47:09] bring only in our Liv
[3:47:15] praise the
[3:47:15] Lord praise the
[3:47:19] Lord praise the Lord so faith in
[3:47:25] God is the
[3:47:28] [Music]
[3:47:29] requirement
[3:47:31] promise that Christ gave us and he told
[3:47:35] us have
[3:47:38] faith that's why you have faith in
[3:47:43] God what can
[3:47:46] understand praise the Lord there are
[3:47:49] things which are
[3:47:51] impossible very many things which
[3:47:55] are amen very many
[3:48:00] things I don't I've always wanted to
[3:48:03] speak
[3:48:03] [Music]
[3:48:07] this people looking for
[3:48:11] wives it looks impossible
[3:48:17] is that right yeah it looks
[3:48:20] impossible when somebody tells
[3:48:23] you works either
[3:48:27] way he works
[3:48:29] here and works on the
[3:48:32] other there are many things that God did
[3:48:35] that
[3:48:38] way God told sister
[3:48:41] hope behold I send you El
[3:48:46] God told sister
[3:48:48] brother go and beat
[3:48:52] her so God
[3:48:55] works but without
[3:48:57] experience it is
[3:48:59] impossible you
[3:49:04] [Music]
[3:49:09] think maybe you are not
[3:49:13] prayerful it's possible
[3:49:15] works this side and without
[3:49:18] experience these are
[3:49:20] feos what we are talking
[3:49:26] [Music]
[3:49:30] are like they are not
[3:49:33] real if you don't have faith
[3:49:37] in but I want to assure
[3:49:40] you God is the witness
[3:49:44] Works
[3:49:46] twice and if you're very careful with
[3:49:50] God prove
[3:49:53] it he will prove
[3:49:56] it without
[3:50:06] experience
[3:50:09] imposs praise the Lord may God bless you
