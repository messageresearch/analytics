with the service you love amen a new Administration it was a great blessing God bless amen God bless you all again good to be here more time amen and it's a great great privilege now um some ministers to uh to ordain before okay just should we take this also on okay might be working yes that's fine okay as we ordain have some ministers uh surely uh um I don't know the ministers and actually brother brandom said our our ordination papers are in heaven but uh I just want to ask then surely the Elders of the church brother brothers to really to come and we pray together lay hands on them we we understand that uh the laying on of hands is not uh uh giving a gift but recognizing a amen but before we do that and every church and every local church has a I want read one scripture actually that's a scripture of Isaiah then we will ask maybe their brothers with their families with their wives come one by one amen Isaiah I want to read that [Music] scripture we know that we sing an normally as an ordination song actually how Isaiah was there and you know all the scripture Isaiah 6 verse1 Isaiah 6 ver8 you know when Isaiah had to come to a realization and then realization of uh that he is an that he is himself not able to do that that job because Isaiah had said behold I a man of unclean lips but then God was sending forth the angel came forth with a fire of coal and I I trust the ministers that we are ordaining they have had that experience that had that experience that that uh that fiery cold touches their lips amen and then it was it said in verse eight also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then say it I that is Isaiah here am I sent me amen and this is actually what we are doing today here some some brothers they have F the call on their hearts and and I believe they have had all the experience of really that they have understood they are unworthy they cannot do it themselves and I I trust those ministers all had that experience that the fiery call has touched them amen what does the FY call a Ty the Holy Ghost touching our lives and when the Holy Ghost has touched your life then you ready for service you're clean and you're ready for service I I want to go before we start I want to I want to focus for those ministers on what are we sent out for now we pray for we ordain them and God will say the Whom Shall I sense and those three brothers here this morning this afternoon they're answering Lord here am i s so we join our hands of Fellowship together we pray as a church we pray as ministers as the Elders of the church pray for them and then they are ordained to go out to continue I want to really focus before we do that that you that is ordained now always understands for what are you sent for what are you sent for and what is your main purpose not building yourself a kingdom now you're building yourself a little nice Kingdom but you are sent out now for a purpose I want to go to what Isaiah prior to that ordination prior to the angels putting a call on his lips what Isaiah experienced in his life amen and this is so important that we have that experience amen that we have that and this is Isaiah 6 verse1 you bring that up quickly before we go into the ordination praying for them and we have today brother Jeremiah muuga Church in B if I'm right then we have Brother Martin esala and then we have brother Wilson talena is that right you want to pray for them before that I want to read that please Isaiah 6 verse1 that happened that happened to Isaiah the one that was that said finally Lord sent me that that is that happened to Isaiah the one that finally said sent me so now this as this afternoon we have three ministers they finally come to ordination other words here we are we want to be sent out and I just want to go to an experience that Isaiah has if you bring up Isaiah 6 ver one I think this is prior to that the angel with the fiery cold touched his lips amen and it says here in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne and lifted up and his train filled the temple amen and then the whole story starts rolling amen amen and I trust those three brothers they have cut off from all arm of Flesh you see how that started it was in the year that King Uzziah died and Isaiah the young Minister was leaning on Uzziah but it was the year that the arm of Flesh died so Isaiah was focusing on Uzziah Isaiah was leaning on the arm of Flesh amen and it was in the same year that arm of Flesh died now Isaiah sees the vision of the Lord and it's so important as ordained ministers that we know we see the vision of the Lord because the vision of the Lord is what we are sent for not to bring our own Vision to bring to the people the vision of the Lord hallelujah you get it you get the picture so before you get ordained and and you understand even before the the fire of cold touched the [Music] prophets he saw the vision of the the Lord and even more and his train filled the temple brother rham said his train is Angels his train was his wig as we have seen in our day the vision of the Lord High and lifted up 27 miles high 30 miles across at that day at that day when the arm of Flesh cut off Isaiah said I saw the Lord high and lifted up I trust those ministers have seen in this hour the Lord high and lifted up and his train has filled the temple that is the vision of the Lord that when you go out ordained minister this is what you are sent for to bring to your church to bring to your church to bring to the people of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I think that is so important that we understand that amen and when we seen the vision of the Lord then we can say Lord here and I sent me because I know what I will do when I go out I know the vision of the Lord I know the Lord is high and lifted up can you say praise the Lord hallelujah I thought before we start the ordination I mean I thought it's so important to see because every church has an ordination Catholic Church they do ordain the the every every denomination of Min amen so we know what we are doing and you that is being ordained now you have to know what you are doing am so that you can say Lord here am I me hallelujah amen I thought I just felt to make that very plain amen and as we are ordaining them ordination is not giving a gift but is recognizing a gift amen and that's why I'm calling the brothers together do you do you sing the song before do you know do you you used to do that okay you know the song When The Fire of Co it touched the prophets this is actually the ordination song brother like to sing amen can can we do you know that together yes okay Baby G when the call of fire has touched the Propet making him as pure as can be the Lord can [Music] for hands and quickly Lord send send me speak my Lord may we all stand together I'll be Qui to [Applause] the oh speak my love speak and I the Lord [Music] me when the C of fire touch [Music] the making him as pure as pure can be oh the voice of God said us he speak my Lord let's all together my [Music] Lord we to oh speak my Lord speak speak my and with amen this brother what is the name of brother wison tellinga this Jeremiah this Jeremiah brother Jeremiah okay I think all the elders are here the ministers that knows you amen and I can say I'm just a visitor you know the brother brothers the brothers knows the calling and I believe that's why it's so important pray all together for him this is the way brother did it all the elders together all the ministers because this is the brother that you know amen so we want to pray together Amen to ordain him and his family hands on them if you want the heavenly father father as Isaiah was there in the temple I believe and I trust that our brother was in that same place he has understood that he cannot do it himself he is our brother with his wife and with his family understand if you call a man you call his wife with him father now we pray that you may bless him in his ministry may his ministry Prosper may he always go forth in the strength of the vision as Isaiah father may you strengthen his vision PR as he goes forth with his church with a group of people whatever his ministry is may just bless him and strengthen his vision father that this Vision never get diluted vision gets stronger and stronger vision of the Lord high and lift up and his train the Angelic beings the Bride of Jesus Christ that all filled the temple we pray father and now we ordain him laying off hands and your blessings upon and on his wife and on his family in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen am amen bless you God bless you amen God bless you amen okay it's the next God bless you brother bless you [Music] [Music] Martin this Brother Martin yes his wife okay yes okay let's pray together okay Heavenly Father father as we come to you oh God and by laying on our hands father if you would been here you would do that but now it's our hands representing what you would have done done it doesn't matter it's our our human hands father we only do that as a symbol that now may the Holy Spirit flow May the vision flow May that Ministry be anointed I pray father keep him and his wife keep him on the healthy way I pr everything that want to stop them may it be hindered I pray that they go forward in the vision of the Lord the vision of the Lord to help your people the power that we are living in I pray they never bring their own Vision they always be true to the vision of the Lord the Lord high and lifted up in this hour that we are living in the vision of the Lord I pray so we ordain this brother and this sister in your behalf and we pray that you will bless them in in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] amen bless [Music] that's brother V brother v a whole a whole [Music] team no problem that's fine we just pray we don't need out we just pray okay Heavenly Father let's pray let's pray heavenly father father we thank you again that this precious brother is here father it is coming to be ordained now if you would been here I want to say again as you have laid your hands on the little babies you would have laid hand on them of the ministries of the ministers to ordain them to bless them Father now it is our hands the hands of the ministry that shows that we we are all joining together the hands of Fellowship father just be prove now we just vindicate that the brother is one of us the brother and his wife is one of that great Revelation one of that great vision that is unfolding in this hour and father we pray strengthen him brother and his wife and his family amen May Satan have no right to touch them father I pray and may they be strong in the ministry May the brother be strong in his vision yes Lord so that that vision is declared to the people I pray father may you send them out may you be with them as they go into their work into their Ministry continue their Ministry father we commit them into your hands and we bless them we bless them in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ all to your honor and to your glory amen and amen amen hallelujah amen [Music] hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord I trust it's not only those ministers now amen that feel a call and feel a pull we are all called maybe not to be ministers and pastors but we we all are messenger Messengers in Christ and do we all have a vision amen do we understand what that vision is so many people go out and they go out without a vision so they go out and the Bible says without a vision Vision the people perish is that right without that Vision every church is perishing amen that's why the calling of the ministry it's like Isaiah was called into the ministry finally he could say Lord here am I sent me Hallelujah I trust that we can all say that I trust we all can say that that is that is the the power that thrives me amen you see maybe a man here that is preaching I was also a little boy I'm born in sin like you are but the product because I am what I am is because I saw the vision of the I saw what happened in our day I saw the Lord high and lifted up God cut all arms of Flesh away from me so that I could only lean on him amen and as I could only lean on in the vision of the Lord opened up I could see him 27 miles high 30 miles across the Lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple this is what happened in our day so when we are ordaining ministers we ordained them for that purpose to spread that vision of the Lord to give the people in their churches their own IDE Isaiah could not be sent out as as he was leaning on the hallelujah amen God bless you all amen what a wonderful thing amen what a wonderful thing I trust we all can say praise the Lord amen and this is actually so wonderful how that develops into the next service amen it develops into the next service amen I didn't know how that worked out here I I didn't know really what I was expecting but I can see the Lord is high and lifted [Applause] up and his train fills the temple hallelujah amen God bless you all so we straight want to go into the words amen for this this afternoon I have a thought in my heart a very simple thought but it fits perfectly what happened in our day what happened to these men what happened to Isaiah what happened to him Hallelujah what happens to you what happens to in your life not what will happen but what already happened is the grace of God can we confess that this afternoon I'm only in this message by Grace Hallelujah I am what I I am by the grace of God the Bible say by Grace you are saved through faith and that's not of your own so nobody can boast so what we are this afternoon ministers families never forget that you not higher than the [Applause] audience you're not higher than the audience amen the minister is not higher than the audience a Shepherd should smell like a sheep is that right he should understand the language of the Sheep am [Applause] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen yes sir so I think we hit the nail amen hallelujah so what we are we are by the grace of God okay this afternoon what you are already by the grace of God so let the ministers especially here in Africa to be a pastor is a position in Germany if you are a pastor you are nothing if I tell somebody in Germany maybe some some some some relatives saying I'm a pastor you know what they tell me we feel sorry for [Applause] you amen I know in Africa is still different and many things is because of culture background amen but the bride her culture [Music] is a Heavenly culture it's not an African culture it's not a European culture it's a Heavenly culture like I said yesterday brother and me we are brothers do you believe that we have to same father yet he is black and I'm [Applause] white but there is black dust and this is white dust that's all but we are brothers because we have the same father amen and we are brothers we have totally different cultures yes and still we are brothers our Unity is not because of our culture our Unity is because of Revelation that makes us one that makes us Brothers you're my brother you my sister amen hallelujah it's a wonderful and what we are we are by the grace of God let us quickly Stand Together We want to take one of two scriptures and uh I just thought to go a little bit in this [Music] direction just also to finish a little bit from this morning because it's very very important the deeper that we go into the word or the higher the Eagles are flying is to understand never to become proud never to be let never a proud Spirit come around around you the higher we fly the higher we can fly never never forget we are EG by God's grace Hallelujah can we say that together byce only by grace we stand here this evening Hallelujah let's go to Proverbs 16 verse4 and then we want to go to Timothy amen hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah bless it be his name Hallelujah proverbs 16:4 the Lord has made all things for himself yeah even the wicked for the day of evil the devil has made that the Lord has made all even the wicked for the day of evil it was God creating Satan uhuh amen what do you see here you see God is sovereign amen God is Sovereign do you believe God is Sovereign then his grace is Sovereign Hallelujah then you are saved by Sovereign Grace hallelu and that's why God loves you amen because brother Bram said when love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over Hallelujah and I want to speak this afternoon on Sovereign Grace what do we hear we see a sovereign God the Lord ha made all things for himself even the wicked for the day of evil but you are here this afternoon you are made for a different purpose what is that the grace of God can you say again the grace of God hallelujah never forget that never forget that it was grace that brought you so far it was not your works it not your Zeal it was God's grace God's grace brought you so far we can be confident that his grace will lead us home and let's turn quickly to Second Timothy I don't know if we have time for everything like when we start it's it's uh it's always the time is always our enemy see brother bam said spoke of the old man brother the old man that was brother bham spoke of him you know that put his heels together and that old man said you don't have enough space for me remember I'm telling the story for me the space is not the problem but I'm an old man also but for me is not the space the for me is the time the second Timothy second Timothy 1 we want to read second Timothy listen what Paul is telling to Timothy Hallelujah Paul is Paul at the end actually at a at the at the final of his ministry you know Paul had a start of his ministry a peak of his ministry and you know how his ministry ended Paul lost his head amen amen yes watch Paul now Timothy second uh Second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7-9 for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord not of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the Affliction of The Gospel According to the power of God Amen who has saved us and called us with the Holy according calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world [Applause] began I want you to focus Paul said to Timothy according to his own purpose that means absolute Sovereign he called us because of his own purpose and Grace so we can bind that together say he has called us by Sovereign Grace Hallelujah let's pray together heavenly father thank you for your grace and for your mercy father we ask you just would you come on the scene we pray take this we westle of clay father you know how I how I feel father there's something inside of me there's greater that is in me that is in the world we thank you and we give you the pre do what you want to do father shall be all to your honor and to your glory in Jesus Christ name amen amen God bless you may be seated and amen and I want to speak on The Sovereign Grace in the time of Jes like we have seen this morning amen there's great changes going on there a great administrational change going on Amen and great changes go on you cannot stop those changes they will happen anyhow but what gra it is when we are a part of the change amen what a Grace that is and as we have let me start to you maybe uh of the message U of the message uh message of Grace let me read to you how brother brandham would would um pronounce it what Sovereign Grace and listen very carefully because this can solve every problem in a church this can every fliction that is amongst the [Music] people and we know how quickly Satan can come like brother random would say this was the prophet and as he spoke to his own church he warned them he said we are we are a nice group of people now but Satan would try to destroy that brother Ram said either the government will come or the devil will come amongst us did Brother bam say that and we understand how quickly the we have seen the government that can come come Among Us amen The Government Can quickly can come and stop the service because of circumstances bring a separation amongst the people amen we have seen that but also the devil can come amongst us and the devil can cause afflictions amongst us amen the devil is specialist with that but but I think here is something so important that uh if we have that amongst us the devil has a very hard time to come amongst us he can try it but if we know some principles those principles don't allow him to come amongst us or even he can come amongst us and he's not effective brother random said we we can come to a certain place we can come to a certain condition to a position that Satan don't know what to do with us amen so each and everyone you can come to a condition you can come to a position that Satan don't know what to do with you and I tell you honest I want to be there I want the enemy to get [Applause] frustrated the enemy frustrated me so many times and now I want to frustrate him here's people amongst us they need medicine because of too much pressure is that right honestly I want the devil that he has to use his tablets because he has too much pressure hallelujah amen how can we get the devil under pressure he comes to you and he don't know what to do with you he's so frustrated I can do whatever I want I cannot get them I can I can try to hit them it looks like it doesn't hurt them I can step on their toe he's not screaming I can make I can make the sister be ugly to another sister but there's quick that forgiving Spirit you can drive Satan crazy now this is now not just some Pentecostal workouts you know I speak of realities the devil he didn't know what to do with Jesus he just didn't know what to do with him he could try what he wanted he could Pierce him he could knock him he could put a Thor of crown on his he could Market him and there he was he couldn't Market him he said come on Free Yourself what did Jesus say father forgive them amazing isn't it father forgive them they don't know what they are doing is it right church that frustrates the devil that frustration he can do whatever he wants you know why Jesus could do that because he understood I am what I am by the grace [Music] of Hallelujah and we are what we are by the grace of God allow me a few minutes I don't want to take much of your time Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace this is just brother Brenham now is from his Sovereign One Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants can do whatever it wants oh my my 2,000 years ago Sovereign Grace took over hallelujah amen Sovereign Grace there was a woman in adultery there was a woman in adultery right and Jesus stood there he was God's love [Music] projected so they asked Jesus what do you do with that woman you know the law the law of God for that woman it was impossible to Impossible it was impossible to get out of the situation is that right but here you can see what Sovereign means Sovereign can do what it wants Sovereign has has not to ask me Sovereign has not to ask you here comes a baby somebody somebody in the church and everybody might think their life is completely gone they have no chance we might think that but let love be projected and Sovereign Grace comes in Grace can make a way where there is no way are you witness of that it's good if you know that all of us were born in sin shaped in iniquity even if you are born in a message family you are born in sin is that right is that right and so also you must understand Sovereign Grace came into your life Sovereign can do whatever it wants Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that is Sovereign and God is Sovereign and that's wonderful so he can give Sovereign Grace amen therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody it don't has to ask it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful this afternoon isn't that wonderful Sovereign Grace can do tonight what it wants Hallelujah isn't that wonderful it don't has to ask can I do this or shall I do this can I must I will I doesn't do it it does it itself The Sovereign therefore he can save the violence the impur he can save the worst he can save the [Applause] immoralist canal the sick he can do what he wants Hallelujah Hallelujah are you aware that you are a product of Sovereign Grace Hallelujah we can end he the [Music] service we don't do but we can end he the service all things are possible POS if we can accept that amen hallelujah we are saved by Sovereign Grace I want you to see as especially as it was with Paul and even when we say we we see this morning we saw with David on his way to the throne watch David's story David's story so unusual but so typical so unusual and yet so [Music] typical you see now a prophet would come to the house of Jesse amen the prophet would come when the prophet comes to your house what is that the grace of God hallelujah that's why I said we can close the meeting right now we are what we are now by the grace of God hallelujah and finally Zechariah tells us The Headstone will come down under the shouting Grace Grace with us so it will be a work of Grace not what you do not what you can do not how perfect you are not how sinless you are not how blameless you are it is his grace amen hallelujah hallelujah we see amazing reactions in the Bible allow me to dramatize a few because you know actually what we are in is God's Great drama I tell you something God loves drama comedy he loves drama yes he loves drama he he don't like it easy he loves drama amen see that from the beginning it was God himself opening the door in Eden it was God opening the door in Eden as he took Adam and took him away from his wife now Satan could sneak in because God God left God left the door open God wouldn't left the door open Satan had no right to [Music] enter so God let the door open Adam was far away and now Satan was beguiling the the woman and normally Adam was a prophet but we understand God does not show everything to the [Music] prophet So Adam would not see what was going on because God didn't show him and then when the thing was done and Adam came back and Adam came back and Eve was deceived now we hear God coming in the cooling of the evening into the garden and now Adam and his wife is hiding themselves where are you if church I know where he is don't mind can you see drama can you see [Applause] drama God said Adam where are you and God knew exactly where Adam was hallelujah what why he was doing that because he needed the enemy he needed to do that so that God could express that he is a savior he is a [Music] redeemer you see the drama that God is bringing [Laughter] up as it's okay no problem you can put on it is off this one is off wait wait come back what I use okay good here we are okay I think it's in the drama is important you really understand but you understand isn't that amazing God comes to Adam and his wife Adam said we heard your voice in the garden and we were hiding ourselves because we were naked God said who told you that you are [Music] naked should God not know come on church he is not a stupid God running in the garden don't know what he's doing is the almighty [Applause] God playing out his drama laying out his drama God drama he likes drama he allow situations that are impossible so that he can show that he is a God for the impossible look what he's doing right now amen look what he's doing right now where where is the god of William Bram where is the god today people are sometimes so confused brother Bron was here we saw so many miracles Miracles today can you see God in his drama Hallelujah he takes the prophet out of the way to make sure that it becomes dramatic God loves church and be glad that by his grace you stand on the good side Jacob have I loved es have I hated s that means that's it what you are Tonight You Are by the grace of God hallelujah not what you want to be not maybe what you will be one day what you are right now you are by the grace of God hallelujah and if Rapture comes today the body change comes tonight I want to say I'm ready by the

fulfill that prophecy of Isaiah a man called Joseph loses his wife hey yes that's how it starts that great prophecy of Isaiah to be fulfilled Joseph's wives died amen uhhuh Joseph don't know why brother Bram said Joseph was a widow he was 45 years old and he had four children it's dramatic don't tell me it's not dramatic my own brother he has four children he just lost his wife that's drama

hiding himself like always God laughes hiding himself is that right come on Church Hallelujah you want to have an adventure holiday like when you go to Africa have an adventure holiday this message is more than an adventure [Music] holiday this message is a reality of experiencing God's give me a few minutes because we want to go to one example in the Bible in that drama as the drama will continue Church have you seen co co even hit message churches even message believer died on the is that right you know why God loves drama God loves drama Hallelujah I'm so happy that I know him Hallelujah is he present was he present even when Co strike was he present is he here even when Co stri was he here yesu why would he not act drama it's God's Great drama Church brother Bram brother met once a child with the Waterhead absolute drama brother Bram felt so bad he said Lord I don't understand why is that and the Lord said to him I just wanted to see what you do with Hallelujah can you understand church this Administration change is real is real when his son is is matured The Silence of the father is a Vindication you're with me if the son is matured The Silence of the father is an approval wow Hallelujah we in God's Great DH church God knows how to react God knows how to show how mature the church is yes when the baby is small the father has to react on every cry baby is crying mama and papa are running but when the child is mature son is crying Papa and Mama is not running anymore come on church God has his way to show how matured you are never forget the devil will be confused because it's God's drama [Applause] can you say praise the Lord hallelujah because the time was for the promise to be fulfilled and Joseph lost his wife God preparing the figure for his drama God preparing somebody to fit in his drama do we understand that sometimes we wonder Lord what is happening in my life why do I lose my wife why do I lose my husband right lost her husband what was God doing preparing her for his drama Hallelujah if she had an husband she would never have spoken because she would have said my husband can speak Hallelujah Watch God's drama unfolding if you brother Ram said the seven seal shows us who God is where he lives and shows us his nature hallelujah amen now we slowly understand what kind of God we serve and are you not glad that you are a part of it why are you a part of him because of his grace amen now Joseph had lost his wife and he was mourning and he was H for him suddenly one day she saw that sister in the church or in the temple at that time so he you know he said okay the Lord just directed him she was she was she was nice she was Jose felt maybe she can be a mother for my children good mother for my children Joseph never thought that she will be the womb of Jesus Christ born amen but that was a drama unfolding Hallelujah and remember as they drew a little closer and in heaven it was clear this is the hour where this prophecy is remember an elder came to John said don't cry John don't cry John was confused the Elder was not confused amen allow me to say In Heaven There are things easier clear than on Earth so Gabriel he is the announcing announcing Angel Gabriel understands this is the time now where this scripture of Isaiah is going to be fulfilled and he is a pronouncing Angel so he looks and he knows Mary is the girl and he's just on his way down to tell Mary you are the one God stopping him he said not now not now and Gabriel said why not God said to him it's not dramatic [Music] enough oh I trust you get the the picture I just like it I cannot help because I see what God is doing in my life that's why I'm so glad that I'm saved by the grace of God now as now Mary was not engaged yet to Joseph she was just friendly with him amen and so God said to the angel no wait wait wait wait for a couple of days now then there came a day when finally Joseph and Mary decided we are we will marry and they call it betral that is to be engaged before is that right so they decided okay we going to get engaged they announced that in the temple Mary and Joseph are engaged now God said to Gabriel now go go now do your work and Gabriel said why now why not last week no no no no now it's more dramatic amen amen amen you understand it why is God doing that to confuse the enemy why is God allowing things in your life why is he allowing things in your life why did he allow Satan to walk into the life of joob he said Satan you can do whatever you want but his life you don't [Applause] touch what was God doing unfolding his drama and Satan were wondering I thought in the beginning that yob were just following God God has blessed him but now I know he's not following him because God has blessing because I took away all of his blessings and he's still following God finally Satan gets so confused said he even took away his health even brought his wife against and God looked at Satan said it's very hard for you to understand my drama and Satan said yes I don't understand amen come on Church it is God unfolding his drama at the end of the story me he will make the works of his enemy to praise him what a drama as Jesus died at Calvary as they was hitting his back and the stripes came on his [Music] back because of that wounds we are healed [Applause] what a drama Hallelujah and millions of people could confess in his stripes I am healed can we say that tonight in his stripes I am healed what a drama remember how they was hitting him and he had pain and Satan said yes he would not know that in those stripes we would be [Music] [Applause] healed what a drama Hallelujah you know you know what Joseph and Mary it was so became so difficult because there was a law in Israel God gave that law God permitted that law amen there was two laws one law was for a virgin and another law was for an Engaged virgin amen so if a virgin is found pregnant is found pregnant then according to the law the man who pregnated her must marry her if he don't want to marry her he has to pay money to the father that's the law in Israel but when it comes to an Engaged virgin the law is different if an Engaged virgin is pregnant both of them the man and the woman has to brought before because now she is engaged amen amen and if she is not crying if she is not you reach your Bible if she's not crying why another man takes her she will put to death she be put to death come on church and Mary was not crying was the Holy Spirit pregnated her no you know what she said it be to me according to your word and she said that it means death to herself that's drama isn't it Satan never ever Satan never ever thought that the child would come from that way you know why God was hiding it in drama the drama was so good that Satan could not enter you can follow me the drama was so real that Satan spent not an idea to do what he had done in Eden Satan left Mary alone Satan left Joseph alone you know why because of drama Hallelujah so when drama is happening in your life don't get confused it is just God hiding you away Hallelujah we we are going deep to this evening but that's real life that will be maybe your future maybe your F your future will become dramatic maybe you go tomorrow to the doctor the doctor tells you you have cancer it can happen to me it can happen to you what do we do then stop crying no then start worshiping then tell him father you word said all things work together for good not all things are good but all things work together for good for them that love the Lord and if you love the Lord if love is projected Grace takes [Music] over Hallelujah let me come to the close because we can go with Paul we can go with David but it's Sovereign Grace it became dramatic in the life of a girl her name was Ruth a husband died amen right yes yes a husband died became dramatic and then one day is Naomi a type of the the word they walk together and Naomi said Ruth I must tell you I'm too old I don't have children anymore I cannot help you anymore I would counsel you go back go back go back where you come from your husband is dead I'm too old there's no husband can I tell you now go back you what Ruth said said no no no don't talk to me like this what did Naomi say Ruth go back you know how confused Satan might have been you know how confused Satan was what is she doing I'm not going any Naomi said again to and Ruth go back I counsel you there's no hope you cannot come with me my people you from Moab no CH in Israel because Israelites know they should not take a girl from Moab is that right is it right and she said oh yes M naomii you are so good your counseling is so true and she hucked her said God bless you I wish you everything good and you be back to your people I go back to my people oh Naomi they hacked one another they cry say goodbye you are so good to me but I have to go by bye Mama bye and here was Ruth telling Naomi you don't get rid of me you don't get rid of me you God is my God your people is my people Nai how can you say that Nai you remember the day when your son ask me for to become his wife you know Naomi that your son should never marry me because I am aomi said yes Ruth said Naomi that day I understood what God's grace is Ruth Saidi that day Sovereign Grace took a hold of my life it was impossible for somebody of your tribe to marry me to bring me into your lineage but Sovereign Grace one day took a hold of my life and Naomi you can do what you want I go with [Applause] you that's church people that we need

eyes s Grace of us is it not amazing how Ruth reacted amen God's God's drama and the devil was totally confused like I said I'm happy to be a tour so that God can confuse the enemy I'm happy I'm happy to just be the womb so that God can use to destroy the enemy are you not glad for that for that purpose he raised up the Son of God to destroy the works of the enemy for this purpose he has raised up other Sons to destroy the work of the enemy last scripture we don't read you yourself it's very amazing Genesis 38 write it down you read it at home Genesis 38 between 37 and 39 Genesis 37 is Jacob what is Jacob speak speaking of what is Jacob speaking of God's grace is it true Jacob represents the grace of God chapter 39 is Joseph Joseph speaks of perfection is that right actually Perfection is a son of Grace Hallelujah can we say praise the Lord church if we come to Perfection it's not because of our good works it's not what we have done we come to perfection because of the grace of God between 37 and 39 chapter 38 it doesn't it doesn't fit really it's just speaking of a woman woman is a type of the church if if we had time it could go into the lineage of Jesus Christ enjoy it church

Grace Genesis 38 you have heard of the woman tamama you can find her in Matthew 1 in the lineage of Jesus Christ God's drama Hallelujah always when I speak of that I feel such a sovereign presence of the Lord hallelujah because I know we have access to his being do you know that God has a sense of humor do you know God has a sense of humor that's why Jesus could say tell Herod the fox what God do we serve what God do we serve can you see the almighty God enjoy a little bit with me before we close the drama here one day it was Moses Moses and God Moses came to God or God came to Moses and say Moses do you see your people the ones that you have brought out they've gone wrong you know Moses I'm tired with them separate yourself from them I start with you in I'm fed up right you go you read
