[1:00] talking my head 900 years
[1:04] to witness the best
[1:06] and he says unto us the son is born
[1:10] but if you are not in the dimension of
[1:13] the problem
[1:14] you'll think that the man is a little
[1:17] bit because
[1:19] [Music]
[1:26] he's talking about the same son
[1:30] he says for he shall grow up now he's
[1:34] talking about him in the future
[1:36] before he must attend a plan
[1:40] and that's the root out of the dry
[1:42] ground
[1:44] then he goes into the past presence
[1:49] he says he has no forms
[1:52] amen like he's right there
[1:58] and then he goes in
[2:06] welcome back
[2:09] foreign
[2:44] [Music]
[2:45] um
[2:45] so you really need to understand what I
[2:49] got together how the Holy Spirit uses
[2:51] prophets
[2:54] so we step into the subject
[2:57] of the blood on the outer equality by a
[3:01] principle that Revelation 5. is the
[3:05] bridge
[3:08] foreign
[3:18] amen Amina so listen to what brother
[3:21] Branham says here
[3:23] now now
[3:25] we are going to turn to the fifth
[3:28] chapter
[3:29] now this is not Seven Seals
[3:33] is not a physical place it's first
[3:36] whenever that is
[3:38] [Music]
[3:42] a spiritual maturity
[3:47] and in that maturity there are certain
[3:51] benefits the children of God
[3:55] so now it's like in the world
[3:59] there is what we call evacuation
[4:03] amen they deliver you from where there
[4:08] is a lot of trouble
[4:11] you know all kinds of things going on
[4:16] and then they
[4:25] [Music]
[4:38] from all those
[4:48] out of organizations
[5:14] [Music]
[5:25] [Music]
[5:26] who has the power to save
[5:35] praise the Lord
[5:36] foreign
[5:44] [Music]
[6:01] are you together with the man is it and
[6:03] we see the advocate so the judge
[6:07] listens to the prostitute
[6:10] and the prostitute in this case
[6:15] he knows how many peer bottles you've
[6:18] drunk
[6:20] he knows how many nightclubs you have
[6:23] gone
[6:24] he knows how much witchcraft you have
[6:27] exercised
[6:29] so he stands and says
[6:31] [Music]
[6:33] this one here is
[6:39] [Music]
[6:44] what to come to hell with me
[6:50] foreign
[7:04] [Music]
[7:20] [Music]
[7:36] are you together with me what is it and
[7:38] one of the others
[7:45] now in Israel the tribe of Judah was the
[7:49] king
[7:51] and the King was the judge
[7:54] so now the Elder here he says
[8:01] [Music]
[8:16] foreign
[8:29] [Music]
[8:40] [Music]
[9:12] foreign
[9:15] [Music]
[9:32] [Music]
[9:57] [Music]
[10:16] we do are you together with Ryan is
[10:19] there so he buys you as a slave
[10:23] and maintains you as a slave
[10:26] if you are going to be redeemed
[10:29] it only required somebody who was the
[10:33] king's man Church
[10:35] somebody is related to you is
[10:47] and if we try to redeem the land also
[10:51] it had to be the Kinsman yeah
[10:55] to redeem you because in Israel the land
[11:00] was not given to individuals
[11:04] [Music]
[11:07] who received an individual property
[11:12] and that was
[11:14] calebu the rest of them the land
[11:18] belonged to the tribe yes
[11:21] [Music]
[11:29] [Music]
[11:40] and that was not accepted in the law
[11:43] Iran
[11:44] that's why it's required to be a kingdom
[11:47] foreign
[11:49] [Music]
[12:02] are you together with me that's why
[12:05] Jesus became a man
[12:07] he had to become a king's man I know to
[12:12] fit in the love Redemption
[12:14] it required
[12:22] you must be born of the human race
[12:40] [Music]
[12:48] and produce the production
[12:51] that's why when John turned to see
[12:54] he says
[13:00] in the midst of the throne Hallelujah
[13:24] [Music]
[13:30] to come and do the judgments
[13:37] but when he turned to see
[13:40] the Bible says
[13:48] how did he see that love yeah foreign
[14:21] those are symbols
[14:25] because after his Redemption
[14:29] after redeeming then he became the
[14:33] spirit
[14:34] in the midst of the church
[14:39] are you together with me he became the
[14:42] authority in the church
[14:44] he became the Revelation
[14:47] he became the power in the church
[14:50] so now seven
[15:00] [Music]
[15:03] has been moving through the seventh
[15:06] Church
[15:07] [Music]
[15:10] are you together with me when he came
[15:13] down into church
[15:15] his presence was the power guardian of
[15:20] the church
[15:22] are you together so now that's where the
[15:27] symbol of the horns come from Jesus
[15:37] and then it says seven eyes
[15:40] now speaks about the seven Messengers
[15:46] [Music]
[15:52] [Music]
[15:56] he has been prevailing
[15:59] he has been fighting
[16:04] America to help the church
[16:09] praise God position
[16:23] [Music]
[16:30] [Music]
[16:36] [Music]
[17:18] [Music]
[17:52] told him to send the message
[18:04] [Music]
[18:09] [Music]
[18:23] he was dealing with them
[18:26] in a different particular way
[18:30] the anointing was different
[18:33] so now that one is considered to be one
[18:36] Spirit
[18:39] then the Same Spirit comes
[18:42] moving with the chance
[18:45] and the church has changed the
[18:48] dimensions
[18:49] in form of corrects
[18:52] [Music]
[18:55] foreign
[19:14] [Music]
[19:23] [Music]
[20:06] [Music]
[20:29] the devil has nothing to hold you
[20:31] foreign
[20:34] [Music]
[20:39] amen
[20:40] [Music]
[20:43] [Applause]
[21:06] [Music]
[21:31] [Music]
[21:35] [Laughter]
[21:45] [Music]
[21:51] presenting himself
[22:02] [Music]
[22:05] it becomes you know when you do that
[22:09] then the outer Timber is smoking
[22:20] the moment you remove
[22:23] foreign
[22:33] [Music]
[23:03] foreign
[23:07] [Music]
[23:23] [Music]
[23:28] amen Amina so where brother Branham
[23:32] speaks about the blood
[23:35] being of of the Sun Challenge
[23:39] cannot be the bridge
[23:42] but it's just the Holy Ghost Crossing
[23:46] Borders
[23:48] the Holy Ghost speaking in the future
[23:51] reference
[23:53] like Isaiah in one sentence
[24:05] foreign
[24:14] [Music]
[24:34] foreign
[24:43] [Music]
[24:46] amen Amina
[24:49] remember look it up he had been on the
[24:52] Mediterranean work back here
[24:56] but remember these seals are ready to be
[25:00] open they said no this was
[25:13] foreign
[25:16] [Music]
[25:21] [Applause]
[25:34] [Music]
[25:51] [Music]
[26:05] amen Amina
[26:08] one half hour that it is silent
[26:24] that's Revelation
[26:26] the sanctuary
[26:30] there's no intercession
[26:33] the script I mean the sacrifice has left
[26:36] is Judgment
[26:42] for the blood covered lamb has walked
[26:45] away
[26:48] then he says don't you wait till that
[26:52] time
[26:55] remember in the Old Testament
[26:58] as long as the blood was of the mercy
[27:03] it was judgment
[27:06] but as long as the blood was on there
[27:10] there was Mercy
[27:13] but when the lamb walked away
[27:20] there is power in the yeah
[27:57] when it comes to the success
[28:05] and call for rocks to follow them
[28:09] and the scripture says yes we run away
[28:13] from them
[28:14] at that time the scripture says
[28:21] in the streets because it can't reduce
[28:31] [Music]
[28:32] but we thank God
[28:36] we are under the blood
[28:39] you need to get under that soul
[28:45] of the blood of Jesus Christ
[28:56] because it is
[29:01] don't judge yourself
[29:03] praise God
[29:06] now we must know that this service
[29:10] is the bridge he's doing the bridge
[29:14] but it crosses out the borders
[29:19] into the trumpets
[29:22] which is the time when God is dealing
[29:25] with
[29:27] Israeli in the time of the triplets
[29:31] amen amen listen here listen I'm giving
[29:34] you a quote
[29:35] amen Amina but now everything when it
[29:39] comes to dealing then with Israel
[29:43] let me explain this a little bit the
[29:47] principle of God is that God doesn't
[29:50] deal with Israel
[29:52] and then the Gentiles
[29:55] at the same time
[29:57] accepting special
[30:00] foreign
[30:06] [Music]
[30:20] [Music]
[30:34] [Music]
[31:01] in Acts chapter 13. after they had tried
[31:06] to go back to recognize but this Christ
[31:10] was the message
[31:11] and they rejected in Acts chapter five
[31:17] seeing that you have rejected
[31:21] now we turn to the Gentiles
[31:25] that's why we see the Gentiles have
[31:29] Christ by another question the Jews
[31:31] don't understand Christ too
[31:35] but then it's Professor
[31:38] that when God is finishing with the
[31:41] Gentiles
[31:44] he has to go back and get the juicy I
[31:48] know
[31:49] and that is going to be a work
[31:53] of three and a half yeah
[31:56] are you together
[31:58] [Music]
[31:59] now when we are done
[32:03] he goes back to the Jews
[32:07] then you can understand this but when it
[32:11] comes to dealing with Israel
[32:14] in this last part of the 70th week
[32:19] he deals with them as a nation
[32:22] when the Gentiles are finished
[32:26] the hour is sooner Rising is
[32:31] very nice
[32:34] that God
[32:36] turn from the Gentiles all together
[32:42] [Music]
[32:48] come when there's two times
[32:51] put your sin to the old castle
[32:55] as long as the blood is there
[32:59] don't you wait for Asus time
[33:09] and the father did nothing to do
[33:12] the time of is
[33:17] so he says they shall trap Down the
[33:21] Walls of Jerusalem right now
[33:24] the Gentiles until the Gentile
[33:27] disposition be finished
[33:31] let him that's fill this stuff
[33:39] that is the time we are going against
[33:43] when the gospel will mean nothing
[34:09] that's why you are here
[34:20] [Music]
[34:30] [Music]
[34:39] [Music]
[34:53] [Music]
[34:55] to the Jews
[35:01] [Music]
[35:14] [Music]
[35:34] [Music]
[35:56] as it was in foreign
[36:05] [Music]
[36:14] we are coming at the End of Time
[36:17] the blood is still on the altar um
[36:30] ask for forgiveness
[36:34] the blood still works
[36:36] don't you run on guns
[36:40] me I think I'm finished
[36:44] the blood is
[36:48] [Music]
[36:50] says that sacrifice has been removed
[36:55] There's Nothing But Smoke
[37:01] and that's exactly what's poured out
[37:04] tonight
[37:08] is
[37:15] being finished
[37:17] from over on the floor
[37:20] and the sacrifice as we've typed him
[37:24] perfectly the Kinsman redeemers
[37:29] that come from foreign
[37:49] [Music]
[38:10] [Music]
[38:27] [Music]
[38:30] oh that did it
[38:35] see he was a prophet he would stand and
[38:39] watch
[38:42] amen Amina so he has been an interesting
[38:47] no other person is
[38:53] amen amen tell me where Mary could make
[38:56] intercessions then
[38:59] what could Mary offer
[39:02] because it was necessary
[39:06] to give life
[39:10] for the Redemption
[39:13] of man
[39:15] and see sin cause death
[39:20] if Mary gave herself
[39:26] she couldn't come back
[39:29] to bring us to life
[39:32] she would also be a victim
[39:36] of the effects
[39:39] [Music]
[39:42] aguana
[39:49] but
[39:50] he is the intercessor
[39:53] what could Saint Francis
[39:57] how could Saint Francis of asses or any
[40:01] other
[40:02] Saints and Francis
[40:10] John never saw thousands of saints come
[40:14] out
[40:16] from the mediteria is
[40:19] [Music]
[40:32] that was at the end now
[40:35] when John was already out of the
[40:38] denominational age
[40:44] amen because they had rejected Christ
[40:48] and the journey was told in Revelation
[40:52] chapter 4
[40:54] verse
[41:00] and you see things
[41:02] [Music]
[41:08] [Music]
[41:11] that are benefiting us is that the end
[41:16] of the year

[45:09] sickness
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] Bloods that fly
[45:23] he got the Revelation yes
[45:29] and if you get the revelation of the

[48:16] for another man
[48:18] foreign
[48:43] [Music]
[48:58] [Music]
[49:10] because the real atonement
[49:14] was behind the life
[49:16] so the life of the Bulls

[49:22] could not match the king's manship
[49:28] Hallelujah so what that blood is

[53:24] amen
[53:26] I think we are sorted out now
[53:31] you see

[53:49] godsamboo
[53:51] in 10 minutes

[1:27:52] it's the power of the blood
[1:27:55] look at the prophet speaking about that
[1:27:57] blood

[1:31:43] the blood on the order
[1:31:46] God represents his church as a pride
