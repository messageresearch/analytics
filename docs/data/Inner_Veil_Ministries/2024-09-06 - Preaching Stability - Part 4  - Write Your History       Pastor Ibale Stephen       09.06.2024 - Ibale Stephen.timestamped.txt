[32:18] amen so uh
[32:21] today uh let's go to Hebrews 11 verse 8
[32:28] we shall read that
[32:30] scripture and then we shall
[32:33] sit and still continue reading
[32:37] scripture amen so
[32:40] [Music]
[32:41] 118 by faith
[32:45] Abraham when he was called to go out
[32:48] into
[32:52] place which you should after receive for
[32:56] an inheritance
[33:01] he had to go into the
[33:03] place for him to possess it
[33:06] later for an
[33:08] inheritance so Footprints his
[33:13] possession which he should after receive
[33:17] for an
[33:19] inheritance
[33:21] obeyed and he went out not knowing where
[33:25] he was going
[33:27] that is
[33:28] Faith may God bless the reading of his
[33:32] word you may be
[33:35] seated you know there are many men that
[33:38] are mentioned in Hebrews
[33:42] 11 and they are refer to as a cloud of
[33:46] witness but the one who occupies the
[33:49] greater part among
[33:53] them is Abraham his way of Faith had
[33:57] different Dimension
[34:00] Street amen verse 9 says by faith he
[34:04] Sant in the land of
[34:06] promise verse 9 as in a strange
[34:16] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[34:20] Isaac and Jacob the hairs with him of
[34:24] the same promise
[34:30] for he had looked for a city which had
[34:34] foundations build and make his
[34:42] God Abraham had a long
[34:45] Vision he had a vision of a
[34:48] city he says no I've been around a
[34:51] little
[34:52] while but I cannot really believe this
[34:55] is the city that God promises
[35:00] he was looking much ahead of
[35:04] himself and when God called him to go
[35:07] into
[35:09] country into a city in there he looked
[35:13] for that
[35:15] City amen you get into the land look for
[35:19] a city and he kept looking for a city so
[35:24] this morning I believe we are in the
[35:27] land of the ho
[35:28] ghost that was promised but in it we
[35:33] look for a
[35:34] city whose build and maker is God
[35:37] himself and one of these days eternity
[35:41] is going to reveal that
[35:43] City amen verse 11 he says through faith
[35:49] also
[35:50] sah received strength conceive SE
[35:59] and was delivered of a child when she
[36:02] was past
[36:05] age because he judged him faithful who
[36:08] had
[36:14] promised praise the Lord so how many
[36:18] would feel this
[36:21] morning that my womb is
[36:25] there I'm not really being able to bring
[36:28] the fruit of the
[36:31] spirit you see by faith God himself give
[36:36] Sarah
[36:37] strength hallelujah hallelujah if you
[36:40] feel dead
[36:43] spiritually we serve a God who gave sah
[36:47] strength
[36:49] to amen the moment she stepped into his
[36:53] you step into his
[36:55] presence just pull on him
[36:59] and he will drop strength to conceive
[37:03] seed that Christ may be born in your
[37:09] womb that you may display the character
[37:12] of
[37:13] Christ that you would come forth with
[37:16] all the fruit of the
[37:19] spirit are you together with me so verse
[37:22] 12 here therefore sprang there even one
[37:27] and him as good as
[37:34] dead so many as the stars of the sky in
[37:39] multitude and as the sun which is by the
[37:43] seashore
[37:47] innumerable verse 12 and then 13
[38:03] praise the
[38:05] Lord so this is now Hebrews
[38:12] 11:12 amen
[38:35] was the picture of
[38:37] death and the resurrection of
[38:40] Christ and he says all
[38:43] Israel was born of him that was as
[38:47] though he was
[38:49] dead amen you remember when he was taken
[38:53] up the mount for you know the sacrifice
[38:58] now verse
[38:59] 13 is very
[39:01] interesting these people here they kill
[39:05] fired as people the Seed of
[39:09] Abraham who knew that while they in the
[39:13] Land There is something better than the
[39:15] land hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[39:19] Lord there was something ahead there
[39:22] that they were looking for and all of us
[39:26] much as we we are in the Redemption
[39:30] now but we are looking for something
[39:33] greater than what we have
[39:36] now amen the coming forth of the
[39:40] city the stepping forth the change of
[39:42] our
[39:44] bodies amen now all these people here
[39:49] not as they died before they saw the
[39:52] city they died with a face there will be
[39:56] a city one of these
[39:59] days amen he says in verse
[40:03] 13 died in
[40:06] faith not having received the
[40:10] promises but having seen them
[40:14] A Hallelujah and were persuaded of
[40:20] them and embrace
[40:23] them and confess that they were
[40:26] strangers and pilgrim on
[40:30] the for they that say such
[40:34] things deare
[40:37] plainly that they seek for a
[40:40] country and truly if they had been
[40:44] mindful of that
[40:47] country where they came out of they
[40:51] might have had an opportunity to
[40:54] return God have mercy if we are
[40:58] mindful of where we came from it is
[41:03] dangerous you might go
[41:06] back if you have
[41:09] trials bet tried in the
[41:12] faith and be found an
[41:15] overcomer don't desire to look
[41:20] back
[41:21] amen so you are all welcome back from
[41:25] the funeral
[41:28] and uh I appreciate your show of
[41:34] love to one of our
[41:36] own so
[41:38] today I'm going to speak on the
[41:41] subject of course I'm continuing with
[41:44] preaching
[41:47] stability but the subject
[41:49] today is write your
[41:55] history amen
[41:58] don't allow a man write your
[42:01] history but write your
[42:05] history so the scriptures in Hebrews
[42:10] 11 tell the stories of
[42:14] faith and one interesting
[42:17] observation is that the same
[42:20] Faith took these men through different
[42:23] routes of
[42:25] life amen
[42:27] One Faith but different routes of the
[42:31] same
[42:33] faith our path can never be the
[42:38] same some through the water some through
[42:41] the floods some through the fire but all
[42:46] through the blood that's the common
[42:48] denominator is the
[42:51] blood amen some through great
[42:55] Sorrows but God gives us a
[42:58] s amen oh I tell you the same
[43:03] Fai but different
[43:06] routes amen and we thank God for that
[43:11] same Faith praise God Amen so
[43:17] faith I mean does Not Duplicate our
[43:23] paths amen and therefore God not let
[43:28] another
[43:29] man write your
[43:31] history the faith is one but the routes
[43:35] are different so I can never write your
[43:41] history our trials are
[43:44] unique and so should be our victories
[43:48] also and therefore God knows that you
[43:52] are the best
[43:53] writer of your own story
[43:57] because no man can never walk your
[44:00] path amen the story of your life can
[44:05] only be performed by
[44:07] you because everyone will have a
[44:10] personal
[44:12] challenges and personal
[44:15] experiences and therefore personal
[44:18] victories is that amen somewhere we will
[44:22] have a personal
[44:25] history and
[44:27] history should easily be
[44:32] understood as his
[44:37] story are you together with me so this
[44:40] is what we are going to call history
[44:43] today his
[44:46] story and it is his story no man can
[44:49] write
[44:51] it Abram could not write the story of
[44:55] Moses neither could Moses write the
[44:58] story of
[44:59] [Applause]
[45:00] Noah you cannot write my
[45:04] story if you are brought in my
[45:07] shoes you cannot walk in my
[45:09] shoes just like I cannot walk in your
[45:13] shoes every one of us has got a battle
[45:16] to fight has got a
[45:19] restaurant that's the stability of the
[45:23] church whenever one of us know that his
[45:27] commission to be an
[45:30] overcomer so all these men here in
[45:33] Hebrews 11 had individual
[45:37] Journeys through the
[45:39] prage of the same Faith so the Journey
[45:43] of Abel
[45:45] now was about the authority of
[45:47] Revelation in
[45:51] worship amen a walk under sacrificial
[45:55] submission
[45:58] Noah's story was obedience to Divine
[46:05] instruction in the end time but Abram's
[46:09] story was one of looking for a
[46:12] city whose build and Mak was God
[46:17] himself of course abrah had more in the
[46:20] story of
[46:22] Faith than all the men that are
[46:24] mentioned in Hebrews 11
[46:29] his story contains the
[46:32] revelation of the death and resurrection
[46:35] of
[46:37] Christ when he was giving forth his son
[46:41] Isaac as he moved to killing him when
[46:44] god holds his hand and then brings forth
[46:48] the
[46:48] lamb amen that lamb bear was the one who
[46:53] was
[46:54] worthy to die for your sin and
[46:59] amen praise the Lord and you know it's
[47:03] very
[47:04] interesting you see uh in this man's
[47:11] history Isaac and
[47:14] Jacob used the natural Blessing of
[47:19] Abraham upon their
[47:22] seeds because they inherited a blessing
[47:28] amen he says and I'll give unto
[47:32] thee unto thy seed after
[47:36] thee the land wherein thou art a
[47:41] stranger it was given to
[47:44] Abraham and the blessing person
[47:48] over to ISAC Jacob and then the
[47:53] Patriarchs amen hallelujah hallelujah
[47:57] it's very
[47:58] interesting we shall understand this as
[48:01] we go
[48:02] by and then we have this man Joseph here
[48:07] he had the revelation of the
[48:10] spot of the spot of the Holy
[48:13] Mountain and by Desiring his bones to be
[48:16] taken
[48:19] back into the land of promise he was
[48:22] telling
[48:24] Israel that at the end of this all
[48:27] there will be a Mount Zion show
[48:34] down
[48:35] yeah we've had
[48:38] three amen
[48:40] showdowns Mount
[48:42] camel Mount
[48:44] Calvary but the last one will be Mount
[48:50] Zion Oh
[48:51] Hallelujah there will be a
[48:54] rupture amen that was the revelation of
[48:58] Jacob and he says don't leave my bones
[49:01] out
[49:02] there because I know there was a reason
[49:04] going to be a
[49:06] resurrection you know sometimes when God
[49:09] reveals
[49:11] something it makes you act in a strange
[49:15] way amen it grips your heart it grips
[49:20] your mind it grips your
[49:23] actions amen so when Joseph got the reel
[49:28] of the body change he says what if that
[49:33] Revelation amen doesn't reach me simply
[49:38] because my bones are in
[49:40] Egypt ah when we are going back C my
[49:45] bones in this shall I see
[49:48] God amen amen
[49:51] amen praise the Lord the story of
[49:55] Moses was the story of an Exodus Exodus
[50:00] Prophet who by the same Faith also
[50:04] encountered another Prophet along the
[50:06] pilgrim
[50:08] J amen he met a competing
[50:14] anointing along the
[50:17] way amen just before the
[50:21] entering there came up another anointing
[50:26] who was equally a
[50:29] prophet amen but then he lost his
[50:34] anointing by the lack of understanding
[50:37] of what God was
[50:39] doing let me tell you friends we lose
[50:44] direction when we take this great
[50:47] anointing and use it to throw stones
[50:50] against one
[50:55] another ba
[50:57] was
[51:00] recruited to throw
[51:02] stones against the ministry of
[51:05] Moses you lose the anointing when you
[51:09] misuse the
[51:10] anointing that's why I say God will not
[51:14] allow one
[51:17] man to write your story you will always
[51:21] understand it
[51:24] better you'll understand
[51:27] what really convicted you and brought
[51:30] you to the Altar and that will go with
[51:34] you until you see your body
[51:37] change so we are all in this
[51:41] journey by a Divine personal
[51:43] relationship to the
[51:47] father and see sunship is a
[51:51] G amen that came from God this gen here
[51:57] will always be like the
[52:00] father but then since the
[52:03] body is many members together and all
[52:07] these bodies they operate
[52:10] differently every part of the body write
[52:13] his own
[52:15] story hallelujah hallelujah the eyes
[52:19] cannot write the story of the
[52:22] foot amen it was ordained to see And yet
[52:27] when they see what they see benefits the
[52:31] f are you together with me yeah we just
[52:35] want to understand this tonight I mean
[52:37] this
[52:38] morning amen so we are all in this
[52:42] journey simply because you has a
[52:45] relationship with the
[52:47] father I have a relationship with the
[52:50] father I a Jee and you are a part of the
[52:53] genes of God but a Je
[52:57] came down here on Earth to perform his
[53:01] commission
[53:03] differently and yet all of us together
[53:06] we make one
[53:08] body amen let's go to Second Corinthians
[53:12] chapter two I mean chapter
[53:16] 4 and verse six he says for God who has
[53:21] commanded the light to shine out of
[53:25] Darkness shined in our
[53:28] hearts why to give the light of the
[53:31] knowledge of the glory of
[53:35] God in the face of Jesus
[53:37] Christ so now let me say this it takes
[53:43] Darkness for light to be
[53:46] relevant are you together with me and I
[53:49] know that no
[53:50] one but all of us are still struggling
[53:56] with some dark Sports of
[54:01] life that's why you are
[54:03] here because they are SP that must be
[54:08] clean because the promise is that the
[54:12] bride will be without spot or
[54:15] wrinkle so as long as we are still blood
[54:19] and
[54:20] flesh Lord let your light shine upon my
[54:23] life
[54:26] and I told you the other time that the
[54:30] light is our
[54:32] washing because when the light lights
[54:36] you begin to see the sports that require
[54:40] attention and this morning as God shines
[54:44] the
[54:46] light I trust that by the grace of God
[54:49] we shall start washing our
[54:52] dos amen it takes Darkness for light to
[54:57] be
[54:58] relevant and I know that one of you know
[55:02] uh it is you know this
[55:05] spot that God wants to shine
[55:09] upon amen light can only shine in
[55:19] darkness is this P that God would want
[55:23] to shine his light into
[55:28] to give us the
[55:30] knowledge of the
[55:32] glory of what is
[55:34] hidden in this
[55:37] vsel amen so let there be
[55:42] light God say but today we shall say God
[55:48] is saying let them be light and let us
[55:52] step into
[55:53] it amen there is a man here who can turn
[55:58] on the light and when he turns on the
[56:00] light step into the light he wants to
[56:04] give you the
[56:05] knowledge of the light of the glory of
[56:09] God and God's
[56:11] knowledge is not
[56:13] theological it's a Divine
[56:18] experience meaning that he once you to
[56:20] experience the light of his glory
[56:26] he wants you to be engulfed in that sh
[56:31] Glory it is a Shining
[56:34] Light it's a lifegiving
[56:38] light it's the light of our
[56:42] path amen once you step into it oh
[56:47] Hallelujah hallu once you step into that
[56:50] light I want tell you my
[56:53] brother it will give the light of the
[56:56] knowledge of the glory of
[57:00] God Amen verse S
[57:04] says but he says but where are your
[57:09] Treasures amen God is our treasure and
[57:14] he is in
[57:16] this is the light on the
[57:19] inside and he wants to light his
[57:23] glory and light our path but we have
[57:27] this
[57:28] treasure in a vessels that the
[57:32] Excellence of the
[57:33] power may be of God and not of
[57:38] us so we have the TR of the
[57:43] glory of that
[57:45] light in our
[57:48] vessels that glory is hidden behind
[57:52] these curtains of time
[57:56] but yet it is also
[57:59] expressed as a lived
[58:01] life you begin to take
[58:04] step and you cannot

[58:20] side something now begins to announce

[59:21] clay and see the unveiling glory on the
[59:24] side of them

[59:28] hallelujah when you don't serve the eye
[59:31] of

[59:48] ins side of
[59:50] you amen that's the eye of a man we are

[1:00:01] Glory it's a growing
[1:00:05] glory amen praise the Lord and you know
[1:00:08] when you put a seed in the
[1:00:11] ground you can
[1:00:13] sit from morning to evening but you
[1:00:17] never see how it grows but it's growing
[1:00:21] anyway praise the Lord because one time
[1:00:24] it was one foot
[1:00:27] another time it will be two feet but

[1:01:06] push his glorious

[1:01:17] dedication of the Tabernacle of
[1:01:20] Moses oh praise God that light that was
[1:01:25] in the h of hly finally pushed
[1:01:29] out and he started to hang upon the
[1:01:33] Tabernacle until the
[1:01:36] morning and that light could only be
[1:01:40] seen because it cleared the
[1:01:44] darkness I know you are walking in some
[1:01:47] dark
[1:01:50] spots amen but I want to say this the
[1:01:54] light of God

[1:02:14] skin amen the BG
[1:02:18] skin amen that were actually the uh CS
[1:02:22] of the holy of holies
[1:02:27] and penetrated
[1:02:30] through until the world was able to see
[1:02:34] that I want to
[1:02:37] prophesy that before we
[1:02:39] leave Hallelujah everyone will have an
[1:02:44] opportunity to shange that
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:49] life there must come your manifestation
[1:02:52] as a Son of
[1:02:54] God I want say that your light will be
[1:02:58] seen because God cannot light a
[1:03:03] candle permanently keep it under the
[1:03:06] bush of your human
[1:03:10] body that light will have to come
[1:03:13] out your light will be your
[1:03:17] testimony in
[1:03:20] public they will say something is
[1:03:22] happening with that son or daughter of
[1:03:24] God
[1:03:27] just like the song writer
[1:03:30] say I let my little light
[1:03:34] shine are you going to let your little
[1:03:37] light amen and brother Bram
[1:03:41] says light is on the side of
[1:03:44] you as small as a button of a
[1:03:49] sh that light there is the still Small
[1:03:54] Voice it's not so
[1:03:56] loud Small Voice which tells you don't
[1:04:01] go that
[1:04:02] route don't go that rout and then
[1:04:06] brother Bram says but it
[1:04:09] grows and begins to crowd all the
[1:04:15] darkness
[1:04:17] amen yes sir I want say something here
[1:04:21] and I want you to understand
[1:04:26] that if a
[1:04:28] man was commissioned to write the story
[1:04:31] of
[1:04:34] David because he has human
[1:04:37] eyes he would write like the red
[1:04:43] paper they go in
[1:04:46] Parliament
[1:04:48] parament and they read the
[1:04:50] budget they
[1:04:53] read but then the following
[1:04:57] day when they bring out the
[1:04:59] paper they are not talking about
[1:05:03] figures they are talking about a
[1:05:05] sleeping
[1:05:08] Minister a sleeping MP those are the
[1:05:12] pictures which come
[1:05:15] out are you together with
[1:05:18] me so if that's the eye of a
[1:05:24] man when told to write your
[1:05:28] story you are scoring
[1:05:33] 75% but they write the
[1:05:38] 25% man will
[1:05:42] emphasize where you still
[1:05:45] fail but God will
[1:05:48] emphasize where you are standing
[1:05:51] right that's the nature and character of
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:55] that's the way he spoke to the seven
[1:05:57] Church
[1:05:58] ages he kept talking about their
[1:06:02] successes and then just at the bottom
[1:06:05] here then he says but I have one thing
[1:06:08] against
[1:06:10] you but after appreciating the
[1:06:13] 75 but the eye of man will only write
[1:06:17] about the
[1:06:18] 25 and we
[1:06:20] encouraged that God recognizes every
[1:06:24] little thing we have
[1:06:26] overcome that's where you are writing
[1:06:29] your own
[1:06:31] history if a man has right your history
[1:06:35] he the
[1:06:37] 25% where you still
[1:06:39] fail amen if a man is commissioned to
[1:06:43] write the story of
[1:06:46] David he would not be
[1:06:49] patient until he sees that
[1:06:53] Solomon has established the
[1:06:56] om and pass it over to his son
[1:07:00] Solomon he will not be
[1:07:03] patient is the eye of a
[1:07:06] man and there's no long suffering to the
[1:07:09] eye of a
[1:07:11] man amen he talk about
[1:07:15] David how he killed a man for his
[1:07:18] wife he talk about David when he did not
[1:07:22] go to
[1:07:23] war and then he was just relaxing home
[1:07:27] and got involved with somebody's wife
[1:07:30] that's the eye of a man but the eye of
[1:07:34] God has long suffering and I want to say
[1:07:38] God will be patient with you your story
[1:07:42] is
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:46] perfect you just need to BU yourself in
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:51] world study the word pray about your
[1:07:54] condition
[1:07:56] God knows you don't say Lord you know my
[1:07:59] weaknesses just mention what your
[1:08:01] problem is that's how you are going to
[1:08:04] get your
[1:08:07] deliver
[1:08:09] amen oh hallelujah hallelujah if his
[1:08:13] thought record the story of
[1:08:16] Abraham he said this man was
[1:08:23] UN he fa to in the face of the
[1:08:27] famine and fled to
[1:08:30] Egypt and yet that's exactly in Genesis
[1:08:35] 12 when he had just stepped into the
[1:08:40] landine they'll talk about
[1:08:43] H they talk about
[1:08:46] is man will say
[1:08:48] that amen even after his new
[1:08:52] B in Genesis 17
[1:08:56] he still failed and went to to
[1:09:00] J amen man we look at Abraham's
[1:09:06] failure
[1:09:08] Amen to understand the promise when you
[1:09:11] know to miss the weakness when he SED a
[1:09:14] child with
[1:09:18] Huger but when
[1:09:21] God looked at Abraham
[1:09:25] he looked at him after the fight is
[1:09:30] over he a god of long
[1:09:34] suffering and when God looked at
[1:09:38] Abraham he says that his Ted
[1:09:44] not at the promises of
[1:09:47] God Amen he T
[1:09:52] noten I believe that am natural
[1:09:57] struggles there is a deid on the side of
[1:10:00] you a man after God's Own
[1:10:05] Heart are you together with me yes sir
[1:10:10] praise the Lord that David On th side
[1:10:14] will not die until you bring forth
[1:10:18] Solomon which is divine
[1:10:22] stability to the kingdom of your body
[1:10:26] a man will have control over the
[1:10:32] kingdom amen you are going to produce
[1:10:36] your
[1:10:37] Solomon to bring down all the
[1:10:41] enemies that surround your
[1:10:44] kingdom did you hear what I
[1:10:47] say amen and again I know you will
[1:10:52] grow into a temple of Glory
[1:10:56] amen there's something in you that only
[1:11:00] God can
[1:11:06] understand it's only Christ who
[1:11:09] understood the
[1:11:10] mystery that laid behind Peter's you
[1:11:14] know unguided zeal
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:31] because he was on fire of
[1:11:33] everything but in everything Peter was
[1:11:37] making
[1:11:38] mistakes and then he would be rebuked be
[1:11:41] behind me Satan then he comes back again
[1:11:45] then another thing and everything was
[1:11:48] wrong but God is the only one who
[1:11:53] understood Peter
[1:11:56] and he says when you are
[1:12:00] converted strengthen your
[1:12:03] brethren I want to tell you this
[1:12:05] morning God understands you
[1:12:09] better than even you understand
[1:12:12] yourself there's an unfolding mystery in
[1:12:15] you that's why you must write your own
[1:12:21] history just be like a
[1:12:24] Peter drop your Zeal don't stay away
[1:12:27] from the master you know me they called
[1:12:31] me a devil okay let him go with those
[1:12:34] ones who are not
[1:12:35] devils and then the following day you
[1:12:37] are not in church you must have a
[1:12:41] seal
[1:12:43] Hallelujah God knows and when these
[1:12:46] negatives are being
[1:12:48] saved it's not
[1:12:50] Peter he's talking to the
[1:12:53] seven but
[1:12:56] even if you preach a strong gospel and
[1:12:59] you preach hard and rough you can never
[1:13:02] preach a one
[1:13:05] elect Hallelujah an elect will always
[1:13:09] remain
[1:13:11] Hallelujah when
[1:13:14] now go
[1:13:17] back when he says go back he was not
[1:13:21] talking
[1:13:22] truth no sir amen he was only talking to
[1:13:28] who is
[1:13:32] that so when you come to church when you
[1:13:36] are a seed of God whatever you hear and
[1:13:40] how you hear we always be
[1:13:44] postive amen you see a n
[1:13:49] SE will always negatively interpret
[1:13:52] things that are saying
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:58] but the
[1:13:59] SE when they don't
[1:14:02] understand they would take the master
[1:14:05] away and they
[1:14:08] say master tell us the the par of the
[1:14:15] S they are not going to become
[1:14:18] Negative they go back to the world and
[1:14:22] they are going to deep and they are
[1:14:24] going to
[1:14:26] until the master will reveal to them
[1:14:29] whatever he
[1:14:31] met whenever we come down here to preach
[1:14:35] there is something the Lord wants to say
[1:14:37] to
[1:14:40] you and if you don't
[1:14:43] understand don't be like the rest of the
[1:14:46] people and said this is a hard saying
[1:14:49] you should be like the 12
[1:14:53] disciples amen
[1:14:55] when he ask them will you also go away
[1:14:59] you say
[1:15:00] no whom shall we go you have the words
[1:15:03] of eternal life we need to be
[1:15:08] positive amen oh yes sir don't allow
[1:15:12] external
[1:15:15] criticism to destroy your unfolding
[1:15:19] Glory because one thing which I know you
[1:15:23] are still in the pters
[1:15:26] house Hallelujah hallu he may break you
[1:15:29] today and make you a little halfway and
[1:15:33] then he finds out that you have to be
[1:15:35] broken again I don't care how many times
[1:15:40] you are broken but as long as you are
[1:15:42] still in the
[1:15:43] prot at the end of the day you are going
[1:15:46] to
[1:15:48] produce a ver of
[1:15:51] Honor that's what we are here for to a
[1:15:55] ver of
[1:15:57] Honor
[1:15:59] amen just hang out there in the Porter's
[1:16:03] hands amen God saw something in you and
[1:16:08] is the one who placed it in that body
[1:16:11] and he must strug and
[1:16:13] find until that which is On th side will
[1:16:18] his glory on the outside and you will
[1:16:21] walk as a Victorious Christian in area
[1:16:25] yes where you used to go to the night
[1:16:28] club and let them say there goes the
[1:16:31] light of
[1:16:37] God tell your brother I
[1:16:44] overcome we shall
[1:16:48] overcome you see the prophet told us he
[1:16:52] did not call them from Egypt
[1:16:55] to destroy them in the
[1:16:56] wilderness he delivered them to give
[1:17:00] them a
[1:17:02] possession and that's what you are here
[1:17:05] for you are not a tourist in the
[1:17:09] wilderness tell the devil I'm not
[1:17:11] a in the wildness I will make
[1:17:16] it amen the prophet
[1:17:19] says how can I take a CO
[1:17:30] and make a grain of wheat out of
[1:17:35] it because these are things which are
[1:17:37] not
[1:17:39] possible because these bodies here they
[1:17:43] are
[1:17:45] coas they are products of a
[1:17:49] union amen of I mean of I mean
[1:17:55] of Eve and The
[1:18:00] Serpent and then out of there I want say
[1:18:05] it very well that you may understand
[1:18:08] it that when the
[1:18:12] serpent got an opportunity with
[1:18:17] Eve then you know Cain was
[1:18:22] born they went on the other side
[1:18:25] and then the Seed of Abraham will stayed
[1:18:27] in the
[1:18:29] west but as they kept
[1:18:32] multiplying the sons of God so the
[1:18:35] daughters of
[1:18:36] men and now when they mix the seed could
[1:18:41] no longer be told by the physical
[1:18:46] flesh are you together with me it can
[1:18:49] never anymore so this is a hybrid body
[1:18:56] that's why it cannot go to heaven The
[1:18:59] Way It
[1:19:01] Is God PS out the
[1:19:05] seed the
[1:19:06] soul and takes it into
[1:19:10] theop and then the body
[1:19:12] dies and for it to go to heaven it has
[1:19:16] to be spoken
[1:19:18] back into
[1:19:20] creation into the Rapture and that
[1:19:23] purifies you
[1:19:26] but in this form here it's a hybrid body
[1:19:31] that cannot go to heaven the way it
[1:19:33] is unless it go through the Rapture
[1:19:37] which is the body
[1:19:41] change are you together with me yes sir
[1:19:45] this body here will always be your
[1:19:50] trouble that's why brother Bram says how
[1:19:55] can I take a
[1:19:57] CO this hybrid
[1:19:59] body and make a grain of wheat out of
[1:20:03] it he says it's impossible for me to do
[1:20:07] it the only way it can be is because
[1:20:12] inside of that
[1:20:14] Co has to be
[1:20:17] transmitted from
[1:20:24] J called weak
[1:20:28] life amen he says this is here there's
[1:20:33] no way you can turn
[1:20:34] them amen praise the Lord into which the
[1:20:39] only thing God
[1:20:41] does is to take the wheat
[1:20:45] jam and put it in this Co
[1:20:49] here hallelujah hallelujah and when it's
[1:20:52] planted
[1:20:54] Amen in death it brings back the life of
[1:21:00] the whe On
[1:21:02] th oh hallelujah hallelujah we do not
[1:21:05] know what we shall be but when he
[1:21:08] appears we shall be
[1:21:11] like yes there is something on the side
[1:21:15] of you and that's what writes your
[1:21:19] story Hallelujah because it's a nature
[1:21:23] of God
[1:21:25] amen he says the only way it can be is
[1:21:29] because inside that
[1:21:31] Co has been transmitted from a
[1:21:36] CO to a jam called wheat
[1:21:40] life amen then you bu that
[1:21:45] Co and it will produce a grain of
[1:21:49] wheat amen because there has been a life
[1:21:55] a wheat on the inside of the
[1:21:59] co and the life of the
[1:22:02] co has been taken out but the nature of
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:09] hallelujah hallelujah at this
[1:22:12] present moment the nature of the
[1:22:16] co still
[1:22:18] sticks and it will be until this new
[1:22:23] life F been
[1:22:26] devolved out of the
[1:22:28] ground and raised
[1:22:32] up as long as you in this
[1:22:35] Co there are certain little
[1:22:38] feelings that you are going to have
[1:22:42] maybe about your husband maybe about
[1:22:45] your wife maybe about your friend about
[1:22:49] the church those little
[1:22:52] feelings but deep Down On th
[1:22:55] there is a j of great
[1:22:58] life Hallelujah you can run away from
[1:23:02] the Brotherhood but the J on the inside
[1:23:07] keeps bringing you
[1:23:10] back because this is where your people
[1:23:14] are the people you are going to enjoy
[1:23:16] etern to we not out there they are here
[1:23:21] the one next to you is your brother is
[1:23:25] your sister but what you see is the
[1:23:28] problem of the co
[1:23:31] nature and God will deal with it until
[1:23:36] every one of you will write your own
[1:23:42] story amen you feel a c to Holiness in
[1:23:47] yourself because on the inside of your
[1:23:51] Co inside that wickedness
[1:23:54] there is a we life that keeps pushing
[1:23:58] through just look behind the yes that
[1:24:02] you have
[1:24:03] moved and you start saying hey those
[1:24:06] years
[1:24:07] behind if this happen two years
[1:24:11] ago you also know there is something
[1:24:15] changing on the
[1:24:18] side so you are a seed on the
[1:24:22] side that will always have battles with
[1:24:24] the
[1:24:26] co amen when Nature on the outside and
[1:24:30] these battles are
[1:24:33] unique amen they are not the same your
[1:24:37] battles are different and my battles are
[1:24:41] different amen the same
[1:24:44] Faith but different
[1:24:47] battles different battles that we go
[1:24:51] through
[1:24:52] amen oh abr's battles were
[1:24:57] different the battles of Moses were
[1:25:00] different the battles of De were
[1:25:03] different but the power behind that
[1:25:08] victory was the same
[1:25:12] Faith so the challenge of
[1:25:15] Enoch and Abraham and Moses were
[1:25:20] different
[1:25:22] amen you know and when when you would
[1:25:24] get these men
[1:25:26] together they would say what are you

[1:26:01] Flames killing people around
[1:26:04] us and they threw us there what are you
[1:26:07] talking
[1:26:09] about and this is what happens we always
[1:26:13] criticize one
[1:26:15] another because this man here is crying
[1:26:18] over little things this man here he has
[1:26:21] not even come to my level
[1:26:25] our
[1:26:27] paths are
[1:26:29] different every man must write
[1:26:36] hisory amen they would point at each
[1:26:40] other's crying
[1:26:43] points as just
[1:26:47] weakness so
[1:26:50] stability is

[1:27:33] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:27:37] and reaching forth onto those things
[1:27:40] which are before
[1:27:43] us that's the way we need to
[1:27:46] move don't keep your eyes
[1:27:49] behind the victories you
[1:27:52] had thank God for
[1:27:55] but there are more battles to
[1:27:58] fight amen and all
[1:28:02] Christians have got those great areas in
[1:28:05] their
[1:28:07] [Music]

[1:29:52] 11 they are
[1:29:55] louds because they are
[1:30:00] numerous they didn't bring all of them
[1:30:03] out because they are
[1:30:06] many they don't talk about
[1:30:09] sha there are so
[1:30:12] many and then Paul says a
[1:30:17] cloud of
[1:30:18] witnesses when you

[1:30:23] witness
[1:30:26] hallelujah hallelujah you become a CL

[1:30:39] people in their different battles of
[1:30:42] life so he says we have got these
[1:30:46] clouds they our examples we have seen
[1:30:50] how they
[1:30:52] overcame so let us aside
[1:30:56] everywh and the sin which so easily
[1:30:59] beset
[1:31:01] us and let us run with
[1:31:06] patience it's not 100 me

[1:31:13] marathon with that one you run with
[1:31:18] patience
[1:31:20] amen the rest that is set before us
[1:31:24] so let us lay
[1:31:27] [Music]

[1:31:33] Bes to be set is to continually
[1:31:41] attouch a man yours might be
[1:31:45] temper and another man is struggling
[1:31:48] with something
[1:31:51] different and many times the man with
[1:31:53] temp

[1:31:59] weak like a man who is a
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:13] li that that

[1:32:41] faith for the joy that was set before
[1:32:47] him endured the

[1:33:17] prison are you together with me for the
[1:33:20] Jo that was set before him so we need to

[1:33:29] the mystery of God for our
[1:33:32] lives you say Lord reveal to me what my
[1:33:36] position is in the
[1:33:38] body and the moment you see your
[1:33:41] position you are not going to rest until

[1:33:49] through despising the sh
[1:33:55] despise the
[1:33:58] hardships I'm suffering
[1:34:00] today but God has set something special
[1:34:03] for me ahead of
[1:34:05] me so the eyes must be kept on the
[1:34:10] go as we fight our besetting
[1:34:14] sins and these sins differ one from
[1:34:19] another amen we shall just go to the
[1:34:22] book of Galatians
[1:34:26] 5 and verse
[1:34:29] 19 these are the works of the
[1:34:32] flesh amen they are so
[1:34:36] besetting amen everyone as I speak knows
[1:34:41] his area of
[1:34:43] battle now the works of the flesh are
[1:34:46] manifest verse
[1:34:50] 19 which are these adultery
[1:34:54] fornication
[1:34:56] uncleanness

[1:36:10] like amen and it's the nature of
[1:36:15] man when he's suffering from this kind
[1:36:17] of
[1:36:19] condition to put his weakness on
[1:36:23] somebody
[1:36:28] [Music]

[1:36:31] church but people of that church failed
[1:36:36] me they put their mistakes and failures
[1:36:40] on somebody

[1:36:45] man when God asked
[1:36:48] Adam amen Adam said the woman you gave

[1:40:41] like
[1:40:43] then it is also the nature of
[1:40:47] man to look at the failure of
[1:40:51] another not his own so the best
[1:40:54] Christian
[1:40:56] attitude is to so much care for your
[1:41:00] condition as you care for your
[1:41:06] brother's amen let's go to John chapter
[1:41:10] 8 and look at this interesting
[1:41:13] story are you still there my
[1:41:16] friends amen verse three says and the
[1:41:22] scribes and
[1:41:24] Pharisees brought him a
[1:41:26] woman taken in
[1:41:29] adult and when they had set her in the
[1:41:33] midst they say unto him
[1:41:36] Master this woman was taken in ad doubt
[1:41:41] in the very
[1:41:43] act now Moses in the
[1:41:47] law commanded us it always comes with a
[1:41:51] quot
[1:41:54] did you hear that it comes with a quot
[1:41:59] even brother Bram
[1:42:01] say hey so this one say Moses in the
[1:42:05] Lord commanded us that should be
[1:42:10] stoned but what do you
[1:42:13] say so why do you bring her to
[1:42:17] me if you know what to
[1:42:21] do they want to Tes him what do you say
[1:42:26] are you standing very perfect in the
[1:42:29] law the law would Stone this
[1:42:32] woman but there is something here that's
[1:42:36] the eye of a man it will always be
[1:42:41] selective the woman is CAU in a
[1:42:43] doubt it's an act of two
[1:42:46] people where is the
[1:42:50] man are you together with me wanted to
[1:42:54] write This Woman's
[1:42:56] story and not their
[1:42:59] own and that of the
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:03] man because this men who are bringing
[1:43:07] this
[1:43:08] man this woman is not because they are
[1:43:13] perfect they've been in the same
[1:43:17] condition but they want to write
[1:43:19] somebody's
[1:43:20] story you must write your
[1:43:25] St care for your Christian
[1:43:28] Life when you come to church Lord speak
[1:43:32] to me
[1:43:34] person help me get me out of this
[1:43:38] area honest with
[1:43:43] God because Leviticus
[1:43:47] 20 and verse 10 the scripture says
[1:43:53] and the man that commit adultery with
[1:43:57] another man's wife even he that commit
[1:44:00] adultery with his neighbor's wife the
[1:44:03] adulterer and the adulteress shall
[1:44:06] surely be put to death but this time
[1:44:08] we've only brought this woman
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:29] are you together with me so
[1:44:33] Jesus in his
[1:44:35] response does not encourage
[1:44:40] sin but he's pointing out to the
[1:44:43] attitude of the
[1:44:48] people you see he that is without sin
[1:44:52] among you
[1:44:54] let him be the first to cast a stone at
[1:44:59] her and everyone dropped his
[1:45:03] Stone and walked
[1:45:07] away he was trying to
[1:45:11] deal with the attitude of the
[1:45:14] people amen yes sir he is encouraging
[1:45:19] people to deal with their p
[1:45:23] besetting
[1:45:27] SE to be as
[1:45:30] concerned as they are concerned over
[1:45:36] their so I'm still L the foundation
[1:45:40] here to deal with
[1:45:43] Abraham but let us look at the attitude
[1:45:46] of
[1:45:48] balak a little
[1:45:51] bit do you love him
[1:45:54] Write Your
[1:45:55] Story help your
[1:45:58] brother amen Write Your Story help your
[1:46:04] brother and one of these days I'm coming
[1:46:07] with the subject help your
[1:46:11] brother
[1:46:14] amen so Numbers Chapter
[1:46:19] 23 it's a bit of a few scriptures to
[1:46:22] read
[1:46:26] and he took in verse
[1:46:28] seven and he took up his
[1:46:31] Parable and said balak the king of Moab
[1:46:36] has brought me from Aram out of
[1:46:39] mountains of the East saying come cast
[1:46:43] me Jacob and come defy Israel
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:09] that's now
[1:47:11] bam but then he says how shall I cast
[1:47:15] whom God has not
[1:47:20] cast how shall I defy whom the Lord has
[1:47:24] not
[1:47:27] defiled he knows the
[1:47:32] fact verse n for from the top of the
[1:47:36] Rocks I see
[1:47:42] him and from the hills I
[1:47:46] behold the people shall dwell alone
[1:47:54] and shall not be recalled among the
[1:47:59] Nations is looking at the favor God has
[1:48:03] put upon
[1:48:06] Israel then he says in verse 10 who can
[1:48:10] count the dust of
[1:48:13] Jacob and the number of the fourth part
[1:48:16] of
[1:48:19] Israel let me die the death of the
[1:48:24] right and let my last end be like
[1:48:35] his now this
[1:48:37] is he's speaking a
[1:48:41] par and he
[1:48:43] says these are very blessed people these
[1:48:47] are people of the promise this move here
[1:48:49] you are seeing is God trying to get a
[1:48:54] pride out of these people and I desire
[1:48:58] if anything when I die I want to be part
[1:49:02] of
[1:49:04] that you see
[1:49:09] and what has thou done unto
[1:49:12] me I took the to cast my
[1:49:17] enemies and behold thou has blessed them
[1:49:19] all together
[1:49:23] but the
[1:49:24] secret is that On th
[1:49:29] side there was a wheat
[1:49:34] life that could not be
[1:49:37] destroyed you see I was telling the
[1:49:41] people you cannot kill the
[1:49:44] Shar and have the
[1:49:47] seed that's what I was telling the
[1:49:49] people about Israel
[1:49:52] it doesn't matter how they get
[1:49:56] buffeted there is no way they can kill
[1:49:59] the
[1:50:00] nation and have the
[1:50:05] 144,000 God will protect
[1:50:09] them because in there there was a
[1:50:15] life I used together with me
[1:50:19] balak was looking at the Shar
[1:50:23] was looking at the
[1:50:26] co but on the
[1:50:29] inside there was a
[1:50:31] nation there was the line of the
[1:50:38] Messiah Israel
[1:50:44] was it was in the history I mean in the
[1:50:48] process of writing it history
[1:50:53] but baac chose to defy
[1:50:58] Israel by the
[1:51:00] condition that they were
[1:51:06] fighting are you together with me they
[1:51:10] chose to
[1:51:12] defy because Israel was still fighting
[1:51:15] certain
[1:51:19] Wicked God have mercy
[1:51:25] let us fight the battles of our
[1:51:29] flesh and come to a
[1:51:34] victory amen listen
[1:51:38] now this is
[1:51:40] balac says to Bam come I pray thee with
[1:51:46] me and another place from where you may
[1:51:50] see that you see but the at most Thou
[1:51:53] shalt see
[1:51:56] them and thou sht see but the atmost
[1:52:01] part of
[1:52:02] them and shall not see them all and cast
[1:52:07] them from there come and I show you the
[1:52:11] weakness and then cast
[1:52:15] them but the eye of

[1:52:29] fighter by the eye of God you are
[1:52:35] UNC
[1:52:38] Amen brother Bram in the message ey of
[1:52:44] God he said Jesus
[1:52:47] said yes Jesus
[1:52:49] said lo I am with you always even to the
[1:52:55] end and we are nearing the
[1:52:58] end then Jesus
[1:53:01] confirm that guiding
[1:53:04] eye amen being with him in the days when
[1:53:09] he revealed himself to the
[1:53:12] Jews before the ending of that church
[1:53:15] age for the
[1:53:17] Jews amen he manifested it looking
[1:53:21] through the eye of God
[1:53:25] he did the same thing to the
[1:53:27] Samaritans and now we go to the Gentiles
[1:53:32] left and tonight God still looks through
[1:53:36] that same
[1:53:38] ey because Christ is the same yesterday
[1:53:41] today and
[1:53:43] forever and he still look through the
[1:53:45] eye of
[1:53:46] God and we can with his
[1:53:49] grace and sanctifying Power
[1:53:53] he L us and has called us to be Sons and
[1:53:59] Daughters he use us as
[1:54:02] Vine and branches in the vine to still
[1:54:06] look through the eye of God to see what
[1:54:09] has been and what will be and will not
[1:54:13] walk in darkness as long as walk through
[1:54:17] the eye of
[1:54:20] God put on the of
[1:54:23] God before you start the B of your
[1:54:27] flesh amen the eye of God says one thing
[1:54:32] you are
[1:54:33] predestinated after the adoption of
[1:54:36] children it's a
[1:54:38] journey and not a
[1:54:43] destiny amen
[1:54:48] predestinated you are at this spot here
[1:54:51] but is the other
[1:54:53] war between now and that they are
[1:54:57] battles of the flesh to
[1:54:59] fight amen and as you walk through all
[1:55:04] these kind of battles I want to say one
[1:55:07] thing you are writing your own
[1:55:12] story amen God loves
[1:55:17] Spirit God loves holiness
[1:55:24] amen so according to the good pleasure
[1:55:27] of his will let's go to
[1:55:32] Ephesians
[1:55:35] Ephesians having predestinated
[1:55:39] D the adoption of
[1:55:43] children by Jesus
[1:55:45] Christ himself according to the good
[1:55:49] plure of his will
[1:55:52] it's a
[1:55:54] journey that has the Red
[1:55:57] Sea it's a journey that has the
[1:56:01] Wilderness it's a journey that has got
[1:56:04] the River
[1:56:05] Jordan and as you stand you just say
[1:56:10] he's still working on
[1:56:11] me is that amen for
[1:56:15] you he's still working on me
[1:56:22] if you stay in the Porter's
[1:56:25] hand you will finally make a verse of
[1:56:29] Honor are you together with me don't
[1:56:32] jump from the Porter's
[1:56:35] heart the breaking is painful
[1:56:39] sometimes but when the maker is
[1:56:43] breaking he's breaking you for your own
[1:56:48] good amen if you st the Porter's hand
[1:56:53] you finally make the verse of
[1:56:57] Honor he will take you
[1:57:00] back to the
[1:57:03] wheel amen and REM you until you meet
[1:57:08] the Lord's purpose in your
[1:57:12] life amen now out of the same
[1:57:17] CL makes the vessel of
[1:57:20] honor and makes the Of
[1:57:24] Dishonor now some vessels of
[1:57:27] Honor are made straight from the first
[1:57:32] mold amen but
[1:57:35] some have broken again and
[1:57:39] again not because they are not
[1:57:43] elected but because they are being
[1:57:47] affected by some spiritual negative
[1:57:50] spiritual environment
[1:57:55] amen you see the environment around this
[1:58:00] vessel causes the mod to go
[1:58:04] wrong and so God has to take back this
[1:58:09] vessel into the Porter's
[1:58:11] house maybe they had a form of
[1:58:14] ministerial
[1:58:17] approach amen which was a little bit
[1:58:20] faulty Maybe maybe they are pulled on a
[1:58:23] wrong influence
[1:58:26] somehow maybe the environment where they
[1:58:29] live affects
[1:58:31] them maybe the nature of job or business
[1:58:35] they
[1:58:37] involved when they almost making a verse
[1:58:40] of
[1:58:42] Honor then it's broken again but the
[1:58:45] master knows why he has to break him the
[1:58:49] master knows why he takes to Hebrews
[1:58:53] 12 the master knows why we must be
[1:58:57] chastised not for our B but for our
[1:59:04] go praise the
[1:59:06] Lord the reason you are broken in the
[1:59:08] hands of the
[1:59:11] Porter is one it's because you are
[1:59:16] unelect and he must bring you to your
[1:59:20] spot of Honor
[1:59:23] amen he break you over and
[1:59:26] over until you get
[1:59:29] out what he wants out of
[1:59:32] you the quicker you step
[1:59:35] away from the
[1:59:37] environment the
[1:59:40] better it took Israel 40
[1:59:43] years in the hands of the
[1:59:46] P to make a
[1:59:49] na how many years is it taking taking
[1:59:53] me God knows but as long as a manone

[2:11:21] will be
[2:11:22] trained to conform to His Image in their
[2:11:27] work he reproves
[2:11:30] him with long
[2:11:33] suffering and gentleness and
[2:11:36] mercy he chest with nails cut
[2:11:41] hands sometimes this
[2:11:44] poter may take the vessel he's working
[2:11:49] on and suddenly breaking
[2:11:52] in order that he may rebuild it exactly
[2:12:03] desires breaks it
[2:12:06] up no this side here should have been
[2:12:11] this side
[2:12:16] here and then you cry but that's the
[2:12:19] love of God to
[2:12:22] he's helping you to write the
[2:12:25] story of the verse of
[2:12:28] Honor that you
[2:12:31] are
[2:12:32] amen there before him lies mankind as
[2:12:36] all lamps
[2:12:41] of so men of
[2:12:43] character are molded in fire Trials of
[2:12:48] affliction
[2:12:55] then we read about their
[2:12:58] stories we enjoy the story of the
[2:13:01] character of
[2:13:04] Jacob who was molded in
[2:13:08] suffering we enjoy the story of
[2:13:12] Joseph molded through
[2:13:15] suffering and these men they give us
[2:13:19] their story because they never jumped
[2:13:22] off the
[2:13:27] wheel they were
[2:13:29] patient your will be
[2:13:34] done
[2:13:35] listen when God calls us he justifies us
[2:13:40] it's a
[2:13:42] journey then he sanctifies us and then
[2:13:47] he baptizes us with
[2:13:49] the but in the stage of
[2:13:54] justification we cannot bypass Romans
[2:13:59] 7 the painful
[2:14:03] desire to become the better
[2:14:06] man how many of you say Lord make me
[2:14:09] better this
[2:14:10] morning but we can never
[2:14:13] bypass Romans chapter
[2:14:16] 7 because in there you always cry
[2:14:21] out for that which I do I allow
[2:14:25] not for what I would I do not but what I
[2:14:30] hate that I
[2:14:32] do then you come to church and you cry
[2:14:36] you cannot
[2:14:38] byass the desire for a better person
[2:14:43] must become so heavy upon
[2:14:45] us for us to be able to go into prayer
[2:14:49] about our journey
[2:14:54] he says for I know that in
[2:14:57] me that's in my
[2:14:59] flesh is no good thing for me to will
[2:15:03] his
[2:15:09] present is with
[2:15:11] me but
[2:15:14] how
[2:15:15] per I find not
[2:15:21] you said now Lord again I'm failing here
[2:15:25] I'm failing here but deep down on this
[2:15:29] side you know you are a child of
[2:15:32] God God give me Grace God give me
[2:15:37] mercy cry alled man that I am who shall
[2:15:43] deliver
[2:15:44] me from the body of this
[2:15:47] death at that point God takes you to the
[2:15:52] pter
[2:15:54] house breaks you in
[2:15:58] sanctification points out this points
[2:16:02] out that you cry and say God have Mer
[2:16:05] supp but the entire purpose of
[2:16:08] God is that at the end of
[2:16:11] it you must be a ver of
[2:16:15] Honor that's why we are in
[2:16:18] church not to continue the way we live
[2:16:20] our life
[2:16:22] but God to make us vessels of
[2:16:28] honor and as God breaks
[2:16:31] us let us pray that we don't jump off
[2:16:36] the v i mean the
[2:16:39] wheel The God Who is reaching
[2:16:42] Mercy
[2:16:43] amen graduate student Romans
[2:16:48] 8 there's therefore no condemnation
[2:16:52] we have stepped into
[2:16:54] Christ so the
[2:16:56] journey could
[2:16:58] belong as the Jour of the
[2:17:00] Corinthians let me finish on this you
[2:17:04] know the
[2:17:05] Corinthians the scripture says in First
[2:17:09] Corinthians chapter
[2:17:11] one and verse one it says
[2:17:16] called to be Saints
[2:17:22] they were not
[2:17:23] yet but the
[2:17:26] call was to make them
[2:17:30] Saint that's the call God has
[2:17:33] given
[2:17:35] called to be sa and now when he calls
[2:17:39] you you have got a certain character
[2:17:41] around
[2:17:43] you that God is working
[2:17:46] on so that he can get the saint out of
[2:17:50] you
[2:17:53] amen so by going by the way the
[2:17:57] Corinthians
[2:17:59] were they were called to be
[2:18:01] Saints but they were still divided along
[2:18:04] human
[2:18:06] life I am of Paul I am of seas I am of
[2:18:11] Apollos they Le on human
[2:18:15] wisdom and Paul called that foolishness
[2:18:17] to
[2:18:19] God they robbed each
[2:18:21] other amen when this borrowed money
[2:18:24] never
[2:18:26] pay amen they took each other cour of
[2:18:31] law they things sacrific to
[2:18:35] Idols was immorality to the I mean to
[2:18:39] the level of
[2:18:42] incest
[2:18:45] amen what is
[2:18:55] yeah amen are you together with me so
[2:18:58] they
[2:19:00] relied on natural
[2:19:04] evidences
[2:19:06] amen Paul brought
[2:19:09] them to a higher level of
[2:19:13] understanding and he started pointing
[2:19:16] them to the
[2:19:18] go amen go
[2:19:22] am and then Paul says I has not
[2:19:27] seen heard may have entered into the
[2:19:30] heart of man the things which God has
[2:19:33] prepared for them that love are you
[2:19:37] together with him so Paul was laboring
[2:19:40] with
[2:19:41] them he was like a pter he break them
[2:19:45] here M them there break them there m
[2:19:49] them here
[2:19:51] PA was patient with
[2:19:54] them amen so but from Corinthians 9
[2:19:59] Corinthians
[2:20:02] 9 Paul starts to stabilize the
[2:20:07] church by setting them in
[2:20:10] order he teaches them the
[2:20:13] authority he has over them as the
[2:20:15] Apostle and messenger of the
[2:20:19] age in First Corinthians
[2:20:22] 10 he brings the power of the
[2:20:25] Corinth to the church in the
[2:20:28] wilderness and they learn to
[2:20:31] see how the church in the
[2:20:34] wilderness failed to enter into the
[2:20:37] promise but the consistent mistakes they
[2:20:42] did so the Corinthian Church learns to
[2:20:46] avoid the same
[2:20:48] mistakes in Corinthians 11
[2:20:51] they were Tau the
[2:20:53] significance of the Lord's
[2:20:56] table and how to approach it then
[2:21:00] chapter 12 the gifts were put in order
[2:21:04] because there were too much in First
[2:21:06] Corinthians 13 they introduced charity
[2:21:11] that must stand with ever again now they
[2:21:14] are going step after step after step to
[2:21:18] come to a certain level
[2:21:21] why they were called to be sa so God
[2:21:25] sees you in the condition where you are
[2:21:29] but he Calla you to make a sent out of
[2:21:35] you amen then from chapter
[2:21:39] 15
[2:21:41] God sees the maturity of the
[2:21:45] crop and then begins to take them on a
[2:21:48] higher level
[2:21:51] amen then you know the rest of all the
[2:21:55] churches he washed them and put them
[2:21:59] into greater spiritual
[2:22:03] Fellowship from
[2:22:06] Canal a highly revelated
[2:22:10] church that's what God is seeking out of
[2:22:14] he doesn't want you to remain the way
[2:22:16] you are he wants to lift you up
[2:22:21] high
[2:22:22] enough that you can completely be kept
[2:22:25] by charity
[2:22:28] himself and then charity begins to
[2:22:31] control your life until he give you body
[2:22:36] change amen you were not called to
[2:22:40] remain in the condition you were called
[2:22:43] you were called to be brought before God
[2:22:47] that God can deal with you as his son
[2:22:53] he begins to teach them
[2:22:55] how he teaches them about the
[2:22:58] resurrection and then he says but some
[2:23:01] man will say how are the dead raised up
[2:23:05] and with what body do they come he's
[2:23:07] taking them at higher
[2:23:09] levels he didn't teach the Colossians
[2:23:12] that he didn't teach the
[2:23:15] Ephesians he's taking them to a higher
[2:23:17] level and that's what God has to do with
[2:23:22] you looking unto
[2:23:25] him that's the
[2:23:29] focus he tells them there is one glory
[2:23:33] of the son there is another glory of the
[2:23:37] Sun and another glory of the Moon and
[2:23:40] another glory of the stars for one star
[2:23:43] differ from
[2:23:44] another in glory so also is the
[2:23:48] resurrection of the Dead it is swn in
[2:23:51] corruption is raised in incorruption it
[2:23:55] is swn in dishonor is raised in glory it
[2:23:58] is sown in weakness is raised in power
[2:24:02] is teaching them spiritual
[2:24:07] things
[2:24:09] amen Natural
[2:24:12] Body it is natural
[2:24:16] body it is you know it's raised the
[2:24:19] spiritual body
[2:24:21] he says there is a natural body and
[2:24:22] there is a spiritual
[2:24:25] body they have now gained the
[2:24:29] level that's what God is doing with
[2:24:34] you he wants you to
[2:24:37] write your
[2:24:40] story in First
[2:24:43] Corinthians the salutation was called to
[2:24:46] be
[2:24:48] Saints but in second
[2:24:51] Coran the
[2:24:55] salutation is the Church of
[2:24:57] God which is that Corinth hallelujah
[2:25:01] hallelujah First Corinthians called to
[2:25:04] be
[2:25:06] Saints but second
[2:25:08] Corinthians the Church of God which is
[2:25:11] at
[2:25:12] cor that's how God wants to
[2:25:15] see along the journey that you have
[2:25:18] written a story
[2:25:21] changing
[2:25:22] character
[2:25:23] history rad
[2:25:29] written and now he confides with
[2:25:36] them into greater
[2:25:39] things of the spirit that's what God
[2:25:42] wants to do why do you want to condemn
[2:25:46] yourself in the condition where you are
[2:25:51] God didn't call
[2:25:53] you for you to die in the
[2:25:56] wilderness you must cross the
[2:26:01] Jordan and get your
[2:26:03] position in the
[2:26:05] body pick your
[2:26:08] inheritance that I'm a Child of
[2:26:11] God Amen so they begin to get great
[2:26:16] Mysteries released to them amen in first
[2:26:21] 2 Corinthians
[2:26:22] 5 they are told about the bodies in
[2:26:26] heaven that are waiting for us when we
[2:26:29] get out of
[2:26:30] this he tells them about greater things
[2:26:34] he talks to them about going beyond the
[2:26:36] curtain of
[2:26:37] time I knew of the Man in
[2:26:40] Christ 14 years ago whether in the body
[2:26:44] I don't know whether in the spirit I
[2:26:46] don't know such a one was caught up in
[2:26:49] the third heaven
[2:26:55] you know the devil is a
[2:26:57] liar he keeps telling
[2:26:59] you the
[2:27:03] standard the church
[2:27:07] preaches is too high for
[2:27:09] you has the dev whispered that to
[2:27:13] you yeah that's too high for
[2:27:16] you but you were
[2:27:18] called and you are on a
[2:27:21] process to become
[2:27:25] s the next
[2:27:28] thing will be the Church of
[2:27:32] God
[2:27:37] called The Church of
[2:27:39] God in
[2:27:42] Corinth they were called to be but now
[2:27:46] they are and now they are being called
[2:27:50] the Church of
[2:27:54] God the Church of
[2:27:57] God the Church of God you know you can
[2:28:01] put yourself there Susan whoever you are
[2:28:05] God has called you to as higher position
[2:28:09] in
[2:28:13] Christ and is bringing you up
[2:28:16] there with long suffering
[2:28:20] you must
[2:28:22] write your own
[2:28:24] story I don't want to write your
[2:28:27] story if I was called TR the story of
[2:28:31] David the eyes of a man they see where a
[2:28:35] man fails but the eyes of God they see
[2:28:39] where you fail and as I told you the
[2:28:42] other day God hides in your weakness to
[2:28:46] reveal his glory
[2:28:53] perfect
[2:28:54] strength in perfect
[2:28:58] weakness do you desire to be an
[2:29:02] overcomer amen and God will give
[2:29:06] that so let's go back to abah a little
[2:29:09] bit the scriptures we dealt
[2:29:13] with just be patient a little bit in
[2:29:17] Hebrews 11 ver8
[2:29:20] you see I want us to
[2:29:22] see how the same
[2:29:25] Faith amen God would
[2:29:30] chelate to work
[2:29:32] differently for men who have been called
[2:29:34] for different
[2:29:38] purposes so
[2:29:40] faith is
[2:29:43] personal
[2:29:47] person it is not given
[2:29:53] generally
[2:29:54] faith is your individual
[2:29:59] revelation of the perfect will of
[2:30:03] God for your life it is strong
[2:30:07] enough to take you
[2:30:09] through the channels that Write Your
[2:30:15] Story it doesn't
[2:30:17] fail it didn't fail in the first
[2:30:21] f it didn't fail in the land's
[2:30:26] Den it doesn't fail it will never
[2:30:31] fail no child of God will fail to make
[2:30:36] it every one of you will write a book of
[2:30:43] Acts there will be a Life of
[2:30:46] Christ manifested in your life
[2:30:50] have been called in the condition of CH
[2:30:54] but at the end of it you are going to
[2:30:57] get
[2:31:03] promises he's now telling them that you
[2:31:06] are going to be changed can you imagine
[2:31:10] the people that were eating things
[2:31:13] sacrificed you can write a perfect story
[2:31:21] okay Hebrews
[2:31:23] 118 by faith
[2:31:25] Abraham when he was called to go into a
[2:31:29] place we should afterward receive for an
[2:31:34] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[2:31:38] knowing where he was
[2:31:41] going so here is divine
[2:31:45] obedience it has nothing for you to
[2:31:48] adequately understand
[2:31:52] Divine obedience
[2:31:53] means start out and wait for
[2:31:57] instructions are you together with me
[2:32:00] yeah so these stories here were written
[2:32:03] one day at a
[2:32:05] time they were not given a
[2:32:08] syus hallelujah hallelujah they were not
[2:32:11] given a syus that Moses when you finish
[2:32:15] this this will happen this will happen
[2:32:18] this will happen and then he goes what
[2:32:21] next no he just obey pick up your stick
[2:32:26] go into Egypt Moses went now I'm in
[2:32:30] Egypt whatever challenge came God
[2:32:33] instructed Moses God will one day at a
[2:32:37] time instr you until at the end of the
[2:32:41] day you will write a story of your
[2:32:48] life the scripture says even Abraham
[2:32:51] didn't
[2:32:53] know amen but he just obeyed he went not
[2:32:57] knowing even where to go but wherever he
[2:33:01] went turn left turn right turn left turn
[2:33:04] right go turn left turn at the end of it
[2:33:08] we have got the story of
[2:33:12] Abraham God knows what is doing in your
[2:33:17] life he says in verse 9
[2:33:20] by
[2:33:22] faith and faith is a revelation when day
