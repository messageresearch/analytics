[10:29] Albert Albert you have such wonderful
[10:31] names like in

[10:35] Albert some of the countries of Africa I
[10:38] cannot even repeat I'm trying five times

[10:55] judgment give
[10:57] life amen to the neighbors and
[11:02] people neighbors and people
[11:05] around look at them from a different
[11:09] perspective first preach them the
[11:12] gospel but if they will not receive the
[11:15] message don't disqualify
[11:20] them don't think they are serpent
[11:23] seed they can be one of the 100
[11:27] Millions from outside of the
[11:31] city don't judge them you are also not

[11:55] Ministry have a Ministry of life
[12:00] show up life God bless you God bless you
[12:03] my brother I I think it's
[12:07] enough amen I think that you
[12:10] understood that what Esther was
[12:13] doing she had to
[12:16] prophesy to her own
[12:18] people and I will say like that she
[12:21] delivered people that she never met
[12:26] physically I want to show you how far is
[12:29] going your
[12:32] ministry
[12:34] Steven oh brother James or you pastors
[12:38] is going further than you
[12:42] think when Esther
[12:44] prophesy according to Revelation 108
[12:49] to1 to many
[12:54] nations to many nations and
[12:57] countries she never saw them
[13:01] physically but the authority of the
[13:04] ring and the
[13:06] documents and the prophecy
[13:09] inside deliver the
[13:11] people that never come to
[13:15] Palace it was not for them to allow to
[13:18] live in the
[13:21] palace I want to show you something you
[13:24] prophesy to people they will never come
[13:27] to the New Jerusalem
[13:29] some of the people they will never come
[13:31] to
[13:33] Palace but don't disqualify
[13:36] them because she by the prophecy she
[13:39] delivered millions of
[13:42] people in 127
[13:45] provinces that never come to
[13:48] Palace amen maybe never saw
[13:51] her but the prophecy was such an
[13:55] impact this message today has such an
[13:58] impact

[25:06] that there was nothing
[25:08] new brother Bram was identifying it from
[25:12] way back in the
[25:14] 50s but because the need was
[25:17] there amen and he says this which we
[25:20] have seen
[25:22] temporarily as we
[25:25] continue speaking life we shall end up

[25:45] Life greater than
[25:48] this don't go into prayer and
[25:51] fasting for signs and
[25:54] wonders but greater than this is is the
[25:58] ability God has given to
[26:00] you to speak eternal
[26:03] life to the others and that's the
[26:07] prophecy when he says Thou must prophesy
