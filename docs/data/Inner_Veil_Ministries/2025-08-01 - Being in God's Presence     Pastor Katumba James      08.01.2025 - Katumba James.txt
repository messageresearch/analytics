eternal life bless this service Lord speak to our hearts heav father admet all that we have need of we love you Lord and we bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let us go to Isaiah chapter 6 and then we're going to read from verse 1 to verse 8 praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says in the year that King uz died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and above it stood The Sims each one had six wings with TR he covered his face and with TR he covered his feet and with TR he did fly [Music] and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the D moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I what is me for I'm undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king of the king the Lord of hosts then f one of the cims unto me having a life call in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar and laid it upon my mouth and said Lord this has touched your lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is I also heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me word so I want to preach on the subject being in God's presence praise the name of the Lord being in God's presence and we can see from the story in the Book of Genesis that when When sin came man ran away from the presence of God and it is always sin that makes people run away from the presence of God it is always SE that makes people lose a prayerful life it is always sin that makes people lose interest in reading the word of God it is always SE that makes not wanting to come to church When sin comes people don't want to be in the presence of when Adam and Eve ate of the fruit and then they heard the voice of God Walk In The Garden of the Bible says they hid themselves in the trees say that they are not sin that was the condition of sin because when God when God reached at the meeting place he said wondering where are these people called where are you and then he he confessed we are hidden here because we are naked we are afraid and that's normally what sin does it takes people away from the presence of God sin will even make people not want talk about God or if they are talking about God it's about judgment oh how terrible God is when such a person gets a problem they want to God for what they are going through then you know that they are far away from God and that's what sin does you know just choose the other praise the name of our Lord but you see we want to see how can we always be in the presence of how can you keep your life in constant presence of God at home you're in the continuous presence of God at a place of work you're in the continuous presence of God even when you're a B in the continuous presence of even when you at maybe in the tax traveling somewhere you in the continuous presence of God maybe you are driving you're in the continuous presence of God even in the marketplace where there is a lot of confusion and noise the other comes with this the other one comes with that the other one comes with this you can keep the presence of God in your life even when you're in those funny places praise the name of our Lord you can keep the presence of God you know David said that even if I lay my my bed in hell I will find the presence of God praise the name of our you know that you are not scared wherever you are because you know the presence of gods inside of praise the name of our Lord and that should always be our desire am I in the presence of God praise the name of our are you dwelling in the presence of God praise the name of our Lord now in the message influence he says he says everybody just thinks he so secured they don't reverent God like they should why why do they do this because they are not conscious of his presence they are not conscious you know somebody can come and talk to you words which you feel they are not worth talking they not cons can do anything they have no shame praise the name of the Lord so they are not conscious of the presence of God that's the reason people do that they don't recognize it they can't they can't comprehend that they are in the presence of God their minds become so perverted and taken up in the things of the world till they don't even pay any attention to it they go to church sure but realize that they you are in the presence of God they says they go to church but to realize that you are in the presence of God says not only in a church but wherever you are you are in the presence of God praise the name of our Lord so we need to be conscious when I'm at my place of work I need to be conscious I have the presence of God there when I'm at school I need to be conscious the presence of God is there when I'm doing my business when I'm in my garden when I'm at home or when I'm in my bed I need to be conscious that I'm in in the presence of God so when I'm in my bed maybe that's around midnight 2m. a. everyone is sleeping then you start watching dir things hearing dir things you're not conscious about God's presence because you feel that now I can do the dirty things but we need to be conscious about the presence of God all the time in our lives and wherever we are in whatever we are doing we need to be conscious about the presence of God and now in the message the proof of his resurrection he was talking about those people on the road to ous I think we can go to Luke chap 24 then we can get back to that quot praise the name of our Lord Luke 24 the scripture says and behold two of them went that same day to a Village called imos which was from Jerusalem about three SC Falls and they talk together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and they said unto and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and ass and one of them said whose name was cleopas answering and said unto him him at TH the only Stranger in Jerusalem that has not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people now you see they were talking about Jesus Christ and now when they were talking about Jesus Christ you know talking a convers know talking this has happened how expect to be Messiah to be the Redeemer to Deliver Us from the Romans but have killed him and now all disciples are scattered they were talking about him and now when they continue talking about Jesus then Jesus Christ appeared praise the name of the Lord and then brother Bram says the message the proof of his resurrection the conversation was right they were talking about him that is when he appeared and that's the reason he doesn't appear to so many of us today our conversations is talking about everything else and not Christ we are always talking about when we are going to get the work done or what we are going to do here let your conversations be on Christ that's when he appears is when you talk about him be speaking about him and you know that's that's the principle even in the spirit world Spirits when you start talking about any Spirit it comes close any Spirit when you start talking about witches they know you are you are inciting the Demons of which to just come around and the more you continue talking about them is the more they take a hold of you you start fearing even something which start Imaging maybe is the one and then at night you dream about that's the principle these people who go and start enchanting they start praising their Spirits then you start seeing them landing on One landing on anothering on another and then they start in communion with the spirit because they know how to start calling those spirits to come calling their names calling what it's just like us somebody calls your name you'll turn and say who is this then you also start calling the name of a demon why you invite the and but you see there are people who just like that kind of conversation when they talk about something that's not right those demons just come you are worshiping them you are opening channels for them and so they give you more imagination and then you get yourself you are lost in the world of Dem so when we talk about Christ he appears like here they were on the road to and then they started talking about Christ and when they talked about Christ Christ came there and he appeared praise the name of our Lord we can also have the presence of God in our Liv when we talk about God praise the name of our Lord talk about God wherever you're going in whatever you're doing testify about the goodness of the Lord and then you'll see the presence of God coming down praise the name of our Lord I believe let us go to Deuteronomy chapter 6 praise the name of our lordy and then we read from verse let me pick the verse here Deuteronomy chapter 6 and then verse he says and these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart it says they shall be in your hearts they have to be in your heart permanently so you can think about you can meditate about you can talk about them praise the name of there in your heart and the Bible says the mouth speaketh from the abundance now you find out what you like talking about praise the name of know there some places of work maybe mechanics when a woman passes where they are repairing from then they start talking about women all those elting their motivation is making obene words when they are pulling the PO making that you know kind of different places you go maybe to a salon there also a conversation that is there you go to a drinking place there also conversations are there they have dir in their hearts it comes out of their now the Bible is telling us that the word of God should always be in our heart praise the name of our Lord the word of God should be such a great resource in our heart let us go to Psalms 119 and then verse 11 praise the name of our Lord Psalms 119 verse Psalms 119 verse1 he says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I may not sin against praise the name that should be the same issue we should have have that depos of the word you know deposit it in your heart keep on feeding on the word daily keep on meditating upon the word of God daily I have hid your word in my heart that I may not sin against you and you know the devil fights us so much that in your heart there's no word of God the devil fights that so much because he knows if the word of God is not in your heart that word of God can never transform you the word of God can never influence you it can't change your soul it can't change your spe is not in the heart so Satan fights the word from coming to the heart that's what the scripture tells us let us go to Matthew 13 praise the name of our Lord MTH 13 and then the Bible says verse four and when the and when he sold seed some fell by the wayside and the Falls came and died them up so he says the seed was sown but then it fell on the West Side a heart that is not concerned so the devil comes and steals that seed in verse 19 it says when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understands it not then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which is sown in his heart this is which received the seed by the way so we shouldn't allow our hearts to be a because you the devil has access he comes and steals the word praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says we shouldn't be a forgetful hearers you've heard the word but then the following day you are doing the same thing that shows the word is not in the Satan has C it away when we hear the word of we need to mix faith in that word we have received it doesn't matter what your condition is praise the name of our Lord and then you say Lord I have your we need to be like Isaiah when Isaiah got into the presence of God and then he saw the sarapin crying holy that was a gospel he saw saying God You Are Holy You Are Holy and that's the gospel we also hear the word of God Isaiah came to his senses he realized that he was a man of unlean lips and he said oh I'm a man of unclean lips in other words he was saying Lord have mercy upon help me this condition I'm In Praise the name of should be ourselves you know you don't hide your weaknesses before God but then confess them and said Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my failure is where I need help praise the name of Lord then you see the help of God coming and then you see those chains being broken praise the name of the Lord the Lord comes and delivers you when you get into the presence of God when you come into the service like now you need to realize your weaknesses and when you realize your weaknesses that's a time to say Lord I need help in this area Lord I need to be delivered in this area like Isaiah he cried I'm unlean praise the name of our Lord like those lepers who were sitting away from the public when they saw the Lord Christ himself then they CED we unan what did he tell them be made whole praise the name of our and that's what the presence of God does to us when you know the priest Joshua the high priest in Zaria chapter 3 now you can imagine the high priest in this kind of condition go to zarter 3 and then verse one he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right res can you imagine this is the high priest is meant to be the most holy man upon the whole earth is the man who at for the sins of the whole world he goes in the holy of holies once in a year and then offers sacrifices and inters for Mercy all the people and then you see his condition the Bible says he was standing before the angel of the Lord as he stood before the angel Satan also stood on his right hand and right hand means Authority it means power in other words Satan was resisting Satan was hindering him he was preventing him he was refusing him he was pulling him back and there are some people come into the presence of God and the devil keeps on resisting them through the service you're not meant to be here for you know they not talking about for you you are off or on the other hand the devil does has come for you and then now you say but why is talking about a demon don't own that demon praise the name of just reject it and say Lord I want your deliverance Lord I need to be helped the devil is so even at homes when the husband and wife disagree and then you have not resoled it or even if you have resolved it but if one of them makes a mistake then the spirit comes you see you see this is what I was even telling I was telling you and then the devil starts preaching to you and then you get back in difference now Satan was resisting the high priest and then the scripture says and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke you oh Satan even the Lord that has chosen Jalem reuk you is not this a brand pled out of the fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel praise the name of a high priest F gar but stood before the presence of he needed to be helped he needed to be the same thing with us we need to be helped we need to be delivered so you don't run away from the presence of you just come before the Lord Lord I wanton stand before you make me clean make me whole deliver me from my weaknesses deliver me from my weaknesses deliver me from my failures that's what Joshua was standing there and when Joshua stood there then he was made clean praise the name of our Lord and when we come to the presence of God that's what we should always desire Lord make me clean Lord make me when Adam and Eve got into the presence of God of course they had run away from God God went to them and they had made themselves fig leaves but the Fig which is religion would not take away their iniquity would not take away their nakedness that's why they were in the leaves in the trees hiding themselves but you can't hide yourself from God so the best thing is you come to the Lord Lord Here I Am Lord I'm unan Lord Wash Me In the Blood of Jesus deliver me from this kind of scenario Lord make me and when the Lord was was with Adam and Eve he had the solution he had to SL an animal praise the name of the and the blood of the animal covered their sin and then he dressed them in the ship skin and their nakedness was not there praise the name of our Lord so now we see also that in the vision of Isaiah he saw the sarim flying and crying holy holy and the Bible says two Wings covered the face and the wings that covered the face they meant reverence reverencing God we can't look at your face had never seen they were holy sarapin they cover their faces wouldn't exactly see the presence of God and they were flying holy and then two Wings covered their feet which meant humility they were humble before the presence of God they feared the presence of God and then they humbled themselves and then the two wings were flying which meant service praise the name of so they were covered praise the name of the Lord now in the message influence he says let us think them two Wings he had over his face in the presence of God and secondly two weeks over his feet what was it humility third he f with them up himself in action then covered his face in reverence two Wings covered his in humility was in action what was he doing he was showing the pro by this he was showing the prophet how he pre his prepared servants must be God prepared service must be rever humble and in action if you uncover yourself uncover your feet your action isn't going to do no good because you are steered wrong it all to guide you R humble and in action that's what God wants his Pentecostal group to be for God wants his church to be in action praise the name of and you know when they in the presence of God they covered their faces they covered their feet and then he says in paragraph 126 you say well brother Bram you just said they were provided with two wings and you are provided with something too the blood of Jesus Christ that is your [Music] covering you don't stand as a you don't stand as a you don't stand as an angel but you stand as a redeemed son or daughter of God by this by his blood you don't have to have these wings that they had there are a special covering for them in in that presence but you got the blood of Jesus Christ for a covering to stand there now if you've got that blood then you honor God you love God you respect God and God is the word praise the name of our Lord so when we want to get into the presence of God we need to be in the blood of Jesus and when we in the blood of Jesus Christ all our unrighteousness all our sin all our trespasses all our imperfection is all taken care of by the blood of Jesus praise the name of our and the blood of Jesus Christ is the bleeding word of God so David say I have put your word I've hid your word in my heart that I may not sin and the Bible says the word should be in our hearts now when the word is in our you will not sin and sin is unbelief praise the name of the Lord so when the word is in your heart then you need to have faith in that word praise the name of and when you have faith in the word and the word is in your heart praise the name of our lord it's not difficult for you to be in the presence of God think about the word you'll get in the presence of God upon the word you get in the presence of God praise the name of our lord it's not difficult praise the name of our Lord even when you are alone at home you can swich yourself into the presence of God it's not difficult praise the name of right now we are under the New Testament and the New Testament is the blood of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament they had a place God had chosen for worship there's a place that God had selected where his presence was so they would travel long distances to go to that place but right now the Bible tell in joh verse 24 and 25 can go and read that scripture praise the name of our Lord John 4 and then verse let us start from verse 23 let us start from verse 21 to give us a good backround he says Jesus said unto her believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the father that was the Old Testament but says the time is coming and says now is the time not going to the Temple Mount not only waiting on Sunday not waiting only when the church is open but even where you are you can bring down the presence of praise the name of our Lord verse 22 you worship ye not what you know we know what we worship salvation is of the Jews come and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such toship him is a spirit and they that worship God must worship Him spirit and in truth praise the name of our Lord that's how the Lord seeketh us toship that we may worship him in the spirit and in the truth which is Spirit the holy spirit in the truth what is truth Thy word is truth so he wants us to worship him in the spirit and in the words praise the name of our Lord the two pens that Christ gave to the inkeeper so when we come to church and the word of God is ministered we are receiving the spirit and the word praise the name of our Lord you receiving both of them the spirit and the word and so it is a resource it is so now you receive it you put it in your heart praise the name of and then it will bring life praise the name of our Lord it will bring the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord when you have you allow the Holy Spirit to have charge over your heart then the holy spirit in your heart will take over all your thinking praise the name of he will take charge over your mind you will not allow evil thoughts you know you reject them somebody does you something and then the demon of hatred comes manyon possessed so when you H another person your demon possess demon of hatred so now the demons the demon of hatred comes why is done this hate him but when the Holy Ghost is there say Lord forgive him praise the name of the Lord so it keeps pushing the sin away why because the presence of God is right inside so keeps on pushing that out he pushes Darkness out praise the name of so we can live in the presence of God continuously praise the name of continuously praise the name of our Lord you don't say this m has been a bad M for me I don't know when we are going to go back to church you don't need that once the presence of God is there it will keep you through Monday keep you through Tuesday on Wednesday you in church praise the name of our Lord then after church you know it's just like it's just like a station praise the name of like if you ride a motorcycle if you ride a car if you drive a car there are stations along the path P stations so you can drive you say this one will take me up to now in you get their station then you can refill then you continue you refill then you continue There are stations along the path they refreshing points along the path where you rest you relax or maybe along the way there are residential places say I think the night is first spent then you rest that's the journey we are on praise the name of and the church is a station the time is the journey you have of Monday Tuesday then Wednesday evening you get into the station you reach a place where the station is that's Wednesday evening come and but there are those who just run through the week and then you find the fuel is over on THS is falling in this thing is falling in this thing by the time he comes back where the station is is's having many stitches either broken limb or eyes out not seeing properly you get it but God has put these things there that we can on on the on the Journey of time we have times of fellowship and even at your home you can have a small station there in the morning you start by refilling reading the word of God praying unto God upon the word of God then you start your journey the first Kil is the first hour then second K the second you see even when you eat at home in The Breakfast you mean you're not going to eat lunch what you've eaten in the morning is it enough but you even planned I think I'm going to go to the other house of snacks to eat my lunch should also be the same thing praise the name of our Lord should be the same thing spiritually I've started in the morning by refilling I've prayed I've read the word of God meditating upon it and then when you get busy at place of work there are some kind of breakdowns that can come the vehicles the pressure may go down but you have a spare tire so you you'll continue moving you change and continue moving of work you can have aome client abusing you so what do you do do you abuse back so if there's no Reserve you end up fighting tell him don't come back here but when you have that power of God within you you become praise the name of the Lord you'll know what to do at the challenge which comes along because you are refilled praise the name of there's a life working within you and then you see you have overcome that and then your colleagues if that one came to me I would have beaten them like we he what happened sometimes in where the permanent secretary the one who Ministry was fighting an officer fing you know they don't have that kind of temperance they don't have the virtue you know the virtue of character that you know if somebody abuses me Let Me Be Me allow to be abused and the world say you are foolish but you have overcome that SP praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we have the word of God right inside of us wherever we are praise the name of our Lord let us continue I see my time is running out let us go to Psalm 168 praise the name of our Lord Psalm 168 so the scripture says I have set the lord always before me because he's at my right hand I shall not be moved praise the name of our lord said I've set God before me and when you have set the Lord before you it will change your thinking it will change your actions praise the name of our Lord when we are in the presence of God he changes Us Praise the name of our Lord you know anything you have provoked into you put the Lord there and the sin that comes along the way praise the name of in the message his presence he says he knows all things he knows your heart and you know what you are think he knows what you are thinking he does if there's a little sin hanging on you tonight and you don't want to go in the presence of God with that on you would you just once raise your hand and say brother pray for me I want to be in his presence at that day Guiltless then he says it might be it says do like David did put the Lord before you right now the Lord between you and that whatever that little besting scene is it might be lying it might be stealing it might be evil thinking it might be temper it might be drinking it might be smoking it might be gambling I don't know what it might be last it might be anything I don't know what it is whatever it is put the Lord before you and then your heart will rejoice and your flesh will rest in Hop for you know what Christ promised he willink when he comes forth will come in his like in his likeness praise the name of now in parag 10 he says now do you believe you have placed the Lord between you and your sin between you and your sickness between you and your fault between you and your ways the Lord is always before me and I'm in his presence praise the name of the Lord the next time I start light a cigarette the Lord is before me the next time I start to last the Lord is before me the next time I I start to tell anything wrong the Lord is before me the next time I start to say bad thing the Lord is before me and I shall not be M amen I will live in his presence each day with my dealings each day with my talk I'll walk as if the Lord is before me because tonight I put him before me and I shall not be mise the name of so it's you to decide to be in the presence of God praise the name of but you need to decide where I live I'm going to be in the presence of God praise the name of the Lord where I walk I'm going to be in the presence of wherever I will be I'll put the Lord before me praise the name of our while the others are listening to secular music I'll put the Lord between me and that music praise the name of our Lord I'll put the Lord between me and anything evil whever I will be I put the Lord before me praise the name of our and then you'll maintain the presence of God in your life and when we are in the presence of God we are changed that's what the presence of God does the presence of God changes us it changes your thinking it changes your desires it changes your Ambitions it changes the things you Chas after you know the things of the world they have no limit they have no limit but yet you can't have everything you can't you can't own everything that there is by the time you say I'm stretching
