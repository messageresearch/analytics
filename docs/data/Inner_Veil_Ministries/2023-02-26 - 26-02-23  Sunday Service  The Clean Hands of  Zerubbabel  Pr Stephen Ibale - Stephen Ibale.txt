and broken [Music] you know you know [Music] foreign [Music] crystals amen Amina so let's just stand up how to immediately and get into the scripture reading we shall go to the book of Zechariah Chapter 4. and we read verse 9. before we do [Music] prayers precious Heavenly Father each time we come before your presence our hearts begin to burn within us there's a holy fire of the Holy Spirit of all the vessels of god father we come before you die recognizing your goodness love and mercy knowing that father dear Lord God as the fly of the Holy Spirit bans within us we are living in the most wicked time of history but Heavenly Father you are calling every one of your children to come out of the cosmos the conditions of this world so that we can come into Christ and we pray that you may open your door as you speak to us saying we are your children we want to walk under your guidance under your instructions and the teaching of the world therefore father we commit the word we are going to read into your hands 75 so you are really welcome into his presence amen so let's turn to the scripture here Zechariah Chapter 4 verse 9. the hands I've laid the foundation of this house he was talking about the restaurant Tabernacle after the return of Israel from Babylon yeah also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you amen amen may the Lord that blessing the reading of his word so today we want to deal with the subject s amen the Clean Hands [Music] if you want anything clean you have to wash it now so the hands of zeruba they were watched as well he says the foundation of this house deals with the grace for adults for Israel to come out of their captivity to restore the temple that had been broken down and the same Grace pour us out for them in the time of the return from the dispersion amen so it's a compound scripture amen it's so compounds that it also deals with us Amen in the return of the theological uh captivity in the mystery Babylon so you know this is a compound scripture amen and so we deal with ourselves in this dispensation of Grace so this position is God releasing something special in the midst of what he's already doing with the people that while God is doing this he brought something in boom to run for a period of time amen and now that period of time where God is dealing with something new he has dropped into what he's already doing like the book of Acts whether we see the dispensation of Grace for the Gentiles being highlighted he's doing something among the Jews but because they lost the enthusiasm that the word produces gospel literally turns to the Gentiles that's what God does don't and when the gospel came among the Gentiles the moving of this new work is referred to as the dispensation of Grace so there was a turning point took out the benefits of Grace [Music] [Music] the glory foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] at this present time there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace you find the Jew here Believe In Christ [Music] I mean the major church it's Gentiles so now as Gentiles we have been grafted into the promises we are God's major focus and we must learn how to tap into this blessings while we have the crossing of the hands of Jacob that we don't know amen you remember when uh you know uh Joseph took the boys to be blessed everyone [Music] he brought the bigger on the right and the younger on the left but when he was blessing them he crossed the hands and Jacob says this is the order oh no no foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] by rejecting the uh Ministry of Jeremiah the prophet we find that they fell into Babylon because so you know Israel is the church natural then you know Church in the New Testament is the church spiritual Israel Israeli these are you know Shadows but the reality is down here how they fall was the shadows of how the New Testament Church [Music] amen that when the church falls it would fall also into a Babylon conditions amen and it's Paul who said according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise Master Builders I've learned the foundation and another building amen so while the church moves [Music] amen because means you know the seat of Satan that's where the devil was outstanding to take the church into captivity are you together with me [Music] which was during the program that the revelation of the openness they rejected foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but the same way Israel is brought back to rebuild in the temple and also they are brought back everybody listen from and even as they are brought back Amen to rebuild the back of the nation of Israeli is the same way the church is called by the message of Malachi 4. to building the world's best church and it's at this time [Music] amen says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise I have learned the foundation [Music] to continue on the foundation amen amen because Paul well Paul was the Apostle to the Gentiles was an apostle to the Hebrews amen amen praise the Lord are you here with me today amen so when you look at Moses amen amen I'm putting a lot of things together but you are going to see how it opens up for you when you look at Moses he built the ark yes [Music] and set up the veil of the covering and covered the Ark of the testimony as the Lord commanded Moses [Music] and a cloud covered in the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord [Music] amen amen each time the ark is brought into the Tabernacle is the glory of the Lord comes down among the people when the ark is taken away from the tablet went away from here the glory of the Lord departed from the people when Moses finished building [Music] the glory of the Lord when David finished the glory of God are you together when Solomon finished the glory of God came down even in the [Music] so when the church [Music] therefore the restoration brings the glory back into the house is that actually one number and that's why before the opening of the seventh seeds brother Brandon preached two special messages [Music] and in those two messages [Music] one which is not built with hands [Music] is the Bride of Jesus Christ [Music] amen amen and then God gives him the Revelation which is the revelation [Music] [Music] [Music] Miracles can [Music] once you know the ark is in the Tabernacles when the glory of God is and we thank God the opening of The Seven Seals God was rest over here which is not built by hearts that you are the temp of God and that the spirit of God the glory of God amen amen praise the Lord amen so we thank God we just need to come out of work to come out of the Fallen religious system back into the apostolic Foundation back to the teaching of the true God manifesting the body of foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] now verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is awakened out of sleep [Music] now when Israel was in captivity are you together with me when Israel was in captivity they were like dry bones in the valley it was a sleeping Church [Music] that's what you know uh Zechariah is saying in chapter 4 verse 1. the other they were looking at a church and working into my time out of the valley of dry bones we saw how is rice brought well and restored as a mighty Nations [Music] I was awakened us to out of sleep and was posted amen into the eye Edge he says as a man that's awakened out of sleep when you're sleeping you got closer when you awake you brought your eyes open when the church was in the valley of the Babylonians [Music] and I will show you are you together with me so where are we we are in the I8 God going to show us things that we have never known even known about yourself do you know that you are Justified like you've never done it before do you know that as the word is being told you are being Sanctified do you know that you are filled constantly or they try to say what would they do you know that there is a person who walks with you the person of the Lord he says I'll show you things at a higher level that you've never known before amen Zechariah awakened out of sleep [Music] then he was asked [Music] [Music] you've gone through things you cannot even describe God was dealing with you to build you into pure golden candlesticks and fill you with Glory of his oil of his anointing of his spirit that you may shine to this whatever [Music] [Music] with a bowel upon the top of it and he's seven lamps they are wrong and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top of it is by it then is [Music] [Music] spoke to the angel that talked with me saying what are these this is [Music] say that you don't come here that I mean Caleb praise the Lord and another maybe Peter comes I want to literally show you what this is a strong man I want you to do this and then I want you to put your hand here and you come this way now with the this is the golden candlestick okay so this golden candlesticks it has got two trees one on this side and one on this side and it has got some kind of a way these two connect to this and now there are seven candles only these are two here amen I mean there are some others you are not seeing but they are supposed to be seven wedding amen Amina so now this Olive Tree here they push their oil into this vessel here they say they come after that damage and this one into this vessel so then this lamp stand golden lamp stands is the church but the church is getting oil after from the old and the New Testament the total obedience to the word foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that's why we sing and say Babylon is falling [Music] amen amen what are these and little in the New Testament Church that behind all this standing the Lord Jesus Christ in the protection of his church [Music] he stood behind us whenever the ant cross was trying to come there was coming a voice come and see [Music] [Music] [Music] so now [Music] [Music] he cannot make it he cannot overcome he cannot wrestle at the time Hallelujah you cannot win the forces of this time you cannot win this sodomite conditions there must be a supernatural power there is not by your mind by your spirit which comes by you studying the world amen Amina we cannot overcome this condition a young man just wakes up one morning and he says I've discovered I'm a boy I mean I am a girl so you Pirates got it parents do one thing teach your children to be girls let them appreciate having a dress let them not have that mind but the Mercy Clinic teach them who they are let not somebody take cover the mind of your children [Music] yeah praise the lord we need to completely walk away from this baby not by changing churches to think different from the world let your children be proud of what they believe amen Amina that will establish them that will help them overcome all those those oncoming storms amen amen God awakes Zechariah that not by power not by Max but by my spirit let the spirit of God dwell in our house amen amen speak about God teach your children let them know the world foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just despise what God is doing don't despise what God is doing respect whatever God is doing land respects this message doesn't matter how small it has been given if it came from the message [Music] that day of small things [Music] amen Amina for they shall rejoice and shall see the planet in the hands we don't serve it they are the eyes of the Lord which ran to and fro through the world now while the temple was a heap of rings the victor of Israeli was in the planets foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so Zechariah says that's the whole thing is a heap of rings he says hi Canada could stand here if that was the sport singers and God ordained it is you can look at yourself foreign [Music] who was holding the Seven Stars in his heart again my soul The Eyes Of God amen amen so you know there is such a similarity between that and this because amen Amina the way they were able to restore back at that Temple is the way God is going to help you started and become one of the values the Bright Tree are you together with me you are going to become one of the precious thoughts in the building Amina [Music] he says then the angel that talked with me answer them say that to me no one's thou not what this being and I said no my Lord he was just to see yeah foreign [Music] this is the word of the Lord that is [Music] but by my spirit says the Lord are you together with me God is speaking to the rubber band and he was speaking three minutes he was telling him again to overcome in the Old and New Testament and out of the older New Testament comes the spoken word message [Music] amen Amina brother Branham says here's another lamp of pure God you know it's Burning Brightly because it has plenty of oil which it is getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side the two trees represent the Old and New Testament and of course the oil who alone can give the light of God to the people the Angels it was as much as saying this is what this what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own nights and how will you get the holy ghosts amen you must be connected to the vines you must be a student of the world Amen you must be in your Bible you must bring your message are you together with me that's the only way we are going to be patch of this Great temple [Music] the lamp was lit in a special way first the priest took the fire from the sacred out which was originally lighted by the fire of God first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the power he then listen he then lit the second lamp from the flame on the first line received this fire from the second life as did in the force receive this from the farm until all the seven lamps being passed from lamp to Lamps it was a wonderful time of the holy spirit in the seventh Church the original outpouring of Pentacles without pouring come direct from Jesus on the Master Seat is enduring his first his church [Music] amen through all the seven churches and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever the never-changing god somebody says [Music] the lamp was being lit yes they would go to the Holy Father then they would get the fire light the lamp which was the red clone the power yeah they didn't go back to go and get the fire again are you together so they get from that condo whatever you don't go back to the holy spirit because these two candles are you together [Music] amen that's the way God works the first five amen which was the church [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] when another brother comes it all gone all the way down he wants to watch you can see what influence I wish nobody all the fire influence and he also becomes another character and then we keep lighting one another by the grace of God Amen Amina praise the Lord the glory of the sovereign Uganda to call me today amen because it has been posted amen Amina so verse 7. before and this shall bring forth The Headstone with shouting Grace Grace Sanctuary you see when they were coming home the man of the land we're very Furious and they were more King Israel will they be able to raise this church [Music] oh it is [Music] and then the holy spirit says [Music] [Music] but nothing I ever can stand against the holy spirit amen amen that's what you should always tell your enemies I might look feeble in is but the one who is inside somebody says [Music] amen so the hands let the foundation and finishes foreign [Music] foreign amen amen and the Elders of the Jews builded and they prophesied through the prophesying of haggai the prophet Nabi and Zechariah the son of video and finished it according to the Commandment of the god of Israel according to the Commandment of Cyrus and Darius Texas foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] God wants you to find your position in the body and you become the killing hands of the Republic [Music] amen amen the work of Moses was to keep working hands guided in a patterns so I wanted to look at Moses and the Christ the question under the same formation [Music] and I want you to see that you are those hands that finishes you've got your part to do God is depending on you in the finishing of the tapana amen amen look at the people that were here on Friday night and they were praying amen amen those are hands they are participating but whatever in the construction of the temple because they are in prayer they are pleading to God help the pastor yeah amen Amina no God told the Moses foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] when you put your knees down there at home and you are praying for the service and you are saying Lord speak to the pastor is going to speak to us this morning when you are praying of the condition in the Church of the condition in the brother's life together [Music] amen amen Exodus 35 21. Nevada now they are speaking about Moses Moses but in that position the people participated amen amen and they came everyone whose heart studies and everyone whom is and for this service and for Holy garments and they came both men and women as many as we're reading hearted foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] are you together with it one is it sanctify yourself for service you see the people were part of Moses Vision as you are a part of the message vision and the work in this local church God has called you to participate the vision is given to uh foreign [Music] [Music] amen amen the vision to this generation does not involve brother Brandon Malone like the vision of Moses Moses couldn't bring it to pass alone after he had learned the foundation that was given to Malachi now amen Amina when Moses saw the Tabernacle he saw the New Jerusalem coming from Heaven had the chords of that City represented in what he did yes because when the rubber Souls a Victorious nation of Israel we were younger yesterday raising the Tabernacles and in its weakness he showed them the vision of the counter Street two olive trees when God wanted Moses to build this Tabernacles after the order of what he had received he saw a New Jerusalem coming down from heaven and when it begins all those things that he did requests the codes [Music] of the New Testament the new Tabernacles so you are a part of what God is doing that makes you a builder a museum that makes you yes turn around and tell your brothers we have something to do we are part of what God is doing we don't come here that we don't know to enjoy the vision of the people come down here [Music] [Music] we walk that Highway [Music] amen amen because he already saw you as part of the stones in the construction of the house of God yes how it works and you are here because you were there you cannot be stories [Music] you must be part of the costume are you together with me you have to be part of that construction material that's why when you are trying to staggeration the holy spirit says [Music] he says you are dealing with a special house you clean your hands amen praise God so we come here that we don't know and we come to the washing Waters [Music] to keep washing our hearts as we are part of the construction of the turbanon amen mothers needed giving people as he needed the people that had grace to the furniture for the Tabernacle okay foreign [Music] [Music] amen amen look at Exodus 31 2. see I have called below no sorry see I have called by name the son of Yuri the son of rule of the tribe of Judah I have called by name amen amen and you know a name speaks of character amen Amina you remember when the mothers were giving birth to the probe Patriots they were crying a certain way [Music] so when the time to take possession came during Joshua Joshua went back to the names that were reflecting the characters amen Amina and she was called Sarah because God had ordained house [Music] which means a priest with God names kept changing and when he says I called by name is meaning that I have gifted him Brothers I have called by name means I have installed certain abilities the name speaks of designation calling our blessings [Music] uh are you together with him Brian is it see the way God works amen amen God doesn't call it past to make him a deacon okay [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign so that they may make all that I have commanded who wanted to visit Moses who are the craftsmanship the people they become the Clean Hands of the rubber chemical name God had given Moses extra hands amen amen don't you think you come down here just to enjoy the service you've got a part in the construction of this Tabernacle because amen amen the tabernac of the congregation and the Ark of the testimony and all the furniture of the Tabernacles and that's what I say when you are building a house it changes when you come to the window level you do something different you live some walls there holds there when you come you see you turn a corner when you are building a wall depends on how many you know uh uh rooms you have in the house number so when we are building we are not building a wall and it keeps going and building when my return my exam building three miles four miles and beauty those clean hands are gifted hands coming from foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] to make yourself a growing Ministry if you are a preacher be a growing Ministry you don't stay on the same thing you become a growing ministry that's what God wants of us [Music] is working with us [Music] amen Amina let's now go here into the squad is now putting the principles we have exactly the same patterns that's why the light comes through some god-given message in a certain area and then from that messenger they express the light however foreign always okay so the Faithfully thoughts always carrying the message [Music] of course there will be those that will not wait on their ministers but you don't throw away the fight for the ministers so this message is about the body and not just knowledge amen amen saying that I'll stay home and I will read that's what the United States but he was ready but whom was the prophet speaking and the Bible says the men who are Faithfully anointed in the air everybody [Music] to the message [Music] amen amen listen here who is honor questions the nurses of 1963. it was an awkward would the bride of Christ serve the minister before the Rapture yes that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of Christ [Music] consists of Apostles evangelists is that right that's the bride of Christ it will be so humble foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] they are the ministry of the Bride is they are helping hands I mean Moses operated on the principle the fight for the ministry and the continuity of the work of the Holy Ghost he needed 70. [Music] take off his spirit and help him in judging the people meaning that the five-fold ministry comes directly under the anointing of the message now [Music] [Music] there was hands of support [Music] remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded saying the Lord your God has given you rest and has given you this love that's the continuity of anointing it was the hands of Moses he came with the quarks from Moses's message amen so look at the continuity through the scriptures [Music] [Music] and when we ministers [Music] [Music] [Music] what is it son of man Ministry was Christ a prophetic teacher um amen amen then the next name is Son of God the Son of God um is an office that starts at Calvary to the coming of the Lord the Son of God listen Hebrews chapter four verse 14. seeing them that we are the great high priest that is passing to the heavens Jesus yes the Son of God let us hold our profession first when he passes on to the heavens he has taken another office the office of Son of God yes because he's now standing as a high priest the sacrifice was already given yeah somebody say Amen there so the Son of God is Jesus associated with the priesthood the washing of our sins [Music] [Music] because you have to finish he didn't know that was necessary to keep the bride clean and we call it the finished work of cows [Music] are you together with me it hanged on him on the cross [Music] he was what is bothering you now amen Amina Hallelujah and when he was hanging the heavens amen and closed its life as the son of God amen he went down to Hell because that's why I seen Texas but when he gets there together one thing which we need to know is that that was not his seat [Music] is also not young he's got that seat and he gave it back to the devil yeah Hallelujah and he came back Victorious and because of that you are sinless right of the Lord if you believe it myself amen amen yes sir he packed us hallelujah individual's personal faith in a single quick it is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to come back foreign [Music] to sit in the Kingdom because Deputy speaks of the Kingdom amen amen so now listen son of man is what he did before the cross but between uh you know we know that the Bible says Hallelujah that he'll come again a son of David I mean as as your son of man brother so between son of man that woman a woman which he is now charity and the son of David no matter which is going to come back us again he comes back as son of man go man woman like he was in the first coming he comes again as a preaching Prophet before the end when he comes a son of devil are you getting that which means that we expect a prophetic anointing and that Prophet comes by Malachi 4. that's the anointing of Christ himself that's the son of man Ministries so [Music] versatility it is likewise also as it was in the days of Lords [Music] [Applause] they planted they build it Sodom was a prosperous City and the Bible says they also build it are you together with me when is it so he's saying as it was Charlie in the days but the same day that Lord went out of Sodom notary he trained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all yeah foreign [Music] Sonoma businesses [Music] [Music] [Music] amen Amina it's the same Christ the Christ may know but under a prophetic anointing and not him as king so this is used [Music] and this was first spoken by God in the Acts [Music] chapter 3. foreign [Music] amen amen Acts chapter 3 verse 18. but those things which God before had showed by the mouth of All His prophets that question to suffering he has so fulfilled yeah [Music] and this is the time where we are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] which before was prophesied unto you yeah ok Google that is done by his presence in the son of man Ministries and not allow him to come back until after the time of refreshing of all things and this is where we are foreign [Music] [Music] it will also have the continuity 25 40 minutes so the 540 Ministries which are working with Malachi foreign [Music] see this man plowing a straight line amen amen and as we handle this word we keep it as a straight line we give it later amen I remember when Malachi 4 was still here in this person will write this train again foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen Amina praise the Lord God don't ever swear yeah so we are here friends we are trying to work today as the Clean Hands amen amen so you're not the promise of this hour as I've always told you foreign somebody and the rains come and then you saw the land and then when you are going towards the Harvest are you together with him you need the range which formed the corn in the earlier together with me so we need two Reigns and then the Hot August Sun of the Harvest Skyward it's the same thing in the world that we need the former Reigns which is the planting race and now this former range when we take it back into the world is the Revelation that Jesus Christ gives to you passion that's your family [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my God [Music] [Music] I mean flesh and and blood does not revealed this tree but my Father which is [Music] which Foundation the foundation of revelation of Jesus Christ so you are built on the revelation of the world once you get the wax as a personal revelation yes praise the Lord is Blessing the doctrine of the World by anointed so when we come here we are planting seeds foreign [Music] foreign [Music] flags and torrential Ray Amadeus it doesn't help the seats it will just go with the seed and take you to the valley tender Reigns who don't know tender Reigns of teaching and then the people start doing their heads amen I mean then it sinks in there once it sinks and it becomes Revelation no man can pull it out [Music] now you take the word former Auto electricity and look at it and see if the Hebrew word foreign Goes Forth God so but right now iot we are not in this season of the former rain alone but we are in the season at the message only of the former yeah that's how interesting it is foreign that's the lottery are gonna mess up then the latter forms the crop and this crop looks like the one which went into the ground is teaching when you start seeing that word Botanical Community bearing life in your life then you know you're receiving latter rain upon the seed that has been planted together with me I'll give you a small example here is Abraham one and Abraham in the plains of mamre with their true life two people life no no sir and Abraham Ibrahim but then when he looks up like this it begins to look from the Oblivion amen amen some thoughts of people coming oh like they are coming from verify and then when he keeps seeing they form themselves like very little doors and then later on he says they are people and then when they keep coming closer he starts to feel a magnetic power America that is not useful he says this is not men that's God he had come with the two angels trapped in the board of Flesh came to Abraham and told Abraham your wife [Music] that was a shock but that is foreign nobody saw him so the lottery is the holy spirit giving life to ever the promise of the world amen amen you are not even going to feel him but he'll be around to give rather a promise which has given in the world are you together it's the Holy Spirit when
