are gathered in your name you will be there in their midst and Lord we believe you are here in our midst so we call upon your name you come and speak to us father you come and reveal yourself to us Lord and likewise Lord May every need of your children and you may answer every need we are depending upon you Lord Jesus bless us all together Lord touch those who are weak give them strength Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus us amen amen let us go to John 14 we're reading from verse we're reading verse 26 only John Chapter 14 verse 26 it says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you may God blessing word you may be seated I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you're welcome for this service so I want to preach on the subject the Holy Ghost is the inside teacher praise the name of our Lord so we see the Bible is telling us that when the Holy Ghost is come he will teach us all things and not only teaching us but also bring all things bring all things to our remembrance whatsoever the Lord has said praise the name of our Lord and you see the Holy Ghost as we've always said it is the holy ghost that teaches you the word it is the holy ghost that brings conviction to Your Heart Like You know the first time you heard about the Gospel of Jesus Christ it was the Holy Spirit through the voice you were hearing that brought that word to you and that word brought conviction praise the name of our Lord it was the spirit using that person or using that voice or using the text you read you know to bring conviction to you praise the name of our Lord and so the Holy Ghost LED you into justification when you repented of your sins it was the spirit of God telling you that you were wrong it was the spirit of God telling you that you need to repent and it was the spirit of God praise the name of our Lord that enabled you to receive the water baptism praise the name of our Lord you wouldn't start the journey by yourself but it had to be the spirit that called you and then you see that the spirit keeps on speaking to you through the word and now as you continue on obeying the word then the spirit sanctifies you the spirit washes away all your unrighteousness through believing the word because that's why the Bible says sanctify them by thy truth Thy word is truth so it was the Holy Ghost that justifies you it is the holy ghost that sanctifies you praise the name of our Lord because like last time we were looking at it that the blood speaks praise the name of our Lord and what does the blood speak we can go get some of this spot praise the name of our Lord in the the message token it says now we find we also find in Hebrews 1224 that the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word the word is identified by the voice of the blood and the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and brings life to the word and quickens it so we see it's now the holy ghost that has has been speaking to you and whenever you've been hearing the word of God you are obeying the Holy Spirit you were obeying what the Holy Ghost was teaching praise the name of our Lord and you see the Bible also tells us in John 1526 John 15:26 it says but but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceeds from the father he shall testify of me testifying shall speak of Christ you shall speak the word of Christ so you see it is always the Hol spirit that has been speaking to us through the word of God praise the name of our Lord so when you are talking about the Holy Spirit you're not talking about something so mysterious you're not talking about something that is far away but you are talking about the holy spirit that has already been given and you're talking about the Holy Ghost that always speaks to praise the name of our Lord we're not talking about something so far oh we not talking about something it's only the other Church which has the spirit only the other minister has the spirit we are talking about where the true word of God is preached it is the spirit that preaches praise the name of our Lord and so if you can obey that word then the Holy Spirit himself will take you through what he wants to take you and then he brings you to Perfection praise the name of our Lord so then we need to hear what the spirit says when you go in the Book of Revelation praise the name of our Lord The Book of Revelation and then we go to chapter two Revelation Chapter 2 and let us read in verse S he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God you see in verse seven he saying Le that has an ear let what the spirit says to the churches but then who was speaking this in verse chapter 1 verse 19 it says write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter in verse 17 he introduces himself and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is saying it is Christ who was speaking to John on the aisle of patimos but now when Christ was speaking to John he says it is the spirit praise the name of the Lord that speaketh to the churches so the preaching of the word it is the spirit of God that preaches to us that speaks to us praise the name of our Lord so you're not talking about the Holy Ghost being far away from you but you are talking about the Holy Spirit who always comes and speaks to you speak through through the ministry speak through the preps speak through through the scriptures when you start reading your Bible when you start reading the message book it is the holy spirit that speaks to you praise the name of our Lord the holy ghost that uses the minister it's the holy ghost that speak through the Tex it's the holy ghost that speaks through the scriptures so we are not talking about something that is far from us we are talking about the Holy Spirit coming to speak to us praise the name of now in first Timothy 4 verse 1 the Bible says now the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now see the the spirit is prophesy so is the spirit speaking the spirit is speaking through scriptures praise the name of our Lord the spirit is using the scriptures to speak to us and now when we also go to Peter First Peter chapter 1 and then in verse 11 the Bible says searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow praise the name of the Lord it says even in the Bible in the Old Testament it was actually the holy men of God who were moved by the spirit of Christ and then they did the things under inspiration they spoke things under inspiration it was no longer their mind it was the spirit of God that was moving upon them praise the name of our and wonder the Bible says if we can also go to Second Peter chapter 1 and then verse the Bible says knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture if of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us all the prophets in the bible they were inspired and the Holy Ghost was speaking through them so then we have the Bible written by the Holy Spirit and then we need the same Holy Spirit to reveal to us the word of God we need the same holy spirit that WR the scripture revealed to us like the time you came in interaction with Christ it was the Holy Spirit that convicted you of your sin and then it's the holy spirit that convinced you that you need to repent and give your life the Lord Jesus Christ so the Holy Ghost has been working upon your life from the time you first heard the word of God it has been the Hest praise the name of our Lord taking you through all the different stages now as the Holy Ghost has been working in your lives to bring you to the knowledge of Christ to bring you to the repentance of your to bring you to live the things you are doing which are not right sanctifying you separating you from the evil ways it is still that same holy spirit that wants to fill your heart praise the name of the lord it's not something that is isolated it is a work that has been continuous in your life and so then you the Bible says that began a good work in us he will bring it to Perfection he will bring it to completion so then you need to allow the same holy spirit that has been moving you praise the name of our Lord you can ask yourself is it your own ability that you are still standing today it's not your own ability but it is the ability of God that has given you by his spirit that you are able to stand and confess the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior by the spirit of God it has been by the spirit of God that you have been able to overcome Temptation it has been by the spirit of God that you've been able to live upright it has been by the spirit of God that end and you're still moving on same confession same confidence same Focus the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so don't look at the Holy Ghost as being far away but look at the Holy Ghost as as a a comforter as a companion you know moving along with you teaching you guiding you directing you keeping you encouraging you lifting you up when you are weak praise the name of our Lord that's how you need to look at the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so we see that it was the spirit of God that was teaching us that was guiding us that was instructing Us Praise the name of our now in John chapter 16 and then verse 12 the scripture says I have re many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore I said that he will take of mine and will show it unto you praise the name of our Lord so he says when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide us into all truth and then he will speak in other words he will teach he will preach through the word praise the name of our Lord and now when he speaks to us then he will also show us in other words he will reveal to us the things of God it's the spirit of God it's some it's not your understanding but Christ reveals himself to by the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord you see the will of God you see the plan of God is that he wants the Holy Spirit to take charge over you praise the name of the Lord you start by hearing the preacher and it's the spirit of God using the preacher and now when you receive it and then it stays in your heart you keep on meditating upon it you keep on cherishing it and then you want to hear more and as you keep on hearing more the spirit keeps on revealing himself and as you keep on obeying then the spirit sanctifies you he separates you from your weaknesses he separates you from sin and as you keep on yielding yourself is washing you is taking away things that are contrary to him he's taking away things that hinder him and then finally the same holy spirit that brought you into justification has taken you through sanctification he now fills you with his own self himself dwelling inside of you so it the work of God the Bible says salvation is of the lord we are saved by grace not of our own works praise the name of our Lord so now if you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal savior allow him to take you through all the way just yield yourself to the word of God and then that same word you're yielding will bring you into the image of Jesus Christ will bring the manifestation of the Life of Christ himself right inside of you so now as a Believer or as a person loves God you are called to obey the word of God praise the name of our Lord just say Lord here I am praise the name of our Lord little Samuel he didn't know the voice of God it was not yet revealed to him and then he had the voice Samuel Samuel and he would run to the priest again he had the second time somewh somewhere he R the priest El then knew that it was God speaking to samel praise the name of our Lord you see the beginning of how Samuel started knowing the Lord maybe that's how also we had a beginning with the Lord sometimes not knowing it is the holy spirit speaking to you taking interest in your life Desiring to guide you praise the name of our Lord let us go to the book book of Samuel first Samuel praise the name of our Lord first let me get the scripture chapter 3 and then verse 4 the Bible says the Lord called and he answered here am I verse five and he ran unto Eli and said he am I for th callest me and he said I called not lie down again and he went and lay down and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou did call me and he answered I called not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord and that sometimes also our beginnings that we don't know how the Lord speaks to us we don't know how the spirit teaches us initially you start wondering what is this kind of thing like brother Bram when he would see those Visions it was the Holy Spirit revealing him to himself but then he couldn't know what it was exactly sometimes he would hear the voice do not smoke do not drink do not defile yourself he didn't know that that was the spirit of God but God was taking interest in his life praise the name of our Lord and then God would move him to go to meetings and then he he has the preacher preaching and then he gets concerned he gets convicted that was the beginning the Holy Ghost working upon his life and here also we see that God had started working upon the life of by calling him praise the name of our Lord and each and every one of us has been called by God praise the name of our Lord the first time you had the minister preaching you the gospel that was God calling you praise the name of our Lord Abraham in Genesis 12 the Bible says God called Abraham come out of the land of wool and I show you where you're going praise the name of our Lord look at the Rich Young Ruler when he came to Christ he also had the same calling come and follow me praise the name of our Lord You See It Is God still calling Moses in the before the burning bush it was God revealing himself to Moses calling him come and I send you praise the name of our Lord so Samuel didn't know the voice of God it was not yet revealed to him so the Bible says neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him and the Lord called Samuel the third time arose and went to El and said here am I for th did call me and Al perceived that the Lord that called the child therefore told samel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for thy servant Heth so went and lay in his place and the Lord came and stood and called us at other times Samuel Samuel then samel answered for the thy servant praise the name of our Lord what an interesting thing it is to know that it is the Lord who has called you praise the name of the Lord what an interesting to know that it was the Holy Spirit that started preaching to the P praise the name of our Lord how so interesting it is that even now it is the spirit of God speaking to us praise the name of our Lord that's how so lovely the Lord is to us so the holy spirit is not far away from you the Holy Ghost has been speaking to you all the only thing that you need is to obey the voice of the Holy Spirit and then what the Holy Ghost has been speaking to you will become manifested in your life praise the name of our Lord that's how simple it is if you know that is the holy spirit then obey the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost will perform his purpose in your life it's not something difficult that's why the Bible says he that has my wife and does it it is he that love me and he that loveth me I will come and make my in him that's what the Holy Ghost is saying hear his word obey his word and he comes into your heart he settles into your heart praise the name of our Lord it's not difficult to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit it is as simple as that he the spirit the spirit and the spirit comes down praise the name of our Lord so that's what we see Samuel here he did not the voice initially but now when it was revealed to him that it was the Lord he said Lord speak praise the name of our Lord and now we also need to hear the voice of the spirit we need to hear the word of God why does the word of God speak why does the word of God teach us praise the name of our Lord now in the message the church age he says the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is is talking yes the spirit is teaching how does the spirit talk how does the spirit teach it uses through the ministers it teaches us through the scriptures through the TS when you take your time and then you meditate upon the word the word of God it is the spirit of God that speaks to you then he says that is exactly what Jesus said that he would do when he came John 1426 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your reme whatsoever I have said unto you and that is just what happen that is how the gospels were written these men had recalled to their minds by the Holy Ghost the very words that Jesus spoke that's why the gospels are accurate they are perfect but the spirit did not only bring all things to their mind but he told them father on the truth they already had that's how Paul received his Revelation he said concerning it but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I never received it of man neither was I taught it of man but by the Revel of Jesus Christ and any Revelation comes by the spirit of God the revelation of God comes by the spirit of God it's the spirit of God revealing and when the spirit of God reveals to you then you get Faith praise the name of the Lord you get that Faith you catch that revelation praise the name of our Lord and then when you get that Revelation the gates of hell can never Prevail against praise the name of our Lord It's the Lord speaking to you it's the Lord teaching you it's the Lord showing you himself and that's how we need to desire every day Lord reveal yourself Lord show me the path I need to take Lord direct me praise the name of our Lord then he says he was taught by the Holy Ghost one day when Jesus was upon the earth a certain important man came to visit him this man said Rabbi we know you are a teacher sent from God but you will notice that Jesus cut him short he turned to Nicodemus and the words he spoke May well be paraphrased th I am not a teacher I am the sacrificial lamb for sin I am making possible the New Birth by my spirit but there is coming one who is the teacher he is down Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord so he first teaches us he first preaches to us the Bible says how would they believe if there is no preacher so the Holy Ghost anoints a preacher and then the preacher comes and preaches and now when the preacher preaches you believe it you obey it then the Holy Ghost comes and fills you praise the name of our Lord Cornelius was praying but it took the angel to come down to give guidance to conari called for Peter and he sent men to call Peter and now when Peter came he said why have you called for me said you know the angel came 3 days ago told me to call for you and then Peter started preaching the Lord Jesus Christ the name of our Lord and if you have heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Bible says it's the power of God unto salvation the Gospel of Jesus Christ so the more you hear the gospel and you obey the gospel then you are receiving the power of God praise the name of our Lord the Holy Ghost keeps on coming down theh keeps on coming down in your heart praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says in Acts chapter 10 when Peter spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell on them the that's the same principle even now the Holy Ghost did not fall to any person in the new in in the book of Acts without first hearing the word the Holy Ghost speaks to you first so you believe him you accept him you re you welcome him come Holy Spirit then he comes down in your life praise the name of our lord it's not difficult praise the name of our Lord so he says Nicodemus was looking at the teacher but he said I'm the lamb sacrificed for sin I need to die for the sins and now when I die for the sins then my life will come back in the form of the Holy Ghost and will give you the new birth praise the name of our when Jesus was upon us he came as the lamb and as the prophet but when he come back upon the church by his Spirit he became the teacher praise the name of our Lord so do we have the teacher now praise the name of our Lord we have the teacher and the teacher is the Holy Ghost and now the Holy Ghost uses the ministers the Holy Ghost uses the scriptures the Holy Ghost uses the TPS of the message and likewise the Holy Ghost Inside of us teaches us every day praise the name of our Lord we need to have the inside teacher living within us teaching us guiding us directing us revealing himself to us praise the name of our Lord you need the inside teacher and the inside teacher is the Holy Ghost and the inside teacher is not far away from you praise the name of our Lord he has been teaching you one step at a time taking you through justification taking you through sanctification until he feels himself where he feels I'm comfortable now Towell in this praise the name of our Lord allow the Holy Ghost to take over all your life praise the name of our Lord and then he says un to every age we hear the same truth he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church but only a spirit filled man can hear the Revelation for that age none other can no sir they cannot because that is exactly what Paul said in First Corinthians chapter 2: 6 to verse 16 praise the name of our Lord I want us again to go another quot he says he told us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that he would have the the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not and outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you had it every moment of the day that was the sign of the ining spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit had it as car men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost to the True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher had the word and the spirit in them took the word and told it revealed to them and they were of the group that had the messenger and his message and took it and lived it praise the name of our Lord so then you need to hear the spirit teaching and you know the spirit teaches us in various ways you hear the word and then the spirit can take you through some kind of Trials praise the name of our Lord can take you through some chastisement is doing child training praise the name of our Lord ising you praise the name of our Lord he teaching you you know like brother talks about the tutor he says the Holy Ghost he comes and checks you and then he reports back ah this son doesn't want your instruction son doesn't want to do this because the Holy Ghost has been teaching is directing you but when he tells you this do you do it praise the name of our Lord so he keeps on making a report about your conduct about how you hid the word about how serious you are with the word he keeps on giving a report and now if you can obey the Holy Ghost then you are sealed till the day of redemption prise the name of our Lord so the Holy Ghost is already working Upon Our Lives we only need to say Lord like somewhere Here I Am Lord direct me Lord guide me Lord every day that we live we need to live to seek the face of the Lord Lord lead me every step every time every hour praise the name of our Lord so we are not talking about the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord which you can only go to a convention and receive no praise the name of the Lord we're not talking about the Holy Ghost which you can only maybe say there's some special man with the Holy Ghost we not talking about that as the true word of God is ministered to you and you can obey the word of God is the holy spirit himself Desiring to dwell in your life praise the name of our Lord that's how easy it is obey the word and the spirit fills you and even when the spirit fills you he still wants to work upon your he wants you to grow praise the name of our Lord and reach adoption and reach the state of a perfect man and be able to demonstrate the image of Jesus Christ so the Holy Ghost right now is our inside teacher he teaches us he guides us he directs Us Praise the name of our Lord he speak to us the word of God he reveals us the word of God we only need to yield to the spirit of praise the name of our that even the Holy Ghost when he has dwelt in you the name of our Lord the Bible says it's no longer you that speak but the Holy Ghost wants to use you to speak praise the name of our Lord let us go to MTH chapter 10 and then verse 10 verse the scripture says but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what you shall speak for it shall be given you in the same hour what you shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you so when the Holy Ghost is right inside of you and then you are put under circumstances you don't understand sitations you don't understand before accusers or before critics know or before authorities he says don't think what you're going to speak but the spirit of God will come and speak the right words praise the name of our Lord so he once he dwells in you he will tell you what to say praise the name of our Lord he will show you what to do praise the name of our Lord he will reveal himself to you look at Peter when he was released from prison the holy the Holy Spirit you know sent an angel and then the angel started guiding him directing him and teaching him and say you go and show yourself to these people praise the name of our Lord so it was no longer his mind God had taken over the mind of Peter was leading him was directing him and now we need God to take over our mind to Peter I thought was a dream but it was God himself moving him something that man could not do prise the name of our and so we need to allow the Holy Ghost to take over our lives to fully take over our lives to govern Our Lives praise the name of our Lord let us go to First Corinthians chapter 2 First Corinthians chapter 2 and then read in verse 10 it says but God has revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yeah the Deep things of God praise the name of the Lord so the Bible says God reveals to us the Deep things and he reveals them to us by his Spirit the spirit sear as all things the spirit suchar as the Deep things of God and you know one thing about how the spirit speaks to us he can even search us when we are sited here in church he goes to this corner such as this heart pulls out something goes in another Corner such as the other pulls out something then goes to another corner like when brother Bram was under the anointing maybe it was a prayer line before him and so the Holy Ghost would come upon the person and reveals that person and from that person the Holy Ghost goes in another corner and again he attracts the attention say this and this then the Holy Ghost can move from that corner come to the front part talk to another person another Corner the Holy Ghost searching and we need to allow the Holy Ghost also to search our heart search me oh Lord praise the name of our Lord praise the name of our Lord that you can be searched out and then he can tell you now praise the name of our Lord I'm comfortable I'm well pleased to dwell in you because he has searched you and there's nothing contrary to him there's nothing you know no rebellious Spirits praise the name of our but you are all obedient to the word so we need to allow the Holy Ghost to search us every day and say Lord lead me like David the Bible says Try Me Oh Lord praise the name of our Lord then he says for what man knoweth the things of man sa the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knows no man but the spirit of God praise the name of the Lord says nobody knows the things of God save the spirit of God so when the spirit of God is in us he reveals to us the things of God he he teaches us the things of God he is the inside teacher when you get to read your message books the Holy Ghost starts revealing things to you reminding you of this kind of things and you know like sometimes when you are reading a message book you can even take a whole day on two three pages because there are many things the Holy Ghost is speaking up praise the name of our Lord you can read one or two scriptures and it is so much expounded before you praise the name of the Lord revealing these things praise the name of our Lord so when you read the word the word of God take time and meditate upon it take time and you know think about it praise the name of you know even these po do social sciences or whatever science they do then they they are now training people that you do some yoga and then you sit there and start meditating go in nature and start thinking and then they say is very healthy and then it refreshes you it brings you peace see the devil is copying what the Lord tells us to do but for them they're not meditating upon the word of God it's just something else you know but now here we have the word of God take time and meditate upon this word take time and think about the word of God praise the name of our Lord read the word think about the word meditate upon the word and then what you have read let it stick in your memory let it stick in Your Heart praise the name of our Lord and when it comes to time to do obey it do it the Bible says happy are you okay we can again pick that scripture in John Chapter 13 and verse 17 he says if you know these things happy are you if you do them that's the way it works the Holy Ghost has revealed these things to you you are more blessed to do them because you get the portion of these things you become part of them you have known them and for to be part of them obey them praise the name of the Lord that's how it works and then you'll see the Life of Christ being manifested in you so you don't only stop at being taught but then you have to be in demonstration of what the life of it that proves you have been taught by the holy spirit that means it has been revealed to you praise the name of our Lord when God called Abraham leave this country go to another country Abraham obeyed and when he obeyed he became part of that promise and that's the same thing we also need to do is God has revealed these things to us let us obey and when we obey them they become part of Us Praise the name of our Lord let us go back to First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 12 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual with spiritual things so it's the holy ghost that teaches us it's the holy ghost that reveals to us the holy ghost that directs Us Praise the name of the Lord just in finishing again the Holy Spirit started working upon your life the time you had the gospel the first time and then the Holy Ghost convicted you and when the Holy Ghost convicted you you said Lord forgive me Lord Deliver Me Lord I Repent of that I've done it was the Holy Spirit working upon your life and then you kept on coming to Services of the Lord you kept on reading the word of God you kept on Desiring to hear the word of God what was you had a desire to hear the spirit was speaking to you and the Holy Ghost was instructing you praise the name of our Lord and then the Holy Spirit started sanctifying you because it is the holy spirit that justifies Us Praise the name of our Lord It's the holy ghost that comes and sanctifies Us by the preaching of the word then the Holy Ghost justifies you by preaching and you believing the word you are justified by the spirit of God and again the Holy Ghost sanctifies you by the word praise the name of the Lord the Lord Jesus said the words that I speak unto you spirit and Truth praise the name of the Lord so when you hear
