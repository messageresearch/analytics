[18:17] [Music]
[18:19] well then
[18:22] go and become better
[18:26] people not better for the world but
[18:28] become better in the
[18:35] word amen being
[18:39] transformed
[18:42] anded
[18:43] children and
[18:46] ConEd to be like
[18:49] Jesus amen amen so we've read in the
[18:53] first chapter of
[18:56] Genesis in the beginning when God
[18:59] created heaven and the
[19:01] Earth upon the face of the
[19:06] Earth amen
[19:09] leared and when he
[19:11] looked when he
[19:13] looked he saw that it was
[19:17] beautiful praise the Lord then he
[19:19] separated each one of
[19:21] them and he put all things in
[19:26] order praise the Lord
[19:29] doing when he
[19:32] spoke the word was
[19:36] transforming praise the Lord the element
[19:39] which he
[19:41] spoke to conform to what was in his
[19:46] thoughts he had
[19:49] thought how things should
[19:52] be he had a
[19:54] thought how the Earth should look like
[19:58] the thought creating a
[20:02] garden praise the Lord whatever he
[20:06] spoke he spoke to
[20:10] transform into existence what was in his
[20:16] thoughts so we see the power of
[20:20] transformation and that this power
[20:23] works by a certain Factor
[20:28] praise the Lord because when God spoke
[20:31] to the
[20:33] waters if the waters did not hear the
[20:37] voice of the spoken
[20:40] word and obeyed to
[20:43] it Waters would not
[20:46] separate and when he spoke to
[20:50] Darkness Darkness heard
[20:53] it the voice of the spoken
[20:56] word I did not obey
[21:00] not be
[21:03] moved everything would a
[21:06] mess but we see that whatever he spoke
[21:11] to it obeyed the voice of
[21:15] God praise the Lord factor of
[21:21] obedience and total
[21:24] subjection total
[21:26] surrender total obedience the spoken
[21:31] what that toal
[21:35] obedience transformed
[21:38] things and it ConEd
[21:41] them to the mind that God
[21:46] had praise the living and the scripture
[21:49] tells
[21:50] us in the Book of Romans
[21:56] 12 verse 1 verse
[22:01] I you
[22:03] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[22:07] that you present your bodies a Living
[22:09] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[22:13] is your reasonable sacri
[22:28] and be not conformed to this world but
[22:31] be yet
[22:41] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[22:44] that you may prove what is that good and
[22:48] acceptable and perfect will of God
[23:00] so now this is the desire of
[23:04] God that we be not conformed to this
[23:08] world but that we be
[23:12] transformed in other words that we align
[23:15] [Music]
[23:17] ourselves with Godly
[23:20] virtues to have a change of
[23:23] [Music]
[23:25] mind to have a change of nature
[23:30] to have a change of
[23:33] nature to be
[23:35] changed praise the Lord by the renewing
[23:39] of our
[23:40] minds praise the name Living God that we
[23:44] may
[23:45] prove what is that good and acceptable
[23:48] and perfect will of
[23:50] God praise the Lord so the desire of
[23:54] God is that we be transformed
[23:58] praise the lord we be
[24:01] transformed to the mind of God we be
[24:05] transformed praise the Lord by the word
[24:07] of God so we may be
[24:11] perfect praise the Lord and then present
[24:16] ourselves
[24:17] acceptable which is according to his
[24:19] perfect
[24:21] will now we see that back
[24:23] then when he spoke the word and he spoke
[24:27] to the mountain
[24:29] and he spoke
[24:34] the he spoke to the stars and the
[24:37] mo and the rest of them when they heard
[24:40] the voice of
[24:42] God when they heard that God wanted them
[24:44] to be
[24:46] transformed to be changed to be
[24:49] conformed to his
[24:51] mind they all obeyed the voice of
[24:55] God praise the Lord and they were all
[24:58] transformed by the word of
[25:01] God and by
[25:03] obedience they were all put to
[25:06] order so we see that we are
[25:09] transformed by our obedience to the word
[25:12] of
[25:14] God we are transformed when we hear the
[25:17] voice of the spoken
[25:19] words when we receive the
[25:22] words praise the Lord and when we accept
[25:25] it by
[25:27] obedience settles in our
[25:29] hearts and then it begins to do the work
[25:32] of
[25:35] transformation to transform Us Praise
[25:38] the Lord to transform us to change our
[25:42] nature to change our
[25:44] thoughts change our mind align to the
[25:48] mind of
[25:49] God praise the Lord and as we notice in
[25:54] Genesis when the Heaven and Earth
[25:58] all the things that were there heard the
[26:01] voice and they obeyed it regardless of
[26:05] how long it
[26:07] took there was a transformation that
[26:10] took place
[26:12] there praise the Lord so now it all what
[26:15] matters
[26:16] here obedience to that
[26:20] voice when they obeyed it regardless of
[26:24] how long it
[26:25] took but the Bible tells us took six
[26:29] days and we know that one day like a
[26:32] thousand years so now we know it took
[26:35] 6,000
[26:37] years for all those things to be
[26:40] transformed and be set in
[26:43] order regardless of how many years it
[26:47] took as long as there was
[26:50] OB it begins to change our
[26:52] nature change our lives praise the Lord
[26:56] it begins to transform us
[26:59] more points of
[27:00] weakness it drives our way point areas
[27:03] of
[27:05] weakness the more you subject
[27:08] yourself to the word of God the more you
[27:11] become
[27:12] obedience to the voice of the
[27:15] word word transforms you prise the Lord
[27:20] you may not reach where you want to
[27:23] be in in the space of an hour you may
[27:27] have weakness
[27:28] when you believe the word of God the day
[27:31] you
[27:32] believe found with
[27:34] weaknesses and you
[27:36] prayed asked God to change you praise
[27:41] the Lord be
[27:42] obedient subject yourself to the word
[27:46] shall certainly transform you why
[27:50] because it is in his
[27:51] mind presents Us Praise the Lord as a
[27:56] perfect sacrifice
[27:58] he presents us as a bride that is Holy
[28:03] and has no
[28:04] blemish him praise the Lord so the
[28:08] transformation
[28:09] process begin at the time when we hear
[28:12] the
[28:14] voice and obey the voice of he begins
[28:17] now the
[28:19] work prise the Lord he begins the work
[28:22] and the more you keep
[28:24] yourself the word the more you keep
[28:27] yourself
[28:28] in his presence he transforms you praise
[28:33] the Lord he changes you praise the Lord
[28:36] you may not be perfect today but you are
[28:39] not what you are
[28:41] yesterday suddenly there is a
[28:44] transformation is taking place in your
[28:46] life praise the Lord and the purpose of
[28:49] this
[28:51] transformation you praise the Lord the
[28:55] image of God
[28:58] because the Bible says that when he was
[29:00] done creating the Heaven and the
[29:03] Earth and all the things that are in he
[29:06] then said let us create man in our own
[29:11] image praise the Lord so he created man
[29:15] in his own image and now when man fa the
[29:19] desire of God he he gets this
[29:24] man he transforms him he changes him to
[29:28] conform him to the original image of
[29:32] God praise the Lord so how do we get
[29:35] there keep
[29:37] obeying praise the Lord I will Stillen
[29:41] it to the
[29:43] SE that goes into the
[29:45] ground this seed when it goes to the
[29:49] ground it does not want to remain there
[29:52] it must bear
[29:54] fruits praise the Lord it does not want
[29:57] to live alone
[29:59] it wants to Bear other
[30:02] fruits have more seeds
[30:05] around it in order for it to
[30:09] Bear it must first of all be thrown
[30:12] down the ground and it must
[30:16] die the seed must first of all
[30:20] die and how does it die it must come
[30:23] into subject the conditions of the
[30:26] ground in order for it
[30:29] praise the Lord around three three or
[30:32] four weeks
[30:33] ago SP about this seat that this seed
[30:38] has a life on theide of
[30:40] it praise the Lord but it has a support
[30:43] system
[30:45] around support system protects that that
[30:50] seat life of the SE praise the Lord so
[30:54] when it is burried in the
[30:56] ground it must
[30:59] accommodate it must
[31:01] subject it must obey the conditions of
[31:05] the
[31:05] ground in order praise the Lord for the
[31:10] body to Die the body of this
[31:13] SE must first of all
[31:16] die in order for the SE to manifest it
[31:21] life praise the Lord and the conditions
[31:24] may become
[31:26] tough but the body of the seed has to
[31:31] Bear it must bear the
[31:35] heat it has to die in order to produce
[31:39] life praise the Lord so now our lives
[31:42] can only receive
[31:44] a of Our Lives a transformation a
[31:48] transformation of our body when we allow
[31:52] the
[31:53] conditions of the word to operate in our
[31:57] lives
[31:58] praise the lord we read about the par of
[32:01] the
[32:03] S when goes
[32:06] out he gets his seats and he throws them
[32:10] out only those
[32:13] seats fall in good
[32:16] ground praise the Lord have the
[32:19] opportunity to germinate and grow and
[32:23] bring forth fruits praise the Lord but
[32:26] those seats

[42:14] light and declare the name of the Lord
[42:18] that little
[42:19] light has the power to transform you to
[42:24] change you into Sons Daughters of
[42:28] God to conform us to the image of
[42:33] God to bring us to Perfection that's how
[42:37] we get into our
[42:39] Perfection is by the renewing of our
[42:42] minds through the word of God which has
[42:46] the transforming
[42:47] power praise the Lord that's all we want
[42:51] by the
[42:53] transformation of God
[42:55] Spirit by his word
[42:57] that's all we want to be
[43:00] transformed the will of God praise the
[43:03] Lord to be
[43:05] perfect be changed praise the Lord into
[43:09] his Perfect
[43:11] Image because what Christ is coming for
[43:15] is coming for a church that has got his
[43:18] life he coming for a
[43:21] church praise the Lord that is full of
[43:23] his life a church that has eaten the
[43:28] word that has taken up the book and that
[43:31] has eaten the book praise the Lord a
[43:34] church which the book has
[43:38] transformed his own
[43:40] likeness praise the Lord because he
[43:43] coming for a
[43:44] bright and the Bible tells us in the
[43:47] Book of Genesis that when God wanted to
[43:50] make for Adam a
[43:51] bright he never created a
[43:54] BRI from outside
[43:57] he looked at Adam and he got a part of
[44:00] him and out of him he created a bright
[44:05] and then woke up and he saw her praise
[44:09] the Lord she called him a woman who was
[44:13] a part of him a b of his b and flesh of
[44:18] his flesh so she was like himing his
[44:21] life because she came out of him so when
[44:24] Jesus is coming back is bright it must
[44:28] be a church that is like him praise the
[44:32] Lord it must be a church has been
[44:36] conformed to the nature of Jesus
[44:39] Christ that is like Jesus praise the
[44:43] Lord he's not coming for a church that
[44:46] has
[44:47] accepted but not
[44:49] transformed when you accept the word you
[44:53] must obey the word transform you until
[44:56] the image of God praise the Lord so you
[44:59] don't accept and then you walk out you
[45:03] must live by
[45:05] the you must walk by the words you must
[45:09] stay by the
[45:11] words Lord you must be conformed by the
[45:15] word to be
[45:16] conformed to the life of God and so the
[45:20] prophet says that's all that we all
[45:23] want to have the mind of Christ
[45:27] to have the mind that was in
[45:29] Christ that we may be transformed from
[45:32] the Natural Things of
[45:35] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[45:39] will of
[45:41] God by transformation of God
[45:44] Spirit by his word that should be our
[45:48] motive to be transformed
[45:51] daily praise the lord we must be ready
[45:55] to be transformed
[45:57] daily praise the Lord you cannot stand
[46:00] say I am
[46:01] perfect praise the Lord because if you
[46:04] are perfect he have no reason to be
[46:07] here but he's working on us transforming
[46:12] us is changing us to be perfect like him
[46:17] praise the Lord and when we be perfect
[46:20] like
[46:21] Jesus then he will come to take us home
[46:27] because his purpose is to change us to
[46:30] be like him be perfect so we should
[46:35] accept and allow the word of
[46:37] God to work on our
[46:40] lives transform us
[46:43] daily like Paul cried out he cried to be
[46:47] transformed
[46:48] daily and said I Must Die
[46:52] daily for myself to allow the
[46:55] transforming power of God
[46:58] to transform me and drive out
[47:02] all the elements of the Flesh and the
[47:05] desires of the flesh that are
[47:09] always at war with my
[47:11] spirit praise the Lord he said when I
[47:14] try to do good when I find myself and I
[47:19] think I have become
[47:21] perfect I find myself doing
[47:24] wrong praise the Lord when the word of
[47:28] caution put you right with God accept
[47:32] and
[47:32] Obey praise the Lord even if it is so
[47:35] hard for you you accept and Obey and
[47:40] allow
[47:41] God to take his
[47:43] cause to transform you to make you
[47:47] obedience to align you with his
[47:50] words praise the Lord Die daily of all
[47:55] your
[47:55] fears to Die daily of all your fears
[48:00] praise the Lord the fear to present
[48:04] yourself as a Christian as a Believer as
[48:08] a child of God before the rest of the
[48:12] world before the rest of the world
[48:15] praise the Lord you die
[48:18] daily praise the
[48:20] Lord you have proclaimed my
[48:23] word regardless of the situation
[48:27] persecution you mention the word of
[48:29] Jesus they deny you from speaking about
[48:33] it you speak about him because you know
[48:38] that he has the transforming
[48:40] power praise the Lord to transform you
[48:43] and he says I open the door and no man
[48:47] can shut not ashamed has opened the door
[48:51] for you and you have come to
[48:54] knowledge of the word of God
[48:57] asham speak about Jesus in the Dark
[49:01] Ages prise the Lord there were men and
[49:05] women who are not
[49:08] ashamed to speak about the name of the
[49:11] Lord praise the Lord they were
[49:14] beaten some of them the women those that
[49:19] stood by the word of God and left their
[49:23] hair to
[49:24] grow their hair was was set a
[49:29] bless they set fire on their and they
[49:33] were burned but they never rejected they
[49:36] were not ashamed of the name of the Lord
[49:40] praise the Lord and now there was a
[49:42] man the prophet talks about in that
[49:46] message the
[49:48] Masterpiece he says there was a man who
[49:52] wrote and says but where is that God
[49:58] that was very
[50:00] silent when his people were
[50:04] subjected to all that
[50:07] humiliation all the
[50:11] torture that God was present with
[50:16] them that God is present with you in
[50:21] your dark moments of life in your moment
[50:24] of
[50:25] persecution that God
[50:27] is present with you praise the Lord and
[50:30] he says I have a crown for you because
[50:33] you have not rejected my name you have
[50:36] not denied my
[50:38] name keep the name of the Lord and keep
[50:42] that little
[50:43] strength praise the Lord because the
[50:46] goal of every
[50:49] believer accepted
[50:51] Christ is to be like
[50:54] him is to talk like him
[50:57] is to walk
[50:58] like praise the Lord is to be lost
[51:02] yourself and allow him to
[51:05] be become blind
[51:09] to and thees of
[51:12] yourself to allow the person of Christ
[51:15] to dwell in there so he can transform
[51:19] you to be like him that's our desire and
[51:24] the prophet says now that's what we are
[51:27] here
[51:28] for that's my message has been all along
[51:33] is the word of God we must hold to
[51:36] that regardless of what others other
[51:40] things take
[51:42] place always stay with that
[51:45] word always check out your motives and
[51:50] objectives if it is according to the
[51:52] word of
[51:53] God if it isn't
[51:56] leave it alone if it is with the word of
[52:00] God and lines up with the word of
[52:03] God hold to
[52:06] that praise the Lord amen hold to that
[52:11] shake your life check your motives check
[52:15] your character check your speech he says
[52:20] if it is not
[52:21] aligning the word of God As a Christian
[52:25] as aie
[52:27] who has received the word praise the
[52:31] Lord leave it and only hold onto the
[52:36] word why because the word has the power
[52:40] and
[52:41] ability to transform you it will
[52:44] transform your
[52:46] mind your mind has a
[52:49] thinking align with the mind of God the
[52:54] word of God
[52:55] trans praise the Lord that's why
[52:59] message and what you have asked for has
[53:03] not been given to you praise the Lord
[53:06] you will not C
[53:07] God you will love him more and you will
[53:12] know that is not in his perfect
[53:15] will to give you what youve asked for
[53:18] but as long as in love with him you
[53:22] being
[53:23] transformed and your life aligns
[53:27] the word of God praise the Lord when you
[53:30] ask something and has not been given you
[53:34] will know is not in the will of God why
[53:38] because the
[53:39] Christian of every
[53:41] Christian to live the will of God that's
[53:45] why when Jesus told
[53:47] us say when you pray you pray for the
[53:51] will of God
[53:52] to not our own will why because our will
[53:58] may not align with the word of
[54:00] God but his will aligns with his
[54:04] own when you ask for the will of God
[54:07] to praise the Lord it shall surely be
[54:12] because he only
[54:13] wishes good things for
[54:16] us the Bible says God is Not
[54:20] unjust that he allows you to be tempted
[54:25] to be
[54:27] beyond that you
[54:30] cannot Lord he is not
[54:34] unjust that he has not called you to get
[54:37] into his word to align with his word he
[54:42] has not transformed you to leave you
[54:45] there to
[54:47] be beyond your
[54:50] strength every trial that
[54:53] comes God gives you the strength
[54:56] praise the Lord to overcome it he gives
[55:00] you the strength sometimes it may take
[55:03] too
[55:05] long but it is in his own
[55:07] will be patient
[55:10] with and allow his word all his will to
[55:14] be it may
[55:16] take but certainly it shall come to pass
[55:21] praise the Lord that's how he
[55:24] transforms by his spoken words
[55:27] because he spoke his word and when he
[55:29] spoke his word he does not go back
[55:32] void praise the Lord he spoke his word
[55:36] he accept his word and you live by his
[55:39] word and walk by his word Pray by his
[55:43] word

[55:48] word so let's live by the word of God
[55:52] let's be guided by the word of God let
[55:55] our souls

[56:00] gods
