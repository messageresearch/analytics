come together Lord and commune with you and your word The Fellowship Of Brothers we pray oh God that you may make your scriptures come to pass you give a promise where we shall always gather two or three Lord the spirit of Grace may be in our MST this evening us of your goodness encourage us in your word father Lord God even as you wait for your return that you may be encouraged by every script we shall read tonight the end of the day your name may be glorified Lord I take up the scriptures to read I Lord you may send your Holy Spirit father Lord God of father go before the scripture Lord you may teach our hearts circumcise Lord the lips of the ones that are going to speak father Lord they may not father of Glory stop you from speaking your mind tonight speakers do the speaking of the word circumcise Lord the ears of the listeners that this word Lord may go through our ears and Lord May reach the ears of our souls find find a in us that Lord we may bu obtain life we give you glory praise and honor in the name of Jus Christ and believe God bless you all are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen such a blessing for me to be standing before you amen I want to appreciate the pastors for entrusting me with the opportunity to always come before you and speak the word of God amen we shall take up our Bibles and open the book of Romans chapter 3se 23 amen amen for our subject tonight it shall be dying daily dying daily to ourselves to our amen amen so Romans 2 verse 23 says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus may the Lord add a blessing to his word amen amen so like I said we shall be taking a simple text subject on dying daily dying daily to ourselves for Christ to live praise the Lord ding daily to our affections dying da to our interests to allow Christ to live amen the scripture said here all have SE and come short of the glory of God and because every day we sin we have all sinned now for us to be reconciled we need Jesus Christ praise the Lord because we sin every day in sin we have to Die daily of this life praise the lord we have to Die daily of this life such that we allow the will of God to live in our lives praise the lordes and says if we say we have not seen we make God a liar that's what he says if we say that we have not seen no we don't move in we have not seen we make God a liar but because we move in sin had to pave a way for us you had to provide a way for us to be reconciled daily to himself praise the name of the Living God that we are reconciled daily to himself praise the living Bo so now I want us to go to a scripture here yes excuse me sorry my Gadget is getting is behaving a little bit amen First Corinthians we can go to chapter 15 let's first let's start with Gans 2 verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and says the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God praise the name of the Living God so that's what Paul says the life that he lives no longer him that liveth Christ that liveth in him so now when we turn to First Corinthians 15 and we start from verse 30 say and why stand we in J but every hour I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I daily after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus what what advant what advantages it to me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die and then he says be not deceived for such evil conversations for such evil conversations corrupt good manner so now Paul is emphasizing the element of dying says I Die daily for what for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and when he was speaking here Paul was rebuking the people those that were disputing the resurrection of the Dead praise the Lord he was rebuking evil conversations amongst them that we disputing the the resurrection of the dead and he says if the dead rise not then let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die and we have no hope of Resurrection because we have the hope of Resurrection praise the Lord because we have the hope that after this life there is a life that God has prepared for us we have a mission to look for we have a mission to look after and that is the will of God for our lives that's why he says for that reason I have to Die daily noer I that leave the life of Jesus Christ in me emphasizing the need for us to seek the will of God for our lives prise the for the blood of Jesus Christ when he died the Bible says in Hebrews 12 verse 24 blood of Jesus speaks better things in the life that we live because we are bound to backsliding the prophet says it takes a constant prayer to go to keep us closer to him and at times because of sin it becomes very hard for us to maintain that prayerful life praise the Lord hard for us to maintain stay that constant atmosphere of prayer Keep Us close at God every day praise the Lord the Bible says even when we are at those weakest moments sin condition has pushed us so deep the Bible says when we are weak at that moment then are we strong why because the grace of God that God has provided for us to be reconciled himself the grace of God that God has provided for us to be brought back to him the Grace by which a Christian liveth the Grace by which we walk that Grace still sees us when we are at the weakest of point and what God has provided for us to be reconciled back to him praise the Lord and when that Grace takes over the divine superal nature of God deeps us into his blood for our complete recovery by the blood of Jesus Christ that blood of Jesus speaks better things blood of ab we see that when AB when he was murdered by Cain in Genesis chapter 4 was crying out for vengeance out bitterness praise the Lord but the blood of Jesus Christ which has been provided for us it speaks better things than vengeance praise the Lord speaks forgiveness to our sins it speaks reconciliation to the Fallen speaks Redemption and salvation to our Souls praise the Living God for us to partake of the benefits of that blood for us to partake of the benefits of that sacrifice we go to Die daily of ourselves of our ways allow God's ways in our lives prop says in the message God is provided now there is only two ways of anything that is the way the right way and the wrong way and them ways are your ways and God's ways he says there are two things always there is two ways there is the good way which is God's way and then there is the wrong way which is our ways and you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time you've got to forget your own way in order to get in God's way for as long as you're in your own way out of him way so forsake your ways forsake your thoughts forsake everything about you and rely on one thing that is thus says the Lord so we have to forsake our ways praise the lord we have to forsake all our affections only allow the will of God so be dying to ourselves allow the person of Christ to live in our lives Die daily is to choose the will of God against our own will daily is to choose the will of God of how hard it made for you to Die daily of your interest you have to choose the will of God against your own will praise the Lord and then you have to choose the Lord his way Paul speaks about choosing God his way he was a just man very just man and he sacrificed all his titles his respect his wealth family friends for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and he was not ashamed of this gospel but he spoke and rebuked evil with boldness why he not consider himself worthy consider his life so precious consider his titles and His glory so precious comp to the word of God so now Paul rejected all those glories and he made a choice and he chose the Lord's way it says in Romans 1 verse 16 I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ why he made a decision follow the way of the Lord is the power of God and salvation everyone that believeth so now if this just man was not ashamed of the way of the Lord a man who endured all persecution for the sake of the way of the Lord praise the Lord how much more ought we to be how much more should we be the titles that he carried if he carried the knowledge that he had acquired in theology rejected and he undressed himself all those glories and accepted to follow the way of the Lord how must we be today the Lord we all to choose the Lord's will our own will so doing we shall be dying to ourselves allr to live praise the name of living God and now we find that this Paul who died daily of his own way he let the word of the Lord be exalted praise the Lord but we also find where the scripture says all have sin and come short of the glory of God Paul finds himself Waring against himself praise the Lord at some point in time there are some bit of element of uh of uh self extion when he want his wanted to exalt before God each time Paul saw that coming through he remind himself of God his provided way and he looked beyond his past looked beyond his glories and he looked way up to Calvary Jesus and each time he saw that he says I Die daily I Die daily of these my glor daily of all my imperfection I Die daily of all my desires allow the Gospel of Jesus Christ allow the Life of Christ to exalt itself praise the Lord he relied on the principle of Grace he relied on the grace of God the power of Jesus Christ to overcome that sin that wanted to exalt itself before God praise the Lord his struggles struggles in his life he was still living this m and those imperfections used to come through and wanted to exalt themselves that's why in Romans chapter 712 he says I find then a law but when I would do good evil is still present with me iight in the law of God after the inward man after the inward man I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity the law of sin which is in my members and he cried out and said oh riched man that I am who will deliver me from the body man am I oh who will deliver me from this body of this death but I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God this flesh is still bound to sin he desires to serve sin and time he go to that point he chose to die to himself chose to die to his chose to die to those members body that we are Waring against the law of God the law to serve the Lord to exal Jesus Christ he says for that reason I choose to Die daily Paul did not choose to die to himself that this war that was existing in his members would exal beyond the will of God for that reason the gopel of Jesus Christ not be exalted to die to himself to die to all those thoughts that he would choose to serve the Lord praise the Lord and then took the way of the Lord how much more must we die of our thought much of our imaginations man time those thoughts came his way those imaginations self time it came his way he had to make a choice and he always made a perfect choice chose the Lord his way and he rejected his own s how much we as Christians we to die to these our imaginations our pride was Pride had it all he was a great man he had been schooled and he had the knowledge of theology such a great man he would he chose to reject price over the will of God praise the Lord how much more ow we to die of our pride allow the will of God how much more we to die of boasting conspiracies and envy and anger and bitterness and evil talks and all evil lives and impatience with one another with the word of God and his promises how much more ought we to all these things for the will of God praise the Lord and how do we dive ourselves by choosing the will of God by choosing to go with the word of God prise the Lord by being obedient to the word of God by being Obed to the Holy Spirit prise the Lord that when our our members want to exalt beyond the will of God choose to humble yourself such that you allow God to come and exalt himself praise the lord we Must Die daily to stay in the way of God praise the Lord we thank God because he has provided for us a way of how we can die to ourselves be kept in his will the Lord at Cal when Jesus died the sacrifice that was given for us when he poured his blood he gave us a life and he gave us Grace praise the Lord that even when we have become so weak and we cannot contain the precious in our members Grace is still sufficient prise the Lord even when our members rle against ourselves Pride self wanting to take shape against the word of God is a sufficient Grace that still brings us back to himself that Grace the grace of Jesus Christ praise the Lord which is God is provided way God has provided for us to be kept in his will praise the Lord so what ought we to do we need to accept Grace we need to walk in Grace praise the lord we need to Simply accept the will of God that is what he has provided for us to be to die to ourselves allow Christ to live in Us Praise the Lord to Die daily is letting go of oneself for Christ to live praise the Lord being identified with Jesus Christ and his word choosing the word of God choosing do the the will of the word of God accepting the appro of the Cross of Calvary to be led of the spirit of God not self will living a life of Jesus Christ that reflects the acts of the holy spirit in the body of a Believer how to do it Paul had to do it in order to reflect the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the rest of the world he says when I die to myself I am crucified with Jesus Christ praise the Lord when I died myself I am crucified with Jesus Christ and he says if I die as many times as possible I am allowing Jesus Christ to come and live within me why because when you die not losing your [Applause] breath try to talk about dying your self will your own thoughts praise the Lord that it is no longer you that is living but Christ himself Paul says when I die I am crucified with Jesus Gans verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live because I have died myself the life that I live is not I that liveth praise the Lord but I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me praise the Lord because I am dead to myself no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me because I am dead myself influence of this flesh has no effect on me that's what Paul said he said there there is a war in my members when I try to do good I try do the will of God that is always the mind of evil present with me comping me to do the contrary says but I choose to Die daily such the influence of this flesh has no effect on me the influence of the affections of this flesh have no influence on me why because it's no longer I that live but Christ that praise the Lord message communion communion of 1962 the prophet says our bodies need food and drink each day in order survive for our physical body if we don't take food each day and drink our bodies weaken then there is something in us that we must have food there is something on theide of us that convinces that you need food even if you pretend that you don't want to eat the hunger your stomach will push you to ask for something in order to survive and also have energy to praise the Lord says something in us that we must have food one day's food will not last for the next day you've got to have food each day to strengthen your motal being so you can live over you can live over without F but you are weaker and the second day you you are still weaker and the third day you are getting tremendous weak why because the body has not been given food but if the body needs food to survive that means even the life that we have our souls also need to be fed in order for for them to live if your body needs food even your soul needs food in order to live and the prophet says here it does not mean you eat only today and then you survive the second day he says yes you can eat today and survive the next day your body will become the Lord now what do we need we need to eat this food every day to eat spiritual food every day for you to be able to live say well that's what many times that we do in the spiritual real you see each day we go to commune with Christ we've got to talk to him each day go to settle it with him each day said I die each day each day I die I live not me but Christ lives in me if your physical body needs food each day drink each day to survive you are spiritual body need spiritual food and communion with the Lord each that survive said shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God each day we've go to study the Bible each day you need spiritual food to give you spiritual energ food give you the momentum praise the Lord carry on for the next day every day you need spiritual food keep you awake that you are able to die yourself and let the inner person Christ himself exalt otherwise if you eat today read your Bible today and then tomorrow you say after all I read yesterday praise the Lord the spirit is getting weaker then carry over yes you're able to survive but yet your spirit is getting weaker and you're not getting sufficient energy to your members that are Waring against yourself how did overcome prise the Lord he chose to go by the word every day of his life ding daily he shows Christ every day of his life he confess Christ every day of his life he moved he rebuked the devil in the name of Jesus Christ made sure that spoke about Christ everywhere he Liv thrown in in the prison he still spoke about Jesus he about Jesus he was feeding every day so doing was able to die himself allow Christ to live the Lord you need to die feeding on the word of God every day to die seeking the will of go every day by studying the word and the message every day of your life you get the energy you get the momentum you get that energy sufficient you overcome evil ex before you daily without your affe Die daily your con Die daily judge your own thoughts praise the Lord and allow Christ to exalt himself man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God praise the Lord yes sir that's the scripture when died it was no longer him so he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when we die to ourselves no longer us that live but Christ himself and Christ can never be ashamed of his own words praise the Lord so when we die daily we shall not be ashamed profess that we are Christians we be ashamed speak about the gospel that we have received to speak about the message that we believe why because now that that influence would cause you to be ashamed no longer living because you yourself Christ Christ wants to make himself exalted and by exting himself he must speak about himself everywhere at home praise the Lord in the church in the streets at the place of work everywhere Christ manifesting himself prise the Lord as Christians choose to Die daily get identified with Christ we shall exalt Christ everywhere we go because it is not our lives but when they look at you they're not seeing you because you ad yourself they seeing Christ and they seeing the Life of Christ because you no longer live but Christ lives you praise the Living God message the end time evangelis 1962 Jesus said you must be born again in order to be born again is letting yourself go and die and the spirit of Christ come into you then you are you are no more yours praise the Lord no longer yours it is Christ in you the holy spiritul said I Die daily yet I live not I but Christ lives in me praise the Lord John the rator the Divine who received the Revelation and wrote it down he died to himself for Christ to live and the life of Christ was in him he was free from the chains and influence of sin was free from Fear he was free from affection he wasn't ruled by any of those affections of the body that's why when they persecuted him of the gos of Jesus Christ he was not afraid to die praise the Lord because he knew that it was not him that is living was no longer John that is living was Christ in John that's why he was able to face even if it meant death he was still Bal praise the Lord because he had already died himself and it was the life of Jesus Christ in him life of Jesus Christ praise the Lord that manifested in him we know that it does not die he died once and now he live forever died once at Calvary died at he went down praise the Lord he went and conquered the KE he went to the devil and he conquered death from and now he he came back praise the Lord and so if he conquered death he died once and he liveth forever Christ died once forever lives in us that means we have a life shall not die but we have a life that liveth forever even when this body is destroyed the life that lives in us the life of Jesus Christ that it is eternal that lives forever so now John had this Revelation that he had died himself and it was noer him that was living Christ The Life of Christ was in Joy when they attempted to kill him he was not afraid praise the Lord even when the devil attacks that life that lives on the inside of us all those kind of afflictions diseases and all sin and all the Pains of this body the life that we have shall not die praise the Lord so now they tried to kill him they want they boil him in oil he couldn't die why because was no longer Christ on the inside of he was determined to even face death because he knew that even when they touch this body he had a life on the inside that could not die praise the Lord that is the assurance that we have praise the Lord that we have died to ourselves we have died to these bodies if Christ is living in us even when we are faced with these afflictions when we are faced with kind this kind of diseases it is cancer know that the best it can do the best it can do to affect this body it cannot affect the life Jesus Christ that we have received why because his life Liv forever God himself now if John had died himself was able to understand all these afflictions for the sake of the Gospel until they threw him on the island but even when he was thrown there and all the Scorpions the them animals could not still touch that life the Lord he had a life which was beyond the things around him was beyond the afflictions that he and that is the life that we are given we die to ourselves praise the Lord and now talk about St he was stoned thought when they to St the life that was living on the best they could St his body but they could not Stone the life out of him he still confessed Christ he still confessed Jesus Christ even at that point of death praise the Lord about Daniel they wanted to kill him they thought by throwing him in the den would kill the life that he had received but he had a life that was not his but the life of God himself was living in Daniel and as long as that life was there there was nothing that was able to with understand and the Lions had nothing to do with that Li talk about and all and his two friends and they had been given a life because they had made a choice to go in the way of the Lord they had made a choice to follow God provided way not they were not ready to denounce God's provided with chose to they chose to die to themselves and yes they themselves if they had not died themselves there is no way they would Mar to fire because this body has affection when it comes near fire that affection Christ fear and they would fear if they were living by their lives those three young men they are not living their own lives but they are living the life of God himself that's why even when they fa the fire they were not afraid to face because they had more than fire on theide of was eternal they had Revelation not even that fire could quench the fire that Wasing on the side through come out the so now if we must win over all this TR affection we to die ourselves and allow Christ to live in us to give us the victory that we can overcome all those troubles brother because he had made a good choice he chosen the Lord is provided children go in the will of God even when he met this firece bull the grace of God that God provided for him because he had chosen that himself was able to bring down this Fierce bull not affect had killed so many people but because there was a different life in the life of BR came before this bull could not affect him he was not living his life there was the life of Jesus Christ in him because he had denounced himself and he had allowed Christ to live if we denounce ourselves we denounce our affection denounce our ideas you denounce our self love and allow Christ to live we shall have the grace sufficient to S against all afflictions of life we shall have gra sufficient to go through all diseases to go through all pain through all pain without fear why it is not you that is living but Christ has come and he lives on the inside praise the Lord so as Christians we ought to Die daily that Christ himself may come and live and when he lives it's no longer you it's no longer I it's no longer my will praise the Lord even when I want something so much as long as it's against the will of God I will choose the will of God I will not choose my own will that Grace as long as you remain obedient there is that sufficient Grace to enable us look and follow the will of God against our own will the B says many are the plans of man in his heart but the Lord will prevails about is you and and I it is the Christian who has received the word of God you who have received of the life of God no long governed by your s will but you always pray for the Lord's will the grace of God has been provided for us and it is always present with us to support us he's always present with us to help us in the will of God the prophet says how do we come to that by keeping a constant prayer life the Lord and the more you keep that constant prayer life the more you love God the more you love his word the more you love God and His word the more you deep yourself in the word the yourself in the world the more you find the mysteries of God the more you start looking at the things of the world as nothing praise the Lord as long as they come in the way of the world praise the Lord that's what Paul did in in Romans chapter 7 he say yes I am struggling I have battles on the inside of me I have a will to do good and yet there is also a will to do evil what did he do he shows the Lord his way the will to do good will to the word of God the word of God that's how we were able to receive this gospel because Paul stood for the word of God father stood for the word of God came and stood for him grace of God the favor of God and the wisdom of God always before him if we walk in the way of God go by the will of God the knowledge of God the wisdom of God the grace of God and the favor of God always go with us whever we shall sickness he shall provide his grace and the grace shall heal praise the Lord Affliction shall supply his grace his grace will be sufficient over them praise the Lord in times of poverty he shall supply his grace shall be come out of it all different kind of needs as long as we are going by the will of God going by the word of God his grace will always go before us says the feet of the righteous of the LA who are the righte they that obeyed the word of God accepted to go in the Lord's proph the will of God whether the rest of the people reject but they choose to go by and those are the people whose feet are always ordered of the Lord and He is is very very very faithful to his promises he does not promise and leave it there if he promised he's still faithful to make it come to has promised us Grace we shall supply it as long as we keep ourselves close to that Grace praise the Living God dying daily is letting go of ourselves for Christ to live with you God bless you [Applause] amen amen amen where he Liv me I will follow where he leads me I will follow oh where he lives me I will
