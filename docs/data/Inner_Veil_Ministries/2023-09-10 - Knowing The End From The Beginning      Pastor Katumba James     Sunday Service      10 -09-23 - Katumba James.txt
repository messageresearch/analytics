Services I know my real services are in the night our time here and so you can follow up the ministry there also just keep him in your prayers and then next Sunday we are going to have a youth meeting in the afternoon so I'd request all they used to be around for the afternoon service on Sunday so today I just want us to see some of the missions we have been doing then we just displayed on the video we're going to start but after dedication of the baby to a dog which is and then today was also you know this week I was praying what should I preached it today and then there's a thought that came I was trying to prepare on on Friday and then again another thought which had to come by those India and when I started preparing about this other thought we are going to share today and I find everything is driving in a direction praise the name of Allah so we shall be take of it time to adapt you know on what we are doing which is What the Lord Has Done in our day What the Lord Has Done in our age and my desire that each and every one of us you put it as a burden upon your heart to go and even tell your friends you go and tell your colleagues tell your family praise the name of our Lord like I can give a testimony brother if you want to stand up brother you can sit down he's also a student at the Kampala International University is doing internships so he's doing internship here in the ginger he received the message I think one or less about a year ago and so this week you had gone to his place his village and then he met his sister and the sister is a pastor of a Pentecostal church after chidera before you reachung all right immediately so he came here on Thursday you know trying to look around for how it can be handled negotiations then we finally talked in the evening because I was a and then now he said my sister wants to be baptized then I was asking him from where now we can baptize the baptized at church but then I said what about the church I said she's also willing to get the same message to go to his her child where is the name of Allah so on Tuesday God willing he shall be going to that place beyond kidera to preach to them the message so that's how the gospel is going praise the name of Allah on Wednesday there is you remember when we had brother Andreas here located there is a when they called pastors there was a woman who came as a pastor and she stood in Frontier she's a pastor in a church she has also invited us that bring this same message to our church so on Wednesday we shall be at her place because the church will be open at 4 30 for the afternoon service then on Thursdays you know we've been having some of these meetings with the new pastors to the different churches but we had never preached them on issues of marriage so last Thursday I started preaching on marriage series after the whole of this month we shall be taking almost five Services those pastors then on Friday and a Saturday there is also a church which is coming out from Pentecost we have ever been there once but we've been inviting the pastor from other different meetings the pastor called me he has prepared two two days meetings it is actually in the Royal District he also says come preach and also baptize my so now this day God being gracious we want to see what the Lord Has Done In Our Generation and then we we have also this references like our church website it has What the Lord Has Done the summer of it you can share with your friends you know and then you tell them you see God has done this and all these things are of proof say that each and every one of us we can encourage this message to the next person to your colleagues and so on praise the name of Allah so before we go further there is a it says God bless you then he says God has multiplied my family with a bouncing baby boy Solomon cartoon [Music] I request the boy to be dedicated to God this is from Brother Richard Montgomery you can sing bring them in as they bring the baby bring them in bring them [Music] bring them in bring them in bring once come bring them in bring them in from the fields [Applause] [Music] bring down wonders [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] bring down [Music] amen praise the name of our Lord you know in the denominations they baptized little children like this little baby before us but that one is not right are you educated that's not in the scriptures you know before somebody is baptized or even baptism which they do it's not the baptism because they get the little baby sprinkle water in the foreign [Music] by putting them right beneath the Earth so even baptism somebody must be immersed in the world that's right here we have a pool and then we immerse the people who come to be baptized so if there is somebody here who has never been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by imagine you need to do that before it is too late so now the denominations bring children and said they are baptizing them which is not right but even before you are baptized according to the scriptures the Bible says he that believes [Music] shall be saved so before somebody is baptized they must first believe I know and then the Bible says how shall they believe if they are not preached to so now when you hear the gospel and then the Bible says that's in Romans and the confesses with the mouse so you must hear a preacher you must hear the word when you hear the word of God you believe that word with yourself [Music] [Music] so when we were foreign unto him little children that he should put his hands on them ecology and pray a servant and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said foreign amen [Music] [Music] [Music] where the Bible says people will be disobedient and so many wickedness we pray for your protection we pray heaven we may give grace to the father may you give him wisdom your blessings and protection [Music] be such a positive example to this baby when it comes Lord we pray he may give his life unto the Lord Jesus Christ give this baby good health every need that they have needed [Music] [Music] God bless you [Music] so I think we can go to the missionary kind of activities we are doing this praise the name of our Lord I think we start with the okay maybe if you can start with one by one as you put them there and then I can give some small background on each now that's what a baptism like during that time we baptized the six to eight people these are different places actually Robert is some of these places some of them are in ibali like that one is in calero which is on right now and then what about the volume if you can increase the volume normally after baptism we give them Bibles Uganda Bibles that was also in number those were about I think 80 people were baptizing [Applause] [Music] [Music] some of these photos are from vupadengo some of these were from Rupa Dengue which was around [Applause] Virginia thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on come on [Music] [Music] this truck is taking candidates for baptism that was any movement [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah okay thank you we'll go to the next one it's a blessing foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] we have 8G 3 million people and there is more message believers [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] the things that we see is

beloved [Music] amen because he loves you for his great love we're with he loved them in Ezekiel he says it this way since when I pass by you I looked upon you again [Music] this is marriage he says I spread my skirt over you yeah [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that that's why the Bible says in Revelation 3. I counselves that the shame of thy nakedness [Music] [Music] [Music] and you had shown us that we can never pray too much we thank you that we have an approach to you foreign [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] I want to go to Jerusalem praise God so that you can go to Jerusalem to put forward [Music] please missionary life well you watch over them all the time leave them in every place they will do the work of the Kings even keeping the family back home safe and sexual together the scripture says come and open this word to us reveal yourself to us and bless every one of us upon this meeting all the need of your children in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let us go to Isaiah chapter 46. Isaiah chapter 46. we're reading verse 9 and verse 10 Our Community Praise the name of Allah so the Bible says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me um declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my cancer shall stand and I will do all my pleasure foreign the greatest thing of his word you may be seated praise the name of our Lord so I want to preach on knowing the end from the beginning knowing the end from the beginning now in verse 10. he says declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my cancer shall stand and I will do my pleasure now to declare means that you are announcing you are publishing you are proclaiming but now how the Lord declares he declares something as if it has been done foreign of God foreign foreign and to us dear today a child is born um now you can start asking where is that child because the child has been born to us but this is Isaiah speaking about 600 years before it happened but for him we saw the reality a son is giving um then he says his government shall be on his shoulders the Everlasting father the prince of peace and then they get into the mind of God and when the prophets get into the mind they see the things that God as real as it is happening so God knows the end from the beginning like Moses praise the name of our Lord Moses writes the book of Genesis and then when he writes the book of Genesis he says in the beginning God created the heavens and the others then you ask Moses where where are you foreign foreign [Music] up to the time foreign Moses writing the Book of Genesis how did he write it God was revealing it to him praise the name of Allah and then Moses in his lifetime God showed him the coming of Christ the name of Allah so now you have the confidence that what I have believed is the truth praise the name of Allah you have confidence that I know where I am going to the angel praise the name of our Lord it is a clear path it says in this same message God was showing brother the things he was showing him the things and when he comes and brings them out he speaks with the certainty that it is going to be now I want us to go to the church website praise the name of our Lord our church website you can get it www.ww dot innervailministries.org all these things will put them on the Internet make good news of them because praise the name of Allah now like here we we wrote about the timelines of brother Branham I think we can go to we can go to night number three praise the name of our Lord you can get that information there you can share it with your friends know what the Lord Has Done in our age God has sent us a prophet like now let us go back to your place where I've been you know in 1906 1916. in 1916 ready to be clear in 1916. you know he was still a little boy because he was born in 1909 and then now so when it was about seven years I would say oh so yeah he was actually going to fetch water I pray you keep it the way I would wish it to keep it so now he was speaking water yeah I think now for us we don't call it Imperial kazim praise the name of Allah you know Uganda that's what we know so that that kind of well-oing he had it like in the tree and then he had the voice and the voice told him from a tree do not drink or smoke but defile yourself in any way there will be work for you to do when you get older so when he had that voice he ran to his mother I've heard the man talk to me from the tree then the mother said now this one may be navias just calmed him down as he grew up as a youth several times he wanted to do what other used to do because you are maybe in a company maybe they are smoking so he would want to smoke there was a time where a friend was teasing him you don't like going to discourse you don't like to drink get this cigarette and put on your mouth don't be a cease and then he was putting it here then in that same sound of the wild wind Camp he threw down the cigarettes then another time because his father was distilling alcohol so the father had the friends and they were drinking of All My Children said you give him a bottle so when they were giving him a bottle again that kind of sound then he took off praise the name of it and you see when he was born in 1909. during his back there was a pillar of fire that came where he was in the morning when he was born morning around 5 a.m and the light stayed there and a number of times in his life when he would he was not yet a Believer when he goes to a place then these people who are astrologers they would say there is a star moving over your head then he says what about the other persons can I tell you you they tell me you were born and then the person would tell him you were born on this day at this time say tell also the others then again in Another Place Another will tell him you know you have a gift of God say they don't understand I don't understand then they said you you don't read the Bible cancel my Bible the three wise men they were following yesterday so for him we wouldn't understand so now let us go number four so in 19016 in 1916 he had the first Vision now in this vision he saw a bridge being built over River Ohio and 16 people fell in the river and died now this was fulfilled exactly 22 years from that year you know when the Second Street bridge in Louisville Kentucky was built on River Ohio in which 16 people died and then in 1923 number five he saw the vision of hair yeah so he says while hunting one evening he was accidentally shot on both legs and taken to hospital in a critical condition he was in hospital for a long time but now he was getting in a place of death and then he got into a vision of him he saw himself descending down in here and there was Darkness it was a bottomless feet a lot of dreads and then he was crying then he said oh God and when he promised to go there to come and become a good boy he later on came back to Consciousness and then he took time being treated until he recovered then the next one so he started this ministry in 1932. after he had got saved there are so many things to talk about but I would interest you I know yes to read the life story of Brothers praise the name of our Lord now let us go to 1960 19. 33 that's number seven so in 19 Ethiopia and then you tell them do you know that even the second world war God has talked about it before it happens and when brother Branham was seeing this God would show him the name he conquered the country when he went back to Italy they threw him out it got fulfilled praise the name of Allah and then now the second world war what happened he said he saw he said the younger Australian called Hitler yeah and then he brought the whole world to you know into the second world war and second world was set in 1939 to 1945 but these things God had shown brother this is a major world events history now God was showing them to brother brother before they would happen you know all of them being communism kind of becoming the dominant one um then the fourth Vision he showed advances in technology until they developed a kind of a car which is like an egg now at that time technology was so long but right now they are developing cars in those developed countries and those cars don't you may not need the steering nowadays in America in America they have developed that car where you just sit and he moves so when it reaches a junction it stops when there is a kind in front of it it stops if there is a car coming to knock it okay it is praise the name of our Lord he saw things that are to be yeah you can tell people all these things that are happening now God revealed them to the prophet of this you can interest them in the message now if God would reveal them to these things how about the things you know he saw how women would become undressed now it is almost everywhere in those developed countries people don't want to put on dresses they don't care how they are moving then in some countries they have a day where people move naked without a pant without a bra with emotions but right now tell me the dread of Madness again and the vulgar thinks are the ones which are highly marketable hey people want to get more views on every single world like you get somebody on Tick Tock just put something funny and then he wants to attract many people to watch it on whatever kind of platform foreign you know he saw that in America There Rose up a beautiful woman leading the country now in that time in 1933 women were not voting or they were not participating in elections but now he's seeing that somebody has taken over everything and right now you see what's happening these things have been fulfilled now that's the sixth Vision now the seventh Vision because all these other things have been forced but number seven is not yet fulfilled but how close is number seven being full then he says he had a most terrible explosion and as it turned he saw nothing but debris creators and smoke no mercy all over the land of America America that's the last Vision no question by you and by the time Russia blows America because that's what God showed him that Russia Russia will destroy America now you see what's happening in Europe Russia Russia because it didn't want America to put you know they call them or Shields nuclear Shields some a military what close to its borders so when Ukraine was now being taken into the European Union like the Western World of course many years they've been negotiating and things have been failing so Russia started attacking Ukraine Russia and then Ukraine started getting weapons from other countries and the mercenaries now of about three or so times last year leaders from Russia they were coming out and saying we have nuclear weapons and we are going to destroy America foreign now these are things brother Branham talked about in 1933 not showing him these things and now these men have come and they're saying we have everything is said but now I before that can happen because there is the name of Allah the Rapture must take place so the question is where are we foreign what are we doing today are we preparing ourselves how is our house is our house in order have we put everything in place because it is all those other countries religions are united religions I think last year also there was that thing of uniting abrahamic religions because Muslims believe in Abraham Christians believe in Abraham and even now and even now Jews believe in Abraham in the Arab world I think it is United Arab Emirates they built they have said they're setting up a place where all religions of the world can worship from one place foreign every other time buddhistawa what is it it's all about make sure the devil rules the world physically Revelations chapter 13. they are coming here to pass the man of sin um to sit on his throne and be worshiped like God so what time are we living here but all these things God has made them known to us through the minutes of our brothers so you have something to tell somebody challenging them the Lord has done this the Lord has done this praise the name of us let us go to to 1946. okay before you go there we did us go to number eight just below number eight so when brother Branham was baptizing so you can click on it so when brother Brandon was baptizing he had had a gospel kind of you know where many people had accepted the Lord Jesus as his their personal savior baptizing on River Ohio so when he was baptizing the 17th a light came from heaven and then he came where he was baptizing and then the voice saying it was praise the name of Allah that has John the Baptist was sent foreign you know just as you look what a plant growing praise the name you know when you plant a seed well same years ago you remember in the darker ages how worship was complete true worship was destroyed and then God started raising that seed to grow up during the ministry of Martin Luther who was our martini and he started preaching the just shall lived by friends so it was the seed growing and then when it comes to John Wesley praise the name of our Lord then he preached about sanctification they just shall live by faith praise the name of our Lord so the plant was growing praise the name of Allah like if we can go to Mark chapter 4. and then in verse 26. we shall get back to that website and so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and Rise night and day and decision spring and grow up he knows not how much is and should sleep okay verse 28. for the year the Earth brings forth fast fourth fruit of ourself first the blood then the ear and after the full cone in the ear and see praise the name of Allah now so God himself started raising this scene and the first it was the blade and then brother Branham calls that justification the time of Martin Luther Martin Luther praise the name of Allah the time of Martin Luther Martin Luther it grew up praise the name of our Lord into because he calls the blood the tassel he calls the blood then he calls the tassel or the pollen yeah so in the Sandstone Church started growing then in the Philadelphia Philadelphia it you know it was putting on that kind of you know air yeah all the pollen you know so now after that then there was the restoration of gifts you remember in 1906 there was the Holy Ghost falling on Azusa Street and then they were speaking in tongues the restoration of gifts praise the name of Allah now this is why I want to take some bit of attention you know the baptism of the holies but the baptism of the holy spirit is not the climax of this foreign [Music] and the Bible says let us go praise the name of Allah let us go to the book of Hebrews chapter six Hebrews chapter six and I think it is verse 1. praise the name of our Lord Hebrews chapter 6 and verse one and then we read it he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let me read and then you read therefore living the principles of the doctor Christ of repentance from the dwarks and of face toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on hands and of resurrection of the day and of Eternal judgment characters foreign it's a foundation repentance is foundation baptism is foundation that's what I'm saying baptism in waters is a foundation praise the name of it so our our Capstone our climax the purpose of this message is the change of our bodies we are in the second Exodus whether we understand Exodus the first exercise they were leaving Egypt from a physical land to a physical life the second Exodus our Lord Jesus Christ was leading them from religions a spiritual condition which is Fallen to the baptism of the Holy Spirit now here in the Sunday is the change of our bodies that's the full kind of redemption that's the purpose of this message that's what we have received and that is our our emphasis that's our emphasis you must have the life of Jesus Christ and to have the life of Jesus Christ God wants to harvest a mature fruit praise the name of Allah and when it starts putting foreign the hollow plant becomes dry color and this is what's happening the denominations now all dry why why because the life of Jesus Christ that's what's happening you know you go to their churches foreign [Music] not only that but even their lives it's so different from the others shall not be here the shark is dry it's the mature praise the name of our Lord there is a pastor there who comes from another Pastor brought him for the meetings and then now he was telling us that is fellow pastors there he told them that he has read the Bible they told him you are going to become mad foreign there is no life we need to come where our life is and life is only in the message we are at the time of maturity we're in the time of harvest that the city that went into the ground is the one that has to be harvested this is the message this is the message that God has given so God knew how this generation is going to be and he sent us a prophet in our day praise the name of Allah he sent us a prophet in our day proclaiming the truth declaring the truth God knowing the end from the beginning so he has declared these things so we know where we stand we directly praise the name of Allah so the message that we have prepares us for the second coming of them the message that we have prepares the message that we have makes us the Bride of Jesus Christ makes us the Bride of Jesus Christ so the message is washing us the message is praise the name of our Lord you need to take it seriously and when you have received it tell us invite another person share with them the goodness share with them What the Lord Has Done in our days God has declare them to us foreign so here brother Branham he was so desperate you know because other people were telling him the gift that you have are from the devil most of preachers who are telling him so he said let me go and wait on the Lord and let the Lord speak to me he told his wife I'm going I don't know if I'm going to come back so he went into prayer [Music] and then he kept on praying Lord what is this why don't you take it away from me I don't understand why I'm late kept on praying and then now in the night he saw a light appearing a small light coming down as it became bigger okay and finally the light stood before him like a ball of light okay and then you told him I'm sent from the presence of God praise the name of it and then the angel told him I've come to tell you your strange life that you've been sent to the world with a gift to the people and the angel told him go and tell the people of the world that they are thoughts are hard louder than their words in heaven is interested in that I didn't date you you told him started explaining to him based on the scripture and showing him this and then the angel told him you are sent to the world with two signs foreign foreign two signs now okay the fastest sign to us on the body the second sign was on the human spirit and then you know the first design are coming after soccer the first people soccer the second sign the second poll score but they start the pool will speak the world a higher level speak the word what do you have need I give to your children like before sister I give you your son when the sister Meda was in hospital before the doctors let the tumor disappear when he was hunting and he needed then the voice then the voice told him then it came then he shot it yeah goes to the song and it's the climax the highest climax the level the Lord has brought us that you receive the word of God and that word transforms and that's the word translation even your words they become of you as good as the word of the master praise the name of God this is what the Lord wants us to grow up that you just speak and happen but he wants to change your mind I want to take over your mind take over your heart once take over all your your passions praise the name of that so the two signs happening praise the name of Allah they've got fulfilled in the ministry of brother Branham um you know and then the Angels told him that these things because he told him that let the people believe you so he gave him the two signs and told him as Moses was sent with two sons and they come to pass blessed be the name of our Lord so the message that we have God has confirmed it praise the name of Allah with a lot of Spanish praise the name of our Lord declaring the end from the beginning coming in our generation telling us the things that are going to be here so you need to take it with all your heart not only taking it with your heart tell somebody about What the Lord Has Done In Our Generation the Lord has sent us a prophet the Lord has given us a message prepare the message prepare us then number 11. when he was preaching the second sign appeared and all through his ministry he had the ability now this way I want to come again now discernment of the spirit is the sign of the Messiah praise the name of Allah are you hearing me the discernment of the spirit like it the person would stand before him and then he would descend it is a sign of the Messiah he remembered the woman in John chapter 4 he says when the Messiah comes he will tell us what did he say I am he says oh you are Peter Peter the son of Jonas how did he know that his name was his name is Simon how do you know that his father is Jonas and then now when he meets let us go to John chapter 1. praise the name of Allah and then verse 40.
