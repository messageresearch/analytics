[40:54] they are very few
[40:56] here. So I'll allow them one by one to
[41:01] mention the name
[41:04] and the church. You don't give a
[41:07] preacher time to say two words.

[42:58] All of us behind here.
[43:07] [Applause]
[43:09] We thank God for this.
[43:12] [Applause]
[43:16] The Lord has blessed them.
[43:21] They are not ashamed of the gospel.
[43:25] Amen. Amen. and neither they ashamed of
[43:28] the messenger.

[43:35] my friend.
[43:40] Praise the Lord. So these are brothers
[43:45] that we work with
[43:48] in the different areas.
[43:51] The Lord has been fishing them out.
[43:55] one man at a time.
[43:58] And they go looking for one another.
[44:01] Amen. And every day the multiplier
[44:05] effect is so big.
[44:09] So we pray one time we are going to get
[44:12] them here
[44:14] and their
[44:16] and their flocks.
[44:19] We don't know where we shall fit,
[44:22] but we shall try. Let us wave to each
[44:26] other from here to there.
[44:29] Amen. God bless you so much. These are
[44:32] the men you have to pray for
[44:34] all the time. They are waving to you.
[44:39] Have you seen? Okay, you pray for them.
[44:42] So, we don't have time to mention them
[44:45] name by name.
[44:47] They are not few. But may the Lord bless
[44:50] them. AMEN. AMEN.
[44:58] [Applause]
[45:05] PRAISE THE LORD.
[45:08] AMEN. I encouraged brother James.
[45:13] I encouraged brother James
[45:17] that on your church platform
[45:22] he should be posting wherever we go.
[45:27] Sometimes we see brother James back in
[45:29] church
[45:32] but we may not know where he has been
[45:34] through the week.
[45:37] That man goes to Nakasola,
[45:40] goes to Bali,
[45:43] goes to Chiboga
[45:45] and on Sunday he comes here
[45:48] like he has been nowhere.
[45:52] But the Lord
[45:54] is giving him grace.
[45:57] Amen. Amen. We appreciate brothers like
[46:00] SA
[46:02] and different ones who have spent their
[46:06] time.
[46:07] Amen. And trying to reach out for the
[46:10] others.
[46:12] God bless you so much.
[46:15] Amen. Amen.
[46:17] So we do not have much time
[46:22] and uh we want to get ready to hear from
[46:25] the Lord again.
[46:29] The Lord knows which angle he wants us
[46:31] to go.
[46:33] You know, sometimes I get to the pulpit
[46:37] and I don't know what I'm going to
[46:39] preach.
[46:41] And then I have two services sometimes.
[46:45] And then when I come down here, you hear
[46:48] the singing or the direction or the need
[46:52] of the people,
[46:55] you just go to another service again.
[46:58] And sometimes
[47:00] in between there something happens that
[47:04] you go another angling.
[47:07] Like yesterday when I was preaching the
[47:09] funeral
[47:11] I just decided to I read the scriptures
[47:15] but after reading the scripture I found
[47:18] out I could not use it.
[47:21] The speakers went bad.
[47:26] Amen. But finally I discovered God was
[47:29] taking me another angle
[47:32] and I just decided to speak to the
[47:34] people
[47:36] and I believe there was somebody God who
[47:38] was talking.
[47:40] Amen. So God bless you as we welcome our
[47:44] brother. Let's stand up and give the
[47:47] Lord a hand of praise as our brother
[47:49] comes.
[47:51] Amen.
[47:52] Praise God. You're welcome my brother.
[47:55] God bless you so much.
[48:04] Amen.
[48:05] [Applause]
[48:09] Christ.
[48:12] Amen. Amen. These are wonderful God.
[48:17] Amen. Amen. These are wonderful God.
[48:21] Wonderful people.
[48:24] Amen. God bless you.
[48:26] What a what a privilege to see uh that
[48:29] God is uh um uh still using and speaking
[48:34] to people.
[48:39] I come from Germany
[48:41] and we have in Germany we have 85
[48:43] million people
[48:46] 85 million
[48:49] I think double size of population than
[48:51] you have in Uganda.
[48:55] And we have only about a thousand
[48:58] believers.
[49:01] We have only about 10 to 12 churches.
[49:06] You see how that stirs my heart when I
[49:08] see so many ministers.
[49:13] We have in whole Germany we have not so
[49:15] many ministers and that is gathered here
[49:17] together.
[49:21] So, so God is good to us.
[49:24] Amen. God is good to you.
[49:30] Never take that for granted.
[49:33] It's just God's grace to us.
[49:36] Amen. Amen. Amen. So, uh, may the Lord
[49:39] bless you.
[49:41] Amen. We just straight want to go back
[49:42] into the word.
[49:45] That's why we are here. Amen.
[49:47] Amen. And as this morning I was just uh
[49:50] drawn to total aside.
[49:56] Amen. I think you have uh seen and felt
[49:58] that.
[50:02] So the Lord knows
[50:04] and we are so happy that we serve a
[50:06] living God.
[50:08] Amen. Amen. We want to go back to the
[50:10] same scripture.
[50:13] We want to read uh you want to read uh
[50:16] or maybe we start with Genesis 12.
[50:24] Amen.
[50:25] Amen.
[50:26] As we want to look in the life of
[50:29] Gideon, of Abraham, not of Gideon, but
[50:31] of Abraham.
[50:34] But it's just the generation that is
[50:36] here.
[50:39] Hallelujah.
[50:39] Amen.
[50:41] Amen.
[50:41] Amen. the generation of Jesus Christ.
[50:45] It began with Abraham
[50:48] alpha
[50:49] and now we come to the omega.
[50:51] Hallelujah.
[50:52] Hallelujah.
[50:53] That's the same as it was with the
[50:54] alpha.
[50:56] So is it now in the omega?
[50:59] Amen. Alpha and omega is the same.
[51:02] That's why you can put your life in that
[51:06] principle of of Abraham.
[51:08] what happened happened to Abraham
[51:11] is happening to the elect bride of Jesus
[51:13] Christ
[51:15] and the greatest thing at the end of
[51:17] Abraham's life
[51:20] was when God tested him. So the greatest
[51:24] thing in your life before going home is
[51:28] that God will test you
[51:31] and by that test
[51:33] he will prove who you really are.
[51:40] Hallelujah.
[51:40] Hallelujah.
[51:41] Amen.
[51:42] Amen.
[51:42] I trust I can speak like this to you.
[51:46] Amen.
[51:46] Even if you are just uh only not so many
[51:49] years familiar with the things,
[51:53] but I believe there's workers, we call
[51:57] them the 11 hour workers,
[52:01] they get the same salary.
[52:07] They hear the same sermons.
[52:11] Amen. Amen.
[52:12] And what some of us have waited for so
[52:14] many years to get to it,
[52:18] now you are confronted with it.
[52:21] Amen. Amen.
[52:22] Amen. May the Lord bless you richly.
[52:26] Amen.
[52:26] Amen.
[52:27] So don't feel it strange.
[52:30] I say that at home and he also I don't
[52:32] want to preach to um actually you know
[52:35] we know one another from before the
[52:37] foundation of the world
[52:43] if you give it a little time
[52:46] you find out it is true. Amen. Let's
[52:48] turn to Genesis 12.
[52:52] Amen. As we have we just want to read
[52:54] and then Genesis 15 also again or
[52:57] Genesis 22 maybe.
[53:00] Genesis 12. Here it starts with Abraham.
[53:04] Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get
[53:07] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[53:10] kindred, and from thy father's house
[53:12] unto a land that I will show thee."
[53:22] Amen. Amen. As Bible readers,
[53:26] we know Paul would say later
[53:30] that Abraham were looking for a city.
[53:36] Here God told him, "Go in a land that I
[53:41] will show thee." Abraham, Paul said
[53:44] later
[53:46] that Abraham were looking for a city.
[53:50] Amen. Amen.
[53:52] Amen. And you're with me?
[53:54] Amen. Amen.
[53:55] So it was a land
[53:57] and yet it was a city. Amen. So it was
[54:00] just when God started with Abraham,
[54:04] he gave him a bright view.
[54:08] As just things went closer,
[54:11] he get more focused on what it was.
[54:15] Finally,
[54:17] he came to recognize
[54:19] that he was a part of that city.
[54:22] Amen.
[54:23] Hallelujah.
[54:23] Hallelujah.
[54:24] Amen. That is our journey.
[54:26] Okay. And then let's go to Genesis 22.
[54:30] Genesis 22.
[54:33] We want to read again.
[54:36] Uh after these things.
[54:40] Amen. Amen.
[54:41] And as a prophet would let us know
[54:44] can give you the quote for it.
[54:47] Brother Rana would say we are brought to
[54:51] a test.
[54:52] The seed of Abraham today is brought to
[54:55] that test.
[54:58] Will we take God's words
[55:01] or we take what man said about
[55:04] we are brought to a test.
[55:07] Amen. Amen. Like Abraham is brought to a
[55:09] test.
[55:11] After these things,
[55:14] it came to pass that God did tempt
[55:17] Abraham
[55:18] and said unto Abraham,
[55:21] and he said, Behold, here I am.
[55:25] And he said, Now take now thine son,
[55:27] thine only son Isaac, in whom thou
[55:30] lovest, and get thee into the land of
[55:32] Moriah, and offer him therefore a burnt
[55:35] offering upon the one of the mountains
[55:37] which I will show thee of.
[55:53] [Music]
[56:00] [Music]
[56:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Let us
[56:08] pray together.
[56:10] Heavenly Father, Father, we have read
[56:12] your word again, Father, and now we just
[56:15] pray that you open up that word to us.
[56:18] Anoint thy word, I pray. Anoint thy
[56:21] servant as we stand here. Anoint the
[56:25] people, Father, the speaker and the
[56:27] hearer, that we will hear from you, oh
[56:30] God. We commit ourselves into your
[56:33] hands, the service into your hands in
[56:36] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[56:39] Amen.
[56:39] Amen. Amen.
[56:40] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[56:43] We could read much more.
[56:46] Amen. But I think we have read this
[56:47] morning already a little bit
[56:50] and we want to uh we want to continue
[56:52] with that thought on uh on uh uh
[56:56] Abraham's or our journey
[57:00] to all things.
[57:02] Amen. Amen.
[57:03] We believe we are according to uh
[57:06] promise.
[57:08] We are heir of all things.
[57:11] Amen. Amen. And now we are on our way to
[57:14] all things
[57:17] to the to the situation where all things
[57:19] are possible
[57:21] as Abraham was there
[57:24] as Abraham was on his way
[57:27] on his journey. Amen. And and so
[57:30] wonderful how God starts the journey.
[57:34] The Bible said it it started not even
[57:36] with a vision.
[57:39] It's just started that God talks spoke
[57:41] to Abraham
[57:44] and you know God knows h how he how he
[57:47] needs to talk to you
[57:50] that you are listening. Is that right?
[57:54] God knows exactly how he has to talk to
[57:55] you. So God was talking to Abraham
[58:00] in a way that Abraham understood him.
[58:04] And God said, "Okay, Abraham,
[58:07] leave your father and your mother.
[58:10] Leave your denomination."
[58:12] You know, Abraham was busy in idolatry.
[58:18] His father was making little idols for
[58:22] worship.
[58:24] Abraham's father was an idol worshipper.
[58:28] So they did make idols
[58:31] and Abraham was helping him
[58:34] and ONE DAY GOD JUST SPOKE TO HIM.
[58:37] Is it not our testimony?
[58:41] One day God just spoke to us
[58:45] AND GOD KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO GET YOUR
[58:48] ATTENTION.
[58:50] He knew exactly how to get Abraham's
[58:53] attention.
[58:55] How God spoke to him, we don't know. God
[58:59] can speak in different ways.
[59:02] But finally
[59:04] God get his attention.
[59:07] So he was listening.
[59:09] AND SO THIS IS OUR STORY, isn't it?
[59:12] WHO CAN SAY THAT GOD one day spoke to
[59:14] him?
[59:16] Amen. Did God spoke to you?
[59:21] I trust God spoke to you that you are
[59:24] not here because of men. That you are
[59:28] here because God brought you here.
[59:31] Yes, GOD IS USING MEN. GOD SPEAKS
[59:34] THROUGH MEN. GOD HAS A VARIOUS WAY.
[59:38] GOD SPEAK CAN EVEN SPEAK THROUGH A
[59:40] DONKEY.
[59:42] WE remember the days of Ba Ba Baum.
[59:46] GOD COULD SPEAK THROUGH A DONKEY
[59:49] TO BALAM. SO GOD CAN SPEAK HOWEVER HE
[59:51] WANTS
[59:53] to get your attention.
[59:56] So that's our story. I think this is
[59:58] where we ALL CAN SAY THAT'S WHY WE are
[1:00:01] here because God spoke to us. Amen. The
[1:00:06] way started
[1:00:07] AND LOOK HOW THE WAY STARTED WITH
[1:00:09] ABRAHAM
[1:00:10] AND JUST ENJOY how God is doing things.
[1:00:14] GOD IS NOT GIVING YOU EVERYTHING FROM
[1:00:17] THE BEGINNING.
[1:00:20] BECAUSE GOD KNOW EXACTLY
[1:00:22] YOU CANNOT HANDLE
[1:00:25] AS A LITTLE CHILD. YOU CANNOT GIVE HIM
[1:00:28] EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE CANNOT HANDLE
[1:00:30] THINGS. SO AS YOU ARE BORN AND WE ARE
[1:00:34] WHEN YOU ARE BORN AGAIN
[1:00:37] YOU ARE A BABY IN CHRIST AND GOD KNOWS
[1:00:40] EXACTLY
[1:00:41] HOW TO GIVE THINGS TO YOU, WHAT TO SPEAK
[1:00:44] TO YOU, HOW TO DEAL WITH YOU. AMEN. HE
[1:00:48] KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO GET YOUR DREAM.
[1:00:51] HE KNOWS WHERE YOU COME FROM. HE KNOWS
[1:00:53] YOUR PARENTS. HE KNOWS YOUR PAST. HE
[1:00:57] KNOWS YOUR GRANDPARENTS.
[1:00:59] HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
[1:01:04] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:05] HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
[1:01:10] SO HE KNOWS EXACTLY
[1:01:12] HOW TO get to you, WHOM TO SEND TO YOU,
[1:01:18] WHAT TO GIVE TO YOU THAT YOUR ATTENTION
[1:01:21] IS ON IT.
[1:01:24] AMEN. Isn't that amazing that Abraham
[1:01:28] listened?
[1:01:29] ABRAHAM WAS NOT A BELIEVER.
[1:01:34] ABRAHAM CAME FROM A FAMILY OF IDOLATRY
[1:01:39] AND YET GOD GET HIS ATTENTION.
[1:01:44] It's it LOOKS SO EASY.
[1:01:46] GOD SPOKE TO HIM. DID GOD SPOKE TO YOU
[1:01:49] IN THIS HOUR?
[1:01:52] WHO CAN SAY GOD SPOKE TO ME?
[1:01:56] I trust everybody can say that.
[1:01:58] Amen. Then God is pulling you.
[1:02:01] Amen. SO WHEN GOD AND GOD STARTS,
[1:02:05] THIS IS OUR STORY. THIS WAS ABRAHAM'S
[1:02:08] STORY.
[1:02:09] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE'S DOING TO
[1:02:12] SARAH AND ABRAHAM.
[1:02:15] He said coming along THIS WAY
[1:02:18] JUST LIKE HE PROMISED TO DO TO THEIR
[1:02:20] SEEDS and he HAS DONE IT. I CAN PROVE IT
[1:02:25] EXACTLY THE STEPS THAT ABRAHAM TOOK.
[1:02:31] AMEN. NOW LOOK WHERE HE'S AT HERE. WHEN
[1:02:34] THIS GOD COME AND TALK TO HIM.
[1:02:38] AMEN. GOD COME AND TALK TO HIM. GOD TOLD
[1:02:41] HIM ABRAHAM GET OUT OF YOUR COUNTRY.
[1:02:47] SEPARATE FROM YOUR FATHER AND
[1:02:52] AMEN.
[1:02:53] AND AND THEN GO INTO THE LAND THAT I
[1:02:55] WILL SHOW THEE.
[1:02:58] AND WE KNOW ALL THE END OF ABRAHAM.
[1:03:03] You know WHAT IT REALLY WAS.
[1:03:06] BUT IF HE WOULD TELL ABRAHAM EVERYTHING
[1:03:08] FROM THE BEGINNING,
[1:03:12] ABRAHAM COULD NOT HAVE HANDLED IT.
[1:03:15] IF GOD WOULD TELL YOU FROM THE BEGINNING
[1:03:19] WHAT HIS PLAN IS with you,
[1:03:22] YOU COULDN'T handle it.
[1:03:25] Amen.
[1:03:26] WHEN THE MESSAGE COME YOUR WAY,
[1:03:29] WHEN THE MESSAGE SPEAKS TO YOU,
[1:03:32] IT shows it shows it shows that you are
[1:03:38] special.
[1:03:42] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:43] IT SHOWS THAT GOD HAS A SPECIAL PURPOSE
[1:03:46] WITH YOU.
[1:03:49] HE DOES NOT SEND THE MESSAGE TO
[1:03:51] EVERYONE.
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:56] THAT'S WHY THE MESSAGE IS NOT SPEAKING
[1:04:00] TO EVERYONE.
[1:04:04] IS IT RIGHT? WE HAVE 78 BILLION PEOPLE
[1:04:08] ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
[1:04:12] And look
[1:04:19] AND LOOK HOW MANY HOW LITTLE
[1:04:23] HOW FEW PEOPLE THE MESSAGE means
[1:04:27] something to them.
[1:04:33] Yes.
[1:04:35] IT MAY BE ONE IN A MILLION.
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:40] HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:41] HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:41] AMEN.
[1:04:42] YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE WAS, AS A PROPHET
[1:04:45] WOULD SAY, THERE WAS THAT GREAT UH THAT
[1:04:49] THERE WAS THAT GREAT uh chicken barn.
[1:04:52] [Applause]
[1:04:56] WHERE THERE WERE A LOT OF EGGS.
[1:05:00] AMEN. A lot of chicken eggs
[1:05:05] and THERE WAS ONLY ONE EGG.
[1:05:08] SOMEHOW IT GET THERE.
[1:05:10] Somehow the eagle egg get there.
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:17] The eagle egg DID NOT PUT HIMSELF THERE.
[1:05:22] YOU DID NOT PUT YOURSELF WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:05:27] God ordained you.
[1:05:31] YOU COULDN'T CHOOSE THE COUNTRY where
[1:05:33] you were born in.
[1:05:37] You couldn't choose the gender that you
[1:05:39] were born with.
[1:05:44] It's God's choice.
[1:05:46] IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION.
[1:05:49] Is it right?
[1:05:51] SO WE HAD SO MANY EGGS AND JUST ONE
[1:05:53] EAGLE EGG.
[1:05:56] NOW WATCH NOW AS AS AS ALL EGGS GET get
[1:06:01] finally uh you know uh the babies came
[1:06:04] out
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:08] and NOW THEY WERE SLOWLY GROWING
[1:06:10] TOGETHER.
[1:06:13] One day
[1:06:16] THE PROPHET WOULD TELL US
[1:06:18] THAT MAMA OR PAPA EAGLE
[1:06:22] KNEW THERE WAS SOMEWHERE AN EGG.
[1:06:28] AMEN.
[1:06:29] AND GOD KNEW THAT YOU WERE SOMEWHERE
[1:06:35] AND THEN THE EAGLE STARTS FLYING.
[1:06:40] AND AS THE EAGLE WERE FLYING,
[1:06:43] HE LET OUT A SCREAM,
[1:06:49] HE LET OUT A MESSAGE
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:54] and only THE EAGLE
[1:06:57] WAS ATTRACTED.
[1:07:02] THE CHICKENS
[1:07:04] WHEN THE CHICKENS HEAR AN EAGLE SCREAM,
[1:07:09] THEY become afraid.
[1:07:15] Amen.
[1:07:16] And when BUT WHEN AN EAGLE HEARS an
[1:07:19] eagle scream,
[1:07:22] HE LOOKS UP BECAUSE HIS REDEMPTION
[1:07:26] IS DRAWING NIGH.
[1:07:29] THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR
[1:07:32] EVERYONE.
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:35] THIS MESSAGE IS ONLY FOR THE ELECT.
[1:07:39] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:41] CAN YOU UNDERSTAND
[1:07:43] HOW GOD IS TALKING TO YOU
[1:07:47] or God IS SPEAKING TO YOU BECAUSE HE
[1:07:50] SENT YOU A MESSAGE AND YOU GET
[1:07:52] ATTRACTED.
[1:07:54] YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN
[1:07:56] SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU HERE IN THE TOP.
[1:08:00] YOU MAY SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[1:08:03] BUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART IT'S SAYING
[1:08:06] THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.
[1:08:08] IT SOUNDS THE TRUTH.
[1:08:10] YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT HERE IN THE
[1:08:12] CHURCH.
[1:08:13] YOUR BRAIN IS TOO SMALL FOR IT.
[1:08:16] BUT YOUR HEART WILL PULL YOU IN.
[1:08:19] YOUR HEART WILL SAY YES
[1:08:22] BEFORE YOUR BRAIN SAYS YES.
[1:08:28] HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:28] HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:29] AMEN.
[1:08:30] AMEN.
[1:08:30] AMEN.

[1:08:42] Amen. EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS TRYING TO
[1:08:46] MAKE SURE
[1:08:48] THAT YOU NEVER COME TO YOUR TRUE
[1:08:50] IDENTITY.
[1:08:52] THE DEVIL NEVER WANTS YOU TO UNDERSTAND
[1:08:56] YOUR TRUE IDENTITY.
[1:08:59] LIKE THE CHICKENS, THEY NEVER THEY NEVER
[1:09:02] WANT THE SMALL EAGLE
[1:09:05] TO BECOME MATURES.
[1:09:07] THEY ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP HIM SMALL.
[1:09:11] YOU KNOW WHY? CHICKENS UNDERSTAND
[1:09:14] AN EAGLE BECOMES BIG.
[1:09:17] BIG EAGLES
[1:09:19] EAT CHICKENS.
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:24] THE DEVIL UNDERSTANDS.
[1:09:27] THE DEVIL UNDERSTANDS AND YOU BECOME
[1:09:29] BIG. YOU EAT THEM.
[1:09:34] DID NOT JOSHUA
[1:09:36] AND CALEB
[1:09:38] SPEAK ABOUT THE ENEMIES IN THE PROMISED
[1:09:41] LAND?
[1:09:42] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? THEY ARE OUR
[1:09:44] FOOD.
[1:09:47] [Applause]
[1:09:52] HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:53] AND YOU UNDERSTAND COMING BACK to back
[1:09:57] to the simple,
[1:09:59] God knows how to speak TO YOU. HE KNOWS
[1:10:02] HOW to get TO YOUR ATTENTION.
[1:10:04] BUT YOU UNDERSTAND AS WE KNOW THE STORY
[1:10:07] OF ABRAHAM.
[1:10:09] THIS IS OUR STORY. THIS IS MY STORY THAT
[1:10:13] I CAN IDENTIFY MYSELF.
[1:10:16] AND I KNOW THE END THAT HE HAS
[1:10:18] WILL BE THE END THAT I HAVE.
[1:10:22] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THE END HE HAS
[1:10:25] IS MY END.
[1:10:27] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:28] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:28] I WILL BE CHANGED LIKE HE WAS CHANGED. I
[1:10:31] WILL BRING FORTH THE SON LIKE HE BROUGHT
[1:10:33] FORTH THE SUN.
[1:10:36] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:37] GOD told him in the beginning.
[1:10:40] Sorry when I get excited. Sorry when I
[1:10:42] get excited.
[1:10:44] Amen. But something that stirs me
[1:10:48] and I'm emotional.
[1:10:50] AMEN. I BELIEVE WHEN WE ARE ON THE OTHER
[1:10:53] SIDE.
[1:10:55] I believe when we are ON THE OTHER SIDE
[1:10:58] THERE WILL BE A NOISE
[1:11:00] SHOUTING AND
[1:11:03] I DECIDED MYSELF
[1:11:06] I start already with
[1:11:09] BROTHER RAM SAID BROTHER RAM SAID PRAY
[1:11:13] Lord brother Ram prayed that the prophet
[1:11:17] prayed it.
[1:11:19] HE SAID LORD HELP ME TO WORSHIP YOU
[1:11:24] ON THIS SIDE AS IF I WOULD BE ALREADY ON
[1:11:27] THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:33] ON THE OTHER SIDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK
[1:11:35] ME. SHOUTS.
[1:11:41] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:42] SO WHEN YOU WANT SEE WHO YOU ARE,
[1:11:45] I KNOW THERE'S A TIME OF JUBILEE FOR THE
[1:11:48] CHURCH.
[1:11:50] OF SINGING A NEW SONG.
[1:11:55] HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:56] HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:56] AMEN.
[1:11:58] JUST LET THE DEVIL KNOW on what side you
[1:12:01] are standing.
[1:12:07] Let the devil know
[1:12:10] on what side you are standing.
[1:12:14] Amen.
[1:12:16] Sometimes he WANT TO PUSH YOU
[1:12:18] ON THE SIDE of the loser,
[1:12:25] BUT SHOW HIM ON WHAT SIDE YOU ARE
[1:12:28] STANDING.
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:34] Confuse the enemy.
[1:12:40] Confuse him like Jesus confused him.
[1:12:44] Jesus total confused them.
[1:12:49] Amen.
[1:12:50] TOTAL.
[1:12:52] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:52] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:53] So you CAN DO THE SAME.
[1:12:56] YOU CAN CONFUSE THE ENEMY.
[1:12:58] And you are not pretending.
[1:13:01] YOU KNOW THE END.
[1:13:04] YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WILL BE. YOU KNOW
[1:13:06] YOUR FUTURE
[1:13:09] BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR DESTINY.
[1:13:12] IF YOU KNOW YOUR DESTINY,
[1:13:15] IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM, YOU
[1:13:17] KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING.
[1:13:19] [Applause]
[1:13:22] That's why we are not pretending.
[1:13:26] SATAN KNOWS EXACTLY
[1:13:28] if you are pretending or not.
[1:13:32] You cannot intimidate him.
[1:13:35] He knows exactly.
[1:13:37] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND JESUS WAS
[1:13:41] NOT INTIMIDATING.
[1:13:44] YET WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS,
[1:13:47] HE CRIED, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU
[1:13:51] FORSAKEN ME?" HE KNEW WHO he was.
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:57] He stood before the temple
[1:13:59] and he said, he said, "Break this temple
[1:14:01] down and in three days I will rise it up
[1:14:05] again." HE KNEW WHO HE WAS.
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:10] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:10] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:11] AND so the church today,
[1:14:13] ABRAHAM FINALLY understood
[1:14:17] who he was.
[1:14:19] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:20] AND THEN GOD COULD TEST HIM WITH THE
[1:14:22] WORDS.
[1:14:24] Then God could test him.
[1:14:30] Yes.
[1:14:32] Hallelujah.
[1:14:33] Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] Amen.
[1:14:34] Amen. And can you imagine what kind of
[1:14:38] test that was?
[1:14:40] Can you imagine
[1:14:42] how hell was confused?
[1:14:51] I trust we are so far.
[1:14:54] I trust we are all so far.
[1:14:58] And I speak to each and everyone
[1:15:02] has been matured.
[1:15:05] Because I know you are the 11th hour
[1:15:08] worker.
[1:15:11] Amen.
[1:15:13] Yes. And they become they become the
[1:15:16] same salary.
[1:15:23] Come on church. THEY HEAR THE SAME
[1:15:26] VALUES WORDS.
[1:15:31] AND SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE COMPLAINING.
[1:15:35] WE WORK FOR AGES
[1:15:38] AND NOW WE ARE ABLE TO HEAR IT. AND
[1:15:41] THOSE WORKERS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME AND
[1:15:45] THEY HEAR THE SAME MESSAGE.
[1:15:47] [Applause]
[1:15:50] WHAT DID THE LORD SAY?
[1:15:52] IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS. That's my
[1:15:55] choosing.
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:00] Amen.
[1:16:01] Hallelujah.
[1:16:01] Hallelujah. So I FEEL IT'S JUST SUCH A
[1:16:03] PRIVILEGE.
[1:16:05] Sometimes people tell me at home, you
[1:16:08] must be careful what to say to the
[1:16:09] church.
[1:16:11] But there's a lot of young people.
[1:16:14] They don't understand that. I said,
[1:16:17] okay, HOW LONG SHALL WE WAIT?
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:22] Because in 10 years
[1:16:24] we have another young people.
[1:16:27] We have more YOUNG PEOPLE.
[1:16:32] Shall we wait? How long shall we wait?
[1:16:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:43] So if you are now the new people,
[1:16:46] HOW LONG SHALL we wait?
[1:16:49] THE RAPTURE IS JUST ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
[1:16:54] I must be honest with you.
[1:16:57] You need the truth.
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:01] and you will handle the truth.
[1:17:07] Yes, I'm not afraid of that.
[1:17:09] I've seen too many things.
[1:17:12] AMEN. MAYBE YOU CANNOT handle it here,
[1:17:17] but be honest. Your heart will lead you.
[1:17:24] Mary Mary WAS A YOUNG GIRL.
[1:17:29] WAS A YOUNG GIRL AND AN ANGEL CAME to
[1:17:32] her.
[1:17:34] IS THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS A
[1:17:37] VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:41] AMEN.
[1:17:42] AMEN.
[1:17:42] AMEN.
[1:17:43] NOT TOUCHED BY A MAN.
[1:17:46] THAT MEANS SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT
[1:17:50] RECEIVING,
[1:17:53] BEING PREGNANT,
[1:17:55] GIVING BIRTH.
[1:17:57] A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE,
[1:18:01] NOT A MOTHER SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:18:04] YOU UNDERSTAND? SO WHEN THE ANGEL CAME
[1:18:07] TO MARY,
[1:18:08] SHE WAS AS NEW TO THE MESSAGE AS YOU
[1:18:11] ARE.
[1:18:17] SHE HAD NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT,
[1:18:20] NEVER EXPERIENCED IT.
[1:18:26] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:27] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:18:28] AND THEN THE ANGEL SPOKE TO HER. HE
[1:18:31] SAID, "BLESSED ARE YOU."
[1:18:33] CAN I TELL YOU THIS AFTERNOON,
[1:18:35] BLESSED ARE YOU,
[1:18:38] YOU ARE BLESSED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE
[1:18:41] MONEY.
[1:18:43] YOU ARE BLESSED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A
[1:18:45] CAR.
[1:18:47] YOU ARE BLESSED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A
[1:18:49] HOUSE.
[1:18:51] BUT YOU ARE BLESSED BECAUSE YOU ARE
[1:18:53] CHOSEN.
[1:18:56] THAT'S THE MAIN BLESSING TODAY.
[1:19:00] YOUR HOUSE WILL DISAPPEAR.
[1:19:02] YOUR CAR WILL DISAPPEAR.
[1:19:05] YOUR MONEY WILL DISAPPEAR.
[1:19:07] BUT YOUR CHOOSING CAN NEVER DISAPPEAR
[1:19:12] BECAUSE HE HAS CHOSEN YOU FROM BEFORE
[1:19:16] THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:21] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:23] AMEN.
[1:19:23] AMEN. And as that angel came to Mary,
[1:19:27] YOU GET THE PICTURE. CHURCH, YOU GET THE
[1:19:29] PICTURE. A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:19:33] GOD MAKE IT COMPLICATED.
[1:19:37] COMPLICATED.
[1:19:38] HE NEVER SAID A WOMAN SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:19:41] HE NEVER SAID A BROTHER SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:19:44] NOW A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:19:48] THAT NEVER HAD A MAN.
[1:19:51] THAT NEVER HAD SEXUAL AFFAIRS,
[1:19:54] NEVER WAS PREGNANT,
[1:19:56] SHE SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:20:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:02] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:03] YOU UNDERSTAND TODAY WHY IT IS EASY FOR
[1:20:07] YOU TO RECEIVE.
[1:20:13] Oh God, may God help us.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah. MAY GOD HELP US.
[1:20:18] AMEN.
[1:20:18] AMEN.
[1:20:19] HOW GOD KEPT YOU.
[1:20:22] VIRGIN.
[1:20:24] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:30] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:31] Oh my. I trust we get the picture.
[1:20:35] And then Mary had one question
[1:20:38] because you understand that was so
[1:20:41] unusual.
[1:20:44] I'm a young girl.
[1:20:49] I'm new in this message.
[1:20:52] Now the angel comes to me. God speaks to
[1:20:55] me,
[1:20:56] tells me that I'm chosen.
[1:21:00] But you understand
[1:21:02] in the beginning. Mary did not really
[1:21:05] know what that means.
[1:21:14] She didn't know what that really means.
[1:21:17] And God never told her everything from
[1:21:19] the beginning.
[1:21:22] The angel just told her what she needed
[1:21:25] to know.
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:30] Don't worry,
[1:21:33] by and by
[1:21:35] TIME GOES ON, HE WILL UNVEIL more and
[1:21:39] more.
[1:21:42] AND TO YOU THAT ARE THE 11TH HOUR
[1:21:45] WORKERS,
[1:21:46] HE WILL REVEAL IT MORE FASTER.
[1:21:51] WE HAVE NO TIME FOR ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER
[1:21:54] 25 YEARS.
[1:21:56] WE HAVE NO MORE NOT ANOTHER 25 YEARS
[1:21:59] TIME.
[1:22:03] HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:06] Rapture might take place before
[1:22:10] ANY MOMENT
[1:22:12] THE CHANGE OF THE BODY. ANY MOMENT
[1:22:15] IN CHRIST SHALL RISE.
[1:22:19] Can we believe that?
[1:22:21] So the angel told Mary, he said,
[1:22:23] "Blessed are you and I can tell you this
[1:22:26] evening,
[1:22:28] blessed are you. You are a chosen
[1:22:31] generation.
[1:22:33] Amen. A royal priesthood."
[1:22:37] [Music]
[1:22:39] She just had a question. He said, "How
[1:22:41] that happened?"
[1:22:44] And then he just said what she needed to
[1:22:45] know.
[1:22:47] He said, "The Holy Spirit will
[1:22:49] overshadow you
[1:22:51] and what you will receive."
[1:22:53] He never told her of all the difficult
[1:22:56] times that will come.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] He never told her that she later has to
[1:23:07] go to the upper room to RECEIVE THE HOLY
[1:23:08] GHOST.
[1:23:12] She just he just told her what she
[1:23:15] needed to know.
[1:23:17] And this is what God is doing. This is
[1:23:20] what he did to Abraham.
[1:23:23] He just told Abraham.
[1:23:25] He said, "Go and go out of your father.
[1:23:29] Leave your home.
[1:23:32] Leave your home and go to a land that I
[1:23:36] will show thee."
[1:23:38] Amen. Amen. That was all
[1:23:41] you understand.
[1:23:43] AND we will go continue Abraham's
[1:23:45] journey a little
[1:23:47] and you stay with me for a little while
[1:23:51] because I found it profound
[1:23:55] to to to study Abraham's life and
[1:23:57] Abraham's journey
[1:24:01] as as is really identify as our journey.
[1:24:06] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID NOW ABRAHAM'S
[1:24:07] JOURNEY
[1:24:10] HE met God along in different forms.
[1:24:14] They said he said now
[1:24:17] that we find that his royal seed
[1:24:21] travels the same journey
[1:24:24] that's the bride of Christ travels the
[1:24:27] same journey
[1:24:29] that Abraham did. And the last sign
[1:24:34] Abraham HAD SEEN BEFORE THE PROMISED SON
[1:24:37] COME
[1:24:39] WAS WHEN GOD MANIFESTED in human body
[1:24:43] and two angels came out.
[1:24:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:48] Amen. THAT WAS THE LAST SIGN.
[1:24:52] AMEN. THE LAST SIGN THAT ABRAHAM HAS
[1:24:54] SEEN
[1:24:56] AND THEN THE SON CAME.
[1:24:59] AND CHURCH, WE ARE LIVING IN THE
[1:25:01] GENERATION
[1:25:03] THAT HAVE SEEN THE LAST SIGN.
[1:25:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:09] HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:10] HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:10] AMEN.
[1:25:11] AMEN.
[1:25:11] THE NEXT GENERATION
[1:25:14] will bring forth the son.
[1:25:18] THAT MEANS THE NEXT GENERATION
[1:25:21] WILL HAVE A CHANGE of the body.
[1:25:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I would
[1:25:27] trust that we understand
[1:25:29] that we are the omega generation
[1:25:33] that will see that
[1:25:35] experience that
[1:25:37] IN OUR LIVES IN OUR DAILY LIVES.
[1:25:42] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THIS NOT A
[1:25:43] DREAM. THIS IS REALITY.
[1:25:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:50] But let's let's go slowly.
[1:25:53] I think we WE NEED TO START with Abraham
[1:25:58] because with Abraham is special.
[1:26:02] Why
[1:26:03] it started with Abraham?
[1:26:08] Why the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:26:12] doesn't start with Adam?
[1:26:20] Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] Hallelujah.
[1:26:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] Amen.
[1:26:24] Amen.
[1:26:25] But the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:26:28] started with Abraham.
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:35] And as I said many times,
[1:26:38] Abraham had a name change
[1:26:42] from Abraham to Abraham.
[1:26:45] In our generation, we had a a man called
[1:26:49] Branham.
[1:26:51] He God in his life, in his father's
[1:26:54] life, they had a name change
[1:26:57] from Branham to Branham.
[1:27:00] Not to make brother Brenham special,
[1:27:04] but to show that we are living in the
[1:27:06] hour,
[1:27:08] that the royal seed of Abraham is here.
[1:27:14] Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:17] Abraham
[1:27:19] could identify
[1:27:22] Elohim coming.
[1:27:24] It was not Sarah.
[1:27:26] It was Abraham
[1:27:28] identifying Elohim in Genesis 18. And it
[1:27:33] was Branheim
[1:27:36] identifying
[1:27:37] Elohim
[1:27:38] in this time. And he said, "This is our
[1:27:41] Lord.
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:46] Hallelujah.
[1:27:47] Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] Amen.
[1:27:48] Amen.
[1:27:50] Now we have to say ABOUT ABRAHAM.
[1:27:54] Allow me to say a few things about
[1:27:55] Abraham.
[1:27:57] Abraham.
[1:27:59] I think this is very very
[1:28:02] from the beginning
[1:28:05] of Abraham's life.
[1:28:07] It was different
[1:28:10] than it was with as it was with Adam.
[1:28:15] Yet
[1:28:17] Adam
[1:28:19] had also a covenant.
[1:28:22] God made a covenant with Adam.
[1:28:30] Is that right?
[1:28:32] NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD HERE
[1:28:36] MAKES a covenant
[1:28:39] with Abraham.
[1:28:46] Can we say amen?
[1:28:48] We all know that.
[1:28:51] WHAT IS SO SPECIAL WITH ABRAHAM?
[1:28:55] WHAT IS MORE SPECIAL THAN IT WAS WITH
[1:28:57] ADAM?
[1:29:01] ADAM, HIS COVENANT
[1:29:04] WAS on condition.
[1:29:10] Abraham's covenant
[1:29:13] was without condition.
[1:29:20] You're with me?
[1:29:22] Abraham had an unconditional covenant.
[1:29:27] Now allow me TO FIRST A LITTLE BIT TO
[1:29:30] SPEAK about the covenant.
[1:29:34] Why would God MAKE A COVENANT?
[1:29:39] NOT ABRAHAM with God.
[1:29:43] God makes a covenant.
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:51] Is that not amazing?
[1:29:54] GOD
[1:29:55] COMES TO ADAM
[1:29:58] and makes a covenant with him.
[1:30:02] And as SOON AS YOU SEE IT WITH ABRAHAM,
[1:30:04] THE COVENANT
[1:30:06] His
[1:30:08] covenant
[1:30:11] is pregnantated
[1:30:15] with relationship.
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:22] Let that sink.
[1:30:24] THE COVENANT THAT GOD IS MAKING with men
[1:30:30] is pregnantated
[1:30:33] is influenced,
[1:30:37] consists
[1:30:41] of relationship.
[1:30:47] SO WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT WITH YOU,
[1:30:51] WHAT DOES HE HAS IN HIS MIND?
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:30:58] REMEMBER, IT'S NOT man
[1:31:02] making a covenant WITH GOD.
[1:31:05] IT IS GOD MAKING A COVENANT with man.
[1:31:10] GOD MAKING A COVENANT WITH ADAM.
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:17] LOOK WHAT THAT COVENANT WAS.
[1:31:20] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:22] AND EVEN THAT COVENANT,
[1:31:24] WHAT WAS ADAM? HE WAS MADE IN THE IMAGE
[1:31:27] OF HIM.
[1:31:29] AND GOD MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM.
[1:31:33] WHAT IS IN A COVENANT?
[1:31:35] A COVENANT IS ACTUALLY A RELATIONSHIP
[1:31:41] BASED
[1:31:43] UPON MUTAL COMMITMENTS.
[1:31:52] That's a covenant.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah.
[1:31:59] Amen.
[1:32:00] Amen.
[1:32:00] We want to go slow because we won't
[1:32:02] understand the covenant.
[1:32:05] A covenant. Allow me to read a few
[1:32:08] things that will help us to understand
[1:32:10] the covenant a little bit better.
[1:32:14] A covenant IS ALSO an aliens
[1:32:20] of friendship.
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:25] An alliance of friendship.
[1:32:33] Uh-huh. Mhm.
[1:32:34] That's a covenant also
[1:32:36] with other words.
[1:32:39] God want to be
[1:32:42] your friend.
[1:32:48] He comes down
[1:32:51] and HE MAKES A COVENANT WITH YOU AND HE
[1:32:54] TELLS you I am your friend.
[1:33:00] Do you want to be my friend? Amen.
[1:33:06] Hallelujah.
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:10] [Applause]
[1:33:12] Do we have the time
[1:33:14] to really to dig into it?
[1:33:22] My wife and me,
[1:33:25] we are 30 years married now.
[1:33:28] 35 years.
[1:33:30] You know what we are?
[1:33:32] We are really good friends.
[1:33:40] Good friends
[1:33:42] understand one another.
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:49] Mhm.
[1:33:50] Good friends
[1:33:52] understand one another.
[1:33:59] Does God understand us?
[1:34:03] I have a question.
[1:34:05] Do you understand him?
[1:34:11] How many times
[1:34:13] in our life we ask
[1:34:17] why?
[1:34:19] WHY GOD WHY is this happening to me?
[1:34:24] How many times? You know why? Because we
[1:34:28] don't know him that good.
[1:34:40] Amen. Come on, church.
[1:34:42] I can do with my wife.
[1:34:46] Now listen.
[1:34:47] I I I LEFT MY WIFE NOW ANOTHER 14 days
[1:34:51] alone at home.
[1:34:58] And because WE ARE SO CLOSE FRIENDS,
[1:35:02] SHE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY
[1:35:06] why I am leaving her alone at home.
[1:35:10] VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLES
[1:35:12] OF THE GOOD shepherd of the good
[1:35:15] shepherd.
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:18] THE GOOD SHEPHERD
[1:35:20] leaves
[1:35:22] the 99 sheep.
[1:35:25] YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIENDS.
[1:35:32] AND THE GOOD SHEPHERD
[1:35:34] CAN GO AFTER THAT ONE SHEEP.
[1:35:37] LEAVE THE OTHER ONES ALONE.
[1:35:40] AND NOBODY IS FEELING BAD ABOUT IT.
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:51] ABRAHAM, I THINK, WAS CALLED A FRIEND OF
[1:35:53] GOD.
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:59] YES.
[1:36:02] Oh my.
[1:36:04] Trust that we understand when God makes
[1:36:06] A COVENANT,
[1:36:08] there's something in his mind.
[1:36:12] GOD MADE a covenant with man. IS THAT
[1:36:14] RIGHT?
[1:36:16] NOW, SO A COVENANT is an aliens of
[1:36:19] friendship, alliance of friendship.
[1:36:22] [Applause]
[1:36:25] A covenant
[1:36:27] IS ALSO A DIVINE CONSTITUTION
[1:36:32] OR A DIVINE ORDINANCE.
[1:36:37] AMEN. That's all what a covenant is.
[1:36:40] A COVENANT IS ALSO A RELATIONSHIP.
[1:36:46] SO WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT,
[1:36:49] HE WANTS A RELATIONSHIP.
[1:36:54] AMEN.
[1:36:56] AMEN.
[1:36:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:59] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:59] He wants a relationship.
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:07] is very amazing
[1:37:10] as God would
[1:37:13] now you with me follow me very very very
[1:37:16] close
[1:37:18] AS GOD WOULD MAKE THE FIRST COVENANT
[1:37:22] with mankind.
[1:37:27] He put that covenant
[1:37:30] under condition.
[1:37:37] IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:37:39] ADAM HAD A COVENANT
[1:37:42] BUT it worked if you do
[1:37:45] it was under condition.
[1:37:48] IT WAS DON'T EAT FROM THAT TREE
[1:37:52] BECAUSE THE DAY YOU EAT
[1:37:54] THE DAY YOU DIE.
[1:37:58] AMEN.
[1:37:59] SO IT WAS A COVENANT
[1:38:01] GIVING under condition.
[1:38:05] WHY WOULD GOD DO A THING LIKE THIS?
[1:38:08] KNOWING THAT MANKIND
[1:38:12] COULD NEVER KEEP UP TO THAT CONDITION.
[1:38:17] YOU KNOW GOD KNOWS THE BEGINNING FROM
[1:38:19] THE END.
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:22] WHY WOULD GOD GIVE THEN A CONDITIONAL
[1:38:24] COVENANT?
[1:38:28] KNOWING ADAM COULDN'T KEEP IT.
[1:38:32] AMEN.
[1:38:33] You are with me. WHY
[1:38:36] DID HE NOT GIVE
[1:38:38] LIKE FOR ABRAHAM AN UNCONDITIONAL
[1:38:41] COVENANT?
[1:38:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:50] AMEN. Watch now. Not not even that.
[1:38:53] Actually, God made when we can we can
[1:38:55] call God make God made three covenants.
[1:38:59] Let me quickly read that to you.
[1:39:03] HE SAID GOD MADE THREE COVENANTS.
[1:39:07] One with Adam.
[1:39:09] He broke it.
[1:39:13] He failed.
[1:39:15] He eats.
[1:39:21] Is that right?
[1:39:24] So he broke
[1:39:26] the covenant.
[1:39:31] That's why GOD WOULD TELL ADAM,
[1:39:35] "WHERE ARE YOU?"
[1:39:37] He was still there,
[1:39:39] but in a fallen condition.
[1:39:42] BEFORE THAT HE HAD FALLEN. HE WAS IN A
[1:39:46] DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.
[1:39:50] GOD WOULD WALK IN THE COOL OF THE
[1:39:51] EVENING
[1:39:53] AND ADAM WITH HIM
[1:39:56] TWO OF THE SAME KIND.
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:01] AS SOON AS ADAM
[1:40:04] BROKE THE COVENANT AND HAD EATEN FROM
[1:40:06] THE TREE, HE WAS FALLEN.
[1:40:10] GOD WOULD COME DOWN IN THE COOLER OF THE
[1:40:12] EVENING
[1:40:14] AND ADAM WAS HIDING.
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:20] Now God is calling him.
[1:40:22] No, listen what Adam said. He said, "I
[1:40:25] HEARD YOUR VOICE
[1:40:27] AND I WAS AFRAID.
[1:40:33] FEAR
[1:40:35] HINDERS
[1:40:38] RELATIONSHIP.
[1:40:42] IF THE WIFE IS AFRAID OF THE HUSBAND, no
[1:40:47] relationship,
[1:40:51] IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF GOD,
[1:40:54] I DON'T mean the fear of God.
[1:40:58] The fear of God is the beginning of
[1:40:59] wisdom.
[1:41:03] THERE'S A GREAT DIFFERENCE between the
[1:41:06] fear of God
[1:41:08] and being afraid.
[1:41:11] THE FEAR OF GOD IS RESPECT.
[1:41:18] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:19] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:21] I RESPECT GOD.
[1:41:25] HE IS GOD.
[1:41:26] BUT I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM.
[1:41:30] YES. AMEN.
[1:41:32] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:41:34] WHO IS AFRAID OF GOD THIS THIS
[1:41:35] AFTERNOON?
[1:41:37] NO, I I TRUST YOU ARE NOT AFRAID.
[1:41:40] GOD IS YOUR FRIEND.
[1:41:46] Now Jesus, Jesus was appearing to the
[1:41:49] disciples
[1:41:52] JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
[1:41:55] THEY HAD fellowship with him,
[1:41:57] eating with him. AND JUST A FEW MINUTES
[1:42:00] LATER, HE CAME WALKING ON THE WATER
[1:42:04] AND HERE THEY SAID, "AH,
[1:42:07] IT'S A GHOST."
[1:42:09] THEY WAS AFRAID.
[1:42:11] WHAT DID JESUS SAY?
[1:42:14] Fear not.
[1:42:14] Fear not.
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:18] [Applause]
[1:42:21] Oh my my. If God would be here this
[1:42:24] EVENING
[1:42:26] AND HE IS HERE, HE WOULD TELL YOU, "FEAR
[1:42:30] NOT."
[1:42:31] [Applause]
[1:42:33] AMEN.
[1:42:35] Respect me.
[1:42:38] Be not afraid.
[1:42:40] Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] Hallelujah.
[1:42:42] Hallelujah.
[1:42:44] Be not afraid.
[1:42:46] There is in love. in love.
[1:42:50] Paul said to the Corinthians,
[1:42:54] "Perfect love
[1:42:56] cast out
[1:42:59] all.
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] We have not RECEIVED
[1:43:05] the spirit of fear.
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:12] Oh my."
[1:43:16] Can we say amen so far? Amen.
[1:43:18] Hallelujah. This is you understand where
[1:43:20] God wants to take us.
[1:43:23] My my Adam was fallen.
[1:43:26] Amen. Adam was not drinking and smoking.
[1:43:30] ADAM HAD FALLEN out of a relationship.
[1:43:34] GOD COULD NOT FELLOWSHIP WITH him like
[1:43:36] before.
[1:43:40] GOD WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP with you
[1:43:43] on the same level.
[1:43:46] Amen. Yes.
[1:43:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:51] GOD WANTS HE SPOKE ONCE TO YOPE
[1:43:55] to Y. HE SPOKE TO Y SAID,
[1:43:57] JOB,
[1:43:59] GUARD YOUR LOINS,
[1:44:02] TALK TO ME LIKE A MAN,
[1:44:05] WHERE WAS YOU? WHEN THE SONS OF GOD
[1:44:08] SHOUTED FOR JOY.
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:16] Oh church, why did this message came?
[1:44:20] To take all the fear away.
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:28] Hallelujah.
[1:44:29] Hallelujah.
[1:44:30] Amen. And that's why he came to Abraham.
[1:44:33] We have to continue because just to make
[1:44:36] that plain
[1:44:38] NOW GOD MAKE THREE COVENANTS.
[1:44:40] ONE WITH ADAM,
[1:44:42] he broke it.
[1:44:47] ANOTHER ONE
[1:44:48] WITH NOAH
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:52] and he broke it.
[1:44:56] Come on, go with me to very amazing
[1:45:00] scripture.
[1:45:02] Then you will SEE HOW THE COVENANT OF
[1:45:04] God
[1:45:06] is impregnated with relationship.
[1:45:11] SO WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT WITH YOU,
[1:45:14] HE'S LOOKING for relationship.
[1:45:18] He's looking FOR FRIENDSHIP.
[1:45:20] HE'S LOOKING FOR MARRIAGE.
[1:45:23] HE'S LOOKING for union.
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:27] He's looking for someone in the image of
[1:45:30] God.
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:34] This is in the image of the beast.
[1:45:39] This is in the image of the beast.
[1:45:44] IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:45:46] BUT YOU ARE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD.
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:52] THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE GREATEST BATTLE
[1:45:55] OF THE IMAGES,
[1:45:57] THE IMAGE OF GOD AND THE IMAGE OF THE
[1:46:00] BEAST.
[1:46:02] FIGHTING EVERY DAY
[1:46:04] in your life.
[1:46:06] [Applause]
[1:46:12] Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] Paul knew that already.
[1:46:17] Okay, but we continue
[1:46:20] because I feel that's now let's go to
[1:46:22] Genesis 9.
[1:46:27] Genesis 9. Go quickly to Genesis 9.
[1:46:32] Very, very amazing scripture.
[1:46:36] The word of God is wonderful.
[1:46:40] You know, brother Random said the devil
[1:46:44] hates two books of the Bible the most.
[1:46:50] Genesis
[1:46:51] and Revelation.
[1:46:54] Because Genesis is a C chapter.
[1:47:00] Seed chapter
[1:47:02] gays beginning
[1:47:07] there. You see everything in the
[1:47:08] beginning in seed form
[1:47:12] in Revelation. You see the
[1:47:13] manifestation.
[1:47:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:20] Let's Genesis 9:13. We want to first see
[1:47:24] um the rainbow.
[1:47:28] Because he gave finally the rainbow
[1:47:32] as a sign.
[1:47:35] Is that right?
[1:47:37] Come on.
[1:47:39] 9:13.
[1:47:42] Chapter 9 verse 13.
[1:47:44] I DO SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUDS AND IT
[1:47:48] SHALL BE FOR A TOKEN OF A COVENANT
[1:47:52] between me and the earth.
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:05] SO THE RAINBOW
[1:48:07] IS A TOKEN
[1:48:09] OF A COVENANT
[1:48:11] THAT GOD MADE WITH NOAH ON THE EARTH.
[1:48:15] Is that right?
[1:48:17] As soon AS YOU SEE THE RAINBOW,
[1:48:20] IT IS A TOKEN OF A COVENANT THAT GOD IS
[1:48:24] MAKING with Noah
[1:48:27] or with the earth. BUT AGAIN, YOU SEE
[1:48:31] THAT COVENANT IS UNDER CONDITIONS.
[1:48:38] Let's go quickly to Genesis 9:1.
[1:48:46] you see something beautiful.
[1:48:49] And when we read that,
[1:48:52] I want to stretch your spiritual jacket
[1:48:59] as we read that.
[1:49:02] I asked you, did you hear that before?
[1:49:08] AND NOAH AND HIS SONS and God blessed
[1:49:13] NOAH AND HIS SONS.
[1:49:15] AND SAID UNTO THEM,
[1:49:18] "Be fruitful,
[1:49:20] AND MULTIPLY,
[1:49:22] AND REPLENISH THE EARTH."
[1:49:29] Have you have heard that before?
[1:49:35] YES. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ADAM.
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:42] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:49:44] AS HE MADE A COVENANT WITH ADAM.
[1:49:47] [Applause]
[1:49:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:52] HE SAID TO ADAM, "BE FRUITFUL
[1:49:55] AND MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH THE EARTH."
[1:50:00] NOW HE MAKES A COVENANT WITH NOAH.
[1:50:03] AND HE SAID THE SAME THING, "BE FRUITFUL
[1:50:07] AND MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH.
[1:50:18] What is he telling to Abraham?
[1:50:23] What is he telling to Abraham?
[1:50:26] He said, "Thy seed
[1:50:28] with other words,
[1:50:32] BE FRUITFUL
[1:50:34] AND MULTIPLY.
[1:50:37] THY SEED,
[1:50:39] THY SEED SHALL BE THE SAND AND DUST OF
[1:50:42] THIS OF THE SEA.
[1:50:46] THY SEED
[1:50:47] SHALL HAVE INFLUENCE
[1:50:50] IN ALL THE GENERATIONS
[1:50:54] with other words. He said to Adam, to
[1:50:56] Abraham,
[1:50:57] BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH
[1:51:02] THE EARTH.
[1:51:03] THY SEED
[1:51:05] SHALL BE
[1:51:06] AND THAT SEED
[1:51:08] WAS JESUS CHRIST.
[1:51:10] THAT SEED WAS JESUS CHRIST IN BRIDE
[1:51:14] FORM.
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:26] is impregnated
[1:51:29] with relationship.
[1:51:34] Now to be fruitful
[1:51:36] and to multiply it has to be a union has
[1:51:41] TO BE A RELATIONSHIP. Is it right? No.
[1:51:44] Noah could NOT HAVE CHILDREN ON HIS OWN.
[1:51:48] He had to have children with his wife.
[1:51:51] COME ON CHURCH. AND BEFORE SEXUALITY WAS
[1:51:54] INTRODUCED,
[1:51:56] WHEN THE FIRST COVENANT WAS MADE, WHEN
[1:51:59] GOD SAID TO ADAM, "BE FRUITFUL AND
[1:52:02] REPLENISH." HE NEVER SPOKE OF SEXUAL
[1:52:05] MULTIPLICATION.
[1:52:07] HALLELUJAH. HE SPOKE OF SPIRITUAL
[1:52:10] MULTIPLICATION.
[1:52:12] [Applause]
[1:52:18] OH, if you had time, we could go into
[1:52:19] that.
[1:52:21] How brother Adam said then sin came in
[1:52:24] and God allowed sexuality
[1:52:29] as a multiplication
[1:52:32] when it is put into a marriage.
[1:52:37] Everybody can say amen.
[1:52:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But from the
[1:52:42] beginning it was not so.
[1:52:45] Yes. No. From the beginning it was not
[1:52:48] sexual multiplication.
[1:52:51] GOD HAS IN HIS MIND A relationship where
[1:52:55] spiritual multiplication
[1:52:57] is normal.
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:04] Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] Hallelujah.
[1:53:06] Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] Can your heart say amen?
[1:53:10] I know sometimes your brain especially
[1:53:12] at this time of the day.
[1:53:16] Yeah. Our brain sometimes fails
[1:53:19] especially especially after you have
[1:53:20] eaten
[1:53:22] all the blood GOES IN THE STOMACH AND
[1:53:25] THEN YOUR BRAIN fails to get.
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:33] That's why I WOULD NOT SAY DO YOU
[1:53:35] UNDERSTAND IT
[1:53:37] BUT I WOULD ASK YOU DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
[1:53:40] LET YOUR HEART SPEAK.
[1:53:42] CAN YOUR HEART SAY AMEN?
[1:53:45] I REJOICE.
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:51] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:52] So why
[1:53:53] would God make a covenant? Now let's see
[1:53:56] again what a covenant is else.
[1:53:59] But he said a covenant. Brother Brandham
[1:54:01] said in the message Christ the mystery
[1:54:03] of God reveals.
[1:54:07] He said you know a covenant what God is
[1:54:10] doing.
[1:54:12] Christ, the mystery of God, he reveals
[1:54:15] page 24.
[1:54:17] He said, "Now listen, when when God put
[1:54:20] men on partnership with him,
[1:54:27] when God MAKES WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT
[1:54:30] WITH MEN
[1:54:32] UPON THE BASIS OF SPIRITUAL
[1:54:35] MULTIPLICATION,
[1:54:37] NOT SEXUAL,
[1:54:39] BUT SPIRITUAL AMEN.
[1:54:43] HE'S ACTUALLY ASKING YOU,
[1:54:46] DO YOU WANT TO BE MY PARTNER?
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:51] [Applause]
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:56] WHO WANTS TO BE A PARTNER OF GOD THIS
[1:54:57] EVENING?
[1:55:00] HEY, GOD IS ASKING YOU,
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:06] BE MY PARTNER.
[1:55:08] GOD IS ASKING MEN,
[1:55:12] "DO YOU WANT TO BE my partner?
[1:55:16] YOU CAN SAY AS A MAN,
[1:55:18] BUT I'M BORN IN SIN. I'M SHAKEN IN
[1:55:21] INIQUITY. HOW CAN I BE YOUR PARTNER?
[1:55:25] WHAT WILL GOD TELL YOU? THAT'S WHY I
[1:55:27] DIED AT CALVARY.
[1:55:29] THAT'S WHY I DIED AT CALVARY.
[1:55:32] GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD.
[1:55:35] GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD
[1:55:39] THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON.
[1:55:42] WHAT DID HE DO?
[1:55:45] RECONCILING
[1:55:47] THE WORLD WITH HIMSELF
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:55] to reconcile
[1:55:57] is not only to forgive.
[1:56:01] Forgive is the first step.
[1:56:05] But to reconcile
[1:56:07] is bringing him back in the same
[1:56:09] relationship.
[1:56:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:15] Amen. Oh, I trust you see the picture. I
[1:56:18] TRUST YOU SEE THE PICTURE. WHY WE HAD
[1:56:20] THAT GLORIOUS DAY ON CALVARY.
[1:56:23] Why we had that glorious DAY ON CALVARY.
[1:56:27] WHY? IT WAS A bloody lamb taking the
[1:56:30] book.
[1:56:34] THE BOOK. ADAM LOST THE BOOK. ADAM LOST
[1:56:38] THE RELATIONSHIP.
[1:56:40] YES. ADAM LOST THE RELATIONSHIP.
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] The Bible says God created at the
[1:56:49] seventh day. God rested.
[1:56:53] Where did God rest?
[1:56:55] What is his holiday place?
[1:56:59] When the Bible SAID GOD RESTED.
[1:57:02] YEAH. Can you bring that up? It's nice.
[1:57:05] Yeah. Yeah. And partnership a beautiful
[1:57:07] quote, right? But the Bible says and God
[1:57:11] rested on the seventh day.
[1:57:15] Is that right? God rested.
[1:57:19] You know where he rested? He rested in
[1:57:22] Adam
[1:57:28] who was giving all the names to all the
[1:57:32] animals
[1:57:37] was not God. No, he rested.
[1:57:43] Adam did it. Even when the serpent came
[1:57:49] here, the serpent came to Adam. Adam
[1:57:52] looked at the serpent
[1:57:54] said, "Oh."
[1:57:56] And the serpent could say, "I'm longer
[1:57:59] here than you
[1:58:08] church.
[1:58:11] There were seven stars in the hand of
[1:58:13] God.
[1:58:16] It was the last star
[1:58:20] that could give name to all the other
[1:58:21] stars.
[1:58:26] IT WAS NOT THE FIRST STAR.
[1:58:29] IT WAS NOT PAUL GIVING ALL NAMES TO ALL
[1:58:32] THE OTHER STARS.
[1:58:34] IT WAS THE LAST STAR IN THE HAND OF GOD
[1:58:39] WHO GAVE NAME TO ALL THE OTHER STARS.
[1:58:44] PAUL COULD SAY, "WE SEE THROUGH A GLASS
[1:58:47] DARKLY."
[1:58:51] BUT THEN WHEN THE LAST STAR IS HERE, WE
[1:58:55] SEE FROM FACE TO FACE.
[1:58:58] IT'S A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP, CHURCH.
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:06] THAT'S WHY ADAM,
[1:59:07] HE CAME AT AT LAST.
[1:59:10] FIRST GOD HAD THE CREATION THE ANIMALS.
[1:59:14] IS THAT RIGHT? FINALLY ADAM CAME. NOW
[1:59:18] WHEN GOD RESTED THEN ADAM GIVE ALL NAMES
[1:59:21] TO ALL THE ANIMALS
[1:59:25] AND GOD WAS NOT WORRIED
[1:59:28] THAT ADAM COULD GIVE NAME GIVE THEM
[1:59:29] WRONG NAMES
[1:59:32] BECAUSE ADAM GOD WAS RESTING IN ADAM.
[1:59:37] WAS A RELATIONSHIP
[1:59:39] [Applause]
[1:59:41] BECAUSE MAN WAS IN THE IMAGE OF GOD.
[1:59:45] [Applause]
[1:59:47] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. JUMP AND SHOUT.
[1:59:50] I UNDERSTAND WHY HE DIED AT CALVARY.
[1:59:56] WE SIT HERE TODAY IN OUR SINFUL BODIES
[2:00:00] NOT redeemed yet.
[2:00:04] AND YET GOD CAN COME DOWN AND HAVE
[2:00:08] FELLOWSHIP with us.
[2:00:12] THAT'S WHY I WOULD COUNSEL YOU.
[2:00:15] STAY under the blood.
[2:00:18] [Applause]
[2:00:20] I WOULD COUNSEL YOU. STAY EVERY MOMENT,
[2:00:25] EVERY DAY, EVERY HOUR, EVERY SECOND.
[2:00:30] STAY UNDER THE BLOOD.
[2:00:35] BECAUSE WHEN YOU STAY UNDER THE BLOOD,
[2:00:37] GOD IS ONLY HEARING YOUR VOICE
[2:00:41] AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
[2:00:46] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:49] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:49] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:51] AMEN.
[2:00:51] AMEN.
[2:00:52] What a wonderful
[2:00:54] story. You understand?
[2:00:57] again.
[2:00:58] You understand? God make a covenant with
[2:00:59] Noah.
[2:01:02] Yes. Hallelujah.
[2:01:04] Hallelujah.
[2:01:05] Oh my. Oh my. Oh my.
[2:01:09] No wonder we are about you know this is
[2:01:14] entering the millennium.
[2:01:19] The millennium is a seven as the seventh
[2:01:21] day.
[2:01:26] You understand the types of the shadows.
[2:01:30] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:31] Hallelujah.
[2:01:32] Hallelujah.
[2:01:32] Amen. We are entering another phase.
[2:01:37] We are entering another phase.
[2:01:40] We will have the millennium.
[2:01:43] Amen. Is that right? Come on. He has six
[2:01:47] days of creation.
[2:01:50] And now we have six days or 6,000 years
[2:01:52] of redemption. Actually
[2:01:58] on the seventh day God was resting.
[2:02:01] Where was he resting in Adam?
[2:02:04] Hallelujah. He was resting in Adam and
[2:02:07] Eve.
[2:02:08] Adam and the woman. He was resting in
[2:02:11] them.
[2:02:14] Can he rest today?
[2:02:18] Are we his place of rest?
[2:02:21] You know what Jesus said 2,000 years
[2:02:23] ago?
[2:02:25] He said, "The foxes have holes,
[2:02:28] the birds have nests,
[2:02:30] but the son of man has no place to lay
[2:02:34] his head.
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:37] [Applause]
[2:02:40] The son of man came back in these days.
[2:02:45] When you see the cloud,
[2:02:48] you see only the head.
[2:02:50] Is that right?
[2:02:52] There's only the head.
[2:02:54] Is that the son of man?
[2:02:59] Jesus Christ.
[2:03:01] But you only see the head.
[2:03:04] Now that cloud,
[2:03:06] the prophet was taken up in that cloud
[2:03:11] in that constellation
[2:03:14] of seven angels
[2:03:16] which formed the cloud.
[2:03:19] Is that right? THE CLOUD IS NOT FORMED
[2:03:21] BY A ROCKET.
[2:03:24] The cloud is formed by seven angels.
[2:03:29] Hallelujah.
[2:03:30] Hallelujah.
[2:03:31] Amen. Amen. And we only COULD SEE THE
[2:03:33] HEADS. YOU KNOW WHY ONLY THE HEADS? IF
[2:03:36] YOU GO AND SHE LOOKED AT YOUR PASSPORT
[2:03:40] AND THE PASSPORT, YOU ONLY HAVE THE
[2:03:42] HEADS. YOU DON'T have the whole body.
[2:03:46] [Applause]
[2:03:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. WHY ONLY THE
[2:03:51] HEADS? 2,000 YEARS AGO, JESUS SAID,
[2:03:56] "FOXES HAVE FAULTS." BUT the son OF MAN
[2:04:00] HAS NO BODY
[2:04:02] TO LAY HIS HEAD ON.
[2:04:05] BUT IN THIS HOUR, HE FOUND A BODY
[2:04:09] REDEEMED
[2:04:11] BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB.
[2:04:17] YES.
[2:04:18] Thank God for Calvary.
[2:04:22] Stay under the blood, church.
[2:04:24] Stay quickly. If something has happened,
[2:04:27] stay under the blood.
[2:04:29] Put yourself under the blood. When you
[2:04:32] see the blood, he sees not you. He sees
[2:04:35] through the blood. What does he see? HE
[2:04:38] ONLY HEARS YOUR VOICE. HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:41] HALLELUJAH. AND HE WOULD TALK TO US
[2:04:43] TODAY.
[2:04:44] Talk to me.
[2:04:46] LIKE I WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME. TALK TO
[2:04:49] ME LIKE ONLY MY BRIDE CAN TALK TO ME.
[2:04:54] WE CAN SEE TYPES IN THE BIBLE.
[2:04:57] WE SEE RUTH IN THE BIBLE.
[2:05:00] WE SEE ESTHER in the Bible.
[2:05:04] Amen.
[2:05:07] Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] Hallelujah.
[2:05:09] But we don't go there today.
[2:05:11] Amen. Can you say praise the Lord?
[2:05:15] Hallelujah. But he was he was Abraham.
[2:05:18] Now in he has a covenant. You're still
[2:05:21] with a covenant because you want to stay
[2:05:24] true to that. Now
[2:05:27] God make three covenants.
[2:05:29] The first two covenants
[2:05:32] with Adam and with Noah he made under
[2:05:35] condition.
[2:05:38] Why God doing that?
[2:05:47] Hallelujah.
[2:05:47] Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] So that man understands
[2:05:52] what I do. You have nothing to do with
[2:05:55] that.
[2:05:59] So that you understand
[2:06:01] his covenant with you is his grace.
[2:06:09] You cannot earn it. You cannot work for
[2:06:12] it. You cannot go to church for it. You
[2:06:16] cannot change your doctrine for it. You
[2:06:18] cannot be baptized in the right name for
[2:06:20] it. When God makes a covenant for you,
[2:06:24] when God comes in relationship with you,
[2:06:27] YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, you have nothing
[2:06:30] to do WITH THAT. IT'S GOD'S CHOICE.
[2:06:35] IT'S GOD'S CHOICE.
[2:06:37] HIS GRACE TOWARDS YOU. THAT IS THAT'S
[2:06:41] WHY THE ANGEL SAID TO MARY,
[2:06:44] "BLESSED ARE YOU."
[2:06:48] And I CAN TELL YOU THIS EVENING,
[2:06:51] "BLESSED ARE YOU,
[2:06:56] NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE SO GOOD,
[2:06:58] NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE SO NICE,
[2:07:02] BUT God loved you.
[2:07:04] [Applause]
[2:07:08] One day
[2:07:10] Israel,
[2:07:12] you know the people of Israel
[2:07:14] would ask God
[2:07:17] and many times we we ask God,
[2:07:21] God, do you love us?
[2:07:28] Israel, they ask themselves the
[2:07:30] question,
[2:07:32] God, do you love us?
[2:07:37] You know what God told them?
[2:07:41] You know what God gave them as an
[2:07:43] answer?
[2:07:46] Jacob have I loved.
[2:07:49] Esau have I hated.
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:07:58] God's love
[2:08:00] for you
[2:08:01] is that he chose you.
[2:08:04] Hallelujah.
[2:08:05] Listen.
[2:08:06] He chose you not to be a monkey on the
[2:08:09] tree.
[2:08:14] But he chose you to be a part of the
[2:08:17] bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:21] Amen.
[2:08:24] Hallelujah.
[2:08:24] Hallelujah.
[2:08:26] I trust we get the picture.
[2:08:30] GOD HAD TO ALLOW
[2:08:32] MORE THAN 2,000 years
[2:08:35] of really a covenant under condition
[2:08:41] to let go mankind to corrupt themsself.
[2:08:47] Finally, he would speak to Abraham.
[2:08:50] Said,
[2:08:50] Abraham, now with you I make a covenant.
[2:08:56] Now
[2:08:57] I can put him under no condition.
[2:09:02] Hallelujah.
[2:09:03] Hallelujah.
[2:09:04] Hallelujah.
[2:09:04] Hallelujah.
[2:09:05] Amen. You understand that?
[2:09:07] Because the covenant
[2:09:10] is so amazing
[2:09:15] that we need to understand
[2:09:17] We have nothing to do with that.
[2:09:25] Somebody can say amen.
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:28] With this covenant that God is making
[2:09:30] with mankind,
[2:09:32] mankind has to know I have nothing to do
[2:09:36] with that.
[2:09:39] As long as you feel you have something
[2:09:43] to do with it,
[2:09:45] God cannot use you.
[2:09:51] Somebody can say amen to that.
[2:09:56] Amen.
[2:09:57] Amen.
[2:09:58] But when you feel
[2:10:00] is just by grace,
[2:10:03] then God can do everything
[2:10:07] and he can use you.
[2:10:09] Hallelujah.
[2:10:09] Hallelujah.
[2:10:10] You're with me.
[2:10:13] On our way
[2:10:16] to all things.
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:19] Now we understand
[2:10:21] the things
[2:10:23] that we see IN THE LIFE OF OF Abraham
[2:10:27] is not conditions.
[2:10:30] It is foundations.
[2:10:36] Oh, wonderful.
[2:10:38] Yes,
[2:10:40] IT'S FOUNDATIONAL.
[2:10:42] IT'S NEVER CONDITIONED.
[2:10:44] IF ABRAHAM OBEY GOD OR NOT,
[2:10:48] NEVER CHANGED THE COVENANT.
[2:10:51] THE COVENANT WAS UNDER NO CONDITION.
[2:10:58] Somebody can say amen.
[2:11:00] BECAUSE SUCH A GOD HAS SUCH A GREAT
[2:11:03] WORK.
[2:11:05] HE DON'T WANT MAN TO BRAG ABOUT HIMSELF.
[2:11:09] He don't want men he to brag about
[2:11:12] himself.
[2:11:19] THE WORK OF GOD IS SO GREAT.
[2:11:23] HE WANT TO MAKE SURE that man has
[2:11:26] nothing to do with it.
[2:11:30] Yes,
[2:11:33] I trust I can make it that simple.
[2:11:45] Amen.
[2:11:46] Amen.
[2:11:47] As soon as we are lifting ourselves
[2:11:51] above zero,
[2:11:55] we are lifting ourselves above God.
[2:12:02] But a zero
[2:12:04] has a big value
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:10] when it is behind the one.
[2:12:17] behind the one.
[2:12:20] If you take the one
[2:12:24] right and put a zero behind it,
[2:12:28] it is 10.
[2:12:33] Hallelujah.
[2:12:37] Somebody can say amen.
[2:12:41] That's why brother Brandham said
[2:12:43] If we humble ourselves,
[2:12:46] if we learn to humble ourselves,
[2:12:48] never lift yourself above zero,
[2:12:52] stay zero,
[2:12:55] stay behind the great one.
[2:12:58] AND THEN BECAUSE OF YOU, OF THE ZERO,
[2:13:02] THE FIRST, HALLELUJAH, BECOMES THE LAST
[2:13:15] HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:16] HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:17] UM,
[2:13:20] we have a few minutes time. Yes.
[2:13:24] Because we want to see.
[2:13:26] Let's go to Matthew 7:24.
[2:13:35] Matthew 7:24.
[2:13:38] As we are speaking of
[2:13:41] conditions and no conditions
[2:13:44] because we will find a lot of things
[2:13:48] in the life of Hey, come on church.
[2:13:52] WE FIND circumcision
[2:13:55] in the life of Abraham.
[2:14:06] Is that right?
[2:14:09] A type
[2:14:11] of the Holy Ghost baptism.
[2:14:14] [Applause]
[2:14:17] CIRCUMCISION
[2:14:19] WAS NOT a condition.
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:26] Here we go.
[2:14:28] Oh, I trust that sinks in.
[2:14:31] But circumcision
[2:14:33] was foundational.
[2:14:42] Hallelujah.
[2:14:43] Hallelujah.
[2:14:44] The baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST
[2:14:47] is not a condition.
[2:14:50] It is a foundation.
[2:14:56] Hallelujah.
[2:14:57] Hallelujah.
[2:14:58] Oh my. Oh my. We should be the happiest
[2:15:01] PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
[2:15:05] WE HAVE A COVENANT
[2:15:08] WITHOUT ANY CONDITION
[2:15:12] AND WE STAND ABOUT A SURE FOUNDATION.
[2:15:19] Let's go a little bit. It's wonderful to
[2:15:21] see Matthew 7:24.
[2:15:24] Matthew 7:24.
[2:15:28] uh think it is like that.
[2:15:33] Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[2:15:34] things of mine and doeth them, I will
[2:15:38] liken him unto a wise man who spilled
[2:15:40] his house upon a rock.
[2:15:45] The rain cometh, DESCENDANTS, AND THE
[2:15:46] FLOOD CAME, and the winds blew and beat
[2:15:48] upon the house, and it fell, not was
[2:15:51] founded upon a rock.
[2:15:56] [Music]
[2:16:01] Hallelujah.
[2:16:16] this wonderful relationship
[2:16:20] upon a rock.
[2:16:22] HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:24] UPON A ROCK. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT
[2:16:28] UNDER CONDITION.
[2:16:30] THAT'S WHY WE DON'T NEED TO BE AFRAID OF
[2:16:33] GOD.
[2:16:42] Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. You're with me.
[2:16:48] Hallelujah. We will we will go there.
[2:16:50] Now foundation
[2:16:53] rock.
[2:16:56] This what we read in the Bible here that
[2:16:58] the rock a rock exists
[2:17:04] of more than 30
[2:17:07] different elements.
[2:17:16] If you have time, if we had time, we
[2:17:17] could go into the elements.
[2:17:22] But that rock,
[2:17:24] that foundation
[2:17:26] exists
[2:17:28] from different elements.
[2:17:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:34] And if you take the elements out,
[2:17:38] the foundation becomes weak.
[2:17:41] IF YOU TAKE ELEMENTS out of the rocks.
[2:17:47] It becomes sand
[2:17:53] and no one builds his house upon sand.
[2:18:01] God is not building his church upon
[2:18:06] sand. GOD IS BUILDING HIS CHURCH UPON
[2:18:10] THE ROCK OF REVELATION.
[2:18:14] [Applause]
[2:18:18] You're with me.
[2:18:20] Hallelujah.
[2:18:21] Hallelujah.
[2:18:22] Again,
[2:18:29] you understand what Abraham did
[2:18:32] as he started his journey.
[2:18:35] Let's go quickly. Let's take 10 minutes,
[2:18:38] okay? And then I trust we can come to an
[2:18:40] end. But just to show you
[2:18:44] as Abraham started his journey
[2:18:47] what God is doing and how God is
[2:18:49] bringing him to all things.
[2:18:53] Now remember, he had an unconditional
[2:18:55] covenant.
[2:18:57] So everything what he was doing
[2:19:00] was foundational.
[2:19:04] Let's quickly go through it.
[2:19:06] Genesis 12:5.
[2:19:10] Let's get quickly go quickly go Genesis
[2:19:12] 12:5.
[2:19:14] Maybe the brother can bring it and we
[2:19:16] can read it together.
[2:19:19] Genesis 12:5.
[2:19:23] Somebody can say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:19:26] You're still happy. You still love the
[2:19:28] Lord.
[2:19:30] Amen. Amen.
[2:19:31] Are we ON THE SAME ROAD THAT ABRAHAM IS
[2:19:33] WALKING?
[2:19:37] AMEN.
[2:19:38] AMEN.
[2:19:39] Verse 5.
[2:19:40] Chapter 12:5.
[2:19:42] Abraham took Sarah,
[2:19:45] his wife, and Lot,
[2:19:48] his brother's son, AND ALL THE substance
[2:19:50] that they had gathered,
[2:19:53] the souls that they had gotten in a
[2:19:55] haram, and went forth and go into the
[2:19:58] land of Canaan.
[2:20:00] SO GOD CALLED HIM ALONE
[2:20:03] BUT HE took Lot with him.
[2:20:07] Now watch
[2:20:10] Lot.
[2:20:12] THAT MEANS ALSO
[2:20:14] that Abraham
[2:20:16] TOOK A LOT OF THINGS with him
[2:20:21] THAT WAS NOT GOOD FOUND FOR THE
[2:20:23] FOUNDATION.
[2:20:26] SO GOD COULD NOT BUILD
[2:20:29] THAT HOUSE as long as love was there.
[2:20:34] Abraham never lost his covenant
[2:20:38] because the covenant was unconditional.
[2:20:42] Are you not glad the covenant is
[2:20:45] unconditional?
[2:20:47] Has nothing to do with you.
[2:20:50] Not when you do, I do.
[2:20:53] No, I have already done it.
[2:20:57] But you watch 12:5
[2:21:01] it was Lot. He was taking Lot with him.
[2:21:04] A lot of sandy things
[2:21:08] LIKE WE TAKE IN OUR LIFE.
[2:21:11] A LOT OF THINGS
[2:21:14] LOT OF THINGS THAT doesn't help us on
[2:21:16] our journey.
[2:21:22] You're with me?
[2:21:24] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:25] But you understand he never lost his
[2:21:27] covenant.
[2:21:32] 12:10.
[2:21:35] Now Abraham was said to go into the
[2:21:37] land.
[2:21:40] In chapter 12 10
[2:21:43] there was a famine in the land.
[2:21:46] And Abram there was a famine in the land
[2:21:48] AND ABRAM WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT.
[2:21:52] THE SOLDIER THERE FOR THE FAMINE was
[2:21:53] grievable.
[2:21:57] HE NEVER LOST HIS COVENANT. HE NEVER
[2:21:59] LOST HIS COVENANT.
[2:22:02] AMEN.
[2:22:03] BUT YOU UNDERSTAND HE DID SOMETHING THAT
[2:22:07] WAS NOT FOUNDATIONAL GOODS.
[2:22:13] Somebody can say praise the Lord.
[2:22:17] Amen.
[2:22:17] Amen. As brother Brandham would say, we
[2:22:20] don't have the time or maybe we read it
[2:22:22] quickly
[2:22:24] that you can see what brother Brandham
[2:22:26] is saying.
[2:22:30] He said finally in the he said then
[2:22:34] GOD WANTS TO SEPARATE YOURSELF
[2:22:36] AND GET SO FAR AWAY FROM THE THINGS till
[2:22:38] you don't even see them at all.
[2:22:41] [Music]
[2:22:43] AMEN. GOD WANT YOU TO SEPARATE FROM
[2:22:46] THINGS.
[2:22:49] BUT THAT IS NOT CONDITIONAL.
[2:22:52] That is foundational.
[2:22:57] See the difference?
[2:23:00] See the difference?
[2:23:02] [Music]
[2:23:06] Hallelujah. We don't we don't have the
[2:23:08] time. We go quickly through it.
[2:23:10] IN GENESIS 13:14,
[2:23:15] after Lot
[2:23:18] separated. Now watch very carefully.
[2:23:22] I trust you still with me.
[2:23:26] Look how Abraham separated from Lot.
[2:23:31] What a gentleman he was.
[2:23:35] The Bible says,
[2:23:38] come on. The Bible tells us,
[2:23:42] look,
[2:23:44] AND THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM, the Lot
[2:23:47] was separated from
[2:23:58] Oh,
[2:24:02] look. Abraham,
[2:24:05] you know how he separated from Lot?
[2:24:08] You know what he did to Lord?
[2:24:10] He said, "Lord, come.
[2:24:13] We have too many troubles with the
[2:24:14] hurts.
[2:24:17] You choose."
[2:24:18] Amen.
[2:24:23] Amen.
[2:24:24] Hallelujah.
[2:24:25] Hallelujah.
[2:24:26] Brothers,
[2:24:27] that's the way God wants you to separate
[2:24:30] from the world.
[2:24:33] Hallelujah.
[2:24:36] COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:24:38] THAT'S THE WAY GOD WANTS YOU TO SEPARATE
[2:24:40] from unbelievers.
[2:24:43] What do YOU DO WITH UNBELIEVERS IN YOUR
[2:24:45] HOUSE?
[2:24:46] You kick them out.
[2:24:48] [Applause]
[2:24:52] Uhhuh.
[2:24:54] Abraham never kick Lot out.
[2:24:57] Look the LOOK THE THE CHARACTER OF
[2:24:59] ABRAHAM.
[2:25:02] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:05] Look the quality of Abraham.
[2:25:13] Hallelujah.
[2:25:14] Somebody can say praise the Lord.
[2:25:17] CHURCH THE BRIDE HAS A DIFFERENT QUALITY
[2:25:21] BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS. SHE DON'T
[2:25:24] HAS TO FIGHT.
[2:25:26] SHE CAN LOVE HER ENEMIES
[2:25:29] BECAUSE SHE DON'T HAS TO FIGHT FOR HER
[2:25:31] RIGHTS.
[2:25:34] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:36] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:37] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:37] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:38] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:39] Genesis 13:14.
[2:25:42] You can see Lot separated from Abraham.
[2:25:46] Hallelujah.
[2:25:46] Hallelujah. Then Genesis 13,
[2:25:49] WE FIND OUT HE MOVED OUT OF EGYPT BACK
[2:25:52] TO THE PROMISED LAND.
[2:25:56] AND THE BIBLE SAYS HE DWELT IN THE
[2:25:58] PROMISED LAND. THAT WAS NOT CONDITIONAL
[2:26:03] FOUNDATIONAL.
[2:26:05] GOD CAN ONLY BLESS YOU
[2:26:08] AS LONG AS YOU ARE IN the promises.
[2:26:11] [Applause]
[2:26:11] [Music]
[2:26:15] Stay with me for a few minutes because
[2:26:17] the picture must become clear.
[2:26:20] Everything we do has nothing to do with
[2:26:23] the covenant.
[2:26:25] I DRINK AS MUCH AS I WANT.
[2:26:30] I SMOKE as much as I want.
[2:26:35] I COMMIT ADULTERY AS MUCH AS I WANT.
[2:26:41] But I don't want
[2:26:44] [Music]
[2:26:49] I'M NOT AFRAID
[2:26:51] THAT I LOSE MY COVENANT
[2:26:54] BECAUSE I CANNOT LOSE MY COVENANT.
[2:27:02] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:08] QUICKLY.
[2:27:11] Genesis 14,
[2:27:14] Lot because of trouble,
[2:27:17] he becomes A SLAVE.
[2:27:20] AND WHAT IS ABRAHAM DOING? HE'S GOING
[2:27:23] AFTER HIM.
[2:27:26] IS THAT RIGHT? ABRAHAM IS FIGHTING FOR
[2:27:31] LOT.
[2:27:33] [Music]
[2:27:38] Somebody can say amen.
[2:27:43] But he never went to Sodom.
[2:27:45] He never went to Sodom.
[2:27:49] He stayed in Canaan.
[2:27:53] Somebody can say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:27:56] GENESIS 14,
[2:27:59] HE RECEIVED COMMUNION.
[2:28:02] AMEN.
[2:28:04] [Music]
[2:28:05] HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:06] HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:07] Genesis 14, he received communion.
[2:28:13] As we talk about that,
[2:28:15] he was Mazdc coming
[2:28:18] with bread and wine
[2:28:21] after the battle of the kings.
[2:28:24] Now understand the church. YOU
[2:28:27] PERSONALLY
[2:28:29] walk the same way that Abraham went.
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:36] Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] Now we come to another one.
[2:28:40] Genesis 14:20.
[2:28:43] I think it's 14:20.
[2:28:45] Abraham
[2:28:47] paid tithe,
[2:28:51] paying tithe
[2:28:53] is not conditional,
[2:28:57] but paying tithe
[2:28:59] is foundational.
[2:29:02] [Music]
[2:29:09] Look, and he blessed be the most high
[2:29:12] God which has delivered thine enemies
[2:29:14] into thine hand.
[2:29:17] And he gave him tithe of all.
[2:29:23] Paying tithe is not a condition.
[2:29:27] Paying tithe belongs to the foundation.
[2:29:33] Hallelujah.
[2:29:34] Hallelujah.
[2:29:37] Somebody can say praise the Lord.
[2:29:40] I
[2:29:40] I TELL YOU WHEN I SAW THAT I WAS JUMPING
[2:29:44] AT HOME.
[2:29:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:29:54] HALLELUJAH.
[2:29:56] Then Genesis 15:1,
[2:29:59] we quickly go through with it.
[2:30:02] After all those things,
[2:30:06] after these things,
[2:30:09] the word of the Lord came to Abraham
[2:30:13] in a vision.
[2:30:17] [Music]
[2:30:18] I wished
[2:30:21] I wish that goes into us.
[2:30:24] After all the foundational things,
[2:30:34] the word of the Lord came unto Abraham,
[2:30:38] saying,
[2:30:39] "Fear not, Abraham.
[2:30:43] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[2:30:46] reward.
[2:30:50] It was church. It was after these
[2:30:53] things,
[2:30:55] after these foundational things
[2:30:58] that God spoke to him.
[2:31:02] All the things we do, we do not because
[2:31:05] it's a condition.
[2:31:13] Become that clear.
[2:31:16] WE DO THINGS NOT because they are
[2:31:18] conditional.
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:22] They belong to a foundation.
[2:31:28] If you PAY TITHING
[2:31:30] AS a condition,
[2:31:33] there's no blessing connected to it.
[2:31:38] Amen.
[2:31:41] I had a brother coming to me not long
[2:31:43] ago
[2:31:45] from from my own church. He said to me,
[2:31:48] "Brother, I really don't understand.
[2:31:52] I pay my tithe and it looks like I have
[2:31:55] never enough money."
[2:32:03] I said to him, "Brother, there's nothing
[2:32:05] wrong.
[2:32:07] Just learn to pay your tithing
[2:32:11] not as a condition.
[2:32:16] Learn you pay your tithing
[2:32:19] as a foundation.
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:26] Hallelujah.
[2:32:27] Hallelujah.
[2:32:28] THEN I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY bank account.
[2:32:34] then I don't care if my bank account is
[2:32:37] full or not
[2:32:42] because I pay it as a foundation.
[2:32:47] I DON'T PAY IT SO THAT GOD BLESS ME NOW.
[2:32:52] NO.
[2:32:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:57] Somebody can say amen.
[2:32:59] Hallelujah.
[2:33:00] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[2:33:01] Is that okay when I talk like this?
[2:33:03] I know I'm not the pastor here. I cannot
[2:33:06] hide. I am a pastor.
[2:33:09] I cannot hide.
[2:33:11] You know, this is what I want the church
[2:33:12] to really to understand.
[2:33:15] OUR NORMAL LIFE. OUR NORMAL life in in
[2:33:19] my own life.
[2:33:20] Our normal life.
[2:33:24] Amen. Amen. Let me go on.
[2:33:26] Genesis. Uh let me read quickly what
[2:33:29] brother Brandham said in Masterpiece.
[2:33:33] Here's where I'm coming from. You bring
[2:33:35] back the the the Genesis 15
[2:33:39] verse one. And God spoke to him in a
[2:33:43] vision.
[2:33:44] [Music]
[2:33:48] Genesis 12.
[2:33:50] God just spoke to him. But now he speaks
[2:33:53] to him through a vision.
[2:33:57] This is like prophetic.
[2:34:01] Hallelujah.
[2:34:03] AFTER ALL, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
[2:34:06] AFTER ALL THE THINGS.
[2:34:09] COME ON CHURCH. AFTER ALL THE THINGS
[2:34:12] BECOMING FOUNDATIONAL.
[2:34:15] NOW God speaks to you. Come on. God
[2:34:18] speaks to you. NOT BECAUSE OF A
[2:34:21] CONDITION
[2:34:22] BUT BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS BECOMING
[2:34:24] FOUNDATIONAL.
[2:34:26] NOW GOD can speak TO YOU TODAY
[2:34:30] THROUGH A VISION
[2:34:32] THROUGH A PROPHET THROUGH A PROPHETIC
[2:34:34] MESSAGE.
[2:34:36] GOD CAN SPEAK TO YOU PERSONALLY.
[2:34:39] COME ON CHURCH. WHEN I READ THIS
[2:34:42] MESSAGE,
[2:34:44] GOD IS SPEAKING TO ME.
[2:34:47] [Applause]
[2:34:50] HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:51] HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:51] HALLELUJAH. We don't have time.
[2:34:54] masterpiece.
[2:34:56] NOW THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE Godman
[2:35:00] got an offer
[2:35:02] and changed FROM SUPERNATURAL TO THE
[2:35:06] VISION.
[2:35:10] The supernatural God
[2:35:13] has changed himself
[2:35:16] to a vision.
[2:35:19] Hallelujah.
[2:35:23] Hallelujah.
[2:35:24] Hallelujah.
[2:35:25] Amen.
[2:35:25] Amen.
[2:35:26] And the VISION
[2:35:30] is then projected
[2:35:34] to the image.
[2:35:40] And the vision was projected into the
[2:35:43] image.
[2:35:46] Hallelujah.
[2:35:47] Hallelujah.
[2:35:47] Hallelujah.
[2:35:48] Hallelujah.
[2:35:50] Can we understand that when God speak to
[2:35:53] us prophetic,
[2:35:56] he speaks to us through a vision
[2:36:01] and then that vision
[2:36:03] is PROJECTED
[2:36:06] into the image AND THE IMAGE IS you
[2:36:11] [Music]
[2:36:13] become the word.
[2:36:16] [Music]
[2:36:16] [Applause]
[2:36:18] Or can I say
[2:36:20] you become God?
[2:36:24] Can I say that?
[2:36:27] Is that right? BECAUSE THE SUPERNATURAL
[2:36:30] IS GOD. HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A
[2:36:33] VISION,
[2:36:36] prophetic message. NOW THE VISION, THE
[2:36:39] PROPHETIC MESSAGE.
[2:36:41] HE PROJECTED THE IMAGE.
[2:36:44] WHAT DO WE HAVE THEN?
[2:36:46] MAN IN THE IMAGE OF GOD.
[2:36:55] HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:56] HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:56] Quickly we go. We don't we don't read
[2:36:58] everything. Genesis 17.
[2:37:01] Circumcision.
[2:37:04] CIRCUMCISION
[2:37:05] is not a condition.
[2:37:10] [Music]
[2:37:12] Yes. Yes.
[2:37:15] Circumcision is not a condition.
[2:37:18] Circumcision is a foundation.
[2:37:23] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:37:27] condition.
[2:37:30] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[2:37:32] foundation.
[2:37:36] You must be born again.
[2:37:46] you're there
[2:37:49] then Genesis 18
[2:37:51] remember Abraham on his way to all
[2:37:56] things
[2:37:59] we are on our journey to all things
[2:38:00] right
[2:38:02] who is still on his journey
[2:38:05] who still on his journey
[2:38:09] we are on our journey
[2:38:12] Not back into the mind,
[2:38:15] back to be manifested sons and daughters
[2:38:17] of God.
[2:38:20] Hallelujah.
[2:38:21] Hallelujah.
[2:38:22] Hallelujah. Genesis 18 after so many
[2:38:26] years.
[2:38:27] You see Elohim coming to Abraham.
[2:38:30] Abraham an old man.
[2:38:33] What an attitude.
[2:38:36] What an attitude. Attitude
[2:38:39] is not a condition. The right attitude
[2:38:43] belongs to the foundation.
[2:38:47] [Music]
[2:38:48] In one message, brother Brennan said,
[2:38:52] he said, uh, quickening power
[2:38:56] is here this morning.
[2:39:00] Do you believe quickening power
[2:39:02] is here this evening?
[2:39:05] any sense. It depends what attitude you
[2:39:08] have
[2:39:10] if it does you good or not.
[2:39:15] So the attitude, the right attitude is
[2:39:19] not a condition.
[2:39:22] But the right attitude belongs to the
[2:39:25] foundation.
[2:39:27] Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:39:31] Hallelujah.
[2:39:32] Hallelujah.
[2:39:33] Amen.
[2:39:33] Amen. And then Genesis 18, what an
[2:39:37] attitude.
[2:39:39] He fell down. He worshiped. He invited
[2:39:43] him home. He make something to eat for
[2:39:45] him. No critic.
[2:39:48] No complaint. HALLELUJAH. NO COMPLAIN OF
[2:39:52] ABRAHAM. No critic.
[2:39:55] No complaints. No murmur.
[2:40:00] Where are we this evening?
[2:40:05] I trust we come into this meeting
[2:40:09] not complaining,
[2:40:11] not murmuring.
[2:40:13] I trust we came into the meeting with a
[2:40:16] heart full of thanksgiving.
[2:40:19] Who came in this meeting with a heart
[2:40:21] full of thanksgiving,
[2:40:22] [Music]
[2:40:24] WHO CAME THIS EVENING WITH A HEART FULL
[2:40:27] OF THANKS AND FULL OF GLORY.
[2:40:31] YES, WE WAIT FOR 2,000 YEARS.
[2:40:35] YES, ABRAHAM WAITED FOR SO LONG
[2:40:39] AND NOW HE CAME AGAIN.
[2:40:42] THE SAME ONE THAT MADE THE PROMISE
[2:40:45] WAS PRESENT. THE SAME ONE THAT MADE THE
[2:40:48] PROMISE IS PRESENT THIS EVENING. THE
[2:40:52] SAME ONE IS PRESENT TONIGHT.
[2:40:55] WHAT KIND OF ATTITUDE DO WE HAVE THIS
[2:40:57] EVENING SITTING IN A MEETING like this?
[2:41:01] [Applause]
[2:41:05] Hallelujah.
[2:41:09] Amen.
[2:41:11] And then
[2:41:14] Abraham
[2:41:15] and Sarah
[2:41:16] brought forth
[2:41:19] then Abraham and Sarah
[2:41:21] brought forth the son.
[2:41:26] Can we believe that?
[2:41:29] Now the bride,
[2:41:31] Christ and the bride
[2:41:33] will bring forth.
[2:41:35] What son?
[2:41:37] What son you will bring forth?
[2:41:40] The son of man.
[2:41:44] Do we have sodom condition?
[2:41:46] Do we have sodom condition
[2:41:50] worse than it was in the days of brother
[2:41:54] Brandham?
[2:42:00] Hello. Hello.
[2:42:02] This is WORSE
[2:42:05] than it was when brother Brandham was
[2:42:07] here.
[2:42:13] We living in the days of Sodom.
[2:42:17] Is that right?
[2:42:19] Come on, church. What was in the days of
[2:42:21] Sodom?
[2:42:23] Remember the Lord was sitting in the
[2:42:25] gate.
[2:42:27] Two angels came. AMEN. AND THE WHOLE
[2:42:31] CITY,
[2:42:32] YOUNG AND OLD,
[2:42:35] CAME OUT BECAUSE NEW FLESH had arrived.
[2:42:41] And they KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF LOT.
[2:42:45] AND SAID, "GIVE US THESE MEN OUT."
[2:42:49] LORD TOOK HIS DAUGHTERS OUT
[2:42:53] AND TOLD HIM, "HERE YOU HAVE MY
[2:42:54] DAUGHTERS."
[2:42:56] WHAT DID THEY SAY? WE DON'T WANT
[2:42:58] DAUGHTERS. We want men.
[2:43:05] Come on, church. Where are we today? YOU
[2:43:09] AND UGANDA,
[2:43:10] MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BACK.
[2:43:13] YOUR GOVERNMENT IS still very
[2:43:14] conservative.
[2:43:17] GERMAN GOVERNMENT, EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT,
[2:43:21] ALL OTHER GOVERNMENTS, IT'S ROTTEN. IT'S
[2:43:24] SODOM.
[2:43:26] OUR CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN,
[2:43:28] [Applause]
[2:43:30] OUR CHILDREN, IN SCHOOL,
[2:43:34] they get taught
[2:43:40] different
[2:43:41] than what they are taught at home.
[2:43:47] I don't have time to go into details,
[2:43:51] but there's laws
[2:43:53] that we as parents
[2:43:57] cannot raise our children
[2:43:59] the way we want it.
[2:44:07] As it was in the days of Sodom,
[2:44:10] so shall it be when the son of man
[2:44:12] has been revealed.
[2:44:16] And at the end,
[2:44:18] Abraham and Sarah
[2:44:20] brought forth the son.
[2:44:24] What son?
[2:44:26] The son of man.
[2:44:29] I have five quotes. I don't want to read
[2:44:32] them.
[2:44:34] This is what brother Brandham said. He
[2:44:36] said, "Son of man ministry,
[2:44:39] son of man ministry."
[2:44:41] He said, "It is me and you together.
[2:44:45] We together.
[2:44:48] We together we will do it."
[2:44:52] That means your life is manifesting
[2:44:56] the son of man.
[2:45:00] Hallelujah.
[2:45:01] That is God's great covenant.
[2:45:04] Multiply
[2:45:06] and replenish.
[2:45:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A unconditional
[2:45:13] covenant.
[2:45:15] Build it upon a strong foundation.
[2:45:20] It's a picture become very clear
[2:45:23] all the things that we do. It's not
[2:45:26] conditions.
[2:45:27] It is foundation.
[2:45:30] God bless you.
[2:45:36] Let us stand together. I know it's
[2:45:38] becoming late. I know you have to go
[2:45:40] home.
[2:45:41] Some had to go home already. God bless
[2:45:44] you richly. Amen. Let us quickly pray.
[2:45:48] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[2:45:50] grace and for your mercy. We thank you
[2:45:52] for all that you have done for us. We
[2:45:54] thank you for your great picture. We
[2:45:57] thank you for Abraham's royal seed
[2:46:00] traveling the same journey tonight.
[2:46:03] Father, we pray that you bless each and
[2:46:05] everyone in a mighty way. Father, may it
[2:46:09] not just be a sermon, but may it be a
[2:46:11] reality
[2:46:14] that can everybody can take home into
[2:46:17] their lives, into their families, into
[2:46:19] their groups, into their churches. So
[2:46:22] understand, we have an unconditional
[2:46:24] covenant
[2:46:26] and this house is built on a strong
[2:46:28] foundation. We thank you and we praise
[2:46:31] you. Bless this church. Bless the
[2:46:33] ministries. Bless brother Steven. Bless
[2:46:36] all the ministers. Father, all the new
[2:46:38] ministers, bless each and everyone. We
[2:46:41] bless and pray it in your name in Jesus
[2:46:44] Christ name.
[2:46:45] Amen.
[2:46:46] Amen. Amen.
[2:46:47] God bless you.
[2:46:49] Hallelujah. God bless you.
[2:46:51] It was a joy to be with you.
[2:46:54] Amen. It was a joy to be with you. And
[2:46:57] if you don't see here again,
[2:46:59] [Music]
[2:47:01] we can meet on the other side,
[2:47:04] right? And there we have a little bit
[2:47:06] more time
[2:47:09] because time shall be no more.
[2:47:12] Amen. God bless you till we meet again.
[2:47:14] Amen.

[2:47:29] Let us give a hand to Jesus.
[2:47:33] Amen.
[2:47:33] Amen.
[2:47:36] You see, sometimes you know the will of
[2:47:38] God.
[2:47:40] Uh
[2:47:42] for those of you who have been going
[2:47:45] through the book of Galatians,
[2:47:49] there's no explanation needed.
[2:47:53] Are you together with me? Amen. An
[2:47:56] unconditional covenant.
[2:47:59] It's not Jesus plus.
[2:48:04] It's complete.
[2:48:06] Him in you
[2:48:08] is all that you need.
[2:48:12] And all these other things are
[2:48:14] foundations
[2:48:16] because there's no man who can build a
[2:48:19] house without a foundation,
[2:48:23] you know. But God gives those
[2:48:26] as part of our journey back home
[2:48:31] and to check out on your obedience
[2:48:35] but not because there are conditions to
[2:48:37] your covenant.
[2:48:40] Amen. God bless you. Do you say amen?
[2:48:46] Do you ask the brother take our
[2:48:47] greetings back home?
[2:48:52] Amen. Amen. blessed brother Josha K and
[2:48:55] brother SA maybe
