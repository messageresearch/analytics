uh it's a it's it's finally the end it's a short quick work to be done you don't have a century time to go in the Rapture you're called the 11th hours worker it's a quick work to be done amen and then we go home that's why today you're quickly and feed on the word of God you don't have to Bible school for years to learn about the message you don't have to study somewhere you just come to the service and God don't take ten years sometimes it goes in a minute in a half years amen Amina this is a quick work that goes amen I mean making calling the last ones out making them ready for the Rapture amen Amina this is the next step the change of the body amen Amina this is just the next step we are just going in amen what a wonderful work the Lord is this evening we just want to continue on the thoughts on on after the Revival has begun always I want to read one scripture also maybe we stand together and then we want to read from the book of Genesis we want to read again Genesis we just as we was reading this morning we want to go to this is when the Revival begins when God is coming on the scene amen Amina yes he amen this is when Revival begins not when man is coming on the scene but when God is coming amen we want to go to Genesis 18. in Genesis and uh verses one and two you want to read again I mean this morning we have read from Genesis 2. and we have seen how that great Revival started and then we know the fall came in amen but we are promised a Total Restoration where the church is become back six thousand years of creation and now we had six thousand years of redemption amen amen and Redemption a greater work than creation so what God is doing now is it great to work what he had done then amen Amina and we're a part of it Genesis 18. and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memories and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked in low three men stood before him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sights pass not away I pray thee from thy servant foreign [Music] amen Amina let us pray together and if there's anybody here that want to be remembered just make it known to him to the uplifting of your hands let's believe like we sang this morning amen amen the heavenly father also I have lifted my hands father we pray we know you know what we need you know what we really need we pray this evening just have mercy again on us give us the abundance of your mercy and Grace why we just heal yourself for real ourselves for service we pray that you will bless us one more time in Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you maybe I mean amen amen so this evening we just first we just want to uh I don't want to call it a little studying yeah do we want to see what God is really doing and what God has done at what time what time we are living in to raise us the level the level of awarenessa because brother Adam said if God is not recognized his power is not revealed so when God is recognized when God is acknowledged when God is yeah when people understand God is present like the woman she understood next to all the years of of problems she has [Music] she never developed a bad attitude she was for 12 years the Bible says she had that sickness and yet when Jesus came yes she was quite aware and awake she paid respect to him she said if I can only touch his garments not then when he is touching me but when I only can touch his gums then I will be made what a respects what an attitude of a woman was for more than 12 years the right kind of attitude so that we just come and touch him because if we touch him then all things are possible amen Amina amen Amina amen so so uh we just as we have read and also we want to say brother Branham when brother random said about Revival foreign this time and decision for everything there's a time of planting there is a time of of harvesting there's a time of growing there's a season for everything amen and we have to understand the seasons so that we act in the right kind of way if it is if it is planting time it's not the time of harvest if it is growing time you should not go on the field trying to harvest you should know what we are doing today amen we should know where we are absolutely surely it's also the planting time for some it's harvest for some some some crops is Harvest everything [Music] I mean okay okay fine you understood that see that you get it so there's but now we really want to see what what season we are in what is the main season we are in I said amen amen what is the main what is the dominating season and when the prophet comes when God sends a special man God comes himself on the scene and it always shows it's the changing of the seasons amen amen that's how we saw in the beginning you know as Adam actually came on the scene there was a change of seasons amen that's the Revival started amen God came on the scene God was doing a work with his children it showed a change of the seasons amen I mean I want to let you know the prophet arrives when the prophet Rises on the scene when the prophet rise on the scene amen then there's a change taking place amen Amina we just must we hold that really in mind when God is coming on the scene in a special way there is a change of the Season something is starting and I just want to let you know that we are after foreign without the foreign foreign [Applause] um [Music] [Applause] no church anymore I'm going to call you bride [Music] foreign foreign foreign okay [Applause] [Applause] that's what he can say you have no rights [Music] [Applause] everybody can you Jesus says Adam can you see the second Adam oh and Adam welcome it he's speaking through William Brothers so close together but you don't see the difference was not the son of man brother was a son of a man [Applause] it is not me I'm just jealous so then when I speak he can speak [Applause] he's using my body [Applause] amen amen so then he said and I call you brighter so it's separated just for him marriage amen amen if you call a certain lady your bride well that speaks of marriage either you have married her or you know or you want to marry her but your choice is falling Christ's Choice praise is Fallen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so we understand how it starts how the Revival started I want to make it maybe a little bit more plain through to really uh um another example in the Bible there's there's something that really started what we can see in the Old Testament amen and just just keep in mind we're speaking about after the Revival has begun today before the Revival has begun it was not a dangerous time but as soon as the Revival started in the garden as soon as Adam Adam identified who she is [Music] deception started amen Amina amen amen you can understand why the prophet when he came to the seventh seal he said I have to keep quiet about that because if Satan gets a hold of it he can cause a great damage as he did in the Garden of Eden amen amen but then a little later brother randomly openly came out of Christ The Mystery of God revealed he could tell us what was once in the mind of God he's now in the hearts it's now in the church crying for Expressions that's why we are here today that's why you live in this hour I'm sorry that's why God placed you in Africa that's why God placed you in a certain family that's why God placed you in a certain District that's why God bless you in a certain area because only there foreign then you put into the right kind of ground and the right kind of environment he brings forth yeah when God placed you from the after he made it perfect when God made that's why all that I can only say you're welcome I'm a white guy you're a black guy stay the way God Made You huh I don't I don't want to become black I don't I don't sit in the sun to be burned so he made me white yeah because only that way you can manifest that God created you for now [Applause] what he created US foreign hallelujah hallelujah what a time that we are in Hallelujah is it most glorious time and the most dangerous as soon as the enemy Satan Stan hurt the words of Adam amen amen he didn't know who Eve was Satan has no access to that he needs the information amen amen so as soon as he heard it because what Adam was doing was an opened was a public marriage ceremony amen amen the first marriage that took place was in the Garden of Eden marriage is the oldest institution that God has given it was performed in Eden there you had yet there you had Adam they had the woman and there you had God Amen Amina amen Amina amen the first marriage that took place and at that marriage as it is as it is the husband has to make the word um this is now bone of my bones this is the Flesh of My Flesh I will call her your name and she shall be called a woman not eat take our because she should not be the mother of all living his womb alone [Music] I know and look what Adam has done look what Adam has done and his wife being deceived when his wife was found in the era he redeemed her back [Applause] foreign [Applause] by giving her his life [Applause] that's how Christ redeemed Us by giving us his life away amen Amina so when Adam said this this is no bone of my bones this is the Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out I think I said it here before you are only my womb and Adam and Adam lost his womb because before that he was both masculine and feminine and I didn't know is that right take it over he was both but now however God had taken that feminist part out of him that rip out of him that feminist part out of him and made a woman for him called that beautiful lady expressed her he said she looked beautiful as Marilyn Monroe Avenue Monroe amen Amina the prophets could see now because he saw her he said she was beautiful amen amen amen amen so she was taken out of men no again I want to really point out Adam never said your name shall be called your name Shall be Called Eve because she should not be the mother of all living but she became the mother of Allah she became the mother of Cain that's what we say if the church stays the church not come under the umbrella under there under the headship of Jesus Christ she is an open Target she will bring forth whatever she receives this is Noni what we see today what is the church bringing forward is separated only to Christ yeah amen Amina it's a sacred trust yes give to me the Bride of Jesus Christ why Raji because you are ordained to bring forth God katwanda Hallelujah can we believe that amen amen Abel was the son of God Abel was the son of God is the Son of God not God um amen amen we will come to this a little later amen because we really want to see what time is it says started Satan heard that understand he heard that yeah he heard Adam making that announcement then he knew this is my chance now amen Amina and finding Eve or finding the woman without your protection of the man she's vulnerable she is as the woman was in the man she was protected as long as we are in Christ we are protected [Applause] amen Amina stay in Christ that's your protection hallelujah hallelujah as long as she was in Adam no deception possible because Adam was a prophet that's why Adam was not deceived amen amen when the prophet is on the scene there's no deception possible because the prophets [Applause] when the woman introduced that sex act to him he was not deceived he was not deceived church amen amen when Christ happens took our place he was not deceived he took the place [Applause] yet he he was born without sins he took the curse amen Amina what I really want to point out is what has started and where we are now amen where we are really now what has happened in our day amen Amina where we are at Liberty if you take if you take history if you take the message if you take the Bible where are we at where do we stand foreign is this the end when Daniel Daniel saw in that Vision all the kingdoms coming oh welcome back coming from nebuchadneads of the head of gold um you go into history you find all the great kingdoms amen amen from the time of Daniel when he told the king you are the head of gold is that right take it over then came the body we can

real Madonna hallelujah hallelujah don't fail to catch a church he said you know the angel of the Lord is very close do you sense his presence and then brother Branham is telling that woman he said

reality so while she was rolling out of her bed so anyway she was instant healed [Applause] that's not me telling you it was a prophet telling us my Ministry is to declare him that he is here do you still believe that okay do you believe that he or he is still here now no the Holy Ghost was there through the church ages the Holy Ghost was always there but brother Adam says but my Ministry is to declare that he into yet is here now the entire Holy Ghost where governments the person of the Holy Ghost Christ himself what a change what a Revival has started hallelujah what a Revival has started amen amen hallelujah Amina do you believe that I don't ask do you feel it do you believe it this goes beyond feelings goes beyond emotions can you believe without seeing a miracle ah one day the angel of the Lord like what I'm saying came to brother Branham brother Branham in the early years he had his big campaigns and he was promising the guarantee when you come to the service situate that you see a miracle they was announcing that guarantee when you come to the service you see a miracle foreign I ask you what was that doing your belief all things are possible if you only believe it is don't wait for a miracle to believe those signs over and over shall follow them not the believer team Wicked his eyes follow the signs ah hallelujah hallelujah amen Amina so his ministry is to declare him that he is here now [Music] is he is he still here I know do you believe Jesus Christ is still here brother Branham left the scene but he stayed he is here the person of the Holy Ghost it's in the meeting before you came he came Jada and waited it for you Hallelujah Jesus yes was waiting at the well then the woman came is that correct he said I have to go in a certain way because there's a seed

be perfect as my Father in Heaven is no no we don't have time to go there did not Jesus say that yes didn't know Jesus say that yes Jesus told us yes be be you perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect this is the sermon for itself but because that perfection doesn't mean making no mistakes making that does not mean making no mistakes can I ask you a question can you be perfect like your father in Heaven is perfect [Music] ah Sunday morning how in the world can we make it did Jesus became perfect yes he was born sinless yes he was born flawless amen Amina was he born without sin and

believe that you can be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect [Music] I don't speak yoga of making no mistakes because for our mistakes the blood of Jesus Christ stands um but the father hey baba don't need the blood of Jesus Christ you're with me so we are speaking of a different perfection actually the Bible says be ye complete as your father in Heaven is completely that Perfection is not being Flawless come on go that Perfection is a higher perfection is now in the church [Applause] this is our perfection can we say praise the Lord no I know here you are just thinking thinking what is your heart telling you is your heart telling you this is the truth your head might tell you it's impossible because excuse me the more educated we become and get the more educated we become

maybe you can bring the scripture it's nice I I have not really I don't have written it down but it was it said that stone was smiting the image at the feet and making the whole image as powder is amen Amina yes for as much as thou saw as the stone was cut out of Mountain without hands break into pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver the gold the great God has made known to the king
