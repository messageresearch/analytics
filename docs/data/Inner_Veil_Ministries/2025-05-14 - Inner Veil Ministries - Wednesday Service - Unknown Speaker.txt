Lord, we are so humbled to be in your presence. And Lord, as we've come expectantly, may you come and speak to us, Lord. Whatever need is among your children, you promise to supply the needs of your children. Anyway, Lord, we appreciate you for everything that you've done for us today and also look forward for your glory and testimonies among our lives, Lord. As we're going to share the word, may you bless it, Lord. Anoint it, Lord, for the benefit of our spiritual life, Lord. even our pastor who is among us Lord bless him abundantly for the missionary that is waiting on him on Friday we pray that Lord take care of everything Lord and everywhere he's going to minister Lord may you anoint the service Lord and also give him a safe traveling journeys to reach there Lord We also commit our pastor abroad that Lord you give him safety Lord and protection until he comes back Lord there we shall give glory and honor to you Lord and also we commit this service in your hands take care of it all for us we can't do anything without you. We love you Lord. We appreciate you. In the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh I have almost nothing to share but since an opportunity is granted by the pastor and let me just keep continuing with where we ended last Wednesday. Let me continue with where we ended last Wednesday. Amen. Amen. Hope it will be a blessing to us. Now the Bible says uh in the book of uh Ecclesiastes 12 verse 13 the Bible says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man. And also so we are going to follow this from the book of Mark chapter [Music] 10. Chapter 10. Let us only read one verse and we see it. We shall follow it up. Mark chapter 10 and verse 21. The Bible says, "Then Jesus beholding him, loved him, and saith unto him, One [Music] thing, go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come take up the cross, and follow me. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word. You know the Bible said, "Keep the commandments. Praise the Lord. Fear God and keep the commandments. Therefore, like I said, the word fear God doesn't mean to be afraid of God, you know, or to be a scared of him or something like that. Praise the Lord. To believers, God is our friend. Praise the Lord. And the way he deals with us, he deals with us as his children. That's why he can't hide any inheritance for us. anything for us he presents it but [Music] unbelievers it sounds like parables to them praise the lord like eternal life I don't think whether any believers have ideas of eternal life there must be something to be done and that one it's Christ whom you have received who will tell you what to do next. Praise the Lord. Fear God, keep his commandments. In other words, respect [Music] God. Praise the Lord. Give him reverence in order to tell you which commandments to do. Fear God and keep the commandments and God demands it. Praise the Lord. Last time we talked about Joseph and Joseph was one who moved without his pastor around him. He moved. The pastors were not there. Praise the Lord. Far off. Praise the Lord. But the fear of God in him helped him to overcome all the challenges that he had. The wife came, the boss's wife came. Lie with me. Know that he did it daily. He didn't say it once and gave up. He consistently requested for him to lie with him. Praise the Lord. Lie with me. But because he feared the Lord the presence of God was along with him. Joseph got wisdom from God overcome that woman. Praise the Lord. What was that? The fear of God. Praise the Lord. The fear of God caused Joseph overcome such matters of his life. Now we are talking about like pastor knocked something which was mine last last Sunday. Pastor talked about something which was mine last Sunday. Praise the Lord. I know the youths know about this now. The youths know about this that Daniel He had the fear of God until when he brought the nice meals for the kings. Praise the Lord. The Bible say, the prophet says that he would not defile himself. Praise the Lord. Let me ask the question. I don't know which kind of food it was to defile this man. Praise the Lord. Because when you read the Bible, they were told to eat good food because they were going to be presented before the king. The food seems to be good. It was good. But because the enemy or idols were the ones doing it for him, They refused it. Praise the Lord. The Bible clearly says Joseph was handsome. And that was true. But because the lies of the enemy came through the woman that you handsome, I mean, Joseph never had that statement. He just said the lies. I can't hack yet. Praise the Lord. Even us as young people. Enemies can your enemy can appoint you and say you're a beautiful girl. Even you handsome man. But as long as it's not God saying that, Those are lies of the enemy because he's using your beauty to implant something that will defile that beauty. Praise the Lord. If you have the fear of God to help you, notice how the enemy speaks and God that thing will be there. Praise the Lord whereby the enemy can speak right words. If he's the enemy, I can't take his words. But if God is speaking the same words I've heard from the enemy, read it to me. Praise the Lord. Otherwise without they can learn something different in your life taken away from your testimony. Praise the Lord. Now this young man Christ came before him even ran before Christ. What did he want from there? something he was lacking. Praise the Lord. When you read the Bible, the Bible clearly says, "The young man kept the commandments which Jesus had told him. I've kept them from my youths." Meaning he had good mother, he had good father. Praise the Lord. But one thing he was lacking. Praise the Lord. And that thing the only person who gives it to you Christ himself. So if you come to him himself, the one who gives you that thing, what is that? Who gives you the nature of God helps you to fear God in order to overcome the enemy in anything. Praise the Lord. What happened here? This young man, praise the Lord, the young man met Christ. Amen. When he met Christ, the prophet says, he was confronted with another problem. And it confronts all of us, eternal life. Religion doesn't give us eternal life. Religious is a coverary but it don't it don't give us eternal life. him. That man told the young man who was taught with the best teachers there was yet I mean he was yet lacking something. He had good teachers that there was. Praise the Lord. But he was lacking something. Praise the Lord. What is good with this young man? What I admire from this young man. The prophet says this. He knew that he was lacking. That's what I admire from him. He knew that something on him was lacking. And what happened? He had to seek it. And when he sought it and the solution was given, that's where the problem came, even us. When Christ comes before us, there are many things he has carried for us. And when he doesn't when we don't give him a good environment, we don't benefit from them. Praise the Lord. So the young man knew he lacked something. But he put a lot of efforts to look for it because it's not Christ who went to him. It's him who Christ and he come to Christ him. what shall I do to do this? And the solution was given by he turned the solution aside and it was obvious. And the prophet says, so he knew the thoughts of the young man and said, "Keep the commandments." Praise the Lord. In other words, he wanted to see Christ wanted to see whe Amen. He wanted to see whether the young man fears God. Speaks, he will keep it. But God spoke to him solution. The Bible says which I grieve Praise the Lord. He went away sad. Praise the Lord. He was lacking something. Praise the Lord. And the prophet continues to say was to he was taught in the region of that day. Praise the Lord. in the law of that time. Yes. Those days by law and prophet and he was living in the law. Praise the Lord. But then what happened? He still didn't have eternal life. He wanted to know what to do. Been guided successfully. He's been guided successfully to that in the religion. But he when he was confronted with the eternal life refused to be here saying he was in the religion of that day. Praise the Lord. And then when he was confronted, praise the Lord, with eternal life itself, he refused to be guided to eternal life. Praise the Lord. And now let me say this. This young man had believed the laws. He knew the laws. Praise the Lord. Even in the message, we know the message. We know the Bible. We know about the godhead Jesus being God and his mysteries. But let me say like this. That way you were told well and that way Christ will love you for that. But that's not enough. Praise the Lord. You to come to church is not enough. You to read messages is not enough. What is enough is to meet Christ. show you another commandment that we lack. Praise the Lord. Sometimes Christ will come and then there are something he would like to say after you give him attention. Praise the Lord. Look at the scenario of Lazarus. When I read about Lazarus, he was dead. Praise the Lord. And Jesus came after many days or four something like that. Praise the Lord. And when he came, the man was dead. They had burdened him. Praise the Lord. Sitting on a grave. Jesus. Let me think. I think I will get the the verse so that we read it well. Praise the Lord. Mark Markapter 11. Yeah. Mark chapter 11. You know when Christ calls us or when we come to Christ, we come to be told what to do and how to go about things in our life if he doesn't talk to you when you are in his presence then wait praise the Lord when Christ doesn't talk to you in his presence wait either check out something may be wrong Praise the Lord. When Christ meets us or when we meet Christ, he has to speak. Praise the Lord. When this young man met Christ, when he met Christ, he had to speak to him. He had praise the Lord. And here comes a scenario. Lazarus Lazarus is dead And the butter.
