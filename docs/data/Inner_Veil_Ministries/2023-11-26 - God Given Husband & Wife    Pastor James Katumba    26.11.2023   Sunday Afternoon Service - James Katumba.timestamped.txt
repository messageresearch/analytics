[0:00] for any
[0:05] reason praise the name of the Lord we
[0:07] are living in such a
[0:10] time and after the the sister beating
[0:13] the
[0:14] husband and they tell her please go back
[0:17] to your
[0:18] place he says I don't want to leave this
[0:20] is my
[0:24] place and then you
[0:26] hear praise the name of our Lord
[0:30] sister beating the
[0:33] husband after beating the husband he
[0:36] says tell
[0:37] me if the husband
[0:39] refuses another punishment either look
[0:43] him
[0:44] outside or deny him
[0:48] food that kind of
[0:51] Str these are things which used to
[0:53] happen the other
[0:55] side that the husband doing but now you
[0:58] hear the wife doing
[1:02] where is the
[1:03] problem so we need to know our roles in
[1:09] marriage praise the name of our and we
[1:12] need to see that our marriage works
[1:16] out each and every one of us husband or
[1:21] wife we have a role to play in making
[1:24] this marriage
[1:26] successful it's not only the husband's
[1:29] responsibility
[1:31] it's not only the wife's
[1:33] responsibility but you see we need to go
[1:35] into the word of
[1:37] God what does the Lord require me to
[1:41] do to make this marriage work
[1:44] out and you are
[1:47] responsible for your
[1:49] marriage you are responsible because you
[1:53] chose to be in that
[1:55] marriage so make it work
[1:58] out praise the name of our Lord make it
[2:02] work
[2:03] out weaknesses will be there failures
[2:07] will be there but when those things are
[2:10] there how do you handle
[2:12] them now that's where the challenge
[2:16] is praise the name of the Lord how do
[2:19] you handle those kind of
[2:22] issues now you look at Adam Adam also
[2:26] had a challenge in his
[2:28] marriage
[2:31] the serpent came
[2:33] by and then came and took
[2:36] Eve deceived her and defiled
[2:40] her what did Adam
[2:44] do praise the name of our Lord Abraham
[2:47] had challenges in his
[2:51] marriage there was
[2:54] barness and then Sarah tells him go in
[2:58] at with my man
[3:01] now when he goes in the maid when the
[3:04] maid conceives then she starts despising
[3:09] Sarah and then Sarah started real
[3:12] treating in a rush
[3:15] way until she ran away and then the
[3:18] angel of the Lord told her go
[3:20] back when she gave birth and then now
[3:25] she she then then is started again you
[3:30] know mistreating
[3:32] Isaac and then you know Sarah said now
[3:35] this is
[3:36] enough go
[3:40] away with this son of the born
[3:44] woman and then the Bible says it hurt
[3:49] Abraham Sarah said let her go with her
[3:54] son but who brought Abraham in that
[3:57] problem Sarah
[4:00] but then sah was blaming Abraham for
[4:02] that
[4:05] problem until God told
[4:07] Abraham do what Sarah has told you and
[4:10] then sah Abraham released them they had
[4:14] challenges in their
[4:15] mind Isaac's marriage it also had
[4:20] challenges they spent about 20 years
[4:23] without giving
[4:25] birth but how do they handle it Rebecca
[4:29] also the
[4:30] mate but Rebecca didn't tell the
[4:33] mate that you go in with my husband
[4:37] Isaac you remember the story of Jacob
[4:41] When Rachel was not giving
[4:43] birth she gave in her M to
[4:46] Jacob and then when Le saw
[4:49] that richel had given him the
[4:52] m g
[4:54] her they had
[4:56] challenges but how were they handling
[4:59] those
[5:00] challenges we also need to learn from
[5:03] them praise the name of our Lord how do
[5:06] we handle our challenges
[5:09] at but when they had challenges they
[5:12] were not fighting one another they were
[5:14] not killing one another they had respect
[5:18] for one
[5:20] another Abraham had respect for
[5:26] Sarah praise the name of our Lord
[5:29] Rebecca
[5:30] had respect for
[5:33] Isaac they had respect for one
[5:37] another and even us in our marriages we
[5:40] need to learn to respect one
[5:44] another you need to learn and know just
[5:48] as you have your husband just as you
[5:50] have your wife they also human beings
[5:54] they have feelings like you have
[5:57] feels so the Bible says that treat
[6:01] others the way you want to be
[6:04] treated praise the name of our Lord you
[6:06] treat your husband if you also to be one
[6:10] treated
[6:11] well treat him well you treat your wife
[6:15] treat her well way you want to be
[6:18] treated praise the name of our Lord
[6:20] because these are two people who have
[6:21] come together different
[6:24] feelings different backgrounds
[6:28] of so you need to see that you
[6:31] contribute your
[6:33] part you play your
[6:36] role make your marriage work
[6:39] out it's not one
[6:43] way praise the name of there are things
[6:46] each of you has to
[6:49] contribute and God has put these things
[6:52] specifically in the
[6:54] word that there's always an
[6:57] exchange there is always leaning upon
[7:00] one
[7:02] another there's always complimenting one
[7:06] another there's always you know
[7:08] supporting one
[7:11] another praise the name of our Lord and
[7:14] this is what we see in the
[7:16] scriptures when Eve fell in half
[7:19] sin Adam came to see how she can be
[7:25] delivered praise the name of our Lord
[7:28] and this is the same way the Lord Jesus
[7:29] came he came and took our sin that we
[7:33] can be
[7:35] delivered praise the name of our Lord
[7:37] and that should be the same thing in our
[7:39] marriages your love for your
[7:42] wife your love your love for your
[7:45] wife your love for your
[7:48] husband you know way the scripture say
[7:51] you should Este the other more than
[7:56] Yourself Praise the name of our Lord
[7:59] Este the other more than
[8:02] yourself before you eat are you
[8:05] concerned as she
[8:07] eaten before he eats are you concerned
[8:10] she has something to
[8:12] eat you know like some of the villages
[8:14] we have a some
[8:16] places even the communities we live
[8:18] in you find a man lives
[8:22] home without leaving any money then he
[8:25] goes in a trading
[8:27] center or a stage
[8:30] and then early in the morning is eating
[8:32] a lot
[8:36] of but has left
[8:39] nothing when the time to go back home
[8:42] comes passes by to
[8:45] eat and then aty doesn't want to
[8:49] eat there was a
[8:53] story this man here he only knows take
[8:56] away for
[8:58] himself
[9:00] and then when he brings it at
[9:03] home when he brings the food at for have
[9:07] cooked the food the money has left for
[9:09] them they cook food for the little money
[9:12] has left for
[9:15] them and then for him he brings take
[9:17] away
[9:20] chicken then he brings it and then he
[9:24] starts
[9:25] eating and he does it not
[9:28] once the wife just says please give me
[9:33] some that's not the marriage God wants
[9:35] us to
[9:36] have praise the name of our Lord whereby
[9:39] the husband only thinks about
[9:43] himself buying
[9:45] clothes buying shoes this new SC when it
[9:50] comes to the wife I don't have
[9:54] money when it comes to food changing
[9:58] meals money but he's able to eat food of
[10:01] 10,000 in
[10:04] town but he lives
[10:10] 2,000 that kind of not being concerned
[10:13] about one
[10:15] another that's not the marriage that's
[10:18] not the family that God would desire us
[10:21] to
[10:22] have actually as a family whatever you
[10:26] eat you should desire even your toake of
[10:31] or even better than what you
[10:33] eat praise the name of our Lord if it is
[10:36] getting something new you desire the
[10:39] other party to have it before you have
[10:43] it praise the name of that's how we
[10:46] should live as husband and
[10:48] wife that's how we should live in a
[10:51] family let us go in First Peter chapter
[10:58] 3
[11:04] First Peter chapter
[11:12] 3 and then verse
[11:15] one it says likewise ye wives be in
[11:20] subjection to your own
[11:22] husbands that if any obey not the word
[11:25] they also May without the word be one by
[11:30] the conversation of the
[11:44] wives praise the name of he says
[11:50] wives you have a testimony to
[11:54] live and the scripture says that your
[11:58] behavior
[12:00] avior can convert
[12:03] people who are
[12:05] outside praise the name of the Lord your
[12:08] conduct as a
[12:10] sister your conduct as a wife at
[12:14] home God desires
[12:17] you to be able to do the conduct
[12:20] according to the word of
[12:23] God that's what God requires of
[12:27] us and as a wife at
[12:29] home why do you spend time in Lum
[12:33] Mong why do you spend time in despising
[12:38] others this is many times what you
[12:41] find in the neighborhood all the time
[12:45] look at her look at this one look at
[12:48] their children now that kind of conduct
[12:52] cannot bring people to
[12:54] Christ but now the Bible is telling us
[12:57] that your behavior should be able to win
[13:01] people and then they bring them to
[13:04] Christ praise the name of our Lord the
[13:06] same thing with us
[13:08] husband where you walk from when they
[13:11] look at you at the people Desiring to be
[13:14] like
[13:15] you or they look at you as a different
[13:18] thing all
[13:20] together praise the name of our Lord
[13:22] then
[13:23] in while they beheld your CH
[13:25] conversation coupled with fear
[13:31] whose adoring let it not be the outward
[13:34] adoring of plating of the hair and of
[13:37] wearing of gold or of putting on
[13:46] appr
[13:48] now this ading is talking
[13:51] about is not saying don't dress
[13:57] outside but he's saying
[14:00] your dressing
[14:02] Insight should be more
[14:05] precious more than the outside
[14:08] dressing just as you care how you
[14:11] appear just as you care how you are
[14:13] dressed
[14:15] outside the scripture say you the inner
[14:21] man should be dressed with a
[14:25] spirit a me and quiet spirit
[14:31] praise the name of our something which
[14:33] is so precious
[14:35] before and that is the character of
[14:38] Jesus
[14:39] Christ so we need to have the character
[14:42] of Jesus
[14:43] Christ in our
[14:46] marriage praise the name of our Lord you
[14:48] have the character of Jesus Christ in
[14:51] all the things that you do that's the
[14:54] desire of
[14:56] God how you conduct before your husband
[15:00] how you conduct before your wife how you
[15:03] conduct before your children it should
[15:05] be the character of
[15:07] God now don't say me my my husband
[15:11] doesn't behave like
[15:13] that my wife doesn't behave like that
[15:16] how about you if for them they not
[15:19] behaving are you behaving according to
[15:22] the word
[15:23] of praise the name of because you has
[15:27] known God you need to behave according
[15:30] to the word but if you don't behave
[15:33] according to the
[15:34] word then you will be a
[15:39] hypocrite so you can't deliver the other
[15:41] person if they are
[15:43] wrong but if you are if they are wrong
[15:47] and you are doing right then God will
[15:50] hear your prayers to deliver the other
[15:53] person praise the name of our Lord you
[15:56] know there are some areas where if the
[15:59] husband is
[16:00] bad the wife will also change and become
[16:05] bad which is not right praise the name
[16:09] of our Lord then in verse five for after
[16:13] this man and the old times the holy
[16:16] women also who trusted in God adored
[16:19] themselves being in subjection unto
[16:22] their own
[16:27] husbands
[16:32] praise the name of our Lord he says the
[16:34] old
[16:38] women they dress
[16:42] themselves a mixed spirit and a quiet
[16:47] spirit and they were in subjection to
[16:50] their own
[16:53] husbands praise the name of Lord you
[16:55] know we are in the age of equal rights
[17:00] equal rights equal
[17:03] everything and until sometimes you may
[17:07] find the wife is more successful than
[17:09] the
[17:13] husband it's a time we are living in
[17:17] there is a church where you find the
[17:20] sisters are
[17:23] driving but the brothers are not
[17:25] driving but the sisters need sister
[17:28] Brothers to marry
[17:32] them and for women sometimes to get some
[17:36] of these
[17:39] jobs sometimes EAS for women to get
[17:43] jobs those who are educated more than
[17:46] the brothers who are
[17:48] educated but when you come to
[17:51] marriage take your
[17:53] position as a wife to be subjected to
[17:56] your husband because your subjection to
[18:00] your
[18:01] husband is your security is your
[18:05] protection praise the name of our Lord
[18:08] not because this not because that but
[18:12] that is your
[18:14] security that is your protection and
[18:17] that's how the word of God can come and
[18:19] help
[18:19] you when you are obeying the word of
[18:23] God praise the name of our Lord then in
[18:26] verse six even as Sarah obeyed
[18:31] Abraham calling him
[18:34] Lord whose daughters you
[18:38] are as long as you do
[18:41] well and are not afraid with any
[18:47] amazement he says do the same thing sah
[18:51] said will my Lord
[18:55] Abraham she respected her husband
[18:59] and this should be the same thing is the
[19:01] wives
[19:03] respecting being in subjection to their
[19:06] own
[19:08] husband let us go to Colossians chter
[19:15] 3 Colossians chapter
[19:27] 3
[19:29] and then Verse
[19:32] 18 He says wies submit yourselves un
[19:36] your own husbands as it is fit in the
[19:43] Lord praise the name of our Lord he says
[19:46] it is
[19:48] fit when God in Genesis chapter
[19:54] 3 and then verse
[19:57] 16 when the sin had been
[20:02] committed God told the
[20:05] woman to the woman he said I will
[20:09] multiply thy
[20:11] sorrow and thy
[20:14] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[20:17] forth children and thy desire shall be
[20:19] to thy husband and he shall
[20:27] ru
[20:36] the husband will rule over the
[20:39] wife and that's why he says wife subject
[20:43] yourselves to your
[20:46] own it's for your
[20:49] protection when Eve was not under the
[20:52] leadership of
[20:54] Adam then the serpent came
[20:56] forth and God has by Nature
[21:01] created that a wife has to be
[21:05] submissive even her
[21:07] heart goes after her
[21:10] husband now if you despise your
[21:14] husband it is most
[21:17] likely that another man will take the
[21:19] place of your
[21:23] husband praise the name of if you put
[21:27] your husband down
[21:29] not that there is another
[21:32] Spirit which will lead you to another
[21:35] man you will regard better than your
[21:39] husband and that's fall that brings the
[21:43] fall and then you'll see that there is a
[21:45] lot of Havoc at
[21:49] home praise the name of our and so now
[21:52] when we go back to Colossians chter
[21:55] 3 and then verse 19
[21:59] he says
[22:00] husbands love your
[22:03] wives be not bitter
[22:07] against so as a husband you must love
[22:11] your
[22:12] wife and the Bible say don't be
[22:17] bitter regardless of what she has
[22:20] done don't be
[22:22] bitter the Bible says
[22:25] love covers a multitude
[22:30] of so if there is something she has
[22:35] done the scripture expects
[22:39] you to forgive
[22:41] her the scripture expects
[22:44] you to love her praise the name of our
[22:49] Lord you know there's another scripture
[22:52] here I didn't write it
[22:55] down but there's a scripture
[22:58] which says that love covers a multitude
[23:01] of
[23:04] sins but in that same
[23:07] verse he says he that repeat an
[23:13] issue he that repe an
[23:16] issue separate very
[23:23] friends praise the name of our
[23:26] Lord Proverbs 7
[23:31] 9 Proverbs
[23:37] 179 it
[23:43] says he that cover a transgression
[23:47] seeketh
[23:52] love so your wife has done something
[23:56] wrong
[23:58] she has
[24:00] transgressed the Bible says don't be
[24:07] bitter praise the name of our Lord and
[24:10] then the Bible again continues to
[24:13] say but he that repeat a
[24:18] matter separate very
[24:25] friends what is repeating
[24:29] your wife has made a
[24:30] mistake and all the time you reminding
[24:33] about that
[24:34] mistake that's why you don't know how to
[24:37] wash that's why you don't know how to
[24:39] cook that's why you don't know how to do
[24:41] this that's why you don't know how to
[24:45] this very
[24:47] terrible praise the name of the Lord or
[24:50] your
[24:51] husband that's why you don't know to
[24:54] dress that's why your styles are not
[24:56] good
[25:01] the
[25:04] time do that same
[25:08] thing praise the name of our Lord and
[25:11] you not able to bear with one
[25:13] another so you are pushing his heart
[25:17] away and now when you push his heart
[25:20] away not that the conduct may also
[25:23] change with
[25:26] time when the conduct changes you may
[25:30] realize when he has gone too
[25:32] far and then you start wondering why
[25:36] doesn't he tell me this why doesn't he
[25:38] tell me this he used to tell me this he
[25:41] used to tell me this praise the name of
[25:43] our Lord so the Bible says love your
[25:48] wife don't be
[25:50] bitter regardless of the mistake she
[25:55] has praise the name of our Lord
[25:58] and in any case however mistake she has
[26:01] made she still remains your
[26:05] wife praise the name of our Lord learn
[26:08] how to bear with
[26:10] her learn how to live with
[26:13] her praise the name of our Lord let us
[26:16] go back to First Peter chapter
[26:24] 3 and then verse S
[26:28] likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[26:31] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[26:33] the wife as unto a wicker vessel and as
[26:37] being hairs together of the grace of
[26:39] life that your prayers be not
[26:56] hindered praise the name of our so he
[26:58] says dwell with
[27:01] them according to
[27:03] knowledge giving
[27:07] H unto the wife as a weaker
[27:12] vessel and being ha together of the
[27:15] grace of
[27:17] life that your prayers be not
[27:21] hindered so take bitterness out of your
[27:25] marriage take despising one out of your
[27:29] marriage and learn to desire each
[27:32] other praise the name of the Lord God
[27:35] wants to continually see that
[27:38] unit you know husband and wife as
[27:42] one the wife is not the other side the
[27:45] husband is not the other side but you
[27:48] are moving together praise the name of
[27:51] our Lord with that love for one
[27:53] another that confidence you have for one
[27:56] another praise the name of our Lord then
[27:59] verse eight finally be all of One
[28:05] mind having compassion one of
[28:09] another love as
[28:12] Brethren be
[28:14] pitiful be
[28:17] cous praise the name of the Lord husband
[28:20] and wife says be of one
[28:24] mind don't be
[28:26] contrary have
[28:30] compassion why do you need
[28:33] compassion because there are some things
[28:35] which are not right that you're
[28:37] doing there are some things that are not
[28:39] good that you
[28:40] doing now that's when you need
[28:43] compassion that's when you need to be
[28:47] helped that's when you need a
[28:51] companion somebody you can share with
[28:54] your
[28:56] weaknesses
[28:59] somebody you can share with your
[29:01] achievement praise the name of the Lord
[29:04] and then you can move together you can
[29:07] live together you can age
[29:10] together so you don't look at her
[29:13] weakness you don't look at the weakness
[29:15] or the failures of the
[29:18] wife and even the wife you not look at
[29:21] the weakness or the failures of the
[29:23] husband you can't live together by
[29:27] looking at each other's

[44:10] the love of God Lear to bear with one
[44:13] another learn to be kind to one another
[44:16] learn to pray with one another and learn
[44:18] to stand with one

[44:46] another person is feeling another person
[44:49] is
[44:50] concerned praise the name of our Lord
[44:53] like listening to one
[44:54] another
[44:56] you know these days we have a problem
[44:58] with
[44:59] phones maybe you are
[45:01] reading and then starts talking how
[45:04] there some you want to
[45:09] complete then but you have not had me
[45:12] then you start trouble starts from
[45:15] there but even listening is not only
[45:18] putting your ears
[45:20] there but there are those who want you
[45:23] to finish then they speak back but they
[45:26] have not had they have not they have not
[45:28] taken what you are talking
[45:30] about arguing this understand the other
[45:34] understand this one the other understand
[45:37] what a
[45:39] home praise the name of the Lord but
[45:42] should not be like that in our
[45:44] homes we need to handle with one another
[45:47] respect be concerned about the others
[45:51] feelings praise the name of our Lord
[45:54] respecting each other's IDE
[45:57] and then you see how can we move forward
[46:00] from here praise the name of so we need
[46:04] to see that our homes are
[46:07] stable we need to see that the presence
[46:10] of God always in our home and we see
[46:14] that Satan does not come in any way to
[46:17] separate
[46:18] us as husband and wife or to separate us
[46:23] from raising children in the right way
[46:26] because as a husband and wife you may be
[46:28] well doing
[46:29] well but how about your children how are
[46:33] you relating with your children how are
[46:35] you raising your
[46:36] children praise the name of our Lord God
[46:39] is concerned in all these
[46:41] things so in every challenge we face at
[46:44] home learn to call upon the name of the
[46:48] Lord the Lord come down in this station
[46:52] if your husband doesn't understand you
[46:54] pray for him bear with him if your wife
[46:57] doesn't understand you pray for her bear
[47:00] with her and continue with that kind of
[47:04] love and desire for one another praise
[47:07] the name of our as you live together you
[47:10] are happy to be moving together you know
[47:14] you are not seeking how you can be away
[47:16] from
[47:16] him or how you can be away from your
[47:19] wife but the time you spend together in
[47:24] Fellowship praise the
[47:26] like I was reading about
[47:28] Isaac when Abraham saw that his wife had
[47:33] died then Abraham made sure that he gets
[47:37] a wife for
[47:39] Isaac and then the Bible says when Isaac
[47:43] married
[47:45] Rebecca praise the name of our Lord when
[47:48] Isaac married
[47:49] Rebecca I think let us finish with that
[47:53] scripture Genesis chapter 24
[48:00] Genesis
[48:04] 24 and then we read
[48:11] in verse
[48:16] 67 Genesis 67 and Isaac brought her into
[48:21] his mother his mother Sarah's tent and
[48:24] took Rebecca and she became his wife and
[48:27] he loved her and Isaac was comforted
[48:30] after his mother's
[48:33] death
[48:48] 67a the name so Rebecca brought such
[48:54] comfort she brought such a joy to
[48:58] Isaac and this is what should be in our
[49:01] homes your wife is such a comfort to
[49:06] you she's such a
[49:09] joy she is such a
[49:12] blessing even the same thing as a wife
[49:15] your husband is such so precious to you
[49:19] and this is what our families should
[49:21] have praise the name of our not again a
[49:25] terrible
[49:26] place again a place you avoid coming to
[49:30] or coming to interact with your wife or
[49:33] coming to interact with your husband but
[49:35] you desire one another you love to spend
[49:38] time
[49:39] together praise the name you love to
[49:42] hear one
[49:44] another what is she saying what is your
[49:47] concern like
[49:50] kingas he desired to hear what Esther
[49:52] was
[49:53] saying Queen Esther
[49:56] what is your
[49:57] desire what is your petition oh I want
[50:00] you to come to the
[50:02] banquet and now you can imagine how
[50:04] short notice it
[50:07] was but the king had to put other
[50:09] official
[50:11] duties the king had to put other delates
[50:14] conferences and everything
[50:16] aside and say I'm going to spend time
[50:19] with the queen I'm going to spend time
[50:22] with the queen so it should be such a
[50:24] precious time
[50:26] we spend together as husband and
[50:29] wife praise the name of our Lord time to
[50:32] commune time to
[50:34] Fellowship sitting together and then
[50:38] feeding praise the name of our sharing
[50:41] conversing should be such a good time
[50:44] you know the Bible
[50:46] says in Mar chapter 2 God said I was a
[50:52] witness when was a witness when you are
[50:55] trying to get at that time when you were
[50:59] mared praise the name of our Lord you
[51:01] know like when when you are you are
[51:03] trying to
[51:06] C you feel the time you have been

[51:30] will say you don't want to hear but if
[51:32] he says Ah it's
[51:35] exciting or if she says it it's exciting
[51:39] how about
[51:40] now that's what the Lord says I was a
[51:45] witness and God desires the same kind of
[51:48] feeling you
[51:50] had to continue with the same kind of
[51:52] feeling towards your husband towards
[51:55] your wife praise the name of our Lord
