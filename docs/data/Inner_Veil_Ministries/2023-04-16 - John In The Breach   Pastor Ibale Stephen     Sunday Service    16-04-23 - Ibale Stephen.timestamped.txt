[9:29] Fool's Day yes
[9:34] what is not as full as the sounds

[10:50] because he went to small schools
[10:54] some of the people would say oh I went
[10:57] to Main Street primaries
[11:00] but that's where he went too so brother
[11:03] Moses in a few times a few minutes
[11:07] is not used to standing before church
[11:12] he's only standing before medical
[11:14] schools when his teachings

[14:10] but he was
[14:14] praise with God Israel
[14:17] so as we come to service today
[14:21] you just put on your fighting spirit
[14:27] amen that when the angel passes your way
[14:32] don't let him go all day Matthew blesses
[14:38] that in this service
[14:40] you will surely take something back
[15:04] looking back on his life
[15:15] is wrong
[15:32] us
[15:39] he said thy brother came
[15:46] with it
[15:59] and he's bought the right to
[16:05] do
[16:07] he fled to her eyes
[16:14] and dwell there with lovers
[16:21] daughter
[16:30] [Music]
[16:36] the Stars
[16:48] he grew greater in glory
[16:55] lost favor with lovers
[17:08] and said to Jacob go home
[17:23] afraid
[17:34] [Music]
[17:37] foreign
[17:47] [Music]
[18:11] desperation
[18:25] when that angel came down
[18:44] I can bear to live anymore
[18:54] I will not leave
[19:00] until
[19:02] I am
[19:04] [Music]
[19:19] [Music]
[19:21] he said I wanna let you go
[19:27] [Music]
[19:44] [Music]
[19:51] it's all
[19:56] oh my God
[19:58] [Music]
[20:05] [Music]
[20:19] [Music]
[20:28] [Music]
[20:36] foreign
[20:39] [Music]
[20:49] [Music]
[21:05] [Music]
[21:13] [Music]
[21:16] but on my own I keep on failing
[21:25] so long I'm down on my
[21:31] mind
[21:41] [Music]
[21:48] I'm saying
[21:50] [Music]
[22:13] [Music]
[22:21] [Music]
[22:28] see like
[22:30] [Music]
[22:49] [Music]
[23:04] foreign
[23:33] in the time of life
[23:35] if you realize that this is your day
[23:40] amen Amina this is your time of life
[23:44] you won't let that angel go off
[23:48] you need to hold him in this service
[23:51] until he gives you a new name
[23:56] amen I mean
[24:11] why do you die
[24:17] foreign
[24:37] [Music]
[25:08] shall beware
[25:29] perhaps
[25:31] I have four
[25:36] under the Disco
[26:10] [Music]
[26:19] and it shall be well
[26:31] [Music]
[26:44] foreign
[27:31] [Music]
[27:55] foreign
[28:00] [Music]
[28:08] [Music]
[28:27] to bring forth the life
[28:31] but in the time of life
[28:38] this could be your day
[28:41] let's stand up and get into the
[28:44] scripture reading
[28:46] Revelation chapter four
[28:51] father
[28:53] we thank you for this opportunity again
[28:57] these are rare moments
[29:00] when your children come together
[29:03] to have Fellowship in the world
[29:06] and in times like this
[29:09] father you give a promise that we are
[29:13] two or three are gathered together
[29:16] you'll be there
[29:18] and to begin with Father we remember
[29:22] that you gave us an open door
[29:25] the door of the blood of Jesus Christ
[29:32] of that blood we come before the masses
[29:37] to find mass in the time
[29:41] this is your children father have got so
[29:45] many different desires
[29:50] I pray that you grant them they deserve
[29:53] foreign
[30:11] he says after this I looked
[30:17] you know when we say after this
[30:25] you know the church went through Seven
[30:28] Ages
[30:36] Christ was put out of his church
[30:39] and he says behold I stand at the door
[30:44] so when they failed to happen
[30:46] then another Story begins
[30:53] and behold the door was open in heaven
[30:57] and the first voice which I heard was as
[31:00] it were over trumpet talking with me
[31:09] and I'll show you things which must be
[31:13] he arrested
[31:16] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[31:20] behold a throne was open in heaven and
[31:23] one sat on the throne
[31:32] amen may God bless you
[31:38] so I have got a title this morning
[31:44] I'm speaking on John
[31:47] in the bridge
[31:51] John in the bridge
[31:55] now Revelation
[31:58] is the revelation of Christ
[32:02] the foundation upon which the church
[32:06] would grow from Ephesus to the Capstone
[32:09] himself
[32:15] now Revelation
[32:19] the scripture says the revelation of
[32:23] Jesus Christ
[32:24] which God gave Anton John
[32:29] to show unto himself
[32:32] things which must certainly come to pass
[32:37] and signified it by his Angel to his
[32:42] servant John yeah
[32:47] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[32:51] which God gave unto his servants
[32:56] so prophecy spoke of Christ in numerous
[33:01] way
[33:03] some directly
[33:05] like in Isaiah 7 14.
[33:10] [Music]
[33:13] directly
[33:15] as it was depicted in the shadows
[33:21] so the history also
[33:24] speaks of the Christ of Nazareth
[33:28] amen Amina you know prophecy spoke
[33:32] towards him
[33:34] but when he came
[33:38] observed his presence
[33:42] and they wrote about the reality of his
[33:46] presence Here and Now
[33:49] so we would rather say that history
[33:53] speaks of the Christ of Nazareth
[33:58] please and it's a poem that reality
[34:03] amen amen you know about the Christ of
[34:07] Nazareth who was born of a virgin
[34:11] died at the cross
[34:13] raised again on the third day
[34:16] that the Christian organizations
[34:20] are founded on that is
[34:24] it they found themselves on that history
[34:29] just like they always say let us recite
[34:33] the Apostles Creed
[34:36] they are reciting the history
[34:39] that Jesus came on us yes so Christian
[34:43] religions
[34:47] the reality of history
[34:52] is founded on the revelation
[34:55] of that Christ in the present time
[34:59] Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus
[35:02] Christ
[35:08] but the religious Christian denomination
[35:14] they are just founded on the Real
[35:16] History of Once Upon a Time
[35:24] is not an historical God
[35:28] we serve a present tense
[35:31] the one that raised from the dead and
[35:35] has proven to be the god
[35:40] the God that was the neighborhood
[35:45] and the apostles foreign
[36:05] [Music]
[36:45] [Music]
[36:47] you do not go into the history books
[36:54] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ reveal the
[36:57] personally to you
[36:58] the door of faith that God gives you
[37:03] is the personal revelation of Christ to
[37:07] you
[37:09] now let's go to Matthew chapter 16.
[37:13] amen amen
[37:17] it completely disturbs the religious
[37:20] world of that day
[37:23] I was a man speaking spiritual things
[37:31] and yet it was so simple to understand
[37:35] until the scripture says that common man
[37:38] had him glad
[37:43] so you know he was so special
[37:47] foreign
[38:31] foreign
[38:42] [Music]
[38:59] [Music]
[39:13] foreign
[39:34] [Music]
[40:13] [Music]
[40:17] who
[40:45] [Music]
[41:25] [Music]
[42:16] foreign now since we've always known
[42:20] that you need to attract what we did but
[42:21] a name speaks of course
[42:23] the moment you get the white stone
[42:27] which is revelation
[42:37] if you've got a possible Revelation
[42:40] direct from above
[42:44] today
[42:54] [Music]
[43:02] is you sharing in the characters
[43:24] [Music]
[43:38] the kingdom of God is in here
[43:45] so that Revelation
[43:48] it holds the power of transformation
[43:52] once you get the Revelation
[43:56] to you your father has nothing to do
[43:59] with it
[44:01] your friend has nothing to do with it
[44:04] it is
[44:06] really like we saw on Easter Sunday
[44:17] [Music]
[44:31] upon which the ministry is founded
[44:38] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:42] which God gave unto God
[44:45] [Music]
[44:47] so the ministry of John
[44:50] to the servants that's the revelation of
[44:54] God
[44:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen
[45:00] so my Ministry
[45:02] is not how long your dress should have
[45:05] been great it's not how long your hair
[45:08] should be good every day my Ministry is
[45:12] the revelation of Christ
[45:16] and once you get it
[45:18] just voluntarily
[45:24] you'll get your dress longer
[45:27] you get your hair growing
[45:30] amen I mean you are not depending on my
[45:33] dues
[45:35] but the revelation of Christ
[46:01] [Music]
[46:37] foreign
[46:51] in your place
[46:55] amen amen so God gives the Revelation to
[46:58] George
[47:04] the revelations
[47:08] is not the simple knowledge
[47:12] of Jesus being God
[47:15] because West explained very well
[47:22] that oh yes there is one God but the
[47:27] Revelation that John receives
[47:29] is greater than the understanding of the
[47:32] godhead
[47:34] because this Revelation
[47:37] confused with God
[47:40] revealing his personality
[47:43] together with his wife
[47:46] in the seven churches
[47:49] it goes further than God here
[47:53] [Music]
[47:55] foreign
[48:19] [Music]
[48:24] okay I'm in a
[48:26] so Revelation 1 4.
[48:30] to the seven churches which are in Asia
[48:34] main area mechanisms
[48:37] amen amen does not mean they were the
[48:41] only churches in Israel but
[48:46] John I mean to the 70 churches
[48:54] to represent the Journey of Christ
[48:58] through the Southern church
[49:03] they are the churches
[49:06] that God is addressing himself too
[49:11] amen amen they are some others but I'm
[49:15] choosing this to represent the training
[49:18] characteristics of the Church
[49:23] of Christ in the church from Pentacles
[49:31] [Music]
[49:33] John to the seven churches
[49:39] and peace from him
[49:46] Hallelujah
[49:58] hear the scripture says
[50:00] and the seven spirits
[50:03] which are before it's wrong
[50:07] now the question is does God have seven
[50:11] spirits
[50:14] John 4 24 says
[50:17] God is a spirit
[50:23] foreign
[50:32] [Music]
[50:45] praise the Lord but when he says to the
[50:49] seven spirits
[50:51] listen now you need to get to the
[50:54] foundation
[50:56] there were so many churches which way is
[51:01] and when John was on the island
[51:04] he didn't go there for a mission
[51:07] he has been thrown away
[51:10] from the community
[51:12] because it was transforming the lives of
[51:16] the People by the preaching of the Gods
[51:19] and the Roman Empire
[51:25] so they threw him on the island
[51:29] which was old and now that Island
[51:34] had so many reputations
[51:37] that was so poisonous
[51:42] to get rid of this man Amina
[51:56] [Music]
[52:01] actually they are helping you to get
[52:05] away from their society
[52:19] that happened to me
[52:23] amen when my family stay away from me it
[52:28] pushed me to his hands
[52:30] are you together
[52:32] is John the Apostle somewhere
[52:36] amen amen
[52:39] always give thanks
[52:44] foreign
[52:51] [Music]
[53:15] when this entire civilization is passed
[53:20] away then what comes next is
[53:39] [Music]
[53:45] so now when is really presenting this
[53:49] seventh I mean fourth verse here
[53:53] he says to the seven churches
[53:56] and these seven churches
[53:58] they represented
[54:01] the changing characteristics
[54:13] and again the character of the church
[54:15] [Music]
[54:21] the training characteristics
[54:30] whom we are calling a message
[54:35] at the changing of the characteristic
[54:38] foreign
[55:19] [Music]
[55:26] foreign
[56:03] amen amen to lift us again to another
[56:07] level as we go through the bridge
[56:11] and the seventh seals
[56:13] [Music]
[56:16] so now seven spirits
[56:20] oh each time the church was changing
[56:25] the holy spirit
[56:29] with a different way of the same holy
[56:32] spirit
[56:34] amen and they were to go and speak to
[56:37] the church
[56:46] Hallelujah in the power of the spirit
[56:49] again they would work again
[57:12] [Music]
[57:25] this is what they are calling seven
[57:28] spirits of God
[57:33] but yet one Spirit
[57:35] but manifesting in different ways
[57:41] he's addressing himself to the churches
[57:46] who was addressing the church
[57:48] [Music]
[58:08] that can be lifted from history
[58:12] can be pointed out in the presence
[58:16] with his Supernatural presence
[58:19] and it can still be pointed out by
[58:22] prophecy into the future
[58:26] now that is the serving revelation of
[58:30] Christ
[59:01] [Music]
[59:19] [Music]
[59:23] Christ must be revealed to you
[59:25] personally
[59:27] on the same principle he revealed
[59:31] himself in the seven churches
[59:39] you must build
[59:42] foreign
[59:50] you know as you walk double Tumblr like
[59:54] you are fainting
[59:56] the Holy Spirit comes again
[59:59] with a refreshing in your life
[1:00:02] and you work again
[1:00:18] there is
[1:00:27] [Music]

[1:04:36] when that life is not there you will
[1:04:39] always be looking for a way he's staying
[1:04:43] farther away from the church
[1:04:44] and let me tell you when these Spirits
[1:04:48] possess a person
[1:04:50] amen it keeps him in church
[1:04:53] but make sure that that person is not
[1:04:58] together with the church

[1:08:39] they want to put on men's trousers
[1:08:54] but like in the United States
[1:09:03] foreign
[1:09:32] foreign
[1:09:36] are you together running but today
[1:09:41] they don't attribute the genders to the
[1:09:45] success
[1:09:51] so somebody was being asked
[1:09:54] so what is the woman
[1:09:59] and he says you know
[1:10:03] a woman is a agenda feeling
[1:10:14] it's a gender thing one who has to be
[1:10:17] loved one has to be this one so I I
[1:10:21] chose to be a woman
[1:10:32] to teach what I'm teaching
[1:10:35] to help you stand in the position
[1:10:41] because everything that happens out
[1:10:45] there in the world
[1:10:47] it has got its spiritual bearing here in
[1:10:50] the church
[1:10:55] now you're together with the new uneasy
[1:10:57] you look where the good is that you look
[1:10:59] out
[1:11:00] whatever you ever you see there it has
[1:11:03] got a spiritual bearing
[1:11:06] which will reflect itself
[1:11:11] let's look at this Fallen Edge
[1:11:15] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14.
[1:11:19] and to the end of the church
[1:11:26] these things says
[1:11:30] which means we've come to the end of
[1:11:33] time
[1:11:34] because you don't say men in the middle
[1:11:37] of the prayer
[1:11:39] amen comes at the end I mean so Jesus is
[1:11:45] the amenhage
[1:11:49] are you together with me run easy this
[1:11:52] thing says amen
[1:11:55] the faithful and true
[1:12:02] Witnesses
[1:12:14] but it's the reality
[1:12:17] that comes out of the Shadow
[1:12:20] because when Jesus came yesterday John
[1:12:25] called him the love of God
[1:12:28] that takes away the sin of the world
[1:12:31] so when Jesus came from
[1:12:34] he was not the plan
[1:12:38] so the person of Jesus
[1:12:44] as opposed to the lamb in the shadow
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:15] because we are traveling
[1:13:47] the beginning
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:32] oh yeah
[1:14:35] somebody says brother Stephen
[1:14:38] how does God perish
[1:14:40] by depreciating
[1:14:46] are you together with me by depressing
[1:14:49] value
[1:14:51] the other day in the states I was in a
[1:14:54] house
[1:14:55] it was built in 1860.
[1:15:04] you get into that house
[1:15:07] it's better than any other house I've
[1:15:10] been to in this country yes
[1:15:14] when they put they reserved all the
[1:15:16] Furnitures of the house
[1:15:24] the furniture everybody the birds
[1:15:29] you couldn't believe
[1:15:32] and that man died in the 80s
[1:15:37] it was George Van built something like
[1:15:40] that yeah you can't even believe
[1:15:43] so
[1:15:44] when I got in there
[1:15:47] of course they tell you the history
[1:15:50] this is where he used to welcome Royals
[1:15:53] 150 rooms in the house
[1:15:58] and I walked and I said brother I'm
[1:16:01] tired I can't go home
[1:16:05] you go up and then down all this kind of
[1:16:09] things
[1:16:09] this man dies he had a capital value of
[1:16:15] 200 million dollars
[1:16:20] foreign
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:48] perish
[1:16:50] you might depreciating
[1:16:55] oh the man is now losing value
[1:16:58] that's the wealth
[1:17:00] but this church Edge is
[1:17:04] um
[1:17:08] and they say I am rich
[1:17:14] they are not preaching the god of
[1:17:16] characters
[1:17:21] the goal of characters
[1:17:25] that's where you need to be rich
[1:17:28] in the character of God
[1:17:33] but this one's here
[1:17:36] they are rich in the correct of this
[1:17:39] world
[1:17:41] which passes away
[1:17:46] foreign
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:18:08] the code that perishes
[1:18:11] that's the standard of where the end
[1:18:14] time church is now normal to awakens
[1:18:16] services
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:02] that actually encompasses this Edge
[1:19:07] amen I mean because they do not want
[1:19:11] even to open for Christ
[1:19:12] without Christians you know they put him
[1:19:15] out of his church
[1:19:17] in verse 20. he says it's not me anymore
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:26] it is uh you know motivation
[1:19:29] to to motivate people
[1:19:34] that's what the gospel is
[1:19:48] so the seventh Church
[1:19:51] which is supposed to be the going away
[1:19:54] of the church
[1:19:56] the church
[1:19:59] on the nature and the character of
[1:20:02] worship
[1:20:05] amen the queen whom the king calls and
[1:20:11] she refused to come yeah

[1:26:24] the body of Christ

[1:29:40] while you were originally
[1:29:42] come up
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:49] from the door
[1:29:53] and that's why brother Branham
[1:29:56] speaks about the seventh Seal saying
[1:30:00] it ends up the ushering in of the
[1:30:05] Millennium
[1:30:08] which means that after the Pentecostal
[1:30:12] Church
[1:30:14] the nomination of groups
[1:30:22] which is the work of the Asha
[1:30:27] are you together
[1:30:29] this is what we call the bridge
[1:30:32] between the seven churches
[1:30:42] you know
[1:30:46] today John is in the bridge
[1:30:48] amen praise God so this seventh seals
[1:30:53] which is the complete revelation of
[1:30:56] Christ
[1:30:58] amen he's coming and this is
[1:31:04] not an instant happening
[1:31:09] boom boom seven series
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:13] foreign
[1:32:02] that's where we operate with the message
[1:32:04] of the hour
[1:32:08] and John says
[1:32:10] immediately I was in the spirit
[1:32:15] he began to see things
[1:32:18] which were going to be here
[1:32:21] I said I got in the spirits
[1:32:28] that's the first thing
[1:32:30] he was in the spirit
[1:32:35] is not John's body change
[1:32:43] foreign
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:11] hey
[1:33:14] hallelujah hallelujah now the
[1:33:17] denominations have closed
[1:33:20] they don't need Christ anymore
[1:33:30] are you together with me
[1:33:34] and this Christ is going to work with
[1:33:37] you anyway it is
[1:33:53] foreign
[1:34:42] foreign
[1:35:13] foreign
[1:35:56] you know
[1:36:00] he started
[1:36:08] and they did not see the body of Flesh
[1:36:12] they saw him in this glorified State
[1:36:20] he was right there in the manifestation
[1:36:23] of the power of translation I'll go to
[1:36:27] siwa
[1:36:29] so they fell down to the feet
[1:36:34] and then all of a sudden
[1:36:38] three hearts here one obviously
[1:36:43] one foreign
[1:36:58] are you together with it
[1:37:00] and the vision went of course
[1:37:03] the same state
[1:37:06] John was in
[1:37:09] to see this is the same
[1:37:13] steps
[1:37:16] when he saw in Revelation
[1:37:20] he says I was in the spirit
[1:37:23] I did not have a body of change or body
[1:37:27] change
[1:37:28] so the state of Jones
[1:37:31] was that was in an amount of
[1:37:34] classification
[1:37:36] is the same body he has in Revelation 4.
[1:37:42] it's the same steps
[1:37:44] of being Moses to us
[1:37:48] on Mount Sinai when God was vindicating
[1:37:52] him before the peace
[1:37:54] it's the same state
[1:38:10] is not the rapture
[1:38:16] are you together with me what is it
[1:38:19] joining the bridge
[1:38:20] is not representing a church that has
[1:38:24] been glorified
[1:38:27] church that has been called out of the
[1:38:31] Fallen organization
[1:38:34] to be brought
[1:38:36] into special places
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:11] we are not in the organization we are
[1:39:14] not in the body change
[1:39:16] in the bridge Hallelujah
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:32] amen amen there is that spot which has
[1:39:36] been provided wow amen amen so in this
[1:39:39] language
[1:39:41] let's call it you know like people some
[1:39:45] of you travel government
[1:39:47] you have been on those planes
[1:39:50] amen you get to the airport
[1:39:53] and then you present your token
[1:39:58] from the very people who check you out
[1:40:01] to the place
[1:40:02] and they say there's nothing that stops
[1:40:05] you from traveling
[1:40:07] then you go down here in migration
[1:40:11] they look at it and they said yes you
[1:40:15] qualified
[1:40:22] amen you are not on the plane and you
[1:40:26] are not in the outside world
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:40] um
[1:40:55] we are
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:04] here we are in the bridge
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:23] foreign
[1:41:36] amen I mean what would you Hereafter
[1:41:39] mean
[1:41:42] he wants to show you the time that all
[1:41:45] things which are going to take place
[1:41:49] that is going to take place in this
[1:41:51] waiting time
[1:41:54] in this bridge
[1:41:57] alone
[1:41:59] he shows him the Rapture what it's going
[1:42:03] to be
[1:42:04] he shows him the three and a half years
[1:42:13] he shows him the final war after the
[1:42:16] Millennium
[1:42:20] he shows him the judgments
[1:42:24] he shows him the lack of fire
[1:42:26] he shows him the New Jerusalem so now he
[1:42:31] puts him there so that he can speak to
[1:42:34] him
[1:42:36] foreign
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:42] there is something
[1:43:50] foreign
[1:44:19] are you together with Brothers yes we
[1:44:22] are put here today everyone to be told
[1:44:24] about the future
[1:44:26] I'll show you things that will be here
[1:44:30] so this bridge here is the gap that
[1:44:34] exists between the churches
[1:44:42] and most important
[1:44:44] is the revelation of finished work
[1:44:48] in this bridge
[1:44:52] foreign
[1:45:13] a practical revelation of redemption
[1:45:17] Redeeming the names that are in the book
[1:45:21] amen amen so this tax John
[1:45:25] beyond the physical experience
[1:45:31] for three and a half years
[1:45:34] it's more than that he's knowing him now
[1:45:38] at a greater level
[1:45:41] the same time
[1:46:24] from his own history
[1:46:30] we need to separate this Christ Church
[1:46:38] amen amen he is the person yellow amount
[1:46:42] to
[1:46:44] of the Lord himself
[1:46:53] [Music]
[1:46:57] a divine presence
[1:47:02] so when this door closes
[1:47:12] he has to be yesterday
[1:47:17] the Lord himself
[1:47:24] are you together
[1:47:28] shall descend
[1:47:31] Hallelujah in his Spirit to form
[1:47:35] before he puts in his Spirit forms
[1:47:38] before he puts on his body he first
[1:47:42] brings the presence
[1:47:44] to be the Asha okay to be the messenger
[1:47:49] to this Friday
[1:47:54] amen Amina let's go for Thessalonians
[1:47:57] chapter 4.
[1:47:59] remember there is a time we are going to
[1:48:02] wrestle with the angels
[1:48:04] amen amen reserve your strengths
[1:48:07] he says here in first Thessalonians 4
[1:48:11] 16.
[1:48:13] the Lord himself
[1:48:18] is that Elohim
[1:48:21] that existed before the Jesus body
[1:48:26] as sacrifice so the Lord himself
[1:48:33] in his Spirit
[1:48:35] shall descend from heaven with the shot
[1:48:40] with the voice of the archangels
[1:48:43] and with the Trump of God
[1:48:48] foreign
[1:48:52] are you together with me
[1:48:54] so this coming
[1:48:57] he comes as an anointed spirit
[1:49:06] he hasn't brought his body yet
[1:49:10] but he has come to guide his church
[1:49:15] in the same way
[1:49:19] that The Messengers
[1:49:21] kept guiding their Church ages
[1:49:27] the Lord himself
[1:49:30] the Saints
[1:49:39] but when he does
[1:49:44] he takes the body of malachite
[1:49:50] a prophetic Ministry of where it is
[1:50:04] it yes sir those denominations
[1:50:08] they always elect both of their prophets
[1:50:12] whose best prophecies
[1:50:18] you'll eat a potato tomorrow
[1:50:21] nothing spirited
[1:50:26] but we've got a word Prophet all right
[1:50:28] we shouldn't be proud about that you
[1:50:32] can't really give the Lord the hand of
[1:50:34] prayers
[1:50:38] amen where would we be foreign
[1:51:00] foreign
[1:52:07] they build it
[1:52:33] even Vice equally
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:46] amen Ami as it was in the days
[1:52:51] there has to be a return
[1:52:55] of the son of man
[1:52:58] before the son of David
[1:53:01] which is Christ the King
[1:53:04] Texas Road amen
[1:53:08] they are hard to come again
[1:53:11] a son of man Ministry
[1:53:15] which is a prophetic Ministry
[1:53:19] to be revealed among us
[1:53:26] and that's what happens
[1:53:28] in the bridge message
[1:53:31] when the Lord himself comes as an
[1:53:35] anointing
[1:53:36] upon a prophet to teach his brother
[1:53:41] foreign
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:31] [Music]
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:41] foreign
[1:54:54] something called you out of the
[1:54:56] denomination
[1:55:00] he says
[1:55:03] that these seven sealed book now
[1:55:06] is the mystery of redemption
[1:55:10] it's a book of redemption from God
[1:55:17] but this time should be finished
[1:55:20] at the sounding of this messenger
[1:55:25] so the revelation of the sacraments
[1:55:30] alive
[1:55:31] that will refer to me
[1:55:37] rapturing Faith
[1:55:40] but in Revelation
[1:55:42] is referred to as the voice
[1:55:46] it's a life you become a speaking word
[1:55:52] um
[1:55:53] you are the voice of God
[1:55:56] in this day are you together
[1:56:03] you suck in the word
[1:56:05] and even before you speak
[1:56:08] you become a voice
[1:56:13] they look at what you do where you go
[1:56:17] yeah how you dress you become a voice
[1:56:22] you have the voice of Christ on the
[1:56:24] earthquake
[1:56:26] amen I mean yeah it's not the voice is
[1:56:29] the Life of Christ
[1:56:32] sitting in the brain as the rupturing
[1:56:35] phase
[1:56:37] and this place becomes surreal
[1:56:41] until God decided fried with it
[1:56:46] and comes into fellowship with that
[1:56:49] Faith
[1:56:50] are you together with me you get a

[2:01:47] that's what is happening in the bridge
[2:01:50] it has nothing to do with the Pentacles
[2:01:53] it has nothing to do with those
[2:01:55] organizations

[2:05:07] the only person that could redeem me
[2:05:13] his own family
[2:05:18] had to be so rich
[2:05:23] to redeem the man in the captives
[2:05:26] and this man hears I don't know was
[2:05:29] referred to as the go away
[2:05:33] amen so now Revelation 5. is the
[2:05:38] revelation of the go well

[2:06:34] as fast crisis conceptually was the
[2:06:38] ability to put down his life away and
[2:06:42] take it again

[2:06:48] that when he does it she does not enjoy
[2:06:52] his economy

[2:09:16] talk about the Gap

[2:09:28] you are going to be blessed by the time
[2:09:31] we come through this series
[2:09:39] you know
[2:09:40] it's a bridge
[2:09:44] and the bridge
[2:09:48] you know if I have a hedge here
[2:10:00] anything that is a hole here
[2:10:05] that's a bridge
[2:10:11] if I speak about it from another angle
[2:10:17] from this to this we've got a bridge
[2:10:21] here we never make it to the one
[2:10:25] Okay so
[2:10:27] you know this is us
[2:10:30] and this is heaven how could you ever
[2:10:34] get there
[2:10:36] without a man
[2:10:38] coming to bridge this Gap
[2:10:43] together so in the bridge here
[2:10:47] Johnny comes from the world
[2:10:50] he can only get up here through this
[2:10:54] bridge
[2:10:55] put the bridge okay
[2:11:01] foreign
[2:11:21] look at the pressure
[2:11:23] that's in the Gap yeah
[2:11:28] there's too much pressure
[2:11:31] I'll give you examples
[2:11:37] when God blessed him in the Gap
[2:11:40] to bring the bridge that the bride over
[2:11:44] the bridge
[2:11:47] too much pressure
[2:11:52] you are going to understand
[2:11:54] because during the course
[2:12:02] amen Amina sometimes and call the people
[2:12:08] because there is
[2:12:32] generations of vipers
[2:12:35] who has want you to flee that rafters
[2:12:45] it was pressure in the Gap
[2:12:49] when Jesus called Harold the fox
[2:12:52] yesterday
[2:12:53] go and tell that fox your
[2:12:56] congratulations
[2:12:57] it was precious
[2:12:59] but then he was double nature
[2:13:03] he had the nature of mechanism
[2:13:07] Amen to go through the feelings
[2:13:11] but yet at the same time
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:16] of Christ I mean of God
[2:13:18] obviously go and tell that fox
[2:13:21] congratulations but at the end of it
[2:13:27] amen to come from that
[2:13:33] Kinsale to subject himself to doing the
[2:13:38] will of God
[2:13:44] heal the center to my will
[2:13:47] but your will be done
[2:13:52] he submitted himself
[2:14:03] amen amen it was such
[2:14:07] currency
[2:14:24] he subjected himself
[2:14:27] and he entered into Isaiah 53 yeah
[2:14:33] before you shall grow up before he must
[2:14:36] attend a plan
[2:14:39] and that's the root out of the dried
[2:14:41] ground
[2:14:43] he has no forms
[2:14:50] there's no beauty that we should desires
[2:14:54] despite them rejected of men yeah
[2:15:16] [Music]
[2:15:24] foreign
[2:15:29] [Music]
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:16] foreign
[2:16:36] and God will tell him God and he says
[2:16:40] I've not felt a Feeling
[2:16:46] this Gap here
[2:16:50] Revelation
[2:16:51] was bitter for him
[2:16:57] and John yokana
[2:16:59] need that Revelation yes
[2:17:01] of Revelation 5 work week later to be
[2:17:05] sure that is the name is
[2:17:12] trouble
[2:17:29] understanding what I teach
[2:17:32] does not save you yeah
[2:17:37] understanding the true history
[2:17:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ doesn't save
[2:17:44] you
[2:17:45] understanding the ministry of William
[2:17:47] brothers
[2:17:49] does not save you
[2:17:53] to come to Revelations
[2:18:01] Charlie
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:19:08] into contact with Heavenly reality
[2:19:15] if you have not finished reading the
[2:19:17] bridge
[2:19:19] go back because this is just an
[2:19:21] introduction
[2:19:24] he says I'm trying to finish in the next
[2:19:27] 10 15.
[2:19:29] but don't watch time amen
[2:19:35] yes sir in the bridge message he says
[2:19:39] what a jubilee
[2:19:43] going on in heaven
[2:19:47] when the love leaves
[2:19:51] that intercessory box
[2:19:55] to come here to possess his claims
[2:20:02] amen you know that God next to John
[2:20:10] he must have seen his name right there
[2:20:16] when themselves
[2:20:19] we must got real happy I know
[2:20:23] listen what he says
[2:20:29] praise God praise the Lord amen when
[2:20:33] you know he says what a jubilee going on
[2:20:37] in heaven
[2:20:40] when the lamb leaves
[2:20:45] that intercessory box
[2:20:49] to claim I mean to possess his clay okay
[2:21:00] [Music]
[2:21:02] we have value
[2:21:06] but when the lamb leaves
[2:21:20] because he was told I'll show you things
[2:21:24] that will be here
[2:21:28] so John went into Vision
[2:21:31] about how the lamb leaves his throne
[2:21:38] to possess his claims
[2:21:41] meaning that John was looking at a
[2:21:45] future
[2:21:46] events when the Redemption is done
[2:21:51] and the claiming is over
[2:21:54] and is taking his clay
[2:21:57] now Redemption has three packs
[2:22:01] there is
[2:22:06] and then there is
[2:22:09] claiming
[2:22:11] A continuing claiming
[2:22:18] which has been in FSS
[2:22:22] the ones that are his
[2:22:24] claiming them
[2:22:27] and then at the end of it there is
[2:22:34] foreign
[2:22:54] you know he says
[2:22:59] brother Branham says here
[2:23:02] what a jubilee going on in heaven
[2:23:06] when the lamb leaves
[2:23:20] he doesn't leave the intercessory
[2:23:25] until the last elected one
[2:23:28] by you is
[2:23:34] so is the lab still there
[2:23:37] your blood um
[2:23:41] amen amen we are not at that spot yet
[2:23:47] that Johnny was looking at
[2:23:50] because Christ is still reaching out for
[2:23:53] his claims of redemption
[2:23:59] the last name also has to come through
[2:24:03] the
[2:24:05] processification sanctifications
[2:24:09] [Music]
[2:24:18] [Music]
[2:24:38] [Music]
[2:24:52] and our children are still believe
[2:24:55] is having to be no
[2:24:58] are you together with me
[2:25:00] so you put the blood away from the outer
[2:25:03] colors you are keeping yourself out
[2:25:10] because you still make mistakes
[2:25:14] and you need mercy on your children too
[2:25:19] when you say oh there's no blood I'm
[2:25:23] sorry you are putting yourself out
[2:25:28] Messiah
[2:25:41] [Music]
[2:25:48] but before people
[2:25:53] maybe you know some people have preached
[2:25:57] and they said there's no more blood on
[2:26:00] the Master Seat
[2:26:04] and you know ready they will try their
[2:26:07] level best
[2:26:10] to prove that there is no blood on the
[2:26:12] Massachusetts
[2:26:15] but they still repent of sinach
[2:26:20] oh God forgiving
[2:26:24] you know according to those
[2:26:28] what we are doing
[2:26:31] from our church going out and reaching
[2:26:34] out for the lost souls
[2:26:38] baptizing hundreds and hundreds of them
[2:26:41] it contradicts their popular doctrines
[2:26:49] and yet at the same time they baptize
[2:26:52] their own children
[2:26:56] you see where I'm coming from you see
[2:26:59] once you lend yourself to a wrong
[2:27:01] Doctrine always
[2:27:03] it sticks somewhere in your subconscious
[2:27:08] but second Timothy 2 17. all right
[2:27:13] have you retained some strength
[2:27:18] because we are going to wrestle with the
[2:27:20] engine
[2:27:22] before we get out of this side how many
[2:27:25] of you want to do that but wrestle with
[2:27:28] the angels
[2:27:29] amen Amina he said you know according to
[2:27:33] this wrong Doctrine
[2:27:35] he says of whom is a menace and filaters
[2:27:42] who concerning the truth ever since
[2:27:47] that the resurrection is passed already
[2:27:55] this is the moment you keep
[2:27:57] people in the wrong doctor
[2:28:01] throws their face
[2:28:13] you are not going anywhere
[2:28:16] until the last selected one is found
[2:28:23] yeah we are just preparing for the
[2:28:25] coming of the Lord you are going nowhere
[2:28:30] because the last election by you is not
[2:28:33] here yet amen Amina you know Christ will
[2:28:38] just you know stay on that Revelation
[2:28:43] 19.
[2:28:45] the bride
[2:28:47] has made herself ready
[2:28:54] to go and look
[2:28:56] and look selected
[2:28:58] by you and go through the phases of
[2:29:01] redemption
[2:29:03] you'll keep saying we are waiting for
[2:29:05] the cards
[2:29:09] our wrong approach to the bridge
[2:29:13] will keep Christ in his long suffering
[2:29:19] because where's the last selected
[2:29:21] foreign
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:35] [Music]

[2:31:20] the first five verses
[2:31:27] Revelation 5 verse
[2:31:33] [Music]
[2:31:38] represents you and me
[2:31:40] it represents the church
[2:31:43] that has been called out of organization
[2:31:47] and is in the bridge foreign
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:36] that book was uh
[2:32:42] Scrolls
[2:32:45] so now the first crowd like this
[2:32:50] and they want to bring us
[2:32:55] the second one would be bro no work the
[2:32:59] third one would be broken
[2:33:01] [Music]
[2:33:16] okay got it so now Revelation 5 1.
[2:33:26] a book written within the back side
[2:33:31] with seven seats
[2:33:36] let it represent the seventh seeds
[2:33:40] it was sealed
[2:33:42] and he was Seated on his throne
[2:33:46] with this book
[2:33:51] The reason why you are here you are
[2:33:55] going to understand
[2:34:02] [Music]
[2:34:07] it was the names of the redeems
[2:34:10] [Music]
[2:34:34] but your soul
[2:34:39] [Applause]
[2:34:41] praise God the book contained the names
[2:34:44] of the sons and daughters
[2:34:53] these names and the Divine protection
[2:35:06] hallelujah
[2:35:16] hallelujah let me tell you
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:46] it is
[2:35:51] [Applause]
[2:36:29] [Music]
[2:36:50] of God
[2:37:09] for everyone of those Souls
[2:37:20] foreign
[2:37:25] [Music]
[2:37:55] you are predestinated
[2:38:00] amen Amina Acts chapter 1 verse 15.
[2:38:06] you know I wake up in the morning
[2:38:08] sometimes
[2:38:11] when I'm on this spot
[2:38:16] when I get back when are you I'm just as
[2:38:19] weak as anything is
[2:38:21] over amen Amina so I don't know how long
[2:38:26] but as long as I am and these young men
[2:38:30] are taking these recordings
[2:38:33] for me to put this forward
[2:38:39] amen I'm Anna
[2:38:41] it's chapter one verse 15.
[2:38:43] and in those days later stood up in the
[2:38:48] midst of the disciples
[2:38:54] the names I mean he stood up
[2:38:58] in the midst of disciples and says
[2:39:05] he was in the upper room
[2:39:07] and now the scripture says the number of
[2:39:11] names together
[2:39:14] a member of the names
[2:39:20] was 120
[2:39:26] Mary
[2:39:32] [Music]
[2:39:33] magada
[2:39:35] Maria
[2:39:37] Simon Peter Simone
[2:39:42] so what's your name already

[2:39:49] hundred twenty names
[2:39:55] is anonymous with the character of the
[2:39:58] past Arena

[2:40:06] man you had the ability to live the life
[2:40:10] of the Lambs
[2:40:13] so the name in the book of the Lamb
[2:40:17] means the soul whose character is
[2:40:20] influenced by the life of the Lamb
[2:40:23] [Music]
[2:40:26] woman so those in Revelation 5 1.
[2:40:31] amen did not have a revelation of who
[2:40:34] they weighed
[2:40:36] but yet
[2:40:38] they were sexually

[2:41:14] because the name had to be redeemed and
[2:41:19] that name had to be brought to it is
[2:41:25] you may not have a full understanding of
[2:41:28] what I am saying
[2:41:32] at the time
[2:41:34] one thing I know I think you are in the
[2:41:38] right hand
[2:41:39] of divine protection
[2:41:43] amen I mean a buster here and I saw a
[2:41:48] strong angel proclaiming I come back
[2:41:55] and close the scenes
