[26:34] and when he adopted the seventh seals
[26:40] there was Silence about the space of
[26:43] half an hour
[26:47] you see that's a tremendous fact
[26:52] the opening of the seventh seals
[26:56] brought silence in heaven
[27:00] the Angels
[27:06] there was no movement
[27:09] and I saw the seven angels which stood
[27:13] before God and to them were given seven
[27:18] trumpets
[27:24] and another angel came and stood at the
[27:30] altar
[27:31] um

[27:39] were given
[27:56] having a golden sensor
[28:08] that should offer it with the prayers of
[28:12] All Saints
[28:15] upon the golden altar which was before
[28:19] the throne
[28:22] and the smoke of the incense
[28:26] which came with the prayers of the

[29:54] came in
[29:58] pulled back from fellowship with God
[30:02] but God was determined to bridge that
[30:07] gap
[30:11] which was created by sin
[30:16] he determined to bridge it by a blood
[30:20] redempts
[30:28] man had trusted in a self restoration

[50:48] and he was still bloody Academy
[50:52] [Music]

[51:44] and he said it is
[51:59] foreign
[52:58] foreign
[53:11] [Applause]
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:49] [Applause]
[53:58] foreign
[54:02] [Music]
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:22] [Applause]
[54:41] it brings such a glorious job
[54:47] amen Amina I'm the four big seed
[54:53] amen amen amen I mean
[55:02] that's before I mean all of the four
[55:05] living creatures
[55:10] amen amen when you sing your songs
[55:22] because we are coming to worship
[55:25] but we are realizing that this is not
[55:29] the worship that was through the
[55:32] sovereign
[55:44] foreign
[56:23] so therefore kind of Rachel you have to
[56:26] step fourth yeah
[56:29] to break the seals
[56:34] brother Branham we're gonna bring him in
[56:36] the bridge message says
[56:46] the mystery of Gods of God God sealed in
[56:52] this mysterious seals is finished
[57:00] meaning the seventh and against one
[57:03] example
[57:04] reveals what's on the inside of the six
[57:09] series
[57:12] amen amen I did not come prepared for
[57:16] this United States but when you are
[57:19] speaking about uh
[57:23] it was to see the sick Rose
[57:30] so now brother Branham
[57:33] demonstration says then there is a seal
[57:36] put here
[57:41] then they brought the second around this
[57:47] and also sealed with the straps
[57:52] and they brought the fat body
[58:03] the only way you can get through this
[58:07] is by breaking the seventh first
[58:14] there's no way you can get on the inside
[58:17] unless the seventh is broken okay okay
[58:25] then the mystery of God that is sealed
[58:29] in this mysterious
[58:37] are you together with me when is it so
[58:39] it attacks the seventh seeds
[58:42] to release the Plan of Redemption
[58:48] amen amen because the straw I mean the
[58:51] Scrolls
[58:53] that were being opened
[58:56] if you can listen to me
[58:59] it was the seal
[59:02] foreign
[59:08] are you together with the man is it it
[59:12] sealed the world yes so the opening of
[59:15] the seals
[59:17] is to open what lays behind the World
[59:34] by putting it under symbols
[59:40] when he opened the first seal yeah
[59:57] so once God sends a prophet
[1:00:01] Indian time the minister of Malachi
[1:00:06] is to break those symbols for us
[1:00:12] so he takes 5 Thessalonians chapter 4
[1:00:18] verse 16.
[1:00:20] which says for the Lord himself shall
[1:00:24] descend from heaven
[1:00:32] the Lord
[1:00:38] and
[1:01:06] foreign
[1:01:18] haha you know the Lord himself
[1:01:30] the Lord himself what does that mean
[1:01:35] it means but our spirit being is
[1:01:42] steps forward
[1:01:44] to break the seals of the book okay
[1:01:49] but uses that means
[1:01:57] who can look into the silence
[1:02:02] and then bring your message out of the
[1:02:04] silence
[1:02:11] when kingdom is
[1:02:14] when he dreamed a dream we allowed and
[1:02:18] came to Daniel yeah and says but I don't
[1:02:22] remember it
[1:02:25] took Daniel a prophet
[1:02:28] to go into that silence
[1:02:31] bring out a message for the King
[1:02:35] when he opened the sovereign
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:11] foreign
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:03:41] [Applause]
[1:03:46] when you open the facilities
[1:03:55] but the message was in there
[1:03:57] and the prophet goes under that message
[1:04:01] amen amen to bring it down for us
[1:04:19] he says the Lord himself
[1:04:22] he does not ever glorify anybody
[1:04:27] glorify anybody is
[1:04:46] foreign
[1:05:06] [Applause]
[1:05:41] he had stepped down yarika he said
[1:05:45] the Lord himself
[1:05:49] not with that body yet
[1:05:52] but that anointing stepped down I am
[1:05:56] afraid
[1:05:57] that lived in the Jesus
[1:06:08] under that anointing and bring a message
[1:06:12] out of Silence
[1:06:30] the Angels hushed their singing in
[1:06:33] heaven
[1:06:40] cellophane
[1:06:42] they are showing the temples
[1:06:45] three sets of wings
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:52] foreign
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:27] bicycle
[1:07:28] the Angels
[1:07:30] quit singing
[1:07:35] flying in their presence in the presence
[1:07:38] of God singing
[1:07:46] No Angel singing no praises
[1:07:56] there was silence
[1:08:00] deadless silence in heaven foreign
[1:08:39] he broke it into yet
[1:08:42] they were held by
[1:08:45] itself
[1:08:47] they didn't know there it was they just
[1:08:52] stopped yeah
