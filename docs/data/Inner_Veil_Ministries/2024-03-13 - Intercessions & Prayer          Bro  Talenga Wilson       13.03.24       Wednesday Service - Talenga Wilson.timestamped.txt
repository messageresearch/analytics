[34:15] to
[34:17] be amen I want to appreciate the
[34:21] pastors for such another
[34:24] privilege to stand before
[34:28] before
[34:29] you to minister the word of the
[34:32] Lord amen amen and I'm depending on your
[34:36] prayers as I take the
[34:39] word to speak it on behalf of the holy
[34:42] spirit amen amen so let's start our
[34:46] Bibles in the Book of Luke
[34:51] 21 we shall read a few scriptures
[34:54] there and for this evening
[34:58] we are not going to read so many
[35:00] scriptures praise the lord we shall take
[35:03] a few
[35:05] studies I shall dedicate much of the
[35:07] time to
[35:09] prayer
[35:11] amen so let's turn to verse
[35:18] 33 the Bible
[35:21] says Heaven and Earth shall pass
[35:25] away but my words shall not pass
[35:29] away you believe that amen Jesus was
[35:33] speaking and
[35:35] saying that heaven and Earth shall pass
[35:38] away but my words shall not pass
[35:42] away and take hit
[35:45] yourselves L at any time your hearts be
[35:49] overcharged with
[35:52] sting and
[35:54] drunkenness and cares of this life so
[35:58] that that day come upon you una
[36:02] awes for as a snare shall it come on all
[36:05] them that dwell on the face of the whole
[36:14] earth5 watch ye therefore and pray
[36:18] always that ye may be accounted whether
[36:22] Escape all these things that shall come
[36:24] to pass and to stand before the son of
[36:26] man
[36:44] amen amen we may get
[36:47] seated amen
[36:53] amen so for
[36:56] tonight
[36:58] I want us to look at a study called
[37:00] prayer and
[37:05] intercessions praise the name of the
[37:07] Living
[37:09] God so we shall take a few scriptures
[37:12] about prayers and
[37:16] intercessions and we see how the
[37:18] scriptures encourage
[37:21] Us in the moments of
[37:23] prayer praise the Lord we've been
[37:26] looking at this study in the Sunday
[37:29] school how important it
[37:32] is for us to live a prayerful
[37:36] life praise the Living God we have seen
[37:40] a number of characters in The
[37:42] Bible a number of
[37:45] scriptures praise the Lord where Jesus
[37:48] Christ advised
[37:50] disciples the apostles to
[37:53] pray to pray
[37:56] always praise the
[37:58] and even Paul every other time he
[38:01] encouraged the
[38:02] church always pray without
[38:06] season praise the lord we have seen that
[38:09] from the old
[38:11] testament old testament
[38:13] Saints those that live the life of
[38:16] prayer and how through
[38:19] prayer they were able to
[38:21] overcome how through prayer they were
[38:24] able to change the mind of
[38:26] God through prayer they brought down
[38:31] strongholds how through prayer they
[38:35] overcame
[38:36] battles praise the Lord and Jesus here
[38:40] while
[38:41] speaking about the end of
[38:44] times in verse says therefore and pray
[38:54] always pray always
[38:58] praise the Lord not pray today when you
[39:01] come to
[39:02] church pray
[39:04] always pray when you're in the midst of
[39:06] the presence of
[39:08] God pray
[39:11] always
[39:13] everywhere men ought to pray
[39:16] everywhere lifting up their
[39:19] hands praise the name Living God so
[39:22] Jesus said pray
[39:25] always he may be accounted to
[39:32] escape to
[39:35] escape all the things that shall come to
[39:39] pass and above
[39:42] all to be able to stand before the son
[39:45] of
[39:47] man praise the name of the Living God so
[39:50] now we see that
[39:52] prayer is a key
[39:56] element
[39:58] in the Journey of our Christian
[40:00] Life praise the Lord because
[40:03] prayer is a medium of
[40:07] communication we have with our
[40:10] God praise the Lord and by prayer Jesus
[40:15] said when you pray
[40:17] always you will be able to stand the
[40:20] test of
[40:23] time you will be able to escape all
[40:27] these
[40:30] things all things that shall come to
[40:33] pass and by
[40:35] prayer praise the lord we now come to
[40:39] know the mind of
[40:41] God for our lives praise the Living God
[40:46] we shall see the story of
[40:48] je when the enemy came to attack
[40:52] him he was
[40:54] ight but yet he did recognize the one
[40:58] thing that there is a God of his
[41:02] fathers who moved them from
[41:05] Egypt and gave them a land praise the
[41:08] Lord and when he remember the
[41:11] promises that that God of his fathers
[41:13] had made with his
[41:16] fathers he never saw any anywhere in
[41:19] those
[41:21] promises his God told him that they
[41:23] would be overcome by the
[41:26] enemies
[41:28] not even any
[41:30] pestilence not any
[41:32] femine praise the Lord so when he looked
[41:34] at the promises of
[41:37] God he now went back to the Lord and he
[41:40] started reminding him one by
[41:43] one he went and approached God and he
[41:47] knew that it was only through
[41:50] prayer it was only by way of speaking to
[41:54] God that would get a solution over the
[41:58] enem praise the Living God and we shall
[42:01] see how the Lord answered
[42:04] here how the Lord assured him of
[42:07] Victory so now
[42:10] prayer helps us to know to dig into the
[42:14] mind of
[42:17] God praise the Lord the Bible says in
[42:21] the Book of James chapter
[42:24] 5 take my brethren
[42:27] James was speaking to the church and
[42:30] saying take my
[42:32] brethren the prophets who have spoken in
[42:35] the name of the
[42:36] Lord for an example of
[42:40] suffering
[42:42] Affliction and of
[42:44] patience
[42:46] take the Brethren the prophets praise
[42:50] the Lord an
[42:52] example of
[42:55] suffering and we don't only look at them
[42:58] suffering you see when they were
[43:01] suffering when they were faced with
[43:05] Affliction what did they do praise the
[43:08] lord we see each time they were faced
[43:11] with an
[43:12] Affliction they never took any other
[43:15] step turn to the Lord in
[43:18] prayer praise the lord we see the man
[43:22] the man
[43:22] Daniel a very faithful and just man who
[43:27] was serving
[43:29] diligently and when the people around
[43:32] him saw that he was a faithful
[43:35] man they laid
[43:37] snares they laid TRS for
[43:42] him to be killed praise the Lord but
[43:46] what made him
[43:48] Escape is that he never disted him from
[43:51] a prayerful
[43:54] life praise the Lord him of kneeling
[43:58] down praying to the Lord and he never
[44:03] got tired of doing that he continued
[44:06] laying down and praying and praying
[44:08] every other
[44:09] time why because he knew that that was
[44:12] the only
[44:14] weapon that was keeping him in the
[44:16] foreign
[44:17] land praise the Living God and even when
[44:21] they
[44:22] conspired even when they
[44:25] conspired because he had established a
[44:28] relationship with
[44:30] God he was living in a personal
[44:33] relationship with
[44:36] God and he had a testimony of the about
[44:40] prayer he continued
[44:43] praying when he was thrown in the dead
[44:47] he continued in the same and the Lord
[44:50] delivered
[44:51] him praise the Living God we have so
[44:54] many of these
[44:56] examples last uh last Sunday we saw uh
[45:00] Moses when he came down from Mount
[45:04] Si and he found that the children of
[45:08] Israel they had again gone
[45:10] astray praise the Lord they demanded
[45:13] that Aaron makes them another
[45:16] God they had not looked at the examples
[45:19] that God had laid before
[45:22] them so they had lost
[45:24] patience but the scripture tells
[45:28] look at the prophets and learn of their
[45:31] Pati how patient they were and they
[45:35] remained in prayer
[45:37] throughout so when Moses came down he
[45:41] expected that the people were in prayer
[45:43] and
[45:45] intercession they were
[45:47] off and they had they had demanded that
[45:50] they at least worship another God they
[45:52] able to
[45:54] see and Aaron granted it to them
[45:58] but we see Moses when he saw that now
[46:01] the people were going to face
[46:04] destruction God was determined to Destro
[46:06] all the
[46:08] people he R back to God and he began to
[46:12] pray never prayed for himself because he
[46:15] was still rightous before the eyes of
[46:18] but he
[46:19] interceded on behalf of those that had
[46:22] fallen praise the Living God so now in
[46:25] prayer we do not only pray for
[46:28] ourselves but we also pray for those
[46:31] that have
[46:32] fallen we also pray for those that have
[46:34] come short
[46:36] of Moses stood and he questioned God he
[46:41] told God repent of this thing that you
[46:44] have decided to
[46:46] do these are your people you've chosen
[46:50] them and you've given them a promise
[46:53] that they shall inherit this land and
[46:56] that their children
[46:57] and the children of their children will
[47:00] inherit this blessing now if you destroy
[47:03] them today shall take on those
[47:06] promises and God looked back and he saw
[47:10] the
[47:11] promises that he had made with Israel
[47:14] and he repented not to destroy the
[47:18] people prayer and
[47:20] intercession the ability to enter into
[47:23] the mind of
[47:24] God praise the Lord bring out all those
[47:29] promises and bring out all the
[47:31] blessings that God has ordained for
[47:35] you prayer is a very important we praise
[47:39] the Lord and now it says
[47:41] behold we count them happy which
[47:46] endure we count them happy which
[47:50] endure you have heard of the patience of
[47:54] Job he was now breaking one by
[47:57] one he says you hear of the patience of
[48:00] Job and have seen the end of the
[48:03] Lord that the Lord is very
[48:07] pitiful and of tender
[48:10] Mercy praise the Lord he was teaching
[48:13] them and he reminded them of job he told
[48:16] them of how many of you have gone
[48:19] through the Affliction that that
[48:22] was yet he was
[48:25] patient he never TR God but he was
[48:28] patient and he waited to the
[48:31] end praise the Lord and so he says here
[48:35] is any among you
[48:39] Afflicted let him not run away but let
[48:43] him
[48:44] pray praise the Lord is any Among Us
[48:48] Afflicted is there any among us having
[48:52] troubles is any among us through
[48:56] difficulties
[48:57] do not go tell your neighbor do not tell
[49:00] your
[49:01] friends God has provided us with only
[49:04] one
[49:05] Avenue is to pray praise the Lord say is
[49:09] any among you
[49:11] Afflicted let him pray because when you
[49:15] pray you are consecrating yourself to
[49:19] God when you pray you're closing out all
[49:23] other doors and you only opening up your
[49:26] door to the Lord
[49:28] in other words you have acknowledged
[49:31] that everything else has
[49:33] failed and the only you have is but
[49:38] God is
[49:40] Afflicted let him kneel down and pray is
[49:43] any that is
[49:45] married God has blessed you you overcome
[49:49] and now you're
[49:50] married let him sing
[49:53] Psalms praise the Lord that you've
[49:56] prayed enough
[49:58] and God has answered your prayer and now
[50:01] that you received your blessing you
[50:03] don't run
[50:04] away you don't walk away says you be
[50:09] married and you sing SS unto the Lord
[50:13] and then he says is
[50:15] any sick among
[50:18] you praise the Lord the first thing that
[50:21] the Bible says it doesn't say if you're
[50:25] sick praise the Lord you run the first
[50:29] thing should tell you go to a
[50:31] doctor because even the
[50:34] doctor they have they have a
[50:37] moror that they
[50:39] treat but God heals praise the Lord so
[50:43] now if they
[50:44] treat God heals and that you are on the
[50:50] well praise the Lord now why do you
[50:53] first run to the doctor before you pray
[50:57] is any among you sick let him call on
[51:00] the ERS of the
[51:01] church let them pray over
[51:05] him praise the Lord why because they are
[51:09] directly
[51:11] connected you are directly connected
[51:13] directly
[51:15] connected to the great
[51:17] physician praise the Lord upon whom the
[51:20] doctor is
[51:22] waiting as he continues to administer
[51:24] the
[51:25] treatment so the first thing the Bible
[51:27] tells
[51:28] us is prayer praise the Lord if you
[51:32] cannot pray look for the
[51:35] older lay hands upon you anoint you with
[51:38] oil and pray in the name of the
[51:42] Lord and the Bible says if they shall
[51:45] have
[51:46] faith if you shall have
[51:49] faith if I shall have faith praise the
[51:53] Lord a very key element here
[51:57] a very key
[51:59] element in prayer Faith praise the Lord
[52:03] says if they shall have
[52:07] faith and the prayer of faith shall save
[52:11] the
[52:13] sick the Lord shall raise him
[52:16] up and if you have committed
[52:20] sins they shall be
[52:22] forgiven praise the Lord B isn't saying
[52:27] that when you are out there and you have
[52:30] committed sin and you continue running
[52:34] away shall be forgiven of you but says
[52:38] when you
[52:39] pray and call on the name of the Lord
[52:43] and repent in the name of the Lord the
[52:46] sin shall be forgiven of you and the B
[52:49] says confess your FAL to
[52:54] another and then
[52:57] pray one for
[53:00] another praise the Lord that you may be
[53:05] healed the effectual F prayer of a
[53:08] righteous man a
[53:12] much and remember you are the
[53:16] Righteous why because we have been
[53:19] washed we are been cleansed by his blood
[53:23] and we are the Righteous ones so now if
[53:26] you make your fav and
[53:28] prayer it a much praise the Lord Prayer
[53:34] is a very key element in our
[53:36] lives and then he gives another
[53:39] example and says you remember
[53:42] Elijah he was a man subject like
[53:45] passions as we
[53:48] are and he prayed
[53:51] honestly might not rain he prayed with
[53:55] faith
[53:57] and when he
[53:58] prayed and asked God to shut the the
[54:03] clouds to shut the
[54:05] heavens God answered him regardless of
[54:09] the negative effects it would
[54:12] cause as long as it is a righteous man
[54:15] who knelt and prayed unto the
[54:19] lordless of what God had planned for the
[54:22] Earth but as long as Elijah prayed and
[54:25] asked God shut the
[54:28] r shut the heavens and it never rains
[54:33] the power of
[54:35] prayer praise the Lord Prayer is a
[54:38] powerful
[54:39] weapon that we should utilize
[54:43] everywhere that's why the says pray
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:47] always pray
[54:49] everywhere praise the living he was a
[54:52] man subject like passions as we are
[54:56] but yet he recognized the power of
[54:59] prayer and he prayed
[55:03] honestly it rained not he never prayed
[55:07] one day God his mind was different from
[55:10] his
[55:12] mind he pray today and again pray
[55:16] tomorrow says God this is what I want to
[55:21] see praise the Lord and he kept on
[55:25] reminding reminded God today tomorrow
[55:29] the other day the other day and God
[55:32] granted his his reest and it rained not
[55:37] which request do we
[55:39] have which request do we have God is in
[55:43] position to shut the
[55:46] heavens that it rains not not even
[55:50] minding about the people that we are
[55:51] dwelling on on the
[55:53] Earth but simply because the right man
[55:56] ask for Rich which request do we have
[56:00] that God cannot
[56:02] permit praise the Living God only if we
[56:05] can
[56:06] recognize that we have the power praise
[56:10] the Lord as a
[56:12] righteous praise the Lord and he prayed
[56:16] again when he saw that God had done it
[56:19] for three years and six months no rain
[56:25] he said this is I asked to you and the
[56:28] three and a half years are
[56:30] done now I pray thee open the heavens
[56:36] that it may rain and says and he prayed
[56:40] again he never looked
[56:42] on he never just looked on he had a
[56:46] desire he had a mind he had a thought
[56:50] that he wanted to
[56:52] express and he wanted to see his thought
[56:55] expressed
[56:57] and now he put it to practice and says
[57:00] now God three and a half years are
[57:04] done open the and says and he prayed
[57:09] again and the heaven gave
[57:12] rain and the Earth brought forth her
[57:15] fruit prayer is the way that we can
[57:19] communicate to
[57:22] God is the channel that we have
[57:26] to speak to God praise the Lord so now
[57:30] if we know that we can speak to our God
[57:33] as a
[57:36] friend ask him of all that we have
[57:40] need then why don't we pray why don't we
[57:44] our hearts why don't we pour out our
[57:48] minds why don't we speak to the Lord in
[57:51] pray praise the lord we read the
[57:53] scripture last
[57:55] Sunday prise the Lord where God
[57:57] instructs us to come close come close to
[58:00] him he says come close to come let us
[58:04] sit down and let us reason together as
[58:07] friends and he says even if your sins
[58:11] are so
[58:12] many they shall be forgiven and they
[58:14] shall become as wait
[58:16] as God himself inviting us to himself so
[58:21] regardless of how the devil has hit us
[58:25] down to speak to the Lord we have an
[58:29] opportunity to have our sins cleansed we
[58:33] have the opportunity to have our sins
[58:36] forgiven he says come let us reason
[58:41] together come let us speak to one
[58:44] another he invites us to speak to him as
[58:49] friends how do we speak to him not by
[58:52] way of crying praise the Lord not by way
[58:55] of cursing
[58:57] but by way of
[58:58] prayer praise the Lord you come and
[59:01] start speaking to
[59:02] him and telling him all that you have
[59:06] need all your worries and then as your
[59:09] praying the Bible says pray one for
[59:13] another praise the Lord you remember
[59:16] when you're praying was a certain
[59:19] brother a certain sister who used to sit
[59:22] in such and such position but he's no
[59:25] longer coming
[59:26] maybe he has fallen short of Grace then
[59:29] you take them up in prayer and begin
[59:31] praying for them and you enter into a
[59:34] moment of prayer and you intercede for
[59:36] them you are praying for them that the
[59:40] Lord may have mercy upon them and
[59:42] because it's your request and you're
[59:45] calling on the Lord you forgive that
[59:48] brother forgive that sister and bring
[59:51] him back the Lord shall Grant your
[59:54] request praise the Lord pray one for
[59:57] another not only praying for
[1:00:00] ourselves but also praying for one

[1:00:51] Bible praise the Lord where certain of
[1:00:54] the body of Christ
