minister the word of the Lord amen amen and I'm depending on your prayers as I take the word to speak it on behalf of the holy spirit amen amen so let's start our Bibles in the Book of Luke 21 we shall read a few scriptures there and for this evening we are not going to read so many scriptures praise the lord we shall take a few studies I shall dedicate much of the time to prayer amen so let's turn to verse 33 the Bible says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away you believe that amen Jesus was speaking and saying that heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take hit yourselves L at any time your hearts be overcharged with sting and drunkenness and cares of this life so that that day come upon you una awes for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth5 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted whether Escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man amen amen we may get seated amen amen so for tonight I want us to look at a study called prayer and intercessions praise the name of the Living God so we shall take a few scriptures about prayers and intercessions and we see how the scriptures encourage Us in the moments of prayer praise the Lord we've been looking at this study in the Sunday school how important it is for us to live a prayerful life praise the Living God we have seen a number of characters in The Bible a number of scriptures praise the Lord where Jesus Christ advised disciples the apostles to pray to pray always praise the and even Paul every other time he encouraged the church always pray without season praise the lord we have seen that from the old testament old testament Saints those that live the life of prayer and how through prayer they were able to overcome how through prayer they were able to change the mind of God through prayer they brought down strongholds how through prayer they overcame battles praise the Lord and Jesus here while speaking about the end of times in verse says therefore and pray always pray always praise the Lord not pray today when you come to church pray always pray when you're in the midst of the presence of God pray always everywhere men ought to pray everywhere lifting up their hands praise the name Living God so Jesus said pray always he may be accounted to escape to escape all the things that shall come to pass and above all to be able to stand before the son of man praise the name of the Living God so now we see that prayer is a key element in the Journey of our Christian Life praise the Lord because prayer is a medium of communication we have with our God praise the Lord and by prayer Jesus said when you pray always you will be able to stand the test of time you will be able to escape all these things all things that shall come to pass and by prayer praise the lord we now come to know the mind of God for our lives praise the Living God we shall see the story of je when the enemy came to attack him he was ight but yet he did recognize the one thing that there is a God of his fathers who moved them from Egypt and gave them a land praise the Lord and when he remember the promises that that God of his fathers had made with his fathers he never saw any anywhere in those promises his God told him that they would be overcome by the enemies not even any pestilence not any femine praise the Lord so when he looked at the promises of God he now went back to the Lord and he started reminding him one by one he went and approached God and he knew that it was only through prayer it was only by way of speaking to God that would get a solution over the enem praise the Living God and we shall see how the Lord answered here how the Lord assured him of Victory so now prayer helps us to know to dig into the mind of God praise the Lord the Bible says in the Book of James chapter 5 take my brethren James was speaking to the church and saying take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience take the Brethren the prophets praise the Lord an example of suffering and we don't only look at them suffering you see when they were suffering when they were faced with Affliction what did they do praise the lord we see each time they were faced with an Affliction they never took any other step turn to the Lord in prayer praise the lord we see the man the man Daniel a very faithful and just man who was serving diligently and when the people around him saw that he was a faithful man they laid snares they laid TRS for him to be killed praise the Lord but what made him Escape is that he never disted him from a prayerful life praise the Lord him of kneeling down praying to the Lord and he never got tired of doing that he continued laying down and praying and praying every other time why because he knew that that was the only weapon that was keeping him in the foreign land praise the Living God and even when they conspired even when they conspired because he had established a relationship with God he was living in a personal relationship with God and he had a testimony of the about prayer he continued praying when he was thrown in the dead he continued in the same and the Lord delivered him praise the Living God we have so many of these examples last uh last Sunday we saw uh Moses when he came down from Mount Si and he found that the children of Israel they had again gone astray praise the Lord they demanded that Aaron makes them another God they had not looked at the examples that God had laid before them so they had lost patience but the scripture tells look at the prophets and learn of their Pati how patient they were and they remained in prayer throughout so when Moses came down he expected that the people were in prayer and intercession they were off and they had they had demanded that they at least worship another God they able to see and Aaron granted it to them but we see Moses when he saw that now the people were going to face destruction God was determined to Destro all the people he R back to God and he began to pray never prayed for himself because he was still rightous before the eyes of but he interceded on behalf of those that had fallen praise the Living God so now in prayer we do not only pray for ourselves but we also pray for those that have fallen we also pray for those that have come short of Moses stood and he questioned God he told God repent of this thing that you have decided to do these are your people you've chosen them and you've given them a promise that they shall inherit this land and that their children and the children of their children will inherit this blessing now if you destroy them today shall take on those promises and God looked back and he saw the promises that he had made with Israel and he repented not to destroy the people prayer and intercession the ability to enter into the mind of God praise the Lord bring out all those promises and bring out all the blessings that God has ordained for you prayer is a very important we praise the Lord and now it says behold we count them happy which endure we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job he was now breaking one by one he says you hear of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy praise the Lord he was teaching them and he reminded them of job he told them of how many of you have gone through the Affliction that that was yet he was patient he never TR God but he was patient and he waited to the end praise the Lord and so he says here is any among you Afflicted let him not run away but let him pray praise the Lord is any Among Us Afflicted is there any among us having troubles is any among us through difficulties do not go tell your neighbor do not tell your friends God has provided us with only one Avenue is to pray praise the Lord say is any among you Afflicted let him pray because when you pray you are consecrating yourself to God when you pray you're closing out all other doors and you only opening up your door to the Lord in other words you have acknowledged that everything else has failed and the only you have is but God is Afflicted let him kneel down and pray is any that is married God has blessed you you overcome and now you're married let him sing Psalms praise the Lord that you've prayed enough and God has answered your prayer and now that you received your blessing you don't run away you don't walk away says you be married and you sing SS unto the Lord and then he says is any sick among you praise the Lord the first thing that the Bible says it doesn't say if you're sick praise the Lord you run the first thing should tell you go to a doctor because even the doctor they have they have a moror that they treat but God heals praise the Lord so now if they treat God heals and that you are on the well praise the Lord now why do you first run to the doctor before you pray is any among you sick let him call on the ERS of the church let them pray over him praise the Lord why because they are directly connected you are directly connected directly connected to the great physician praise the Lord upon whom the doctor is waiting as he continues to administer the treatment so the first thing the Bible tells us is prayer praise the Lord if you cannot pray look for the older lay hands upon you anoint you with oil and pray in the name of the Lord and the Bible says if they shall have faith if you shall have faith if I shall have faith praise the Lord a very key element here a very key element in prayer Faith praise the Lord says if they shall have faith and the prayer of faith shall save the sick the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven praise the Lord B isn't saying that when you are out there and you have committed sin and you continue running away shall be forgiven of you but says when you pray and call on the name of the Lord and repent in the name of the Lord the sin shall be forgiven of you and the B says confess your FAL to another and then pray one for another praise the Lord that you may be healed the effectual F prayer of a righteous man a much and remember you are the Righteous why because we have been washed we are been cleansed by his blood and we are the Righteous ones so now if you make your fav and prayer it a much praise the Lord Prayer is a very key element in our lives and then he gives another example and says you remember Elijah he was a man subject like passions as we are and he prayed honestly might not rain he prayed with faith and when he prayed and asked God to shut the the clouds to shut the heavens God answered him regardless of the negative effects it would cause as long as it is a righteous man who knelt and prayed unto the lordless of what God had planned for the Earth but as long as Elijah prayed and asked God shut the r shut the heavens and it never rains the power of prayer praise the Lord Prayer is a powerful weapon that we should utilize everywhere that's why the says pray [Applause] always pray everywhere praise the living he was a man subject like passions as we are but yet he recognized the power of prayer and he prayed honestly it rained not he never prayed one day God his mind was different from his mind he pray today and again pray tomorrow says God this is what I want to see praise the Lord and he kept on reminding reminded God today tomorrow the other day the other day and God granted his his reest and it rained not which request do we have which request do we have God is in position to shut the heavens that it rains not not even minding about the people that we are dwelling on on the Earth but simply because the right man ask for Rich which request do we have that God cannot permit praise the Living God only if we can recognize that we have the power praise the Lord as a righteous praise the Lord and he prayed again when he saw that God had done it for three years and six months no rain he said this is I asked to you and the three and a half years are done now I pray thee open the heavens that it may rain and says and he prayed again he never looked on he never just looked on he had a desire he had a mind he had a thought that he wanted to express and he wanted to see his thought expressed and now he put it to practice and says now God three and a half years are done open the and says and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit prayer is the way that we can communicate to God is the channel that we have to speak to God praise the Lord so now if we know that we can speak to our God as a friend ask him of all that we have need then why don't we pray why don't we our hearts why don't we pour out our minds why don't we speak to the Lord in pray praise the lord we read the scripture last Sunday prise the Lord where God instructs us to come close come close to him he says come close to come let us sit down and let us reason together as friends and he says even if your sins are so many they shall be forgiven and they shall become as wait as God himself inviting us to himself so regardless of how the devil has hit us down to speak to the Lord we have an opportunity to have our sins cleansed we have the opportunity to have our sins forgiven he says come let us reason together come let us speak to one another he invites us to speak to him as friends how do we speak to him not by way of crying praise the Lord not by way of cursing but by way of prayer praise the Lord you come and start speaking to him and telling him all that you have need all your worries and then as your praying the Bible says pray one for another praise the Lord you remember when you're praying was a certain brother a certain sister who used to sit in such and such position but he's no longer coming maybe he has fallen short of Grace then you take them up in prayer and begin praying for them and you enter into a moment of prayer and you intercede for them you are praying for them that the Lord may have mercy upon them and because it's your request and you're calling on the Lord you forgive that brother forgive that sister and bring him back the Lord shall Grant your request praise the Lord pray one for another not only praying for ourselves but also praying for one another would have stood and said they are wicked people they have disobeyed you go ahead destroy them no he had pity over them betiful be be forgiving and pray one for another praise the name of the living we have a brother who is going through Affliction let us pray an honest prayer praise the Lord an honest prayer let us intered it requires us to intered together as a church yes sir it also happened in the Bible praise the Lord where certain of the body of Christ under Affliction and being persecuted praise the Lord and the church pray together and the Lord delivered them we can always pray and the Lord shall do his deliver praise the Lord if there any sick among us let them come let them invade the elders praise the Lord and let them lay hands upon them and when they pray a prayer of faith the sick shall recover praise the Lord he was a man that feared the Lord and this man he got information that there was an enemy that was coming to destroy them praise the Lord second chonicles 20 let's read there verse one it came to pass after this also that the children of and the children of Amon and with them other beside the Ammon came against Jehoshaphat to battle Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on this side Syria and behold there be they be and Je feared and set himself to seek the Lord praise the Lord news came to him praise the Lord it came to him they have gathered and there are many in number and they come up to destroy you praise the Lord says and he feared so much and when he feared what did he do he set himself to seek the Lord praise the Lord and he did not end there but he also declared a first throughout and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord is there any of you that is afflicted let them seek the Lord is there any of you that is Afflicted let them seek the Lord so this is an Affliction and they were being troubled praise the Lord and when they being troubled they never shouted they never cured because they were faced with this challenge because faced with this problem but what did they do they went to seek the Lord praise the Lord and He declared a fting praise the Lord a consecration to the Lord to close all other doors go and seek the Lord praise the Lord and the Bible says and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem verse five in the house of the Lord before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers he Now set the congregation in order and he said the people to go and seek the Lord because they were faced with trouble they were faced with Affliction there was a problem in the house praise the Lord and so they were set to seek the Lord and when they were seeking the Lord he began to speak to the Lord and said oh Lord God of our father not thou God in heaven God knows that he's the God in heaven but Jehosaphat is reminding him that are you not the God in heaven in other words the was appreciating the fact that is God above all praise the Lord and remember our God deserves Praises Our God deserves praises and his Praises break his heart prise the Lord it breaks him to open up the promises and the bless it does not mean that the Lord was not knowing what was coming yes he saw that the enemy was gathering praise the Lord but then he was waiting upon praise the Lord take a St and call him on the seene I want you to see what God did here and says aren you God in heaven and rules not thou over all the kingdoms of the he is there not power and might so that man is able to with you and remember if we have faith we shall speak to the mountain and say get this moved and it shall come to pass and now here he's reminding are you not the god of above all who has all power and might and no one is able to withand you is there anything that is too hard for the Lord telling him you are God and we worship you and recognize that you the Lord above all there is nothing that is beyond you there is nothing that we and there is nothing that we confess that you cannot with he was appreciating that praise the Lord and he said not thou Our God yes he knew that he was their God but he saying are you not who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave it to the seity of Abraham th friend forever praise the Lord he went into the archives of God praise the Lord and he started digging one by one opening one page says yes sir I remember you say you are the Lord God above all and there is none like you and again he opened another one said yes sir I remember you are the Lord God who promised this land to give it to the children of our the seed of Abram to to enjoy it forever reminding God In Prayer he speak to him as a friend and says now you God you said you shall give this land to Abraham your friend forever he was touching those points of God because remember God had had a very good work with Abraham and he had made his Covenant with him and had promised him a that would give him and his seed to take forever do you know that you have a friend a friend called Abraham who you walked with you promised him and you gave him Isaac and he said this same land shall be unto him for an inheritance and God said yes sir I remember that and says if when evil comes upon us after he's done reminding him of all his promises he says now all those promises you promised me to only seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and that all things shall be given unto me praise the Lord now I am here I need this but you promised me let me Seek You I have sought you are you not the one who gave me that promise reminding God of his promises in pray reminding God of his obligations he is aware of his obligations waiting on us waiting upon us to come and reason together with him to come and speak to him as he may open up praise the Lord and says now after all that when evil comes upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or fine we stand before this house and in thy presence for th name is in this house fory name is in this house which house you are the house you are the temple of the Living God praise the Lord now you're standing before his pres and reminding that your name lives in this Temple that this Temple is here to Proclaim your name this Temple Proclaim your promises now if your name in this house we cry unto thee in our affliction then thou will hear and help now behold the children of Ammon praise the Lord this is very interesting after he has broken down all the promises of God after he has told him the entire journey and he has brought down all the pages now he's
