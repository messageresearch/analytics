[43:43] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[43:45] unworthily,
[43:47] eateth and drinkkeeth
[43:49] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[43:53] Lord's body.
[44:04] We are talking about the discerning of
[44:06] the Lord's body.
[44:11] So I'm going to take this service
[44:15] and I'm putting it on the preaching of
[44:18] stability.
[44:22] So it's preaching stability
[44:26] and the title is autoimmunity.
[44:33] Have you ever seen a body fight itself?
[44:37] It would be very pathetic.
[44:43] You try a slap on your face.
[44:47] Not just by touching.
[44:50] It's practically impossible.
[44:54] So I'm preaching stability
[44:59] and the title is autoimmunity.
[45:05] You may be seated.
[45:07] I think you know autoimmunity is
[45:11] selfdestruction of the body.
[45:17] Um
[45:19] I think I would rather use the word
[45:26] you know, use your teeth on your body.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; And try to pull a punch a chunk of your
[45:35] your your your flesh.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; So that's how
[45:42] unnatural autoimmunity is.
[45:48] So I'm taking a quote here from
[45:50] discerning the body of the lord
[45:56] where brotherham says
[45:58] I wonder sometimes
[46:01] if we can discern right from wrong
[46:05] for our own bodies.
[46:10] Amen. Especially the Lord's body.
[46:15] We don't discern right from wrong
[46:19] from our own bodies.
[46:24] And week after week, month after month
[46:28] and year after year,
[46:30] science work in the laboratories
[46:34] and set great big scriptures
[46:38] and everything and advertisements
[46:42] and warns people. Cancer by the cattle.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:03] You know they announce cancer by the
[47:04] curtains.
[47:06] Movie two men 27
[47:12] something thousand Americans
[47:18] will die this year from smoking
[47:21] cigarettes
[47:24] and you smoke cigarettes right
[47:29] we can't even discern our own bodies
[47:33] let alone discerning the Holy Spirit
[47:40] Amen. Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; In the body of the church.
[47:44] So, brother Bra has got a concern
[47:48] that we are a people
[47:50] that even don't understand
[47:54] how important this our bodies are
[47:59] that regardless of what the doctor say
[48:03] the people continue smoking. People
[48:07] continue drinking.
[48:09] People continue with feeding habits that
[48:12] are not good.
[48:15] And he says the same way
[48:18] we fail to discern the Holy Spirit
[48:22] in the body of the church.
[48:25] Amen. So the question here is
[48:29] if we cannot discern what is good for
[48:31] our natural bodies,
[48:36] can we be able to discern
[48:39] what's good for the body of the church?
[48:44] You see, many people get sick
[48:47] and die for failing to discern what's
[48:50] good for their natural bodies.
[48:55] Then they suffer from cancer,
[48:58] diabetes,
[49:00] high blood pressure,
[49:02] different diseases.
[49:04] And in the spiritual body too,
[49:07] we can hit a snack
[49:16] in life because we fail
[49:19] to discern the Lord's body.
[49:22] Amen. Amen. You look at your brother
[49:25] And you just look at him as a man we go
[49:27] to church together.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; But this man here is a tabernacle of the
[49:34] living God.
[49:36] That's the way you should look at him.
[49:39] Don't look at him as a man who goes to
[49:41] the same church with
[49:44] only that he sits on the other side
[49:47] and therefore we are not close to one
[49:49] another.
[49:51] The prophet says here in the message God
[49:54] using his gift
[49:57] and he gave his life
[50:00] his blood
[50:02] that the sexual born people
[50:07] could come back into fellowship.
[50:11] Are you together with me? That these
[50:13] people here can come back in
[50:17] [Music]
[50:19] with him and be part of him. So it's God
[50:26] not in a pillar of fire,
[50:28] not God in Christ.
[50:30] It's in you.
[50:34] You need to change the way you look and
[50:37] at God.
[50:40] Don't look at God
[50:43] like the God that was leading the
[50:45] children of Israel
[50:48] in the wilderness by a pillar of fire.
[50:51] Don't look at God
[50:54] by looking at him in the body of Christ.
[50:58] He says you need to look at God,
[51:02] the one who dwells in us.
[51:05] that when you see me, you are seeing a
[51:08] portion of God.
[51:11] Amen. Amen. All that God was, he poured
[51:15] into Christ. In him drove the fullness
[51:18] of the Godhead.
[51:21] And all that God was in Christ,
[51:24] he poured into the church.
[51:27] Amen. So now you are part of God.
[51:32] One time Christ was the Godhead bond.
[51:38] But when he went and took glory
[51:42] and he poured back his spirit
[51:46] into the church body
[51:49] and now the body of the church
[51:52] is the fullness of the god body.
[51:56] So when I'm talking about
[51:59] recognizing the body of Christ,
[52:03] I'm talking about recognizing the
[52:05] brotherhood,
[52:08] that we are one,
[52:10] that we are a family.
[52:13] Amen. We are united together
[52:16] by one spirit. So now look at it by
[52:20] recognizing your body.
[52:23] Amen. By recognizing, say, for example,
[52:25] your brother
[52:28] and his position in the body,
[52:31] you are rightly
[52:33] discerning the Lord's body.
[52:38] Because you understand your brother,
[52:42] by who he is. Last time when I was here,
[52:47] I was dealing with the subject of who am
[52:49] I?
[52:51] Amen. So these men here who knew John by
[52:55] name,
[52:57] they went out to John and said, "Who are
[53:00] you?"
[53:02] Meaning that who are you?
[53:05] Amen. In the body of Christ.
[53:09] And so when they knew John,
[53:12] they knew him by his position in the
[53:15] body. We need to recognize one another.
[53:19] Amen. how important we are in the body
[53:22] of Christ,
[53:24] we can be blessed in these things.
[53:27] If we can be able to look beyond the
[53:29] natural,
[53:32] see God in each other.
[53:35] Amen. Amen. And because our bodies are
[53:38] naturally real,
[53:41] you know this body here is real.
[53:44] This body here is not a vis.
[53:47] Are you together with me? Then say amen.
[53:51] Yeah, this body here is not this.
[53:55] It's a natural reality.
[53:59] It's not an imitation.
[54:02] So God uses these bodies
[54:05] to teach the relationship
[54:09] between you and your brother in the body
[54:13] of Christ.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So those that are genuinely
[54:17] baptized by the Holy Ghost,
[54:21] they make the body of Christ
[54:24] which is more real
[54:28] than this body here.
[54:30] Are you together with me? So in the
[54:32] natural
[54:34] let me say this in your natural setup
[54:38] [Music]
[54:41] you as a man or a woman
[54:44] if one leg is hurt.
[54:48] You don't desire the other leg to be
[54:50] hurt also
[54:54] so that it may go so that it may not go
[54:56] into blame game
[55:01] because you are walking
[55:03] and then you hurt your leg.
[55:06] You wouldn't want this leg
[55:09] to be hurt.
[55:11] But naturally
[55:13] sometimes in our walk in church
[55:17] if this leg is hurt
[55:20] sometimes this leg here which is hurt
[55:24] would start to say this other body here
[55:29] is going to blame me.
[55:31] This leg is going to blame me. I wish
[55:34] this leg also
[55:37] get hurt.
[55:42] Sometimes that's how we think in church.
[55:45] We come back and then when God is
[55:48] putting us on the spot,
[55:51] you just said the woman you gather,
[55:55] you enter into blame game.
[55:59] But in the body which is a reality
[56:03] if this hand here is hurt
[56:06] this hand here will come to protect the
[56:09] heart
[56:11] which has been hurt. Are you together
[56:13] with me? So the body is built in such a
[56:17] way
[56:19] that its members
[56:22] work in honor for each other.
[56:26] Amen. And they work in synchronization.
[56:32] Amen. You see, there is no member
[56:35] that will do not go to protect another
[56:37] man.
[56:40] Praise the Lord. If you fall, then your
[56:44] hands,
[56:46] the hands will move
[56:49] try to support the part
[56:52] which is hurt. There is no debate.
[56:56] There's no meeting
[56:59] which is s among the members of the body
[57:03] that this part here should agree and
[57:05] help the other part
[57:09] but because they are one
[57:12] every member of the body
[57:14] moves in support of the other.
[57:18] Amen. And this is the kind of church
[57:22] that I try to look at.
[57:25] church which realizes
[57:28] we are a body.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; So now your body has many members
[57:37] that must work together
[57:40] under the command of one intelligence.
[57:46] The mind commands the body
[57:50] and all the parts of the body
[57:53] are subject to one mind.
[57:57] And that's why Paul says
[58:00] to the church of Corinth
[58:02] that as a body we all have the same
[58:06] mind.
[58:08] Amen. to be connected to the mind of
[58:11] Christ
[58:13] to think like a Christ to judge like a
[58:16] Christ and therefore act like amen
[58:22] is the mind
[58:24] and the natural movement
[58:27] of the body of Christ here on earth.
[58:30] Amen. That's how we can be a strong
[58:34] local church.
[58:37] Amen. We can't be members
[58:41] of the local church and distance
[58:44] ourselves
[58:46] from our responsibility.
[58:51] If there is anything in church,
[58:54] that must be done.
[58:57] You said that must be done by me.
[59:02] I love strong. Amen.
[59:05] I can hear you.
[59:08] Praise the Lord.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; It's very important for us
[59:13] to subject ourselves
[59:16] &gt;&gt; to the leadership of that supernatural
[59:19] man
[59:22] because that supernatural man
[59:25] works in every member of the body.
[59:29] Amen. That's the way you know the church
[59:32] moves
[59:34] under the same intelligence.
[59:37] which is Christ.
[59:40] Let this mind be you
[59:43] which was in Christ Jesus.
[59:46] If the mind of Christ is in this
[59:49] individual
[59:50] in that individual in that individual
[59:54] together which makes us the body of
[59:57] Christ.
[59:59] Amen. So 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:00:04] and verse 15
[1:00:07] he says
[1:00:09] if the foot shall say
[1:00:13] because I am not in the hand
[1:00:16] I am not of the body. Is it therefore
[1:00:20] not of the body
[1:00:26] simply because it's not the other part
[1:00:28] of the body?
[1:00:31] If I'm not the pastor,
[1:00:35] therefore I'm not part of the body.
[1:00:39] Are you together with me? He's trying to
[1:00:42] make us understand
[1:00:45] the spiritual body,
[1:00:48] the church.
[1:00:49] And if the ear shall say,
[1:00:52] because I'm not the eye, I am not of the
[1:00:56] body.
[1:00:57] Is it therefore not of the body?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; If the body were annihil
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:21] because I'm not the heart then I am not
[1:01:24] of the the the body.
[1:01:27] And then the the eye says because I'm
[1:01:30] not the ear
[1:01:32] then I'm not part of the body. So Paul
[1:01:35] said
[1:01:37] then if the whole body
[1:01:41] amen was one part
[1:01:49] then where would the hearing be?
[1:01:52] If the war here is
[1:01:55] where the smelling,
[1:01:58] we cannot be the same in the body of
[1:02:00] Christ.
[1:02:02] And whatsoever we are, we must accept,
[1:02:07] we must appreciate.
[1:02:09] And you that looks at me as a different
[1:02:12] part of the body, you must honor me
[1:02:18] because I'm necessary
[1:02:21] in the absence of the eye,
[1:02:24] then the whole body cannot move.
[1:02:27] But now verse 18,
[1:02:31] God set the members of every one of them
[1:02:34] in the body.
[1:02:39] As it pleased him,
[1:02:42] in order not to please you,
[1:02:44] but as it pleased him,
[1:02:47] as it pleased God,
[1:02:49] he made him an interpreter.
[1:02:53] As it pleased God,
[1:02:55] it made brother
[1:03:00] God.
[1:03:02] He made brother to be a deacon.
[1:03:06] He pleased God. He makes to become a
[1:03:09] song.
[1:03:14] He has made you what you are.
[1:03:19] So that the body must move.
[1:03:22] as a component.
[1:03:25] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. The
[1:03:28] functioning of the natural body
[1:03:31] literally teaches us
[1:03:34] that though we being many
[1:03:38] are one body
[1:03:40] that must be driven
[1:03:42] by the same mind.
[1:03:44] This mind is the mind of Christ.
[1:03:48] Christ
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; is the intelligence
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Philippians
[1:04:00] chapter 2 and verse 5.
[1:04:03] He says, "Let this mind be you
[1:04:08] which was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:04:12] Let this mind be you
[1:04:16] which was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:04:20] Then in the next verse,
[1:04:23] Paul describes the mind
[1:04:26] which was in Christ and it was the mind
[1:04:30] of humility.
[1:04:34] Are you together with me? Let this mind
[1:04:37] be you.
[1:04:39] a mind of humility
[1:04:42] to accept what God has made you
[1:04:46] work as God has allowed you to work.
[1:04:51] He says, "Who being in the form of God,
[1:04:55] count it not to be equal to God."
[1:05:01] But Jesus made himself of no reputation,
[1:05:06] and took upon him the form of a servant.
[1:05:10] and was made in the likeness of men.
[1:05:14] That's what the mind made Christ.
[1:05:18] It helped him to humble himself
[1:05:21] in the position
[1:05:23] that God had ordained him for.
[1:05:27] Amen. He made himself of no reputation
[1:05:32] when he condescended from Elohim
[1:05:36] and then come down into Logos.
[1:05:39] for him to create.
[1:05:41] And when we see the same Christ,
[1:05:45] God sends himself again
[1:05:48] takes the body of flesh to perform the
[1:05:51] redemption.
[1:05:53] That's the mind that will bring the body
[1:05:55] together.
[1:05:58] Amen. So I believe that we are living
[1:06:03] in a great uniting time,
[1:06:06] a time of rededication,
[1:06:10] uniting with the full body of Christ,
[1:06:13] being ready for the rapture.
[1:06:16] This is the time we are living in.
[1:06:19] It's a uniting time.
[1:06:22] It's not a separating time.
[1:06:25] It's a time for the body to come
[1:06:26] together.
[1:06:28] Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. This is the time of
[1:06:35] the restoration.
[1:06:37] Amen. If we can go to Ezekiel 37
[1:06:42] to bring together
[1:06:44] the dry bones,
[1:06:46] the voice of the rapture
[1:06:49] spoken to those bones.
[1:06:52] Then the bones
[1:06:54] came back to norm
[1:06:57] shoulder bone
[1:06:59] the shoulders
[1:07:01] elbow
[1:07:03] elbow.
[1:07:05] Everything coming in its own place
[1:07:08] and the purpose of this message
[1:07:11] is to speak you into your position
[1:07:16] in the body.
[1:07:18] Who am I?
[1:07:21] Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Romans 12:16,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; he says, "Be of the same mind,
[1:07:30] one towards another,
[1:07:36] if you refuse,
[1:07:38] then you are not subject to the mind.
[1:07:43] But if we be subject to the mind,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; the mind is telling us
[1:07:50] we should be of the same mind.
[1:07:54] Mind not high things.
[1:07:58] But condescent to men of low estate.
[1:08:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because you're
[1:08:06] not to condescend
[1:08:09] and come down.
[1:08:12] and have fellowship
[1:08:14] with men of low esteem
[1:08:17] who also part of the body.
[1:08:20] That's what Christ does.
[1:08:23] He condescended himself
[1:08:26] came into the body of flesh
[1:08:29] and put his tent
[1:08:31] next to that one of Peter
[1:08:35] and James had a personal fellowship.
[1:08:41] That's what God wants among us.
[1:08:44] God said to men of lowest
[1:08:48] hallelujah that among us there would be
[1:08:52] no clash
[1:08:54] but to be a brother.
[1:08:58] Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; That's our desires
[1:09:03] man
[1:09:06] towards the head.
[1:09:09] Amen. So we are projecting out
[1:09:13] from the wider structure base.
[1:09:18] Amen. Because when you know the pyramid
[1:09:21] in itself,
[1:09:23] it's a very big base.
[1:09:27] But as it keeps growing,
[1:09:30] it gets narrower.
[1:09:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You throw away
[1:09:36] so many things
[1:09:39] because you are cing into the coming of
[1:09:41] the Lord.
[1:09:45] You want to drop your mind,
[1:09:48] you need to drop your pride,
[1:09:51] you need to drop the uh control,
[1:09:56] your status
[1:09:58] so that you can grow together as a
[1:10:00] church
[1:10:02] to be of the same man
[1:10:05] until we connect
[1:10:08] to the headship.
[1:10:10] Hallelujah.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the coming of the Lord.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; So to be of the same mind
[1:10:18] means that be connected
[1:10:23] to Christ individually
[1:10:27] thinking by the same word.
[1:10:30] Let this mind be you
[1:10:34] as an individual.
[1:10:36] the mind of Christ
[1:10:38] that puts down our pride,
[1:10:41] that puts down the competition,
[1:10:45] puts down the fact.
[1:10:47] If this mind is in you
[1:10:50] and the same mind is in me, we are going
[1:10:53] to have a body.
[1:10:57] Amen. Because we see nothing but Christ.
[1:11:02] Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; We must remind ourselves
[1:11:06] of how God wants to bring us into the
[1:11:09] same man.
[1:11:12] He has his order always.
[1:11:17] He has the flow of command.
[1:11:22] Because every body, every member of the
[1:11:25] body has got a special commission.
[1:11:30] Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; He has a special commission.
[1:11:34] So Christ is the headship of the church.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Failed.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; We are not our own
[1:11:47] but we are his
[1:11:50] yield to him and him alone. Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:58] So let me take you to first Corinthians
[1:12:00] here
[1:12:02] so that you may be able to understand
[1:12:04] what I mean.
[1:12:06] I'm talking about a body.
[1:12:09] Now the easiest way
[1:12:13] to recognize me
[1:12:16] is by the headship.
[1:12:19] If this head is not part of my body,
[1:12:24] who may know me?
[1:12:28] but the identity
[1:12:31] is with head.
[1:12:35] Hallelujah.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:38] This is where God
[1:12:41] has placed the mind.
[1:12:45] Upon the head is where he has put the
[1:12:48] vision.
[1:12:51] upon the head is where he has put the
[1:12:55] ear.
[1:12:57] But if God has speak
[1:13:00] I'll hear if God has to direct me.
[1:13:05] I have the vision
[1:13:07] head is very important.
[1:13:10] We need to be connected to the head
[1:13:15] because that's the flow of command
[1:13:19] in the intelligence in the mind
[1:13:24] Christ himself
[1:13:27] from the head
[1:13:29] to the body. If this part of me is cut
[1:13:35] then the mind has no connection to the
[1:13:39] body.
[1:13:42] If this part of my hand is cut off,
[1:13:46] are you together with me? If my body
[1:13:50] gets a direction
[1:13:53] from the mind that begin to run away,
[1:13:57] this part that is cut off will not
[1:14:01] respond.
[1:14:02] Is not connected to the head.
[1:14:08] Somebody say amen.
[1:14:10] Now I know you're there.
[1:14:13] So 1 Corinthians 11:3,
[1:14:17] but I would have you know
[1:14:20] that the head of every man
[1:14:23] is Christ and the head of the woman is
[1:14:27] the man and the head of Christ
[1:14:32] is God.
[1:14:34] And so for this scripture,
[1:14:37] I've always taken you back
[1:14:40] to creation
[1:14:43] that when God created,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; he made a coke and a chicken.
[1:14:54] [Laughter]
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:06] Praise the Lord. He makes a
[1:15:12] ha.
[1:15:14] That's what God used to do.
[1:15:17] But when he comes to Adam,
[1:15:20] he makes one
[1:15:23] like he was one,
[1:15:28] but yet on the inside,
[1:15:31] they had a bride
[1:15:34] that needed to be revealed
[1:15:37] after Adam had got the mind of the
[1:15:43] Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; So what God did
[1:15:46] He told Adam
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; that come over here.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Okay, Adam,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to name all these animals.
[1:15:55] And then Adam, as the animals passed
[1:15:59] through,
[1:16:01] he kept calling them by name.
[1:16:04] And for all the animals,
[1:16:07] Adam was right.
[1:16:10] Amen. And the scripture says whatever
[1:16:14] Adam called them
[1:16:18] that was the name thereof.
[1:16:22] Amen. Not that Adam named them.
[1:16:26] But Adam got into the mind of God
[1:16:31] and he was able to tell the names of the
[1:16:36] names of the reptiles,
[1:16:38] the names of the init,
[1:16:41] the names of the B.
[1:16:45] Are you together with me? So where did
[1:16:47] that understanding come?
[1:16:50] That understanding come from the head.
[1:16:55] Amen.
[1:16:56] left this mind
[1:16:59] which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:17:02] which came from the headship.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's why here he says I would have you
[1:17:10] know
[1:17:12] that the head of every man
[1:17:15] is Christ. Now the headship here
[1:17:20] is the source of information
[1:17:24] is the source of understanding
[1:17:27] is the source of intelligence.
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:30] So God puts the order here
[1:17:34] as God
[1:17:36] and the mind of God
[1:17:39] works in Christ
[1:17:42] and then the mind of Christ
[1:17:44] works in the man.
[1:17:47] And the mind of a man
[1:17:49] controls the bride.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; The bride therefore
[1:17:55] is controlled by the mind of Christ.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's why in order to say how can such
[1:18:06] a man stay alone
[1:18:09] and make him help me.
[1:18:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. because he had
[1:18:16] already got a mind
[1:18:19] that can control the world.
[1:18:22] Not his orders now.
[1:18:25] No sir, but the mind of God.
[1:18:29] Any successful marriage
[1:18:33] is guided and led by the mind of Christ.
[1:18:38] When the mind of a man comes,
[1:18:41] that marriage begins to stagger.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; So God
[1:18:50] is the spiritual mind
[1:18:54] that worked in Christ
[1:18:57] giving him humility.
[1:19:00] Let this mind be you
[1:19:03] which was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:19:06] Then this mind
[1:19:08] drives the thinking
[1:19:11] of a true husband
[1:19:13] to guide his family back.
[1:19:17] Amen. And when we say that the family
[1:19:21] has the same mind
[1:19:24] we are saying they think
[1:19:28] through the same filter
[1:19:32] of the word.
[1:19:35] Their judgment
[1:19:37] about the dressing God
[1:19:40] is the same.
[1:19:42] Not because the father
[1:19:45] push it on them, but because that's what
[1:19:48] the world say.
[1:19:53] They are connected to the headship.
[1:19:56] They connected and they got a thinking
[1:19:58] man's field.
[1:20:02] So to put the edge together,
[1:20:06] the messenger
[1:20:08] carries the mind of God
[1:20:12] and gives it to the edge.
[1:20:17] And then in the age,
[1:20:19] the local ministry
[1:20:22] had to build
[1:20:25] from the mind of the messenger
[1:20:29] to feed the local church.
[1:20:33] not to feed it with my mind,
[1:20:37] but to feed it with the mind of Christ
[1:20:41] as revealed
[1:20:43] by the message of the end.
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:47] And if we were doing that,
[1:20:50] we would not have battles in churches
[1:20:54] because we are led by the same man.
[1:20:59] Amen.
[1:21:00] We will not have battles in our
[1:21:02] families.
[1:21:04] We are led by the same man.
[1:21:07] We are subject
[1:21:10] to the same intelligence
[1:21:12] Christ.
[1:21:17] Don't feel sorry for me.
[1:21:22] You may be you may be so sympathetic to
[1:21:24] me and even fail to say amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Now Paul
[1:21:30] was the first message.
[1:21:32] This
[1:21:34] you know is very important for you.
[1:21:38] It may sound like ministerial
[1:21:44] but you see if you understand
[1:21:48] how the ministry works
[1:21:50] then you cannot be taken
[1:21:53] by a contrary ministry.
[1:21:58] You see what I mean?
[1:22:00] You are equipped.
[1:22:05] Amen. To stand
[1:22:07] in the time when a spirit tries to tear
[1:22:11] the border apart.
[1:22:15] Amen. Okay. Chapter 20 of the book of
[1:22:18] Acts.
[1:22:21] Paul is the first message.
[1:22:25] Now time comes that his ministry is
[1:22:28] done.
[1:22:31] I want to tell you friends, it doesn't
[1:22:34] matter how good a minister is.
[1:22:37] Time comes when his time is over
[1:22:43] and the time of Paul was over.
[1:22:47] But because he was concerned
[1:22:51] about what he had done,
[1:22:54] he had to prepare the people
[1:22:57] for a handover.
[1:23:03] It doesn't matter how good Moses was.
[1:23:08] Time came
[1:23:10] and his time was over.
[1:23:12] It doesn't matter how good Joshua was.
[1:23:16] to come to a time
[1:23:18] because his time was over.
[1:23:21] And Paul here, his time is over. And he
[1:23:26] went and stationed in letters
[1:23:29] and he sent to Ephesus
[1:23:32] and called all the elders of the church.
[1:23:36] What is he trying to do from God to the
[1:23:41] messenger? Now to the elders.
[1:23:45] Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; So the book of Acts chapter 20
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; and verse 27.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; For I have not shunned
[1:24:01] to declare unto you all the God.
[1:24:08] is telling these elders,
[1:24:11] I didn't hold back
[1:24:14] anything that was necessary for you.
[1:24:19] So he's now telling them, "Take what I
[1:24:23] have given you
[1:24:25] and take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:24:31] and all the flock
[1:24:33] over them which the Holy Ghost
[1:24:36] has made you overseer
[1:24:39] and feed the church of God
[1:24:42] which he has purchased with his own
[1:24:44] blood."
[1:24:46] Paul was concerned
[1:24:49] that the church must remain as a body.
[1:24:55] That's the desire of our local church
[1:25:00] and it's the desire
[1:25:02] of the smaller units of our church
[1:25:07] which are called families.
[1:25:10] Amen
[1:25:12] to have the same filter.
[1:25:16] So the elder
[1:25:18] who feeds the church to keep it in one
[1:25:22] mind
[1:25:24] is the pastor.
[1:25:29] Nobody's going to come from outside
[1:25:32] and do the work of our person.
[1:25:38] It's given to him of the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:42] If another man comes, he comes to
[1:25:45] support not to tear the body.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; So brother Brham said the elder
[1:25:56] is the highest thing
[1:26:00] in the apostolic church
[1:26:03] outside of the Holy Spirit.
[1:26:07] The Holy Spirit brings his message
[1:26:11] straight to the elder
[1:26:13] and the elder
[1:26:15] gives it to the people.
[1:26:19] Amen. Amen. So we ought to give the Holy
[1:26:21] Spirit
[1:26:23] the opportunity
[1:26:26] to use his pastor
[1:26:30] to get this whole entire church
[1:26:35] into one mind
[1:26:40] and that mind
[1:26:43] is the mind of Christ.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] So that we may all speak the same thing
[1:26:52] and that there be no divisions among us,
[1:26:56] but that we may be perfectly joined
[1:26:59] together
[1:27:02] in the same mind
[1:27:05] and in the same judgment.
[1:27:07] We are building one structure
[1:27:12] called the body of Christ.
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; So I'll try to tell you something here.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Now this is Christ
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And he came down
[1:27:33] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? He came down
[1:27:40] to pick
[1:27:42] the first church.
[1:27:44] And the first church
[1:27:47] was Ephesus.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And now when Ephesus was mature,
[1:27:53] he pulled up a little bit.
[1:27:56] Amen. to lift the standard
[1:27:59] and the overcomers
[1:28:02] were magnet was were magnetized
[1:28:06] to the headship to take the second age.
[1:28:10] Then he pulled a little bit and again
[1:28:13] magnetized
[1:28:17] to come to the third age.
[1:28:19] Have you seen now the church has been
[1:28:21] growing
[1:28:23] been growing towards Christ
[1:28:27] towards the headship.
[1:28:29] This is the headship.
[1:28:31] This is the headstone.
[1:28:34] He came down to pick up the church.
[1:28:39] And whenever he saw that they are
[1:28:42] certain overcomers,
[1:28:44] he would give them another space
[1:28:47] so that they may come up
[1:28:50] in the higher growth of the church.
[1:28:57] That's the way God works.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:29:01] Even in our local church,
[1:29:03] he's not going to keep us on the same
[1:29:05] thing.
[1:29:08] He's going to keep lifting us, lifting
[1:29:11] us, lifting us, lifting us as he builds
[1:29:17] rapturing faith in you.
[1:29:22] Okay, I'll talk about the growth of the
[1:29:26] church here. Church of a perfect man. He
[1:29:30] says, you get it?
[1:29:32] The people who died in here are
[1:29:36] depending and waiting on us.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; They are waiting for you.
[1:29:44] It is scripture.
[1:29:46] The bride has made himself ready.
[1:29:51] Are you ready?
[1:29:54] You are granted
[1:29:57] the you are granted the wedding garment.
[1:30:02] Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; So, you know, let's let's just pick it
[1:30:07] up here.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; So, this church
[1:30:11] has got to come to perfection
[1:30:17] in order to bring
[1:30:19] the resurrection.
[1:30:22] Who is holding back the rapture?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; You
[1:30:28] and me.
[1:30:34] And they are under s under the altar
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; waiting for this church
[1:30:42] to come to his perfection.
[1:30:45] But when Christ come
[1:30:48] and this church you see is coming
[1:30:53] smaller
[1:30:55] in the minority
[1:30:57] is a wall sharper.
[1:31:01] than that.
[1:31:03] Just like right that across there
[1:31:08] is come to a needle point
[1:31:16] until the church in the minority
[1:31:21] has got to get into place
[1:31:24] the same kind of a ministry
[1:31:28] that this left
[1:31:31] because this
[1:31:33] headstone
[1:31:35] comes back. It's got a little pocket
[1:31:38] like that
[1:31:41] where it's going to sit
[1:31:48] on the regular pil
[1:31:51] isn't a cup.
[1:31:53] It is not just a cup
[1:31:57] that sits across the top.
[1:32:02] is a little of lunch
[1:32:06] and it's got to sit there
[1:32:09] because it shades the water.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; The water comes from the talk
[1:32:20] washing the church.
[1:32:23] [Applause]
[1:32:24] What's the water?
[1:32:26] But the word,
[1:32:30] the washing waters
[1:32:33] of the word, they come from the headship
[1:32:37] speaking to the body.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You must be
[1:32:42] connected to the body.
[1:32:45] Don't allow you to be cut off.
[1:32:49] Even if you're a little finger.
[1:32:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:57] And when it comes this church has got to
[1:32:59] be honed.
[1:33:05] Amen. There are certain things that must
[1:33:08] be cut off.
[1:33:10] And in the cutting
[1:33:13] sometimes there is some emotion
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:18] but you have to go through it.
[1:33:21] a little pain
[1:33:24] to cut off
[1:33:26] some of our good fashions.
[1:33:29] I would have liked to show
[1:33:33] but you know that is cut off.
[1:33:36] Certain things are horn
[1:33:40] that you may fit
[1:33:42] to the nature and character of the
[1:33:46] headstone.
[1:33:49] Amen.
[1:33:50] So all these
[1:33:53] rest the stones in the pyramid
[1:33:56] align so perfect
[1:34:00] till you can't run a razor blade between
[1:34:02] them
[1:34:06] because this stone
[1:34:08] sits on this stone
[1:34:11] but it is so tight
[1:34:14] that you cannot even pass a blood
[1:34:20] that type of oneness
[1:34:24] that no spirit
[1:34:27] can be able to cut you off from God.
[1:34:32] Amen. Yeah. You've got such a harmony.
[1:34:38] You become one that when the people
[1:34:41] begin to see
[1:34:44] where do they join
[1:34:47] the
[1:34:49] you cannot see
[1:34:52] one
[1:34:54] with one another.
[1:34:57] Amen.
[1:34:58] Praise the Lord. M
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; and up here when the pyramid come
[1:35:06] does come
[1:35:09] the pyramid itself the body of Christ
[1:35:13] will have to be honed
[1:35:17] not only just some creed or doctrine
[1:35:22] or something other we can come through
[1:35:28] it will have to be so perfectly
[1:35:30] like Christ
[1:35:35] till when he comes
[1:35:37] he and that ministry
[1:35:39] will fit right together.
[1:35:43] Amen. Amen. So let us you know get so
[1:35:47] tight
[1:35:49] that we may keep away
[1:35:52] the human judgment
[1:35:55] from among ourselves.
[1:35:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; We become so tired
[1:36:04] and we are such a unity
[1:36:08] in a diversity.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; But our unity
[1:36:13] is the mind of Christ.
[1:36:17] Amen. The hand will not start saying hey
[1:36:22] my fingers alone
[1:36:25] but you
[1:36:27] short like this
[1:36:32] it was necessary.
[1:36:35] Amen. Amen. For them to be that short
[1:36:40] otherwise you would not walk.
[1:36:46] And then says
[1:36:48] But the toe
[1:36:50] the thumb
[1:36:54] it is necessary
[1:36:56] to be in that nature
[1:36:59] in that form otherwise you would do not
[1:37:02] balance.
[1:37:05] Amen. I want you to stand up practical
[1:37:09] education.
[1:37:12] I want you to walk just around where you
[1:37:14] are.
[1:37:16] walk. Tell me it's your big toe
[1:37:22] which sends you in front.
[1:37:27] That's what it is.
[1:37:29] It's your big every member is important.
[1:37:37] If you don't have a toe, big toe,
[1:37:41] you you'll walk like a duck.
[1:37:48] You can be seated.
[1:37:52] Every member of the body
[1:37:55] is very important
[1:37:57] to learn
[1:37:59] to respect one another.
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:07] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You know I have this mouth here.
[1:38:13] It feeds
[1:38:15] but after it has eaten it closes.
[1:38:21] This mouth here should do not peek on
[1:38:24] the nose.
[1:38:27] Saying nose you mean you can't close
[1:38:35] all the time you are open
[1:38:40] every member of the body.
[1:38:45] is made the way it's made
[1:38:49] to benefit the body.
[1:38:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Now listen here in the message total
[1:38:59] deliverance
[1:39:01] the prophecies. Now there is a group of
[1:39:04] offices
[1:39:06] of our church because now we are a body
[1:39:10] deacons,
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; trustees,
[1:39:14] Sunday school,
[1:39:17] pastors and our church is set in order
[1:39:24] and youth people
[1:39:26] elected these officers
[1:39:30] and this pastor.
[1:39:32] I'm just general overseer.
[1:39:36] It's going on right
[1:39:39] and to give advice
[1:39:41] and so forth. You are the one who elects
[1:39:44] your pastor.
[1:39:46] You elect your trustees.
[1:39:49] You elect your deacons.
[1:39:51] You elect every office
[1:39:54] in the church. You are the people and
[1:39:57] it's your duty
[1:39:59] to stand by those men.
[1:40:05] Huh? Mhm.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; You are responsible for them.
[1:40:09] So stand by them for they will make
[1:40:12] mistake.
[1:40:14] They are mortals.
[1:40:16] They they are just men
[1:40:19] and they'll make mistakes.
[1:40:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; So he says if the president of the
[1:40:26] United States makes a mistake,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; do we throw him away,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; we forget about it and we move on?
[1:40:35] That's the way we want to do
[1:40:38] our church now.
[1:40:43] Preaching stability,
[1:40:46] a united body.
[1:40:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:52] He says, "I was listening to him pray
[1:40:57] a few minutes ago for those deacons.
[1:41:01] I hear back there testimony at the door
[1:41:05] from the trustees
[1:41:07] how that with one accord.
[1:41:11] You all are one.
[1:41:14] Now stay that way.
[1:41:19] You members stand by this trustees,
[1:41:23] deacons and pastors.
[1:41:26] Remember when you get this together,
[1:41:30] remember it's the devil's business
[1:41:35] to see that you are broken.
[1:41:42] The gospel doesn't preach division.
[1:41:46] The gospel preaches oneness.
[1:41:51] Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; It's only the devil's business
[1:41:55] to see that you are broken.
[1:41:58] It's always been
[1:42:00] always will be
[1:42:03] stand
[1:42:05] by your officers.
[1:42:11] Okay. So let us fight our battles
[1:42:16] from the top of the mountain.
[1:42:19] We fight them in prayer.
[1:42:23] If there is anything,
[1:42:25] let us pray for one another.
[1:42:28] Amen. Don't start to blame the nose
[1:42:32] or never closing.
[1:42:34] But when you pray, you realize the nose
[1:42:38] is responsible
[1:42:40] for the life of all the other members of
[1:42:46] it. Breathe in,
[1:42:49] brothers out. If you don't understand
[1:42:52] your brother,
[1:42:54] pray for one another. Encourage one
[1:42:56] another.
[1:42:58] You have to be assured.
[1:43:01] Amen. Upon which your brother
[1:43:04] can lean and cry
[1:43:08] when he's down.
[1:43:12] Amen. So when Israel went into battle
[1:43:15] with Amalecch,
[1:43:18] God took three great men
[1:43:22] to the top of the mountain.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; And these men here were the engine of
[1:43:28] the battle.
[1:43:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They did not
[1:43:33] have a shield.
[1:43:35] They did not have a sword.
[1:43:38] But they were the engine of the battle.
[1:43:41] of men who were on the knees
[1:43:45] and their commission
[1:43:48] looked like it was very small.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; So God told them, "Come upon the
[1:43:54] mountain." And Moses, you are going to
[1:43:57] lift up your hands.
[1:43:59] Come on now. You are going to lift up
[1:44:01] your hand. And when your hands are up,
[1:44:05] Israel down will win the battle. when
[1:44:08] you put them down Israel down going to
[1:44:12] lose men
[1:44:16] and some of the people said Moses has
[1:44:21] been given and is a thing
[1:44:24] just lifting your hands like this.
[1:44:29] But when he went up there, one minute,
[1:44:33] two minutes, three minutes, four
[1:44:36] minutes, 1 minute,
[1:44:39] and the butter changed the course. And
[1:44:42] the people said
[1:44:45] it is.
[1:44:50] Let me tell you, every godgiven
[1:44:53] commission
[1:44:56] has its own triumph.
[1:45:02] Don't look at another man's part
[1:45:06] as the easy part.
[1:45:09] Pray for one another's position.
[1:45:17] Sisters,
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; don't gossip about one another.
[1:45:23] Just pray for that sister's condition.
[1:45:29] Some of you
[1:45:32] the husbands are not believers.
[1:45:35] They cannot be word corrected.
[1:45:38] Pray for such sister.
[1:45:42] And Moses was constantly challenged
[1:45:47] by the nature
[1:45:49] of the human body. It gets weak.
[1:45:54] It gets fatigued.
[1:45:57] Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And then God told
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; okay now
[1:46:02] and you okay one of you this way and one
[1:46:07] of you that way and giving us the help
[1:46:11] they also got
[1:46:18] you together with me.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; But God sometimes
[1:46:22] he knows what to do.
[1:46:25] He knows that even the ego
[1:46:29] loses his strength.
[1:46:31] Hallelujah. Praise God. So he tells a
[1:46:36] tells you go and get a stone here.
[1:46:41] Put the hands of Moses on them.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; God knows
[1:46:51] how we shall make it
[1:46:54] as a body.
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Don't start saying ah beating us Moses
[1:47:01] failing us in the next church. Even in
[1:47:06] the next church you have trouble.
[1:47:13] You must be a united body.
[1:47:19] He giveth power to the faint
[1:47:23] and to them that have no might.
[1:47:27] He increase the strength
[1:47:29] and the strength of Moses
[1:47:31] was the man that were holding his
[1:47:35] hallelujah. I want some people that will
[1:47:39] say I'm going to be the horn.
[1:47:44] In this church, the hiding of power,
[1:47:49] hold the hands
[1:47:51] of the minister that the body may be
[1:47:54] blessed.
[1:47:57] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; So, you are the strength of the
[1:47:59] ministry.
[1:48:02] You must always hold up your pastor's
[1:48:04] heart.
[1:48:07] Amen. Praise God.
[1:48:10] Yes, sir.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Let's see how we pick up from here.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Do you love him, friends?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:48:29] There are certain things that we have to
[1:48:30] fight
[1:48:33] and be able to overcome.
[1:48:36] Now,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; the body of the church
[1:48:39] is just defined like this body.
[1:48:45] Just like this body,
[1:48:48] this body
[1:48:50] gets sick.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Even if you're saved
[1:48:56] in the soul,
[1:48:58] your natural body
[1:49:01] can still get sick.
[1:49:05] Even if we are a church body
[1:49:09] baptized by the Holy Ghost,
[1:49:12] we shall always
[1:49:14] have things
[1:49:16] which challenge the church.
[1:49:20] Especially if we don't observe.
[1:49:25] Amen. The way God set up local churches,
[1:49:31] there will always be problems.
[1:49:34] Amen. Amen. Because God gave the local
[1:49:38] church
[1:49:40] sovereignity
[1:49:42] to stand by itself.
[1:49:45] Amen. But you'll find out that there
[1:49:49] will be men that come to fight for that
[1:49:52] church.
[1:49:58] That is ours.
[1:50:00] That is ours.
[1:50:03] I will not go into that.
[1:50:05] But let us look at the sickness of the
[1:50:07] body.
[1:50:09] The prophet in the message here him
[1:50:14] says the greatest need of healing
[1:50:18] tonight.
[1:50:22] And the sickest body that I know of
[1:50:27] in all the world is the body of the Lord
[1:50:30] Jesus.
[1:50:33] The church,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; he says it's the sickest body
[1:50:38] is horribly sick.
[1:50:42] It's broken up
[1:50:44] and scattered.
[1:50:46] It needs a healing.
[1:50:49] May God send the Holy Spirit
[1:50:53] in such a power.
[1:50:56] The war body of Christ
[1:50:59] will be brought together.
[1:51:02] born with love
[1:51:06] and unity.
[1:51:08] [Applause]
[1:51:10] The sickest body
[1:51:13] is not your body. It's the body of the
[1:51:17] church. And I'll take time today
[1:51:21] and speak about two diseases
[1:51:24] that affect the body of the church.
[1:51:28] Amen. Amen. just by taking a
[1:51:31] relationship
[1:51:33] with the natural body.
[1:51:36] I'll talk first about cancer.
[1:51:40] Amen. Cancer is a bruised cell.
[1:51:51] Amen. Amen. It's a bruised cell.
[1:51:55] Sometimes you knock yourself.
[1:51:57] Sometimes all those kind of but bruised
[1:52:00] cell.
[1:52:03] Amen. And then that cell
[1:52:06] begins to grow uncontrollably.
[1:52:12] Amen. And that's why you hear
[1:52:19] as distributed in the body
[1:52:22] together with so the bruised cell
[1:52:27] fails to get what I mean blood supply
[1:52:32] in that area
[1:52:34] and the reason why it grows
[1:52:36] uncontrollably
[1:52:39] is because it's trying to reach out
[1:52:41] where it can get black.
[1:52:47] But wherever it touches,
[1:52:50] it affects that cell
[1:52:53] is the spread of a cancer.
[1:52:58] Okay. So, brother Brandham calls this
[1:53:02] cell
[1:53:04] a backsliding cell.
[1:53:09] Amen. And now we are all
[1:53:12] different cells of the body of Christ.
[1:53:17] And if one cell,
[1:53:20] one member of the church
[1:53:23] comes to a spot,
[1:53:25] but he does not have a blood supply
[1:53:28] anymore.
[1:53:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That man there
[1:53:34] cannot get his correction,
[1:53:37] cannot get instruction,
[1:53:39] cannot in any case.
[1:53:42] Amen. So whether he gets connected with
[1:53:46] he infects him with his unbelief
[1:53:50] cancerous cell.
[1:53:57] Are you together with me?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it becomes a cancerous cell.
[1:54:04] And now because the only way we can get
[1:54:06] the blood
[1:54:08] is by getting the word
[1:54:11] because the word and the blood became
[1:54:15] the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There
[1:54:18] is no fountain of blood
[1:54:21] on Mount Calvary where we can go and
[1:54:24] scoop
[1:54:26] and wash you. But when we preach the
[1:54:29] word and you believe the word that
[1:54:33] becomes the blood.
[1:54:36] So if you have a man in church
[1:54:39] who does not have a blood supply,
[1:54:43] he does not accept the teaching of God.
[1:54:47] He's in the church. But contrary to the
[1:54:50] voice of the spirit,
[1:54:52] he's a backsliden cell
[1:54:57] and that's a cancerous cell.
[1:55:00] It will kill another cell
[1:55:05] body.
[1:55:07] is the body of the church.
[1:55:11] Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; In Christ,
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God revealed.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says here, "Love one
[1:55:21] another."
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Will you love me?
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Even after this service.
[1:55:31] Amen. Love one another above everything.
[1:55:36] Love one another.
[1:55:38] No matter what the devil tries to say.
[1:55:43] Now you are all one big great sweet
[1:55:46] group.
[1:55:49] But remember my warning.
[1:55:52] Satan won't let that stay that way.
[1:55:56] No sir. He will shoot everything
[1:56:01] if he has to bring somebody in.
[1:56:05] to make his target.
[1:56:08] Amen. He bring some critic
[1:56:13] or an unbeliever in
[1:56:16] and sit him down
[1:56:18] and cause him to fellowship
[1:56:21] with you under the quietness of you.
[1:56:25] And then he'll shoot that guy
[1:56:29] with some kind of a poison stuff
[1:56:33] and he'll start through the church with
[1:56:34] it.
[1:56:37] Amen. Don't you take sides with it.
[1:56:42] Don't you have nothing to do with
[1:56:44] anything else?
[1:56:48] You stay loving
[1:56:50] and sweet and kind to one another.
[1:56:54] Pray for that man that you'll be saved
[1:56:57] also
[1:56:59] for that woman. Whoever it is, just pray
[1:57:03] for them and stick one with another
[1:57:07] and stay with your pastor.
[1:57:10] The shepherd and he'll give give him
[1:57:13] respect.
[1:57:15] He'll lead you through because he's
[1:57:18] ordained of God.
[1:57:26] It doesn't have a blood washing anymore.
[1:57:32] But yet he wants relate with the people
[1:57:38] and still poison them.
[1:57:41] Have you believed what he preached?
[1:57:43] I don't believe. I don't believe a
[1:57:46] cancerous cell.
[1:57:50] So,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; let's hit the top of it.
[1:57:58] Preaching stability,
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; autoimmunity.
[1:58:07] You see autoimmunity
[1:58:11] is the infighting
[1:58:15] of body cells.
[1:58:18] You are given an immune system
[1:58:25] but it is so zealous
[1:58:30] that after it has fought the disease
[1:58:35] it even forgets
[1:58:37] and it starts eating other parts of the
[1:58:39] cell.
[1:58:43] That's the worst thing.
[1:58:47] I have medical people here.
[1:58:52] Autoimmunity.
[1:58:58] So the autoimmunity
[1:59:02] is where the
[1:59:05] the immune system
[1:59:08] becomes crazy
[1:59:11] and it begins to eat its own cells.
[1:59:17] Amen.
[1:59:19] For cancer,
[1:59:21] the body experiences a bruise.
[1:59:26] But autoimmunity
[1:59:30] becomes his own enemy.
[1:59:34] And autoimmunity is a condition
[1:59:38] where that immune system
[1:59:42] lacks discernment.
[1:59:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It cannot
[1:59:49] discern the Lord's body anymore.
[1:59:54] and it begins to damage its own cell
[1:59:59] and it also destroys
[2:00:02] the organs of the body.
[2:00:05] Can you imagine the very guard you were
[2:00:08] given to guard you?
[2:00:11] Turns around and begins to shoot at you.
[2:00:16] Your children, your wife, autoimmunity.
[2:00:23] And he says it's the sickest body of
[2:00:25] all.
[2:00:28] to autoimmunity.
[2:00:31] These doctors here say there is no
[2:00:35] medication to it.
[2:00:38] You just deal with symptoms.
[2:00:45] That's what you find. Today you are
[2:00:48] given this. Tomorrow you are given that.
[2:00:51] Tomorrow you are given this. Tomorrow
[2:00:53] you are given that. You are in this and
[2:00:56] you are in that.
[2:00:59] autoimmunity.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; The immune system
[2:01:05] mistakenly begins to attack the cells
[2:01:11] is supposed to defend
[2:01:15] using the word
[2:01:17] of a bad
[2:01:23] after he has knocked off everything.
[2:01:27] Then the same act turns over to you.
[2:01:31] That's failure
[2:01:34] to recognize
[2:01:36] or to discern the Lord's body.
[2:01:40] That's why the scripture says
[2:01:43] that for that
[2:01:45] some are sick and even die.
[2:01:51] So in the natural
[2:01:54] this autoimmunity condition
[2:01:57] dismantles the functionary of the body
[2:02:03] by the same system.
[2:02:06] God assigned it
[2:02:08] to protect the body. Amen. We were given
[2:02:12] the word to protect the body. But
[2:02:16] sometimes you find people misuse the
[2:02:20] word
[2:02:21] body.
[2:02:27] Hallelujah.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It disrupts the hormone
[2:02:31] system
[2:02:34] and imbalances them.
[2:02:38] And hormones
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; is the driving chemistry
[2:02:44] of the different things
[2:02:46] that helps the body to function.
[2:02:50] And when these hormones are disrupted,
[2:02:54] it affects the normal growth.
[2:02:59] of the body.
[2:03:02] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; It cuts off sometimes the appetite
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; and sometimes disrupts the mood of the
[2:03:12] person
[2:03:18] because there is an eternal battle.
[2:03:24] We need
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; a very stable local church.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; We need a stable
[2:03:37] body of Christ.
[2:03:41] This autoimmune condition
[2:03:46] even disrupts the flow of insulin
[2:03:51] I mean from the pancreas
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; until it causes the body to become
[2:03:56] diabetic.
[2:04:00] It disrupts
[2:04:02] the sinovia roots in this joint
[2:04:06] and it can cause even arthritis.
[2:04:18] The sickest body
[2:04:20] is the church. when they cannot be able
[2:04:25] to handle
[2:04:27] the
[2:04:30] you know defense system
[2:04:35] which is the word
[2:04:39] you know is an immune defense system
[2:04:46] becoming so overzealous
[2:04:51] and it begins to attack the very body
[2:04:53] cells
[2:04:57] that is supposed to defend.
[2:05:00] Amen. We are brethren.
[2:05:04] We cannot eat one another.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, that's the
[2:05:13] kind of preacher
[2:05:17] who is given the word.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. for the body as a defense.
[2:05:25] becomes very overzealous
[2:05:29] and throws force
[2:05:33] unrelated quotes,
[2:05:36] unrelated scripture
[2:05:39] because he's not trained
[2:05:44] in the handling of the word.
[2:05:50] And it causes a problem
[2:05:53] like it was in the in the other church.
[2:05:58] She let us
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; they were handling the world in a
[2:06:04] different way and they preached that the
[2:06:06] resurrection was passed
[2:06:10] and the scripture says some even lost
[2:06:14] their faith.
[2:06:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; We are dealing with issues
[2:06:26] that stabilizes a church
[2:06:33] so that you can be in a church
[2:06:36] and be h about it.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Is it on?
[2:06:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:50] Autoimmune condition
[2:06:53] is a very bad thing
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; where Christ
[2:06:58] seeketh preeminence
[2:07:02] among the people. But then this other
[2:07:06] side
[2:07:07] John says your traers
[2:07:12] who seek God's preeminence among you
[2:07:16] he blocks us from coming to
[2:07:20] autoimmune condition.
[2:07:25] But today
[2:07:27] we are not coming to a natural doctor
[2:07:32] but we are coming to God
[2:07:35] who has got the ability
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; to recreate.
[2:07:41] Are you together with me today? If your
[2:07:45] spiritual immune system
[2:07:49] has gone crazy,
[2:07:52] we have got a God.
[2:07:54] who cannot deal with the symptoms.
[2:07:57] But he wants
[2:08:00] to recreate
[2:08:02] the immune system
[2:08:04] that we can be able to discern
[2:08:09] the Lord's body.
[2:08:14] There must come a healing upon the way
[2:08:18] we use the word.
[2:08:21] We need not go
[2:08:30] but quote the word.
[2:08:33] Amen. Brother said that the enemy
[2:08:38] instead of quoting he
[2:08:45] did God say he begins to court.
[2:08:51] God have mercy.
[2:08:56] So the ministry
[2:08:59] needs to handle the word
[2:09:02] which we have been given
[2:09:04] in such a way that it built.
[2:09:12] So that you may be built
[2:09:16] and that even when you pick the word
[2:09:20] and you study the word, you will see the
[2:09:23] element
[2:09:26] of building you.
[2:09:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And be able to
[2:09:30] take the word of it in structure.
[2:09:36] Amen.
[2:09:38] This truth
[2:09:40] must be preached
[2:09:42] but in love.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; When you remove divine love
[2:09:51] from the message the quotes become
[2:09:55] stones.
[2:09:58] You are not helping.
[2:10:01] You are trying to hit on the head. We
[2:10:04] are here to heal. Amen.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Every minister
[2:10:09] is here
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; to heal.
[2:10:15] Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; So we must preach, we must preach the
[2:10:19] truth in love,
[2:10:22] knowing that it's God
[2:10:25] and God alone who holds the lamb's book
[2:10:28] of life.
[2:10:31] Are you together with me? There are find
[2:10:34] some people they take this book and the
[2:10:38] best they can do is remove you from the
[2:10:41] book. They put you in the book.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Do you love him this afternoon?
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; My name is not put in the book in time.
[2:11:03] It was put in the book
[2:11:06] before the foundation of the world.
[2:11:09] Amen.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; To such a way that no man can remove it
[2:11:13] from the world.
[2:11:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want tell you
[2:11:19] that the blood is available
[2:11:22] for every condition
[2:11:25] you go through. The blood is here to
[2:11:27] heal.
[2:11:29] Not like somebody's
[2:11:31] the only one who has got a cup to give
[2:11:35] you a little gift.
[2:11:40] We thank God
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; for the way the word is handled here
[2:11:45] [Applause]
[2:11:48] and just hold it
[2:11:50] that which you have hold
[2:11:53] and let it become healer.
[2:11:57] It was given to us.
[2:11:59] for fortification
[2:12:02] and not for a hammer
[2:12:06] to bring cancer bruises.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something.
[2:12:17] Look at Timothy.
[2:12:19] The five-fold ministry
[2:12:22] is ordained of God.
[2:12:25] But
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; these gifts
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; grow I mean grow
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; they are given of God
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; but they grow
[2:12:40] most of the problems we have
[2:12:44] is the people who have been given gifts
[2:12:49] but they don't wait for the growth
[2:12:53] and they go ahead.
[2:12:55] When Moses was given a gift,
[2:12:59] it devolved for 40 years
[2:13:03] before Moses went to the field.
[2:13:07] When Elisha followed Elijah
[2:13:12] for eight solid years,
[2:13:16] it took him another 10 years
[2:13:20] to fit in the mount of Elijah.
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:25] But before that,
[2:13:27] he was performing signs
[2:13:30] and wonder.
[2:13:32] But at that time, he couldn't even
[2:13:35] control his temper.
[2:13:38] And he caused the foxes
[2:13:42] fields and
[2:13:45] I mean killed I mean ate these young
[2:13:48] kids.
[2:13:51] Elisha had hard to grow feet in the
[2:13:55] rope.
[2:13:58] Brother Brham says today we are trying
[2:14:01] to cut the rope
[2:14:08] cut it.
[2:14:10] They don't have the patience
[2:14:13] to wait and grow into the size of the
[2:14:18] mountain.
[2:14:22] The spirit of Elijah was upon him
[2:14:25] and in a double portion
[2:14:29] but he needed to grow
[2:14:32] in that anointing.
[2:14:36] Amen.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Look at first Timothy
[2:14:39] chapter 4.
[2:14:42] Do you love him French?
[2:14:45] Do you love Bible teaching?
[2:14:47] is a little more apostolic here
[2:14:52] to build, you know, but you need it.
[2:14:58] 1 Timothy chapter 4.
[2:15:01] Look at Timothy here.
[2:15:04] pauses
[2:15:06] till I come
[2:15:09] give a tendency to reading
[2:15:13] to exaltation
[2:15:16] to doctrine.
[2:15:20] He's telling a man
[2:15:23] who had a gift
[2:15:25] and he was a minister.
[2:15:28] But he says give attest to reading
[2:15:34] to exaltation
[2:15:37] to doctrine.
[2:15:39] Neglect not the gift
[2:15:44] that's in thee
[2:15:46] which was given thee by prophecy.
[2:15:50] [Applause]
[2:15:51] with the laying on of the hands of the
[2:15:54] priest betrayed.
[2:15:58] The gift was in there.
[2:16:01] Timothy
[2:16:03] don't neglect that gift.
[2:16:09] Amen. Feed it with the word.
[2:16:15] Amen. and verse 15. Meditate upon this
[2:16:19] thing.
[2:16:22] We give thyself holy to them
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; that thy propheting
[2:16:30] may appear to all.
[2:16:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are given a
[2:16:36] gift. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; You are blessed.
[2:16:41] But then feed it by study.
[2:16:45] Meditate
[2:16:47] on doctrine
[2:16:48] that your prostit
[2:16:52] may appear to all
[2:16:55] [Applause]
[2:16:56] that when you stand
[2:16:59] you can be able to bless the church
[2:17:04] so that you cannot again
[2:17:07] take the fortification.
[2:17:10] fortification
[2:17:14] to destroy the people.
[2:17:18] This is supposed to be their immune
[2:17:20] system.
[2:17:24] The why
[2:17:26] so use it very well
[2:17:29] that your ministry
[2:17:31] will not become an autoimmune condition.
[2:17:39] Take heed unto thyself,
[2:17:42] unto the doctrine,
[2:17:45] continuing them.
[2:17:47] For in doing this, thou shalt both save
[2:17:50] thyself
[2:17:53] and those that hear you.
[2:17:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You saved
[2:17:59] yourself
[2:18:01] and those who hear you.
[2:18:03] [Applause]
[2:18:04] Meaning that a ministry
[2:18:08] much as is given of God
[2:18:11] if it's not natural
[2:18:14] to stabilize and grow.
[2:18:17] It can destroy you and destroy those.
[2:18:22] [Applause]
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Most of the ministers
[2:18:30] are victims of the immune condition.
[2:18:33] condition.
[2:18:36] Those are men
[2:18:38] sometimes
[2:18:40] who don't link to God
[2:18:43] to hear from God,
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; but they are transmitters.
[2:18:49] They get from here, put here, here, put
[2:18:54] here. But Paul says, "Study
[2:18:59] and meditate on these things.
[2:19:05] begin to go through them
[2:19:08] and see that you get profitable
[2:19:11] conclusion
[2:19:14] that will benefit the church.
[2:19:18] A God called man
[2:19:20] must have the ability
[2:19:23] to use the sword
[2:19:25] with his own arm of faith.
[2:19:32] Let's go. Second Corinthians.
[2:19:35] I'm finishing soon.
[2:19:38] Amen. Amen.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; The advice
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; to the ministers.
[2:19:46] He says,
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; "For we in 2 Corinthians 10:12,
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; for we dare not make ourselves
[2:19:58] of the number
[2:20:04] or compare ourselves with some that
[2:20:06] commend themselves.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; For they measuring themselves by
[2:20:19] themselves and comparing themselves
[2:20:22] among themselves are not wise.
[2:20:40] the spirit of competition.
[2:20:44] I'm better than that one. I'm better
[2:20:47] than that one. I'm better than the other
[2:20:49] one. Christ is our standard.
[2:20:54] He says when they come to comparing
[2:20:57] among themselves,
[2:20:59] he says they are not wise.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 13,
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; but we
[2:21:08] will not boast
[2:21:11] of things without our measure.
[2:21:15] Brother Wilson,
[2:21:17] we cannot boast
[2:21:19] of things
[2:21:21] without our measure.
[2:21:24] But according to the measure of the rule
[2:21:26] which God has disputed to us
[2:21:36] a measure to reach even unto you.
[2:21:41] Praise the Lord. What is Paul saying
[2:21:44] here?
[2:21:46] God
[2:21:47] distributes a measure.
[2:21:51] Amen. to the minister
[2:21:53] and that measure is supposed to be given
[2:21:57] to him to suffice the people speaking
[2:22:00] among
[2:22:03] [Applause]
[2:22:05] not just go and scoop it
[2:22:09] and then you begin to throw to the
[2:22:10] people scoop it to the people the
[2:22:15] minister has got
[2:22:18] to hear from
[2:22:20] [Applause]
[2:22:22] And he has such a level
[2:22:26] that can bless the people.
[2:22:29] Amen. Paul says that no minister
[2:22:34] should burst on stolen waters.
[2:22:38] Amen. The book of proverbs says stolen
[2:22:42] waters are sweet.
[2:22:47] is what God has directly given you
[2:22:52] which turns into blessing for your
[2:22:55] audience.
[2:23:00] Verse 14.
[2:23:02] Amen.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; For we stretch not ourselves
[2:23:07] beyond our measure.
[2:23:14] We don't lift ourselves up.
[2:23:18] to go beyond what God has given us.
[2:23:23] We walk in that measure
[2:23:27] and we begin to bless you in that
[2:23:29] measure
[2:23:31] and also begin to grow in that measure.
[2:23:35] What you take doesn't harm you, but what
[2:23:38] you take, it grooms you
[2:23:43] and enables you
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; to understand what you are in the body
[2:23:49] of Christ.
[2:23:51] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:24:00] Verse 14.
[2:24:04] as though we reach out unto you.
[2:24:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:24:11] Paul says
[2:24:13] that I
[2:24:15] don't try
[2:24:19] to draw things from far away
[2:24:23] so that I bring to you
[2:24:27] that like as if what I have is not
[2:24:29] enough for you.
[2:24:33] He gives us what he gives us and we give
[2:24:35] it to you and you take them and they
[2:24:38] become life to you. In that way
[2:24:43] we will not kill other cells.
[2:24:51] We don't just go
[2:24:54] but you keep your measure.
[2:24:59] And even when God places you in the
[2:25:01] church,
[2:25:02] you be stable there.
[2:25:06] That's where the measure that God has
[2:25:08] for you is.
[2:25:11] That's where the measure that will groom
[2:25:12] you is. Hallelujah.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your lane.
[2:25:19] Verse 15.
[2:25:20] Not boasting of things
[2:25:23] without our measure.
[2:25:26] that is other men's labors.
[2:25:31] But having hope
[2:25:34] when your faith is increased
[2:25:37] that you shall be enlarged
[2:25:40] by you according to our rule abundantly.
[2:25:47] Hallelujah. Amen. He says that we cannot
[2:25:49] boast
[2:25:51] in other man's labors.
[2:25:54] God gives us what you need
[2:25:59] measure.
[2:26:00] As you take it and feed on it, we are
[2:26:04] going to grow by it and together we are
[2:26:08] going to rejoice in the Lord.
[2:26:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So don't become
[2:26:14] another man's message.
[2:26:17] So let me finish on this note.
[2:26:20] Amen. Amen. Praise God. I love the Lord
[2:26:24] this afternoon.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm just preaching stability
[2:26:32] autoimmunity.
[2:26:35] Amen. So
[2:26:38] occupied the office of the king
[2:26:42] but without a divine.
[2:26:46] He was a people's choice
[2:26:50] of a king but not God's choice.
[2:26:54] He failed
[2:26:56] because that was not his call.
[2:27:02] He went into battle with David
[2:27:05] and as a king.
[2:27:07] He did not understand
[2:27:10] what submission
[2:27:14] in his office
[2:27:16] was.
[2:27:18] He was given commission on battlefields.
[2:27:23] He would do different things.
[2:27:25] God threw him out.
[2:27:28] And the worst of it
[2:27:32] is that he did not merit as a king.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was he did not merit
[2:27:47] because as the king of Israel
[2:27:50] as king of Israel
[2:27:53] he was supposed to be a judge
[2:27:58] and the defense of the people.
[2:28:01] [Applause]
[2:28:04] But Saul
[2:28:06] when the time came
[2:28:08] proof that he was the defense of the
[2:28:11] people
[2:28:13] he panicked
[2:28:18] and then David came forth
[2:28:20] and he said who is this uncircumcised
[2:28:24] little
[2:28:26] who is making the Lord's people to panic
[2:28:31] be distracted.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; He was a balanced
[2:28:41] immune
[2:28:42] defense system for the people.
[2:28:47] [Applause]
[2:28:49] He knew what to do.
[2:28:52] He was able to understand who the enemy
[2:28:54] was.
[2:28:58] And when David stepped forward, he
[2:29:02] brought down Goras.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; But then Saul,
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; he was an otter.
[2:29:16] He started hunting for devil.
[2:29:20] And we see a lot of that
[2:29:23] people out there in the field,
[2:29:26] they are just autoimmune situations,
[2:29:31] they are hunters
[2:29:33] over their own brothers.
[2:29:39] And finally, Saul
[2:29:41] because he did not understand
[2:29:44] how to handle the world,
[2:29:47] he fell.
[2:29:50] on his own sword
[2:29:54] and it killed him.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; This world
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; is a giver
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; of life.
[2:30:02] [Applause]
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; But
[2:30:07] it must be handled
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; by a man
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; who has been trained
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit.
[2:30:17] Amen.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; It has life.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; There was no need
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; for Saul to fall
[2:30:28] on his own sword.
[2:30:32] Not that he was not God's child.
[2:30:36] He was
[2:30:38] because even after he died,
[2:30:40] he was a pioner.
[2:30:44] Amen.
[2:30:46] Amen. He went home.
[2:30:49] There are so many people that are
[2:30:52] falling
[2:30:54] on their own.
[2:30:56] Tell your brother this word here is the
[2:31:00] gift of life.
[2:31:04] Study it. So Paul
[2:31:08] finally gives Timothy
[2:31:12] and he gives him the advice
[2:31:16] in 2 Timothy 2:15
[2:31:20] day.
[2:31:22] Show yourself approved
[2:31:26] unto God, a workman
[2:31:29] that needeth not be ashamed,
[2:31:34] rightly dividing the word of truth.
[2:31:41] You split the middle
[2:31:45] that you don't let the word kill the
[2:31:47] people.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; The word gives life. The word is our
[2:31:52] defense
[2:31:54] and must be used
[2:31:56] to give the body life.
[2:31:59] When you get into this world,
[2:32:03] be sure that you are under that mind.
[2:32:08] You are under that intelligence.
[2:32:11] God will use this word
[2:32:13] to establish you, to bless you, to
[2:32:17] prosper you, to heal you, to keep
[2:32:21] yourself
[2:32:23] the center
[2:32:25] of the glory and presence of God.
[2:32:30] God bless you.
[2:32:36] Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[2:32:40] Do you love him?
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; We thank God for our past.

[2:33:57] heard the word. Bless their souls, Lord.
[2:34:01] as they begin to relate to the word.

[2:34:07] word
[2:34:09] the word may constantly release life at
[2:34:12] them

[2:51:59] And most of these before us,
[2:52:04] their third term,
[2:52:07] others have already gone.
[2:52:10] But we pray for them as they go for
[2:52:13] their final term this year.
[2:52:18] Give them wisdom.
[2:52:20] God may give them good health
[2:52:23] and they can be able to finish their
[2:52:25] studies well
[2:52:28] and go to the next level.
[2:52:32] The reason why we go to school
[2:52:35] is that you may learn
[2:52:37] to dress the land
[2:52:40] [Music]
[2:52:42] because that was part of the work
[2:52:45] in Genesis 2.
[2:52:48] He made a spirit man to worship him.
[2:52:54] Genesis chapter 2, he made a human mind,
[2:52:57] a human, a natural man to keep the land.
[2:53:05] Education is one of the ways to to dress
[2:53:08] the land.
[2:53:11] Where you get the skills.
[2:53:15] Let us pray.
[2:53:16] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:53:18] Christ,

[2:53:41] six
[2:53:44] different categories of institutions
[2:53:49] we dedicate all of them together.

[2:54:34] spirits around
[2:54:36] that go about burning schools,

[2:54:52] all their classrooms,
