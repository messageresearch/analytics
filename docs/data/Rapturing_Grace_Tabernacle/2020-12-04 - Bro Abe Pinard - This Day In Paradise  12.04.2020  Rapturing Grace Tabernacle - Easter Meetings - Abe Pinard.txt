our hearts begin to worship we will be blessed because we care we will be blessed because we came I greet you in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ real privilege to be with you on this Easter weekend of course the Easter weekend I believe the most important remembrance of the Christian calendar if we can call it that it's our victory weekend is the weekend of our testimony of what God has done for us and it's a celebration from beginning to end from Calvary though we remember that with not as a sad occasion because we know that the victory was won there for us so we thank God for Calvary we thank God for the work that he did during that Sabbath and of course we thank God for the resurrection that Easter Sunday which is our victory day and paved the way for us to be part of that kingdom of God that is everlasting eternal cannot fade cannot be done away with so we thank the Lord for this occasion we have and we want to greet you and just encourage you during this time I know it seems to be stressful to me it's not really a stressful time it's a time to get the anchors down as a time to get settled down to make sure that what the Lord has for us has been thoroughly absorbed as the Bible speaks about eating the book this is certainly a time to eat that book so we thank the Lord for that for those who are still in the workplace or doing essential services or in the medical field and so forth we want to remember you during this time as well and we we thank God that you know that there's a still an open door for us to gather even in this fashion we don't know if this will carry on till the rapture but you know as we have the opportunity and so we thank the Lord for that we're gonna go straight into the scripture we want to read from Luke chapter 23 it just seems to be a small episode recorded in the three Gospels in two of the Gospels only one verse and in Luke we read a bit more about it Luke 23 will read from verse 42 and our title is this day in paradise you know what we're talking about you can see the picture there this to me is one of the most incredible portions of the scripture and really includes every single one of us Luke chapter 23 I'm going to read verse 42 and 43 before we do that let's just close our eyes and ask the Lord's blessing Heavenly Father Lord we are so dependent upon you today realizing recognizing Lord that the world is in a turmoil it is in an upheaval there's a handwriting on the wall so to speak oh god of the coming oncoming storms of judgment and so we're glad Lord for a refuge we're glad for a safe place we're glad Lord and we can find ourselves in your embrace Lord in your care in your kingdom sealed in there and Lord God this day is we will look at these scriptures and a few things the prophets said Lord we ask your special blessing upon it may every heart adheres may every heart at his fellowshipping together with us may they feel the anointing of God may they recognize your presence may they draw close to you the Lord will you touch every heart for your glory and honor as we ask it in Jesus name Amen hallelujah we praise God for his wonderful mercy and His grace Luke chapter 23 with just read through of the verses 42 and 43 and he said that's now the thief on the cross he said unto Jesus Lord remember me we're now come into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise today thou shalt be shalt thou be with me in paradise now a man's nature as the prophet taught us it's just is known by his expression what he expresses what he lives out what he what he not just necessarily what he says but what he his attitude the things he expresses that makes it makes known what the man's nature is God God's attributes and character for example is declared in Christ the scripture tells us he brew one verse three says who being the brightness of his glory that's Jesus now being the brightness of God's glory and the Express image of his person we know who God is we know how God is because of Jesus Christ before that thing you could talk about a pillar of fire and earthquakes and all kinds of rumblings and things and dealings with man through the prophets and the law and so forth but once Jesus came on the scene that was the Express image of God's person in John 1:18 the Bible tells us no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him and I love that which is in the bosom of the Father what is in the bosom is the heart and that heart desire of God that the heart purpose of God was declared in Jesus Christ that's what brother Brown talks about in the church age book when he uses that exact phrase he's talking about the heart purpose of God he says the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world God had a heart purpose and that was to take a bride of his own choosing we find quite a picture here represented on Good Friday by a mystery at the very seat at the very place of redemption a nameless man known only by his worst deeds there's no good testimony about this man at all the Bible calls him a malefactor that's it that's all we know about him nothing about where he comes from we don't even know he was a Jew or a Gentile we know nothing about him all we know about him is that he was on the wrong side of the law to such a degree that they were going to put him to death in the worst way possible he wasn't just a common little thief and the wrong nature had driven him his entire life making him to end up at that place at that time his whole entire life we could say was wasted a wasted life at no time to live for God this was the last hours of that existence he was going to be on earth there was nothing of value that you could look at and say there's some redemptive attribute some redeemable quality in this man's life that you could say well there's at least some hope there was no hope at all not the slightest thirst for God in this man the Prophet tells us that I'll read the quote in a few minutes I wrote it here read it here awhile ago where where brother banner talks about it he didn't have not did not have a thirst for God you remember he was also revealing at the at the start initially he was also criticizing was also mocking he was also joining in the in the what the crowd was doing what what his fellow fellow malefactor was doing what the priests were doing what the Romans were doing he was joining in in that and here was the last hours of his worthless misspent utterly selfish shameful existence has finally arrived you could almost say like people who go to watch these watch these death sentences carried out they were glad they didn't feel anything that worthless human being in there he deserved what he got and now that he's out of existence everybody is the world's a better place well you could almost say the same thing about this man the world would be a better place with him out of the way yet underneath all of that was a seed of God hard to imagine that's why I call it a mystery because this man's life contained a seed of God an eternal attribute of the Living God a thought of God that could never did never come into existence was always there could not be altered could not fade away could not be rejected could not be changed in any fashion this was God's eternal thought there was on that cross on Calvary's Hill and the amazing thing of course is we know that there's not a what step in the life of a son or daughter of God that is out of place God ordains every footstep even ordained for for for a Jonah to run the other way why because he had a fish already prepared because he was supposed to arrive in Nineveh in a fish and not in a ship or not on foot he was supposed to arrive there in a fish so even even though Azure or Jonah's stumbling and falling and running away and backsliding was in God's purpose and here we had an entire life that was lived in vain you could say but that life was planned beforehand and it was supposed to end up on Calvary's Hill it was supposed to end up with his sacrifice right there God had planned that life their names were written together in God's book brother Branham says when God brought the Lamb's Book of Life he wrote Jesus Christ the Lamb of God right at the top and then he wrote every name we would ever be associated with that sacrifice under there so there's that special chapter and this man's name was written there and to such a degree well we don't know his name today but his name's written there one who did nothing but evil his entire life right next to one who did nothing but good his entire life one to go to hell so both may meet in paradise and that is the Marvel for me God had written his life story and today we have it eternal in the word included in God's Word it will never pass away even though heavens and earth will there was a world a picture around them was a world much like today you could say where everything was hanging in the balance a tremendous hour the greatest hour the world would see of the hour of redemption the hour the price would be paid for what happened in Eden and everything would be undone that that had come through the fall now God desired a representative of Adam's race right there and say wasn't Mary enough wasn't John enough he had somebody right there who we would only turn down somebody who was just no good had no redeemable quality it seemed a nameless and I'm glad he was nameless because that means he could be anybody and he could be everybody he could be me in fact I believe I was definitely represented there God picked a representative for redemption and in his pain you know what it was an agony there you couldn't think somebody could make a decision even or think rationally the pain becomes so intense that you you lose control of your thinking of your ability to your three reason and and and make decisions and think things through the pain is just becomes unbearable and in that in that agony in that moment it was hopeless also remember he didn't have a way out this wasn't the punishment it was temporal and he was gonna walk away from there this was the end of his life he was not going to recover from this things will only get worse and once he died he had no hope of heaven he had no hope of redemption it was just darkness that was waiting for him and condemnation so it was a hopeless agony a terrible terrible place to be right in that moment in that condition the veil was lifted for him now you could talk about the power of Revelation when God unveiled something because from one moment to the next something happened because at one time he was mocking at one time he was cursing at one time he couldn't see who this was next to him but something happened there what changed his mind you could wonder what was it he didn't hear a sermon all he heard was the false accusations if thou be the Son of God he saw the frailty of a dying man that's all he saw he saw the hate he saw the rejection what changed his mind well we could speculate perhaps just to look just to look an expression on the face maybe perhaps the words of forgiveness that he heard Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing maybe something touched him when you those words perhaps the silent agony not revealing not cursing like they were not shouting not expressing anything but something from eternity was reflected there something caught his attention a gene of God we know on the inside of him a spark there was buried so deep that his entire life was lived in a state where that where that spark was smothered and he was living in disgrace but an attribute that shout at before there was the world was in him an attribute that had rejoiced at the very plan unfolding on the hill that day that had seen it before there was a world and shouted for joy and sung the songs of heaven at the sight of Redeemer and the great love of God that would buy us back that spark that amnezia suddenly lifted and he must have recognized right there because he called him Lord he recognized him faultless he recognized him without mistake and he started testifying and started telling the other malefactor there why are you doing this he did nothing we deserve what we got don't you fear god what a thing to say what changed his opinion so quickly what made him recognize that this was God Himself the Redeemer the Messiah the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world on Calvary's Hill something happened now God's Way out God's Way of Revelation is not the way of carnal attraction or power or strength there's something behind the scenes behind the veil that attracts seeing it attracts the believer as the Bible said he had no beauty that we should desire me there was no outward show that we could think this was the Messiah this must be the Messiah he has the endorsement of all the societies in the churches he must be some important person some respected somebody so there was another sight there was another look there was another unveiling that took place there that caught this man's attention and we find even the Holy Ghost the Bible calls it a stumbling block in other words it comes in a way that it offends people here's a little quote from persevering brother Brennan says and the very thing that killed the unbelieving world saved Noah he was talking of course about the judgment the flood because that's the same as it is today now watch what he's going to say next the stumbling block the Holy Spirit that's making the world where they don't want it making the world where they don't want it my goodness maybe you never thought of that the same God who was your soul the same God and knocks on your door is making it so the world don't want it it will spoil their parties it'll spoil their fun it will interrupt their programs it will cause all sorts of discomfort and condemnation and what more they don't want it but it's the Holy Spirit that does it so the Holy Spirit comes in a way remember when if when the disciples asked Jesus why do you speak to them in parables he said so that they won't understand Wow the God of mercy the God of grace God the Redeemer speaks to mankind so they won't understand and when he sends the Holy Ghost it comes like they won't don't want to receive it but there it is so what made that man want to receive it since the things that they are turning down is the very thing that will take the church up the Holy Spirit will take the church in the rapture but for this man there was no more time he'd run out of time he could not live a life for God now he could not have a testimony for God there was no time for repentance there was no time for restitution for making things right all the things that he stole all the people that he robbed all the hurt that he caused no time to make that right he could not give a promise to do better he's run out of time he could not devote himself to God he could not even have faith he was just there dying and and living out his last few minutes in this world what did he see in the Old Testament we read about the brass serpent and we know that that was a foreshadow of Christ that was sin judged and right there that brass serpent being raised up what did it cause just to look just to look brought healing to a deathly illness a deathly poison that was raging through the camp and one look at that serpent a look of faith would change that person's sickness into health again but that person would die again but here this one sacrifice the Bible says perfects forever not only preserves life not only saves life but perfects forever by one sacrifice that's what he was looking at and if God lifted the veil and suddenly he saw this was God the Redeemer I am reminded of a rich young ruler who also looked I wonder what he saw he saw a teacher he saw a wise man he saw somebody that there was an attraction there too but he was too rich in this cursed life whereas that poor man on the cross had lost absolutely everything had been stripped of everything and is now going to be stripped of his life also publically dying in shame nothing left for him but mercy nothing left for him but mercy I believe this is the Easter story for me that's exactly all of us bundled together and what what came out of that man is the most sublime thing you know what is just a cry there was just a cry coming from his heart just one line one line remember me Lord remember me Lord how could he forget him how could he forget that one when he had ordered all the footsteps of his life to end up on that hill on that cross next to him he had caused him it opened doors and closed doors and organize things and turned friends and family maybe against him or brats or circumstances in his life that he couldn't overcome why because he wanted him on that cross he had already written his story before there was the world how could he forget him when that man said remember me he had remembered him all of his life he'd remembered every footstep he took he wrote that unknown name in his Lamb's Book of Life how can he forget him when the Bible tells us his his name had been engraved on his hands by that Roman iron pen when he longed and waited for that expression of his great love and redemption planned before the world was he was waiting for that cry for mercy he was waiting because he knew it was coming he knew him before there was the world and he knew he was going to do that when he appointed him he ordained him as a representative of all a fallen man to die and live there next to him because we can see we can't just say that's a moment of death because it wasn't what we witness is a moment of life a birth right there on the cross of a man who was condemned to death and had no reason even to be alive no redeeming quality to him but there was a birth taking place there was a life going to be expressed this man's life you know what the very existence of that man the very existence of that man was locked up inside of him who he was was inside of Christ right there on that tree waiting for that cry to be expressed in words to speak it out with that voice of creation the thought concerning him he was waiting for that cry he could not he was I I wonder you know amidst all the agony and all the blood and all the the pain and all the sudden it was coming upon him and crushing is very being separated in the water in the blood all amidst all that incredible suffering he was waiting for those words remember me why cuz he had a line he had a word he had something to reply he had something to say and he knew we know his words are creative his words create things his words can change his words can translate his words can can can transform and he was waiting to say the real truth about this man's life everything up to that point had been a lie everything had been in vain everything was for nothing but here he was gonna place him right there and said this day this day you will be with me in paradise he placed him right there in paradise why because there was a little cry from his heart what a merciful God now remember God is expressed through Christ this is God this is God's heart towards anybody who has the slightest desire towards him how can he possibly turn anybody down who has that desire and his word he says whosoever will let him come and I will he no wise cast him out what happened he was recognized right there recognized as a son of God recognized he was placed he was redeemed he was forgiven justified liberated lifted up into the heavenlies remember where did he place him not on the hill lifted up on a cross he placed him in paradise that very same day say you will be with me in paradise and we know he could not go back to paradise and that's not where he came from so he placed him right back he's in his original condition that's why we can say redeemed redeemed brought back to his ought to be condition we're on a cross in agony in the last hours of his life in utter shame and defeat what a picture how sure men as that is transported in a moment in a moment by God's voice God's voice that is creative God's voice that said peace be still God's voice that said let there be light remember the worlds were created by Jesus Christ as the Bible tells us and the very same creative voice was on that cross knocks next to that sinner next to that thief and could speak to him bring to him the reality of what he had in his mind before there was a world and he did it by speaking his word a deep that unknown desire he had smothered in his whole life he'd had that desire didn't recognize it that but suddenly something happened in the cry came out of his mouth Lord remember me and he was transported from a sin cursed misery to heavenly places in a moment when he opened his eyes next he was in paradise when he opened his eyes he was in paradise when God opens yours it's the same you might say well I'm still in Laodicea I'm still in a sin cursed body I'm still in this old pest house I still have heartaches and disappointments and wrong desires and all kinds of mistakes when you open your spiritual eyes you'll really recognize where you are you are in paradise the voice of God on the earth then that spoke as I mentioned they remember and the Old Testament the prophets said thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord this one said I say unto you I say unto you this is very God in flesh the very same one rejected for religious tradition that's exactly what put him on the cross it wasn't politics it was religious tradition that put him on the cross and that religious tradition we know always results in a whited Sepulcher as he called it why does Sepulcher an outward appearance hiding carnal motives and that can happen in any and any phase in any age and I think we are not immune to it people trying to live a message life and they don't really have the motives for it just an outward appearance a message culture a lifestyle but echoing through the ages I believe God that same voice that same voice that spoke that day on the on Calvary that same voice echoed through the ages through these messengers these stars to reach into the darkest age that were ever that will ever be and we are in it the worst age the voice of God still calling still echoing the voice of God and that grace sufficient what is it bringing to you it speaks the same thing it did for him it's still lifting the veil it's calling it's calling and searching to find these offenders these malefactors and the highways and the hedges in the slums of the world and here we are if there's a cry in your heart it's something happened to you when you first heard those words something spoke to your heart and you couldn't quite understand what it was but a cry went out from you Lord remember me that's what Easter is to every believer the voice of Resurrection coming to you the voice of life the voice that transplants you from this old world from this carnal nature and puts you in paradise my cry is heard in layered Asiya yes where we have a rejected truth once again a crucified word but that Eagle scream was meant for me it was meant for me and for you know all the people on the on that hill that day all the witnesses there I believe there was one big beneficiary although all mankind of course we benefit from that sacrifice there was somebody there directly at that moment who recognized his life was not in vain God had mercy on him God lifted the veil for him God's voice was beckoning him come up higher you know and I think that's exactly what happened in the church ages as we find that seed going into the ground God progressively bringing from one stage to another bringing from from one place to another from one revelation one unfolding to another ever higher and higher to where we are now and right here in present stage of my ministry 62 brother Branham says but now if that little fish could care ever come up here and be me would he ever want to be their little fish again down in that midnight blackness he'd never wanted to be a fish no more because he's something greater than a fish he's a man he senses our greater his understanding is greater his intelligence is supreme just multiply that by 10 million then you get what it is when you pass from this into the presence of God yonder where the human being is so much further than what we are here you'd never want to be a human being like this no more down in this pest house of sickness and corruption it's been that in my heart and I've tried these 30 years to preach the gospel around the world to tell people that there is a heaven to gain and there's a hell to shun listen there's a God that loves you a God that loves you a redeeming power that's laying ready to pick you up at any time that you're ready to receive it if we can't see that in the thief on the cross if we can't see that in that man's life the moment he was ready to have that little cry towards God if God does not change and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then he has to react the same way today if you have a cry in your heart if you have a hunger and the need in your heart and if you could cry Lord remember me wouldn't he act the same way wouldn't he say the same words to you what made that man qualify for mercy just sin just a hopeless worthless life there's nobody that stands in the front of the line when it comes to mercy it's all of us that's why I thank God he didn't have a name because I can put me I could put myself there certainly I can say Lord remember me Lord remember me in my condition and I'm not just talking physically because this old body will get sick again and die so as much as we you desire divine healing and we certainly appreciate it you know that's not the kind of healing we ought to be looking for at this time as although we still pray for it and we still confess it but there's a healing of the soul because the rapture is upon us that final coming together is upon us that's final lifting up and I believe as we read this little quote it says the redeeming power that's laying ready laying ready he's not gonna prepare it when you ask him it's already laying there ready to what pick you up at any time that you are ready to receive it brother that thief on the cross proved it to us she's like a man drowning there's a rope hanging there and he thinks well the rope I could pull myself out but I'm not worthy to get the rope since the Rope was put there for that very purpose for you to pull yourself out there since that's the reason Jesus Christ died for the purpose of saving sinners and he dangled the robe of eternal life which this very night will pass over every sinner's head in here if you just heard this or if you've listened to this tape or you just casually perhaps sitting listening in today it's passing over your head right now passing over your head what a rope of eternal life and not just casually watch it says and a welcome sign hanging on it a welcome sign hanging on it it's for you if there's a tug in your heart if there's the slightest desire to go in the rapture if there's a slightest desire to be like Christ there is a Christ here that's doing that drawing that's what it means to have that desire pretty soon it'll be over not a single person will desire Christ any more oh they will he met they will they will desire their imaginings they will desire their form and their tradition and their loyalties and their ministers and their Pope's and bishops they'll desire that but not Christ Christ is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost wrote the word you've got some other kind of a ghost if you can't agree with the Word of God so there's a welcome sign hanging on what does it say come up out of it come up out of depression come up out of any situation you're in there's a way out there's a rope there's a there's a I believe a an Easter for you and a welcome mat from God and power to raise you up says if you wish to do it the preparation is made the preparation is made now I can tell you that goes for every situation in life there's nothing we have to put up with from the devil no sir because he is defeated he was defeated and that proof of that resurrection we carry within ourselves today now Jesus God came from the celestial down to the terrestrial from heaven to earth why to lift earth back to heaven to lift that Sun cursed life and you can not find a better example of somebody who was down and out who was hopeless who had no merit who had nothing that he could present at all nothing at all but completely depending on the mercy of God and you can say well is there somebody who merits anything in God's presence no sir I believe every human being from Adam down to the last baby born in Laodicea stands before God in the same situation as that man on the cross and you know what that should make a shout because as soon as we can cry remember me Lord we have the mercy of God to reply back today you will be with me in paradise this is a church member this is now in Jehovah Jireh the church member come to Christ says and stay until he's filled with the Holy Ghost it's the only it's the only promise of the rapture I hope you understand that the only promise of the rapture is what the Holy Ghost right not study not understanding not so-called revelation not dedication not loyalty the Holy Ghost the only way that the church and Christ can come together the very spirit the very spirit does when God made his first man in the Garden of Eden did you notice he made him both male and female now of course there's the mystery Paul speaks about a mystery when he talks about marriage and the coming together the union of those two spirits sort of two Spurs as really it's one spirit just a male and a female part he made him male and female he was man made in God's image a spirit he put him in flesh Genesis the next chapter after he already made him male and female and there still was no man to till the soil so so then he created man out of the dust of the earth not in his image the flesh man is not in the image of God because God is a spirit not in His image but then God came down in the form of man by Jesus Christ to redeem the man that fell from the image of the earth had to become that very cursed thing that he that he cursed he had to become it he had to become his own curse but you see the story doesn't stop there Easter doesn't stop on Golgotha Easter doesn't stop on Calvary's Hill Easter doesn't stop in the regions of the lost Easter goes right down to that morning where he the where the stone was rolled away and and that life that had triumphed over every device of the enemy that had robbed the devil of any authority that he had any any power that he had till he could only become a bluff that life stepping out of the tomb on Easter morning that's the completion of the story and not quite why he says the completion there but we know that some time later they were gathered in the upper room and they received the dividends of Easter right there God came to redeem the man it fell from the image of the earth and wasn't he was made in the image of the earth he's oh god can't you see what the gospel means when God became man's a man became God there was the transaction on Calvary's Hill there was the comparison between the life of Christ and the life of a nothing and no good a criminal why would God die for that man see there's your mystery why would God died for that man because he was the son of God and say wait a minute just wait a minute here a life of disgrace a life of sin and here no altar call no church affiliation no fivefold minister no teaching no instruction no tearing in an upper room in its deserved dying Agony's that life can be transformed by the spoken word of God yes sir absolutely see we can't limit God and when we look at what Jesus did for that man and that example you know you'll meet him at the wedding supper he'll be there yes sir he will be there and here you know this quote I read a little while ago here from the message of grace and I really really love it I'm gonna repeat it for you for the offer for tonight first paragraph 133 brother Brennan says he can take the vilest sinner and make him white as snow his don't have to ask he's talking about Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody about it right we want to set conditions even baptism well the man wasn't baptized how can he be regenerated remember baptism is justice showing what's already taken place on the inside it's something outward a lot of people who get baptized won't make it because they just got baptized there was no regeneration in the soul and look how quickly that regeneration took place and it was good enough to take him from his hellish existence he's capital punishment and put him in Tara dies in a moment how about a friend's one little cry of the heart what will it do to God how can it move God on your behalf and he spoke back and what has God done for you he's broadcast a whole message he's broadcast a whole message put it in your lap and all you have to do insist is say Lord yes it's me it's mine what you said here it's about me you're talking about me I receive it that way I received the pardon I receive all these beautiful things that you've laid out for us and made so plain in this hour I receive the supernatural I receive what you've done for me I believe is a present tense God and when we look at this thief on the cross we look this man and all the things that he had to go through I believe that same Jesus is right here where you are in your living room or around the kitchen table somewhere or maybe sitting outside if it's good weather I don't know where you are but God knows where you are he knew where this man was his entire life and he knew where he would end up and he knew the cry would come from his heart and he had an answer prepared for him what about us don't you think he has an answer prepared for you you say Lord I'm sick and I can't get well he says I have an answer for you I am the Lord who healeth thee by my stripes you are healed Lord I need a change of nature I need a change of desire I've been trying to be a Christian for so long and he said if you repent and you're baptized in my name for the remission of your sin you shall receive a change of nature you shall receive that spirit it'll sweep your right into the rapture sure you will that's the kind of God we're talking about it can take the vilest sinner make him white as snow don't have to ask anybody about it says oh if I it can do it because it's sovereign so listen quickly now that was proved at the cross when there was the vilest thief he deserved to die God had never come across his mind see there's the quote I talked about earlier God had never come across his mind never he had lived his entire life in selfishness in vain in criminal activities never thought about God never thought nothing of it since then there on the cross went through those bloody lips in between the groans there came a sound Lord be merciful to me and there came another cuz there came another one back through the blood and the tears and the agony and grace took ahold and said today shalt thou be with me in paradise grace did that how could that thief help himself how could he and you know what there's not a human being on earth in a better position than that thief not a human being I don't care how good you've been how many Sunday School classes you you took how many how many hours you spent listening or reading the Bible how many hours days you sat in the church how many testimonies you've given whatever you've done you're no better in no better position when it comes to the mercies of God and that thief's mercy cannot be deserved it cannot be earned grace means that you can't there is there's no way for you to deserve it grace means it's beyond what you can earn remember the Bible talks about the wages of sin is death you work for sin but the free gift of God the free gift of God grace did that says but the grace of God can do something about it and it does it's the grace of God the sovereignty of the grace of God come to their dying thief today shalt thou be with me in paradise think of it that's wonderful what happened there you see there was a reflection of God the reflection of what God told Eve in the garden that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent that reflection of God typed through every Old Testament shadow was right there on Calvary's Hill expressing the heart purpose of God right there so of course he caught it of course there was a silent cry going out on Golgotha hill he didn't have to preach a sermon he didn't have to do anything but the expression of God's love was so great till it redeemed that man lifted the veil for him and made him recognize who this was oh goodness now who do you say this is that's the question who do you say this endtime word is hmm just some religious movement oh the tying up of loose ends a code of conduct a burden of rules a lifestyle a tradition of fanaticism a cult what do you say about it who do you say this is that they've crucified in the 20th century that they've turned out their churches a religious persecution what is it all those things I mentioned or do you find there's a there's a cry there's a call there's a voice coming through all this it's the bridegroom's voice in the evening time the Bible tells us today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart certainly when that thief saw the reflection of God saw the redemptive grace of God on the gall gothis heal something answered in him and he cried out and remember doesn't take a big cry it doesn't take a long prayer it doesn't take a long begging for mercy all he did was say three words remember me Lord remember me Lord brother Branham says this because what happened there that entire that entire group of people who made up of all the different just too curious yeah the ones who were congratulating themselves so they got rid of this pest the Roman law the soldiers all those people standing around what did they see didn't recognize what was happening there and recognized the presence of God and recognized where the brown says I love this quote I use it often now when he's not recognized he Pat his power is always not revealed when he is not recognized he says no matter how much God is standing present you've got to believe it you've got to believe it there must be a deep there must be an echo there must be something happening in your heart and that thief expressed it when he called him Lord Lord he recognized him he recognized that that was God's sacrifice that was the Lamb of God on that tree on that cross he's like the woman with a bloody shoe says all them people were passing by all of them standing up saying there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a prophet this is the fanatic all things like that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him cousin when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was she recognized who he was see now he was veiled and he was veiled on Calvary and he was that was God dying for you God dying for me veiled in a human being veiled in a frail body that people couldn't recognize and couldn't make fun of how could God stand being made fun off see they've got no idea what greatness is they got no idea what power is but here she was she had recognized him God had lifted the veil for her it was not just a good man or a rabbi or a teacher or an impostor or whatever that was God there was power of healing power of life in that man and you know what she could she didn't even touch his body she just touched the hem of His garment wow what a revelation I wonder if we can catch that same revelation today and she said if I can only touch His garment see doesn't win that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release now look at this it released his power to heal her what did it release for the thief on the cross you could say she touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said your faith has saved you what did faith but look what he her touch brought words out of him and he declared her healing right there your faith has saved you your faith what is faith a revelation an unveiling that's what revelation is God unveiling to you and if God can unveil to you that you're not just sitting listening to a sermon today that he is in his word and he's the Holy Spirit is here to quicken that word to every heart that will say remain for me if God can unveil himself to you like that not a preacher not a prophet but God Himself in the form of the Holy Ghost in the word that he has bless you with that he's put in your language and in your lap and in your home and in your heart I believe that's the very God it's not principles it's not rules its power it's somebody that is here to heal you to lift you up to raise you up to put you in paradise in a moment well we know we're not looking for paradise anymore now that man recognized that thief recognized that was he was in the presence of God the Redeemer and it's released that recognition released the power of God to save him it brought him back to his rightful position there was no condition to it the condition was only if you can see me remember what the Prophet told Elijah if you can see me when I go you can have your request the power that I have will be released to you and that's exactly what God has brought for us in this endtime message I believe you can look beyond the frailty of a man from Kentucky with bad grammar if you if you can look beyond the the critics and and the agnostics and all the clever people who's trying to explain it all away and can bring all kinds of criticisms for whatever reason if you could look beyond that and see well why is this that happened in our day it releases the power of what God sent it for that word becomes life in you Jesus came down and he lifted me up how does Jesus come down friends in the form of the Holy Ghost you say but not just the Holy Ghost in sensation but the Holy Ghost who is the quickened word it's got to be able to quicken something now the blackness of his seemingly cursed life that man was transformed in a moment he could look away from his pain he could look away from his condemnation you could look away from his sin from his dark destination where he was going and only the words of Redeemer mattered now all that mattered now was that little line that Jesus spoke nothing else mattered he didn't have to go study ten years to make a rapture he was there he was in there spoken in there by the very words of God and what happened in our day friends is God bypasses the intellect entirely and God's voice speaking over you places you in the rapture places you there because that's his picture for now that's his desire for now the same as he had a picture of a man dying on a cross next to him Queen of Sheba 90/60 says now if God would answer Jonah's prayer under those conditions looking towards a temple that a man made that was the conditions say well that was sons God's instructions yeah it was still a man-made temple and God would answer his prayer looking towards that temple where a man prayed a man made it a man prayed a temple where there was a mercy seat it was overshadowed with a blood of a sheep how much more will he today when we look away from our symptoms look away from our symptoms our crippled condition our cancer our tumour or whatever we have or our sin and look to the throne of God where Jesus stands at the right hand of the Majesty with his own blood to make intercession upon our confession Wow isn't that what the man saw right there the mercy seat of God on the cross sure and just the smallest approach the smallest request the smallest cry from his heart made that mercy seat operative for him what about us when Jesus is the same what about us today when we're sitting with this problem where that need won't the mercy seat act in the same way if we have a cry in our hearts remember me Lord just forget your symptoms just as long as you look at your hand and say it's twisted it'll always be twisted I refuse to look at it anymore I look to the Holy Temple Oh Lord I remember what the Holy Temple is that's the body I'm telling you something will get sick Satan will when you go to beginning like that sure when it make Satan sick you want to make him sick of you sick of the bride so just telling them like you did the children of Israel take your stuff and go just leave take whatever you want take your family members take whatever you're claiming just can't stand you anymore make him sick how by looking looking at what that thief saw on the cross that day Oh God open our spiritual eyes now where do I hear that voice today you may ask in conferences 1961 Susan we know that the time is near at hand we see the world in a quivering shaking condition right we just have dress rehearsal now talk about viruses as paralyzed the world hundred and eighty-six countries and lockdown for how long nobody knows dress rehearsal just the beginning of Sorrows just a little toothache compared to what's coming because we know that the time is near at hand now God's already spoken it we see the world in a quivering shaking condition knowing that the atoms will soon be burning the atomists and the heavens will be on fire as the Apostle Peter said and will burn with fervent heat the atoms of the earth will catch fire soon there will be a relay and there will be not even dust left of the people now that's the left something to bury they won't even be dust left of the people sitting then what Lord said maybe 500 years from now an old tombstone blown over yonder in the howling winds the burning blistering Sun when it lays near the Sun for its purification before the millennium maybe the name of the some of the people here will be written on that where will their wandering soul be since may they not look to this modern world now but may they look away to Christ listen to the message and the messenger that's speaking in their heart so where's the voice speaking it spoke off the cross of Calvary it said today you'll be with me in paradise what is the voice saying to you today via the messy the messenger that's speaking we're in your ears no you can hear it a hundred hundred hours of it and never make a difference to your life if it speaks in your heart there was a communication happening on Calvary there's a communication happening between God the Redeemer and every believers heart oh my what does it do transports you translates you raptures you new heights you know the word the kingdom of God is the word of God turned into power the word of god turned into power that's my new heights the power of God and we are still being transformed by the voice of God the same as that voice of Jesus placed that man in paradise the same voice of God speaking today on the earth that same Holy Ghost still speaking through the messenger through the message to every believers heart placing us where we ought to be he says this is comes from greater than Solomon is here 61 it says when he told Nathanael there that day I said I saw you before you were under or when you were under the fig tree I saw you Nathanael being an ordained man to eternal life I like that part Nathanael like that thief on the cross being an ordained man to or to eternal life that means to me you know what that means he could wiggle he could squirm he could run he could do whatever he wanted to do he could backslide as far as the moons from the Sun and he couldn't dodge it he couldn't dodge it because he was ordained to eternal life when God ordained something that thief on the cross couldn't live a life bad enough to disqualify him from that phrase that line that Jesus was going to say about him my now watch here is Nathanael being an ordained man to eternal life he said rabbi thou art the Son of God what happens the king of Israel the veil lifts for Nathaniel since he said blessed art thou same thing he said to Simon since why since because I told you this about the fig tree you believed you can see greater things than this now what he's talking about discernment but he says greater things because you could see the discernment must be God because you have that ear you're going to see greater things now just watch this this is because I told you this you believe you can see greater things he's ready then to move on up into another sphere you ever thought of that to see he's ready then to move on up into another sphere as soon as he he'd see greater things said you'd be able to see the angels descending and ascending upon the Son of Man now he can look into the spiritual realm not just see an earthly sign performed and say that's God because he could do that there was a higher realm for him that would open up and what about us friends you can see the God the same Jesus Christ manifest himself through the Prophet and what happens another realm opens up to you a higher realm a higher reality and you can look into spiritual places as cross he was coming into higher heights higher heights is not a carrot in front of a donkey okay higher heights is meant for you because you've been ordained for it in fact the highest of heights is just around the corner when these vile old bodies change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hmm higher heights said if you now look how illustrates it says of you that's just accepted Christ by justification accept him by sanctification and clean up your life he says you're still smoking watch what happens how much different says you look back to justification oh you were just standing justified and never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost say step up step up into that sphere what is that sphere it's not me nation so much it's what God said about you the sphere heaven consists of the word if you're going to look into the word what does he say about me Wow what does he say about me that if I repent if I turn around I'm baptized I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's no if or maybe about it there's a shell there's a definite there's an assurance that's the realm the sphere you need to step into it doesn't then look back down at the rest of it see and says just keep walking after a while you get so light you can just walk on up in the rapture I believe that's where we are supposed to be drop all these things that are so important that have suddenly become so unimportant my goodness you still had hopes to pay off that mortgage you still had hopes of reaching a retirement you stud hopes of this in the hopes of that forget it all get lighter get rid of these things that's bogging you down these memories and these old habits and things it's not why because you're free from those things if you look at God's Word if you look at what Easter really means that that quickening spurt drowsing you now you can get light enough to walk on up in the rapture says we used to sing an old song each day brings me one around a higher higher see that's what we ought to do never build the same fire on the grounds the second night just keep climbing higher higher you know God's checklist God has a checklist - yeah sure that upward progression it always goes up and up and up when he started with Luther and the Reformation he staff started down there and he always follows the same pattern you want to see the pattern quickly the pattern is for the life of the individual as well here's the pattern he says this in the message only belief he says only belief only believe he's coming soon he brought Abraham justified him sanctified him going higher filled him with the Holy Ghost what Abraham yes sir placed him as his son showed himself alive we're talking about higher and higher now right by turning his back and talking there's your discernment give him sorry telling what Sarah said in the tent and then changed his body there's the last little step the highest step we go to right changing of the body that's what's next on the program why because we've already seen him alive turning his back to the audience and telling us who that was and what they thought huh so where are we at the last last little step the changing of the body sure he says justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost placed as a son coming among us now showing himself alive that's history friends and waiting for the change of the body mm-hmm God's checklist is complete there's nothing regarding his bride it still needs to be checked off say well and then them coming into some sort of perfection know the perfection was done at Calvary friend if we can accept it if we can accept it then we are perfected because by one sacrifice he perfected forever so there's no adding that we do there's no we say well we need to become more mature yeah how are you going to do that see there's nothing for you to do here there's no step for you to add there's no amount of dedication that there's nothing for the thief on the cross to add to get him into paradise it was just a cry just a desire just a deep calling out and if you have a desire for this old body to change for what so you can escape this world so you can escape pain yeah sure those things are there but the greatest thing is to glorify God to fulfill that scripture that speaks about you that he wrote before there was a world about you personally there's a line there's a well actually there are quite a few lines there are a few lines that he's waiting to say about you just as soon as you're ready to cry here in Abraham and his seed after him I'm just about through Abraham and his seed after him he says but the next thing the next thing for the church is to be changed we've had every sign and now look at the signs is giving justification we're under Luther already sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit placing of a son saying the same things here manifestation of the Spirit okay that wasn't you there was on the profit that was discernment that was the sign of a present tense Jesus Christ so you can quit trying to manifest nothing this is now what the changing of the body for the rapture there's your manifestation there's your manifestation and I would like to ask you with tears in my eyes just how much can you contribute towards that well you can see the parallel of the thief on the cross we have nothing to contribute except to cry remember me Lord remember me hmm changing of the body for the rapture says oh my here's our attitude right now what do you care what can you do what can I do brother this is how the church ought to be waving its hands in glory it says thanking God thanking God any minute the change could come oh brother what do you care about the finances and whether your bank is going this way in your house is going that way and you don't if you're gonna have food tomorrow so what the change can come any moment any moment that's where my hope is that's where my joy is that's where my expectation is here's something beautiful why do we have this gentle squeeze of this whole story coming on us and it's a very very gentle squeeze very gentle here's something that might tell you there's a little season of quiet a little season of quiet a moment brother Branham says to hold steady and many people have that just before they received the Holy Ghost there's a little season just listen to this this comes from oneness he says here we are in the end time coming from the east and west north and south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture since getting ready says holding ourselves steady for a few minutes just a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost then she'll go up then she'll go up how do you how do you know that this time wasn't ordained by God so we can hold steady for a few minutes till every fiber now you say well I'm filled with the Holy Ghost yeah but what about your wife what about your husband what about your kids what about grandpa maybe they're not filled so we're holding steady for them so everybody every fiber of the whole body of Christ not just your body can be filled with the Holy Ghost then she'll go up for sure this oh my calling his people together to himself not to a church not to a minister not to a name to himself right in the true oneness with himself because it's his one Holy Spirit one Holy Spirit the body of Christ cannot be divided has one spirit in it now he remembers his promise if you can hear and receive that's what he said John 5:24 if you can hear his voice and receive you are free from judgment and that judgment I have good news for you and I'm gonna read you the quote quickly from the endtime evangelism is present that judgment and future judgment all judgment it's praying at the end of endtime evangelism maybe I think i'ma ask you where you are if you're in the lounge somewhere around the kitchen table wherever you are today I'm gonna ask you just to stand with me while I read this and you can read it on the screen there with me he says and I pray father that this very day that you'll take into your kingdom into your fellowship here on earth every one of these believers and be kind to them Jesus you said you were here on earth in st. John 5:24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come to the judgment they'll not be there when the judgment strikes the earth right won't come to the judgment don't you fear anything that's happening don't you fear how much they clamp down how much Big Brother's looking over your shoulder all of a sudden it doesn't matter the promise of God stands true today and we are praying with a prophet here that every person will come into that fellowship and do that assurance that you will not be here when judgment strikes this is not judgment yet it's a toothache it's a little thing compared to judgment when judgment comes they'll beg to be buried but they've passed from death unto life you promised it Lord I claim them I claim them now what do you see around you a world spiraling down into judgment get your eyes off the world get your eyes on him today who is he the word of this hour that declares that word eternally declares many are the afflictions of the righteous but he delivered him out of them all that's what the word says about you I am the Lord and He loved thee I will hide you in my pavilion we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed how about that at the last Trump when he will sound brother that's what I'm listening for stand stand and claim stand and cry if that's all you can do all you can do today say Lord I'm not in a very good condition spiritually I don't feel like I'm waking up I don't feel any of the pressure or the world is rocking me to sleep but remember me that's all he wants remember me the world in its dying throes its final Agony's what does your heart say is this your Lord is this the one who's calling to you through all these messages through all these scriptures won't you want to be remembered we're gonna pray together and ask you just to close your eyes where you are and if you feel in your heart Lord remember me you just raise your hand to him now say doesn't make a difference yes it does yes sir that thief had to express it he couldn't just look at Jesus he had to say remember me Lord maybe you want to say that this morning wherever you are and don't be embarrassed by the people around you if you're by yourself all the better you say Lord remember me you know my coming in and my going out you remember every part of my life you know where I'm at spiritually Lord I want to be in that rapture I want to be in a translation I have no home in this world anymore remember me Lord remember my situation Lord remember the burdens I carry remember the sorrow in my heart remember Oh Lord you are the healer you are the joy giver you're the answer to every longing let's pray Lord God we recognize your presence we know you are right there Oh God in every home of every believer right this moment you are an ever-present help in the time of trouble that's what your word declares and we cry to you today Lord remember me remember me in the coming days Lord we're listening for that voice to speak back when my body gives way when my spear dries up and the cupboards are bare and the Tormentor comes around Lord remember me lift us up up higher Lord draws us up translate us by your word as you did for that thief Oh God bring us out of our condition you've paid the price now by your Holy spirt quicken us to your word Lord make it real in every heart Lord remember all these Lord as I commit them to you now Lord where they're standing where they have their hearts lifted up with the cries are going out to you Lord remember them seal them fill them Lord bring them to that change of the body make them rapture ready place them in the condition Lord by your precious blood and your great sacrifice and your power divine Lord God and quicken them to your word unveil to them that you are a present help and you are there all the time and you'll never leave or forsake that you're still the same Jesus that you've ever been and bless them now Oh God as I hand them back to you Lord and these special Easter services we thank you for them and we thank you for a resurrected Christ we thank you for the proof of that resurrection in our hearts today and we praise you Lord Jesus and we give you glory and honor and we give you all our love and all our devotion and we thank you God for your precious hand upon our lives Lord you lead us every step of the way bless your name bless your people and I commit them to you Lord and I claim them for your kingdom in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise God may he bless you richly Oh as you go over these things you know that's the good thing to go to have a perhaps have a recording or something where you can go over things again just read these quotes again read some scriptures get into the
