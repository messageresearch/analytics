[10:58] brother Tony Murray who is with his
[11:00] brother Tony
[11:01] brother Tony would you open the the
[11:03] meeting in Pre this morning if you don't
[11:05] mind
[11:06] um well brother Tony is coming I I just
[11:09] have a prayer request here
[11:10] a prayer request for Zoe
[11:14] he is heavily medicated for depression
[11:17] and this is like being in a prison cell
[11:20] and asks God for deliverance and also a
[11:23] request for Margaret manderson who's
[11:25] also suffering from depression
[11:27] so we'll pray for that and as brother
[11:30] Tony come up if you ever need this
[11:31] morning you can also express it to the
[11:33] Lord and we'll lift it up together to
[11:35] the Lord
[11:40] Heavenly Father Lord we're we're just so
[11:43] glad we can gather in your presence Lord
[11:44] and look my head into 2023 we don't know
[11:47] what this year will hold but as long as
[11:50] we know that you're holding our hand
[11:51] it's the thing that we're relying on
[11:54] Lord Jesus you brought us thus far and
[11:57] even just seeing the Breather and here
[11:58] many of us come from many years ago
[12:01] we've been walking this way but we're so
[12:03] thankful Lord that you've been holding
[12:05] our hand
[12:07] Lord now as we gather for this service
[12:09] this morning
[12:10] just pray that you'd give a liberty to
[12:12] brother Marcus did he just better say
[12:14] those things that you've put on his
[12:16] heart Lord you brought him here I
[12:18] Believe by inspiration we're just uh we
[12:22] thank you for that Lord and just ask now
[12:23] that we would also enter into that same
[12:26] inspiration Lord where we can hear from
[12:28] you
[12:29] a lot of the different needs that are
[12:31] here you know us each one Lord
[12:33] and I just pray that you'd meet those
[12:34] needs draw us to yourself Lord help us
[12:37] to be in the right position
[12:39] so that we can hear from you now we ask
[12:41] and pray and ask your blessing in Jesus
[12:42] name amen
[12:45] God bless you
[12:48] praise the lord well I want to say a
[12:49] special welcome to all our visitors
[12:52] I know there's some people still driving
[12:54] and so forth but I'm going to say may
[12:57] God make each one feel very very welcome
[13:01] this morning
[13:03] um I
[13:06] this is always a a difficult thing to
[13:09] find the balance in
[13:12] um because I know different cultures and
[13:14] different Church cultures have different
[13:16] ways of dealing with it so I'll just
[13:19] I'll just say look we in a taranakinian
[13:21] we're going to do it you know the
[13:23] Stratford Way but but I'm one of those
[13:26] guys I don't like to be called Pastor
[13:28] and I don't want to be lifted up and you
[13:30] know that's and and we're not here to
[13:32] lift any man up or any man up amen but
[13:36] at the same time also we we want to
[13:38] acknowledge
[13:40] um you know Warriors of the faith and we
[13:42] want to acknowledge also many churches
[13:45] that have supported this weekend and we
[13:48] we want to acknowledge and say thank you
[13:51] to to pastors and to churches that have
[13:54] uh you know come here themselves and
[13:57] send people and then made announcements
[13:59] and all of those things so I wonder if I
[14:01] could just ask for a moment any
[14:03] ministers and bastards that are here can
[14:04] you just stand up and we just want to
[14:06] acknowledge you for a moment
[14:08] because it's not lifting up main but
[14:10] this is lifting up what God is doing in
[14:12] lives amen
[14:16] praise the Lord I think there's a few
[14:17] more that's just shy
[14:20] Amy thank you relatez
[14:23] amen God bless you Brothers may the Lord
[14:25] richly bless you amen may the Lord
[14:27] continue to to inspire you and Lead You
[14:31] use you for his flock amen
[14:34] we also have local visitors and we have
[14:37] visitors from all sorts of places I know
[14:41] that also these services are being
[14:42] streamed from from many places in the
[14:45] world so I want to also say to all those
[14:47] who are streaming live God bless you
[14:49] welcome
[14:51] we we want to want everyone to feel
[14:54] welcome this morning
[14:55] I don't know that yesterday there was
[14:57] just a Vibe here but this morning it
[14:59] seems like you're tired man I think we
[15:01] should get
[15:02] I think before Simon gets us going on
[15:04] singing he needs to do a few burpees
[15:06] with us or something that's his
[15:08] specialty
[15:11] but um I trust you're excited about the
[15:14] services this morning
[15:16] I mean I trust we come with your cups
[15:18] held our high to to receive what God has
[15:20] for us
[15:22] am I going to say again I know I'm I'm
[15:24] repeating myself but if there's any need
[15:26] that you have any any visitors that's
[15:28] unsure about where to find the bathroom
[15:30] or anything like that speak to the
[15:31] Deacon Brothers at the back and they can
[15:34] point you in the right direction
[15:35] but also say if you come here with with
[15:38] fears and you come here with you know
[15:40] self-pity and with complexes and with
[15:43] hurts and with all those things it's
[15:45] okay
[15:46] right
[15:47] because church is a place where we come
[15:49] for healing
[15:52] but don't come here one thing to feel
[15:54] sorry for yourself and one thing to hold
[15:56] on to your hurts and wanting to hold on
[15:58] to your complexes I mean the whole point
[16:00] of hospital is to get people healed time
[16:03] not to put a burden on the taxpayers
[16:06] money
[16:08] we can never be a burden for God right
[16:11] but we want to come for healing we want
[16:13] to come for a closer walk with God I
[16:15] mean we want to look forward to to 2023
[16:17] and and you know I hope I don't
[16:19] embarrass people too much but these you
[16:21] know specific young men here and another
[16:24] lady sitting here somewhere that's also
[16:26] particularly excited about this year
[16:29] I mean getting married in couple weeks
[16:38] you know they have very specific
[16:40] requirements and I don't know if God
[16:41] Honors that kind of requirements you
[16:43] know if time just go fast and then
[16:46] certain date Let It Go Slow for a week
[16:49] or so amen praise the Lord but you know
[16:53] we just we just I know it's a little bit
[16:55] of humor but we we're just family and we
[16:57] just want to be you know honoring God
[16:59] and and serving God together we want to
[17:01] spend eternity together so we might as
[17:03] well get used to one another now
[17:05] Hallelujah
[17:08] um I just want to ask maybe can you guys
[17:10] just put that PowerPoint up again I
[17:13] shared these things on Friday and I'm
[17:14] just going to repeat that this morning
[17:17] there's a
[17:20] recently when we went to Vanuatu brother
[17:24] Adrian and I saw a um that brother
[17:26] pathio now I know many of you know
[17:28] brother pethio he's a solid message
[17:31] Minister has been serving the lord for
[17:33] for years got a solid revelation of the
[17:37] word and so he had a misfortune a few
[17:40] years ago that
[17:42] um the the island where his church was
[17:46] had a volcano and the whole island was
[17:48] basically evacuated and and he lost his
[17:52] congregation and and lost access to his
[17:55] building and so forth and they've been
[17:57] pottering on for a few years now they've
[18:00] got they basically get together in in
[18:02] his house and under very uncomfortable
[18:06] circumstances and they're really too
[18:08] many for the house as it is and so so we
[18:12] want to support them to build a church
[18:15] that you can see on the pictures they've
[18:18] they've done a lot themselves so far
[18:23] but they they need in the order of 12
[18:28] 000 New Zealand dollars in order to
[18:32] finish the church
[18:34] um and and fit out the church and so
[18:36] forth so I felt and I and I don't want
[18:38] to abuse this time together but I felt
[18:40] if if there's any one of you here that
[18:42] would love to support it we're not
[18:44] pulling for money this is not the focus
[18:46] of the of the convention and God has
[18:48] provided for us to to put up the
[18:50] convention and all of that we're not
[18:51] pulling for money at all but if God
[18:53] places on your heart to support this
[18:55] project I would really appreciate it if
[18:58] you can
[18:59] um put cash in the offering box and
[19:01] again I'll explain why we want to do
[19:03] this cache the the government has put
[19:06] limitations on how much money we can
[19:09] spend on overseas Mission work
[19:12] um and we are we are kind of very
[19:13] dangerously close to those limits so we
[19:15] we don't want to get ourselves in
[19:17] trouble but we found a sensible and
[19:21] government accepted way of getting the
[19:23] money there and and I promise you we'll
[19:26] treat that money very carefully we'll
[19:28] keep record of it and all of that but
[19:30] what it does mean is because it's not
[19:31] going to go through the charity we're
[19:33] not going to issue uh ird receipts which
[19:37] means you won't be able to claim that as
[19:39] a as a taxable donation to a charity so
[19:42] just so that everyone understands that
[19:45] process and the purpose for that and if
[19:46] you have any questions feel free to come
[19:48] speak to me
[19:50] um so but if you if you want to support
[19:52] that that would be lovely
[19:55] um I bring greetings from Brother Andrew
[19:57] Donaldson in the church in Auckland and
[20:00] they've asked me to
[20:01] to make an announcement about the
[20:04] Auckland Easter convention
[20:06] so we just want to make sure that you
[20:08] all especially that website web address
[20:11] make sure you get it
[20:13] so Brother David Seiler is coming God
[20:15] willing and and by waiting for another
[20:17] brother to confirm
[20:20] and I think the message is be quick if
[20:23] if the last few months is any indication
[20:25] time flies very very quickly until these
[20:28] things come around
[20:30] so make sure you get your your
[20:32] accommodation booked early and so forth
[20:36] and then there's some
[20:39] that I would like to um
[20:41] to just run past you and I guess
[20:43] specifically the streamers need to
[20:46] listen up very carefully to that brother
[20:49] Marcus is has asked if it would be
[20:52] possible for tomorrow morning service to
[20:54] be focused more on the youth
[20:57] and he wants to
[21:00] he wants to be himself
[21:03] he doesn't want to be inhibited by
[21:05] wondering who's watching from the other
[21:07] side of the world and how are they going
[21:08] to interpret it so what we're going to
[21:10] do is tomorrow morning's service other
[21:13] than we previously announced we're not
[21:15] going to live stream it
[21:17] um we're going to have the private
[21:19] stream available just for our you know
[21:21] people working in the kitchen and and so
[21:23] forth that won't be able to sit through
[21:25] the service but publicly we're not going
[21:27] to live stream the service tomorrow
[21:28] morning just so that he can you know not
[21:32] get himself in trouble so we all
[21:34] understand that we appreciate that and
[21:36] so and I think the other message is make
[21:39] sure the youth is here tomorrow morning
[21:40] because it's going to be focused a
[21:42] little on them
[21:45] all right any questions anything that we
[21:48] can do for you any help that you need on
[21:50] anything yes sir
[21:57] yes now in fact we'll put it stronger
[21:59] than that we want the older people here
[22:01] people here even though please don't be
[22:04] offended that we call you older it's
[22:05] just older right it's not old
[22:09] all right
[22:10] but we we want you here and and we'd
[22:13] love you to support the services maybe
[22:15] what we can do is we can reserve like
[22:17] the first three rows in front for the
[22:19] young people and we ask the young people
[22:20] to sit in front and then us all these
[22:23] will sit at the back I'll keep myself
[22:25] out of trouble by putting it that way
[22:28] I mean so I trust you really to have
[22:30] church I don't want to take too much
[22:32] time I know we have a few song items and
[22:34] things that that we want to get through
[22:36] so I don't want to carry on too much but
[22:38] let's just kick off with the song and
[22:40] please forgive me but I'm just going to
[22:41] kick off with the song four one four
[22:45] and you'll recognize the chorus it's the

[55:46] Paul is a pleasure to see I mean so I
[55:50] um really happy to see you my my brother
[55:52] my friend and all the ministering
[55:53] brothers that are here I really see that
[55:55] I just have to explain myself I came
[55:58] from far and uh two days to come two
[56:00] days to go and brought the arrowhead on
[56:02] his heart that I take all the services
[56:03] but it's not because I'm a better
[56:05] preacher because I know no New Zealand
[56:07] has very very good preachers you know
[56:09] and I wanted to come just preach Jesus
[56:11] love you but I found a better not do
[56:14] this if you have that kind of ministers
[56:16] that are here so I'm very very
[56:18] privileged and really uh wish you the
[56:21] very very best from my heart amen so so
[56:24] let us open the word of the Lord in the
[56:26] Book of Matthew
[56:28] and um
[56:30] Matthew chapter 12 verse 38 and
[56:33] Hallelujah
[56:38] I mean
[56:40] Matthew chapter 12 38.
[56:45] and he says then a certain of the
[56:48] scribes and the Pharisees answered
[56:51] saying Master we would see a sign from
[56:55] thee
[56:56] but he answered and said unto them an
[56:58] evil and adulterous generation and
[57:00] brother Brandon made clear said that's
[57:02] this generation Jesus was speaking
[57:04] prophetically for our time that's what
[57:06] he says and even an adulterous
[57:07] generation seeketh after a sign and
[57:10] there shall no sign be given to it but
[57:13] the sign of the Prophet Jonas
[57:16] for as Jonas was there three days and
[57:20] three nights in the whale's belly so
[57:22] shall the son of man be three days and
[57:25] three nights in the heart of the Earth
[57:27] the men of Nineveh shall rise in
[57:30] judgment with this generation and shall
[57:32] condemn it because they are repented at
[57:35] the preaching of Jonas and behold the
[57:38] greater than Jonas is here may the Lord
[57:41] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[57:43] word we may be seated
[57:47] and again I want to thank brother El Rey
[57:50] for the nice invitation I want to be
[57:52] honest with you I didn't have on my
[57:54] heart to come I really wanted to make
[57:55] some holidays but he was pulling so
[57:58] strong and now I feel it I'm really
[58:00] really happy to be among you you know I
[58:03] could I cannot say it's the best place
[58:04] for me because maybe somebody from home
[58:06] streams in and then I have to give an
[58:09] answer when I'm coming back home
[58:11] but it has been a wonderful time so far
[58:14] and we we are really thankful to to our
[58:18] wonderful Lord Lord and Savior Jesus
[58:20] Christ now what I realized
[58:23] um on tomorrow morning I'm very happy
[58:26] that we have a real youth service and
[58:28] I'm really really practical and very
[58:29] dramatically with the young people and I
[58:32] thank for the array for for arranging it
[58:34] that way because not everybody
[58:35] understands it you know and so we have
[58:38] to pay attention that we are not calling
[58:40] critics and he said what is what is he
[58:42] doing here and there but sometimes we
[58:43] want to come a little bit on the level
[58:45] of the youngsters okay so it's so so to
[58:48] play certain things how it works in
[58:50] church maybe we see a little video and
[58:52] certain things and this evening
[58:54] I would like to call I I know I'm I'm I
[58:57] was repeating myself but I'm always
[58:58] involving that subject I want to speak
[59:00] about healing by the third pool I would
[59:03] like to talk about many many things that
[59:05] can happen to us if it's child abuse if
[59:08] it's if it's if it's traumas if it's uh
[59:11] misunderstandings if it's
[59:14] um hurted feelings if it's whatever it
[59:17] is
[59:18] um broken families broken hearts uh
[59:21] bitterness many many things
[59:23] pass our way and we are part of it
[59:26] though we have received the Holy Spirit
[59:28] but there's a part that we are
[59:30] struggling with okay so in and and and
[59:32] and we show a little bit the
[59:34] subconscious and things so far and so
[59:36] that nobody uh has the impression that
[59:38] we're seeking preaching psychology we
[59:41] preach everything out of the message of
[59:42] the hour but this morning I would like
[59:44] to speak about the most inner part of us
[59:47] which is the real answer and uh so that
[59:50] we see that the two Services just in one
[59:53] okay
[59:55] um for the service of of of uh that we
[59:58] had during the time okay uh different
[1:00:01] different different thoughts that we
[1:00:03] have
[1:00:04] it's it's so important you must
[1:00:07] understand brother Brian said if we're
[1:00:09] preaching Calvinism it leads to a dead
[1:00:12] end
[1:00:13] if we are preaching arminianism and we
[1:00:16] learned this I mean if we're preaching
[1:00:18] arminism brother Brahm said it leads you
[1:00:21] to a dead end so how you bring two
[1:00:23] things together you have to understand
[1:00:25] we have two groups of people we have the
[1:00:27] church and we have the bride
[1:00:30] I mean that is so important the bride
[1:00:32] has another Covenant than the church
[1:00:35] the church is whosoever let him come
[1:00:37] praise the Lord the bride she is part of
[1:00:40] him
[1:00:41] that's different but if you were not in
[1:00:43] him in the beginning you cannot come
[1:00:45] back to him Redemption is bringing back
[1:00:48] to your formal Estates
[1:00:50] that's not for the church that's for the
[1:00:52] bride many will receive eternal life at
[1:00:55] the white Throne judgment even by their
[1:00:56] deeds but he doesn't tell that they were
[1:00:58] with him in with him in the beginning
[1:01:00] but the bride will be with him all
[1:01:03] together and here I will prove it to you
[1:01:05] just by a little verse in the Bible you
[1:01:06] don't have to read it with me but you
[1:01:08] believe me that's here okay
[1:01:11] it says in Hebrews and you put on your
[1:01:13] spiritual jacket and you let let believe
[1:01:16] the Bible like the Bible is it says this
[1:01:18] Hebrews chapter 2 verse 11 for both
[1:01:23] he that sanctifies
[1:01:25] and though they who are Sanctified are
[1:01:29] all of One
[1:01:32] uh-huh
[1:01:33] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:01:36] call them brothers
[1:01:39] we come from the same source
[1:01:42] great Jesus is is he's the ma he's the
[1:01:45] Redeemer he's the Messiah he's
[1:01:47] everything but at the same time he's my
[1:01:48] brother
[1:01:50] and brother REM could sing he's my
[1:01:51] father he's my mother he's my brother my
[1:01:53] sister is everything to me
[1:01:55] because we come from the same family
[1:01:57] we don't have the same uh Ministry
[1:02:00] because he was the Redeemer and I'm the
[1:02:01] one who is redeemed he's the male and
[1:02:03] I'm the female he's the bright woman I'm
[1:02:05] the bride but we come from the same
[1:02:07] source
[1:02:08] blessed be the name of the Lord as we
[1:02:10] were hearing yesterday and you and and I
[1:02:13] will just repeat to make myself a little
[1:02:14] to warm me a little bit up uh we showed
[1:02:17] yesterday the family of God in the mind
[1:02:19] of God according to the logos and so
[1:02:21] forth and um brother Wayne makes a quote
[1:02:25] he says he says God was alone with his
[1:02:28] thoughts
[1:02:29] in other words he wasn't alone
[1:02:33] he was alone with his thoughts and we
[1:02:37] were saying as we were seeing yesterday
[1:02:38] God was not thinking his thoughts were
[1:02:41] already Eternal they were part of gods
[1:02:43] that's what brother blame says so in
[1:02:45] what form Ever you have your own fantasy
[1:02:47] about it I know that there's quotes that
[1:02:49] even uh brother Ram said we were those
[1:02:51] angels uh not believing Satan's side but
[1:02:53] I'm not preaching it here because then
[1:02:55] it brings more confusion than to help
[1:02:57] you leave it up to the local pastor but
[1:02:59] these things are there in God's in in
[1:03:01] the message of the hour and what I want
[1:03:03] to say this too is I see some visitors
[1:03:07] that we have way in the back and I
[1:03:09] really want to welcome you and it's a
[1:03:10] great thing that you are here I know
[1:03:12] that this morning we are we are using a
[1:03:15] little bit message vocabulary okay so
[1:03:18] don't be frustrated okay come back okay
[1:03:22] we have our a little bit our own speech
[1:03:25] if I if I go to some country and I
[1:03:29] always ask please uh please pick me up
[1:03:31] at the airport at the railway station or
[1:03:33] whatever
[1:03:34] and sometimes they don't know me and
[1:03:37] then they I do not know them so the
[1:03:39] thing is I'm watching in their eyes a
[1:03:41] little bit is a question mark and they
[1:03:43] look in my eyes with a question mark and
[1:03:46] if I don't know if the brother I said
[1:03:47] third pool
[1:03:52] you understand
[1:03:54] nobody understands Circle only who's in
[1:03:57] the message
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:58] and he said third pull okay
[1:04:01] code words
[1:04:04] uh
[1:04:05] so so by this and and let's let's let me
[1:04:09] do it like like I did all the time I'm
[1:04:11] more coaching this morning I'm talking
[1:04:13] to you it's quite a deep subject it's
[1:04:15] wonderful
[1:04:16] um please brothers and sisters I know
[1:04:19] that here is quite ministers here's
[1:04:20] Elders they know the message the same as
[1:04:24] me
[1:04:25] you understand one thing you cannot
[1:04:27] bring the whole balance of a subject in
[1:04:30] 90 minutes it's not possible okay I
[1:04:32] cannot nobody can do that okay you
[1:04:35] cannot bring every aspect
[1:04:37] in 19 minutes it's not possible please
[1:04:39] bear that there are some aspects that
[1:04:41] are not touched okay but we try to be as
[1:04:44] balanced as possible because we will see
[1:04:47] one thing we're dealing with the sign
[1:04:50] of Jonah
[1:04:52] and Jesus was asked the question please
[1:04:56] give us a sign he said and a wicked in
[1:04:58] adulterous generation asked for a sign
[1:05:01] and there is no sign to be given only
[1:05:04] the sign of the prophet Jonah as he will
[1:05:08] be in the in in the valley of as he was
[1:05:10] in the belly of the whale for three days
[1:05:13] and three nights and we realize that
[1:05:17] this is a shadow on the Lord Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ
[1:05:21] definitely so but we are having right
[1:05:25] now a problem if we believe the Bible
[1:05:27] because Jesus wasn't in the grave for
[1:05:30] three days and three nights okay we are
[1:05:33] already in trouble and the Bible can
[1:05:36] only be open brother bear said by a
[1:05:40] prophetic type of people
[1:05:42] amen because Jesus he would he was
[1:05:45] crucified that is very sure on just
[1:05:48] before the Sabbath there was Friday
[1:05:49] evening and he was in his grave Friday
[1:05:53] night
[1:05:54] Saturday and he rose up Sunday morning
[1:05:58] that makes at maximum two nights
[1:06:03] and brother Ben was asked the question
[1:06:04] brother Brian said yes but in between of
[1:06:07] three days we know that this question
[1:06:09] but we believe that the Bible doesn't
[1:06:11] lie
[1:06:12] we believe God knows what he says
[1:06:16] and and so brother Abraham said
[1:06:18] prophecies have a compound meaning
[1:06:23] sometimes a double meaning and now let's
[1:06:26] see how how how Jesus how Christ how the
[1:06:30] word was in the veil in the Valley of
[1:06:33] the Earth for three days and three
[1:06:34] nights and how it came out okay can you
[1:06:37] say Amen to this okay so you lay so you
[1:06:40] lay back please oh do you have my no
[1:06:41] please if the technicians will help me
[1:06:43] please lay back
[1:06:45] and um
[1:06:47] enjoy the message of the hour I know
[1:06:50] some of the young teenagers I want to
[1:06:52] say here some quotes of brother Branham
[1:06:53] you're not frustrated okay I understand
[1:06:56] if you take five ten fifteen percent
[1:06:58] that's already wonderful just to have a
[1:07:00] certain overview
[1:07:02] um this morning we are not talking too
[1:07:04] much to the young people but we will but
[1:07:06] but you will have your place later I
[1:07:08] remember we came to the Holland
[1:07:10] convention and brother at basically was
[1:07:12] preaching there and I was always so
[1:07:14] frustrated I mean he talked about things
[1:07:16] that came out of the church I was
[1:07:19] frustrated why doesn't he talk about
[1:07:21] things that we understand and later what
[1:07:23] I was studying the message popped up
[1:07:25] what he said
[1:07:27] you have to understand that we're laying
[1:07:29] a seeds
[1:07:31] and then you read the message yourself
[1:07:32] and yet you remember okay that's what it
[1:07:34] is I never forgot I didn't understand
[1:07:35] but then I heard except that exist with
[1:07:38] something we lay a seed and and so never
[1:07:41] be frustrated if you just say your only
[1:07:43] thing I understand is railway station
[1:07:45] okay okay
[1:07:47] so so here's brother Branham and
[1:07:50] according to what we were seeing
[1:07:52] yesterday about the angel being our own
[1:07:55] theophany that's what brother Bremen
[1:07:57] said my personal Angel is our theophany
[1:08:00] and and it shows uh that is what sister
[1:08:03] Rebecca said she said when we left
[1:08:05] Jeffersonville to go to Tucson uh the
[1:08:09] car was packed and but brother Brandon
[1:08:11] his father her father just went into the
[1:08:13] car and she put up a little picture that
[1:08:17] uh she had over her bed and uh brought
[1:08:21] it into the car and they brought that
[1:08:22] picture up to Tucson
[1:08:25] and I want to say this
[1:08:27] if you want to get benefit of the
[1:08:29] message of the hour don't don't fall
[1:08:34] upon details
[1:08:36] I mean that person was discussing to me
[1:08:39] about there is no female angel and
[1:08:41] probably said there is no female angel
[1:08:42] though we can say yes there is our
[1:08:44] theophany amen but when he spoke he
[1:08:47] speaks about angel with two wings and
[1:08:48] there is no brother brain is right the
[1:08:50] Bible is right but still he made it that
[1:08:52] way
[1:08:53] because because the picture is more
[1:08:56] important god brother Ryan wanted to
[1:08:58] show his children look you are never
[1:09:00] alone
[1:09:02] there is a super there's a supernatural
[1:09:04] force and the Bible says only the redeem
[1:09:06] or brother REM said only the redeemed to
[1:09:08] have angels
[1:09:09] only day okay that's the difference
[1:09:11] already so there is someone who protects
[1:09:14] you along the way and he will protect
[1:09:17] you in 2023
[1:09:19] that is the message not the critical
[1:09:21] part yes can it be uh is it is there a
[1:09:25] blunt Angel no matter how the angel but
[1:09:27] the message is so important
[1:09:29] it's the same for a minister you must
[1:09:31] wanting to understand the minister if
[1:09:34] not you're always hanging about the
[1:09:38] little little little Expressions here
[1:09:40] and there and and that's so important so
[1:09:43] we are not alone
[1:09:45] and you're not alone you have
[1:09:48] there's an angel that goes with you
[1:09:51] brother Branham never invented
[1:09:53] theophonies
[1:09:55] but he was the first messenger who could
[1:09:58] see in the other dimension
[1:10:00] he even if if Martin Luther if he would
[1:10:03] talk about Theophilus with Martin Luther
[1:10:05] now he would say uh stop that mystical
[1:10:07] nonsense
[1:10:08] it was not his time but here this is the
[1:10:12] time of the manifestation of the Sons
[1:10:14] and Daughters of God
[1:10:15] brother for us the Rapture is the most
[1:10:18] easy thing that is in the world the
[1:10:20] Rapture is just a normal step with us
[1:10:22] because we are already in the process
[1:10:25] they don't have a denominational thought
[1:10:27] of living in New Zealand and and just
[1:10:29] following the All Blacks all your life
[1:10:31] and here comes God is just changing you
[1:10:33] you are already in the process of the
[1:10:35] rapture
[1:10:36] you're already in it okay you're still
[1:10:39] living in laodicea but in your heart
[1:10:41] you're already in bright age
[1:10:42] you talk another language than every
[1:10:45] kiwi
[1:10:47] amen your heart is different and still
[1:10:50] you live here in that country can you
[1:10:52] say Amen make the next one please so we
[1:10:54] understand this I mean that that that
[1:10:58] before I answer to this uh this was the
[1:11:01] beginning of seven Church ages
[1:11:04] and we sold yesterday that the church
[1:11:07] was already a fallen Woman by the first
[1:11:10] messenger came
[1:11:12] though they had a true Pentecost but we
[1:11:16] understood that they did not know who
[1:11:18] they were
[1:11:19] I mean as Peter was the spokesman
[1:11:23] but Paul was the angel
[1:11:26] I'm and only the angel gets the mystery
[1:11:29] for the church age
[1:11:31] therefore she was a fallen woman right
[1:11:33] when Paul already came that that is so
[1:11:36] important to see God allowed it
[1:11:39] that the first church would fall Paul
[1:11:42] said uh because I showed it to you
[1:11:45] yesterday those who are here for today
[1:11:47] for the first time you look the book of
[1:11:49] Acts and they never said oh praise the
[1:11:52] Lord and first Messengers here they
[1:11:54] didn't know what the messenger was
[1:11:55] because that was installed on the Isle
[1:11:58] of Patmos in the vision that that John
[1:12:00] has for them Peter was the man of the
[1:12:03] hour but Peter never had the mystery it
[1:12:05] was Paul who had the mystery the first
[1:12:07] church never fell in sin because they
[1:12:09] had they were full of the Holy Ghost but
[1:12:11] they didn't know who they were and
[1:12:13] therefore amen it was like the second
[1:12:15] Eve who fell
[1:12:17] definitely so so this was the beginning
[1:12:20] now here is our story
[1:12:22] and it might Comfort your life
[1:12:25] because we have a Prophet by the name of
[1:12:27] Jonah
[1:12:29] and brother Brandon makes sure
[1:12:31] he was a prophet don't feel sorry with
[1:12:34] Jonah
[1:12:36] he was a prophet
[1:12:38] don't feel sorry
[1:12:40] please
[1:12:41] if you have a theophany don't feel sorry
[1:12:44] for yourself
[1:12:45] I'm not a great man because I'm coming
[1:12:47] to you from Germany to preach you I'm a
[1:12:49] great man because I'm a son of God
[1:12:52] at home I'm a janitor but I'm the same
[1:12:54] Marcus Becker
[1:12:56] the same Marcus back are cleaning the
[1:12:58] floors the same but in me I'm a son of a
[1:13:01] king
[1:13:02] I don't need audience to feel myself
[1:13:04] well
[1:13:06] amen because I know who I am and you
[1:13:09] know who you are
[1:13:10] this message showed us our true identity
[1:13:14] in the Garden of Eden nobody could even
[1:13:16] explain to Eve who she was
[1:13:19] amen she went to Mr elephant Mr elephant
[1:13:22] I would like to know what we are doing
[1:13:23] here an elephant said look I mean
[1:13:25] they're so wonderful to be in this God
[1:13:27] but I don't know where I'm coming from
[1:13:29] amen there was only one who could
[1:13:31] explain to Eve from where she comes and
[1:13:33] that was Adam
[1:13:35] and there is only one who can explain
[1:13:37] the the bride from where she comes and
[1:13:39] that is Christ himself no denomination
[1:13:41] could bring you that way
[1:13:43] can you say Amen
[1:13:45] that's so important to see so so we have
[1:13:48] a Prophet by the name of Jonah and he
[1:13:50] hears the voice and he knows what he
[1:13:52] should do
[1:13:53] and instead of going to Nineveh then he
[1:13:57] he he decided to to uh to go to take his
[1:14:02] ship to Tarsus
[1:14:04] and you said brother Ben something that
[1:14:06] is a paradox
[1:14:08] he said Jonah wasn't out of the will of
[1:14:11] God Jonah was in the will of the Lord
[1:14:14] so we think sometimes this brother is a
[1:14:16] pure disaster and this is a disaster but
[1:14:19] if you are a son of God nothing is a
[1:14:22] disaster
[1:14:24] God sees the end from the beginning
[1:14:28] God God knew one thing he's the father
[1:14:33] God knew I want I I'm not there to bless
[1:14:37] Jonah
[1:14:39] Jonah is blessed
[1:14:41] because he's a prophet of the Lord but
[1:14:44] there is a hundred and twenty thousand
[1:14:45] people that I want to save
[1:14:48] so they have a certain mind up so what I
[1:14:50] have to do as Jehovah God I have to come
[1:14:53] to them according to their understanding
[1:14:57] in other words they have to talk their
[1:14:59] language I have to come down so that
[1:15:02] they understand what I want to do
[1:15:04] but but I cannot send an arrogant uh
[1:15:09] israelian minister to them
[1:15:13] a man without the Holy Ghost he says
[1:15:15] look
[1:15:16] God told me for you to repent about
[1:15:18] you're not repenting anyhow so I'm happy
[1:15:20] that I see the fire falling man
[1:15:22] that was that because if you weren't
[1:15:24] Israel
[1:15:25] for them you were nothing
[1:15:28] you see so you can see how In Jonah he
[1:15:31] was so frustrated
[1:15:33] that God showed love and mercy even to
[1:15:36] the Gentiles
[1:15:37] can you say Amen
[1:15:39] definitely so no no I mean exactly God
[1:15:43] God is always correcting the error
[1:15:45] therefore he left Tarsus and Tarsus was
[1:15:49] the city where Peter came from exactly
[1:15:53] and Peter had the same opinion like like
[1:15:56] like like Jonah he said that's just
[1:16:00] wonderful but I will not go to these
[1:16:02] heathens amen and God showed him a
[1:16:04] vision God is always correcting the
[1:16:07] arrow the same city Tarsus
[1:16:09] blessed be the name but because God he
[1:16:11] had in his mind to be a father
[1:16:13] so he just thought he could flee God
[1:16:17] and sometimes God leads our way
[1:16:21] and it seems such a mistake and such a
[1:16:24] drama and such a disaster and God knows
[1:16:26] one thing I'm in control of everything
[1:16:28] it's my son
[1:16:29] so whatever happens to a person please
[1:16:34] do not frustrate nobody with your
[1:16:36] comments
[1:16:37] I mean because a man of God is in the
[1:16:40] hands of Gods
[1:16:41] and the daughter of God is in the hands
[1:16:43] of God
[1:16:44] we can pray for every situation but we
[1:16:47] always have to say Lord you know better
[1:16:50] brother brother I will deal with it this
[1:16:53] afternoon and I'm taking care of people
[1:16:55] who went left the message and who come
[1:16:57] back
[1:16:58] one of the curses in a local church
[1:17:01] is if there is a family problem or is
[1:17:04] there if there is a problem with young
[1:17:06] people or marriage or whatever and half
[1:17:09] of the church now tries to intervene
[1:17:11] into that situation
[1:17:13] it it makes it impossible to get a
[1:17:16] solution
[1:17:17] because I tell you if you're not
[1:17:19] equipped you will never see the picture
[1:17:22] you have your opinion you will just
[1:17:24] radicalize both sides
[1:17:26] you have to keep sometimes people out of
[1:17:29] that area so that God can speak to them
[1:17:32] personally
[1:17:34] can you say Amen
[1:17:36] so we see that God allowed for the first
[1:17:39] church to fall
[1:17:41] as Paul was not in the upper room
[1:17:45] brother Brennan was not in Azusa Street
[1:17:48] it had to be because if Paul would have
[1:17:50] been on the upper room and would have
[1:17:52] been recognized as the first messenger
[1:17:54] that church would have gone
[1:17:55] I would have went
[1:17:57] but God knew there are some kiwis some
[1:17:59] South Africans some Germans they want to
[1:18:00] be saved and God says we have to amen we
[1:18:03] have to stop the time a little bit I
[1:18:04] mean as as Paul said I'm a man born out
[1:18:08] of seasons in other words I came too
[1:18:10] late brother said I'm like Paul I'm a
[1:18:12] man born out of seasons
[1:18:15] um so first the outpouring of the Holy
[1:18:17] Ghost comes the falling of the church
[1:18:19] and here comes the messenger
[1:18:21] I mean God allows it because he has
[1:18:23] still people who should come in the
[1:18:25] future I mean make the next one please
[1:18:27] so we see this
[1:18:30] so we see how the Dark Ages come it's a
[1:18:34] spirit it's a Doctrine it's nicolasm
[1:18:37] it's it's it's it's it's it's
[1:18:40] um uh uh uh
[1:18:43] balamism whatever I mean and then it is
[1:18:47] a that little wife of Jezebel okay Dark
[1:18:51] Ages
[1:18:52] now this is German
[1:18:54] and I forgot to translate it but at
[1:18:56] least you can show how much I'm studying
[1:19:00] [Laughter]
[1:19:03] but when Reformation came
[1:19:06] the reason for reformation was not very
[1:19:09] spiritual at all
[1:19:13] that was just a money question okay you
[1:19:16] see for example you have the Anglican
[1:19:18] Church
[1:19:19] and I think it was one of the Kings
[1:19:22] Henry VII I'm not very very sure Henry
[1:19:25] the 8th or the sixth he wanted to he won
[1:19:27] he he was married to a young girl a
[1:19:31] queen from Spain
[1:19:33] so he wanted to be divorced from that
[1:19:36] little girl because she couldn't bear
[1:19:38] children and a king wants to have a
[1:19:40] successor he wants to have a Sons so he
[1:19:42] asked for divorce but the problem is
[1:19:44] they were catholic okay and normally he
[1:19:48] could now the Catholic church in Rome
[1:19:50] would have said there's no problem we
[1:19:52] were divorcing we are annuling that
[1:19:54] marriage but the problem is she came
[1:19:57] from Spain and Spain was more Catholic
[1:20:00] than England
[1:20:01] so the English king could only one say
[1:20:04] one thing
[1:20:06] um we feel on our hearts to have a
[1:20:09] Reformation
[1:20:11] but that was not spiritually because he
[1:20:13] wanted to marry again
[1:20:14] okay so so so we have the lutherans we
[1:20:18] have the those who are re-baptized and
[1:20:20] we have the calvinist
[1:20:22] now as we were learning
[1:20:25] Calvin was a man
[1:20:29] in he was a French living in in
[1:20:33] Switzerland that is correct yeah even
[1:20:35] the Swiss Swiss will not acknowledge it
[1:20:37] but he was French living in Switzerland
[1:20:39] that's what we learned from the Paul
[1:20:40] definitely so huh and
[1:20:43] for him that extreme Calvinism said you
[1:20:47] have to you are you are either chosen or
[1:20:50] you're not chosen yeah for the bride
[1:20:52] it's okay but not for the church okay
[1:20:54] your chosen your nachos
[1:20:57] and you have to prove
[1:21:00] your Choosing by being successfully in
[1:21:05] your uh business
[1:21:09] a true calvinist is working all day
[1:21:14] not spending money
[1:21:17] holiday is sin for them
[1:21:21] that is a calvinist
[1:21:23] life is working and praying nothing else
[1:21:28] amen that is the calvinist
[1:21:31] now you have to understand if I if we
[1:21:34] want to become calvinist let me say who
[1:21:37] wants to become calvinist nobody okay
[1:21:38] but
[1:21:39] I'm forcing you to become calvinist okay
[1:21:43] so what we are doing now we have in our
[1:21:45] wonderful church let me say maybe 200
[1:21:47] people maybe some more some less no
[1:21:49] matter different one two three four no
[1:21:51] okay oh
[1:21:53] and I'm forced you to become calvinist
[1:21:58] if you want to change people's life
[1:22:02] without the Holy Spirit you can only do
[1:22:05] it by force
[1:22:08] that is the spirit of denominations
[1:22:12] in the message
[1:22:14] and out of the message
[1:22:17] or you have to give them an impression
[1:22:19] of we are so super special
[1:22:23] we are the Eagles of the message we are
[1:22:26] came out because we are more we are
[1:22:28] higher we are what we call an elite
[1:22:32] we have seen these things over and over
[1:22:34] I looked at the doctrines that came we
[1:22:37] are the Elite out of it we are the super
[1:22:38] Eagles and it
[1:22:40] sometimes Brother people say brother
[1:22:42] Marcus you are traveling please preach
[1:22:44] against false doctrines I always say
[1:22:46] this I will not waste my time because
[1:22:47] brother braeme said everything that had
[1:22:49] a beginning will have an end
[1:22:51] uh
[1:22:55] so let's read
[1:22:56] and if I'm forcing you
[1:23:00] I can only Force You by an extreme
[1:23:02] control and by fear
[1:23:05] definitely so and it came to pass that
[1:23:07] that in under Calvin
[1:23:11] families and people were observing one
[1:23:14] another
[1:23:15] I mean for example you go into uh you
[1:23:18] pass by the streets
[1:23:20] and you see a light a window and you see
[1:23:24] some blue lights flickering
[1:23:26] fluent and you could see that that must
[1:23:29] be a television
[1:23:31] oh oh Pastor I know something
[1:23:36] we have to pray for family Becca
[1:23:39] it seems they are looking they are
[1:23:42] looking Western John Wayne and so forth
[1:23:46] sin in the camp
[1:23:48] that was the thing so everybody was
[1:23:51] under under control one was controlling
[1:23:54] the other
[1:23:55] and you can imagine that pressure that
[1:23:58] was upon that people working making
[1:24:00] money if you were not successfully
[1:24:03] Spirit economically it means you are not
[1:24:06] chosen of Gods definitely so I mean
[1:24:10] therefore what I said yesterday please
[1:24:12] my range of possibilities is is a little
[1:24:15] bit limited as I said yesterday
[1:24:17] keep the Sunday keep it to be the Sunday
[1:24:21] I take care of people of young people I
[1:24:24] go to university they go to school I
[1:24:26] always tell them don't learn on a Sunday
[1:24:28] take take Monday to Saturday to do your
[1:24:31] work and leave it up to God for Sunday
[1:24:34] so I but if for example you have
[1:24:36] barbecue on Sunday that's not a sin
[1:24:39] if you invite me
[1:24:42] but that's not a problem but it's just
[1:24:44] an example I want to say don't make
[1:24:46] Sunday a common day please not Sunday is
[1:24:49] a holy day before the Lord every day is
[1:24:51] the holy day I know this but God has
[1:24:54] special times for us okay
[1:24:56] so we see that out of these kind of
[1:25:00] calvinistic thought Reformation thought
[1:25:04] the pilgrim fathers came out of it
[1:25:07] and these people they were holy
[1:25:10] and they were more holy
[1:25:12] and a real reformed person is extremely
[1:25:17] determinated
[1:25:19] amen he's determinated
[1:25:22] this was the beginning of what we call
[1:25:25] as a a Christian Christian or
[1:25:29] Evangelical or be Protestant working
[1:25:33] ethics
[1:25:35] that was the beginning you work you earn
[1:25:38] you have success you please God
[1:25:40] it was very successful in the world
[1:25:43] because you can see all the Catholic
[1:25:45] countries are poor
[1:25:47] and all the Protestant countries became
[1:25:49] rich
[1:25:50] because working was part of the religion
[1:25:54] uh have you ever heard do you have that
[1:25:56] word here in New Zealand what we call
[1:25:58] stealing God's time
[1:26:00] have you ever heard about that it's very
[1:26:02] common in Germany that is the typical
[1:26:04] thought of don't hang around don't sit
[1:26:06] around don't steal God's time do
[1:26:08] something work something that comes
[1:26:11] exactly from that Minds thought
[1:26:13] now here we have people they are holy
[1:26:16] they are clean
[1:26:18] and and they are determined they work
[1:26:21] they they they they they they they they
[1:26:22] they they they they they never hang
[1:26:24] around very disciplined
[1:26:28] it is the beginning of what we would
[1:26:30] call the Prosperity Gospel there it
[1:26:33] takes its beginning when brother Brahm
[1:26:35] said if God blesses you you got a
[1:26:37] Cadillac
[1:26:39] that was the beginning
[1:26:41] of that thought
[1:26:44] big church
[1:26:46] big Ministry
[1:26:48] big blessing small Church oh that's just
[1:26:52] brother Marcus God bless you
[1:26:55] that is the mindset more people more
[1:26:58] favor of God
[1:27:00] pure human way of thinking has nothing
[1:27:04] to do with a spiritual man not at all
[1:27:07] therefore I'm traveling sometimes to
[1:27:09] little groups
[1:27:10] and and just saying sharing but good
[1:27:14] people
[1:27:15] nine out of ten times I'm coming there
[1:27:17] and here comes the pastor the elders or
[1:27:19] some oh brother Marcus you have to you
[1:27:21] have to forgive but we are just a
[1:27:22] handful of people
[1:27:24] I said okay shall we now repent or what
[1:27:26] should we do about that
[1:27:29] do you feel sorry for yourself I'm not
[1:27:31] feeling sorry for myself because if you
[1:27:33] have five eagles so praise the Lord
[1:27:36] I tell you I prefer to five people who
[1:27:39] are who love the message instead 200 who
[1:27:42] sleep after 10 minutes already
[1:27:44] it's not the quantity brother it is the
[1:27:47] quality of people honest
[1:27:50] if you wanna if you want to be spiritual
[1:27:52] don't have a human way of thinking
[1:27:55] but these people are disciplined but I
[1:27:58] tell you one thing
[1:27:59] many people who are over disciplined who
[1:28:02] are successful
[1:28:05] they lose the feeling for the feeble
[1:28:08] person
[1:28:10] it is a winners religion
[1:28:14] it is for those who are strong
[1:28:17] who are brave
[1:28:19] but that Messenger changed that picture
[1:28:21] completely
[1:28:22] God allowed that he is a man who is
[1:28:25] standing in his own way
[1:28:27] to show that God has a way for the weak
[1:28:30] months Among Us for the feeble ones
[1:28:33] but from this kind of reformation now
[1:28:36] all the churches the Methodist the
[1:28:38] Baptists the Reformed Church the
[1:28:41] Mennonites all come out of them
[1:28:43] definitely so
[1:28:45] good people
[1:28:47] children of their time
[1:28:49] don't forget that was God's time for
[1:28:52] them it was not more revealed
[1:28:55] disciplined hearts if you are hard to
[1:28:59] yourself
[1:29:00] you become hard to others
[1:29:03] if you don't forgive yourself that is
[1:29:05] what some of the people I I cannot
[1:29:07] forgive me that I was forgetting this
[1:29:08] and this that is a typical form
[1:29:11] of being over disciplined with yourself
[1:29:13] you don't want to acknowledge that you
[1:29:16] live in a body who is not born again
[1:29:19] amen and you're now trying to change or
[1:29:22] to to to discipline that mammal
[1:29:26] and that brings you to a constant
[1:29:28] frustration
[1:29:29] if the Holy Spirit doesn't change you
[1:29:32] but you want to be changed to have a
[1:29:34] good appearance to other you choose the
[1:29:36] religious way
[1:29:38] that is now torture for your own
[1:29:41] children because the church does not
[1:29:44] wait until they are born again they must
[1:29:46] fit into the church
[1:29:48] that is a true disaster sometimes God
[1:29:52] calls us out into a disaster so that we
[1:29:55] think twice
[1:29:56] brother Branham said it like this and
[1:29:58] that is so nice
[1:30:00] you see job one day he he said to God if
[1:30:05] I could just knock at his door
[1:30:08] and God says in Revelation 3 you don't
[1:30:11] have to come to me to knock my door but
[1:30:13] I come to you I will knock at your door
[1:30:17] and brother mam said this job was
[1:30:20] perfect
[1:30:21] you know we all love to have families
[1:30:24] to have here's Papa Mama
[1:30:28] and then the children
[1:30:33] but God wants to move our
[1:30:39] clue make difficulties
[1:30:41] to see how we deal in the church with
[1:30:44] them
[1:30:46] I told you that little group that I'm
[1:30:48] taking care of I said if we treat people
[1:30:50] the right way God will send to us a lot
[1:30:53] of problems but but every church is a
[1:30:56] hospital
[1:30:59] but don't stay in that hospital
[1:31:02] amen be transformed and brother I have
[1:31:05] seen how God takes
[1:31:07] heals people from alcoholism from all
[1:31:10] kinds of perversion brings them back on
[1:31:13] their feet but takes a lot of love to do
[1:31:15] this
[1:31:16] can you say Amen so here's what brother
[1:31:19] brim said to to to to to to uh to to Joe
[1:31:22] about job he said job was such a perfect
[1:31:25] man but God said I would like to talk to
[1:31:28] you
[1:31:29] therefore he brought all that drama in
[1:31:32] his life everybody would say look what a
[1:31:35] Ministry and now that man is finished
[1:31:37] and he's finished and he's finished if
[1:31:39] you're a Son of God you're never
[1:31:40] finished
[1:31:41] never finished because I have a
[1:31:43] theophany
[1:31:44] I have a theophany I'm never finished
[1:31:46] maybe my Ministry is finished but that's
[1:31:48] not my most important thing I might see
[1:31:50] offer he doesn't become bigger because I
[1:31:51] get more invitation
[1:31:54] and it will not become smaller because I
[1:31:55] get no invitation anymore I live in
[1:31:58] another world
[1:31:59] can you say Amen so God sometime brings
[1:32:03] a lot of problems in our life because he
[1:32:04] likes to talk to us he feels that we are
[1:32:07] a little bit too religious
[1:32:09] every religious spirit is an arrogant
[1:32:12] spirit
[1:32:13] you can smear you can smell it you can
[1:32:15] feel oh first we despising all the
[1:32:19] unbelievers
[1:32:21] second thing we can walk over
[1:32:23] denomination like we want
[1:32:25] third we can walk about all the
[1:32:27] Pentecostals in the message in their
[1:32:29] word and nothing and and at the end it's
[1:32:32] only Us in my family who will make it's
[1:32:35] it it's a dead end
[1:32:38] can you say Amen
[1:32:40] so we are fighting against exactly this
[1:32:44] brother Marcus
[1:32:45] can that happen brother we come all out
[1:32:48] of these things
[1:32:49] I I preach about myself because we have
[1:32:53] that attitude and maybe we still have it
[1:32:55] but I said Lord I will not enter into
[1:32:57] heaven with that attitudes
[1:32:59] for me change me
[1:33:02] show me so much reality that I can bear
[1:33:05] with my brother who doesn't see it
[1:33:06] anymore
[1:33:07] the Bible says if somebody is is strong
[1:33:11] that he may help his weak brother
[1:33:14] not to despise and say oh man no
[1:33:17] revelation
[1:33:19] I tell you this and here you have it
[1:33:21] here my Eagle tie
[1:33:24] Eagle Bells Revelation 10 7.
[1:33:28] we we went through these things
[1:33:30] but the eagle must be in our hearts
[1:33:33] brother
[1:33:34] a loving Spirit you know who you are you
[1:33:38] know what Grace is now you can give
[1:33:40] Grace to your brother
[1:33:41] even you disagree but you say heavenly
[1:33:44] father the same one who gave me
[1:33:46] Revelation is the same who will give him
[1:33:48] revelation
[1:33:49] in his time
[1:33:51] can you say Amen
[1:33:54] amen make the next one please amen amen
[1:33:57] so here we have
[1:33:59] that is typical the what we call in
[1:34:01] Germany the pietists the Pirates loves
[1:34:05] to study the word which is not wrong in
[1:34:07] itself and to live a holy life which is
[1:34:10] okay which is fine only by the Holy
[1:34:12] Spirit but this is a typical picture of
[1:34:15] what we call the Puritans in the U.S
[1:34:18] okay the Puritans have their origin in
[1:34:22] the pilgrim fathers okay determined
[1:34:25] people so
[1:34:27] the picture speaks for itself the right
[1:34:31] one okay there's two things in life work
[1:34:35] and church
[1:34:38] and you can see how happy both are
[1:34:41] looking
[1:34:46] long hair
[1:34:47] long dress long face
[1:34:51] brother that is the spirit of
[1:34:53] denominationalism
[1:34:57] on what base will I enter into the into
[1:35:00] the Rapture because I'm more holy and I
[1:35:02] come to church Wednesday Sunday we're
[1:35:04] doing this that's fine but that's not
[1:35:08] the the Rapture is not a reward system
[1:35:11] it's not a bonus system
[1:35:14] God says okay how often and pain ties
[1:35:16] and brother you go to the Rapture
[1:35:18] because we have a theophany
[1:35:20] you were born with it
[1:35:22] it is older than you yourself
[1:35:25] if my Earthly body will be dissolved I
[1:35:27] have already a building
[1:35:30] which is eternal
[1:35:32] coming to church reading the message
[1:35:34] praying is expression of our gratitude
[1:35:36] to God
[1:35:38] blessed be the name of the Lord all the
[1:35:41] rest leads you into
[1:35:43] I want to be honest I want I want to
[1:35:45] kill that thing
[1:35:46] We Were Young in the message man we're
[1:35:49] still young but not young as we were
[1:35:53] so I was thinking we have a church a big
[1:35:55] church and I thought if God wants to
[1:35:57] choose who is going to the Rapture who
[1:35:59] will go and I thought by myself okay
[1:36:01] there's many people in the church that
[1:36:03] don't come on Wednesday
[1:36:05] and we have three services per week
[1:36:07] Friday Wednesday and even less come on
[1:36:10] Friday I was one who came Sunday
[1:36:12] Wednesday Friday
[1:36:15] so I thought okay
[1:36:17] okay
[1:36:19] it's not too bad it's not too bad okay
[1:36:22] then I went to Paris to a church because
[1:36:26] I thought God is just honoring our labor
[1:36:29] and then that is the that is our our
[1:36:31] entrance our ticket to go to to to to to
[1:36:33] to heaven or for the Rapture then I went
[1:36:36] to France and we had two services
[1:36:39] in uh during the day in Paris so morning
[1:36:43] service was over
[1:36:44] and we all went to a McDonald's to eat
[1:36:47] something and uh
[1:36:48] afternoon service was there a couple
[1:36:50] hours later like five or six and here
[1:36:53] was the wife of the pastor
[1:36:55] and I asked the pastor what is she doing
[1:36:57] he says now she all the time she's just
[1:37:00] sitting there and praying for the
[1:37:02] afternoon service
[1:37:04] so I saw by myself if God has to choose
[1:37:11] who prayed the most
[1:37:16] you see it's a dead end
[1:37:19] it must be the grace of God
[1:37:23] we don't have a chance Brothers we don't
[1:37:25] have a chance you don't have a chance
[1:37:26] and I don't have a chance because
[1:37:27] because I was talking to my my Congolese
[1:37:30] brother in France I said hey that's so
[1:37:32] wonderful we're making all night prayer
[1:37:34] meeting together you know what they told
[1:37:36] me was these white people after 20
[1:37:39] minutes they're all sleeping anyhow
[1:37:42] and it's true
[1:37:45] try to make an all-night prayer meeting
[1:37:47] with the show you will see
[1:37:49] so I said Lord if you want to bring me
[1:37:51] home it must be on another level than
[1:37:53] this
[1:37:54] might be different than this okay okay
[1:37:57] here we go make the next one please so
[1:37:58] here we see amen and and I want you to
[1:38:02] now to be spiritual amen
[1:38:05] because who knows what the picture is
[1:38:08] definitely so okay definitely so here
[1:38:12] this is South Africa this is what we
[1:38:14] call the the tractors
[1:38:18] four trackers definitely so man these
[1:38:22] these people
[1:38:23] had a vision to inherit their land I
[1:38:27] mean they went with their dragons over
[1:38:29] mountains
[1:38:31] fighting whatever
[1:38:34] you want to speak about determination
[1:38:37] that is determination brother
[1:38:40] amen that is if you would tell to them
[1:38:42] we have now Church the whole day yes
[1:38:45] let's go for it
[1:38:47] more suffering was more blessing to them
[1:38:52] if I would say look I have for my heart
[1:38:54] if we're not eating this midday
[1:38:57] we're preaching
[1:38:58] till six in the evening and then I'm
[1:39:00] waiting can you say amen and halfway
[1:39:02] would say praise the Lord we're waiting
[1:39:03] for this
[1:39:05] they all thinking about oh I hope you
[1:39:07] get horse
[1:39:08] [Laughter]
[1:39:16] even more pressure to the people it
[1:39:18] works for some
[1:39:20] but not for Marcus
[1:39:22] not for me it must be love it must it
[1:39:25] must come automatically
[1:39:26] so please understand one thing don't be
[1:39:30] carnal I'm not a German
[1:39:33] I live in a German tent
[1:39:36] you're not a South African forget it
[1:39:39] Esther had two names she was Esther and
[1:39:42] she was Hadassah that was the true name
[1:39:44] you have a true ident you are not a KIVI
[1:39:47] forget about that
[1:39:49] All Blacks yes if you're a fan of All
[1:39:51] Blacks I would say nothing against it
[1:39:54] but that don't fight for New Zealand
[1:39:56] please not fight for your kingdom
[1:40:02] have you ever seen that Jesus said okay
[1:40:04] let's make a demonstration those Romans
[1:40:07] we have to kick them out of Jerusalem
[1:40:09] and come all and what an injustice Jesus
[1:40:12] said my my kingdom is from above
[1:40:16] I'm just a little Pilgrim here on Earth
[1:40:19] but I'm not a KIVI I'm not a German
[1:40:22] that's what I always tell this I said I
[1:40:25] I I'm a very sympathetic type of person
[1:40:28] you say okay now full body control
[1:40:33] I said my only problem is I live in a
[1:40:35] German tent
[1:40:37] for 70 years
[1:40:38] but I live if I leave that tense I will
[1:40:41] be my true
[1:40:42] in my true identification
[1:40:45] don't look too much on that German tent
[1:40:48] that's not me I live in it but I'm
[1:40:51] another person
[1:40:53] you are not a don't fight for New
[1:40:56] Zealand don't fight for South Africa
[1:40:58] don't fight for Maori don't fight for
[1:41:00] German fight for your true Kingdom
[1:41:05] amen can you say Amen
[1:41:07] so determination is great
[1:41:11] but it will not help us for the rapture
[1:41:14] can you say Amen
[1:41:16] okay let me see somebody
[1:41:19] the brother who you're looking strong
[1:41:21] okay you come with me okay
[1:41:27] okay no no I find so we are now both
[1:41:31] going into the Rapture okay
[1:41:34] we are going up okay so let's try to go
[1:41:37] up okay you you help yourself like me
[1:41:39] okay
[1:41:40] okay come on no no I I can't do this the
[1:41:43] same but you have to put your feet on
[1:41:45] okay
[1:41:45] okay you get it
[1:41:49] you make it
[1:41:50] no
[1:41:51] so we're in the same league okay
[1:41:55] you understand
[1:41:57] God has to pick us up
[1:42:00] it must be God if not
[1:42:02] determination is fine
[1:42:04] but it will not help you for the rapture
[1:42:08] determination is part of our religious
[1:42:11] part but it's not the main thing
[1:42:13] Holiness is part of the message but it's
[1:42:15] not the main thing of the message it's
[1:42:17] part of Christianity but it's not more
[1:42:20] holy more rapture
[1:42:23] because every Muslim can be holy
[1:42:26] no that's not what it is I mean God
[1:42:28] takes back
[1:42:29] his nature next one amen so here we go I
[1:42:33] mean here's what brother Graham says he
[1:42:35] sees it
[1:42:36] in closing our comments on this verse
[1:42:38] thou has to name that thou livest and
[1:42:40] are dead Lutheran H I cannot impress
[1:42:44] upon you too strong that this stage
[1:42:46] through it was brought the Reformation
[1:42:48] was most sternly rebuked by God instead
[1:42:50] of being praised because it sought the
[1:42:53] seed of denominations that organized
[1:42:56] direct right back to the halot after God
[1:42:58] had opened the door okay
[1:43:01] I would continue a little bit thus
[1:43:04] instead of this being a great spiritual
[1:43:07] move with all the earmarks of Holy
[1:43:09] Spirit influence as when God
[1:43:12] you use purely spiritual means to
[1:43:15] accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was
[1:43:17] indeed a work wherein the wrath of man
[1:43:21] was the wrath of men praise God and the
[1:43:25] results parallel the history of Israel
[1:43:27] when they when they left Egypt and so
[1:43:29] forth
[1:43:30] so these people were holy but full of
[1:43:34] Wrath
[1:43:36] brother sometimes you have a you have a
[1:43:40] you have a city with two message
[1:43:42] churches
[1:43:43] and they cannot shake their hands
[1:43:45] brother I tell you something is wrong
[1:43:48] something is is deeply wrong and in
[1:43:51] death soul and in this heart
[1:43:54] brother the other problem you are too
[1:43:55] much a Lutheran you better convert
[1:43:58] yourself and become like your father
[1:44:00] but they don't believe like we believe
[1:44:03] but there is certain Fellowship that you
[1:44:05] can show your respect and show your
[1:44:07] friendship and show look we believe we
[1:44:10] have the same father
[1:44:11] can you say Amen
[1:44:14] blessed I don't speak about strange
[1:44:16] doctrines that's about something else
[1:44:17] but sudden believing the same thing pure
[1:44:20] canality purely amen next one please
[1:44:24] amen here we go
[1:44:26] here's brother Branham and he takes the
[1:44:28] Hebrew series he says therefore and he
[1:44:31] reads Hebrews chapter 3 leaving the
[1:44:34] principles of the doctrines of Christ
[1:44:37] the atoned one which pushed towards thee
[1:44:39] now I can read it's blowed out and not
[1:44:42] laying again the form here we are says
[1:44:45] brother Abraham in the Hebrew serious
[1:44:46] not laying again the form of reformation
[1:44:50] from Works causing death
[1:44:56] now this lexicon is absolutely not in
[1:44:58] any interpretation at all it's just a
[1:45:00] Greek word for what the English says it
[1:45:02] says now we don't want listen here not
[1:45:05] laying down foundations of reformation
[1:45:07] from Works causing death now if you will
[1:45:11] get that in your mind that he's speaking
[1:45:13] here forms of reformation causes death
[1:45:15] Paul said leaving the principles go to
[1:45:18] perfection
[1:45:21] not laying again the foundation of
[1:45:23] repentance from that works to Faith
[1:45:25] towards God's doctrines of baptism
[1:45:27] laying offense resurrection of the Dead
[1:45:29] Eternal judgment reforming Reformation
[1:45:32] from from forms Reformation forms
[1:45:37] causing death that's the right words
[1:45:39] that's actually what Paul wrote see what
[1:45:42] he's trying to do
[1:45:45] they were children of their time but
[1:45:47] brother Brian shows in the Hebrew Syria
[1:45:49] if you want to enter into Perfection you
[1:45:51] have to forget these principles
[1:45:53] completely
[1:45:56] understand what went wrong in seven
[1:45:59] Church ages and buried that thing
[1:46:02] and says hey we have children of our
[1:46:04] father
[1:46:05] we one day will inherit the Kingdom
[1:46:08] can you say Amen
[1:46:10] make the next one please here we go amen
[1:46:13] so we have seen the Reformation at his
[1:46:16] time and we see the Pentecostal age
[1:46:20] and I want you to put on your spiritual
[1:46:22] jacket
[1:46:24] justification sanctification
[1:46:27] look at a man like John Wesley
[1:46:30] extremely determined
[1:46:33] fully disciplined
[1:46:35] amen but he didn't know what Grace was
[1:46:38] he came his mother was Susana Wesley
[1:46:40] Brothers speaks about him her I mean
[1:46:43] Susanna Wesley was extremely disciplined
[1:46:45] with 12 children she had time half a
[1:46:48] week for a half a half an hour every
[1:46:50] week everything in the life of John
[1:46:53] Wesley was a to-do list
[1:46:55] three hours prayer in the evening he had
[1:46:59] to fulfill his to-do list
[1:47:01] there were two things that changed the
[1:47:03] course of of John Wesley
[1:47:07] the first one was this John Wesley was
[1:47:09] was was was asked to pray for somebody
[1:47:14] who will be hanging to the next day and
[1:47:15] delinquent
[1:47:17] okay John Wesley
[1:47:19] five Services per day
[1:47:22] five times per day he was preaching
[1:47:26] forget our Wednesday and Sunday forget
[1:47:28] it
[1:47:30] amen
[1:47:32] come
[1:47:33] come please to church and please make
[1:47:36] your family alter and please have every
[1:47:38] day time
[1:47:40] with the with your father eating the
[1:47:43] book
[1:47:44] amen
[1:47:45] but don't think that God is just saying
[1:47:47] wonderful you are there you were there
[1:47:49] you were okay you make the Rapture
[1:47:50] because you get the bonus program
[1:47:52] no
[1:47:53] five times John Wesley John Wesley is
[1:47:56] invited now for a delinquent who will be
[1:47:58] hanged the next day
[1:47:59] look and here he comes
[1:48:01] his whole day his whole life is
[1:48:05] professionally serving God
[1:48:08] every half hour something else that was
[1:48:10] John Wesley
[1:48:12] so he comes to that delinquent and he
[1:48:14] thinks and according to his own memories
[1:48:15] he says look
[1:48:17] I will give him the gospel
[1:48:19] he will refuse
[1:48:21] I would say okay I did my best Shalom
[1:48:24] God bless you heavenly father I'm so
[1:48:27] sorry for that man so sorry sorry okay
[1:48:29] what is the next program
[1:48:31] but the problem was when John Wesley
[1:48:33] gave Testament that man gave his heart
[1:48:34] to the Lord
[1:48:38] amen so he said himself that he was
[1:48:40] troubled what about this
[1:48:42] because he will be hanged the next day
[1:48:45] and
[1:48:47] gave his heart to the Lord so he could
[1:48:49] not say you are not saved because you
[1:48:51] never come to church
[1:48:53] because he knew one thing he's safe
[1:48:55] because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:48:57] so John Wesley thinks I mean if this man
[1:49:00] is safe he never paid his tithings
[1:49:03] he never came to church and I'm coming
[1:49:06] five times a day
[1:49:08] you understand he got a big problem in
[1:49:11] his son all his legalism
[1:49:14] had to crumble down
[1:49:18] God allows those things
[1:49:20] that we sometimes we are superior to
[1:49:24] those who don't come you don't do that
[1:49:26] I'm not saved by anything even not by
[1:49:29] brother Brandon but I'm safe because I
[1:49:31] have a father
[1:49:32] who paid the price for me
[1:49:34] can you say Amen so John Wesley
[1:49:37] continued in his own memory continued
[1:49:41] to serve the Lord the way how he did but
[1:49:45] he said himself I've knew now that I
[1:49:47] couldn't do anything to marriage
[1:49:49] salvation but I do it in order to thank
[1:49:52] God for what he did for my life
[1:49:55] that takes all religious Spirits away
[1:49:58] forget it every religious spirit is a
[1:50:01] spirit of of arrogance somehow we are
[1:50:04] better because of yeah amen all right
[1:50:08] you know the story of of of of of Martin
[1:50:11] Luther can you say Amen so far
[1:50:14] Martin Luther he hated gods
[1:50:17] because of Romans I think 1 21 where he
[1:50:20] says which speaks about the justice of
[1:50:22] God
[1:50:23] Martin Luther said I was praying more I
[1:50:26] was fasting more and I was hating that
[1:50:29] God because I found out whatever I do
[1:50:32] is not sufficient to enter into the
[1:50:35] kingdom of God
[1:50:36] have you ever seen this the more you
[1:50:38] want to be holy the more you see
[1:50:41] something in you which is not fitting
[1:50:43] into that picture
[1:50:44] for many many years we were young people
[1:50:46] in the message we we thought we were not
[1:50:48] born again
[1:50:49] because we have that kind of imagination
[1:50:51] we have this and we have this and we
[1:50:52] have that and and and and we were not
[1:50:55] really instructed to understand your new
[1:50:57] birth is deep in your hearts
[1:50:59] and then God takes a lot of time to now
[1:51:02] mold us into that image that he wants to
[1:51:04] have the new birth and the adoption is
[1:51:06] completely different amen but we were we
[1:51:10] were every prayer line we were there
[1:51:13] who wants to have the Holy Ghost
[1:51:15] we were there amen and it just hindered
[1:51:18] us
[1:51:19] I mean because there is a time when you
[1:51:21] have to have faith in what God did
[1:51:23] already for you
[1:51:25] amen look look
[1:51:28] so he was a German Professor for German
[1:51:32] language
[1:51:33] and he knew one thing and this seems to
[1:51:35] be technically but it's not technically
[1:51:37] it's very easy
[1:51:39] if you know German
[1:51:42] because the what we call the genitive
[1:51:45] has two possibilities
[1:51:47] I mean from the Latin okay
[1:51:50] to
[1:51:51] subject or object
[1:51:54] that means
[1:51:56] for if somebody say the fear of
[1:52:02] the Germans was great
[1:52:04] the fear or the German sphere was great
[1:52:08] was big
[1:52:10] can mean two things
[1:52:12] it means the Germans were fearing
[1:52:14] amen or we were fearing the Germans
[1:52:20] same genitive but completely different
[1:52:23] and and he was thinking about that he
[1:52:26] said the justice of God can mean I must
[1:52:29] be just to please God or God is my
[1:52:34] Justice
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:37] and when he found out this he said now
[1:52:40] the gates of paradise opened for me
[1:52:44] my Justice is the Lord's
[1:52:48] and in the that is the second thing that
[1:52:51] that that that that that John Wesley
[1:52:52] found out because he went to the church
[1:52:54] to eldest Gates
[1:52:56] and in that little church they were
[1:52:58] reading the preface of Martin Luther and
[1:53:02] Martin Luther for the book for the
[1:53:03] letter of the Romans and Martin Luther
[1:53:06] said look it's not our Justice to
[1:53:09] achieve something with God but it's
[1:53:11] God's justice that Sanctified us
[1:53:15] there and when they were reading this
[1:53:17] John Wesley said this I was strangely
[1:53:20] warmed in my hearts
[1:53:22] and he called this his second conversion
[1:53:26] can you say Amen
[1:53:28] amen so you see how God is showing it's
[1:53:32] him not us
[1:53:34] so here comes now the Pentecostal move
[1:53:37] that's what I said Reformation never
[1:53:40] produced The Bride legalism never worked
[1:53:44] amen the beginning of the Pentecostal
[1:53:47] movement was not Azusa Street
[1:53:50] everything is apart but in reality it
[1:53:53] started with the Welch Revival
[1:53:56] the Welsh Revival was not initiated by
[1:53:58] Evan Roberts he was the first prominent
[1:54:01] to enter is with
[1:54:02] but he was initiated by a young girl
[1:54:05] amen you put on your spiritual jacket
[1:54:09] because the Sunday school teacher asked
[1:54:13] her asked the class question
[1:54:16] what does Jesus mean to you
[1:54:19] and the first boy says Jesus he's the
[1:54:21] savior of the world he died at Calvary
[1:54:23] he he paid for my sins and then and the
[1:54:26] teacher said I don't want to hear some
[1:54:28] slogans
[1:54:30] I want to know what Jesus means to you
[1:54:32] and the girl stands up he said I love
[1:54:34] the Lord Jesus with all my heart
[1:54:37] and the spirit fell upon that whole
[1:54:39] group
[1:54:40] that was the beginning of what we call
[1:54:42] the Welsh Revival
[1:54:45] brother you ask a young person what does
[1:54:46] brother Brian mean for you I see he's
[1:54:48] the seventh angel I have here some uh we
[1:54:51] believe in all these things brother
[1:54:52] that's just slogans
[1:54:54] that's just slogans you must bring them
[1:54:57] to a reality who said that man brought
[1:54:58] me really to Christ
[1:55:00] that man opened the way so that man was
[1:55:02] elegator to find my heavenly bridegroom
[1:55:05] can you say Amen but that was the
[1:55:08] beginning the Welsh Revival of a concept
[1:55:11] and you put on your spiritual jacket
[1:55:13] because we were at the beginning more
[1:55:14] Pentecostal of a concept if the Holy
[1:55:17] Spirit Falls he falls upon a whole group
[1:55:20] and you feel it and you you you you you
[1:55:23] you you jump you shout you have a
[1:55:25] sensation you have an emotion you have
[1:55:27] all kind of things
[1:55:30] because that was the Outburst of the
[1:55:33] Holy Spirit on Azusa Street and in the
[1:55:36] Welsh Revival
[1:55:38] that was their time and it can happen
[1:55:40] all the time
[1:55:42] what we do today is to try some Bay
[1:55:45] limits we try by music to bring that
[1:55:47] same emotion
[1:55:48] but if the holy ghost fails you don't
[1:55:50] need music that must be sure amen you
[1:55:54] can use music not a problem amen
[1:55:57] but here comes that thing
[1:56:00] here's what brother Ben shows us
[1:56:02] that that all these things are fine all
[1:56:06] the emotions all the the blessings the
[1:56:09] baptisms of the Holy Ghost you know our
[1:56:11] spirit all these things absolutely
[1:56:13] amen
[1:56:15] but he shows us a human being is like a
[1:56:19] tabernacle
[1:56:21] and we are showing on Friday the first
[1:56:24] one who had a tenth Vision was Moses
[1:56:28] he was taking up in the presence of God
[1:56:30] and he saw the Tabernacle of God and
[1:56:33] build it on Earth and brother Brian said
[1:56:34] that's a human being
[1:56:36] in that Tabernacle is the Shekinah Glory
[1:56:42] is the Eternal Light
[1:56:43] now you put on your spiritual jacket
[1:56:46] brother Brian said in the message the
[1:56:49] unveiling of God
[1:56:51] he says you remember in the Bible it is
[1:56:53] said that that he had to cover his face
[1:56:57] because he was the glory of the Lord was
[1:56:59] so much shining upon Moses
[1:57:02] that correct
[1:57:03] and brother Abrahim said it was not so
[1:57:06] much that he was his skin was shining
[1:57:08] that's what we all thought he was in the
[1:57:10] presence of God and his skin was still
[1:57:11] shining from the presence of God but
[1:57:13] brother bear said this it was the word
[1:57:15] in him Shining
[1:57:19] that is our difference to the
[1:57:21] Pentecostal world
[1:57:23] therefore you are not searching just an
[1:57:25] emotion
[1:57:26] a good feeling a blessing you search
[1:57:30] that word that it will shine in your
[1:57:32] heart
[1:57:33] you search a substance not we had great
[1:57:36] meetings and nothing changed you search
[1:57:39] something that quickens that Eternal
[1:57:41] part that is in you
[1:57:43] and it can come with loudness and it can
[1:57:46] come in silence
[1:57:49] loudness is not volume it's not a
[1:57:53] indicator for blessing
[1:57:56] Jesus could just sit there and says
[1:57:59] blessed are the poor and brother
[1:58:01] Birmingham said the greatest anointing
[1:58:03] was upon him
[1:58:08] that is our difference to all
[1:58:10] Pentecostal thing thinking we love the
[1:58:13] emotional part a lot but I know one
[1:58:15] thing emotions come and emotions will go
[1:58:18] when I go to the church I and I'm
[1:58:21] reading I said Lord put something into
[1:58:24] my soul that this one was shining and
[1:58:26] brother Braham said Moses had a message
[1:58:27] and when he delivered that message
[1:58:30] amen
[1:58:31] he was Moses completely again
[1:58:34] blessed be the name of the Lord can you
[1:58:36] say Amen
[1:58:37] what what a different make the next one
[1:58:39] please so we see amen that brother blame
[1:58:42] said this amen he said we remember and
[1:58:45] he refers Exodus and you shall keep it
[1:58:49] until the 14th day of the same months
[1:58:52] and the whole assembly of the
[1:58:54] congregation of Israel shall kill it in
[1:58:56] the evening
[1:58:57] that lamb in the message the totem was
[1:59:00] kept from the 10th
[1:59:03] till the 14th day exactly four days or
[1:59:06] on the fourth day three days complete on
[1:59:10] the fourth day in the evening it was
[1:59:12] killed okay
[1:59:14] the token now remember
[1:59:16] and it doesn't matter what you are how
[1:59:20] good you are how many times you jumped
[1:59:22] up and down please young people keep
[1:59:24] that in your mind when you come from a
[1:59:26] youth camp it was so tremendous okay
[1:59:28] what was tremendous
[1:59:29] okay you can jump up it won't mean one
[1:59:33] thing to you if that token isn't applied
[1:59:36] this is the evening time that worked on
[1:59:40] that worked all right in the days of
[1:59:43] Luther that worked all right in the days
[1:59:45] of Wesley but it don't work now no yeah
[1:59:48] keeping up the lamp was right then
[1:59:55] what does it say for democracy you make
[1:59:57] a jump I don't make a jump
[1:59:58] as Jonah was three days
[2:00:02] in the Valley of the whale
[2:00:04] through the justification sanctification
[2:00:07] baptistification three days that land
[2:00:10] was just kept
[2:00:12] it was there but it was kept but it was
[2:00:16] not the time yet to apply the token is
[2:00:17] what not their time
[2:00:19] in reality
[2:00:21] what the reformer said what Wesley had
[2:00:23] what Azusa Street had was not the real
[2:00:26] thing what we have today it is pointing
[2:00:30] to our time
[2:00:34] they had the shadow
[2:00:37] we have the substance
[2:00:40] seven Church ages is the negative we are
[2:00:43] that positive
[2:00:45] because this is rapturing time
[2:00:48] this is the time when the shadow becomes
[2:00:51] the original
[2:00:53] therefore the church and the Luther the
[2:00:56] church and the West the church even in
[2:00:58] Pentecost had not rapturing Grace and
[2:01:00] not rapturing faith
[2:01:03] it was just keeping
[2:01:06] for a time that would come
[2:01:09] God watched it he said and and they were
[2:01:12] just jumping and shouting the Lord come
[2:01:14] soon the Lord comes soon the Lord comes
[2:01:16] to it and God says yes he comes soon but
[2:01:18] first something has to come in the days
[2:01:20] of the voice of the seventh angel the
[2:01:23] mystery of God must be revealed God
[2:01:26] shows who he is so that your bride can
[2:01:28] understand that's the way foreign
[2:01:31] God allowed all things and he says they
[2:01:35] don't know better it was the time of
[2:01:37] ignorance said brother Branham
[2:01:39] make okay
[2:01:41] next one please so here we see
[2:01:47] as it was for three days
[2:01:52] this their generation we're not giving a
[2:01:54] sign only the sign of Jonah
[2:01:59] because the son of man will be in the
[2:02:01] grave
[2:02:02] on the earth in the belly of the Earth
[2:02:04] for three days
[2:02:08] and three nights
[2:02:11] amen
[2:02:13] so Jonah
[2:02:17] was in that belly
[2:02:20] according to the Bible for three days
[2:02:22] and three nights
[2:02:24] that Veil had a mystery in him
[2:02:28] that Veil had redemption in him
[2:02:31] that whale had a had a great treasure in
[2:02:34] him
[2:02:35] a man I don't know if the whale was
[2:02:37] aware of it
[2:02:40] I don't know if you are aware who lives
[2:02:41] in you
[2:02:43] are you just a church member are you
[2:02:45] just a message believer or you say no no
[2:02:47] I have a mission in my heart
[2:02:50] brother blame said brother Brian said
[2:02:52] this message you are the lights of the
[2:02:55] world therefore I said on Friday we are
[2:02:57] the coming of the Lord
[2:02:58] and still we are meeting him in the air
[2:03:00] keep a balance in all things not a
[2:03:02] problem we are more than just some some
[2:03:04] amen
[2:03:06] so what happens how did God start
[2:03:10] to bring
[2:03:12] to a world
[2:03:14] the things that is so precious to us
[2:03:21] you can say this just brother Brian yep
[2:03:25] if I would tell you I would tell of one
[2:03:27] of the youngsters brother I gave you ten
[2:03:28] thousand dollar if you go tomorrow to a
[2:03:30] Lutheran Church that says no way no way
[2:03:33] do you understand despite of all of our
[2:03:36] human problems we are like Peter
[2:03:40] we don't go back to a church or
[2:03:42] denominational place because we know one
[2:03:43] thing this place have words of eternal
[2:03:46] life
[2:03:47] do you understand you are on a way where
[2:03:50] you cannot go you you reach the point of
[2:03:53] no return
[2:03:54] no way even no matter in what social
[2:03:59] situation you are right now but you know
[2:04:01] one thing my father calls me
[2:04:04] you understand even the young people
[2:04:05] they you can give them a million no no I
[2:04:08] know this is the truth
[2:04:10] so here comes the message for ninevee
[2:04:13] and how did that message start God comes
[2:04:15] on their way and the first thing that
[2:04:17] these people see
[2:04:20] that that of this messenger of this let
[2:04:23] me call him an angel is a man standing
[2:04:26] in the water and his name is Noah Jonah
[2:04:30] and the first thing how this message
[2:04:32] started that we believe started with the
[2:04:35] man standing in Ohio River
[2:04:38] you see how the picture is fulfilled
[2:04:41] and out of that Ohio River comes a man
[2:04:44] with a mission not only a Baptist
[2:04:46] preacher a pastor he said as John the
[2:04:48] Baptist
[2:04:49] was forwarding the first coming of
[2:04:51] Christ your message will foreign the
[2:04:53] second coming of again Jonah comes out
[2:04:55] of the water
[2:04:57] and he has a message to bring
[2:05:02] it's right in his heart right in his
[2:05:03] mouth you say brother Marcus uh
[2:05:07] what what what what
[2:05:09] if we preach thousands 100 messages
[2:05:14] we we we we preach them we read them we
[2:05:18] translate them we copy them we write
[2:05:20] them down but where were all these
[2:05:23] messages before all in the mouths of
[2:05:25] William Branham
[2:05:28] they were all in him everything that we
[2:05:30] preached was sealed in one man and he
[2:05:34] preached it
[2:05:37] amen and that takes us home
[2:05:40] so for three days and three nights
[2:05:43] justification sanctification baptism of
[2:05:46] the Holy Ghost it's still in the Valley
[2:05:48] of the Earth but the prophet now comes
[2:05:51] out of nothing
[2:05:53] no denomination no church out of nothing
[2:05:56] God has the man of the hour
[2:05:59] and where does he come out of the river
[2:06:01] like Jonah
[2:06:06] that should be the name of the Lord
[2:06:09] do you speak about brother Brandon we
[2:06:10] speak about our father
[2:06:13] we speak about scripture fulfilled as
[2:06:15] Jonah was three days in the valleys and
[2:06:17] now look
[2:06:18] you put on your spiritual jacket okay
[2:06:21] I told you yesterday
[2:06:23] that that when Jesus was born in
[2:06:27] Bethlehem there was no
[2:06:29] room in the Inns and in the hotels
[2:06:33] so you had to go in some kind like a
[2:06:35] cave
[2:06:37] when he messaged when he when the seals
[2:06:39] were open the churches were closed
[2:06:42] brother Brian said I'm for three years
[2:06:44] right here now
[2:06:46] in in Tucson and nobody invited me there
[2:06:49] was only one who invited him brother
[2:06:51] outlaw
[2:06:52] I said praise God for some Outlaws
[2:06:59] because these churches were thinking
[2:07:01] politically
[2:07:03] God help us that we're not coming into
[2:07:06] this message in that same trance
[2:07:08] a brother is a brother no matter if I
[2:07:12] disagree with his life still if he was a
[2:07:14] brother he is a brother
[2:07:16] if he was a friend he is a friend I can
[2:07:19] say brother I'm not agreeing with you
[2:07:21] but one thing is sure here is something
[2:07:22] between us okay
[2:07:25] we are not just brothers because we come
[2:07:27] to the same local church brother that is
[2:07:29] pure denominational thinking
[2:07:33] do you want to see us at the sign of a
[2:07:35] sect in a sect is oh let me say here's
[2:07:38] one of the brothers and said oh my
[2:07:40] brother
[2:07:41] before the foundation of the world we
[2:07:44] were already family and there's
[2:07:45] something in us and and we are so
[2:07:47] friends and we are this and and pray I
[2:07:50] want to all these I want to have
[2:07:52] Thousand Years with you when I'm on the
[2:07:54] other side and blah blah blah and here
[2:07:55] that brother comes into problem he
[2:07:57] leaves the church
[2:07:58] say Amen oh yeah I mean he left us
[2:08:00] because he was never one of us
[2:08:03] in between our five minute brother you
[2:08:04] leave the church and people will forget
[2:08:06] you
[2:08:07] but I believe God does not forget you
[2:08:10] people forget you brother and and you
[2:08:12] have to see and that is a sect and God
[2:08:14] help us never to become a sect
[2:08:16] because the same brother
[2:08:19] same sister comes to her own mind comes
[2:08:22] back to church
[2:08:24] and here the brother said oh an eagle we
[2:08:26] were always with God together whatever
[2:08:28] and you think by yourself hey brother I
[2:08:30] would have need your help in that time
[2:08:33] that time because if I'm an eagle of God
[2:08:36] I will always be an eagle of God nobody
[2:08:39] can preach you in and nobody can preach
[2:08:41] you out
[2:08:43] they say Amen
[2:08:45] sometimes it's not that we are wrong
[2:08:46] people but sometimes we are we don't
[2:08:48] have that maturity
[2:08:49] that we should have in our churches to
[2:08:52] deal with difficult situations
[2:08:54] amen so what happened is this brother
[2:08:57] Brahm there was no church which was open
[2:09:00] but God opens
[2:09:03] the full the business the Full Gospel
[2:09:06] businessman
[2:09:09] the Full Gospel businessman
[2:09:11] were not around the ministry of William
[2:09:14] brand but around the ministry of our
[2:09:15] robots that was their main speaker but
[2:09:18] brother Branham always was invited to be
[2:09:20] a Healer
[2:09:22] the Full Gospel businessman never met in
[2:09:24] a church they always met in hotels
[2:09:27] amen
[2:09:30] so when brother Brennan was invited he
[2:09:32] said I'm in chapter zones I'm in chapter
[2:09:33] zones one of our precious sermons that
[2:09:36] we believe were not preached in a church
[2:09:38] but in Clifton's Cafeteria
[2:09:42] holiday in Phoenix
[2:09:45] amen Ramadan Tucson
[2:09:48] look all the messages after 63 there's
[2:09:51] hardly any church in it everything is
[2:09:53] Hotel uh Ballroom so-and-so Clifton's
[2:09:57] Cafeteria
[2:09:59] who invited them
[2:10:01] the Christian businessman
[2:10:03] quote brother Branham
[2:10:05] you look it over and you look it over
[2:10:07] he said when Jonah came out of that Veil
[2:10:11] all the businessmen were at the seashore
[2:10:14] quote brother Branham
[2:10:17] quote brother Branham he said because
[2:10:20] the fishermen at that time were the
[2:10:22] businessmen
[2:10:23] the church had no place but the
[2:10:25] businessman fulfilling the scripture of
[2:10:27] Jonah
[2:10:30] can you say Amen
[2:10:32] God so much in control
[2:10:35] God doesn't make mistakes then and then
[2:10:37] you see how there is a development I'm
[2:10:39] not 1933 I'm see the life of Joseph
[2:10:43] we're not entering Joseph born 17 years
[2:10:47] later the pillar of fire Joseph 17 he
[2:10:49] was led he was he was brought to Egypt
[2:10:52] at the age of 17. 13 years later Joseph
[2:10:55] was 30. um he came for in front of the
[2:10:58] king
[2:10:58] everything portrayed God showed us these
[2:11:02] things he said look in thy Bible I am
[2:11:04] the Gods
[2:11:05] the Almighty
[2:11:08] Joseph was 30 13 years after he went to
[2:11:11] Egypt he was brought before the king
[2:11:13] as I said on Friday can you say Amen
[2:11:16] give me just some minutes
[2:11:19] as I said on Friday
[2:11:21] maybe we don't see everything
[2:11:24] maybe you don't see please remember we
[2:11:26] as Minister we're living in those things
[2:11:28] I don't expect that everybody now said
[2:11:29] praise the lord we live in those things
[2:11:31] that's our daily bread two three day
[2:11:33] hours per day just the message of the
[2:11:35] hour therefore we see all these pictures
[2:11:36] don't be frustrated if you don't see it
[2:11:38] that's fine but believe your brother
[2:11:39] okay
[2:11:41] but
[2:11:42] maybe you don't see everything in the
[2:11:44] message but there's one thing that I can
[2:11:46] guarantee you you can say I have seen
[2:11:48] the star
[2:11:50] can you see amen
[2:11:52] and the star brother Graham said these
[2:11:54] three stars it was God shows in the
[2:11:56] heaven what he does on Earth three men
[2:11:58] in line three stars in line that star
[2:12:01] never LED them to Jerusalem
[2:12:04] that star LED them to the king
[2:12:07] in Bethlehem which is Christ
[2:12:10] we have seen the seven star that was
[2:12:13] William Branham
[2:12:15] and William Branham never led us to
[2:12:17] Jeffersonville
[2:12:18] he led us to the king
[2:12:21] to the word itself to the bridegroom to
[2:12:25] our father I mean therefore we have that
[2:12:28] after these years Joseph comes in front
[2:12:30] of his father
[2:12:31] of of the new king can you say Amen next
[2:12:35] one please amen going through hear the
[2:12:37] proof amen amen finishing two three two
[2:12:41] three examples amen Jonah three days and
[2:12:44] three nights old man old woman don't be
[2:12:47] discouraged if you are a representation
[2:12:49] up there the attribute of God if you are
[2:12:52] represented here you cannot you are
[2:12:54] Eternal and if you cross from the
[2:12:57] seventh into the eighth you got it
[2:13:00] Eternal by the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:01] Spirit you are included into this now if
[2:13:03] you are just trusting upon a sensation
[2:13:06] or jumping up or down I'll do this I
[2:13:08] keep the seventh day I don't eat meat
[2:13:11] we could continue I try to drink alcohol
[2:13:13] I go to church I have long hair I have
[2:13:15] all these fine that's okay things going
[2:13:17] to perish so it is in the Eternal this
[2:13:20] is the Eternal the feast after the Feast
[2:13:22] of Tabernacle see the Feast of
[2:13:24] Tabernacles was the last three the
[2:13:26] seventh Feast we are now worshiping we
[2:13:29] are speaking now under the Feast of
[2:13:31] Tabernacles the seven Church age
[2:13:33] now look at this
[2:13:36] to understand
[2:13:38] God does these things to separate us
[2:13:40] from
[2:13:41] Reformation
[2:13:44] completely
[2:13:46] all of our good doings brother I know
[2:13:49] more I see more I'm deeper I tell you
[2:13:54] forget it
[2:13:55] forget it because we talk now about a
[2:13:58] theophany not about our knowledge what
[2:14:00] we can see
[2:14:02] but you see the picture amen how great
[2:14:05] amen amen here is Israel
[2:14:09] and we have what we call the Yom Kippur
[2:14:13] and between the New Year and Yom Kippur
[2:14:15] you have 10 days to bring your life in
[2:14:17] order and that is the great day of
[2:14:20] atonement
[2:14:21] after Yom Kippur
[2:14:24] we have the Feast of Tabernacles it's a
[2:14:28] Feast of Joy okay and I make it simple
[2:14:31] that you and that you understand what
[2:14:33] God did in our time when that cloud came
[2:14:36] so here comes the Holy Spirit of the
[2:14:38] priest
[2:14:40] he enters
[2:14:42] into the holiest of holies with the
[2:14:45] blood all these things okay with the
[2:14:47] belts huh
[2:14:49] brother blame said as long as Israel was
[2:14:53] listening to that sound they knew that
[2:14:54] the holy that the high priest was still
[2:14:56] living
[2:14:57] and he says if your religion doesn't
[2:14:59] produce sound you have to bury it
[2:15:01] because it's dead anyhow
[2:15:04] that's what he says okay amen so that
[2:15:09] means the high priest for some moments
[2:15:11] he's out of the sight of Israel they
[2:15:14] don't see him anymore
[2:15:16] do you have only have to wait
[2:15:19] and they know one thing if he doesn't
[2:15:20] come back we have a big problem because
[2:15:22] God didn't forgive our sin the wrath of
[2:15:24] God comes upon us
[2:15:25] so you can form Heavenly Father
[2:15:29] and what happened when he came out
[2:15:31] everybody was rejoicing
[2:15:34] our sacrifice is accepted
[2:15:37] we are forgiven
[2:15:39] look what God did in our time
[2:15:41] the last people who saw Jesus of
[2:15:44] Nazareth the way he looked like
[2:15:46] were the disciples
[2:15:48] who were on
[2:15:50] the amount of Ascension on the Mount of
[2:15:52] Olives
[2:15:53] um and then for 2 000 years he just goes
[2:15:56] Amen to make an intercession we're not
[2:15:58] speaking about that subject because then
[2:16:00] then I'm in trouble I mean I'm making an
[2:16:03] intercession
[2:16:04] we don't know him
[2:16:06] we believe the Bible everybody believed
[2:16:09] the Bible it's God's words Luther
[2:16:10] believed the Bible Wesley believe the
[2:16:12] Bible we have no other report we have
[2:16:15] Pentecostalism baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:17] okay nobody knows exactly where he is
[2:16:19] but we believe the Bible and the big
[2:16:21] person he himself is not be seen
[2:16:25] but then came the time where brother Ben
[2:16:27] said I saw him when he when he went when
[2:16:30] when he appeared to me at the place
[2:16:32] where I would build a tabernacle and he
[2:16:34] looked like Hoffman's head of Christ
[2:16:38] that's the way how Jesus looked like
[2:16:40] like Hoffman's head of Christ
[2:16:43] and then God's on Sunset Mountain comes
[2:16:46] Amen in seven angels amen with a picture
[2:16:51] amen and you turn the picture to the
[2:16:54] right and you see his face
[2:16:56] in other words the high priest shows
[2:16:59] that that the sacrifice is accepted
[2:17:05] so I know one thing I'm free
[2:17:09] I'm free
[2:17:15] brother brother sometimes I I have to
[2:17:17] deal I have to counsel the situation all
[2:17:20] kinds from sexual problems to
[2:17:21] perversions to to to to to to to to
[2:17:24] bitterness to Crime to hatred whatever
[2:17:28] and I speak to people who are advanced
[2:17:31] in the message
[2:17:32] I said before we are saying anything
[2:17:35] we just make a statement that you are
[2:17:37] redeemed
[2:17:39] yes I'm redeemed
[2:17:40] amen okay now let's deal with these
[2:17:43] little problems
[2:17:44] that will leave you so fast
[2:17:47] there is three things that I'm not
[2:17:51] fighting for I'm not working for it
[2:17:53] because that is God alone
[2:17:55] the first thing that I'm not fighting
[2:17:57] for is to have a sacrifice because I
[2:18:00] believe that was already
[2:18:01] I I believe when Jesus said it is
[2:18:04] finished that is finished I believe the
[2:18:06] Bible
[2:18:07] second one I'm not fighting together
[2:18:09] theophany because it's there
[2:18:12] God will not think five minutes before
[2:18:14] I'm going home oh it does Marcus back
[2:18:15] and get a theophany how often was he in
[2:18:18] church and did he read the Bible and My
[2:18:21] Philosophy was there before I was here
[2:18:23] on Earth
[2:18:24] third thing I will not take care of the
[2:18:26] Rapture because that's God's choice
[2:18:28] anyhow
[2:18:29] there's nothing for us prepare yourself
[2:18:31] the Lord comes to unprepared
[2:18:34] I'm because I believe the Bible the
[2:18:36] price is paid the ferry has paid the way
[2:18:39] it's paid the thing that God does he's
[2:18:40] just now molding me to fit into that
[2:18:43] image
[2:18:44] can you say Amen
[2:18:46] and all the rest of my problems my mind
[2:18:49] my psyche my problems my births my genes
[2:18:52] now let's take care of these little
[2:18:54] problems that we still have
[2:18:56] but the major three things God solved
[2:18:59] them all for me can you say Amen so the
[2:19:02] high priest can be seen and we can't say
[2:19:03] one thing Calvary has its effect
[2:19:06] yes amen therefore this message didn't
[2:19:09] take away Calvary this message brought
[2:19:12] Calvary right at the same thing
[2:19:14] we think if we sing the song There's an
[2:19:18] Old Rugged Cross we sing it different
[2:19:19] than all denominations
[2:19:22] can you say Amen make the next one
[2:19:24] please I'm amen here we go amen as again
[2:19:27] I'm in all kind of of of of
[2:19:32] things
[2:19:33] keep one thing in mind
[2:19:36] you and me we are children of our time
[2:19:40] please understand one thing when we came
[2:19:43] into the message we were not blank we
[2:19:46] had already our denominational thinking
[2:19:49] when we came into the message
[2:19:51] and God takes a lot of years to take
[2:19:53] that thing out of us
[2:19:56] amen as first the first one to raise
[2:19:58] from all the prophets and so forth he
[2:20:01] was the first fruit of those that slept
[2:20:03] in the bright coming of Christ here you
[2:20:05] have the bright coming of Christ coming
[2:20:06] out of the church there will have to be
[2:20:08] a sheath waved against the last day oh
[2:20:11] my waving off the Sheaf what was the
[2:20:13] chief the first one that come to mature
[2:20:15] the first one approved it was a a wheat
[2:20:19] that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah
[2:20:20] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about
[2:20:22] it was waived over the people and the
[2:20:25] first time there will come forth the
[2:20:27] bright age
[2:20:28] for a resurrection out of dark
[2:20:31] denominational message denominationalism
[2:20:34] will be a message that the full maturity
[2:20:37] of the word has turned back again in its
[2:20:40] full power being waived over the People
[2:20:42] by the same signs and wonders what he
[2:20:44] did back there
[2:20:45] this message is not there to polish up
[2:20:49] denominational
[2:20:51] denominationalism this message is to
[2:20:54] bury it
[2:20:56] and raise up according to the words
[2:20:59] brother Brian speaks about a new birth
[2:21:01] according Malachi 4.
[2:21:05] this message is not continuation the
[2:21:08] nonsense that we had for 2000 years this
[2:21:10] is changing of dispensation
[2:21:13] and so that we change God showed himself
[2:21:17] that's me
[2:21:18] that's my character that's how I feel I
[2:21:21] mean you know I'm a father and brother
[2:21:22] Brian said in in the message Christ is
[2:21:25] the mystery of God revealed God is a
[2:21:26] father now you come home from your work
[2:21:28] okay so now here's your children okay I
[2:21:32] hope that you don't want to have this
[2:21:33] okay so you come home and here's your
[2:21:35] children
[2:21:36] father comes home father comes home he
[2:21:41] brings the money we can go to McDonald's
[2:21:44] thank you Father
[2:21:50] brother we are not called to have a
[2:21:51] muslimic worship
[2:21:53] oh Lord how great you are God knows that
[2:21:56] he is great we don't have to tell him he
[2:21:58] says there is none beside me he knows it
[2:22:01] God is not a narcissist
[2:22:04] but God wants to have children
[2:22:06] who says what do you believe in me
[2:22:09] heavenly father I love you so much
[2:22:12] I hope we can say this when we are just
[2:22:14] alone like brother Graham said he was
[2:22:17] running around that tree
[2:22:18] I hope I hope we have time when we say
[2:22:21] heavenly father I cannot express it but
[2:22:22] I love you so much
[2:22:24] it's such an honor to be your child
[2:22:27] mold me correct me take me but I know
[2:22:30] you mean well with me
[2:22:33] God doesn't want you all how great do
[2:22:35] all the angels can repeat this
[2:22:39] but when you pray that your heart speak
[2:22:42] such an honor to be part of your family
[2:22:46] God wants your hearts your soul
[2:22:48] Hallelujah
[2:22:51] you can't say if somebody comes like a
[2:22:53] Pharisee Lord I'm so thankful
[2:22:55] I see deep things
[2:22:58] and my poor Chicken around me
[2:23:01] feel so sorry that they are not Eagles
[2:23:03] you see how stinking is this in the eyes
[2:23:06] of God how stinking God wants Hearts One
[2:23:09] Soul
[2:23:11] he's amen
[2:23:12] so therefore this message
[2:23:16] is a Resurrection on the eighth day
[2:23:19] not age Church age there is no age
[2:23:21] Church age but this is bright age
[2:23:24] spiritual AIDS day and look brother
[2:23:26] blames Tabernacle God knows what he does
[2:23:28] Penn Street

[2:23:36] pen and Avery
[2:23:39] God says this I make a corner
[2:23:45] I'm not continuing with denomination and
[2:23:47] listen brother Graham said the church
[2:23:48] always wants to continue but brother

[2:24:32] kindergarten and she was just sitting
[2:24:34] there
[2:24:35] and normally the children are a little
[2:24:36] bit embarrassed when the father came
[2:24:39] Papa bring me to the kindergarten but
[2:24:40] but 100 Peter before you can just okay
[2:24:44] the older they get the farther distance
[2:24:47] become
[2:24:48] if if there are 50 in the kind that the
[2:24:51] school is in this direction I said
[2:24:52] please bring me in this direction
[2:24:54] they prefer to work not just to
[2:24:56] embarrass them you know but I remember
[2:24:58] that thing I came and my little girl was
[2:25:00] just sitting with your other children
[2:25:02] and when she sees me she just stands up
[2:25:04] hello Daddy
[2:25:06] and I thought by myself I will never be
[2:25:08] ashamed of her never ever
[2:25:10] happened if she becomes a Muslim if she
[2:25:13] becomes a lesbian whatever she becomes
[2:25:15] amen she will always be my daughter I
[2:25:18] will not be ashamed of her I'm not
[2:25:20] agreeing with her lifestyle although she
[2:25:22] is a Christian really serving a lot but
[2:25:24] I told you honey we are always friends
[2:25:26] in life no if you choose to become a
[2:25:29] Muslim that's up to you okay if she
[2:25:31] comes next time
[2:25:33] okay but I said I don't agree but we are
[2:25:37] always friends
[2:25:38] that's the way how God thinks about his
[2:25:40] children
[2:25:41] brother God is not ashamed we make a lot
[2:25:44] of features amen make the next one
[2:25:47] hurrying through amen here we go next
[2:25:49] one please
[2:25:50] amen now I'm a Finnish bodies
[2:25:54] time this is a special time
[2:25:57] this is
[2:25:59] rapturing time
[2:26:01] this is theophany time
[2:26:04] this is not only
[2:26:05] Holiness movements
[2:26:08] but it brings Heaven and Earth together
[2:26:11] now Paul says here notice his enroll in
[2:26:15] Hebrews notice his title king of
[2:26:18] righteousness
[2:26:21] and king of peace
[2:26:24] that's what Paul says in the book of
[2:26:25] Hebrews only two kings
[2:26:28] but this message is more than just what
[2:26:30] Paul taught
[2:26:32] it took Paul was a tremendous man
[2:26:36] building a foundation
[2:26:39] as a wise master builder but this
[2:26:43] message brought a Capstone upon the
[2:26:45] whole building
[2:26:46] amen amen so it takes us higher he says
[2:26:50] king of righteous and also king of Peace
[2:26:53] here's two kings there now since he has
[2:26:55] come into flesh and received his body up
[2:26:57] in Revelation 21 16 he's called King of
[2:27:00] Kings all three together see King God
[2:27:03] King theophany King Jesus he is king of
[2:27:06] all Kings
[2:27:07] Paul uses a subject here that brother
[2:27:10] Brahm that Paul never used
[2:27:12] now
[2:27:13] to show the time that we're in
[2:27:16] make it fast
[2:27:19] you see the balance and you see the
[2:27:20] greatness in it
[2:27:22] you remember that brother Branham says
[2:27:25] when he was in JCPenney he saw the same
[2:27:27] picture that he saw in Hell he saw now
[2:27:29] right on that escalator
[2:27:31] quote brother Graham Souls that are in
[2:27:33] prison hell is on Earth
[2:27:35] did he say this
[2:27:37] quote brother Brandon hell is on earth
[2:27:39] now
[2:27:40] did Brother Brian say The Fifth
[2:27:42] Dimension is empty never said this
[2:27:45] that's our own interpretation about this
[2:27:47] hell is em hell is on Earth he never
[2:27:50] said The Fifth Dimension is now empty
[2:27:52] because they're all on Earth the devil
[2:27:53] said this
[2:27:54] amen so if we say
[2:27:57] I mean Heaven is on Earth
[2:27:59] we never say the seventh Dimension is
[2:28:01] empty
[2:28:03] because the Bible says if the enemy
[2:28:06] comes in like a flood
[2:28:08] the Lord will raise up a standard
[2:28:10] against this
[2:28:11] so when brother what does Brothers say
[2:28:13] the effects of the five Dimensions Fifth
[2:28:16] Dimension is so strong that we can see
[2:28:19] it in our dimension
[2:28:21] so if Satan enters into our Dimension
[2:28:24] with his power
[2:28:26] what about God
[2:28:28] he comes with his power Angelic power
[2:28:31] theophany power right into our dimension
[2:28:35] and nobody preaches that seventh
[2:28:37] Dimension is empty but if if Satan comes
[2:28:42] imaginism we would hope I see this after
[2:28:44] is nothing ugly but if Satan comes with
[2:28:46] demonic power
[2:28:49] God doesn't tell the church only okay
[2:28:51] have long dresses and long hair that
[2:28:53] will not change that will not defeat the
[2:28:56] challenge of this day
[2:28:58] when Satan is on Earth God must be on
[2:29:02] earth the same way
[2:29:05] can you say Amen
[2:29:07] so it's it's nice to be outwardly nice
[2:29:10] but that's not the question what we're
[2:29:12] talking about we talk about something
[2:29:15] deep inside some mystical part amen next
[2:29:18] one please I'm in we're going through
[2:29:20] amen amen
[2:29:23] skip it because it's been too long it's
[2:29:25] about
[2:29:26] the question that brother brand was
[2:29:27] asked please explain the transition of
[2:29:30] the Bride I mean it's so tremendous okay
[2:29:31] next one amen amen he will come to the
[2:29:34] end soon is there another one or is it
[2:29:36] the last
[2:29:38] another one
[2:29:39] this is the last one no he look at this
[2:29:42] that's what I told you yesterday
[2:29:45] what are you searching you young people
[2:29:47] you're older one you want to have a
[2:29:48] religion
[2:29:49] you want to feel a little bit better by
[2:29:51] having some brighter Brandon pictures at
[2:29:52] the wall that's that's not our Revival
[2:29:55] our Revival is we have a father
[2:29:58] we are the only religion in this earth
[2:30:02] who have a father who has a father amen
[2:30:05] this man
[2:30:06] is not grandfather
[2:30:09] this man is her father
[2:30:11] of that young girl
[2:30:13] but he has cancer
[2:30:15] he would soon die
[2:30:17] and he fills in his heart and they were
[2:30:21] arranging it
[2:30:23] that he will not have enough time to
[2:30:25] bring that little girl his own daughter
[2:30:27] to the altar one day
[2:30:30] but he knows in his heart
[2:30:32] that father is a special person in Every
[2:30:35] Girl's Life and mother is a special
[2:30:37] person in every person's life nobody can
[2:30:40] replace you
[2:30:41] amen as I said yesterday our children
[2:30:44] are our brothers and sisters they are
[2:30:46] not our animals they are not our pets
[2:30:48] they are our brothers and sisters
[2:30:49] definitely so so he feels he's an
[2:30:52] unbeliever no doesn't believe amen
[2:30:56] but he feels on his heart that I want
[2:30:58] don't want to go and my girl was not
[2:31:01] brought to the altar by her own father
[2:31:04] so what they were doing is this
[2:31:06] they were playing marriage and he brings
[2:31:10] her to the Altar and at that moment the
[2:31:13] ceremony stops
[2:31:15] and when in many many years later that
[2:31:17] girl will marry they will continue
[2:31:19] exactly at that part
[2:31:22] where father left him only that she can
[2:31:24] say my father brought me to the altar
[2:31:27] brother I thought by myself if a man
[2:31:29] without the Holy Ghost can have that
[2:31:30] feeling for his children
[2:31:32] What About Us
[2:31:34] we must be the best parents out there in
[2:31:35] the world because we understand our
[2:31:37] father
[2:31:38] but do you understand how legalism and
[2:31:41] how religion
[2:31:42] makes us miserable
[2:31:45] and makes the people around us even more
[2:31:48] miserable
[2:31:49] do we understand that
[2:31:51] we have all the religious problems
[2:31:53] because we don't understand our father
[2:31:56] and we will not continue with
[2:31:58] denominationalism in this message
[2:32:00] because this has to be buried and raised
[2:32:03] up right from you too and they have a
[2:32:05] clear picture that is my father he paid
[2:32:07] a price and he made a way for me
[2:32:09] can you say Amen
[2:32:11] just go just go back for the last two
[2:32:13] one because I feel it would be that good
[2:32:14] next one okay just finish by this just
[2:32:17] reading without comments amen
[2:32:21] that's difficult for free why do you
[2:32:22] laugh
[2:32:24] repent the altar is open for you
[2:32:31] my daughter said always said oh hey
[2:32:33] daddy you are so embarrassing man he
[2:32:34] said I'm I'm hip I'm cool what do you
[2:32:37] want to say now you're so embarrassing
[2:32:39] hahaha
[2:32:40] please brother Brandon explain the
[2:32:42] mystery of the translation of the brides
[2:32:45] oh that's a good question please explain
[2:32:47] just to change our bodies let's say you
[2:32:50] know what I mean when I say that I don't
[2:32:52] want to be sick or religious I don't say
[2:32:54] I don't mean to say to this church I
[2:32:56] mean say every Abraham he was looking
[2:32:58] for a promise Sunday was promised to him
[2:33:00] it was right and the church is looking
[2:33:02] for a prophet's son the bride is that
[2:33:04] right the bride is looking for the
[2:33:06] promised son before the promised son
[2:33:08] could come to Sarah and Abraham their
[2:33:10] bodies had to be changed is that right
[2:33:13] she was too old to have a baby had no
[2:33:15] milk grains in her breasts and so forth
[2:33:18] and we cannot receive the promised son
[2:33:20] that's promised to us in these bodies
[2:33:24] therefore stop renovating
[2:33:27] that we live in these bodies are sin
[2:33:31] next one
[2:33:32] so potentially it's in here what is it
[2:33:36] the words promised before the foundation
[2:33:40] of the world and around there this only
[2:33:43] reflects the negative
[2:33:45] that will reflect the positive the word
[2:33:48] your own theophany see and the same
[2:33:51] thing is for the translation of the
[2:33:53] Bride will be the same thing the word
[2:33:56] that's in you the body will materialize
[2:33:59] around the world and the same thing did
[2:34:02] by Sarah
[2:34:04] when the old body that she had was the
[2:34:06] first body had to be changed in order to
[2:34:07] produce a sun you get it that body could
[2:34:10] not do it this body cannot do it so it
[2:34:12] will have to be changed in the same way
[2:34:15] how do we get that word
[2:34:18] amen God placed it before the foundation
[2:34:21] of the world God placed the Rapture
[2:34:23] already in
[2:34:25] his children as I said yesterday amen
[2:34:28] the resurrection is an event and is a
[2:34:31] person
[2:34:32] Jesus said I am the resurrection
[2:34:35] the Rapture is an event and is a person
[2:34:37] the bride can say I am the rapture
[2:34:41] do you see and I'm happy that I don't
[2:34:43] know about this thing but I'm traveling
[2:34:45] a lot if this is true
[2:34:48] that the true Rapture is the words in us
[2:34:51] and brother Brahma said the body will
[2:34:54] materialize throughout that word so
[2:34:55] don't pay too much attention about that
[2:34:57] body
[2:34:59] I say in a positive way don't fuss about
[2:35:03] vaccination or no vaccination
[2:35:06] because your Eternal destination is not
[2:35:10] determined by any vaccination
[2:35:12] my my my theophany is not vaccinated
[2:35:16] anyhow
[2:35:20] I see Church split
[2:35:22] about things like this and I asked
[2:35:24] myself did you understand what brother
[2:35:25] Brian says your body will be changed
[2:35:28] anyhow
[2:35:30] can you say Amen
[2:35:32] a person comes he said brother Marcus I
[2:35:34] feel to be vaccinated I said praise the
[2:35:35] Lord that's wonderful do it next one
[2:35:37] comes brother Marcus I feel that I don't
[2:35:39] want to be vaccinated I said praise the
[2:35:41] Lord do it that's exactly right because
[2:35:43] faith is personal
[2:35:46] we are not a sect
[2:35:48] we are not a sec if you feel do it I did
[2:35:50] it directly and I felt it I had complete
[2:35:53] conviction do it but if somebody said I
[2:35:54] will not do it
[2:35:56] fully respected I will not convert you
[2:35:58] to anything
[2:35:59] but don't spiritualize these things the
[2:36:01] Rapture is not a question of my body
[2:36:04] the Rapture is a question of the word
[2:36:06] that is sowed into my heart
[2:36:09] can you say Amen
[2:36:12] so therefore I I I I I
[2:36:16] you can eat what you want
[2:36:19] but let me go to McDonald's
[2:36:23] okay please
[2:36:25] don't don't don't despite me I maybe I'm
[2:36:28] not as okay somebody says brother Marcus
[2:36:31] and and I I we're eating healthy
[2:36:34] we're living healthy but when our time
[2:36:38] is up on Earth we die healthy
[2:36:41] amen I'm not dying because of Coca-Cola
[2:36:45] I die because my father calls me
[2:36:49] my life is in the brother he gave us an
[2:36:52] advice everything is fine never mind or
[2:36:55] on a major and major on a minor
[2:36:58] brother you go to American churches you
[2:37:00] cannot even preach something you can't
[2:37:02] even mention Trump
[2:37:05] you cannot even imitate him that's a
[2:37:07] tremendous
[2:37:09] tremendous
[2:37:12] [Applause]
[2:37:13] person gets upset
[2:37:16] and I think by myself hey who is your
[2:37:18] president Trump or Jesus
[2:37:20] print out Republicans we are not this we
[2:37:23] are not Miss Arnold against Arden leave
[2:37:26] everything Our God a place that our
[2:37:27] kingdom is another kingdom
[2:37:29] [Applause]
[2:37:31] respect authorities
[2:37:34] he said amen
[2:37:36] oh what a time when the musicians would
[2:37:38] come
[2:37:39] maybe you say brother Marcus you I don't
[2:37:41] agree with that interpretation but for
[2:37:42] me it was too clear because Jesus was
[2:37:45] not in the Earth for three days and
[2:37:47] three nights but the Bible is right but
[2:37:49] the word the son of man Christ was for
[2:37:52] three days and three nights in the belly
[2:37:54] of the Reformation
[2:37:56] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:37:59] three nine and on the fourth day
[2:38:01] a prophet comes out of the water amen
[2:38:04] and brings us
[2:38:05] Hallelujah can you say Amen
[2:38:08] maybe we have the song I Love You Lord
[2:38:15] do you see
[2:38:17] do you see how this message take us away
[2:38:20] from the concept of the men of the hour
[2:38:23] the bride found her men of the hour
[2:38:26] amen somebody somebody
[2:38:28] that's so wonderful Minister I'm
[2:38:30] streaming you all the time I said foot
[2:38:32] feels sorry for you you didn't
[2:38:33] understand what I said
[2:38:35] I don't say become fan of Marcus I said
[2:38:38] find your own identification with Christ
[2:38:41] I'm streaming nobody I have the message
[2:38:44] of the hour he said Lord you have a
[2:38:47] message and speak to my heart you can
[2:38:48] use anything
[2:38:50] not wrong all these things are not wrong
[2:38:52] but many many things that we do are not
[2:38:54] helpful I've seen young people they
[2:38:57] become fans of this and fans of that and
[2:38:59] they never growed spiritually they
[2:39:01] always were just seat us in the church
[2:39:03] it's not helpful for you you must take
[2:39:05] that book yourself I said heavenly
[2:39:08] father dead angel must come to me
[2:39:10] personally
[2:39:11] amen change be moved me
[2:39:13] you know that brother blame said only
[2:39:15] the lamb can can open the book is that
[2:39:17] correct amen that means you must become
[2:39:19] a lamb
[2:39:21] in the book for yourself
[2:39:22] we must become a lamb amen
[2:39:26] I love that that that that thought so
[2:39:28] much because
[2:39:29] [Music]
[2:39:30] Jonah is a special type in the Bible God
[2:39:33] always in the Old Testament he was that
[2:39:36] judgmental God but in the in the Book of
[2:39:39] Jonah he showed who he really was he
[2:39:41] said hey Jonah don't you think that I
[2:39:44] feel for these unbelievers in Sodom in
[2:39:47] in in individual do you think so
[2:39:49] Jonah his name means dove that's the
[2:39:53] signification no wonder their brother
[2:39:55] blame said on the wings of a snow white
[2:39:57] dove comes this message
[2:40:00] it takes some meekness somebody said
[2:40:04] [Music]
[2:40:07] we're Eagles
[2:40:09] an eagle
[2:40:11] strong
[2:40:13] it's aggressive that you know I agree I
[2:40:16] agree I'm an eagle too but Brothers
[2:40:22] it takes all aggression out of us we
[2:40:25] don't have to be aggressive anymore we
[2:40:27] don't have to compare to one another
[2:40:29] because I know hey I have a theophany
[2:40:31] I'm in myself and nobody will get it
[2:40:33] preserved for me you have a place nobody
[2:40:36] can take your place
[2:40:38] brings us into a piece
[2:40:41] it's a way
[2:40:42] and
[2:40:44] he was in the valley of the whale for
[2:40:45] three days and three nights and sure God
[2:40:47] was somehow speaking to him
[2:40:50] and when the time was over
[2:40:53] the wind came
[2:40:56] a person might leave the church a person
[2:40:59] might leave God but one thing is sure
[2:41:00] you might leave but God put something in
[2:41:02] you that you want to have to come back
[2:41:04] he's not forgetting you not forgetting
[2:41:06] you no no you're his son if you were his
[2:41:09] son you always his son definitely and so
[2:41:12] when these waves went up and down Jonah
[2:41:15] knew one thing God called me back
[2:41:18] and here is a fish he especially
[2:41:21] prepared a man following the shipment
[2:41:24] Noah was Jonah was
[2:41:26] and while that that that kind of
[2:41:30] storm comes up they take all the
[2:41:34] furniture and throw it over into the
[2:41:36] water
[2:41:37] amen but that that fish was a special
[2:41:39] fish because the fish was just thinking
[2:41:42] look I'm not interested in furnaces
[2:41:45] soon a man will fall down and my
[2:41:48] commission is to pick up that man
[2:41:51] do you understand that we all have a
[2:41:53] commission to help our brother
[2:41:55] we are that way that way sometimes
[2:41:57] they're taking up a person said hey
[2:41:59] there's still hope for you okay amen
[2:42:01] they're still cross they're still
[2:42:03] Calvary for you okay you pay for your
[2:42:05] mistake you pay for them know what but
[2:42:07] it does not take you away from the plan
[2:42:08] of God
[2:42:10] let us be that way I'm having a feeling
[2:42:13] for somebody who cannot help himself
[2:42:15] amen
[2:42:17] [Music]
[2:42:18] I love you Lord
[2:42:22] [Music]
[2:42:35] ship

[2:48:20] [Music]
[2:48:22] hearts
[2:48:24] desire and I long two words
[2:48:29] [Music]
[2:48:31] hallelujah amen
[2:48:35] amen I trust that we can receive the
[2:48:37] word we had this morning
[2:48:39] I mean you know I was discussing with
[2:48:42] brother Marcus one of the most difficult
[2:48:45] things as a minister is
[2:48:47] people listen to things through their
[2:48:49] own filters
[2:48:54] the filters are very obvious
[2:48:56] so I just don't agree with that so we
[2:48:59] block it out and we ignore it other
[2:49:01] times we actually think we hear what's
[2:49:03] being said but we actually interpret it
[2:49:05] through our pretty defined filters you
[2:49:08] know and the things that rather refer to
[2:49:11] you know we can interpret things through
[2:49:13] denominational filters and our cultural
[2:49:15] filters and our perspectives and so
[2:49:17] forth and we actually hear what we want
[2:49:19] to hear because that's how we think and
[2:49:22] that's what we believe
[2:49:23] and my prayer is that God will shake us
[2:49:26] out of that so that we can actually hear
[2:49:28] what the spirit says to the church so if
[2:49:31] we can hear what God intends with his
[2:49:33] word and then if there's one thing I'm
[2:49:36] praying for this weekend is that we will
[2:49:37] hear what God sees I'm here with your
[2:49:40] mind says God says amen but here What
[2:49:43] God Says in our soul
[2:49:45] praise the Lord I thoroughly enjoyed
[2:49:48] this morning I mean having a wonderful
[2:49:51] time amen
[2:49:53] [Music]
[2:49:56] amen that's for the Lord
[2:49:59] praise the Lord so two more services to
[2:50:01] go we we uh we're being fed very very
[2:50:05] well and just really excited and
[2:50:07] thankful to be here this weekend and
[2:50:10] thankful for each one of you that are
[2:50:11] here
[2:50:12] I I also want to just take the
[2:50:15] opportunity we didn't really do it last
[2:50:17] night and a handful of us prayed over
[2:50:21] the Over Midnight and so forth I don't
[2:50:23] want to say my god really bless you this
[2:50:26] year
[2:50:26] my God give you a wonderful 2023.
[2:50:30] and and we're not saying wonderful from
[2:50:32] a Prosperity Gospel perspective if
[2:50:34] you're saying it for me from an eternal
[2:50:36] perspective my God draw each one of us
[2:50:39] closer to him may may our walk get real
[2:50:43] I made more than just our little pet
[2:50:46] Doctrine or our little issue or our
[2:50:48] little attitude or whatever maybe you
[2:50:50] have a real relationship with our
[2:50:52] heavenly father I mean may I walk be be
[2:50:56] the most important thing of our lives
[2:50:58] but not in a religious spirit way
[2:51:01] but because of a love for our savior I
[2:51:04] mean because of a love for what he's
[2:51:06] done for us that's why we can sing I
[2:51:08] love him because he first loved me I
[2:51:10] mean May that just become more and more
[2:51:12] a reality in US
[2:51:13] yeah I know it's usually not something
[2:51:15] we do at the end of a service but I'm
[2:51:18] gonna just ask you to not everyone in
[2:51:20] the building right that's going to take
[2:51:21] an hour but just those around you to
[2:51:24] shake their hands and say God bless you

[2:51:28] father and we're family amen
