musicians thank you so much yeah well here I am I never thought I'd reach this far but I can remember a little uh I was at one of our family camps one time and I got involved in a little in a conversation that some uh five six seven year olds were were were in and they were talking about their age so uh they were talking how old they were and how old this one was and how old that one was and I said to them I said you you want to know how old I am said yeah yeah how old you I think at the time I was like 42 or something and I said I'm 42 this little 5-year-old looked at me straight face looked at me he said no he said if you were that old you'd be [Laughter] dead he was dead set convinced that no one can live that old you I don't know what he thinks now but praise the Lord I just bring greetings from back home and just uh they they send their their love and appreciation to you all and uh your support to the church in Brisbane through the youth camps and the youth camps and conventions and things that you have here a true blessing to the body of Christ so just want to encourage you to to keep keep pressing the battle and uh keep serving the lord and he's um he's good to us amen just want to thank brother El sister prilla for their hospitality and uh their love and care to us and their daughter as well Karissa uh God bless you very special indeed amen i' like to know where my wife is where's my wife there she is praise the lord it's good to be here with her um being able to travel with her and um as we heard yesterday we we've grown together we've cried together we've laughed together we've overcome together we've argued together we've done everything together but uh praise God by by his grace the greatest joy that we have is to serve him and uh we thank God to be able to do that with him together amen praise the Lord amen i' like to bring a a thought to you the this morning that um has been on my my heart I've I'm type of guy that if uh the Lord puts something on my heart then I struggled to go in this direction or that direction I've just got to stick on that and um that's just the way I the way I am so we're we're going to look at a thought that's uh been resonating in my heart and it's not that I haven't ministered but it's it's something that continues to to open it's it's like you you think you've you've come to the end of it and then all of a sudden another another chapter of it opens up and you just continue with it so we we uh we thank God for his word amen it's because of God in my life that I am here I I can truly say that it's because of God in my life that I can stand before you the way that I am uh it it's it would not be possible it is not possible without him but but me being here as a testimony as it was for David a testimony when Goliath went down it was a testimony that God that David was not alone a lot of people saw that Goliath went down but really what God wanted people to see that there was more than David on the scene and there was one there that could turn on the light amen so we we thank God I I appreciate him with all of my heart I would not be able to have the pleasure of meeting you all the way that I am without him in my life amen so we we thank him just want to acknowledge the other ministers in the in the church here may God bless you your Ministries and uh may may um you just continue to serve him with all of your heart amen God bless you brother Paul I think I saw brother Paul back there somewhere God bless you brother good to see you here this morning amen so the thought that we want to look at this morning is uh Rising by Revelation um so if we can turn in our Bibles this morning to the book of Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 and amen it's an honor to serve him it really is amen Hebrews uh chapter 10 verse verse 7 this the one verse and then we'll go to Colossians 2:9 and John 13 uh Hebrews 10:7 it says then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God Amen let's read that again then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God amen if we can turn to the book of Colossians Colossians 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of the principality of power verse 9 there for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen we know who that scripture is speaking of speaking of our Lord and savior the Lord Jesus Christ and uh we'll go to to John John 13 verse1 now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and suffer being ended and the devil having now put Into the Heart of Jesus Judas es scariot Simon's son to portray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself amen let's bow our hearts this morning our heavenly father Lord God may you speak to each and every individual this morning Lord we we can say Lord God that it is because of you in our lives Lord that we are what we are so Lord God we we thank you for your presence we thank you for the for the revelation of the man who can turn on the light oh Lord God we just appreciate you so much Lord we we want to glorify you Lord God we we want to honor you Heavenly Father we want to submit to your will for this service this morning oh Lord God may may you feel Lord welcome here in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can take your seats this morning we want to look at uh these these three um portions of scripture that we've read from here um we just want to start by by here by by looking at uh John 13 and and verse um three and four there it says Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went from God and went to God he riseth from supper so the thought that we want to look at this morning is Rising by Revelation or we could say as I touched on it yesterday Rising by the Revelation by the strength of the revelation of who we are yeah I believe with all of my heart that this is what God desires for each and every one of us because you'd be amazed at how many times that you rise in a day you rise from bed you rise from The Breakfast Table you you you you rise from the lounge you rise up out of your car uh from your car that you'd be amazed at how many times that you go from a seated position to a standing position in your everyday life but it's interesting that I believe with all of my heart that what God desires for you is to rise in the revelation of who you are amen I believe he wants you to rise whenever you rise he wants you to rise in the revelation of who you are and that is what Jesus was doing here verse three says Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands so if I can if you'll allow me to say it like this now Jesus had a revelation of himself he knew who it was he knew who he was so he wasn't just rising to rise but he was rising in the strength of who he was it was it was by the revelation of who he was now often times when we think about this we think about Easter and we think about the great Resurrection the the great Rising when Jesus rose from the dead but we understand that there's there's minor resurrections or there's minor risings however you want to put it but we understand that this event here in in John 13 it had to happen before the great Resurrection so before the great Resurrection which we understand is close there are a people that God is going to have on Earth who are going to rise in the revelation of who they are amen they're going to rise in everyday life in the revelation of who they are you Rose to come to church this morning but God wants you to do more than that he he wants you to have more than that he wants to give you more than that he wants you to to the there to be a greater meaning behind what are you doing while I'm getting up to go to church right he wants you to do more than that he wants you to have more than that he wants you to rise in the strength of who you are and come to church right so it's not just about coming to church it's not just about fulfilling the father's will but it's fulfilling the father's will or doing the father's will in the strength of who you are because it brings a whole new meaning to church it absolutely does it brings a whole new meaning to Parenthood it brings a whole new meaning to being a pastor it brings a whole new meaning to be a husband when you do when you're doing what you're doing when you're doing what you're called to do in the strength of who you are you're not just doing it because you're called to do it but you're doing it in the strength of the revelation of who you are because Revelation is something that uh as we know we we cannot uh give it to ourself uh flesh and blood cannot give it to us but our father in Heaven is the The Giver of all Revelation so I I'm believing that the thought that the Lord has been dealing with me uh in will be a a blessing to you today and uh uh maybe someone will uh be able to rise from the service different to how they came in amen cuz that's our desire isn't it that's our desire for one another is that right but we've got to we've got to understand something that I can't give you Revelation but there is a man who can turn on the light is that right so when when we rise different to the way we sat it means someone was present amen and that's the whole that's that's what God wants to us to see is him he want he wants us to see him he wants us to acknowledge Him there is a man who can turn on the light there is a man who can turn on the light in your life amen but you know the the bride has this uh ability where a lot of people look at the light and they stay focused on the light but what the what the bride's ey do is they look at the light but then they follow the light they they find the the man who turned on the light so the focus goes from the light to the man who turned on the light because the purpose of turning on the light in your life is that you know that he's present in your life that's right amen there is a man not there was or there will be there is a man who can turn on the light amen amen so we are we are um privileged people to have a man who can turn on the light amen amen my Lord my groom my husband is the man who can turn on the light there's only one there's not men there the prophet didn't say there is men who can turn on the light no he said there is a man who can turn on the light there's one there's one amen and that's what we desire for each other's lives amen that the man who can turn on the light would make himself known by turning on the light amen because he's he's there we just want him to turn on the light amen so we we want to look at this thought here R Rising uh by Revelation and we want to we want to kind of start from the beginning and and and work our our way through uh we understand in the revealing of the Lamb that Jesus was revealed or introduced to the people um by John who was the Forerunner these things are very you know these things uh John by the Holy Ghost revealed the Masterpiece the Lamb of God the original Masterpiece all right brother Ram said if it weren't for the Holy Ghost John would have never known the Masterpiece but the Holy Ghost revealed the masterpiece pece to John the original Masterpiece all right the timing was such that God had to wait until the last Old Testament Prophet was going to reveal the Masterpiece we understand that there is a prophecy a virgin shall conceive and 30 years later that person was revealed not the Virgin but the person the Son of God but the timing was such that God had to wait he that Masterpiece couldn't be revealed in Isaiah's time or Moses time or or Jeremiah's time there it he had to wait and there's a reason that he had to wait the same the same reason that the last prophet to the Gentiles is also a forerunner yes it it wasn't just H this seems like a good idea I'll just wait till the last one no there was actually a purpose behind it because God just doesn't do something to do something but God does things God does things purposely amen and not not just to do it to do it but to do it purposely they say okay so God couldn't become flesh as it was in Jesus in the Days of Elijah he couldn't become flesh in the days of Jeremiah he couldn't become flesh in the days of Moses because he was the Fulfillment of the spoken word of the Old Testament prophets okay he was the Fulfillment of that word he was the manifestation of that word so the the word had to be spoken before the word became manifest that's right all right it's the same if you go to Genesis uh chapter 1 it says let there be light there was not light before God said let there be light it had to be spoken and then the light came forth all right so the word the if you can catch the the the way that God works here the word had to be spoken first yes and once the word was spoken then the manifestation came amen all right the the scripture tells us in Ephesians it says all things were made by him and for him by him means by the word by the word everything that is made was made by the spoken word of God so nothing that is made is not made by the spoken word it's all made by the spoken word it's not a part of this and a part of that it's all the word all right so Jes J is God becoming flesh he could not become flesh until that word had been spoken the prophet of God says in uh Christ is identified he says when Jesus come he was the word so was Moses the word Moses the rest of the prophets was the word but they were the word in portion he was the word in full he was the fullness of the word he was the word all right so now we're we're not talking about someone in a as it was in Moses we're talking about someone greater than Moses all right because now we're talking about our Lord we're talking about our original Masterpiece we're talking about the fullness of the word amen he was the fullness of the word he was he was all the prophets made in one us even that right now the prophet of God drops these little things in here like the plus even that and we we we'll get to that Lord willing as we go through but he was all the words he was all the prophets made in one plus even that so he was not just the Old Testament prophets but he was also the new the word of the New Testament prophets cuz he was the fullness of the word he was all the word the prophets was just the word to their age but he was the word to all ages amen he was God himself coming down and manifested in a h in a body of Flesh the word made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen so he wasn't just the Old Testament prophet's word but he was the word of all prophets he was the word to of all ages amen meaning that he was the word of this age that's right is that right he was the word of this age he he was the word of all ages amen meaning that he was the first 2 third fourth fifth 6th seventh he was all he was the word of all ages so we could say it like this he was both the Old Testament and the New Testament yes he was not just the Old Testament but he was both the Old and the new amen notice he was the word made light and become light the word in that generation he was the he was the word of that generation because the prophets of old had spoke of him and he come and Vindicated he was the light of God's spoken word see all the prophets had said had been fulfilled in him see the prophets back here with were the word like God was at the beginning when he said let there be light and Light Came now the prophet said a virgin shall conceive bring forth the son they shall call his name Emmanuel for it'll be God With Us now had spoken the word went out but he was the light what was he the Fulfillment Hallelujah he was the Fulfillment of that word he was the manifestation of that word okay so so we see that the word had to be spoken and then they came manifestation the word was spoken and then there came a manifestation of that which was spoken that's why he could pick up the book in uh Luke 4 and read and say this day this scripture is fulfilled is that right because he was the Fulfillment of this of the word of the prophets all right so we see that he couldn't come earlier he was the manifestation of that word he could not be the manifestation of that word until every Old Testament Prophet that God had ordained to speak had spoke so God has a time and God has a season go that that's why God said through Isaiah a virgin shall conceive but 600 years later the virgin conceived there was a purpose it wasn't just go I'll just wait 600 years no God knew that there are prophets to come after Isaiah but the word still had to be spoken but we understand God we we we are able to we are given God's thinking we understand why he had to wait we understand why he had to wait for 600 years because there were other prophets to follow so the word of God had had not been entirely spoken through Isaiah there were still other prophets there was still more word to come and that's what God was waiting for he he was waiting for the for the end of the Old Testament prophets to speak the last one to speak and then there could come a manifestation you you can again just just um simply you can you can think about this when God God said let there be light he didn't say let there be light the word had to be finished he said let there be light not now the word had to be finished let there be light and once the word was finished then come a manifestation you can think about it in the context again of R uh Genesis 1 where God said let every seed bring forth after through its own kind nothing happened when he said let that let every because not all the word was spoken yet the the the the the word had to be spoken concerning that day and when the word was spoken concerning that day then there could come a manifestation of what was spoken you so so God wasn't complacent and said let every let every um let every seed bring and then say you know I'll just leave it up to them they'll figure the rest out no it it was up to God to bring the word it was up to God to bring all the word not just words but all the word all the word had to be spoken the the mystery of God had to be finished before there could come a manifestation it had to be spoken then there could come a manifestation amen so we're looking at this thought in the in the context of our our Jes our Jesus our lord our groom the original Masterpiece that all the word had to be spoken before he could become flesh it it wasn't just for the sake of it it wasn't just um him having a good idea no there was a purpose there was a purpose all right so it it was the word of the prophets that became manif EST on Earth it's a good time to take me jacket I have this effect on microphones can you hear me BR yep thank you bro so praise the Lord amen so the there cannot be a manifestation without the word being spoken okay um so that is why John was able to um reveal feel the Masterpiece was because the word had been spoken and now the word that had been spoken was being revealed yes amen I think it's a beautiful thing a beautiful thought that you know God God does his work but then he wants to show his his bride he speaks the word the word is creative it comes into manifestation and now he says now what I'm going to do is I'm going to reveal what I've made to my wife I get a it it just it just Thrills my my heart to to to just understand that the the mind of God and sometimes we put God way up and out of out of our reach and but he he operates in such a way that we can relate to him and I just love it so much because the whole the whole purpose of the Lord revealing the Lamb of God through John was to reveal what he'd done yes am because literally if we can say it in this context God had said let there be he was the word a lamb was the word and now God revealed through John to those that had had eyes to see his workmanship and he says I'm I'm here this is this is the manifestation of the word the word is God right this is this is my workmanship this is what I've done and I want to I want to show it to you wow God God wants you to see his Masterpiece amen John John John pulled the the the the cover off the the Masterpiece you know if you build something can you cover it over with a with a sheet or something maybe it's a plaque or there's an unveiling which means if there's an unveiling at some time the Masterpiece is actually there but it's veiled it's veiled so God God waited till the Masterpiece was complete and when the Masterpiece is complete then there's going to be an unveiling so so what what God did through John was to reveal the master the piece amen Reve oh my praise God am me it's it's it's a beautiful thing it's a it's a wonderful thing it's a personal thing it's a it's it's an intimate thing that God's God's desires for you as his bride are are intimate all right so we the word was spoken once the word was spoken it came into manifest ation once that which was now manifested was manifested was now revealed it was spoken created revealed spoken created revealed spoken it C the spoken word be come into manifestation and then the the at at the manifestation it was originally failed that's right all right it when it went from word to manifestation people could see it but they didn't know what it was so there was a veil over it there was a veil over Jesus there was a the Masterpiece was veiled all right so it went from word to manifestation the manifestation was veiled but then there came a time through a through through a forerunner that that that God was going to introduce the people to the manifestation by lifting the veil but the the the Masterpiece was there the unveiling didn't make the Masterpiece the Masterpiece the Masterpiece was always a masterpiece but now the Masterpiece was being revealed amen hallelujah amen all God's works are Masterpiece amen amen praise God praise the Lord amen amen you know the Lord operates in a little different way to us in that he knows how to achieve what he desires to achieve you know God doesn't operate like some mad sinist in a in a science lab and mixing this with that and hoping he gets the results that he he desires he knows what he means he knows what he wants God speaks his word and what he speaks manifests it doesn't matter what you think of it God's word is perfect and what is manifested by his word is perfect it doesn't matter what you think if God says it's a masterpiece that's what it is he he he's he's not deterred he's not discouraged by people saying well I don't see it as you see it it doesn't bother him it doesn't worry him God is always on time and God is always in order all right so Jesus stood on Earth not just as the Old Testament word but also as the New Testament word he's he did not stand as the word in part as Moses stood but he stood as the fullness of the word he stood as the fullness of the godhead bodily meaning that he was both Old Testament and New Testament yes true because if he was if he was only the Old Testament then he wasn't the fullness of the godhead bodily that's right but he was both the Old Testament and the New Testament he he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and that that actually becomes a revelation to you now God can God is still revealing that Masterpiece yes because Jesus rose in the in the strength of where he come from and where he was going to we'll get to that in a little bit later but the New Testament had not been spoken yet when you looked on Jesus this is what you saw he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was the Old Testament and he was the New Testament he came in the volume of the book we could say he came as the new and the old but what in fact you were seeing was this portion yes because he was the manifestation of the word of the Old Testament prophets he was the old and the new but what you were seeing was the manifestation of the Old Testament but he was both the Old and the new amen the same as when God created Adam yeah that's right there was a part of Adam that was in Adam that you didn't know was in Adam right there was a part of Adam Adam was a masterpiece but there was a masterpiece within the Masterpiece but but you couldn't see that hidden part of the Masterpiece the only bit that was manifested was the the adom the male part we could say of the Masterpiece so there was a hidden part heart of Adam that you couldn't see now when Jesus stood on Earth he stood on Earth as this but what you couldn't see was this this is the New Testament this is the Old Testament but it was there all along amen it was there you just didn't know it was there because only the word that was spoken could come into manifestation is that right so it's only the word that was spoken that was in manifestation but there was another portion of him that was hidden that was there it was there on along and that's why when when when God spoke about Adam he spoke about Adam as them he was speaking to one physically we we could say but there was two and God knew who he speaking to and God knew when he was speaking about Adam he was speaking to more than just the Old Testament but he was also speaking to a New Testament part of him he was also speaking to a female part of him that was locked up inside of him that's amen hallelujah amen but I'm making the point here that the only thing that was in manifestation at that time was Adam the only thing that was in manifestation in John 13 was the male the groom the Masterpiece groom amen hallelujah so so God knows what he has manifested God knows what he had created when God created Adam he knew what he had created he testified of the mystery Portion by his word I don't know what the Angels thought when God said them created he them in the Angels how many do you see I know God's God and we just have to trust him on this one but when he said them there was two but there was one but there was two but you but the Angels could only see one right and when Jesus was on Earth he he was the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world but when when God looked down upon him he wasn't seeing one he was seeing two amen amen so there was a male part and there was a there was a female part amen she she was there but you couldn't see her he was the fullness of the word right Jesus Christ was the fullness of the godhead bottle he wasn't the godhead bodily like Adam was sorry like Moses was because Moses was a portion of the male that's right but now when Jesus when the fullness of the word when the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us he was the fullness of the godhead bodily meaning that he was more than what Moses was not just because Jeremiah hadn't spoken yet but because there was a female form there was a female part of our Lord Jesus Christ the in him that wasn't in Moses that's right because he was the not he was not the word in portion but our Lord was the word in fullness all right he was the Old Testament and he was the New Testament okay so we understand that the Bible the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ is that right the Bible the Bible not the Old Testament the Bible yes old and new you can't it's all we need is the New Testament no no you don't the Bible the Bible consists of Old Testament and New Testament is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ which means that there is a portion of Jesus Christ that was not revealed 200,000 year ago amen the same as when the word that God spoke about Adam let us make man in the in our own image the see the word had to be spoken and then the word became flesh but there was a there was a portion of Adam that wasn't revealed and there's a portion of this book that's right 2,000 years ago that wasn't revealed all right but now that portion is being revealed he was the manifestation of the spoken word of the Old Testament prophets plus I'll see if I can go back he was all the all the prophets made in one plus yes right plus even that so he was more than that there was a there was a part of him that was hidden there was a part of him that was not spoken there was a portion of him that wasn't spoken yet but it was there there was a portion of Adam that wasn't spoken yet but it was there it was there all along amen so he wasn't just the Old Testament he was both the Old and the New Testament so as that man Jesus stood upon the Earth there was a part of him that no one knew nothing about no man no woman no Beast No Angel only God knew that there was coming a new testament no one but God knew that there was a she in him no one knew that there was coming a new testament bride no one knew that there was a masterpiece in the masterpiece listen to this Luke likewise also the C the cup after the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood now think about these two words New Testament had they been spoken by men before had these two words ever been re received into people's uh hearing before so the groom was testifying of the New Testament the groom was testifying that there was coming a new testament amen this is the New Testament where in my blood it's a part of me the prophet of God extensively tells us that the the blood is life is that right so so what's going to come forth is a is another portion of the original life this is the cup this is the cup in the New Testament which New Testament in my blood and Peter must have thought then you what I don't understand what you mean Lord but Peter what Peter didn't realize is he was a part of the Lord was actually testifying who Peter was but Peter couldn't connect it true all the apostles except Judas cuz he wasn't a part of the New Testament he wasn't a part of the Masterpiece all right so the the Lord here the the groom is testifying that there is another part of me that's going to come forth there's another part of me that's going to come forth but the only way that this part is going to come forth is if I take my position according to the will of God you you you I hope those that were there this yesterday are joining these things together all right because Christ is our pattern if you want to know how to be a husband if you want to know how to be how to be a a a father Christ is your example if he took his position she's going to find hers that's right is that right it doesn't mean she's going to slot in her into her position there's going to be trials and struggles that she's going to go through but as long as he's in her position he's in his position she's going to find hers so there was a part of there was the the part of uh the groom that was not seen was relying upon him taking his position and if he took his position it's going to allow her to take her position true the rising of the Sun the pro of God says but remember he went there with you in him that's right right see God had never separated the bride from the groom yet you see so when God looked down upon Jesus Christ he saw more than a groom he saw a bride but no one else could see it but the groom was testifying of it because he knew who he was he knew who he was he knew what position he had to take he knew his purpose on Earth and and so he was testifying of who was in him but no one else could see who was in him but when God looked down upon Jesus he saw both male and female he saw both bride and groom my goodness so when we look back you see where let let the mind that was in Christ be in you let take on God's mind when we look back 2,000 years ago what do we see we just don't see a man on a cross that's we just don't see a man taking the lashings we see what God saw by divine revelation amen and we say I was in him I was in him was he when when he took the lashings I was in him when he took the markings how by divine revelation so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride look notice this but God foresaw the bride in the groom the prophet is bringing your attention to something look notice this he's he's he's saying something he's catching your attention he's wanting you to pay attention because it's going to help you it's going to help you to understand where you come from Jesus rose in the strength that he came from God and he was going back to God Amen am mean what does God want you to rise in what does your groom want you to rise in in your own strength in the strength of the church or the strength of the revelation of where you come from amen I came from him and I'm going back to him amen that's the truth glory to God amen amen so God spoke to his Masterpiece at Calvary and from that Masterpiece came forth a new testament from the Masterpiece came forth the New Testament God was now beginning to build another Masterpiece yes in type if you look at Adam the male Masterpiece was first that's right because the woman was made for man not manade for the woman Paul testifies of the order of God am that the woman was made for the man and we found out why yesterday the woman was made for the man not the man made for the woman showing us that the man the male the groom comes first and the Bride Comes second in your your Bible test defies of the order of God the groom comes first the female the Bride Comes second the Old Testament comes first the New Testament comes next all right all are part of the same word the the the Old Testament is the word of God the New Testament is the word of God is that right it's all the same word the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride same word same material there's no difference between the old and the New Testament it's it's God the word is God God is his word so it's all the word of God it's all God so both male and female are God amen amen absolutely 100% that's right nothing else the same word the spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride same word now like we said yesterday that doesn't mean we don't need the groom is that right that doesn't mean we don't need the groom because what's the difference between the bride and the groom position same word the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride the difference is position because God wants to be expressed both through the woman and through the male God wants to be expressed through the woman as a woman God doesn't want to be expressed through the woman as a man no God wants to be expressed through the woman as a woman God wants to be expressed through the man as a man that's why you and your wife husband and wife you are one you are equal but there's a difference in position amen your pastor and you are one same word this the same thing your pastor is you are but there's a difference in position why it it's it's not a domineering thing the the pastor doesn't get up here and say now listen here you know who I am and you better submit to unto me because through the revelation of who I am that's it's not that it's a it's an God wants to be expressed through his Masterpiece family God just doesn't want to be expressed in an office that's right he wants to be expressed in all offices amen it doesn't matter whether you're a a a a father a mother a a a husband a wife a child it's it's God's desire to be expressed through you in the office that you hold outside of that it's a perversion that's right this is why the deception of the of Satan in the garden was so dramatic because Satan knew where to go yes Satan knew if he could get to the woman he knew that he couldn't influence Adam so he went to the woman right because he knew he could influence the woman but what the woman should have done is gone to the to a head she should have gone back to Adam and said listen I've heard someone said this this and this today what do you think about it Adam would have squashed it right and this is why we in in this day where he failed this bride won't that's right all right cuz she knows where to go she's got a revelation of her position Hallelujah all right she knows that she's the weaker vessel and she's not too proud to admit it Hallelujah so when God put Adam to sleep what he was doing was creating another Masterpiece he was taking the hidden portion of Adam and creating another Adam you know we can't become better husbands by our own thinking in cultures the woman is something different to the man let me put it that way nice and easy but God's word takes care of culture hallu now I'm not talking about from here to another country you can have family culture when God opens his word if you're wrong admit it because your wife is an expression of you she is another part of you this why a man who abuses his wife lacks Revelation that's that's all it is okay he lacks Revelation a man that demeans his wife a man that runs his wife down a man's that a man that won't allow his wife to become intimate with him is someone who lacks Revelation and this is why like I said yesterday we we we are seeing an we are seeing a rising in the quality of our marriages because the word is opening amen the word is revealing that my wife is actually actually an extension of me yes what I what she what I am she is what she is I am so if I mistreat her are mistreating me so what God was doing by laying Adam to sleep he was creating a masterpiece for a masterpiece because if the original was a masterpiece then the one that comes out of him has to be a masterpiece it can't be anything different it doesn't matter what you think of it yes if God says the original is a masterpiece then what comes out of it is a masterpiece it doesn't matter what you think God is not even interested in what you think God doesn't unveil his Masterpiece and then he says so what do you think like he's looking for approval of what he's done no he's not unveiling his Masterpiece so you can give your opinion all his work works are perfect Hallelujah Glory he's not interested in your opinion he doesn't need your opinion but we're opinionated even when someone doesn't want our opinion sometimes we give it in the Masterpiece we just go through a few of these I think he says now for nearly 2,000 years God had been again making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a masterpiece a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all fulfilled he fulfilled the Old Testament yes I like the way the prophet says it you it's just the New Testament that's all like it's no big deal it's just the New Testament that's all wow so the peace that God struck off the original Masterpiece there was a piece that he struck off right it was the hidden peace it was a peace that was there all the time right he didn't add a peace he struck off a peace which means the peace was always there the New Testament was always there he was the fullness of the godhead bodily the New Testament was there but he struck that new testament off him glory glory it's just the New Testament that's all he got a piece of him just the New Testament it's just the New Testament that's Soul he fulfilled the Old Testament he fulfilled the Old Testament now I wonder who's going to fulfill the second or the new I think it'll be him again yeah I think I think it'll be him again I don't think it'll be anything different I think the peace that he struck off will fulfill the New Testament yeah because he was the old and the new but he fulfilled the Old Testament and the peace that he struck off is going to fulfill the New Testament okay brother then well don't you mean then she will fulfill the new test yeah that's what I said Glory that's what I said because she is him so he was the fulfiller of the Old Testament but really he is the fulfiller of the Bible amen it's not you fulfilling his will yeah it's him fulfilling his own will amen Glory Hallelujah praise God this is what I mean by you you Minister on these things and it just continues to open and I I I love it so much because it's alive amen we're not preaching a dead word it's a Living Word and as you Minister on it you it more of it comes alive glory to God we continue in this same quote it says now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled another piece to be fulfilled see the new and the old is husband and wife see the O the the old to for for show the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another the Masterpiece is in the making am you see if you're if if you're not careful you you you get yourself mixed up and you you'll have feminism in the message you see it's her it's her it's her it's her no it's him amen it's him it's not her it's him because she is him now this bride will fulfill everything that's in him the question in who is who is the bride the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride she is the word she is him another part Masterpiece is in the making this is a the next one is a is a different um same message but different time as it had taken him 4,000 years to make his Masterpiece now it's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece all right another Masterpiece how can it be another Masterpiece cuz it's a part of the original Masterpiece yes because it's a part of because you're a part of the original Masterpiece you're a masterpiece amen is that right if if I gave you a part if I poured some of this water into a cup this is a part of that what this what this is that is there's no difference it maybe be in a different vessel but the contents is the same amen this is that and that is this glory to God so he's making another Masterpiece he's not taking a different word no he's taking from the the the fullness of the godhead bodily he's taking from the mind of God he's taking from the word of God and creating another Masterpiece he's taking from the groom and creating a bride for the groom another Masterpiece wonderful wonderful wonderful now for nearly 2,000 years God oh sorry where am I at here 12 he is making a bride yes sir he he's hewing the chips now chopping off the world oh Church joining and Creeds and denominations and dogmas all has to be cut away from the church their formal ideas their indifferences their doctrines and things come back and let the master pick up the bow let the master pick you up in his hands strike the word and say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so so what is God doing he's he's stripping everything from you that's not part of his word so the only thing that will be left is the word he's got to take any ideas that you have that aren't his he's taking them out any ideas that that you have of what it means to be a husband that are not his he's stripping them out he's pulling them back he's destroying them he's cutting them off how's he doing it by the opening of the word Hallelujah by the opening of the word God is taking my idea what it means to be a husband from me amen amen God is creating a masterpiece he's stripping away the things that aren't the wood that's right you are the wood you are the Masterpiece that he's making amen you understand he he is making a masterpiece you are the Masterpiece that he is making right you are the Masterpiece that he's making it's like when Michelangelo took that Big Stone of marble I think it was and he be to chip away at it he was chipping away every part that wasn't a part of his vision but but the Masterpiece was there yes it was there he just had to chip away the bits of it that weren't a part of the original Vision so the Masterpiece is hereen we're not waiting for the Masterpiece the Masterpiece is here but God is stripping away from me a parts of the Masterpiece that and a part of his word yes Lord hallelujah hallelujah my ideas my god of what it means to be a father yes God is stripping away my ideas of what it means to be a husband God is stripping a wife if I speak on behalf of my wife her ideas on what it means to be a wife God is stripping away her ideas on what she thinks it means to be a mother God is stripping away why he because he's bringing us to a point where we will be the very manifestation of the word hallelujah not the word end thank you Jesus but the word Hallelujah Jesus was the word amen and this masterpiece is going to be the word she is the word yes amen she will be the manifestation of the New Testament word by his grace how's he doing it by making this a reality Jesus amen by making this personal we've talked about it we've preached about it but now it's becoming a reality the book is becoming a reality the lamb is becoming reality the seals are becoming a reality the contents are becoming a reality to where God will be my wife's husband as this body surrenders to him it's not me being a husband to my wife it's him yes being a husband to my wife through this body Hallelujah beautiful you are not seeing the further development of this body no sir you are seeing the further development of this word in me amen you are seeing God In Action my wife is Experiencing God In Action we're back in the Garden of Eden where my wife is Experiencing God in action and it's the same the other way yes it's not my wife loving me but it's God in her loving me through her you see what you see where where where Parenthood is coming to you you see how God takes care of cultures there's no point preaching at a culture open the word God needs to come into th into those cultures that have their own ideas and open the word and when the word opens it takes care of the culture there's no point coming to me and preaching to me about my family culture there's no point coming to me and preaching to me about how my dad did things amen that's not going to solve the problem that's what surprised you yesterday because it's the opening of the word that fixes the problem when you see your place when the word opens you become the word when the book becomes a reality you become the book Hallelujah I thank God for his presence I thank God that there is a man who can turn on the light yes amen I thank God that he is the one who is turning on the light what what does that mean it means the word becomes a reality you can quote it you can you can memorize it you can do whatever you want but that doesn't mean the light's turned on the evidence that the light is turned on is when when the word becomes manifested the prophet of God said that is the light that is the word when the word becomes manifested and that's what we're seeing we're seeing God as a husband we're seeing God as husbands we're seeing God as wives even pastoring has changed because we had traditional methods of pastoring absolutely we did we we had traditional methods of pastoring but by the opening of the word God is stripping away tradition yes God is stripping away Church ideas Church culture isn't that what he said he's doing here all he has all all has to be cut away from the church both in this form and this form yes that's right praise God God's good amen God is present amen how the Masterpiece is present the New Testament Masterpiece is present he's just taking it it's like if you would have walk through a padic that has burs and then you're picking off you get to the end of your walk and then you begin to pick off things that weren't there when you began so you just but you're there you're just removing parts of parts that are stuck to you that are not you so in in our in our in through our new birth through our through our original birth our through the the through our sex birth we picked up things we picked up things through our through our sex birth and then even through through after our new birth there were still things hanging on to us we we we pick we go to one church and we pick up their culture it's true you if if if New Zealand that goes to Australia every country had its Spirit every country has its culture if you're in Australia for long enough you will pick up the a Australian culture when when one Church comes from to when one person goes from one Church to another church if you're in that church long enough you'll pick up the culture of that church so we we are not exempt for picking up things when I become a dad i d i i was a father as my father was a father when I become a pastor I fathered as my father pastored do you know why God doesn't call the qualified he qualif if is the called am so when we when we first become a masterpiece when we first you was always a masterpiece you didn't even become a masterpiece you was always a masterpiece because you are in him then but in your time from there to now you've picked up things that God is stripping away glory and you will be in this life what you were in him yes Jesus hallu oh walking Oracle of God the word made flesh and dwell among us this is why we're seeing a an elevation in the quality of marriages H nothing to do with me nothing to do with you it's God this is why we're seeing an elevation in the quality of fatherhood we're seeing an elevation in the quality of motherhood nothing to do with you nothing to do with me but but it's all to do with God it's all to do with him opening his word and the opening of the word it causes the traditions and dogmas and our own denominational ideas to roll away nothing to do with me nothing to do with you I am his workmanship and praise God he alone oh there's times when I tried to pick up the hammer you know he wasn't moving fast enough for me you know so I thought I'd give him a hand well you know what that does huh it just delays the works even more because then he's got to come back and fix up what I tried to fix up it's the truth it ain't nothing but the truth amen 187 amen L Lord Make Me mold me make me Lord what I should be then there'll be a different thing so he's he's acknowledging the Masterpiece creating another Masterpiece that I'm not my own Masterpiece but he's the one who's making me says then if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me yes sir he is cutting you out now he is cutting you out now who is the you the Masterpiece he is cutting you the Masterpiece exists yes Lord though God be still working on it the Masterpiece has come to a place now where it can testify for itself that it exists Hallelujah he is cutting you out now amen cutting you down to his word only cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get you back to a bride for the son another Masterpiece part of the word the word oh say I I don't have any dogmas I don't have any Creeds Yeah well yeah you do and you just testify that you did because that idea that you just spoke is wrong so your own words condemn you yes your own words cond vict you yes oh we all need cutting down absolutely we all need trimming I don't care whether we're at the place where God's taking a sledgehammer and knocking off a big part or God is refining he's still removing a part of you that's not you Hallelujah the word the word the word we're coming back to the word we're coming back to the word get back to the word the prophet would say we're coming back to the word Hallelujah I am the word but I'm coming back to the word only amen it's not going to be me a part of me and a part of him it's all going to be I'm all him amen we're coming back to the word back to the word how are we coming back to the word because he's removing everything from us that is not a part of the word thank you Lord glory to God we're on the threshing floor the threshing floor is when you get thrown up in the air and and and when there's a breeze the wheat gets thrown up in the air and as a result of being thrown up in the air the the wheat is heavier yes than the Shar so the the wheat gets thrown up but the breeze that comes through blows what is not the wheat away amen Ruth met Boaz where on the threshing floor Hallelujah I'll meet you in there h hallelujah hallelujah so in the in the molding of the Masterpiece it means that the how can I say this the the this the person with the vision and the Masterpiece have to come together it means that in order for the bride masterpiece to become the word only the only way that that can happen is if the groom comes to the bride because it's him molding her it's him revealing himself all right so there has to be someone present for me to be who I am today I'm not who I am today who I was yesterday or the day before I've felt a change in my life in the last two weeks right the the the the thing that God wants you to understand in that is who did it because what the PO what what's the point of a change if we don't acknowledge the one who made the change is that right the purpose of the change the purpose of God changing me yes is for him to testify me I'm here because you can't do thisall you can't do this there's only one there is only one yes who can change you that's right I believe that and that is him that is my groom when when Isaac took Rebecca into the tent there was a change that's right there there weren't men in the tent there was one it was Isaac and Rebecca Rebecca came out of that tent different to how she went in the angel of the Lord receives a vision of a little tent and he saw people going in with infirmities do you know who they were masterpieces yes they were masterpieces and by that Union by that meaning he said the the the Lord said I'll meet you in there I'll meet you not you I'll meet you personal I'll meet you in there they went in with infirmities they came out whole by that meeting they would changed I'm being changed yes it's not a oneof thing it's a it's a it's a chip after chip it's a cutting after a cutting but the point is I'm being changed I'm there he met me in there well had you know because I'm Different to how I went from the time that I went went into the tent I'm different part of the word the word so God is making a masterpiece wife he's got to do it the same way he did the first one he'll do this he'll he'll make the second Masterpiece the same way that he made his first Masterpiece as it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece in doing it he does it by his his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces beautiful because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word amen any dirt trash injections it'll break but heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never break to God Amen so the same way that he made the original Masterpiece is the same way he's making his masterpieces and we know that's the many membered body of Christ all right he's making his masterpieces he's not making it another way so if we understand how God made his original Masterpiece then we're going to get a glimpse of how God is going to make his second Masterpiece and he made his original Masterpiece by the word now he's making another Masterpiece he can't make it another way he's got to make it the same way the original Masterpiece it had to be the spoken word that became manifested so the word had to be spoken first and then the word that was spoken become manifest and then the word that was manifest become revealed that was the original way and now the second Masterpiece is going to make the same way so the mind of God the word of God has to be spoken then the word of God is going to become manifested and then the manifested word is going to become revealed wow Mighty God the same way see you thought you could get there by praying harder well there's nothing wrong with praying harder but why you just drop the idea of that you can get there by your prayer Jesus didn't become the manifested word because he prayed hard the reason he prayed hard is was because he was the manifested word see the moment that you you think that I'll become the word when I do this or after I do that or after I overcome this or after I overcome that you got the picture Twisted you got to turn it to the right you got to look at it right you got to see it how God sees it and when you see it how God sees it when you see you how God sees you yes then you'll overcome yes you're not an overcomer when you overcome you're an overcomer therefore you can overcome amen David wasn't King when he became King David was King when God said he was King but he was always King in the mind of God am amen see you didn't become a masterpiece when you overcome you didn't become Masterpiece when you finally overcome that that that Spirit of lust but that's how the devil wants you to think well you know if if you if you can just you know what listen listen Billy you know once you get past this lust thing then you'll be then you'll be a masterpiece and that's wrong it's AB absolutely wrong it's 100% wrong the revelation of who you are allows you to overcome David went down to the battlefield knowing who he was amen you're you're you're a masterpiece but God is chipping away the parts of your thinking that are not his thinking and he says you're a masterpiece but when you say I'm a masterpiece when I he says H I got to strip that off you you're a masterpiece therefore you will overcome see this this is how the devil Keeps Us in bondage he does I know all right I I know I I I was there he keeps us in bondage by by by getting us to believe or think like he thinks and that's exactly what he did to the woman in the Garden of Eden he got her to think like he thinks and then it become manifested but God is chipping away those silly ideas the word is the word you thinking that if you think that this is the word when you prove it is you're wrong because it is and God don't care what you think of it Jesus was not the word when he rose from the dead no but they said if thou be if thou be come down if thou be save thyself that wasn't his thinking but he was tempted to think if I if I am who God says I am then why am I where I am the circumstances don't dictate who you are now you can be def in a defeated place that's right yes sir but does that mean that you're not a part of the a part of the original Masterpiece when Eve fell does that mean now she wasn't part of Adam huh in her Fallen condition she was still yes the Masterpiece of Adam amen we came into this world Fallen you didn't become the Masterpiece when you come to church 10 times in a row oh you didn't become the Masterpiece when you preached your first sermon or gave your first special or dedicated your life to God no the reason you could dedicate your life to God is because you were a masterpiece your dedication to him doesn't make you anything the reason that you can dedicate your life to him is because of who you are amen hallelujah amen so we come Fallen Glory do you realize I was a fallen Masterpiece yeah wow thank because that's what Adam's bride was that is what Redemption is all about he come to redeem listen that which was lost that which was Fallen meaning that at one point it wasn't Fallen but became Fallen you you at one point you weren't lost but you became lost amen but just because you were Fallen God didn't say well you know you're not a part of me anymore because you fell oh God forbid that's right God knew what he was looking at God knew who he he was Redeeming the same as Adam knew who he was redeeming whether she Adam was given the choice to go with her her or stay in the garden but he had to go yes Lord because if he had if he let her go he was letting a part of himself go so even in in the evees in the woman's Fallen condition she was still a part of Him Glory Hallelujah you've always been a part of him even when you were dead in sin you were a part of him you were his Masterpiece you didn't know it but you was his Masterpiece and in the story of redemption he comes down to pick up that which was Fallen hallelujah what for to redeem it back and in in the time where he's redeeming it back he's working on her because when Redemption is fully completed you be as you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world yes amen we we're in a time of redemption hallelujah hallelujah when Ruth met Boaz on the threshing floor it was in a time of redemption amen he was redeeming her he was bringing her back that's right why because she was a part of him and you was a part of him right you young people listen to me you're not a part of him when you get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost testifies that you're a part of himall God seals who's his amen the seal doesn't make them his yeah he seals who's his amen when the when the seal goes on the box car as the prophet would saying it's testifying whose it is yes but it didn't make it whose it is it was always his you are always his but the Seal of the Holy Ghost on your life testifies that you are always his glory to God you was always a masterpiece you was always a part of him beautiful hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen the Lord's good the Lord's wonderful amen praise God how how how's he restoring her how's he redeeming her by his word what what did what did Boaz do to Ruth when Ruth met her on the when when Ruth met him on the threshing floor he spoke he spoke to her that word had redeeming power she just had to believe what he said he redeemed her by his word this is why if God didn't speak we couldn't be redeemed yes but the first the way that he created the first Masterpiece is the way he's creating the second Masterpiece he is bringing that Masterpiece back unto himself because that's where she started she started in him and she's going to end up in him Jesus rose from supper what in the strength of the revelation of what of himself he wasn't relying on Peter having the revelation he he wasn't relying upon the the man who gave Jesus the scroll to have the revelation of who he was you see you can't rely on anyone you can't rely on your pastor right God wants you to be a revelation to you amen we shouldn't need podcasts to remind to to tell us who we are but we should wake up in the I'm not saying that those things are wrong but we should be able to wake up in the morning in the strength amen of the revelation of who we are though though the the rest of the world perish and you be the only one left on this world you should be able to rise in the strength of who you are and fulfill God's will for your life amen amen think about this Jesus had no one to lean on he he he didn't have a church to go to that preached the open book he didn't have a church to go to that preached this day this scripture that's right the book was sealed to the church yes that's right but to the Masterpiece it was open to the Masterpiece the book was not sealed the mystery of the book was revealed Luke 4 this day this scripture what was he doing he was testifying that the book is no more an open book but the seven seal revealed the content of the book The Seven seal revealed himself as being the contents of the book The Seven seal took the book this is not in the script okay the seven seal took the book remember he was seated and he rose and took the book out of the hand the book changed hands and he opened the book to where it was written of him who took the book the one who took the book was the manifestation of the book the manifestation of the book took the book and opened the book where it was written of him and said this day what did he say I am the manifestation of this book sir I come in the volume of the book yes and they said is that not Joseph's son the book was open but the book was closed the lamb come forth and took the book Luke 4 but it was closed but it was open yes but it was open to the manifestation of the book this is Rich bro this this is fresh this is Rich it was open to the manifestation of the book that's and it was closed to those who weren't the same way he created the first Masterpiece is the same way he's going to create the second Masterpiece you know Peter James and the disciples some I feel like someone's thinking went there will you say about Peter Jam they weren't a part of the manifestation of the Old Testament they were a part of the manifestation of the New Testament but there was one there was one who could take that book oh boy there was one in Luke 4 there was one the scripture said he went there as as custom as it was as it were custom he went to church as it were custom but there was one who could take the book just one and what reveal the contents no one else was worthy no one else was able praise God no one else was worthy no one else was able just one that's why the Masterpiece really is only ever revealed to the Masterpiece oh we're in a good time brothers and sisters the problem of God say if there's ever a time I could choose to live it would be now he he's he's say it like this he's looking down and us saying preach it brother it's the truth it's the truth where amen we're in a place where the groom is revealing the second Masterpiece to the second Masterpiece amen yes there is a man who can turn on the light that's that's that's my groom this this is why you can check if you want to I can send you all a copy of my notes if you read my notes you'll wonder where this come from so do I because it didn't come from my notes but it's a time we're living in a time we're not relying upon man to put quotes together we can still use quotes but we're not relying upon man to put quotes together we're relying upon the man who can turn on the light to reveal the present tense masterpiece Amen to herself thank Lord sir I stand I stand in a of him cuz when you see what he's done you think man I could never have done that he says I know that's why I had to do it what a time what a what a time that we're living in where God can come down and take his word and reveal the content there's only one that is worthy to take the book only one who is worthy and able the groom took the book and found where it was written of him and spoke concerning himself yes testifying that I am this word I am the manifestation of the word of Isaiah yes and you know what Elsie's thought said I don't care what you think of Isaiah I don't care what the websites say say what you want it doesn't discourage me I know who I am yes you you think now is the only time where we're struggling with what we're struggling with oh come on that's that's not it at all what what what we the reason we are are seeing what we are seeing here is because it was the same thing that was happening there that's right when the when the original Masterpiece was being revealed that there were demonic spirits unbelieving Spirits the reason that they're here is because they were there or all we are seeing now is what was there the the things that were coming into manifestation here are coming into manifestation there whether it be the word of God or the or the or the word of the devil it makes no difference whether it be a h uh whether it be God or the devil we're we're seeing both manifested they were manifested here they came into manifestation here why because it's manifesting time at at the time where where the where the manifestation took the book and F the contents of the book there was there was both good and evil were coming into manifestation well that's what we're seeing now it's a rejoicing time oh it's a time to fear it's not a time to fear it's a time to Rejoice Hallelujah when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises the standard that's right brother preach on dress you preach on makeup you get those earrings hooked out of those girls you preach on it bro no he raises the standard by raising by opening the word am it's manifesting time thank you Lord right that's where we are that's that that that's where that's where the original Masterpiece was and the same things have to be here why because God is proving his Works yes that's right God's proving his works it don't matter what comes the Masterpiece is the Masterpiece and the devil can't make a masterpiece not a masterpiece the Masterpiece was will always be the Masterpiece it was always the Masterpiece that if you're a part of that original Masterpiece there's nothing on this Earth that Satan can do to make you not a part of it it's not possible praise God that's right amen we are his workmanship we are his workmanship so we thank God Amen we thank God we're not our own workmanship amen amen so the the same way that he created the first Masterpiece is the same way he's going to take he's going to create the second Masterpiece so the first Masterpiece was the manifestation of the spoken word of God so therefore the second Masterpiece the bride Masterpiece what she is going to be is the manifestation of the spoken word of God Amen which means that she can't come into full manifestation in the third messenger's age the third age or the fourth age or the fifth age or the or the second age he's got to wait until the the word of God has been spoken yes that when the once the New Testament gospel has been spoken then there's going to come a time where the second Masterpiece is going to be revealed this is why it says in in Revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh what is the seventh the last amen people are looking for who are looking for an a don't have a revelation of the manifestation of the word now listen you you don't think that that wasn't there in jesus' time right oh yeah they put him on a cross and went looking for another yes he was the manifestation of the word of God that's true they cut John's head off the Forerunner why because they didn't believe what he said but that didn't bother God and nor does it today amen when they cut the seventh Angel's head off that's right it makes no difference I mean that didn't happen literally but what I you understand what I'm saying that they're destroying his influence they're destroying his character and by dest destroying his character that destroy his influence but that didn't make any difference that doesn't make any difference to God and nor does it make any difference to the manifestation of the word so it's not by the word it's by the spoken word amen it's by the spoken word of God this is a spoken word bride yes she once was an attribute in him that's then she became the spoken word of God hallu Amen she became she was the spoken word of God and now she has become the manifestation of the spoken word of God this is why you can't disconnect you can't the the original Masterpiece you can't you there's no way that you could disconnect him from the Old Testament prophets no it's it's it's not possible because he was the word that was spoken by the Old Testament prophets right so so now in in this time you you are the word that has been been spoken by the seven messengers of the seven Church ages you are that word you were that word but now that word is comeing to manifestation and this is why you can't be separated from the message of the hour yes because you are the very manifestation of that word I don't know what God's done in your life but sometimes God proves that because sometimes you try to run from this message but you realize you can't run from something that you a part of well you can but you can only run for so long that's the truth that's a testimony of my life things got too much things got too hard I said I'm out of here but you can't run from something for too long that you're a part of Amen so sometimes it's not even the the the the the the wrong wrong spirits that come in and and try and uh pull you from the the message of the hour sometimes it's you that's sometimes you run from your groom but you realize you can't run for too long because there's only God only allows you to go so far and then you you you stop running because it's too hard you started to run because it's too hard but then you stopped running because it's too [Laughter] hard because it's not you it's him it it that when things become too hard we put too much on ourself we do Jesus said come unto me all you that are weak and heavy laden I will give you rest the the reason that Things become too hard is be because we haven't given some things to him so she's going to be the spoken she is the spoken word of God she is the manifestation of the word she is the word made flesh amen God has been working to this point God always finishes his projects we are his workmanship the bride is the workmanship of the spoken word of God and that is what the evening message has produced now if they don't like what has been produced that's not my because they didn't like what the Old Testament prophets word produced you think because you're the bride of Christ you're going to be liked no sorry why you might be liked among family you might be liked um by the bride but anyone outside of the Bride they ain't necessarily going to like like you too much amen you might have friends or you might have this or you might have that but that friendship can only go so far this is why it's important for young people not to be unequally yolked that's right because you don't want to be married to someone who's not a part of the original Masterpiece this is why the prophet of God said get the Holy Ghost amen he didn't say it just to say it he said it because the the Seal of the Holy Ghost on an individual's life is the evidence that they're a part of the Holy a part of the Masterpiece and if two if if if a boy and a girl come together with the Holy Ghost then they're a part of one another yes all there's some good-looking girls out there but that don't mean nothing because Satan has perverted beauty beauty is not on the outside beauty is on the inside amen so uh the scripture says it shall be light in the evening time huh it shall be light in the evening time this is one of the prophet's most favorite sayings and you say you sometimes think man he says that a lot and you just move on oh there he goes again and you move on but he's saying something without saying something he's testifying that someone's present because how else can it be light unless there's a man to turn on the light all right the only way that it can be light in the evening time is if there's someone who can turn on the light that's right is that right so so the reason that that that the the reason that you see is because someone turned on the light that's right the reason that you see what God desires for you to see is because someone turned on the light that's true and when the light is turned on it pushes back Darkness amen but there is a man who can turn on the light the reason that I can see myself the way that I see myself today is because someone turned on the light but there's only one who can turn on the light Hallelujah all right it's not men who can turn on the light there is a man who can turn on the light yes and this is why I am seeing myself different all the time why because I believe the light is not just a flick of a switch but the light is like a dimmer but God is increasing the intensity of the light and as the intensity of the light increases it just pushes back the darkness it's it's natural the light doesn't have to say okay come on let's have you you know let us see who can win this battle ah the light just comes on and the Darkness go po say where did it go he turn it off poo comes back turn it on poof he goes but God doesn't have a switch on and a switch off it's a dimmer so the intensity is becoming greater that's right and the in as the intensity increases it's pushing back my own ideas it's pushing back my own thoughts it's pushing back my family traditions it's pushing back my family culture it's pushing back Church culture it's p pushing back Australian culture but it's being replaced by light it's being replaced by light God doesn't empty the house to keep it empty the reason he's emptying it is to fill it so light is taking the place of Darkness cuz my own idea is darkness my way of thinking is darkness my culture is Darkness the Australian culture is Darkness the lwf culture is Darkness but he's not just throwing out Darkness but how he is throwing out darkness is replacing it with light he's replacing it with himself so the only thing that will be left is him he's everything other than him is Darkness true the only thing that will be left is the word which is the light the manifestation of the word is light the only thing that will be left is the manifestation of the word this is why you can't parent like your dad did you can't you fail you fail you you you fail anyway but you understand what I mean you say well my dad was successful so I'm going to parent the way he parented it's not going to work my dad was a a successful Pastor so I'm going to Pastor the way he did not going to work not going to work you you can take what he did but you got to add to it you can take what your parents did but now God's opening the word and he's adding two what your parents did because your parents operated at a level that the book was open this is I said this yesterday this is why you shouldn't kick yourself and and because now you're up here but you parented down here and now up here you say I wish I had a I should have but the reason that you can say that you couldn't say that here because when you were here you are parenting to the fullest of the knowledge that you had the fullest of the Revelation that you had that's how you parented that's how you you husband right Lord but the reason you can say I should have is because the words opened and the words lifted you up and now you can look back and down in Hinds side I say I shouldn't have done that well you're right you you shouldn't have but you didn't know that then but because now now your children are here right and this is why when as a as a mother and a father we sit down with our children and we talk about Parenthood and we talk about well this is what we this this is how we did it but what we realiz is that we did it wrong but it's not wrong as in we rebelled that's right you know we went again we didn't go against the word we didn't know and God doesn't hold you accountable for what you don't know so stop causing yourself stop beating yourself up about things and causing your causing yourself to become accountable for things that you didn't know you got to stop that God's in control otherwise you'll live in the past right and what happens when you live in the past you repeat it either you repeat it or your kids will God doesn't hold you accountable for what you don't know am but we're growing my goodness if I look at the way that I was a husband to my wife when I get married 30 years ago I wish I had you got to stop that although I wish I did cuz it would have saved her a lot of pain but I didn't know but what I know now I can put into practice amen I don't have to repeat history I don't have to be a husband like I was a husband 30 years ago God's given me the ability to come up higher thank you Lord how how could John how could John see Revelations 4 when he was in Revelations 3 that's right and John got the revelations 4 and he said man I wish I knew this when I was in Revelations 3 I wouldn't have made all these mistakes but God said the reason that you weren't up here is because I it wasn't time for you to be up here the reason you can say that now it's because I have invited you up and I have lifted you up and I have given you a heavenly vision and now you can look back down and say man I wish I had what I had now down there well we do the same thing in fatherhood we do the same thing in motherhood we do the same thing as a as a as a as a wife we do the same thing as a husband we do the same thing pastoring God's in control God's God's the one that lifts us God's the one that raises us go God God the one that allows us to do better my wife should say praise God amen amen praise the Lord so now we're we're we're we're we're living in a time I'm going to finish this here where what is what is the time uh 10 10 10 oh no 12:30 is that right 12:30 quarter to one okay let's let's finish here so we're living in a time now where God through a forerunner through a message is revealing his second Masterpiece to the master to herself brothers and sisters not to the world not to Mom and Dad perhaps this is personal this is I'll meet you in their moment this is where my wife's song come from this this is this is that moment this is uh a moment where where we're living in a time now where the the the shadow of Isaac taking Rebecca into the tent we're living in that time we're living in that time where Isaac broke the veil of Rebecca he broke the Seal of Rebecca in that tent yes and she could never be the same after that meeting this is what God desires for you as Isaac came to Rebecca they were moving toward one another as Isaac came to Rebecca this is God's desire for you you're moving it's his desire for you to meet and become one and break the seal from around your life the day of redemption is here this is God's desire for you I think it's interesting when the prophet talks about the third pool and his he he's up on the mountain and he said I had my hands raised but then he said a sword drop down into my hand so he raised his hands but as he was raising his hands there was a sword coming see the third pull is all about a meeting I'll meet you in there the sword coming to the hand it's about a union it's about two people becoming one how by God removing the veil from your life amen amen we are living in that time we're living in the time of the unveiling Rebecca was reveal red Isaac revealed Rebecca Isaac revealed Rebecca to Rebecca that's right Rebecca didn't fully understand the connection between her and him but he revealed her to her amen she was not a mystery to him she was a mystery to herself you are not a mystery to him but you are a mystery to yourself God is revealing you to you amen Rebeca Isaac is speaking to Rebecca saying what I am you are amen what I am you are they were in Fellowship they were there was a man in that tent who could turn on the light yes concerning Rebecca and push back all spiritual Amnesia that she might have had he pushed that back there was a man who can turn on the light there was only one eler couldn't do it right ela's work was done but there was one who had to come on the scene to reveal the Masterpiece to the Masterpiece William bram's work is done the man is it's done people want to say well he didn't finish his work well that's your opinion as it was in the time of if I can just dramatize a little bit there were th those people in the days of Isaac and Rebecca yes Isaac Ela never finished his work Rebecca could look at him say you blind leaders of the blind what in this world are you talking about I know he's finished his work you can't tell me that and it influenced me to doubt I know who I am amen do we thank God Amen that we're living in that time yes it's a precious time it's a time of intimacy it's a time where my intimacy with my Lord is growing and you know what that does it causes an intimacy between me and my wife it causes it I I could say it a little different it causes a growth in my Intimacy in my level of intimacy with my wife because what happens between me and God is reflected between me and my wife this is why we can't be who we are are ordained to be without the Lord in our lives but when when when he increases when he when he increases when he his when he reveals a further revelation of himself to me it has has an effect here it has an effect on this level Earth level it has an effect how I father you know what that causes to happen it it's the same thing with my wife when when God reveals things to my wife it causes her it causes a change in her relationship with me this is why we're dependent upon God to be who we're called to be in this hour and we can't be it by education we can't be it by more services if you understand what I mean if we have more services then will know more no no there's nothing wrong with having more services but come to service with the understanding you can't do it you come into these doors say Lord I I know what needs to be done but I can't do it I'm depending on you oh you watch God move and the prophet of God knew that the those seals had to be open but he couldn't do it he couldn't do it himself he knew what needed to be done but he couldn't do it as a a husband I I know if I can just say if I can speak for two weeks ago all right I knew I knew that I could be better but I can't produce it but there's something within me that knows I could be better but you know I I look at the the master Craftsman I I say Lord I I know it needs to be done but I can't do it and would would you do it you know what he does he takes his he he he takes takes his word and he reveals it and in the revealing of the word it breaks things away that have been causing me not to be who I desire to be brother the look you you got from glory to glory right God does that and then you say wow Lord there there's more it's like John went to from Revelations 3 to Revelations 4 but then he went from Revelations 4 to Revelations 5 Revelations 5 to Revelation 6 and Revelation 6 to Revelation 7 Revelation 7 to Revelations 8 it was a it was a journey there there was more there was more there was more there was War One seal another seal another seal another seal that's right there's more praise God we're depending on him brother ELR if you'd like to come God bless you trust you have a blessed afternoon and I'd like to if the Lord will we'll we'll pick this up this afternoon and look at some slides of uh Genesis 2 and Revelations chapter 5 so God bless you all amen thanks BR God bless you that was absolutely action-packed that's absolutely wonderful you know I I um I was thinking as brother Daniel was preaching you can start playing that song so long um you know even maybe a year ago we couldn't say many these things amen and and it's just so wonderful how God is revealing more and more um brother Daniel made made a statement he said he said you have the spoken word and then you have the manifestation and the manifestation is real already but it takes time for the Revelation to hit that's exactly where we're at amen the manifestation is here Christ is here amen and it's and it's and we've been saying it for years but God God is revealing just a little more and a little more and he summarized it so beautifully here at the end when he said it's a dimmer switch it's not just a flick and it's all on that will blow us away amen that will blow the fuse but it's a dmer switch and God is just turning up the D dmer switch just little by little by little and we're just seeing more and more and more and I I I just I love how God does things and I also love how God come uses a vessel that is wired differently made differently says things differently as we're looking at the same word amen hallelujah um the other thing I want to just mention is Luke 4 that Luke 4 will never be the same for me I mean Luke 4 and Revelation 5 coming together just so beautiful I mean when the bridegroom Masterpiece Hallelujah took the book opened the book and identified that's me this day the scripture is fulfilled amen hallelujah and and what happened in in Luke 4 they raised up and said well who's this guy don't me know he's you know isn't this Joseph's son and so and what did it cause them the religious leaders wanted to crucify him wanted to Stone him there I mean for what for identifying this is me Hallelujah because they couldn't handle the Revelation but they couldn't stop the Masterpiece hey amen praise the Lord let's stand
