[music] I worship you. I welcome you here. [music] Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust everyone is excited to be in the house of the Lord tonight. It's a very exciting, very special services this weekend and we've just had an absolutely wonderful time so far. Just really thankful for [music] the youth service we had last night. I can highly recommend it to those who were wasn't [music] able to fit into the category to come to uh to have a listen to it. It's uh [music] we've sent out the link this morning as you would have seen. Um so highly recommend it and we just had a lovely time with the breakfast also this morning. I wonder if I can ask you to take your seats just for a moment if you don't mind. Um, so, uh, it kind of feels strange to welcome brother Daniel and Sister Cheryl halfway through the weekend because we've we've had had a bit of them already, but um, it's just a real privilege to have you both here and may God just make you feel very welcome among us. you're just [music] very very close friends of the church and um we just want to recognize you and appreciate you just love you to bits [music] and um it's um I I put the the um in fact Bella put the request on the chat on what was it Thursday night? Yes. effort that I was going to go through to Oakuckland and pick Brother Daniel up and and I was so aware of your prayers um [music] driving through there was just a real real privilege and I want to say thank you to to you for your prayers and thank you Lord for [music] um for keeping me and I um I got there good time. There was obviously not a lot of traffic on the road that time of night. [music] Um but we uh we left and came back um Friday morning and man I enjoyed the trip. It was so good. [laughter] Brother Daniel and I didn't stop talking for a second. We just going and going and going just sharing different things that we've been looking at and so it's just been absolutely wonderful and we've just had a wonderful time with him so far. Um just really excited about the weekend also. Um so just a little bit of background. Um, where this weekend came from was I think it was was it at the youth camp that you that you did a a a service. Um, [music] and uh and a few of you who were there or listened to it recommended it to me. Um, and I went and listened to it and I phoned brother Daniel. I said, "Man, this is [music] so good. Do you think you can spread it over three services and and come preach it here by us over [music] a weekend?" And brother Daniel's answer was, "Well, brother Chad has asked me to come preach to his family camp." Um, so and it's the same topic. So, absolutely, we we'll do that, God willing. So, of course, then after that one service, he's expanded it to a whole weekend worth of services um over a family camp. So, it's um it's obviously the Lord [music] grows the thought as you go and just really excited to what what what the Lord is going to say to us tonight. Um [music] and really this morning and last night we had glimpses of the thought, I believe. So, just be yourself and let the Lord use you. We we uh we want you to be at home among us. You are really you're part of the family. Um, something else that I forgot to give feedback of on Wednesday night and someone asked me afterwards and I could kick myself was I asked you to pray last Sunday for the &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um, barbecue we had with the ministers in town. Um, and I I just wanted to say I'm so thrilled how it went. Um, we had a really positive time with them and um, they uh, they were all surprised that um, it was the biggest turnout apparently they've ever had for an end of year function which is pretty good. I think the barbecue invite had something to do with it maybe. I don't know. Um but yeah, we it was just a very relaxed time and I I guess it would have been helpful for them to see [music] that we are normal people with normal ways and so forth and just [music] let the light shine. Um we had I hope that's not going to embarrass her, but we we had Amanda there [music] too who was um very kindly offered to help us with getting things [music] done and so on. And she was the light of the party. She was so good and uh they loved her to bits and she um she made such a difference. So it was it was lovely to see that um that gift in her life [music] shining too. So it was real special. Praise the Lord. So I don't want to take any further time. We we [music] want to give the word all the time. So I I have to say thank you so much for those those song [music] items. It was really special. and Sister Julia, I think that was your best best item ever. Proud of you for playing and singing in the same item. That that takes courage. [music] So that was real special. Thank you. Praise the Lord. Let's stand together. Maybe let's just sing that same song again as I call brother Daniel up. Just like you promised. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Bless you. It doesn't feel like he's baptized. It feels pretty [music] light. Praise the Lord. Amen. Good to be with you. Thank you musicians. God bless you. Appreciate you very much. Sorry, that's my coffee. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you. Good to be with you all. And uh it's a real honor and privilege to be here again. And uh it's wonderful to have my wife with me. There she is. I'd like to know where she is. So uh praise the Lord. Uh it's a blessing. It's an honor uh just to be just to be with you and and uh share the things that the Lord places in our hearts and reveals to us. Um the focus of life is him. He he is our focus. You know that's the the bride's focus is is always her groom and uh we are thankful that we know who we are focusing on. We are focus we are are thankful that we know who we are looking at who is present who is here with us who is guiding us and who is leading us. Uh I trust that the services uh will be a blessing to you. Um they they certainly been a tremendous help to me and you know sometimes these type of things don't come without experiences uh trials, tears, laughter, joy, all those good things. But uh we thank the Lord for who he is uh in our lives. Amen. So, we're not we're not strangers to one another by by any means. So, um we we will just um go go into the the word this morning this evening, isn't it? Um so, um yeah, we we thank the Lord for the opportunity just to to share these things with you. And this this evening I may just be building up a little bit. Um just and then just beginning to to uh to to touch on the things [clears throat] that we will look at over the next couple of services. And once again, I'm just going to start my stopwatch. So, uh praise the Lord. Um I think I've got this thing worked out. Yeah, there we go. So, um, the thought tonight, well, it's really going to be over the weekend, but is the book in the home, the book in the home, and then as a as a subtitle, the the changing of the scene. Uh, so we want to pick this up in Luke chapter chapter 19. And, uh, the picture before this is kind of the the story here. This is the uh Luke Luke um sorry 19 is the the uh story of of Zakius at least the part of it that we're we're going to to read about. Um so we'll we'll read here from from verse verse one of uh Luke 19. And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And behold, there was a man named Zakius, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus, who he was, and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus ca came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said unto him, "Zakius, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at thy house." And he made haste and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner. So we want to just draw the the thought here this evening from uh verse five there where Jesus said in in halfway through he says Zakius make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house. &gt;&gt; So we'll we'll catch up with that in a little bit. Let's just turn to the book of Revelation chapter 5. uh this will will be our our this is our focus. This is where we will end up over the next couple of services. Uh Revelation 5 uh 1 through to 7. It says, "And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Amen. So, we're going to look at that a little bit this even this this evening um and just work our way through that over the next couple of services. But let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord God, you know our needs, Lord, you are the only one Lord who can rightly divide the word. You are the only one who can reveal this book. And Lord Jesus, you know how much that we need you tonight. &gt;&gt; And Lord God, may we just identify that. &gt;&gt; May we connect with that, Lord, to the best of our ability. Lord, we we may not know to the extent of how much we actually need you, &gt;&gt; but Lord God, we do know that we need you here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we pray heavenly father that you would do what only you can do &gt;&gt; and that is Lord reveal the contents of this book &gt;&gt; that Lord you might receive glory and honor through the revealing. We pray in Jesus Christ's precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can take your seats uh tonight. So, we just want to just just want to speak on this Luke chapter 19 a little bit here. And you'll see it before Luke 19. I've got Luke 4 uh 14-22. And you probably understand that that is the scripture where Jesus goes to the synagogue as it were custom. I think last time I was here, I ministered on ministered on rising by revelation. And uh that's where that this thought um uh part of that thought came from. But we understand that that Jesus went went to church. He went to the synagogue as it was his custom to do. And uh he he sat down and uh then he was um asked to to read the scroll. So he stood up and took the book which was closed and he opened the book in order to find where it was written of him. And he begin to read the scripture concerning himself. Um the spirit of the lord is upon me etc etc. So what he did in that in that uh in that Luke uh chapter 4 was he was revealing himself to be the book. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he was the word. We understand that uh John 1 in the beginning was the word. The word was the the word became flesh and the word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us. He was the word but here he was identifying himself as the book. He was the word made flesh. Now that book is the book that said Zakius I come down make haste for today I must abide at your home. All right. So, we're looking at the book in the home &gt;&gt; because the book &gt;&gt; beautiful &gt;&gt; invited himself &gt;&gt; to Zakius's house. &gt;&gt; Now, he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. You may not remember it. I don't think you do. But you went to Zakius's house. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right. Because you was in him. &gt;&gt; That's right. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; All right. because you were a part of him. God had not separated the bride from the groom yet. So you actually visited Zakius's house. Uh we don't recollect it. We don't we don't remember it happening. But revelation can say I was there. &gt;&gt; All right. By revelation we can say I was there. So at at that point there there was Jesus was the manifestation of the book. All right? He was the book in the home. But now we know because of the actions of that book, the death, burial and resurrection of that book, that act has made it possible for the other parts of the book &gt;&gt; to come forward. &gt;&gt; All right. So we understand that that that book the the Jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily he understood his purpose and he acted according to his understanding. &gt;&gt; Uh he he acted according to the revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. He stood as the lamb of God before Pilate at the judgment hall. He did not try to defend himself. He did not try to escape because he knew who he was. He knew that was his purpose, &gt;&gt; right? So he he had no need to avoid his purpose, but he actually had to battle to remain in his purpose. &gt;&gt; He he never fought to to avoid the purpose, but his fight was to remain as the lamb of God &gt;&gt; because he didn't have to do it. He had a choice &gt;&gt; whether to do it or not to do it. &gt;&gt; But he chose to do it. All right? He chose to stay there. He chose to die for you and I. And I'm speaking in these terms of the book chose because that is that is who he was. He he was the book made flesh. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right now, the reason that we're we're focusing and we're we're saying particular things is because there was a there was a a part of that book in Revelation 5 that was going to also be made flesh. &gt;&gt; The revelation of that book was going to reveal that book made flesh. &gt;&gt; All right? So if the book is on earth today, he's not on earth in the form that he was. &gt;&gt; But he is he is here in a form that he had predestined. He had ordained himself to be in. I think that's beautiful that that God ordained himself to be here in a in another form other than what he was 2,000 years ago. uh not by your will &gt;&gt; that is he here but by his own will. &gt;&gt; It's his own will to be here in a form that he wasn't 2,000 years ago. All right. So if if the book is on earth today, then the book God desires the book to know its purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God desires the book, the book's purpose to be revealed &gt;&gt; to the book &gt;&gt; because this portion of the book &gt;&gt; suffered with spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; The first portion did not. The first manifestation of the book did not suffer with spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; But the second portion of the book suffers with spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; So she needs her purpose to be revealed to her. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's that's where we're we're we're going to be to be heading because we are living in an extremely special time. [clears throat] You know, a lot of people wish they could live in the days of the first manifestation of the word. But we understand that there is another manifestation of the word. &gt;&gt; There there has been prophesied to be another manifestation of the word. And we understand that we are living in the day of the second manifestation of the word. All right? There's a lot more to it than that. We're we're we're more it's it's more than living in a day of the second manifestation of the word. There's a lot more to it. But in this manifestation, he is not restricted to one office. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he is not restricted to the office of lamb. &gt;&gt; He is not restricted to the office of groom because in the form that he comes in in the second manifestation, he comes in a many membered form. Yeah, beautiful &gt;&gt; one body &gt;&gt; but many members of that one body &gt;&gt; right? So the members of that body are actually family &gt;&gt; father, mother, &gt;&gt; husband, wife, son, daughter. Right? So it's God as a masterpiece family &gt;&gt; in this manifestation. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He he w he he was a family in the first &gt;&gt; but not revealed &gt;&gt; because you were in him, &gt;&gt; right? So you you were there. That's why we could say the whole the whole family of God visited Zakius's house. [laughter] You know, um you have no idea. You you don't know what it looks like. We can only go on Google and try and find something that in our mind looks like it, but we really have no idea. But but the family of God was there. &gt;&gt; All right. So God didn't have a family. &gt;&gt; He became a family. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the reason he became a family now is because he was a family. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. because in him was attributes &gt;&gt; that needed to be expressed that he desired to be expressed uh in the second manifestation &gt;&gt; of himself. &gt;&gt; Right? So the family of God is a manifestation of himself. &gt;&gt; All right? And this is why adoption, God doesn't adopt a foreign body into his family. &gt;&gt; All right? Adoption is a place of of maturity for a son of God. &gt;&gt; No one comes to adoption other than the family of God. All right? the no there's there's no other seed that comes to adoption just just um the family the family of God. Amen. So tonight we're going to we're we're going to follow um through with this in in Revelation 5 because Revelation 5 is actually a family scene. Now, I could I I like saying this, but I don't expect you to answer. All right? Let me ask you a question. That That doesn't mean you have to answer out loud. All right? But I I like to ask questions because when I'm asking you, I've already asked myself. All right? Like, &gt;&gt; can can the book be in the home? What what does this scene in Luke 19 look like today? &gt;&gt; Right? Because the book is in the home. &gt;&gt; It it doesn't matter whether we think it is or not. The book is in the home. &gt;&gt; This is this is something that that I don't argue about. The book is in the home. All right. But what what does it look like? In what form does it does it manifest itself and how does it act? All right. So we want to look at this in this in in the context of of Revelation 5 because Revelation 5 is actually a family scene. All right. So we'll we'll get to that soon. Um we could ask the question, you know, we've read we read Revelation 5. There was a um a book in the hand of him that sat upon the throne and no one was found worthy to open the book to read the book nor to look thereon. Um there was there was there was elders on the scene and there was a lamb on the scene. You know what what does Revelation five look like &gt;&gt; today? Because when it to the bride, the opening of the seals was the greatest event &gt;&gt; in the bride's life. &gt;&gt; It transformed her life. It she was going this way and the opening of that seals called her back the total opposite way. It it's it's it's a personal event. &gt;&gt; Um but but can can a heavenly scene &gt;&gt; become a earthly scene? Or now that the seals are open, do we just forget about it? Or or does the scene of Revelation five become a scene in our homes? &gt;&gt; I think it I I think it does. Okay. I believe it does. I believe that this scene is something that when we see the pattern &gt;&gt; of what God has done spiritually, then it becomes something that we see happening naturally. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You remember when God asked Moses to build a tabernacle that he might meet them in there and and and the prophet says how how Moses saw a heavenly vision &gt;&gt; and then that I don't believe he just saw the mechanics, &gt;&gt; but I believe he actually saw the dynamics. &gt;&gt; I believe he actually saw the tabernacle in action. &gt;&gt; Yeah. working, &gt;&gt; right? And when he come down, what that heavenly scene became was an earthly scene, &gt;&gt; right? So, Revelation 5 is no doubt a heavenly scene. But can that scene become a natural scene in our homes &gt;&gt; where the family of God is expressed in Revelation 5 1-7. Um I I I I know I know it can um because it it is in Revelation 5 is in my home. this that scene of Revelation five is actually happening in my home as we speak. And we'll get to that uh uh a a little more into that as as we as we go through. Um, I'm going to skip a couple of things here because, you know, some sometimes you don't know how people are going to respond. Um, but when you hear the response, you're you're saying, "Okay, we can I can leave this out. I can they're with me on this, you know, but some sometimes people aren't as well taught and you've kind of got to build a bit more of a platform uh before before you bring you bring the thought." So, thank you, brother. So, before something can become an earthly scene, it must be a heavenly experience. Before Revelations 5 1-7 can become a scene in our home, it must be something that we experience ourself &gt;&gt; first. Okay. the the example that I had of this and now I'm going back on my word was when when um Jesus uh sorry Peter was walking through gate beautiful and there was that lame man there and the the lame man said to to Peter um you know what what have you g give me something and uh Peter said silverilver and gold have I none but such as I have give I thee &gt;&gt; right so the the the principle here is that we can only give what we have, &gt;&gt; right? We can only give what we have. And and Peter didn't have any um wealth or anything that he could give this man to help this man out. But he had something that God had given him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God had given him revelation. And because God had given him revelation, he could then apply that revelation on a natural level. &gt;&gt; All right? So, so Peter had the experience of receiving revelation. And because he had the experience of receiving revelation, he then was also able to apply the revelation to the people around them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So if we take that scene into Revelation 5, Revelation 5 must be a personal experience to you. And once it's a personal experience to you as a let's let's say from my point of view as a father once revelation 5 is a personal experience to me as a father then I can apply revelation 5 to my home through the experience that God has given me. All right. So, so God leaves some things to our imagination, but but there's some things that he doesn't leave to our imagination, but there's some things that he gives us by revelation, and he wants us to apply those things to our natural home. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, it's a it's it's a wonderful wonderful thing. Um, I'll just skip over the scripture here, but but uh Jesus says uh sorry, brother Brandham says here, Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have. Give me that and take all your money. Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ." That's what he had. Revelation of it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk. All right. So, so Peter had the revelation of the power within the name. &gt;&gt; And because he had the revelation of the power within the name, he he he was able to apply it to someone who was in need of that revelation. So God doesn't give us revelation just for ourselves. But God has a purpose in giving us revelation. &gt;&gt; All right. Um, you know, sometimes sometimes I think we're in too much of a hurry to change dimensions. It's like we want to become untouchable, but God wants to become tangible. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You know, we're in a hurry to get there. We're in a hurry to go up and he's coming down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You You understand what I mean? Sometimes we can be in such a hurry to to change dimensions &gt;&gt; that we can miss what God's desires are because God's desires are actually to become tangible in this dimension. &gt;&gt; He he his desire is to become flesh in your flesh. which means to do that you've got to wait a little while. All right? So, we're in a hurry to go up and he's coming down. It's like we pass him on the way up, you know. [laughter] But if we can understand what God desires, God's desire is to be a family. &gt;&gt; God's desire is to be flesh &gt;&gt; in every member of his predestinated body. &gt;&gt; All right. So, um I just want to I I think I touched on this maybe with the youth last time. Um but I just want to just uh remind you of it again. Um if the Holy Ghost is in a father, how's the father going to act? or sorry, how's the Holy Ghost going to act? &gt;&gt; I got a little picture here. If the Holy Ghost is in a mother, how's the Holy Ghost going to act? If the Holy Ghost is in a son or in a daughter, this is the this is the family of God. If God is in his family, then how is God going to act? Because this is where he is. &gt;&gt; I know that you know that. But how does the Holy Ghost act in a husband? How does the Holy Ghost act in a father? How does the Holy Ghost act in a wife? How does the Holy Ghost act in a mother? How does the Holy Ghost act in a son? How does the Holy Ghost act in a daughter? God's God is not restricted by many things, [snorts] but he is restricted. He's restricted by the mask &gt;&gt; that he's in. Yes. &gt;&gt; God in me as a father is restricted by the mask &gt;&gt; that he's operating from. &gt;&gt; It would be the same if you went to a school play. There's characters in that play. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's say you you you were playing you you went and saw a um uh a play at um at the beginning of the book of Joshua where Moses uh was commissioning uh Joshua and Caleb and you had a a Moses, you had a Joshua and you had a Caleb. The person in the mask mask of Moses &gt;&gt; is restricted to his mask. That's right. &gt;&gt; He cannot play the part of Joshua. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the mask of Moses, &gt;&gt; right? And it's the same with a father and a mother or a husband and a wife. God in the husband is restricted by who he is dwelling in. &gt;&gt; God in a husband is not going to act like a wife. That would be a perversion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what this world is, &gt;&gt; perverted. &gt;&gt; If you work in people's homes, you know, I've worked in many people's homes, worldly people's homes. You you go into a home and you have two married men. &gt;&gt; They're married together as husband and wife. And one of them is acting like a woman. He's speaking like a woman. That is a perversion. &gt;&gt; It is a wrong spirit in a wrong body. &gt;&gt; Right? So God in a woman, God in a wife does not mean that she is now the head of the home. &gt;&gt; Because the husband is the head of the home, &gt;&gt; right? The wife can never be the head of the home if there's a husband in the home. &gt;&gt; Why? So God God in the wife is going to act like a wife. &gt;&gt; God in the husband is going to act like a husband. God in a son is going to act like a son. God in a daughter is going to act like a daughter. And the reason I'm saying this is because this is actually the scene we will see in Revelation 5 that each one of these characters are in Revelation 5. So God desires to be a family, but God does not desire to be a perverted family. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh this this is something my my wife and I have have uh been learning about because we're we now have five grandchildren and we we realize that the children are the parents responsibility. Right. The the children the the my my children have children. I am my children's parents. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Father, right? And the the commission to the parents is to teach your children. &gt;&gt; I have a question for you. When do your children not become your children? cuz I still look at my 29year-old son as my child &gt;&gt; because that is what he is though he be an adult he is my child &gt;&gt; right so so if if God in the wife God as in my wife my my children's mother God in her acts as a mother to to her children. But now we have a daughter who has children. So how is my daughter as a mother, how is God in her going to act? Because she is the mother to her children. &gt;&gt; We are the parents to our children. They are the parents to their children. It's not our duty to teach their kids. It's our duty to teach our kids, &gt;&gt; right? Because each one of our children has a purpose in our life. &gt;&gt; And if I become the parent of a child that's not mine, then I am taking the place of someone else. Because your children have a purpose. &gt;&gt; They have a purpose. They have a way of molding you that nothing else does. [laughter] All right? They have a a way of bringing out the good in you that nothing else does. They have a way of bringing out the bad in you that nothing else does. All right? They they they they have a purpose. So God, my my purpose to my children is to teach my children how to bring up their children so that they can bring up their children. &gt;&gt; When my children got married, it doesn't mean they were no longer my responsibility. But if the opportunity arises and they need a little instruction, then that is what we are there for. Sometimes we just let him figure things out and that's just the way it has to be sometimes. All right. So God is restricted by the mask that he embodies. &gt;&gt; Remember God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; So that was God in the form of a groom. It was the it it was God, but he was restricted to that mask. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But now he's not restricted to a mask &gt;&gt; because now there are masks &gt;&gt; that he has embodied himself in. There are offices that he has now taken as a result of the word becoming flesh. All right. So if we look at this uh picture here and don't don't don't look too much. Oh, there's six seal there's seven seals of shammy. Just don't just don't go there. All right. Just don't don't get caught up in the details that aren't too important at this stage. All right. If we were to to describe this scene, what would be one word that we could describe it with? The word that came to my mind was relationship. Revelation 5 is all about relationship. &gt;&gt; There's a relationship between the book and the hand that holds it. There's a relationship between the book and the hand that's coming to take it. There's a relationship between the hand and the hand that holds the book and the hand that's coming to take the book. This whole scene is relationship. &gt;&gt; What what what is one word that describes family? &gt;&gt; Relationship. &gt;&gt; You can't be a part of a family and it not you not have relationship. &gt;&gt; All right. So this is a uh a wonderful thing here that that we are we are looking at here. Revelation 5 is all about relationship. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, as I've said that the lamb who is coming to take the book has a relationship with the book. It doesn't matter what you want to connect with. What does this have a point? I think it does. It doesn't matter whether you want to if you connect that the hand with the book, there's a relationship. This hand with the book, there's a relationship. this hand with this hand there's a relationship. It doesn't matter which way you want to put it. &gt;&gt; There's a relationship. All all these three here which are really four, but we'll get to that. But all these three are are connected have a relationship with one another. &gt;&gt; Okay? So we could go back oh back to to this one and see the same thing. This is all about relationship. &gt;&gt; All right? You You can't be one of these and not be in a relationship, right? And you can't be one of these and not be in a relationship. If you if you are one of these, you are in a relationship. And this is what I believe that God wants us to to to see is where where am I? Where am I in this in this scene? Right? Because remember the the book in Luke 4 took the book and turned to where it was revealed where where it was written of him and he said, "This day this scripture is revealed." So if that's what the groom did, won't the bride be able to pick up the same book? &gt;&gt; Right. And turn to a page where it is written of her and saying, "This is me spiritually. this is where I am. But also naturally, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; naturally, I want my son to be able to pick up this book and be able to turn to the to Revelation 5 and see himself in this scene. I want my daughter to be able to do the same thing. I want every husband and every every wife to be able to do the same thing, to be able to turn to the same uh scripture and see themselves there. And this is an incredible thing because this is just one account, one place, Revelation 51-7. In that in that one scripture, the whole family of God can turn there and see themselves in that that those seven scriptures. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I think that's magnificent. &gt;&gt; Magnificent. &gt;&gt; So, just to enter into a little bit um on this on this uh scene that we have here, the focus of the lamb, oh, sorry. The focus of the lamb is the book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. The focus of the book is the lamb. &gt;&gt; We understand in this day that the lamb has taken possession of the book and revealed the book. The question is who is the book? Who was the book revealed to? &gt;&gt; In Genesis 24, we touched on this this morning at the men's meeting, but in Genesis 24, the story of Eleazar, when he when he prayed, what was he praying for? He was praying for the mystery of Isaac. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To be revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not He wasn't just praying for her. &gt;&gt; Because Elea had a purpose. And that was to go and fetch call out a bride for Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So when Isaac prayed, what he was praying for was for the mystery of Isaac to be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you say, well, that's that's that's a good thing for Isaac to do. You know, that's that's very that's very um honorable for Isaac to pray. But uh Eleaza to pray, but Eleazar prayed specifically &gt;&gt; because he didn't want to make the choice. &gt;&gt; But he wanted God to reveal the choice. You remember when the prophet was about to bring forth the seals and he said, "Oh," he said, "I would have made a great mistake, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for the angel coming down &gt;&gt; and revealing the mysteries to me, &gt;&gt; Eleazar didn't want to make a mistake. Elea knew that there was there were many fine ladies that looked fine by the eye. They perhaps were there were many virgins that that went out to to the well, but but he didn't want to make a carnal choice. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to make a natural choice. He wanted God to reveal Isaac's other part. &gt;&gt; All right? Which could not be known just by looking upon. Yes, &gt;&gt; it had to she had to be revealed. &gt;&gt; It wasn't enough to go through the internet and look at look at um um uh what do you call those things? You know, your your your what's that statuses? &gt;&gt; It wasn't enough to get a reference &gt;&gt; from her dad or from her pastor. It required a revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. It required a revelation. So he prayed for the mystery of Isaac to be revealed. All right. So in this scene, who's the mystery in the scene of Eleaza? Who's the mystery? That's right. &gt;&gt; Because she came forward. She was now visible but a mystery to herself. Eza knew who she was, but she had no clue who she was. &gt;&gt; So, she was a mystery, but now she was a mystery revealed to Elea, but she wasn't revealed to herself. &gt;&gt; Right? The the mysteries God does nothing but that he first reveals the mysteries to his prophets first. &gt;&gt; Amen. First, not only I say that all the time, first. Yes. &gt;&gt; Secondly, he reveals the mystery to the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's the message that reveals the mystery &gt;&gt; that God revealed to the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so Rebecca knew nothing about who she was. She knew nothing about that. She was a part of Isaac. I think this is beautiful. &gt;&gt; Going off the youth meeting last night, you know, like what what did she have to do to become Isaac's bride. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; She was Isaac's bride before she knew Isaac was looking for a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's not what we do. and what we don't do. It's who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We say, "Yeah, that's true, Brother Dan." But she had to say, "I will go." &gt;&gt; She did. But that that I will go didn't make her bride. The reason she said I will go is because she was bride. &gt;&gt; She couldn't say anything else. [applause] &gt;&gt; So true. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, who's the mystery in Revelation five? &gt;&gt; It's the book &gt;&gt; that is sealed. &gt;&gt; It's the book he died for. &gt;&gt; It's the book he came to redeem. &gt;&gt; It's the book that he is to reveal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh do you think that we should call it uh say like what is the book or who is the book? Is the book a book or is the book a person? &gt;&gt; Because in in Luke chapter 4, the book was revealed as more than a book, [laughter] right? They were waiting for the book to become flesh, but the book had been flesh for 31 years, &gt;&gt; right? And they not known it. But and then the book takes the book and reveals himself as the book and they still didn't know he was the book. &gt;&gt; This is why this type of thing once once God shows you who you are and you can pick up the book and identify yourself as the book, it doesn't matter what anyone else says. You don't get offended if people don't see what you see. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't get offended that after he did what he did this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ear. They all looked at him and wi with with with stern eyes and with focused eyes and said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?" &gt;&gt; But that didn't bother him. And nor will it bother us when we fully understand who we are. When our identity is made clear to us, it won't matter what family thinks. It won't matter what the Pope thinks. It won't matter what anyone else thinks. &gt;&gt; True. It won't even matter what your own memory thinks &gt;&gt; because faith is greater than all other forms of communication within your body. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Do you always feel like bride? &gt;&gt; Well, if you're anything like me, you won't. You probably you're probably on the other side where you feel less like bride. You spend more time feeling less like the bride than what you do when you do feel like the bride. But but but your feelings are a form of communication. The senses of your body and your spirit are a form of communication. True. But once you have the revelation of who you are, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter what every other form of communication wants to tell you. That faith form of communication rises up above every other form and says, "Look, you're right. I don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; But just because I don't feel like it doesn't mean I'm not it." When Jesus took the book, let me ask you this. How did he take it? Had he had a good day, you know, did he feel like the lamb of God? &gt;&gt; The prophet said he contended with himself. &gt;&gt; So, let's let's look at this. So, let's look at um who the hand is on the on the lower left side there coming to take the book. Um we can just jump down if you like to to verse to verse six. And I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain. All right. So we we understand we we know these things. Um this the the hand on this. So this is this is diff opposite to my one at home. The bottom button is forward. This one up is back. But this one is the other way around. So the the the lamb of God here. This is this hand is the lamb of God. And I I kind of wish that it um had some scars on it &gt;&gt; because the scripture says as it had been slain. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so the picture is never right. It's ne it's never right because it the word requires revelation. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're not looking for a perfect picture. We're looking for perfect revelation. &gt;&gt; All right. and your your the revelation that you have of the word can add to the picture &gt;&gt; and make the picture perfect. &gt;&gt; All right. So, um this this lamb here is the same lamb that John revealed and I saw and bear record that this is the son of God. Again the next day after John stood and the and two of his disciples looking upon Jesus as he walked he said behold the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; So the lamb of God is the son of God. Right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; All right. The lamb of God is the son of God. &gt;&gt; All right. the in in John 1 here, this was the lamb before he was slain. In Revelation five, it is the lamb after he had been slain. All right? So, these these two here in John 1 and Revelation 5, they're they're not they're not different people. They're the same people, but one was before he was slain and one was after he was slain. All right? So the the lamb that was the lamb the hand in the bottom left corner there we can identify that as by the word as being the son of god &gt;&gt; the lamb the groom of the bride the her it's the he's the redeemer he's the word all right so now let's let's move forward and look at the hand that is um holding holding the the book. And he came, this is this is um Revelation 5:7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. All right. So who whose hand is this? Because this hand has abilities. It has strengths. &gt;&gt; It has keeping power. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm just going to give you one quotation um for for this uh here in the fourth seal. No one could open the book. No one understood it. It was a book of redemption. And God the father spirit had it in his hand because Christ was on was at the throne of meteor the only mediator. &gt;&gt; All right. So we see here that this brings uh into into very clear view of who that hand was. So we see the lamb as the son, we see the hand as the father, &gt;&gt; right? So um no no surprise here but the mystery in this scene is the book. The word tells us who the the the hand whose hand it is coming to take the book. The word tells us whose hand is holding the book. &gt;&gt; But the book is the mystery. &gt;&gt; All right? The groom is not the mystery. The one holding the book is not the mystery. &gt;&gt; The book itself &gt;&gt; is a mystery that has not yet been revealed. &gt;&gt; All right. So remember, I say remember, I haven't mentioned it, but Genesis 2, Adam, we know, God, we know. But who is this? &gt;&gt; That's in my words. It's not scripture. &gt;&gt; All right. It's reading in between the lines. &gt;&gt; Adam, we know. God, we know. But who is this? &gt;&gt; Two parts of the picture we know. One we don't. &gt;&gt; How? By the word. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says that God laid Adam to sleep, &gt;&gt; a deep sleep, and took a part out of Adam. Right? So, we know who Adam is. We know who God is because it says in Genesis 2:22 that God bought the woman to the man, &gt;&gt; but it was the woman &gt;&gt; that was sealed. &gt;&gt; It was Rebecca who was sealed. &gt;&gt; It's the book that is sealed. &gt;&gt; So what is the book or who is the book? The mystery in Genesis 2 was a part of Adam. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remembering that Genesis is the seed chapter. &gt;&gt; Revelation is the harvest chapter. What happened happens in Genesis comes to fullness in Revelation &gt;&gt; because you don't harvest an immature crop. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we have the beginning of the book, we have the end of the book. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the question we could ask here was why was the book so important to the lamb? Why did his I'll just say it like this. His love for the book caused him to lay himself down. I mean, it must have been some book. field. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Now you see the seals when he was in his meteoral work back there redeeming, &gt;&gt; but someday he comes forth to get this book." &gt;&gt; That he's redeemed. &gt;&gt; You see, there's the experience. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's the experience that God wants you to have. &gt;&gt; He want God desires to come back &gt;&gt; and break the seals &gt;&gt; from your life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But he can't break the seals until he takes possession. &gt;&gt; He the seal [screaming] cannot be broken. This is all in the message. Listen to the breach. It's fabulous. &gt;&gt; The seal cannot be broken &gt;&gt; until the groom, the lamb takes the book takes possession of the book. Once he has taken possession of the book, then he has a right &gt;&gt; to break that seal. &gt;&gt; He has no right &gt;&gt; until he has taken possession of the book. &gt;&gt; And this is why we are living in the day of the manifest the second manifestation of Christ. But God has come &gt;&gt; and taken possession of the book. &gt;&gt; He's taken possession of me. &gt;&gt; And as a result of him taking possession of me, he has a right &gt;&gt; to break the seal of my life and reveal me to me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I tell you brother and sister, once you, as we say, once you see it, you can't see it. &gt;&gt; But let me say this, once you've experienced, you can't unexperience it. &gt;&gt; Once you've experienced it, it becomes alive. &gt;&gt; Once you've experienced it, it becomes alive in your home. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where I believe God wants it. Yes. &gt;&gt; I believe God wants Revelation 5 to be a manifestation in our home. I believe that's why he did it to us personally. I believe that's why he gave Peter the revelation of his name so he could pass on that revelation so he could apply it to people in need. &gt;&gt; And our children are in need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our children need parents with experience of God. &gt;&gt; You know, we can Yeah. Praise the Lord. This goes on. This same quote goes on. All right. I got dot dot dot because it continues on. And all that's in the book would be him &gt;&gt; for that's &gt;&gt; the believer. The words in the book &gt;&gt; and the word is him [snorts] &gt;&gt; and all that's in that. &gt;&gt; He came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb. So, you are a part of this book. &gt;&gt; And we're looking at it a bit more personal than that to say that you are the book &gt;&gt; because you are the book. &gt;&gt; You absolutely are the book. But but but who is the book? &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; All that's in the book would be him. Can I ask you this? Remember what I said? All right. When God When God bought Adam's wife to Adam, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What did he bring him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He bought him him. [laughter] He bought Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam. &gt;&gt; This is why you can identify yourself by revelation with Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Can I put that in another way? Let's go back to Eleaza and let's put it in a natural speech. What could we say about Rebecca? Because Rebecca was Isaac, &gt;&gt; yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; and forever. [applause] &gt;&gt; You mean like 24 hours? Yes. No, I mean eternity, &gt;&gt; time, eternity. &gt;&gt; She didn't become &gt;&gt; Isaac's bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. She was &gt;&gt; Isaac's bride &gt;&gt; always before she was conceived, before she became the the little baby um that her her mother gave suck to before in eternity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, what can we say? I'll put it another way. What can you say about you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you know what I believe Isaac wanted Rebecca to do? He wanted her to say what he was saying by revelation, not as a parrot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe God wants you by revelation &gt;&gt; to be able to say the same thing &gt;&gt; that he has already said by revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's going to come a time where these tapes, these messages that we love are not going to be available. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be able to search it up and look up she is him. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Do you know when that's going to happen? When you're ready. &gt;&gt; And what I mean by ready? When God has made you ready. When God has revealed his word to you, he'll put a boycott on all message material. &gt;&gt; When that happens, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that's a sign that you're in a place of maturity where you don't you don't need his voice &gt;&gt; because his voice is in you. &gt;&gt; You by revelation can say what's on the tapes without researching it. That's good. &gt;&gt; That's that's really good. So So God God wants you to be able to say &gt;&gt; I I am him. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we feel like, well, I don't I don't know if we should re really say that, you know. No. [clears throat] God wants you to say it. &gt;&gt; That I am a part of Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; I've always been a part of him. I will [screaming] always be a part of him. There's nothing I can do to make me not a part. There's nothing I can do to make me be a part. I've always been a part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. My see see how we need him. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we really do. We really do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So So who is the book? It's him. &gt;&gt; Well, by then if it's him, that means it's not me because I'm a her, &gt;&gt; right? But that's not correct, is it? &gt;&gt; Right. Because she is him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So the the revelation of the book is that it's him. &gt;&gt; But it's her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or we could say it's him in a her form. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Right. God um a prophet of God will say that when God uh separated the woman from the man in Genesis 2, he took out the feminine spirit &gt;&gt; and placed it in the woman, &gt;&gt; right? So that that woman was him, but it was actually her. It was him in a female form. right now that Adam's bride was sealed. &gt;&gt; She was sealed to herself. &gt;&gt; She didn't have an any idea of who she was. &gt;&gt; She had to rely upon someone who knew her. &gt;&gt; She was sealed. Rebecca was sealed. &gt;&gt; She had no clue who she was even though she was. which shows us that you can only have the revelation of Jesus Christ if you're a part of Jesus Christ. It shows us that receiving the revelation of Jesus Christ doesn't make you Jesus a part of Jesus Christ. But because you are a part of Jesus Christ, you can receive the revelation of Jesus Christ because that is what the new birth is. And the dude birth doesn't make you seed. But because you are seed, you can be reborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. So Eza, sorry, Isaac's bride was a mystery to herself. She was sealed. This book is sealed. &gt;&gt; In a in a in a natural man and woman, who is sealed? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Naturally. That's right. &gt;&gt; The the woman comes sealed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The man doesn't. &gt;&gt; The woman does. &gt;&gt; Why? Why would God do that? &gt;&gt; Maybe because he wanted Revelation 5 to become down into a home level. &gt;&gt; Maybe So, we can see everyone here. We can see um not on this one, the bride, the father, and the son. We can put the bride as daughter because my daughters are sealed. &gt;&gt; I am their father and they're waiting for their lamb. &gt;&gt; Who is a son? See, this does away with samesex marriages. Just like that. &gt;&gt; Just gone. &gt;&gt; The the lamb. I've got a big stop sign. Look. [laughter] I think I've even got it on here. No. Here. Look. [laughter] You ought to be proud of me, Don. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Now we said there was four remember mom, dad, son, daughter. All right in that in in this in this scene we have three. All right. But how we are applying this, how we will apply this over the next couple of services is that the hand that holds the book &gt;&gt; is the hand of the parents. Because it's not the father alone that sits on the throne, &gt;&gt; but it is the the the mother and the father sitting on the throne need meeting the needs of the home &gt;&gt; together. &gt;&gt; All right. It is the relationship between the parents and the book, right? So, remember how we said it's all about relationship. There's a relationship between the parents and their daughter. There's a relationship between the parents and the son, the young man who is coming forward to take the book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a relationship between the the the the lamb and the book. There's a relationship between the lamb and the parents &gt;&gt; of the book &gt;&gt; because the book must be released. &gt;&gt; Not not taken, &gt;&gt; not stolen. &gt;&gt; The book must be released. &gt;&gt; So in and in order for the book to be released, the parents are not going to give their daughter to anyone. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Because in Revelation five, &gt;&gt; the book was kept &gt;&gt; in the hand of him that sat upon the throne. &gt;&gt; We'll get into this tomorrow. I'm just using up my time. It it it was it was guarded. It was protected. &gt;&gt; There was a relationship between the hand and the book. Because the hand was not going to give the book to anyone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. The the hand had to release the book, &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but it sounds a little bit like a wedding scene. So there's just relationship. There's this relationship, relationship, relationship. And this is this is what I believe what God wants is for Revelation 5 &gt;&gt; to become manifested in the home. &gt;&gt; And if I understand who I am &gt;&gt; as a part of the book, then I can act. I can do according to the revelation of who I am. &gt;&gt; The same as the the the the lamb of God 2,000 years ago knew who he was and he was able to act according to the revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; Now that that God makes that possible in each one of our lives. It is in each one of our lives that God wants to be manifested in. God wants to be expressed in. That's why I ask you, if God is in the parents, how is God going to act? &gt;&gt; If God is in the daughter, how is the daughter going to act? If God is in the son, the boy, the male, the man, how is he going to act? One of the greatest questions that I have um with young people is how do we know if this how do I know as a as a lady as a man if this lady that I'm um interested in has the Holy Ghost. And from a lady's perspective, how do I, as a young lady, know whether this young man has the Holy Ghost or not? &gt;&gt; Because, you know, I'm I'm not I'm not old, but I'm old enough. And I have seen some things that you wonder how how could it end this way? How can people who claim to have the Holy Ghost end up shacking up with some other woman while they're married to their first wife and have children by it? &gt;&gt; You know, the these these we we shouldn't fear it, but God is raising the standard that we live to. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the opening of the word. And look in in my life, I am not interested in how I lived 10 years ago. &gt;&gt; I am not interested in how I thought 10 years ago. How what I am interested in now is living to the level of revelation that God has revealed to me personally and applying that revelation in the office that I hold as pastor etc. um uh uh father, all these things. Um God God expects us to apply his word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Dan, you're a legalist. You mean applying the word is being a legalist? You mean doing? If I'm a legalist, God is. &gt;&gt; Because I I I am not doing anything that he didn't do. Let me ask you this. What is legalism? &gt;&gt; Because often times we put things in the legalistic basket. It's not legalistic. &gt;&gt; You know, just just because my boundaries are a little bit tighter than Brother Adrian's boundaries doesn't make me a legalist. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because God deals with me as a sovereign father. &gt;&gt; God deals with me, right, with the understanding that he has of my children's weaknesses. &gt;&gt; It's like people say, "Well, you take your kids 10pin bowling, you know, and we do." So, and and then I I they say, "Well, we don't go 10pin bowling, so I Well, you're a legalist. Now, hang on a minute. Maybe their ch there's an influence in that place that their children that could affect their children but not yours. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they might take their kids ice skating and you don't and you you that then you call they call you a legalist. But maybe there's something in that arena. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That that may affect my children. So God deals with me personally. to meet the needs of my children. So just because my boundaries are a little bit tighter than Billy Joe's doesn't make me a legalist. How do you know it's not God &gt;&gt; protecting my children? &gt;&gt; Legalism is your approach to salvation. If you think that you can do something to help save your children, &gt;&gt; you're wrong. &gt;&gt; Because your children are under the same covenant you are. &gt;&gt; And if you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, your children are Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. So the same covenant that applies to you applies to your children. So my children aren't saved because I was a good parent. &gt;&gt; My children aren't unsaved because I'm a bad parent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My children are who they are because of who they are before the foundation of the world. The same reason I am. So, I'm going to call this the end and we'll continue with this uh tomorrow um in in two services. It's it's it's just such a tremendous tremendous topic &gt;&gt; and [clears throat] uh some of the the things that the the responses that I have um from young sisters and young brothers a and and older ones um say man you know the older ones say man you know I wish I I knew that when I was that age &gt;&gt; you know but you know what your responsibility is now is to teach your children the ways of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then you know the young the young sisters the same, the young brothers the the same. You know when you can see yourself in the word &gt;&gt; it makes all the difference. &gt;&gt; When when a sister can see herself in the word and see how he is supposed to act. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She won't fall for anything less. You understand? &gt;&gt; And it's the it's the same if a man is looking for a woman and he knows how he is supposed to act and he knows how she is supposed to act. He won't he won't he won't yoke himself with anything less. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now you can call me a legalist. All right. But courtship is a form of yoking. &gt;&gt; I wish you didn't say that. I wish I didn't have to. But it's the truth that God does not want you to join yourself with something that you are not meant to be joined with. &gt;&gt; Sorry to leave you with that, brother Elray, &gt;&gt; but that's where I'm going to leave it because the slide said stop. Amen. God bless you, brother. If you'd like to come, God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; That's so good. Praise the Lord. Trust we got got the picture. Um, as as brother Daniel was was speaking, it was just so beautiful to see that if you if you look at it from that perspective, 2,000 years ago, there was a part of the book revealed. &gt;&gt; And in our day in Revelation 5, the revealed part was there, but he was hidden. And it didn't come on the scene until the call was made &gt;&gt; because there was another part of that same book that had to be revealed. And then when the call came came forward for for the female part for the bride part of that book to be revealed then the one the part that had already been revealed the lamb part came forward and revealed the other part which is exactly what happened in the garden of Eden where God brought Eve to Adam and Adam could say this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh and by him saying that Eve got the revelation of who she was and he was revealing to Eve that she was him and so beautiful. Just all all these things coming together. It's just so lovely. Trust that we uh that we could absorb everything and and if if you couldn't if there was too much information, well, go back and listen to it again. I highly recommend it. Make sure you get a good night's rest tonight to come with [music] cups held held high and ready for the Lord to to feed us more. Amen. Let's just stand together. I'm going to I'm going to just pray and then I'm going to hand over to Simon um and then we can sing that song. Most wonderful and loving heavenly father. Oh Lord, I want to thank you for the word that we receive [music] tonight. Lord, I just Oh Lord, we have done nothing to deserve being the book, Lord Jesus.

And we are so thankful, Lord, that you revealing it to us and making it more and more real, Father. Lord, and the more we know who we are, the more we can just let your word through us be the expression in the mask that you called us, Lord. Thank you, Lord. We commit the rest of the weekend to you and pray that you will just have [music] your way. God, I pray for brother Daniel.
