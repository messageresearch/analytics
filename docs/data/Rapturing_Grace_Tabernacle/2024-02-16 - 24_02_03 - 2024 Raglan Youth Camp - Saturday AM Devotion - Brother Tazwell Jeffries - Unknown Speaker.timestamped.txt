[0:05] Give the Lord a hand of
[0:09] Praise now you see that that's your
[0:12] confession for this weekend because we
[0:16] know we are in a spiritual war and the
[0:20] devil wants you but God wants you and
[0:24] over this weekend and going forward God
[0:27] is going to win because you are on the
[0:30] winning sight so let's just pray quickly
[0:32] and then we'll go into this little
[0:34] devotion Lord Jesus we so thankful to be
[0:37] with this beautiful young people we pray
[0:40] oh God for this little devotion that you
[0:42] would just lead us this morning and help
[0:44] us oh God as we'll plant Little Seeds oh
[0:47] God lord into into our young people and
[0:49] even into us as adults Lord and we just
[0:52] want to commit all things into your
[0:54] hands in jesus' name amen you may be
[0:57] seated this
[0:58] morning um
[1:01] so uh I've just got a little I've got a
[1:04] little little
[1:05] thought uh which the Lord laid on my
[1:08] heart and I'm going to try to be as
[1:09] brief as I can and I actually came with
[1:12] some slides I don't always use slides
[1:15] but I thought maybe this time around
[1:16] I'll try to use some slides and some
[1:19] pictures and we'll see how the Lord
[1:20] leads right but I youan know as I look
[1:22] at you and I was this morning as I was
[1:24] waking up and realizing that I'm going
[1:28] to be speaking to these beautiful young
[1:30] people and I actually thought to myself
[1:33] my how how privileged I am Judah you
[1:36] know just to you know you guys are just
[1:39] simply awesome I'm I'm I'm so uh blessed
[1:45] to be associated with
[1:48] you and I want you to know that you know
[1:50] and and you know you know how it is I I
[1:52] know that you know there are people even
[1:54] amongst the young people that that can
[1:57] can look at somebody and can see whether
[1:59] they they telling the truth or whether
[2:02] they're being a fake so I'm hoping as
[2:04] you looking at me you can see I'm
[2:07] telling the truth and I love you guys
[2:11] man you're just so simply awesome
[2:13] there's there's greatness within you
[2:16] there's so much potential within you and
[2:18] you know like like the the the theme
[2:20] says we are in this together and I know
[2:23] you know as as young people the brothers
[2:25] and the sisters you are there to help
[2:28] each other and support each other so God
[2:30] bless you um brother um Joseph if you
[2:35] could just put on that slide so my my my
[2:37] this is my my opening scripture right so
[2:40] the Bible says uh in Jeremiah 17:9 it
[2:44] says the heart is deceitful above all
[2:48] things and desperately wicked who can
[2:51] know it so when I looked at that word
[2:53] Wicked it doesn't really mean evil it
[2:55] just means uh the heart is weak and you
[2:59] can go have a look in the in the in the
[3:00] in the Lexicon he says I the Lord search
[3:04] the heart I try the reins so the Lord
[3:08] comes and he examines our hearts and I
[3:12] want to encourage you as we're going to
[3:13] go through this this little quickly
[3:15] through the slides um you know just just
[3:18] um listen to what is being said and
[3:21] you're going to hear my voice right but
[3:23] but listen to the voice behind my voice
[3:25] because I believe it's God that loves
[3:28] you I mean I brother T said he loves you
[3:31] right but God loves you so much that
[3:34] brother you know he led on the heart of
[3:36] brother Al to do this and it's for you
[3:39] but it's not only for you it's for me
[3:41] also cuz I'm also here to receive from
[3:44] God Amen so I I've titled this the
[3:49] healing of your heart and I believe you
[3:53] know many many of us and some of us
[3:55] might look at and say ah I don't I don't
[3:56] need healing in the heart but really
[3:59] when we dig deep there are things that
[4:01] we we need the Lord to come and just to
[4:05] to come and and and and and strengthen
[4:07] within us so I I spoke about the heart
[4:10] and I'm going see if this works now yeah
[4:13] so so if you go and and I like I like to
[4:15] do this um if you go back sort of into
[4:17] the the back meanings like the Hebrew
[4:19] lexicon and then the Greek you you
[4:22] discover really what the words in the
[4:23] Bible is sort of referring to so now
[4:26] when when you look at the heart the
[4:28] Bible speaks about the heart of man and
[4:31] I always struggle when the Bible says
[4:33] you know as a man thinketh in his heart
[4:36] and I could never understand that
[4:37] because I thought you I'm thinking
[4:38] you're in my mind but anyway so I
[4:41] discovered you know when when when you
[4:42] go and you look at these things when
[4:44] when the Bible speaks about the heart of
[4:46] man it it refers to you as as a as a
[4:50] living being it it it it speaks about
[4:52] your your desires that you have it it
[4:55] speaks about the passions that you have
[4:58] and Passions is um you know sometimes
[5:02] it's emotions that you cannot
[5:04] control um it speaks about the inner
[5:06] being of man it says there the seat of
[5:10] the appetite so the appetites that you
[5:13] have right and as you can see whe the
[5:15] Taz is struggling because he has some
[5:18] natural appetites um especially when I
[5:21] was in South Africa right I just I just
[5:23] I just come from South Africa and man I
[5:25] enjoyed the South African food with the
[5:27] Michael I realized what I miss
[5:30] so I picked up quite a lot and and I
[5:31] realized you know I got to deal with my
[5:33] appetite but that's my physical appetite
[5:36] so here it talks about you know the
[5:38] heart is the seat of the appetite now we
[5:40] can also have appetites for you know for
[5:42] things out there you know and and and
[5:44] you you as you you know listening to me
[5:46] you can know what what are the things
[5:48] that you desire and you have an appetite
[5:51] for you know like I mean in my home I
[5:54] know that my kids have an appetite and
[5:56] we and we're dealing with that they got
[5:57] an appetite for gaming you know so fortn
[6:00] night and all those kind of things um so
[6:03] you know and also the heart is you know
[6:05] the seat where where where your emotions
[6:07] and your passions come from you know so
[6:10] just uh I thought I wanted to just drop
[6:11] that when we're speaking about the heart
[6:13] of man when the Bible speaks about the
[6:16] heart of man right and then in in the
[6:18] Greek and and and this is again in the
[6:20] New Testament again the Greek looked at
[6:23] it as that physical boom boom boom that
[6:27] we have right a physical heart
[6:30] um but also it says again they talk
[6:33] about you know that's where your
[6:34] thoughts and and the passions and your
[6:36] desires and your appetites come from and
[6:39] and and the affections and and you know
[6:41] the innermost part of you and that is
[6:43] why you know the this message that has
[6:46] come our way it's a message to the heart
[6:50] it's a message that's
[6:53] transforming the heart so anyway I
[6:56] thought I'll just drop that in and all
[6:58] of the stuff is available right
[7:00] so I've got two hearts there and we're
[7:03] going to we're going to chat a bit more
[7:05] about that but so on on the left hand
[7:07] side I've got the grayish heart on the
[7:09] right hand side I've got the white
[7:11] heart and whatever is in the heart we
[7:16] see it manifested in the desires that we
[7:21] have right so so the desire that I have
[7:24] for certain things it's coming from
[7:26] within right um you know passions the
[7:30] appeti so so on the left uh the gray
[7:33] heart there are certain grayish kind of
[7:35] desires and things that comes up right
[7:38] and and on the right it's nice white and
[7:41] pure stuff that that that just comes and
[7:43] radiates out of us as
[7:45] individuals now brother brandom says man
[7:49] always trying to achieve something by
[7:52] his
[7:54] head now he says he's supposed to
[7:57] achieve now I look at you young people
[8:00] you at in your Prime of life and I want
[8:03] to encourage you be
[8:06] Achievers you know you know at least
[8:09] when I grew up in the in the message
[8:11] Community we were told you know at least
[8:13] our parents were told you mustn't study
[8:15] and you mustn't you mustn't better
[8:17] yourself but I believe that you know God
[8:20] wants us to achieve and and and you the
[8:23] BAM says we are supposed to achieve and
[8:27] then he says but our achievement he says
[8:29] is by the
[8:31] heart um and he says that's the control
[8:34] tower where God controls you and me
[8:38] right so God he directs our thoughts
[8:41] directs our walk and directs our
[8:44] emotions but we need to submit that to
[8:48] him we need to surrender that to him
[8:52] right so I'll just go on here then
[8:55] brother bandam goes he says with our
[8:56] heads bowed how many will lay your heart
[9:01] upon the altar so we know an altar and
[9:05] I'll just I've got a slide there an
[9:06] altar is something where sacrifice was
[9:10] made unto God so he says how many of us
[9:15] will lay our hearts our everything our
[9:18] desires our passions our emotions just
[9:22] lay it before God right and make it a
[9:26] feel to God that he might swow his
[9:29] word um upon the altar of our hearts now
[9:34] over this weekend we're going to hear
[9:36] Ministry we're going to hear God
[9:39] speaking to us and it's important that
[9:42] as we sit here right and I know we might
[9:46] get distracted by the beautiful scenery
[9:48] out there and they might the AL might
[9:50] end up closing the curtains if he sees
[9:52] we distracted out there but you know
[9:54] just allow God to
[10:00] speak and and and and we don't know how
[10:02] the Lord's going to do things right but
[10:04] he might touch on certain
[10:07] specifics that we might be going through
[10:10] that we might be experiencing maybe
[10:12] certain emotions that we can't handle
[10:15] and we don't know how to handle it and
[10:17] we know that those emotions is it's it's
[10:19] pulling us away from God or maybe
[10:22] certain appetites that we have and that
[10:25] appetites is is it's pulling us away
[10:27] from God and we know it
[10:30] so let's over this weekend let's allow
[10:33] God right to to come and identify
[10:37] certain things um and when he identifies
[10:40] it we've got to respond to him right
[10:44] she's not going to respond to by the Taz
[10:45] or whoever's going to minister by the
[10:47] Michael you're going to respond to God
[10:49] and he's a God that can change your life
[10:53] and I I stand here and I mean I don't
[10:54] know some of you would have heard my
[10:56] testimony I'm a I'm a product of a God
[11:00] that can change lives and and and and
[11:03] I've seen in my life how God has taken
[11:05] my desires and the passions that I have
[11:08] and the appetites that I used to have
[11:10] for certain things I seen how God
[11:13] changed that and he can do that to you
[11:16] right because you know what as look man
[11:18] you you guys are just beautiful sorry
[11:20] beautiful sisters and handsome Brothers
[11:23] you know and and uh man they they I I
[11:26] look at you and I say man you guys can
[11:30] shake New
[11:32] Zealand now I don't mean Shake New
[11:34] Zealand as in being loud and crazy and
[11:37] because brother brandom comes and he
[11:38] says he says it is that Sanctified
[11:43] life he says that is the Thunder against
[11:47] the
[11:48] devil he says it's that life he says you
[11:51] want to hurt the devil just live just
[11:54] live surrender to God and you know he
[11:57] will then allow you you to that life
[11:59] will just flow and it will just smash
[12:01] the devil so and I think it's not only
[12:05] New Zealand that's here there's
[12:06] Australia I think there's us and don't
[12:08] know who else is here you guys have the
[12:11] potential if not yet you guys have the
[12:15] potential to shake the world right but
[12:18] we need to be surrendered I I believe
[12:20] that you know surrender is a it's a key
[12:24] attribute of a
[12:26] Christian and that's what God wants of
[12:29] us so it's just one thing about the
[12:30] random says you know he says your
[12:33] heart is the
[12:35] altar right so many times we you know we
[12:38] have meetings and we have an altar
[12:41] call right and I used to hear the
[12:44] minister say many times um when you you
[12:47] know as as the Lord is leading make your
[12:50] heart your altar I don't know you've
[12:53] heard that before right I've I've heard
[12:54] that many times and I never understood
[12:56] it until I realize you know even when
[12:58] I'm sitting in my seat I can be speaking
[13:02] to him and just saying Lord I want to
[13:05] surrender I want to surrender this thing
[13:08] that's really Lord is bothering me and
[13:11] you you can make your heart an altar for
[13:15] God for the fire of God because you know
[13:17] as we go back into the Old Testament
[13:19] they would do an altar and the fire of
[13:22] God would come and consume the sacrifice
[13:25] so as we sit here and I just I want to
[13:27] plant the seed in you just for this
[13:30] weekend but not only for this weekend
[13:33] for you going forward you know just
[13:37] allow God you know he's he's an amazing
[13:40] God so anyway your heart is the altar
[13:42] right so we all have an altar as we sit
[13:45] here we all have an altar and there's
[13:47] some things on our
[13:49] Altar and there are some things that we
[13:52] need to give to God there are some
[13:55] things that we need to say Lord um I I I
[13:59] need you to help me I I I need Grace I
[14:02] need strength and and also I think was
[14:05] the theme we in this together right so
[14:09] you and I we are our Brother's Keeper so
[14:13] you guys might know what I'm going
[14:15] through or I might know what you're
[14:16] going through so over this weekend as
[14:18] you're praying for yourself because
[14:20] we're in this together we pray for each
[14:24] other so you're walking outside there
[14:26] and you see brother T maybe one side
[14:28] just say Lord you know for the T
[14:31] mentioned this to me Lord can you just
[14:34] meet with him can you just do something
[14:37] special in his life and then brother Taz
[14:39] is standing there and he sees you know
[14:41] brother Al there and he's also saying
[14:43] Lord you know where they meet with him
[14:47] so will you guys do that over this
[14:48] weekend you know just just support each
[14:50] other pray with each other pray for each
[14:54] other even even while and I think after
[14:56] this we're going to have some fantastic
[14:58] uh physical activities whatever even
[15:01] through all of that you know I believe
[15:03] the Lord will still continue to lead and
[15:05] help you and encourage you and you can
[15:08] encourage someone else so anyway so the
[15:10] heart is the altar right so just there
[15:13] we find the first altar that was that
[15:15] that was erected was um with Noah and
[15:18] the Lord was pleased with what Noah did
[15:22] right and the Lord smelled the sweet
[15:24] Savor and because of Noah's sacrifice
[15:27] what he sacrificed God was pleased um
[15:30] and then he said I will not again curse
[15:32] the ground anymore for man's sake right
[15:34] so that was the first uh place where an
[15:37] altar was erected and an altar now
[15:40] remember your heart is an
[15:42] altar now an altar if you go back into
[15:45] the Hebrew it's a place of Slaughter so
[15:49] they put the animal on the Altar and you
[15:51] know they would kill it it's it's a it's
[15:53] a place of killing it's a place of
[15:56] sacrifice now as we sit here and and our
[15:59] hearts is our altar there might be
[16:02] things that we are going to be
[16:05] presenting to our Lord Jesus Christ and
[16:08] we just we we present and say Lord this
[16:11] thing has got to die and Lord I'm giving
[16:14] it to you I'm you know sometimes it's
[16:18] something that we
[16:19] love so I don't forget one time Minister
[16:22] said you know there's sometimes you get
[16:24] these guys or even the sisters right
[16:26] you've got this charm about you man the
[16:31] the the if it's a guy the girls just
[16:34] love you when you come into their
[16:36] presence it's like they get all weak in
[16:38] the
[16:39] knees or then maybe the sister you know
[16:41] has got this thing and the the whenever
[16:44] she comes into the presence of the
[16:46] brothers the brothers just go
[16:48] crazy now sometimes that thing which you
[16:52] love because man it's it makes you feel
[16:55] popular but maybe that thing can be your
[16:58] D bful right and and I we we know
[17:01] personally of of of personal friends of
[17:05] mine that had this man he just had away
[17:08] with with women and the devil used that
[17:11] and he was and and and he's right now
[17:14] he's not in a good state so even those
[17:17] kind of things let's let's just give it
[17:20] to the Lord and and that is the
[17:21] sacrifice because I don't want to let go
[17:24] of being popular right but let's just
[17:27] surrender that to the Lord and think of
[17:30] it as you know what heaven is so much
[17:33] more important to me than this you know
[17:37] um
[17:38] temporary um you know sort of attention
[17:41] that I get I mean attention is good and
[17:44] I'm not sort of hitting against that but
[17:47] sometimes we just need to be kind of
[17:49] careful and watchful that certain things
[17:51] don't pull us
[17:53] down I hope you get what I'm what I'm
[17:55] saying
[17:57] right so
[17:59] I'll just I'll just touch on this one
[18:01] right now we for those of us and I'm
[18:03] sure all of us know our Bibles right we
[18:06] read our Bibles every single day
[18:10] right we Christians we are message
[18:15] Believers so um in the Bible and you can
[18:17] go read it I'm not going to go into the
[18:19] detail of it right but this is where
[18:21] Elijah had the Mount Carmel Showdown
[18:25] where he you know he had with the
[18:27] prophets of Bal and he told them you
[18:29] know what if you can get your God to
[18:31] call fire from uh bring fire down from
[18:33] heaven you know we'll serve your God or
[18:37] if my God does it you'll serve my God
[18:39] and so anyway so the prophets of B they
[18:41] built the Altar and they were going
[18:43] crazy and Elijah mocked them and they
[18:45] never ended up pulling fire down from
[18:47] from heaven right but here the Bible
[18:49] then says once they were all done now
[18:52] Elijah comes and the B and there's
[18:55] something that I want to just hit on
[18:56] here so Elijah comes and you see there
[18:58] he's busy repairing the Bible says
[19:01] repairing the altar of the Lord that was
[19:03] broken down now remember I said earlier
[19:06] your heart is the altar right so here
[19:10] Elijah comes in the First Kings 18 and
[19:13] he comes and he repairs the altar that
[19:16] was broken down okay now again and sorry
[19:19] I I like going into the Hebrew and the
[19:21] know apologize if you you feel that's
[19:23] too much but so he repaired the altar of
[19:26] the Lord and when I looked at that word
[19:28] repair so now if you look back here
[19:30] right he's got this physical bricks and
[19:33] he's building and he's fixing up things
[19:35] but if you look at that word repaired in
[19:37] the Hebrew you will find out it actually
[19:41] talks about
[19:44] healing so Elijah really went to that
[19:47] physical Altar and he went to go
[19:50] whatever he did provided some
[19:53] healing and this message is a message of
[19:57] healing healing to our hearts so yeah I
[20:02] just I want to bring that out so that
[20:03] you know he repaired the altar of the
[20:06] Lord that was broken down you know so so
[20:09] as as we're going to go through the
[20:11] meeting and God is going to be dealing
[20:13] with you and maybe some of us you know
[20:15] even though we're young people some of
[20:17] us just got to deal with hurts and we
[20:19] got to deal with pains and we got to
[20:21] deal with history and we've been hurt by
[20:23] this person and that person did this to
[20:25] me and then I walk around and I got this
[20:28] person what's the word we use I've got
[20:30] him on my heart cuz how could brother
[20:33] Canan have said that about me so now I
[20:36] walk around and all I can think about is
[20:39] brother Kanan did this so I'm carrying
[20:41] him on my heart and it's hurting me now
[20:44] God is able to come and he's able to
[20:47] provide
[20:49] healing now that is not only to the
[20:52] adults but that's to us I'm part of the
[20:55] young people that's to us as young
[20:58] people because God cares about young
[21:03] people if you go back brother bandam
[21:05] said you know I think was when he when
[21:06] he met the angel and things and
[21:08] something was said for the young people
[21:12] so God God loves you man God loves me as
[21:14] well obviously but what he did was so he
[21:17] repaired the altar so there were things
[21:20] that needed to be made right there was
[21:22] healing that needed to be that needed to
[21:25] happen and then the Bible says and then
[21:27] the fire of the Lord
[21:28] came down right so obviously that takes
[21:32] me to our scripture right and I'm
[21:35] sure all of you can quote the scripture
[21:40] closed
[21:41] eyes
[21:43] right I hope so that's my scripture I
[21:46] grew up with it you know behold I send
[21:49] you Elijah the prophet and what what
[21:53] does it say and he will
[21:55] turn the hearts so it's back to the
[21:58] heart and it's it's about taking you and
[22:01] me and turning us back to the revealed
[22:06] word so it's about you know so that's
[22:08] why I I just wrote there I said this
[22:10] message don't underestimate it and and
[22:14] and don't think it's just like another
[22:16] cult or another this is a message that
[22:19] is healing us this is a message that is
[22:23] strengthening us this is a message that
[22:26] is helping brother tears to
[22:30] overcome so this is a message to the
[22:35] heart so as we're going to hear God
[22:38] speaking and he's dealing with us re
[22:41] receive it you know I think brother
[22:44] brother Steven came to minister for us
[22:45] one time I'm going to finish soon
[22:47] brother Steven came to minister for us
[22:48] one time and he read a quote which man
[22:50] it just blew me away where he said
[22:53] brandom talks about we have to receive
[22:56] the word right it's important so we we
[22:59] sitting here and we we listen to brother
[23:01] T speaking and as long as brother T is
[23:04] speaking the word of God which I believe
[23:05] I am we've got to receive the word right
[23:10] but what I love brother the brandham
[23:11] says is that we might have come in here
[23:14] right all sad and Droopy and tired but
[23:18] he says as we receive the word right the
[23:22] Bible brother brandom says as you
[23:24] receive the word you become the word
[23:27] right so you become a Powerhouse but
[23:30] what I love brother the bandam said is
[23:32] as we sitting in the meeting right and
[23:34] he says as the the word is going forth
[23:37] and as you sitting here something
[23:39] Supernatural is
[23:41] happening it's not just brother the
[23:42] Michael coming up here and preaching the
[23:44] word and saying
[23:46] stuff but we are Supernatural young
[23:50] people and matur adult people right and
[23:55] and and and and and and we we we we we
[23:58] live in the Realms of the supernatural
[24:00] even right
[24:02] now so brother bandam says as as as the
[24:06] word Goes Forth and as you receive the
[24:08] word it has an impact on you so he uses
[24:13] he says he says your eyes that was
[24:16] droopy and tired cuz I didn't have
[24:18] enough sleep last night he says it
[24:20] starts to brighten up because you as you
[24:23] receive the word and the god reveals the
[24:26] word to you you start realizing wow this
[24:30] is powerful stuff and it's not only
[24:33] stuff about that it's it's it's talking
[24:35] about me and it's saying how what
[24:39] Authority I have that's within
[24:42] me and and I hope you you know that
[24:45] right this this message this message
[24:48] comes and it tells us who God is right
[24:53] and it tells us who the devil is because
[24:56] we need to know our enemy
[24:58] but it also tells you who you are and
[25:03] that's I believe it's also so important
[25:05] Michael we need to know who we are
[25:08] because when we leave this beautiful
[25:10] atmosphere and this beautiful camp and
[25:12] we go out there the devil is going to
[25:17] challenge us but what did you sing
[25:20] earlier he didn't let the devil win I
[25:26] purposefully made you s it because I
[25:29] want it to come from your
[25:31] lips he didn't let the devil win and the
[25:34] devil will not not not win over this
[25:38] weekend God is going to win and God is
[25:40] already winning okay so this is the
[25:43] message to the heart so I'll just go
[25:46] through this and then we'll finish so
[25:47] this brother the Brandon really just
[25:49] talks about these things right so he
[25:50] talks about the the he says um he he
[25:53] draws he he actually goes and draws on
[25:55] the white board and he says he's a human
[25:57] heart on the left and and there's a
[25:59] human heart on the on the right so now
[26:01] we spoke earlier about the heart that
[26:02] you know from the heart your desires
[26:05] your emotions your appetites and all
[26:07] these sorts of things right so but talks
[26:09] about
[26:11] that
[26:12] now I put that up there's a disclaimer
[26:15] if you don't like snakes if you don't
[26:17] like looking at snakes you can't close
[26:19] your eyes right cuz there's some
[26:22] pictures of snakes but listen so don't
[26:25] close your ears close your eyes if you
[26:28] want to right now brother Brandon this
[26:30] is brother Brandon sort of tells us he
[26:32] says so he talks about the one heart he
[26:35] says this heart has got a snake in it
[26:37] and it's sin and it's it's a life right
[26:41] so this is somebody that's got a you
[26:43] know it's and and that snake really is
[26:45] kind of the the nature so that snake has
[26:47] got a snake
[26:49] nature so the desires and the passions
[26:52] and the appetites And the emotions and
[26:54] all those things that comes out of you
[26:57] or the the person is kind of the
[27:00] characteristics of a snake right so
[27:04] brother B talks about that then oops
[27:07] what's happening here now what did I
[27:08] just do next one next one can you go
[27:11] okay next one so then he says on the
[27:13] other side there's another heart right
[27:16] and then he says this one here has a
[27:18] dove in it right and he says that has
[27:22] got a life and then from that heart on
[27:24] the right the desires the passions the
[27:27] appe has the emotions and the way we do
[27:29] things it's
[27:31] influenced by what's on the inside on
[27:34] the right and obviously there are people
[27:37] that's on the left that's got that
[27:39] characteristics but at the end of the
[27:41] day God wants us to have the
[27:43] characteristics which is on the right
[27:46] and that is why we go to church that is
[27:48] why the Lord speaks to us constantly
[27:52] because he wants to change us he wants
[27:55] to transform us us right so now by the
[28:00] goes on and he talks about the one with
[28:01] the snake which is not not such a kind
[28:04] of good nature and he says you know this
[28:06] malice and this hatred and this Envy so
[28:09] that is the characteristics that comes
[28:10] out right but then on the right with the
[28:14] dove it's just love that flows Longs
[28:18] suffering and joy and man it's just
[28:20] awesome to be a Christian so God wants
[28:23] us to move from wherever we are to that
[28:26] side and he makes a way and he makes it
[28:28] possible right so now brother Brandon
[28:32] says now when you are so you repent and
[28:35] you say Lord I'm sorry so he forgives
[28:37] you right forgives you of the sins and
[28:39] then those things like malice and hatred
[28:42] and envy you know it goes
[28:45] away but the root cause is still there
[28:49] so there needs to be an inside
[28:52] change right and that's what God wants
[28:55] to do with us but we need to be be
[28:57] willing we need to say Lord I want a
[29:01] change right so he says that made you're
[29:05] still there he forgives you but that
[29:08] that nature needs to change right and
[29:10] then he talks about uh you know you
[29:12] being clean and set aside for service
[29:15] and then he says then comes the baptism
[29:18] of fire and the holy ghost that God
[29:21] might dwell in us and the fire of God
[29:25] cleanses our hearts so I believe you
[29:28] know as we're going to be in these
[29:29] meetings and as the Lord is going to
[29:31] speak to us and as we're going to sit
[29:34] with surrendered
[29:36] Hearts we're going to allow God right to
[29:41] deal with us right and we're going to
[29:44] allow God to maybe highlight certain
[29:46] things I I'll finish I've got one more
[29:48] slide right so if you picture this a big
[29:52] a big drum a big drum right and in this
[29:57] drum if you go to it it's been standing
[30:00] stagnant for a long time and in this
[30:03] drum there's water that's laying there
[30:07] so when you go and look at that drum and
[30:09] man the water looks clear but if you go
[30:12] and you just give that drum a big kick
[30:15] what happens the rubbish that's at the
[30:18] bottom starts coming up right now I
[30:22] believe over this weekend God might kick
[30:26] you
[30:28] allow
[30:30] him I think it's good because then he's
[30:33] going to start showing hey
[30:36] T that
[30:39] temper and you know what I'll just I'll
[30:41] finish over this and
[30:44] um um so question is what is on the
[30:48] altar of your heart right now over this
[30:50] weekend that we need to give to God or
[30:53] that God can come and heal right it's
[30:56] about healing this this week weekend
[30:57] it's we all in this together and it's
[31:00] about God coming in healing right let's
[31:03] allow him to consume what's on your
[31:05] heart allow him that's it's about
[31:08] surrender right that's important you
[31:11] forget a lot of things the T said today
[31:13] remember that one word
[31:16] surrender okay surrender allow him to
[31:20] heal just give it to him speak to him
[31:24] say Lord I I'm struggling with this and
[31:26] you see I got that at the bottom there
[31:28] Satan has got no power over you after
[31:31] confession cuz that's the devil does e
[31:34] he he we do things we make things we
[31:36] make mistakes and we fail God and we you
[31:38] know do stuff we shouldn't do and then
[31:41] the devil keeps us there and uh you want
[31:45] to you want to you know um get up from
[31:49] there but he says nah just
[31:52] remember but he doesn't tell you that
[31:55] God has made a way for us to to break
[31:57] out of that right so say so it's about
[32:01] you know we we we we need to repent and
[32:03] we need to make things right because we
[32:06] want to be free we want to en you know
[32:10] what being a Christian is not
[32:12] boring being a Christian is not being
[32:15] bound by
[32:16] chains being a Christian is being
[32:20] free and those of you that know by the T
[32:24] I love being
[32:26] free I love to dance I love to sing and
[32:29] I said I know I sing false but it's okay
[32:31] I don't care you know I want to be free
[32:34] because it's wonderful to be a
[32:37] Christian don't let anybody tell you
[32:39] it's boring and I you know man once once
[32:42] you've had an that experience with God
[32:46] and once he's transformed he's genuinely
[32:48] transformed your life you will realize
[32:51] that the stuff that I was doing there
[32:53] was really keeping me in bondage because
[32:57] now I am
[32:59] free and just speak to these ministers
[33:01] there and the adults they can tell you
[33:03] it is awesome and I know I'm taking too
[33:06] much time but I'm going to finish off
[33:07] here now you see we can be guilt-free cu
[33:11] the devil wants to put us on a guilt
[33:13] trip but you this
[33:16] weekend you can be you can walk away
[33:19] from this you might have come you
[33:23] guilty but there's a song that we sing
[33:26] Jesus drop the
[33:29] charges but we have to give it over to
[33:32] him we have to
[33:34] surrender last quote this is my last
[33:37] thing I put that Mouse strap there
[33:41] because that's what happened to many of
[33:43] us the enemy dangles that piece of
[33:47] cheese that we just
[33:49] love and it's so
[33:52] irresistible and we go and we take a
[33:55] bite just a little bite not realizing
[33:58] when we take that little bite bam the
[34:02] Trap hits us and we find ourselves
[34:06] trapped in
[34:08] something and we want to get out but oh
[34:11] man it's so hard and then the devil
[34:14] tells us just stay there remember this
[34:17] quote there might be many things in this
[34:20] life that the enemy has trapped you
[34:25] in cuz the enemy does I want you to know
[34:27] who you
[34:29] are trapped you into but remember my
[34:32] brother and my sister you still have the
[34:38] right to have a conference with
[34:43] God use this opportunity use this and
[34:48] I'm hoping it's okay that this devotion
[34:50] I just thought I wanted to make it kind
[34:52] of to make us really look into
[34:55] ourselves right because this is a matter
[34:58] of life and death you know this is a
[35:01] battle it's a fight and God told me the
[35:04] AL to have these meetings for you and
[35:07] again I came to a meeting like this and
[35:10] was there when my life was changed so
[35:12] you might and I look I know there's some
[35:14] of you here that I know that came to
[35:16] meetings like this and your lives were
[35:18] changed and I see you today and I say
[35:20] Lord thank you that you're still holding
[35:22] them cuz you're still holding me so you
[35:25] have the right so don't don't let the
[35:27] devil tell
[35:28] you that you know when God wants to deal
[35:31] with you and he pulls you and he calls
[35:32] you don't let the devil tell you know
[35:34] you can't you can't make right you can't
[35:37] repent you can't don't listen to him cuz
[35:40] he's going to tell you he's going to
[35:43] preach to you all the time because you
[35:46] mean if if you're going and listen to by
[35:47] the brandham services meetings the enemy
[35:50] was in the meetings so the devil is
[35:53] going to want to stop you don't don't
[35:57] let
[35:59] him and like again we're in this
[36:03] together so if you know that you know
[36:07] the devil is trying to push your brother
[36:09] down pray for him Devil's trying to push
[36:12] your sister down pray for her support
[36:14] him love love each other this weekend
[36:18] right he's a very present help in times
[36:23] of trouble so I'm hoping that devotion
[36:27] was okay and I'm hoping it just sets you
[36:30] you know sets us sets us up for the
[36:34] weekend and uh you know and and just
[36:37] let's let's just surrender that's all

[39:23] together time of Fellowship time of
[39:25] enjoyment and we'll say a lot of other
[39:27] things later but um main thing right now
[39:32] is um is that we gather here the other
[39:35] thing is has anyone not got a hoodie yet
[39:38] can you just raise your
[39:40] hand two three four okay five six so if
[39:47] you if you don't have a hoodie yet
[39:48] please see p now okay I'll tell you a
[39:52] secret right if you want to get her
[39:54] angry call her sister priscella
[39:57] [Laughter]
[40:02] she prefers to be called pillar right
[40:04] and and I'm El you don't have to brother
[40:06] or Pastor I'm El right um anyway I want
[40:10] us to be free and to enjoy the time
[40:12] together um so I I'm going to maybe just
[40:15] before we say grace can someone just
[40:17] call step oh there you are maybe we'll
[40:20] um just let Steph needs to tell us a few
[40:22] things that the camp has instructed us
[40:24] to do regarding the food rules so while
[40:27] I have you here sorry to do this here in
[40:28] the sanctuary but let Steven tell you
[40:30] what's going on
[40:32] there morning God bless you all right
[40:35] just a few little things Logistics just
[40:37] to keep things flowing easy in the
[40:39] kitchen area so the dishing up process
[40:43] is going to be when they call you to
[40:45] canish up is come around that side and
[40:48] collect a plate and then you'll get your
[40:51] food and the knives and forks and Cat on
[40:53] right then you come back into this side
[40:54] of the hall this side and then
[40:56] take up seating from there um once
[40:59] you're done with the meal um basically
[41:02] back you'll see where you did the
[41:04] serving up there is a table with some
[41:07] trays where you put your C in um knives
[41:09] and forks and spoons is separate trays
[41:11] for those and they go with a handle up
[41:14] so the the the place that the part that
[41:17] you put in your mouth goes in the hot
[41:18] water so it starts to um clean that a
[41:21] little bit before we have to wash them
[41:23] in the back so and then also there's two
[41:25] different color BNS the red the red bin
[41:29] out the front there is for food scraps
[41:31] so that's ones that goes to the pigs
[41:33] after it so just make sure that that's
[41:35] with all your food scraps no papers
[41:38] Plastics or anything like that will go
[41:39] in that bin and I think the other one's
[41:41] a green color one is for your liquid so
[41:43] if you've got leftover coffee water
[41:45] throw it inside there turn the cup
[41:47] upside down inside the tray provided on
[41:49] the
[41:50] table um and there's also little
[41:52] spatulas please clean off your plates as
[41:55] clean as you can
[41:56] and then just put it on on the where you
[41:58] collected the plates um it's up on the
[42:01] server there and then we'll deal with it
[42:03] from there um and then also there's no
[42:06] go areas in the kitchen so where we're
[42:08] dishing up behind that is where the
[42:10] dishes get washed um if anyone is
[42:12] interested in assisting the kitchen
[42:14] staff there we happy for you to come and
[42:16] help us there with the the washing up
[42:19] but anything beyond that um is Staff
[42:21] only so that's health and safety reasons
[42:23] and those kind of issues so no one in
[42:25] the back section of the kitchen at all
[42:28] all right so I think that kind of covers
[42:29] that if you got any questions didn't
[42:32] understand just come and see me or any
[42:34] of the kitchen staff will be able to
[42:36] point in the right direction well
[42:39] good thank you very much maybe we should
[42:41] already give the kitchen staff
[42:47] ahead okay so a quick
[42:51] quiz what goes in the red
[42:55] bucket
[42:56] SC food scraps what goes in the green
[42:59] bucket liquid liquids so what do you do
[43:02] with all your servat and Plastics and
