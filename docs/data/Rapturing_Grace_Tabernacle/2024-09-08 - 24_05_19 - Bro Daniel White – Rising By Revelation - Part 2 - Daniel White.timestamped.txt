[44:30] amen the Lord bless you tonight why
[44:31] don't we turn in our
[44:33] Bibles uh to the book of uh
[44:37] Revelation uh just want to look at this
[44:40] thought here tonight
[44:44] um Rising by Revelation and we're just
[44:47] not going to look at all those
[44:48] scriptures tonight just for the sake of
[44:49] time we'll just turn to Revelation 5 and
[44:53] then we'll go to Luke chapter 4
[45:00] Revelation 5 verse verse one and I saw
[45:03] in the right hand of him that sat upon
[45:05] the throne a book written within and on
[45:08] the backside sealed with Seven
[45:11] Seals and I saw a strong Angel
[45:13] proclaimed with a loud voice who is
[45:16] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[45:19] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[45:22] on Earth neither under the Earth was
[45:24] able to open the book neither to look
[45:26] there on
[45:27] and I wept much because no man was
[45:29] worthy to open the book and to read the
[45:32] book neither to look there on there was
[45:36] a sacredness about this
[45:38] book and one of the elders saith unto me
[45:41] weep not behold the line of the tribe of
[45:44] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[45:47] to open the book and to loose the seals
[45:51] thereof and I beheld and loow in the
[45:54] midst of the throne and of the four
[45:57] beasts and of and in the midst of the
[46:00] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[46:04] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[46:07] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[46:09] into the world and he came and took the
[46:13] book out of the right hand of him that
[46:18] sat upon the throne amen we know it
[46:21] didn't end there The Taking of the book
[46:23] was just the beginning but um we can
[46:26] only go so far tonight uh let's turn to
[46:29] Luke
[46:31] 4 uh Luke
[46:33] 4:14 we we spoke about this as the Lord
[46:37] was leading us through the the service
[46:39] this
[46:41] morning uh Luke Luke
[46:44] 414 and Jesus
[46:47] returned in the power of the spirit un
[46:51] Galilee and there went out of him Fame
[46:54] of him through all the region round
[46:58] about and he taught in their
[47:01] synagogues being glorified of
[47:03] all and he came to Nazareth where he had
[47:07] been brought up and as his custom was he
[47:12] went into the K
[47:14] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[47:20] up for to
[47:23] read and there was delivered unto him a
[47:26] book
[47:27] of the Prophet
[47:29] Isaias and when he had opened the book
[47:32] he found the place where it was
[47:35] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[47:38] me because he has anointed me to preach
[47:41] the gospel to the
[47:43] poor he hath sent me to heal the
[47:47] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[47:50] the captives to and the recovering of
[47:53] the spirit to the blind sight to the
[47:55] blind and to set at Liberty them that
[47:58] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[48:01] year of the
[48:03] Lord and he closed the book and he gave
[48:06] it again to the minister and sat down
[48:10] and the eyes of all them that were in
[48:12] this synagogue were fastened on him and
[48:16] he be to say unto them this day is this
[48:19] scripture fulfilled in your ears and all
[48:23] bear witness of him and wandered at the
[48:25] gracious words which proceeded out of
[48:27] his mouth and they said is not this
[48:32] Joseph's son Heavenly Father Lord God we
[48:35] just ask a blessing upon the reading of
[48:37] this word Lord and Lord may you impart
[48:40] to us Lord God the things that you
[48:42] desire for this evening we pray in Jesus
[48:46] Christ's name
[48:48] amen amen God bless you you can take
[48:50] your seats tonight just to um just to
[48:55] one want you to know here that Jesus was
[48:58] able
[48:59] to take the book he was able to take the
[49:03] book he took the book out of the out of
[49:05] the hand of the out of the hand of the
[49:07] minister and he found the place where it
[49:10] was written of him he didn't open the
[49:13] book to find to hoping that God would
[49:15] reveal
[49:18] him but he opened the book in the
[49:22] revelation of who he
[49:24] was amen he he opened the book in the
[49:28] revelation of who he was all right he
[49:31] found the place where it was written of
[49:34] him he couldn't do that unless he was a
[49:36] revelation unto himself which we know
[49:39] that he is so if the New Testament the
[49:41] Old Testament Masterpiece was a
[49:43] revelation unto himself then the New
[49:46] Testament Masterpiece will also be a
[49:48] revelation unto herself and she will be
[49:52] able to pick up the book and open the
[49:56] book and find where it is written of her
[50:01] amen so it's it this is what takes the
[50:04] religious Spirits
[50:06] away when when when we can find when we
[50:09] have the revelation of who we are we
[50:11] don't need to be religious but the
[50:13] reason that we become religious is
[50:15] because we're lacking in Revelation
[50:17] Jesus was not a religious man the
[50:19] Pharisees and the Sadducees were
[50:21] religious people because they didn't
[50:23] have a revelation of who they are
[50:25] everything we need is
[50:27] Revelation absolutely everything that we
[50:29] need is the revelation of this word It's
[50:32] contained in this book so the the
[50:35] transition that we make from being
[50:36] religious to being a
[50:41] revelation is when God opens up his word
[50:44] and then we become a a revelation unto
[50:47] ourself up until then we're just
[50:50] religious right so don't get angry with
[50:53] people who are religious they can't help
[50:55] it it's God that's got to change them
[50:59] the same way that God changed you the
[51:02] same way that God changed me all right
[51:04] because once I was religious once I
[51:06] looked at
[51:15] people but now what God wants is for his
[51:19] bride to be able to pick up the
[51:21] book where he wrote of her
[51:27] the scriptures
[51:28] inspired right the scripture is inspired
[51:31] so God wants us to pick up the book it's
[51:33] been around for a while it's been opened
[51:36] a few times but he wants us to open the
[51:39] book
[51:40] differently he wants us to open the book
[51:42] with the revelation of who we are not
[51:45] searching for the revelation of who we
[51:48] are but we can't do that ourself amen
[51:51] amen I just want to touch on this quote
[51:53] here again the prophet of God says he he
[51:56] was all the prophets made one plus even
[51:59] that so we know who plus even that
[52:04] is plus even that is sitting here
[52:06] tonight amen so it's the New Testament
[52:09] bride amen cuz he was the fullness of
[52:12] the word he was all the word the word of
[52:14] the the prophets was just the word to
[52:16] that age but he was the word to all ages
[52:19] he was God himself coming down and
[52:22] manifested in a body of Flesh
[52:27] amen Revelations 10:7 I'm just skipping
[52:30] through some of these to get to the bit
[52:32] that we we want to get to but in the
[52:34] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[52:36] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[52:38] of God should be finished who's the
[52:41] seventh angel the last Angel the last
[52:44] Angel all right he's the Forerunner he
[52:48] he's the one who's going to introduce
[52:49] the Masterpiece to the
[52:52] Masterpiece cuz it's not a public
[52:53] revealing he's going to introduce the
[52:55] Masterpiece to the Masterpiece he's not
[52:58] going to introduce the Masterpiece to
[52:59] the
[53:00] world no no he's going to introduce the
[53:03] Masterpiece to herself in when in the
[53:05] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[53:08] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[53:10] of God the mystery of God Amen the New
[53:13] Testament mystery of God is going to be
[53:16] finished amen praise God Amen so just
[53:21] skipping through
[53:22] here
[53:25] um in this hour we are not seeing the
[53:29] word
[53:30] impartial but we are actually seeing the
[53:33] fullness of the word amen so when we
[53:36] talk about the fullness of the word
[53:37] sometimes these things can be a little
[53:39] bit confusing to us but we're actually
[53:42] seeing the fullness of the word meaning
[53:44] that we're now seeing both bride and
[53:46] groom United together as
[53:49] one they're Inseparable nothing what God
[53:53] ha joined together let no man put us
[53:56] under
[53:57] all right so we're we're seeing the
[53:58] manifestation of this Bible we're we're
[54:01] we're seeing the the manifestation of
[54:03] this Bible in its fullness how in a
[54:06] marital Union it's Rebecca and Isaac
[54:09] coming together in a tent
[54:11] meeting United together in that tent I
[54:15] he said who was that the groom we'll
[54:17] meet you in there all right it's it's a
[54:19] meeting it's a union it's an invisible
[54:22] Union what who between the groom and his
[54:26] bride Christ and his bride amen the the
[54:29] word
[54:30] groom coming to the word bride or we
[54:33] could say the word groom coming for the
[54:35] word
[54:38] bride amen amen so this is what we are
[54:42] in fact looking
[54:44] at and I think I mentioned it yesterday
[54:47] but I I'm I'm I have to remind
[54:53] myself that I'm married to Christ
[54:58] Christ because there's things in my life
[55:00] that I come across that I as as the
[55:04] bride that I try to do myself but I
[55:06] realize I've got a
[55:08] groom because I'm not I'm I've
[55:11] transitioned from bride to wife I'm now
[55:15] married I'm now the
[55:17] wife right so as as wife the bride can't
[55:20] say that but a but when a bride becomes
[55:23] a
[55:24] wife at the altar how through a
[55:27] union she becomes wife so now because
[55:31] I'm newly wed I've got to remind myself
[55:36] that I'm married to him meaning that
[55:39] when I come across things that I can't
[55:41] handle that are too big for me I don't
[55:43] have to
[55:46] worry because I can take it to him why
[55:49] because I'm now looking at
[55:52] this I'm now looking at this it's the
[55:55] New Testament and the Old Testament
[55:57] United together in a marital Union it's
[56:00] Rebecca and Isaac United together as one
[56:05] and as a result of that there's a life
[56:07] that comes forth that is his very life
[56:11] it's his very life in me all right so
[56:15] this is this is why Revelations
[56:18] 5 um this is why in Revelations 5 the
[56:23] only one who was worthy to open the book
[56:26] was the groom of the
[56:30] book it was his
[56:33] book that book was a part of
[56:37] himself and when that lamb come forth he
[56:41] was Bloody he had paid the price he had
[56:43] won the battle he had
[56:46] prevailed he was worthy now to come
[56:50] forward and take the
[56:53] book right so now now he came to reveal
[56:59] a part of himself he didn't come to
[57:01] reveal a foreign part amen but he came
[57:04] to reveal a part of himself he came to
[57:08] reveal his bride who is a part of
[57:12] himself it was a masterpiece of
[57:20] himself is the we'll just move into this
[57:23] this uh scripture here in Genesis 221
[57:27] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[57:29] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[57:31] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[57:34] thereof and the rib and the rib which
[57:38] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[57:40] a woman and bought her unto the man all
[57:46] right he bought her God bought her unto
[57:49] the man yeah all right now just listen
[57:53] to this
[57:56] now but then we will notice NE them how
[57:59] how sweet and lovely they
[58:01] was and now I I say his eyes her eyes
[58:06] like the stars shining as blue as they
[58:10] could be and them like just Sparkle she
[58:14] must have been beautiful and Adam looked
[58:18] at her why it was love at first sight an
[58:22] operation had been formed and she was
[58:26] taken from his side and he must have
[58:29] took her by the
[58:32] hand and we'd say this let's take a
[58:35] little stroll
[58:37] darling so the prophet is explaining
[58:39] here and he says he he he he must have
[58:41] come and taken her by the
[58:43] hand he must have come and taken that
[58:46] part of him s by the
[58:52] hand I'll just go to the next slide here
[58:54] won't go to that just aing bring that
[58:56] illustration in and and and the rib
[59:00] which the Lord God had taken from man
[59:01] made he a woman and bought her unto the
[59:04] man now now just to look at this for a
[59:07] little bit because I believe what
[59:09] happened here was that Adam stepped
[59:12] forward when God brought his
[59:16] bride to him he stepped
[59:21] forward he stepped forward to take
[59:25] possession
[59:26] yes of a part of
[59:30] himself he stepped forward to take a
[59:33] possession of a part of
[59:36] himself his bride wasn't a foreign
[59:39] object but she was taken from
[59:42] him and be and because she was taken
[59:46] from him now God she was the workmanship
[59:50] of
[59:51] God and now God was reuniting
[59:56] that's these two
[59:59] parts back together again right this
[1:00:02] wasn't a union this was a
[1:00:05] reunion because once they were United as
[1:00:08] one but now so but now God had formed
[1:00:12] that that mystery part that was in Adam
[1:00:14] that we saw this morning God had brought
[1:00:17] that
[1:00:18] forward because God had said let us make
[1:00:20] a help mate help meat for Adam so the
[1:00:24] word went forth and then come the
[1:00:26] manifestation the word came forth that
[1:00:30] the the the word was spoken and then the
[1:00:32] word was manifested but at this point
[1:00:36] the word is not revealed Adam's bride at
[1:00:39] this point is not
[1:00:42] revealed at this point nothing is spoken
[1:00:45] of
[1:00:46] her when when when he when God bought
[1:00:51] the woman to the man the woman was
[1:00:54] sealed
[1:00:57] yeah she was a
[1:01:00] mystery H she didn't know who she was
[1:01:05] she was a mystery to
[1:01:07] herself she wasn't a mystery to the one
[1:01:10] who created her and she was not a
[1:01:12] mystery to Adam but she was a mystery to
[1:01:15] herself so so the part the mystery part
[1:01:18] the master the feminine Masterpiece of
[1:01:21] Adam was a was a was a
[1:01:24] sealed to her
[1:01:27] self she didn't know who she
[1:01:30] was
[1:01:31] true now you put this in relation to
[1:01:35] Revelation 5:7 and he came and took the
[1:01:38] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:01:39] sat upon the throne he came and took the
[1:01:42] book who came and took the book The
[1:01:43] Groom the
[1:01:46] lamb when John said Behold the Lamb of
[1:01:49] God you were in him
[1:01:51] then we can say this this was lamb
[1:01:54] coming to lamb
[1:01:57] beautiful this was word coming to
[1:02:00] word amen but but but the you see the
[1:02:06] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:02:07] throne we know who that
[1:02:10] is that was God right that was the
[1:02:13] father we can say but now the lamb is
[1:02:17] coming forward to take possession of
[1:02:21] what is his
[1:02:27] as God brought the woman to the
[1:02:31] man Adam stepped forward to take
[1:02:34] possession of a part of
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:36] himself all right the book was
[1:02:40] his the woman was
[1:02:43] Adam's it was Adam coming to
[1:02:48] Adam amen amen it was Adam coming to
[1:02:52] Adam that's why she got her name after
[1:02:55] the fall but it was actually her name
[1:02:57] was Adam and their name was Adam it was
[1:03:00] Adam coming to
[1:03:02] Adam so what's the name of the book The
[1:03:06] Prophet would say what was revealed
[1:03:08] behind those seals he said it was
[1:03:11] Christ it was Christ coming to
[1:03:16] Christ glory to
[1:03:19] God it's such a beautiful
[1:03:22] picture it's such a beautiful happening
[1:03:25] it's such a beautiful
[1:03:27] event true amen amen so we we notice
[1:03:32] here that the lamb comes forth and takes
[1:03:36] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:03:38] that sat upon the throne but it was
[1:03:40] still
[1:03:43] sealed when when God brought the woman
[1:03:46] to the man and the W the man took the W
[1:03:49] Adam took his bride by the hand she was
[1:03:51] still
[1:03:52] sealed she was still a mystery to
[1:03:55] herself
[1:03:57] when the lamb stood came forth and took
[1:03:59] the book the book was still
[1:04:01] sealed the book wasn't open in the
[1:04:03] transition here the book wasn't open
[1:04:06] before the transition the book was
[1:04:08] sealed because there was only one who
[1:04:10] was
[1:04:16] worthy you see God didn't bring the book
[1:04:18] in the in the Garden of Eden he he
[1:04:20] didn't bring the woman to the
[1:04:24] monkey he didn't bring the woman woman
[1:04:25] to the
[1:04:27] donkey he knew who who who this was
[1:04:31] for amen he knew who it was for he knew
[1:04:35] who this belonged to he knew what it was
[1:04:37] a part of who she was a part of and it
[1:04:40] was his desire for those two parts to
[1:04:43] come into contact with one another again
[1:04:45] come into Union with one another
[1:04:49] again but the the she was sealed so
[1:04:52] possession comes first
[1:04:56] yes he took the book he took
[1:05:02] possession before he opened the seals he
[1:05:06] took
[1:05:19] possession now look what happens in in
[1:05:22] verse 23 sorry the breach now and now
[1:05:25] we're going to see what the book says
[1:05:28] about how it become
[1:05:30] open and it's not made known until the
[1:05:33] lamb takes the
[1:05:35] book and and breaks the seals and opens
[1:05:39] the book see the Lamb's got to take the
[1:05:43] book it's
[1:05:47] his amen it's not made known until the
[1:05:51] lamb takes the book once the lamb takes
[1:05:56] the
[1:05:57] book now he can open
[1:06:00] it why it's
[1:06:02] his the book is his glory to God Amen
[1:06:08] and Adam said
[1:06:12] yes amen amen and and Adam said what
[1:06:16] what did verse 22 who who spoke in verse
[1:06:20] 23 no one
[1:06:24] did say vers 22 no one
[1:06:27] did but he took possession in verse 23
[1:06:32] Adam
[1:06:35] speaks so in verse 23 Adam begins to
[1:06:39] reveal the mystery part of
[1:06:44] himself not to
[1:06:52] him Adam speaking to her
[1:06:59] Adam is
[1:07:02] removing the
[1:07:04] seals from around her
[1:07:08] life
[1:07:09] Adam
[1:07:13] said this is now bone of my burone and
[1:07:18] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[1:07:21] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:07:26] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh what I
[1:07:30] am you
[1:07:33] are what I reveal to you about myself
[1:07:37] you are you are bone of my bone and
[1:07:41] Flesh of My Flesh the same word that
[1:07:44] speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride
[1:07:47] what I am you
[1:07:49] are but it was Adam there was only one
[1:07:52] worthy there was only one able
[1:07:56] amen
[1:07:57] amen and the one who was worthy and the
[1:08:00] one who was able was the one that she
[1:08:02] come out
[1:08:09] of so the woman was
[1:08:13] United with the one that she come out of
[1:08:16] and as a result of the
[1:08:19] uniting you ever seen the third pull in
[1:08:21] the in Genesis
[1:08:23] 2 you ever seen the tent meeting in
[1:08:26] Genesis 2 that's
[1:08:29] right I'll meet you in there and as a
[1:08:32] result of this meeting you ain't going
[1:08:34] to be the same you going we're going to
[1:08:36] go we're going to meet a certain way but
[1:08:39] from that meeting where you're going to
[1:08:40] come out of that meeting
[1:08:45] differently praise the Lord amen no one
[1:08:49] was worthy no one was able only only
[1:08:55] Adam was able and we read in Genesis 5
[1:08:59] how uh sorry Revelation 5 how no one was
[1:09:01] worthy John looked and no one was worthy
[1:09:04] no one was able no he couldn't find
[1:09:07] anyone or to even look
[1:09:11] thereon and brother Bram talks about the
[1:09:14] sacredness of the female
[1:09:18] body this book is
[1:09:23] sacred absolutely
[1:09:25] she's
[1:09:28] sacred she is sacred no one's there's
[1:09:31] only one who's
[1:09:35] worthy there's only one who's worthy
[1:09:38] there's only one who's able there's only
[1:09:40] one that has a right to look there
[1:09:48] on so we come down to the the union here
[1:09:52] between the bride and the groom and you
[1:09:54] you know you can just take these
[1:09:55] pictures and you know just see the in in
[1:09:59] symbol form what is what is actually
[1:10:02] happening here but we understand that
[1:10:04] the the the lamb steps forth and takes
[1:10:08] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:10:09] that sat upon the
[1:10:11] throne but then in Revelation 6 he
[1:10:14] begins to remove the
[1:10:17] seals from the book and reveal the
[1:10:22] contents so when the when the book comes
[1:10:25] into the hands of of the of the Lamb we
[1:10:29] we understand what was happening we
[1:10:33] understand what was going on we
[1:10:35] understand that he was the only one
[1:10:37] worthy and I know I'm laboring that but
[1:10:39] I need to he was the only one who was
[1:10:42] able the same reason that Adam was the
[1:10:44] only one who was worthy the only one who
[1:10:46] was able is the same reason that the
[1:10:49] lamb is the only one who is able and the
[1:10:51] only one who is worthy to reveal a
[1:10:54] mystery beh behind this
[1:10:57] book this
[1:11:00] book but the lamb was coming forth for a
[1:11:03] part of
[1:11:05] himself he was stepping forward for a
[1:11:08] part of himself he was stepping forward
[1:11:10] for the New Testament part of himself he
[1:11:13] was stepping forward for the mystery
[1:11:15] part that no one could see when he was
[1:11:18] on Earth 2 year ago but now because the
[1:11:21] word has been spoken and now it has
[1:11:24] become manifest ested now God is
[1:11:27] revealing that which has become
[1:11:29] manifested by a
[1:11:35] message
[1:11:37] Hallelujah no one was worthy no one was
[1:11:42] able only one was able only one was
[1:11:46] worthy so the lamb steps forth and takes
[1:11:49] the book and as a result of taking the
[1:11:53] book what what what what what is it it's
[1:11:55] it's a
[1:11:56] union yes in that Union between the lamb
[1:12:01] and the book things
[1:12:04] happen the book can't be the
[1:12:08] same after this
[1:12:10] Union it can't be
[1:12:13] reversed after this Union it can't be
[1:12:16] the
[1:12:17] same amen praise God but we we're we're
[1:12:22] not we're not looking at a literal book
[1:12:24] where reading about it in the book but
[1:12:29] the book has become flesh the book has
[1:12:32] become manifested this is the written
[1:12:35] word of God but now the written word of
[1:12:38] God has become flesh so there's a book
[1:12:41] on Earth that God has come to take
[1:12:43] possession
[1:12:45] of amen and in that possession his
[1:12:48] desire is for the book to know
[1:12:51] itself yes it's his desire for the to
[1:12:55] reveal the book to the
[1:12:59] book when Jesus Took the book in Luke
[1:13:02] chapter 4 it was his desire to reveal
[1:13:06] the book to the people who were reading
[1:13:10] the
[1:13:12] book but now in this day the groom has
[1:13:16] stepped
[1:13:17] forward to take possession of the book
[1:13:21] to reveal the book to the
[1:13:23] book because this this is a public
[1:13:27] Affair this is a in the tent moment this
[1:13:31] is a time where you the this is a time
[1:13:35] where the second part of the book is not
[1:13:38] revealed to the world it's not a public
[1:13:41] Affair it's not a public message it's a
[1:13:44] private
[1:13:46] message it's a private
[1:13:51] revealing because there's only one
[1:13:55] who will know the contents of the
[1:14:00] book and that is
[1:14:05] her when when Jesus Took the book as we
[1:14:08] saw this morning in Luke chapter 4 he he
[1:14:11] he revealed himself to be the
[1:14:17] book he revealed himself to be the book
[1:14:22] but now the groom is on the scene
[1:14:27] and he has taken possession of a part of
[1:14:31] himself and he's revealing himself to be
[1:14:34] that
[1:14:36] part to that
[1:14:39] part he's revealing himself to be that
[1:14:43] part to that part as Adam
[1:14:47] revealed himself to be that
[1:14:51] part this is bone of my bone and Flesh
[1:14:54] of My flesh he revealed
[1:14:57] himself to be that
[1:15:00] part but in order for the the part of
[1:15:03] Adam to know who she was Adam had to be
[1:15:07] there that's
[1:15:09] right right in order for the part of of
[1:15:12] Adam to know who she was he had to be
[1:15:17] there see the the purpose of the
[1:15:19] unveiling of the seals or the removing
[1:15:22] of the seals is not to give you
[1:15:24] information
[1:15:27] no if we're only getting information
[1:15:29] then we we're we're missing a portion of
[1:15:32] it we we're missing the true picture
[1:15:35] because the unveiling of the
[1:15:37] seals is
[1:15:40] testifying of who's
[1:15:44] here that's
[1:15:47] right that is why if you are becoming a
[1:15:51] [Applause]
[1:15:53] revelation unto
[1:15:56] yourself who's doing
[1:15:59] it
[1:16:02] amen because we are living in the time
[1:16:04] where the lamb has come to take
[1:16:07] possession of what is rightfully his
[1:16:11] amen what he paid for he is now taking
[1:16:15] possession of and what he is taking
[1:16:17] possession of he is
[1:16:21] unveiling to her that's right thank you
[1:16:24] Lord he is unveiling her to her
[1:16:29] yes right it's impossible for her to
[1:16:33] know who she is unless he comes on the
[1:16:37] scene but as a result of him coming on
[1:16:40] the scene she is being revealed to
[1:16:52] herself this is why this picture is so
[1:16:55] important even though it's a little bit
[1:16:57] wrong it's so
[1:17:02] important
[1:17:04] but in the
[1:17:06] book in your Bible the Seven Seals are
[1:17:09] written in symbol form but they're not
[1:17:13] symbols
[1:17:16] anymore they're are
[1:17:18] reality they're actually are
[1:17:21] reality in 1 Peter 1:3 it says blessed
[1:17:24] be the Lord God of your father Lord
[1:17:26] Jesus Christ which according to His
[1:17:29] abundant Mercy which hath begotten us
[1:17:31] again in unto a lively Hope by the
[1:17:34] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[1:17:36] dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[1:17:39] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[1:17:42] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[1:17:45] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:17:50] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:17:53] last time amen amen ready to be revealed
[1:17:57] in the last time we are kept by the
[1:18:01] power of God ready to be revealed in the
[1:18:04] last time this book was kept by the
[1:18:07] power of God the prophet would say God
[1:18:10] does God is a spirit God doesn't have
[1:18:12] hands so what is the right hand of him
[1:18:15] that sat upon the throne the hand of God
[1:18:18] is power and
[1:18:20] authority so this book was kept by the
[1:18:23] power and authority ity of God we are
[1:18:26] kept by the power of God what ready to
[1:18:30] be revealed at the end time thank you
[1:18:33] Lord glory to God Amen God is God is
[1:18:38] amazing amen God is so
[1:18:41] good so the the the lamb comes forth to
[1:18:44] reveal a part of himself no no man knew
[1:18:47] it only the lamb amen amen think about
[1:18:52] this when John by the Holy Ghost
[1:18:53] revealed the lamb
[1:18:55] you was in
[1:18:56] him but you were not
[1:19:00] known so there was a portion of him that
[1:19:04] wasn't written
[1:19:08] yet the Old Testament was
[1:19:13] written but there was a portion of him
[1:19:16] that
[1:19:20] wasn't but now the portion that wasn't
[1:19:23] written becomes spoken and when then
[1:19:26] that which is spoken becomes written and
[1:19:28] then that which is written becomes
[1:19:30] manifested and then that which is
[1:19:32] manifested becomes
[1:19:37] revealed so the groom takes a part of
[1:19:41] the Masterpiece a part of himself and
[1:19:44] reveals her to be a part of of himself
[1:19:50] amen it it represents this book is is
[1:19:54] more than a book it represents the New
[1:19:56] Testament

[1:21:59] lamb took the book because only the lamb
[1:22:02] could take the book this whole picture
[1:22:05] speaks of
[1:22:08] Revelation it speaks of
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:11] Revelation the the the
[1:22:15] hand the hand the Lamb on the left the
[1:22:19] Lambs on the
[1:22:21] left was a revelation
[1:22:25] to his
[1:22:27] father the father was a revelation to
[1:22:30] the

[1:22:45] speaks of
[1:22:47] relationship that's what the message is
[1:22:50] about it's about relationship it's
[1:22:53] unfortunate in our immature in the
[1:22:54] message that we've made at other things
[1:22:56] but now we're seeing what it what it
[1:22:58] really is it's just speaking about
[1:23:01] relationship the Bible is about
[1:23:03] relationship the prophet would say it's
[1:23:05] a love letter it's about relationship
[1:23:09] it's it's not about um legalism or you
[1:23:12] do this and I do that it's about
[1:23:14] relationship it's about re a reunion
[1:23:17] it's about Redemption it's about God
[1:23:20] redeeming that part of himself back unto
[1:23:23] himself cuz that's what's Happening Here
[1:23:26] the the the the lamb was coming forward
[1:23:28] to redeem a part of
[1:23:31] himself the part of himself that was
[1:23:33] lost he was coming forward to redeem
[1:23:36] that part and bring it back unto himself
[1:23:39] and reveal it unto
[1:23:42] her amen amen so so the the lamb takes
[1:23:47] possession of the book and this is why
[1:23:50] this bride she is not
[1:23:53] self-identified that's right
[1:23:56] she's not
[1:24:01] self-revealed she's revealed by her
[1:24:09] groom I I I don't know I just can't
[1:24:12] stress
[1:24:14] enough if the book could
[1:24:19] speak in the process of the Seven Seals
[1:24:22] being unveiled
[1:24:25] the book would say the lamb is revealing
[1:24:28] me the lamb is revealing me the lamb is
[1:24:32] revealing me the lamb is revealing me
[1:24:36] with every seal that was taken off it
[1:24:38] was there was a further unveiling a
[1:24:39] further unveiling a further unveiling of
[1:24:42] the same
[1:24:44] book so it's not just a oneof revelation
[1:24:47] it's something that continues to flow in
[1:24:49] our lives it's it's it's an unveiling
[1:24:52] after an unveiling after after an
[1:24:54] unveiling you are bone of my bone and
[1:24:58] and brother Ram said and means a
[1:25:00] conjunction of time and Flesh of My
[1:25:03] Flesh it was a continual unveiling it
[1:25:07] wasn't just a Wham unveiling it was a
[1:25:11] continually in a continual unveiling and
[1:25:14] that is what God is doing for the groom
[1:25:17] he is removing the seals from her
[1:25:21] life amen
[1:25:25] the
[1:25:26] lamb begins to
[1:25:30] speak concerning
[1:25:38] her
[1:25:40] Adam begins to
[1:25:44] speak concerning
[1:25:49] her yes
[1:25:51] Ela yes
[1:25:54] was
[1:25:56] speaking concerning her on Rebecca's
[1:26:00] journey to
[1:26:02] Isaac yeah that's right but
[1:26:05] now amen
[1:26:08] Isaac takes the
[1:26:12] place of
[1:26:14] eler because eler can only take her so
[1:26:19] far so now Isaac steps forward that's
[1:26:23] right amen and takes the place of
[1:26:28] elizer and Isaac says I'll take it from
[1:26:35] here right I'll take it from here you
[1:26:38] you you've done all that you can do well
[1:26:41] done my faithful servant glor amen so
[1:26:46] Isaac steps forward and and takes
[1:26:49] Rebecca by the
[1:26:53] hand I I I don't believe Isaac was in
[1:26:56] the tent and you hear Isaac from
[1:26:59] in that's right in here
[1:27:04] woman oh they
[1:27:07] met they met in the
[1:27:10] field they met in the field and Isaac
[1:27:15] takes H and Isaac says eler I'll I'll
[1:27:19] take it from here but the the the rest
[1:27:22] of what needs to be done I've got to
[1:27:25] do I've got to do it from here on
[1:27:29] Amen and El says Ela didn't argue right
[1:27:34] El said yeah I I I I know Lord I know I
[1:27:38] I I know it's the the son of man
[1:27:41] Ministry has to return amen the son of
[1:27:43] man Ministry has to return and now
[1:27:46] through that son of man Ministry you
[1:27:48] you've got to take it from here you've
[1:27:50] got to take her into the tent you've got
[1:27:52] to remove the seals from her life now
[1:27:55] now it's you and her that's amen so
[1:28:00] where are we living that's right where
[1:28:03] are we
[1:28:05] at there is a man who can turn on the
[1:28:09] light the the the Lord Jesus Christ it
[1:28:13] doesn't mean we do away with the
[1:28:15] message no the man has done his job the
[1:28:18] man has fulfilled his purpose but now
[1:28:21] the message is going to be completed
[1:28:23] through Ela sorry through
[1:28:28] Isaac because El Ela testified of what
[1:28:33] Isaac's going to
[1:28:36] do the prophet would say when when
[1:28:39] Rebecca was coming down and and she
[1:28:42] looked a far off and and she said who is
[1:28:46] that in the field and El is who would
[1:28:50] say well that's my master
[1:28:55] that's your
[1:28:56] groom so there was an
[1:29:00] introduction the Forerunner introduced
[1:29:03] Rebecca to
[1:29:04] Isaac who was coming to meet her in the
[1:29:08] field that's right amen but the that's
[1:29:12] not where the message
[1:29:13] stopped Hallelujah no because Ela had
[1:29:17] already testified to Rebecca what
[1:29:20] Isaac's going to do because Ela had the
[1:29:23] mind of Christ yeah Ela had the mind of
[1:29:26] Isaac so Ela knew that they were going
[1:29:29] to meet in the field Ela knew that there
[1:29:32] was going to be a tent meeting but he
[1:29:34] wasn't to take her into that tent
[1:29:36] meeting but he he knew that it was going
[1:29:39] to happen so he had already spoken those
[1:29:41] things to
[1:29:42] eler sorry to Rebecca eler had spoken
[1:29:46] those things to Rebecca but now it was
[1:29:49] coming the
[1:29:51] Fulfillment of what El had spoken but
[1:29:55] Ela now was off the
[1:30:02] scene praise the
[1:30:06] Lord so we're living in that
[1:30:11] time where
[1:30:13] Isaac is on the
[1:30:17] scene to
[1:30:20] fulfill the rest of the message
[1:30:24] yes yes
[1:30:27] yes the prophet eleazer said to you he
[1:30:32] said the Lord's going to meet you in
[1:30:37] there if you read it how a bride can
[1:30:41] read how her husband
[1:30:45] writes that's what you
[1:30:47] read cuz you're reading in between the
[1:30:50] lines and I know that doesn't give us
[1:30:51] poetic license to say whatever we say
[1:30:53] whatever we want but we can see it in
[1:30:55] the
[1:30:56] word
[1:30:59] because elizer had spoken to Rebecca and
[1:31:02] said what's going to happen is is the
[1:31:05] Lord has revealed to me that Isaac's
[1:31:07] going to come and he's going to take
[1:31:09] you and he's going to meet you he's
[1:31:12] going to take you into that little
[1:31:17] tent so the the Fulfillment of the
[1:31:21] message
[1:31:24] it can only be fulfilled by
[1:31:29] one there's only one
[1:31:34] worthy eler wasn't
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:37] worthy or
[1:31:40] able it took someone greater than
[1:31:47] eler is that
[1:31:49] right it took him who sent
[1:31:57] Ela to come on the
[1:32:01] scene and
[1:32:03] fulfill his portion yes of the
[1:32:08] word as the
[1:32:11] person of the word now being on Earth
[1:32:16] the groom now being on Earth taking his
[1:32:19] bride by the
[1:32:21] hand and leading leading her into a
[1:32:26] union and in that Union the seals become
[1:32:31] removed off her
[1:32:35] life and as a result of the
[1:32:38] seals becoming removed of her
[1:32:42] life there is a life that is
[1:32:47] produced through
[1:32:49] her that is his very life
[1:32:54] yes in
[1:32:59] her it's the same with Ruth and
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:05] Boaz there was a life
[1:33:10] produced as a
[1:33:13] result of a seal being
[1:33:15] broken
[1:33:20] yes that life was not her life
[1:33:26] life it was his
[1:33:30] life in
[1:33:34] her but how can his
[1:33:38] life become the preeminent life within
[1:33:42] her without there being a
[1:33:48] union the Lamb's got to come and take
[1:33:51] the
[1:33:52] book The Lambs got to come and Unite
[1:33:56] with the his
[1:33:58] bride and break the seal and reveal the
[1:34:04] contents reveal the
[1:34:07] Masterpiece reveal that she is as the
[1:34:11] prophet would say Spirit of my spirit
[1:34:14] word of my word life of my
[1:34:21] life but the prophet can't do do
[1:34:27] that the prophet can't reveal you to
[1:34:33] you the prophet's
[1:34:36] Duty was to introduce
[1:34:39] you to the
[1:34:42] groom
[1:34:44] Hallelujah and as a result of the the
[1:34:49] the the
[1:34:52] introductions you are are become you are
[1:34:55] becoming known to
[1:35:04] yourself but when you are becoming known
[1:35:07] to
[1:35:08] yourself who does it testify is here
[1:35:12] that's right that's
[1:35:16] right there's only
[1:35:20] one there's only one who can reveal you
[1:35:26] to
[1:35:27] you amen there's only one that can make
[1:35:34] cause you to make the transition from
[1:35:37] being a mystery to a mystery
[1:35:43] revealed there was only one who could
[1:35:46] take the book which was a mystery and
[1:35:49] caus it to become a mystery revealed
[1:35:56] but who does it testify
[1:36:02] of we can say that the book is
[1:36:06] open we can say that the seals are
[1:36:08] broken and the the the the contents are
[1:36:11] revealed but really what God wants us to
[1:36:15] see is who did
[1:36:18] it amen because we can preach about the
[1:36:22] open book and we can preach about the
[1:36:25] seals being loosed but but if we don't
[1:36:28] preach about the one who opened
[1:36:31] it then what's the point of preaching
[1:36:35] about the open book because the open
[1:36:38] book testifies that someone opened
[1:36:43] it when the mystery becomes a mystery
[1:36:47] revealed it testifies that someone
[1:36:50] revealed the mystery
[1:36:54] amen you were a
[1:36:59] mystery but now you're becoming a
[1:37:03] mystery
[1:37:05] revealed or sure you're a mystery
[1:37:07] revealed but you're becoming a mystery
[1:37:10] revealed because you don't know you to
[1:37:12] the fullest yet you know you right you
[1:37:16] know you but you don't know you to the
[1:37:18] fullest yet so you need to in in as a
[1:37:21] result of staying in Union with him what
[1:37:24] you're going to become is you're going
[1:37:25] to continue to unfold to
[1:37:30] yourself but the
[1:37:34] unfolding
[1:37:36] testifies of the
[1:37:39] one who could unfold
[1:37:46] you I don't know you can call me crazy
[1:37:49] you can I'm I'm repeating myself a lot
[1:37:51] but this is where God has bought me yes
[1:37:54] this is this is where God wants me to
[1:37:58] focus there is a
[1:38:01] man who can turn on the
[1:38:04] light the mystery is being
[1:38:08] revealed amen who's revealing
[1:38:17] it your
[1:38:19] groom your husband your lord
[1:38:23] your
[1:38:25] Redeemer your
[1:38:28] savior your
[1:38:33] Masterpiece it testifies of him
[1:38:48] amen what
[1:38:51] Eve what Adam's bride
[1:38:55] should have
[1:38:59] done when the serpent begin to beguile
[1:39:05] her she should have gone back to her
[1:39:13] Masterpiece because no one else was
[1:39:20] worthy no one else was
[1:39:27] able but the serpent deceived Eve into
[1:39:32] thinking that he had the
[1:39:35] ability to become
[1:39:38] something
[1:39:40] more than what she
[1:39:45] was there's
[1:39:48] one there's one who's worthy there's one
[1:39:52] who is
[1:39:56] there's there's there's no
[1:39:59] denominational
[1:40:01] program or
[1:40:04] system that can reveal you to
[1:40:10] you there's only
[1:40:15] one this is why Rebecca had to stay in
[1:40:20] contact with
[1:40:21] Sarah Ruth had toay stay in contact with
[1:40:25] Boaz Esther had to stay in contact with
[1:40:28] king of
[1:40:29] hazus her king that's right that's right
[1:40:33] because he was the only one worthy he
[1:40:37] was the only one who was
[1:40:41] able so in our
[1:40:44] time in of
[1:40:47] Temptation when Satan comes to try and
[1:40:51] deceive the second Adam's
[1:40:56] wife we know where to
[1:40:59] go we know what game he's
[1:41:03] playing oh but brother it doesn't matter
[1:41:06] what church I go to long as I go to
[1:41:10] church well I agree it doesn't matter
[1:41:14] what church you go
[1:41:16] to as long as that church is preaching
[1:41:20] from an open book
[1:41:23] and what I mean by that is is that it's
[1:41:26] not the man in the Pulpit revealing the
[1:41:29] mystery in the
[1:41:33] Pew that's right good that's good
[1:41:36] because there's
[1:41:39] one and if you are sitting here now
[1:41:44] becoming a revelation unto
[1:41:49] yourself who does it
[1:41:51] testify of who is
[1:41:56] present
[1:42:02] amen it
[1:42:04] testifies the only one who is worthy and
[1:42:07] the only one who is able to unveil you
[1:42:09] is present in your
[1:42:12] life we we want to look for
[1:42:15] evidences we want we want to see super

[1:42:26] Supernatural than the unveiling of the
[1:42:29] word there is nothing more Supernatural
[1:42:33] than the unveiling of the word there is
[1:42:36] nothing more Supernatural than God
[1:42:38] taking this book and revealing the
[1:42:41] contents of this
[1:42:43] book it is more Supernatural than the
[1:42:46] dead being
[1:42:48] raised it's more Supernatural than the
[1:42:51] lame walking that's right it's more
[1:42:53] Supernatural than the the the deaf
[1:42:55] receiving their sight that's true the
[1:42:58] most Supernatural event on this Earth is
[1:43:01] the revealing of the word the revealing
[1:43:05] of the word as a

[1:44:16] going to happen in this church is there
[1:44:20] won't be a person that comes through
[1:44:21] that door and comes to Fellowship in
[1:44:23] this church without knowing who she is
[1:44:26] the the whole Fellowship is going to

[1:45:32] reminding of who we
[1:45:35] are sometimes she needs to hear it
[1:45:41] again
[1:45:43] sometimes in hearing hearing it again it
[1:45:46] sinks
[1:45:47] deeper it goes further it becomes more
[1:45:50] of a reality it drops
[1:45:53] into the
[1:45:54] heart but the the the thing that I that
[1:45:58] the thing that God is pressing upon my
[1:46:01] heart over these past couple of weeks is
[1:46:04] who is
[1:46:07] it who is it that is
[1:46:10] present who is it that is turning on the
[1:46:15] light amen I it's it's him I know it's
[1:46:20] him it's him because no one no one else
[1:46:23] was worthy and no one else was able amen
[1:46:28] let me just see where I'm going here we
[1:46:31] looked at this uh on on um uh yesterday
[1:46:34] a little bit and as a as a a a daughter
[1:46:39] a son and a father because this now has
[1:46:44] become
[1:46:49] flesh this is in our homes
[1:46:54] I have a
[1:46:55] daughter and she's in my
[1:47:04] hand she's in my hand it's about
[1:47:14] relationship this the son the the the
[1:47:17] the potential the boyfriend the is just
[1:47:20] the potential
[1:47:23] but they need to be a
[1:47:26] revelation to one
[1:47:30] another I I just I just feeling to say
[1:47:33] this tonight
[1:47:36] that it's not the it's it's the man it's
[1:47:39] the father of your if you're a father
[1:47:42] it's you not your
[1:47:45] wife who brings your children to
[1:47:48] maturity
[1:47:53] the lamb was not a mama's
[1:47:58] boy why because he had a relationship
[1:48:01] with his
[1:48:03] father a mama's boy ain't ready for
[1:48:07] marriage but reason a mama's boy is a
[1:48:10] mama's boy is because the boy has a
[1:48:12] relationship with Mama and not a
[1:48:14] relationship with Father yeah true yes
[1:48:17] the boy needs to become a father's
[1:48:20] boy because it's only the father that
[1:48:23] can bring the son to
[1:48:26] maturity it's only the father that can
[1:48:30] bring the his daughter to
[1:48:36] maturity this is why it's important for
[1:48:39] you as a
[1:48:42] father as the father of your children to
[1:48:46] instill
[1:48:48] value in your children
[1:48:53] for
[1:48:54] example if your
[1:48:57] children have a value of a
[1:49:01] dollar then thou will seek a groom that
[1:49:05] has the value of a
[1:49:09] dollar because the the the lamb and the
[1:49:13] bride are the same
[1:49:16] value the same
[1:49:19] word they are of the same value
[1:49:23] J this is why I don't understand how men
[1:49:25] treat their wives there's a revelation
[1:49:29] missing the way that you treat your wife
[1:49:32] you you really you can put yourself up
[1:49:34] on a pedestal you can put yourself up in
[1:49:37] a higher place than what your wife is
[1:49:40] but really the way you've put her is
[1:49:43] where you
[1:49:45] are amen
[1:49:48] Lord your wife is not of lesser value
[1:49:52] than
[1:49:55] you and the groom is not of more value
[1:49:58] than the
[1:49:59] bride they are the same
[1:50:03] value so when you give your children
[1:50:07] word
[1:50:11] value then what a groom is going to
[1:50:15] seek is someone who has the same
[1:50:19] value that he has he's looking for
[1:50:23] someone like himself he's looking for
[1:50:26] someone who has the same vision that he
[1:50:28] has if if he has a vision of the word
[1:50:31] then he is looking for a bride who has
[1:50:34] that same potential has that same vision
[1:50:37] has that same
[1:50:41] value this is why it's
[1:50:44] important that men young men have older
[1:50:49] men around them a some son needs a
[1:50:53] father but if a a young man doesn't have
[1:50:55] a father within the within the message
[1:50:58] or he's not in a place to bring him to
[1:51:01] manhood then someone adopt
[1:51:04] him I don't mean that literally but
[1:51:07] someone take him under your their
[1:51:09] wing may may an elder in the church take
[1:51:13] him under their
[1:51:14] wing and bring him the
[1:51:18] manhood it's the same as a as the church
[1:51:21] the church can't help anyone no that's
[1:51:23] not right the church can't redeem
[1:51:25] anyone the church can't bring anyone to
[1:51:29] maturity you know that the church is the
[1:51:32] woman but you know what the church does
[1:51:34] when someone gets in trouble I'll come
[1:51:36] here
[1:51:37] sweetheart how much do you
[1:51:40] need we baby them we mother them because
[1:51:44] that's what the church is the church is
[1:51:46] a
[1:51:47] mother but sometimes we've got to let
[1:51:49] them
[1:51:51] go because the only one that can bring a
[1:51:54] a a a son and daughter to maturity is
[1:51:59] Christ so sometimes we as a church we
[1:52:02] have to step
[1:52:04] back and we can't just uh meet
[1:52:08] everyone's needs when there's a whimper
[1:52:10] in the
[1:52:12] congregation and sometimes in a home mom
[1:52:15] you've got to step
[1:52:18] back but father you've got to rise up
[1:52:23] there's no point the mom stepping back
[1:52:25] and there's no one to take her
[1:52:30] place the a lot of the time the reason
[1:52:33] that the mother doesn't step back is cuz
[1:52:35] she knows there's no one to take the
[1:52:38] place but when she
[1:52:41] knows that that that that her husband is
[1:52:44] in a
[1:52:45] position to take her place cuz the
[1:52:48] transition has to be made from
[1:52:50] motherhood to fatherhood the children
[1:52:52] children must make that
[1:52:55] transition that's why the book was in
[1:52:57] the right hand of
[1:53:02] him the book
[1:53:05] kept the book was kept by
[1:53:08] him not
[1:53:11] her
[1:53:14] him this is why your
[1:53:18] relationship with your children should
[1:53:21] be at this level
[1:53:28] because the father is not going to give
[1:53:31] his daughter to
[1:53:37] anyone the father was not going to give
[1:53:39] this book to
[1:53:45] anyone this is why I
[1:53:49] believe that the the group room of the
[1:53:53] Bride becomes a revelation to the
[1:54:08] Father the groom the the groom the
[1:54:12] potential
[1:54:14] groom of the
[1:54:17] book becomes a
[1:54:20] revelation to the father of the
[1:54:31] book this is
[1:54:33] why the the
[1:54:35] daughter and the father need to work
[1:54:42] together because the daughter's Vision
[1:54:45] can become
[1:54:48] clouded so she needs needs to rely on
[1:54:51] someone who whose vision is not
[1:54:54] clouded who can think straight see
[1:54:57] straight and you know she he's she she
[1:55:00] she's not she's
[1:55:02] not she you know you know how it is when
[1:55:04] you fall in
[1:55:07] love you don't think
[1:55:10] straight you don't see Right Things
[1:55:13] become
[1:55:15] clouded but through the
[1:55:18] relationship of the daughter and the
[1:55:20] father
[1:55:22] the daughter should be able to go to the
[1:55:24] father and say Daddy what do you
[1:55:30] think and then the daddy should Daddy
[1:55:33] would well I'm I'm not sure
[1:55:37] yet oh that okay that's that's
[1:55:43] okay God will reveal it in due
[1:55:47] time there's got to be that relationship
[1:55:53] and that's what Satan doesn't
[1:55:56] want if you look at this picture here
[1:55:59] Satan was trying to get the book out of
[1:56:02] the hand of God because he wanted
[1:56:05] possession of
[1:56:06] it but because God cannot fail and
[1:56:10] because the the book was now in the in
[1:56:12] the rightful owner the original owner of
[1:56:15] of the book and etc etc now there was a
[1:56:19] there was a relationship
[1:56:23] it's not
[1:56:27] forceful the
[1:56:29] daughter and her father were a
[1:56:32] revelation to one
[1:56:35] another and because they were a
[1:56:38] revelation to one another the the the I
[1:56:41] don't know what these pages are but the
[1:56:43] the the the father could hold the book
[1:56:46] in not a forceful
[1:56:49] way it was a tender hand of
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:54] the
[1:56:54] Father the father wasn't
[1:56:57] afraid therefore he didn't need to
[1:56:59] squeeze the book is this bit of paper
[1:57:03] important he didn't he didn't need to
[1:57:05] squeeze the
[1:57:06] book it wasn't a forceful
[1:57:10] grip it was about
[1:57:12] relationship it it was it was it was
[1:57:15] there was a relationship there so it
[1:57:17] it's important that the father knows his
[1:57:20] position it's important that the
[1:57:22] children understand the father's
[1:57:24] position in their
[1:57:30] lives because you own there's only one
[1:57:34] for
[1:57:37] you there's not
[1:57:40] many the the world sleeps
[1:57:44] around but the bride
[1:57:47] doesn't this is a sacred
[1:57:50] book she understands her
[1:57:55] sacredness she understands how to
[1:58:00] dress she understands that God has given
[1:58:03] her a sacred
[1:58:08] trust she understands who she
[1:58:12] is she understands that there's only one
[1:58:16] worthy she understands there's only one
[1:58:19] able
[1:58:24] and you you understand what those two
[1:58:26] things
[1:58:27] mean worthy means he's overcome
[1:58:30] himself he's prevailed over his own
[1:58:34] will and taken on the will of the Lord
[1:58:38] Jesus Christ he surrendered his own will
[1:58:42] like Jesus had to
[1:58:44] yeah what makes him able they're a part
[1:58:48] of one another
[1:58:53] because these two
[1:58:55] things are the they're the
[1:58:57] same this is the groom and this is the
[1:59:01] bride this can reveal this is able to
[1:59:04] reveal the contents of
[1:59:07] this because they're the
[1:59:12] same this is why don't don't get married
[1:59:15] don't don't just fall for the first guy
[1:59:18] that comes
[1:59:20] along make sure he's
[1:59:25] able I'm not saying that there's there's
[1:59:28] he he could be a first class
[1:59:31] man but just because he's a first class
[1:59:34] man doesn't mean he's worthy or
[1:59:37] able you've got to be a revelation to
[1:59:40] one
[1:59:44] another like this like we are a
[1:59:48] revelation to one
[1:59:49] another the groom and the bride are
[1:59:52] Revelation to one another as I
[1:59:54] close the prophet of God says in the
[1:59:56] rising of the sun we read this this
[1:59:58] morning but remember he went there with
[2:00:00] you in him see God had never separated
[2:00:02] the bride from the groom yet so when God
[2:00:04] looked down upon the body of Christ he
[2:00:06] saw both male and female it was all
[2:00:09] redeemed in that one body see they are
[2:00:12] same same same word the same word spoke
[2:00:16] of the groom speaks of the Bride amen
[2:00:22] well now well how can the Bride
[2:00:26] come and fail to manifest everything was
[2:00:30] promised of
[2:00:33] him and the groom
[2:00:36] come and he wouldn't be the
[2:00:46] bride but when he did
[2:00:49] everything even to prove it by raising
[2:00:53] himself from the dead
[2:00:55] afterwards then don't the bride have to
[2:00:58] do the same
[2:01:00] thing have to be exactly what the word
[2:01:03] said she would be in the last
[2:01:07] days don't she have to return through
[2:01:10] Malachi
[2:01:12] 4 don't she have to manifest like it was
[2:01:16] in the days of
[2:01:20] Sodom don't the world have to be just
[2:01:24] exactly like it
[2:01:25] is isn't these things a perfect
[2:01:29] identification of the word of God made
[2:01:32] known to
[2:01:37] us isn't these things a perfect
[2:01:40] identification of the word made known to
[2:01:45] us
[2:01:48] yeah is the word made known
[2:01:54] is the
[2:01:55] Masterpiece the Masterpiece has become
[2:02:00] manifested and now the manifested
[2:02:04] Masterpiece is now made
[2:02:08] known unto
[2:02:14] herself this is why the prophet in the
[2:02:16] Rapture message he preached from Psalm
[2:02:19] 27
[2:02:22] yeah yes
[2:02:24] right because it
[2:02:27] shows the
[2:02:29] condition that the bride will be in at
[2:02:33] the time of the Rapture amen and if
[2:02:37] we're not in the time of the Rapture I
[2:02:40] don't know where we
[2:02:43] are but the Masterpiece is being
[2:02:50] revealed the the revelation of who you
[2:02:53] are will become so strong in your life
[2:02:58] that gravity won't hold you
[2:03:03] here the
[2:03:05] unveiling of the
[2:03:07] Bride will be such a powerful
[2:03:12] event that
[2:03:15] it nothing will keep us
[2:03:19] here not even the natural laws of this
[2:03:25] earth like gravity is going to keep the
[2:03:28] bride
[2:03:30] bound why because she's
[2:03:34] Rising by
[2:03:37] Revelation amen there's a
[2:03:39] bride rising
[2:03:42] up amen there's a bride rising up yes in
[2:03:47] the strength of the
[2:03:50] revelation of
[2:03:54] herself you know Adam gave Eve what she
[2:03:59] needed to defeat the
[2:04:03] serpent but you know what Eve didn't
[2:04:06] do she didn't go back to what Adam
[2:04:13] said but
[2:04:15] this end time
[2:04:18] bride will not
[2:04:20] fall for the same
[2:04:24] deception that Adam's bride fell to
[2:04:28] that's
[2:04:29] right not because of
[2:04:33] you but because of what God is doing for
[2:04:38] you if it wasn't for God you would be
[2:04:44] deceived but because of God you are not
[2:04:49] deceived you can stand in the strength
[2:04:54] of the revelation of who you are and you
[2:04:58] can say what Jesus
[2:05:01] said it is
[2:05:04] written right he
[2:05:06] quoted the
[2:05:09] word right he quoted from where from the
[2:05:13] word which he
[2:05:16] was he didn't just quote the
[2:05:20] word he SP spoke to the
[2:05:23] serpent through the revelation of who he
[2:05:29] was because he
[2:05:31] was that
[2:05:34] word so now when Satan comes to tempt
[2:05:38] the Masterpiece
[2:05:41] bride what is she going to
[2:05:45] quote because if all you do is quote it
[2:05:49] won't work
[2:05:53] but you've got to quote the word you've
[2:05:55] got to speak the word is probably a
[2:05:57] better way to to quote the word you
[2:06:00] don't need a revelation of it but when
[2:06:02] to you speak the word you're speaking
[2:06:04] the word in the power of that word or in
[2:06:08] the revelation of that word and when you
[2:06:11] speak the word you're speaking who you
[2:06:15] are amen the word Can't Fail
[2:06:19] amen the word didn't fail the original
[2:06:24] Masterpiece and the word will not fail
[2:06:27] this the the bride's
[2:06:29] Masterpiece amen but she can pick up the
[2:06:32] book and say it is written yes that I am
[2:06:39] perfect you can't make me any more than
[2:06:44] what I
[2:06:46] am because I am finished
[2:06:52] the devil wants to come to you and say
[2:06:54] well if you if you do this this and this
[2:06:56] you'll be a greater Masterpiece than
[2:06:58] what you are
[2:06:59] rubbish it's a
[2:07:01] lie I am
[2:07:04] finished I am the
[2:07:07] Masterpiece I am a part of the I
[2:07:10] am Hallelujah I am a part of the godhead
[2:07:15] bod
[2:07:18] am I am
[2:07:21] oh
[2:07:22] beautiful in the strength what are you
[2:07:25] doing you're you're you're you're
[2:07:27] quoting from the word it is
[2:07:30] written I am complete it is written I am
[2:07:35] perfect in Christ it is written I am a
[2:07:38] part of the godhead bodily it is written
[2:07:41] I have been kept by the power of God but
[2:07:44] now I am
[2:07:49] revealed amen
[2:07:52] who makes it possible for you to speak
[2:07:56] like
[2:08:02] that when when my wife married me I gave
[2:08:05] her a new
[2:08:09] language I gave her a language that she
[2:08:12] couldn't speak until I took her and made
[2:08:16] her my own or revealed her to be my own
[2:08:21] I gave her a
[2:08:23] language I made it possible for her to
[2:08:26] speak a language that she once couldn't
[2:08:29] speak right amen and now the book is
[2:08:32] becoming opening open there's a language
[2:08:35] that is coming from the bride's mouth
[2:08:37] that once she couldn't speak yes Lord
[2:08:39] but the question is who made it possible
[2:08:41] for you to speak this way Hallelujah
[2:08:44] Lord
[2:08:47] Jesus who made it possible for the
[2:08:51] prophet Propet to
[2:08:53] speak the revelation of those
[2:08:58] seals it was a
[2:09:02] language it wasn't
[2:09:04] him he didn't go to language
[2:09:09] school but God come
[2:09:12] down and he opened the seals to the
[2:09:15] prophet and now the prophet could speak
[2:09:18] the unwritten
[2:09:20] part or the unspoken
[2:09:24] part because it was only there in symbol
[2:09:29] form so when the prophet begin to reveal
[2:09:32] the first horse
[2:09:34] rider never
[2:09:35] before had one spoken like that man
[2:09:38] that's right never
[2:09:41] before who made it possible that's the
[2:09:46] point it's not while the first horse
[2:09:49] rider wow wow wow wow look he's got a
[2:09:52] bow but he hasn't got an arrow it's
[2:09:56] deception yeah wonderful but who
[2:09:59] revealed
[2:10:01] it who did it who opened
[2:10:07] it who made that possible that language
[2:10:11] possible yes
[2:10:14] true they came a time when my
[2:10:18] wife through a union was able to call
[2:10:23] herself by another name that's
[2:10:27] right that's
[2:10:29] right it's
[2:10:32] not it it we focus
[2:10:36] on what she's doing but that's only a
[2:10:40] portion
[2:10:43] true the real focus is who made it
[2:10:49] possible that's right I just can't
[2:10:52] stress it
[2:10:53] enough who made it
[2:10:57] possible this the sick can be healed the
[2:11:00] lame can be can can walk the the blind
[2:11:03] can see and we praise God and we thank
[2:11:06] God who made it
[2:11:08] possible who did
[2:11:13] it Israel come to the Red Sea and the
[2:11:17] Sea
[2:11:18] opened and they saw a man standing on a
[2:11:21] hill
[2:11:21] with with his staff
[2:11:23] raised and they walk
[2:11:25] through but I don't know how many of
[2:11:28] them stopped to think who did
[2:11:38] it Israel ends up on the back side of
[2:11:41] the desert where there's nothing to eat
[2:11:43] nothing to drink they've run out of
[2:11:44] water and God says to Moses I'll meet
[2:11:47] you at a particular Rock I'll meet you
[2:11:50] at Rock har
[2:11:53] I'll meet you
[2:11:56] there why God was going to bring forth
[2:12:00] water God said to Moses Smite The
[2:12:04] Rock listen Moses didn't open the
[2:12:12] rock there was someone else
[2:12:16] there other than Moses Lord but how many
[2:12:20] Saw
[2:12:22] the one the invisible
[2:12:25] one how many saw the one who actually
[2:12:29] split the Rock and caused water to come
[2:12:34] forth not
[2:12:36] many probably just
[2:12:41] two probably just Caleb and
[2:12:46] Joshua and they drunk from that rock
[2:12:50] they drunk from that rock
[2:12:52] different to how everyone else
[2:12:56] drunk because they knew Mo Moses I mean
[2:12:59] if you've ever seen the rock yes it's
[2:13:02] actually split in two it's there two
[2:13:05] parts and it's just literally come open
[2:13:07] like that that's right it's up on a hill
[2:13:10] and the water ran out of that rock Moses
[2:13:13] didn't split the
[2:13:15] Rock brother Brenham didn't break the
[2:13:18] seals hallah amen someone else was
[2:13:24] there this is why we're feeding from
[2:13:26] that which has been revealed we we're
[2:13:29] drinking from it differently to how
[2:13:31] everyone else is drinking from it
[2:13:33] because we know it wasn't the prophet
[2:13:35] that opened the seals there was someone
[2:13:37] else
[2:13:39] present amen
[2:13:44] hallelujah and now those seals have been
[2:13:47] removed from our lives
[2:13:49] personally true
[2:13:53] and we didn't do

[2:25:31] which is where we're at where the wine
[2:25:33] was going fast Jesus changed that water
[2:25:35] then to the finest one remember the
[2:25:37] seventh seal came and changed the six
[2:25:39] water pots and the governor said you
[2:25:43] saved the best for
[2:25:45] last God's plan has been unfolding just
[2:25:48] a little at a time a light that Shone so
[2:25:50] dim in ages
[2:25:52] past that's the light that we spoke
[2:25:55] about this morning he's revealed his
[2:25:57] fullness now that Mighty Gods unveiled
[2:25:59] we see clearly he saved the best for
[2:26:02] last he saved the best for last is God

[2:27:28] Lord why your Prophet said if he could
[2:27:29] choose what age he would live in he
[2:27:32] would have chosen this time not because
[2:27:35] he wasn't looking at the darkness of L
[2:27:37] DEA he wasn't looking at Satan's Eden in
[2:27:39] full swing he wasn't looking at all the
[2:27:42] mess in the world and how Up Is Down and
[2:27:45] Down is up and good is bad and bad is
[2:27:47] good father he wasn't looking at that he
[2:27:48] was looking at what you were revealing
