father help us Lord to listen to this word father not through our own filters and ideas father but from your perspective oh Lord make it alive inside us this morning we ask it in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we give you all the glory Lord amen amen I mean I wonder if I can ask you to take your seeds just for a moment I won't be long don't want to take a lot of time but there's some of you that I haven't seen yet since I returned from from Australia and I'm gonna say it's lovely to see you it's just a just a real special atmosphere in church this morning and just just thankful to be able to come to come together and worship together and serve the Lord together and and it's true it's lovely to see other parts of the body of Christ amen we we go through our different battles and things and not everyone is at the on a high at the same time sometimes time is on a low and others are on the high praise God that's how he works I mean I believe God always allows some highs and some lows in different places so that we can kind of encourage one another amen um I also I briefly mentioned it on Wednesday night I think but I want to also again say thank you very much to the brothers that's done the work in the in the roof um it's it was actually markedly less less Bowie when I came in the first time yeah of course it's still a little bit Bowie but but this is as good as it's going to get and I'm really thankful I tried the office door and it's still open and closed and things like that so I'm very thankful for that but thank you Brothers for for your effort and and I know I I saw brother Gideon become a structural engineer and do all sorts of drawings and brother Jonathan helped well together all sorts of mechanical structures and things and and so forth so but everyone who helped in any way thank you very much it's really good Sonia God willing the the hopefully the lights will be able to install soon so it's real nice that we'll that we'll be able to do that um apparently I I don't know if that was a joke whether it was real but I think it was real that after the the ceiling was pushed up a little bit the the projector needed adjusting again so that's a good sign so it means means that there's definitely less than less of a bow so thankful for that um I also want to ask um next Saturday um besides the fact that it's Michael's birthday we uh his mum is moving house so I wonder if there's a possibility of of some brothers that that be able to come help um and and move uh sister Louise's things what would work if we aim for nine o'clock is that too early is that two Early Brothers nine o'clock all right okay nine o'clock at sister Louise's current place and then we'll start from there and if you can bring Utes and trailers and things that would be lovely if you if you have that available if you can do that um and yes speaking of birthdays these uh these couple birthdays that's already gone but we mentioned them and I don't think

thankful to the Lord amen I really appreciate our you our brothers and our sisters amen Hallelujah Exodus shop from verse 9 to 18 amen praise the Lord and he says here but the Egyptians are pursued after them all the horses and Chariots of pharaoh and his Horseman and his army and overtook them in camping by the sea beside P.I Harrod before Powers they fall and when Pharaoh Drew Nai the children of Israel lifted up their their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them sure to the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt has now taken us away to die in the wilderness wait for it is forth out of Egypt is it not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may save the Egyptians for it had been better for us to save the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear you not stand still praise the Lord I like that one stand still amen fear ye not stand still amen praise the Lord stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom we have seen today you shall see them again no more forever and he shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wait for Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift thou up thyroid and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and I Behold our heart in the hearts of the and are getting me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his Souls upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I've gotten me honor and upon his Horseman shall we bow our heads once more again our dear heavenly father the word has been read

Lord we know Heavenly Father we've come to church and God comes to church we appreciate you Lord put me aside father and speak to your children we commit everything into your holy hands in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the lord we may be seated and as we are seated and let's read one more scripture take it from a second timoth chapter one verse 7 amen we just read that portion of there yes second Timothy second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7. amen praise the Lord two months amen and I'll read it uh verse 7 and he says here for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen praise the Lord I love that sound mind amen but he has given us the spirit of power Spirit of love and the sound mind amen praise the Lord I'll take her for what will be preaching this morning I will take it from the book of Exodus where we just read and I will take those words stand still amen and see the salvation of Our Lord amen praise the Lord so happy and we're so thankful to the Lord amen for him to bring USA into his house those words were spoken to Moses as we have read the children of Israel received great Deliverance from the bondage in Egypt they had seen all the plagues that have been put on the Egyptians and they were on their way and God himself was leading the children of Israel it was none other than Almighty himself leading his children amen praise the Lord and uh he led them to a place uh uh leading them into a tribe and uh indeed it was a to the natural eye they were writing a trip amen and uh the enemy was behind them and they came to that spot and then they saw the enem pursuing them amen and I think that goes very well with our Christian Life when we get saved we feel happy we are happy and we are moving with the Lord and uh everything is moving fine but at times he leads us into those uh Sports amen way everything seems to be upside down and the enemies are right on your heels and you don't even know what to do so that's when he says stand still praise the Lord that's when he says stand still when things are like that I know it's natural and that we can't play many what it's easy to really uh kind of uh being shaky and uh uh you don't know what to do that's natural but I like it when it comes in yes and he chips in and he says stand still amen and seal the salvation of Our Lord amen I like it when it's uh like that when he comes in and he gives you it's gonna be all right and when we save the Lord Jesus Christ no matter how things are sent to be no matter how the situation is uh looking terrible yours looks like it's out of control there's one thing that just gives us a consolation that everything is gonna be all right amen it can be you might be in a sickness and you might be nigh unto death everything is gonna be all right or it can be sickness and even come you you even die and we bear you everything is gonna be all right because the goodness is when the Lord is just coming and gives you that assurance that smile that crosses on your face and gives you that assurance that it's gonna be all right I've heard many sayings when they come to that point even the great uh Apostle Paul he says for me to live is Christ and for me to die I might have put those words across but you are someone who has a uh not scared of uh dying or not deliver him from there from his uh predicament but he knew either way God is going to be in it and either way he's gonna come out right amen praise the Lord I always wonder I don't I see a mystery to me and I think it is a mystery to you as well we all talk about heaven it's a beautiful place and we all want to go means for us now to cross over to go to heaven comes nobody wants to go home amen but it's a beautiful place I don't understand we are human beings are things that's just the way we are made amen we don't understand this beautiful place here at times we when that call comes that we we are scared and uh we don't want to go home to the extent that I think even the Lord Jesus Christ you post it as well when uh his friend Lazarus died the Lord Jesus Christ you know Lazarus was a righteous man and Lazarus has gone up to to heaven but we find him when he comes he weeps for his friend why was he weeping when his friend has just gone to a beautiful place we don't understand it it's one of those Mysteries there he's going to a good place but you you you're crying and then you have to bring him back amen so we don't understand that some of these things when we are putting uh those are difficult positions and one thing that I would want to say that we are human beings and when you are in those corners uh uh when things are tough and when things are not moving right uh it's no time to feel our self-pity you might find yourself in self-pity but it's not a time to dwell and uh start thinking oh poor me what has happened to me or I'm such a horrible person for these things to happen to me it's not time to think that amen it's time to lift up your eyes unto the Lord and see the salvation of Our Lord amen praise the lord it's time to look up to the Lord Jesus Christ and see what good is going to come out of this praise the Lord because no matter how bad the situation is you are a chosen vessel amen you are a chosen of Jehovah God Amen so no matter whatever situation you are in whatever uh condition you are battling be very assured of this Fear One Thing about everything is gonna be all right everything is gonna work out right and everything eventually things will come out right amen praise the Lord I can put it in this way you will have the last love against the devil for amen praise the Lord amen you will have the last laugh when he thinks that he has really pinned you down and you you you you die you'll be saying farewell I'm going to my beautiful home amen praise the Lord but in saying that though we are not pushovers as Christians and we are not uh whatever people whatever happens whatever doesn't uh just going with the flow we are not pushed over escort children We Stand our grounds and our product balances are any War real war is fought for principles yeah principles yeah yeah principles fight Wars principles Divine Healing is mine so it's mine praise the Lord yes my children they are mine and they are believers in their mind praise the Lord no to whatever uh well let them my children they don't want to save the Lord oh well let them go in that do whatever they want of course you can't go and drag them out of way no you know where we fight on our knees you pray is the Lord you've got the right brother Abraham says we've got uh that right we claim them back our loved ones praise the Lord amen so we are not whatever and Moses when he was faced with that situation he wasn't saying whatever happens no he knew exactly where to go to and he went to the to God himself amen and God said stand still so if your children they are going wayward you go to pray to him talk to him amen you know what brother Branham says there was a sister and the boys were not doing right and she wanted the children back to save the Lord and problem said don't worry you just committed to the Lord committee to the Lord and don't nag them yeah don't make them just be nice to them amen love them amen praise the Lord be a servant to them yeah that's right love them don't neck them and you pray you pray they'll come back they'll come back because it's a promise amen we are not a whatever praise the Lord probably uh husband is picking his bags I'm out of this place you pray yeah there are situations where brother Brahma maida the husband was speaking uh they would come to the prophet and the prophet says Beckham what uh the best cake that he loves amen and they do they are not a whatever people no we are Christians amen and we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ amen we want to be a true ambassadors for this gospel it says and it's despised the way it is today and people make fun of it and he says it's because of poor representation amen but we as Believers amen as Believers we have been called that in these end times praise the Lord and we have been restored back to the original faith we want to put that to a stop we want to live such a life until in this region there when they say when they want to see a living God they will say God Rapture in Christ and they will say you want God go to that place I like what brother brother was you're at one time he was tested kind of talks they're criticizing my Ministry and everything but one thing that they if I it's true it's genuine and that that it's true they have no questions about it they know it's true and they testify and they somehow they think here they are saying I've got a genuine gift and I'm deceived and he says but I don't see where I'm deceived so we want to come to that spot when the world wants to see the Lord Jesus Christ when the world wants to see true Christianity they see it in rupturing Grace amen are they so you see through Christianity Bible Believers amen they see true Christianity in you amen so we say stand still don't give up don't let go at times when that enemies it just comes in and they just one problem after the other around the situation after the other it's very easy to give up very easy saying ah well I call it quits and to go back into the world but we are saying stand still God has not given you a spirit of fear God has given you a spirit of power and the spirit of love and a sound mind sound mind we used to see at times when the when the girls were fighting you know boys at times they were when they fight they really do calculate here but the girls at times when they fight they dug their head and their Jets letting them in the face fly we are not like that we have been given a sober mind amen A sound mind we know exactly what we're doing and we know exactly whom we are worshiping amen praise the lord it's not an imaginary God it's not just a uh like a comforter you know the blanket that you give to the kids when they are distressed and they start sucking no God is not like that is the one who created the universe the great Sun that we saw coming from the East and now that's going towards the West is the one who created it he never makes no mistakes nah it doesn't make mistakes no and he doesn't have a time where he has to say uh well I'm sorry I got it wrong the first time I will get it right this time no it doesn't do that praise the Lord whatever he does it's perfect whatever it does is good is the source of our light is a source of warmth that's right yeah coldness is from the Devil is a source of warmth is a source of light is a source of love he is the ultimate he'll never fail you he will never fail your stand still and see the salvation of the Lord we want to stand still no matter your situation regardless of how bad it is stand still and see his salvation he will come in your situation you'll come and help you out praise the Lord and now uh there are some tricks that we are taught by Malachi for brother pranam taught us those are tricks at times some of some of those things uh they may look very like they are very small or we we really can't put value on them but they're the real things that hold the thing together praise the Lord very small things that you've taught us Malachi for amen so you're staying still and now we're saying when you are now standing still in your position it might be lingering it might be dragging and taking years and uh I don't know how whatever it is just stand still praise the Lord stand still and see the salvation of our Lord and now when you are standing still just understand still there and uh not doing nothing start praising the Lord start reading that spoken word start reading that Bible praise the Lord and don't forget to come and fellowship together that's very important now you come your fellowship together praise the Lord because that's where you get a little bit of a big boost here yes that's where you get a big boss when these children of Israel we are talking about when they came out of Egypt they knew this great God was before them they knew this great God we had really destroyed all Egypt and paralyzed it they knew him and then you hear him when I further down there you open the Red Sea for them and they crossed over yeah and when they came to Mount Sinai I saw him he was thundering on that uh uh Mount Sinai it was on smoke thundering and everything and they were saying my what a great being I wonder if he will go all the way with us and dwell with us in our promised light thought that and probably some way we could have thought it they said we want him to come and dwell amongst us and one day there was great news Moses he went up the mountain and he came down and he says Israel I bring you good news the one who's standing on that mountain the one was producing all those Lightnings and everything he says he want to dwell amongst us and he says we can build him a tabernacle and he will come and dwell amongst us that was good news and Israel says yes we'll do that and they build a tabernacle but you know what the best news of all is in US he never chose to to dwell in a tabernacle but he chose to dwell in our hearts he is right in your heart [Music] you may not feel him he may not understand it but the minute you accepted him amen the minute you received that baptism of the Holy Ghost says that it was like a little size of a pattern something was planted right into your into your heart amen and it's still there amen and you have to water it here for it to grow water it for it to grow praise the Lord and when you come to church praise the Lord you bring your leg of fire they bring a leak of fire together you get the encouragement praise the Lord amen so with those little nuggets that are prophet of Malachi for taught us amen I think we will be restored and I believe we'll go back to that original amen like Pentecost was amen praise the Lord raising the Dead no it's not wishful thinking it's truth raising the Dead the blind seeing praise the Lord they will have to take them from the hospital they say we can't have your situation my friend we can't do medical science can't do anything but I'll tell you one thing if you go in Stratford on Reagan Street there are some people there we don't understand them but they if they pray for you your eyesight will be restored praise the Lord if they pray for you your limbs will be straightened amen that's not wish for thinking amen that's what the Bible talks about as amen and that's what all those things are we have gone on uh they are looking forward for us to do that amen praise the Lord and that's what all the animals there the whole creation is groaning for to see the manifested manifestation of the sons of God Amen the world creation is looking upon us amen praise the Lord and uh that was what what Daniel saw he said that when he saw it he said that uh those who love their God shall do exploits and wonders praise the Lord and we happen to be that group of people amen so we say stand still and see the salvation of the Lord you're sent there you pray amen hold on to him praise the Lord and now we we're talking about now the conditions now you are standing still standing and waiting for him to act there are some things now that you must do praise the Lord reading the Bible and now we're putting their nuggets that brother tells us about here praise the Lord when you are standing still attitude met us a lot your attitude towards these promises made us a lot amen praise the Lord don't give up keep holding on Amen praise the Lord I'll read what the prophet says in expectation that was preaching 50-0405 on paragraph 13. and he says just for a little text if I should call it that I want to speak for a moment or two on the word of expectation and he says we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what you look for and he says it's the mental attitude that you have amen praise the Lord I'll try to die myself saying that I'm Healed and yet I'm dying I would rather die confessing that rather than giving up because I know God doesn't lie amen praise the Lord amen I know he doesn't like amen I would rather die that way than giving up I may not see uh well I may not see all my loved ones my mama my my my uncles and them coming to the Lord but as long as I've put them there I've claimed them they're my sisters as long as I've claimed them they I know they will come I don't want that to fizzle out amen praise the Lord amen says he says it's the mental attitude that we have remember this and never forget it that's problem says remember this and never forget it he says that the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass so just the right mental attitude towards those promises he says or to bring it past amen he says the right mental attitude towards any uh Promises of God and he says it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in here is a right to meet certain anyway if you are a Christian and defeat him on any grounds that he could stand on praise the Lord so even you're washing your dishes you can't defeat the Devil right then praise the Lord you're driving on the road you can then defeat the Devil right there you are working busy at your workplace your defeat him amen praise the Lord and I like it when God at times you know the way he does it at times it's not by power not by mighty but by his spirit he just does it praise the Lord he just does it the situation that has been bothering you for for so long a Time one day you will find and you wake up and you will say oh it's been weeks that pain is gone I won't feel it anymore praise the Lord I want I don't feel that pain anymore and it looks like it's been four four four four weeks now since I last I felt it I like it when it comes at times he he comes in uh quietly and he does the job quietly and he goes and at times some of the the situations you only get to see it way way way way

appetite someone reminds you there when you're hungry if you're running low or few or someone reminds you they your tummy starts up growling so you don't need to worry praise the Lord as long as you have committed it all to the Lord Jesus Christ you take care of it praise the Lord amen amen as long as you have committed to the Lord Jesus Christ you take care of it and start thanking him for the victory praise the Lord what God wants us to do is that we come to him is individuals and when we get to to him now in him you get to realize ah I can't do without my brother I can't do without my sister you actually get to realize that it's a package that's the goodness of God when you are really right into that atmosphere when you really brings you uh into that True Fellowship with him you get to realize you can't do it on your own praise the Lord take it this way we are all born shaped in iniquity and we came into this world speaking lies and Upon Us was hip to all you name it malice jealous anger Envy that was all heaped upon us but the only way to escape those is to be in the Lord Jesus Christ is to be in the Lord Jesus Christ you can't quote it just whitewash it and you say my

see where you are lacking don't compare yourself with anybody go to the Lord Jesus Christ and talk to him that's it that's Christianity talk to him tell him of all your weaknesses no matter how horrible those mistakes might be tell him exactly your weaknesses and now you stand still and see the salvation of God it will produce results he will come amen that's his promise to his bride amen you have that right mental attitude it will bring results praise the Lord and I'll read another quotation here he says yeah it's on principles of Divine Healing praise the Lord how we stand on that word stand on that word read that Bible praise the Lord just commit yourself to that word of God Amen he says here I'm paragraph 51 09 23 amen so whatever your situation is committed to the Lord you want to overcome yourself I like what wanna write I say that I love the Lord Jesus Christ because he helps me to defend myself against myself that's beautiful he helps me to defend myself against myself when the Lord Jesus Christ comes in he helps you to do that and he gives you of his character and that gift from above is perfect very true that gift from above you can't say anything bad about it it's so beautiful brings everything together amen says here on paragraph 51 uh paragraph 41 the message the principles of a Divine Healing amen he says here now the only thing a minister can do would be preach the gospel tell you the truth and you believe it you accept it upon your confession go out say you are well believe you are well it like you are praise the Lord claim your children believe they come back and act like they are praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord yeah if you are at that age of uh uh of marriage we're talking truth here it's natural you feel like there is advancing you uh at least your other must wake up or you still asleep you pray to God you talk to God so that he can open Adam's eyes amen oh that's very true it's very true you pray and eat and believe it and God will bring your Adam that's true praise the Lord that's true amen can I get an amen in tell me yeah praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen now uh he says go out say you are well believe you are well whatever situation you're looking for a job because say you've got a job don't don't worry when some people come and say ah you said you're gonna get this job but now you you still haven't got it or you don't worry about that exercise your faith yeah talks about it he says was it Winston Church where he said that uh you you was being asked and he said how did you win the war he says well with the summer whatever the bombs we tried this one at times we fight at times it doesn't it doesn't explode it doesn't do what it wants but we didn't give up yeah keep on firing still keep on failing keep on firing when you think the Lord there is failed you she always thinking right and the devil is telling you a lot you're behaving something far greater than uh you thought you were gonna have amen so when you think God has failed dear nah nah he doesn't know that that doesn't exist in God sir dictionary it doesn't exist amen it's just getting you something that was beautiful but when you get it you go wow and it will automatically bring praise from you yeah it automatically when it happens it would you want to hold that praise I don't want to shout you automatically just shout it when God does it yes that was a problem with the with the foolish virgins exercise your faith fill up your lamps now yeah fill it up so that when he comes you don't when that wave now is uh moving on on the Christian Realms yeah that's right it's a promise God can't lie when that short quick work now is happening now people things are now happening it's not time for you now to start running to say ah oh how did he do it how were they persistent on their faith exercise your faith now exercise it now so that it grows and grows that are button size uh thing that God is put in your heart so that it grows it grows but we've got a sound mind yeah A sound mind not fanaticism nah sound mind not fanaticism but if what is our mind you know where you're standing amen praise the Lord and pray Abraham says he says you see brother Brahman should I do that before it should I testify before it he says you'll never feel nothing Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it it's by faith not by failing you are not saved by failing why the devil can beat you around every stump in the country saying it's by your feelings and he says I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved so yeah there are times when we really feel we shouted and you really feel it yeah I'm saved but program says don't raise your Hope on that you are not safe because you feel it at times you'll feel like you are the worst Christian ever at times you feel like you are worthless so we don't go by feelings when we are standing still oh no they are doing even worse or they are threatening to do this all or it's gonna be worse oh my children they are going on now it's not by feelings you pray you stand still you're not saved by feelings now you pray and send seal because you will do it not by power no by Mighty but by his Spirit praise the Lord but at times he does it by power here Oh my he comes in just pause the whole things and he lifts you up there you and you are rejoicing and you are screaming and everything but at times he doesn't do that not by mighty not by power but by my spirit stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and he says yeah why the devil can pit you around every stop in the country saying that it's your feelings I'm not saved because I feel like it I'm saved I'm saved because God's word said I'm saved and he says now and listen just a moment the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anyway anytime on any condition praise the Lord yes anyway Anytime Anyplace any condition you've got that right it has been bestowed upon you you can defeat the Devil when you quote the Bible by his stripes I'm held praise the Lord and no matter how that heart is ours is shaking like a now you know if you ever shaken then the avocado that are Stone still in there it's shaking like I don't know just send them say by his stripes I am healed praise the Lord no matter how it looks like how you can't even get a job or in the no matter whatever situation it is the mountain is too high you stand on that word and he says God said it it will happen amen praise the Lord the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anyway anytime on any condition praise the Lord so read it so that you get familiar with those scriptures you win your War like brother Brahma is talking about it when those lawyers they are winning the argument they win it by using the the word amen they win it by using the they'll be quoting the law so when you win that battle against the devil you win it by quoting the scriptures giving back the scriptures amen praise the Lord so those are the little nuggets that we get when we are standing still or whatever situation we are facing in our life you are standing still for the baptism of the Holy Ghost these are the Nuggets amen know that the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anywhere anytime and condition praise the Lord send there and Moses knew that very well yeah at times God when God is at times when he's dealing with us it doesn't sort of like I show us the whole plan right from the beginning right to the end times it's always step by step step by step you finish this one you overcome this one another one is coming you overcome that one another one very tricky will be coming and you overcome this one another one may be a bit simpler now to give you a little bit of rest is coming but it's always we are on our way up what is we go with him amen praise the Lord and he says when Jesus was here on Earth the father was in him God was in I was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and he says we believe that all the fine qualities was of the father was in him but when he met Satan look how he did he brought it in your reach and yours yours and all of you you never use great Powers when the devil was coming and tempting to him no no brother pranam says he brought it to your level he brought it to Summer on very simple terms and that's the principle of God problem says God and we all know it it is so simple and people they stubble over him they jump over him they are looking over for him over there yet he's right here he makes it very simple so that even the littlest one can catch it so that even the the the the the the foolish ones they can catch it he makes it very simple so that's what problem he says here he says the Lord Jesus Christ he gave us that example it was very uh a simple example of how to deal with the Devil he never used his great gift when Satan comes in and said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones to bread he said it is written praise the lord it's always a written you stand on that ground no matter what the devil he might kick he might thrush he might intimidate he might do whatever he wants to do you just say it is written praise the Lord it is written whatever situation it is written and he says men shall not live by bread alone he taken him up on the Pinnacle of the temple Jesus said it is written you took him up on a map on a high mountain showed him the kingdoms of the world said I will give them all to you if you fall down and worship me Jesus said it is written see always it is written the word the word of God is a seed accept it in your heart believe it water it testify of it take it as your own personal need and God will bring it to pass praise the Lord now the enemy we have is not a lazy enemy the devil now or is a good adversary and he knows where to take Advantage amen and he knows where opportunities Rises that one is trained on it it's got more than 6 000 years of dealing with human beings so it's very clever amen so you give him the word that stops him on his tracks no matter who you are or people they look so down upon you just give that devil the word that's what he understands if you show him the token he'll go amen praise the Lord and problems is the word of God is a seed except it in your heart believe it water it testify of it water it come to church yeah come to church don't miss services very true don't miss services for nothing what are it come pray for your pastor that's right you water that word got that word you protect it yes speak right praise the Lord you water that word protect it that's your protection come to church be involved in uh in whatever is happening here with the uh the duties and all that and you come out right so we are saying when you're ascending still you stand still look at that word believe it have the right mental attitude accept it and the Lord will make it come to pass you will make it come to pass and when he makes it come to pass oh you will scream you will scream for joy my wife is someone who is very composed but at times if you come home and uh you see you'll be surprised oh man amen so I'm just waiting one of these days it will spillover praise the Lord yes it will make you shout it will make you praise the Lord it will make you sing to the Lord it will make you testify of the Lord Jesus Christ on the streets praise the Lord when you are sending stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and the book influence paragraph we just prayed 62 1013 paragraph 41. brother Branham says remember we can have what we want if we're asking faith believing Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe that will believe and he says we have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not exercise your faith yeah exercise your faith you ask and you provide amen praise the Lord you pray one for the other praise the Lord like her I like brother brother always a prayer amen praise the Lord I'm coming to that amen says uh he said ask abundance that your joy might be full I like that yeah don't be a whatever person ah whatever if the Lord wants me to go to church hour that's fine I'll go if it rains uh well I know I'm not going to church come to church not standing by the door and say Lord if you want me to go to church can you stop that rain no you go to church praise the Lord amen dive in and see what Israel says amen and he says our teaching right Abraham is saying paragraph 42. the influence of one another paragraph 42 he say say the right thing do the right thing think the right thing so you are standing still keep those in mind say the right thing do the right thing think the right thing and he says always be thinking right praise the lord always be thinking right it works it works remember we're talking about we are born shaped in iniquity you can't excuse that your malice jealous whatever it is all loaded upon us but we have to mind those things out Brahma says say the right thing do the right thing think the right thing and he says I've got a little slogan and he says do right that's your duty to God think right that's your duty to yourself and you are bound to come out right you will come out right you think right not when people are there big biting their Pastor you join them in nah you pray for them you want real Joy you see someone who's uh not uh well some of the things there you see someone who's not uh behaving uh doing well and uh you talk to them face of course and problem you talked to them and uh the scripture says you talk to them amen and you pray for them you know what your job will be when you see them coming back and they're coming in there coming out straight you will have Greater Joy praise the Lord don't big bite no no no no don't do that think right yeah because if you start big biting your you are destroying that which you are building because you are sending still you want to see the salvation of the Lord yeah we say some of these things they drag one and now you you you you're just throwing spanners in your own work praise the Lord amen some of these things don't give up do right that's your duty God think right that's your duty yourself and you are bound to come out right praise the Lord and you will come out right God doesn't lie now he doesn't lie nah that's not his nature no no he doesn't lie you'll come out right praise the Lord you will come out right amen praise the Lord you pray for your pastor yeah yeah pray for your pastor you said Lord take away any spirits of criticism and all that and like brother Aura he's very Frankie that's very true take them away from you and stay pure think right do right yeah well if you do right yeah pay your tithes very true your offerings in the Bible it says they are robbing me because they are not paying their tithes well we don't force you but do right very true you come out right if you miss it well you miss it we just pray for you you know one thing when you come into that uh uh great uh when he comes down into you he takes away all the malice away from you here some of these things it's a process yeah it goes slowly slowly slowly slowly and with time you find ah I used to when they do this thing to me in my heart I don't feel like I'll chew them up but now doesn't even affect me I'm even praying for them and when you are there when you get into that uh when he comes in jealous doesn't have any place you always do right think right that's your duty to yourself and you're bound to come out right and he says you can't be going east and west at the same time that's impossible so if you are doing right you're doing right and you come out right praise the Lord if you're praying for your pastor so that I he preaches in here and things move on the spirit of God moves on you'll come out right you'll come out right and you will rejoice you do like another brother the pasta comes up here says shall we open our Bibles to exhort Us in there oh can we read from verse 13 or somewhere there you do like another brother you take your Bible you're sure to someone has read from Exodus to verse 13 and now he's taking it from verse 14. yeah that happens you pray what happens you're you're back home there you read your chapter you end on a certain verse and you come to church and the pastor picks it from there and finishes it that's the spirit of God those are some of the things that encourages us as he brings that bear came in you are at home there the tape you are listening to at home there or you're driving you come here the pastor just picks the quotation right one that sets you on fire yeah it sets you on fire and you want to do more yeah praise the Lord we're doing it rupturing Grace doing it may the Lord bless you and may he keeps you moving on that trick amen you can't be going east and west at the same time no you can't be going right and wrong at the same time no matter how much you think you are going the other way if you are not traveling directly with you are not going east if you are going west so that's a very simple principle because at times we hang in between you don't even know what to do am I doing right am I not doing right and the devil if he keeps you sort of like in that position where you are wondering it's got your name right sport but when you are doing right and you know you are doing right you will come out right praise the Lord you will come out right praise the Lord and uh always keep that atmosphere around you love always amen praise the Lord pray one for the other amen you're standing still and brother pranam says be Satan of God on paragraph 24. he said how should you bite your lips until they would bleed he's talking about that with the woman should you go out in the kitchen and raise up your hands and say oh Jehovah I am a widow who believes in you and you took the little boy's father your servant up into heaven to be with you I like that right kind of attitude is that with a woman whose husband died and they were taking his sons away and if you don't help me it won't be long till we'll be visiting him so she's saying if Lord if you don't come because we don't have anything to eat we'll be dying we'll be coming over to Heaven itself amen nevertheless whatever you do I love you just the same and I trust you trust him he is real that is real just waiting for one day when everything will be changed and when he does the changing it'll be done the world will be left behind and you'll be taken away in the rapture yeah yeah there's no way they will say ah well order can we go again for a replay because I missed it this time around I'll get it right there is no that you do it right now it's by faith it's by faith you get it now it's accepted by faith you will come out right praise the Lord amen that's why we say those with the gift of singing well yeah of course if you're a child of God you'll go to heaven will be together there for that gift of singing We need you to sing Here Come and sing for us we need the encouragement that's why we come to church yeah no see come and stand here because when you get to heaven we don't need any encouragement there we need the encouragement more here praise the Lord amen there was a sister who used to sing but she didn't have a voice for singing but she always wanted to sing and she always saying but with time you find it it becomes a a blessing praise a lot so come see yeah seek for us praise the Lord oh man Bridget that's the way to go amen praise the Lord yes we are allowed to shout aren't we oh praise the Lord even and he says yeah and if you don't help me it won't be long till we'll be visiting him nevertheless whatever you do I love you just the same and I trust you and program says it seems strange when a person has done all they can do that they fulfilled every request that God has asked them to do and still he is silent yeah there are times like that when it's just silent he is real very very yeah but at times it's just silent just silent and at times that silent when God tells he doesn't give you a half taste oh he gives it a maximum yeah when he really does it closes his eyes and if you pass it he knows it's a genuine one genuine one yeah those who are his they always stand that test it's an ultimate test ultimate this stand still and see the salvation of the Lord oh I see almost a Breaking Point stand seal and see the salvation of the Lord and at times it even breaks drop before it hits the grounds he picks it up that's his promise before it hits the ground he picks it up and I'll be smiling to you he says see I am Jehovah God when he met the prophet on that mountain that hurricane is coming he says go back I'm the one who created the winds and everything you go back and you just to do what God was asking him to do and he says speak and it speaks when you have passed that out mid taste yeah God will say that no we can't refuse him our genuine character we can't refuse in our deep Fellowship he's one of us coming praise the Lord don't give up I love you just the same and I trust you it seems strange when a person has done all that they can do that they have fulfilled every request that God has asked them to do and still be silent when you've done all that God has requested you to do and still he is silent just be sure that you know God and remember faith is silently waiting he is only testing your faith to see what you will do a brother misbehaves is testing to see what he will do you pray for them you pray for that don't say ah separate seed good readings now you'll pray he wants to see your reaction he'll pray for them yeah yeah exercise that face yeah at times it's if they have grown to your times it's difficult to pray for them pray with their Grudge really biting your hair you win that one it gives you another one yeah and before you know it you're growing you're growing you're growing praise the Lord and you come to his perfection hallelujah amen and I like this uh that Brahm says he says God is not known by knowledge but is known by faith because the Devils they know him by knowledge yeah the devil knows there's God he knows him by knowledge but he doesn't know him by faith faith is what makes God move amen it's not by faith and faith alone is the only way you will know God and this works are the acts of faith in the stage of a perfect man he says that knowledge is there is that knowledge not just the knowledge of knowing that the scriptures but the knowledge of knowing that God will keep that which he has promised me not for trust not for Assurance and I believe that's where we are coming to amen praise the Lord and he says if you find faith faith is always accompanied with love they are great friends faith and love move hand in hand faith and love amen so if that faith it always moves with love praise the Lord amen now when you are inverter he really wants to to bring you into that position yeah you're always full of love praise the Lord full of love you stand still and wait on the Lord don't stress it's easy to stress it's very easy we've been there were your toes you can't even sleep but he says no don't stress but I'm glad I'm past that now yeah any problems protect them leave it to here anything I'm not I'm going to sleep yeah you're asleep you're not meant to spend the whole night yeah up you are thinking what can I do about what is that husband gonna come from [Music] where is that money gonna come from or how my children come back our brains they are made for processing not thinking deep now take that burden give it into his puzzle you'll take care of that amen praise the Lord may the Lord bless you You're such good people and when I say you are such good people I mean it don't stress over anything you stand still God respects his order his channels very true you want to get far respect your pastor Ah that's very true you respect that office problem says if you can't respect him just respect the office but you will respect him praise the Lord that's what God wants you to do if you want to go far with God respect that office respect your pastor you pray for your pastor you'll pray one for the other and maintain that Spirit of love and unity stand still and see the salvation of the Lord I want to thank you for what you did for me my pastor back home say yes to say when a brother buys a house says oh we've got a house now the whole church have got a house when someone buys a kite says Ah we now we've got a
