[1:02:34] where we stand we're a blessed people
[1:02:36] but maybe we can just look into it a
[1:02:38] little bit more detail today and um get
[1:02:41] something from it that'll be a blessing
[1:02:42] to you so just let's just turn to the
[1:02:44] scripture here Isaiah 53 and verse 1 as
[1:02:47] we make a beginning and thank you
[1:02:49] musicians
[1:03:06] amen one little verse it's got two
[1:03:09] questions in it says who hath Isaiah
[1:03:12] 53:1 who hath believed our report and to
[1:03:15] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so
[1:03:19] firstly who's believed the report and
[1:03:22] who has the who to whom is the arm of
[1:03:24] the Lord revealed amen let's just pray
[1:03:26] at this time Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:03:28] just ask that you would break this to us
[1:03:30] today Lord seems like a simple scripture
[1:03:32] but yet there's a profound uh message
[1:03:34] and meaning in here I ask Lord that you
[1:03:37] just make it known to us and just feed
[1:03:38] us this morning we ask and pray in
[1:03:40] jesus' name amen amen God bless you you
[1:03:43] may be
[1:03:45] seated so firstly the what says who who
[1:03:49] ha believed the uh our report it's not
[1:03:52] so much speaking about the report it's
[1:03:53] speaking about who's actually going to
[1:03:55] believe it so we've identified we've
[1:03:57] already sung who's believed the report
[1:03:59] of the Lord and we've always SE that's
[1:04:01] us so um that's really I'm going to get
[1:04:03] right to that point at the end that this
[1:04:05] whole thing it points right back to our
[1:04:07] position our position in Christ so we're
[1:04:09] very thankful for that who has believed
[1:04:12] uh the report well we're that's us and
[1:04:17] uh even you all of the prophets really
[1:04:19] had this in mind if you think about it
[1:04:20] they came as Messengers and so is
[1:04:23] anybody actually going to believe what
[1:04:25] I'm what I'm going to say and even Jesus
[1:04:27] himself when he knew that he was going
[1:04:29] to be coming a second time he says when
[1:04:31] the son of man cometh will he find Faith
[1:04:34] he this is this is God himself but he
[1:04:36] says when I come the next time it's on
[1:04:38] his mind will I find Faith
[1:04:42] because it was always the case where
[1:04:44] people didn't believe the report that
[1:04:45] was given it's just the way that it's
[1:04:48] always been you know there's um uh a
[1:04:51] couple of times where we see in
[1:04:52] scripture the Lord talk about the arm of
[1:04:55] the Lord the arm the Lord actually means
[1:04:56] the strength and the power and the holy
[1:04:59] justice of God and you think about when
[1:05:02] uh um outside Jericho there Joshua
[1:05:06] standing there and he sees a man
[1:05:07] standing against the wall with a sword
[1:05:09] drawn on his hand and he says are you
[1:05:11] for us or are you against us and he says
[1:05:13] as the captain of the host of the Lord
[1:05:15] am I now
[1:05:16] come well that to me that that kind of
[1:05:19] typifies what the arm of the Lord looks
[1:05:21] like that's the strength and the power
[1:05:23] of the Lord you Joshua only reason
[1:05:26] Joshua could go up to that man was
[1:05:27] because he knew his commission the Lord
[1:05:29] says I'll be with you there won't be a
[1:05:31] man be able to stand against you all the
[1:05:33] days of your life amen so he believed
[1:05:35] that report I was reading in the message
[1:05:38] where brother BR talks about there was
[1:05:40] two times in his ministry where people
[1:05:43] challenged him one time somebody put out
[1:05:45] a whole lot of Fliers and said brother
[1:05:46] brandham said William brandham is Simon
[1:05:49] the the Sorcerer And the FBI are coming
[1:05:52] here today coming into the meeting and
[1:05:53] they're going to expose him and another
[1:05:56] time was with those 300 ministers they
[1:05:58] set up a trap for brother Brenham and
[1:06:00] both those occasions brother Brenham
[1:06:01] says you've seen him in his in uh in
[1:06:04] healing but he says you want to see him
[1:06:06] in battle he said he's marvelous in
[1:06:08] battle amen and you know when the saints
[1:06:10] talked about that the Lord was going to
[1:06:12] come lift up you Gates lift up you know
[1:06:15] Everlasting Gates he says the king of
[1:06:17] glory is going to come and says who is
[1:06:18] this king of glory he says the Lord
[1:06:20] strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in
[1:06:22] battle amen and I want to just read here
[1:06:25] out Revelation chapter 19 we get another
[1:06:27] picture of him just as we make a
[1:06:28] beginning it says and I saw heaven open
[1:06:31] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:06:32] on him was called faithful and true and
[1:06:35] in righteousness do he judge and make
[1:06:37] war and his eyes are as a flame of fire
[1:06:39] and on his head were many crowns and he
[1:06:41] had a name written that no man knew but
[1:06:44] he
[1:06:45] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:06:47] vesture dipped in blood so we know it's
[1:06:49] the Lord Jesus and his name was called
[1:06:51] the word of God and the armies which
[1:06:53] were in heaven followed him on white
[1:06:55] horses clothed and fine linen white and
[1:06:58] clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[1:07:00] sword that's his word and with it uh
[1:07:04] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[1:07:05] and should rule them with a rod of iron
[1:07:07] and he treadeth The Wine Press of the
[1:07:09] fierceness and wroth of almighty God and
[1:07:12] he hath on his vesture and on his thigh
[1:07:14] a name written king of kings and Lord of
[1:07:18] lords amen and that's the one that
[1:07:21] Isaiah was saying who is the strength of
[1:07:24] the Lord this power this holy uh justice
[1:07:29] the Lord who is that going to be
[1:07:30] revealed to and I can tell you it's
[1:07:32] revealed to the bride not only is it
[1:07:34] revealed like in a head knowledge it's
[1:07:35] going to be manifest in the bride amen
[1:07:38] and that's the Revelation that he was
[1:07:39] talking about but I want to go right
[1:07:41] back now to the beginning back in the
[1:07:43] beginning brother Brenham says that uh
[1:07:46] God was in eternity and he dwelt alone
[1:07:48] he was by himself and he was there with
[1:07:50] his thoughts and he says his thoughts
[1:07:52] are Eternal and he was thinking of us
[1:07:54] and I'm glad that we know that he was
[1:07:56] thinking of us right back in the
[1:07:57] beginning but um brother bam says that
[1:08:00] all the attributes were in him he was
[1:08:02] just he was melling over these things in
[1:08:04] his mind to be a Healer to be a savior
[1:08:06] to be a father to be a son to be a
[1:08:08] husband he was thinking of all these
[1:08:10] things how he was going to have a bride
[1:08:13] and while he was thinking on all these
[1:08:15] things nothing moved nothing
[1:08:20] happened he knew that the moment that he
[1:08:23] spoke things were going to happen it was
[1:08:26] going to suddenly come into being but he
[1:08:28] was just enjoying the thoughts of what
[1:08:30] was going to be and nothing
[1:08:33] moved brother bam says it was always
[1:08:35] God's intention he wanted to become
[1:08:37] tangible it's always it's God becoming
[1:08:40] tangible he says you a part of God Jesus
[1:08:42] come to redeem those that was put on the
[1:08:44] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:08:46] foundation of the world it was in God's
[1:08:48] thoughts that's what he come to redeem
[1:08:51] redeem means buy back you had to be in
[1:08:53] his thoughts before he can redeem you
[1:08:55] and when we realized that we're redeemed
[1:08:57] we go praise the Lord he was thinking of
[1:08:59] me before the foundation of the world
[1:09:01] you can't say that till you are redeemed
[1:09:02] but when you are redeemed you realize
[1:09:03] hey he was thinking me praise the Lord
[1:09:05] and that's why the bride cries Grace
[1:09:07] Grace amen praise the Lord the whole
[1:09:10] thing uh he says Jesus said at that day
[1:09:12] you'll know that I'm in the Father the
[1:09:14] father in me I in you and you in me the
[1:09:18] whole thing is God becoming material
[1:09:20] like a husband and wife becoming one
[1:09:22] together God and his church becoming one
[1:09:26] amen but by his full knowledge he could
[1:09:28] see us and he could see us even in this
[1:09:30] day and he could see what you would do
[1:09:32] with the word in this day so that's why
[1:09:35] he could predestinate you yes he says
[1:09:37] when they presented with my word in the
[1:09:40] day in which they live they will receive
[1:09:41] it he says so right back before he
[1:09:44] started to make anything he says I can
[1:09:46] already predetermine their
[1:09:50] destination because he knows what you do
[1:09:52] with the word he knows what's In You by
[1:09:54] the way that you react to the word in
[1:09:55] fact that's what the only way we know
[1:09:57] what's in US is by the way that we react
[1:09:59] to the word praise the Lord so while he
[1:10:01] was thinking on all this creation and
[1:10:02] all the attributes and things that he
[1:10:04] was going to make he also thought he was
[1:10:06] going to make angels and he's going to
[1:10:08] make one called
[1:10:09] Lucifer and he knew what Lucifer was
[1:10:11] going to do amen he knew he was going to
[1:10:14] make him beautiful the most beautiful of
[1:10:15] all of the angels and he's going to he's
[1:10:17] going to get lifted up in Pride and
[1:10:19] eventually he's going to be the enemy of
[1:10:22] God but God knew this from the beginning
[1:10:23] he knows all things so so it wasn't like
[1:10:26] oh suddenly the Devils arrived on the
[1:10:28] scene he knew that was going to happen
[1:10:30] and he had to allow that to happen and
[1:10:32] in his thoughts his thinking about how
[1:10:34] it's all going to transpire and how that
[1:10:36] he's going to be tested and tried
[1:10:38] himself but all of the Brethren down
[1:10:40] through the age are going to be tested
[1:10:41] and tried but it's actually the word in
[1:10:43] you that's being tested and tried amen
[1:10:45] and he can see the end that there's a
[1:10:47] victory amen so we're glad about that so
[1:10:50] we let all those things happen but the
[1:10:52] Bible actually says that he himself was
[1:10:54] perfected
[1:10:55] through the things that he suffered
[1:10:57] that's right and the bride is perfected
[1:10:59] by the things that we suffer the things
[1:11:01] that we go through the challenges that
[1:11:02] we have and we make a stand for the
[1:11:04] truth he says that goes to your credit
[1:11:07] that goes to your credit one day he's
[1:11:09] going to say Well done my good and
[1:11:11] faithful soon he can only say Well done
[1:11:13] if there's something done well so he has
[1:11:15] to put a challenge there so we have
[1:11:17] something to overcome he says now you're
[1:11:19] an overcomer but you couldn't be an
[1:11:20] overcomer without something to overcome
[1:11:22] so he said I got to have Lucifer he's
[1:11:24] got to be there
[1:11:26] because who else is going to put these
[1:11:27] hurdles in the way who else is going to
[1:11:29] be the challenge to you if I don't have
[1:11:30] a devil he's got to have him so he's
[1:11:32] thinking about all these things and he's
[1:11:34] thinking well but in the end I'm going
[1:11:36] to bring it to a great climax I'm going
[1:11:37] to bring it to the point where I will
[1:11:39] have a bride I'll have a gentile bride
[1:11:41] the love of my life she'll be with me
[1:11:43] throughout the eternities he said that's
[1:11:45] what it's going to be she'll be an
[1:11:46] overcomer just like me because I've
[1:11:49] overcome the world you'll overcome the
[1:11:51] world he it was in his thinking he was
[1:11:53] enjoying the moment amen the moment
[1:11:56] might have been
[1:11:58] long and he's thing he's going to have
[1:12:00] his Brethren the Jews he's going to have
[1:12:02] the New Jerusalem coming down the holy
[1:12:04] city the great king the Eternal Kingdom
[1:12:07] what what a what a great thing this is
[1:12:08] going to be great should we should be
[1:12:10] thinking this is going to be great I'm
[1:12:12] looking forward to being there amen amen
[1:12:15] and while he was enjoying all that still
[1:12:18] there was
[1:12:19] no light brother re said there was no
[1:12:22] Darkness there was no nothing just his
[1:12:25] thinking but then the moment that he
[1:12:27] spoke and said let there
[1:12:31] be the biggest explosion of energy
[1:12:34] that's ever been took place all of the
[1:12:36] energy that's in every Star and every
[1:12:39] Galaxy on the earth anywhere was created
[1:12:42] in that moment and you know what there's
[1:12:45] still evidence of that right now you can
[1:12:46] look out to space if you can look 13.8
[1:12:49] billion uh light years you see what they
[1:12:52] call the cosmic microwave background
[1:12:54] radiation it's just like a haze at that
[1:12:58] point and that's the leftover from God
[1:13:01] saying let there be now God could have
[1:13:03] created something and he does does
[1:13:05] create things like he did squirrels and
[1:13:06] says Let There Be squirrels and it's
[1:13:08] there he could have just said let the
[1:13:10] sun be there and it is let the Earth be
[1:13:12] there and it is but brother R said
[1:13:13] that's not how he did
[1:13:14] it so he he can do that and he did do
[1:13:17] that with squirrels he probably is how
[1:13:19] he did it when he replenished the Earth
[1:13:20] in Genesis 1:2 as he let the animals be
[1:13:23] here and so forth but they a lot of
[1:13:25] those those animals were here previously
[1:13:26] but when he replenished the Earth that's
[1:13:28] probably how he did it I'm just saying
[1:13:30] probably but the reason is that God is a
[1:13:33] supernatural God and we need to break
[1:13:35] that into two words he's super and he's
[1:13:38] natural yeah and that's the way he often
[1:13:40] lets things play out so between Genesis
[1:13:43] 1:1 he said let there be and this
[1:13:46] massive explosion but slowly the gases
[1:13:50] coales into being planets and stars and
[1:13:53] galaxies and he just let it L out
[1:13:55] brother say billions of years and then
[1:13:57] he stopped everything where he wants it
[1:13:59] yeah and he's got to and there was life
[1:14:01] here on Earth previously and then we get
[1:14:04] to Genesis 1:2 and the Earth was without
[1:14:06] form and void and darkness upon the face
[1:14:08] of the deep he says now I'm ready to
[1:14:10] make this creation for a people to
[1:14:13] express that can be my bride and brother
[1:14:15] ra says God's in no hurry he just lets
[1:14:18] these things so he's super he does it
[1:14:20] but he lets it play out in a natural
[1:14:22] sequence and then he harnesses that amen
[1:14:26] so that's the way that he does it so
[1:14:28] then after our creation began he started
[1:14:31] speaking again and he actually spoke for
[1:14:33] 6,000
[1:14:34] years and the creation came into being
[1:14:37] in fact brother R says even when he said
[1:14:39] let there be light he said the sun was
[1:14:40] already there been there for billions of
[1:14:42] years the sun was already there he said
[1:14:44] let there be light there was a fog like
[1:14:46] a Darkness over the face of the Earth
[1:14:48] and he said let there be light he said
[1:14:49] it might have been 800 years before the
[1:14:51] light came through that's just a quote
[1:14:53] from Brother renom but but moment he
[1:14:56] said let there be light he said it's
[1:14:57] good because when he spoke his word he
[1:15:00] knew it was going to take place he knew
[1:15:01] it's going to come to pass amen praise
[1:15:05] the Lord so in the beginning brother BR
[1:15:07] he's in the future home he says God in
[1:15:09] the beginning when he thought of you he
[1:15:10] thought of others like that he thought
[1:15:12] of himself becoming tangible that was
[1:15:15] his thoughts and so he expressed his
[1:15:17] thought by word and he Le said let there
[1:15:18] be let there be let there be and there
[1:15:20] was and there was he says and after a
[1:15:22] while he kept saying let there be till
[1:15:23] the people said one day don't let God
[1:15:26] speak he said now I'll speak to them
[1:15:29] through a prophet from this time on I'll
[1:15:31] speak to them through a prophet amen but
[1:15:33] just before we move on remember the very
[1:15:35] first form of expression of the thought
[1:15:37] of God was a word he spoke a word it
[1:15:41] went from thought to word to
[1:15:44] manifestation that's that's that's God's
[1:15:46] signature if you like that's what he
[1:15:47] does when he the very first expression
[1:15:50] of the Rapture went from a thought to a
[1:15:53] word which is called the shout in the
[1:15:54] Bible the message went forth the very
[1:15:57] first expression was word form but it
[1:15:59] will continue to unfold until the bride
[1:16:01] takes a body change amen so that's
[1:16:04] that's the what it is but because the
[1:16:06] word has already gone forth remember
[1:16:07] when it was just a thought nothing moved
[1:16:10] but now that he's spoken the message in
[1:16:12] this last days which is the rapture
[1:16:14] message the Rapture must take place amen
[1:16:17] it's absolutely a guarantee and I happen
[1:16:19] to believe it and that means I'm part of
[1:16:21] it amen I think we should just say we
[1:16:24] are the rapture
[1:16:25] because the Rapture can't go without us
[1:16:28] amen so when Isaiah's asking this
[1:16:30] question here who ha believed our report
[1:16:32] he's saying he he didn't doubt the word
[1:16:33] of the Lord but who's going to believe
[1:16:35] it when that word is spoken through
[1:16:38] me because it wasn't so much the that he
[1:16:41] was concerned about the word of the Lord
[1:16:43] he was concerned that they were going to
[1:16:44] believe me and and all of the prophets
[1:16:47] had exactly the same question and it
[1:16:50] wasn't surprising that Isaiah had this
[1:16:52] question because they rejected the
[1:16:55] people did they rejected him they
[1:16:58] rejected his message they killed him
[1:16:59] they so him up with
[1:17:02] SS so it was a valid question who's
[1:17:04] going to believe me he wasn't it wasn't
[1:17:07] just a a frivolous question he realized
[1:17:09] that it's very unlikely that anybody is
[1:17:12] actually going to believe me but you
[1:17:14] know what the Lord says his word will
[1:17:16] not return unto him void the word that
[1:17:18] Isaiah spoke We Now read it today many
[1:17:22] many scriptures that we have we say that
[1:17:24] Isaiah prophesied that all the
[1:17:25] Prophecies of Christ they came to pass
[1:17:27] that Isaiah prophesied 800 years before
[1:17:30] the coming of Christ he was a genuine
[1:17:32] Prophet the prophecies came to pass the
[1:17:34] word will not return unto the Lord void
[1:17:36] it will accomplish that for which it
[1:17:37] sent but it has it can only accomplish
[1:17:40] something in those that believe it amen
[1:17:43] so that's want to do so what it really
[1:17:45] means is that somebody is actually going
[1:17:47] to believe it amen and the prophet says
[1:17:50] here and what it's going to come to when
[1:17:52] when the Lord is creating everything he
[1:17:54] says God God had to believe his own
[1:17:57] word God said let there be and it was
[1:18:01] this is the message Jehovah Jara he
[1:18:03] believed his own word everything
[1:18:05] material come from the supernatural God
[1:18:07] spoke the world into existence amen and
[1:18:11] he believed it he believed his own word
[1:18:13] and then it came to pass so then
[1:18:16] throughout time and brother calls them
[1:18:17] Junctions in time the Lord sent prophets
[1:18:20] whenever he was going to do something
[1:18:22] remember he said the Lord God does
[1:18:23] nothing but he reveals it to servants
[1:18:25] the prophets
[1:18:26] first at those Junctions of time a
[1:18:29] prophet had to come and speak the word
[1:18:31] before it could be made manifest Noah
[1:18:33] had to come and say it's going to rain
[1:18:36] before it could rain Moses had to say
[1:18:39] speak about the Exodus that we're going
[1:18:40] to we're going to leave this land the
[1:18:42] Lord's going to come and Deliver Us with
[1:18:44] a mighty hand and it seemed like there
[1:18:46] was going to be an impossibility but
[1:18:47] because it was spoken it was the word of
[1:18:49] the Lord and it transpired just exactly
[1:18:51] that way now most of what we know about
[1:18:55] absolutely everything we have to believe
[1:18:58] somebody yes when you go to school
[1:19:01] children go to school if they don't
[1:19:03] believe the
[1:19:05] teacher you don't learn anything from
[1:19:07] the teacher if the teacher doesn't know
[1:19:09] what they're talking about well you
[1:19:11] wouldn't learn anything or even if you
[1:19:13] come to church and The Minister's
[1:19:14] ministering you think oh he doesn't know
[1:19:16] he's talking about you're not going to
[1:19:17] learn anything so whatever we learn we
[1:19:20] go to university or whatever we need to
[1:19:21] actually have confidence in the one
[1:19:23] that's bringing the message message
[1:19:25] before you can receive the
[1:19:27] message yeah if we read it in a book or
[1:19:30] I see people often these days they
[1:19:31] become experts while looking at
[1:19:33] something on YouTube oh yes I'm an
[1:19:34] expert now it means that they've given
[1:19:36] their they' they've handed over their
[1:19:38] confidence to this person who makes the
[1:19:39] video it's very easy to do and it's very
[1:19:42] easy to get trapped into the wrong thing
[1:19:44] by doing that so a question that we
[1:19:46] should all ask and we probably do ask
[1:19:48] but we maybe don't ask enough is is this
[1:19:50] actually a credible uh person or you
[1:19:53] know a credible
[1:19:55] um thing that's being said here because
[1:19:57] there are a multitude of voices in the
[1:19:59] world never ever before in human history
[1:20:02] have there been so many voices so many
[1:20:05] opinions and not only do people have
[1:20:06] those opinions because they probably had
[1:20:08] opinions before but they want to spread
[1:20:10] those opinions they want to put it on
[1:20:12] YouTube they want to put it want to get
[1:20:13] their own blog or they want to they want
[1:20:15] to tell you and they want to get people
[1:20:16] to agree like give me a thumbs up and
[1:20:19] the more people that agree it to them it
[1:20:21] means they must be right but you know
[1:20:24] who's got the most thumbs up
[1:20:28] Satan he's got the most people that
[1:20:30] agree with him way more than God has and
[1:20:33] he's
[1:20:36] wrong you you see things like in the
[1:20:38] news we reading this and they can make
[1:20:40] you mad but we know that the world has
[1:20:41] to go this way the the the news articles
[1:20:43] about
[1:20:44] Israel and the most of the news articles
[1:20:47] they absolutely just against Israel in
[1:20:51] every turn you know they should be
[1:20:53] letting uh gazin you know have from the
[1:20:55] river to the Sea and I don't know where
[1:20:57] Israel would go but you know everybody's
[1:20:59] trying to support the wrong thing but
[1:21:01] the there's there's still two polarized
[1:21:03] positions this the the UN or the ICC
[1:21:06] just recently said they want arrest
[1:21:08] warrants issued arrest warrants for
[1:21:10] nyaho and and Galant I think it was and
[1:21:14] uh then all of the different nations of
[1:21:16] the world they put out a statement
[1:21:17] whether they agreed with this or they
[1:21:19] disagreed with it agreed disagree agree
[1:21:21] disagree and there was no one in the
[1:21:23] middle that all either against Israel or
[1:21:26] for Israel polarized positions and we
[1:21:30] find that in everything in life and it's
[1:21:32] just it's just the age that we live in
[1:21:35] it's just the way that it is so what we
[1:21:37] need whatever we're dealing with we need
[1:21:39] a credible witness brother brandham says
[1:21:42] here and greater than Solomon is here he
[1:21:44] said God in all ages has never been
[1:21:46] without a witness God has sometimes got
[1:21:48] down to only one man but he's always had
[1:21:50] a witness somebody who believed him amen
[1:21:54] and God always Vindicated his Witnesses
[1:21:57] if you seen a prophet he Vindicated them
[1:22:00] and you know even when Jesus came and uh
[1:22:02] to the two on the road to Emmas he said
[1:22:04] fools and SL heart to believe all that
[1:22:07] the prophets have spoken you know you
[1:22:09] think he could have said fools and SL of
[1:22:10] heart to believe everything I told you
[1:22:12] but he didn't do that he said believe
[1:22:14] all that the prophets has spoken amen
[1:22:17] because God had identified them
[1:22:19] previously and they lined up with the
[1:22:21] word but there are many many other
[1:22:23] Witnesses B I calls them false Witnesses
[1:22:26] there's many many others out there so
[1:22:28] which witness We Believe makes all a
[1:22:32] difference we're here today because we
[1:22:34] believe a particular
[1:22:36] witness but there's other people
[1:22:38] gathered in other places and they
[1:22:39] believe a different witness Jehovah's
[1:22:42] Witness or whoever it is they think oh
[1:22:45] this is
[1:23:05] little there's a road goes up a hill and
[1:23:08] there's a bus there and it's crashed
[1:23:09] straight into the back of a car and you
[1:23:11] just come there after it's happened and
[1:23:13] you see this bus is running to the back
[1:23:14] of the car and uh somebody says wow that
[1:23:17] bus driver is going to get a ticket
[1:23:18] because you know obviously the car
[1:23:20] that's the vehicle that's behind that
[1:23:21] crashes in is at fault and he's going to
[1:23:24] get a ticket when the police get here
[1:23:26] cuz he smashed this car up really bad
[1:23:28] but somebody else comes maybe a child
[1:23:30] says no no no no the bus was stopped and
[1:23:33] the car rolled down the hill without the
[1:23:35] handbrake on and it crashed into the
[1:23:37] back of the car there not even a driver
[1:23:38] in the
[1:23:40] car yeah depending on who you believe
[1:23:45] makes the story completely
[1:23:46] different it's it's all dependent on
[1:23:49] which witness you're going to believe
[1:23:51] and that's exactly where we stand with
[1:23:53] regard to the word of God who whose
[1:23:54] witness are we going to believe who ha
[1:23:56] believed our report amen so right in the
[1:23:59] beginning God knew that man was going to
[1:24:01] fall he knew that before he created
[1:24:02] anything he knew the nature that was in
[1:24:05] mankind that he was going to fall and he
[1:24:07] made a plan from the beginning to redeem
[1:24:09] that man he intended to make a way back
[1:24:12] brother R says in the Ephesian Church
[1:24:13] age before the foundation of the Earth
[1:24:15] the purpose of God was to share his
[1:24:18] eternal life with man he says now watch
[1:24:21] this improving his word now watch the
[1:24:23] wisdom of God no there would be
[1:24:24] unbelievers and how the majority would
[1:24:27] be unbelievers he by forn knowledge
[1:24:29] predestinated a seed for every age that
[1:24:33] would believe it amen every age there's
[1:24:36] going to be somebody that's going to
[1:24:37] believe it because he had a continual
[1:24:39] lineage he said he never got down to
[1:24:41] less than one man amen and he says he
[1:24:44] does it by his fulln knowledge do you
[1:24:47] know what that means he looks ahead I
[1:24:49] think I said when I was here last time
[1:24:50] thing that God does he remembers the
[1:24:52] future
[1:24:54] we only can remember the past but he can
[1:24:56] remember the future and he looks at you
[1:24:58] and goes when you get here in 2024 you
[1:25:01] are going to believe my word and because
[1:25:04] you've responded to my word now I go
[1:25:06] back before the foundation of the world
[1:25:07] and I will predestinate you and say I
[1:25:10] put my mark on you that you will be
[1:25:12] there in that Heavenly Kingdom to come
[1:25:14] amen he predestinate you and I found
[1:25:16] this quote and I really love this he
[1:25:18] says before there was a world you were
[1:25:20] in God's thoughts he says you were in
[1:25:23] God's thoughts to give you the Holy
[1:25:24] Ghost because he knew that you'd be
[1:25:27] wanting
[1:25:28] it don't you love that he knew that
[1:25:31] you'd be wanting it before the
[1:25:32] foundation of the world he knew that's
[1:25:34] within you praise the Lord I love that
[1:25:36] I've love that now one thing that people
[1:25:39] have always had with the message of any
[1:25:41] age is if they don't want to let's say
[1:25:43] obey the
[1:25:44] message if they don't if they don't want
[1:25:46] to take the message wholeheartedly they
[1:25:48] find fault with the
[1:25:50] messenger always it doesn't matter what
[1:25:52] the messenger is uh I was a balum he
[1:25:55] found fault with his messenger was a
[1:25:56] donkey he was going to beat him with a
[1:25:59] stick but he was just a
[1:26:01] messenger yeah so now but God when he
[1:26:05] has spoken in each age he's spoken
[1:26:06] through human vessels it was his plan to
[1:26:09] do that way but the thing with human
[1:26:11] vessels are human vessels have human
[1:26:13] nature and human nature is a real Downer
[1:26:16] we've all got it and it's a problem but
[1:26:19] um God knew what he was doing you know
[1:26:22] when he chose the prophets brother BR
[1:26:24] says some of them their temper got away
[1:26:26] from them you think of Jonah you know he
[1:26:29] he he was reluctant to do what the Lord
[1:26:30] wanted him to do he wanted to go he's
[1:26:31] going to take a ship to tarish and then
[1:26:33] the then the Lord brings a storm and
[1:26:35] okay yeah it's me so throw me over gets
[1:26:37] thrown over and he goes in the well
[1:26:38] whales belly and and he he was a man of
[1:26:40] great faith and he prayed and the Lord
[1:26:42] you know made the whale take him up and
[1:26:44] spit him out on the shore but when he
[1:26:46] went went to preach to n brother say he
[1:26:48] he didn't like them yeah that's right
[1:26:50] they were not his people they were
[1:26:51] Gentiles he was a Jew he didn't want to
[1:26:53] be there he was an angry prophet he went
[1:26:55] in and preached Hellfire and brimstone
[1:26:57] and you're all going to die because you
[1:26:58] won't repent you know and he was so
[1:27:00] convincing cuz he was such an angry
[1:27:02] prophet and they repented and he got
[1:27:06] outside the city and he said I'm going
[1:27:07] to sit here and I'm going to watch the
[1:27:08] thing blow up cuz can't stand them
[1:27:11] anyhow and when the Lord didn't consume
[1:27:13] them he got more angry and then he had a
[1:27:15] little good thing like a a little plant
[1:27:18] that he set under for shade while he's
[1:27:19] waiting for this fireworks to come and
[1:27:22] then a worm eats it and kills the thing
[1:27:24] and he's more angry and the Lord says to
[1:27:26] them are you doing well to be angry and
[1:27:28] he says yes I'm doing well to be angry
[1:27:30] even unto
[1:27:32] death wow there's a lot of humanity in
[1:27:36] there but did he preach the word he did
[1:27:39] he did and they repented and that's why
[1:27:41] God sent him there but there was a lot
[1:27:43] of
[1:27:44] humanity in in there when when Elisha
[1:27:48] came and those um children came out 42
[1:27:51] children says you know go up there
[1:27:52] Baldhead and he got offended and he got
[1:27:55] angry and he cursed them in the name of
[1:27:57] the Lord and two she beers came out and
[1:27:59] ate up 42 of them brother you shouldn't
[1:28:01] have done that but it was the humanity
[1:28:04] of it Moses he says you
[1:28:06] rebels shall I you know bring water out
[1:28:09] of this rock and he's smoke the rock a
[1:28:10] second time he shouldn't have done it
[1:28:12] that was the humanity but he was God's
[1:28:15] man and when somebody spoke against
[1:28:18] God's man they got in trouble with
[1:28:21] God but you can't help but empathize in
[1:28:24] some ways that but he did some human
[1:28:27] things he did but he have to see through
[1:28:29] the humanity to see the office that he
[1:28:32] held amen so when God decided to use man
[1:28:36] as his agent it wasn't an accident it
[1:28:38] wasn't oversight he didn't just like
[1:28:40] oops Bo I've chosen man no he knew
[1:28:43] exactly what he was doing he knew what
[1:28:45] he was getting in for he knew that the
[1:28:47] weakness and the fra of humanity was
[1:28:50] part of the package
[1:28:51] deal and really it's a filter
[1:28:55] because the elect see through the human
[1:28:57] Veil to see God behind the veil amen but
[1:29:01] it does seem a strange conundrum that
[1:29:03] God who's all powerful he's infinite
[1:29:05] he's perfect he uses the weakness of
[1:29:08] humanity the fallibility of humanity to
[1:29:11] preach his infallible
[1:29:13] word the words of eternal life are
[1:29:16] preached through a finite fallible
[1:29:19] vessel
[1:29:21] amen and those who accept it
[1:29:24] have got to actually accept that the
[1:29:25] words of this man are not the words of
[1:29:28] the man but they're the words of God
[1:29:32] Amen and that's what Paul says when you
[1:29:34] when you received my letters you
[1:29:37] received it as the word of God as it
[1:29:39] actually is in fact not as the words of
[1:29:41] a
[1:29:42] man so I've met a lot of people that are
[1:29:45] are religious but they don't want to
[1:29:46] come in line with the message and say I
[1:29:48] just believe the Bible I just believe
[1:29:50] the Bible well what the what they're
[1:29:52] saying is I believe my interpretation of
[1:29:54] the Bible for a stter but in Ephesians
[1:29:57] 4:11 it says and he gave some Apostles
[1:30:00] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:30:01] and some pastors and teachers for the
[1:30:04] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:30:07] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:30:08] body of Christ unless we can receive
[1:30:11] whom he has sent we can never come to
[1:30:14] Perfection true yeah he sent he sent
[1:30:17] Ministries into the body they are there
[1:30:19] for the perfecting of the Saints without
[1:30:22] that there is no rapture
[1:30:24] amen sometimes I get a little side
[1:30:26] little rabbit hole here just a little
[1:30:28] sciency thing but you know there's
[1:30:30] there's 94 different elements in the
[1:30:32] world in in the earth and uh even this
[1:30:36] the experts say some say 90 and some say
[1:30:38] up to 98 so the experts they can't agree
[1:30:41] sometimes it's because elements can
[1:30:43] synthesize into a couple of other
[1:30:44] different elements but anyhow let's say
[1:30:46] 94 that's from hydrogen through to
[1:30:50] plutonium okay that's that's the
[1:30:52] elements that make up the everything
[1:30:54] that's here is made up of them why not
[1:30:58] get 94
[1:30:59] jars of all these things and we need
[1:31:03] some we need some uh carbon take some
[1:31:07] carbon and we need some sulfur and if
[1:31:10] you just ate those things there that's
[1:31:13] everything that's on the earth is made
[1:31:14] up of them why don't we just do
[1:31:17] that because you would you die that's
[1:31:19] why you don't do that because it would
[1:31:22] poison you it would kill you but where
[1:31:23] we are actually made up of carbon and
[1:31:25] hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and
[1:31:28] sulfur that's the chops that's the main
[1:31:30] things that everything that is uh every
[1:31:32] living thing is made of and then there's
[1:31:33] some Trace elements of different things
[1:31:35] but you can't just take those elements
[1:31:38] and consume them and expect to live
[1:31:41] because they have to be synthesized by
[1:31:42] plants to make them into a form that we
[1:31:45] can actually digest that we can actually
[1:31:47] accept and it's the same with the word
[1:31:49] of God say I I just read the Bible and
[1:31:50] I'm no there's a way that it has to be
[1:31:54] synthesized so it's digestible in the
[1:31:56] age in which you live it's it's very
[1:31:58] very important just don't I'm just going
[1:32:00] to take the raw materials not the way
[1:32:02] she says you have to believe who whom I
[1:32:04] have sent amen I think that's a good
[1:32:08] good thing amen it all sounds uh pretty
[1:32:11] complicated if you look at the whole
[1:32:13] thing and it is complicated God is
[1:32:14] complicated but he doesn't ask us to
[1:32:17] meet him in a complicated way
[1:32:21] amen uh even you know when you eat
[1:32:23] something
[1:32:24] if you eat something maybe you eat some
[1:32:27] um protein oh young I'm just going to
[1:32:29] have a protein diet well your body's got
[1:32:31] to break that down and you can't you
[1:32:33] might eat a cow but you can't put that
[1:32:35] cow can't go into your bloodstream your
[1:32:37] your body's got to break it down back
[1:32:39] into amino acids which is just the
[1:32:40] building blocks that goes into your
[1:32:42] bloodstream then you make your own
[1:32:43] proteins so that you can live so it's
[1:32:45] got to be broken down so that it can
[1:32:47] work or the same with carbohydrates and
[1:32:49] so forth It's the breaking of those
[1:32:51] chemical bonds that actually gives us
[1:32:52] the the energy and the the strength of
[1:32:54] the day it has to be your body has to do
[1:32:57] all this but you don't have to think
[1:32:58] about it you just got to eat eat and you
[1:33:02] know when we consume the word of God
[1:33:03] it's doing lots of things that we don't
[1:33:05] really understand but all we got to do
[1:33:07] is just eat the little book and it'll do
[1:33:10] the job you know that every second of
[1:33:13] your life you produce 3 3.8 billion new
[1:33:18] cells in your body every second so you
[1:33:21] know if you're sitting here feeling
[1:33:22] tired I understand okay you're really
[1:33:24] really
[1:33:25] busy that's
[1:33:27] 330 billion new cells every day and 330
[1:33:33] billion cell old cells they die they get
[1:33:36] stacked they get packed they get some of
[1:33:38] the components get reused but your body
[1:33:40] is really really busy right now so you
[1:33:44] know have have a bit understanding why
[1:33:45] you feel tired have a have a we CEST
[1:33:48] this afternoon because those things are
[1:33:50] taking place but you don't have to think
[1:33:52] about it and the Lord is doing great
[1:33:54] things in their life but we don't have
[1:33:55] to think about that we've just got to
[1:33:56] come to him the way that he says to come
[1:33:58] to him and the rest of it takes care of
[1:34:00] itself and I just like that he's he's
[1:34:02] incredibly complex he's doing things
[1:34:04] that we couldn't possibly
[1:34:06] understand but it's not how he says to
[1:34:08] come to him he says the scripture here
[1:34:10] in 1 Corinthians 1:21 says for after
[1:34:12] that in the wisdom of God in other words
[1:34:14] he in his wisdom arranged it this way
[1:34:17] that the World by wisdom knew not God so
[1:34:20] you can't learn enough to understand God
[1:34:23] by by wi by wisdom the world knew not
[1:34:25] God it pleased God by the foolishness of
[1:34:28] preaching to save them that believe and
[1:34:32] God himself didn't come down and do the
[1:34:34] preaching he used
[1:34:37] vessels he took the foolishness of
[1:34:39] preaching a man comes stands behind a
[1:34:41] desk speaks the word of God some people
[1:34:44] believe it and other people
[1:34:46] don't I don't like the way that guy
[1:34:48] looks don't I don't like his tire don't
[1:34:50] like you know he's going Bal I don't
[1:34:52] know you all whatever see some can't
[1:34:55] can't see
[1:34:57] through the veil of the flesh to see the
[1:35:00] word that's coming behind
[1:35:01] it brother Brenham says in a message God
[1:35:04] and his people he said men are just men
[1:35:06] but it's God's agency God doesn't fall
[1:35:09] upon Den nominations God doesn't fall
[1:35:10] upon Mechanical Devices so he can't just
[1:35:13] click pray play um it's we should be
[1:35:16] listening to the tapes don't get me
[1:35:17] wrong but you should also be uh
[1:35:19] listening and and be active in the
[1:35:22] fellowship where where the Lord sent you
[1:35:24] um God doesn't fall upon denominations
[1:35:26] God doesn't fall upon Mechanical Devices
[1:35:28] God the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is
[1:35:31] God's agent and he says and the hardest
[1:35:33] thing that God has ever had to do I
[1:35:35] might have said this last time but you
[1:35:37] you remember this everybody know this
[1:35:38] quote what's the hardest thing that God
[1:35:40] has ever had to do and God's done some
[1:35:42] pretty hard things right and I told you
[1:35:44] what he's doing even in in our human
[1:35:46] body what's the hardest thing that God's
[1:35:48] ever had to do was to get one mortal to
[1:35:51] believe another
[1:35:55] that's the hardest
[1:35:58] thing that's as far that's believing the
[1:36:01] report you know if somebody believe uh
[1:36:04] refuses to hear the messenger they will
[1:36:06] not hear the
[1:36:07] message have you ever had you're waiting
[1:36:10] on a letter to arrive waiting on a
[1:36:13] letter and you go out to the mailbox and
[1:36:15] oh the postman coming down the road no
[1:36:17] not this Postman I don't like this
[1:36:18] Postman he's not coming near my letter
[1:36:20] box well you're not going to get the
[1:36:22] letter yeah
[1:36:24] it's as simple as that if the postman's
[1:36:26] coming with the letter you got to let
[1:36:27] them come to your letter box when the
[1:36:29] message has been sent you've got to let
[1:36:31] the messenger come because if you nobody
[1:36:34] got on the ark who didn't hear
[1:36:36] Noah nobody came out of Egypt and
[1:36:40] entered into the promised land that
[1:36:41] didn't hear Moses nobody's going in the
[1:36:44] Rapture but those who hear the Rapture
[1:36:47] message from the vessel that the Lord
[1:36:48] has chosen which is the prophet in this
[1:36:50] day amen so without hearing the Messer
[1:36:53] they will not hear the message and
[1:36:55] brother renam says and the message is
[1:36:58] Christ John 13:20 says verily verily I
[1:37:01] say unto you Jesus said he that
[1:37:02] receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me
[1:37:06] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:37:08] that sent me all right uh and the world
[1:37:12] uh the word became flesh brother randman
[1:37:14] says here look this is just kind of
[1:37:16] finishing this thought of but um God
[1:37:18] through his prophet Isaiah a man who had
[1:37:21] his ups and downs like we do he made his
[1:37:23] mistake like we do but God got that man
[1:37:25] so yielded by being a prophet that his
[1:37:28] word God's thoughts Hallelujah God's
[1:37:29] thoughts expressed through those mortal
[1:37:31] lips of
[1:37:33] Isaiah a man with sin and things that I
[1:37:35] have and is ups and downs like I have
[1:37:38] like you have but a yielded vessel to
[1:37:40] God expressed the thought God's thought
[1:37:43] through word and no matter what he done
[1:37:45] Isaiah's words had to be fulfilled for
[1:37:47] it was God's thoughts expressed through
[1:37:51] Isaiah amen
[1:37:54] um you know all of the prophets and I'm
[1:37:56] going to try and skip over but here
[1:37:57] because this is a long study so I'm
[1:37:59] going to move as fast as I can but you
[1:38:01] stick with me um you think when when
[1:38:03] Moses came he he really was probably the
[1:38:06] perfect guy chosen for the job to go
[1:38:08] into Egypt he knew the language he knew
[1:38:12] the lay of the land he knew Pharaoh he
[1:38:14] knew the children of Israel
[1:38:16] um he you know he he was he was so
[1:38:20] educated that he could teach the
[1:38:21] Egyptians he he was just like he was
[1:38:23] ideal guy and when he came down and he
[1:38:26] when the Lord came down and met him in
[1:38:27] the burning bush and the Lord says I've
[1:38:30] seen all the trouble that's going on in
[1:38:31] Egypt and I have come down and I'm going
[1:38:33] to deliver them and Moses is probably
[1:38:34] like yeah praise the Lord that's I'm
[1:38:36] really really pleased because I because
[1:38:38] I'm glad to be out and I I hope that
[1:38:40] they they'll be glad to be out the Lord
[1:38:43] says Hey Moses I am come down to deliver
[1:38:45] them and behold I'm sending you
[1:38:48] oh that wasn't wasn't the part of the
[1:38:51] deal that Moses wanted to hear and Moses
[1:38:53] being the most capable for that job what
[1:38:56] do they
[1:38:57] say who
[1:39:00] me uh they they won't believe
[1:39:05] me you know uh who am I he says that I
[1:39:09] could go to Pharaoh well no one none of
[1:39:11] the other Israelites could go to Pharaoh
[1:39:13] could they Moses was brought up in the
[1:39:17] palace who am I but you know what it
[1:39:19] proved no matter how qualified we might
[1:39:21] think we are the the the fallibility the
[1:39:24] the inability of humanity is there
[1:39:27] unless God does the work unless God
[1:39:29] builds the house we build in vain it's
[1:39:32] God's work so he he he just said I'm not
[1:39:35] able and they said and by the way not
[1:39:37] only will Pharaoh not hear me but no nor
[1:39:40] will the children of Israel they won't
[1:39:41] believe me they will say your God has
[1:39:43] not spoken to you the Lord says I I know
[1:39:46] that so I'm going to give you two signs
[1:39:48] I gave him the sign when he put this rod
[1:39:50] down it became a snake and when he put
[1:39:51] his hand in his bosom and took it out
[1:39:53] was leis and he put it back and it came
[1:39:55] back again and of course the stick came
[1:39:57] back from the snake so he gave him two
[1:39:59] signs but brother renam says you know
[1:40:02] those signs were not the commission they
[1:40:04] only pointed they only Vindicated the
[1:40:06] prophet so that they would believe the
[1:40:09] commission and the commission was The
[1:40:10] Exodus come out of Egypt and enter into
[1:40:13] the promised land and even Moses didn't
[1:40:15] take them into the promised land but as
[1:40:17] message sure did Joshua he just
[1:40:20] continually said as the Lord God
[1:40:21] commanded Moses as the Lord God
[1:40:23] commanded of Moses Joshua didn't have
[1:40:24] any new message he just said the same
[1:40:26] thing that the prophet said and we're
[1:40:28] doing exactly the same when the prophet
[1:40:30] came in this day and he preached let
[1:40:32] just backtrack a little bit when the
[1:40:33] angel of Lord came to brother Brenham
[1:40:35] and said you're sent with a message what
[1:40:37] did Brother Brenham say they won't
[1:40:39] believe
[1:40:40] me it was just a constant the prophets
[1:40:43] all said that they won't believe me he
[1:40:44] said as Moses given two signs you'll be
[1:40:46] given two
[1:40:47] signs yeah sign in the hand and then the
[1:40:49] discernment to know what was in the
[1:40:51] hearts and he said Moses was actually
[1:40:54] given three signs and brother brandham
[1:40:56] was given three three PS to his ministry
[1:40:58] Moses the first two were unto believing
[1:41:01] those the the stick that became a snake
[1:41:04] and the hand that was leprous and was
[1:41:05] healed but he says but if they won't
[1:41:07] believe the voice of those signs and
[1:41:10] they won't hearken to your voice then
[1:41:13] take the water out of the river and pour
[1:41:14] it out and it'll become blood it was
[1:41:17] judgment it was the water of
[1:41:20] Separation because the first two un
[1:41:22] believing but if they didn't believe
[1:41:24] it's judgment brother says warning then
[1:41:27] judgment and the same things happened in
[1:41:28] the message in this day there's two
[1:41:30] signs that brother Brandon was given the
[1:41:32] the sign in the hand as I said and the
[1:41:34] discernment but if people didn't believe
[1:41:36] those signs they certainly didn't get
[1:41:38] the
[1:41:39] message the third poll is the opening of
[1:41:41] the word it's only for the Believers the
[1:41:44] Bible says that it is a secret to the to
[1:41:47] the bride the reason the secret is
[1:41:49] because everybody else has walked
[1:41:51] away and only those that stayed to look
[1:41:53] upon that pyramid Rock remember when he
[1:41:55] took the top off he said not many stayed
[1:41:58] to look amen but we've stayed to look
[1:42:01] and that's why it's a secret it wasn't
[1:42:03] that it was unavailable to everybody
[1:42:05] else but they didn't stay to look
[1:42:07] because they didn't believe the first
[1:42:09] two signs so they can't receive from the
[1:42:11] third
[1:42:13] amen ah it's it's a a mystery that's
[1:42:16] been open to us amen the little book is
[1:42:19] open in this day we're not just to look
[1:42:21] on the little book I said we need to eat
[1:42:22] the little book so that all of the
[1:42:24] goodness from that which is the Life of
[1:42:27] Christ can be made manifest through us
[1:42:29] you can't work out how it's going to
[1:42:30] work you just got to eat the little book
[1:42:33] and it'll work out brother R says don't
[1:42:35] just come this far and say I believe the
[1:42:37] message you obey the messenger whoa did
[1:42:40] he say that that's how he said it don't
[1:42:43] just come this far say I believe the
[1:42:45] message you obey the messenger come into
[1:42:47] Christ you say well I believe every word
[1:42:49] said brother Bram he said that's good
[1:42:51] but that's just being able to read take
[1:42:53] the message take it into your heart that
[1:42:55] you must have the token the very life
[1:42:57] that was in Christ be in you when I see
[1:42:59] that I will pass over you amen the life
[1:43:03] that is in the word himself the power of
[1:43:05] almighty God must come into the bride
[1:43:08] before the Rapture can take place and he
[1:43:10] says here in the rising of the sun Satan
[1:43:12] doesn't care how religious you are or
[1:43:15] how right you are in your Doctrine wow
[1:43:17] that means message Doctrine believe
[1:43:20] serpent seed believes in the see how
[1:43:22] right you are in your Doctrine if you
[1:43:24] miss that life you won't come up anyhow
[1:43:28] no matter how religious how good how
[1:43:29] many churches youve belong to or will
[1:43:31] belong to it doesn't make matter one
[1:43:33] thing unless you have been born again
[1:43:37] amen going to fog one of these Waters
[1:43:39] here is that right now one thing a lot
[1:43:43] of people don't think this way but
[1:43:45] everybody is actually a
[1:43:48] Believer and something
[1:43:55] everybody believes somebody in
[1:43:59] something because if people don't
[1:44:01] believe God's word they will believe
[1:44:03] Satan's
[1:44:04] lie when Jesus was here some believed
[1:44:08] him and some followed him and others
[1:44:10] didn't believe him but the ones that
[1:44:11] didn't believe him they did believe the
[1:44:13] scribes and
[1:44:14] Pharisees and Jesus said because I tell
[1:44:17] you the truth you do not believe me
[1:44:20] because I tell you the truth in other
[1:44:22] words if somebody comes tell you a lie
[1:44:23] you will believe that but because I tell
[1:44:26] you the truth the truth just doesn't gel
[1:44:28] with
[1:44:28] you so you can't believe
[1:44:31] it but to the to the elect it was
[1:44:35] precious amen some people are
[1:44:37] predisposed to believe the truth and
[1:44:38] some are predisposed to reject the truth
[1:44:41] and as I said earlier we don't even know
[1:44:43] of ourselves which camp we would be in
[1:44:45] until we're presented with the word and
[1:44:48] then we say you know what I believe that
[1:44:50] so well no one else around me believes
[1:44:52] but but I there's something in me I just
[1:44:54] not I hear that voice it's like man that
[1:44:56] just Rings true to me see and that's why
[1:44:59] we're here today amen but it also tells
[1:45:02] us a lot about ourselves it tells us
[1:45:03] where we come from it tells us our
[1:45:05] origin it tells us who our father is
[1:45:09] amen it tells us which camp we belong to
[1:45:12] and it shows us where we're going so I'm
[1:45:14] glad about that but believing is not
[1:45:16] just agreeing with the word you know you
[1:45:18] could meet a drunk man on the road and
[1:45:21] he's drunk as drunk can be and you can
[1:45:23] say to him that's killing you he says I
[1:45:25] believe
[1:45:29] you but it doesn't do anything about
[1:45:32] it see believing is not just agreeing if
[1:45:35] he really believed he say I need help I
[1:45:37] have to I've got to get a away from us I
[1:45:39] just never go where we're alcohol is
[1:45:42] anymore see that would be
[1:45:44] believing not just agreeing see so it's
[1:45:47] not just believing in God that's
[1:45:49] important it's believing God and
[1:45:51] believing God when he speaks through the
[1:45:53] or that he chooses to speak through amen
[1:45:55] so to believe in
[1:45:57] God Satan believes in God you the Bible
[1:46:00] says that and he trembles the Devils
[1:46:02] they believe in God and tremble so not
[1:46:04] believing in God it's very different
[1:46:06] from believ in God believing in prophets
[1:46:09] is very different from believing the
[1:46:10] prophet to believe in pastors is very
[1:46:13] different from believing your
[1:46:15] pastor to receive from the Lord we must
[1:46:17] be able to believe uh that the chosen
[1:46:20] vessel we must place our confidence
[1:46:22] confidence in the in the chosen vessel
[1:46:24] that the Lord has placed for us brother
[1:46:27] says if we don't we can't actually
[1:46:29] receive any help from that vessel I'll
[1:46:31] read it to you here he said that's the
[1:46:33] reason your pastor can't do nothing for
[1:46:34] you you've got to have faith in him this
[1:46:38] as a man remember we talked about how
[1:46:40] how fallible humanity is now maybe not
[1:46:44] brother ELR but men in general okay just
[1:46:47] think about it that that we all are that
[1:46:50] we're just we're just made the same we
[1:46:52] have the same issues to deal with the
[1:46:53] reason your pastor can't do nothing for
[1:46:55] you you've got to have faith in him and
[1:46:57] confidence in him as a man of God but I
[1:47:01] know this you've got to have confidence
[1:47:02] in the man you're dealing with or it
[1:47:04] won't do you any good to do any dealing
[1:47:07] that's true you've got to believe your
[1:47:08] pastor he's a good God saved man
[1:47:11] preaching the gospel stand behind him
[1:47:13] with everything you got if he isn't go
[1:47:15] somewhere where they do do it that's
[1:47:17] right now that clears it up for both
[1:47:18] sides now remember this if he preaches
[1:47:20] the gospel stay with him help him cuz
[1:47:22] he's a man of sent from God ordained of
[1:47:25] God to feed your soul amen we should be
[1:47:29] like uh Aaron and her you know they held
[1:47:32] up moses' hands do something actually to
[1:47:36] support the cause to let the devil know
[1:47:38] at least which side you're on Amen every
[1:47:40] now and again when something stirs your
[1:47:42] heart let the you know let it be known
[1:47:45] which side you're on brother bam says
[1:47:47] here talking about a ball game he says
[1:47:50] it's football season season the thing we
[1:47:52] want to do is not everybody try and take
[1:47:54] the ball away from the man that's got it
[1:47:56] that's right is he says try and guard
[1:47:58] that man protect him let him get through
[1:48:00] we're trying to make a goal amen so and
[1:48:03] this is not a sports game it is The Game
[1:48:05] of Life if you like but this is not a
[1:48:07] practice
[1:48:09] run this this is their one chance we
[1:48:12] want to make sure that we run this race
[1:48:15] with all that's in US amen so somebody's
[1:48:18] going to believe this report that we've
[1:48:20] received in this last days to finish
[1:48:22] this for that the Rapture can come on
[1:48:24] the Bible says that all of the rest of
[1:48:26] the saints that have gone on Hebrews 11
[1:48:28] he talks about all the ones The Heroes
[1:48:29] of Faith he says they could not be made
[1:48:31] perfect without us we have to finish
[1:48:33] this course amen the whole plan of God
[1:48:37] is is reliant on and waiting on every
[1:48:41] last member of the body of Christ to be
[1:48:44] ready yeah that's why brother brandom in
[1:48:47] the preview of the Bride he says uh stay
[1:48:49] in line stay in line he said they were
[1:48:51] starting to step out of Line Stay in
[1:48:54] line stay in line with the with the
[1:48:57] message that's been sent our part in
[1:48:59] this whole program every single one is
[1:49:03] you think what is the value of your life
[1:49:05] what what are you
[1:49:07] worth oh I've got so many dollars to my
[1:49:09] name no no that's not it brother says
[1:49:11] our life we're worth 10,000 worlds but
[1:49:16] but even if we if we valued ourselves we
[1:49:18] think we're particularly important we're
[1:49:19] 15,000 worlds
[1:49:22] okay well there's no no such thing I
[1:49:24] come on um but whatever we value our
[1:49:27] life to be it's our position is more
[1:49:30] important than that because the whole
[1:49:33] program of God is riing on every last
[1:49:37] member being
[1:49:39] ready so the weakest Christian is more
[1:49:42] important than they could possibly
[1:49:44] imagine because everybody else is
[1:49:46] waiting am and all through history
[1:49:48] they're waiting for the last one to be
[1:49:51] ready amen now is everybody still with
[1:49:54] us okay got a we way to go but where I
[1:49:57] trust this is kind of I wanted to build
[1:49:58] all that so we can say what I'm going to
[1:49:59] say now but brother B says there's only
[1:50:01] two powers and there's only two kingdoms
[1:50:03] in all of the universe only two powers
[1:50:06] and that's God's power and that's
[1:50:07] Satan's power I'll read it to you here
[1:50:08] out of the greatest battle ever 40 say
[1:50:10] do you realize that there's really only
[1:50:12] two powers in all the universe and
[1:50:13] there's only two kingdoms those Powers
[1:50:15] is God's power and Satan's power and
[1:50:16] everything that comes along is either
[1:50:18] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[1:50:20] power because that's the only two Powers
[1:50:21] there is That's The Power of life and
[1:50:24] the power of death and he says and
[1:50:25] Satan's power is is not really a real
[1:50:28] power it's a perverted
[1:50:30] power it's the perversion of God's power
[1:50:32] everything that Satan has death is only
[1:50:34] a perversion of Life Li a lie is only
[1:50:36] the truth must told adultery the
[1:50:38] righteous act misused everything that
[1:50:41] Satan has is something that was
[1:50:43] perverted but it's a power and we are
[1:50:46] today s sitting here and one or other
[1:50:49] power is going to control us amen and
[1:50:52] and God's kingdom is everything that's
[1:50:54] good and everything that's lovely and
[1:50:56] everything that's Eternal that's God's
[1:50:58] kingdom and Satan's kingdom is
[1:51:00] everything that's per perverted
[1:51:01] dishonest hateful and everything which
[1:51:03] must die two
[1:51:05] kingdoms and the moment that something
[1:51:08] fell from its original from the original
[1:51:10] word of God it fell from God's Eternal
[1:51:12] Kingdom and it
[1:51:14] fell into Satan's
[1:51:16] kingdom it fell from life to death
[1:51:24] uh Genesis 2:17 Jes uh the Lord says for
[1:51:27] the day that you eat thereof that day
[1:51:29] Thou shalt surely
[1:51:31] die it fell from being Everlasting to
[1:51:34] now death and in Romans 6 uh 16 it says
[1:51:39] know ye not that to whom you yield
[1:51:40] yourself servants to obey his servants
[1:51:42] ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin
[1:51:45] unto death or obedience unto
[1:51:47] righteousness and then down to verse 23
[1:51:49] for the wages of sin is death but the
[1:51:52] gift of God is eternal life through
[1:51:53] Jesus Christ Our Lord amen now in the
[1:51:56] Book of Ruth it talks about that there
[1:51:58] was another Kinsman closer than than the
[1:52:00] Lord another Kinsman closer than Jesus
[1:52:03] you think how can that be but the reason
[1:52:05] was that when Humanity had fallen we
[1:52:08] fell into Satan's kingdom and he said
[1:52:12] look what I got he said I all the
[1:52:15] kingdoms of the Earth are
[1:52:17] mine yeah and that's exactly the way
[1:52:19] that was Satan could rightfully claim
[1:52:22] that the mess of humanity was his doing
[1:52:24] we would say ra he had the intellectual
[1:52:27] property
[1:52:28] rights he could say I actually caused
[1:52:32] all this the mess of hybrid humanity is
[1:52:37] my fault and Satan was right it was his
[1:52:41] fault and the fact that when it when
[1:52:44] anything fell from God's kingdom it
[1:52:46] lands squarely into into Satan's kingdom
[1:52:48] and it's Outcast from the presence of
[1:52:50] God and it's destined to perish it's
[1:52:53] destined to be destroyed but before it's
[1:52:55] destroyed it falls from God's kingdom it
[1:52:57] falls into Satan's scrap Heap kingom
[1:52:59] Kingdom and it stays there until it dies
[1:53:03] till it's eliminated gone but
[1:53:05] fortunately before we got cast out we
[1:53:08] got
[1:53:09] redeemed and that's why his kingdom was
[1:53:12] there because we fell from God's kingdom
[1:53:14] we fell there he says but I'm not going
[1:53:16] to leave it there because brother R
[1:53:18] talks about the moment that Adam and Eve
[1:53:20] walked out of the Garden of Eden God
[1:53:22] called after them he says uh I'm going
[1:53:25] to put enmity
[1:53:27] between thy seed and his
[1:53:30] seed and and and he's going to he'll
[1:53:34] bruise my heel but I'll bruise his head
[1:53:36] brother says he promising a savior he
[1:53:38] couldn't let them go out without
[1:53:39] promising them I'm going to redeem this
[1:53:42] it's okay it's going to come back it's
[1:53:43] going to work out in the end all right
[1:53:47] so as I said when when the devil first
[1:53:49] started tempting Jesus he he he says you
[1:53:52] know change the stones into bread and so
[1:53:55] forth and cast your
[1:53:57] down uh the angels will pick the up and
[1:53:59] so forth but then he says all poers
[1:54:02] given unto me all poers been delivered
[1:54:05] unto me I read it here out of Luke 4:5
[1:54:08] it says the devil taketh him up to a
[1:54:09] high mountain and showed him all the
[1:54:10] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:54:12] time and the devil said unto him all
[1:54:14] power will I give thee and the glory of
[1:54:16] them for that is delivered unto me and
[1:54:19] to whomsoever I will give it the if thou
[1:54:22] therefore will worship me all shall be
[1:54:24] thine and Jesus answered and said get
[1:54:26] thee behind me Satan for it is written
[1:54:28] there shall Worship the Lord thy God and
[1:54:30] him only shalt thou
[1:54:33] serve yeah so he had fallen a to all the
[1:54:37] kingdoms of the
[1:54:39] world but when Jesus died he came to buy
[1:54:42] it back he came to redeem it and when he
[1:54:44] comes and he died on the cross and he
[1:54:47] went down into hell and he says give me
[1:54:49] the keys of hell and death and Satan
[1:54:51] says but i f an ear to
[1:54:53] it I fell ear to to all of humanity and
[1:54:57] and Jesus said yeah but I came to
[1:55:00] redeem I'm not coming just as an ear I'm
[1:55:03] coming to buy it back and I've already
[1:55:05] paid the price and I'm here to redeem
[1:55:09] what was mine in the first place and
[1:55:10] brother R says he brought back ownership
[1:55:12] of the whole world when he did that he
[1:55:14] claimed his bride but he actually
[1:55:16] claimed ownership of the whole world and
[1:55:18] that's why when it comes to the time of
[1:55:19] the Judgment he is the judge of Heaven
[1:55:22] on Earth because he owns the whole lot
[1:55:24] he bought it back now Satan was a nearer
[1:55:27] Kinsman and he had the first right of
[1:55:30] redemption and when when when Lord Jesus
[1:55:33] went down and he say give me the keys
[1:55:34] Satan could rightfully say but I'm a
[1:55:36] near Kinsman and he was but when it came
[1:55:38] to paying the price of redemption he
[1:55:40] couldn't do that firstly he didn't have
[1:55:43] a sinless life obviously the devil
[1:55:45] doesn't have a sinless life and he also
[1:55:47] couldn't pay the price because if he had
[1:55:50] given his life he couldn't raise it up
[1:55:52] again it's just like there's just no way
[1:55:54] and part of the package deal was to get
[1:55:55] the bride and she was always been a
[1:55:57] problem to Satan so he didn't want her
[1:55:59] either because it was going to Mar his
[1:56:01] kingdom which it certainly would because
[1:56:03] we've always believed in God and he
[1:56:05] doesn't like that so he said okay I
[1:56:07] can't do the redeeming I'm going to have
[1:56:09] to leave it up to you and Jesus said
[1:56:10] thank you very much and I'll take the
[1:56:11] keys of hell and death and he redeemed
[1:56:15] Us Praise the
[1:56:16] Lord all right you know brother B tells
[1:56:20] us that Satan when Jesus was even dying
[1:56:22] on the cross he he couldn't really
[1:56:24] believe who Jesus was it's like he must
[1:56:27] be just another one of the
[1:56:28] prophets you know when he was tempting
[1:56:30] him he said if there be the Son of God
[1:56:32] if there be the Son of God but when he
[1:56:33] was on the cross and he's God wouldn't
[1:56:36] let this happen to
[1:56:39] him but he was fully he's fully
[1:56:43] submitted to the heavenly father fully
[1:56:46] submitted to the Eternal will yeah and
[1:56:50] he says when he died the devil stung
[1:56:52] with the the the bee of death brother
[1:56:54] random says but then he ripped out the
[1:56:56] Stinger of death Jesus did and he says
[1:56:59] that's why Paul could say death where is
[1:57:01] you know the where is the sting and so
[1:57:03] forth It's Gone amen all right so who we
[1:57:07] believe identifies the kingdom to which
[1:57:09] we belong now it might seem an easy
[1:57:11] thing to say um why does everybody just
[1:57:14] choose life why does everybody just
[1:57:16] choose good you know everybody wants
[1:57:19] their neighbor to do good well why
[1:57:21] doesn't everybody just choose good but
[1:57:23] it's not quite there simple because the
[1:57:24] whole thing right from the beginning was
[1:57:26] that Satan is a deceiver he he perverts
[1:57:29] things and he deceives the people they
[1:57:31] actually think they're doing the right
[1:57:33] thing and Cain thought he was doing the
[1:57:34] right thing right in the beginning
[1:57:36] Satan's not an originator he just chose
[1:57:38] to pervert what God makes and the moment
[1:57:41] he perverts something he gets it think
[1:57:44] about that if he Mars it it falls to his
[1:57:47] kingdom so he's been busy doing that
[1:57:50] forever that's what he's trying to do it
[1:57:52] reminds me of a sign I saw s of that's
[1:57:55] in a shop it says lovely to look at
[1:57:57] delightful to hold if you break it
[1:57:59] consider it
[1:58:01] sold but Satan if he can ruin something
[1:58:04] he gets it it falls into his kingdom and
[1:58:07] he's been doing that all
[1:58:08] along
[1:58:10] yeah that's what he tries to do now this
[1:58:13] battle that started in heaven and is now
[1:58:15] on Earth is not about who has the
[1:58:16] greatest power and I wanted to say this
[1:58:18] so we get this this clear you think
[1:58:21] there's a battle between God and and
[1:58:22] Satan going on who is the greatest power
[1:58:25] it's not even in the
[1:58:27] equation because Satan is just a an ant
[1:58:30] compared to God it's just nothing but
[1:58:34] the thing is that the Lord set it up so
[1:58:36] it's actually an even competition it's
[1:58:39] an
[1:58:40] even battle but yet Satan has no power
[1:58:43] compared to God and it's not about who
[1:58:45] is the most powerful and I want to have
[1:58:47] a look at that just in a
[1:58:49] second the reason that that caused it to
[1:58:52] be an even battle is because something
[1:58:54] that God did himself in the beginning
[1:58:58] and what he did was he made a
[1:58:59] partnership with man brother ROM says he
[1:59:02] said you're going to be part of this
[1:59:04] equation You and
[1:59:05] Me Against
[1:59:07] him well that weakened God's argument
[1:59:12] considerably you know you make a
[1:59:14] partnership with somebody who's not very
[1:59:15] strong it weakens your position quite
[1:59:18] considerably because for God to achieve
[1:59:21] his ultimate gain
[1:59:23] uh goal he has to have every one of us
[1:59:26] elect on
[1:59:28] side and Satan's like
[1:59:31] them like you guys you you are going to
[1:59:35] be
[1:59:36] perfect before the
[1:59:38] Rapture that's what the Lord said you're
[1:59:40] going to be without spot or wrinkle or
[1:59:43] any such thing then the Rapture Satan's
[1:59:46] going like whatever no chance this is
[1:59:50] going to be easy right but God God does
[1:59:52] does he does he does he think he's
[1:59:54] stronger than God no he doesn't think
[1:59:55] he's stronger than God but he knows
[1:59:58] humanity and he thinks this is actually
[2:00:00] a pretty easy competition now and I'm in
[2:00:03] I'm going to take this fight on now
[2:00:05] because although God's his creator he
[2:00:09] thinks the argument has been so weakened
[2:00:11] because of you and me but you know what
[2:00:13] God remembers the future yeah and he
[2:00:16] looked at you and said actually they're
[2:00:18] going to stand and when the pressure
[2:00:20] when the enemy comes in like a flood is
[2:00:22] that going to raise up and be a standard
[2:00:25] like wow he already knows see Satan
[2:00:28] can't remember the future yeah but we
[2:00:31] can remember the future Lucifer when he
[2:00:33] started off he wanted to if you read
[2:00:35] Isaiah 14 it says that he wanted to
[2:00:37] exalt himself he wanted to ascend above
[2:00:40] the stars of God he wanted to be above
[2:00:42] you that's what it says in Isaiah he
[2:00:45] wanted to be like the most high but he
[2:00:46] wanted to be above you the stars of God
[2:00:49] but if you get over into Thessalonians
[2:00:51] there it says wants to actually be uh
[2:00:54] says who opposeth and exalteth himself
[2:00:56] above all that is called God or that is
[2:00:58] worshiped so that he as God sth in the
[2:01:00] temple of God showing himself that he is
[2:01:02] God oh now his real purpose is coming
[2:01:04] out he wants to be in the place of God
[2:01:06] and that's exactly what the World Church
[2:01:07] is trying to achieve amen so it's not by
[2:01:10] who's most powerful it's not by who gets
[2:01:12] the the majority of the votes god
[2:01:15] brother brandom says God don't count
[2:01:16] numbers he counts
[2:01:18] character so it's not uh what everybody
[2:01:21] else on the world is is
[2:01:22] doing it's the bride the the the
[2:01:25] position that we hold and the the the
[2:01:28] importance of this position cannot be
[2:01:31] overemphasized because the Lord has to
[2:01:33] achieve in his bride what he said he
[2:01:35] will achieve or there will be no
[2:01:40] Rapture the elect the sons of God the
[2:01:43] stars of God must and will respond to
[2:01:45] the word in their day and God has by his
[2:01:47] full knowledge he has predestinated them
[2:01:50] to that amen Jesus said of these he said
[2:01:53] I will not lose one I will not lose one
[2:01:57] everyone's going to be there and he's
[2:01:58] committed himself to that amen and
[2:02:01] brother Ram says if that genuine Holy
[2:02:03] Ghost is in you which is the word made
[2:02:05] manifest he said you'll see the message
[2:02:07] of the hour because it's the holy ghost
[2:02:09] that does it but there has to be
[2:02:11] something light that off inspiration has
[2:02:14] to strike you amen and that's taking
[2:02:16] place and I believe each one of us and I
[2:02:18] believe little sister being baptized
[2:02:20] today um just a few days ago I got a a
[2:02:23] photo that my mom actually had and it's
[2:02:26] of me when I was baptized I was seven
[2:02:28] years old brother rid s baptized me in
[2:02:31] the river in gbon and uh I know now I
[2:02:34] know as I'm coming up 59 in a couple of
[2:02:37] days time but I was sincere then as I've
[2:02:40] ever been in my life and the Lord's
[2:02:42] keeping power can keep you all the way
[2:02:45] through your life amen you commit your
[2:02:47] life into his hand you don't need to
[2:02:49] know how it all works out you don't need
[2:02:50] to be well sus all these things out just
[2:02:53] say put your life in his hands and it
[2:02:55] all works out amen all
[2:02:59] right I'm going to just skip ah head a
[2:03:01] little bit
[2:03:06] here yes so Satan thinks of this the
[2:03:08] Lord's never going to be able to do this
[2:03:11] but
[2:03:13] um the Lord's already seen the picture
[2:03:16] he's already seen you he's already seen
[2:03:18] the sons of God shouting for Joy saying
[2:03:20] praise God we here oh praise God it's
[2:03:23] great to see you again I knew we'd be
[2:03:25] here job and everybody else because the
[2:03:28] Lord says Jo Where Were You When the
[2:03:29] sons of God shattered for Joy job say I
[2:03:32] don't remember that but uh
[2:03:34] yeah God seen it amen God always
[2:03:38] intended brother Bram STS to dwell in
[2:03:42] mankind there was always his intention
[2:03:45] it was God above us the Creator it
[2:03:47] became when Jesus came god with us but
[2:03:49] he wants to be God in us he wants to
[2:03:51] have the preeminence in us and the
[2:03:54] prophet says that Satan knew that from
[2:03:55] the beginning that God wanted to dwell
[2:03:58] in humanity and Satan being a copycat he
[2:04:01] wanted to do the same but he couldn't
[2:04:03] get into
[2:04:04] Humanity Satan couldn't he could get
[2:04:07] into animals which he did through the
[2:04:08] serpent like he did at the swine at
[2:04:11] gadara but he couldn't get into
[2:04:14] Humanity so God somehow let Satan learn
[2:04:17] about the fact that he could get into
[2:04:18] the
[2:04:19] animals and that's where Satan come up
[2:04:21] with this plan in the Garden of Eden he
[2:04:24] said if I can make them both human and
[2:04:27] animal I can get into them and that's
[2:04:30] what he did so when he inspired the
[2:04:33] serpent to interbreed with Humanity all
[2:04:36] from then on all of humanity has been
[2:04:39] part animal and part human and Satan has
[2:04:42] been able to get into that Fallen
[2:04:45] Humanity ever since it made a pathway
[2:04:48] that he could get in brother R it says
[2:04:51] in a message it's Ephesian Church age
[2:04:52] now Man was created for God man was to
[2:04:55] be the temple of God the place of God's
[2:04:57] rest that's what we was supposed to be
[2:04:59] the place of God's rest if I just say
[2:05:01] this brother ad says that in the
[2:05:03] Millennium Lord Jesus going to sit on
[2:05:05] his own throne but the Bible says that
[2:05:06] right now he sits on his father's throne
[2:05:09] and then brother BR says you know where
[2:05:10] his father's Throne is is in the human
[2:05:12] heart that's where he wants to dwell
[2:05:15] through the church ages he wants to be
[2:05:17] in the human heart amen and since the
[2:05:20] opening of the seals he you being able
[2:05:22] to do that that's where he wants to be
[2:05:24] to resting in the human heart Satan has
[2:05:27] known this all along and he wants to
[2:05:28] indwell man I'm going to read this quote
[2:05:30] here to you even as God does but God has
[2:05:34] reserved to himself that right Satan
[2:05:36] cannot do that God Alone appeared in
[2:05:38] human flesh which was in Jesus Satan
[2:05:40] could could not and cannot do that he
[2:05:43] does not have creative Powers he Satan
[2:05:45] can't make a body for himself to step
[2:05:46] into like Jesus did the only way for
[2:05:50] Satan to accomplish what he wanted was
[2:05:52] uh wanted to do was to enter into the
[2:05:55] serpent in Eden even as he entered by
[2:05:58] the evil spirits into the swine at
[2:06:00] gadara God does not enter into animals
[2:06:02] but Satan can and will to accomplish his
[2:06:05] ends he uh Satan could not have a child
[2:06:08] directly by Eve as God did by Mary so he
[2:06:11] entered into the serpent and then
[2:06:12] beguiled Eve and seduced her and by her
[2:06:15] did Satan have a child
[2:06:18] vicariously Satan uh Cain was born the
[2:06:22] full spiritual characteristics of Satan
[2:06:24] and the animalistic sensual fleshly
[2:06:27] characteristics of the serpent now
[2:06:29] wonder the holy spirit said that Cain
[2:06:31] was of the wicked one he
[2:06:33] was all right now Cain was actually a
[2:06:37] Believer he believed in God he spoke to
[2:06:40] God he didn't believe
[2:06:44] God yeah um and I read just a couple
[2:06:47] more things it's quite an important
[2:06:48] little part I want to get to here so I
[2:06:50] know it's a little bit longer and I said
[2:06:51] to brother it's a little bit of a longer
[2:06:53] study but stick with me I trust you'll
[2:06:54] be
[2:06:56] blessed I normally preach pretty short
[2:06:58] so I'm sorry I this a little bit longer
[2:07:00] than normal but I I want to get to this
[2:07:02] um this point here and I trust that's a
[2:07:04] blessing to you so just as Cain and Abel
[2:07:07] they also came together in a clash
[2:07:08] brother R says and them being Brothers
[2:07:10] both of them came of the same mother and
[2:07:12] we find that they realized that they
[2:07:14] were mortal they've been put out of life
[2:07:16] and put out of the garden of life and
[2:07:18] they were both trying to find a way to
[2:07:20] get back in there both Abel Cain and
[2:07:23] Abel were both trying to find how can I
[2:07:25] get back to life cuz I'm getting old I'm
[2:07:28] hey this this is this is not going to
[2:07:29] work we're going to die at this rate we
[2:07:31] got to find a way to get back so both
[2:07:33] finding a way to get back if you notice
[2:07:35] both boys were very religious Cain was
[2:07:37] just as religious as Abel was they both
[2:07:39] built altars otherwise a church they
[2:07:41] both made a sacrifice they both prayed
[2:07:42] they both served God both of them but
[2:07:44] one of them served him wrong he says now
[2:07:47] you can be ever so sincere and yet be
[2:07:49] wrong there's a way that seeth right but
[2:07:51] the end the D the ways of death and then
[2:07:53] if we read in Genesis it says the Lord
[2:07:55] had respect unto Abel unto his offering
[2:07:56] but unto Canaan his offering he had not
[2:07:58] respect and Cain was very wroth and his
[2:08:01] countenance fell and the Lord said unto
[2:08:03] Cain why art th wroth and why is our
[2:08:05] countenance Fallen if thou doest well
[2:08:08] shall thou not be accepted and if thou
[2:08:10] doest not well sin lith at the door so
[2:08:13] Cain firstly he was very religious he
[2:08:15] believed in God the one true and living
[2:08:19] God the creator of Heaven and Earth he
[2:08:20] was the first to sacrifice to God he was
[2:08:23] sincere he made an offering that was
[2:08:24] beautiful he put a lot of effort into it
[2:08:26] he was he did it sincerely he built this
[2:08:29] altar to the Lord but when the Lord
[2:08:31] didn't appreciate his sacrifice and his
[2:08:34] offering he was very very upset he
[2:08:36] couldn't understand why that would be
[2:08:38] but then just to make matters worse he
[2:08:40] says his brother is offering he's
[2:08:42] setting up his altar his church and he's
[2:08:45] going to make a sacrifice to the Lord
[2:08:47] and he watches on and he sees his
[2:08:49] brother going and get a little lamb
[2:08:52] out of the flock a beautiful little lamb
[2:08:54] a perfect little lamb yeah and he ties
[2:08:57] it
[2:08:58] up and he puts it on his Altar and
[2:09:00] Kane's like what's he
[2:09:02] doing and then he
[2:09:04] sees Abel get a sharp Stone and hack at
[2:09:08] this lamb on its
[2:09:10] throat and Blood starts spting out and
[2:09:13] blood's going every he's like what are
[2:09:15] you doing what are you doing this the
[2:09:18] first time they'd ever seen anything die
[2:09:20] something had died previous cuz that's
[2:09:22] where Adam and Eve got the skins that
[2:09:24] God clothes them in but it's the first
[2:09:26] time and you know the message that we
[2:09:28] believe is this horrific to other
[2:09:30] people he sees and he's cutting his
[2:09:33] throat blood's going it would have gone
[2:09:35] all over Abel and I think Abel would
[2:09:37] have been crying because it was it was a
[2:09:40] sad thing that Abel was realizing that
[2:09:43] his
[2:09:44] sins were being there was a sacrifice
[2:09:47] being made on his behalf for his sin by
[2:09:50] the life of an innocent substitute yeah
[2:09:54] and he say probably is crying saying but
[2:09:58] God has revealed to me that this is his
[2:10:01] way and this is his plan that an
[2:10:03] innocent substitute had to die in my
[2:10:06] place and
[2:10:08] Cain he was speechless he was just that
[2:10:11] is the most horrific thing I've ever
[2:10:13] seen in my
[2:10:14] life and then if that wasn't bad enough
[2:10:18] then God comes down
[2:10:21] and God says
[2:10:23] Abel I accept your
[2:10:26] sacrifice I have respect for that your
[2:10:29] sins are
[2:10:30] covered you did the right
[2:10:33] thing and he walks straight past Cain's
[2:10:35] offering and says
[2:10:37] nothing and Cain is beside himself with
[2:10:40] anger he's angry at God he's angry at
[2:10:43] his brother he's so frustrated look look
[2:10:46] at my beautiful sacrifice and his a mess
[2:10:49] and everybody's covered in blood and and
[2:10:51] the lamb was bleeding and kicking and
[2:10:55] died it seemed like the genuine message
[2:10:58] was
[2:10:59] horrific but it was the
[2:11:01] truth and it delivered
[2:11:04] him and that was the part that God
[2:11:06] because God accepted that that seemed to
[2:11:08] be the hardest thing Cain went away in a
[2:11:11] rage but then after a little while he
[2:11:13] thought and brother R says he did think
[2:11:15] on the thought of coming back to God and
[2:11:18] God said to him if you just do what your
[2:11:20] brother has done won't you also be
[2:11:23] accepted and the prophet tells us that
[2:11:25] God would have accepted him if he had
[2:11:27] come that way he says Cain was very
[2:11:30] religious and he thought on the thought
[2:11:31] of coming back to God and God was
[2:11:33] willing to receive him back but Cain
[2:11:35] wanted to come his way and God wanted
[2:11:37] him to come his way we find out there
[2:11:40] was a conflict completely with them amen
[2:11:43] and the Lord said to Kain if you don't
[2:11:46] do what your brother has done if you
[2:11:48] don't come that way he said sin Li at
[2:11:51] the door now we could say that every one
[2:11:53] of us Prophet tells us we're born in sin
[2:11:55] shaped in in iniquity come into the
[2:11:57] world speaking lies and Kane certainly
[2:11:59] was that he was a liar he said to God
[2:12:01] you know God said where's where's your
[2:12:02] brother he said I don't know so he knew
[2:12:04] of course he'd killed him but so he was
[2:12:06] all that but the sin that lith at the
[2:12:08] door that was not what the Lord was
[2:12:09] talking about that sin he was saying sin
[2:12:12] is unbelief right he said if you turn
[2:12:15] down the Vindicated
[2:12:17] word then there will come a time where
[2:12:19] you've crossed the line and you never
[2:12:21] even believe anymore you won't be able
[2:12:24] to believe anymore and that's exactly
[2:12:27] what Cain did because the moment that he
[2:12:29] he saw that that what Abel had was the
[2:12:32] Vindicated word for the hour God came
[2:12:34] down and proved
[2:12:36] it there was no doubt in Cain's in
[2:12:38] Cain's mind that that God had accepted
[2:12:40] Abel's sacrifice but he said but I'm not
[2:12:43] going to do it and he was cast out from
[2:12:45] the presence of the Lord Brother said
[2:12:47] the mark of the beast was put on him
[2:12:48] right then he was cast out of the pres
[2:12:51] of God forever because he crossed the
[2:12:53] line he saw the Vindicator word of the
[2:12:55] hour and said I'm not going to do it and
[2:12:58] that sin that was lying at the door then
[2:13:00] became a reality he goes out he kills
[2:13:02] his brother he he walks out he doesn't
[2:13:05] even believe God anymore God could speak
[2:13:06] to him he doesn't believe a word of it
[2:13:08] he said I'm going to make my own church
[2:13:09] and that's what he did and this should
[2:13:11] be good
[2:13:13] enough that's and that's the way that he
[2:13:15] went Cain thought that he was
[2:13:18] right he thought that he'd done all his
[2:13:21] religion he went to church he said his
[2:13:22] prayers he paid his ties he did a few
[2:13:24] extra dollars here he belonged to to the
[2:13:27] one the fine Church all a beautiful
[2:13:29] flowers and everything that's the way
[2:13:30] the devil's got the church
[2:13:33] today there a scripture says because
[2:13:36] they receive not the love of the truth
[2:13:38] that they might be saved for this cause
[2:13:40] God shall send a strong delusion that
[2:13:42] they should believe a lie that they all
[2:13:43] might be damned to believe not the truth
[2:13:45] but had pleasure and
[2:13:48] unrighteousness the prophet says that
[2:13:50] Kan he went out uh seek uh he went out a
[2:13:52] willful sinner a willful sin he
[2:13:55] deliberately went out from the presence
[2:13:57] of Lord after it been Vindicated and
[2:13:58] then he says here and the true Easter
[2:14:00] seal Cain as much said here's what I've
[2:14:02] put together this is what I've got
[2:14:05] here's what I give you take this or
[2:14:07] leave this either one you want to do you
[2:14:09] just suit yourself that say he's talking
[2:14:10] to God that's the kind of attitude of
[2:14:13] people all the time in church life the
[2:14:15] Propet says they go to church I'll go to
[2:14:17] church I'll help the church I'll do this
[2:14:19] and if God can't accept that that's the
[2:14:21] best I can do take it or leave
[2:14:24] it
[2:14:28] w those people when they when they see
[2:14:31] The Vindicator word for this day and
[2:14:33] walk away from it you think how come
[2:14:35] people walk away from the message and
[2:14:37] they never come back because they cross
[2:14:40] a line that's if it's been proved by God
[2:14:43] and then they walk away from I'm not
[2:14:44] willing to do that the cross line now
[2:14:46] that's not backsliding and I'll just
[2:14:48] look at that in a
[2:14:49] second but here in John uh
[2:14:52] 12:37 speaking of Jesus said though he
[2:14:54] had done so many miracles before them
[2:14:56] yet they believed not on him that the
[2:14:58] saying of oah the Prophet might be
[2:14:59] fulfilled when he spake Lord who hath
[2:15:01] believed our report and to whom hath the
[2:15:04] arm of the Lord been revealed remember
[2:15:06] Nicodemus said we know that there are a
[2:15:08] teacher come from God that's a Sanhedrin
[2:15:11] they knew the people they knew that it
[2:15:13] was the The Miracles and so forth were
[2:15:16] of
[2:15:18] God but a willful sinner and they
[2:15:21] crossed the line they could not
[2:15:24] believe brother R says here ministers
[2:15:27] whoever you are I say this with Godly
[2:15:29] love you see it you know it's the truth
[2:15:31] and turn away from it he said there
[2:15:33] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but
[2:15:35] a fearful looking for the judgment and
[2:15:37] the fiery indignation which shall Devour
[2:15:39] the adversary a man came to brother
[2:15:41] brandom says but I know it's right
[2:15:43] brother Brandon but if I did that I'd
[2:15:44] get kicked out of my church he said what
[2:15:46] of it he said if you don't they're going
[2:15:49] to kick you out up there so you've got
[2:15:50] to be kicked out
[2:15:52] somewhere so we're making a choice
[2:15:54] that's what we're
[2:15:59] doing all
[2:16:02] right so the whole world right now is
[2:16:06] waiting for the final we're waiting for
[2:16:09] the the final outcome of this whole
[2:16:11] battle and we're in the
[2:16:14] middle excuse me we're in the middle of
[2:16:16] it we we we cannot escape and say I just
[2:16:20] don't want to I just don't want to be
[2:16:23] involved because we're
[2:16:25] involved but yet the prophet tells us
[2:16:27] that the bride a manifestation of the
[2:16:31] power you know it said who hath believed
[2:16:33] their report and to whom is the arm of
[2:16:35] the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord is
[2:16:37] the power of almighty God because it's
[2:16:39] his life on display brother said that is
[2:16:42] going to be displayed in the bride just
[2:16:44] before the
[2:16:45] Rapture the power of almighty God is
[2:16:48] going to be displayed he said
[2:16:51] the Earth is crying and groaning waiting
[2:16:52] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:16:55] the world is waiting for the man to come
[2:16:58] back to his right estate and then in
[2:17:00] praying here in the indictment he
[2:17:02] says may there come forth a Revival of
[2:17:05] the just says 963 and the power come
[2:17:09] among the church just before it's going
[2:17:11] it's not hard to pray that because you
[2:17:13] promised it and we're looking Lord for
[2:17:15] that third pole that we know will do
[2:17:17] great things for us in our midst amen
[2:17:21] and brother renon when he's talking
[2:17:22] about the third pole here he's not
[2:17:23] talking about the opening of the word
[2:17:24] which happened in 1963 he's talking
[2:17:26] about the manifestation of the third
[2:17:28] pole which was the spoken word back in
[2:17:31] humanity again the creative power of
[2:17:33] Jehovah God was manifest to us through a
[2:17:37] man that's the power that's the arm of
[2:17:40] the Lord being made manifest that's the
[2:17:41] arm of the Lord being revealed in a
[2:17:43] human vessel creation when he spoke
[2:17:45] Scrolls into existence who creates but
[2:17:48] God but he said but when you say with
[2:17:50] the squirrels will be and that's where
[2:17:52] they'll be said I'll have a squirrel
[2:17:53] over there have another one over there
[2:17:54] another one over there the squirrels
[2:17:56] came into existence the creative power
[2:17:58] of Jehovah God the resurrection little
[2:18:01] fish he says you speak to the little
[2:18:03] fish and give it back its life brother R
[2:18:06] says little fishy in the name of Jesus
[2:18:08] Christ to give you back your life thing
[2:18:09] flipped over it insides came in went
[2:18:12] back inside again and it swam off it
[2:18:14] went like
[2:18:15] that each of these things control of
[2:18:18] nature he says you speak to the storm
[2:18:20] storm go
[2:18:23] away let the sun shine for 4 days till
[2:18:25] we get out of here and that's the way it
[2:18:26] took place salvation for hot's two sons
[2:18:30] and the miracle healing for sister media
[2:18:31] from the tumor before the doctor's hand
[2:18:33] touches her the tumor will be gone and
[2:18:35] that's why it was I want to say this
[2:18:37] though each one of those manifestations
[2:18:39] five manifestations of the the spoken
[2:18:42] word in a human vessel brother REM says
[2:18:45] it was just done so that it would
[2:18:47] identify it its present but it won't be
[2:18:49] used in a great way until until the
[2:18:51] squeeze comes on and just before the
[2:18:53] catching away then the power the arm of
[2:18:55] almighty God will be manifest in the
[2:18:57] bride amen we're right on the brink of
[2:19:00] that now we're right there but each time
[2:19:02] there they were sovereignly given yes
[2:19:06] brother Bram didn't look at the little
[2:19:07] fish and go I feel sorry for the little
[2:19:08] fish and I'll pray maybe the Lord will
[2:19:10] no absolutely not it was absolutely
[2:19:12] sovereignly given because the mind was
[2:19:15] not the mind of a man the mind was the
[2:19:17] mind of God he was identifying a uh uh
[2:19:20] something that is a reality he says it's
[2:19:22] just being it's been done now so it's
[2:19:24] identified it's in
[2:19:26] existence but it won't be used in a
[2:19:28] great way until just before the catching
[2:19:30] away amen that's the full manifestation
[2:19:33] of the sons of God that's what we're
[2:19:35] looking for that's why you know when it
[2:19:37] says in the uh in the great white Throne
[2:19:40] judgment says that the bride sits with
[2:19:41] him with him in his
[2:19:43] throne that means that she actually is
[2:19:46] the judge with him of Heaven and Earth
[2:19:51] that sounds like the arm of God to me
[2:19:54] the power and the justice of almighty
[2:19:57] God it's vested in his bride Amen
[2:20:00] brother REM says oh if the church only
[2:20:02] knew its position that's right it will
[2:20:04] one day when the manifestation of the
[2:20:06] third Paul happens it'll be obvious who
[2:20:08] you
[2:20:09] are absolutely it will one day it's not
[2:20:12] so it might happen no if the church only
[2:20:15] knew its position it will one day then
[2:20:17] the Rapture will go when it knows what
[2:20:19] it is and when that manifest
[2:20:21] of the third pole or of the spoken word
[2:20:23] takes place in the bride I can tell you
[2:20:25] what the five foolish virgin will come
[2:20:27] knocking on your door so we want that
[2:20:31] oil but right now they
[2:20:34] don't but the same word that has that
[2:20:37] power is what we're feeding on that's
[2:20:40] the body word that we're feeding on it
[2:20:42] has that power in it but he says it's
[2:20:43] not going to be used in a great way to
[2:20:45] right at the end the full manifestation
[2:20:47] of who is and who isn't is going to be
[2:20:49] made known at that time amen we want to
[2:20:51] make sure we're inside the ark when the
[2:20:54] door closes on the ark because the five
[2:20:56] foolish virgin are going to say hey give
[2:20:58] us that oil we'll say it's on the
[2:21:00] tapes go and go and you know get it for
[2:21:03] yourself
[2:21:05] amen all right I think the right at this
[2:21:08] moment we're just coming towards the
[2:21:09] close now we're finally getting there
[2:21:11] but um right at this time the five
[2:21:15] foolish virgin think that the five wise
[2:21:18] virgins are a little bit too precious
[2:21:20] about the
[2:21:22] message you just take it too seriously
[2:21:25] it's life and
[2:21:26] death you know when the Bible talks
[2:21:28] about those that go out weeping and
[2:21:31] wailing nashing of teeth that's that's
[2:21:34] the foolish virgin that's not the lost
[2:21:37] that's the the foolish virgin go they go
[2:21:39] out weeping and wailing and nashing of
[2:21:41] teeth CU they know they had the message
[2:21:43] in their hand and they let it slip
[2:21:45] away and the only place for them to be
[2:21:48] for the Thousand Years the rest of the
[2:21:49] Dead live not for th years is in Hell
[2:21:52] brother Brandon brings that there's no
[2:21:53] other place for them to be and that's
[2:21:55] why when it comes to judgment they are
[2:21:57] actually given eternal life in the end
[2:21:59] they come up in the judgment and it says
[2:22:01] the righteous come up with the wicked to
[2:22:04] the Judgment but it's not the bride
[2:22:06] because the bride's with Christ in the
[2:22:08] throne so those that some of them
[2:22:10] that'll come up they are actually
[2:22:11] righteous they will be given eternal
[2:22:13] life at that time but in the meantime
[2:22:15] there's nowhere else for them to be
[2:22:17] because the bride's gone on the Rapture
[2:22:20] and and Armageddon will be here 3 and a
[2:22:22] half years later which kills all things
[2:22:25] nothing lives through that the prophet
[2:22:26] said so just remember the third pole in
[2:22:30] Noah's time the door was closed on the
[2:22:32] ark so we said we'd like to see the
[2:22:34] manifestation of the third pole but when
[2:22:35] it does it's it the door's closed so now
[2:22:39] is the hour of Salvation little sister
[2:22:40] giving a heart to the Lord and being
[2:22:42] baptized so praise the Lord the door's
[2:22:43] still open but it's probably starting to
[2:22:47] squeak on its hinges because it's it's
[2:22:50] time is running out when Jesus his third
[2:22:52] pole is preaching to the souls in prison
[2:22:55] they couldn't be saved amen time had run
[2:22:57] out for them so I just want to say as we
[2:23:01] close let let's not be on that side of
[2:23:03] the Ledger let's make sure that we do
[2:23:06] everything we can to say I believe his
[2:23:08] word I don't just say I agree with his
[2:23:10] word I believe it I want that to come
[2:23:12] into me have an outworking and
[2:23:14] everything in my life everything is will
[2:23:16] completely sold out the bride has no
[2:23:18] mind of her own but his mind
[2:23:21] what he says his word that goes and if
[2:23:23] we have that attitude because it is all
[2:23:25] really about attitude if we have the
[2:23:28] right attitude to his word it will do
