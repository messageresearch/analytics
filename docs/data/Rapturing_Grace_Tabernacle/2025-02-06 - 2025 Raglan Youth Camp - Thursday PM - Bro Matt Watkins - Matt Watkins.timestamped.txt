[46:51] open our hearts before the Lord I want
[46:54] to say you know this this morning we had
[46:56] the introduction service but tonight is
[46:59] the first first proper service and uh
[47:03] and I want to
[47:04] say open your hearts Amen Let the Lord
[47:07] come and touch you amen I want to say
[47:11] maybe maybe there's someone sitting here
[47:13] and and saying well I'm not ready to
[47:15] open my heart yet and and I want to say
[47:18] tonight I'm praying for you amen praying
[47:22] that the Lord gives you the the desire
[47:24] to open your heart amen that the Lord
[47:26] give the desire to let go that the Lord
[47:28] gives you the the desire to have a
[47:31] closer walk with him amen I want to say
[47:34] I pray for you tonight that that the
[47:36] Lord will give you Grace to look away
[47:38] from what others do what others say
[47:43] their
[47:43] attitudes their complexes your attitudes
[47:47] your complexes amen I'm going to say
[47:51] tonight may the Lord get a hold of your
[47:53] he if he doesn't already have and mean I

[47:58] items and and I really appreciate that I
[48:01] just want to repeat this the words of
[48:03] that last
[48:04] [Music]

[48:08] reality needs Grace they're saying now
[48:11] I'm giving my life away laying it down
[48:14] on the altar that means dying out to
[48:16] self dying out to our own ideas your own
[48:20] complexes dying out to the
[48:23] Past dying out to to all sorts of
[48:27] influences in our lives dying out to to
[48:31] habits and to to bef falling sins and
[48:34] things that we very often hold on to
[48:37] that we don't want to let go you know
[48:39] very often the problem is that we
[48:41] actually don't want to let those things
[48:43] go and and as I said I'm pray praying
[48:45] for you tonight that the Lord will give
[48:48] you the want to let it go amen that the

[49:10] and as I'm praying I know this is the
[49:12] start of the service not the end of the
[49:14] service but as I'm praying I'm going to
[49:15] ask you and and I'm going to invite you
[49:19] to walk with me into this spirit and say

[1:00:02] Revelation Lord father that the world
[1:00:05] doesn't have but we have it here tonight
[1:00:07] we're thankful bless every heart Lord we
[1:00:10] pray we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[1:00:13] amen you love him this this evening amen
[1:00:16] God bless you if you have your Bible and
[1:00:18] they could just you could turn me down
[1:00:20] just a little bit Brother Joseph little
[1:00:22] bit hot up here on the monitor but
[1:00:24] that's all right Isaiah chap 52 if you
[1:00:27] have your your Bible amen we'll just
[1:00:30] turn uh to Isaiah chapter 52 amen do you
[1:00:34] love the Lord Jesus amen how many came
[1:00:37] with an expectation upon your heart amen
[1:00:40] and and I just believe the Lord will
[1:00:41] meet that need we just want to say again
[1:00:44] God bless you and uh certainly just an
[1:00:46] honor to be here with you and I trust
[1:00:49] that um you came with a real desire to
[1:00:51] see the Lord and uh and a hunger and
[1:00:54] thirst for righteousness I believe the
[1:00:56] Bible says that they that hunger for it
[1:00:58] shall be filled and so God is the god of
[1:01:01] filling amen emptying out is what we
[1:01:04] have to do but filling is his job amen
[1:01:08] and so as long as we can empty God can
[1:01:10] fill amen the uh the the fullness of the
[1:01:14] Living God Waits on an empty vessel so
[1:01:17] how many just want to say Lord I empty
[1:01:19] out everything so that you can fill me
[1:01:22] amen Isaiah chapter 52 and I just want
[1:01:25] want to um go straight here to the word
[1:01:28] still just a little bit uh boomy up here
[1:01:32] just a little bit you could turn that
[1:01:33] down Isaiah chapter
[1:01:36] 52 I want to just um uh read from Isaiah
[1:01:40] chapter 52 and then we'll have you be
[1:01:42] seated and I have a few of the things
[1:01:43] that I want to read but first we'll to
[1:01:46] start here the Lord just um moved on my
[1:01:49] heart as I was just waiting on him this
[1:01:51] afternoon and had prepared a a way that
[1:01:54] we would go um and and wasn't really uh
[1:01:58] planning to go the direction I'm going
[1:02:00] here tonight but the Holy Spirit just
[1:02:02] stopped me and I'm going to uh just obey
[1:02:04] him are you glad say brother Matt obey
[1:02:07] obey the Lord you know God can just stop
[1:02:10] you in your track sometimes and and take
[1:02:12] you a totally different direction and so
[1:02:15] that's all right we just we surrender to
[1:02:17] him amen he knows what's best his way is
[1:02:20] always the right way Amen brother bradam
[1:02:23] said our way is always the wrong way
[1:02:26] and so we just want to take his way
[1:02:29] Isaiah chapter
[1:02:31] 52 I'm just going to give this a very
[1:02:34] simple title here and I'm going to title
[1:02:36] this the choices that we make the
[1:02:38] choices that we make Isaiah chapter 52
[1:02:42] and we'll just begin reading here at
[1:02:43] verse one awake awake put on thy
[1:02:49] strength oh Zion put on thy beautiful
[1:02:52] garments oh Jerusalem the holy City for
[1:02:57] henceforth there shall no more come into
[1:02:59] Thee the uncircumcised and the
[1:03:03] unclean notice these powerful words here
[1:03:06] I believe that scripture sometimes can
[1:03:08] just be so gripping if we just read it
[1:03:11] in the way that God spoke it through
[1:03:13] this prophet and he says here Shake
[1:03:17] yourself from the dust arise and sit
[1:03:22] down oh
[1:03:23] Jerusalem notice the colon there because
[1:03:26] this is always conditionalizing
[1:03:28] something this is God's way of making a
[1:03:31] promise or making a option you could say
[1:03:34] to that to the uh the person that he was
[1:03:37] speaking to he says here uh let's read
[1:03:40] it again Shake thyself from the dust and
[1:03:42] sit down oh Jerusalem loose
[1:03:47] thyself from the bands of thy neck how
[1:03:51] many know that sometimes there's things
[1:03:53] that God has to free us from other times
[1:03:58] God gives you the key and he needs you
[1:04:01] to Free
[1:04:02] Yourself you see there's some things
[1:04:05] some banss that we put on ourself that
[1:04:09] God didn't or nor the devil put upon us
[1:04:12] and so God says here this is typing the
[1:04:14] daughter notice who he's speaking of
[1:04:16] here this is the daughter of Jerusalem
[1:04:20] it's not a heathen this is actually
[1:04:22] God's family he says Shake Yourself and
[1:04:26] from the dust and arise and sit down old
[1:04:29] Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands
[1:04:32] of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion
[1:04:38] for thus saith the Lord you have sold
[1:04:40] yourself for not for nothing and you
[1:04:43] shall be redeemed without money for thus
[1:04:46] saith the Lord my God my people went
[1:04:49] down a four time into Egypt to sojourn
[1:04:51] there and the Assyrian oppressed them
[1:04:54] without cause
[1:04:56] Lord we just bow our heads here tonight
[1:04:58] in great need of you once again Lord
[1:05:01] needing father a Special Touch from you
[1:05:04] Lord for we've have a a task that is
[1:05:07] before us Lord that without you would be
[1:05:10] impossible Lord for it's possible for me
[1:05:13] to say things Lord that maybe would
[1:05:17] sound good to some and intellectually we
[1:05:19] could agree with it and we can make
[1:05:21] points Lord that would maybe make us
[1:05:24] laugh or make us cry Lord but what good
[1:05:28] does that do us if it only stays in that
[1:05:30] emotional realm Lord I could say things
[1:05:33] tonight father in the words that I speak
[1:05:35] Maybe by this time next year or maybe
[1:05:38] just a few months from now people would
[1:05:40] struggle to even remember my title let
[1:05:43] alone the substance of what I said Lord
[1:05:46] for that's the weakness and the
[1:05:47] shallowness of men's words but oh Lord
[1:05:51] if you would
[1:05:52] speak and if your voice could be heard
[1:05:55] and the souls and The Echoes of of your
[1:05:58] word could echo down through the souls
[1:06:01] of men and women young adults Lord God
[1:06:05] then I believe that it could have such
[1:06:06] an effect it could change us eternally
[1:06:09] Lord I pray God that you would come now
[1:06:11] and take your Divine wisdom divine
[1:06:14] inspiration Divine leadership Lord I
[1:06:18] make myself now subservient to you Lord
[1:06:21] to your spirit father I just lay aside
[1:06:25] my thoughts and my ideas Lord and I'm
[1:06:28] just a vessel waiting to be used by you
[1:06:31] I pray Lord that every heart Lord that's
[1:06:33] here God every mother who sent their
[1:06:36] children and father who sent their
[1:06:38] children and or who no no doubt are
[1:06:39] praying with an expectation and a prayer
[1:06:42] Lord for that young person father may
[1:06:45] all Heaven move upon the prayers of that
[1:06:48] Faith Lord I pray that you would come
[1:06:50] and shield us Lord from the thoughts of
[1:06:53] the enemy Shield us Lord and take us up
[1:06:55] into that strong tower where we can run
[1:06:57] into and are safe Lord and may every
[1:07:00] heart father be pricked by the word that
[1:07:02] is spoken tonight father I pray that you
[1:07:05] would have your way in all things we ask
[1:07:07] it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can
[1:07:10] be
[1:07:24] seated I want you you just to keep your
[1:07:26] place just for a moment in Isaiah
[1:07:29] chapter 52 and then I'll have you also
[1:07:31] turn to the Book of Judges I'm
[1:07:33] ministering to you tonight on choices
[1:07:36] that we
[1:07:37] make you know life is such an amazing
[1:07:40] thing and you get this from the
[1:07:42] perspective uh different perspectives of
[1:07:44] life this just Dawns on you in such a
[1:07:47] different way than it did when I was
[1:07:49] maybe some of your age and at at my age
[1:07:53] now I could even say that the
[1:07:54] perspective that my father has is even a
[1:07:57] greater uh in a greater way than what
[1:07:59] I'm about to say but life has a way to
[1:08:02] teach you that it's very fleeting and
[1:08:05] it's very short and it's actually life
[1:08:08] that you think will just go on and and
[1:08:11] and go on and go on and there'll just be
[1:08:13] more years to your life you really get a
[1:08:16] sense for the the the shortness and the
[1:08:19] the fry that you have here in in this
[1:08:22] part of your existence and actually it's
[1:08:25] through a lot of things that happen
[1:08:28] maybe not always good but sometimes
[1:08:30] through sorrow and through trouble you
[1:08:33] realize that life is really just a life
[1:08:35] of struggle and it's a life of of
[1:08:38] endless Doom without the Lord Jesus and
[1:08:42] all pleasure that you could have and joy
[1:08:44] that you can have without the Lord and
[1:08:46] apart from the Lord is so shallow it's
[1:08:49] such a just a shallow veneer of of
[1:08:52] happiness and and and joy I believe that
[1:08:56] real contentment and real true happiness
[1:08:59] only comes to a
[1:09:01] Christian and you know I believe that
[1:09:03] it's amazing because life we understand
[1:09:06] it and the Bible even teaches us that
[1:09:08] that it's this way that it's a journey
[1:09:11] you notice in your Bible it starts with
[1:09:13] a journey a man named Abram who leaves
[1:09:16] the land of everything that he ever knew
[1:09:18] and everything that he had ever learned
[1:09:20] and everything that he thought was
[1:09:22] normal his mother his father his
[1:09:24] belongings his life everything he had
[1:09:27] worked for and yet God told him I want
[1:09:29] you to get up from this land Abram and I
[1:09:32] want you to sojourn means to start a
[1:09:35] journey I'm not going to tell you where
[1:09:37] you're going specifically but I just
[1:09:40] need you to start moving and Abram goes
[1:09:43] with this Faith because it's complete
[1:09:45] faith is the only way you'll ever be
[1:09:47] able to walk this Christian walk it's
[1:09:49] not by a walk that you understand
[1:09:52] everything all the time if we'd be
[1:09:54] honest with oursel even as Christians
[1:09:57] serving the lord for many years we'd be
[1:09:59] honest enough to say that there's many
[1:10:01] times we don't have a clue what God is
[1:10:03] doing in our life and many times we
[1:10:06] could look at things and and look back
[1:10:08] at certain things and we're trying to
[1:10:10] figure out why did God do it this way
[1:10:12] and and and and you know many times for
[1:10:14] a real believer it doesn't always make
[1:10:17] sense not not everything that happens to
[1:10:20] even Servants of God makes sense all the
[1:10:23] time brother brandham would even say
[1:10:25] prophets don't know everything God only
[1:10:28] tells prophets what they need to know
[1:10:30] think of how many years that Jacob had
[1:10:32] to live in agony and anxiety and sorrow
[1:10:35] waking up in the middle of the night not
[1:10:37] knowing what happened to his dream
[1:10:39] Joseph and he didn't know what what what
[1:10:42] condition he was in whether he was dead
[1:10:44] whether he was alive but brother bam
[1:10:46] said God kept that from him and didn't
[1:10:48] show it to him and so every servant of
[1:10:51] God every man of God woman of God that
[1:10:54] has served the Lord for any length of
[1:10:56] time would be honest enough to tell you
[1:10:58] that you don't always have it figured
[1:11:00] out and even years later sometimes you
[1:11:03] look back in your life and go I still
[1:11:05] don't know why this happened in the way
[1:11:08] that it did but here's what I know all
[1:11:10] things work together for the good of
[1:11:13] them who love the Lord who are called
[1:11:16] according unto his purpose you see
[1:11:18] trusting God is not something that
[1:11:20] always makes human sense many times
[1:11:24] trust in God is is just trust in a
[1:11:26] promise whether the outcome is it comes
[1:11:29] out the way that you thought it should
[1:11:31] or not and so life we understand is a
[1:11:33] life of choices it's a life of many
[1:11:35] different decisions Abram's Journey
[1:11:38] starts and he says leave everything I
[1:11:40] want you to leave your father I want you
[1:11:42] to leave your your your your home I want
[1:11:44] you to leave everything you work where
[1:11:46] am I going Lord just get up Abram and go
[1:11:48] and I'll I I'll show you you know for
[1:11:51] Sons and Daughters of God many times God
[1:11:53] is looking for you to be be faithful and
[1:11:56] what he has told you before he'll tell
[1:11:58] you what's next and so many times we
[1:12:01] want to know what's next Lord and God
[1:12:03] saying are you Faithful in what I've
[1:12:05] already told you because if you're not
[1:12:07] faithful in what I've already revealed
[1:12:09] to you I'm not going to show you what's
[1:12:11] what the next step and the right next
[1:12:12] decision is to make until you prove
[1:12:15] yourself that you can have enough
[1:12:16] confidence that I know what I'm doing
[1:12:19] and you don't and I've got all things in
[1:12:21] control and that's all that you need to
[1:12:23] know
[1:12:25] Abram leave everything you know that was
[1:12:27] a very hard thing for him but he had to
[1:12:30] make a decision he could have told the
[1:12:32] Lord know God I've got it really good
[1:12:34] down here doesn't mean I want to walk
[1:12:36] away from you but I really Lord I I'd
[1:12:39] just rather stay right here I'm just
[1:12:41] content but there was something in his
[1:12:43] heart to where he he knew that he must
[1:12:46] obey the voice of the Lord in his life
[1:12:49] and so he comes to that Crossroad in his
[1:12:51] life that hard decision that time you
[1:12:54] know when it's not just going with the
[1:12:56] flow sometimes in your life it feels
[1:12:58] just like cruise control and your just
[1:13:01] life is just unfolding sort of coming at
[1:13:03] you and you're just you're just dealing
[1:13:05] with it as it comes then there come
[1:13:07] certain spots in your life that we could
[1:13:09] call
[1:13:10] Junctions you know the prophet of God
[1:13:12] said that's the critical part it's not
[1:13:16] what you it's not what takes place you
[1:13:17] know just necessarily on a day-to-day
[1:13:20] basis but there's certain times God
[1:13:22] brings you to certain Junctions or
[1:13:26] Crossroads and he's watching what
[1:13:28] decision will you
[1:13:31] make what decision will you go left will
[1:13:34] you go right will you go forward will
[1:13:37] you go
[1:13:38] backwards Abraham I want you to do
[1:13:40] something even even even harder than
[1:13:44] that your father's going to die and it's
[1:13:47] going to be a very sorrowful thing for
[1:13:49] you Abra and no doubt Abram spent you
[1:13:52] know time there to sorrow over his
[1:13:55] father and sorrow and sorrow and grief
[1:13:59] but there came a time when God comes to
[1:14:01] Abram again and says get up get up Abram
[1:14:05] you've sorrowed long enough now you've
[1:14:07] got to move you can't stay here in this
[1:14:10] state anymore because you'll never get
[1:14:12] to the place that I've ordained for you
[1:14:14] staying in sorrow and distress you've
[1:14:17] got to make a decision but God I don't
[1:14:20] understand it doesn't make sense but
[1:14:21] Abram you got to move on you've got to
[1:14:23] pass the test ABR you've got to keep
[1:14:27] going and there's so many things that
[1:14:29] come in our life that want to get us to
[1:14:31] stop and sit down like this captive
[1:14:34] daughter eventually got to the place to
[1:14:36] where she wasn't just sitting down she
[1:14:39] was laying down in the dirt with a chain
[1:14:42] about her
[1:14:43] neck and she's graveling there in the
[1:14:46] dust and and and and and and such a
[1:14:49] terrible condition the Bible paints for
[1:14:51] us that she was in the the Philistines
[1:14:53] are mocking her
[1:14:55] Isaiah says and they're mocking her and
[1:14:58] here's the voice of God the voice of her
[1:15:01] father and he speaking saying get up
[1:15:04] daughter get up arise put on your
[1:15:09] strength put on your beautiful
[1:15:14] garments Abram came to another place in
[1:15:16] his life after he passed that test and
[1:15:19] yet he comes to another Junction in his
[1:15:21] life when he's going to have to cast out
[1:15:24] the Bond woman
[1:15:25] and this may you can make it become very
[1:15:27] disconnected from the story but this was
[1:15:30] a very hard decision on AB when he took
[1:15:34] a woman who he loved a baby that was his
[1:15:37] own and God made such a gave him such
[1:15:41] clear instructions that he must cast her
[1:15:44] out of his of her home now God wasn't
[1:15:46] going to just leave her we know that
[1:15:48] from the story of the scripture God had
[1:15:50] provision for Hagar and for ishmail but
[1:15:53] but God needed Abram to put her and his
[1:15:57] child in his hands it was a very
[1:16:00] difficult thing you could imagine re it
[1:16:03] would just rip the heart out of this man
[1:16:05] but he must be obedient he had a choice
[1:16:08] to make his journey wasn't completed and
[1:16:12] until he made that choice God was not
[1:16:15] going to show him the next
[1:16:17] instructions for his
[1:16:19] life he comes even further than that as
[1:16:22] I'm sure you know where I'm going with
[1:16:24] this and it would come to an even harder
[1:16:27] harder decision a harder Crossroad a
[1:16:30] harder choice and God says Abram you've
[1:16:33] passed the test of leaving ER you've
[1:16:36] passed the test of leaving your father
[1:16:38] you passed the test with Hagar but I'm
[1:16:40] not done with you Abram there's another
[1:16:43] test you've got to pass this is the big
[1:16:46] one Abram this is the large one Abram
[1:16:50] this this is this is the test that that
[1:16:53] that I promise I give you my word I love
[1:16:56] it when God swears and gives his promise
[1:16:59] because you can count on it when God
[1:17:01] puts his word behind it the Bible says
[1:17:03] it this way that it's impossible for God
[1:17:06] you say there's something impossible for
[1:17:08] God yes it is impossible for him to tell
[1:17:11] a
[1:17:12] lie and he says I promised you Abraham
[1:17:15] you were faithful and that was a good
[1:17:17] thing when you left her you were
[1:17:19] faithful and that was a good thing when
[1:17:21] you left your father but but but now
[1:17:23] it's all Christendom at this one moment
[1:17:26] I want you to take your son your only
[1:17:29] son read it the way Genesis says it this
[1:17:32] is the way it says it take your son your
[1:17:35] only
[1:17:36] son whom thou
[1:17:39] lovest it's amazing because some of the
[1:17:43] sometimes the things that God asks us
[1:17:47] seem
[1:17:48] impossible you can imagine for this
[1:17:51] father this Blood of his blood flesh of
[1:17:54] his flesh here was the promise here's
[1:17:57] Abraham standing and here was the
[1:17:59] promise all of his all all of his Joy
[1:18:02] everything he had waited for everything
[1:18:04] that he thought he had endured for and
[1:18:07] now God needs him to sacrifice his son
[1:18:10] his only son whom thou lovest
[1:18:15] Abraham would do you love me this
[1:18:18] much you know it's a hard
[1:18:20] Choice it's very much a hard choice and
[1:18:23] that's the way that life is life is an
[1:18:26] array of choices you'll learn that as
[1:18:29] you go through life and you get o older
[1:18:31] and years and you leave the home of the
[1:18:34] tutelage of your family and brother
[1:18:36] bramman influence said you start as a
[1:18:38] baby and you're under the influence of
[1:18:40] your mother and he says the first love
[1:18:42] that a baby feels the first time that he
[1:18:44] feels the love of God Is the Love
[1:18:46] through a mother and he's under that
[1:18:49] dispensation of that love of a mother
[1:18:51] but he can't stay there it's got to go
[1:18:53] and pass on to in the dispensation of
[1:18:56] the love of the father and the Father's
[1:18:58] Love is very different than the mother's
[1:19:00] love but just as important to the growth
[1:19:02] and the nurture and the furthering of
[1:19:05] that child's life and then the brother
[1:19:07] bandam says after that voice of
[1:19:09] influence of that father you're turned
[1:19:12] over into the influence of maybe
[1:19:14] teachers Sunday school teachers and then
[1:19:16] you're under the tutelage of those and
[1:19:18] you've got to progress and then you move
[1:19:21] from that influence and you go into the
[1:19:23] influence of your workplace and in your
[1:19:25] job and you're under the influence of
[1:19:27] maybe school and college and different
[1:19:29] things and many different influences and
[1:19:31] brother Adam then stops and says but
[1:19:34] who's influencing you now what voice of
[1:19:37] influence are you are you following now
[1:19:41] and so we know that this was the way
[1:19:43] that life is made up it's a it's an
[1:19:45] array of choices some of them are very
[1:19:48] small some of them are very large some
[1:19:52] of them seem insignificant and some
[1:19:54] sometimes it's the decisions that we
[1:19:57] think are so significant we look back
[1:19:59] and realize those were't really the
[1:20:02] significant ones at
[1:20:04] all you know I I think of another man
[1:20:07] here and I'm just going to parallel the
[1:20:09] life of two men here just for a moment I
[1:20:12] want to parallel the life of this man
[1:20:15] Samson because also like Abram
[1:20:18] Abraham Samson's life was a life full of
[1:20:22] choices some of them really good some of
[1:20:25] them not so
[1:20:27] good his life starts out in Judges
[1:20:30] chapter 13 could you turn in your Bible
[1:20:32] with me if you could just for a moment I
[1:20:34] just want you to turn there and read it
[1:20:35] with me it'd be good if you could read
[1:20:37] it yourself I believe that that we
[1:20:39] should any time we can should read it
[1:20:41] right from right from our Bible you love
[1:20:44] the
[1:20:45] Lord notice here because this is going
[1:20:47] to be a prop uh a prophecy or or an
[1:20:50] angel that appears to to this woman and
[1:20:54] manoah and and his wife and the Bible
[1:20:56] says in verse two there was a certain
[1:20:58] man of Zora the family of the danites
[1:21:00] whose name was monoa and his wife was
[1:21:02] Barren and bore not and the angel of the
[1:21:04] Lord appeared unto the woman and said to
[1:21:05] her behold Thou Art Barren and bearest
[1:21:08] not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a
[1:21:10] son now therefore beware I pray thee and
[1:21:12] drink not wine nor strong drink and eat
[1:21:15] not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt
[1:21:18] conceive and bear a son and no razor
[1:21:21] shall come on his head for the child
[1:21:23] shall be a Nazar right unto God notice
[1:21:26] this from the womb and he shall begin to
[1:21:29] deliver Israel out of the hand of the
[1:21:31] Philistines and here this woman repeats
[1:21:33] it to her husband and he says in verse
[1:21:35] she says in verse 7 he said unto me
[1:21:38] behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a
[1:21:41] son and now drink no wine nor strong
[1:21:44] drink neither eat any unclean thing
[1:21:47] notice the promise that the angel gives
[1:21:49] this mother for the child shall be a
[1:21:52] Nazarite to God from the
[1:21:55] womb to the day of his
[1:21:59] death so you see the promise of God that
[1:22:04] he places over a life doesn't end with
[1:22:07] the bad decisions Hallelujah you see
[1:22:11] Samson is going to go a lot of places
[1:22:13] God never told him to go but yet the
[1:22:17] promise the anointing the purpose that
[1:22:20] God had for him will be from the very
[1:22:23] first breath to the very last breath he
[1:22:27] breathes he says he shall be a Nazareth
[1:22:29] unto God from the days born verse 7
[1:22:33] until the day of his death and so here
[1:22:35] we know that God gives him this promise
[1:22:37] and I'm just going to not take the time
[1:22:39] to read the rest of it but you see that
[1:22:42] it's these it's Samson's life that this
[1:22:44] promise was giving out through it and
[1:22:46] every choice that we make even us here
[1:22:49] just for a moment we have choices that
[1:22:51] we make some large some small and every
[1:22:54] decision we make some large some small
[1:22:57] will have some determinant Factor upon
[1:23:00] where we ultimately end up in life
[1:23:04] ultimately every choice young people has
[1:23:08] a consequence yes sir I want to I want
[1:23:11] to just take a moment to emphasize that
[1:23:14] to you because there's no choice too
[1:23:18] insignificant that doesn't bear some
[1:23:21] consequence to your life whether it's
[1:23:25] the choices of the friends that you have
[1:23:27] and you have that choice no one forces
[1:23:29] you to be friends with anybody can we
[1:23:32] just preach here just for a moment you
[1:23:34] see there's different people that that
[1:23:36] that Satan will anoint in your life and
[1:23:39] they can be called friends but actually
[1:23:41] they're not friends they're vo they're
[1:23:43] they're not speaking of the individual
[1:23:45] but Satan will use something in their
[1:23:47] life to to harm you or afflict you or
[1:23:51] bind you or keep you from what God has
[1:23:55] and so often times we need to recognize
[1:23:57] the tactic of the devil as brother Bram
[1:23:59] said overcoming is recognizing the devil
[1:24:01] and his tactics and sometimes we over
[1:24:04] complicate that when it's actually so
[1:24:07] simple and sometimes it's the music that
[1:24:09] we listen to We have that choice it's
[1:24:12] the atmospheres it's the places that we
[1:24:15] subject our spirits
[1:24:18] to and so every decision that we make
[1:24:22] ultimately has some type of consequence
[1:24:25] what we watch what we allow to enter
[1:24:27] into the gates of our spirit of our
[1:24:29] human Spirit the place where we go to
[1:24:32] church the place where we choose to be
[1:24:34] employed the words that come out of our
[1:24:36] mouth the thoughts and the things that
[1:24:38] we feed upon on our smartphones these
[1:24:40] are all choices that ultimately develop
[1:24:44] character in our life you see because
[1:24:47] choices leads to
[1:24:51] habits always choices lead to habits
[1:24:54] good choices lead to good habits that's
[1:24:57] right and bad choices lead to really bad
[1:25:00] habits and so so we we allow these
[1:25:03] things brother brandom says it this way
[1:25:04] and I love this quote in the marriage of
[1:25:06] the Lamb he says God could not push us
[1:25:08] through a little pipe and pull us out on
[1:25:11] the other end and then say blessed is he
[1:25:14] that overcometh you had nothing to
[1:25:16] overcome he just pushed you through it
[1:25:19] but you've got to make the decision for
[1:25:23] yourself
[1:25:25] so in the larger picture just for a
[1:25:28] moment as we close this Loop here with
[1:25:30] choices in the larger Grand picture of
[1:25:33] one's life the Journey of life that we
[1:25:36] call it where you end up in 10 years is
[1:25:40] only the result of the daily choices
[1:25:43] that you make and you're making today
[1:25:46] that's true you see it's it's our life
[1:25:48] in the grand picture we see a choice
[1:25:51] after choice and eventually after you
[1:25:54] review those choices what you'll find is
[1:25:56] a pattern and a pattern of choices will
[1:26:00] give you a trajectory of one's life and
[1:26:03] you can watch the trajectory of one's
[1:26:05] life that is constantly going up not
[1:26:08] that they don't make mistakes and fall
[1:26:10] sometimes but the overall trajectory is
[1:26:13] as ever
[1:26:15] ascending and you get some on the other
[1:26:17] end of the spectrum to where they're
[1:26:19] here today and maybe it doesn't look so
[1:26:21] consequential but you look over the past
[1:26:24] pattern of their life of the last little
[1:26:26] bit and you don't see a trajectory
[1:26:28] that's ever ascending you see a
[1:26:30] trajectory that is descending friends
[1:26:32] I'll just be honest it's that simple I
[1:26:34] think sometimes it's as simple as us
[1:26:36] inventorying our own lives and saying
[1:26:39] Lord am I closer to you today than I was
[1:26:43] last year at this Youth Camp am I closer
[1:26:45] to you today than I was last month it
[1:26:48] will reveal are the choices I'm making
[1:26:52] ultimately sending me on a trajectory
[1:26:54] upwards or are they sending me on a
[1:26:57] trajectory
[1:26:58] downwards can you say Amen to the
[1:27:02] word you could look at your life now and
[1:27:06] understand that you have arrived where
[1:27:08] you're at in life because of choices
[1:27:12] very natural
[1:27:15] ones and Samson's life was to me when I
[1:27:19] read this book it's such a
[1:27:22] tragedy such lost
[1:27:26] potential such a a a life of what could
[1:27:30] have
[1:27:31] been God anoints him in such a powerful
[1:27:34] way and anoints him from his very birth
[1:27:37] says he's going to be a Nazarite unto
[1:27:39] God from the day he's born until the day
[1:27:42] he dies and the Bible says his life
[1:27:45] begins with an anointing you know Samson
[1:27:48] wasn't filled with the spirit of God as
[1:27:50] you are but yet his yet in his outward
[1:27:53] Temple it was only the Holy Ghost the
[1:27:56] enabling of the holy spirit that allowed
[1:27:58] Samson to be what he was brother Brandon
[1:28:00] makes that clear and he talks about men
[1:28:02] like Samson and he says what was that
[1:28:05] that was the ruach which is the Breath
[1:28:07] of God it's the same thing the Holy
[1:28:09] Ghost is the only difference is is that
[1:28:11] the breath or the ruach of God doesn't
[1:28:13] in our lives to the Born Again doesn't
[1:28:16] just anoint our flesh but it actually
[1:28:18] dwells in our soul but Samson lived by
[1:28:22] this Breath of Life and God had sent
[1:28:24] this great anointing upon his life and
[1:28:27] and from the very moment that he's born
[1:28:29] there's a very special calling there's a
[1:28:31] very special plan there's a special
[1:28:34] blueprint and and God says to his mother
[1:28:36] he's going to begin to deliver he's
[1:28:39] going to be a savior he's going to be a
[1:28:41] deliverer this is the word of a judge it
[1:28:43] means a savior it means he'll begin to
[1:28:46] save the people not from their sins as
[1:28:49] Jesus did but save them from their
[1:28:51] oppressors God had such a beautiful plan
[1:28:54] for Samson's life he had such a
[1:28:56] beautiful objective and long before he
[1:28:59] was ever born he already Drew up the
[1:29:01] blueprints he already Drew up the
[1:29:03] engineered set he already knew
[1:29:05] everything that he would ever face and
[1:29:06] he already made provision he' already
[1:29:08] he' already uh he had already brother
[1:29:10] random said it this way he had already
[1:29:12] given him the equipment he was borned
[1:29:15] with the equipment built down inside of
[1:29:18] him and he comes to his life under this
[1:29:21] anointing and the Bible says he shall
[1:29:23] begin to deliver the Israel the Israel
[1:29:25] out of the hand of the Philistines so we
[1:29:27] know that that they're under oppression
[1:29:29] they're they're backsliding and God
[1:29:31] comes to this Barren mother and gives
[1:29:33] him a promise and says you're going to
[1:29:35] he's going to begin to deliver such a
[1:29:37] powerful thing he's going to be a savior
[1:29:40] you know I just want to stop here just
[1:29:42] for a moment I just feel the Holy Spirit
[1:29:44] stopping me right here you know God God
[1:29:48] could use you just your own no matter
[1:29:50] how sign significant you think that your
[1:29:53] life is a life that is surrendered to
[1:29:56] God doesn't have to have some great gift
[1:29:58] of preaching doesn't have to have some
[1:30:00] great G gift of teaching doesn't have to
[1:30:02] have even a great gift of of singing or
[1:30:05] some kind of outward talent but any life
[1:30:08] that'll surrender them their vessel to
[1:30:10] the Holy Spirit God can use you to bring
[1:30:13] Salvation and Redemption to those that
[1:30:16] are around you a life that is
[1:30:18] surrendered to the holy spirit it's a
[1:30:20] tool in the toolbox of God it's a weapon
[1:30:23] in the hand of God and it will tear down
[1:30:25] the devil's
[1:30:28] Kingdom I I I I just believe that with
[1:30:31] all my heart it doesn't matter who you
[1:30:33] are the prophet of God says it this way
[1:30:35] God has always had one problem getting a
[1:30:38] vessel a person who he could get under
[1:30:41] his complete control under his complete
[1:30:45] submission oh I wonder if there's
[1:30:47] anybody here tonight that feels like I
[1:30:49] feel and would just say Lord I want you
[1:30:51] to have complete control of my life life
[1:30:54] whatever you got to do God whatever
[1:30:56] you've got to to shave down out of my
[1:30:59] life I want to be a vessel that you can
[1:31:01] use I want to be an instrument Lord God
[1:31:04] that you can use in my life I I just
[1:31:07] want to say and I I would invite you to
[1:31:09] say it this way if you could use
[1:31:11] anything Lord you can use
[1:31:14] me if you could use anything Lord you
[1:31:18] can use me in my life oh that he could
[1:31:21] get somebody under his complete
[1:31:26] control a life that is so yielded to the
[1:31:29] Holy Spirit uh not just your soul but
[1:31:34] your every action your every thought the
[1:31:37] words that you speak the thoughts that
[1:31:39] you
[1:31:40] entertain let it be to the glory and the
[1:31:42] honor of God and it will be a life
[1:31:45] that's under the control of the Holy
[1:31:48] Spirit oh Samson's life was meant to be
[1:31:51] a savior it was meant to be a deliverer
[1:31:55] it was something he was born with he was
[1:31:57] an anointed consecrated vessel can I
[1:32:00] just stop here and say for a moment that
[1:32:02] God has anointed a purpose for every
[1:32:05] life under the sound of my breath under
[1:32:08] the sound of my voice every life has an
[1:32:10] anointing which means a purpose I'm not
[1:32:13] talking about some filling and some
[1:32:15] Goosebump that's wonderful but many
[1:32:17] times we mistake what the anointing is
[1:32:19] brother Ram said the anointing is not an
[1:32:21] emotion it's not a feeling that you feel
[1:32:23] I feel an anointing and I love it when I
[1:32:25] feel it on my flesh I love it when I
[1:32:27] feel Goosebumps I be honest I think
[1:32:30] people that don't want to feel God have
[1:32:32] never felt him cuz if you ever feel him
[1:32:34] you'd say give me some more of of what I
[1:32:36] felt if you ever feel the Holy Spirit
[1:32:38] move on your outward body it's one of
[1:32:40] the greatest Sensations you could ever
[1:32:42] have but can I just say that is not the
[1:32:45] anointing the anointing brother brandham
[1:32:47] says is power it's it's it's it's it's
[1:32:50] it's Supreme control uh power under
[1:32:52] control it's a v so under control of the
[1:32:55] Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit true anointing from God comes
[1:33:00] with the purpose even the word anointing
[1:33:03] is cha in the in the Hebrew it means to
[1:33:06] smear or to rub with oil this is what
[1:33:08] they would do when they would anoint a
[1:33:10] king it's what they would do when they
[1:33:12] would anoint a prophet you can remember
[1:33:14] David's PR uh when he's anointed by
[1:33:16] Samuel and and and later in the Psalms
[1:33:19] and David is is talking about the
[1:33:21] anointing oil and he says oh how good it
[1:33:23] is for Brethren to dwell together in
[1:33:26] unity it's like the oil that flowed from
[1:33:29] Aaron's head to his beard down to his
[1:33:31] paps all the way down to his to his to
[1:33:33] to the floor what was it it was a
[1:33:36] purpose it wasn't just the oil it wasn't
[1:33:39] just about getting oily
[1:33:41] yeah in other words it wasn't just the
[1:33:44] sensation but actually the anointing was
[1:33:47] that God had a purpose for this life he
[1:33:50] had a mission for this life he had a job
[1:33:54] an instruction specific to this person's
[1:33:58] life and let me just stop here and say
[1:34:00] you can never fulfill another person's
[1:34:03] anointing don't you ever try to be
[1:34:06] anybody that you're not don't you ever
[1:34:08] try to be somebody if God didn't make
[1:34:10] you that way you'll be if you try to be
[1:34:12] that way maybe you're not a person who
[1:34:14] screams and shouts that's all right
[1:34:16] maybe you're not a person who dances and
[1:34:18] runs up up and down the church that's
[1:34:20] all right if that's who God made you to
[1:34:21] be then you better not resist God when
[1:34:23] he comes comes upon you but I just want
[1:34:25] to say this be who you are yes sir
[1:34:28] because God has only anointed you for
[1:34:30] the mission that he's given you and you
[1:34:32] could only defeat the Devil by
[1:34:34] surrendering yourself to that anointing
[1:34:37] David has given Saul's armor and says
[1:34:39] David had one thing to say it wasn't
[1:34:41] that anything was wrong with Saul's
[1:34:43] armor but David said I've not proven
[1:34:45] these things in other words you be you
[1:34:47] Saul I've got to be me I've got to be
[1:34:50] who God Made Me
[1:34:54] and so God anointed that life he
[1:34:56] anointed the life of of of Samson he
[1:34:59] says there's going to be a deliverer
[1:35:01] what is that anointing it comes with a
[1:35:05] purpose so God would literally have a
[1:35:08] burden and God in order to express that
[1:35:11] burden he would take a prophet and he
[1:35:14] would so anoint and baptize that man
[1:35:17] with his burden to where the voice of
[1:35:20] that Prophet becomes the voice of God
[1:35:22] that's what brother bandam said
[1:35:24] and he says that voice of that Prophet
[1:35:26] would carry wasn't that man's voice was
[1:35:29] it the human voice it wasn't just the
[1:35:31] human voice it wasn't about that people
[1:35:33] want to deify the voice of brother
[1:35:35] brandham had nothing to do with his
[1:35:36] human vocal cord had nothing to do with
[1:35:38] his Kentucky accent though I love it but
[1:35:41] behind that human voice was an anointed
[1:35:44] voice from the throne and when you heard
[1:35:46] the voice of Jeremiah it was no longer
[1:35:49] the thoughts of Jeremiah it was the
[1:35:51] thoughts from the throne room of God and
[1:35:53] let me just say when you rejected
[1:35:55] Ezekiel you were not rejecting Ezekiel
[1:35:58] you were not turning away from Ezekiel
[1:36:00] you were turning away from god Jehovah
[1:36:03] who had anointed the words of Ezekiel
[1:36:06] amen amen
[1:36:09] somebody it was more than the voice of a
[1:36:12] man when that man when that Prophet
[1:36:13] spoke it was the very heart the very
[1:36:16] burden of God passed down through a
[1:36:20] human
[1:36:21] vessel and then he would begin to
[1:36:23] express that burden even men like Pro
[1:36:27] like Isaiah men like Jeremiah had to
[1:36:30] live out things in their life that no
[1:36:32] one else would have to
[1:36:34] live even God tells his Prophet don't
[1:36:37] get married never allows him to because
[1:36:40] God wanted Israel wanted that man to
[1:36:42] know what it would feel
[1:36:44] like because this is the way God
[1:36:47] felt and so he would actually tell that
[1:36:50] man that he would actually take that
[1:36:52] prophet and put him through certain
[1:36:54] things in his life that maybe no one
[1:36:56] else would have to ever experience in
[1:36:57] their life but God needed that man to
[1:37:00] come under the weight or the burden this
[1:37:02] is what an anointing is is when you come
[1:37:05] under the purpose of God for your
[1:37:07] life and that purpose of God is
[1:37:11] transferred from God to Your
[1:37:16] Vessel it's amazing because God anoints
[1:37:19] his life in such a way and he's going to
[1:37:22] be a consecrated ated vessel it's a life
[1:37:25] with a purpose it's a life with a
[1:37:28] anointing of God an unction from the
[1:37:30] spirit of God so long as he surrenders
[1:37:34] to that plan that God had before the
[1:37:37] foundation of the world you see long
[1:37:40] before Samson was ever born God already
[1:37:43] was the architect of everything he would
[1:37:46] go through in his life he had it all
[1:37:49] drawn up long before he ever faced it
[1:37:51] listen friends do you understand young
[1:37:53] people
[1:37:54] that most of the time where anxiety
[1:37:56] comes from you want to know where
[1:37:57] depression comes from where fear comes
[1:37:59] from we talked about it this morning
[1:38:01] anxiety and fear comes from the unknown
[1:38:04] when you don't know something when you
[1:38:06] got questions about what's happening in
[1:38:08] your life it always has the onset of
[1:38:10] fear and anxiety and worry because you
[1:38:13] don't know what's going to take place
[1:38:15] but did you know something long before
[1:38:17] it ever took place God already seen it
[1:38:19] hello somebody amen I'm talking about
[1:38:21] Sons and Daughters of God who are LED by
[1:38:23] the spirit of God long before that
[1:38:25] problem ever came God already signed off
[1:38:28] on that trial give it gave it his stamp
[1:38:31] of approval and gave the devil
[1:38:33] permission to attack you or afflict you
[1:38:36] but I got I got good news for you
[1:38:38] tonight that if my heavenly father
[1:38:40] signed off on it then my heavenly
[1:38:43] father's got to back up everything that
[1:38:45] happens in my life listen young people
[1:38:47] you can't go through anything in your
[1:38:49] life that your heavenly father didn't
[1:38:51] already know that what you would would
[1:38:53] go through made a way of Escape out of
[1:38:55] it and all of it will be for the glory
[1:38:58] of God there is nothing the Sons and
[1:39:00] Daughters of God go through outside of
[1:39:02] something that will bring glory to the
[1:39:04] name of your
[1:39:05] father long before it ever took place
[1:39:09] God already anointed the life isn't it
[1:39:12] so amazing that nothing ever catches God
[1:39:16] by surprise
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:20] nothing ever catches him by surprise
[1:39:24] God never is biting his
[1:39:26] fingernails he's never worried and
[1:39:28] anxious and what's going to
[1:39:31] happen What will what will take place
[1:39:33] God's never up in heaven when you make a
[1:39:35] bad God goes oh man what are we going to
[1:39:37] do we got to come up with Plan B no no
[1:39:40] there's no plan B with God maybe plan C
[1:39:43] Plan B didn't work I'll go to plan C
[1:39:45] there is no plan C you see from the
[1:39:47] beginning from the Cradle to the Grave
[1:39:49] God has already written out your drama
[1:39:52] your story
[1:39:54] and every F the family you were born in
[1:39:56] the home you were raised in the kind of
[1:39:58] father that you had you say well brother
[1:39:59] Matt you don't know my life I don't but
[1:40:02] God does and long before you ever came
[1:40:04] into this world God raised you up for a
[1:40:07] certain purpose a certain Mission I'm
[1:40:09] preaching to somebody here tonight
[1:40:11] because the Lord had me is is stopping
[1:40:13] me it won't let me go any further from
[1:40:15] this right here God had had you go
[1:40:18] through that what you went through
[1:40:19] because there was a mission in your life
[1:40:22] and God needs you to get to stop
[1:40:23] questioning what's taking place and stop
[1:40:26] get you know blaming this and blaming
[1:40:28] that and just say Lord all things be to
[1:40:30] the glory of God my life is in your
[1:40:33] hands as David said my times are in your
[1:40:35] hands my seasons are in your hands from
[1:40:38] the beginning to the end you know what
[1:40:40] you're doing God and if you're not
[1:40:42] worried why should I be
[1:40:45] worried it's amazing what brings on fear
[1:40:48] is the fear of the unknown it's just
[1:40:50] like people you know it's it's so
[1:40:52] incredible because I told this story and
[1:40:55] it's very hilarious to me uh and maybe
[1:40:57] you can relate here I know any good old
[1:41:00] American could relate to this but you
[1:41:02] know it's so amazing because you ever
[1:41:04] you ever you ever seen somebody that
[1:41:06] that is is is uh has their favorite team
[1:41:09] and they really want that team to win
[1:41:12] you know that that that tournament what
[1:41:14] do you all have here rugby it's not not
[1:41:16] American football or you know maybe you
[1:41:18] call football something we call soccer
[1:41:20] that's all right who's right who's wrong
[1:41:22] I don't know you drive on the right we
[1:41:24] drive on the left but I you know I'll
[1:41:27] leave it there won't say
[1:41:31] anymore you do drive on the right so
[1:41:33] that must be right
[1:41:35] so but you know it's amazing because you
[1:41:37] ever watch somebody who who loves their
[1:41:39] favorite team you know how much stress
[1:41:41] and how much pressure they get under
[1:41:44] when that team is in the greatest moment
[1:41:46] and here's the here's everything the
[1:41:47] whole season's led up to this moment and
[1:41:50] and everything that they've spent all
[1:41:52] their money and all their life on and
[1:41:54] man they've invested everything it's so
[1:41:56] amazing how much people invest in
[1:41:58] something emotionally that they have
[1:42:00] zero control over what
[1:42:03] happens yet they will shout at the TV in
[1:42:06] the living room they will scream they
[1:42:07] will they will they will clap their
[1:42:09] hands and yet all the clapping and all
[1:42:11] the shouting and all the hurah and
[1:42:13] throwing the remote down on the it
[1:42:15] doesn't have any effect or any bearing
[1:42:17] on the game yeah I I hate to bust your
[1:42:21] bubble but just cuz you clapped your
[1:42:23] hands doesn't mean that they're going to
[1:42:24] throw a winning touchdown pass now that
[1:42:27] doesn't have any bearing no matter what
[1:42:28] you do it's amazing to me because here
[1:42:30] we are in church actually you're
[1:42:32] clapping and you're a Manning and you're
[1:42:34] shouting actually could have a bearing
[1:42:36] on the service yet we shout at ball
[1:42:39] games and we have no control over what
[1:42:41] happens and here we are in the presence
[1:42:43] of God and there's angels and there's
[1:42:44] demons and there's doubts and there's
[1:42:46] fear and we have an option to have an
[1:42:48] effect on the service of God but it's
[1:42:51] amazing because people get so invested
[1:42:53] in that and they're so fearful they
[1:42:55] become so nervous o over what happens if
[1:42:58] they
[1:43:00] lose and and you're so incredible
[1:43:02] because we were at a I was preaching
[1:43:04] somewhere and I was with my wife and I
[1:43:06] went to go get takeout at a restaurant
[1:43:09] that that night and I'd went into the
[1:43:11] restaurant and I'd watched and when I
[1:43:13] walked in I'm expecting a very loud busy
[1:43:15] place and man when I walk in I thought
[1:43:17] something is wrong because the place was
[1:43:20] just dead silent but there's people but
[1:43:23] it's dead silent and so I sort of you
[1:43:26] know walk in and I'm walking up to the
[1:43:28] spot where you see takeouts and then I
[1:43:30] notice and the whole restaurant I'm
[1:43:32] talking 200 people are Frozen not eating
[1:43:36] not drinking have their heads turn to
[1:43:39] the TV
[1:43:41] screen and it's this great moment of of
[1:43:45] of Tennessee and they're going to kick
[1:43:47] they they they they had never won or
[1:43:49] beat this team and I think ever and they
[1:43:51] were going to they were they were going
[1:43:52] to win it was like 3 seconds left in the
[1:43:55] game and they all they had to do is Kick
[1:43:57] this little Chip Shot field goal and and
[1:43:59] it would be over and you could just man
[1:44:02] you know you can feel the atmosphere
[1:44:04] sometimes you ever walked in somewhere
[1:44:06] and you realize man I walked in at the
[1:44:08] wrong moment and you could cut it with a
[1:44:11] knife you could feel it like you just
[1:44:13] want to turn around and go the other way
[1:44:15] you know you could feel that it was
[1:44:17] palpable you could feel the the the the
[1:44:19] pressure from one side the anxiety from
[1:44:22] the other and you could just feel that
[1:44:24] moment I thought this is incredible
[1:44:26] because here what what was it it was it
[1:44:29] was the greatest moment but what wasn't
[1:44:31] it was the unknown of what's going to
[1:44:33] happen and you could just feel that fear
[1:44:36] you could feel that anxiety and that
[1:44:38] that tension and that pressure that was
[1:44:40] there was so real and I'm just standing
[1:44:42] there and I just watch it that moment
[1:44:44] they're getting ready and the guy calls
[1:44:45] a timeout he's trying to ice the kicker
[1:44:47] and oh man you could that that tension
[1:44:50] just went up like 10 more notches in
[1:44:51] that room and and at that moment you
[1:44:54] know here they go and it's just about to
[1:44:55] happen and two or three guys just go I
[1:44:57] can't watch it anymore they just walk
[1:44:59] out they storm out of the of the
[1:45:02] restaurant and I'm thinking here you are
[1:45:05] you've waited the whole season for this
[1:45:07] here's the moment here's your team
[1:45:09] they're about to can you can't even at
[1:45:11] the greatest moment of Victory you can't
[1:45:14] even watch it you're so troubled I know
[1:45:18] y'all don't have weirdos like this in
[1:45:20] New Zealand it's all as us American
[1:45:22] weirdo
[1:45:25] goes you just pray for
[1:45:28] us and they can't even watch I thought
[1:45:30] it's so incredible because this is this
[1:45:32] is just pause for a moment this is
[1:45:34] exactly so much so real how people treat
[1:45:38] their
[1:45:39] life because sometimes at the very
[1:45:41] moment that God has you at that Junction
[1:45:44] or that Crossroad in your life and it's
[1:45:46] going to be the most important if you
[1:45:48] could he could say to he could say to
[1:45:50] Abraham Abraham if you'll just keep your
[1:45:52] faith right if you just keep your love
[1:45:55] right if you'll keep your confession
[1:45:57] right if you'll just pass this test I
[1:45:59] promise Abraham I'll bless you above all
[1:46:03] I'll bless your family I'll bless your
[1:46:05] home I'll bless you I'll pour out the
[1:46:07] window open the windows of Heaven you
[1:46:09] just got to keep your spirit right
[1:46:12] Abraham Hallelujah but it was so hard at
[1:46:16] this moment to have a right confession a
[1:46:18] right
[1:46:20] testimony and there are these people
[1:46:22] were
[1:46:23] and this guy's go storming out and I'm
[1:46:26] thinking ain't that something now you
[1:46:27] know what's amazing it's easy for me to
[1:46:29] talk cuz I could not care less about
[1:46:32] this football game I didn't even know
[1:46:35] until the game was over why it was so
[1:46:37] significant CU I don't I didn't care
[1:46:39] about college football but you know what
[1:46:41] these these people who really do care
[1:46:43] man they have so much invested in it you
[1:46:45] know what that me I didn't care at all
[1:46:47] it didn't really matter didn't really
[1:46:49] you know that's sort of how I feel about
[1:46:50] the way sometimes Believers I think we
[1:46:52] need to check oursel and have a reality
[1:46:54] check because sometimes we get I can't
[1:46:56] believe the reaction of Believers when
[1:46:59] politics happen and presidents get voted
[1:47:01] in and this is happening we get we we
[1:47:03] act like we're of this world or we act
[1:47:05] like that man is somehow in control
[1:47:08] don't let's just remind oursel it
[1:47:10] doesn't matter what president is in the
[1:47:12] states it it doesn't matter what Putin
[1:47:14] does it doesn't matter what Netanyahu
[1:47:16] does they're not in control of anything
[1:47:18] there's one thing in control of history
[1:47:21] and it ain't a man and a wife house it's
[1:47:23] a God in heaven and when he says it's
[1:47:26] over then it's over before then nothing
[1:47:29] can happen to me not even a hair on my
[1:47:32] head brother Ram said it this way Satan
[1:47:34] cannot take your life until God is
[1:47:36] finished with you
[1:47:38] amen I have no investment in this world
[1:47:41] at all
[1:47:45] none and I had no investment in that
[1:47:47] game at all none and so I could just
[1:47:50] watch it happily and sort of Snicker at
[1:47:52] these people
[1:47:53] and I just watch and he goes out I can't
[1:47:55] even watch can't even watch here it is
[1:47:57] at the moment the greatest moment and he
[1:48:00] can't even watch but you know what's so
[1:48:01] amazing about that have you ever watched
[1:48:05] the man who's watching the replay of the
[1:48:11] game you ever watched him now here his
[1:48:15] team fumbles the ball but man he's just
[1:48:17] eating
[1:48:18] popcorn watch this but your team just
[1:48:21] threw an interception don't matter what
[1:48:24] is it his atmosphere is different it's
[1:48:26] the same game oh but his Revelation is
[1:48:29] different you see he already has a
[1:48:31] revelation of who wins in the end so he
[1:48:34] doesn't worry he doesn't panic he
[1:48:36] doesn't get stressed there's no anxiety
[1:48:38] he already knows it doesn't matter what
[1:48:40] happens in this life I might fumble the
[1:48:43] ball I might get make a mistake I might
[1:48:45] fall down but I'm going to get back up
[1:48:48] because I'm a winner in Jesus Christ oh
[1:48:51] if we could ever have that perspective
[1:48:53] that the story has already been written
[1:48:56] of our lives and there is nothing as a
[1:48:59] Believer you can go through that God is
[1:49:01] not already
[1:49:02] ordained for your life
[1:49:05] yes from the beginning to the end from
[1:49:08] the Cradle to the Grave everything
[1:49:11] brother brandham says it that way about
[1:49:13] Moses everything has all of his
[1:49:15] intellects he had all of the equipment
[1:49:18] bned bned with the equipment the only
[1:49:22] thing he lacked was the anointing
[1:49:25] brother Brandon says it was such a
[1:49:26] different Moses as the Moses prior to
[1:49:29] the burning bush the Moses prior had all
[1:49:32] the intellect he had all the training he
[1:49:35] had it all up here brother manam says
[1:49:36] and I think any Christian and until that
[1:49:38] he says it's a wonderful thing for you
[1:49:40] to have it all intellectually it's a
[1:49:42] good thing that we learn about the
[1:49:43] message it's a good thing we learn God
[1:49:45] sent a prophet it's a good thing we
[1:49:46] study our Bible good thing we read our
[1:49:48] Bible good thing we talk to the Lord but
[1:49:50] listen friends sometimes you can have it
[1:49:52] just intellectually in your heart
[1:49:54] intellectually in your mind but it's
[1:49:56] never dropped to the bottom and the core
[1:49:58] of your heart brother Bram says and
[1:49:59] Moses with all of his intellects with
[1:50:02] all of his understanding yet he had
[1:50:04] never came to that burning
[1:50:07] bush and that Burning Bush was not going
[1:50:09] to change what he had that Burning Bush
[1:50:12] was going to anoint what God had already
[1:50:14] placed in his life you see everything
[1:50:17] Moses lacked was in that burning bush
[1:50:20] and can I just say this here tonight my
[1:50:22] brother and my sister it's wonderful to
[1:50:24] look at the pillar of fire over the
[1:50:26] Houston Coliseum it's a wonderful thing
[1:50:28] to see that over brother bram's head but
[1:50:30] until that light that person leaves that
[1:50:32] picture and anoints your life and your
[1:50:36] equipment then it's nothing more you
[1:50:38] might be a good Christian you might be a
[1:50:39] good church member you might be a good
[1:50:41] message believer oh but I say God give
[1:50:44] me more than just a name only let me be
[1:50:47] an anointed vessel a vessel that can be
[1:50:50] used by you Lord Jesus
[1:50:54] notice here I want you just to parallel
[1:50:56] this and I just I'm I'm going to run out
[1:50:58] of time if I don't get to this his life
[1:51:01] just begins to unravel in such a sad way
[1:51:04] he's born as a Nazarite is going to have
[1:51:06] many many
[1:51:09] victories oh but he's going to have many
[1:51:12] defeats see how did it how did he get to
[1:51:15] this place brother Matt this man is born
[1:51:18] with such power such strength and he's
[1:51:21] not some great you know big old
[1:51:23] bodybuilder that's not
[1:51:26] Samson there's a reason why Delilah
[1:51:28] looked at him and said what is the
[1:51:33] secret cuz it ain't
[1:51:36] this brother random said he was just a
[1:51:38] little scny
[1:51:39] shrimp so what is the secret of your
[1:51:42] great strength wasn't that he had all
[1:51:44] this great power and he was great
[1:51:46] physical man but when the spirit of God
[1:51:49] came on him he was unnatural yeah yeah
[1:51:54] and and he could he could do things that
[1:51:56] no other man could do because of the
[1:51:57] power of God because of the ruach the
[1:52:00] Breath of God anoint in his
[1:52:02] life and notice this here he he could
[1:52:04] come to a place in his life he's born
[1:52:07] under this Nazarite vow he's God has
[1:52:09] used him to get many victories he he
[1:52:12] tells his his his his father he's going
[1:52:14] to be a deliverer God is going to
[1:52:17] blueprint his life and he's going to
[1:52:18] have an anointing upon him and and and
[1:52:21] and God even before before listen
[1:52:23] friends here's what's so powerful that
[1:52:26] even though God had blueprinted a life
[1:52:29] it didn't mean that God was going to
[1:52:32] force
[1:52:34] him it didn't mean that God was going to
[1:52:37] make
[1:52:38] him surrender his life to that plan yes
[1:52:42] you see God has a plan but he's also
[1:52:44] left us with free moral
[1:52:47] agency amen and we've got to make the
[1:52:51] choice yes sir for
[1:52:53] ourself mama can't make it Daddy can't
[1:52:56] make it the pastor can't make it oh if
[1:52:58] we could we
[1:53:00] would I promise if we could push a
[1:53:03] button and fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:05] mothers and fathers would be breaking
[1:53:07] that
[1:53:07] button but we can't it's got to be your
[1:53:12] choice your decision as brother Brandon
[1:53:16] with Danny Henry and he's given the
[1:53:18] prophecy over his life and the
[1:53:20] interpretation of that un own tongue you
[1:53:23] ever catch what it says in that
[1:53:25] interpretation it says
[1:53:28] because thou has
[1:53:31] chosen not that I forced you not that I
[1:53:34] made you but you have chosen the harder
[1:53:39] way and then I love that the prophecy
[1:53:41] says and it's my
[1:53:44] way because this was a life that brother
[1:53:46] bam lived of
[1:53:48] self-denial and that was the way of
[1:53:51] Jesus every decision in his life led him
[1:53:55] to the
[1:53:56] cross it wasn't the cross was just the
[1:53:58] ultimate it was just the final
[1:54:01] surrendering of his human will he
[1:54:04] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:54:08] suffered and here was here was the
[1:54:11] prophecy over brother Ram's life because
[1:54:14] you have chosen it was a
[1:54:18] choice you have chosen the harder way
[1:54:23] and it's my way no one forced you no one
[1:54:26] made you you could have had a different
[1:54:28] way you didn't have to take that path
[1:54:31] but because you did there's a great
[1:54:34] portion of Heaven waiting for you you
[1:54:38] know what that great portion was you and
[1:54:44] me do you realize that friends when
[1:54:47] brother Ram goes beyond the curtain of
[1:54:49] time and he's laying back in his bed and
[1:54:51] brother Ram gets confused because of all
[1:54:53] these people and he says who are there
[1:54:54] your people and brother brandham said
[1:54:56] are all these Brams he says oh no no
[1:54:59] these are your converts the ones you led
[1:55:01] to the
[1:55:02] Lord his portion his great portion of
[1:55:06] heaven was the lives that he had
[1:55:10] impacted by that life of
[1:55:15] self-denial do we realize sometimes the
[1:55:17] choices that we're making has an impact
[1:55:21] has an effect it leaves behind a legacy
[1:55:25] it leaves behind an
[1:55:27] imprint come on young people get with me
[1:55:29] here the choices that you make have a
[1:55:33] have a have an impact have an
[1:55:36] effect little did he know go did it
[1:55:39] matter how many you know Jeremiah 29 for
[1:55:42] I know the thoughts the plans that you
[1:55:44] have for me but out of all of those
[1:55:48] plans it doesn't mean that we surrender
[1:55:50] to those plans he Samson was never fully
[1:55:54] going to surrender in his life he goes
[1:55:58] all the way to the very end of his life
[1:56:00] and he's blind he's
[1:56:03] shaved and his his outward image of this
[1:56:07] man bound with brass as brother Brandon
[1:56:10] said represents judgment yet long before
[1:56:14] the the physical
[1:56:16] chains he had been bound a long time
[1:56:20] long before they put out his eyes yeah
[1:56:22] Samson had been losing his
[1:56:25] vision and and he gets to this place and
[1:56:28] and and even even judges 14 we can go we
[1:56:31] can go through some of this I'm just
[1:56:33] going to I'm just going to skip through
[1:56:35] this I'm looking at my time now so let's
[1:56:36] just go to Genesis if you have your
[1:56:38] Bible turn to the Book of Genesis and I
[1:56:40] I just want to take you to a completely
[1:56:43] different place here Genesis chapter
[1:56:46] 28 you love the Lord
[1:57:07] here's another man that we could look at
[1:57:09] in his life and just draw from this man
[1:57:13] Jacob he's a very disobedient child of
[1:57:16] God Jacob Cher Sur
[1:57:19] planter but he was also an anointed
[1:57:22] servant now remember Jacob was not a
[1:57:24] good man you see Esau was actually a
[1:57:28] good man and brother Brandon points that
[1:57:30] out that in Esau's makeup his nature of
[1:57:32] who he was Jacob was a
[1:57:35] Shyer Jacob was a supplanter Jacob was a
[1:57:38] deceiver but there's a very big
[1:57:40] difference between a good man and a God
[1:57:43] man you see Jacob might not have been a
[1:57:45] good man at that moment but he was a God
[1:57:48] man because God had an anointing upon
[1:57:51] his life yeah and he couldn't get away
[1:57:53] from it and he comes to this place to
[1:57:56] where he's sinful he's disobedient and
[1:57:58] he's he's he's he's his sins have
[1:58:01] brought his entire family to rock bottom
[1:58:05] but I want you just to back up here for
[1:58:06] a moment in this man's life long before
[1:58:09] he gets to that
[1:58:10] place the Bible says that God Appears to
[1:58:13] him in such a supernatural way such a
[1:58:17] powerful way and God Appears to him at
[1:58:20] bethl and he sees a ladder in Genesis 28
[1:58:23] and let's just pick it up here in verse
[1:58:25] 15 and he gives them this
[1:58:27] promise I I'll just I'll just begin at
[1:58:30] verse 12 we could read a lot more but
[1:58:32] just to save time he lights upon a
[1:58:34] certain place and he the Bible says he
[1:58:36] put them took stones of that place put
[1:58:38] them for his pillows and he dreams and
[1:58:40] behold a ladder set upon the earth and
[1:58:42] the top of it reached to heaven and the
[1:58:43] angels of God ascended and descended the
[1:58:45] Lord stood above it and said notice this
[1:58:47] I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[1:58:51] and of the god and the god of Isaac and
[1:58:53] the land wherein thou liest to thee the
[1:58:57] land wherein thou liest to thee will I
[1:58:59] give it and to thy seed it's a very
[1:59:02] Supernatural experience but it's going
[1:59:05] to come with a a very special promise
[1:59:08] and thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[1:59:10] earth and shall spread abroad to the
[1:59:11] West the East the north the South and in
[1:59:14] thee and thy seed shall all the families
[1:59:16] of the earth be blessed and verse 15 God
[1:59:20] gives him one of the most powerful
[1:59:25] promises God says
[1:59:28] Jacob I am with
[1:59:32] thee I am with thee Jacob do you know do
[1:59:37] you know how powerful that
[1:59:41] is I Am with You
[1:59:44] Jacob and I will keep you in all the
[1:59:49] places whether thou goest Hallelujah
[1:59:52] you're going to make a lot of a lot of
[1:59:56] places
[1:59:57] Jacob you're going to go a lot of places
[1:59:59] that I never told you to go but I want
[2:00:02] you to know how powerful my promise is
[2:00:06] when I make
[2:00:07] it I will be with you Jacob and all of
[2:00:12] the left turns right turns U turns all
[2:00:16] of the turns that you make all the
[2:00:18] crossroads you come to in your life
[2:00:20] Jacob I want you to know that there will
[2:00:22] be nothing you can do in your
[2:00:26] life that will detach you Hallelujah
[2:00:30] from the promise I make to you
[2:00:32] Hallelujah it does not mean Jacob that
[2:00:35] you will ever find rest and you will
[2:00:37] find the place that I've called you to
[2:00:39] but I'm never going to stop I'm never
[2:00:42] going to stop pushing I'm never going to
[2:00:44] stop pressing I love
[2:00:46] that God says I want you to know how
[2:00:49] sure the promise is Jacob
[2:00:53] as brother brandham tells brother Billy
[2:00:55] Paul God's got a promise over your life
[2:00:57] son right and he holds us hands out like
[2:01:00] this you remember that as brother Billy
[2:01:02] Paul tells it in his testimony like a
[2:01:05] cross and he says you may go the long
[2:01:08] way you may run you may run from God you
[2:01:12] may go far you you you may you may turn
[2:01:14] away from the Lord but I want you to
[2:01:16] know God's going to bring you
[2:01:18] back it may come through hard times that
[2:01:21] you may come through sorrow through pain
[2:01:24] through loss of
[2:01:26] limb through loss of Health through loss
[2:01:29] of Mind through loss of spirit through
[2:01:32] loss of everything but I promise you if
[2:01:35] you're a Son of God if you're a daughter
[2:01:37] of God God will not lose you am you Lord
[2:01:44] oh I'm so thankful for that kind of
[2:01:47] Grace I want you to know you're going to
[2:01:51] go a lot of places Jacob but my promise
[2:01:54] is with you look at verse 15 for I
[2:01:59] will not leave
[2:02:04] you until I have done that which I have
[2:02:08] spoken to thee of Jacob wakes up you
[2:02:12] imagine the supernatural experience he
[2:02:15] comes to he wakes up and he says oh oh
[2:02:19] Jacob says in verse 16 sure the Lord is
[2:02:22] in this place and I knew it not oh how
[2:02:25] Dreadful that word is actually awesome
[2:02:27] is this place this is none other but the
[2:02:29] house of God and the Gate of this is the
[2:02:31] Gate of Heaven Jacob rose up early in
[2:02:33] the morning took the stone he had put
[2:02:35] upon it for his pillow set up a pillar
[2:02:37] you can imagine him trying to
[2:02:38] memorialize such a supernatural thing
[2:02:40] he's he's looking at the pillow the
[2:02:42] Rocks he slept upon and he says I'm just
[2:02:44] going to anoint this because that's
[2:02:45] where my head laid I'm going to anoint
[2:02:48] the stone because God spoke to me here
[2:02:51] what was it when God speaks to you put a
[2:02:53] marker down and say this was a special
[2:02:55] moment in my life Satan you might come
[2:02:58] in my life but I can always go back to
[2:03:00] that moment and say I may go a long way
[2:03:02] from that but at this moment I know God
[2:03:04] spoke to me at this meeting I know he
[2:03:07] deal he dealt with my heart I may not
[2:03:08] hear the voice of God at all right now
[2:03:10] but here's what I can say God spoke to
[2:03:12] me on that day he spoke to me at that
[2:03:14] moment I'm going to anoint this Stone
[2:03:17] because it's a special moment in my
[2:03:20] life and he's going to go you think
[2:03:22] brother Matt what happens to Jacob from
[2:03:24] that moment after he
[2:03:27] anointed oh he calls the name of the
[2:03:29] place
[2:03:31] bethl and he he anoints and he vows a
[2:03:34] vow in verse 20 if God will be with me
[2:03:37] keep me in this way that I go and will
[2:03:39] give me to to to to me bread to eat and
[2:03:42] reignment to put upon so that I come
[2:03:44] again to my father's house in peace he
[2:03:47] calls the name of the place bethl
[2:03:51] the house of
[2:03:53] God the house the dwelling The Vessel
[2:03:58] the house of God yeah beautiful you say
[2:04:00] where's he going to go from here brother
[2:04:02] Matt oh surely this journey the story is
[2:04:05] going to unfold is with all of these
[2:04:09] wonderful things that are going to take
[2:04:14] place no it's so
[2:04:17] sad how sometimes a very special moment
[2:04:22] moment doesn't always lead to a
[2:04:27] life and he's going to go 20 long
[2:04:33] years years from this
[2:04:37] moment and he's going to become so
[2:04:40] carnal my goodness so
[2:04:44] corrupted in his
[2:04:46] life 20 years following this marvelous
[2:04:51] powerful Supernatural
[2:04:53] experience and you know what follows
[2:04:55] that experience years of
[2:04:59] Trials
[2:05:01] sorrow
[2:05:06] trouble
[2:05:08] failure lots of
[2:05:11] it I'm talking lots of failure enough to
[2:05:15] make you doubt that I ever hear from God
[2:05:19] at all
[2:05:23] yeah but you know what I can tell you
[2:05:25] here tonight because the Bible tells us
[2:05:28] throughout all of the
[2:05:30] mistakes throughout all of the failure
[2:05:33] God never left him amen thank you
[2:05:43] Lord because God had joined himself to
[2:05:48] Jacob he had joined himself in in such a
[2:05:52] way even though this man settles down in
[2:05:55] apathy
[2:05:58] lukewarmness
[2:05:59] sinfulness and he quickly forgets the
[2:06:03] glory of that
[2:06:05] night and brother R like he says of the
[2:06:07] Ephesian Church they lost The Wonder of
[2:06:09] their
[2:06:11] message and even after all of this and
[2:06:15] and and all of that experience he'd
[2:06:17] become cold backslid lustful
[2:06:22] carnal I want you to pick it up here in
[2:06:25] Genesis chapter 31 we're going to close
[2:06:26] here we're just at 59 minutes so can you
[2:06:29] give me Grace just for a few can you
[2:06:31] give me Grace just for a few thank
[2:06:34] you God Appears to him again cold carnal
[2:06:38] backsliding
[2:06:41] lustful but he comes to him
[2:06:43] again and he says in verse 11 the angel
[2:06:47] of God spoke unto me in a dream saying
[2:06:49] Jacob and I said here I am
[2:06:53] he says here in verse
[2:06:55] 13 I am the god of bethl yes where thou
[2:07:01] anointed the pillar where thou vowed a
[2:07:03] vow unto me now arise arise same thing
[2:07:07] he says to that captive daughter arise
[2:07:10] get up Jacob what are you doing
[2:07:13] here what are you doing here Jacob get
[2:07:16] up I'm the god of bethl I'm not the god
[2:07:19] of the sin I'm not the god of your
[2:07:21] warness I'm not the god of that carnal
[2:07:23] carnal thing I'm the god of bethl Jacob
[2:07:27] he says in verse 13 get thee out from
[2:07:29] this land and return unto the land of
[2:07:31] thy
[2:07:32] Kindred did he do it
[2:07:36] no God saying remember Jacob remember
[2:07:39] how I touched you remember how I spoke
[2:07:41] to you remember how I dealt with you
[2:07:43] Jacob get up put on your strength put on
[2:07:48] your beautiful
[2:07:50] garment why you lay there and allow the
[2:07:53] enemy to walk over you oh but I just
[2:07:57] need you don't you don't understand
[2:07:59] brother Matt oh I'll just when I could
[2:08:01] just get to this when this thing you
[2:08:03] know sometimes we wait and we wait and
[2:08:05] we wait and we put it off somewhere in
[2:08:08] the misty blue somewhere when this takes
[2:08:10] place and when then this happens and
[2:08:12] then when that happens and then when
[2:08:14] that takes place then I'll get right
[2:08:16] with the
[2:08:17] Lord when this takes brother Matt when I
[2:08:20] get to this spot in my life
[2:08:21] you know brother brandom said that that
[2:08:23] was actually the spirit that hung over
[2:08:25] his life as a dark shadow and kept him
[2:08:27] from surrendering his life to the Lord
[2:08:30] and brother bandam says I should have
[2:08:31] given my life to the Lord years before I
[2:08:32] did but a spirit hung over me saying you
[2:08:34] got time yeah that's
[2:08:37] right Jacob get up get up remember how I
[2:08:42] touched you remember how I talked to you
[2:08:46] go back to bethl go back to the altar
[2:08:49] instead Jacob doesn't Jacob settles down
[2:08:51] down in a town called
[2:08:53] shech God says go right do I still have
[2:08:57] you young people you still here you all
[2:08:59] right look this way it's all
[2:09:03] right God says
[2:09:07] Jacob go left Jacob goes
[2:09:12] right God says go forward Jacob goes the
[2:09:15] other
[2:09:19] way and God comes to him again in
[2:09:21] Genesis 33 turn there with
[2:09:33] me God tells him once again
[2:09:37] Jacob get up get up Jacob instead he
[2:09:41] goes to this land called Sheck you know
[2:09:44] what shech means it means going back not
[2:09:47] going back to bethl backsliding
[2:09:51] it's powerful because it also this word
[2:09:54] sheam means the place of
[2:09:57] burdens you know
[2:10:00] anytime we become disobedient to the
[2:10:03] Lord we can guarantee ourselves we're
[2:10:05] going to the place of
[2:10:08] burdens Sheck him he gets into all kinds
[2:10:11] of trouble he had no clue what that
[2:10:14] decision that choice would cost
[2:10:18] him he goes there in his house the the
[2:10:21] Bible says was Dishonored one of his
[2:10:24] daughters is
[2:10:25] raped did you ever imagine Jacob when
[2:10:29] you disobeyed the voice of the Lord what
[2:10:32] would take place in your
[2:10:34] family did you ever imagine the Calamity
[2:10:38] that you would bring by just not obeying
[2:10:43] the voice of the
[2:10:44] Lord his sons murder become murderers
[2:10:48] they weren't murderers before
[2:10:51] but they go and murder the men who did
[2:10:53] that to their sister you imagine the
[2:10:56] weight of this man friends I know that's
[2:10:58] very sobering but I want I just I think
[2:11:01] sometimes the gospel needs to be bare
[2:11:03] knuckled because life is bare
[2:11:05] knuckled and the consequences of
[2:11:09] sin I it it it it the consequences and
[2:11:13] the results of sin are
[2:11:17] horrible and Jacob's life becomes unwind
[2:11:20] and begins to you could almost say spin
[2:11:23] out of
[2:11:24] control his family's defiled his name is
[2:11:28] defiled his sons have now become
[2:11:31] murderers all because he's at the wrong
[2:11:36] place when God told him to go to bethl
[2:11:39] he goes to
[2:11:42] sheam it's amazing because you could
[2:11:44] think to yourself my
[2:11:47] goodness what a disobedient servant he
[2:11:50] is Jacob how could you how could you do
[2:11:54] this but do you know what the voice of
[2:11:55] the Lord says to Jacob notice here in
[2:11:58] verse 11 the angel of God spoke unto me
[2:12:01] in a dream saying Jacob I said here am I
[2:12:06] and he said lift up now thine eyes and
[2:12:08] see all the Rams which leap upon the
[2:12:12] cattle verse 13 I am the god of bethl
[2:12:17] notice here this is God speaking to this
[2:12:20] weird to this Aid and ser it now Jacob
[2:12:23] has no
[2:12:24] idea Jacob you could imagine just for a
[2:12:27] moment you know be honest with yourself
[2:12:29] young people if this was you in fact if
[2:12:32] you could say if you were God In This
[2:12:34] Moment how would you have spoken to
[2:12:36] Jacob exactly it's amazing because
[2:12:39] sometimes we would
[2:12:41] treat ourselves or others so differently
[2:12:45] than how the Holy Spirit treats
[2:12:49] us and God comes to Jacob in such a
[2:12:52] powerful way forgive me just reading out
[2:12:54] of 31 and
[2:12:55] 33 and God comes to Jacob in such a
[2:12:58] powerful way there's no there's no
[2:13:02] chiding in fact there's there's no why
[2:13:05] didn't you listen why didn't you obey my
[2:13:07] instructions why are you so weak Jacob
[2:13:10] why are you so disobedient
[2:13:12] Jacob instead no he just says get
[2:13:17] up go to
[2:13:19] bethl go back to the altar
[2:13:22] go back to your first love get up Jacob
[2:13:26] it's once again it's the same
[2:13:28] words it's the same encouragement
[2:13:31] friends let me just tell you God is word
[2:13:33] God's word his message is not going to
[2:13:35] change to you his word is just going to
[2:13:37] keep coming at you his word is going to
[2:13:39] keep preaching at you you can go ahead
[2:13:41] and get this settled in your mind you
[2:13:42] say Lord when are you going to finally
[2:13:44] give up when am I just going to finally
[2:13:46] cross the line and finally you just say
[2:13:48] you know what done with you I'm done I
[2:13:50] should have never started listen friends
[2:13:52] you can go ahead and rest assure on one
[2:13:53] thing you might walk away from God God
[2:13:56] will never walk away from you you might
[2:13:58] give up on God God is never going to
[2:14:00] give up on you he's going to keep
[2:14:02] pressing he's going to keep pouring he's
[2:14:04] going to keep loving he's going to keep
[2:14:06] preaching he's going to keep encouraging
[2:14:08] until you get
[2:14:11] up get up Jacob and you know what Jacob
[2:14:13] does this time he goes back to bethl and
[2:14:17] the Bible says he gets rid of all of his
[2:14:20] idols
[2:14:22] wakes up and tells his wife Cast Away
[2:14:24] all your Idols Cast Away all your
[2:14:26] earrings and he says Cast Away all of
[2:14:29] the all of the shame all all everything
[2:14:31] that we've everything that we've been
[2:14:33] identified before with I want you to lay
[2:14:35] it all aside lay it all aside I want you
[2:14:38] to I want you to get up Jacob gathers
[2:14:40] his family they go back to bethl and you
[2:14:43] know what happens in bethl he's restored
[2:14:45] back to who he was in the first place
[2:14:47] friends there's only one thing waiting
[2:14:49] for you at bethl and that's restoration
[2:14:52] not condemnation not why did you do it
[2:14:54] not you're never going to be good enough
[2:14:56] not not you sorry you sorry thing if
[2:14:58] there's only one thing waiting at bethl
[2:15:00] and that's restoration that's a father
[2:15:03] with outstretched arms ready to receive
[2:15:06] you back
[2:15:08] again you know what's so powerful when
[2:15:11] he goes back this time I've preached out
[2:15:14] my time but I'll just say it here you
[2:15:16] know what he names that place he doesn't
[2:15:18] name it bethl he names it El bethl
[2:15:21] it's very different because it's not
[2:15:23] going to be the house of God it's going
[2:15:25] to be the god of the
[2:15:27] house it's very different when it's the
[2:15:29] house of God and when it's the god of
[2:15:31] the
[2:15:32] house brother bandham comes and I want
[2:15:35] the musicians just to return now brother
[2:15:38] bham comes to a place and he's in Flint
[2:15:40] Michigan I I believe that's the city
[2:15:42] he's
[2:15:43] in and he's he's there to pray for the
[2:15:47] insane he's there to pray for those that
[2:15:49] are have lost mine and brother brandom
[2:15:52] gets so overwhelmed in that moment you
[2:15:55] could just hear it in the tape there he
[2:15:58] preaches just play something just the
[2:16:00] piano for now if you could just
[2:16:02] something
[2:16:07] softly he he he comes to
[2:16:10] that that
[2:16:12] Asylum and boy I couldn't imagine being
[2:16:14] in the
[2:16:15] shoes and here you are as people look at
[2:16:19] you as the Healer and here's people that
[2:16:21] are beating their head against the wall
[2:16:24] screaming and straight jackets and
[2:16:27] they're injecting them with shots and
[2:16:30] and just out of their mind just
[2:16:32] lost and and and you ask yourself how
[2:16:35] did you get to this place brother bam is
[2:16:38] starting to ask that he he tells in
[2:16:40] another place and he's talking and he's
[2:16:42] in South Africa and he's seeing men
[2:16:43] laying on the street and they've soiled
[2:16:45] their pants and their bums laying on the
[2:16:47] street and and brother Brandon's just
[2:16:49] saying surely something could be done
[2:16:50] done about this how does a man end up
[2:16:53] like this how do you get to that place
[2:16:56] in your
[2:16:57] life and and the prophet of God looks at
[2:17:00] that situation and he just looks so
[2:17:01] hopeless and he's looking at that all of
[2:17:04] all of just a just hard
[2:17:07] cases you no doubt how we would look at
[2:17:10] it and say how did they how did they get
[2:17:13] there how do you find
[2:17:16] yourself many times and I don't mean it
[2:17:19] in any kind of a critical way but many
[2:17:21] times I've sat there and looked at a man
[2:17:23] there at the stoplight and he's got a
[2:17:25] sign up and he's begging for food and
[2:17:29] you know beard down to here and no shirt
[2:17:31] on and he's dirty and dis
[2:17:33] shoveled and he's and he's asking hungry
[2:17:38] help have a
[2:17:40] family and you know many times I've
[2:17:42] stopped there
[2:17:44] and and just when he's not looking at me
[2:17:47] and I'm just I just stare into his eyes
[2:17:51] and I just think to myself how did you
[2:17:54] how did you get here how did your life
[2:17:57] when you were
[2:17:59] five when you were 7 years old playing
[2:18:02] in the yard when you were 10
[2:18:05] 13 when you were a little girl dreaming
[2:18:08] of your house and your babies and
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:12] your and dress up dolls and did you ever
[2:18:16] imagine did you ever could you ever have
[2:18:21] imagined that you would have ended up
[2:18:25] here my
[2:18:27] goodness did they ever think in their
[2:18:29] life that when they were 10 when they
[2:18:32] were
[2:18:33] 12 say how did they get there brother
[2:18:35] Matt one choice after another Choice
[2:18:40] after another Choice after another
[2:18:43] [Music]
[2:18:44] choice and sin has a way of settling
[2:18:47] like dust over our life
[2:18:51] and then before you know it we're 20 and
[2:18:54] we've got the same problems we're 25
[2:18:57] same issues in that
[2:18:58] trajectory 30 we've got the same problem
[2:19:01] 35 40 and you watch so many times we
[2:19:05] think somewhere down the road down the
[2:19:07] road it'll I'll get over it down the
[2:19:09] road I'll overcome it
[2:19:12] somewhere and we become like that
[2:19:14] captive daughter laid on the ground no
[2:19:16] one put her there but
[2:19:18] herself in fact no one put the chain
[2:19:21] around her that's why that's why the
[2:19:23] voice of God says loose
[2:19:26] yourself from the bond from the
[2:19:29] band around your neck yes amen who's
[2:19:32] going to deliver me who's coming no
[2:19:35] one's coming child you've got the power
[2:19:38] already inside of you you just have to
[2:19:40] get up it's what his message is to Jacob
[2:19:44] get up Jacob so many times we're waiting
[2:19:46] for a preacher we're waiting for this
[2:19:48] person we're waiting for this sensation
[2:19:50] waiting for this moment and the moment's
[2:19:53] right here right
[2:19:54] now and it just takes our
[2:20:00] choice brother Bam gets so overwhelmed
[2:20:03] he's looking at those cases they look
[2:20:08] impossible and he just he just Rings his
[2:20:11] hands he says Lord where do I even
[2:20:15] start a little
[2:20:17] girl can imagine
[2:20:20] little
[2:20:22] girl 20 something years old I think
[2:20:24] brother bam
[2:20:26] says says she ra raises her finger and
[2:20:28] says
[2:20:29] sir I wish you would start with
[2:20:34] me and brother Bram says
[2:20:38] you you're not a patient here she says
[2:20:41] yes brother brandham I wish you'd hear
[2:20:44] my
[2:20:45] story she says I was raised in a good
[2:20:47] home I had a good mother taught me to do
[2:20:50] do the right taught me to shun the wrong
[2:20:53] had a good
[2:20:55] home she says but I got with the wrong
[2:20:59] friends got with the wrong
[2:21:01] group and she says I got with a boy and
[2:21:05] and and before I knew it I was you know
[2:21:07] he says he'd put something in my drink
[2:21:09] and the next thing I know I wake up and
[2:21:13] she you know the the girl just begin to
[2:21:15] to to tell brother brandham and her her
[2:21:17] life and she had she had she had she had
[2:21:20] lost her
[2:21:23] Purity and that girl says and from that
[2:21:26] moment from that
[2:21:27] time it's amazing because the prophet
[2:21:30] preaches that message I think it's three
[2:21:32] times maybe four and he says you know
[2:21:35] all of us could look back to that one
[2:21:38] moment that one time when we could say
[2:21:41] there's where it all changed right
[2:21:44] there can pinpoint back to that one
[2:21:48] moment and it was all different
[2:21:52] and that girl says it was that one
[2:21:53] moment from that time I was different
[2:21:56] brother Bram said I started
[2:21:59] drinking and one drink led to two and
[2:22:02] led to three and before you knew it I
[2:22:03] was an
[2:22:04] alcoholic couldn't have just wanted to
[2:22:06] drink all the time she went on for years
[2:22:09] like that and every year new year she'd
[2:22:11] try to try to make some turn a new leaf
[2:22:14] and I'm going to get over and she tried
[2:22:16] to get help she went to Alcoholics
[2:22:17] Anonymous took her to the good
[2:22:19] Shepherd's home she says and they tried
[2:22:21] to you know they converted her to a
[2:22:23] Catholic and she said I did pretty good
[2:22:25] for a little while brother Brandon but
[2:22:27] then I went right back to it then they
[2:22:28] led me check took me and converted me
[2:22:30] from a Catholic I think it was from a
[2:22:32] Catholic to a Protestant and and brother
[2:22:35] brother she says brother Brandon says I
[2:22:36] did good for a little while but she says
[2:22:38] then the trajectory just kept getting
[2:22:40] worse she says then I I went right back
[2:22:43] to my alcohol and then before you knew
[2:22:46] it brother Bram I was on the street
[2:22:47] selling my body a prostitute
[2:22:52] think about that from that
[2:22:55] time and brother Brandon begins to deal
[2:22:57] with that sister and he says oh oh
[2:23:01] sister what about your mother what about
[2:23:04] your father she says oh they're dead
[2:23:06] brother Brandon they're going long what
[2:23:08] about the rest of your family I ain't
[2:23:10] got none no mother no father no brother
[2:23:13] no
[2:23:16] sister says no brother Brandon they're
[2:23:18] all they're all going look at what I've
[2:23:20] done look I've made a mess out of my
[2:23:23] life and brother brandom says but sis
[2:23:26] says don't you don't you have a desire
[2:23:28] to to to have a family so you could just
[2:23:32] see it in her eyes oh brother brandom oh
[2:23:35] how I long for that so much says don't
[2:23:38] you long to have little babies Oh and be
[2:23:41] a mother she says oh brother Brandon
[2:23:43] might do she says oh but but who would
[2:23:47] have me
[2:23:50] [Music]
[2:23:51] prophet of God says sis the Lord Jesus
[2:23:55] will have
[2:23:57] you and you can imagine to get to such a
[2:24:00] place she says oh brother brandom what
[2:24:04] could I offer the
[2:24:07] Lord Brother brandham says there's only
[2:24:10] one thing you can offer sis and that's
[2:24:13] your
[2:24:15] soul to Jesus
[2:24:18] Christ she says oh but but what about me
[2:24:21] brother brandham I've lost my Purity he
[2:24:23] wouldn't have me back brother brandham
[2:24:25] says oh sis let me tell you the blood of
[2:24:29] Jesus can take you back to your virgin
[2:24:33] before you when you were a virgin before
[2:24:35] you were guilty and shameful of your sin

[2:24:40] Guiltless before God oh my brother my
[2:24:44] sister let me just preach to you here
[2:24:45] for a moment the blood of Jesus is
[2:24:48] greater than any problem it's greater
[2:24:50] than any mistake it's greater than any
[2:24:53] failure I just want to tell you here
[2:24:54] tonight your failure is not final it is
[2:24:58] not the final word it is not the Final

[2:25:06] Sinner and wash them white before
