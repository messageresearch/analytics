God bless you each one, different ones. Welcome. Trust that you'll enjoy the time together [music] with us. Um, we have a very special welcome for brother Daniel and sister Cheryl here that thankfully made it [music] to Tanaki. Um, but it's real special to have you. I'm just looking forward to how the Lord's going to use you tonight, Brother Daniel. Um, so I'm not going to take any any time. Um, let's maybe sing one more song as I call Brother Daniel up and then we'll get straight into the word. Where are we? Um, right. We're not going to sing the whole song. Let's just maybe sing. Let's just sing verse one in the chorus. [music] Okay. Let the weak [singing] say I am strong. [music] Let the poor say I am [singing] rich. [music] Let the blind say I can see. [music] It's what the Lord has. [music] [singing] [singing] [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Jesus died and rose again. [singing] Amen. Amen. Let the weak say I am strong. Why? Because it's what the Lord has done for me. [music] Amen. God bless you. Thank you musicians. Good to see everyone. Some of you I know, some of you I I don't know, but it's wonderful to be part of the service. Uh tonight, I want to thank brother Elray's effort for uh uh we didn't get our flight last night from New Plymouth to uh sorry, Oakland to New Plymouth and uh brother Ellery had to drive up last night and pick us up from Oakland and drive us back again. So, we appreciate brother Elray's effort and in getting us here and all your effort as well in in in being here this evening in this service, the musicians, the song leader, the brother who prayed for the service and uh the tech team, everyone just appreciate you all and uh we're thankful that we can uh assemble like we can. I better thank my wife for being here, too. Thank you, Don. But praise the Lord. It's um it's a real privilege to be able to join ourselves together this way and just share the things that the Lord places on our heart that are that are very dear to us and and uh trusting that the service will be a blessing uh an encouragement to to each each and every one of you. Uh it's it's never a problem um that we don't have anything to say. There's always plenty to say, but it's seeking the will of God to know what to say. &gt;&gt; Because it's what we say that makes the difference, not how much we say. Um so, praise the Lord. We'll uh get into the service. Um, speaking of it's not how much we say, I got 45 minutes. All right. And I got a stopwatch because I can be one of those that can [snorts] speak um what's on my heart and sometimes you just carry a lot. [laughter] So, praise the Lord. Praise God. I just want to share this little picture with you here. Um, I thought it was really neat. I was out on a property. I go out to a property and and uh do a bit of hunting out there and and uh this I I walked upon this tree and and um you can see down the bottom here that there it's a stump, but there's a a tree growing inside another tree. &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, yeah. Isn't that a perfect picture of me? There's there's a life inside of a of what the prophet would call a coat that's pushing out. And uh you can kind of see how the the old the old tree has kind of split because the the new life that is within the old stump is has grown and grows and grows. But you know, it wasn't always like that. Yeah, it it's it started as a as a little as a little seed that maybe a a bird dropped in there when it sat on the stump or however it got there. But we know that a seed got there because we can see the see the result of it. But over the process of time, what what happened what happened here is the tree grew bigger and bigger and it couldn't fit in the coat anymore. You know, it couldn't fit in the old stump anymore. And we know that God has placed a life within us within us. Um, and it's inside this this old coat. And I don't know how how you're feeling, but it it feels like sometimes there's not enough room for me &gt;&gt; in this body. And uh I feel like that the bride is is growing to to a level of maturity. Not not because of anything she has done or doing, but it's because of what the Lord is doing for her that there's someone in her that is is it's getting a bit tight in here. And one day it's just going to bust out and and uh and receive a a a body change, a a new dwelling place. And uh it was just a a blessing to me how God testifies of what he's doing in our lives in nature. So we can we can see God in in many many many places but uh the most important place to [clears throat] see the Lord is within ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh the the thought we want to look at this this evening is your approach to life in [snorts] this world becoming what you are. It's it's a bit of a paradox and I just want you to think about that a little bit. Becoming what you are. &gt;&gt; All right. Not you're not becoming something that you're not but becoming what you are. So let's turn to the book of Hebrews and you know this this chapter sorry this verse here very well. We're not going to actually turn to Revelations. We're going to go to Judges 6 instead of Revelation. But um Hebrews 13:8 uh this was the theme of the of the prophet's ministry which we love so much. Is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the same &gt;&gt; yesterday and today and forever? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're thankful that he is the same yesterday, today and forever. Amen. So let's turn to uh Judges chapter 6. This is the uh the the the story of Gideon. And we kind of you've probably heard this many times, no doubt. And I'm not here to to u bring anything new obviously. Um but we just want to catch some points here in Judges 6 starting at verse 11. And there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which is in offer that pertained to Joash the abusite and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites. Now that wine, the the the wheat that he was um threshing there was his inheritance. It's what he fed on. It's what sustained him. But here he was uh um a man as we know, Gideon, who was doing what he was doing because he was afraid of history repeating itself, as the prophet would explain, and hiding uh his inheritance, hoping that the Medidianites wouldn't arrive and take his inheritance. And our inheritance is the word of God. &gt;&gt; This that's that's our that's our inheritance. But God doesn't want us to handle the word in fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Afraid of the enemy. &gt;&gt; All right. In verse 12, &gt;&gt; "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him, [clears throat] the Lord is with thee, thy mighty man of valor." Amen. Let's bow our hearts. So, heavenly father, oh Lord God, we just want to commit this service into your hands, Lord. May everything that is said and done be for your honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can take your seats. See, sometimes I even forget to start the stopwatch and I start at half an hour late. So So to to understand this thought tonight, I've just got a picture there. And you might say, "Well, how does it relate?" Well, it's a picture of a of the bride and groom. Um what I've used as a bride, the bride and the groom. But to understand this thought um and I'm quickly going to go through this this part of the service is that um we need to understand what life is [snorts] all about. What what is life about in or on this earth at this particular time? Okay. Um we understand we did not come into this world by our own choosing. Um we we did not um uh we did not come into this world by our mother or our father's choosing. But we came into this world because God ordained us. God chose us to be here at this particular time. Uh he chose us to be here at the time of the voice of the seventh angel. Uh he he chose you to be here at this time of the the the climax of everything God has been aiming for. One goal was to have a bride for himself. So we we understand that uh nothing happens without a reason. God doesn't do anything without there being a purpose in why he is doing it and what he is doing. All right. But part of the thought I want to share with you is that life here as in in time we're going to take two aspects. Life in time is not about life in time. [clears throat] All right. Life in time in in God's view is not about life in time. We'll say it another way. Life in this dimension is not actually about life in this dimension. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God sent you here in time. He allowed you to be here at this time, but his focus for you in being here is not actually here. &gt;&gt; He has a purpose for you being here, but his purpose for you being here extends beyond life in time. A way that you could um you could think about this and just bring it into our natural lives is that your parents um that let's say they you might be homeschooled but just roll with me. All right. Your your your parents sent you to school. All right. If I had a choice, I wouldn't have gone. The only reason I went was because I was sent. All right. So your your parents sent you to school. But life in school is not about life in school. Life in school is actually about life after school. &gt;&gt; Life in school is what prepares you for life after school. Right? So we are in time but life doesn't end with time. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Life continues after time. &gt;&gt; It's like when you first go to school and you know you got 12 years of school and if you if you're smart enough you'll go to university. It's like man it feels like eternity in school. uh one day is bad enough, let alone 12 years, you know, like but but God's purpose for you being here in time is to prepare you for life in eternity, &gt;&gt; right? We could say that our life in time is our schooling because what happens in school is you learn, right? You become educated, you mature, you learn from you you move from 1 + 1 to n uh 9 * 8 into algebra and all these different aspects of of mathematics. Progressively, you move up. You you become educated. Well, God isn't God isn't educating us in the sense of our mind, but he is giving us revelation. And education is revelation just on a natural sense. &gt;&gt; Right? So um life God's purpose for you here is to develop you for a purpose that he has for you after or when time is no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For life in eternity. So time life in time is about life in eternity. So what God is doing with you here is [snorts] that God is preparing you. God is developing you. This is why things happen. All right? Things happen in life that we don't understand why they happen. And maybe there are things in our lives that happen in life that we will not understand in this life. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It's the same as when you're going through school, you're sitting at the desk and saying, "Why do I need to learn this? &gt;&gt; What has this got to do with my life?" And 10, 20 years down the track, you realize, "Oh, yeah, they knew better. That's why I learned this." &gt;&gt; You know, and it's the same with our our lives here, what what God is doing [snorts] um with us as individuals. He's preparing us. He's developing us. uh he's maturing us for a purpose that he has for us beyond this life. All right. To me, one of the the the greatest lies of the devil is that life in time is about life in time. &gt;&gt; Because we we gather riches and we die, we do this and we you know, if if there's no life after time, then what point was your life in time? But but God has a purpose for your life in time &gt;&gt; and that is because he has a purpose for you after time &gt;&gt; or in eternity. &gt;&gt; So God is preparing you here for there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So time is what God uses to develop you for life after time. All right. um in uh the book of John. Oh, don't know how we got there. Did I have John on there, brother, or not? Maybe I put the wrong slide on there. Can we go back to slide one? No, I don't I don't have John on there. That's okay. I'll read it to you. John John 14 um two, [clears throat] it says, "In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go and prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you under myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. &gt;&gt; All right. So God God's focus for your life is not actually in time. God's focus for your life is for life in eternity. But before we can go there, we've got to stay here and become developed, &gt;&gt; right? We've got to become developed. And that's where the thought comes in. Becoming what you are because life in time is where you become what you are. &gt;&gt; You you cannot become anything else. &gt;&gt; It is it for the for for the bride's life, it is impossible. Yes, &gt;&gt; for you to be anything else other than what you are. &gt;&gt; It is impossible. Absolutely 100% impossible. And the reason that it's impossible is because it's thus, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we we saw in and we'll get to it a little bit later, but just to go back to the scripture in Judges uh six there, the the Gideon received his message. The message for his hour and the message for his hour revealed who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So, Gideon was thankful for his message the same as you and I are are are thankful for for our message. All right. So um we think about this we can think about it even the in the form of the body in which we dwell. This body is temporal. &gt;&gt; It's not eternal. But one day we'll receive a glorified body, an eternal body. But even the body that God has placed you in has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Because if what what would it what would it be like if he placed you in a perfect body in time? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There there there wouldn't be struggles. It sounds great, doesn't it? Uh it there wouldn't be struggles. There wouldn't be fights. You wouldn't have disagreements with yourself. You wouldn't argue with yourself. You wouldn't struggle with yourself. You wouldn't need to overcome yourself. But there's a purpose for God placing you in the body that he has placed you. &gt;&gt; And what is what is wonderful about this is that &gt;&gt; we all have a body that is shaped in sin and born in iniquity by by sex desire. But we are so different from one another. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know, we have different personalities. We're born under different star signs. We we have different upbringings. And because of those upbringings, we have little things in our in our spirits that um that we fight against. And you know, we we tend to do things that we shouldn't do and want to do the things that we we don't do and all these type of things. It's it's a battle. It's a it's a fight. There's a fight going going on. But the purpose of God putting you in the body that he has placed you in is to bring development. &gt;&gt; Okay? This body has problems. It gets sick. It can think wrong thoughts. It goes through stages of life. It has the ability to see things that it it it can't handle. It has the ability to hear things that that can overcome it. Um talk about things that it shouldn't. It's a body that needs correction. &gt;&gt; It's a body that needs you to bring it subject &gt;&gt; to the word of God or or the will of God. Um, so this the the the place that God has placed you in this body, there's a purpose behind it. And the purpose of it again is so that you can become what you are because you can't come become what you are without a battle. &gt;&gt; There must be a battle. There must be overcoming. There's no way that Gideon could become what he was without there being a battle. All right? But life in this body is not about life in this body. Even though we we do all these wonderful things to it to try and make it look as eternal as it can. You we know it's all in vain. Um but life in this body is actually about life in your perfect body. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh but we can't step into or change out of this body and into our glorified body until the development as the seeds of God has been completed in this body. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. So in eternity you won't be developed any further than what you are &gt;&gt; because this is the place that God develops you. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he said what you are here &gt;&gt; you will be there. meaning that God has to bring you to a level of maturity &gt;&gt; concerning yourself because what you are here you will be there right so so we understand these things there's a purpose for our life in time and that is for God to develop us into what we are all right &gt;&gt; the change of dimension and we think about this you know And we we talk about this often um that um you know once we change that dimension then I'll be uh into that that next dimension then I'll be who God says I am. But I want to ask you a question. Would Gideon have need to be a mighty man of valor in the millennium? &gt;&gt; Not at all. Not at all. Would you need to be an overcomer in the eternal dimension? So where's that going to happen? &gt;&gt; It's going to happen here. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're going to overcome here, then God has to bring you to a level of understanding, a level of revelation, &gt;&gt; character that you can overcome. Because character is the ability to make the right choices. &gt;&gt; Okay? Character is the ability to make the right choices. And this is why we constantly need developing. If anybody says to you, "Well, I've I'm I've I've reached the the goal. God can't develop me anymore." Well, the fact that he's saying that proves that he needs more development. &gt;&gt; All right? So your approach to life is don't focus on the things in this life because the purpose of life here is for life in eternity. &gt;&gt; All right? So everything don't hold to anything here &gt;&gt; because God has a purpose. You may be poor, it doesn't matter. God has a purpose. You may be rich. It doesn't matter. God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; All right? So, uh, so our appro our approach to life needs to be his approach &gt;&gt; that I'm here. I'm here for a time. I'm here for a purpose. I'm here to be developed. I'm here to have a greater understanding of me. I'm here. It's like the the clay in the in the in the on the on the wheel on the potter's wheel. It's there for a time. It's there for a purpose. It's there so that the tender hand of Jehovah can mold and make it into an image that he has of you from before the foundation of the world. Right? So, and this is this is why this point is really important. You your journey didn't begin in time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your jour Let's use this. All right. time, eternity. Your journey didn't begin in time. Your journey actually began in the mind of God in eternity. &gt;&gt; Right? So what what you were when God come to Gideon with the message of the hour to say, Gideon, thou art a mighty man of valor. That's what Gideon was in eternity. &gt;&gt; Right? So, so your your your life in time [clears throat] is about the development of that thought. &gt;&gt; Right? But the development of that thought has to go through the process of thought word manifestation. So when we look at this in verse 12 where it says, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." That's how God saw Gideon. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it this it this way. That's what Gideon was &gt;&gt; as a thought in eternity. &gt;&gt; And then Gideon was manifested on earth. Gideon was walking around as a mystery. Gideon did not know who he was. He was reflecting on his father's life and and and following down his father's footprints. His father probably threshed the weed in the same place &gt;&gt; doing the same thing with the same spirit of fear. But then Gideon received a message. It was the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that message of that because what the message of the hour was was the thought become word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And then the word was going to become manifest. But Gideon's uh the Lord said to Gideon here, "Thou art a mighty man of valor." All right. So, I've skipped right over a bunch of this, but praise the Lord. I got 25 minutes left. Um, so we let let let me ask you something. What could Gideon do to become what God said he was? Anyone want to comment? &gt;&gt; Believe. Anyone else? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Who said nothing? &gt;&gt; Nothing. Nothing. We were going to start this service in um Genesis 12, the unconditional covenant &gt;&gt; that God made with Abram. Abram, not Abraham. Abram. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Maybe we should go there. And the Lord said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show. I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee. I will make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee. I will curse them that curse thee. And in thee shall in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." So God comes to Abraham and we know we can let me just go to to the next slide here. um the Lord coming to Abraham again or Abram and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying, "As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name be anymore called Abram, but thy name shall be called Abraham, for a father of many nations I have made thee." All right. So the prophet of God picks this up and he tells us about how this was not something that Abraham was going to or Abram was going to do, but this was something that God was had already done. He did he said it wasn't something that was God was going to do in the future tense. He said God had already done. And he focuses on this last part of verse five. For a father of many nations have I made thee. All right. Now God comes to a Abram before he was Abraham. So in Genesis 17, God changes his name from Abram to Abraham. But God, we understand that the covenant was made with Abram before he had received the sign of circumcision. The covenant was made with Abram before he received the sign of circumcision. But that covenant that God made was an expression of the thought of God. It wasn't just God coming down and said, "Hey, I've got a good idea. I'd never thought of this before, Abram. Why don't I form a covenant with you?" That's not how God worked. The the covenant that God came down and spoke to Abram about was an expression of the thought that he had concerning Abram before the foundation of the world. So here what we have is Abram receiving or coming into contact or God bringing the message for the hour that Abraham was living to Abraham and revealing Abraham or Abram to um an understanding of himself that he knew nothing about. It was not even possible as we know Abraham was without son. It was not even possible for Abram to be what God said he was or to become what God said he was to be naturally. &gt;&gt; It wasn't possible. It absolutely was not possible. All right. So God approached Abraham or Abram. [snorts] God spoke his message to Abram. And this is what God wanted Abram to approach life through. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. God wanted Abram to approach life not through his own thinking, not through what his past testified he was. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Not not through the history of what his family was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or his family name, but this was God giving Abram the opportunity to approach life in a way that he had never been able to approach life before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we've got to be careful that we stay with the word. We hear that all the time. All right. We've got to stay with the covenant. Otherwise, if we don't stay with the covenant, we end up producing an Ishmael, &gt;&gt; a wild man. &gt;&gt; When we begin to think that we have something to do with this, &gt;&gt; all of a sudden anger rises up. All of sudden, frustration rises up. All of a sudden, you get an attitude. &gt;&gt; I tell you why. because you're trying to produce, &gt;&gt; listen to this, &gt;&gt; what God said you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God gives us the opportunity through the message of the hour that we have received because the message of the hour calls you bride. &gt;&gt; It calls you bride. &gt;&gt; It's like God called Abraham a father. Not of just a father, but a father of many nations. God didn't God called Gideon not just a man of valor, but a mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; God doesn't call you a bride, he calls you the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. So when when when when we have received and hear the message of our hour, the message of the hour is what tells you who you are. &gt;&gt; Not who you are if &gt;&gt; not who you are when who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary, thou hast found favor in the eyes of God. Thou shalt conceive. Not not when, not how, not if. Abram, thou art a thou, thou art a father of many nations. Gideon, thou art a a mighty man of valor. Sarah, thou art a woman, a mother of many nations. That there was there was nothing involved. This was unconditional. This was not even something. Oh, this is a paradox. All right. This was not even something that God wanted us to think about that we would become. &gt;&gt; God wants us to think about it how he thinks about it. &gt;&gt; And if he says you are, then you are. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say it doesn't mean you know in your mind you say yeah I believe I am. But &gt;&gt; right. So, we understand this was unconditional. We understand that the prophet talks about this over and over and over and over again. There's no strings tied to it at all. It has nothing to do with what you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother Dan, what you're saying is that you're telling me that I'm a bride and and yet yet I I I'm struggle with this and I struggle with that. That is what I am saying because that is what the message said. Amen. &gt;&gt; When did Abram become the father of nations? &gt;&gt; Was it when he had Ishmael? Was it when he had Isaac? The fact is that in the mind of God, he always was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The truth of this is that there was nothing that had to happen that would make Abraham a father of many nations. because that is what he was. And I know I know I I meant to say when I started this thought may challenge you and I know it is and I thank God for it because it challenges me on a daily level. &gt;&gt; God never said, "I want you to do this and that." God never told Abraham to believe him. No, but then we we'll become that when we believe. Well, that's not what God said. &gt;&gt; God did not say, Abraham, Abraham, when you believe me, you will be a father of men and nations. Because if believing is if we have to believe to become then that's a condition. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said there's no strings tied. There's no condition. It's totally 100% unconditional. So not even Abraham's belief was going to bring this to pass. That's right. Now, I don't know where you live, but I know where I live, right? And sometimes I I feel like in my own life that that things aren't happening because of my my lack of belief. &gt;&gt; But God never said, "The more you believe, the more I'll develop you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God never said, "The more you believe, the more I'll bless you." The blessing that God said to Abraham was unconditional. God said, "I will bless thee." He never said, "I will bless thee when." &gt;&gt; He never said, "I'll bless you when you pay tithes." He never said, "I'll bless you when to come to church." He never said, "When I'll bless you when you shake the pastor's hand." He never He never put a condition on it. It was totally 100% unconditional that Abraham was blessed before he was blessed. So what could Abraham do to become what he was? [snorts] It's it's bizarre, isn't it? Like what what can you do to become what God has told you you are? Like God has said, you're the per perfect, virtuous, sinless, unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ, and then you go out and try and be it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know how you work because I work the same. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; What can you do to make yourself what God has said you are? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, but Dan, the the the see the secret to this, brother Dan, is that God came to Abraham after the sign of circumcision. &gt;&gt; Well, no, he didn't. &gt;&gt; God come to Abram when he was Abraham was Abram. &gt;&gt; God come God told Abram who he was before he received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Which means the sign of circumcision didn't make Abraham a father of many nations. &gt;&gt; Which means that Abraham's name change didn't make Abraham the father of many nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what can you do? What can I do? Come on. There should be something that we have to do with this. Right? This was Israel's greatest mistake. They wanted to put their hand to the wheel. &gt;&gt; They wanted something to do for themselves to to satisfy a a pride. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, what can you do, bride? &gt;&gt; To be who God says you are. [laughter] It's a little bit controversial. Maybe it's not so much for you. Maybe it's more controversial for the older ones because of what we've come up through. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; But you have older parents. What can you be? What can you do to make you who you God has said you are? God never said to Abram, "If you do this and that, you'll become this &gt;&gt; because it's unconditional." &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham became a father of many nations because Abraham was a father of many nations before Abraham was a father of many nations. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think I'm crazy. So, how did God want Abraham to approach life? Through the revelation of what he was, not what he was going when when I do this, I'll be that. Once I have Isaac, then then then I'll be. How does God want you to approach life? Through the revelation [clears throat] of who you are. Through the word of the Lord for your day. What has he called you? &gt;&gt; I need to move quicker. Am I going backwards? I am going backwards. We looked at this one. So, let's look at the same line of thought. What What could Gideon do to become what God said he was? Well, Dan, he had to fight a fight. Did he? Yeah, that's beautiful &gt;&gt; because God come to him before he fortified. &gt;&gt; God come to Gideon be when he was overcome with fear. &gt;&gt; God didn't come to Gideon when Gideon was polishing his shield, oiling his boots, or sharpening his sword. God come to Gideon be when Gideon was threshing wheat hiding from the Midianites. When Gideon was overcome in fear, Gideon didn't have a reputation of a warrior. Abraham didn't have a reputation of being a father. But God came and said, "You are." &gt;&gt; Gideon didn't have a reputation. His father probably didn't have a reputation of being a mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God come and said he was. There was there was nothing in Gideon's life to testify that Gideon was a man of war. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There was nothing in Abram's life to testify that he was a father. He didn't have a a a personal family tree. He didn't have children. He didn't have have, you know, pictures of of his sons and daughters around the room. He wasn't a father. &gt;&gt; There was nothing in a natural to testify of who Abram was. &gt;&gt; What God said he was. And when I heard the message of the hour, when you first heard the message of the hour, and when that message called you bride, there may have been nothing in your life. There was nothing in your life that testified of who you were. &gt;&gt; But God said you are. &gt;&gt; So this story of Gideon here proves that God can look past the current conditions. God can look beyond history. &gt;&gt; Because why? God can look into eternity. &gt;&gt; All right? God is not looking at the external. God is looking at the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is looking at what he predestinated. And when God come down to Gideon, Gide God wasn't talking to the outer man. God was talking to the inner man cuz there was an inner man in Gideon that Gideon knew nothing about. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's the same thing when you heard the message of the hour. There the there's an inner person within you. There's the seed of the most high. There's the royal seed that is within you. And it's he that he's talking to. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because that seed is that word. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; when Gideon said, "Thou sorry." When the Lord said, "Thou mighty man of valor," that seed was that word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Gideon was that word. &gt;&gt; That's why there's a there's a seed within you. There's a there's a there's a bride seed that was in you. We know it's the royal seed, but it's the it's the feminine part of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the word that has come is speaking to that seed and causes a reaction within that seed. A reaction that this body can't produce for itself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. What could Gideon do to become what he was? Well, Banny, in order for him to be who he was, he had to go to church and he had to pay tithes. Really? Because when I read that, I see no conditions. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I just see God revealing Gideon as a mighty man [clears throat] of valor. &gt;&gt; And you know what's after that? Full stop. &gt;&gt; Not if, when, one day. &gt;&gt; This was thus sayaeth the Lord. Thi this was Gideon and we have received thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; The message calls you bride &gt;&gt; before the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, if you want a quote to back that up, Brother Brennan says you you you were the new re being reborn doesn't make you seed. &gt;&gt; The reason you can be reborn or born again is because you &gt;&gt; are seed, &gt;&gt; not will be, &gt;&gt; you are. So the things that God does in your life are the result of what you are. The the message of the hour doesn't make you bride. Believing this message &gt;&gt; does not make you bride. &gt;&gt; It does not make you bride. Otherwise you Gideon, thou art a mighty man of valor if you believe me. Believing this message doesn't make you bride. Believing this message come to reveal you as bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you are overcome with fear, &gt;&gt; I'm stopping because I need to get through it. Okay, let's go get down to a little bit of a nitty-gritty and maybe some little tender points that you might go home and tell your pastors or mom and dad about. But when you stopped cutting your hair, sisters, it didn't make you bright. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, "Gideon, thou art a mighty man of valor if you refrain from wearing shorts." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, "Sisters, thou art a mighty sister of valor. If you stop cutting your hair, It doesn't say Gideon, thou art a mighty man of valor. Thou wil be a mighty man of valor when you start paying tithes. &gt;&gt; Because there is no strings attached. &gt;&gt; The problem is we attach strings. &gt;&gt; We absolutely 100% do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me let me ask you a question here. Do overcomers overcome? &gt;&gt; Let me ask you another question. How do you become an overcomer if you're not an overcomer? &gt;&gt; Exactly right. It's like saying to me h to me like how how do how do I become a man if I'm not a man? &gt;&gt; Well, the reason I'm a man is because I'm a man. &gt;&gt; So, do do overcomers overcome or is it when you overcome you become an overcomer? Because I don't know how you overcome if you're not an overcomer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Overcoming doesn't make you an overcomer. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's like saying here &gt;&gt; did Gideon become a mighty man of valor when he fought his first fight and won? He had to win. There's my time. I'll just push restart another 45 minutes. You understand what I mean? Because this is not conditional and this is what the message of the outcome come to do the the who who is the overcomer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; She is the overcomer. When do you become bride? You always have been. You've just been revealed as bride. And because you are bride, you are an overcomer. &gt;&gt; But the the problem with me, okay, I don't know about you. The problem with me is my thinking. Yes. &gt;&gt; The problem with me is when, you know, in order for me to sit with him in his throne with him, you know, I've I've got to I've got to overcome. &gt;&gt; I've got to I've anyone who sits there has got to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you this. Who sits with the groom? &gt;&gt; Brother, do you have the Bible on there that you can bring up on here? Revelations 3 21 or 22 to let me get it for you because this is this is amazing and this is worth another 5 minutes. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcome over came and sat down with my father in his throne. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you is this a condition &gt;&gt; to him that overcometh because if it's a condition the covenant is not unconditional. But that's how we read it &gt;&gt; as a condition. &gt;&gt; But the key here is to him &gt;&gt; and you can go through the message and study this out to him. Who who is him? &gt;&gt; Because the prophet come to say she is him [clears throat] &gt;&gt; to him that overcomemeth. Who is him? She is him. him is the word. &gt;&gt; So, so Revelations 3:21 is not a condition &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:21 is a statement &gt;&gt; of what you will do &gt;&gt; because you are him, &gt;&gt; right? The bride is a part of him because you are a part of him. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are a part of him. He was an overcomer. He overcame because he was an overcomer. &gt;&gt; The same way the scripture says that I overcome, you will overcome. And he overcome by the faith or through the faith of who he was. &gt;&gt; He didn't have faith. And this is another problem with our thinking. Well, when I overcome, then I'll have faith to believe. No. Because you have faith, you are able to overcome. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, so this is really important because throughout the years this has been preached. This has been talked about, this has been read in your our own personal lives as a condition that the bride must meet in order to sit with him in in his throne. Do you know what that means? That means God's future is based upon our performance. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And it's totally wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's totally 100% wrong because our future, God's future, the groom's future is not dependent upon the bride's performance, but the bride's future is dependent upon the groom's performance. &gt;&gt; Because it is the groom that reveals the bride. And when he reveals you to be the him, [clears throat] when he reveals the bride to be him, cuz that's what he's saying, right? &gt;&gt; When when the the message did more than identify you as a bride, you you need to break that down because the bride is a part of the groom. That's right. &gt;&gt; In that one word, you are word of his word. You are spirit of his spirit. You are life of his life. You are Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are a part of him. The prophet would say the same word that applies to the groom &gt;&gt; applies to the bride. Why? Because you are one. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So, what can you do to be an overcomer? Look, I tried it. It doesn't work. &gt;&gt; I've told my story here before, but maybe not to this group, but you know, when I was married to my wife, had uh our young Christopher and and um I had a problem with television. Love television. get home from work, work a hard day, sit down in front of the television. My wife would get a bit frustrated, but she's long-suffering. Thank the Lord. And uh I knew it was a problem. I knew it was doing damage to the home. I knew it was doing damage to our relationship. So, after a long long long time, it was a television. You don't see them these days. It was about this big and about that deep. you know, the little heavy ones. You know, I pulled the cord out of the wall. I We lived in a house that was about this far off the ground. I put that thing above my head and I just threw it out the door. I just felt great. I thought, I've got this thing. I've overcome it. Wow. There's another part of the story. Two, not even two weeks later, I had an LG screen. It was this big and this high with surround sound. &gt;&gt; The picture was crisper. The other one was like snowflakes. It was It was bigger. It was better. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I was trying to overcome. &gt;&gt; I was trying to be an overcomer by overcoming. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But God said I'm an overcomer. &gt;&gt; And if I'm an overcomer, [snorts] well, guess what? That's what I am. That's what I'll produce. &gt;&gt; It's not something I have to try to be. What What does a father have? &gt;&gt; Children, &gt;&gt; right? What did Abraham have? Children. What What did What does a mighty man of valor do? Win battles. &gt;&gt; Right. [laughter] What does an overcomer do? Overcomes. &gt;&gt; Right. Because of who I am. So our our approach to life in our approach to our time in this life is through the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That I I actually am the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say this as I close that we have more than thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; We say brother Dan, how can you have more than that? Okay. The only way that you can have more than thus sayeth the Lord is if you are thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; because you can carry carry thus sayeth the Lord around &gt;&gt; but not have the revelation of it. But God wants you to have more than thus sayeth the Lord. God wants you to recognize that you are thus sayeth the Lord. That you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. That you are the word. That you are spirit of his spirit and life of his life. that you are his his bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And because you're his bride, you can add a list of attributes of the bride. &gt;&gt; And you know what they'll be like? &gt;&gt; His &gt;&gt; because her attributes are the same as his attributes because she is a part of him. &gt;&gt; How did he didn't over he didn't overcome uh he didn't become an overcomer when he overcame. The reason he overcame was because he was an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even but even even Jesus as as the lamb of God, he didn't become the lamb of God when he submitted himself &gt;&gt; to the will of the father. He was the lamb of God. Therefore, he submitted himself to the will of the father. Now, I need to probably just add this in there when we're talking about hair and and those different things. The reason you believe is because of who you are. &gt;&gt; The reason you stop doing what the world does is because of who you are. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make you who you are. It's because of who you are. &gt;&gt; All right? So, so it it's not okay. It's not God doesn't want you to cut your hair. &gt;&gt; But just to stop cutting your hair doesn't make you bride. That's a false security. &gt;&gt; God wants you to recognize who you are and therefore and as a result of who you are, he asks you to do certain things and you do it because of who you are, not trying to be who you who God wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Because that's what we've done for too long in the message. We've tried to do things to to try and justify to ourselves who we are, that we are the word. Well, look at me. Look what church I go to. I don't do this. I don't do that. I do do this. I do do that. But what's that got to do with it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what? Let me go back now. I can go back. Huh? becoming what you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Becoming what you are a as a as a young ladies and young men. You overcome as young ladies and young men. &gt;&gt; As as a older man, I overcome as an older man. I I have the same struggles that perhaps some of you do, but I have different struggles, too. Right? So, this is what we're doing. We're we're becoming what we are. &gt;&gt; We're not trying to make oursel anything. &gt;&gt; You're just becoming what you are. &gt;&gt; And what you are is thus sayeth the Lord. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you have any questions, then you can ask brother Elgre. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; That was speaking our language. I just love it so much. Amen. Such a very very important principle. And the what is really hard with this thing is language trips you up because it's very hard to express this principle. But you know it's it's like that example that I used on on Wednesday night. Um, for those of you who were not here, um, Brother Brandham was speaking to that man who was battling with cigarettes &gt;&gt; and and he was saying, I if I could just get rid of the cigarettes. And brother Brandham said to him, forget about the cigarettes, &gt;&gt; but I but I wish I could just get rid of these cigarettes. He said, well, forget about the cigarettes. That's not the thing we must focus on. If we just let God reveal to us who we are, then we will start overcome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and that's as simple as it is. And that really when if everything is said and done, that boils down to that revelation under the eagle anointing. When this bride knows who she is, &gt;&gt; the rapture will go because then nothing stands in our way because we believe we're overcomers. We believe we're part of the rapture. We believe that there's nothing Satan can do that can stop us. Even when we make mistakes, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter because we're overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's so good. I love it. Can the musicians come? Let's uh I'll kick us off with a song, Judah, and then you can can come back with another one. Let's give our young musicians a challenge tonight. Song with no chords. Yay.

Oh Lord, but there's no use if the preacher comes, but we're not ready, Lord. I pray that each one that will come will be ready to receive, Father. God, we commit this weekend into your hands, the rest of it, Lord, and pray that you will have your way with us, Lord. We ask it in the precious name of our Lord Jesus [music] Christ. Amen. Amen.
