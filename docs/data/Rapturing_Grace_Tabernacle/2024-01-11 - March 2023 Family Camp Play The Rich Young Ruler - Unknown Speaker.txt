TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hey babe where are the kids at? Come on kids. Time for bed. Did you brush your teeth? Yes Mom. Let me smell your breaths. Good boys. Remember what Mommy always says: If you tell the truth right the first time, you can say it again and again and again. Okay? Yes Mom. What story would you like to hear tonight. The story of the bull. Yes, the Story of the bull. Okay, let me find it here. I seen a vicious bull one day, was going to kill me. This is on record; I was a game warden at the time. I was going over the hill to pray for a sick man. And we're supposed to pack a gun, but you wouldn't go to pray for a sick man with a gun on your hand. So I took the gun and laid it in the little old truck, and crossed over through the field. And I was way out in the field and I knew... I had a--ought to of thought that this killer bull was out there, he'd just killed a colored man on a farm, Mr. Burks, just about three months before that ... Mom, speak to Jessie. Jessie! No laptop for a whole week. Boys, remember what brother Branham always said: Eternal Life is living for others. You must always live your life in such a way, that other people are blessed by it… even if that costs you some sacrifice. As you grow up, mommy wants you to always remember that. Yes, Mom. Okay time for bed. Let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, we might not have much money, but we are so glad that we have You. Where would we be without You in our lives. Please bless Darius and Jesse. Please reveal Yourself to them in Your time. Please reveal yourself to them personally. Please express your Love to them. Let them grow up to serve You with their whole hearts. Amen. Amen. Good night, boys. Hop into bed. Hop into bed. Off to bed. Good night. The boys have grown up and Darius is now married. He has started an IT business that is rapidly expanding. He is putting heart and soul into the business and is working every waking hour to make a success of it. I really enjoyed the sermon last night. Hmmm God has been so gracious to us. Hmmm You are not really listening to what I’m saying to you, are you? Hmmm So, can I buy myself a new Maserati Hmmm… What??? Say that again. I’m trying to talk to you, but you are too busy with your work again. You know I must get the planning done before tomorrow. I am busy with that big project for the government, and my guys need to know what they are doing. I understand but why don’t you come sit with me for a bit? [bell rings] Who's that? Are you going to open the door, or must I? Let me get it. Hello! I wasn’t expecting you. Hello Darius. Come in. Have a seat. It's so nice to see you all. Would you like something to drink? Funny you should say that? Yes, please. This is a nice couch you got he re, man. Yes, Just the best How's Jesse doing, mom? He's good, thank you Bonnie. Is he still working on the farm? Yea, he's still shearing the sheep and milking the cows. He's never going to make it in life. Anyways, how is my RICH young son doing? Dad! Come on mate. Business must be all good. How's it going? Everything is going well, dad. I’ve just been awarded a real big project. Probably my first real breakthrough and there's a few tenders in the pipeline. Man, I’ve got some good guys working for me. I can't do it without them. And what about the Lord, Darius? He is the One that has blessed you with all these talents and you couldn’t do it without HIM. Yes, mom. Of course! You know I love the Message. That goes without saying. It should go WITH saying, son. Yes. Of, course. Seriously, son… You've always been an example to others and all the young people, they look up to you. You're such an example So, let the Book live in you, Darius. What your mother says is right. You always need to put God first. Remember who you are and remember what your purpose is on earth. [Mobile phone ringing] He's going to be on the phone for a long time. I guess that's our queue to go. I still need to do the muso roster anyway, so... Thank you for coming. Can I get a hand? Thank you. Thank you for that coffee. Do you have to work again? Come sit with me please. Just five minutes. Okay my darling. I'll come now. Just give me a moment. Would it be okay if I just do my daily tweet. Yea, sure. Where is that quote that I saw earlier? Oh, yes… here it is: Copy… Paste… Hey Bonnie, listen to this quote that I have just tweeted: He walked to the mountain, and the mountain opened up, and he went in. The shelves was full of gold and diamonds, as the little fairy story goes. He laid the flower down on a rock. And he run and grabbed a great big gem, and he said, “I must go show this to my friends. And now I’m a rich man. I have everything now. I must show this.” And so the flower spoke, “But,” said, “you have forgot the main thing.” So he runs back and picks up, said, “Well, maybe I’ll—I’ll get a piece of gold. I’ll get a piece of silver.” And so he said, “I’ll—I’ll hurry out, to tell the people how rich I am, and what all I’ve got.” 100 And he got to the door, and the flower said, “But you forgot the main thing.” So he runs back again. He said, “In here we find all kinds of materials.” So, he picked up a stone. He said, “I’ll go, take this stone and show the people what kind of a stone this mountain is made out of, so I can find my way back to it.” See? And he started out the door, and the flower said, for its final time, “You have forgot the main thing.” “Oh,” he said, “oh, shut up.” See, he didn’t want to hear it anymore, “Forgot the main thing,” and he ran out the door. And when he did, the door closed behind him, with the flower on the inside. The main thing was the flower. See? The main thing was the flower. “Always remember the main thing” That’s very striking, Darius, but are we doing that? Of course we are, honey. We’re in the Message? We go to church. don’t we? Most weeks… unless I’m too tired… We seem to be too tired very often lately. Don’t interrupt me, Bonnie! I’m trying to make a point! … Where was I. … Oh, yes… we go to church at least every other week, then. We probably go more than Simon. And we pay 10% of our income as tithes. Do you know how much my tithes is? Imagine if we had all that extra money for ourselves? And we love the Lord, don’t you agree? Sometimes I wonder if there’s not more. Sometimes in my heart, I feel like there’s a thirst for more of God. To be honest… sometimes I have the same thing. I’m just so busy that I never get time to really stop and think about it. … I tell you what I will do. I will phone the pastor and talk to him about it. Hello brother David… It’s Darius here. … Yes, nice to speak to you too. … I’m sorry, I’ve just been SO busy. … Yes, I know, brother David. Yes… priorities. Well, that’s actually why I phoned you: I wonder if I could come see you. I would like to discuss heart matters with you. … No, nothing wrong with my … … No, they are fine… … Business is fine. … No… no not at all. I just want to FEEL more. I … … Yes! Yes, like that! … Thursday is difficult. Actually, what about Saturday? … Oh, preparing for Sunday… of course… I understand. … An exception for me… no it shouldn’t take long… … Okay. 5pm on Saturday. I appreciate that very much. … God bless Yes, see you then. Yes, I will pass your regards to her. It is now Saturday afternoon and time for Darius’s visit to the pastor. Take a seat, Darius. Can I offer you some water. No thanks, I’ve just had something to drink. Shall I just ask the Lord’s blessing on our meeting. Lord Jesus, we ask your guidance, etc… … Okay Darius, I will let you talk. What can I help you with? Well, brother David, as I said on the phone… Life is good… business is good … I have no complaints from a natural perspective … I enjoy what I’m doing … and the Lord has blessed me with a wonderful wife… … and honestly, I have nothing to complain about. But in my heart, something seems to be amiss. Sometimes it feels like I am dead on the inside… and when I listen to the Message … I don’t have that excitement that I used to have. Do you have any unrepented sin in your life? You know, how the prophet says that if we have unrepented sin, the devil has a right to be there. I’ve wondered about that… and I can honestly say that I am living according to the standards of the Message. My parents taught me all the things that God requires of me … and since my youth I have tried to abide by those things. I’ve been coming to church all my life… I got baptised as a teenager … and I have never doubted that this Message is the truth. I dress right… I try to act right… I want to go to Heaven. I don’t want to be left behind. I’ve come too far to miss it now. I want to spend eternity with my family … and with Bonnie … and with you, of course. But I’m not sure what more I can do to inherit eternal life. The Holy Spirit seems to impress on me that there is one thing lacking, Darius. Remember how the Bible says that we cannot serve God and Mammon? Also: do you remember the 3 traps that Brother Branham warned us about? Women… popularity … and ??? Money … But wasn’t that just for the ministry? It WAS for the ministry too… but it is Satan’s three-pronged attack that he will try on every son of God. Those are areas in our make-up that we should always keep covered. What are you saying, brother David? What does that have to do with me? You are gifted with technology and business, Darius. And your gifts are making you popular… even in the eyes of the world… But have you surrendered your gifts completely to God? Have you really put God first in everything? And you ARE making a lot of money. But there’s nothing wrong with having money! I’ve worked hard for everything I have. I never want to be poor again. Do you have any idea how hard it is when everyone around you can afford things and you can’t. I believe God has blessed me with everything I have achieved. Many people say that MONEY is the root of all evil… but that is not what the Bible says. The Bibles says the LOVE of money is the root of all evil. You know your quotes, Darius… but is Jesus Christ number 1 in your life? That is interesting: I just tweeted that quote about the man who found that flower who gave him access to the mountain full of riches… Yes, I saw your tweet. … so have you forgotten the main thing? I go to church. I pay my tithes. I live the life of a Message believer. I read my Bible. I pray often… and God blesses me. I can give testimony after testimony of how He miraculously helped me to complete difficult projects. How can you insinuate I have forgotten the main thing? I am not accusing you, Darius… I’m asking YOU the question. The Bible says we must judge ourselves so that we won’t be judged at the white throne. … So, when you look in the mirror of the Word, where do you stand? So, are you saying I have a love of money? What does your heart tell you? So, what should I do, then? You know there was a young fellow in the Bible that asked Jesus the same question. The rich young ruler? Uh-huh… Can you remember what Jesus told him? Do you really expect me to sell everything I have and give it all away? Times have changed… I don’t believe it would be God’s will to dump Bonnie and the children into financial ruin. I don’t want to put my children through the same poverty that I had as a child. I believe what God is telling you … … is that you should love HIM more than money. But I believe I DO love Him more. I can’t be the judge of that, Darius… that is between you and God… but your strong protest tells me that you are not too sure of that yourself. … What would the evidence be that you love God more than anything? I don’t know? … that I come to church when other people don’t … … that I dress and act like a Message believer when many of my friends have walked away… … that I give donations to the mission fund when hardly anyone in church does? No, Darius. Those things should happen automatically when you LOVE God right. … When you LOVE Him right… you put Him above everything and everyone else. … Do you know what brother Branham says eternal life is? Yes… my mother always quoted that to me. I want you to say it, Darius. Do I have to? It would do you good to hear it again: Eternal life is …. Living for others. Perhaps God doesn’t expect you to give everything away like the rich young ruler … … but perhaps that voice that you hear in your heart is telling you that your love of money is more than your love for God or His people. I just can’t see that to be the case. Perhaps God wants to say to you that you should give other people the benefit of the gifts that God have placed in you, rather than just keeping it all to yourself. Can I read you a quote? Sure. The prophet says in a sermon “Law Or Grace”: Women put perfume on themselves for a pleasant. And men puts after-shave stuff on, sometimes, like that; that odors, foul odors, would be taken away from you. When you walk into the presence of someone, with body odors or with something another, perfumes is to take that odor away; so that you, in the presence of the person, that you might not be foul. It’s unbearable. 113 … Jesus said…See, He was the Rose of Sharon, and He was offered to God as a sweet-smelling Savour. …And then when we become unbearable before God, and … so stinky, … that our sins and things are so bad and so foul, then we come to Calvary … 114 … You take a flower, it’s beautiful; a big morning lily, or a rose. The Rose of Sharon is a beautiful flower. While it’s a living, it’s beautiful. But to get odor out of that, to get a perfume, it has to be crushed. And they crush it and squeeze the perfume out of it. 115 You see, Christ, when He was here on earth, He was beautiful. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. His life was never compared. He was beautiful. … 116 And to make us well pleased to God, He had to become crushed on Calvary, and the sin of this world had to squeeze out the life, out of Him. And He died, bearing the sins of the world, that we might be anointed with the Rose of Sharon. He was the Lily of the Valley. “He was wounded for our transgressions,” a sweet-smelling Savour. “By His stripes you were healed,” the Lily of the Valley that give us the opium, to ease our sicknesses and pain. What a marvelous picture! Now, Darius, that lily or that rose gives his perfume for others to enjoy. The gifts in our lives are for others, not for ourselves. That is the example that Jesus lived before us… He was crushed for our sakes. His Life was poured out to make a way for us to smell beautiful before God. … and as you know: He was our wave sheaf. Like that lily or that rose, Jesus gave EVERYTHING He was … so that WE could benefit from HIS Life… and He WAS eternal Life. In fact, He IS eternal Life He never kept His holiness for Himself… He lived a life for others. That is hard! I don’t know if I can do it. I’m just at the point where things are starting to look up in my business… Why do others have to benefit from all MY hard work. I will be praying for you, Darius. A few years have gone by, and Darius’s business is booming. Darius and his family are living the high life. He has opened offices all over the world and is often away on business trips.

The best way to ensure success in anything, is to put all your focus onto it. Until then! Stay happy and healthy! ✌🏼 God bless you👍🏼 Hey, Laz. Yes, Bro. How many times to I have to tell you? At work, it is Boss or Darius… not Bro or Brother. Sorry, Boss. My Bad. When is that tech show that you were going to get tickets for? Oh, no! I knew there was something I was forgetting. I forgot to tell your P.A. but the show is on today. I obviously pay you too much. Can’t anyone do some proper work, around here? Why am I surrounded by people like this? What’s this, Laz? Don’t know, Boss. It’s an idiot sandwich. Boss, I actually wanted to speak to you about my pay. I can’t even feed my family on my current pay rate… not even to speak about maintaining the household. Laz, do you see this business that I have built up… … with God’s help, of course … But it was MY hard work and effort that has gone into making it what it is. This company didn’t come out of nothing. You want things just to be handed to you… … in your mind, you think like a beggar, Laz. No, mate. If you want more pay, I would need to see a lot more output from you. But boss, that’s not fair. I work hard every day… in fact, more hours than what I’m paid for… and I’m loyal to your company. I see you as a brother. That’s enough of that. I need to get to the conference. Look at all the people. I didn’t realise this show was so popular. I will look around and see if there are any well-known people that I can take my picture with. Oh, wow! Look who’s here!!! It’s Tech Tornado and Code Crusader! Girl, Look who’s here! Are you who I think you are? Are YOU who we think YOU are? I’m such a fan of your tech channel. As we are of yours! It is so exciting to meet you! Would you mind if I took a picture with you for my tech show tweet? Yes, of course. We’d be flattered. Can we take one with you for our Instagram page. Thank you. It was lovely to meet you. And you! Guess who I bumped into at the tech show today. Upload picture. And send. I guess I can head home now. I’ve seen enough. Good afternoon, RYR enterprises, focusing on things that matter – Can I help you? … Yes, it’s me speaking. … Oh, sister Laz… are you okay? You sound terrible! What??? When did this happen? And there was nothing they could do for him? … on the way to the morgue already … I am so sorry for your huge loss. We’ll be praying for you. Let me know if there is anything you need that we can do for you. Okay… God bless you. Bye Who was that? You look shocked! Are you okay? That was Sister Lazarus on the phone. Yes? Laz was on the way to our Hangarau site and was involved in a head-on collision… He was declared dead on the spot. Wow, that’s shocking! Can you remember your last words to him? Yes, sister Felicity. I called him an idiot sandwich… … but I didn’t mean any harm … … I just … Somebody, call the ambulance! I think, Darius had a heart attack! Both Lazarus and Darius are dead. Darius finds himself in the regions of the lost. Just a note here: Although, we recognize that Lazarus and Darius are in two separate dimensions, we will let them interact just for purposes of demonstration. I am homesick and blue, and I want to see Jesus; I would like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime; It would brighten my path and would vanish all fears; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. Hello, my precious brother. Your earthly toil is all over. Wow, this is indescribable… is this what perfect Love feels like? It is just sublime. Aren’t you Brother Branham? Yes, my brother. Welcome to the joys of the Lord. You had it hard on earth… but all that is now something of the past. You stood for Jesus on earth and now you have come to your reward. Mommy!!! … Daddy!!! … Somebody, help me. I’m in torment! … Brother Branham… can you hear me? Yes, Darius Brother Branham, is Lazarus there with you? Yes, he is here on this side. Please send him to me to bring me some cool water. I am tormented here. We can’t cross to your dimension, Darius… Besides, you treated him like dirt on earth while you lived in luxury… He is no longer your slave for you to trample on. You had a life of comfort on earth while Lazarus had to be content with the crumbs that you let him have… But he chose the hard way. Despite his difficult life, he served the Lord with all his heart. But I gave him a job. It was thanks to ME that he even HAD a job. I went to church. I was in the Message… YOUR Message! I paid tithes… a lot of tithes… I read my Bible… I did everything God told me to! Did you? I want to tell you a secret: Do you know why God blessed you in business? It was not because you were so special… it was because of the sacrifices your ancestors made for God… and God will sometimes bless many generations because of a sacrifice of a parent. Let me ask you again: When God spoke to you though your mother… and told you that eternal life was living for others … Did you follow that Word? But … That was God speaking through your mother. When God spoke to you through your parents, telling you to put God first … did you? I did! I testified for Him… I even spoke about God on my YouTube channel. Many people probably heard about God through that. Darius, if you are honest with yourself, you know the truth. God was speaking to you through your mother and father. And when your pastor reminded you of that quote, not to forget the main thing… that was God speaking to you. In fact, God was speaking to you week after week through the ministry. God was desiring you to follow Him with ALL your heart. But a lot of your religious actions… were driven by pride. You wanted the applause of man… just like the Pharisees did all those years ago. Your motive was not always pure, Darius. Lazarus made good choices in hard circumstances … … but you made selfish choices in much easier circumstances. I wish I heeded the Voice of God speaking through my loved ones. Can you send someone to my wife to warn her? Please tell Bonnie to treat our workers better. Please tell her to give more to the needy! Please tell her to really focus on the main thing! Can you send someone to church to warn them? Please send someone to the Rapturing Grace Tabernacle … … to warn them that it is more than just going to church… … it is more than just being in the Message… … it is more than just following the rules. I was following the rules, but my HEART was not sold out to the main thing. I wish I can go back and change that! God is warning them of exactly those things… week after week across the pulpit … … day after day through His Word and through loved ones. The Bible says that the way the tree leans, is the way it falls. Lazarus has now gone on to his reward… and you to yours. In the Message “Investments”, that the prophet preached in Chicago, on the morning of th 30th of August, 196, the prophet says: 78 Well, there was a law of God, that under the blood of a lamb, that didn't take away sin, it just scattered it. And when man sinned, he crossed the great chasm, when he sinned, away, he separated himself away from God, leaving hisself no way back. But God, in tender mercy, accepted a substitute for him, and this substitute lasted for thousands of years; but it wouldn't take away sin, it only covered up sin. But when, not manufactured... 79 But God, in His creative power, created a Blood cell, without sexual desire, in the womb of the virgin; that don't only cover sin, it omits sin. It--it takes it so far away till it's never in the mind of God again. It don't make a bridge across the chasm, but it moves the chasm. ... Drop this little drop of ink into that bottle of bleach, or whatever it might be, you will never find that color again. But friends, we don’t access that pardon by just talking about the Message… the Message must be our main thing. God wants us to serve Him with ALL our hearts and come to Him in a spirit of true repentance.
