[35:59] [Applause]
[36:06] amen hallelujah
[36:09] hallelujah it just seems that the lord
[36:12] has a theme this morning on his heart
[36:13] because things have been just
[36:15] aligning in a specific way and just
[36:17] trust that we
[36:18] my god's grace can end in what he has
[36:20] for us this morning i'd like to welcome
[36:22] each and every one back in the house of
[36:23] the lord this morning
[36:24] it's been a week and a half since we've
[36:26] been here in the building together
[36:28] i mean we've had a wonderful weekend
[36:30] last weekend and i trust that
[36:32] that he's still on a high from that but
[36:34] we we certainly missed wednesday night
[36:37] and i want to say welcome back i wonder
[36:40] if i could just ask you to take your
[36:41] seats just for a moment
[36:43] um i just don't want to keep you
[36:45] standing but i won't be long
[36:48] um firstly i would like to do also
[36:50] welcome our visitors brother dazzle and
[36:52] sister laverne and the young ones
[36:54] it's a privilege to have you real
[36:56] special privilege
[36:57] that you uh that you come down i always
[37:01] always marvel that we had to come to new
[37:02] zealand to meet you here
[37:04] but you know the lord has his ways and
[37:07] the lord has his plans and lord has
[37:08] every one of those things under his
[37:10] control
[37:11] so we just thank the lord for that um
[37:14] also thank you very much for that song
[37:16] item it's always
[37:18] always special to have you do a song
[37:19] item and you would
[37:21] let us down if you didn't do it amen god
[37:24] bless you
[37:27] and then just a reminder that god
[37:29] willing will have a general prayer
[37:31] meeting again
[37:32] on friday for those who can make it over
[37:36] lunchtime
[37:37] so 12 o'clock here on on friday so
[37:40] anyone interested to come you're welcome
[37:41] to do that
[37:45] then you would you would probably
[37:49] notice and and if you haven't i'll tell
[37:51] you now that
[37:52] brother brother joseph has spent a good
[37:55] portion of the week here
[37:56] and uh brother jonathan also um
[38:00] quite a few hours here to support them
[38:02] and got some late
[38:03] nights and probably
[38:07] robbed the families in their sleep
[38:09] patterns a little bit
[38:10] but they've put in a lot of effort to
[38:13] redo the sound in the church
[38:15] and just clean things up in in
[38:18] so many ways and just um i'm really
[38:20] excited about the changes
[38:22] and although they will be slightly
[38:24] marginal they'll they
[38:26] um you know in some ways if you're
[38:28] you've got to train yeah you'll probably
[38:29] appreciate it more than i do
[38:31] but certainly the sound is a lot crisper
[38:34] and
[38:35] and cleaner than it was and that's
[38:36] exciting and also
[38:38] the brother joseph has set it up that
[38:41] it's that it's got stereo sound now and
[38:43] just
[38:43] for that little bit more complete sound
[38:46] and so on so but
[38:47] the reason why i'm saying that is so if
[38:48] there's a few hiccups here and there
[38:50] please
[38:51] just be with us and and
[38:54] you know if it's if it's um hurting your
[38:57] ears or anything just let joseph know
[38:59] i'm sure he's gonna
[39:00] he's gonna appreciate that right
[39:07] um you know and the reason i'm saying
[39:08] that is that
[39:10] that the system is generally a little
[39:12] more towards the treble side
[39:14] now than it was um and and
[39:17] in order to get the sound a lot cleaner
[39:19] so maybe our ears are just not used to
[39:21] the treble so we'll see how that goes
[39:25] and then also these um we
[39:29] we had the working be a couple weeks ago
[39:31] and got a ton of things done
[39:34] um but there's still quite a few things
[39:36] that needs to be done around the church
[39:37] and
[39:38] we're running out of good weather season
[39:41] very soon so i want to say if there's
[39:44] any brothers that
[39:45] that has time during the day
[39:49] during the week to to help
[39:52] with a few things i would really
[39:53] appreciate that if you can just make
[39:55] contact with me
[39:56] if you if you are willing and have the
[39:58] time to help
[40:00] so it's not not all fun jobs but it's
[40:03] jobs that need to be done
[40:04] nonetheless and it would be nice if we
[40:06] can get those things sorted out
[40:09] so i appreciate that
[40:15] yes i think that's what we have for this
[40:17] morning
[40:19] so now it's my privilege to uh to
[40:22] introduce brother dazzle we'll we won't
[40:24] get him upright yet but
[40:25] really excited to have her brother here
[40:27] this morning and and
[40:29] just just looking forward we had a
[40:31] lovely
[40:32] youth meeting on friday night and
[40:36] i made a bunch of notes and and really
[40:38] got inspired to perhaps use the
[40:40] some of the principles in a service in
[40:42] the next week or two we'll see how the
[40:44] lord leads but really enjoyed it and i
[40:45] can really highly
[40:47] highly recommend some of those thoughts
[40:51] so let's stand together and take your
[40:53] needs to the lord this morning
[40:59] amen if you have a need on your heart
[41:01] you can express it to the lord
[41:05] our most wonderful savior

[41:52] your attribute of savior father

[53:46] as i looked around yeah you you see
[53:48] there are people sitting here
[53:50] this morning ministers of the gospel
[53:53] that obviously would be able to preach
[53:55] much better or even
[53:57] present whatever the lord has laid in my
[53:58] heart in a much better way than i can
[54:01] but i just trust that the lord will just
[54:04] lead
[54:04] the service this morning so god richly
[54:07] bless you
[54:09] and as we just stand to our feet i've
[54:12] got the three
[54:13] uh portions of scripture that i'd like
[54:15] to read and it's um
[54:17] it's very well known scriptures and uh
[54:21] i will see how the lord will just lead
[54:23] it and it's just
[54:24] a burden that's within me and i trust
[54:27] that i want to release that this morning
[54:30] malachi 4 chapter 5
[54:34] chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 in its
[54:37] uh majority of us um
[54:41] should be able to just quote it off by
[54:44] heart i remember growing up
[54:46] back in south africa and my mom and dad
[54:50] asked me what is malachi 4 5 and 6
[54:52] i would be able to just you know quote
[54:54] it off by a heart because this pertains
[54:56] to you and to me
[54:58] i'll just read it it says behold i will
[55:01] send you elijah the prophet
[55:03] before the coming of the great and
[55:06] dreadful day of the lord
[55:09] and he shall turn the heart of the
[55:11] fathers to the children
[55:14] and the heart of the children to their
[55:16] fathers
[55:17] lest i come and smite the earth
[55:20] with a curse as i read that i said lord
[55:24] thank you for this message
[55:27] of grace of perfection of adoption
[55:32] there's another scripture i'd like to
[55:33] just read it's found in the book of
[55:36] philippians
[55:38] um philippians chapter three i think
[55:42] philippians chapter four just a few
[55:45] verses there um
[55:48] i'll read 13 14 and i love verse 15
[55:52] verse 13 if you have it it says brethren
[55:55] i count not myself to have
[55:57] apprehended but this one thing i do
[56:02] forgetting those things which are behind
[56:06] and reaching forth unto those things
[56:09] which are before
[56:11] i press towards the mark for the prize
[56:15] of the high calling of god in christ
[56:18] jesus and i like verse 15
[56:22] it says let us therefore
[56:25] as many as be perfect be
[56:29] thus minded but i like the second part
[56:33] it says and
[56:34] if in anything you be
[56:37] otherwise minded maybe you don't see it
[56:40] the way the word
[56:41] has presented it to you
[56:44] the scripture says that god shall
[56:48] reveal even this
[56:51] unto you i when i read that portion of
[56:55] scripture i
[56:56] see the grace of god
[57:00] extended to me
[57:05] i i read the scripture i don't see any
[57:07] judgmental stuff there
[57:09] i say paul say you know what if you
[57:10] don't see things my way
[57:12] it's okay god will come your way and he
[57:15] will reveal it
[57:16] to you i love that
[57:20] and then the lost scripture is a very
[57:22] well-known scripture
[57:25] uh first thessalonians chapter 4
[57:30] and then we can pray and take our seeds
[57:32] this morning
[57:35] first thessalonians verse 4 um i'll read
[57:39] from verse
[57:40] 15 it says for this
[57:43] we say unto you by the word of the lord
[57:46] that we
[57:46] which are alive and remain unto the
[57:49] coming of the lord shall not
[57:51] prevent them which are asleep for the
[57:54] lord himself
[57:55] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[57:58] with the voice of the archangel and with
[58:00] the trump of god
[58:01] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[58:04] then we which are alive and remain shall
[58:08] be caught up together
[58:10] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[58:12] in the air
[58:13] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[58:17] wherefore comfort one another
[58:21] with these words lord jesus your word
[58:25] has been
[58:26] read this morning and father we are
[58:29] totally dependent upon you lord
[58:33] so we just pray that you lead and we
[58:36] want to
[58:36] follow you this morning meet every need
[58:39] i don't know the needs of god
[58:42] in the house this morning in the
[58:44] sanctuary father
[58:45] but you know the need i pray father that
[58:49] you
[58:50] would meet the individual need this
[58:53] morning is my prayer
[58:55] in jesus name we pray amen and amen god
[58:59] bless you you
[59:00] may be seated this morning in the
[59:02] presence of almighty god
[59:07] i've i've
[59:11] let me just read
[59:17] quotations i'd like to read before i go
[59:19] into the thought this morning and
[59:23] i like i like brother brandon when i
[59:25] when i
[59:27] as i listen to sermons of brother
[59:30] branham
[59:32] i love the practicalities
[59:36] of things that i see
[59:39] and it makes me realize that you know
[59:41] this this
[59:42] walk that we're walking is this this
[59:45] message
[59:46] that we're following it's it's it's not
[59:49] a
[59:49] complicated message
[59:52] um and i say that because i grew up
[59:56] uh and maybe a few many of you might
[59:59] know my my testimony but
[1:00:01] i i grew up thinking that this
[1:00:05] is a complicated message
[1:00:08] i grew up you know wanting
[1:00:12] to sound complicated
[1:00:16] because the more complicated i sounded
[1:00:19] the more
[1:00:20] you know uh intelligent i
[1:00:23] thought i was that the more you know uh
[1:00:27] spiritual um i thought i was
[1:00:32] but um i've come to realize you know as
[1:00:35] you
[1:00:36] i believe as we mature in christ
[1:00:41] and this message is a message that
[1:00:45] is maturing us thank you brother already
[1:00:48] and i realize as you mature that it's
[1:00:51] a it's a god in simplicity
[1:00:55] and i think you know if you look at
[1:00:56] brother brandon when he when he went to
[1:00:58] preach the seals
[1:01:00] he started out with god in simplicity
[1:01:05] and i believe i think it was late on in
[1:01:08] albuquerque new mexico he preached god
[1:01:11] in
[1:01:11] simplicity so it is god in
[1:01:15] simplicity so young people i want you to
[1:01:18] grasp
[1:01:19] the fact that this is not a complicated
[1:01:23] message
[1:01:24] it's a message that can come down to
[1:01:28] your
[1:01:28] seat all you have to do is you need to
[1:01:32] say
[1:01:32] lord i receive you i want you and i want
[1:01:36] more of you so i just want to read some
[1:01:41] real practical things this morning and
[1:01:44] then we'll we'll go into into the
[1:01:45] thought
[1:01:46] in the the message presuming brother
[1:01:48] branham he's reached the end of the
[1:01:50] service
[1:01:51] and he says while we have our heads
[1:01:54] bound he says
[1:01:56] i want to ask a real
[1:01:59] honest question to be answered
[1:02:03] and then he goes on a bit further and he
[1:02:06] starts
[1:02:07] talking to the church and he says i want
[1:02:10] you
[1:02:11] to be honest and then he says
[1:02:15] if but sean's you haven't been following
[1:02:18] the word of god maybe you just
[1:02:22] rejecting this and not doing that or not
[1:02:25] what whatever the word says you you
[1:02:27] disobedient
[1:02:28] but the brandon says i want you
[1:02:32] to be honest and then
[1:02:35] further on down he he says god bless you
[1:02:39] and he's talking to the church god bless
[1:02:41] you he says god bless you and you
[1:02:43] and you and you and you he says god
[1:02:46] bless you that's
[1:02:47] fine and then he says be honest
[1:02:52] and then he says god bless you lady
[1:02:55] so he he says god bless you god but then
[1:02:58] he starts
[1:02:58] zeroing in on somebody
[1:03:02] and he says god bless you lady god bless
[1:03:04] you and he says
[1:03:05] praise god
[1:03:08] i see you i
[1:03:11] seen a woman healed he says
[1:03:16] right then sick
[1:03:20] sitting right there and then brother
[1:03:23] branham says
[1:03:24] cause she raised the hand
[1:03:28] he says she was honest
[1:03:33] and he says she got
[1:03:36] healed now this woman came into the
[1:03:40] meeting
[1:03:41] and she allowed the word of god
[1:03:45] not the person standing here and saying
[1:03:47] things but she allowed
[1:03:49] the word of god to have an
[1:03:53] impact on her
[1:03:56] and she heard the prophet say
[1:03:59] be honest if maybe you've done things
[1:04:03] you've
[1:04:03] said things you've hurt somebody be
[1:04:06] honest
[1:04:08] raise your hands seek forgiveness
[1:04:12] and brother branham then identified this
[1:04:14] woman
[1:04:15] came in sick
[1:04:18] she was honest with herself
[1:04:22] she was honest with god
[1:04:26] and god respected
[1:04:29] the honesty that he came
[1:04:33] her way and brother branham says
[1:04:36] she was honest she
[1:04:40] got healed
[1:04:43] so simple things
[1:04:47] but god sees it and it can have
[1:04:51] major impacts in our lives
[1:04:55] another practicality in the message led
[1:04:58] by the spirited brother branham says
[1:05:01] i believe it was a few nights ago here
[1:05:04] somewhere else that he says it was
[1:05:08] a crippled woman i believe that
[1:05:12] was in jamaica that she was sitting
[1:05:15] there
[1:05:17] and she gave a place
[1:05:20] respects to a woman
[1:05:23] that had heart trouble now brother
[1:05:27] branham says he was in jamaica
[1:05:29] ministering and there was probably a
[1:05:31] prayer line
[1:05:33] and there was probably uh you know how
[1:05:35] brother brangham ordered the line
[1:05:38] and he says there was this human in the
[1:05:41] meeting
[1:05:43] and she was a crippled woman
[1:05:47] and she was standing in her position
[1:05:50] in the prayer line but brother branham
[1:05:54] says this woman
[1:05:56] she seen someone else
[1:06:00] now i don't know whether she knew that
[1:06:02] this
[1:06:03] other woman had uh brother branham says
[1:06:06] a
[1:06:06] heart condition or heart trouble but
[1:06:09] what she did brother branham says
[1:06:13] she would probably went to the human and
[1:06:15] said you come
[1:06:16] and take my place
[1:06:20] brother brandon said the woman that was
[1:06:23] crippled she had
[1:06:26] respects to someone else
[1:06:31] and the woman came where the heart
[1:06:34] trouble came and took her place
[1:06:36] but brother branham says this
[1:06:39] she gave her place respects to a woman
[1:06:42] that had heart trouble
[1:06:44] her place to stand at the line
[1:06:48] brother branham says and because she
[1:06:51] did that the holy spirit
[1:06:56] came back around and
[1:07:00] healed her and she was outside of the
[1:07:04] line
[1:07:05] but because she showed something
[1:07:09] as simple as respect
[1:07:14] god seen that simple
[1:07:18] practical application
[1:07:22] and he was so pleased with it
[1:07:25] that he came by and he
[1:07:29] healed that crippled woman
[1:07:32] but the branham says that's it he says
[1:07:35] love and show respects
[1:07:39] to one another i know this is very
[1:07:44] simple
[1:07:45] but i believe it's in these simple
[1:07:47] things
[1:07:49] that god can do wonderful and
[1:07:52] amazing things in our lives because we
[1:07:56] have to grow
[1:07:57] and we want to grow in grace
[1:08:02] just the last script uh quote what was
[1:08:05] the holy ghost given for can i take off
[1:08:07] my jacket further
[1:08:09] please thank you what was the holy ghost
[1:08:12] given for
[1:08:14] um brother branham says here
[1:08:17] um david said he would come into the
[1:08:20] congregation of the saints
[1:08:23] and make his request known so brother
[1:08:25] branham is praying a prayer and he says
[1:08:28] and tonight there has been many hands
[1:08:32] perhaps maybe
[1:08:34] i would say 80 percent of those that are
[1:08:37] sitting in this building tonight
[1:08:39] raise their hands for requests
[1:08:42] and he says lord it shows that we just
[1:08:46] can't
[1:08:47] go without you
[1:08:51] i believe this meeting here this morning
[1:08:54] it's it's it will be a waste of time
[1:08:58] if he wasn't leading guiding
[1:09:02] and directing and that is why as i stand
[1:09:05] here this morning i said lord i am
[1:09:07] so totally dependent
[1:09:10] upon you lord brother branham says
[1:09:14] lord we just can't go
[1:09:17] without you we've got to
[1:09:20] have you day by day
[1:09:24] you are our life our joy
[1:09:28] our health our sustaining strength
[1:09:32] i'll
[1:09:36] shield from the enemies
[1:09:39] and believers the you can identify i
[1:09:41] don't have to tell you this
[1:09:43] you know the enemy is off to you
[1:09:47] you know you see it you experience it
[1:09:50] he wants to destroy you
[1:09:53] because you you've got something great
[1:09:56] you've got something
[1:09:57] special and brother branham says oh god
[1:10:01] you
[1:10:02] are a shield i'll shield my shield
[1:10:06] from the enemy i teach my family
[1:10:10] i say we don't take a step outside
[1:10:13] our door without praying
[1:10:17] whether we're going to school in the
[1:10:18] morning we pray
[1:10:20] when we come back and my wife and myself
[1:10:23] maybe we decide we
[1:10:24] gonna go to the store we stand together
[1:10:27] and we pray when i go fetch my kids
[1:10:31] in the afternoon we stand and we pray
[1:10:35] because we realize the importance
[1:10:38] of prayer we realize the importance
[1:10:42] of having jesus christ
[1:10:45] always before us
[1:10:49] he says and we could not
[1:10:53] fight this battle of life
[1:10:57] this is a battle for life
[1:11:01] he says and we just could not
[1:11:05] fight this battle of life
[1:11:08] without you it would be
[1:11:12] totally impossible
[1:11:16] for us to do it now if there's
[1:11:19] anybody here this morning and especially
[1:11:22] the young people
[1:11:24] if you struggling
[1:11:28] as a christian as a message believer
[1:11:33] and you're sitting in this meeting and
[1:11:35] you realizing the reason i am struggling
[1:11:39] is because i want to do things on my own
[1:11:43] i am not asking god i am not
[1:11:46] praying i am not committing my studies
[1:11:49] i am not committing my life i am not
[1:11:52] committing things to god
[1:11:54] i want to do it on my own and that's why
[1:11:57] i'm struggling
[1:11:59] i want to encourage you this morning
[1:12:05] please the lord always
[1:12:09] before you this is a
[1:12:13] battle for life
[1:12:21] and it is not
[1:12:24] a struggle
[1:12:28] this work that we're walking
[1:12:32] it's not not a struggle and i want you
[1:12:36] if you if you ever thought that walking
[1:12:39] this this walk
[1:12:40] of perfection is a struggle i want you
[1:12:44] to know
[1:12:44] it is not a struggle
[1:12:48] yes it might be hard but
[1:12:51] when i look at i see it as a battle
[1:12:55] and in this battle i know who
[1:12:59] is the victor
[1:13:04] and it's like i think it's i think it's
[1:13:07] the book of nehemiah and ezra
[1:13:09] where they building the and
[1:13:13] the bible who talk how they uh stone in
[1:13:16] one hand
[1:13:17] balding sword in the other hand
[1:13:21] ready to fight and that should be our
[1:13:24] attitude
[1:13:26] if you look and if you take note
[1:13:30] of things that's happening around us
[1:13:33] there are so much things and it's so
[1:13:35] subtle there are many things happening
[1:13:41] but i want to encourage you invest
[1:13:45] in jesus christ
[1:13:49] therein is your strength
[1:13:53] bearing is my strength
[1:13:57] this morning
[1:14:01] i i've got a little thought
[1:14:05] and i don't always know if i'll be able
[1:14:07] because i've got a problem sometimes i
[1:14:09] give a title and
[1:14:10] i never really align myself to the title
[1:14:14] but we'll see how the lord lives but
[1:14:16] this morning i
[1:14:17] i want to impress upon your hearts this
[1:14:21] morning this is my
[1:14:22] title the title is that this
[1:14:27] message is urgent
[1:14:32] when you leave this place
[1:14:35] i want you to walk with an
[1:14:38] attitude of this message
[1:14:42] is an urgent message
[1:14:46] it's an urgent message for me
[1:14:50] and i must take notes
[1:14:55] of what god is telling me
[1:15:01] in the message um
[1:15:05] and i'm gonna sort of just glide over
[1:15:07] some quotes this morning
[1:15:10] if you will allow me the message of the
[1:15:13] second coming
[1:15:15] brother branham says he reads
[1:15:18] a scripture out of saint luke
[1:15:22] 15 1518 which talks about
[1:15:25] um the woman that had lost
[1:15:29] a coin piece of silver
[1:15:32] and she did a house cleaning and
[1:15:36] when she founded she called
[1:15:40] to others and said come and rejoice
[1:15:43] with me for i have found
[1:15:46] this lost coin but brother brandon picks
[1:15:49] up on that and he says
[1:15:51] in the message the second coming of the
[1:15:53] lord
[1:15:54] he says now that may seem like a very
[1:15:59] odd scripture for the coming of christ
[1:16:03] he says but it's speaking of the second
[1:16:05] coming of christ
[1:16:07] and this great subject
[1:16:11] that we have here before us now
[1:16:15] he says one of the most
[1:16:19] vital subjects
[1:16:22] in the entire holy
[1:16:25] writ he says there's nothing
[1:16:29] so important as the coming
[1:16:33] of the lord and the lord impressed this
[1:16:37] on my heart a couple of
[1:16:38] weeks ago i was actually um listening
[1:16:42] i've got a friend in south africa and
[1:16:44] i was just listening to one of his
[1:16:46] sermons and and as he was
[1:16:48] preaching it really hit
[1:16:51] home to me that this
[1:16:54] the coming of the lord is so
[1:16:58] important and i had to come and do a
[1:17:02] self-examination
[1:17:04] and i had to ask myself as
[1:17:07] in this walk that you are walking
[1:17:12] you are facing so many challenges
[1:17:16] there's so many things that's happening
[1:17:19] in your life and you are fighting the
[1:17:22] devil this way and you
[1:17:24] fighting the devil that way and you
[1:17:26] getting victory over this and you
[1:17:28] getting victory over that but says
[1:17:31] is your focus store the catching away
[1:17:36] is your focus stole on the coming
[1:17:40] of the lord it was a question
[1:17:45] that i had to ask myself because we find
[1:17:49] many times we get so we get so caught up
[1:17:53] with the things of life we get so
[1:17:57] caught up with the challenges that we
[1:18:00] face
[1:18:01] on a daily basis and we thank
[1:18:04] almighty god for what he's doing in our
[1:18:07] lives
[1:18:08] we see what he's doing we we see how
[1:18:11] he's lifting us
[1:18:12] up and we see how he's giving us victory
[1:18:16] over this devil and over that devil
[1:18:19] but is our main focus
[1:18:23] on the coming of the lord
[1:18:30] he says there's nothing so important
[1:18:34] as the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:38] for if he does not come we have been
[1:18:41] found
[1:18:42] false witnesses our dead that's in the
[1:18:45] grave are
[1:18:46] perished and there is no hope
[1:18:49] left for us if jesus doesn't
[1:18:52] come visibly the second time
[1:18:56] it must be a very
[1:18:59] important subject and i
[1:19:02] i read that and i said yes brother
[1:19:04] branham but i want to take that further
[1:19:06] and say lord
[1:19:07] it's not just a very important subject
[1:19:11] it's an event that i am excited about
[1:19:16] and i am contending for
[1:19:20] in things that ought to be but the
[1:19:21] brandon talks about the coming of the
[1:19:23] lord
[1:19:24] he says he says i look
[1:19:28] daily for him like to ask myself tess
[1:19:32] is that your attitude is that your
[1:19:35] approach
[1:19:37] i look daily for him
[1:19:40] keeping myself prepared
[1:19:46] for that hour you see we need
[1:19:49] to be prepared
[1:19:53] we need to be in
[1:19:56] a specific condition
[1:20:03] and brother brandon in god's provided
[1:20:04] day he says
[1:20:06] we should know how
[1:20:09] to tell the people to
[1:20:13] prepare for this great
[1:20:16] event that's coming
[1:20:19] he says if the coming of the lord
[1:20:23] is so great
[1:20:27] it's the most essential thing
[1:20:30] that we can do is to get
[1:20:34] the people prepared
[1:20:37] for it it is so
[1:20:40] important that we
[1:20:44] need to be prepared
[1:20:48] and i am grateful and i am thankful to
[1:20:52] almighty god
[1:20:53] that i know what is preparing
[1:20:58] me
[1:21:02] and i'll read it to you
[1:21:06] brother branham says now we're going to
[1:21:09] end right here by saying
[1:21:12] this the
[1:21:16] end time message
[1:21:20] is to get the bride
[1:21:24] ready and prepared
[1:21:28] for the rapture
[1:21:32] so young people brothers and sisters
[1:21:36] when we talk about
[1:21:40] being in the message
[1:21:44] it's not just a buzzword
[1:21:49] not just some another
[1:21:52] organized religion
[1:21:57] but this message
[1:22:01] has come my way and has come your way
[1:22:04] with a purpose
[1:22:10] and it's come to get us
[1:22:15] ready
[1:22:19] i see it in my life
[1:22:22] the more i submit myself
[1:22:27] to god i see it
[1:22:33] and then when i sing that song the
[1:22:35] things i used to do
[1:22:38] i do them no more it's because i
[1:22:42] see how he's taken me
[1:22:45] and he's maturing me maturing me
[1:22:50] and helping me to get rid of this and
[1:22:52] get rid of that and
[1:22:54] get rid of pride and get rid of
[1:22:56] arrogance and all those sorts of things
[1:22:59] he's getting me and you
[1:23:02] ready and in the right
[1:23:06] condition because we need
[1:23:09] to be in the right
[1:23:13] condition
[1:23:17] it's important
[1:23:25] brother brennan talks
[1:23:29] he gives a testimony
[1:23:34] um in the messenger testimony upon the
[1:23:36] sea
[1:23:38] he says i want to ask you
[1:23:41] do you believe see
[1:23:45] that picture over there that that pillar
[1:23:48] of fire that's on the picture
[1:23:50] you've seen it now he says now i've seen
[1:23:53] that
[1:23:55] since i was a little boy it's all down
[1:23:58] through the records the first time
[1:24:02] that was ever taken the canadian
[1:24:05] newspaper
[1:24:06] packed it 31 years ago across the whole
[1:24:10] province of canada
[1:24:12] it said a mystic light
[1:24:16] appears over a minister
[1:24:19] while baptizing in the river
[1:24:23] now the branham talks he says and as
[1:24:26] i was baptizing my 17th person
[1:24:32] he said i said heavenly father and i was
[1:24:35] a young baptist preacher and i said
[1:24:37] heavenly father i can only baptize him
[1:24:40] with water
[1:24:42] unto the fellowship of this church but i
[1:24:44] pray
[1:24:46] that you baptize him with the holy
[1:24:48] spirit
[1:24:50] and i said that and something
[1:24:53] said look up
[1:24:57] so brother branham is baptizing his 17th
[1:25:00] person
[1:25:02] and he's praying and he hears
[1:25:06] someone tell him look up
[1:25:11] he says i heard it a third time
[1:25:15] look up and i turned
[1:25:18] and looked and a great
[1:25:22] raw shook around over the crowd and here
[1:25:26] come that light mulling itself down
[1:25:30] and stood right over me where i was
[1:25:34] standing
[1:25:36] and the voice came from it and said
[1:25:41] as john the baptist was sent
[1:25:45] to forerun the first coming of christ
[1:25:50] your message will forerun
[1:25:54] the second coming of christ
[1:25:58] believers how we
[1:26:01] should appreciate
[1:26:05] this message i read things like this and
[1:26:09] i say
[1:26:10] lord thank you
[1:26:15] lord there are so many christians
[1:26:18] out there and i mix with them on a daily
[1:26:22] basis but father you've come my way
[1:26:28] you've sent a prophet a vindicated
[1:26:32] prophet regardless of what
[1:26:36] people say i told the church now the
[1:26:40] other day i
[1:26:41] am totally sold
[1:26:44] out to this message
[1:26:48] totally sold out amen
[1:26:54] and it's not because of some
[1:26:55] intellectual thing
[1:26:58] it's because this message is a life to
[1:27:01] me
[1:27:02] amen it's personal
[1:27:05] it's doing things and i am seeing it
[1:27:08] doing things in my life and if you're
[1:27:11] sitting here this morning

[1:27:25] don't give up
[1:27:31] seek the lord
[1:27:35] say lord i've been in this message for
[1:27:36] so long
[1:27:40] but i don't really see the things

[1:27:45] oh i'm critical
[1:27:48] say lord i need you and he will come

[1:27:58] i think he was told the church if it
[1:28:01] wasn't for the grace of god
[1:28:03] today i would be sitting
[1:28:07] in a nazarene church
[1:28:11] not knowing and experiencing
[1:28:15] this depth of the word
[1:28:19] that i am experiencing our being brother
[1:28:22] mathen my mom comes out of a nazarene
[1:28:26] church
[1:28:28] in my under the testimony of how the
[1:28:30] message came our way
[1:28:32] is that my my son of my family was
[1:28:35] religious
[1:28:36] some were not but i had an uncle
[1:28:40] that was searching for truth
[1:28:43] and brother harold beckett had put an ad
[1:28:46] in the paper in cape town
[1:28:49] with regards to spoken words
[1:28:52] and god allowed my uncle to pick up the
[1:28:55] paper
[1:28:57] and to read and to be attracted
[1:29:00] to this advertisement and he
[1:29:03] wrote in to this people
[1:29:07] and a couple of days later but i have a
[1:29:10] becket
[1:29:10] came to knock on his door and he
[1:29:14] received
[1:29:15] life and with the life that he received
[1:29:19] he could pass it on to his brother my
[1:29:21] other uncle
[1:29:23] and then from my other uncle it went to
[1:29:26] my mom
[1:29:27] and to the rest of the siblings and then
[1:29:29] it went to my dad
[1:29:31] infiltrated our home and yeah

[1:31:19] and he says he read this brother paul
[1:31:22] and he couldn't stop crying
[1:31:24] and he started seeing himself
[1:31:28] in what he was reading because he
[1:31:30] realized that he was an
[1:31:32] eagle and then god transformed his life

[1:31:48] the end of the meeting
[1:31:53] it says here a brother
[1:31:57] speaks in another tongue
[1:32:00] and another brother gives an
[1:32:02] interpretation
[1:32:07] so i'm going to read it and i hope it's
[1:32:09] okay
[1:32:10] it says so somebody in the meeting of
[1:32:14] brother branham

[1:32:22] meeting
[1:32:24] and somebody rises up
[1:32:28] and speaks in an unknown tongue
[1:32:32] and then another person rises up and
[1:32:35] gives an interpretation
[1:32:38] and they noted down the interpretation
[1:32:41] in this message souls that are in prison
[1:32:44] a brother speaks in another tongue
[1:32:47] another brother
[1:32:48] gives an interpretation my children
[1:32:51] today i say unto thee yea
[1:32:56] even i the almighty god
[1:33:00] has looked upon the earth today
[1:33:04] i have seen the evil that this creation
[1:33:08] has been brought to yea
[1:33:11] i see the sin that man this day
[1:33:15] is walling within yea
[1:33:19] dost thou not know that i
[1:33:23] have done a great thing for thee
[1:33:28] yea i have sent forth a man
[1:33:32] in this last day
[1:33:36] yea that he might be
[1:33:39] a mouthpiece unto this generation
[1:33:43] but i say unto thee this day my my
[1:33:46] people
[1:33:48] many have scoffed at this name yea
[1:33:52] they have turned their backs upon the
[1:33:54] things
[1:33:55] that he has spoke but i say unto thee
[1:33:59] those that shall hear these words
[1:34:03] i shall cause great blessings
[1:34:07] to fall upon them i am
[1:34:10] the almighty god i shall reward
[1:34:14] this day for those that
[1:34:18] shall sincerely receive
[1:34:21] these words and i say lord
[1:34:24] i shall surely receive
[1:34:29] the word of god with
[1:34:32] all of my heart
[1:34:38] you know i i find out many times
[1:34:44] we
[1:34:47] especially i i've come across message
[1:34:50] believers but
[1:34:54] a lot of times young people
[1:34:58] that's walking
[1:35:02] under the confines under the banner of
[1:35:05] the message
[1:35:08] but they walk at times like someone that
[1:35:12] is
[1:35:12] totally bound
[1:35:18] not realizing that there is greatness
[1:35:22] within them wanting to push out
[1:35:27] brother branham talks in this message he
[1:35:30] says i remember one time
[1:35:33] when i was at the zoo in cincinnati you
[1:35:36] know the quotes i'm reading a lot of you
[1:35:37] know about this already
[1:35:39] he says that i was looking at an eagle
[1:35:42] that had just been captured
[1:35:46] it was one of the most pitiful sights
[1:35:49] i have ever seen this
[1:35:52] great heavenly bird
[1:35:56] had been knitted and captured
[1:35:59] by someone and thrown
[1:36:02] into a cage that
[1:36:05] poor fellow was so out of place
[1:36:09] this eagle born to be
[1:36:13] free born to
[1:36:16] fly and to saw the heights of the world
[1:36:22] brother branham says that poor fellow
[1:36:25] was so out of place
[1:36:29] and many times i look at some believers
[1:36:32] and you can see that they feel so out of
[1:36:36] place
[1:36:37] when they're walking around with an
[1:36:39] attitude of despair
[1:36:41] because they know that there is
[1:36:44] something within
[1:36:45] and they are hey they should be able to
[1:36:47] break out
[1:36:49] brothers is that poor fellow was so out
[1:36:52] of place
[1:36:54] that he would jump with all his might
[1:36:57] against the big bars flapping his wings
[1:37:01] only to find himself back on his back
[1:37:05] as i continued watching him
[1:37:08] you'd walk proudly back and forth
[1:37:11] because he's an eagle and then with all
[1:37:15] his
[1:37:15] might throw himself against the bars
[1:37:19] only to fall back
[1:37:22] again the branham says he is a heavenly
[1:37:26] bird
[1:37:28] his whole makeup is to love
[1:37:31] in the blue not down
[1:37:34] yeah in the barnyard scratching
[1:37:38] with chickens he says
[1:37:42] then to see a bird like that
[1:37:45] that's made to soar in the blue
[1:37:49] just laying there brother branham says
[1:37:52] what a beautiful
[1:37:56] sight it is
[1:37:59] and then he takes it and he brings it
[1:38:01] down to you and me
[1:38:04] he says man was not
[1:38:08] made to be bound
[1:38:11] man is made to be free
[1:38:16] so i want to talk to the eagles
[1:38:19] that's here this morning
[1:38:23] you are not bound
[1:38:27] don't listen
[1:38:31] to the enemy trying to
[1:38:35] tell you that you are nothing
[1:38:38] that you not in the message that you
[1:38:41] can't really
[1:38:42] uphold the standards of this word
[1:38:45] the grace of god is available to you
[1:38:51] you are an ego and you
[1:38:54] can fly and you can saw
[1:38:57] the heights of this word
[1:39:02] you can walk as an overcomer
[1:39:07] when you're walking down the streets of
[1:39:08] stratford
[1:39:10] after today maybe yesterday
[1:39:14] or this morning you came to church
[1:39:17] and you walked the streets of stratford
[1:39:20] all depressed and all bound with this
[1:39:23] cage all around you
[1:39:27] after today you can walk out of here
[1:39:31] free because brother branham taught us
[1:39:35] he said house of hell
[1:39:38] give way to the name of jesus
[1:39:46] and each one of us we have
[1:39:50] access to the name
[1:39:53] of jesus it is a name
[1:39:57] that sets the captive free
[1:40:01] if you're struggling with your children
[1:40:03] or struggling with this or struggling
[1:40:05] with that
[1:40:06] just try it use the name
[1:40:10] of jesus christ
[1:40:13] i remember one time i was about to
[1:40:15] minister and i fell asleep
[1:40:18] uh just like the night before uh
[1:40:21] i was i was under the atmosphere and uh
[1:40:25] i went to sleep and uh i i
[1:40:28] felt demons coming to attack me in my
[1:40:32] sleep
[1:40:33] and it just it was just so eerie all
[1:40:36] around
[1:40:37] me in my dream
[1:40:41] and uh i remember standing there
[1:40:45] and i'm feeling this evil and this
[1:40:48] tearing all these things around me but i
[1:40:51] remember in my dream
[1:40:53] i screamed out i said get away
[1:40:57] in the name of jesus christ
[1:41:02] and then i i watched and it looked like
[1:41:05] nothing was happening but i stood firm
[1:41:09] and i believed and after a while
[1:41:13] that darkness and that gloom it just
[1:41:17] moved away because there is power
[1:41:21] in the name of
[1:41:24] jesus
[1:41:28] this message is urgent
[1:41:33] this message has been sent
[1:41:37] your way and this word of god
[1:41:42] it provides you and me with
[1:41:46] opportunities opportunities
[1:41:50] of growth opportunities
[1:41:54] for deliverance opportunities
[1:41:58] where you as a parent in your home
[1:42:02] can speak life over your son
[1:42:06] and over your daughter you can
[1:42:09] speak deliverance this message
[1:42:14] it provides opportunities
[1:42:18] and i want to read you just two
[1:42:20] quotations
[1:42:22] from the messaging i want to close off
[1:42:24] shortly from the message
[1:42:27] the presence of god
[1:42:30] unrecognized
[1:42:34] now brother branham says when
[1:42:39] he is not recognized
[1:42:42] his power is not always
[1:42:45] revealed
[1:42:49] when he is not recognized
[1:42:54] now i believe this morning but the
[1:42:57] brandon makes a statement he says the
[1:42:59] spirit
[1:43:00] follows the word
[1:43:04] i believe the word of god is being
[1:43:07] preached this morning
[1:43:09] and i believe with all my heart
[1:43:13] that right now we are in the presence
[1:43:18] of the great king of kings
[1:43:22] and lord of lords father branham
[1:43:26] says no matter how much
[1:43:29] god is standing present
[1:43:34] you've got to believe
[1:43:39] so as you're sitting here this morning
[1:43:42] and maybe
[1:43:43] you cannot really master the faith
[1:43:47] sit here this morning and say lord help
[1:43:50] me
[1:43:52] i want to be conscious of your presence
[1:43:57] lord i i don't want to walk out here and
[1:44:00] say
[1:44:00] that i am guilty of the presence of god
[1:44:04] unrecognized
[1:44:07] lord i want to know that you are here
[1:44:12] and it's not about feelings but you just
[1:44:14] know
[1:44:16] that he's here it's more than just
[1:44:19] an emotional thing right i've been
[1:44:22] through all of those things
[1:44:24] i've been through all of the emotional
[1:44:26] work-ups and you know you
[1:44:28] you come and you come and work up the
[1:44:30] people and they get all
[1:44:31] emotionally stirred but empty
[1:44:36] so don't get emotionally brother branham
[1:44:39] does say
[1:44:40] emotion gets you to the altar so i'm not
[1:44:42] pushing the motion aside
[1:44:44] but don't let that be the deciding
[1:44:47] factor
[1:44:49] you've got to know by faith
[1:44:52] that he's here and he's willing
[1:44:57] to meet with you
[1:45:00] you've got to believe it brother branham
[1:45:02] says like the woman
[1:45:04] with a blood issue he says
[1:45:07] all them people passing by
[1:45:11] and all of them standing up saying
[1:45:15] there goes the rabbi that's the guy
[1:45:18] that claims to be a prophet this
[1:45:22] is the fanatic and all such is that
[1:45:26] but brother branham says what happened
[1:45:29] this little woman had an issue of blood
[1:45:34] and she had heard
[1:45:37] about him and when she come down there
[1:45:41] regardless
[1:45:43] of what anybody said she
[1:45:47] recognized who he
[1:45:50] was recognize him
[1:45:54] this morning and she said
[1:45:58] if i can only touch
[1:46:02] his garment and when that
[1:46:05] genuine faith in god became a
[1:46:08] positive thing to her what did it
[1:46:12] release
[1:46:15] it released his power
[1:46:19] to heal her
[1:46:23] so she needed to touch him
[1:46:27] by faith so that
[1:46:30] his power of healing could be released
[1:46:34] to her it touched him in such a way
[1:46:37] he turned around and told her what was
[1:46:40] wrong with her
[1:46:41] others standing there might
[1:46:45] have been sicker than she
[1:46:48] but you see she recognized
[1:46:52] his presence and
[1:46:55] she knowed that this was
[1:46:58] her opportunity so she
[1:47:02] seen that there was an opportunity for
[1:47:05] her
[1:47:06] and she grabbed it with both hands
[1:47:11] before i go to the next quote i hope
[1:47:13] it's okay i want to just give a
[1:47:15] testimony about my wife
[1:47:17] in 2018 or just before that
[1:47:21] my wife was going she had some
[1:47:25] sickness some thing that was bothering
[1:47:28] her
[1:47:30] and she had gone to the doctors
[1:47:34] and then the doctors had told us he
[1:47:36] needed surgery for certain things
[1:47:39] and they had booked the surgery
[1:47:43] for january sometime in january
[1:47:47] in december i think it was december
[1:47:51] mid-december just before christmas
[1:47:54] we had some meetings
[1:47:57] and there was a prayer line
[1:48:02] and my wife normally would be working in
[1:48:05] the kitchen
[1:48:07] but this night the kitchen just
[1:48:11] closed because there was so there was so
[1:48:13] much food
[1:48:14] they didn't need to work in the kitchen
[1:48:16] that night
[1:48:17] so my wife could come and be in the
[1:48:19] meeting
[1:48:21] and the prayer line was called
[1:48:26] and the brothers we stood one side this
[1:48:29] side
[1:48:29] was like a line where people would walk
[1:48:31] through
[1:48:33] and my wife says she came
[1:48:37] into the prayer line
[1:48:40] and she says lord you know what i'm
[1:48:44] facing
[1:48:46] lord i'm here for my healing
[1:48:50] and she said she came through the prayer
[1:48:52] line
[1:48:54] and she felt a wholeness just
[1:48:57] flow through her was standing here at
[1:49:00] the end of the prayer line
[1:49:03] as she came through and she passed me
[1:49:06] she collapsed on the floor
[1:49:09] and then the sisters were helping her
[1:49:13] after the meetings we went home
[1:49:18] my wife believed we went home
[1:49:22] the condition was still there
[1:49:28] a couple of weeks just before the
[1:49:30] operation
[1:49:31] my wife just felt in the heart
[1:49:36] that the lord had told her
[1:49:39] that she needs to cancel the operation
[1:49:42] date
[1:49:45] and she went by faith
[1:49:49] and she cancelled the operation date
[1:49:53] and life went on
[1:49:57] she the date of the operation came she
[1:50:00] still had the condition
[1:50:03] life went on from january to february
[1:50:08] to march april still the condition
[1:50:12] may june
[1:50:15] july still the condition
[1:50:19] august september
[1:50:23] september my wife's life
[1:50:27] changed after a while she
[1:50:30] realized hey something's
[1:50:36] different
[1:50:38] and when she went to examine and realize
[1:50:41] the condition that had been plaguing her
[1:50:45] was gone
[1:50:49] that was 2019. we're in 2021
[1:50:55] and my wife sits here a testimony
[1:50:59] of what god is able
[1:51:02] to do now i'm not
[1:51:05] telling you that you must go and throw
[1:51:07] your medicine away or you must go cancel
[1:51:09] your appointments
[1:51:11] god spoke to her i didn't even tell her
[1:51:13] to do it
[1:51:14] all i did was i encouraged her and said
[1:51:16] lord laven
[1:51:17] you believe and you have faith but she
[1:51:21] had to do
[1:51:22] because she knew that god had told her
[1:51:25] what to do
[1:51:27] and she's sitting here this morning a
