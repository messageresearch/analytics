[30:30] scripture you can go to the next one
[30:32] brother Joe oh yeah I've got the the one
[30:35] the remote
[30:44] here amen a bit of a strange
[30:47] scripture but there's just so much that
[30:50] is in the scripture Lamentations 5
[30:54] 1-7 amen for us that don't even know we
[30:56] there where that is in the Bible don't
[30:58] worry we got it on the
[31:01] projection amen Lamentations we'll read
[31:03] from chapter 5
[31:14] 1-7 amen and this is just a cry out to
[31:17] the
[31:19] Lord remember oh
[31:22] Lord what is come upon
[31:25] us consider consider and behold our
[31:31] reproach our
[31:33] inheritance is turned to
[31:36] strangers so what was meant to be ours
[31:38] by default we've lost and has been
[31:42] turned away to
[31:43] others our houses to
[31:46] aliens no and this is not aliens in a
[31:49] UFO this is things that don't belong in
[31:53] your
[31:55] life they're not supposed to be be
[31:59] there we are orphans and
[32:03] fatherless our mothers are as
[32:08] widows you can be married and have a
[32:12] husband you can be a a daughter or a son
[32:15] and have a father and still be
[32:18] fatherless and be a widow because if
[32:21] that father is not there for you it
[32:25] doesn't help he can be in the household
[32:28] but if he's not a present father doing
[32:29] what a father should do it's still the
[32:32] same as not even having a father or not
[32:34] having a
[32:36] husband we have drunken our water for
[32:41] money our wood is sold to us so things
[32:44] that should have just been natural
[32:45] things that should have been a natural
[32:46] family structure suddenly we are paying
[32:49] for these things water should just be
[32:51] something that's free for us you know
[32:53] wood should be something easy together
[32:54] but now we have to pay for these things
[32:57] our necks are under
[33:00] persecution we labor and we have no
[33:05] rest we have given the hand now that
[33:08] hand is strength portion of land support
[33:12] for a labor that means when you used to
[33:14] have a wash bucket in the olden days
[33:17] where you'd clean there would be like a
[33:18] support structure so we've lost this
[33:20] support
[33:24] structure we've given it away what to
[33:26] the Egyptian to to things out there to
[33:29] the Assyrians to be satisfied with
[33:32] bread our fathers have
[33:35] sinned that is to miss the goal or path
[33:39] of right and Duty when you go into the
[33:42] original that
[33:44] sinned and are not that is to have not
[33:48] of your possession and we have borne
[33:51] their
[33:54] iniquities so because of the father's
[33:56] action because of what father hasn't
[33:59] been you
[34:01] suffer and this goes from the youngest
[34:04] right through to the oldest that is
[34:05] present in this building because of
[34:07] fathers that haven't come into their
[34:09] Poss of what they meant to be let's
[34:12] Close Our Eyes in a word of prayer dear
[34:14] gracious Heavenly
[34:15] Father Lord we realize these things Lord
[34:18] go beyond Lord what a human can handle
[34:21] Lord these things go beyond psychology
[34:23] as much as Lord It's good to talk about
[34:25] things Lord we know ultim that heeding
[34:27] lays with you and Lord God we ask that
[34:30] by your grace and mercy that you just
[34:31] come down in a mighty way and undertake
[34:33] for each and everyone Lord there's doors
[34:36] and hearts that are firmly
[34:38] shut that people are not prepared to go
[34:41] to but Lord I ask by your grace and your
[34:44] mercy that you'll loosen the bars over
[34:47] those doors in people's hearts this
[34:48] morning and allow you to come in and
[34:51] healed by your grace and mercy we ask
[34:54] these Mercies in your precious and
[34:55] wonderful name amen amen amen so you may
[34:58] be
[34:59] seated
[35:01] amen so we have a we have a far crisis
[35:05] in this
[35:07] world um you know the stats are
[35:10] staggering U most I don't know how it is
[35:12] a New Zealand but sou Africa generally
[35:14] the law always favors the mother as
[35:17] opposed to the father I think that's
[35:20] most of the world is similar to that
[35:21] you'll naturally find and and obviously
[35:24] generally the dads are to blame that's
[35:26] why it will happen
[35:27] but unfortunately you can get a
[35:28] situation where you will then because of
[35:30] father not coming to where he should be
[35:34] you can crucify father in the family
[35:38] structure and when you do that you break
[35:40] the sequence of how God wanted things to
[35:42] work so this is the biblical order of
[35:44] the family obviously having Christ as
[35:47] the ultimate head underneath that the
[35:50] husband which is the head of the home
[35:52] and he's there to protect the family
[35:54] lead the family provide for the family
[35:57] and then underneath that the wife who
[35:59] will be the comforter the teacher the
[36:01] nurturer but brandom talks about the
[36:03] mother being the Fifth Gospel amen and
[36:06] then of course the children under that
[36:08] they should be loving the parents and
[36:10] obeying the parents that is how God
[36:12] wanted things Amen to be but of
[36:16] course we see that that has not happened
[36:19] in this generation for many many
[36:20] households and yet again I'll say this
[36:22] just because you have a father in the
[36:24] house even in a message home if he's not
[36:27] doing what fathers are meant to do and
[36:29] in the place they meant to be you break
[36:32] the natural sequence of how things are
[36:34] meant to be so you see Christ I mean
[36:37] obviously Christ we all we all fall
[36:39] under Christ they children we fall under
[36:41] Christ so yes God is faithful he is the
[36:44] ultimate guide the ultimate protector
[36:46] our ultimate father but if you want to
[36:48] hurt the
[36:50] children what do you break next what is
[36:53] next in line well Satan knows that the
[36:55] next in line is the Father the husband
[36:58] and if I can hurt the husband if I can
[37:01] damage the husband and the father I will
[37:04] hurt all the rest under there because
[37:07] now we have a place where things are not
[37:10] as God ordered to be and like I say we
[37:13] have a father a father crisis in this
[37:16] world and I am talking to to to not only
[37:20] show you what it brings but I'm also
[37:21] here to say to the young men who will be
[37:24] fathers one day you need to stand up and
[37:29] realize you are called to a higher
[37:30] calling and that you're going to have to
[37:32] one day take your rightful position as a
[37:35] father and remember these things so as
[37:38] much as you may say oh this doesn't
[37:39] apply to me I'm not a father you one day
[37:41] will be and you need to make sure that
[37:43] you're in the place you're meant to be
[37:44] as a father and be the protector the
[37:47] guide the comforter the provider and all
[37:50] those things as what a a father should
[37:53] be so fathers young young men there's
[37:57] certain things you'll have to remember
[37:58] and those that are even listening online
[38:00] and the parents in the back this applies
[38:01] to us all now it's fascinating the Bible
[38:04] no matter what when it often always when
[38:07] it refers to generational problems it
[38:09] will always refer to your the fathers it
[38:12] just it's incredible you can go do it it
[38:14] almost never refers to the mothers it
[38:16] always is the fathers and it can maybe
[38:18] seem a bit unfair because we know
[38:20] there's also unfortunately women that
[38:21] don't do the best of things but the way
[38:23] the Lord has has created a woman if
[38:25] she's just in a right place place and is
[38:27] subjected to a man that is Led of the
[38:29] Lord you'll naturally see things will
[38:32] work out how they meant to be cuz God
[38:34] has given us a great solution he's given
[38:36] us the way it should be so often you'll
[38:38] see the the Bible hits hard on the
[38:40] fathers and you young men I hope you
[38:42] take note of this and ye fathers provoke
[38:45] not your children to
[38:47] wroth you know we have to be careful
[38:49] even I as a dad I have to be careful
[38:51] because it's S as it's just so nice to
[38:53] tease and and have fun at the kids and
[38:55] sometimes as you can push them a bit too
[38:57] far and you can get you can see they'll
[38:59] lash out and frustration so I have to be
[39:02] very careful as a father to have fun
[39:03] with the kids tease them you know have a
[39:05] lot of you know cool stuff we do
[39:07] together but there comes the point where
[39:08] you have to watch the reaction and every
[39:10] child is something different and many of
[39:13] you sitting
[39:14] here have multiple times been provoked
[39:18] by your father unto
[39:21] wroth and uh don't be too harsh on him
[39:24] heo we had came with all his Hang-Ups
[39:26] and his misunderstandings and his
[39:29] complexes but and maybe he was doing in
[39:31] the best of intentions but he didn't
[39:33] quite understand and what happens is
[39:36] when you provoke people to wroth you
[39:38] start hurting the heart you start
[39:42] damaging core structures of the
[39:44] heart and you start finding children
[39:48] becoming
[39:49] rebellious and the fathers can s be so
[39:52] harsh on you when you start being
[39:54] rebellious meanwhile the problem lays
[39:56] back
[39:57] at base camp which his
[39:59] father so we need to say that his is but
[40:02] at the same time I'm saying to you as
[40:04] youth as much as it's going to hurt and
[40:07] you're going to have to deal with things
[40:08] you can't let that overcome cuz my
[40:10] question to you is this what if your
[40:12] father never comes to the place he's
[40:15] meant to be cuz that can happen you'll
[40:18] have to resort back then to your
[40:19] heavenly father and there's some
[40:21] beautiful things you'll bring out now
[40:22] because God understood this and he came
[40:24] for a purpose to sort out the missing
[40:27] Gap so you would have come through some
[40:29] hard times and and and you know the the
[40:32] oldtimers of the message you know the
[40:34] fathers they really came with a very
[40:36] strong
[40:38] approach very legalistic you know not
[40:42] understanding that we we we grow in and
[40:43] we need time to grow that would just
[40:45] kill us and pretty much you know like we
[40:47] were saying last night you know the end
[40:49] of the day is I as a father must believe
[40:52] that my children are children of God
[40:54] they bride of of God and I need to
[40:55] respect them in that way that they're
[40:57] still little bride members and I must be
[41:00] careful to treat them right because
[41:02] ultimately if I don't I risk hurting
[41:05] them and I can't say things like to them
[41:08] you know if you're going to do that you
[41:09] know you better be careful cuz you're
[41:11] going to go to hell if that happens and
[41:13] and you know try and push fear on them
[41:15] because ultimately that is not the
[41:16] bride's language as we spoke last night
[41:18] because the true bride cannot be the yes
[41:20] there will come a time when I'm going to
[41:21] have to sit down with my child and say
[41:23] listen you have to give your heart to
[41:24] God it's very important so yes is a time
[41:27] of of like I said last night there's
[41:29] very very much a time of evangelism and
[41:31] I want to say this whenever you see your
[41:34] pastor which I believe we want to really
[41:36] trust that the Pastors in this message
[41:37] have moved on far enough to to know uh
[41:40] you know we need to speak Brad language
[41:42] but at times you might see your pastor
[41:44] will be a bit Evangelistic and even son
[41:46] is in the youth and the reason is he
[41:48] maybe knows there's a lost soul out
[41:50] there he has to go after but you need to
[41:52] then process that and not take it on
[41:53] board and say this is this is for me no
[41:56] it's it's just a case of me having to
[41:57] realize this is for someone else and I
[42:00] just have to let this go past and find
[42:03] that lost
[42:05] soul so what is a father meant to do
[42:08] yeah don't provoke your children to Roth
[42:09] but bring them up what in the nurture
[42:12] and the admonition of the
[42:15] Lord now notice nurtured admonition what
[42:19] of the Lord so the Lord is our example
[42:22] he is the one we need to resort to as
[42:25] our our model you know this is where we
[42:28] have to go as fathers and young men when
[42:30] you fathers you have to do this so when
[42:32] you treat your kids you have to be DED
[42:34] in the same ways how does God treat you
[42:37] as a Christian and so you as the father
[42:40] must try as best as possible to mirror
[42:43] that onto your
[42:45] kids because ultimately look how much
[42:47] God is so kind to you how many times is
[42:49] he forgiven you when you were nothing
[42:52] you deserve nothing but fire and
[42:54] condemnation but God comes in he
[42:56] forgives you many times thousands of
[43:00] times through my life God had to be kind
[43:02] enough you need to start showing that
[43:04] same thing but and you have to show the
[43:06] nature of Christ that you can ask
[43:08] forgiveness cuz some parents I've messed
[43:10] up my wife has messed up with our kids
[43:12] and we have to be big enough to go back
[43:14] to our kids and say we sorry we
[43:17] shouldn't have done that and that is the
[43:19] spirit of Christ unfortunately many of
[43:21] you have never heard your parents ever
[43:23] say sorry to you and it left a lot of
[43:27] scars it Le a lot of
[43:29] confusion but when they do say sorry you
[43:32] must also have Grace enough to say Lord
[43:34] I need to help help me to forgive them
[43:37] because they also as I said come with a
[43:40] lot of background stories and as I said
[43:41] the early days of the message it was
[43:44] very muddy and very messy and there was
[43:46] just pulls going in all Direction and
[43:48] they had such limited material by God's
[43:50] grace we have access to so much but just
[43:53] remember you have to be kind and forgiv
[43:56] giving as best you can and yes the
[43:57] Lord's going to have to help you through
[43:58] some
[43:59] things children obey your parents in the
[44:02] Lord for this is well pleasing unto the
[44:04] Lord so yes that's we heard I'm sure you
[44:06] heard that all the times you know you
[44:08] should obey the parents but it's a
[44:10] twofold because fathers also mustn't
[44:12] provoke not your children to anger what
[44:15] lest they be
[44:17] discouraged so it's a twofold that's
[44:19] happening here and obviously you guys as
[44:21] the youth I'm sure you've you've you've
[44:23] felt the second part so much and like I
[44:26] said the the it's a twofold yes respect
[44:29] your parents and that is really your
[44:30] duty irrespective of what they do always
[44:32] show them respect as best you can don't
[44:35] become rebellious try and be
[44:37] understanding but ultimately just
[44:39] remember that you young men in the
[44:42] future must make sure you do your best
[44:44] not to provoke them because then they
[44:46] become discouraged and they can go
[44:48] through some very confusing
[44:50] times so yeah there's some interesting
[44:52] stats out there and this is this is not
[44:54] this is not message this is purely
[44:56] done out there and some of the stuff's
[44:57] even out of date some of it is is more
[44:59] than it it it it it it used to be some
[45:02] of these things as I said from years ago
[45:04] but just to go through some of this I
[45:05] know it's small but uh children who grow
[45:08] up with an involved father are 90 uh 39%
[45:11] more likely to earn mostly A's in school
[45:15] 45% less likely to repeat a grade 60%
[45:20] less likely to be suspended or expelled
[45:22] from school two times as likely to go to
[45:26] college or find stable employment After
[45:28] High School 75% less likely to have a
[45:32] teen
[45:33] birth 80% less likely to spend time in
[45:38] jail and then uh it goes here in the
[45:40] bottom children who grow up with absent
[45:42] fathers are at greater risk of infant
[45:45] mortality literally they actually the
[45:48] the when a child is born in birth those
[45:51] that have no father present there and
[45:53] then that child has succumbed to
[45:55] diseases Etc and it's just so
[45:57] fascinating what would that child know
[45:59] you would think but there's a a knowing
[46:02] more likely to have behavioral problems
[46:04] more likely to to abuse drugs and
[46:07] alcohol more likely to drop out of
[46:08] school more likely to become pregnant as
[46:11] a teenager more likely to commit a crime
[46:15] and go to
[46:16] prison so this is a some big stats
[46:20] here I mean the the that one of the the
[46:22] gel I mean it's we we'll go into that
[46:24] just now but that L one is fascinating
[46:27] when you go and see what actually
[46:28] happens behind there this is African
[46:31] stat so excuse me but we have a problem
[46:32] back there I don't know what is like in
[46:34] New Zealand but about 1/5 21% of all
[46:36] children sa did not live with their
[46:39] parents but never mind that as I said
[46:42] there's more to this so we in sou Africa
[46:44] only have 4% with these divorce cases
[46:47] that actually land up with the father
[46:48] 96% doesn't
[46:50] happen 42% live with parents others live
[46:54] L up with the the parents
[46:56] parents and uh we got a stat here of
[46:59] about 32 so think of it only
[47:01] oneir is technically Healthy Families
[47:05] but as we know like I said many of those
[47:06] one-third families have fathers that are
[47:08] not
[47:09] fathers they there but they're not there
[47:12] they're there but not present dads are
[47:15] important fathers make important
[47:17] contributions to their child's
[47:18] well-being children growing up without
[47:20] fathers face greater risk and account
[47:21] for 90% of homeless and runaway youth
[47:25] they interview with them they find out
[47:27] the backstory 90% of them was because
[47:29] they didn't have a present father or the
[47:31] father wasn't
[47:32] there of House High School Dropout 71%
[47:36] 63% of Youth suicides come because there
[47:39] wasn't a
[47:44] father so what happens let me go back
[47:48] here so let me refer to the sisters here
[47:51] a bit so what happens when you don't
[47:53] have the love and and the the the the
[47:57] necessary respect and attention from
[48:00] your dad what happens within you you're
[48:03] naturally born to to want affirmation
[48:07] from dad to have the support to tell for
[48:10] him to tell you you're beautiful and
[48:12] you're smart and and he loves you so
[48:13] much that is normal that is what has
[48:15] been inbuilt into you from God but what
[48:18] go what has happened now because dads
[48:20] through their unfortunately own
[48:21] complexes and insecurities they come to
[48:24] a place where they don't know how to
[48:25] give that now Satan comes in that
[48:30] door he now knows your hurt you're
[48:33] lacking something and he wants to
[48:36] replace it and this is where it gets so
[48:39] hard it becomes so dangerous because
[48:42] there's multiple ways for you to express
[48:44] it because the reality is you're going
[48:46] to try and find attention
[48:48] elsewhere cuz you want it so if Daddy
[48:52] doesn't give it to you you're going to
[48:54] try and dress in a way to get
[48:57] attention or you're going to go on
[48:59] social media and other places to try and
[49:01] get
[49:02] attention or the other way people deal
[49:05] with great hurts in their hearts is they
[49:07] say well listen this person has hurt me
[49:10] my father has hurt me so the only way
[49:12] for me to feel better about myself is to
[49:15] try and make myself higher and bigger
[49:19] than this hurt because then I have
[49:21] control and that's unfortunately where
[49:23] we get p uh situations
[49:26] where you know female dominating spirits
[49:28] come out and say well we are bigger
[49:31] better than the
[49:32] men and it doesn't mean you're not as I
[49:35] say from an intelligence point of view
[49:37] but that spirit will unfortunately drive
[49:39] you to try and make yourself bigger and
[49:41] better than your dad or men around you
[49:44] and that's where unfortunately we get
[49:46] these spirits of lesbian and
[49:47] homosexuality coming in and wanting to
[49:49] be Butch and tough and they just career
[49:52] driven they just want to get to the very
[49:54] top why they'll Fe eating something that
[49:56] was lacking all along and the only way
[49:58] they can feel better about themselves is
[50:00] to make themselves better than the thing
[50:02] that hurt them I hope I'm making
[50:06] sense so you're going to run two ways
[50:08] you're either going to look for
[50:09] attention from the boys or you're going
[50:11] to try and make yourself better than the
[50:13] thing that hurt
[50:14] you and it's such a dangerous territory
[50:18] because God didn't make you to be like
[50:20] that he didn't want you to be like that
[50:22] so obviously family is on the attack as
[50:24] we know if the way the laws are coming
[50:26] out family is being attacked at the
[50:29] moment the the the the sanctity of the
[50:31] family is just under this wall like
[50:33] we've never seen before so what is it
[50:35] happening remember the olden days family
[50:37] was was normal the divorces were so low
[50:40] the divorce rate now is ridiculously
[50:42] high broken families and uh what do we
[50:45] have now watch as things are changing
[50:49] now because more than ever before we
[50:52] finding that there's a a a sexual
[50:56] activities taking place way before God
[50:59] was meant to let it take place cuz God
[51:02] is meant for you to keep your body until
[51:04] that time you've said I do at the altar
[51:07] that is what God's plan is for you and
[51:08] it's beautiful those things are
[51:09] beautiful in its place under the banner
[51:12] of what God gave you but what we have
[51:14] now is this this
[51:16] drive and do you notice the women are
[51:20] above the trend line than men why it's
[51:23] women trying to find except
[51:25] love from something else and technically
[51:28] the man being a red hot blooded man
[51:31] should have a higher stat because that's
[51:33] sometimes more ticking in his brain yes
[51:35] the the spirits will be more and more
[51:37] mingled and there's more going on but
[51:39] realistically but why is the woman so
[51:41] driven it's because there's something
[51:44] she's trying to get and unfortunately
[51:45] what
[51:46] happens is
[51:48] this we find the amount of sexual
[51:52] partners before marriage is just
[51:53] becoming bigger and bigger so this is
[51:56] only go until the two 2000 what the
[51:59] 2010s we're now 2024 I can tell you now
[52:02] these graphs have have have changed even
[52:05] worse than what we
[52:07] see so to have one partner not even zero
[52:11] Partners it used to be back in
[52:13] 1970s that about what is that about 45%
[52:16] of of women would have only had one
[52:19] partner before married we're not even
[52:21] talking about no
[52:22] Partners we'll go down to the other side
[52:24] just now
[52:26] uh and then you can see how it increases
[52:28] four to five
[52:29] Partners 6 to9 Partners two to above 10
[52:35] Partners this is 2010s guys 2010s we're
[52:39] talking about roughly what 20% of the
[52:42] population has had over 10 Partners
[52:45] before they've even said I do at the
[52:47] altar well these days they don't even
[52:49] say I do they just live
[52:51] together now it's fascinating this is
[52:53] clinically proven so you don't have to
[52:54] this is not Mage but do you know when
[52:56] you sleep with someone let me shock you
[52:59] a bit and hopefully it'll shock you to
[53:01] really keep yourself in place and for
[53:03] those that have gone that way God has
[53:04] got Grace for you but you're going to
[53:06] have to then walk a walk they've proven
[53:08] you know your DNA it's it's you know
[53:09] obviously we we quite familiar with the
[53:11] DNA principle everyone has their own
[53:13] unique DNA do you know when you when
[53:15] you're with someone they actually that's
[53:18] when the Bible says you become one you
[53:20] don't understand how far that goes
[53:22] because when you actually become one
[53:25] that person you're with they actually
[53:27] jump into your DNA literally and you
[53:29] carry them for the rest of your life
[53:31] literally they will find a trace of that
[53:33] person you're within your DNA never mind
[53:36] just exchange of fluids or whatever you
[53:38] you guys are adults you know what I'm
[53:39] talking about but never mind that just
[53:41] you'll carry that person's DNA for the
[53:43] rest of your life and you'll be
[53:45] struggling with things and having things
[53:46] in your life and you wonder how on Earth
[53:48] did this happen well you've
[53:50] unfortunately allowed so when the Bible
[53:52] says they become one flesh you literally
[53:54] join joining yourself you you you got a
[53:56] connection and all those terrible
[53:58] spirits and stuff that are on that
[53:59] person will get transferred to you and
[54:01] literally your your DNA structure
[54:03] changes this is scientific I don't it's
[54:06] just you can go research it yourself
[54:07] it's it's it's the it's just black and
[54:09] white but you can see as things are
[54:11] changing how things are going and look
[54:13] at virgins before marriage at 2010 we're
[54:16] sitting at only
[54:17] 5% that's the black line uh the middle
[54:19] black line what is that green actually
[54:22] that goes down that's 2010 are we down
[54:24] to maybe half a percent in
[54:28] 2024 and remember this is the world you
[54:31] know some cultures especially some of
[54:32] the African cultures they don't dare be
[54:35] with a partner so I think in the more
[54:37] First World countries that stat is I
[54:39] think ridiculously high but thank God
[54:41] for the message that we can still have
[54:44] virgins come to the Altar and say I do
[54:46] amen but like I said if you've not if
[54:48] you're not in that caty don't lose hope
[54:50] God's got amen a solution for you so
[54:54] look what the bra brother Bram talks
[54:56] about here about remember we've seen him
[54:57] telling you about the sisters that are
[54:59] looking for
[55:00] exceptions now look what he says here or
[55:02] the woman that smokes or that dresses
[55:04] immorally what ises she he says yeah
[55:06] trying to draw her Comfort a comfort
[55:10] she's trying to get a comfort she's
[55:12] trying to satisfy something that dads
[55:14] were meant to be but unfortunately dads
[55:16] haven't
[55:17] done from being so well put together
[55:20] that she wants to cause a man to look at
[55:24] her
[55:26] there's no other
[55:29] reason she and I know this sounds
[55:31] horrible when she says she is partially
[55:33] insane and and obviously that's
[55:35] referring to not necessarily that you
[55:37] you know you but you've been hurt your
[55:39] mind and your heart is Damaged
[55:42] unfortunately and now there's a a way
[55:44] you're not thinking clearly anymore and
[55:46] you're going to the wrong source for
[55:49] satisfaction no sensible woman would
[55:52] know to strip herself before a man that
[55:54] was in her her right mind but of course
[55:56] there's hurt now and she's not see
[55:59] there's no reason for it at all and
[56:01] these women have no other reason but
[56:03] just they don't know it they don't
[56:06] realize it I'm not saying that they do
[56:09] in other words he's not saying they
[56:10] purposely bad people but they don't
[56:13] understand what has happened the damage
[56:15] and why they are looking for these other
[56:16] things because it's normal you are meant
[56:20] to get affirmation and beautiful words
[56:22] set upon you and to build you up that's
[56:24] what were made for many of them fine
[56:27] women and I'm not saying it to be rude
[56:30] I'm saying it to try wake them up and
[56:33] that's what we're trying to say this
[56:35] morning understand who you are accept it
[56:37] don't fight it and if you're not got it
[56:39] you're going to have to allow God to
[56:41] deal with the hurt heart and that daddy
[56:43] wasn't
[56:46] there now this is so beautiful when
[56:49] Christ came on Earth amen he came for a
[56:53] purpose amen and thank God for that but
[56:56] Psalms Are So Beautiful cuz it says here
[56:58] that my God will be a father to the
[57:02] fatherless and a judge of the widows is
[57:06] God in his holy habitation amen so
[57:09] that's the solution with this sisters
[57:12] brothers cuz Brothers also you need a
[57:13] father son us to guide you and be able
[57:15] to raise you well and you haven't had
[57:17] that and you're going to have to make
[57:19] God your father in some of these cases
[57:20] cuz like I said sometimes you're not
[57:22] going to get Daddy coming right but God
[57:24] can't let you live in that condition and
[57:26] keep it as a crutch you have to get over
[57:29] it and allow him to replace the channel
[57:31] That was missing the Lord is nigh unto
[57:35] them that are brokenhearted and Savor
[57:38] such as be of a contrite spirit many are
[57:42] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[57:43] Lord will deliver him and her out of
[57:47] them
[57:48] all now this is the the scripture that
[57:52] Christ quoted when he was on on Earth
[57:54] cuz
[57:55] Christ came for a purpose and when he
[57:58] was in the temple and he was he was
[57:59] speaking to the he opened the book and
[58:01] started to read the scroll this is what
[58:02] he said the spirit of the Lord has come
[58:05] upon me because the Lord hath anointed
[58:07] me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek
[58:10] he hath sent me this is part of the big
[58:13] purpose of God coming yes to preach the
[58:15] gospel Good Tidings to the meek but what
[58:17] else he has sent me to bind up that's
[58:20] like a Band-Aid a plaster the
[58:22] Brokenhearted so God Has Come with a
[58:25] purpose and he wants to help us that was
[58:27] part of his coming that's why he died on
[58:29] the cross for you so that you can have a
[58:31] way out what to Proclaim Liberty to the
[58:34] captives remember the opening scripture
[58:36] because father's haven't been there it
[58:39] bound Us in certain things it hurts us
[58:41] in certain things but God by his grace
[58:43] has come to Proclaim Liberty to those
[58:45] that are in captive to break every
[58:50] chain and the opening of the prison to
[58:53] them that are
[58:55] bound many of you are bound in your
[58:59] hearts and in your spirits and the devil
[59:02] just been working on that all along and
[59:04] you're wondering why do I feel like this
[59:06] why do I feel the need why do I feel the
[59:08] need to try and show off why do I feel
[59:10] the need for
[59:11] acceptance maybe you need to go back a
[59:14] step and say what has hurt me that I
[59:16] need
[59:20] this so now this is part of the problem
[59:22] because now you must remember
[59:25] Satan understands hurt he understands
[59:28] how to get to you now fathers is one of
[59:30] the biggest ways Satan will get to hurt
[59:33] you he's one of the biggest things he's
[59:35] going to use like I like I showed the
[59:37] the family structure but maybe like me I
[59:40] was raised in an amazing Christian
[59:42] family and I had very balanced parents
[59:44] and my parents didn't leave scars with
[59:45] me so how did Satan get to me well guess
[59:49] what remember I told you yesterday about
[59:50] the friends and how I felt alone that
[59:54] objection he used to get to me so he's
[59:58] going to find it might be a friends it
[59:59] might be a you know School situation it
[1:00:01] might be a teacher that that really says
[1:00:03] terrible things to you someone you
[1:00:05] really trusted you looked up to that has
[1:00:07] said horrible things to you and it
[1:00:08] created a great hurt and now with that
[1:00:11] hurt is a damaged heart a damaged mind
[1:00:14] and now Satan has an Avenue so he knows
[1:00:17] that if he can get you to to somehow uh
[1:00:20] find a crutch find a way to satisfy that
[1:00:24] hurt
[1:00:25] he'll keep getting you to run to the
[1:00:27] same thing because we all very I mean we
[1:00:30] sit in Youth Camp we all feeling an
[1:00:31] amazing Victorious but come Tuesday when
[1:00:34] you leave you it gets real again right
[1:00:38] and yeah maybe the emotions will ride
[1:00:39] you high for a week or two but it's
[1:00:42] you're going to hit like they say when
[1:00:44] the the tire what the rubber is going to
[1:00:46] hit the road eventually you're going to
[1:00:47] feel it things are going to come
[1:00:49] pressure is going to come and more than
[1:00:50] ever before I think even in a beautiful
[1:00:52] peaceful place like New Zealand I
[1:00:54] believe believe you can feel the
[1:00:55] pressures are rising in the world you
[1:00:57] look at the Middle East you look at the
[1:00:58] Ukraine war you look at the stocks the
[1:01:01] the the the inflation the interest rates
[1:01:03] you know you know it's coming you can
[1:01:04] feel like like brother B says it's like
[1:01:07] trying to ignore whistling in a
[1:01:08] graveyard but you know you're not
[1:01:10] comfortable something's up cuz if we
[1:01:12] honest about it you would know it so my
[1:01:14] question is this when you feel the
[1:01:18] pressure what do you run
[1:01:23] to the of the day is I don't care if
[1:01:26] it's an elderly brother of 80 years old
[1:01:29] or
[1:01:31] sister they don't understand Som your
[1:01:33] struggles your struggles is maybe like
[1:01:35] we' talked about pornography and social
[1:01:36] media and all these other things we'll
[1:01:37] maybe tackle just now but at the end of
[1:01:39] the day is no matter what you run to
[1:01:41] when the pressure gets high besides God
[1:01:44] it's
[1:01:45] wrong he is the one that's meant to help
[1:01:48] you with your heart that's hurt and your
[1:01:50] your mind and all these things that are
[1:01:51] damaged him but even the elderly run to
[1:01:54] other things you say what well they run
[1:01:55] to calming pools and you know reading a
[1:01:58] book or whatever they don't go to God
[1:02:00] cuz they're trying to shut down the hurt
[1:02:02] and whatever is their outlet they use
[1:02:05] but they don't go to God for the hurt
[1:02:07] they go to something else now the
[1:02:09] manifestations have become shall we say
[1:02:11] more Vivid more more in your face
[1:02:13] because there's some like studies of
[1:02:15] these things that have come out we'll
[1:02:16] we'll show some of this but at the end
[1:02:18] of the days my question is where do you
[1:02:19] run to when the pressure gets high
[1:02:22] because this is where Satan gets you
[1:02:24] he's going to create a situation family
[1:02:26] pressures work pressures you know
[1:02:29] political pressures there will be
[1:02:30] pressures that will come upon you and
[1:02:31] you're going to feel it and he knows
[1:02:34] that if he can somehow damage the
[1:02:36] connection between you and God you're
[1:02:37] going to run to something else besides
[1:02:41] God I believe we've all heard of
[1:02:44] dopamine
[1:02:46] Rush okay so dopamine is not a bad thing
[1:02:49] it's a it's a hormone that God gave to
[1:02:52] you and there's nothing wrong with it
[1:02:54] there's many hormones in our body um I'm
[1:02:56] sure our uh sister Becky at the back
[1:02:58] being a nurse knows this stuff well but
[1:03:01] ultimately you know there's different
[1:03:03] things in our bodies and God has made us
[1:03:05] and it's nothing wrong you you got
[1:03:06] emotions you got these different um uh
[1:03:10] uh what's the word I'm looking for but
[1:03:11] these there's different uh H hormones
[1:03:15] thank you yeah great so there's
[1:03:16] different hormones and and and obviously
[1:03:18] the one that Satan and there's many ways
[1:03:20] he'll get into but the one big thing he
[1:03:22] will use is a called dopamine and why
[1:03:25] because he's figured out something and
[1:03:27] science has also figured this out and
[1:03:29] this is why like things like drugs is so
[1:03:31] powerful so how you break don't me is
[1:03:34] not a bad thing you know if you go for a
[1:03:35] walk and you enjoy a nice meal and
[1:03:36] whatever you release happy hormones
[1:03:38] you're feeling good you know you feel
[1:03:40] you feel feel nice and it has a nice
[1:03:42] feeling and it's nice God made you to do
[1:03:44] that be like that but now what Satan has
[1:03:46] come and
[1:03:47] done is he's got you to have a quick
[1:03:51] fix with things that are not right so
[1:03:54] what happened you meant to just have a
[1:03:56] normal dopamine cycle now you can see
[1:03:58] dopamine is happy and it's all these
[1:04:00] technical things Ventra Teck Tech mental
[1:04:03] area nucleus you know whatever it just
[1:04:05] goes along but just to simplify it you
[1:04:08] know there's a normal way you're
[1:04:09] supposed to go but what Satan comes and
[1:04:11] do remember your brain is lazy your
[1:04:13] brain always will take the shortest path
[1:04:16] so if you're under stress your brain
[1:04:18] knows you need to feel good so whichever
[1:04:21] way it knows you're going to get feel
[1:04:23] happy soonest it's going it's going to
[1:04:25] make like a a connection a joint so what
[1:04:28] Satan has tried to trick everyone I
[1:04:30] believe everyone sitting here has fault
[1:04:32] this in some way he's created a scen
[1:04:34] scenario where you got tricked or like
[1:04:36] me got hurt and you went and ran to
[1:04:39] something else for Dr rush and he's now
[1:04:43] damaged your brain literally it's brain
[1:04:46] damage physical you can see it under
[1:04:48] sonar they can show you you got brain
[1:04:51] damage so let me show try and explain it
[1:04:54] to you think of a river up top a
[1:04:56] mountain and it's flowing down your
[1:04:58] brain is meant to just flow down through
[1:04:59] the natural crevices that God created
[1:05:01] and there's also the dopamine windes and
[1:05:03] everything's fine what Satan comes and
[1:05:05] does is through the dopamine Rush he
[1:05:08] cuts a massive
[1:05:10] Gorge down a a side of the mountain in
[1:05:13] your mind it just goes and it literally
[1:05:16] becomes brain damage so what your brain
[1:05:18] does instead of following the natural
[1:05:20] path that God had made you now have a
[1:05:22] shortcut to feel good
[1:05:24] so when the pressure
[1:05:26] Rises you immediately want to run to
[1:05:29] that
[1:05:29] pornography because your brain knows
[1:05:32] that's my fastest quickest way to feel
[1:05:34] good and you have this massive Rush
[1:05:36] sensation and you feel good for that
[1:05:38] moment but as you know our dear friend
[1:05:41] the devil not first causes you to get
[1:05:44] into the problem and then he comes this
[1:05:46] side and says oh if you a Son of God you
[1:05:48] would have never done that so he's just
[1:05:52] the the Vicious Cycle and you guys know
[1:05:54] yourself how these things work yes it
[1:05:57] feels great for the moment and whatever
[1:05:58] else but as the the hours pass and the
[1:06:01] days pass you feel as terrible as a dog
[1:06:03] and you think yourself man how could I
[1:06:05] even have love with that but you have a
[1:06:07] damaged brain that the devil got a
[1:06:09] chance and has created in your head you
[1:06:12] literally have a damaged brain and God
[1:06:15] has to help us and we're going to show
[1:06:17] you by God's grace but we first have to
[1:06:19] go through some things but I first need
[1:06:20] to understand how dopamine rushes work
[1:06:23] and like I said it manifests in many
[1:06:24] many different
[1:06:26] ways so just some quick stats on
[1:06:28] pornography and stuff like
[1:06:30] that you know 90% of kids aged 8 to 16
[1:06:34] have viewed it you know it's it's
[1:06:37] there's so many stats you know um it's a
[1:06:40] huge industry it's unbelievably big and
[1:06:43] and yeah it says one and six of women do
[1:06:45] you know that has increased drastically
[1:06:47] it's almost now two to
[1:06:49] three3 uh yeah two yeah roughly 2/3 of
[1:06:53] women now also have and have had their
[1:06:56] struggles so don't think it's it's
[1:06:58] exempt from the message it can get into
[1:07:00] us all and we need God's
[1:07:02] help this is very small but I'm just
[1:07:04] going to try and uh read but the average
[1:07:06] age that kids now view pornography is 11
[1:07:09] years
[1:07:11] old um it's the number one uh sex is the
[1:07:15] number one searched thing in the world
[1:07:17] that's number one search
[1:07:22] subject um two 2.5 billion emails per
[1:07:25] day of
[1:07:27] pornography that's 8% of all
[1:07:30] emails two out of three of college
[1:07:33] students have had friends with benefits
[1:07:37] relationships um this is America Alone
[1:07:40] by the way 94% of Americas actually it's
[1:07:42] funny enough cuz they know people you
[1:07:44] know what see what we've have now is and
[1:07:46] when you go and research about these
[1:07:47] things there's been a massive drive by
[1:07:49] Satan to try to say it's okay there
[1:07:51] really is he's trying to say no it's
[1:07:53] healthy and you know you should you can
[1:07:54] even bring it in your relationship and
[1:07:55] all this nonsense there's a big drive
[1:07:57] and they they you know just when you go
[1:07:59] and research these things you need to
[1:08:00] filter through God's word because
[1:08:01] ultimately the devil's going to try and
[1:08:03] tell you it's fun it's not fun because
[1:08:05] if you're just honest with yourself
[1:08:06] you'll see your reaction and I mean
[1:08:08] there's so many bad side effects we
[1:08:10] won't go into all of that but it's been
[1:08:11] proven clinically we don't need to fight
[1:08:13] the the Devils that that have been
[1:08:15] raised up to try and make this
[1:08:16] acceptable but anyways um there's some
[1:08:19] more stuff here but I think you guys are
[1:08:21] well versed you can go uh you know go
[1:08:23] this s but I'm I'm not going to go too
[1:08:26] much so yeah we we we so often we'll
[1:08:28] talk about pornography and stuff but
[1:08:29] there's another thing that's on the rise
[1:08:31] like never
[1:08:32] before
[1:08:35] gaming now I know I'm going to hit some
[1:08:38] hard points here but just hear me out
[1:08:40] okay hear me out okay because it's now
[1:08:42] yet again it's been clinically proven
[1:08:45] that gaming is a serious problem and
[1:08:48] it's starting to influence in a massive
[1:08:50] way I mean it's crazy to see the growth
[1:08:53] of game G in I mean we now sitting where
[1:08:56] we are now 2024 I mean the the market
[1:09:00] the market uh uh hold what the the
[1:09:03] amount the the the what's the word I'm
[1:09:05] looking for you know just the size of
[1:09:06] the market and this is in in US billions
[1:09:10] currently 2024 was predicted to go to
[1:09:14] $278
[1:09:16] billion it is a huge market and it's
[1:09:20] getting so uh amongst the public because
[1:09:25] it's the ultimate way to escape I mean
[1:09:28] think about it I could be this huge
[1:09:31] overweight guy you know like you know a
[1:09:34] society weirdo you know and just muddle
[1:09:37] along but I can get into a gaming chair
[1:09:40] log in and suddenly I become
[1:09:43] Superman literally and I can live for
[1:09:46] hours in this world where I go and
[1:09:49] Conquer levels and I become this God of
[1:09:52] the universe of wherever I'm based and I
[1:09:56] can feel so good and then obviously when
[1:09:58] reality strikes ah not so bad but I can
[1:10:01] get back into the gaming I'm the hero
[1:10:03] and you know I can go and this this
[1:10:04] thing has so captured you know there's
[1:10:07] certain uh uh places I think it's
[1:10:09] Austria that have now got rehab centers
[1:10:11] for gaming literally it's rehab centers
[1:10:13] never mind for drugs gaming rehab
[1:10:17] centers and it's just becoming so big
[1:10:19] and and I mean I've went I I I kind of
[1:10:22] half regret it but you know as a
[1:10:24] minister you must go to Dark Places to
[1:10:26] understand what's happening so I went
[1:10:27] and checked last year what is the number
[1:10:29] one 2023 game and I can't remember what
[1:10:31] it was now but man the stuff that's in
[1:10:33] there is demonic of the next level you
[1:10:36] know when B Bram says that you know
[1:10:38] these cartoons and stuff is going it's
[1:10:39] going to like soften the mind for the
[1:10:41] great Onslaught that the devil's going
[1:10:42] to bring you have to understand it's not
[1:10:44] just about that but when you start
[1:10:46] doving in these demonic dragons and
[1:10:47] these stuff and these these zombies and
[1:10:50] whatever else it's softening your mind
[1:10:52] to the devils and it's going to lower
[1:10:54] your your your
[1:10:57] guard so Game Addict facts 60.8% of
[1:11:01] respondents said they considered
[1:11:02] themselves

[1:11:31] is going to happen and it cap it pulls
[1:11:33] you in I know it you can't you can't

[1:11:57] of 100 out of 128 respondents said they
[1:12:00] put off their tasks to play video games
[1:12:03] mommy says please take out the the
[1:12:05] rubbish and whatever else and Junior
[1:12:07] stuck in the
[1:12:08] room 76 out of the 128 respondents said
[1:12:11] they play games to escape from real life
[1:12:15] problems anxiety or
[1:12:17] depression and the reality is it makes
[1:12:20] it worse you think you escape when you
[1:12:23] come out is worse than where it
[1:12:26] was 35 out of 128 respondents said they
[1:12:29] considered gaming as a future job

[1:12:33] all these gaming tournaments and
[1:12:34] whatever else you can log on and it's
[1:12:36] become a huge
[1:12:38] thing so maybe gaming is something you

[1:12:57] here to say don't play games I'm saying
[1:12:59] you be honest with yourself and if you

[1:13:37] get some fresh
[1:13:39] air now this is something you guys it's
[1:13:41] just yet again social media it's it's
[1:13:44] something that's part of our Lives I
[1:13:45] mean many of us it's just what we we we
[1:13:47] on stuff and but if you can't control it
[1:13:49] yet again be honest with yourself what
[1:13:51] are you trying to get out of it what
[1:13:52] what are you where where is your heart
[1:13:54] going experts estimate that over 210
[1:13:56] million people worldwide suffer from
[1:13:58] social media addiction that's a lot of
[1:14:00] people 210 million people and I'm sure
[1:14:03] that's even gone up 15 of people aged 23
[1:14:06] to 38 admit they are addicted to to
[1:14:08] social media that's only 15% when we
[1:14:10] know that the stat should be way higher
[1:14:12] that's the problem is they can't admit
[1:14:13] to it teens who spend more than 5 hours
[1:14:16] a day uh phones are two times more
[1:14:19] likely to show depressive at side
[1:14:22] effects to show depression
[1:14:23] cuz that's unfortunately what these
[1:14:24] things do you go on there like I said to
[1:14:26] feel boost to get your likes to to get
[1:14:29] something inside of you that little
[1:14:30] hunger satisfied but actually causes
[1:14:32] more Depression more anxiety and all
[1:14:35] these things s out of 10 teens who use
[1:14:37] social media for more than 5 hours a day
[1:14:39] have a significant greater risk of
[1:14:41] committing suicide these are stats I'm
[1:14:44] I'm not pulling this up this is from
[1:14:46] World Health guys that do all this stuff
[1:14:49] okay yet again we're not condemning
[1:14:51] social media I'm not saying get off
[1:14:52] Facebook and get off Tik Tok or whatever
[1:14:53] you are but if you can't control it you
[1:14:56] need to then be
[1:14:57] real 27% of people spend more than 3
[1:15:00] hours a day on social media uh displayed
[1:15:03] poor mental
[1:15:04] health facts it's not me it's not
[1:15:07] brother Michael it's facts from the
[1:15:09] health side of the
[1:15:12] world now this is as I said we this
[1:15:16] thing this thing as we know gets into
[1:15:17] everything I can get into anything I
[1:15:19] want practically on this thing it's open
[1:15:21] device I mean for the used to talk
[1:15:23] against television we now have
[1:15:25] television we now have games we now have
[1:15:27] you know internet we have everything on
[1:15:28] this phone and we Carri it with us even
[1:15:30] went into
[1:15:32] church how dangerous that this thing has
[1:15:36] been put amongst us and the devil has
[1:15:38] made it that you almost don't have a
[1:15:39] choice now so many of us are jobs we
[1:15:41] have to have our phone we have to talk
[1:15:43] with clients so he's forced this thing
[1:15:45] upon us yet this is the worst Little
[1:15:47] Weapon that has ever been given to
[1:15:49] mankind because you can be alone in your
[1:15:51] bed no one knows about it and you can
[1:15:53] can be anywhere in the world looking at
[1:15:55] anything you want to the deepest darkest
[1:15:57] stuff the first question tonight brother
[1:15:59] brandom I think television is a curse to
[1:16:01] the world what do you think about it
[1:16:03] well whoever wrote it remember yeah now
[1:16:05] we don't even talk about television it's
[1:16:06] just all this other stuff that has come
[1:16:08] I'm going to agree with you they have
[1:16:09] made it a curse to the world it could be
[1:16:11] a blessing to the world but they've made
[1:16:13] it a curse that's the point it's not
[1:16:15] that TV is bad it's what they do on the
[1:16:16] TV that's a problem anything like that
[1:16:19] my dear people is what you look at
[1:16:21] yourself cuz yeah is the true truth of
[1:16:23] it if television is a curse then the
[1:16:25] newspaper is a
[1:16:26] curse then the radio is a curse and many
[1:16:29] times the telephone is the telephone is
[1:16:30] a curse CCC it's what you make out of it
[1:16:34] that's the big thing if you can control
[1:16:37] it it's fine but if you can't control it
[1:16:39] then you going to have to put some
[1:16:40] blockers blocks blockages in place cuz
[1:16:43] that's ultimately what you need to do
[1:16:44] and and get obviously Deliverance which
[1:16:46] we'll we'll finish off on so yes it's
[1:16:48] not so much about that but it's
[1:16:50] about what you do with it
[1:16:53] but by God's grace we have a Christian
[1:16:56] anesthetic amen there's opium comes from
[1:16:59] a Lily and the Christian church has some
[1:17:01] opium and it's from the lily of the
[1:17:03] valley amen uhhuh sues all the pains and
[1:17:06] it's all over then when you get this
[1:17:08] Christian opium this new wine that they
[1:17:10] have had on the day of Pentecost see it
[1:17:12] soes out the pain people so arrogant and
[1:17:15] they're doing things that they ought not
[1:17:17] to do instead of trying to get rid of
[1:17:19] the cause now this is so important
[1:17:21] remember we spoke about causes how Satan
[1:17:23] gets a cause and then he can get in and
[1:17:26] if you don't identify your cause it can
[1:17:28] sometimes hinder your healing that's why
[1:17:30] I say we're going to go to some dark we
[1:17:31] have to go to some dark places because
[1:17:33] if you can't admit my dad has hurt me
[1:17:35] you won't be able to get healing you
[1:17:36] have to sometimes be honest with
[1:17:37] yourself if you can't admit I've been
[1:17:38] hurt and my hurt has drove me to
[1:17:40] pornography and all these things you're
[1:17:42] not going to be able to get it and and
[1:17:44] yes the Lord can be gracious because we
[1:17:45] don't know these things sometimes we
[1:17:46] have generational problems that have
[1:17:48] been handed down but by God's grace
[1:17:50] let's just open our hearts and be honest
[1:17:53] instead of trying to get rid of the
[1:17:54] cause they're just putting another cause
[1:17:56] with it so you're not acknowledging the
[1:17:58] problem so you're replacing it with
[1:17:59] something else you can never find the
[1:18:02] cure until you get rid of the
[1:18:04] cause you see in the prayer lines people
[1:18:06] come to brother Brandon and what does he
[1:18:08] do where he wherever it's necessary
[1:18:10] he'll go to the course oh I see you as a
[1:18:13] young girl walking down the street and a
[1:18:14] dog started chasing you and since then
[1:18:17] you've been a nervous person why did the
[1:18:20] prophet have to say that why could he
[1:18:21] say you're a nervous person Lord help
[1:18:23] the sister deliver of nervousness and
[1:18:25] mental issues no he went to the cause
[1:18:28] and identified it and then the the Satan
[1:18:31] was exposed we know that story about
[1:18:33] that woman that uh committed adultery
[1:18:36] and uh she was trying to get prayed and
[1:18:37] brother B no matter how much he prayed
[1:18:39] he couldn't get her he couldn't help her
[1:18:40] she couldn't get deliverance and she got
[1:18:42] sick and sick and sick and eventually
[1:18:43] all the years passed and then it came to
[1:18:45] the prophet that she had committed
[1:18:47] adultery and never made it right with
[1:18:48] her husband and that hindered her
[1:18:50] healing so you want to you want to put
[1:18:53] in a a front and and build Wars around
[1:18:55] you not allow the Lord to get to the
[1:18:57] cause well then he can't help you but if
[1:18:59] you can be honest and go back to the
[1:19:00] cause he can help
[1:19:02] you man is trying to find something to
[1:19:05] satisfy and he thirsts cuz you've been
[1:19:07] hurt and your your Nature's within you
[1:19:09] like that and God made him to thirst
[1:19:11] that he was built up that way but God
[1:19:13] built him that way so he thirst after
[1:19:16] him not other things but he tries to
[1:19:18] satisfy it and hush that Holy core in
[1:19:21] him with things of the world and we have
[1:19:23] no right to do that now but the people
[1:19:26] do wrong constantly constantly instead
[1:19:29] of going to the place to get rid of the
[1:19:31] cause we try to Hass it with anesthetics
[1:19:34] with pornography with social media with
[1:19:37] gaming and liquor and smoking and
[1:19:40] putting more to it heaping it up all the
[1:19:42] time making it worse and all this only
[1:19:45] builds up pressure it makes it worse all
[1:19:47] the
[1:19:51] time
[1:19:54] I want to help you with your addictions
[1:19:56] and your problems because this is
[1:19:57] something that I had to go through
[1:19:59] remember I said that even though I
[1:20:01] received the Holy Ghost I still had my
[1:20:03] addiction problem I told you that the
[1:20:06] Lord had to show me a walk of how to get
[1:20:08] rid of it this is where I want to help
[1:20:10] you brother and sisters so I want you to
[1:20:11] take note amen we're going to go through
[1:20:13] something very critical and by God's
[1:20:16] grace I trust this will be the day that
[1:20:18] many here will get Deliverance of the
[1:20:20] things that are bothering you and those
[1:20:22] things but you're going to have to walk
[1:20:23] a road and I need to explain this so
[1:20:25] take note carefully of this part because
[1:20:27] it's so important to understand okay so
[1:20:30] you get two things how God heals you
[1:20:32] okay God is the Healer he died on the
[1:20:34] cross to heal you he is the Healer you
[1:20:36] just have to accept it that's it's done
[1:20:39] this you're you're overcoming your
[1:20:40] addiction your issues your heart
[1:20:42] problems it's done God has already said
[1:20:44] he died on the cross for you but now you
[1:20:45] need to accept it and find a way how he
[1:20:48] can help you now Miracles and Divine
[1:20:51] Healing is two different things you need
[1:20:53] to understand this okay a miracle is I
[1:20:56] come and I pray for the sister with
[1:20:58] cancer on her neck and instantly the
[1:21:00] cancer drops off and she's
[1:21:02] healed we would love to have that amen I
[1:21:06] would love God right now to just come
[1:21:07] down and all of you and say all the
[1:21:09] pornography all the addictions are gone
[1:21:11] in Jesus name and it's out the window
[1:21:13] wouldn't that be
[1:21:14] wonderful but you see there's another
[1:21:17] way God heals and that's through Divine
[1:21:20] Healing now how Divine Healing works
[1:21:22] we're going to go through and brother
[1:21:24] brandham says that God now mostly deals
[1:21:26] in Divine Healing he says that so yes we
[1:21:29] love the Miracles and that's often what
[1:21:31] we always play when we hear a little
[1:21:32] sermon clip how this person instantly
[1:21:35] receives their sight or whatever yeah it
[1:21:36] excites us but the reality is most of
[1:21:38] the time God deals in Divine
[1:21:41] Healing so to get Divine Healing first
[1:21:43] of all you have to acknowledge you need
[1:21:45] healing if you can't acknowledge you
[1:21:47] need help it's not going to help so yes
[1:21:50] it's easy when you got an outside thing
[1:21:52] to say oh I've got uh you know cancer or
[1:21:55] I've got low blood pre uh high blood
[1:21:57] pressure or I've got this disease or
[1:21:58] that disease because you feel it it
[1:22:00] affects you right not so easy when it
[1:22:02] goes into the heart realm and the spirit
[1:22:05] realm because you also need healing from
[1:22:06] the spirit realm and the Heart realm so
[1:22:09] first you need to acknowledge you need
[1:22:11] help and you need healing for both
[1:22:13] physical and emotional disease it
[1:22:15] doesn't just stop at the Physical
[1:22:19] Realm so through prayer as I said it's
[1:22:22] it's a fact if if if a minister of the
[1:22:24] Gospel or even you amongst each other
[1:22:26] can pray for each other you will that
[1:22:28] demon leaves it's it's of God it's
[1:22:31] commanded of God that that demon leaves
[1:22:33] but what happens this is what happens is
[1:22:36] brother bam shows that initially you
[1:22:38] might feel fine but as a few days pass
[1:22:41] you'll feel worse than ever that's what
[1:22:43] he says so he talks like about a cancer
[1:22:45] inside of you you pray that demon leaves
[1:22:48] the cancer but that cancer is still
[1:22:49] within you and now your blood has to
[1:22:52] purify out that cancer and he says
[1:22:55] you'll feel worse and more sick than
[1:22:57] ever and he says almost some as he says
[1:22:59] there that you almost feel like you're
[1:23:00] going to die and you're going to have
[1:23:03] some serious things you're going to have
[1:23:04] to do but pretty much it's the body
[1:23:06] cleaning out and
[1:23:08] repairing he talks about beh having
[1:23:10] almost torture physically mentally and
[1:23:13] you could feel like you can just go go
[1:23:14] die or go insane however he says that's
[1:23:17] the time to praise him because that's
[1:23:19] evidence that the demon has left you
[1:23:23] but what happens many times that we
[1:23:25] doubt our healing and our faith wavers
[1:23:27] then the devil Returns what happens he
[1:23:29] prays the demon out and the Bible says
[1:23:31] he goes walk the demon goes walking in
[1:23:32] dry places and if he comes back and he
[1:23:34] finds that the house is empty he comes
[1:23:36] straight back in and brother Bram says
[1:23:38] if you doubt it then the devil com
[1:23:40] straight back
[1:23:44] in so I'm done but now I need you to
[1:23:49] ready to pay attention remember we spoke
[1:23:51] about the dope mean damage of the brain
[1:23:54] okay your brain has been damaged by
[1:23:58] Satan it needs healing so what is
[1:24:01] happening many times brothers and
[1:24:03] sisters you've come up to for prayer
[1:24:05] many times am I right some of us have
[1:24:07] come up to the prayer line or we've
[1:24:08] prayed out to God asking him for
[1:24:10] deliverance and like I said God is the
[1:24:12] deliverer he is the Healer and God will
[1:24:16] heal you but what happens is because
[1:24:18] your mind is damaged and like I said
[1:24:20] it's maybe easier if you had a cancel
[1:24:22] something but this is in the spirit
[1:24:23] realm this is in your mind realm that is
[1:24:25] damaged remember I explained it's
[1:24:27] scientific your brain is actually had
[1:24:29] damage done now that water that wants to
[1:24:31] keep flowing down when the pressure
[1:24:33] Rises wants to come there and yes you
[1:24:35] prayed away the demon that the devil got
[1:24:37] in V porography or whatever it's in that
[1:24:39] channel that is damaged but
[1:24:42] now we need healing and now what has to
[1:24:46] happen is you're going to have to
[1:24:47] understand brothers and sisters that if
[1:24:49] like brother BR says many times you're
[1:24:51] going to have to go through he healing
[1:24:53] and I would love like I said just to
[1:24:54] have a miracle but now your brain being
[1:24:56] damaged it needs to build a bridge back
[1:24:59] where the damage is so that your mind
[1:25:01] can start running normal again like it
[1:25:04] should so understand you're going to
[1:25:07] have to maybe go through some intense
[1:25:09] struggle and mental battles when you're
[1:25:12] delivered of your thing and your evens
[1:25:15] slip up why because remember it's
[1:25:17] damaged but you no matter even if you
[1:25:19] slip up even if you find yourself going
[1:25:21] back if you you already believe God has
[1:25:23] delivered you of that problem you're
[1:25:25] going to have to hold fast in faith that
[1:25:28] even when things come to say I believe
[1:25:30] that you have done this for me God I
[1:25:32] believe I'm delivered and haltered and
[1:25:34] not doubt that is hard that is going to
[1:25:37] be hard but I believe if you're really
[1:25:40] sincere if you really want to walk the
[1:25:41] road of healing and we're going to pray
[1:25:44] over each other now amen by God's grace
[1:25:46] Grace and and if there's some ministers
[1:25:48] are like to come if you are like to come
[1:25:49] forward to be to pray it if you want to
[1:25:51] really commit but you're going to have
[1:25:52] to be committed I'm I'm going to tell
[1:25:53] you now it's going to not be easy like
[1:25:55] the prophet says that when you get
[1:25:56] healing it's horrible you almost want to
[1:25:58] die imagine a brain that is damage that
[1:26:00] you're going to have to allow God over
[1:26:02] his time to build the bridge back it's
[1:26:05] going to be so difficult but if you want
[1:26:07] to trust God and believe God for your
[1:26:09] deliverance he can do it I had to walk
[1:26:13] that road I didn't understand it I knew
[1:26:15] that Spirit was gone I could feel it but
[1:26:17] I'll now and again finding myself
[1:26:18] tripping up and I was questioning the
[1:26:20] Lord how can this be I know that is gone
[1:26:22] how can this be and he said to me son
[1:26:24] I'm healing you it will take
[1:26:29] time so there's 100% power in prayer to

[1:39:50] blessing
[1:39:51] I I'm just I don't want to take more
[1:39:55] time but I just want to just want to
[1:39:57] share one or two
[1:39:59] thoughts and that is that you know
[1:40:04] Jesus could have grown
[1:40:06] up and
[1:40:09] identify with with a Mary and a
[1:40:12] Joseph Jesus could you know today we go
[1:40:15] back we read in Matthew 1 AM mean David
[1:40:18] was the son of Jesse and Solomon was the
[1:40:20] son of David and the lineage and so
[1:40:21] forth and he could look at his natural
[1:40:24] lineage or Jesus could go to John one
[1:40:28] and find his spiritual lineage and see
[1:40:30] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:40:32] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:40:34] and identify with himself there I want
[1:40:37] to encourage you this morning identify
[1:40:39] with your heavenly father you know
[1:40:41] brother random got to a point where he
[1:40:43] said I recognized I'm no longer the son
[1:40:45] of Charles and Ella Brenham because
[1:40:47] before I was the son of Charles and Ella
[1:40:49] Brenham I was the son of God H Allelujah
[1:40:51] in fact when the logos was expressed I
[1:40:53] know this is maybe deep but when the
[1:40:55] logos was expressed on Earth already I
[1:40:57] was expressed as a Son of God right
[1:41:00] there hallelujah amen and when we battle
[1:41:04] through this earth when our Earthly
[1:41:06] parents haven't haven't been what they
[1:41:08] should have been because of like our
[1:41:09] brother said because of their own hurts
[1:41:11] because of their own complexes because
[1:41:12] of their own experience we have a
[1:41:14] heavenly father who really really does
[1:41:17] care amen also just want to mention
[1:41:20] something quickly about that principle
[1:41:22] of Divine Healing there's this a very
[1:41:24] beautiful symbol that I also always love
[1:41:26] looking at you know the time of the
[1:41:29] Jubilee year you know the principle
[1:41:31] right so in when the Jubilee year comes
[1:41:34] and there's been a squatter on the land
[1:41:36] when the Jubilee year comes the land is
[1:41:40] restored but sometimes when the land has
[1:41:42] been restored the squatter didn't look
[1:41:44] after the land very much and sometimes
[1:41:47] when that land has been restored now the
[1:41:49] original owner that the land has been
[1:41:50] been restored too has a lot of hard work
[1:41:53] to do to pick up the stones to to
[1:41:57] recultivated the land to trim All The
[1:42:00] Vines and sometimes that takes time and
[1:42:03] that's how Divine Healing works you know
[1:42:05] sometimes it's restored to you but
[1:42:08] there's work to do I mean there's a time
[1:42:10] there's Faith to have there's a
[1:42:12] testimony to have I mean it's like that
[1:42:15] John Ryan that brother Bram speaks about
[1:42:17] you know he was he was healed but he had
[1:42:20] to go confess his healing and that blind
[1:42:23] man you remember the story when
[1:42:24] eventually he sat in that barber's chair
[1:42:26] one day he got the manifestation of his
[1:42:28] healing but it didn't just happen
[1:42:30] immediately am mean may the Lord give
[1:42:32] you that Grace I mean that that
[1:42:34] revelation will strike your heart that I
[1:42:37] am healed I'm set free the the the
[1:42:39] chains have been broken and trust the
[1:42:41] Lord and working the testimony even if
[1:42:44] you do not see one symptom of it because
[1:42:46] like a brother said yesterday that's the
[1:42:48] sign of a mature person is when we when
[1:42:51] we walk in faith even when we do not see
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:54] evidence Hallelujah let's sing one more
[1:42:56] Song without music because I suspect not
[1:42:59] many would know
[1:43:01] it it's a old old song but it goes for
[1:43:05] the old old
[1:43:08] people
