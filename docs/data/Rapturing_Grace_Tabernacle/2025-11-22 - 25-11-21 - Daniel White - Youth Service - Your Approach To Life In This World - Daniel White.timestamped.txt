[29:43] for you, [music] my master.
[29:48] Ready [singing]
[29:49] to do [music] your will.
[29:56] Praise the Lord. [music]
[29:58] It's real special to be here tonight on
[30:00] a Friday night. It's lovely to have our
[30:03] visitors with us. God bless you each
[30:04] one, different ones. Welcome. Trust that
[30:07] you'll enjoy the time together [music]
[30:09] with us. Um, we have a very special
[30:12] welcome for brother Daniel and sister
[30:14] Cheryl here that thankfully made it
[30:16] [music] to Tanaki. Um, but it's real
[30:19] special to have you. I'm just looking
[30:21] forward to how the Lord's going to use
[30:23] you tonight, Brother Daniel. Um, so I'm
[30:26] not going to take any any time. Um,
[30:29] let's maybe sing one more song as I call
[30:31] Brother Daniel up
[30:34] and then we'll get straight into the
[30:37] word. Where are we? Um,
[30:41] right. We're not going to sing the whole
[30:43] song. Let's just maybe sing.
[30:48] Let's just sing verse one in the chorus.
[30:50] [music] Okay.
[30:52] Let the weak [singing] say I am strong.
[30:57] [music]
[30:58] Let the poor say I am [singing] rich.
[31:02] [music]
[31:03] Let the blind say I can see. [music]
[31:08] It's what the Lord has.
[31:13] [music]
[31:16] [singing]
[31:22] [singing]
[31:25] [music]
[31:28] Yeah.
[31:30] Heat. [music]
[31:33] [singing]
[31:39] [music]
[31:40] [singing]
[31:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:51] [singing and music]
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus died
[31:56] and rose again. [singing]
[32:00] Amen. Amen. Let the weak say I am
[32:04] strong.
[32:06] Why? Because it's what the Lord has done
[32:08] for me. [music] Amen. God bless you.
[32:11] Thank you musicians.
[32:13] Good to see everyone. Some of you I
[32:14] know, some of you I I don't know, but
[32:17] it's wonderful to be part of the
[32:19] service.
[32:20] Uh tonight, I want to thank brother
[32:22] Elray's effort for uh uh we didn't get
[32:26] our flight last night from New Plymouth
[32:29] to
[32:31] uh sorry, Oakland to New Plymouth and uh
[32:34] brother Ellery had to drive up last
[32:35] night and pick us up from Oakland and
[32:38] drive us back again. So, we appreciate
[32:40] brother Elray's effort and in getting us
[32:43] here and all your effort as well in in
[32:45] in being here this evening in this
[32:48] service, the musicians, the song leader,
[32:50] the brother who prayed for the service
[32:53] and uh the tech team, everyone just
[32:55] appreciate you all and uh we're thankful
[32:59] that we can uh assemble like we can. I
[33:03] better thank my wife for being here,
[33:04] too. Thank you, Don. But praise the
[33:07] Lord. It's um it's a real privilege to
[33:10] be able to join ourselves together this
[33:13] way and just share the things that the
[33:16] Lord places on our heart that are that
[33:18] are very dear to us and and uh trusting
[33:22] that the service will be a blessing
[33:25] uh an encouragement to to each each and
[33:28] every one of you. Uh it's it's never a
[33:31] problem
[33:33] um that we don't have anything to say.
[33:37] There's always plenty to say, but it's
[33:41] seeking the will of God to know what to
[33:43] say.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Because it's what we say that makes the
[33:46] difference, not how much we say. Um so,
[33:51] praise the Lord. We'll uh get into the
[33:54] service. Um, speaking of it's not how
[33:58] much we say, I got 45 minutes. All
[34:00] right. And I got a stopwatch
[34:04] because I can be one of those that can
[34:06] [snorts] speak
[34:08] um what's on my heart and sometimes you
[34:11] just carry a lot. [laughter]
[34:13] So, praise the Lord. Praise God. I just
[34:15] want to share this little picture with
[34:17] you here. Um,
[34:20] I thought it was really neat. I was out
[34:21] on a property. I go out to a property
[34:23] and and uh do a bit of hunting out there
[34:25] and and uh this I I walked upon this
[34:29] tree and and um you can see down the
[34:34] bottom here that there it's a stump, but
[34:38] there's a a tree growing inside another
[34:42] tree.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, yeah. Isn't that a
[34:45] perfect picture of me?
[34:48] There's there's a life inside of a of
[34:51] what the prophet would call a coat
[34:54] that's pushing out. And uh you can kind
[34:57] of see how the the old the old tree has
[35:00] kind of split because the the new life
[35:03] that is within the old stump is has
[35:06] grown and grows and grows. But you know,
[35:10] it wasn't always like that. Yeah, it
[35:12] it's it started as a as a little as a
[35:15] little seed that maybe a a bird dropped
[35:18] in there when it sat on the stump or
[35:20] however it got there. But we know that a
[35:22] seed got there because we can see the
[35:25] see the result of it. But over the
[35:28] process of time, what what happened what
[35:31] happened here is the tree grew bigger
[35:33] and bigger and it couldn't fit in the
[35:36] coat anymore. You know, it couldn't fit
[35:37] in the old stump anymore. And we know
[35:39] that God has placed a life within us
[35:43] within us. Um, and it's inside this this
[35:46] old coat. And I don't know how how
[35:49] you're feeling, but it it feels like
[35:51] sometimes there's not enough room for me
[35:55] &gt;&gt; in this body. And uh I feel like that
[35:59] the bride is is growing to to a level of
[36:04] maturity. Not not because of anything
[36:06] she has done or doing, but it's because
[36:09] of what the Lord is doing for her that
[36:11] there's someone in her that is is it's
[36:14] getting a bit tight in here. And one day
[36:17] it's just going to bust out and and uh
[36:20] and receive a a a body change, a a new
[36:24] dwelling place. And uh it was just a a
[36:28] blessing to me how God testifies
[36:31] of what he's doing in our lives in
[36:34] nature.
[36:36] So we can we can see God in in many many
[36:39] many places but uh the most important
[36:43] place to [clears throat] see the Lord is
[36:44] within ourselves.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh the the thought we want to
[36:51] look at this this evening is your
[36:54] approach to life in [snorts] this world
[36:58] becoming
[37:00] what you are. It's it's a bit of a
[37:03] paradox and I just want you to think
[37:05] about that a little bit. Becoming
[37:09] what you are.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Not you're not becoming
[37:13] something that you're not but becoming
[37:17] what you are. So let's turn to the book
[37:19] of Hebrews and you know this this
[37:21] chapter sorry this verse here very well.
[37:24] We're not going to actually turn to
[37:25] Revelations. We're going to go to Judges
[37:27] 6 instead of Revelation. But um Hebrews
[37:32] 13:8 uh this was the theme of the of the
[37:36] prophet's ministry which we love so
[37:38] much. Is Jesus Christ
[37:42] &gt;&gt; the same
[37:44] &gt;&gt; yesterday and today and forever?
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're thankful that he is the
[37:52] same yesterday, today and forever. Amen.
[37:55] So let's turn to uh Judges chapter 6.
[37:58] This is the uh the the the story of
[38:01] Gideon.
[38:03] And we kind of you've probably heard
[38:05] this many times, no doubt. And I'm not
[38:07] here to to u bring anything new
[38:09] obviously. Um but we just want to catch
[38:14] some points here in Judges 6 starting at
[38:18] verse 11.
[38:21] And there came an angel of the Lord and
[38:24] sat under an oak which is in offer
[38:30] that pertained to Joash the abusite
[38:34] and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the
[38:38] wine press to hide it from the
[38:41] Midianites.
[38:43] Now that wine, the the the wheat that he
[38:46] was um
[38:49] threshing there was his inheritance.
[38:54] It's what he fed on. It's what sustained
[38:57] him. But here he was
[39:00] uh um a man as we know, Gideon, who was
[39:05] doing what he was doing because he was
[39:09] afraid of history repeating itself, as
[39:13] the prophet would explain,
[39:16] and hiding
[39:18] uh his inheritance, hoping that the
[39:21] Medidianites wouldn't arrive and take
[39:23] his inheritance. And our inheritance is
[39:26] the word of God.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; This that's that's our that's our
[39:31] inheritance. But God doesn't want us to
[39:33] handle the word in fear.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Afraid of the enemy.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; All right. In verse 12,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[39:44] him and said unto him, [clears throat]
[39:48] the Lord is with thee,
[39:51] thy mighty man of valor." Amen. Let's
[39:55] bow our hearts. So, heavenly father,
[39:58] oh Lord God, we just want to commit this
[40:00] service into your hands, Lord. May
[40:02] everything that is said and done be for
[40:03] your honor and glory in Jesus Christ's
[40:06] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[40:09] take your seats.
[40:12] See, sometimes I even forget to start
[40:13] the stopwatch and I start at half an
[40:15] hour late. So
[40:21] So to to understand this thought
[40:23] tonight, I've just got a picture there.
[40:25] And you might say, "Well, how does it
[40:27] relate?" Well, it's a picture of a of
[40:29] the bride and groom. Um what I've used
[40:32] as a bride, the bride and the groom. But
[40:36] to understand this thought um and I'm
[40:39] quickly going to go through this this
[40:40] part of the service is that um we need
[40:44] to understand what life is [snorts] all
[40:47] about. What what is life about in or on
[40:53] this earth at this particular time?
[40:57] Okay. Um
[41:01] we understand we did not come into this
[41:04] world by our own choosing.
[41:07] Um we we did not um uh we did not come
[41:11] into this world by our mother or our
[41:14] father's choosing. But we came into this
[41:17] world because God ordained us. God chose
[41:21] us to be here at this particular time.
[41:26] Uh he chose us to be here at the time of
[41:30] the voice of the seventh angel. Uh he he
[41:34] chose you to be here at this time of the
[41:38] the the climax of everything God has
[41:41] been aiming for. One goal was to have a
[41:45] bride
[41:47] for himself. So we we understand that uh
[41:52] nothing happens without a reason. God
[41:55] doesn't do anything without there being
[41:57] a purpose in why he is doing it and what
[42:02] he is doing. All right. But part of the
[42:07] thought I want to share with you is that
[42:09] life here as in in time we're going to
[42:14] take two aspects.
[42:16] Life in time is not about life in time.
[42:22] [clears throat]
[42:24] All right. Life in time in in God's view
[42:29] is not about life in time.
[42:34] We'll say it another way. Life in this
[42:38] dimension is not actually about life in
[42:42] this dimension.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; God sent you here in time. He allowed
[42:49] you to be here at this time, but his
[42:54] focus for you in being here is not
[42:58] actually here.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; He has a purpose for you being here, but
[43:04] his purpose for you being here extends
[43:07] beyond life in time.
[43:11] A way that you could um you could think
[43:13] about this and just bring it into our
[43:15] natural lives is that your parents
[43:19] um that let's say they you might be
[43:22] homeschooled but just roll with me. All
[43:24] right. Your your your parents sent you
[43:27] to school.
[43:29] All right. If I had a choice, I wouldn't
[43:30] have gone. The only reason I went was
[43:33] because I was sent. All right. So your
[43:35] your parents sent you to school. But
[43:39] life in school is not about life in
[43:43] school.
[43:46] Life in school is actually about life
[43:49] after school.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Life in school is what prepares you for
[43:56] life after school. Right? So we are in
[44:02] time
[44:03] but life doesn't end with time.
[44:08] Yes. Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Life continues after time.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; It's like when you first go to school
[44:17] and you know you got 12 years of school
[44:19] and if you if you're smart enough you'll
[44:21] go to university. It's like man it feels
[44:24] like eternity in school. uh one day is
[44:28] bad enough, let alone 12 years, you
[44:29] know, like but but God's purpose
[44:35] for you being here in time is to prepare
[44:40] you for life in eternity,
[44:44] &gt;&gt; right? We could say that our life in
[44:48] time is our schooling
[44:51] because what happens in school is you
[44:53] learn,
[44:55] right? You become educated, you mature,
[44:58] you learn from you you move from 1 + 1
[45:01] to n uh 9 * 8 into algebra and all these
[45:06] different aspects of of mathematics.
[45:08] Progressively, you move up. You you
[45:10] become educated. Well, God isn't God
[45:14] isn't educating us in the sense of our
[45:18] mind, but he is giving us revelation.
[45:22] And education is revelation just on a
[45:25] natural sense.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Right? So um
[45:30] life God's purpose for you here is to
[45:35] develop you
[45:38] for a purpose that he has for you after
[45:43] or when time is no more.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; For life in eternity. So time life in
[45:51] time is about life in eternity.
[45:55] So what God is doing with you here is
[45:58] [snorts] that God is preparing you. God
[46:01] is developing you. This is why things
[46:04] happen. All right? Things happen in life
[46:07] that we don't understand why they
[46:10] happen. And maybe there are things in
[46:12] our lives that happen in life that we
[46:15] will not understand in this life.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[46:18] &gt;&gt; It's the same as when you're going
[46:19] through school, you're sitting at the
[46:21] desk and saying, "Why do I need to learn
[46:23] this?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; What has this got to do with my life?"
[46:26] And 10, 20 years down the track, you
[46:28] realize, "Oh, yeah, they knew better.
[46:31] That's why I learned this."
[46:32] &gt;&gt; You know, and it's the same with our our
[46:35] lives here, what what God is doing
[46:38] [snorts] um with us as individuals. He's
[46:42] preparing us. He's developing us. uh
[46:45] he's maturing us for a purpose that he
[46:49] has for us beyond this life. All right.
[46:53] To me, one of the the the greatest lies
[46:56] of the devil is that life in time is
[46:59] about life in time.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Because we we gather riches and we die,
[47:07] we do this and we you know, if if
[47:09] there's no life after time, then what
[47:12] point was your life in time? But but God
[47:15] has a purpose for your life in time
[47:18] &gt;&gt; and that is because he has a purpose for
[47:21] you after time
[47:23] &gt;&gt; or in eternity.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; So God is preparing you here for there.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; So time is what God uses to develop you
[47:37] for life after time. All right.
[47:42] um
[47:45] in uh the book of John.
[47:48] Oh, don't know how we got there. Did I
[47:50] have John on there, brother, or not?
[47:53] Maybe I put the wrong slide on there.
[47:57] Can we go back to slide one? No, I don't
[48:02] I don't have John on there. That's okay.
[48:03] I'll read it to you. John John 14 um
[48:07] two, [clears throat] it says, "In my
[48:08] father's house are many mansions. If it
[48:11] were not so, I would have told you. I go
[48:13] and prepare a place for you. If I go and
[48:16] prepare a place for you, I will come
[48:18] again and receive you under myself, that
[48:21] where I am, there ye may be also.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; All right. So God God's focus for your
[48:28] life is not actually in time.
[48:33] God's focus for your life is for life in
[48:36] eternity. But before we can go there,
[48:41] we've got to stay here and become
[48:44] developed,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; right? We've got to become developed.
[48:47] And that's where the thought comes in.
[48:49] Becoming what you are because life in
[48:53] time is where you become what you are.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; You you cannot become anything else.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; It is it for the for for the bride's
[49:04] life, it is impossible. Yes,
[49:07] &gt;&gt; for you to be anything else other than
[49:10] what you are.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; It is impossible. Absolutely 100%
[49:15] impossible. And the reason that it's
[49:17] impossible is because it's thus, sayeth
[49:20] the Lord.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we we saw in and we'll
[49:25] get to it a little bit later, but just
[49:26] to go back to the scripture in Judges uh
[49:30] six there, the the Gideon received his
[49:33] message.
[49:35] The message for his hour and the message
[49:37] for his hour revealed who he was.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Right. So, Gideon was thankful for his
[49:45] message the same as you and I are are
[49:48] are thankful for for our message. All
[49:51] right. So
[49:54] um
[49:59] we think about this we can think about
[50:01] it even the in the form of the body in
[50:04] which we dwell.
[50:09] This body is temporal.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; It's not eternal.
[50:13] But one day we'll receive a glorified
[50:16] body, an eternal body.
[50:19] But even the body that God has placed
[50:22] you in has a purpose.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Because if what what would it
[50:30] what would it be like if he placed you
[50:33] in a perfect body
[50:36] in time?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; There there there wouldn't be struggles.
[50:41] It sounds great, doesn't it? Uh it there
[50:44] wouldn't be struggles. There wouldn't be
[50:45] fights. You wouldn't have disagreements
[50:47] with yourself. You wouldn't argue with
[50:48] yourself. You wouldn't struggle with
[50:50] yourself. You wouldn't need to overcome
[50:52] yourself. But there's a purpose for God
[50:55] placing you in the body that he has
[50:59] placed you.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And what is what is wonderful about this
[51:03] is that
[51:04] &gt;&gt; we all have a body that is shaped in sin
[51:08] and born in iniquity by by sex desire.
[51:11] But we are so different from one
[51:15] another. Yeah,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; you know, we have different
[51:17] personalities. We're born under
[51:19] different star signs. We we have
[51:21] different upbringings. And because of
[51:23] those upbringings, we have little things
[51:25] in our in our spirits that um that we
[51:28] fight against. And you know, we we tend
[51:31] to do things that we shouldn't do and
[51:34] want to do the things that we we don't
[51:36] do and all these type of things. It's
[51:38] it's a battle. It's a it's a fight.
[51:40] There's a fight going going on. But the
[51:43] purpose of God putting you in the body
[51:46] that he has placed you in is to bring
[51:49] development.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Okay? This body has problems. It gets
[51:57] sick. It can think wrong thoughts. It
[52:00] goes through stages of life.
[52:05] It has the ability to see things that it
[52:08] it it can't handle. It has the ability
[52:11] to hear things that that can overcome
[52:15] it. Um talk about things that it
[52:19] shouldn't.
[52:21] It's a body that needs correction.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; It's a body that needs you to bring it
[52:28] subject
[52:30] &gt;&gt; to the word of God or or the will of
[52:32] God.
[52:34] Um, so this the the the place that God
[52:39] has placed you in this body, there's a
[52:43] purpose behind it. And the purpose of it
[52:46] again is so that you can become what you
[52:50] are
[52:52] because you can't come
[52:54] become what you are without a battle.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; There must be a battle. There must be
[53:01] overcoming. There's no way that Gideon
[53:04] could become what he was without there
[53:08] being a battle. All right? But life in
[53:12] this body is not about life in this
[53:15] body.
[53:17] Even though we we do all these wonderful
[53:19] things to it to try and make it look as
[53:21] eternal as it can. You we know it's all
[53:24] in vain. Um but life in this body is
[53:30] actually about life in your perfect
[53:32] body.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh but we can't step into or
[53:38] change out of this body and into our
[53:42] glorified body until the development
[53:46] as the seeds of God has been completed
[53:49] in this body.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[53:52] So in eternity
[53:55] you won't be developed any further than
[53:58] what you are
[54:00] &gt;&gt; because this is the place that God
[54:02] develops you.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he said what you
[54:07] are here
[54:09] &gt;&gt; you will be there.
[54:11] meaning that God has to bring you to a
[54:15] level of maturity
[54:17] &gt;&gt; concerning yourself because what you are
[54:21] here you will be there right so so we
[54:26] understand these things there's a
[54:27] purpose for our life in time and that is
[54:31] for God to develop us into what we are
[54:36] all right
[54:37] &gt;&gt; the change of dimension and we think
[54:40] about this you know And we we talk about
[54:42] this often um that um you know once we
[54:47] change that dimension then I'll be uh
[54:51] into that that next dimension then I'll
[54:54] be who God says I am. But I want to ask
[54:57] you a question.
[54:59] Would Gideon have need to be a mighty
[55:02] man of valor in the millennium?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Not at all.
[55:10] Not at all. Would you need to be an
[55:13] overcomer in the eternal dimension?
[55:18] So where's that going to happen?
[55:21] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen here.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're going to overcome here,
[55:26] then God has to bring you to a level of
[55:29] understanding, a level of revelation,
[55:32] &gt;&gt; character
[55:34] that you can overcome.
[55:37] Because character is the ability to make
[55:39] the right choices.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Okay? Character is the ability to make
[55:46] the right choices. And this is why we
[55:49] constantly need developing. If anybody
[55:52] says to you, "Well, I've I'm I've I've
[55:55] reached the the goal. God can't develop
[55:59] me anymore." Well, the fact that he's
[56:01] saying that proves that he needs more
[56:03] development.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; All right?
[56:07] So your approach to life is don't focus
[56:13] on the things in this life
[56:17] because the purpose of life here is for
[56:20] life in eternity.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; All right? So everything don't hold to
[56:26] anything here
[56:28] &gt;&gt; because God has a purpose. You may be
[56:30] poor, it doesn't matter. God has a
[56:32] purpose. You may be rich. It doesn't
[56:35] matter. God has a purpose.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; All right? So, uh, so our appro our
[56:41] approach to life needs to be his
[56:44] approach
[56:46] &gt;&gt; that I'm here. I'm here for a time. I'm
[56:49] here for a purpose. I'm here to be
[56:52] developed. I'm here to have a greater
[56:56] understanding of me. I'm here. It's like
[56:58] the the clay in the in the in the on the
[57:01] on the wheel on the potter's wheel. It's
[57:03] there for a time. It's there for a
[57:06] purpose. It's there so that the tender
[57:08] hand of Jehovah can mold and make it
[57:11] into an image that he has of you from
[57:15] before the foundation of the world.
[57:17] Right? So, and this is this is why this
[57:19] point is really important.
[57:22] You your journey didn't begin in time.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Your jour Let's use this. All right.
[57:31] time, eternity. Your journey didn't
[57:34] begin in time.
[57:38] Your journey actually began in the mind
[57:40] of God in eternity.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Right? So what what you were when God
[57:46] come to Gideon with the message of the
[57:49] hour to say, Gideon, thou art a mighty
[57:52] man of valor. That's what Gideon was in
[57:55] eternity.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Right? So, so your your your life in
[58:01] time [clears throat] is about the
[58:03] development of that thought.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Right? But the development of that
[58:10] thought has to go through the process of
[58:12] thought
[58:14] word manifestation.
[58:17] So when we look at this in verse 12
[58:20] where it says, "The Lord is with thee,
[58:23] thou mighty man of valor." That's how
[58:27] God saw Gideon.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it this it this way.
[58:30] That's what Gideon was
[58:34] &gt;&gt; as a thought in eternity.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And then Gideon was manifested on earth.
[58:40] Gideon was walking around as a mystery.
[58:43] Gideon did not know who he was. He was
[58:47] reflecting on his father's life and and
[58:50] and following down his father's
[58:52] footprints. His father probably threshed
[58:55] the weed in the same place
[58:58] &gt;&gt; doing the same thing with the same
[59:00] spirit of fear. But then Gideon received
[59:03] a message. It was the message of the
[59:06] hour.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that message of that because
[59:09] what the message of the hour was was the
[59:11] thought become word.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Right. And then the word was going to
[59:16] become manifest. But Gideon's uh the
[59:19] Lord said to Gideon here, "Thou art a
[59:22] mighty man of valor." All right. So,
[59:25] I've skipped right over a bunch of this,
[59:27] but praise the Lord. I got 25 minutes
[59:29] left. Um, so we let let let me ask you
[59:34] something.
[59:36] What could Gideon do
[59:38] to become
[59:41] what God said he was?
[59:44] Anyone
[59:48] want to comment?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[59:53] Anyone else?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Who said nothing?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:00:01] Nothing.
[1:00:06] We were going to start this service in
[1:00:09] um Genesis 12,
[1:00:12] the unconditional covenant
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; that God made with Abram.
[1:00:19] Abram, not Abraham. Abram.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Right. Maybe we should go there.
[1:00:29] And the Lord said unto Abram, "Get thee
[1:00:31] out of thy country, and from thy
[1:00:33] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[1:00:34] unto the land that I will show. I will
[1:00:36] make of thee a great nation. I will
[1:00:40] bless thee. I will make thy name great,
[1:00:44] and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will
[1:00:46] bless them that bless thee. I will curse
[1:00:48] them that curse thee. And in thee shall
[1:00:52] in thee shall all families of the earth
[1:00:55] be blessed."
[1:00:57] So
[1:00:59] God comes to Abraham and we know we can
[1:01:01] let me just go to to the next slide
[1:01:05] here.
[1:01:07] um
[1:01:10] the Lord coming to Abraham again or
[1:01:12] Abram and Abram fell on his face and God
[1:01:14] talked with him saying, "As for me,
[1:01:17] behold, my covenant is with thee, and
[1:01:19] thou shalt be a father of many nations.
[1:01:23] Neither shall thy name be anymore called
[1:01:27] Abram, but thy name shall be called
[1:01:29] Abraham, for a father of many nations I
[1:01:33] have made thee." All right. So the
[1:01:37] prophet of God picks this up and he
[1:01:39] tells us about how this was not
[1:01:41] something that Abraham was going to or
[1:01:43] Abram was going to do, but this was
[1:01:46] something that God was had already done.
[1:01:49] He did he said it wasn't something that
[1:01:52] was God was going to do in the future
[1:01:53] tense. He said God had already done. And
[1:01:57] he focuses on this last part of verse
[1:02:00] five. For a father of many nations have
[1:02:03] I made thee. All right. Now God comes to
[1:02:07] a Abram before he was Abraham.
[1:02:12] So in Genesis 17, God changes his name
[1:02:17] from Abram to Abraham.
[1:02:20] But God, we understand that the covenant
[1:02:23] was made with Abram
[1:02:26] before he had received the sign of
[1:02:29] circumcision.
[1:02:32] The covenant was made with Abram before
[1:02:37] he received the sign of circumcision.
[1:02:40] But that covenant that God made
[1:02:45] was an expression
[1:02:47] of the thought of God.
[1:02:51] It wasn't just God coming down and said,
[1:02:53] "Hey, I've got a good idea. I'd never
[1:02:55] thought of this before, Abram. Why don't
[1:02:58] I form a covenant with you?"
[1:03:01] That's not how God worked. The the
[1:03:03] covenant that God came down and spoke to
[1:03:06] Abram about was an expression of the
[1:03:11] thought that he had concerning Abram
[1:03:15] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:03:17] here what we have is Abram receiving or
[1:03:21] coming into contact or God bringing the
[1:03:25] message for the hour that Abraham was
[1:03:29] living to Abraham and revealing Abraham
[1:03:33] or Abram to um an understanding of
[1:03:38] himself that he knew nothing about. It
[1:03:42] was not even possible as we know Abraham
[1:03:45] was without son. It was not even
[1:03:48] possible for Abram to be what God said
[1:03:52] he was or to become what God said he was
[1:03:57] to be naturally.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; It wasn't possible. It absolutely was
[1:04:03] not possible. All right. So
[1:04:07] God approached
[1:04:10] Abraham or Abram.
[1:04:14] [snorts] God spoke his message to Abram.
[1:04:19] And this is what God wanted Abram to
[1:04:23] approach life through.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:27] God wanted Abram to approach life not
[1:04:31] through his own thinking,
[1:04:34] not through what his past testified he
[1:04:38] was.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Not not through the history of
[1:04:44] what his family was.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Or his family name, but this was God
[1:04:52] giving Abram the opportunity to approach
[1:04:56] life in a way that he had never been
[1:04:59] able to approach life before.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we've got to be careful that
[1:05:06] we stay with the word. We hear that all
[1:05:08] the time. All right. We've got to stay
[1:05:11] with the covenant. Otherwise, if we
[1:05:14] don't stay with the covenant, we end up
[1:05:16] producing an Ishmael,
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; a wild man.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; When we begin to think that we have
[1:05:23] something to do with this,
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden anger rises up. All of
[1:05:28] sudden, frustration rises up. All of a
[1:05:31] sudden, you get an attitude.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; I tell you why. because you're trying to
[1:05:35] produce,
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; listen to this,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; what God said you are.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; So God gives us the opportunity through
[1:05:49] the message of the hour that we have
[1:05:51] received because the message of the hour
[1:05:54] calls you bride.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; It calls you bride.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; It's like God called Abraham a father.
[1:06:04] Not of just a father, but a father of
[1:06:06] many nations. God didn't God called
[1:06:09] Gideon not just a man of valor, but a
[1:06:13] mighty man of valor.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; God doesn't call you a bride, he calls
[1:06:18] you the bride of Christ.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when when when when
[1:06:24] we have received and hear the message of
[1:06:29] our hour, the message of the hour is
[1:06:32] what tells you who you are.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Not who you are if
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; not who you are when who you are.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Mary, thou hast found favor in the eyes
[1:06:47] of God. Thou shalt conceive. Not not
[1:06:49] when, not how, not if. Abram, thou art a
[1:06:54] thou, thou art a father of many nations.
[1:06:57] Gideon, thou art a a mighty man of
[1:07:01] valor. Sarah, thou art a woman, a mother
[1:07:05] of many nations.
[1:07:07] That there was there was nothing
[1:07:09] involved. This was unconditional.
[1:07:12] This was not even something.
[1:07:14] Oh, this is a paradox. All right. This
[1:07:18] was not even something that God wanted
[1:07:21] us to think about that we would become.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; God wants us to think about it how he
[1:07:30] thinks about it.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And if he says you are, then you are.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say it doesn't mean you know
[1:07:38] in your mind you say yeah I believe I
[1:07:41] am. But
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; right. So, we understand this was
[1:07:47] unconditional. We understand that the
[1:07:50] prophet talks about this over and over
[1:07:51] and over and over again. There's no
[1:07:54] strings tied to it at all. It has
[1:07:57] nothing to do with what you do.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; So, brother Dan, what you're saying is
[1:08:03] that you're telling me that I'm a bride
[1:08:05] and and yet yet I I I'm struggle with
[1:08:09] this and I struggle with that. That is
[1:08:11] what I am saying because that is what
[1:08:14] the message said.
[1:08:16] Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; When did Abram become the father of
[1:08:26] nations?
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Was it when he had Ishmael?
[1:08:41] Was it when he had Isaac?
[1:08:46] The fact is that in the mind of God, he
[1:08:49] always was.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; The truth of this is that there was
[1:09:01] nothing
[1:09:05] that had to happen
[1:09:09] that would make Abraham a father of many
[1:09:12] nations.
[1:09:17] because that is what he was. And I know
[1:09:19] I know I I meant to say when I started
[1:09:21] this thought may challenge you and I
[1:09:23] know it is and I thank God for it
[1:09:25] because it challenges me on a daily
[1:09:28] level.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; God never said,
[1:09:35] "I want you to do this and that."
[1:09:40] God never told Abraham to believe him.
[1:09:45] No, but then we we'll become that when
[1:09:47] we believe.
[1:09:49] Well, that's not what God said.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; God did not say, Abraham, Abraham, when
[1:09:56] you believe me, you will be a father of
[1:09:58] men and nations.
[1:10:00] Because if believing
[1:10:03] is
[1:10:04] if we have to believe to become
[1:10:10] then that's a condition.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said there's no strings
[1:10:15] tied. There's no condition. It's totally
[1:10:18] 100% unconditional. So not even
[1:10:21] Abraham's belief
[1:10:24] was going to bring this to pass. That's
[1:10:26] right. Now, I don't know where you live,
[1:10:28] but I know where I live, right? And
[1:10:31] sometimes I I feel like in my own life
[1:10:35] that that things aren't happening
[1:10:36] because of my my lack of belief.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; But God never said, "The more you
[1:10:44] believe, the more I'll develop you."
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; God never said, "The more you believe,
[1:10:50] the more I'll bless you." The blessing
[1:10:52] that God said to Abraham was
[1:10:54] unconditional. God said, "I will bless
[1:10:56] thee." He never said, "I will bless thee
[1:10:58] when."
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He never said, "I'll bless you when you
[1:11:01] pay tithes." He never said, "I'll bless
[1:11:04] you when to come to church." He never
[1:11:06] said, "When I'll bless you when you
[1:11:07] shake the pastor's hand." He never He
[1:11:09] never put a condition on it. It was
[1:11:11] totally 100% unconditional that Abraham
[1:11:16] was blessed before he was blessed.
[1:11:27] So what could Abraham do
[1:11:31] to become
[1:11:34] what he was?
[1:11:39] [snorts]
[1:11:42] It's it's bizarre, isn't it? Like what
[1:11:45] what can you do to become what God has
[1:11:48] told you you are?
[1:11:53] Like God has said, you're the per
[1:11:55] perfect, virtuous, sinless,
[1:11:56] unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ, and
[1:11:59] then you go out and try and be it.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know how you work because I work
[1:12:06] the same.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; What can you do
[1:12:13] to make yourself what God has said you
[1:12:16] are? Yeah.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Well, but Dan, the the the see the
[1:12:19] secret to this, brother Dan, is that God
[1:12:21] came to Abraham after the sign of
[1:12:24] circumcision.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Well, no, he didn't.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; God come to Abram when he was Abraham
[1:12:31] was Abram.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; God come God told Abram who he was
[1:12:37] before he received the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Which means the sign of circumcision
[1:12:46] didn't make Abraham a father of many
[1:12:49] nations.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Which means that Abraham's name change
[1:12:52] didn't make Abraham the father of many
[1:12:55] nations.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; So what can you do? What can I do? Come
[1:13:05] on. There should be something that we
[1:13:08] have to do with this. Right? This was
[1:13:09] Israel's greatest mistake. They wanted
[1:13:12] to put their hand to the wheel.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; They wanted something to do for
[1:13:16] themselves to to satisfy a a pride.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; So, what can you do, bride?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; To be who God says you are.
[1:13:34] [laughter]
[1:13:36] It's a little bit controversial.
[1:13:38] Maybe it's not so much for you. Maybe
[1:13:41] it's more controversial for the older
[1:13:43] ones because of what we've come up
[1:13:46] through.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; But you have older parents.
[1:13:57] What can you be? What can you do to make
[1:14:00] you who you God has said you are?
[1:14:05] God never said to Abram, "If you do this
[1:14:08] and that, you'll become this
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; because it's unconditional."
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] Abraham
[1:14:28] became a father of many nations
[1:14:32] because Abraham was a father of many
[1:14:35] nations before Abraham was a father of
[1:14:38] many nations.
[1:14:41] [laughter]
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think I'm crazy.
[1:14:54] So, how did God want Abraham to approach
[1:14:57] life?
[1:15:00] Through the revelation of what he was,
[1:15:06] not what he was going when when I do
[1:15:08] this, I'll be that. Once I have Isaac,
[1:15:12] then then then I'll be.
[1:15:16] How does God want you to approach life?
[1:15:23] Through the revelation
[1:15:25] [clears throat]
[1:15:26] of who you are.
[1:15:29] Through the word of the Lord for your
[1:15:32] day. What has he called you?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; I need to move quicker. Am I going
[1:15:44] backwards? I am going backwards.
[1:15:50] We looked at this one. So, let's look at
[1:15:52] the same line of thought. What What
[1:15:56] could Gideon do
[1:15:59] to become what God said he was?
[1:16:03] Well, Dan, he had to fight a fight. Did
[1:16:06] he?
[1:16:09] Yeah, that's beautiful
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; because God come to him before he
[1:16:14] fortified.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; God come to Gideon be when he was
[1:16:18] overcome with fear.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; God didn't come to Gideon when Gideon
[1:16:23] was polishing his shield, oiling his
[1:16:26] boots, or sharpening his sword.
[1:16:30] God come to Gideon
[1:16:34] be when Gideon
[1:16:36] was threshing wheat hiding from the
[1:16:39] Midianites.
[1:16:42] When Gideon was overcome in fear, Gideon
[1:16:46] didn't have a reputation of a warrior.
[1:16:52] Abraham didn't have a reputation of
[1:16:54] being a father.
[1:16:57] But God came and said, "You are."
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Gideon didn't have a reputation. His
[1:17:03] father probably didn't have a reputation
[1:17:05] of being a mighty man of valor.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; But God come and said he was.
[1:17:11] There was there was nothing in Gideon's
[1:17:14] life to testify that Gideon was a man of
[1:17:17] war.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; There was nothing in Abram's life to
[1:17:22] testify that he was a father. He didn't
[1:17:25] have a a a personal family tree. He
[1:17:28] didn't have children. He didn't have
[1:17:30] have, you know, pictures of of his sons
[1:17:33] and daughters around the room. He wasn't
[1:17:36] a father.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; There was nothing in a natural to
[1:17:40] testify of who Abram was.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; What God said he was.
[1:17:48] And when I heard the message of the
[1:17:50] hour, when you first heard the message
[1:17:52] of the hour, and when that message
[1:17:54] called you bride, there may have been
[1:17:57] nothing in your life. There was nothing
[1:17:59] in your life that testified of who you
[1:18:02] were.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; But God said you are.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; So this story of Gideon here proves that
[1:18:13] God can look past the current
[1:18:15] conditions.
[1:18:17] God can look beyond history.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Because why? God can look into eternity.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; All right? God is not looking at the
[1:18:28] external.
[1:18:32] God is looking at the seed.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; God is looking at what he predestinated.
[1:18:41] And when God come down to Gideon, Gide
[1:18:44] God wasn't talking to the outer man. God
[1:18:47] was talking to the inner man cuz there
[1:18:49] was an inner man in Gideon that Gideon
[1:18:52] knew nothing about.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's the same thing when
[1:18:55] you heard the message of the hour. There
[1:18:58] the there's an inner person within you.
[1:19:01] There's the seed of the most high.
[1:19:03] There's the royal seed that is within
[1:19:05] you. And it's he that he's talking to.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Because that seed is that word.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; when Gideon said, "Thou sorry." When the
[1:19:18] Lord said, "Thou mighty man of valor,"
[1:19:21] that seed
[1:19:23] was that word.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And Gideon was that word.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's why there's a there's a seed
[1:19:36] within you. There's a there's a there's
[1:19:38] a bride seed that was in you. We know
[1:19:41] it's the royal seed, but it's the it's
[1:19:43] the feminine part of Christ.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; And the word that has come is speaking
[1:19:50] to that seed and causes a reaction
[1:19:53] within that seed. A reaction that this
[1:19:56] body can't produce for itself.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] What could Gideon do
[1:20:11] to become what he was?
[1:20:14] Well, Banny, in order for him to be who
[1:20:17] he was, he had to go to church and he
[1:20:20] had to pay tithes.
[1:20:23] Really?
[1:20:25] Because when I read that,
[1:20:27] I see no conditions. Yeah,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I just see God revealing Gideon as a
[1:20:37] mighty man [clears throat] of valor.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And you know what's after that? Full
[1:20:42] stop.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Not if, when,
[1:20:48] one day.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; This was thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:21:00] Thi this was Gideon
[1:21:03] and we have received thus sayaith the
[1:21:05] Lord.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; The message
[1:21:18] calls you bride
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; before the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:26] Now, if you want a quote to back that
[1:21:27] up, Brother Brennan says you you you
[1:21:29] were the new
[1:21:33] re being reborn doesn't make you seed.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; The reason you can be reborn or born
[1:21:43] again is because you
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; are seed,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; not will be,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; you are.
[1:21:51] So the things that God does in your life
[1:21:54] are the result of what you are. The the
[1:21:56] message of the hour doesn't make you
[1:21:58] bride. Believing this message
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; does not make you bride.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; It does not make you bride. Otherwise
[1:22:06] you Gideon, thou art a mighty man of
[1:22:08] valor if you believe me. Believing this
[1:22:11] message doesn't make you bride.
[1:22:12] Believing this message come to reveal
[1:22:15] you as bride.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:21] When you are overcome with fear,
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; I'm stopping because I need to get
[1:22:33] through it.
[1:22:39] Okay, let's go get down to a little bit
[1:22:41] of a nitty-gritty and maybe some little
[1:22:43] tender points that you might go home and
[1:22:45] tell your pastors or mom and dad about.
[1:22:47] But
[1:22:49] when you stopped cutting your hair,
[1:22:51] sisters,
[1:22:53] it didn't make you bright.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, "Gideon, thou art a
[1:23:00] mighty man of valor if you refrain from
[1:23:03] wearing shorts."
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, "Sisters, thou art a
[1:23:11] mighty sister of valor. If you stop
[1:23:14] cutting your hair,
[1:23:19] It doesn't say Gideon, thou art a mighty
[1:23:21] man of valor. Thou wil be a mighty man
[1:23:24] of valor when you start paying tithes.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Because there is no strings attached.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; The problem is we attach strings.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; We absolutely 100% do. Yeah.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Let me let me ask you a question here.
[1:23:50] Do overcomers overcome?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you another question. How do
[1:24:02] you become an overcomer if you're not an
[1:24:04] overcomer?
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:24:10] It's like saying to me h to me like how
[1:24:14] how do how do I become a man if I'm not
[1:24:19] a man?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Well, the reason I'm a man is because
[1:24:22] I'm a man.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; So, do
[1:24:30] do overcomers overcome
[1:24:33] or is it when you overcome you become an
[1:24:36] overcomer?
[1:24:41] Because I don't know how you overcome if
[1:24:44] you're not an overcomer.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Overcoming doesn't make you an
[1:24:52] overcomer. Yeah.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; It's like saying here
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; did Gideon become a mighty man of valor
[1:25:04] when he fought his first fight
[1:25:07] and won? He had to win.
[1:25:13] There's my time. I'll just push restart
[1:25:16] another 45 minutes.
[1:25:20] You understand what I mean? Because this
[1:25:22] is not conditional and this is what the
[1:25:24] message of the outcome come to do the
[1:25:26] the who who is the overcomer.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; She is the overcomer. When do you become
[1:25:35] bride? You always have been. You've just
[1:25:38] been revealed as bride. And because you
[1:25:41] are bride, you are an overcomer.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; But the the problem with me, okay, I
[1:25:47] don't know about you. The problem with
[1:25:48] me is my thinking. Yes.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; The problem with me is when, you know,
[1:25:53] in order for me to sit with him in his
[1:25:57] throne with him, you know, I've I've got
[1:25:59] to I've got to overcome.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I've got to I've anyone who sits there
[1:26:05] has got to be an overcomer.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you this. Who sits with
[1:26:10] the groom?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you have the Bible on there
[1:26:18] that you can bring up on here?
[1:26:20] Revelations 3 21 or 22
[1:26:25] to let me get it for you because this is
[1:26:29] this is amazing and this is worth
[1:26:32] another 5 minutes.
[1:26:36] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[1:26:39] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:26:43] overcome over came and sat down with my
[1:26:48] father in his throne.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you is this a condition
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; to him that overcometh
[1:27:00] because if it's a condition the covenant
[1:27:02] is not unconditional.
[1:27:06] But that's how we read it
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; as a condition.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; But the key here is to him
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; and you can go through the message and
[1:27:18] study this out to him. Who who is him?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet come to say she is
[1:27:27] him [clears throat]
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; to him that overcomemeth. Who is him?
[1:27:32] She is him. him is the word.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; So, so Revelations 3:21 is not a
[1:27:39] condition
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:21 is a statement
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; of what you will do
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; because you are him,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; right? The bride is a part of him
[1:27:54] because you are a part of him.
[1:27:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:28:01] and forever. You are a part of him. He
[1:28:05] was an overcomer. He overcame because he
[1:28:09] was an overcomer.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; The same way the scripture says that I
[1:28:13] overcome, you will overcome. And he
[1:28:16] overcome by the faith or through the
[1:28:17] faith of who he was.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't have faith. And this is
[1:28:22] another problem with our thinking. Well,
[1:28:24] when I overcome, then I'll have faith to
[1:28:26] believe. No. Because you have faith, you
[1:28:29] are able to overcome. Yes.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; So, so this is really important because
[1:28:34] throughout the years this has been
[1:28:36] preached. This has been talked about,
[1:28:38] this has been read in your our own
[1:28:40] personal lives as a condition that the
[1:28:43] bride must meet in order to sit with him
[1:28:45] in in his throne. Do you know what that
[1:28:48] means?
[1:28:51] That means God's future is based upon
[1:28:54] our performance.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And it's totally wrong. Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; It's totally 100% wrong because our
[1:29:04] future, God's future, the groom's future
[1:29:07] is not dependent upon the bride's
[1:29:09] performance, but the bride's future is
[1:29:13] dependent upon the groom's performance.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Because it is the groom that reveals the
[1:29:18] bride. And when he reveals you to be the
[1:29:21] him, [clears throat]
[1:29:24] when he reveals the bride to be him,
[1:29:30] cuz that's what he's saying, right?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; When when the the message did more than
[1:29:35] identify you as a bride, you you need to
[1:29:37] break that down because the bride is a
[1:29:40] part of the groom. That's right.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; In that one word, you are word of his
[1:29:46] word.
[1:29:48] You are spirit of his spirit. You are
[1:29:51] life of his life. You are Hebrews 13:8.
[1:29:55] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:29:58] and forever. You are a part of him. The
[1:30:01] prophet would say the same word that
[1:30:03] applies to the groom
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; applies to the bride. Why? Because you
[1:30:08] are one.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So, what can you do
[1:30:15] to be an overcomer?
[1:30:22] Look, I tried it.
[1:30:25] It doesn't work.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I've told my story here before, but
[1:30:28] maybe not to this group, but you know,
[1:30:30] when I was married to my wife, had uh
[1:30:34] our young Christopher and and um I had a
[1:30:37] problem with television. Love
[1:30:39] television.
[1:30:42] get home from work, work a hard day, sit
[1:30:44] down in front of the television. My wife
[1:30:46] would get a bit frustrated, but she's
[1:30:48] long-suffering.
[1:30:50] Thank the Lord.
[1:30:53] And uh I knew it was a problem. I knew
[1:30:56] it was doing damage to the home. I knew
[1:30:59] it was doing damage to our relationship.
[1:31:00] So, after a long long long time, it was
[1:31:04] a television. You don't see them these
[1:31:05] days. It was about this big
[1:31:08] and about that deep. you know, the
[1:31:10] little heavy ones. You know, I pulled
[1:31:12] the cord out of the wall. I We lived in
[1:31:14] a house that was about this far off the
[1:31:16] ground. I put that thing above my head
[1:31:17] and I just threw it out the door. I just
[1:31:20] felt great. I thought, I've got this
[1:31:22] thing. I've overcome it.
[1:31:26] Wow. There's another part of the story.
[1:31:30] Two, not even two weeks later, I had an
[1:31:33] LG screen.
[1:31:35] It was this big and this high with
[1:31:38] surround sound.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; The picture was crisper. The other one
[1:31:43] was like snowflakes.
[1:31:45] It was It was bigger. It was better.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I was trying to overcome.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; I was trying to be an overcomer by
[1:31:53] overcoming. [snorts]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; But God said I'm an overcomer.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And if I'm an overcomer,
[1:32:02] [snorts] well, guess what? That's what I
[1:32:05] am. That's what I'll produce.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; It's not something I have to try to be.
[1:32:10] What What does a father have?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Children,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; right? What did Abraham have? Children.
[1:32:17] What What did What does a mighty man of
[1:32:20] valor do? Win battles.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Right. [laughter] What does an overcomer
[1:32:25] do? Overcomes.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Because of who I am. So our our
[1:32:31] approach to life in our approach to our
[1:32:34] time in this life is through the
[1:32:38] revelation of the word.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; That I I actually am the word.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I want to say this as I close that we
[1:32:48] have more than thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; We say brother Dan, how can you have
[1:32:53] more than that? Okay.
[1:32:57] The only way that you can have more than
[1:32:59] thus sayeth the Lord is if you are thus
[1:33:02] sayeth the Lord
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; because you can carry carry thus sayeth
[1:33:07] the Lord around
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; but not have the revelation of it. But
[1:33:11] God wants you to have more than thus
[1:33:13] sayeth the Lord. God wants you to
[1:33:15] recognize that you are thus sayeth the
[1:33:17] Lord. That you are Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:20] yesterday, today and forever. That you
[1:33:22] are the word. That you are spirit of his
[1:33:24] spirit and life of his life. that you
[1:33:26] are his his bride.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And because you're his bride, you can
[1:33:32] add a list of attributes
[1:33:34] of the bride.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And you know what they'll be like?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; His
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; because her attributes are the same as
[1:33:44] his attributes because she is a part of
[1:33:47] him.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; How did he didn't over he didn't
[1:33:50] overcome
[1:33:52] uh he didn't become an overcomer when he
[1:33:54] overcame.
[1:33:56] The reason he overcame was because he
[1:33:58] was an overcomer.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even but even even Jesus as as
[1:34:04] the lamb of God, he didn't become the
[1:34:06] lamb of God when he submitted himself
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; to the will of the father. He was the
[1:34:12] lamb of God. Therefore, he submitted
[1:34:15] himself to the will of the father. Now,
[1:34:17] I need to probably just add this in
[1:34:19] there when we're talking about hair and
[1:34:21] and those different things. The reason
[1:34:24] you believe is because of who you are.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; The reason you stop
[1:34:31] doing what the world does is because of
[1:34:35] who you are.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make you who you are. It's
[1:34:39] because of who you are.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; All right? So, so it it's not okay. It's
[1:34:45] not God doesn't want you to cut your
[1:34:47] hair.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; But just to stop cutting your hair
[1:34:50] doesn't make you bride. That's a false
[1:34:52] security.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; God wants you to recognize who you are
[1:34:57] and therefore and as a result of who you
[1:35:00] are, he asks you to do certain things
[1:35:03] and you do it because of who you are,
[1:35:06] not trying to be who you who God wants
[1:35:09] you to be.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Because that's what we've done for too
[1:35:12] long in the message. We've tried to do
[1:35:15] things to to try and justify to
[1:35:18] ourselves who we are, that we are the
[1:35:21] word. Well, look at me. Look what church
[1:35:23] I go to. I don't do this. I don't do
[1:35:25] that. I do do this. I do do that. But
[1:35:26] what's that got to do with it?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; So, what?
[1:35:36] Let me go back now. I can go back. Huh?
[1:35:41] becoming
[1:35:43] what you are.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Becoming what you are a as a as a young
[1:35:54] ladies and young men. You overcome as
[1:35:57] young ladies and young men.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; As as a older man, I overcome as an
[1:36:04] older man. I I have the same struggles
[1:36:07] that perhaps some of you do, but I have
[1:36:10] different struggles, too.
[1:36:13] Right? So, this is what we're doing.
[1:36:14] We're we're becoming
[1:36:17] what we are.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to make oursel
[1:36:20] anything.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You're just becoming what you are.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; And what you are
[1:36:26] is thus sayeth the Lord. [laughter]
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; If you have any questions, then you can
[1:36:38] ask brother Elgre.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; That was speaking our language. I just
[1:36:52] love it so much. Amen. Such a very very
[1:36:55] important principle. And the what is
[1:36:58] really hard with this thing is language
[1:37:01] trips you up because it's very hard to
[1:37:05] express this principle. But you know
[1:37:08] it's it's like that example that I used
[1:37:10] on on Wednesday night. Um, for those of
[1:37:12] you who were not here, um, Brother
[1:37:13] Brandham was speaking to that man who
[1:37:15] was battling with cigarettes
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; and and he was saying, I if I could just
[1:37:20] get rid of the cigarettes. And brother
[1:37:21] Brandham said to him, forget about the
[1:37:23] cigarettes,
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; but I but I wish I could just get rid of
[1:37:26] these cigarettes. He said, well, forget
[1:37:27] about the cigarettes. That's not the
[1:37:29] thing we must focus on. If we just let
[1:37:32] God reveal to us who we are, then we
[1:37:35] will start overcome.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and that's as simple as it is.
[1:37:40] And that really when if everything is
[1:37:42] said and done, that boils down to that
[1:37:45] revelation under the eagle anointing.
[1:37:48] When this bride knows who she is,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; the rapture will go because then nothing
[1:37:53] stands in our way because we believe
[1:37:55] we're overcomers. We believe we're part
[1:37:57] of the rapture. We believe that there's
[1:37:59] nothing Satan can do that can stop us.
[1:38:03] Even when we make mistakes,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter because we're
[1:38:07] overcomers.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's so good. I love it. Can the
[1:38:11] musicians come? Let's uh I'll kick us
[1:38:13] off with a song, Judah, and then you can
[1:38:16] can come back with another one. Let's
[1:38:18] give our young musicians a challenge
[1:38:20] tonight.
[1:38:27] Song with no chords.
[1:38:30] Yay.
[1:38:33] This was one of Michael's songs.
[1:38:38] Let's stand together.
[1:38:52] I am the righteousness of [music] God in
[1:38:55] Christ, a brand new [singing] creation
[1:38:58] in him.
[1:39:00] I [music] can now approach the presence
[1:39:02] [singing] of God with no condemnation of
[1:39:06] sin.
[1:39:09] I am the righteousness of
[1:39:10] [singing and music] God in Christ. I am
[1:39:13] now complete in him.
[1:39:16] [music] I'm a partaker [singing]
[1:39:18] of his divine nature. On me will not in
[1:39:22] good sin.
[1:39:27] I have been crucified [music] with
[1:39:30] Christ. Crucified and buried with thee.
[1:39:33] [singing]
[1:39:35] We are one with him [music] in
[1:39:37] righteousness after we became one.
[1:39:40] [singing]
[1:39:44] He became [music] as we were
[1:39:47] that we might be as [singing] he is now.
[1:39:51] He became one [music] with us.
[1:39:55] He became [singing] one life with me. I
[1:39:58] am the [music] I am the righteousness of
[1:40:01] God in Christ
[1:40:04] creation.
[1:40:07] I can
[1:40:09] present. [music and singing]
[1:40:15] I am [music] the righteousness of God.
[1:40:25] [singing and music]
[1:40:29] And I am
[1:40:31] I [music] am the righteousness [singing]
[1:40:33] of God.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing]
[1:40:45] [music]
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I am a complete me.
[1:40:55] I'm a partaker [music and singing] of
[1:40:57] his divine nature for me not.
[1:41:04] Amen. I'll kick you off on this one,
[1:41:06] Judah. Then you can come take over. In
[1:41:08] fact, let's just close in a word of
[1:41:09] prayer. All of you are welcome to come
[1:41:11] across the road and um have a [music]
[1:41:13] few nibbles with us and have some
[1:41:15] fellowship. Let's just say
[1:41:19] thank you to the Lord. Thank you,
[1:41:20] precious heavenly father. We are so
[1:41:23] privileged to have been here, Lord. Oh
[1:41:25] father, we are so privileged to live in
[1:41:27] this day, Father. We you're giving us a
[1:41:30] perspective that no other church agents
[1:41:32] [music] had, Lord. Father, the best they
[1:41:35] could come up with was making grace a
[1:41:37] disgrace, Father. Lord Jesus, but in
[1:41:40] this day, you've revealed to us, Lord.
[1:41:42] We're justified. We've never done it in
[1:41:44] the first place, Lord. Because it's not
[1:41:46] even in your memory, Father, anything
[1:41:47] that we do wrong, Father. All that is in
[1:41:50] your memory is that we're [music]
[1:41:51] overcomers, Lord. That we mighty sons of
[1:41:54] valors. Oh, Father, that we are loved of
[1:41:58] you. Oh, Father, that we are like David,
[1:42:00] a man after your own heart, Father.
[1:42:02] Those are the things that you see about
[1:42:04] us, Lord. Oh, Father. And we, Lord, we
[1:42:08] cannot help but walk into that, Lord. We
[1:42:10] cannot help but being overcomers, Lord
[1:42:12] Jesus, because that's what you said
[1:42:14] about us always, Father.
[1:42:17] Oh Lord, [music] thank you, Lord. I pray
[1:42:19] you'll make this real to each one of us,
[1:42:21] Lord. I pray that you will bless Brother
[1:42:23] Daniel, Lord. I pray that you will
[1:42:24] strengthen him for the weekend, Lord
[1:42:27] Jesus. I pray that you'll give him
[1:42:28] strength [music] in his body, in his
[1:42:29] voice, Lord Jesus, that he will step by
[1:42:33] step be led of your Holy Spirit, [music]
[1:42:35] Father. Oh Lord, but there's no use if
[1:42:38] the preacher comes, but we're not ready,
[1:42:40] Lord. I pray that each one that will
[1:42:42] come will be ready to receive, Father.
[1:42:44] God, we commit this weekend
[1:42:47] into your hands, the rest of it, Lord,
[1:42:49] and pray that you will have your way
[1:42:51] with us, Lord. We ask it in the precious
[1:42:54] name of our Lord Jesus [music] Christ.
[1:42:56] Amen. Amen. Thank you also to those who
[1:42:59] came from afar. Amen. The word is
[1:43:02] working.
