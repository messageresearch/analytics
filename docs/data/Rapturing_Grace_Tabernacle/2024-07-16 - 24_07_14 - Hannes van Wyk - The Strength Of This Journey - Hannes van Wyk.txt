before service and just really appreciate their musicians just thank the Lord let's just give them a hand for a moment I know that there's a lot of time that that goes into uh practicing and and surrendering those gifts to the Lord and just really appreciate that and thank you for the for the song item this was actually sister Julie song item I understand she initiated and orchestrated it so thank you very much that was very very special so this morning we are thankful to to be here together and we uh we have the privilege to have a whole bunch of visitors different ones and a whole group from Australia sister Kathy's family so sister Fleer and and all yours I don't know all the names because there's some extras now since since what I've met last time but God bless you you all welcome trust that you'll enjoy the time with us I assume you're here for for the big birthdays so enjoy the time with us praise the Lord um also sister Ila and brother hanis welcome God bless you also the family L and um also shandre and the young ones may the Lord bless you Quin is is not here he's um in the motel room not not very well um so we just want to lift him up before the Lord also but um it's good to be here and I trust that we'll have a blessed time with brother Hanes um it's been I checked it was September last year that he was here so so not quite a year ago and um we uh we have the privilege to have him here again this morning um he he preached a wonderful wonderful youth service on Friday night and there was um just specific things that was just um really stand out to me and I hope you don't mind but I just want to mention a couple of things he he preached on the power of decision and he made a statement that that I never heard in that way but it's so true he said when you need to make a choice you have complete free moral agency right so you can choose freely but once you've made the choice you surrender that that control so that's really good once you've made a choice then the consequences of that choice and the after effects and how it affects other people and the responses and the long-term impact of that you can't control that anymore now you've made the choice and and that's so so so important that we recognize the importance of choices um also um he made the statement then and it sounds contradictory but it's not says when you recognize that you've made the wrong choices don't be prideful and bold and just keep on Motoring in the same way amen be humble enough to recognize that's a wrong choice and say that was a wrong choice and ask God to forgive you and then make a right choice and go in a different direction you know you might still have some of those consequences but then at least from that point onwards go in the right direction otherwise you just keep on you know like a bul a china shop just go in the One Direction so really good really uh really appreciated that and I'm looking forward to What the Lord Has for us through our brother this morning and I trust that we come with expecting hearts and with their with their cups held out to receive from the Lord um I just just to kind of keep you in the loop um this is this is not something that that I'm really uh excited or interested in but um I shared a month or two ago I I just felt in my heart um brother shabaz from Pakistan asked me to to take a service for them and he again couple days ago asked me if I would do a youth service so this morning at 3:00 a.m. um I preached the youth service had to W out to the office in the ice cold weather which which was a bit of a sacrifice but we had a wonderful time in the Lord and just just really appreciate the the Lord coming on the scene but you know I I don't know for me there's there's few things as wonderful as when you're preaching something and the Lord actually reveals it you while you're while you're preaching it and I I think I enjoyed it more than them so it was it was pretty good it was definitely worth it um just just real special um we have a few prayer requests that I just want to share and then we'll we'll stand and we'll take those needs to the Lord um sister Jael asked that we pray for her she says she's been sick on and off and she would get better for a few days and then she would just get sick again and she's just really sick and tired of it um and ask that we that we take her before the Lord also uh many of you would have seen that request from Brother how this morning for sister Katherine She's suffering with with cold or flu like symptoms and also her brother Skippy which I think most of us have have met he's been here to church a few times um he fell through his Ranch slider and got cut up a little bit um and he's now in in base hospital so we want to bring them before the Lord and also remember brother quentis sister ilza has been been ill she looks like she's better this morning we're thankful for that but uh let's let's stand and then we take our needs before the Lord precious father Lord we are here together because of you father we can even face this day just because of you father oh Lord and we lift those songs of Zion before you oh Lord we worship you father we raised our hearts before you oh Lord it just struck me how song after song how he sang lord it's by Mercy alone lord it's by your grace alone that we that we are here father we have nothing to present to you but dirty Rags oh Lord but with those dirty rags we also present your blood father oh Lord and we are so thankful Lord for the work that you've done Lord for the sacrifice you made oh Lord Jesus and that you made your life available to us father we are so thankful this morning Lord and it's with that same blood that we come and plead for Mercy for our needs oh Father you've you've made those those resources available to us Lord Lord and but it's not only that um that it's a if if we need it father you want us to ask Lord father it's your business Lord to to reveal your attributes to us Lord and this morning Father we have many needs Among Us father many who are sick and not not doing well father and we just pray father that your Holy Spirit Lord will anoint that promises to us father that that you will anoint that word to us and father that you'll make it aive pray father that in faith we can move forward and testify and confess Lord and know assuredly Lord with that substance Faith Lord that you've touched us that you've changed circumstances Lord and even when we don't see the symptoms change father that we can know father that you've heard us and that you're in control and that you will will manifest it in your appointed time father we we lift all the requests spoken and unspoken before you this morning we dedicate this service to you oh father thank you for being here Lord we pray that your holy spirit will be in full control Lord I Lift brother hannus before you and pray that you will use him for your glory oh Father help us to to be fresh and to have Open Hearts and to receive what you have we ask it in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so as brother Hannas comes let's let sing Reach Out And Touch the Lord re CH and touch the Lord as he passes by you will find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry [Music] to and touch the Lord as he passes [Music] by amen I trust that's our desire this morning that we can reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by because we know certainly that God is more than able to help us to bless us and to give us the grace that we need every day of our lives and just to know that we live by his will by his desire we are here this morning because he has called us to gather under that mighty name we have sung the most beautiful songs of Zion and create the right atmosphere therefore we come now with our cups lifted up say Lord fill me this morning help me give me the grace that I need and just the guide guidance answer my questions heal my sick body and uh give me direction in life that's the purpose and I believe God is the same yesterday today and forever and certainly we trust that the Lord knows our hearts and he understands what we need because he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's why we don't depend upon man we don't trust man's ability because man has proven to us time and time again again that uh we are failures but we look to the Lord Jesus Christ to say through our weaknesses he can become strong through our failings you know he can raise us up and make us stronger and give us the grace that we need this morning and uh that is our desire and that is why we come this morning as I greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we are certainly happy to be with you all and wonderful to be back here again and under the kind hospitality of our precious brother Al and sister p and taking good care of us and always wonderful to come and see the precious Saints the faces and uh we pray that the meeting this morning will not be in vain it has never been in vain you know the Lord has never failed us and uh we trust that he will add some value to our lives we give us um a Clarity of where we come from where are we going and um just be gracious to us this morning he's my prayer and desire and I'm happy to be with my precious wife sister Ila my family my children my grandchildren you know uh we've got only two weeks left then we will be going back but it has been a good time with them and we thank the Lord for the wonderful wonderful privilege we have to come and visit them and just spend time with them so may God bless you may God bless every song every item it was beautiful we really enjoyed it it's good to come into the house of the Lord uh to sing these kind of songs with from our hearts because it means something and it's not just words but there's an expression an expression of Love by God's grace amen thank you to the Musicians let us turn in our Bibles to Job chapter 7 from verse 17 job 7 from: 17 to 18 my title this morning I would love to call it the strength for this journey strength for this journey we are really on a journey a journey of life and life has got um you know things happen in life and the journey means that we are moving from one point to another point and as we journey you know there's not a stagnant position things change things go different directions um when you start this journey you know you maybe have got a an idea where you're going to end up and how life is going to treat you but after years and years you start to realize you know what you could have never planned it you could have never directed it the way that God planned it and we trust uh that we can depend and trust the Lord when he says the footsteps of the righteous are for ordained and that God leads us in very specific directions Job chapter 7 from verse 17 amen job 7 from: 17 what is man that thou should us Magnify Him and that thou should us set thine heart upon Him Verse 18 and that thou should us visit him every morning and try him every moment what a good question who am I Lord that you think about me that you should magnify me uh that you know you set your heart upon me that you should visit me every morning and try him every moment amen let's bow our heads again father as we bow this morning in your wonderful presence we are so blessed oh God to come and to call upon thy mighty name and to know Lord Jesus where two or three are gathered they will be in our midst We Trust and Believe oh Father God that you can take these words that you will Quicken it oh Father God and break the bread of life to everyone that's present here even those that are listening on the live stream oh Father God may you reach out to them as well and bless them oh Father God with their portion we commit the meeting to thee father I pray that every word that will be said will be seasoned with thy love and grace that thy holy spirit will take control of everyone present here that you will move from person to person oh God and that you will oh God set the captive free and let us be at Liberty this morning to worship you in spirit and in truth oh Father we commit ourselves to thee oh Father God praying thy blessing upon the service upon the words upon Thy Word in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen you may take your seats this morning amen certainly wonderful to be back in um Stratford again you know the place never ceased to amaze me last time I was here it was snow it was wind it was rain this time I was prepared for that and there was no snow no wind no rain so we are ready for whatever it brings but it's wonderful and we are thankful for the grace that God gives us and that he helps us in this way job chap 10:2 as well Job chapter 10 vers2 the word says thou has granted me life and favor and thy visitation has preserved my spirit so once we start to understand that we need strength to carry on in this journey we are in a journey when you came and the Lord called you your journey started and you your your life got a new Direction you know and things started to change around you and and um there there is really no control that you had once you gave your life to Jesus Christ he took it and he started to direct the conditions and circumstances around your life and in this journey many times you'll come to a point where you need where you need what we would call a strengthening a visitation God would not just call you and then leave you one side and say okay let's see who's the strongest who can make it let me see how much you can endure let me see that's not God's purpose God's purpose always was that in this journey at certain points and times in your life he will come with visitations and that visitation as job says here you know it it preserves my spirit because God wants to preserve you which means he wants to protect you which means he wants you to last this whole journey that his purpose is not to destroy you halfway because if you are called by God and your name has been placed in the Lamb's Book of Life God is obligated and he will look after you he will take care of you doesn't matter what life brings your way God Will Make A Way of Escape for you so the purpose of God's uh strength visitation he says thy visitation has revived my spirit so it is to preserve it is to revive it is to restore it is is to activate me into my position because as we sit here this morning every one of us has got a position in the body of Christ you have got a a a you've got a part to play you know there's really no Spectators in the plan of God yeah you are sitting in the Pew and I'm preaching but we all partaking we've all got some role to play you know at some point this morning it was my lot by the predestinated mind of God to come and stand here this morning before you and his play this thought on my heart and your your you've also got a part to play because the real coming to together is that God can impart and activate you that you find your place your position and that you can understand that Lord Jesus I am not just I'm not just a spectator I'm really a participant in the plan and program of the Living God I can be a singer I can be a musician I can be a lay member it doesn't matter but there is a purpose for me to be here and I'm proud and honored to be called to sit in the PE and say Amen Lord I believe it and I thank you for your word so it's why we come to church it is a there's a reason behind it we don't come to church because you know it becomes a tradition or you know somebody said I must do it or I'm forced to do it but we we come to church to be seated together in Heavenly places we come together to look at one another and understand where we come from because God has called everyone as an individual and he calls us different one from the other one you know we might even look at the word from different ways but we're looking at the same word and therefore we believe as the prophet says when God poured out the Holy Spirit he gave each one of us a portion you don't have the fullness amen so what does it mean the prophet says you can he gave us each one a portion he says that's why when we come together on a Sunday morning I bring my portion but I'm not complete but as soon as I look at my brother my sister here I see another portion and now my little portion has now growing in stature and in magnitude and in strength and it becomes a stronger portion and that's why I need you to be here so that we together can worship God he says that brings the supernatural presence of God back in the church again when we come on a Sunday morning and you bring your little leak of fire and I bring mine he says the Supernatural is present every me eating you might not see it but when I see you I see the supernatural presence and then we know all things become possible because you are here if you are not here we cannot do anything but with your presence here bringing the leak of fire that's why we don't look at one another's flesh I'm not interested in your flesh you know some of us got big beards some of us got no beards some got this some has got that some are white some are black some are purple you know we are different but we look beyond that and what we see behind that there there's a little leak of fire and when I see that it excites me to know Lord I have arrived and I'm sitting in Heavenly places father I don't care how they think or what they do if I see the pillar of fire I am happy I'm in Heavenly places but many times we come and we want everybody to look the same yes if I've got a certain style or something like that I want everybody to follow my style then we are happy then we are then we in Heavenly places are we United that's not God's uniting power God's uniting power is the Holy Ghost inside of you so the church you know I believe a mature Church look beyond that outer shell that badges skins you know which is nothing to be desired but what we desire is the holy ghost in your life because when we see that we are excited and we're happy to worship God together and that's the True Church of the Living God now remember for God's visitations and God coming on the scene there's always a time element to it God doesn't do anything haphazardly nothing everything God does has got a time element you know there there's a purpose behind it and that time element comes forward we've got a natural time and we've got a god time a Kronos time and a chyos time so a Kronos time is we have to be at 9:00 we have to do things at 10: we have to be at work Monday morning 7:00 but a kyos Time mean a Due Time a fixed time a season an opportune time is God's time so God has got a certain time and we've got a certain time element and they are completely different God has got a time for you to be born again that's God's time that's an opportune time that's his time is's God you know we can say man it must happen at that age or it must happen at that age that's got nothing to do with it it's God says that's the time I've got for you it is the time that you will be born again and nothing can move you before that time amen you can talk until you blew but until God's chyos time comes on the scene then that seeds get activated and there is a purpose in life and you can just find it because God has got a Time Jeremiah 2911 says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you say of the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end a chyos Time an appointed time God's thoughts to you is a certain thought to bring you to an expected end God's God's not the author of confusion because the footsteps of the righteous are for end of the Lord now if we let's take an example let's go to acts 12:1 and we want to see you know God has got a way to do things and and many times we get confused because we're trying to understand God from our mind you can never understand God and the purpose of God and how God does things from here and and and and we need to move from here to Revelation to trust the Lord explicitly with every fiber of your body as the church move towards the Rapture we're going to need to trust him 100% not from our mind because you will see things which will not make sense you will see things like that let's take an example acts 12:1 now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to Vex certain of the church now the church starts they are powerful they are so happy you know when God starts a new move everybody is excited everybody's happy it is so wonderful you know and here Herod looks at it and he started to stretch forth his hand to Vex certain of the church verse two and he killed James the brother of John with the sword so here is the first sort of casualty of a believer that an unbeliever could reach out take a sword and he slays him finish gone dead verse three and because he saw it pleased the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also so what do we see here he was a man pleaser when he did the First Act he was inspired to kill him and now he says the church now rejoices and when when the church when he sees that the church really likes it now he also says okay let's take the next one let's take pet because he wants to please the crowd and remember we as children of God we are not crowd Pleasers we're not here to please the crowd we are not that That's what Satan wants to do because he wants to please the crowd because when you please the flesh you will have a magnitude of people around it amen because he saw it pleased the Jews he proceed further to take Peter also then were the days of the unleavened bread when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to to four quadr of soldiers to keep him intending off the Easter to bring him forth to the people Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without seizing of the church unto God for him all right so here the scenario is clear the first one is killed James is killed now Peter is locked up but because it was Easter he says I can't kill a brother on Easter I'll kill him after Easter you know many times we think like that you know I come to church I'll just put my weapons away but Monday I'll take them up again well the war will rage again while we come to church God bless you brother God bless you Sister how are you this morning you know but Monday morning it's full on war again it's the same attitude we just put the weapons away that we should never be like that you should always be the mature Christian to say Lord let me be the one that breaks the cycle let me be the least I will do it oh Father God it doesn't matter who does it but now he's locked up he's in the church but now the church start to pray amen they without ceasing verse 6 and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison now notice he was sleeping can you imagine being locked up in prison between 16 gods in the middle of the prison chains and you sleeping I mean I would say you should be be praying but he knew the church was praying so if the church is praying I'm not going to pray because I know their prayer will sustain me there is people that will carry me when I'm weak when I'm low when I'm in that position that's how we want the Church of the Living God that when I'm in trouble you know I will know there's people that will back me right till the end they will pray for me that I can sleep in my troubles he was sleeping and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and and a light shined in the prison and he smot Peter on the sight Peter was in such a deep sleep when that angel came as a light he had to kick him yes that's the kind of sleep that the believer should sleep because you not alone you've got a family you're not alone you are part of the many membered body of the Lord Jesus Christ you can never fight this battle alone you can never have Victory alone you need me I need you and the angels smoted Peter on the side and he raised up saying arise up quickly and his change fell over from his hands and the angel said unto him G thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did so look at the angel the angel was in no hurry you know if you were in the prison there and you would see an angel wake you up and the change starting to fall I know what I would do I would run for That Door full speed but the angel said to Peter slow down we I know how we you know I'm in control of the situation that's why the prophet says if you know God is on the scene slow down take a deep breath and say Lord Jesus let me follow the footsteps of God let me not oh Father God get excited but let me look at it Lord and let me just take a deep breath and follow father God slowly because nothing is going to happen my running is not going to change he said to him you're not leaving any anything behind your sandals put it on and he waited your garments put it on and he waited until the man was fully dressed and so and he said follow me they were not running they were walking and as he walked the Bible says and the angel said unto him G thyself bind on thy sandals and so he did and he said unto them cast thy garment about thee and follow me don't take it in your hand dress yourself fully we've got time I'm in control yeah I am God sent I am here and I'm going to deliver you that's what I want to say to you if you trust the Lord and you've got a problem look at him and say Lord God I believe that you're going to do the perfect the impossible for me and he went out and followed him and wished not that it was true it was done by the angel but he thought he saw a vision I mean even maybe thinking I'm Dreaming is this really true but it was not a dream it was not a vision it was real it was true and it was real to him and when they were past the first and second ward they came unto the Iron Gate that leadth unto the city which opened to them of its own accord they went out and passed on through one street and forth with and the angel departed from him just disappeared now the question I want to ask you is why was James killed and Peter saved part of the same church part of the elect part of the called out because I man it was always James Peter and John they were the sort of the main main members of the church if you wanted somebody done if you wanted prayer that's the man you go to when Jesus went in and he needed to raise a de or pray for somebody that was severe he took Peter James and John with him faith hope and love with him so how would God allow the one just to be slain like like like like it's nothing Bible just say Herod took the sword and he killed him God doesn't even write anything further God doesn't even give us the full story God doesn't you know tell us how this mighty man that followed him so truthfully how he died and how he believed God just put it plain and simple but with Peter he saves him and he tells us how and he brings him out how is that possible because God decided I'm going to use James as a Martin and I'm going to save Peter because Peter still got work to do and that was God's decision and that's the way he does things and that's why it's it's dangerous when we start to compare amen you human reason would ask why would such preferences be given to Peter and when we bring it to the church why would God give that brother such a blessing and me not why would my why would I suffer and the other one you know just money is just thrown at him he doesn't know where to put the bags you know the cupboards are full the car is full the bank is overload every everywhere he turns there money but me I must beg for every sin why we are in the same church we believe the same God we follow the same message you know everything is the same why would God prefer one above the other God does not prefer one above the other God see us all the same we are all United we're all the same in front of God but God has got a purpose and a reason for our lives and we should learn to trust him to say Lord God whatever you give me father I'm happy with that that's why human reasoning is put aside because Faith rest on the wisdom and love that God loves me that's where Faith rests God loves me because all things work together for good to them that love the Lord who are called according to his purpose so it's very strange now acts 7:54 so we've spoken now about men that were disciples called the Inner Circle the chosen ones and in Acts 7:54 he speaks about a deacon so he gives more uh explanation God about a deacon than about than about James when he heard these things they were cut to their heart and they nashed him on their teeth but he being filled of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly unto heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God Steven and he said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and run upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul amen the mind of God now here's a deacon and God has chosen him to do something very very special he preaches a wonderful message a testimony he tells them and they couldn't take it they said put their hands in their ears and now they're going to Stone him but why didn't God save him I mean we've got in our minds that once I accept God everything must be smooth everything must be perfect no we cannot think like that because your life there's a purpose and a reason now here's Steven and there's a young man standing there Saul this whole happening of Steven was for that man that would become a messenger to the first church Age The Prophet says this was the the beginning of Saul's conversion when he saw a man that could look to heaven and wor worship God in the middle of the greatest test as the Rocks come against his head he raises up his hand and he says Lord forgive them he looks into heaven and God takes him up he says it's such an effect upon Saul that it never left him that was the beginning and the preparation of Saul's conversion so Steven had a major part to play but he had to die to play the part for you to play a part you have to sacrifice something for you to stand as a witness things must happen in your life things that you can never explain that's right you would look at other people and say nothing happened to them don't worry they carry their cross every house got a cross every person has got a burden to bear but the purpose is always for somebody there is always reason behind it your your suffering is not without reason just always remember that when you want to give up no there's a reason behind it God knows why he allowed it because we can find these examples amen but that's why we never rank can I take off my jacket my we never rank people in church we should never do that um we should never look at it and we should always understand that once you start to rank people like you know the pastor the Deacon the pro the the apost OST or whatever you want to we don't rank people because it is dangerous we love everybody the same we honor gifts we respect one another but we don't have a ranking system where one believer is more important than another Believer from the highest to the lowest from the poorest to the richest from the most beautiful to the most ugly we are all the same is that true yes it's true I know I'm not the most beautiful person but I love the Lord amen so we trust the Lord because we are not in competition that's right we are not in a spiritual competition many times we think we're in a spiritual competition you are not in a spiritual competition you have been bought you have been sealed and you are a son and daughter of God and that settles the matter if you've read one spoken word if you read nothing this week it does not change your status we are not in a competition to see how much you have done how much you've listened because the devil can also listen to it the devil can listen to more tapes than you can listen to your life yes he's he's he's much more equal you know effluent he's much more um he's got much more of a capacity to do things that's why we're not in a competition to see who's the most spiritual in a church we are not in a competition to see who knows knows the the the the the most what does the Bible say if you've got a matter to address call the one who knows the least in the church let him judge it you know that's what the Bible says because if you've got the Holy Ghost God can speak through you things which can confine the wisdom of man so we're not interested who's the best we are not interested to know but we are here to celebrate gifts if God start to use somebody in the church we rally behind that gift and we lift up that gift and we pray for that gift and we support that gift that's what the church is supposed to do rather compete against your flesh if you are a competing person compete your flesh don't compete against your brother or sister take your flesh that right we're going to compete see who's the strongest you know who's going to win this battle and then you start a competition with your flesh you start to put him in sub you start to give him Direction you start to give him give him some some guidelines and some limitations and start to hone him down and then then you're in a good point to see and start to exercise your faith who can make the decisions Luke chap 22:40 Luke chap 22:40 Jesus going into Gethsemane now here's the word in flesh walking you know looking and understanding and has got all the mind of God the fullness of God in him and he's walking now he's is going to his greatest trial he's going to the the place of decision The Wine Press of God and when he was at that place he said unto them pray that you enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone cast and he kneeled down and prayed and saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done amen and there appeared an angel unto him him from Heaven strengthening him now can you imagine that the word in flesh when he was at his greatest test and trial of his life he needed an angel to visit him to impart strength so what about me and you living in 2024 when pressure starts to mount and so on we also need the visitations of God that's why when we come on a Sunday morning I always say Lord strengthen me oh God visit me oh God and Quicken me that I can face another week so we're not coming to church to be saved is that too strong maybe I should pull that back brother no it's true we are not coming to church to be saved church can never save you because if church can save you it will save the make believer and the unbeliever but we are coming here to be energized we are coming here to find our place we are coming here to have a visitation because as I said when we come together we bring the supernatural down and when the supernatural is here I can just reach out my hand and Touch the Hem of His Garment and I can be energized for my position my situation and Monday morning I can face the devil again that's why it's so wonderful when we're in Heavenly places that we are not in New Zealand this morning we are right in heaven because that's where we want to be to be energized so they appeared an angel unto him for he from Heaven strengthening him because it's a time of decision it was not an easy decision he knew what the price was involved and the prophet says this is where the victory was won not on Calvary but right here right here he says it was done because once he said I'll do it he took the cup of God's Wrath he drank it and he walked out there he was like a lamb to the slaughter he never argued he he took the decision and it's the same with us your Victory lies in your decision when you make the decision the victory is done if you make it the right way God will help you and back you up all the way God has never failed us and God can never fail us now remember a prophet was born with a special gift he was a prophetic gift he was the last Messenger to the last Church age we understand that he came and God chose him before his birth to be the prophet you could not apply for it because if you look at his parents it was a disaster yes they were drinkers murderers I don't know what else according to his own words his grandparents the disaster everything around him a disaster even the extended family disaster if I would choose the last messenger I would certainly not choose in that family because what can come out of that family but that's why God chose me and that's why God chose you he doesn't look at that he look at predestinated he look at his own world and he knows and he understands and that's why love him that it doesn't matter what my father has done my grandfather has done I am an individual that God chose me and he loved me and I appreciate that I embraced it that's why I walk with that and I'm free from the guilt and shame that the family would carry because I am a new creation I have been born again I have joined into another family am mean because if you look at your own family you know you if they ask you what family are you from no I'm not from that family I'm from the other one sometimes you're ashamed and I think that's the way the prophet were you know he was so so I would almost say humiliated by the circumstances which he had no control so on his birth when he was born you know he was almost killed because we know as his mother gave birth he was he and her was alone there and the fire dried up and you know the snowstorm was there it was dangerous and the Holy Ghost moved on the neighbor to say there's no smoke in the in the in the fire there there's no smoke there amen and the Holy Ghost moved him to go there and get wood so that they can survive because God could not allowed that his gift could be taken away prematurely because God is God and at 7 years old we know when he walks and he's carrying water now I like this when he he's carrying water to where not to the animals the the cows and stuff brother Steve or to the Sheep food he was carrying water to the Whiskey Still he's now he's now helping the devil creating whiskey so that people can become alcoholics is that true as a Young Man he'd know say his father told him this is what you'll do or I'll beat you so he's carrying the water as he's carrying the water the malberry trees start to move and there's a whirlwind which pulls his attention and he looks at that and the voice says to him don't smoke drink toile your body in any way because I've got a work for you to do God was not worried about him carrying the water to the Whiskey Still you know many times we want to put the cart before the horses but I believe you know when God has got a place and a time like I said a chairos time for the prophet to be ignited into his ministry he could not be ignited at seven years although it was the pillar of fire there speaking to him there's a time and many times we lose focus we want to push maybe our children into a certain time slot or this or that you should trust the Lord to say Lord Jesus if there is predestinated seed at your time it will be ignited you cannot change that but we are human we want to push we want to influence we want to we want to do certain things but trust the Lord you'll do much better then they go fishing after that some few years after that and now they are in the fishing boat and the man that fishes with his dad is he says it's a and I liked very much just I liked him because he paid me 10 cents per bottle per Empty Bottle I walked the streets he said that was my job I walk the streets looking for empty wine bottles or whiskey bottles or whatever and then I bring this to this man and then he pays me 10 cents per bottle so he was my favorite man he say and now they're on the ship or the little boat they're going fishing and the man pulls out the whiskey that they made he took a big big sup or whatever and he hands it to him to the Prophet The Prophet says no thank you I don't drink but he's still picking up those bottles he's still involved in the process as the young man there and uh the man was shocked he says a brandom that does not drink I've never met a person like that and the dad says to him you know what no I I raised one boy now that to any young man when your dad says you are a boy it breaks you it's got such a such an influence upon you and he says that was too much he says I said to the man give me that bottle I'll show you who's a boy and he took that bottle he says I'm will I was willing and ready to drink it but when I took it and I brought it to my lips he says that same wind no voice no just the wind say and I knew it was the supernatural visitation of God and I gave back the bottle and I started to cry and the man really said yes you are a boy and that's the effect upon him so you can understand the mental pressure that he growing up in a family that drinks from morning till evening they produce their own drinks because it was illegal so they're doing it undercover all the pressure mounts upon him and he's growing up he's now 14 15 16 in those years and his dad calls him a and he's under pressure amen and then he says when I was 18 says I found a lovely young girl my friend had her his his girlfriend and I had my girlfriend and we said we're going to go out on a date we got into the car I think it was a convertible and went beautiful they drove down the streets have a good time stopped at The Roadhouse or whatever went in he says we bought Cokes and sandwiches and we got into the car we had sandwiches and cokes and just a wonderful time just and this this lady was so beautiful he says you know how pretty she was she had eyes like a Dove Brothers have you ever seen that eyes like a dove these bachel brothers man teeth like pearls you can imagine you can almost see it neck like a swan so that's how he describes her you know and there we I I just loved her and the prettiest thing you've ever seen no no she was pretty and he says man I I was so I was so excited and and after eating the the the sandwiches and drinking the cokes he says I I went back to take the cokes back to get the money for the bottles back the deposit and so on he says and when I got out and I looked at the car and yet they were all sitting smoking now the beautiful swan neck P teeth Dove eyye girl with a stinking cigarette in the mouth I mean you know he says I was shocked and I came to them and she offered me the pack B here's a smoke for you he says no I don't smoke he says what do you do you don't smoke you don't drink what do you do for fun he says I fish and I hunt and she made a very bad comment and she said to him oh you're a boy now remember his dad already called him a now the love of his life you can maybe handle your dad but when a girl tells you that that's bad and she says you're a boy and my girl called me a and I said hand me that packet of cigarettes and I got a hold of one and just as determined to smoke it God is my judge and when I started to light that cigarette before I could strike the match I hear it to come again that's all he needed to hear God already told him so God didn't repeat it but when he heard that same wind he knew knew that same message was behind that wind am you know and he just looked at it and I turned and I got out of the car crying for a 18-year-old young strong man in front of the love that he thinks is the love of his life to start to cry is bir crying and they turned the lights on me and and they let me walk up that road follow me with their lights on singing to me and making fun of me can you imagine the lights behind him singing oh boy boy he says it just almost destroyed him singing to me making fun of me because I was too much of a to smoke a cigarette that's pressure that is peer pressure to the extreme limit you know you have been humiliated you have been you have been called names you have been just just and now you want to prove that you're a man and and you can't do it because God won't allow you I thank God that he didn't allow that Prophet to go his own way I thank God that he stepped on the scene I thank God that it was not negotiable amen for me and you we went different ways and God allowed it and you came back on the right road but for the prophet which had a such a unique Ministry God had to protect it for me and for you he was called a for me he cried for me he was rejected for me to bring a message so that I could see Jesus Christ in the reality and accept him as my personal savior amen he says it wasn't that I was too much of a but God was preserving the gift for this day that's all it was and me I was determined to do it what is the prophet saying here he's saying I wanted to do it it was not because I was a prophet that I didn't do it I wanted to do it but God took a control of the situation and he refused it and that's how I trust God that if I am part of the Bride of the Lord Jesus which I Believe by Grace he will take care of me he will prepare me he will have me ready when my name is called I'll say Lord I'm ready let's go it's not up to me it's not up to you but it's up to God now Jesus comes and he walks and and and and and you know Jesus had appointments the whole life of Jesus was directed by appointments he had a diary which was set before the foundation of the world he didn't just walk around and find somebody hdly on the street and say how are you God bless you before he was born every day of his life was written out every meeting was noted and one meeting I love especially the prophet speaks about it so so much is a woman at the well I mean he's busy it's not really a time and this but he's busy and all of a sudden out of the blue he says to disciples um go buy food now you don't send 12 disciples to buy food like I always tell the church you know I've got a few Brothers when we work there and they we need to buy Kentucky they all want to go together because then they take hours so I've learned to say no one only you choose who's going because the more they are together the longer they take you don't need five or 12 Brothers to carry a few bags of food but Jesus says all of you go buy food and they go and he goes and he sits out there on a little wall cuz he knew two minutes she'll be here and I don't want anybody around because this meeting was noted in my diary as a private meeting I thank God that he's a God that respects my privacy God will never humiliate you I don't care if if the poopit humiliates you you're in the wrong poopit the purpose of the poopit is not to humiliate you is to identify to help you to expose sin and to help you but not to humiliate you it is to raise you up and to build you and to place you and to give you the grace to know that Lord I feel so loved and here she comes private meeting all the all the all the disciples gone if he wanted them there to Witnesses he would have kept them but he knew this woman had done things in her life which nobody else should here it was not good and as she comes you know he he he initiates the contact says don't you want to get me water now she was not she was well spoken she she was not afraid to speak her mind is why you speak to me you're not allowed to speak to me you know that by the laws and he says if you knew who was speaking to you you'll ask me for water she say oh you're making jokes you don't even have anything to catch water with that was the conversation she was not shy in that way she was a very expressive she she knew certain things and then he says to her go get your husband she says I have no husband says you're right you had five the one you're living with now is not your husband M she looked at him and says do we know when the Messiah come he will do this he says it's me speaking to you and she runs and sets her down on fire because he has found her the Lost SP but it was Private maybe he said other things to her there we won't know but I tell you what he wanted it to be priv it he written it in the Bible for us to understand the discernment of the intents of the heart and we thank God for such a god such an expression of of Grace towards me and you I have never in my life felt humiliated by my God I have never ever felt belittled I have never ever felt that he does not love me unconditional love like you will never experience that's the way we feel to know Lord God I don't deserve it but Lord Jesus you loves us amen that's why the prophet many times says in the prayer line when you come in the prayer line confess your sin before you come to me because I won't be accountable for what I'm going to say because God's going to say it the way it is so even God there gave the people opportunity that as he comes you can say Lord Jesus I've done something terrible forgive me and when you enter that presence where the angel was that the Propet would say he can't see that taken away not even a glimpse the prophet had no idea what that person and he could have been an adulterer there but when he when he says Lord forgive me and he steps in front of into that presence the blood has already washed it clean that the prophet could look at him and just say I see you are sick I see you on the bed you see this the power and the wisdom and the grace and the the the wonderful way that God administers his gifts that's why we appreciate the gifts of God so so much but Satan will humiliate you he doesn't care he will spread stories about you he will gossip about you he will lie about you God's not like that God will never gossip about you God will never lie about you but the devil he doesn't worry he's not interested in that so we trust and believe that the Lord will help us now Job 1 verse 6 job 1:6 there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them now this is a serious situation there was a day when the sons of God came to presents before the Lord and Satan also come among them so what are we doing this morning we are presenting ourselves before God we are approaching his throne we we are pulling needs everyone as we sit here we've got needs but guess what Satan also came in this morning we think that Satan has got no right to enter a church he's got right to enter the throne room of God not asking but God gave him the permission because God wanted him present God wants Satan to see what God God can do so here the sons of God present and Satan among them and the Lord says look at verse 7 and the Lord said unto Satan where comest thou the Lord engaged him doesn't say what are you doing here out that's why we must understand when we come together like this Satan also comes because he looks at us say my do you believe what's been preached or are you to already on Monday morning with the problem at the work you're in church but your mind is already on Monday or maybe Wednesday you know you can move around you can sit in church but you can be in South Africa or in America or in Hawaii on the beach looking forward to that lovely Holiday in the Sun you know your mind can take you places that's why Satan comes in with you he's here to destruct you he's here to keep you busy that's why it's important when you start to wonder know that there's an EV that try to push and just bring it back and find something that you can aim in and say Lord thank you Jesus and the devil will pull his hands back and he will go to your neighbor and if you see your neighbor start to sleep help him thank you Lord and He will wake up and he can help his neighbor so because we are one we're not yet to say but you that brother slept nicely in this service man I think it's a record it's 45 minutes when we have lunch later today we'll discuss who slept the most no we are here we are Brothers Keeper and we are here because we know the enemy is also here God is here and where God is the enemy is also because the God allows him access because God has not limited him in that way but God limits him in other ways what he can do to you and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him on the earth a perfect and upright man one that fear of God and ath Evil so God now puts out a testimony about job and and and because God wants Satan to take note because God wants Satan to act he needs him now to do certain things and you know how it goes and how God allows him to say you can go and take him because Satan says yes because you protect him that he loves you he says take him but don't take his life so God allows Satan God takes him gives him power but it's limited power Satan does not have power but God allows him under the condition s to do certain things so it's a power with limits now in the message of Testament on the SE the prophet says that's the way it is it's always a mixed crowd believer make believer and unbeliever always conglomerate together there they are even when the sons of God came up before God in the Book of Job he said Satan was sitting among them exactly right when the sons of God appeared in the presence of God they are always there now and here they were there there and one saying one thing and another saying another thing so what is the prophet telling us it says when God gathers in heaven Satan is there just always it it is a principle he still got free reign in terms of roaming around there will come a time where he will be destroyed but that time is not now he now there like a roaring line see you can devour so we must understand the role when we come in here we need to protect we need to create a wonderful atmosphere and we need to be focused in and and and tapped into God to receive what the Lord wants us to do now remember as we said visitations is important to revive our spirits to keep us going some of us has been in the message for 2 years or one year serving the lord received the grace of the Lord being born again some longer some shorter but in this journey you will always needs quickening power that's right because you'll become tired you'll become weary and you need some injections like Elijah after his Mount carel he could kill those prophets and he could call fire from heaven and the next day you find him running crawling under a bush say Lord let me die from this eye to that l in one day that's how it works but God does say are you worthless useless Prophet let me who's next in line no when God chooses you he sticks with you when God calls you he stays with you God doesn't give up on you God is not in the temporal thing when he takes you it's permanent it's it's completed it's sealed it's it's it's done so what does God do he sends an angel from heaven say yo my prophet he needs he needs something special and he finds him under the bush he doesn't wake him up he first prepares the meal then he wakes him up says eat Prophet eats he sleeps again he makes some more wakes him up again he says eat cuz this journey in front of you is heavy you're going to need what you are eating here the word of God that's why when you eat the word of God when you come together in church when you Feast on that Heavenly Mana it feasts you it gives you strength to face the battles that you've got no idea that's in front of you but it sustains you now remember like I said Satan has got a certain access to the throne of God he's got a way like if we take an example First Kings chapter 22:3 yeah is where Micah the prophet is there aab and them wants to go and fight other kingdoms and they need to know from the Lord is this your will or not and 400 Prophet says go you will conquer go I see the enemy slaughtered who it's it's in your hands and the King says is there not one Prophet more left just to just to just to complete the prophecy why do you need one more if you already had 400 because he himself knew deep from that inside that listen man there's an Elijah there is Elijah that prophesied something way back y back but I need another Prophet because I'm scared for my life he was worried for his life because Elijah remember what Elijah has done when when when aab was there and he wanted nebo's Vineyard now he looked at nebo's Vineyard was next to his house so he came to nebor he said to him can I buy The Vineyard from I'll give you a bigger Farm I'll give you a better Farm I'll give you something more I'll pay you money whatever just give the land to me because it's next to my Palace and I can at evening time Walk Through The Vineyards there so wonderful it's so it's so convenient for me and Ne came to him and he say to him no uh the Lord said to me not to do it I cannot give away my inheritance that's right you never negotiate with the devil he wants to give you something bigger something better a better message you say thank you I'm happy with my message thank you I have received what I need and ABAB went home and he went like many of us do when when when the answer is no he closed the door behind him he lays on his bed he turns to the to the wall like your children does when you say no to them and his wife they bring him food he says no I'm not going to eat why no because naov doesn't want to give me his lands and Jezebel said that's not a problem are you not King leave it to me here eat I'll sort it out man and aab was happy he ate his meal and he left it to his wife and she went she find two Liars sons of Bal which is Sons of liars and she said you go you make up a false confession about him and take the people and stone him and she write letters like that sealing it as it was the king written it and they go they kill him and now you know aab goes into the land and she says here it is for free don't have to pay a scent and as he's walking in The Vineyards the Lord came to Elijah and says go and speak to him and as he comes you know how ABAB greets him he says Oh My Enemy what are you going to do today to me remember the word is not your enemy The Prophet is not your enemy you might not agree it might say things that you cannot understand believe it accept it and say Lord Jesus I humbly made myself subject to it so that prophecy was done so he knew because he said to him the the dogs is going to liak your blood where nab's blood was leaked there your blood is going to be leaked so he had that in his back part of his mind now 400 prophets says go go you'll be successful he says no there's one more let's let's get him let's get Micah in and the messenger that was gone in verse 13 to call Micah spoke unto him saying behold now the word of the prophets declared good things unto the king with one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like the word word of the one of them and speak that which is good so pressure just remember 400 men before you told it's going to be this way so all you need to do is just confirm just say yes it's true now look at him in verse 14 and Micah said as the Lord liveth what the Lord sa to me that will I speak that's why I love a prophet that is called a prophet from God he will only speak what God tells him to speak and that's why we love our Prophet so he only spoke what God wanted to speak amen so he came to the king and the King said unto him in verse 15 Micah shall we go against R of Gilead to battle or shall we forbear now listen to this answer and he answered go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it unto the hand of the king wow to me that almost sounds like a lie because he I can read to you there have you read it he says to him go you'll Prosper you you'll win you the battle is yours go it's good cuz that's what he wants to hear say to him go you will forbear you'll be victorious you'll be the greatest King ever go go but the king wasn't happy why not there was an element missing there was a portion as he looked at this don't underestimate a he you know he would look at that and he would understand there's a missing part here many of us when you want to hear what you want to hear and somebody tells you like you'll run with it he told me I can do it and there you go because that's what you want to hear verse 16 and the King said unto him how many times shall I adure Thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord there was no thus say of the Lord there he needed to add you'll go and forbear thus saith the Lord that's why when I read the message and there stands thus say of the Lord I raise my hands and I say thank you Lord Jesus it cannot but come to pass it nothing can stop those words and now the Micah start to speak again because before he just let him go you'll you'll make it he says no no no don't tell me stories tell me thus sayth the Lord that's all I'm interested in don't come and preach stories to me don't come and tell me fancy pies in the skies don't come and tell me a l story that you know this or that preach to me the unadulterated word of the Living God that is thus save the Lord and I'm happy and so every believer is the same way you can only make a Believer happy if you preach him the unadulterated word he will be happy he will be blessed he will say Lord thank you for speaking to me but these you know like I don't know how to call it but stories will not help you but the word will help you that's and now he starts says I saw God's counsel in heaven coming together and I saw God asking his counsel how are we going to make Elijah's prophecies come to pass because aab is ready to go to battle but he's scared because he knows that he's going to die and he's trying to circumvent to bypass death and the Lord says how are we going to do the Bible says some counselors said this some counselors said that there was a conversation and Micah says and then I saw a lying Spirit come out from the from the deeps of Hell into the throne room of God and he says I'll go and the Lord asked him how will you go tell me what you want to do that's how God is he wants specifics he wants detail he he directs these evil forces because he needs to guide the limits where they can operate in and that demon says I'll place a lying Spirit In The Prophet's mouth and the Lord says go you'll be successful man when Micah says that all the other prophets they got red they got blue they got purple they blood pressure through the roof you know they could just and the one walked up to him and he smacked him in the mouth he says where did the spirit of God go when it left me through you and this and that what a commotion and the King says look up this man's feed him the bread of misery till I come back and uh Micah said if you come back I God never spoke to me man when I think about our Prophet when he says if this does not come to pass put a Bo on my back parade me through the town and put their false prophet no man can do that but a man that's certain that God spoke to him like Micah says if you come back God never spoke to me did he come back no that was his day that was finished the prophecy were fulfilled but what does it mean it means that the principle is clear that influence can come from good or from bad you must always make sure that your influence your ignation what inspires you what what ministers to you what what what guides and feeds you is from the word of God from God himself then you'll have good proper results you'll be a settled established believer amen because you need to understand that your own righteousness cannot achieve anything your own righteousness cannot do anything let's go to Zechariah 3:1 Zechariah CH 3 from verse 1 and we'll just take the few first verses then we'll continue with that then the guiding Angel showed me Joshua I'll read from the Amplified then the guiding Angel showed me Joshua the high priest representing disobedient sinful Israel standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at Joshua right hand to be his adversary and to accuse him so remember that's the great work that Satan does is to accuse you daily he's the accuser of the Brethren daily so here's Joshua the high priest dressed in his high priest garments he's standing before the Lord and the Satan is next to him and the Satan is accusing him now look how he accus him and the Lord said to the Lord rebuke you Satan even the Lord who now and ever has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you is this not a lock snatched and rescued from the fire now remember all of you were destined for hell he says but this log was rescued from the fire I am rescued from the fire I had nothing to do I had nothing to do with my salvation I was just just just not even interested in God but God pulled me from the fire and he changed my destiny amen now Joshua in verse three was clothed with FY nauseatingly vile garments and was standing before the angel of the Lord and he spoke to those who stood before him saying remove the filthy garments from him and he said to Joshua see I have caused your wickedness to be taken away from you and I will clothe and beautify you with Rich Robes of forgiveness meant that to me now Look at look at the scenario he's not just any man he's a priest and he's standing before God and when you come in the presence of God your own righteousness is like ffy Rags it's FY I don't care how long you've come to church I don't care how long you've been a pastor Prophet or whatever if you come in the presence of God with your own righteousness it's FY Rags so you'll say why didn't Joshua dress up before he met the Lord that was his best that was his best that he could present to God and still it was nauseating to the Lord when he looked at him he says it's FY because what look clean to me and you in front of God is dirty I can present my own righteousness you can think my man that brother that sister she's so holy that does not that does not statute that that it's a holy person because you can dress a certain way you can talk a certain way that's not what the Holiness and righteousness is what we are looking for because your best ability is FY Rags your best trying effort is FY Rags he says it looks clean to Men on earth looks clean when it comes in the presence of God Holiness it's FY but what do we do we compare to one another y I'm not that bad as that person they come to church once a month I'm here every Sunday brother no I'm feeling okay yo you find somebody that you compare to which is lower than you and then you feel better don't compare to anybody it's got nothing to do with you just look to the Lord and say Lord I don't want to compare myself to anybody I want to just find myself in the word let the word be my measure stick let me be found in the word because your even your most righteous Deeds are FY rags in God's presence amen so how do we get rid of this fess amen how do we want to get rid of it the problem is we want to be good enough as a human you want to be good enough in the eyes of God you can never be good enough for God in your own ability never but as a human we want to be good enough in the eyes of God so we try to be more and more to to to to to make up for the times we've messed up like let let me give you an example let's me and sister El had a big fight last night which we didn't have by the way and I walked out of the motel room and I slammed the door boom and here I go all right so I've left now we are had a big fight she's now not happy I'm not happy so I'm walking down the street and I'm wondering you know what can I do and then after some time you feel sorry and you go to countd down there and you buy a nice bush bush of flowers you come back and you knock on the door I so and she opens up and I give her the flowers I say this is for you I love you that's what we do as humans that has never canceled my bad deed I have not canceled it the only way I can cancel it is to go on my knees and say please forgive me it's the same with God we think if I've done something bad in the week and Sunday I come to church it cancels you cannot do anything to cancel a bad de in front of God you can give all money to the poor you can come to church every day you can pray 7 days a week for 24 hours a day it does not cancel bad Deeds the only thing that cancel a bad deed is on your knees with Eyes Crying to say Lord I've been wrong forgive me then it's cancelled and then on you cannot work for it you don't deserve it it's by grace and by grace alone so stop trying to work yourself into heaven and believe that God is in control and if You' done something wrong don't try and cancel it with a good deed God's not fooled just trust him and say Lord I Repent I ask you to forgive me I help me not to do it again and continue with your good deeds Good Deeds should be there as a Christian we want to live holy we want to live dedicated we want to do the right thing but don't be fooled to say you know I've stolen money this week from my company next week I'm giving to the poor so the one cancels the other I've treated my wife badly now I come with a little Bush of flowers we should buy our wife's flowers but not for forgiveness forgiveness is a talk I failed you I'm sorry forgive me you with me amen so that's what we need to do Solomon said in Proverbs who can say I've made my heart clean I'm pure from my sin nobody so Satan takes advantage of that that as we start to close Satan takes advantage of that human ability that we have to work for our righteousness to try and do good deeds to cancel the bad ones he works on that and he works he's a manipulator of that and we must be very because the Bible says we have an advocate Jesus Christ is an advocate he stands in my place he pleads my case and when I say Lord forgive me the Lord is faithful to forgive me now Joshua didn't when Satan accuses him Joshua doesn't say to Satan no you're wrong he doesn't say no my clothes are not dirty Joshua never said a word because he knew I'm in trouble he looked at he he smelled his stinking clothes he saw his FY Rags it is such a a thing that he realized I can do nothing for myself and the Lord said to the angel take off those clothes and dress him that's how God does it when you come in front of him you must come with his righteousness clothe with his word that's all he can accept and you said there is raise your hand and say Lord take these FY garments from me and dress me with your own garments Lord your righteousness amen so Joshua was guilty as charged doesn't matter how long he's been a priest doesn't matter when he came without God's righteousness with his own righteousness he was guilty and Satan accused him but God spoke on his behalf now listen to what the prophet says in the message e the seal the prophet's thoughts on his own righteousness he says my righteous is not I'm not trusting in my own I don't have any Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 Pillar of Fire Prophet breaking of the seals mighty mighty man of Valor powerful powerful son of the Living God Vindicated prophet he says I don't have any righteousness mine is FY dirty rags now listen to this I love this he says I'll hate to try to go to heaven on my preaching so what is he saying to me he says listen I'm not depending on what I preach to go to heaven I'm not going to heaven because I'm a pastor I'm not going to heaven because I preach every SU Sunday I'm not going to heaven on that gifts and callings are without repentance you get women preachers that can preach twice as good as I can preach with gifts from God in the world because gifts and callings can fall on everybody but the prophet says a son and daughter of God a daughter of God lays down that gift to come behind the pullit She lays it down she crucifies it but gifts and callings are without repentance which means it's there so here he says I hate to go well I hate to go to heaven on my preaching I hate to try to go to heaven on my Visions even the Visions he says I don't count on them for heaven it means nothing in terms of going to heaven I'm going to heaven because I hold his grace in my heart his grace that's why I'm going that's the end and the beginning of my story I'm going to heaven because he saved me by grace and by grace alone there is no no sermon I can preach that can save me nothing there is no amount of times you can come to church that can save you you're already saved you're already saved by grace you come to church to worship Him in spirit and in truth you come to church to just sit in Heavenly places to be ignited together with other people that believe like you because remember righteousness is a person righteousness is not Deeds righteousness is Jesus Jesus Christ if you have Jesus Christ you are righteous he is the righteous one now listen to this God doesn't tell Joshua to take off his FY clothes himself doesn't chase him out and say out go wash yourself go out no he He commands the angel says take off this clothes give him my Robes of righteousness my Robes of forgiveness is just dress the man properly that's the fivefold ministry that's the holy ghost in the church again and I come to church I raised my hand and I said Lord just take the fuffy rags of me this morning and dress me with your righteousness let that gift behind the poopet Lord anoint him and dress me even if I'm the only one oh God I want to walk out of this building oh God dressed in your righteousness that's how God works that's why we come to church that's why we need a visitation that ignites us but what does Satan do he God says to the angel take off the clothes he can't even undress himself he's got nothing to do in the matter now all he need to do is stand in the presence of God that's all you need to do is just to say Lord I'm in your presence Lord do with me what you want to do oh Father God I yield myself to thee oh Father you know best amen so it's only Grace that's all that God does to him is Grace now what does Satan do and and and listen to this carefully because I want you to remember this what Satan hold Satan likes to hold you hostage with your past he holds a big gun against your head how can you talk like this you you know what you done so he ought to hostage hostage is you cannot move you cannot express yourself the way you want to because he reminds you of where you go how dare you do that but he's holding you hostage and that's why I love in this specific verse you know Satan is the accuser Satan is the accuser he continues to accuse accuse the priest before God and he continues but now the Lord steps on the scene and the Lord says I rebuke you Satan and that's what God does for every believer when you confess your sin and it's under the blood and Satan comes against you and he reminds you of your sin you have to turn to him and to say I rebuke you Satan I have been forgiven and I'm under the blood I'm set free and you are not going to hold me hostage any longer because God himself can't remember it remember Satan does not have the ability to forget what you've done only God when you confess your sins it's out of God's mind so don't let Satan hinder your worship don't let Satan hinder your expression as a true son and daughter of God don't let him hold your hostage he's got no right to do it he's a liar that's why the Lord rebuked Satan on the priest's behalf on Joshua's behalf he says Satan I rebuke you and that's why I believe the bride is standing today amen that when Satan accuses her before him he continually tell him I rebuke you Satan she's my wife she's virtuous she's sinless she's righteous she's dressed by my word she has finded my grace I rebuke you Satan that's what he continuously say to him I rebuke you so you can't save yourself by Good Works amen but we are saved by grace and by grace alone now in closing there you know the prophet is flying he's going from one place to another place and he's in a plane up high in the air and just just just just busy with what he's doing there maybe reading his Bible or just thing and as they fly across over Memphis there is a a woman with a sick child all right now this child is dying and he's no more a child he's actually a young man but to the mother he will always be a child but he picked up a disease of sinful living all right so he didn't get a disease that he had no control over he went went out he did Evil things with women and he got a disease that that that was busy killing him because of his sinful life now he's laying there he's dying he's you know he's just going he's going going and she finds the Bible she reachs and she reachs about the shunamite woman who the child died and who she prayed and Elijah came on the scene and he gave her back the life of the child and she says Lord I am here the shunamite here is my son is dying but where is Elijah now remember Satan told her it's his man he deserves to die what with the man thinking now now but God's grace oversteep all those things God didn't care what kind of a disease and how he got it that's how far the grace of God can extend God can save any sinner I don't care what you have done God is more than able to reach out there and take you and pull you and change you amen it is that's God that's my God I remember when we got saved and we walked into that little church there brother you remember and I looked at the people me and my wife sister E's hair was shorter than mine red nails you know the way we come from the world and we sat right at the back of the church and I said to we can never be like these people the women look like Angels the brothers all look like preachers I think we we're not going to make it here I think God made a mistake here we can never look like these people but guess what matter of time then you look like them you speak like them because you have received the same Holy Spirit the same father and then God starts to change you and it's all Happening by God's grace that's how we look and that's how we live by the grace of God not what we have done ourselves when we look at ourselves we know oh God I'm a failure to begin with but today when you speak somebody speaks to you and tell he tells you a bit about his life you say are you're lying you I don't believe you you can never do that that's that's the power of God taking a sinner in the deepest mud and converting him into a saint that you cannot believe his own testimony say no brother I think you are you are you are putting it on too thick just just tone it down a bit I think you're adding too much you know but the principle is clear so this shite woman the Devil comes to and says you praying for Elijah do you think Elijah will come to a boy like that do you think that God will waste his time with a man that has fallen in sin and now dying because of his sin that's hostage he keeps her hostage and she had a decision to make to say yes I'm going to believe him yeah let's just leave it you know he deserves it I feel sorry for the young man but you know actually it's his own fault yes it was his own fault fault but God don't care whose fault it was God's grace is not based upon whose fault it was cuz it's always my fault but God's grace is based upon Grace by his own choosing by his own doing and she just refused to be kept hostage she goes to the Bible she prays she says Lord I want Elijah Lord here my son is dying I don't care what he has done he stays my son and guess what all of a sudden a big storm appears yeah out of nowhere even so that the pilot need to land in Memphis and down the plane comes a small humble shunamite woman with a son who is dying of a venial disease God stops a plane with a prophet midair now they land the prophet still had no idea because God don't tell him and then he comes the next morning he says they book them into a the next morning early he goes to mail some letters and as he comes to the mailbox he puts the and as he turns around God says to him no you continue walking and he goes he says and the tar roads become dir roads the big mansions become small mansions and the small mansions become even smaller and as he comes down the street he just walks and walks and walks and there's a woman at the fence and when he comes P he says good morning Parson wet with the Dew and he says to her how did you know I was coming how did you know I'm a preacher how did you know this he says last night I prayed for you yesterday I prayed I asked the Lord where is Elijah and he said to me go and wait by the gate I'll send him to you and I came out that very early hour of the morning and I refuse to go back how many times did Satan tell her you are crazy how many times did he tell her that he's not going to do it how many times did Satan tried to confuse her and tell her give up you're crazy but she ref news he said I'm not leaving this post my God told me that he will do it for me and it's the same with you I want you to believe the Lord that he says you'll be ready he will save you he will bless you he will keep you believe him don't look at what you have done don't look at your abilities don't look at your failures let Satan go tell him he's no more going to keep your hostage I am free and I'm free indeed the blood of Jesus Christ has made me free the blood of Christ has made you free and he says I went into the house with her the man was saying it's dark in here it's dark in here and I laid my hands on him and we pray together and all of a sudden he says it's getting light in you it's getting light in you and he sat up and he says who are you and he explained to him and he left and as he walked into the airport last call for flight so and so God kept that plane for that Prophet that plane could not leave without him because he was busy with God's work and that's the way as long as you're in the line of duty brother and sister God will take care of you just stay in the word he says and many years later I met the young man on the station serving God that's the key yeah that's the key not deal you know not living in sin anymore but now he's a Son of God and he shouted oh brother Bram I'm so happy to see you he says and he and he and he relate and he could realize this is the man and what a joy and that's the God we serve so Satan the accuser has got nothing to hold you hostage with anymore that's when your sins is confessed under the blood you have to start to believe it act upon it and be an expression don't let him hold you back just be just just let go say Lord I'm going to let go I'm going to be I'm going to be a Vindicated dedicated son and daughter of God I'm going to worship you in spirit and truth I'm going to be oh Father God what you made me to be before the foundation of the world that life is gone that part is finished it's out of God's mind and it's done Satan has got no more right to keep that gun against your head you have to walk away from it amen say Lord I'm free I'm free indeed let's bow our heads this morning if you have a need you can raise your hand to the Lord to say Lord You've spoken to my heart I just want you Lord to act on my behalf the promises that you've given me just take off these filthy rags Lord and dress me dress me with the angel of Light dress me of father with your ministry dress me with your five-fold
