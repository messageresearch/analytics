introduction here um just a very very special friend and just thinking about it over the last couple of days how god has really used brother daniel for us as a church and to really come when we when we needed it most and the lord used him in a mighty way for us just really thank the lord for using that vessel in that way and we want to ask that the lord will continue to use our brother and the lord knows where we're at now we're not at the same place as individuals and as a body that we were that was 2012 when he was here the first time that i knew i remember anyway but we we're in different place but god still knows exactly what our needs are i mean by god's grace he will supply the need so we want to say god bless you brother also it's the sheriff that's here with him it's lovely to have you my sister just just a real privilege that you could both come and just have your liberty my brother and let the lord use you as he wants to use you so as we uh ask your brother to

don't know but uh we um we have we're in the presence of our king so amen he'll do he'll do what he wants done tonight and we're just so thankful for that amen just like to thank musicians for their sacrifice tonight and um brother john god bless you amen never get tired of your song leading bro praise the lord amen the lord's good amen been greetings from home back in kabuto there and um everyone says hello too many hellos to say everyone personally but just to to cover everyone everyone says hello say god bless you brother adrian good to see you brother amen amen brother bruce is the cake i'll bless you god bless you all amen amen well we got a bit of a service tonight and i don't know if it'll be two courses or three yet but we'll just see how the lord leads us tonight and i just just want to be a blessing to you and just allow the lord jesus to use me in a way that would encourage you and it's been a little time since i've been out of ministered out of the country so i'm not used to this but praise the lord it's uh good to be in the presence of family and uh we can have grace one for another amen amen praise the lord let's enter our bibles tonight to the book of romans chapter 12 i'd like to read from three places tonight and um trust it'll be a blessing to you and because brother el ray said yeah we we're not here to lift up ourselves but we're here to lift up our lord jesus christ and just to to recognize what he's doing what he's what he's done in our lives amen if we could put that first slide up there thanks for the the thought tonight which will will progress through we perhaps will get through it tonight perhaps we won't is when the evening sacrifice is consumed by the fire of god so romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen so we see the the the words there in the first verse one the living sacrifice that you present your bodies a living sacrifice go to hebrews chapter 12 i was going to read verse 28 as well here hebrews 12 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace where by we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire amen so if we can also go to the book of kings first kings just i'm not moving too too quickly for you a bit easier for the minister at least i have all these little bits of paper through my bible because oftentimes you can get up in the pulpit and you can't find kings it's just those nerves kind of take over until you settle down a little bit and the lord takes over at first kings 18 36 and it came to pass at the time of the off offering of the evening offering that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art king in us so they are god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the fire that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell down on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god amen a heavenly father lord we commit this evening into your hands lord jesus lord may you be the one heavenly father that receives glory lord from our time we've we've put aside for this service lord that we may be vessels heavenly father that you can work through this evening lord not just me lord jesus but each and every one of us here tonight lord god we love you with all of our hearts lord god we pray that you would just develop this thought lord into the manifestation lord of what you had predetermined it to be lord before the foundation of the world lord that we might know lord god that thou art the lord god in jesus christ's name we ask these things amen amen god bless you take your seats tonight i kind of feel like i'm being forced to go slow here but we'll um distrust in the lord tonight amen so we want to look at this thought here when the evening sacrifice is consumed by the fire of god and we understand that in romans 12 it tells us that we are to present our bodies as a as a living sacrifice and we understand that the evening time as we know it is the is the closing uh of the day to the gentiles just to give kind of bring you into a context here of what we're what we're talking about the evening time we understand that we're in the evening time now the closing of the day of grace to the gentiles so we we know that that we are there most most definitely and we want to kind of look at the conditions that israel found themselves in in first kings 18 here it's a it's a wonderful um thought that that the lord is as um once wants us just to pay a little bit attention to tonight and just to understand the importance of these things and these things are always always important so as we just want to go through this and just look at the conditions that we could say just to bring it into our context here at the time in which we live in that the religious world was in it at this time um we know this story very well and we understand that the people were at this time between between two decisions they they didn't know they were between opinions the bible says elijah came unto the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions so this was a very interesting time um a very interesting day that elijah was there and we understand by this that there was a elijah ministry at this time that was on earth but the question that elijah had was how long halt ye between two opinions very clearly here elijah wasn't one of those who had halted as the word says there in between two decisions elijah had a clear understanding of who the lord was but we understand that there was a question over who is the lord is is baal god or is the lord god and that that was the decision that they were caught in between interesting when you look at this word how long halty i've underlined it there when it means one of the if you look in the hebrew it means to be lame it's described in the hebrew to be someone who is lame and this is very interesting because if we can bring this into a context that we might understand it if you come to a t intersection and you don't know whether to turn right or turn left then you're lame you're not going to move all right because you're between two decisions all right and we know that our lives come to a place where we have to make a decision all right we there's there's there's really no middle of the road okay you've got to make a decision to go with the lord or not with the lord you've got to go one way or another so it was interesting here that god's people had had stopped moving forward they had stopped possessing what was theirs and just understand me tonight that i'm just going to build a bit of a foundation so we can get a bit of an idea of the the main thrust the main thought behind the service tonight but they had had stopped possessing what was theirs it's not that they were bad people they were just caught in a place they were caught in a position it wasn't their heart's desire to be in that place but they found themselves in that place i i believe that god's people want to know who god is and i believe that the reason they want to know that is because god wants them to know that they god wants them to know him and that's why we have a desire to know him is because he wants us to know him as he is known so it wasn't that they were bad people it wasn't that that um it was their heart's desire to know who god was but we understand that every time god wants us to move in a direction we need to be led by the spirit of god sons and daughters of god are they that are led by the spirit of god amen so god's people became lame so what israel needed was a healer amen we don't think of healing in this way very often but what god's people needed was a healer because that's what he came to do he came to heal the lame but not very often do we put that word lame in a place where it's a we're in a place between decisions in that place it's a dangerous place because in that place people decay very quickly your your christian walk becomes less of a christian walk church attendance becomes less your commitment to the lord becomes less because you're you're in that place where you're in no man's land you're you're neither here and you're neither there you know and we we understand the message to the lady i see in church ages that god hates lukewarmness but but sometimes those who are lukewarm they don't desire to be lukewarm they want to be hot for god amen if they want to be cold they would already be cold all right but but we're not people who are lukewarm i was there are not bad people they're just in a place of indecision and they need god to do something in their lives so that they can move forward amen and this is what i believe that we are in that place now where god wants us to move forward i'm not saying you're lukewarm i'm not saying that i'm lukewarm but what i'm saying is that god from here we are to go to a millennial supper a wedding supper amen and and there's something that's going to happen in order for us to move from where we are now to that wedding supper the same thing here where israel found themselves in in order for them to find themselves moving forward god had to do something and what that did is that allowed them to live the next day different to this day that they were living in and i don't know about you but i'm looking forward to the body change amen because it's going to allow me to live that day different to what this day is amen amen so we we're we want we want to take from this story just to be able to help us along life's way israel had got into kind of a rut where you know it was the same stuff on a different day you know monday and tuesday yeah it was a different day but what they did tuesday they did the same thing monday it was the same stuff a different day amen and and i believe that that's not how god wants us to operate god wants every day to be a new day this is the day that the lord has made let us be glad and rejoice in it amen so god's desire for us is to be continually moving forward god's desire for israel was to be continually moving forward but the thing that was stopping them from moving forward was who was the lord there was a revelation needed and god is the revealer of himself so there was only one person who could move israel from the position they were in and move them forward and that was the lord because he is the revealer of himself and the the when i say that there was a revelation needed there was a revelation of god needed we'll bring it into our day there was a revelation of jesus christ needed otherwise if god doesn't do it for us then our lives take on this crazy cycle where things just constantly repeat themselves repeat themselves repeat themselves but god doesn't want our lives to repeat day after day after day god wants us to be growing in him amen god wants us to be possessing his promises amen god gave you promises for your earthly journey when you're in that millennial reign you there are promises that pertain to that but you won't be able to come back and and and and possess the promises that god gave you here we are to possess the promises here amen we are to possess the land here continually continually constantly possessing the things that god has promised for us so what we find here is that israel was in a position that unless god did something that could they could not move forward god was going to have to bring a healing to israel and that healing was going to come through the rev the revelation of the lord amen if they had the revelation of the lord that be moving forward but the fact was that they did not have the revelation of who the lord was because balaam had and his false prophets had crept in and started sowing their own seed and got the people mixed up in a in a in a bit of a a mixed up state in their mind but god is obligated to his people so god was going to come down and heal his people amen in psalm 103 it says bless the lord on my soul all my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases amen who redeemeth thy life from destruction hallelujah who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercy if god was not going to come on the scene here then the israel would have fell into destruction but god was going to redeem their life from destruction hallelujah amen he was going to heal their disease he was going to heal their their their lameness he was going to heal because god is the healer of of all this left no room for anyone else oh sorry i bumped it all thy diseases amen so this meant that only there was only one one god who could who could cause the people to move forward from where they were and yet they were in a place where they were tossing up who was lord and who wasn't lord amen so god was going to god was going to reveal himself and in his ability to reveal himself he was going to heal israel and allow them to move into the next day that god had ordained them to move into israel could not heal themselves no doubt they'd tried but like the woman who tried so many physicians you know there was no one else could that could heal him they could not be self-healed and he's the same today he is the healer he is the one that causes us to move forward perhaps we're being a a little bit stagnant perhaps a little bit lukewarm perhaps we're in that place of indecision my prayer for you tonight is that god would do something in your life that causes you to move forward so that tomorrow cannot be a repeat of today but you can move forward and possess the enemy's gate amen this is our desire this is god's desire for you amen let's just read a little bit here first kings we've we've read this verse here am i going the wrong way sorry i'm going the wrong way we want to go the right direction amen amen first kings 18 21 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word let them therefore this is elijah speaking give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullet and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods i like that huh call ye on the name of your gods and i i will call on the name of the lord [Laughter] i like that amen and the god that answereth by fire let him be god all and all the people answered and said it is well spoken so we see here that elijah under the inspiration of the almighty is is is bringing a bit of a a showdown a challenge to the people not in a way that he wanted to belittle the people not in a way that he wanted to belittle israel but he did want to identify the false god that was in their midst amen he wanted to identify the false god well let's say it another way he wanted to identify the true god and when you identify the true god then you can automatically identify the false god amen so this was the challenge to the people god um elijah wasn't belittling israel but elijah wanted israel to move forward in their walk with the lord and possess what was theirs amen so so god was going to do their healing by coming down in the form of a consuming fire amen god was going to reveal himself through an elijah ministry and how he was going to reveal himself was that he was going to be in the form of a consuming fire amen our god is a consuming fire amen so god was going to come down and reveal himself and in revealing himself he was going to bring a healing to the people he was gonna he was gonna heal their lame bodies and cause them to move forward again this is very interesting and i need to make this statement very clear and that is that elijah knew who god was elijah knew who god who was god and who wasn't god so he wasn't doing this for himself amen elijah had a had had a contact with god himself he he knew who god was it was the people who were blinded to the to who god was amen he had a revelation of who god was so in theory what elijah could have done was elijah could have just said the lord he is god couldn't he because he knew who allah who knew who god was so elijah could have just said to israel know ye not that the lord he is god or he could have said thus saith the lord the lord he is god is that right he could have done it because he knew who god was but god wanted the people to have an experience amen god wanted the people to have a personal testimony god wanted the people to have a personal revelation of who he was and not just work walk forward in saying elijah said he is god god wanted the people to have a personal testimony of who he was i believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i believe that he wants you to have that same thing tonight amen not just because the prophet said but god wants you to have a revelation god wants you to have an experience amen of who he is he wants to be more than someone you speak about through the experience of someone else he wants you to experience him personally it's beautiful to think of how personal god wants to be with us i thank god that he can be that personal i think i thank him that he wants to be that personal with me he doesn't want to be he doesn't want a relationship with me because i read something about him on a poster or i heard a song that someone said and my god is awesome he can move mountains well that's wonderful but god wants more than that god wants to exp us to experience his awesomeness and his power the experience that god was going to give israel was going to come through an elijah ministry because god does nothing but he reveals it to his prophets first so the experience that israel was going to to be a part of was going to come through an elijah ministry but the experience was for all of israel and not just elijah okay what elijah experienced was not was it was not just for elijah god wanted israel to have the same experience as elijah amen and we bring that into our day and and our elijah we get these funny ideas that that that god doesn't want us to have the same experience that our elijah did but i beg to differ yeah i'm not a prophet i'm in the office of a pastor i'm a father i'm a i'm a husband i'm a son but in the in the office that i hold god wants me to experience him so that uh that he so that he is as real to me as what he was to the prophet amen the prophet could stand in a service and and and be so sensitive to the holy spirit he say he is here i mean god wants a personal relationship with each and every one of us amen god wants god wants me to experience him so that he is as real in my life as what he was in the prophet's life yes i'm not a prophet don't expect me to to to see visions etc etc but in the place that i stand in the office that i hold god wants me to experience him god wants to be real to me amen god wants to be real to you amen god wants to be tangible amen god wants to god wants you to know that he's here amen god doesn't want you to be wondering if he's here god wants you to know if he's here he wants you to know that he's here amen it's an experience it's something that that that god wants for you and i i'm so thankful that he that he wants that for me amen amen i feel humbled i feel humbled to to to understand that he wants me to have this experience so we we come now to a time when the prophets of baal prepared their sacrifice as elijah had instructed them they we we know the story they danced they sung they shouted elijah teased them a bit maybe he's gone on vacation maybe he's fallen asleep maybe he's on the phone you know what i mean maybe he's busy you know um and they cut themselves and and blood was pouring out and not nothing happens and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening time of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded okay so there was just nothing it was just a lot of noise there was just a lot of noise with with with no presence of the lord amen despite their efforts despite everything that they did and elijah i can just imagine what elijah must have been thinking as he was as he was watching and we noticed that not at any time that elijah step in and say hey enough's enough but he let him go and he let him go and he let him go until that had enough okay and and now it was it was elijah's time and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me you know you'll always know when you're in contact with an elijah ministry because there's a certain confidence that comes with it so elijah says come near unto me and all the people came near unto him now remember here that it wasn't just israel but it was also the false prophets etc etc he called them all in he called them all in and said come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he prepared the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar this is interesting i'll just throw this in here you can see up in the background the top right corner there that there's another alter the theologians that the the people who do the concordance on the bible said elijah didn't use the the the same sacrifice or the same altar he built a new altar because the altar represents the word right so god was not going to come down on a false word god was only going to come down on his word amen verse 33 and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and he did it the third time they did it the third time and the water ran about the altar and filled the trench also with water and it came to pass that the at the time of the offering of their evening sacrifice so it was the evening time that a revelation was going to come forth god was going to come down amen god was going to come down amen the the dove was going to come down amen was going to come down at the when the evening time let's bring that into our day in the closing of the dispensation of grace to the gentiles in the evening time the dove was going to come down again the seventh seal was going to come down again amen the the the fire of god god the consuming fire was going to come down again he wasn't going to send someone else our god is a consuming fire he was going to come down himself and vindicate who he was oh my it was the evening time this is why elijah had to let him go at nine o'clock he said hey you got six hours to go yet at midday he said hey you got three hours to go yet because evening time starts they say around around three o'clock whatever it is but they had to stop at the evening time because the evening time is god's time the prophet would say god would come down and speak to abra um sir adam and eve in the evening time is god's vindication time it was the evening time let's move forward that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day notice here that there's three reasons for this number one is that that thou art god in israel not god of israel god in israel there's a big difference god not god of israel god is israel so now think about this in the context they're in between two opinions the the the reason that they couldn't decide who was god was not because god wasn't there god was there but they didn't know god because he elijah was saying here that thou art god in israel not god of israel even though he was god of israel but the god of israel was in israel and he was unidentified my and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word really important verse here because we want to concentrate on that last part there for a little bit that i have done all these things at thy word what this means is that when elijah asked for the four barrels of water it wasn't his idea it was god's idea why because i have done all all these things at thy word not at my word not according to my idea but at thy word i have done these things so the four barrels of water that elijah asked for were were inspired it was god who inspired elijah to do these things and then he asked it for the second time and then he asked for the third time so three times elijah god had revealed to elijah to get four barrels fill those four barrels with water and bring them up and pour them over the altar we're under we see that the in the picture there i think i've got a blown up version here that had that they're pouring the water over the altar you know things that god revealed to elijah didn't always make a lot of sense at least not to the human mind people didn't understand why elijah was doing what he was doing but brother and sister we understand if god inspired elijah to do it there had to be a purpose there had to be a reason even though people don't understand it and perhaps if we were standing there at that time we we couldn't we we would struggle to understand why would elijah be doing this why is elijah doing this i i don't understand why elijah is doing what he is doing but i understand who elijah is elijah is an inspired man and elijah has contact with god and he hears things from god that i don't hear so i'm just going to have to have confidence in elijah that god is inspiring him amen and that's the way sometimes god works with us through our elijah ministry he asks us not to do certain things he asks us to do certain things and sometimes we don't know why he asks us to do certain things and not to do certain things but if we have a revelation of elijah we'll understand this man is god-led if he's hell if he's telling us something standing in his in the position that he is then it's best just to listen and to do what he is asking us to do and wait for the revelation to come a little bit later on even in the foot washing service jesus said you know not what you do now but you'll know hereafter just follow just just do what i say for now the revelation will come amen obedience to the word amen and perhaps even in elijah in elijah's mind he was questioned not questioning but he was saying as he was asking for the water perhaps he didn't really understand perhaps he didn't understand what the purpose was behind it but elijah was obedient elijah was obedient because elijah knew that god that i'm hearing tell me do these things he can't fail amen so he was doing things just by obedience to the word elijah prepares the sacrifice elijah prepares the sacrifice i'll say that another way the sacrifice becomes prepared through an elijah ministry the sacrifice becomes prepared through an elijah ministry remember romans 12 offer your bodies as a living sacrifice the sacrifice becomes prepared through an elijah ministry was elijah the only one preparing the sacrifice no no elijah had helpers there were other ministries that were going to be involved in the preparing of the sacrifice and those ministries were effect are effective and they were and are effective because of their obedience to the elijah ministry if one of them had a comeback with wine instead of water elijah was standing there as the judge of what they were pouring over the altar because god had asked for water not wine he'd asked for water so elijah was standing there making sure that the water that it was water and not any anybody nobody had lent to their own understanding and bringing something that wasn't according to god's mind amen now it's interesting here because when the prophets of baal prepared their sacrifice they never did this and nor did elijah instruct them to they just did what elijah said and they did what they thought was necessary to bring god down and that was really self-afflicting themselves whipping themselves cutting themselves singing but singing their own version of our lords is perfect or something you know but elijah was do what elijah did he did all things at god's word so what this means is that elijah was given by god a revelation of the sacrifice elijah was given a revelation of the sacrifice amen amen because everything that elijah did he did according to god's word so what this sacrifice was was the word of god expressed yes it was the word of god manifested amen it was god's thoughts now tangible if you wanted to know the mind of god you could look at the sacrifice and say that is the mind of god revealed elijah had a revelation elijah was given a revelation of the evening sacrifice oh my so god could only come down when elijah had done everything that he was asked to do because if elijah said well you know water on the sacrifice no no think about how sure elijah was of god's voice oh my elijah was so sure that that was god's voice telling him to put water over the sacrifice that he put water over a sacrifice that god was going to prove himself by fire [Music] it makes no sense but god could only come down upon his own revelation expressed amen this is going to kind of be the theme of the of the of the next couple of services god could only come down upon his mind expressed now there was no guessing now if we were standing there we could look at this sacrifice say this is the mind of god expressed this is god's thoughts god god's thoughts expressed amen and i want to just emphasize this that god could only come down upon his own revelation god will not anoint your revelation god will not anoint my revelation the devil can anoint his revelation his own but god will only come down the dove will only come down upon the pure word upon the mind of god expressed will the dove come down the sacrifice was a revelation to elijah now our elijah was going to get a revelation of the evening sacrifice present your bodies a living sacrifice when in the evening time in the closing of the dispensation of grace to the gentiles there will be an evening sacrifice god was going to prove to his people that the revelation given to elijah was not elijah's god was going to prove to the people that the revelation that elijah had of the sacrifice was the lord's revelation not elijah's it was god's revelation god's revelation all elijah was doing was expressing what god had revealed to him it was god's own revelation given to elijah so what we have read in the scriptures is that we are to present our bodies as a living sacrifice but the sacrifice must be a revelation to us because this the revelation that was given to elijah was now given to the people a lot the elijah ministry never never never never made the people dependent upon the man but the revelation was given to the predestinated seeds of god amen so the revelation that was given to elijah here in this picture was now going to be given to god's people that this is the evening sacrifice this is the mind of god expressed and it's the same in our day that the revelation of the evening sacrifice that god is going to have in this end time if it's not just bottled up in one man that revelation has gone out to a people of the sacrifice now we're not looking at a sacrifice you are the sacrifice let's look at this the god that answereth by fire let him be god fire water fire water in my experience as a boy you use water to put fire out and yet god instructed elijah to pour water over a sacrifice that god was going to prove himself to be god by consuming that sacrifice with water with fire but now there was there was there was so much water on the sacrifice that it had filled the trench that elijah had dug around the altar there was water in the in the bullock the timber was wet the stones were wet 12 barrels of water had been poured over a sacrifice that god was going to prove himself by to be god someone explain it but this is god's idea not elijah's idea this is god's idea it's hard to burn wet wood it's hard to burn wet rocks it's hard to burn water in the minds of the people elijah had gone too far the people questioned the man's mental state why would you pour water over a sacrifice that you intend to prove god by there were pools of water on the altar there were pools of water in the beast there were pools of water everywhere why why why would you do this elijah why would you why would you why are you doing this why are you doing this when you're going to prove who is god by a fire coming down and consuming a sacrifice when you've just totally covered it and saturated it in water why are you doing this perhaps some decided to walk home perhaps there were some who become discouraged by the acts of elijah perhaps there were some who didn't want to be a part of the embarrassment that would come as a result of the failure of the elijah ministry and there was then there were some who just stayed watching to see what was going to happen perhaps there were some who were thinking back at their own experience of trying to start a fire with wet wood because fire was a major part in their in in their economy and they they knew that it's hard to start a fire with wet wood so they were kind of thinking on a carnal level that um i i just can't see how this is gonna work i can't understand how this is going to work and yet a lot everything elijah had done he had done at god's word just because we don't understand what elijah done doesn't mean it's not according to god's word by all accounts this fire should not have started according to my experience with fire this fire should not have started but we know that it did proving to us that god can do what you can't what is impossible for man is possible for god amen and the sacrifice on a on a man level it was impossible but when god looked at this sacrifice after elijah had done everything he was called to do and it sat there in its saturated state god said it is perfect it's exactly the way i wanted it well done my faithful servant god is not limited by physics god is not limited by education god is not limited by statistics and god is not limited by wet wood and god is not limited in power what was causing the people to question elijah's authenticity god was going to reveal his strength through it what was causing the people to question elijah's authenticity god was going to reveal his strength through the weakness of the sacrifice at the time that this fire ignited maybe those who had started to walk home now listen sometimes you can't blame people for getting discouraged in church you can't because sometimes things just go beyond what they know is capable or able or possible but if like thomas god will prove to his people that he is god amen so some of these people who were walking home before elijah called for the fire heard a a racket behind them people shouting and singing and dancing as the fire erupted on the altar and ran back to see for themselves this is what we need in the church [Music] we need people sacrifices who are consumed by god and it causes the discouraged to turn around and come back and say what's all the racket about he says the consuming god is here my consuming god is here god is a consuming fire god will cause us to move forward amen you cannot lead yourself to the wedding supper you don't even know the way there excuse me okay you need to be led there because you are sheep and sheep cannot find their way home sheep need a shepherd and it is our lord god the consuming fire who will cause us to find our way home think about the water this water was perhaps just in the ocean somewhere remember it hadn't rained for three years no one really knows where this water come from but we know that there was water but through the elijah ministry there was a portion of water that was called by god through an elijah ministry to become part of god's program sometimes i repeat things because i feel led to repeat them so if i repeat myself it's not because i'm getting old this water was in the ocean somewhere let's say and a through an elijah ministry god was going to god was calling a portion of this water to himself so that that water could find its position in god's program through the elijah ministry an elected water that was in god's mind before the foundation of the world god's strength was going to be made perfect through the water the water surrounded the altar elijah had dug that trench elijah in all things at god's word elijah dug that trench because god knew the water was going to surround the sacrifice the trench that elijah dug held the water brothers and sisters it's not you holding god it's god holding you amen your ability to get to the wedding supper is not by your strength it's by his the prophet of god said he said it's not your love in question it's his amen it's god holding you not you holding god the weakest part of what you see here was the water the weakest part of this sacrifice was the water what did god say he said my strength is made perfect in weakness the sacrifice and all its components were a revelation to elijah the water represents humanity chosen before the foundation of the world called by an elijah ministry placed correctly in relationship to the word all this is the perfect mind of god on display god cannot use unsurrendered humanity that's why through an elijah ministry there became 12 barrels of water that were now surrendered as a result of that ministry to the work of the lord and god can't use us unless we're fully surrendered to his word and the way that we become surrendered to his word is through an elijah ministry and through that elijah ministry now we can play our part amen because we have a part because elijah had done all these things at god's word so the water was a part of god's program the weakness was a part of god's program this humanity is a part of god's program it was in his mind before the foundation of the world but now it has been called through an elijah ministry it's it and now it's positioned correctly in relationship to the word why let's refresh why because god was going to prove that he was god through the weakness of the sacrifice through the weakness of the sacrifice god was going to be made strong think about this we have thought about the water by thinking about this body god placed himself in a body of flesh that was born by sex desire this body is like the water on the altar and the same questions come up now how can god do it how can signs and wonders follow such weakness [Music] look at them elijah's gone off the rails he's gone too far but it's exactly in accordance with god's word it won't work but brothers and sisters we ain't just anybody you know what i find in my my walk over this over the past six months is that the devil wants me to think that i'm just like anyone else well let me ask you a question devil was this water like all the other waters [Music] this water was had the same characteristics but it was cold it was chosen it was elected by god from before the foundation of the world that i'm gonna work through that water i'm gonna walk work through that humanity we ain't like everyone else we're chosen by god positioned through an elijah ministry separated because of an eagle call you can call yourself a chicken but god's told me i'm an eagle that's what makes the difference is the elijah ministry this flesh has been called by an eagle call to become part of the sacrifice that's what makes the difference it's not the way you you do your hair it's not the way that you dress but the reason i do that is because i have been called by god through an elijah ministry without that elijah ministry i could not be positioned amen but we've got to recognize that we are part of god's order we are a part of god's program even even though we are the weakest part of the sacrifice i'm still a part of his program he still called me even though i am the weakest part of the the sacrifice that you see the bit that you see is the weakest part humanity glory this body is dedicated to the work of the lord and i am the weakest of this relationship yes sir i am the weaker vessel because we are the bride that is what i am i am human lord i'm weak i am the weak one in this relationship but i understand my position i understand i'm called i understand i have a purpose in what you are doing i am the water on the altar but lord in my weakness you are made strong in my inability you express your ability the more i can accept my weakness the greater opportunity i give you to express your strength amen the more that i can accept my weakness the more opportunity i give you to express your strength because why god's strength is perfected through weakness but again the water didn't limit god humanity doesn't limit god surrendered humanity doesn't limit god it's surrendered to his will it doesn't limit god it says oh god i said oh my god look what bro look i can't believe that i chose brother dan what have i done that's me he says that why'd you choose me for all lord i don't understand it if the water could speak it'll say i don't understand why don't you choose me you mean that you're going to prove yourself through me i don't get it you know what he says you don't have to just surrender to surrender to the fact that you are chosen by me ordained by me positioned by me and your purpose is by me i will you you are what you are because of me paul said i am what i am because of the grace of god oh my we need to surrender to god's will allow god to work through us don't be ashamed that you're the weaker vessel because god is going to prove himself through you i think this is incredible that god designed something to prove himself by god designed this sacrifice why to prove himself by it amen god designed you god designed me god designed you brother dan yeah with all your flaws yeah with all your weaknesses yeah i mean you can't even say half the names in the bible yep yep he did well but then i don't know how god can use you in that way well they didn't know how god was going to use a seventh grader either and you know what i got to grade 10. but that doesn't mean nothing in the scheme of god nothing at all all god wants is surrendered to humanity your education doesn't help god and nor does the lack of education help god god don't need help he just needs us to surrender to him god is perfected through weakness god is not limited by weakness god is perfected by weakness god's strength is perfected in weakness god's strength is perfected in weakness god is not limited by your humanity god is limited by your strength when you think you're something that you're not you just limit god god had to send moses into the desert for every year that he was educated why because moses education limited god in that moses thought he was something because he had an education i'm not saying we all need to be uneducated okay if you've got a phd just remember you're nothing you're no more than the guy who didn't finish seventh grade why because your phd doesn't help god okay so through the revelation that you're still human we need to recognize this might be a bit of a shock to you okay we need to recognize our humanity and recognize that our humanity is the very thing that god will use to bring his people unto himself this is stranger recognize our humanity yeah recognize our humanity because through your humanity god will bring his people unto himself when he works through that humanity just exactly the same as what he was going to do here he was going to bring himself bring his people unto himself by consuming a weak sacrifice but the sacrifice the strength wasn't in the sacrifice was it once elijah had done all the work elijah can step back and say lord i've done my bit and there was that that that sacrifice did nothing for the people amen it wasn't until the the dynamics and the mechanics united together elijah had done the mechanics but now the dynamics needed to unite with the mechanics so that both could work together and we god just wants us to do what he wants us to do but what it takes is a union between the mechanics and the dynamics it needs the dove to come down upon the sacrifice in a marital union so that now god can do through the evening sacrifice what he wanted to do before the foundation of the world the sacrifice could do nothing of itself does that ring any bells the sacrifice could do nothing of itself we should know that not because we read it in the bible but because we've tried we've tried to do it ourself and fell on our face by god's grace why because it takes the dove to come down upon the sacrifice in a marital union so that now god through the union through whom he has united with reproduces himself through that union again the whole the purpose in marriage is that the the male seed can reproduce himself through whom he has united with the purpose of the union between christ and his bride is so that he can reproduce himself in through the very thing that he has united himself with through humanity god reproduces himself through humanity god is reproducing himself in a many-membered body the mechanics are in place and got elijah calls on god and said lord i've done all these things at thy word. and down comes the fire of god and the fire of god just didn't hover on the top the fire of god was a consuming fire it it it it it consumed the bullock the wet bullock it consumes the wet water well that's understandable isn't it but let's go a bit further it consumed the stones this is something else this is something beyond what we imagined let god interpret his word by bringing it to pass you you don't know how consumed god can consume you until you allow god to consume you but let me just say this once upon a time there was a man named enoch and he was consumed because my god is a consuming fire god consumed him [Music] and when fire come down upon this altar it consumed the stones it says it consumed the dust and it lifted up humanity it licked up the water until the onlookers looked and they said it was there well once upon a time there was a man named enoch and then the fire of god come down and consumed him and they looked and they said he was there where did he go he was not found well guess what it was not found perhaps there was a burnt spot in the dirt i don't know but it was not found well brothers and sisters there is a evening sacrifice amen that has become a revelation she has become a revelation unto herself and she in her weakness is becoming consumed until the people of this tabernacle the neighbors will say he once lived over there amen once she lived over there with a with a daughter where are they going i don't know but we know we will look at us say they were consumed by the fire of god amen we are being consumed until we won't be found there will be no trace of you brother jeremy there will be no trace of me they're gone amen through my weakness god is made strong through this humanity god is going to prove himself to be the one true god the thing that we try and escape we need to accept that's right we are trying to escape humanity through a body change but the way that we're going to be changed is by accepting our humanity this isn't very popular i guess in our in our way of thinking but the revelation of jesus christ is very real and it needs to be as real to you as what it was to elijah it's god in humanity god in flesh and we need to accept our humanity i'll read you some quotations so moses this young fine strong giant intelligent man he set out to do a good work but god simply absolutely could not use it he could not use his natural abilities it isn't today that we cannot god cannot use our natural abilities but there's one thing moses had that i admire he had sense enough to know that he was licked we haven't moses realized it and he knowed enough then god took him back in the back in the wilderness to learn him some human weaknesses he took him back to learn him what it was all about human weaknesses god took moses back to the backside of the desert to teach moses human weaknesses god took moses to the backside of the desert to teach him what it was all about so well did he learn oh my did did he ever get a lesson god must have had a time with him back there you know moses had a temper and god gave him a wife by the name of sapporo she had one too so i imagine everything wasn't so pleasing back on the back side of the desert for a while when both of their tempers got out of control at the same time brothers your wife is chosen for you sisters your husband is chosen for you why to learn some human weaknesses oh it's fantastic i suppose this intelligent concept of a psychological ought to control a person didn't do much good because when he was on the road to egypt i see sapporo still had a temple she cut the foreskin off her she cut the foreskin of her son off and throwed it before moses and said you're a bloody husband to me god was so angry with him that he looked for him in the end and if he could have found him he'd have slain him i guess there was a little things god had to teach him back there see that he was a human why because god was going to work through humanity but moses got the idea that he was something more than humanity so god had to teach him that he was a human yeah he was a chosen human he was elected human but he was still human all of his weakness of egypt all of his wisdom of egypt all of his powers of intellectual god could not use are one of them you come say now lord i've been schooled for 40 years i'm an intellectual student i can quote the bible with my eyes closed god can't use a bit of that see no oh i belong to the biggest church there is in the country i'm this lord i'm i'm a pentecostal glory to god i received the holy ghost the other night hallelujah you're going to make me to do so and so god can't use a bit of that no when you get licked and realize you're licked and then come back come on back and humble yourself get weak find out you're human and there's none of your intellects can do to human weakness will never be used of god god by the human weakness pours himself into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument certainly you've got to get yourself out of the way god can't use human weakness but god by the human weakness pours himself into you then he uses you he uses himself then he uses himself you just become an instrument so let's just going to go and reverse here god pours himself into you and then he uses himself to accomplish his purpose that he had for you amen god pours himself into you and uses himself to accomplish his purpose that he had for you did god have a purpose for the water how was the purpose fulfilled how was the purpose for the water fulfilled by the consuming fire by the dove coming down and consuming the humanity and then the consuming fire fulfilled the purpose that was given to the water glory amen and and and let me just find it here did they cry out then the fire of god fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god amen god wants to use you to reveal himself god is not using you to reveal you god is using you to reveal himself and people look at you and think how can god ever how can god do what he said he was going to do through humanity well brothers and sisters we stand here as witnesses that the lord he is the god the lord he is the god the lord he is the god why because a consuming fire has come down and consumed the evening sacrifice and in its weakness god is revealed in the weakness of the sacrifice god is revealed if you want to do something for god surrender surrender to his word because if he's called you you come and some people in this building know that they're called but they're fighting the calling yes they are but listen to me god is greater than you god is stronger than you i don't care how many times you've been to the gym i don't know how many times you've run up to this mountain and i do not care because god is greater than you god is you think you can outrun god give it a shot but i am a witness that if you are called by god you will find yourself praising god in the pew as a living sacrifice because god has ordained you before the foundation of the world to be a living sacrifice and nothing can stop god's word coming to pass amen my god is awesome he can move mountains but he can cause those that are running from him to turn them he'll just watch you he's got so much energy he'll just watch you until you get too tired that you can't run anymore and he'll look down at you he won't be huffing he won't be puffing he wants i'm glad you stopped he'll say are you done yet if you want to keep going let's keep going it ain't no big deal to me i got all the you know you're shoving down these v drinks and parades and all these things that energize yourself it doesn't matter to god you turn around and say surely i've lost him you turn turn around and he's right there he's not stressing he's not sweating he's not changing his shoes he's not doing up his laces he's just there god doesn't get tired god's strength is endless and if you want to fight god go ahead but i know the end you lose i'm sorry you lose and that's just a fact our god the consuming fire is here amen this is this is the question among our young people where's god it's true where's god but he's here because the god as elijah said lord that you might show to the people that you are god in israel we're not speaking about a god in heaven we're speaking about a god in the bride amen a god in the bride not the god of the bride yes the god in the bride is the god of the bride but the god of the bride is the god in the bride through our weakness humanity god is going to be revealed god is going to be revealed to the father and the mother perhaps of a of a child that hasn't come to christ yet god is going to be revealed to that child through the father or the mother or perhaps a brother or perhaps a sister i don't know but all i know is that god is going to reveal himself to whom i predestinated to know him because it's his desire for his seed to know him god is our healer god is my son's healer amen god can cause my son in us in the stalemate that he finds himself in that place of indecision god could cause that person to turn around but we've got to realize that it could be through me that god reveals himself causing him to turn around and come back to where he left god evening sacrifice there's an evening light amen there's an evening light the evening light is in the evening sacrifice the evening light come on the evening sacrifice did you know that jesus had a revelation of his humanity wow jesus had a revelation of his humanity yes he said i can do nothing of myself jesus knew his weakness we don't think of the revelation of jesus christ like this but the revelation of jesus christ it has power that there is a weaker vessel and there is the powerful vessel the revelation of jesus christ is twofold it's the lamb and the dove yes the seventh seal comes down on the on the lamb the dove comes down upon the lamb the weakest vessel what the dove can't do sorry what the lamb can't do the dove did for the lamb what the lamb can't do the dove did what the lamb can't do the dove does the spirit of god the holy ghost what the lamb can't do ba the lamb what the lamb can't do the dove does the living sacrifice in the weakness of the sacrifice god was made strong amen let's just stand to our feet brother elroy i'm going to have to ask you to close let's just offer a word of prayer our gracious and loving heavenly father lord i know from my life that you've bought me this road for a reason and lord god it's only because of you that i can think of myself this way because this is a revelation the evening sacrifice is a revelation and the evening sacrifice is on earth and she is a revelation unto herself lord god may you just take from us tonight any thoughts that we might have that we can accomplish anything of ourselves lord we stand here as as as useless as that sacrifice was that altar that elijah had prepared by your word and lord god you have prepared yourself for sacrifice we are not self-prepared but lord god you have prepared us to be totally consumed by you in all our weakness in all that we are the things that we try and escape we need to accept lord god we want to thank you tonight for this beautiful revelation that you have given us that you are not asking us to be strong in our human ability but lord god the strength that you require of us is through the revelation of who we are and into the revelation of who you are that lord god we can achieve nothing of ourself but lord god with you all things are possible oh lord that's the revelation of jesus christ for this hour it's strength and weakness uniting together it's the supernatural and the natural uniting together oh lord god our prayer heavenly father is if we have been in that place of indecision that this revelation lord god would sink deep into our hearts and lord jesus if there be someone amongst us tonight that is questioning who is god lord god may you reveal yourself tonight through a surrendered vessel through a living sacrifice that is here tonight lord god for your honor and glory o lord god our desire is that we become so consumed lord god that the people who have become discouraged turn back to see what the noise is about lord god and you you attract people to yourself lord god you are not attracting people to grace tabernacle but lord god you're attracting people to yourself through the grace tabernacle oh lord god may we as fathers understand who we are may we understand may we not limit god but say well i don't know if god can use me i'm just too weak that's the very thing that god is going to reveal himself through may mothers lord god be the same way they may feel insignificant they may feel insufficient they may not know what the next step is but lord god if if we would just recognize who we are and call on you like a lie to call and you say lord i have done all that you've asked for consume your sacrifice lord lord god we give you our respect we give you honor tonight by
