[27:01] my life I mean he did indeed praise God
[27:08] I am sad it's last service and you know
[27:16] brother Branham speaks about the
[27:18] campground cramps you know how we can
[27:20] sometimes just live from revival to
[27:22] revival I mean every day should be
[27:25] revival but yet when we've had a weekend
[27:28] like we've just had you know there's
[27:30] just something in us that feel so
[27:31] revived and so excited that in a way we
[27:35] don't want to go back to the mundane
[27:36] everyday after this but like our brother
[27:40] Jason specifically spoke over the
[27:42] weekend I mean it's in that every day we
[27:45] will live the Christian life it's in
[27:47] that every day I mean we our
[27:49] relationship with Christ draws us closer
[27:50] to him I'm so thankful for the services
[27:54] that we've had so far and I just thank
[27:55] the Lord for undertaking in so many ways
[27:58] and tonight we want to once again just
[28:01] come at the service into the Lord's
[28:02] hands and again before we go to brother
[28:07] a B I just want to ask if there's anyone

[28:22] are our provider you are a piece you are
[28:27] a redeemer well Jesus you're a Savior

[28:36] Father but yet the one for mysteries law
[28:39] that we are part of that and those
[28:42] attributes Lord are linked with us and
[28:46] was linked with us before the foundation
[28:49] of the earth Lord Father and we such a
[28:52] thankful people or we can just give you
[28:54] all the glory and the honor and the
[28:56] praise is father
[28:57] well Jesus I thank you for so many
[29:01] blessings Lord I thank you for keeping
[29:03] and over this weekend and over the
[29:04] services oh god I trust that people were
[29:07] blessed Lord I trusted hearts and lives
[29:10] were touched Father Lord Jesus I pray
[29:12] that you'll just give us another
[29:14] wonderful service tonight Lord Father we
[29:17] thank you for the song service we thank
[29:19] you for the time that we could worship
[29:21] you O Jesus and now we pray that you
[29:23] will come and speak to our hearts for
[29:25] Jesus break your word to us individually
[29:28] father that in a teacher that Holy
[29:30] Spirit father the one that is the
[29:33] rapture in us as we heard this morning
[29:35] our God we love you and appreciate you
[29:38] Lord we want to bring all our needs to
[29:39] you tonight
[29:40] father we lay it at your feet and trust
[29:43] you law to undertake in your own special
[29:45] way God we thank you
[29:48] we ask these things and the wonderful
[29:50] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[29:55] so now as we cut over to brother I be I
[29:58] mean I just want to say I appreciate
[30:00] brother I be we know each other for for
[30:04] many years but it's been a real blessing
[30:07] over the last year or so in the Lord
[30:09] allowed us to share our testimonies and
[30:12] get reacquainted I just really
[30:14] appreciate my brother's ministry and
[30:16] just want to say I I god bless you my
[30:20] brother and I trust that it will be a
[30:22] blessing to us tonight Amen praise the
[30:25] Lord
[30:27] amen greet you again in the wonderful
[30:30] name of our Lord Jesus Christ happy to
[30:32] be with you another occasion just to
[30:34] fellowship around the word and we know
[30:36] as we behold it we've become it so we're
[30:38] glad this evening that there's a
[30:40] Revelator here there's a Holy spirt to
[30:43] bring us into higher ground into a
[30:44] deeper anchored life with him that's
[30:47] what we trust him for not just to pass
[30:49] the time or learn something new but
[30:51] there's actually something taking place
[30:53] it's transformation and we want the
[30:55] inside to match the outside we assume
[30:58] the outside will be all liberated we'll
[31:00] be all in a new glorified state and we
[31:03] certainly want nothing to lag behind in
[31:05] the Soul realm so we're glad that the
[31:06] Word of God applies to every part and
[31:08] every facet of our lives where there's a
[31:10] soul or the body or the mind or the
[31:12] spirit wherever we find ourselves to God
[31:15] the Word of God
[31:16] has power in it to transform and to
[31:19] bring us into subjection to his will
[31:21] which is our great desire so I'd like if
[31:24] you want to read with me we'll turn to
[31:27] Romans chapter 7 for this topic another
[31:31] law within me and I guess you can
[31:34] already know which scripture I'm
[31:35] referring to Romans 7 towards the end of
[31:37] the chapter we're gonna read from verse
[31:39] 21 and verse 20 up to verse 25 the end
[31:44] of the chapter before we read let's just
[31:47] bow our heads again we thank you Lord
[31:49] Jesus for your marvelous grace for your
[31:52] goodness O Lord we are so happy to know
[31:55] you to know you in sins forgiven Lourdes
[31:58] Oh God we can confess Lord in song in in
[32:03] worship Lord with there's a melody in
[32:06] our hearts because of the grace of God
[32:08] and the free gift of God and the
[32:10] compassion of God and the election of
[32:13] God and and and here we are Lord in your
[32:16] presence one more time asking you to
[32:17] anoint us anoint our understanding open
[32:20] our eyes Lord reveal yourself unveil
[32:23] yourself in us and through us Lord in
[32:26] the power of demonstration and the Holy
[32:28] Ghost for we we love you Lord and we
[32:31] wait on you in Jesus precious name Amen
[32:33] hallelujah we're gonna read Romans 7 as
[32:37] I mentioned if you have your Bible ready
[32:40] there verse 21 well-known chapter this
[32:43] is kind of the in-between chapter
[32:44] between 6 and 8 in 8 it starts so
[32:48] there's no more condemnation in chapter
[32:50] 6 it starts with that with baptism and
[32:52] regeneration and chapter 7 you seem to
[32:55] be trapped in between but let's read
[32:56] verse 21 onwards it says Paul speaking I
[33:00] find in a law that when I would do good
[33:02] evil is present with me for I delight in
[33:06] the law of God after the inward man but
[33:08] I see another law in my members warring
[33:11] against the law of my mind and bringing
[33:13] me into captivity to the law of sin
[33:16] which is in my members so wretched man
[33:20] that I am Who Shall deliver me from the
[33:23] body of this death I thank God through
[33:26] Jesus Christ our Lord
[33:27] so then with a mind I myself
[33:30] served the law of God with a flesh the
[33:32] law of sin with the flesh the law of sin
[33:37] what a statement to make Paul saying
[33:41] that there's two laws working within him
[33:43] one law he's serving and the other law
[33:46] is subject to as well so how can you be
[33:48] subject to two laws that are so contrary
[33:51] to each other
[33:52] it seems to me we kind of tear you apart
[33:55] and that's why sometimes we find a whole
[33:58] lot of neurotics and the Christian
[33:59] circles because we have this desire to
[34:02] please God we have the desire to live
[34:04] for God we have the desire to manifest
[34:05] these word and we find ourselves so
[34:08] often coming short of that desire and
[34:10] falling short of what we want to achieve
[34:12] for him I want to start this little
[34:15] service you think I'm just going to talk
[34:17] about the law of spurtin life really
[34:20] we're not too worried about the law of
[34:21] sin and death we were familiar with that
[34:23] one it works in our bodies every day it
[34:26] makes us tired makes us weary drags us
[34:28] down
[34:29] sometimes even oppresses us and we have
[34:32] to realize that that is sometimes
[34:34] allowed by God as Paul said there's a
[34:36] messenger of Satan for each one of us
[34:38] buffeting that has to take place in
[34:41] order to keep us in the right shape so
[34:43] we understand those things but we never
[34:45] have to make peace with anything for me
[34:47] if I can find a verse in the Bible if I
[34:51] find a quote in the message where it
[34:53] declares my Liberty that I'm willing to
[34:55] stand with that you know even if I can't
[34:58] see it straight away I'm still gonna
[34:59] believe it and confess it anyhow there's
[35:01] one little thing I want to start off
[35:03] with it's kind of set the theme for the
[35:05] service and that is found in the message
[35:07] called Abraham 1955 the Prophet says and
[35:10] if you ever go in the rapture you're
[35:13] going to have to have the same spirit in
[35:16] you that was in Jesus Christ
[35:18] that's God's covenant with his church
[35:22] remember the Covenant is all about
[35:24] coming together the Covenant when they
[35:27] made the covenant they tore it apart and
[35:29] when that covenant is too fulfilled it
[35:32] has to come together and dovetail fit
[35:34] perfectly one with the other so when God
[35:38] made the covenant the Covenant the the
[35:41] part that has to fit with his covenant
[35:43] the spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[35:46] sometimes we even as Christians we think
[35:49] sort of of the Holy Ghost is another
[35:51] spirit another spirit oh it's the
[35:54] feminine part of God we kind of want to
[35:56] divorce the tooth
[35:57] you can't this feminine part was in
[36:00] Jesus Christ it only came out of him at
[36:02] Calvary so the masculine the feminine
[36:04] both in Christ you were in Christ your
[36:07] spirit was in Christ so the Spirit was
[36:10] in Christ has to be in the believer
[36:11] that's why Jesus made those statements
[36:14] the works that I do shall you do and so
[36:17] forth you do also we are facing the
[36:20] final deliverance the final chapter from
[36:23] the law of sin and death after this the
[36:27] law of sin death will have no more hold
[36:29] on us it will not influence us and we
[36:33] can't discourage us it can hurt us in
[36:35] any way shape or form that's why it's so
[36:38] marvelous even to get older in life
[36:40] because you realize the hold even as
[36:44] your body gets more frail and more
[36:46] subject to things you realize the hold
[36:48] of death slipping it's slipping because
[36:51] for you that day when you cross over is
[36:54] your liberation day it's not death
[36:56] doesn't have a sting there's there's no
[36:59] nothing there to scare you death is just
[37:01] a servant to bring you into the presence
[37:03] of God so it's it's not really something
[37:06] to be afraid of but we're facing that
[37:09] final deliverance and of course also for
[37:10] younger people we're talking about a
[37:12] rapture we're talking about the body
[37:13] change for me the achievement of
[37:16] Easter is what Jesus said in the this
[37:19] little line he said because I live you
[37:21] live also because he rose who we rise
[37:24] also because he died we died also
[37:28] so everything that he went through that
[37:31] spirit is in him is in us and there's
[37:33] actually no room for another spirit
[37:35] there we contend with that other law we
[37:39] contend with the carnal nature but that
[37:41] is a temporary thing a temporary thing
[37:44] like an irritation to form and shape the
[37:46] pearl in the oyster just something is
[37:48] here for now but their real life your
[37:51] real life your real substance we know is
[37:53] the same life that was in Jesus Christ
[37:55] that walked on this earth
[37:56] already so we obey the law of sin and
[38:00] death as Paul says there he wasn't
[38:02] talking about unbelievers that's under
[38:04] the law of son death he was talking
[38:06] about Christians that still have that
[38:08] law of sin and death you still get sick
[38:10] you still get discouraged you still
[38:12] sometimes lose your temper your body is
[38:14] getting older there's nothing you can do
[38:16] about that he said well that's not
[38:18] according to the Word of God it says we
[38:19] are eternal creatures but your body
[38:21] doesn't agree with that it's subject to
[38:24] another law and you can maxfactor as
[38:26] much as you want you can nip and tuck
[38:28] and squeeze as much as you want this
[38:30] whole body is going to get older you're
[38:34] just trying to fool yourself
[38:35] so you're subject to the law of sin and
[38:38] death but it is involuntary it's
[38:41] involuntary I'm sure nobody wants to get
[38:43] old nobody wants to go into that frail
[38:46] state nobody wants to do something wrong
[38:48] once you've received the Holy Ghost and
[38:50] that's why the Bible speaks about
[38:51] sinning willfully and remember sin is
[38:54] unbelief
[38:55] disbelieving willfully Hebrews 10 verse
[38:58] 26 says for if we sin willfully if we
[39:02] disbelieve willfully after that we have
[39:05] received the knowledge of the truth and
[39:07] take care brother Brennan said there you
[39:09] haven't received the truth you've just
[39:11] received the knowledge of the truth the
[39:13] truth is a spirit jesus said I am the
[39:16] truth he called the Holy Ghost the
[39:18] Spirit of Truth I will lead you into all
[39:20] truth so if you've received that spirit
[39:22] you can't lose it again but this is not
[39:25] receiving this spur just receiving the
[39:26] knowledge of the truth others if you're
[39:28] presented with the truth and you decide
[39:31] willfully to disbelieve it he says there
[39:34] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins now
[39:37] that sounds like you can only hear the
[39:39] gospel once but that's not what it's
[39:41] saying it's not what it's saying yeah
[39:43] you actually have to receive the
[39:44] knowledge of the truth in other words
[39:46] you have to be you have to realize this
[39:48] is the truth you have to realize this is
[39:50] the truth but you're turning it down
[39:52] that is that is disbelieving it
[39:55] willfully remember also the Prophet
[39:59] illustrated to us there's something just
[40:01] involuntary like if you are frying bacon
[40:04] in the pan and the grease would jump up
[40:06] on your hand and you would not fear it
[40:10] you wouldn't get burnt it's the fear
[40:12] that burns you but you say I can't help
[40:15] but fear there's no time there to debate
[40:17] and say oh well I just believe there's a
[40:19] promise for me I'm gonna buy that time
[40:21] it's too late right the grease jumps
[40:23] pretty quickly and there's no time for
[40:25] you to walk around with some iron and
[40:26] steel we'll nerves to say I'm not gonna
[40:29] be scared when that grease jumps out
[40:30] it's just something that happens
[40:32] automatically so that's why I say
[40:34] involuntarily we are subject to the law
[40:37] of sin and death but if there was no
[40:40] fear there you say how can there be no
[40:42] fear that's when God anoints a person
[40:44] like Daniel in the lion's den why
[40:46] couldn't those Lions get at him because
[40:49] there was no fear the Bible tells us
[40:50] perfect love drives out all fear so the
[40:55] perfect love is what it's the Holy Ghost
[40:57] so the Holy Ghost in you God can press
[41:00] it so strong that there's no fear and we
[41:03] remember Paul and the sand a snake on
[41:05] the island that bit him he had no fear
[41:07] at all why because he already had a Holy
[41:09] Ghost revelation that he was going to
[41:11] appear in Rome so that snake could not
[41:14] harm Paul and he could shake it off into
[41:16] the fire shows you that it's the fear
[41:18] that hurts you but that fear you can't
[41:20] suppress with your willpower
[41:22] so it takes God to anoint a person to be
[41:25] fearless so therefore we are subject to
[41:31] that law of sin and death that law that
[41:34] of fear that will hurt us and it's an
[41:38] automatic thing and we can't help that
[41:40] now brother Brennan says this is a
[41:42] beautiful message one of my absolute
[41:44] favorites called
[41:44] the fundamental foundation for faith if
[41:48] you want a real revival just gonna
[41:50] listen to the whole thing he talks in
[41:53] there and it says about this is now
[41:55] Satan Satan by the laws of sin and death
[41:59] makes everything makes everything that
[42:02] sin and death bought operate to Satan
[42:07] sends a cancer now remember a cancer is
[42:10] a demon life it's a foreign life that
[42:13] comes into your body say but I didn't
[42:15] even notice it exactly that's why I say
[42:18] it is mostly involuntary
[42:23] with cancer all right so Satan sends a
[42:25] cancer the man recognized it receives it
[42:28] Satan sends heart aches heart aches so a
[42:32] way I can't help you mean I'm not
[42:34] supposed to feel sad no actually the
[42:38] Bible speaks about joy and the swapping
[42:40] your sadness and your garment of
[42:42] heaviness for a garment of praise and so
[42:44] forth the Bible doesn't make room and
[42:46] say now you need to be sad that's not
[42:48] one of the fruits is for I look at
[42:50] Galatians 5:22 there's no sadness there
[42:52] you know so what is that a fruit
[42:55] obviously but I can't help being sad
[42:57] like if you lose a loved one or you go
[43:00] through a traumatic experience or
[43:02] something happens and you feel sad
[43:04] exactly but that is the devil that's the
[43:08] devil sends heartaches he says we
[43:11] recognize it and receive it maybe you
[43:13] never thought about it that way maybe
[43:15] you never thought about that depression
[43:16] that comes on you that way but that's
[43:18] something that the devil sends and you
[43:20] recognize it and receive it and he makes
[43:22] it work he says and if Satan by his
[43:24] power can make his laws work in man now
[43:27] you say well we ought to be at a place
[43:29] where we can resist that and Paul is
[43:31] speaking about deliverance here yeah he
[43:33] speaks about deliverance but we do not
[43:34] operate that law of spirit and life God
[43:37] operates that law as much as Satan
[43:40] operates the law of sin and death but it
[43:42] needs a bedding ground we receive
[43:44] negative input from the devil and we
[43:48] just put up with it naturally because
[43:51] that just seems to be the course of life
[43:53] and everybody goes through that and
[43:55] we're supposed to go through that so we
[43:57] had we don't receive an automatic
[43:59] immunization against the cares of this
[44:02] life we don't otherwise we would not
[44:05] need comfort otherwise we would not need
[44:07] faith otherwise we would not operate
[44:09] half the gifts that God has given us we
[44:12] wouldn't need them in fact we wouldn't
[44:15] be any there wouldn't be any reason for
[44:17] us to stay in earth and we might as well
[44:19] walk home but we have those weaknesses
[44:22] we have those flaws in order for a
[44:25] deeper revelation of God because how can
[44:27] he comfort you if you're never sorrow
[44:29] hmm
[44:30] how can he soothe you if you never have
[44:32] pain how can he heal you if you're never
[44:34] sick
[44:36] how can he save you how can he forgive
[44:38] you so all those things are necessary
[44:41] and is allowed by God that law of sin
[44:44] and death but that's not where the story
[44:46] ends praise God
[44:48] as if Satan by his power can make his
[44:51] laws work in man how much more ought God
[44:55] with his power make his laws work in man
[44:59] if Satan can make his laws be sure and
[45:02] us recognize it right how much more Oh
[45:07] God
[45:08] to his children to make his laws be
[45:11] recognized among his people of divine
[45:15] healing a revelation power gifts
[45:19] manifestations of the Spirit the laws
[45:22] the gifts fruits from God the
[45:25] manifestations from God there are they
[45:28] are more real than these things that so
[45:31] naturally beset us now the law of sin
[45:35] and death works in the people he says
[45:37] and the law of Liberty of Christ has
[45:42] come unto us to set us free from those
[45:46] things to set us free from those things
[45:49] hmm so sure there's a war going on but
[45:53] it's not a losing battle it's not a
[45:55] retreat in fact we are invited onto the
[45:58] battlefield with the assurance of
[46:00] victory because he is the mighty
[46:02] Conqueror and he's word declares that we
[46:05] are more than conquerors
[46:08] so I believe this with all my heart I
[46:11] believe and we're nearing the age praise
[46:14] God I believe we're here that when
[46:16] people are going to recognize these
[46:18] things what God preached in the message
[46:21] in 1955 is being recognized now in 2020
[46:26] that's the Marvel of it there are still
[46:28] hearts that have not grown weary there
[46:31] are still people who are not thinking
[46:33] the Lord as the ladies coming they're
[46:35] not thinking like that there are still
[46:37] young people there are still children
[46:39] that God is calling into this message
[46:42] they not of the opinion that it's past
[46:45] and this old hat and it's over there and
[46:48] it was it was it is a
[46:49] run out of steam Minh and so forth it is
[46:52] stronger now than ever because we are
[46:54] closer to the goal now it says where
[46:58] people are going to recognize these
[46:59] things that we've had so much vain
[47:01] philosophy home brother and so forth and
[47:04] teachings that ought not to be until it
[47:06] is set the human mind to a revolution of
[47:09] thinking on matters of this and that and
[47:11] taking it away from the Word of God hmm
[47:14] said as I've said faith doesn't come by
[47:17] fasting faith doesn't come by praying
[47:19] reading a book all of that's good
[47:22] fasting praying and reading a book but
[47:23] faith comes by a settled something
[47:26] that's in the human heart that tells you
[47:28] that tells you faith has a voice faith
[47:31] has a testimony faith has a has a power
[47:34] the Bible calls it a still small voice
[47:37] but let me tell you there's nothing more
[47:39] powerful than that still small voice it
[47:42] might just be an impression sometimes
[47:44] and a little dim something as brother
[47:46] Branham calls it but I believe that
[47:48] faith has power in it to accomplish the
[47:51] impossible as he said to bring things
[47:53] when there are no things to be brought
[47:55] faith creates faith make something from
[47:58] nothing that's what faith can do it's a
[48:02] settled something in the human heart
[48:05] just as sure as you can come to this
[48:07] church and I says when you come home you
[48:08] told your wife you'd be home after the
[48:10] service was over you do that
[48:11] unconsciously you just go out and get in
[48:14] your car and go on home just now you
[48:18] could not do it unless you have faith
[48:21] you could do it I wonder if we grasp
[48:23] that principle we just take it for
[48:28] granted we just don't even think about
[48:29] it I'm going to do this I'm going to the
[48:32] store quickly you wouldn't be able to go
[48:34] to the store unless you believed you
[48:35] could I wonder if we grasp that I wonder
[48:40] since you'd never move from where you're
[48:42] sitting if you didn't have faith that
[48:45] you could raise up isn't that marvelous
[48:49] you know I thought about this a little
[48:51] bit and you realize no baby is born
[48:54] walking but the moment from when they
[48:59] can't walk the wind they can walk
[49:02] you can't tell the difference in their
[49:03] muscle strength in their legs or their
[49:07] ability to balance or whatever it might
[49:09] be there's just confidence see because
[49:11] they were made to walk and now they
[49:13] believe they can because they've been
[49:15] encouraged so much they walk with the
[49:18] same little wobbly legs they had a 5
[49:20] seconds before this couldn't walk so
[49:23] there's a whole lot of faith involved in
[49:25] things we just do they also say that
[49:29] there are cases where people who have
[49:31] brain damaged and they were paralyzed or
[49:34] have a arm that can't move and they get
[49:37] brain damage and all of a sudden they
[49:39] can walk because they're not thinking
[49:41] about it anymore they're not convinced
[49:43] that they can't walk and it's did the
[49:45] nerve suddenly turn on there was just a
[49:50] blockage removed in the brain now look
[49:57] what he says here says you'd never move
[49:59] from where you're sitting if you didn't
[50:00] have faith you could raise up but you've
[50:01] done it so much and you just become so
[50:03] accustomed to those laws till it's a
[50:06] natural thing a natural thing hmm just
[50:11] now if we could throw if we could throw
[50:17] ourselves completely to God and to his
[50:20] will and be lost to our own thoughts and
[50:22] just let the mind of Christ be in us
[50:25] then same operations of the Spirit would
[50:30] work through us just as the natural
[50:33] thing does oh my goodness
[50:35] this is like radical radical just like
[50:41] the natural things we don't even think
[50:43] about it and we ought not even to think
[50:47] about healing right just the natural
[50:50] thing because we've do it we've done it
[50:52] so many times
[50:53] lay their hands on the sick and they
[50:54] shall recover don't think twice about it
[50:56] just walk on you're expecting it to
[51:00] happen because it's happened so many
[51:02] times hmm why you think God sends those
[51:05] things into our families sicknesses and
[51:06] so forth and you have to pray for your
[51:08] own kids and cast the devil out when
[51:10] they when he's trying to suffocate them
[51:13] in some asthma or something try and take
[51:15] their life
[51:16] and you get your righteous indignation
[51:17] up like Shamgar did and you stand in the
[51:19] gap for that kid and you see what
[51:21] happens and you think that God that did
[51:24] that over there is the same God in the
[51:26] situation I'm in right now you see you
[51:29] become practiced in the supernatural
[51:32] we're talking about a law see for me a
[51:35] law is a certainty and as sure as we
[51:38] have laws in this world in the natural
[51:40] and we have laws in the in the natural
[51:43] world that that limit or or regulate the
[51:49] way things work in this world was as
[51:51] sure as we have those laws there are
[51:53] laws in the spiritual just the same and
[51:56] there is within you if you are a
[51:59] Christian if you have the Holy Spirit
[52:01] there is within you a law of spirit and
[52:05] life and there are somebody to enforce
[52:08] that law if the devil can enforce his
[52:10] law you think God can't enforce his law
[52:13] sure and he's law he spelled out for us
[52:16] in his word and it's not thou shalt not
[52:18] kill it's they shall lay their hands on
[52:20] the sick and they shall recover these
[52:21] signs shall follow them to belief that's
[52:23] the kind of law we're talking about
[52:25] every word of God every promise he made
[52:28] that's part of his expression part of
[52:30] his law and the Holy Ghost is there to
[52:33] make that real to enforce it that's
[52:36] exactly what the kingdom of God is the
[52:38] word of God made power so till it's the
[52:42] natural thing or I said we can throw
[52:43] ourselves completely to God then same
[52:44] operations of the Spirit would work
[52:45] through us just as the natural things do
[52:48] just the same thing because we were
[52:51] first created before the fall for the
[52:54] purpose to control to rule and to praise
[52:58] God and to live for God how about that
[53:00] huh you want a commission you want to
[53:02] pay degree you want to know where you
[53:04] come from where your roots are where
[53:06] they're those are your roots you were
[53:08] created for the purpose to control to
[53:10] rule and to praise and live for God
[53:13] that's your purpose and if there's
[53:15] anything standing in your way well
[53:17] that's what Easter means to me we can
[53:19] say we can take up that sword of the
[53:21] Spirit we can take up every promise of
[53:23] God's Word and we're gonna hack our way
[53:25] through to get to what we ought to be
[53:27] God's law in nature makes the springtime
[53:29] every year
[53:30] season of spring right now a restoration
[53:33] that's what it is his law is inevitable
[53:38] inevitable it creates the conditions for
[53:41] the change of the renewal in other words
[53:43] because God ordained those flowers to
[53:46] grow he is obligated to create the
[53:49] conditions for those flowers to grow God
[53:52] cannot create something and then it just
[53:53] goes to waste then he's not God there's
[53:55] no what he's doing
[53:56] but he's on mission knows all things
[53:58] therefore if there's any expression in
[54:01] him he has to make a provision for that
[54:05] expression oh my goodness I wonder if we
[54:09] understand that principle his law other
[54:12] words is inevitable you cannot stop the
[54:16] law of God God's law of the Spirit
[54:20] brings forth renewal in our time right
[54:24] now picking off exactly on schedule
[54:26] there's nothing holding it back the
[54:28] world is going one way and the bride's
[54:31] going the other way and that's God's law
[54:33] working God's law working it's not
[54:35] because we're a better bunch than the
[54:37] Lutheran's we're a better bunch than the
[54:39] Wesleyan no sir I think we're a worse
[54:41] Bunch than all of them put together but
[54:44] God's law can't be defeated God's law is
[54:47] marching towards that rapture can't be
[54:50] stopped and the whole world will be
[54:52] brought into the chaos is supposed to be
[54:54] in just to allow God's law to be
[54:57] fulfilled exactly unschedule just let
[55:01] that law operate in you said oh my see
[55:04] there's nothing for us to work up or
[55:06] press into I'm gonna move on to the next
[55:08] quote here says brother Brennan says
[55:10] there was a law in Christ that law is in
[55:14] men he's talking about regenerated many
[55:17] Christians says you can bury him in the
[55:19] deepest grave or the deepest sea or the
[55:22] lowest lowest hell there's a law of the
[55:25] Spirit of God that will raise him up
[55:28] again see because a bird has a law now
[55:33] its body is material its earthbound in
[55:36] other words heavier than air right sits
[55:38] on the earth here but it has a law
[55:40] within it that the way it spreads its
[55:43] wings it can
[55:44] fly plumb out of sight that's against
[55:47] science they claim its earthbound
[55:49] gravitation has to hold it here but it
[55:52] can defy gravitation lift itself right
[55:55] off of it and go ride on out there's a
[55:59] law in it oh my this is because because
[56:06] it has to put that law that's in it to
[56:09] work and it's built to possess that law
[56:12] oh my a Christian every son or daughter
[56:15] of God is built to possess that law of
[56:19] spirit in life you're built for it made
[56:21] for it that bird doesn't have to go to
[56:23] school it just has to eat and grow
[56:25] that's all it has to do and that law of
[56:28] the bird life inside of it will
[56:30] eventually make it take off the earth
[56:32] what about the son and daughter of God
[56:34] all you have to do is feed grow strong
[56:37] or believe move on with the Lord
[56:39] Fellowship and what happens you are you
[56:42] are ordained to own that law of a son
[56:45] and daughter of God it will go in a
[56:46] rapture he says now I'm beginning to
[56:50] feel religious now we have a law the law
[56:52] of the life in us the only thing you
[56:54] have to do you are made and born and
[56:56] placed here in the body of Christ as
[56:59] sons and daughters of God you don't have
[57:01] to knuckle down to the devil there it is
[57:03] you don't have to knuckle down to the
[57:05] devil and sure as that law of the devil
[57:08] is working in your members is another
[57:10] law working in your heart and in your
[57:11] soul that supersedes anything that that
[57:14] law can put on you because when you let
[57:17] go and let God that's all see oh huh let
[57:20] go and let God
[57:25] yep he says if the fish said oh did I
[57:32] skip that one yes so sorry if the fish
[57:35] said I just read it to you anyway hope
[57:37] we were listening
[57:37] if the fish said wait I'll catch my
[57:40] breath real good I'll breathe up a
[57:42] little oxygen in me now see if I can go
[57:44] down no if he does that he'll burst open
[57:47] see in other words the interference of
[57:52] intellect the interference of reasoning
[57:56] or trying to understand how
[57:58] things work now as much as we appreciate
[58:01] that principle he Illustrated when he
[58:03] said you come to church by faith and go
[58:04] home by faith and so forth you can't you
[58:07] can't imprint that enough on a person
[58:10] with the supernatural because the
[58:12] supernatural comes from God so we're not
[58:14] going to go around and commit all sorts
[58:16] of witchcraft and so forth because we
[58:18] want to manipulate the supernatural
[58:20] that's not how it works
[58:22] Jesus said the son can do nothing in
[58:25] himself what he sees the father doing in
[58:27] other words he spirit-led to do miracles
[58:31] he didn't go around randomly doing stuff
[58:33] to prove anything so the bird says I'll
[58:36] see how fast I can run down here and
[58:38] maybe I'll take off no he won't do it
[58:40] he'll fall down see he's got to know how
[58:43] to control how that law can control him
[58:47] see the difference there not him
[58:49] controlling the law but the laws in him
[58:51] is bigger than him and it controls him
[58:54] that means yielding he said let go and
[58:58] let God have his wonderful way she's in
[59:00] the same way it is with us it isn't what
[59:04] we fight and pull and hurry and oh if I
[59:06] don't get this and I don't get that
[59:07] that's not it is to know that the law of
[59:11] life is in you and you just let go and
[59:15] let God then he takes you to your
[59:19] healing huh how about that
[59:21] not you fighting your way to your
[59:22] healing and I know we got quotes and so
[59:24] forth says you have to fight or or your
[59:26] way with the fight is to let go let your
[59:28] little hands off so God can lead you
[59:31] remember what the Holy Ghost was given
[59:33] for Jesus and brother Brennan said the
[59:36] only scriptural evidence of the Holy
[59:38] Ghost is what that he will lead you into
[59:40] all truth now that doesn't mean he makes
[59:43] you intellectual and clever and so you
[59:45] can explain all the mysteries truth is
[59:47] the manifestation of God's Word in flesh
[59:50] that's truth yes sir jesus said I am the
[59:54] truth I am the truth of what God said
[59:56] way back and even when he said thy seed
[59:58] shall bruise the head of the serpent I
[1:00:00] am the truth of that I'm the
[1:00:01] manifestation of that so what does the
[1:00:03] Holy Spirit do it manifests the promises
[1:00:06] of God and the Word of God in you
[1:00:08] or body that's what it does that's truth
[1:00:11] and that's the only evidence there is
[1:00:13] that you have the Holy Ghost because you
[1:00:15] will be led into all truth not some not
[1:00:19] most but all in other words simple terms
[1:00:24] in Noah's day you would have walked into
[1:00:26] the ark that's it that was the truth in
[1:00:29] Noah's day so if Noah didn't have to
[1:00:35] study to get a degree and the elephant
[1:00:37] didn't have to study to get a degree in
[1:00:39] order to pass into the ark with an exam
[1:00:42] we don't have to either just that's just
[1:00:46] on the side there's no message degrees
[1:00:48] anyway so let me finish what he said
[1:00:53] there that you know the law of life's
[1:00:56] right and letting go of God we did
[1:00:58] finish it letting go letting God take
[1:01:01] control he leads you to your healing he
[1:01:04] leads you he takes you through the
[1:01:06] baptism of the Spirit there he says it
[1:01:07] or anything that he's promised any
[1:01:10] promise of God he needs to lead you to
[1:01:13] it which means you have to let go just
[1:01:16] say Lord I know it's there I receive it
[1:01:19] because I met your requirements
[1:01:21] therefore you said I'll get the Spirit
[1:01:24] of Truth in me now leave me Lord which
[1:01:28] is the higher law simple question the
[1:01:30] law of sin and death or the law of
[1:01:32] Spurlin life and all everybody will
[1:01:34] shout the spirit of life or the law of
[1:01:38] spurtin life the higher law sure it is
[1:01:41] but sometimes it feels like where's more
[1:01:43] subject to the spirit of the law of
[1:01:47] death and sin and we are to the law of
[1:01:50] spirit in life it seems that way brother
[1:01:53] Branham says in questions and answers 59
[1:01:55] says Paul said my flesh wants to yield
[1:01:59] to that in other words to the wrong your
[1:02:02] flesh does to see but the law of the
[1:02:05] Spirit of God in the heart overcomes the
[1:02:08] flesh and makes the body obey what the
[1:02:11] heart says do I can't overemphasize that
[1:02:14] it what it's that spirit of life in you
[1:02:18] that Spirit of God in you that overcomes
[1:02:22] this body and takes it to church whether
[1:02:24] you feel like it or not well in this
[1:02:26] case I guess takes you to fellowship
[1:02:28] whether you feel like it or not you say
[1:02:29] well I don't always feel like
[1:02:31] fellowshipping with God that's true your
[1:02:33] carnal mind cannot even contact God it's
[1:02:36] got a little imagination Department it
[1:02:38] sort of conjures up a good old father
[1:02:39] sitting up in the chair somewhere there
[1:02:41] in the heavens it's about the best you
[1:02:44] can do you cannot contact God with your
[1:02:47] intellect cannot touch God with your
[1:02:50] intellect at all it's the soul is only
[1:02:52] the sixth sense that can contact God so
[1:02:55] your mind can easily get bored in a
[1:02:58] service and suddenly you feel very
[1:03:00] unspiritual huh
[1:03:02] why is my mind wandering okay because
[1:03:07] there's another law operating in your
[1:03:08] mind but there's a law operating in your
[1:03:11] soul you see in what your heart says do
[1:03:14] that's the one that dominates your life
[1:03:17] yes sir that's a real Christian you say
[1:03:20] Lord let that heart dominate my life not
[1:03:24] this old little intellect it's gonna
[1:03:25] pass anyway just look then if it'll do
[1:03:29] that if it'll do that for a sinner in
[1:03:32] other words it'll save him then won't
[1:03:34] that work for sickness too you got to
[1:03:37] think about it if God saved you you are
[1:03:39] entitled to healing just as much the law
[1:03:42] of the Spirit of God in the heart that
[1:03:44] knows that by His stripes we were healed
[1:03:46] look at that
[1:03:46] not doesn't have to quote it and pip
[1:03:49] itself up and try and work itself up
[1:03:50] into an emotional standpoint it knows it
[1:03:53] knows by stripes I'm healed I don't have
[1:03:57] to fuss about it I don't have to shout
[1:03:59] about it I know it it's mine it's part
[1:04:03] of my makeups is they stand with their
[1:04:05] power and make that sickness in that
[1:04:07] body obey them because it's a devil that
[1:04:11] sickness is a devil one of the best ways
[1:04:13] for the devil to hide is to tell you
[1:04:16] it's just a natural thing there are no
[1:04:18] natural things okay newsflash
[1:04:22] there are no natural things there are
[1:04:23] two powers at work in this world one is
[1:04:26] God ones the devil there's no in-between
[1:04:28] ground there's no neutral ground
[1:04:30] nothing is neutral the law of sin and
[1:04:35] death is
[1:04:36] working in this all of creation right
[1:04:37] now any tree out there can't live
[1:04:39] forever any blade of grass will fail why
[1:04:43] because there's a law that limits its
[1:04:45] time on this earth and that's not right
[1:04:48] that's not right they say well what is
[1:04:52] stronger well certainly the law of God
[1:04:54] is stronger because all these things
[1:04:55] will pass away but there is brother
[1:04:59] Brennan said whenever you see his tree
[1:05:00] struggling down here it shows you
[1:05:02] there's one there that doesn't have to
[1:05:04] struggle because this is just a
[1:05:06] reflection of what's eternal anyhow now
[1:05:10] that law of life here's the good news
[1:05:13] you can't lose it just as the same as
[1:05:16] the law of sin and death you are born
[1:05:19] with it actually it shapes you before
[1:05:22] you even born you're born with it you
[1:05:24] live your whole little carnal life with
[1:05:26] it till you die and drop in the grave
[1:05:28] and then that law is still working to
[1:05:29] decompose you into ashes and dust but
[1:05:34] the good news is that law of spirit and
[1:05:36] life doesn't leave you either it's
[1:05:41] permanent and here's from a true Easter
[1:05:44] seal brother Brennan says oh the
[1:05:47] memorial of Easter those that are sealed
[1:05:50] away by the Holy Spirit now at even gate
[1:05:52] man was sealed away from God at
[1:05:56] Pentecost he was eternally sealed into
[1:06:00] God Pentecost he goes in or out no more
[1:06:06] he's there for good he's there for good
[1:06:10] you are sealed into that place for good
[1:06:13] says look one spirt were baptized into
[1:06:16] one body by the Holy Ghost that right
[1:06:17] then we are sealed until how long
[1:06:19] through the day of your Redemption if
[1:06:22] they have your redemption of course the
[1:06:23] changing in the body now he is coming
[1:06:28] back for his own spirit nothing else he
[1:06:32] is not going to rapture anything that's
[1:06:34] good or almost there or he's coming back
[1:06:38] for his spirit
[1:06:39] there's no attachments to the body of
[1:06:42] Christ it's a whole complete unit every
[1:06:46] cell there is accounted for and had
[1:06:49] purpose and is unique and can't be
[1:06:51] replaced and forced part of that body
[1:06:54] and that's what he's coming for the life
[1:06:56] in that body let me just get for you
[1:07:00] where I'm quoting from the message faith
[1:07:02] he says a brother the only way in the
[1:07:04] world that the Covenant will ever be
[1:07:07] kept is when you and I receive the
[1:07:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost that God tore
[1:07:12] Christ apart and sent the Holy Ghost
[1:07:14] down for you and I the same spirt the
[1:07:19] only way we will be able to go up in the
[1:07:21] rapture is when that body comes to
[1:07:23] receive the spirit again the raptured
[1:07:25] people that's in the Covenant I hope you
[1:07:27] realize you see what's going on there
[1:07:29] the dovetailing they're coming together
[1:07:31] because where is your body right now
[1:07:33] well beyond the curtain of time you see
[1:07:36] sure that word body you see now the body
[1:07:39] of Christ on a larger scale is a body
[1:07:42] also and that spirit was in that body is
[1:07:45] where right now
[1:07:46] in you so that body comes down to meet
[1:07:49] the spirt that is the dovetailing
[1:07:51] there's the going together so we need to
[1:07:55] recognize that the spirit in you is not
[1:07:57] a secondary spirit it's not a weaker
[1:07:59] spirit it is the spirit that raised
[1:08:01] Jesus from the dead it is the spirit of
[1:08:04] said peace be still it is the spirit
[1:08:06] that said Lazarus come forth the same
[1:08:08] spurred Wells in you and me in every
[1:08:11] believer and the only way will go in a
[1:08:14] rapture is because that's burden that
[1:08:16] body has to come together because god
[1:08:19] toward that spirit out of Christ and put
[1:08:21] it into the church the Covenant is the
[1:08:25] circumcision by the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:26] Ghost that's Abraham's seed this one
[1:08:31] wishes faith effort from that time he
[1:08:32] said he's got to be the same Holy Spirit
[1:08:34] that dwelt in Christ and when the
[1:08:36] rapture comes when that body comes he's
[1:08:38] bride that was tore from him or the Holy
[1:08:41] Ghost will bring that bride just exactly
[1:08:44] dovetail right into the body of Jesus
[1:08:46] Christ remember the man or God is a male
[1:08:51] and a female in one body because when he
[1:08:53] made Adam that's how he made him was a
[1:08:56] male and a female in one body so that
[1:09:00] body that
[1:09:02] bride that was torn from him in other
[1:09:05] words the spirit the feminine spirit
[1:09:07] part of God it was torn from him and
[1:09:09] placed in the church has to dovetail and
[1:09:12] come back and make one you can see why
[1:09:14] Satan loves divorce why he loves to
[1:09:18] split up a husband and a wife because
[1:09:20] Paul even said it's a mystery I show you
[1:09:22] a mystery is Christ in the church is
[1:09:24] when a husband and a wife get married
[1:09:28] and become one and Satan loves a high
[1:09:30] divorce rate I'm sure he's having a ball
[1:09:32] right now with a high divorce rate
[1:09:35] because people can't live with each
[1:09:36] other but it just shows you there's a
[1:09:40] fault there's a fake Union a false Union
[1:09:42] there but we leave that for another time
[1:09:44] so the covenant the agreement made when
[1:09:47] Abraham was put asleep remember when God
[1:09:49] confirmed this covenant and the Old
[1:09:51] Testament way of confirming the Covenant
[1:09:53] they had the true the car the contract
[1:09:55] they toured the piece to 2 pieces and
[1:09:57] they had to dovetail when they got back
[1:09:58] together again and of course the
[1:10:00] carcasses that were slain they're
[1:10:01] dividing of the sacrifices all showed
[1:10:04] Christ it's actually four shadows so
[1:10:07] what he made there with Abraham he
[1:10:09] actually did on Calvary God making a
[1:10:12] covenant with all of mankind on Calvary
[1:10:15] where he tore the sacrifice in two and
[1:10:22] to me you know the natural laws that we
[1:10:25] find are so fixed that we can't avoid
[1:10:29] them when God said let there be light
[1:10:32] guess what they're still light we can't
[1:10:34] turn it off and when God said let every
[1:10:37] seed bring forth of its kind etc all
[1:10:39] those things of God and what did he do
[1:10:40] he just spoke them but when he made his
[1:10:42] covenant on the law of the Spirit he
[1:10:46] took an oath
[1:10:46] he didn't just speak it to Abraham he
[1:10:49] actually made a contract he made it sure
[1:10:52] he took an oath that he was going or he
[1:10:55] was already did actually perform it
[1:10:58] before there was a world God making a
[1:11:00] covenant brother Brown says showing or
[1:11:03] pre showing that's just the animals I
[1:11:08] swore that I'll do it in your seat I'll
[1:11:12] bless all the nations the world's is
[1:11:13] read it but I'll bless the Gentiles our
[1:11:15] best a black man yellow
[1:11:16] man white man I'll bless everyone
[1:11:18] through your seat for out of you will
[1:11:19] come kings and princes how are you going
[1:11:21] to do it Lord I'll show you how and when
[1:11:24] he showed him how he put him to sleep to
[1:11:26] make sure he was not gonna interfere
[1:11:27] because this is a law this is the law of
[1:11:30] God is going to operate it's going to
[1:11:32] express itself and Abraham being a good
[1:11:34] man no doubt he could not express that
[1:11:37] law he was just subject to the law of
[1:11:39] sin and death so here God was going to
[1:11:42] do it all himself
[1:11:43] he said he shown him on the hillside
[1:11:45] where those pieces represented in any
[1:11:47] Bible scholar here knows that each one
[1:11:49] of those were clean animals it
[1:11:51] represented the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:11:52] Christ he was the RAM he was the heifer
[1:11:55] that made the waters of separation when
[1:11:57] you had the waters of separation through
[1:11:59] now we have the washing by the water by
[1:12:02] the word of the separation from sin
[1:12:04] through the word through believing and
[1:12:05] the pigeon and the turtle dove was
[1:12:07] divine healing that all in Christ isn't
[1:12:11] there God showed Abraham what he was
[1:12:12] going to do that through the seed of
[1:12:14] Isaac he would bring forth his only
[1:12:16] begotten son Christ and was slain yonder
[1:12:20] does all those sacrifices each one
[1:12:22] pointed to Calvary so I say that was a
[1:12:25] foreshadow of the Covenant the real
[1:12:27] covenant was confirmed on Golgotha on
[1:12:30] Calvary's Hill now watch watch what he's
[1:12:35] going to say says he would bring forth
[1:12:36] his only begotten Son Christ was slain
[1:12:38] yonder between the heavens and the earth
[1:12:40] when the Sun went down and blackness
[1:12:42] over the earth and he's there he tore
[1:12:44] him apart God pulled his soul out of him
[1:12:49] God that's pretty vivid image for me God
[1:12:54] pulled his soul out of him hmm and he
[1:12:59] wrote a covenant with the families of
[1:13:02] the earth when that precious
[1:13:04] unadulterated blood of Almighty God
[1:13:07] dripping from Emmanuel's veins he tore
[1:13:09] that soul out of him he said my God my
[1:13:12] God why is how forsaken me
[1:13:13] in other words this is gone from me now
[1:13:16] what the god part can you imagine now
[1:13:22] you can try and work it out and make the
[1:13:24] calculations and put the spot
[1:13:25] spurt here in the body there in the soul
[1:13:27] there and try and work it out that way I
[1:13:29] don't think
[1:13:29] I just take it the way it said he toured
[1:13:33] that soul out of him
[1:13:34] says he's face full of mockery spit a
[1:13:36] crown of cruel mockery pulled down over
[1:13:38] his brow his nails drove was Romans
[1:13:40] spikes back Riven till his ribs showed
[1:13:43] through swinging on the cross screaming
[1:13:45] dying as sinners death the sin of the
[1:13:47] world upon him and their God Riven
[1:13:49] decides tor he's sold out of him and
[1:13:51] when he said into thy hands I commend my
[1:13:53] spirit
[1:13:54] and he dropped his head and the earth
[1:13:56] shook and belched out its rocks since
[1:13:59] there he is there's God's covenant see
[1:14:05] there's the fulfilling of it what he
[1:14:08] showed Abraham back there with a heifer
[1:14:10] and the Turtledove and so forth that was
[1:14:12] just the shadow that was just the type
[1:14:14] this was the fulfillment of that Old
[1:14:16] Testament confirming the Covenant God
[1:14:19] taking it so seriously
[1:14:21] that he tore the body of Christ tore the
[1:14:23] soul out of him and what did he do he
[1:14:25] gave us the half of the contract he gave
[1:14:27] us that soul he gave us that spirit of
[1:14:30] Christ that's in the church that's why I
[1:14:31] say it's not another spirit it's not a
[1:14:33] second very little spirit it is the
[1:14:36] Spirit of Christ the same spirit it was
[1:14:38] in Jesus and if it's the same spirit I
[1:14:41] was in Jesus guess what it's gonna act
[1:14:43] the same way it did in him
[1:14:45] yes sir sure it will she's old Calvary
[1:14:48] Oh Calvary Jesus bled and died for me
[1:14:51] then he tore the soul of his own son
[1:14:53] separated the Covenant and he threw the
[1:14:56] body into the ground he laid there for
[1:14:58] three days and nights says it rose up
[1:15:02] for it was not possible with my holy one
[1:15:05] shall see corruption neither will I
[1:15:06] leave his soul in hell and he soul was
[1:15:09] his spirit just I like the way for other
[1:15:12] Branham puts things this is just
[1:15:14] mind-boggling okay but have a look his
[1:15:17] soul was he spurred that ascend ascended
[1:15:20] into hell how do you ascend into hell I
[1:15:23] thought it was descended but now look
[1:15:25] what a negative what he says next he
[1:15:26] says and he rose down he rose down God
[1:15:32] did and picked up his body and gave him
[1:15:36] life oh that just throws me God rose
[1:15:41] down what did they do on the day of
[1:15:43] pentecost didn't he rise down what did
[1:15:46] they do when he stretched his hand out
[1:15:48] to your little life didn't he rise down
[1:15:50] to your level
[1:15:51] God can't descend he just arises he
[1:15:53] ascends to hell and he ascended to hell
[1:15:56] sure brother that's something else now
[1:16:02] so I said don't try and make
[1:16:04] mathematical sense of this just take it
[1:16:06] the way it is and took the body of Jesus
[1:16:08] and said that his right hand in glory
[1:16:10] and sent back the Holy Ghost as a
[1:16:11] covenant you see when we meet him in the
[1:16:17] air it's the holy holy ghost in you that
[1:16:21] inhabited that body that's on the mercy
[1:16:24] seat that comes together the same spirit
[1:16:29] that inhabited that body the feminine
[1:16:33] part of it goes back to meet it and
[1:16:36] becomes one there now as a many membered
[1:16:40] expressed bride many little bodies
[1:16:42] making up the big body of Christ it's
[1:16:46] just a beautiful picture God and his
[1:16:49] family Christ and his bride every way
[1:16:51] you want to look at it since there you
[1:16:55] are says don't fall short of that
[1:16:59] brother see don't sit with a church
[1:17:02] experience don't sit with a little
[1:17:03] religion you know don't sit with what
[1:17:06] you think is revelation and some
[1:17:07] knowledge and some criticism when you
[1:17:09] got the wrong spirit around you be
[1:17:11] careful be careful
[1:17:13] it's just religion it's just a covering
[1:17:15] it's not going to rapture it's not going
[1:17:18] to go back there because it never came
[1:17:20] from that body right don't fall short of
[1:17:25] that brother without the baptism of the
[1:17:26] Holy Spirit you're lost that's the only
[1:17:30] you won't have to worry about getting to
[1:17:32] heaven if there's nothing in here
[1:17:34] supernatural The Doors can't unlock you
[1:17:38] could walk there and bump your head
[1:17:39] against it but if the Spirit of God is
[1:17:41] in there and the Spirit of God inside
[1:17:43] will unhinge the doors why it's got a
[1:17:46] unite it's the Spirit of God it has to
[1:17:49] come together God's not complete without
[1:17:52] you because you have a part of him
[1:17:54] inside
[1:17:55] of you she's got to have the thing in
[1:17:57] here to unlock it yonder that's right
[1:18:00] so you've already judged just and what
[1:18:01] you think about Jesus Christ is now here
[1:18:03] he comes torn driven tore to pieces he's
[1:18:06] so into God God blessed him and then he
[1:18:08] soul returned his soul returned in the
[1:18:11] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:13] see there one soul not many souls one
[1:18:18] soul what does that mean what is the
[1:18:19] soul the nature of the Spirit the nature
[1:18:23] one nature God's nature returned on the
[1:18:26] day of Pentecost now how can the bride
[1:18:28] be divided how can you have criticisms
[1:18:30] here and you know little attitudes over
[1:18:32] there not possible not possible at all
[1:18:37] right it says Baptists all egos right
[1:18:40] every believer and there his soul
[1:18:43] singular return back in the form of the
[1:18:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes
[1:18:48] into every believer uh-huh not just some
[1:18:52] special set apart little clergy to
[1:18:55] sanctify clean up the mind clean up the
[1:18:58] heart leave a portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:01] in there here and there sitting when the
[1:19:05] Holy Ghost is given out now there's your
[1:19:07] covenant you're holding the Covenant in
[1:19:10] your soul in your heart that little
[1:19:12] pulsation of faith that little desire in
[1:19:15] you to love God and serve God is the
[1:19:17] half of the contract that he's coming
[1:19:19] for Wow
[1:19:23] here he says it now cousin when the Holy
[1:19:26] Ghost is given out that same Holy spirt
[1:19:28] that brought the body of Jesus out of
[1:19:30] the grave will rapture mm-hmm and that
[1:19:34] covenant has to dovetail as he tore
[1:19:36] their and gave the body went back to God
[1:19:37] the spirit came back to the earth then
[1:19:39] your spirit will have to be the same
[1:19:43] kind of spirit or it'll miss that place
[1:19:45] going together yes sir not because you
[1:19:49] make yourself but because something the
[1:19:52] love of God has swept into your soul and
[1:19:54] tore every earthly idol out
[1:19:57] thank you lord that's God's work God's
[1:20:01] work you might try and give this up and
[1:20:03] give that up it's not gonna help you
[1:20:05] much it takes the Holy Ghost of God to
[1:20:07] tear out
[1:20:08] idols in your heart sis and look at this
[1:20:12] and there's something in us every
[1:20:16] believer I've talked to every real
[1:20:18] Christian has the same testimony there's
[1:20:20] something in me I don't know what it is
[1:20:23] I can't put my finger on it
[1:20:24] that screams and calls to God mmm it's
[1:20:29] your soul in here calling out to the
[1:20:31] heavenly Father since there you are that
[1:20:33] gives you a faith and you become the
[1:20:36] seed of Abraham you believe God's
[1:20:38] promise like Abraham did and he had
[1:20:40] enough faith for what yes a body change
[1:20:43] though it lingered and hasn't it
[1:20:46] lingered who would have imagined we'll
[1:20:49] be sitting in this year but it has
[1:20:51] lingered yet you believe it
[1:20:54] faithful Abraham staggered not at the
[1:20:57] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:20:59] strong giving praise to God hmm we can
[1:21:03] praise him tonight - there's even a
[1:21:05] desire in our hearts to serve Him even
[1:21:07] if there's a little pull there a little
[1:21:09] tug to believe that message that he's
[1:21:12] sent to - to hang your soul on it now
[1:21:17] without the dovetailing of love and love
[1:21:19] is what it really is God so loved the
[1:21:21] world that He gave that love covenant
[1:21:23] without that love the dovetailing of
[1:21:26] love with love all the form all the
[1:21:29] power all the demonstrations all the
[1:21:32] so-called revelation won't matter that's
[1:21:36] why Paul wrote a whole chapter on it
[1:21:38] first Corinthians 13 and speaks about if
[1:21:41] I knew all the mysteries oh I'm so revel
[1:21:44] a 'td and I have no love clanging cymbal
[1:21:49] just the noise nothing - God faith to
[1:21:53] move mountains give my body as a
[1:21:55] sacrifice have all these things
[1:21:58] manifestations and I don't have love
[1:22:02] it's meaningless when that which is
[1:22:05] perfect is come what is that which is
[1:22:07] perfect the motives of God the life of
[1:22:10] God the attitudes of God the expression
[1:22:13] of God how doesn't come by the same
[1:22:16] spirit that expressed him in Jesus
[1:22:18] Christ expresses him in your life
[1:22:20] brother Brown talks many-faced about
[1:22:22] Elijah
[1:22:22] about that double portion a double
[1:22:24] portion you think about it the double
[1:22:27] portion that Elijah Elijah and Elijah
[1:22:29] types Christ in the bride a double
[1:22:33] portion not a sparing portion not a
[1:22:35] little bit but the anointing only on
[1:22:39] youth brother Branham quotes in the
[1:22:41] message god commissioning Moses and he
[1:22:43] talks about that time where the woman
[1:22:45] kind of came to Jesus and talked about
[1:22:46] the places and the right and the left
[1:22:48] and so forth and Jesus asked her some
[1:22:49] questions and said can you be baptized
[1:22:52] with the same baptism and they said yes
[1:22:54] and he didn't dispute it the same
[1:22:59] baptism we're not talking about a water
[1:23:01] the spirit and then he goes on to say
[1:23:05] this it says notice talking about Elijah
[1:23:07] and Elijah now he watched him after a
[1:23:11] while a chariot of fire came down sorry
[1:23:13] did I oh I didn't put that on for you so
[1:23:15] terribly sorry
[1:23:16] you'd have to well you heard it anyway
[1:23:21] the chariot of fire came down and ported
[1:23:24] their part of them and the old prophet
[1:23:25] jumped on the chariot and went up in the
[1:23:27] rapture as Jesus went up in the
[1:23:28] resurrection and when he went up then as
[1:23:30] he was going up he pulled off his coat
[1:23:32] threw it down and he'll I shaft picked
[1:23:34] up his coat and put it over his own
[1:23:35] shoulders and walked down to the Jordan
[1:23:36] a very beautiful type of Christ being
[1:23:39] taken up baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:42] and when he went up in glory he sent
[1:23:45] back the Holy Ghost for us to where the
[1:23:48] church is baptized with a mantle of
[1:23:50] Christ said these right you see quotes
[1:23:54] these things that I do a double portion
[1:23:56] right more shall you do greater than
[1:23:59] this will you do for I go to my father
[1:24:01] is that right a double portion says
[1:24:05] pulled off his mantle fought folded it
[1:24:07] let it drop back down on the disciples
[1:24:09] at Pentecost and brother sister says if
[1:24:11] we've got the Pentecostal blessing then
[1:24:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus let's walk
[1:24:15] down there and strike her that's the
[1:24:17] River Jordan now where is the god that
[1:24:19] was on Jesus Christ where is the power
[1:24:22] of his resurrection I think that's a
[1:24:25] good thought for Easter where is the
[1:24:26] power that raised him from the grave if
[1:24:29] that power is in your body brother
[1:24:31] sister it'll make you act like Jesus I
[1:24:33] believe it will not just when you're
[1:24:35] dead
[1:24:36] you need a resurrection but while you
[1:24:37] are alive in this world it will speak
[1:24:40] his words it will touch with his hands
[1:24:42] it will heal it will soothe it will
[1:24:44] comfort it will express love it will it
[1:24:47] will cover a multitude of sin it will be
[1:24:50] a peacemaker it will be everything that
[1:24:52] he was his old brother what's in your
[1:24:58] hand why it's got right in you it's in
[1:25:03] your heart it's all over you
[1:25:06] the Holy Ghost says do something about
[1:25:08] it just throw it out there and trust God
[1:25:11] and say certainly God promised it to me
[1:25:14] and I believe it certainly God promised
[1:25:19] it to me there's a safe place today
[1:25:20] amidst the howling storms out there and
[1:25:23] how bad it's gonna get nobody can
[1:25:25] imagine they want to predict they have
[1:25:27] models and so forth but if this strain
[1:25:30] just takes a little turn just takes a
[1:25:32] little turn they won't have a vaccine
[1:25:34] for a year or two and what they're gonna
[1:25:36] do about that
[1:25:37] it might just become a little bit more
[1:25:39] contagious maybe it will target younger
[1:25:41] people what's gonna happen then how are
[1:25:43] we gonna panic how are we gonna provide
[1:25:45] how we're gonna keep the thing going all
[1:25:47] of that worry all of that fear there's a
[1:25:49] safe place today sure it's not a bank
[1:25:51] account it's not an underground bunker
[1:25:53] with supplies so you know the the
[1:25:57] tribulation is over that's not a safe
[1:25:59] place the safe place is he's word for
[1:26:02] this hour
[1:26:03] he's Ark today it was a safe place in
[1:26:05] Noah's day it's a safe place today and
[1:26:08] Noah's Ark was made out of the Word of
[1:26:10] God because God sent those words in the
[1:26:13] blueprint down to him and he followed it
[1:26:15] exactly and it took him through the
[1:26:17] storm God knew just exactly how many
[1:26:20] days you would rain how many liters of
[1:26:22] water would fall how strong the gales
[1:26:24] would be well how strong the waves now
[1:26:26] large the waves would be and that's why
[1:26:28] he sent a blueprint do you think he
[1:26:30] didn't know what was gonna happen in our
[1:26:31] day do you think it didn't make give us
[1:26:33] a message to prepare against the
[1:26:35] eventualities of the day I believe he
[1:26:37] has he's Ark today's the word for the
[1:26:39] hour pitched within pitched without
[1:26:42] where the Holy Spirit see you cannot

[1:26:47] to be sealed it has to be anchored
[1:26:49] by the Holy spirt quickened what stands
[1:26:51] between you and judgment this day is the
[1:26:55] Word of God that he sent in this hour
[1:26:57] sure he's own spirit what does that
[1:27:00] spirit bring a higher law there's
[1:27:02] another law in you the law of spurtin
[1:27:04] life as we read sets you free from the

[1:29:12] doesn't matter he never said this Ark
[1:29:14] will sit in a little whirlpool like that
[1:29:16] really it would calm just as calm as it
[1:29:18] can be no sir he never carried a flowery
[1:29:21] bed of ez never promised things easy but
[1:29:23] he promised grace to sustain you in that
[1:29:25] time it says let sickness come let
[1:29:29] troubles come let disheartening or heart

[1:29:35] nothing to do we receive a kingdom that

[1:29:44] kingdom one of these days you stay right

[1:29:50] build a big boat somewhere
[1:29:51] these are kazi's words stay in his
[1:29:54] promises staying the truth of the day
[1:29:56] you're living in if it can save you it
[1:29:59] will heal you and rapture you says I
[1:30:03] like little little David out there what
[1:30:06] he was talking about he knew what he was
[1:30:08] talking about he had a witness he had a
[1:30:09] testimony said your servant was hurting
[1:30:12] sheep out yonder one day in lion came
[1:30:14] and grabbed a kid and run off with it
[1:30:15] and I went and caught him by the beard
[1:30:17] took it out of his mouth he said a bear
[1:30:18] caught a lamb started away with not slew
[1:30:21] him he said in the same God he delivered
[1:30:23] me out of the paws of the bearing out of
[1:30:24] the mouth of the lion of the liver me
[1:30:25] from that uncircumcised philistine
[1:30:27] hallelujah he knew what he was talking
[1:30:30] about his brother that same Holy Ghost
[1:30:34] that give me eternal life will heal me
[1:30:37] when I'm sick
[1:30:38] it'll take me in the rapture yes sir
[1:30:41] just as sure as David was with those
[1:30:44] animals God had slain those animals by
[1:30:46] his hand and he had no fear for Goliath
[1:30:49] what doesn't matter if God has a saved
[1:30:51] me if he will heal me and if he has
[1:30:54] healed me he certainly will take me in a
[1:30:55] rapture it might look like a bigger
[1:30:57] obstacle but it's all the same because
[1:30:59] there's a law working on the inside of
[1:31:01] me called the law of spirit and life and
[1:31:03] then that law has already swallowed up
[1:31:06] death in victory yes to me that's what
[1:31:10] Easter is all about that's why I sing
[1:31:12] and I shout that's why this is a
[1:31:14] liberation day for me the Easter weekend
[1:31:16] is just
[1:31:17] you know one over on the devil you come
[1:31:19] over here and read what we know oh I
[1:31:22] don't think he's happy about that
[1:31:24] he still remembers that day sure you
[1:31:28] remember it till he drops into that lake
[1:31:29] of fire remembers nothing more
[1:31:32] it'll take me in the rapture you believe
[1:31:35] that God is just as much in his word on
[1:31:37] divine healing he is on salvation if the
[1:31:39] world's mocking divine healing what do
[1:31:41] you care they mock at the Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] when you know you've got it God is in
[1:31:45] his words sure he is in his word now
[1:31:48] what you've received the dividends of
[1:31:50] Easter the soul of Christ remember
[1:31:53] what's in you it's the soul of Christ
[1:31:55] the nature of God the other half of his
[1:31:59] covenant doing the same things he did
[1:32:02] back there hmm
[1:32:04] here in a message I'm not gonna be much
[1:32:07] longer hear the message who is this
[1:32:09] there's a tremendous message because
[1:32:12] really it comes down to what Jesus asked
[1:32:14] Peter but you know God is asking the
[1:32:17] same question of every one of us today
[1:32:18] who is this what is this he gives a
[1:32:23] testimony of a woman with a tumor and
[1:32:27] who would be operated on the next day in
[1:32:29] the Holy Spirit called her out in the
[1:32:31] meeting and and then she went for the
[1:32:33] operation and Monday and they couldn't
[1:32:35] find a trace of the tumor and brother
[1:32:37] Brennan said who is this who did that he
[1:32:41] says Oh God be merciful
[1:32:42] who is this that's doing this could you
[1:32:46] dare to say it was your pastor never
[1:32:49] could you dare to say men had anything
[1:32:51] to do into it never it's the Holy spirt
[1:32:55] the same spirit was on our Lord Jesus
[1:32:58] and he's coming he's coming to unite
[1:33:02] himself with his church the closing of
[1:33:06] the Covenant the bringing together of
[1:33:08] the two halves that's why we saw what we
[1:33:11] saw in our day that's what it means
[1:33:13] that's what it signifies this is so
[1:33:15] close that coming together is so close
[1:33:18] that is spreading forth his great holy
[1:33:20] light to redeem and to bring into
[1:33:24] fellowship a Church of the Living God
[1:33:27] for the rapture that's near at hand
[1:33:30] that's why all these manifestations and
[1:33:33] all these great things are happening
[1:33:34] why that's his goal to achieve a
[1:33:37] fellowship with you and why a fellowship
[1:33:39] to bring you to the rapture which is
[1:33:42] near at hand what is the point of
[1:33:44] longing for a rapture if you don't even
[1:33:46] have fellowship with the one you're
[1:33:47] going to meet in the air how do you
[1:33:49] become rapture ready just quickly before
[1:33:51] we close he quotes in God's power to
[1:33:55] transform there's another tremendous
[1:33:57] message this one is 911 65 Enoch was
[1:34:03] translated from death he says by God's
[1:34:05] transforming power what did God do that
[1:34:08] for for a type of the rapture in church
[1:34:11] that's coming since yes Elijah was the
[1:34:15] same Jesus body was quickened after it
[1:34:18] was dead says and in the grave Jesus
[1:34:21] body was quickened what by the Word of
[1:34:25] God and transformed from a dead cold
[1:34:29] image to a resurrected glorified Son of
[1:34:32] God by what he said because the prophet
[1:34:34] in the Psalm 16:10 if you want to put it
[1:34:37] down 16:10 said I will not leave he soul
[1:34:40] in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy
[1:34:42] One to see corruption he says Oh God
[1:34:44] now look at that see the Holy Spirit is
[1:34:46] to randomly float around doing things it
[1:34:48] acts according to the blueprint of
[1:34:50] program of God what did the program of
[1:34:53] God say about Jesus it said he won't
[1:34:56] stay in the grave he won't rot and
[1:34:59] therefore he was transformed by the Word
[1:35:04] of God that pertained to him now you
[1:35:07] have to know which words pertain to you
[1:35:09] and you will be transformed by the same
[1:35:12] thing yes sir
[1:35:14] since that word has to come to pass it's
[1:35:17] God's word plant it in your heart Oh
[1:35:20] planted in your heart by stripes I'm
[1:35:23] healed planted in your ward here Hart he
[1:35:27] was wounded for my transgressions
[1:35:29] planted in your heart so if you want to
[1:35:32] go in a rapture if you want to be
[1:35:35] Christians genuine place this word as I
[1:35:38] believe it was Ezekiel God said take
[1:35:40] that scroll and eat it up that the
[1:35:42] prophet and the word would
[1:35:44] come the same and every promise in there
[1:35:47] has to manifest itself because it's
[1:35:49] God's original seed don't you let some
[1:35:52] educated theologian out here try to pump
[1:35:54] it out of you don't you let him spray
[1:35:57] you with that carnal science and
[1:35:58] knowledge and education believe God
[1:36:02] believe God
[1:36:03] I'm just hope when you read that
[1:36:05] scripture when you read that Bible you
[1:36:08] take the verse you plant it in your
[1:36:10] heart you say Lord I believe you with
[1:36:12] every fiber of my being
[1:36:14] Lord flood my mind with your Holy Spirit
[1:36:16] flood my heart let I let me become just
[1:36:20] so enlightened and so full of your truth
[1:36:23] and your power that this will become
[1:36:25] everyday living to me it won't take me
[1:36:28] by surprise when the rapture happens
[1:36:29] it'll just be the next step just the
[1:36:32] next step yield to that law of the
[1:36:34] Spirit because I have a law in me what
[1:36:37] is I'm gonna quote you part of the
[1:36:39] articles of that law now before we pray
[1:36:41] a part of the articles of that laws
[1:36:43] first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 it
[1:36:47] says behold I show you a mystery we
[1:36:49] shall not all sleep this is not maybe
[1:36:52] this is true this is fixed this is real
[1:36:55] this is the law of spirt and life we
[1:36:58] shall not all sleep we shall all be
[1:37:02] changed there it is you try and alter
[1:37:04] that there's not a devil out of hell
[1:37:06] there's not a circumstance it's not a
[1:37:08] bit of backsliding or unbelief there's
[1:37:11] not a bit of negative testimony there's
[1:37:13] nothing you can stop that law from
[1:37:15] coming to pass yes sir in a moment he
[1:37:18] says in the twinkling of an eye at the
[1:37:20] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[1:37:22] and the dead shall be raised
[1:37:25] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:37:29] now you can say that is part of my
[1:37:31] pedigree that's part of me right there
[1:37:33] that's what the law of the spirit of
[1:37:35] long life tells me witnesses to me on
[1:37:38] this Easter weekend this time of the
[1:37:40] celebration of that that resurrecting
[1:37:43] power of God and raised Christ from the
[1:37:45] dead that same spirit that same soul
[1:37:47] that same nature lives on the inside of
[1:37:50] me in the form of a law of Spurlin life
[1:37:53] for this in this corruptible must not
[1:37:57] might
[1:37:58] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:38:01] must put on immortality I think Paul is
[1:38:06] pretty emphatic there I believe God is
[1:38:08] pretty emphatic there to tell us these
[1:38:11] things must be this is the law of the
[1:38:14] spirit and life how are you going to
[1:38:15] miss the rapture how are you gonna do it
[1:38:19] how are you going to avoid that not even
[1:38:22] a sidestep the law of spurting life I'd
[1:38:24] like to see you try mmm you guard we got
[1:38:28] a whole lineup of people through the
[1:38:30] Bible who tried look where they ended up
[1:38:32] right in the center of his perfect will
[1:38:35] yes sir by his law by his covenant by
[1:38:39] his oath by his sacrifice by his power
[1:38:42] you have a confirmation this day that
[1:38:45] God in you is the very same God that
[1:38:48] raised Jesus from the grave that
[1:38:50] dovetailing has to come together there's
[1:38:52] another law working in here getting old
[1:38:56] getting tired getting weary have some
[1:38:59] sorrow have some heartaches have some oh
[1:39:01] you know not so much of the material
[1:39:02] blessings of life what is that what is
[1:39:07] that compared to that law of life that's
[1:39:08] on the inside of you mm-hmm makes the
[1:39:11] birds fly and the fish swim and
[1:39:12] everything tick off just right but you
[1:39:15] got a supernatural law on the inside it
[1:39:17] ticks off according to God's timepiece
[1:39:19] in God's Bible and God's quickening
[1:39:20] spirit and there's no way you'll miss it
[1:39:23] no way the Holy Ghost in you he said
[1:39:25] will rapture let's close our eyes
[1:39:29] Heavenly Father Oh God the riches of
[1:39:33] your word of your promises of your truth
[1:39:35] Lord the lengths you went to to confirm
[1:39:40] it and to make it sure and stedfast and
[1:39:43] to deliver it to our hearts O God to
[1:39:46] write it there as a law as a new
[1:39:49] commandment as the truth in the nature
[1:39:51] of God that is forever true while
[1:39:54] heavens and earth will pass away we
[1:39:57] recognize Lord that that law will always
[1:40:00] be true you said O God we will free from
[1:40:04] the judgment present and future it can
[1:40:08] come but it cannot harm us Lord because
[1:40:11] we're seal
[1:40:12] in to your pavilion and in your presence
[1:40:15] we dwell in safety oh god I pray you
[1:40:18] reach out to every wavering heart to
[1:40:21] every fearful person Lord who those are
[1:40:23] on the borderline haven't made a
[1:40:25] decision or not sure of this of that God
[1:40:29] in a supernatural way may your call may
[1:40:32] your cry find those hearts tonight and
[1:40:35] bring them into the ark Lord into the
[1:40:37] place of safety like you did the animals
[1:40:40] in Noah's time bring them Lord into the
[1:40:42] message of the hour
[1:40:43] Lord God not the letter only but the
[1:40:46] spirit Oh Lord in the attitude and the
[1:40:48] way you expressed it in the enormous
[1:40:51] love Oh God that you poured out upon our
[1:40:54] generation bless your name forever we
[1:40:57] love you we trust you Oh God we keep
[1:41:00] keep us through this darkness and bring
[1:41:03] us out into your glorious life it's like
[1:41:06] I commit every person Lord they're there
[1:41:08] reaching out in their homes
[1:41:10] Lord Oh father from me other side of the
[1:41:13] world but Lord God we know we're in one
[1:41:16] body and there's no time or distance our
[1:41:18] gonna separate us so I pray you're rich
[1:41:20] blessing upon them in the name of Jesus
[1:41:23] Christ amen
[1:41:24] praise God I've been happy to do these
[1:41:27] services with you have some fellowship
[1:41:29] around the Word of God and I thank you
[1:41:31] for your kind attention and I hope
[1:41:33] there's been a benefit to you that some
[1:41:36] stakes have been driven down and that
[1:41:38] you are anchored in that haven of rest
[1:41:40] tonight may God bless you a man
[1:41:48] hallelujah isn't God wonderful isn't it
[1:41:52] absolutely wonderful how this word just
[1:41:54] links in so beautifully with this
[1:41:57] morning and how this weekend services
[1:41:59] have just all come together in an
[1:42:01] amazing way praise God the same thoughts
[1:42:06] of this morning we are the other part of
[1:42:09] God I just love how God just uses
[1:42:11] different gifts to put things in
[1:42:14] slightly different ways but the same
[1:42:16] thought the same Channel praise God I'm
[1:42:18] so thankful and even the things that
[1:42:20] we've been ministering here at home at
[1:42:22] our home church how these this weekend
[1:42:24] services
[1:42:25] just been sewing lying with those things
[1:42:28] hallelujah I loved so many other
[1:42:30] thoughts of their brother used and and
[1:42:32] that thought I mean that that that law
[1:42:35] of life that operates in us it's not us
[1:42:37] operating the law God is operating the
[1:42:40] law he's the one that's in control of
[1:42:41] that loan the reason why this law
[1:42:43] happens to take it back to the service
[1:42:45] of brother Jason this morning I mean
[1:42:47] when God moves on one side something in
[1:42:50] us moves because we are connected I mean
[1:42:52] those two parts are connected hallelujah
[1:42:55] that's so special I mean and what about
[1:42:57] a carnal nature I loved what I brother
[1:43:00] said the carnal nature is the grain of
[1:43:02] sand that irritates the oyster to make a
[1:43:05] poo isn't that a beautiful thought
[1:43:07] hallelujah to make a pole hallelujah to
[1:43:11] form your character to get us ready to
[1:43:14] reign with him we stuck with us carnal
[1:43:17] nature on the side I mean God knows what
[1:43:20] he's doing
[1:43:21] we don't know how much faith we've got
[1:43:23] but us trying to manufacture faith or
[1:43:26] not us trying to do to scrape together
[1:43:30] faith that we think we have I mean just
[1:43:33] God bringing it to pass as we walk with
[1:43:37] him as we grow in relationship with him
[1:43:39] I thank brother I be thank you my
[1:43:43] brother for for you you'll love thank
[1:43:46] you for your willingness to take part in
[1:43:48] these services it was a tremendous
[1:43:49] blessing to us my god bless you I trust
[1:43:52] that that your eyes are feeling better
[1:43:53] and that that the Lord is strengthening
[1:43:56] you just keep on committing you into the
[1:43:59] hands of the Lord and we pray that the
[1:44:01] Lord will use you mightily as you go
[1:44:03] forward and I just before I hand back to
[1:44:08] you brother Simon just just pray one
[1:44:11] more time precious father we just want
[1:44:17] to bring you the Thanksgiving in the
[1:44:19] glory the honor just pour our hearts out

[1:44:40] spoke to us this weekend we thank you
[1:44:42] that you met with us Lord Father perhaps

[1:45:04] pieces that needed to be done lord I
[1:45:06] pray that you will bless them restore
[1:45:07] the energy father I pray that you will
[1:45:10] just be with each one of them Lord and
[1:45:12] as we go our different ways so to speak

[1:45:17] pray that your your spirit father will
[1:45:20] anoint us Lord Father I pray that the
[1:45:23] things that we heard this week in Lord
[1:45:25] will not just remain as a good thought
[1:45:27] or a good memory father oh Jesus I pray
[1:45:31] that you will give us grace Lord father
[1:45:34] to walk with you to be in that
[1:45:36] relationship with you father so that
[1:45:39] these laws will just naturally operate
[1:45:43] in our lives because you are operating
[1:45:46] on the other end

[1:45:50] that took part father I pray that you
[1:45:53] will bless every brother every sister
