from within Lord we believe your word we are believers here this evening and we know loving father that all things are possible to them that believe and oh Father even the song in itself is so significant to me as well and Lord if we know the the quotes of brother Brandon you would say Lord how the angel of the Lord loved this song my God just for me emphasizing the fact that you want us to believe so Lord we just commit all things into your hands and we pray that you have the preeminence in Jesus name amen you may be seated just for a minute and musicians thank you so much God bless you it's uh an honor for me to be here this evening um to speak to his purchased possession um thank you Pastor El just for allowing me the opportunity um I just just before um a couple of weeks ago uh the the Lord just dropped this I was you know you know how it is you going through the uh sermons of brother brandham you're studying the word and then certain things just pops out at you and uh the Lord just laid this quote on my heart and I wasn't going to read it but I just felt before we go into the word I'd like to just read there's just two quotes um and then we'll we'll go into the word but the brandom says here um in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says um I just want to say there's so many people passing through you that's suffering with mental oppression he says demon manifestation but oppression he said I seen the vision break before me of a young lady she went back there and sat down a few minutes ago and this lady brother Bram says thinks she's crossed the separating line he says don't let Satan tell you that cuz you know many times the enemy comes and he plagues your mind and he tells you that you know what you've done things and there's no Grace I just want you to know don't listen to the devil brother BR says don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God God still loves you and I think that's so key and so important that we need to know that God loves us he says um it has to be a Creator to create that Creation in your heart to make you love God and I know you know as I was watching and observing um all of you over this weekend I like to observe people I like to sit in the back and I just watch things and I can see that there is a genuine love for the Lord don't let the devil come in between that he says and then he says he talks to the sister he says go believing with all your heart that Christ loves you right that's the one quote the other quote he gave me Divine love brother brandham says no matter what you've done how far back you've gone how much you've got into God still loves you God loves you he says it twice keep that love moving on don't let it fail I just you know um thought just to drop that in before we go into the word don't forget that God loves you I mean he he laid on the heart of brother Al to come and arrange these meetings for you but not only for you for me as well so God bless you um we can stand to our feet and we just I've just got one scripture um found in the book of James chapter 4 verse 7 and I've got my timer on so my alarm might go off in the next 50 minutes but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop in 50 minutes I will see that's just like a guideline for me I normally preach about 2 hours but um yeah I you love the word right you you as you pull who who's for the K dig what did he say you pull I preach so I want to copy his words open the K it's okay with you I'll copy his words you PLL I preach so James uh chapter 4:7 um it says here submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you we'll just say a prayer quickly and I just remembered actually um I've got a I've got a 9-year-old grandmother out in South Africa and uh I just received news um that during their South African night she had fallen off the bed and you know 90-year-old they the bodies are frail so she broke um I think something in the arm year um so she's been to the hospital and they um talking about doing surgery for her but they're still also weighing things up because of her age and she's frail so if you would allow me I just want to just pray for my grandmother as well if we could just bow our heads Lord Jesus we want to say thank you for your word that's been read and Lord God the inspiration and the burden that you've laid on my heart um father I just commit that into your hands and I pray that you just help us through this meeting my God as I believe that you're going to be speaking to every heart tonight Lord just the prayer request for my grandmother Mar harom Lord she's frail 90 years old old you've kept her for all these years and Lord I will never forget how she was so instrumental in helping me teaching me to pray my God and I just want to um as we stand here together oh God as Believers Lord collectively father God we want to come to you by faith and we want to ask that you step on the scene for my grandmother and whatever they need to do my God the doctors the decisions the surgery the anesthetic whatever Lord God we commit it all into your hands and we ask that you would put strength into uh my grandmother in the name of Jesus we say thank you amen God bless you you may be seated um this this morning um so there's um you know I hope it's okay for me just to be me tonight and uh I I I when I speak right I I I speak of a burden that the lord has laid in my heart right um and uh i' I've I've always been of the opinion that I cannot be someone else I am who God has made me to be so uh the burden that the Lord has just laid on my heart and we're going to see how how how the meeting goes right but I've got a title here and um the title says surrender to our Lord Jesus Christ and allow his healing to flow that is just the burden that the lord has laid on my heart to release uh to us this evening now I'll start off with this quotation of brother Brandon where he says here in the angel of the Covenant he says the Christian has not one worry in the world he says they should be the most freest happiest people in all the world and you know as I was watching you uh young people this over this weekend I can see that you are Christians and that's why I said I can see that you love the Lord there's something different about you when you take yourself and you compare yourself to what's happening out there so appreciate what you have so he says we are the most freest happiest people in the world and then he uses the statement he says you can't lose and I want you to grab that and I want you to hold on to that because life will come and try to tell you something else life and the devil and situations will try to tell you that you a loser that you are not able to attain but my prophet has come and tell told me and telling you that as a Christian totally surrender to God you cannot and you will not lose so you see you are and I am part of that generation that will not lose cannot lose contrary to what the situation might might try to tell you contrary to how you might think you are feeling you might wake up one morning and feel so down and so depressed but even in that state of feeling down and feeling depressed as a son and a daughter of God you cannot lose so the devil will try to tell you you're a loser and when he comes and he tries to tell you that you tell the devil shut up devil I'm a winner my God has made me a winner and I'm not a winner in the future I'm a winner right now as you sit here this evening you are a winner right now regardless of what you think so don't doubt who you are God has made you as has has placed something powerful within you and I you know what I've discovered many times in life that I Taz many times I've got to press pause Taz because many times Taz want to tell Taz such a lot of foolish things but you see this word is and I said it I think on on uh yesterday this word is telling you who you are it's telling you that you are not some downtrodden thing you're not just some piece of thing that gets kicked around you are Sons and Daughters of the most high God the mighty conquerer lives with inside of you so don't allow and I might repeat myself but don't allow anything to tell you that you are nothing you are a something in the sight of God and he loves you so you and I and and and and and many times it is a battle where we have got to press pause our own thoughts and then we get so overwhelmed with things but I believe that God gives us the grace and he makes a way for us to press pause ourselves because this word is calling you and me higher right we we don't stay and Mark time on one place but we're moving forward all the time so many times if you think you know what I'm not really a good Christian and and uh you know I failed God and these things the devil wants you to focus on those negative stuff but you you know but but he tries to get your attention away from the positive things that has happened because maybe yesterday the Temptation came and I was able to say no but maybe today something happens and I slip and I fall and the Devil comes and he hammers on that but then we forget the victory that we had yesterday brother brandom says this and this is not just quotes right that I'm want to quote to you but this is something that I want you to take and I want you to apply it to your life and I want you to take it and say Lord I'm receiving it within me it's not just words that brother the Taz or any minister is saying but this is here to help me to recognize and realize that I am an overcomer brother brandham says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime any place on any condition the word of God alone and you have access to this word this word is preached into each one of us and we sat and we've got to receive it and as we receive it this word shows us and teaches us and helps us to overcome and defeat Satan because we know Satan is a bluff he just tries things and he tries to say all this rubish but we know brother brand taught us whenever he opens up his mouth he lies so he might plant little thoughts into your head so when he does that you say devil shut up Adam goes in God's covenant with ABR he says Jesus defeated Satan on his own ground with the word of God so Jesus proved that it's possible to defeat the enemy with it is written and you and I can do the same and I know as you're listening to me as you watching me you've heard this so many times stuff of these a lot of these things to us message children you know and I'm one of them that grew up you know in the church and grew up in the message and heard all these things but it had to at some point become a reality in my life I had to one day take this word and then I had to apply it when I was alone there was no Pastor no Deacon no Mom no dad I was alone and I I had to use the word and I found out that it works so if you've never ever used the word against the enemy I encourage you use it brother brandham says that the weakest Christian and you know many times we look at ourselves we look at our friends and we look at brother Michael standing here and he's preaching the word and man he's so powerful and we look at him and say man I wish I could be like brother Michael he's such a strong Christian and I look at myself I'm so weak but brother Brandon comes and he encourag even you that think that you are weak you are strong but it's not you that's strong it is the god that you have surrendered yourself too so brother Bram says the weakest Christian here tonight so you know if you think you're weak not if you think you're weak can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition I want you to receive that this is not just you know words that we throwing at you and also sometimes some of these quotes can become buzzword but these are not just buzzword that you know we just throwing out there just to make you feel good but this is life and it's important that you hear and that you receive life because as you receiving this word God is showing you really who you are because we know that this walk that we walking it's a constant battle and brother brandham would come and preach a message called the contest and then he would say you define that the word contest it's a test of strength and then you would tell us as an example he say the American Indians they would build a fire in the middle and he says then they would have a rope and a group on the one end a group on the other end and he says they they'll have a contest where the one group is pulling the Rope the side the other group is pulling the rope that side and the objective brother brandham says with the American Indians was that the they want to the the one team wants to pull the other team into the fire so it is a a a test of who is stronger and brother Brandon comes he says now we know there's many things that we could base that example on but he says but I want to speak for these minutes quickly upon the greatest contest that there is and that's between the church you the church and Satan and then he says the great strength of Satan now we know our adversary is powerful but he says we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church and I want you to to to receive that because our God is all powerful and then brother brandham says how it started in heaven and how Satan was kicked out and he becomes an enemy to God's people and since then he's used everything to try to get you but remember you are not a loser you are a what's that song that we sing I'm a winner in Christ my Lord that's who you are and brother random goes on in the contest he says and we know who has the most power God does and he says and when God gave his people the best thing that could combat Satan and that's the word of God brother brandham says and you and I we have access man don't ever undervalue this word and it's not just any word it's not just cuz the Pentecostal and the every body's got this Bible but you and I have access to an open book you and I have access to things that is so amazing so tremendous so powerful and we should appreciate God for that so we are in a contest and now having said that I read the scripture the Bible says submit yourself to God resist the devil and he will flee from you now I love I love the way the Bible places things the Bible is so specific and when I when I looked at that scripture I thought wow this is so powerful because if you look at the order of that just that scripture the Bible says submit yourself therefore to God right step one submit yourself to God then the scripture goes on after you have submitted yourself to God then there is something within you that allows you to resist the devil because we read earlier brother brandom says our adversary is powerful and he is strong but our God is strong but our God wants you and I to resist the devil and his tricks and the things that comes our way I'm sure as you're looking at me you can identify that every single day of your life you are fighting the enemy it's a constant battle he wants to destroy you but he will not succeed don't let anybody tell you anything different you are the purchased possession of the most high God you are in the palm of his hand and no devil no demon no situation can pluck you out so the Bible says submit yourself to God that is key and for the next couple of minutes I think I want to just talk a little bit about submission talk a little bit about surrender in in uh non-military use that word submit it says here it was a voluntary attitude of giving in voluntary and that's what God wants of you and me he wants us to voluntary not being forced but just voluntary I submit myself to you Lord because you see as you submit to God and I read the scripture something happens within and you know that that word submit or that word surrender in the in the the big bad world of today that is not something that the normal person would like to do because if you think of that word surrender to many people it sounds like a act of weakness right people do not like to submit or to surrender to things it's tends to be associated with defeat many people I wrote it here connect submission with weakness or with fear but you see that is the definition out there to you and me as Believers submission to the word surrender to our Lord Jesus Christ is a powerful thing there a song that says the more that I Surrender the lighter my Lord the more that I Surrender myself the more he takes control amen and that's what we want we want him to take control of Our Lives we want him to live through us because at the end of the day you and I we are here today to prove that the word of God is all powerful so brother brandham comes right and he says here in the Queen of Sheba he says he talks about people having pieces of the cross of Jesus and nails and he says I don't care he says how many pieces of that cross you have or he says how many nails you have we he says this you me we need to produce this word again you see this word needs to live through you and through me he says we don't put it on the cross or piece of the Cross or piece of the nail he says but on the living atmosphere of the holy spirit it's so important that we need to find ourselves living under the right kind of atmosphere because under the right kind of atmosphere osphere the right things happen under a wrong atmosphere difficult things or wrong things can happen you know I remember I was I was actually thinking one time how uh a couple of years ago many years ago um I was working out in um I think it was Thailand and uh I was just not happy with my with with with my location where I was working loved my job but I just wasn't happy where I was working and I remember they had put me in an apartment you know quite quite high up and I was living in the apartment so I would be working there and coming home for a couple of days going back and working there for a long time and I just hated it and as a result what happened I allowed myself to come under a negative atmosphere and you know what the devil climbed into that and I was thinking about that a couple of days ago because I realize the devil wanted to kill Taz because you see the devil knows what's laying inside you and he knows that I am not afraid of him and he knows that you know as we come to realize who we are we can tell him to go so I remember you know I remember one time I was sitting and a happened over a couple of days because I was up quite high and my room had a beautiful balcony and you know what the devil tried to do he tried to tell me T you know what all you need to do just jump off the balcony I mean I would never have Suicidal Thoughts but I allowed myself to feel so despondent I started feeling so depressed and I then contined to live under that depressive atmosphere and even when I started to pray my prayers were negative prayers not positive negative prayers so I was constantly under a negative atmosphere and the enemy then seen that and he thought hey here's an opportunity and then he slowly started to drop little seeds in my head telling me hey TS there's that balcony if you want to go home just quite high up just jump off you'll break your leg or something and they'll see have to send you home but when I thought of it I was so high if I had to jump over there by the end I would have killed myself but I had allowed the enemy to plant the thought but I am grateful to God that he came my way and he opened my eyes and I had to realize T you are not in a good space you've got to break out of that and I'm grateful to God he gave me the grace to break free and I could then tell the devil to go and then I could create the right atmosphere around me a positive Holy Ghost atmosphere and you know what in that Holy Ghost atmosphere God was so gracious he said you know what T you've had enough in Thailand I'm sending you home but I had to change my the way I thought cuz you know I'm not going to go on say something brother Bram would talk about atmospheres and you would say how important atmospheres are and you would use the example of a egg and you'll say you know that egg under the right atmosphere will hatch and you would say it doesn't have to be the mother hand there it can even be a puppy so you'll say it's important to be under the right atmosphere because under that atmosphere certain things happen and what the enemy wants to do he wants to have you live under a negative atmosphere but brother brandham comes and teaches us and I'll just drop this in for free you know many times we come into church and we think that the song leader comes and he sings the songs and we he sings and we dance and we raise our hands and we create the atmosphere and then we think that is the only place that we can create an atmosphere and if you're someone that thinks that I want you to know that when you out there when you in your car when you in your room you can create an atmosphere that is so conducive for God to move and do something special in your life and you know how you can create that atmosphere yes we sing songs and as we sing you know we just get caught up in that and we and and we find the atmosphere change but also as you know what the things that we speak but bandam says this right he says you create an atmosphere with the things that you say so that is why they always say don't talk negative because if you talk negative you creating and you're going to find yourself walkking under a negative atmosphere so when when you go out here and you go and live life speak positive if you feel it feels so gloomy or if you wake up in the morning and man it's a blue Monday speak positive if you don't know what to speak just open up the Bible read a scripture say it out loud take a song Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green postures man what atmosphere does that create so when you go out there and you live life and things get hard and hot and heavy and it will right it's not a flowery bed of is this is a battle it's a fight you are on the winning side but you have got to do your part and when things happen and you feeling so down and but the Taz is not there you can't text him you can't text Brother Aly you can't contact this person you can't contact that person remember that you have an author within you don't forget that and you can speak speak health over you speak happiness over you so that's what you do creating the atmosphere and then for the brandom goes on actually he says it's not even the things that you speak he says it's the things that you think have you thought of that the things that you think think just just you think of the scenario maybe you you you're in your room and you start thinking of something scary maybe in your naughty days you used to watch horror movies right in your naughty days you don't do that today well if you do be careful because you're opening yourself up to demonic influences so if you're doing it I'm not talking to you talking to the live stream if any of you on live stream watching horror movies please don't do it it's a gateway to demonic forces but anyway think of this you're in your room and you remember this horror movie that you watch in your bad days and you start thinking of things what do you think happens it's like you feel the atmosphere still changing and then you feel like the the back of your neck start the hair starts going proving that you have an authority there's something powerful within you you've just changed the at atmosphere in your room alone now you take that to the positive the power and the authority that you have in your room alone you don't need Pastor Aly to come and encourage you even though many times we do need that but sometimes in your room alone you start thinking about the goodness of God you start thinking of what he's done for you and then you find just the atmosphere starts to change and then you can't help but you just want to raise your hands and say thank you Jesus and after a while you just find maybe the tears start coming because of the appreciation that you have for him but you see you were the one that changed the atmosphere you created an atmosphere and God God has just built us that way that we there's something within us to do it but you see he wants us to be submissive he wants us to surrender everything to him in you know this word this revealed word we call it we say the message of the hour this message is telling you and is transforming you into something powerful but we need to Just Surrender we need to allow God to teach us and show us how to walk under an atmosphere brother Brandon would call it of surrender and then he says here in the fundamental foundations of Faith he says I've seen people who just couldn't even come for healing so he says I've seen people coming to the meeting there's a prayer line and they just can't make it to come into the prayer line he says but he says they're just sitting there in the meeting like you are and he says they would go home he says after being submissive to the Holy Ghost so they'll sit in the meeting and brother Michael would preach the word and we would sit there and we'd be so submissive and we'd receive the word brother brandham says this people they go home they come into the meeting not well they sick he says they sit in the meeting and they are some m to the Holy Ghost he says and then they go home and be made perfectly made whole and didn't even realize it the power of submission to the word so let's you know just cultivate that kind of attitude in Our Lives as Christians in our walk with God let it be a walk of surrender let it be a walk of humility let it be a walk of submission to him because in that walk of submission and in that walk of humility he just gives you Grace to overcome I'll give you another testimony one day I was driving in my car and uh there was this demonic force that was just plaguing me it was just man it would get me down every time I would try to resist I would try to fight it but man it would just get me so this one day I'm driving in my car in Cambridge which is where I live driving in the town I'm alone in the car and I start talking to the Lord and as I'm speaking to God and I'm saying Lord I'm just tired of this I want to overcome father it's just this thing is just breaking me down as I'm talking without realizing it I was creating an atmosphere in my car and then all of a sudden as I am driving I feel the atmosphere in my car change and then and I can't explain this then I just found myself speaking it was like I was sitting in the passenger seat looking at Taz driving the car and as T was driving the car words was just coming out of his mouth but this was words that was addressing the specific demon that was plaguing me but it was words of authority that just came out it just came out and when it was done I was so weak my wife is testimony to this and I came home and as I came home I was staggering and I came into my lounge and my wife came running tell what's you okay and I said just wait a minute I'll tell you later and I had to go rest but since that day that demon never bothered me again so you know you know what there is an authority and you have the ability to create an atmosphere an atmosphere of Deliverance and for me it didn't happen in church I'm not saying it mustn't happen in church but for me with that battle I was going through it happened with Taz alone driving is car and God stepped into my car and brought a Deliverance but you see I wanted to surrender I wanted to submit myself to him and I was just sick and tired of this thing that was plaguing me and that's why I said Lord I need help and I said Lord give me Grace and he gave me Grace and that same God is available I mean I know I'm I'm it's like they say you're preaching to the choir cuz you know these things right but I I don't want you just to know these things I mean it's good to know these things but I want to ask you you know all these for many I think all almost all of us grew up in the message right I think so is there anyone here that has not grown up in the message anybody okay sister L brother add them but the majority of us you know we so we know the message lingo we know the the the the certain quotes that we quote that makes people go wow but don't yes these things make us go wow and it makes us go man this is amazing but let that quote become a reality in your life let that quote become personal to you and if it's not you say God lord Jesus give me Revelation because Lord I'm hearing all these quotes I'm hearing these amazing things that the preacher preaches but lord I can't identify with it yes it makes me excited and it makes me feel good but Lord when I'm out there I don't know how to use it in my walk with you let him know that because he's a friend that Stith closer than a brother he's a God that wants you to grow so you just let him know say father I need Revelation Revelation is so key and it's so important now there's anyone here that doesn't know really what Revelation is and this ank is not that clean but I'll just use it anyway you know Revelation is something that's hidden so you can't really see what's under my ank here but if you say Lord I don't understand you know that there's something here I don't understand can you reveal it to me see what he does he comes and he takes away the hanky and he shows you what it really is and then once you see and you realize what it is man it just does something within you brother brandham uses the words and I think I'm going to try to quote it he says you get stimulation of Revelation because now you realizing man is not just God sent a prophet or behold I send you Elijah the prophet but you realize that this is for me and it's transforming my life and it's personal very very personal but he wants us to surrender he wants us just to give ourselves over to him and it's not a difficult thing to do we just need to within ourselves make a decision and say Lord I'm not just singing the song All to Jesus I Surrender lord it's not just words cuz many people just sing the words but Lord I want you to see in my heart and father I want you to see that I want to just fully surrender to you and he sees that desire and then he comes and maybe you don't know how to do that surrender but he comes and then he will guide you it's like brother brandham would talk about a little I think he talks about his son or a little boy he says the little boy is wants to put on his jacket right so now he's putting his jacket on and he's trying to put the spot in right and he's he's struggling he can't find it where's where is it where is it I need to put my my arm in here but he says then what happens Mom comes and Mom comes and takes your arm and Mom then takes it and Mom guides it guides it to where it must go and then Mama helps you and then you can put the jacket on now what needed to happen for that boy right he needed to allow mom to take his hand and to guide his hand to the right place and then he needed to allow mom to then just put it and then he could put his jacket on and then he could look as nice as I'm looking today right but he need thank you but yeah I've dress with the suit today with the Michael but you see he needed to allow mom or dad to take his hand and to guide it and that's what God wants of you in me he just wants us to allow him that's all not resist not say no I can do it on my own but just say Lord I I want to give in i i brother T and the ministers keeps on telling me and telling us about this the this message and about this word and about the Holy Ghost and about you know the overcoming power and I can't I can't identify with that about you know I'm I'm I'm I'm a conqueror and and there's an authority within me I don't see it in my life but Lord I want to see it Lord I want the Holy Ghost it's about s friend that's part of you know we know there's there's many other things that that you know that that play some part in our walk with God but the Lord laid on my heart the burden of surrender that's what he wants and as we just allow him to take our hands and to to to move it in the right direction he comes and he'll teach you now test this is what you need to do T this is even how you must pray he wants surrender the resurrection of J's daughter brother brandham says now if a person completely surrendered to the devil will give him twice his strength what will a man completely surrender it to God Doo you see when you totally surrender yourself to God you can reach the point where the devil doesn't know what to do with you because then you'll say man I kick them here man I threw this temptation here at them I did this and I did that I tried to make them depressed I tried this but I just don't know why they just happy Christians they just love the Lord and you know what is worse they are encouraging others to serve the Lord because because at that camp they were told we are in this together and I you know what is so horrible those young people took those words seriously and when they went away from the camp they continued to support each other they continued to help each other because they decided to be surrendered to God why did they do that that's what the devil would say but I want to encourage you not only now yes now as well it's like these words that I use uh I heard one time somebody says if not you then who right if not here then where if not now then when so it's here it's now and it's you and we all have to make this decisions in life and I trust as you know brother Brandon would say as you if you want Faith preach faith and I believe the Lord just laid on my heart to preach surrender and I believe that tonight we are in an atmosphere of surrender we are in an atmosphere of influence because is as we sitting here surrendered I know I'm looking at you I can see I can feel that there's a surrender to him and as we're sitting and we surrendering we allowing him to help us to speak to us but the random in the maniac of gdar and I'll finish off shortly he says you just submit yourself to God one time and just heal your whole self to God your everything your emotions your feelings your struggles just yielded to God and brother brandham says watch what takes place cuz when you submit those things your your your struggles and the weaknesses he takes it and we heard brother Michael speak of it he takes it and he gives you the strength to overcome cuz you can overcome it's not impossible it's not hard God is able to help you overcome I'll read you this buzzword quote but it's not going to be a buzz word to you right pmo's Vision but the brandom says a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent not only men sisters as well a sister do you know how powerful you are a sister and there are some sisters here totally surrender to God you are omnipotent and that word omnipotent means you are invincible you might look at me and say ah really for the is yes you are invincible Unstoppable no devil can stop you but the key is surrender yourself to him the musicians can come and then I'll I'll I'll just um close of with with with this quote here and whatever the Lord lays on your heart to play you play it musicians God bless you brother Brandon in the message the absolute I this this was really a tremendous encouragement to me because many times you feel sometimes that you're all alone you know you can be in a room full of people and you can still feel alone brother bandam would tell us an experience that he had he says where where the he that the enemy manifested himself this demon manifested himself to brother brandham and he would tell brother brandham things and brother brandham says after a while he was accusing [Music] me and he said you have no power with God you're just a bluff William Brandon you're just a bluff you have no power and I know that the enemy tries that with you tries that with me tries tries to tell us you know that so we made mistakes and we slipped and we fell and he tries to keep you there I preached the sermon one time I titled it guilty and then I said repentance and then I said forgiveness and freedom now the enemy wants to keep you there guilty cuz we but flesh right and we do things we slip we fall we stumble even by the Tas I'm also 50 years old like brother the Al I make mistakes but I don't allow the enemy to keep me there as guilty because you see I am living in an atmosphere surrendered to God now the brandom says the enemy came and tried to preach to him and tried to tell him William brandham you are a bluff you've got no power but you see brother the Brandon knew who he was so he could go and he said I said Satan you an offense to me get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ brother brandham says and he left now that was William brandham now we've also heard these things about William brandom was the first wave sheave to show that there is more coming so this Authority didn't remain with William Brandon this Authority is laying within [Music] you but we also don't play with the devil we need to know that we know so as I'm going to I'm going to repeat myself one of the keys is live a surrendered life to our lord Jesus and then you will be able to tell the devil Satan you an offense to me get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ and he must leave and brother Brandon goes on this is off the enemy left he said I laid there a little bit in the bed and I started to raise up he says I felt a real sweet feeling come over me you know what as the music is playing and as you receiving the word I feel that we are in a such a a beautiful atmosphere he says I felt a real sweet feeling come over me I thought I wonder if the Holy Spirit now is close and then he says over in the corner so help me he said here is my Bible over my heart he says the sweetest voice I ever heard in my life said don't fear to go anywhere and don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go so as we going to be leaving this meeting and as we going to be going maybe later on a couple of days later and we go go often we live life I want you to remember and I want you to receive that the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you he wants to help you he wants to guide your hand so that you can put on that jacket but he wants you to be surrendered to him as we just bow our heads Lord Jesus we just want to say thank you this evening tonight my God for your presence Lord Brother brandom makes the statement he says that the spirit follows the word and my God tonight I do believe that the word was preached and my God I believe that the never failing presence of our Lord Jesus Christ is here my God we don't have to have any sensation my God any Fantastics we don't even need music even though music plays a important thr but loving father just to know that we are in the presence of the king of kings and loving father you are here to help us father you want to help us more than we even know we want to be helped so I I pray tonight heavenly father that Lord God as we close of this meeting at some point and Lord we go to our Bungalows and we do things let the never-failing presence of Jesus continue just to be with us Father I remember I many years ago I was at a youth camp and Lord we had tremendous meetings and father the meetings closed and we all went to our rooms to go and sleep but father you were not sleeping because oh God I remember at that camp you went to the Bungalows yes you went to the rooms and I remember God there was a loud knock on the door of our room and the brothers were shouting and saying that the Lord is dealing with the sisters in the sisters Bungalows and Father I remember running there as a young man and father as I came into that atmosphere I just fell on my knees father you're the same Jesus and I just pray tonight oh God that as we finish off and we do the things that we got to do don't leave us Lord as we go sleep tonight deal with us touch our hearts move oh God in a special way we commit Our Lives to you these are just father I told my wife as I was sitting oh God at the back um this morning's meeting at the end and looked around and I told the ver Lord I said oh man what beautiful young people Lord help them Lord if there's still time they are

I [Music] Sur oh to Jesus May savior holy th let me Fe I know his Spirit the true know that thou are m i surrend all I I surrender all all to the my bless and saor I [Music] Surrender Hallelujah just beautiful beautiful special sermon tonight I mean there's something I I want to want to say that it's it's something that has really helped a lot of people when I when I shared this thought you know sometimes we I wonder if I can just ask you to say take your seats for a moment sometimes we have things in our lives that we that we want to get rid of I'll just take this out closer you know whether it's a besetting sin or a struggle or a battle or a mind battle or you know hurts from the past that your mind constantly goes to and so forth and you say you want to get rid of it and you actually think you want to get rid of it but many times there's something subconscious sub subconscious that actually doesn't want to get rid of it okay and and and that is a real challenge you know some let's just use pornography as a as an example but there's you know it's kind of the the Practical example of the moment but you know sometimes we want to get rid of of the you know the feeling afterwards when we feel all dejected and a failure and all those things or we want to get rid of the the impact on relationships we want to get rid of the effects but actually subconsciously we want to hold on to that dopamine effect and the and and what it does for us and there's actually and it's a real struggle it's a real tough place to be and it can be like that with you know with hurts um and it's a really really big thing that the enemy can catch us up with because we get preached we need to forgive people and then the enemy brings into our minds things that happened years ago that we still hold against those people and part of us wants to forgive them but there's something on the inside that wants to hold on to that thing and now why am I saying all of this sometimes we need to ask God to help us surrender now sometimes sometimes we literally have to go on our knees and say Lord give me the want give me the will to want to surrender you know and and many times I've say to people start your prayer there you know if you've prayed over thing over and over and over again then change your prayer maybe and change your prayer and say to the Lord Lord Lord please give me the will to surrender please remove that want to hold on to it out of my life amen and that makes such a big difference you know many times like I said we we we we actually we can't really fool ourselves but we to a certain extent we do we think we want to get rid of something but there's actually something that holds on surrender is such a big thing and we and we need to to find I want to say it is really Grace when we find that place of surrender you know it's not mind over matter I'm sorry it doesn't it doesn't just lie in the human uh ability to Just Surrender by ourselves because some of those things are anchored Way Beyond where our our human Minds can reach it's actually deep down built into the I want to say nearly the spiritual DNA of us in a way you know subconsciously it because like brother Michael described also this morning those those things have formed New Paths in our minds and we think in a certain way and we and we justify ourselves to ourselves amen and we need to to have the Lord's Grace to surrender those things um sorry let me just so so I want to encourage you pray that the Lord gives you the want to get rid of your problem to the one to dedicate your life to him you know I I I believe with all my heart as you sit here you want to dedicate your life to the Lord I honestly do but there's possibly something still in some of you that that desires the applaud of your friends that that wants the tough guy attitude or that wants the attention of the guys if you're a girl and vice versa you know that and that's the basic at at a really deep basic level amen and and I want to say ask God to help you to surrender that thing I'll read a quote to you here from God in Simplicity brother bam says when you surrender fully he'll come in fully amen I me that's a very simple statement but powerful powerful isn't it he says surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking surrender Surrender Your Life Surrender Your all now there's a whole lot of things that's in there surrender your thinking it's ways that we like I said we have well worn paths in our thinking this is the way we think we justify ourselves I've got a right to this and that or the other or you know I've done this over and over or that person or whatever ways of thinking surrender your thinking Surrender Your Life surrender your thoughts so you can come in fully it says um Surrender Your all surrender your prestige in other words what people think of you surrender that to God Amen surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost well who doesn't want that amen that's what he's here to do he's already stuck two or three struck two or three year in the building brother Ram says amen and you know when he preached that that was the week that he was going to preach the seals amen and that was when he opened the the brandom Tabernacle again praise the Lord so I trust that each one of you go out of here tonight with a with a very special touch from the Lord amen let's stand and sing a couple of songs before we go you know it you should have it in front of you like magic yeah some of our musicians want to join in there start in
