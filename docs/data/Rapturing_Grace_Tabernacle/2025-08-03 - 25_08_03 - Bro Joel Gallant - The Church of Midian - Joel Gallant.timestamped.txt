[33:44] Father Moses,
[33:48] [Music]
[33:53] Moses, we also have a prayer request
[33:54] here, brother. Um so any other unspoken
[33:56] prayer request, but we also have one
[33:58] that says, "Please pray for Justin who
[34:00] has been battling with a sore back." So
[34:02] Justin who has been battling with a sore
[34:03] back and is particularly sore this
[34:05] morning. So just pray for his full
[34:07] healing. Thank you brotherise.

[34:20] given us which you always show to us.

[34:43] you.
[34:45] There's no better place to be on a
[34:47] Sunday morning than in the house of the
[34:50] Lord. Heavenly Father, the great
[34:53] musician David said, "I would rather be
[34:58] as a doorstep in the house of the Lord."
[35:01] Thank you, Father, for bringing us. And
[35:03] thank you, Father, for working at our
[35:05] hearts to come here, Father, to worship
[35:08] you, Lord.

[35:16] battling Heavenly Father Pake.
[35:19] Heavenly Father, we've been born
[35:22] to be children of the most high God. And
[35:25] heavenly father, we have been given
[35:27] authority
[35:29] to put the wicked one under our feet.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, we claim our healing
[35:35] which you have already done on the cross
[35:37] of Calvary. We don't have heavenly
[35:40] father any complex father in claiming it
[35:42] and proclaiming victory because we know

[35:53] heaven come down and sing together with
[35:55] us, Lord, even to the preaching of the

[1:02:59] Trust it's our destiny each one of us
[1:03:01] this morning. Amen. Not by our works,
[1:03:03] not by our effort, not by anything we
[1:03:05] merited. But by God's grace, by the
[1:03:08] price he paid on Calvary.
[1:03:11] Praise the Lord. Wonder if we can take
[1:03:13] our seats just for a moment.
[1:03:18] I would like to welcome all all our
[1:03:20] visitors this morning and of course
[1:03:22] welcome all our local folks too. trust
[1:03:25] that trust that each one will feel
[1:03:27] welcome in the presence of the Lord this
[1:03:28] morning and that we can give him full
[1:03:30] preeminence
[1:03:31] and just really coming with excitement
[1:03:34] this morning to fellowship around the
[1:03:36] word. We've had a very special weekend
[1:03:39] so far.
[1:03:41] Um Friday night's youth service was very
[1:03:44] very applicable, very special and again
[1:03:48] last night the brothers meeting so many
[1:03:50] very good things that were spoken. So
[1:03:52] just really excited about today. Trust
[1:03:55] trust that we come with our cups held
[1:03:56] out. Come that we trust we come with
[1:03:59] expecting hearts and prayed up and ready
[1:04:01] to receive everything that the Lord has
[1:04:03] for us. So I want to also say thank you
[1:04:06] for for those of you who made effort to
[1:04:09] come from from distance and all our
[1:04:12] visitors. I I already greeted you but I
[1:04:14] want to also say thank you for the
[1:04:16] effort that you've made to to come.
[1:04:19] Um, also, Brother Joe, he's um he's
[1:04:23] well, probably half of us know him by
[1:04:25] now because he's had uh the youth
[1:04:28] service and the brothers meeting, but um
[1:04:30] it's um I've only met him face to face
[1:04:33] for uh for the first time on Thursday.
[1:04:35] We had a a brief discussion a little
[1:04:38] while ago on on
[1:04:40] a
[1:04:42] video call. Um but um it's just been a
[1:04:46] real pleasure to to meet him and his
[1:04:49] vision and his perspective with the word
[1:04:51] and so on. Just really appreciate those
[1:04:52] things. So it's it's been really special
[1:04:55] so far.
[1:04:57] Um I uh Oh, the other important thing is
[1:05:01] that um he's not brother Joel, he's
[1:05:04] brother Joel.
[1:05:06] I remember Joel Joel Gala.
[1:05:10] So, it's the French part and you will
[1:05:13] definitely hear a little bit of the the
[1:05:15] French accent, although I must say his
[1:05:16] English is very good. He actually um
[1:05:18] runs a a language school. He's the CEO
[1:05:21] of a language school also as his day
[1:05:24] job. So, um he he's able to to speak
[1:05:27] English pretty good. Pretty good. So,
[1:05:31] anyway, praise the Lord. Um just a
[1:05:33] reminder that we have a evening service
[1:05:35] at 4:30 or late afternoon service at
[1:05:37] 4:30 this afternoon. Everyone is welcome
[1:05:39] again. Um and church lunch after after
[1:05:43] the service at the war memorial hall. Um
[1:05:46] everyone is welcome to join us. And I
[1:05:48] also say a little ahead of time um
[1:05:51] brother Joel is here on Wednesday night.
[1:05:55] So those of you who want to want to
[1:05:56] come, you're also very welcome to join
[1:05:58] us then.

[1:07:09] she's, you know, on the straight and
[1:07:11] narrow.
[1:07:14] So, brother Michael has asked me to come
[1:07:16] over just for the weekend to uh to
[1:07:18] preach some services.
[1:07:20] Um, two more things I would like to just
[1:07:22] just briefly say. So, um, brother Adrian
[1:07:25] is leaving for Indonesia this afternoon.
[1:07:27] So, what I would like to do now is that
[1:07:30] we uh that we just lay hands on him and
[1:07:32] commit him to the Lord for the trip
[1:07:35] also. So, so maybe brother Adrian if you
[1:07:36] can come um and then as always any
[1:07:39] brothers that want to come and pray with
[1:07:40] us please come up and then we can just
[1:07:42] lay hands on our brother as we commit
[1:07:44] him to the Lord. Um but as he's coming
[1:07:46] also um I've been sharing with you the
[1:07:49] things that we're doing and and also um
[1:07:51] brother Mahan and them they're building
[1:07:52] a church building at the moment um and
[1:07:55] we've also donated um quite extensively
[1:07:58] to that fund um there. So, brother Aen
[1:08:02] is taking that money across also with
[1:08:04] him. Um, so just as a matter of a little
[1:08:07] bit of feedback on on our mission work.
[1:08:10] So, those of you who want to come up,
[1:08:12] don't be shy.

[1:08:35] father.
[1:08:37] Our God, we are privileged to be
[1:08:39] gathered in your house this morning.
[1:08:42] Father, we come to receive from you.
[1:08:45] Oh Lord Jesus, we pray you forgive our
[1:08:47] weaknesses, our humanness, shortcomings,
[1:08:52] our internal turmoils and mind battles
[1:08:54] and things. Father, I pray that you'll
[1:08:56] forgive those things and wash us clean
[1:08:58] with your precious blood. You've paid
[1:09:00] that price 2,000 years ago in Calvary,
[1:09:02] Father. Lord, we want to just dedicate
[1:09:05] the service again to you, Father. Pray
[1:09:07] that you will have your way. Oh God, you
[1:09:10] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:09:11] that we're going to gather here today.
[1:09:13] And I pray that you will achieve exactly
[1:09:15] your perfect will today. Father, I lift
[1:09:17] brother Joel before you again. Pray that
[1:09:19] you will use that vessel for your glory.
[1:09:21] Father God, I pray for each one of us,
[1:09:23] Lord, that we will have no walls up, no
[1:09:26] barriers, Lord Jesus, no opinions, no
[1:09:29] fears, no theology, no humanness that
[1:09:32] gets in the way, Father. Lord, I pray
[1:09:34] that you will achieve your purpose this
[1:09:36] morning and also this evening, Father.
[1:09:39] Lord, we're also gathering now to commit
[1:09:42] Brother Adrian um to you for this trip,
[1:09:46] Lord Jesus. We pray that you will keep
[1:09:48] him healthy. We pray that you will keep
[1:09:50] him safe. We pray that you will give him
[1:09:52] safe travels, Lord, oh Father. And we
[1:09:55] pray that you will anoint this vessel,
[1:09:57] that you will give him godly wisdom and
[1:09:59] inspiration for every circumstance that
[1:10:01] he may face. every time that someone may
[1:10:05] draw on the gift, Father, that you will
[1:10:07] be there to anoint it, Father, and that
[1:10:10] you will give the right answers, you
[1:10:12] will give the right guidance, that you
[1:10:13] will show the right attitudes, Father,
[1:10:15] that your life will be on display
[1:10:17] through this vessel, Lord. Father, I
[1:10:19] pray that you'll give him the strength
[1:10:21] for for the services, Lord, also where
[1:10:23] it's summer season there and really hot
[1:10:26] sometimes. Father, I pray that you will
[1:10:28] help him through those things, too.
[1:10:29] Father, we commit him to you in every
[1:10:31] way, Father, and bring him back safely
[1:10:34] with a good testimony of what you've
[1:10:35] done, Lord. We appreciate you, Lord. And
[1:10:38] we ask these things in the precious name
[1:10:40] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:10:43] Amen. Thank you, brothers.
[1:10:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:56] So let's just sing a song as uh brother
[1:10:59] Joel come up.
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:09] We are able to go up and take the
[1:11:12] country
[1:11:14] to possess the land from Jordan to the
[1:11:17] sea.
[1:11:19] Though the giants may be their way to
[1:11:22] he,
[1:11:24] God will surely give the victory.
[1:11:28] Sons of God
[1:11:46] Heat.
[1:12:06] Heat.
[1:12:11] Heat. Heat.
[1:12:24] Heat. Heat.
[1:12:38] forward
[1:12:39] in the power of the Savior's name.
[1:12:46] Amen.
[1:12:48] Amen. Praise God. May God bless you all
[1:12:52] this morning. And uh maybe you could be
[1:12:55] seated for just a moment
[1:12:59] because uh just before we jump into the
[1:13:02] word, I would like to
[1:13:04] take this opportunity to introduce
[1:13:06] myself and uh each time people say I
[1:13:10] work in the linguistic sector. as they
[1:13:14] introduce me, they put the pressure on
[1:13:16] me
[1:13:19] uh to speak very good English, which is
[1:13:22] still a second language. But uh
[1:13:26] yeah, so I I I just uh want to share
[1:13:29] with you how I truly believe God wanted
[1:13:33] me to be with you this weekend.
[1:13:36] Um, and that there are many reasons for
[1:13:39] this and and the first one is really I'm
[1:13:42] just a nobody
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and I truly mean it. I uh I just I just
[1:13:49] pastor a very small church that we've
[1:13:51] planted two years ago out of Quebec,
[1:13:54] Canada.
[1:13:56] And um yeah, I don't I don't know very
[1:13:59] many people and I don't travel really.
[1:14:03] And uh when brother Al called me, I
[1:14:08] would have said no like straight up to
[1:14:11] this invitation to go around the world
[1:14:14] and leave my family behind and the
[1:14:17] church and the business and all that
[1:14:20] that goes with it and and and to be
[1:14:22] here, I would have said no. But God had
[1:14:25] other plans and just to make sure these
[1:14:28] plan these plans would happen, he uh he
[1:14:32] gave me a vision about a week
[1:14:34] beforehand.
[1:14:36] I was in church on a Friday night for
[1:14:38] prayer meeting and as we went for
[1:14:40] prayer, I went in the front pew to kneel
[1:14:43] to pray and as soon as I knelt and I and
[1:14:47] closed my eyes, I just saw very strange
[1:14:51] vision. I uh if anyone of you ever had
[1:14:55] an experience of this type, you know how
[1:14:58] rattling it is. It is not a u very
[1:15:02] comfortable experience.
[1:15:04] We hear about them but you just see an
[1:15:07] image and then you feel an emotion but
[1:15:10] then you don't know.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You think you know, you wonder. So
[1:15:15] at night I couldn't even get to sleep
[1:15:18] and my beloved wife uh told handed me a
[1:15:22] notebook and a pen and she said you
[1:15:24] should write it down with the dates and
[1:15:26] details and and so I wrote it down and
[1:15:29] and really in summary very quick I saw
[1:15:33] the the earth like I was in the
[1:15:35] atmosphere and there was some kind of
[1:15:38] arrow going around the earth and I knew
[1:15:40] this arrow was me and my stomach was
[1:15:44] very tight instantly
[1:15:46] as I had this vision but one week later
[1:15:51] brother already called me and actually I
[1:15:55] believe fulfilled that vision uh by
[1:15:58] inviting me and so um I am very happy to
[1:16:02] be here even though it's out of my
[1:16:05] comfort zone and I trust we uh will be
[1:16:08] blessed together
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; this weekend as we have already been
[1:16:13] those who have been the uh the youth
[1:16:16] meeting or the men's meeting yesterday
[1:16:18] and today will be a two-part series and
[1:16:21] really including Wednesday, we could
[1:16:23] almost call it a three-part series, but
[1:16:27] um just maybe a little background about
[1:16:30] our church. We planted a church in a new
[1:16:32] city where there's no message church.
[1:16:33] And and um when we started off, there
[1:16:37] was 22 of us. It it was about a year and
[1:16:40] a half ago, a little over a year and a
[1:16:42] half ago. and and uh now there's over 55
[1:16:46] of us and God has really just been
[1:16:50] blessing. You know, there are two ways
[1:16:53] of building a church. You do you either
[1:16:57] build God's kingdom or you build a man's
[1:17:00] kingdom.
[1:17:02] And uh and I mean get me right here.
[1:17:05] Every Christian has a right to choose a
[1:17:07] church to call home. But often times new
[1:17:11] churches are built on the back of old
[1:17:13] churches. It's not conversion, it's
[1:17:16] translation sometimes. And uh but we
[1:17:19] have been blessed to baptize new
[1:17:21] converts off the street. Just last week
[1:17:24] was our family camp and we went camping
[1:17:26] and we baptized three new converts uh in
[1:17:31] the lake. Actually, it was just a
[1:17:33] amazing moment. And so, uh, Jesus said
[1:17:37] when he was here, I will build my
[1:17:39] church. And so, we are not building
[1:17:41] nothing, but really we're just vessels
[1:17:44] and tools that that he uses. And uh, he
[1:17:47] is building his church. And so, we we
[1:17:50] are living a little revival in Quebec.
[1:17:55] So, keep us in our prayer in in your
[1:17:57] prayers uh, about this little work that
[1:18:00] uh, that has started and that is
[1:18:02] growing. And we pray that it Jesus
[1:18:05] always stays at the center of it and it
[1:18:08] always uh stays about
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; God's kingdom
[1:18:13] and never becomes a man kingdom.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just maybe stand up to
[1:18:21] read a scripture.
[1:18:26] So by the grace of God this morning we
[1:18:29] we will mostly uh paint a canvas for
[1:18:34] tonight. Uh and so we will lay a
[1:18:37] foundation and and hopefully be able to
[1:18:41] uh kind of close it tonight.
[1:18:45] Don't worry, I'm not a long-wided
[1:18:47] preacher. I uh won't keep you long.
[1:18:49] We'll be out for for lunch.
[1:18:54] Exodus chapter 3
[1:18:56] starting from verse one.
[1:19:14] Exodus 3 verse 1-6.
[1:19:17] Moses. Now, Moses was tending the flock
[1:19:20] of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest
[1:19:23] of Midian.
[1:19:25] And he led the flock to the back of the
[1:19:28] desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain
[1:19:30] of God. And the angel of the Lord
[1:19:33] appeared to him in a flame of fire from
[1:19:35] the midst of a bush. So he looked, and
[1:19:38] behold, the bush was burning with fire,
[1:19:40] but the bush was not consumed. Then
[1:19:43] Moses said,"I will now turn aside and
[1:19:46] see this great sight why the bush does
[1:19:49] not burn." So when the Lord saw that he
[1:19:53] turned aside to look, God called him
[1:19:55] from the midst of the bush and said,
[1:19:57] "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here I
[1:19:59] am." Then he said, "Do not draw near
[1:20:03] this place. Take your sandals off your
[1:20:06] feet, for the place where you stand is
[1:20:07] holy ground."
[1:20:09] M more Moreover, he said, "I am the God
[1:20:12] of your father, the God of Abraham, the
[1:20:14] God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And
[1:20:17] Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
[1:20:20] look upon God. Let's pray.
[1:20:27] Father,
[1:20:31] this is not
[1:20:33] about me.
[1:20:36] This is all about you this morning. So
[1:20:39] may you take me out of the way and just
[1:20:42] speak to our hearts and give us Lord
[1:20:45] this morning humility
[1:20:48] to receive these words in a humble heart
[1:20:51] for your word says that you resist the
[1:20:54] prideful at heart.
[1:20:56] Lord may you be with us this morning and
[1:20:58] may you speak to us and help us
[1:21:00] understand your plans and your ways.
[1:21:04] We commit yourself in this meeting into
[1:21:06] your hands in Jesus name.
[1:21:09] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:21:16] And so lately, God started really
[1:21:19] revealing to me
[1:21:23] um and it really blesses me. He started
[1:21:26] revealing to me how the types
[1:21:29] in the Bible they must apply across the
[1:21:32] board from top to bottom from Christ to
[1:21:35] our personal lives. Um, yes, God has a
[1:21:39] great purpose, Christ and his bride,
[1:21:43] but there is also the local church and
[1:21:47] there is also the families and then
[1:21:50] there is the individual and and every
[1:21:54] type in the Bible triggers down and
[1:21:56] applies to every level.
[1:21:59] If we are guilty of looking at the Bible
[1:22:02] only from 20,000 ft, only looking at the
[1:22:05] big picture and seeing, you know, for
[1:22:07] example, how Moses is a type of Christ,
[1:22:10] which he is, we are missing on uh so
[1:22:15] much goodness we could draw from the
[1:22:18] Bible for our own actual lives.
[1:22:22] And um and so God is starting to show me
[1:22:26] that the these types they they apply to
[1:22:30] Christ in his church. They apply to the
[1:22:32] local church. They apply to our
[1:22:33] families. They apply to our personal
[1:22:36] lives as individuals.
[1:22:38] And um you know these these stories we
[1:22:41] read in the Bible, they are not stories.
[1:22:44] In fact,
[1:22:46] they are living today.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; They're not just stories. they have to
[1:22:51] come out of the book and and come to
[1:22:53] life once more in our lives.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:22:58] my my topic for this morning I called
[1:23:02] the church of Midian.
[1:23:04] The church of Midian. And we'll get back
[1:23:06] to it a little later because I want to
[1:23:09] just uh lay a foundation. And so we all
[1:23:12] know Moses is a type of Christ. Yeah.
[1:23:16] But the types must also apply
[1:23:19] to the church, to the family, to the
[1:23:21] individual. And and the word of God is
[1:23:24] an infinite source of wisdom and counsel
[1:23:27] and light.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; And it discerns the intentions and the
[1:23:31] thoughts of the heart.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; It does, and I pray it will do this
[1:23:36] morning and tonight especially.
[1:23:39] And uh I must warn you that I am a
[1:23:42] straightforward preacher. And uh I I
[1:23:45] sure hope to make some friends in New
[1:23:48] Zealand,
[1:23:51] but I didn't come to make some friends.
[1:23:56] I came to represent the kingdom
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and to preach the truth that God has
[1:24:01] laid on my heart. And truly, I got here
[1:24:04] unprepared.
[1:24:07] meaning uh uh I I used to when I I
[1:24:10] traveled a couple times in the past 5
[1:24:13] years and I used to prepare 3 months in
[1:24:15] advance when I knew I was going to
[1:24:17] preach somewhere just to feel secure
[1:24:20] about it and then stay up all night the
[1:24:22] night before service to try to reprepare
[1:24:25] what God is laying on my heart and and
[1:24:28] then battle between preaching something
[1:24:31] really prepared and something you've
[1:24:33] just had on your heart and so I came to
[1:24:37] New Zealand unprepared but ready to
[1:24:40] really follow the leading of the Holy
[1:24:41] Ghost and and um and so this morning I
[1:24:44] want to speak and tonight as well of an
[1:24:47] exodus
[1:24:49] and and we believe there are three
[1:24:52] exodus right everything is perfect in
[1:24:55] three and and now we know about the
[1:24:57] first exodus Moses bringing the people
[1:25:00] out of Egypt and and the second exodus
[1:25:03] is Christ taking the people out of the
[1:25:06] law and into grace, out of the slavely
[1:25:11] the slavery of Judaism into the liberty
[1:25:14] in Christ. And here's what the prophet
[1:25:18] says. He says, "The Holy Spirit in the
[1:25:19] form of a pillar of fire. God coming
[1:25:22] down in coming down in manifestation
[1:25:24] brought out the first exodus
[1:25:27] uh brought Israel out of Egypt. The
[1:25:30] second exodus was Christ bringing the
[1:25:32] church out of Judaism,
[1:25:36] out of the law. And I'm afraid this
[1:25:39] second exodus uh is one not many
[1:25:42] Christians have walked.
[1:25:46] Not many Christians have walked out of
[1:25:48] the law and into grace.
[1:25:51] Yeah. You go around in churches and you
[1:25:54] just see how the law is still in effect
[1:25:56] in most churches. But uh when we look at
[1:25:59] Paul formerly Saul, you know, he was the
[1:26:03] chief
[1:26:05] Judaist, he um but how did he get out of
[1:26:09] it really?
[1:26:11] Have you ever wondered how
[1:26:13] um Paul get got out of Judaism? Was it,
[1:26:17] you know, fighting with Peter in a
[1:26:18] theological debate? Or was it fighting
[1:26:22] over quotes and trying to make a point
[1:26:24] or no? It was when you met God face to
[1:26:27] face.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Is when everything changed. God is the
[1:26:33] same yesterday, today and forever. And
[1:26:35] the Bible says that with God there is no
[1:26:38] variation of or shadow of turning. This
[1:26:42] is what the Bible says. And so indeed
[1:26:44] the way it happened the first time is
[1:26:46] the way it will happen every time.
[1:26:50] That is a key to the Bible. In the seven
[1:26:53] churches book, the prophet says the key
[1:26:54] that God gave me is that God doesn't
[1:26:58] change.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; This is a key. Everybody's trying to
[1:27:01] present to us a God that changes his
[1:27:03] ways and his plans, but he doesn't.
[1:27:07] And so the first and second Exodus, we
[1:27:11] can find so many similarities because
[1:27:13] they are the same. You see, in this
[1:27:16] first Exodus, like we've just read, it
[1:27:19] started to take place when Moses met the
[1:27:23] pillar of fire,
[1:27:25] right?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; The second Exodus started to take place
[1:27:29] when Paul met
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire.
[1:27:35] Moses taking the people out of Egyptian
[1:27:38] slavery. I mean, God did it.
[1:27:42] God says, "I remembered my people." But
[1:27:45] he did it using Moses, right? And Paul
[1:27:49] taking the people out of the slavery of
[1:27:52] the law. Christ did it. He died on the
[1:27:56] cross. But really, even after Christ's
[1:27:59] death and resurrection, we see how Peter
[1:28:02] is still in Judaism.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But then Paul meets God face to face. He
[1:28:09] meets with a pillar of fire and then he
[1:28:11] starts taking the whole church as a
[1:28:13] first church messenger out of the
[1:28:16] slavery of law. Moses a former Egyptian
[1:28:23] Paul
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; formerly in Judaism.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; It's funny how God works. E
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; but there's a third Exodus
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and there's a third coming as well. you
[1:28:36] know that everything is perfect in three
[1:28:39] but this morning I want to speak uh just
[1:28:42] a little about the third exodus because
[1:28:44] we we believe we live in the days of the
[1:28:46] third exodus but uh I'm afraid we
[1:28:49] haven't walked the ex this exodus yet
[1:28:53] many of us and let's see what this
[1:28:56] exotus is about I won't spend long on it
[1:28:58] because I know you know it but there it
[1:29:01] is and I heard another voice from heaven
[1:29:04] saying come out of her my people, lest
[1:29:07] lest you share in our sins and lest you
[1:29:10] receive of our plague.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; One last voice crying and one last
[1:29:17] Exodus.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if God is the same, we can
[1:29:23] study the past exodus to understand
[1:29:26] where we stand right now.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And we should.
[1:29:31] If we live in the days of an Exodus,
[1:29:34] then we know we need to know what our
[1:29:37] Egypt is.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; We need to know what our desert is. We
[1:29:44] need to know what our promised land is.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:29:52] God bringing Israel out of Egypt
[1:29:56] is a first exodus. But uh when the
[1:29:59] prophet Joel spoke about our time, he he
[1:30:03] he prophesied I will restore
[1:30:07] Sea the Lord. And and this work of
[1:30:10] restoration is really what takes place
[1:30:12] as this third third exodus is happening.
[1:30:15] And it's a work of getting back to the
[1:30:18] original.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:23] So, so in a way the modern Exodus
[1:30:26] started back in 1520
[1:30:30] when Luther got out of the Catholic
[1:30:33] Church. When Luther got out of Babylon
[1:30:36] by faith believing the promise,
[1:30:40] something started to take place.
[1:30:44] and to not and to this morning rather
[1:30:46] I'm I'm I'm used to preaching at night.
[1:30:49] So I might say tonight a couple of times
[1:30:52] this morning
[1:30:54] remembering that the types must apply at
[1:30:58] every level. I would I would love this
[1:31:01] morning to compare Luther coming out of
[1:31:04] Rome of Babylon to Abraham coming out of
[1:31:09] Babylon.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Both of them by faith
[1:31:16] One of whom or to whom the unconditional
[1:31:19] promise was made and one accepting the
[1:31:23] promise and rejecting the law and the
[1:31:26] works and accepting the fact that it is
[1:31:29] unconditional by grace through faith.
[1:31:33] Now Abraham is at the genesis of the
[1:31:36] first exodus. He is Abraham didn't walk
[1:31:40] the exodus out of Egypt. But if there is
[1:31:44] an exodus out of Egypt, it's because he
[1:31:47] is the one whom God made the promise to,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Your people shall sojourn in a strange
[1:31:56] land for 400 years, but I will bring
[1:31:59] them out
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; is the promise God gave to Abraham.
[1:32:05] I will deliver them and bring them into
[1:32:07] my promised land. And now we could take
[1:32:10] every step, every every step and every
[1:32:12] story from Abraham, Isaac, Isu and Isu
[1:32:17] and Jack, Jacob and Joseph and draw
[1:32:20] types out of every one of them.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; But but we don't have time this morning,
[1:32:24] but I just pray someone will be inspired
[1:32:27] to do so. Not because there's so much in
[1:32:30] there, but here is what I want us to
[1:32:32] realize this morning.
[1:32:35] There was a people
[1:32:38] that was the seed of Abraham and that
[1:32:41] people sojourned in Egypt for 400 years
[1:32:44] before their exodus to promised land.
[1:32:48] This is the first exodus, right?
[1:32:52] In the second exodus, same thing. Same
[1:32:55] thing. Malachi came about 400 years
[1:32:59] before Christ and carried the promises
[1:33:02] and prophecies of the Messiah while the
[1:33:06] people were sinking or falling into
[1:33:09] Roman and Jewish slavery,
[1:33:13] boat slaveries,
[1:33:15] Judaism and Romanism.
[1:33:18] And then they were without a prophet for
[1:33:20] 400 years.
[1:33:22] Captive of Judaism and captive of the
[1:33:25] Roman Empire.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember this for later.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; They were in a twin captivity.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; This is very important. We need to
[1:33:36] remember this for later. They were in a
[1:33:38] twin captivity to Judaism and to the
[1:33:41] Roman Empire. And now in the third
[1:33:44] exodus, it must be the exact same.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; As Luther is walking out of Babylon,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; 400 years
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; before the Exodus,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; the people stay in denominational
[1:33:57] slavery for 400 years.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And then this brings us to a big
[1:34:03] question this morning. What is our
[1:34:06] Egypt? Yeah,
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; we cannot walk an exodus out of
[1:34:11] something if we don't know what that
[1:34:13] thing is.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; What are we called out of?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And this third exodus.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And we have to know that we are called
[1:34:23] out of three things.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; We do have to walk the three exodus.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And that is maybe what we'll be talking
[1:34:34] in depth tonight, walking the three
[1:34:36] exodus.
[1:34:38] Just in summary, we have to walk out of
[1:34:40] the slavery of the things of the world.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; We have to walk out of the slavery of
[1:34:46] the law.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And we have to walk out of the slavery
[1:34:49] of the religious system.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification,
[1:34:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Maybe we'll
[1:34:58] have time to touch more on this tonight,
[1:35:00] but I want to read this so we really get
[1:35:03] I want everybody on the same page this
[1:35:05] morning. We need to know what our Egypt
[1:35:09] is.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; This is so important.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; I've heard 25 different answers about
[1:35:15] what our Egypt is. But let's see what
[1:35:18] Barraham says.
[1:35:21] Now, God is that message of repentance
[1:35:24] to the church nominal. God is in that
[1:35:27] message of divine healing to the church
[1:35:30] Pentecostal. God is in the message to
[1:35:33] the bride. See, so we find out that all
[1:35:36] of them calling one to this, this to
[1:35:39] that, and that to that. Three Exodus.
[1:35:44] God calling the church out of the world,
[1:35:48] calling the church, the denominational
[1:35:50] church into Pentecost
[1:35:53] and calling the bride out of Pentecost.
[1:36:00] Here brother Abraham is telling us that
[1:36:05] the Egypt of the third exodus
[1:36:08] is Pentecostalism.
[1:36:12] If we are bride,
[1:36:15] if we are walking called to walk this
[1:36:17] third exodus, we are called out of pent
[1:36:21] Pentecostalism.
[1:36:23] Now we need to know and understand
[1:36:26] clearly what our Egypt is. Our Egypt is
[1:36:30] Pentecostalism.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Out of Pentecostalism, Christ calls a
[1:36:35] bride to an exodus, to a promised land.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; So this is the 1 million buck question.
[1:36:46] Are you in the promised land?
[1:36:49] Are we in the promised land?
[1:36:52] Are we still in Egypt?
[1:36:55] Are we in the desert?
[1:36:58] Where are we?
[1:37:02] H.
[1:37:05] Where are we at?
[1:37:08] And I have a serious reason to ask this
[1:37:11] question.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Very serious reason. And the reason is
[1:37:16] the the last couple of years I noticed a
[1:37:19] trend. Now I realize that I flew across
[1:37:22] the whole world to be here. And so
[1:37:26] sometimes, you know, um trends may
[1:37:29] differ from one part of the country to
[1:37:32] the other, but really I believe there's
[1:37:35] just one God, but there's also one
[1:37:38] enemy.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And he is not, you know, he's not very
[1:37:42] uh
[1:37:44] very um what you say? He he always does
[1:37:48] the same tricks. He's not very
[1:37:50] imaginative, you know, he's just but but
[1:37:53] at the same time these tricks work,
[1:37:55] right? So,
[1:37:58] and so I noticed u a trend
[1:38:03] in our ranks, in our churches, and that
[1:38:06] trend is that people are looking for
[1:38:08] sensationalism,
[1:38:11] sensations.
[1:38:12] People are getting hyped about
[1:38:14] Pentecostals behaviors. Again,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; there's like a a form of going back
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; to
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I see a movement of of returning back to
[1:38:27] Pentecostalism. And I talked with many
[1:38:29] pastors mainly across the Americas. Yes.
[1:38:32] But there is a real movement towards
[1:38:36] Pentecostalism's gifts and miracles and
[1:38:38] shouting and speaking in tongue and
[1:38:40] prophesying and casting out demons and
[1:38:43] and in our rank people want
[1:38:46] sensationalism. People want strong
[1:38:48] emotions and they want the trill. It
[1:38:51] seems we lack the trill. They want
[1:38:54] excitement.
[1:38:57] Well, I I've preached many youth camps.
[1:38:59] This is what I mostly accept to travel
[1:39:02] for. And and I've noticed among the
[1:39:04] youths,
[1:39:06] there is that thirst. They they want to
[1:39:10] experience strong emotions and and trill
[1:39:13] and and they they just they want to
[1:39:15] scream and shout and and they want a
[1:39:18] Pentecostal
[1:39:21] message.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; They want what brother Abraham calls the
[1:39:25] message of divine healing.
[1:39:30] And uh this is a very personal topic to
[1:39:34] me
[1:39:36] because a little over two two years ago
[1:39:38] I left a very formal church
[1:39:42] that I was born and raised in
[1:39:45] to plant a church in a new area. And uh
[1:39:48] but I found myself in a position all of
[1:39:52] a sudden after over 30 years of what we
[1:39:58] could call being satisfied
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; with the formal way of doing church. I
[1:40:04] found myself in a position or a state
[1:40:07] where I was searching for miracles,
[1:40:10] where I wanted to see spiritual gifts
[1:40:13] and miracles and and I wanted to see the
[1:40:16] miracles of the days of William Brham.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt like that?
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; I want to see the miracles of the days
[1:40:25] of William Brham.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And I went out looking for them.
[1:40:30] And do you know where I found them?
[1:40:36] in the Pentecostal church.
[1:40:43] Stay seated for a while. It's going to
[1:40:46] make sense in a moment.
[1:40:49] Stay calm. We're going somewhere.
[1:40:53] As I was on a quest
[1:40:56] for sensationalism,
[1:40:59] someone sent me a testimony from well TL
[1:41:02] Osborne. Ever heard of him? TL Osborne.
[1:41:05] He was an oldtime shouting Pentecostal.
[1:41:09] And he was in brother Brandham's meeting
[1:41:11] and brother Bham prayed to cast the
[1:41:13] spirit out of a person.
[1:41:16] But really what brother Brandham did is
[1:41:17] just he spoke simple words very quietly.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Satan leave her body
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And then brother said it's over sister.
[1:41:32] you're healed. You're delivered.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; And TL said, "Wait a minute.
[1:41:39] We haven't even started shouting yet.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; This can't possibly be. We haven't even
[1:41:45] started feeling emotions and and and you
[1:41:49] know, the thrill of casting the devil
[1:41:51] and the screaming. Nothing happened. She
[1:41:54] can't be already delivered." And that
[1:41:57] night listening to that testimony, I
[1:41:59] realized that God had so much more in
[1:42:02] store for me than shouting and
[1:42:04] sensationalism.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; God has had so much more in store than
[1:42:10] the message of divine healing.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I went to study the word
[1:42:16] and I wanted to understand why
[1:42:20] why
[1:42:21] that desire was all of a sudden raising
[1:42:25] in me to see something sensational or
[1:42:28] supernatural
[1:42:31] like I can't manufacture it. All of a
[1:42:34] sudden that desires like took life
[1:42:37] inside of me.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Where does that come from?
[1:42:44] Would you like to know why?
[1:42:49] It's because I had just met God face to
[1:42:52] face
[1:42:55] and that woke me out of my sleep.
[1:43:00] I was a sleeping Christian for 30 years.
[1:43:04] But when I met God face to face, that
[1:43:07] woke me out of my my sleep and that put
[1:43:09] me into action.
[1:43:12] And now I want to I want to ask this
[1:43:15] question this morning about Moses.
[1:43:21] Where did God meet Moses face to face?
[1:43:28] H
[1:43:30] where did God
[1:43:33] where did Moses
[1:43:36] met God face to face?
[1:43:41] It's in the church of Midian.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Remember we have to see ourselves as
[1:43:50] individuals in the types of the Bible.
[1:43:54] And you see, Moses, just like me, and
[1:43:58] maybe just like most of us,
[1:44:01] was raised by a Christian mother.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; She taught him about the promise. She
[1:44:09] taught him about God,
[1:44:11] but Moses also received an education
[1:44:14] from Egypt.
[1:44:17] He received a godly education from his
[1:44:19] mother,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; but a worldly education from Egypt.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Moses, like us, he had a call upon his
[1:44:28] life.
[1:44:30] He had a part to play in God's economy.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; But he also had a hurtly calling. The
[1:44:39] world wanted to make him a king.
[1:44:43] Egypt offered him pleasures and wealth
[1:44:46] and so forth,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; right? And Moses was living a double
[1:44:52] life for a while. He was a double agent.
[1:44:57] He would go to the palace and enjoy the
[1:44:59] pleasures of Egypt. Then he would go
[1:45:01] visit his people and and just fellowship
[1:45:04] with them. And he lived this double life
[1:45:06] for a while until he got caught and
[1:45:09] confronted with his life. And that day
[1:45:12] he ran from Egypt.
[1:45:16] We could almost say that this is the
[1:45:19] actual first Exodus.
[1:45:21] Moses leaving Egypt for the first time.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; So Moses leaves Egypt. He runs from
[1:45:28] Egypt. Do you know where he's going?
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; He's going to church.
[1:45:38] Moses lets go of his double life. He
[1:45:42] takes charge of his life. He finds a
[1:45:44] local church in Midian. He even marries
[1:45:47] the pastor's daughter.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Moses starts a family in Midian.
[1:45:54] He gets a stable job in the family
[1:45:56] business.
[1:45:58] He goes to church every Sunday. He
[1:46:01] doesn't live the worldly life in the
[1:46:03] palace of Egypt anymore.
[1:46:06] Oh, no. He's a Christian now. His life
[1:46:09] is straight now. Moses is a good
[1:46:12] Christian now. He's a good man. He's a
[1:46:15] good husband. He's a good father. Praise
[1:46:18] God for Moses.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; He's the son in love, the pastor of the
[1:46:26] church of Median.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; There's only one problem.
[1:46:31] Only one.
[1:46:34] Moses ran away from his calling in a
[1:46:36] religion.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; There's just one problem. He left his
[1:46:43] people behind.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody is suffering but him.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Moses is not living in Exodus.
[1:46:56] Moses is in exile.
[1:47:00] He testifies of it when his firstborn
[1:47:05] uh his first child is born. He names him
[1:47:09] Gersam. I don't know how you say it in
[1:47:11] English, but
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Gersham, which means
[1:47:17] in exile in a strange land. This is the
[1:47:20] meaning of his firstborn's name. Moses
[1:47:24] is not in a in an exodus. He's in an
[1:47:26] exile.
[1:47:30] Every single one of his family members
[1:47:33] and people is backslid and slave in
[1:47:35] Egypt. But that doesn't bother him. Oh
[1:47:38] no. He lives he just lives this little
[1:47:42] Christian life. You very quiet Christian
[1:47:44] life.
[1:47:46] Everybody's backslid in Egypt.
[1:47:49] But he doesn't care. He left Egypt for a
[1:47:53] small church in Midian.
[1:47:56] And now he now has a wife and kids and a
[1:47:58] good job and he's just happy with his
[1:48:01] quiet Christian life.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm not speaking about Moses now.
[1:48:07] I'm speaking about the modern Christian
[1:48:11] running from Egypt in the church of
[1:48:14] Midian.
[1:48:17] I'm afraid most believers
[1:48:21] build a life,
[1:48:24] a godly life in a little church in
[1:48:27] Midian. They're living a quiet and
[1:48:30] religious life far from the plan of God
[1:48:34] for their life.
[1:48:36] Yes, they left distance of Egypt. Praise
[1:48:39] God. But they also left their family,
[1:48:42] their belongings and their privilege
[1:48:44] behind.
[1:48:47] 40 years.
[1:48:49] 40 years
[1:48:51] that Moses spent in the church of Midian
[1:48:55] doing work, sleep, repeat.
[1:49:02] How many people here are doing work,
[1:49:04] sleep, repeat?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Taking care of his wife
[1:49:10] and taking care of the sheep of his
[1:49:12] father-in-law. He was even a co-pastor.
[1:49:15] He helped with the sheep.
[1:49:20] 40 years running from his calling.
[1:49:23] Running to a church in Midian while
[1:49:26] everybody is suffering back in Egypt.
[1:49:30] Moses had never met God yet.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, mentally,
[1:49:37] intellectually, he knew who he was.
[1:49:40] Mama don't tell him when he was young.
[1:49:43] But he had never met God face to face.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; But when he met God, when he did, God
[1:49:52] gave life to his commission.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; God gave him courage.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; God gave him two pulls.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Power to get the job done.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Miracle. Supernatural. Yes.
[1:50:07] And there he goes back to Egypt to take
[1:50:10] over.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Before in Exodus, there will be an
[1:50:16] invasion,
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; a one-man invasion.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Contrary to all common sense or logic.
[1:50:25] Now that Moses met God face to face,
[1:50:28] he's going back to Egypt to take over.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Why? because he wasn't called to an to
[1:50:35] an exile but to an exodus.
[1:50:39] And an exodus means we leave nobody
[1:50:41] behind.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; We bring everybody with us. Exodus means
[1:50:47] we leave nothing behind. We bring all
[1:50:50] that belongs to us and everything
[1:50:53] belonging to Egypt as well actually.
[1:50:56] Yeah.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; But oh,
[1:51:02] how many Christians
[1:51:05] have adopted the exile mentality,
[1:51:09] running from the world into a local
[1:51:12] church in Midian.
[1:51:15] They become Christian and they cut
[1:51:17] themselves from everybody from society
[1:51:20] almost.
[1:51:21] They close themselves from the outside
[1:51:23] world and become very self-centered.
[1:51:27] Self-center can include your family, my
[1:51:29] friend.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; They live a life without privilege. They
[1:51:35] live a miserable Christian life on earth
[1:51:38] with waiting for heaven. I met Christian
[1:51:42] that long for death
[1:51:45] to go to heaven.
[1:51:48] I'm sure you've met some too.
[1:51:52] You meet a Christian. How are you, my
[1:51:54] brother? Oh, by the grace of God, I'm
[1:51:57] doing good.
[1:51:59] I work in the linguistics. Do you want
[1:52:01] me to translate it?
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; My life is a mess, but I'm not allowed
[1:52:07] to tell.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, by the grace of God. Which grace?
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I I was at coffee with a brother once
[1:52:20] and I asked him, "Are you brother?" He
[1:52:22] says, "Oh,
[1:52:24] it's the grace of God if I'm still
[1:52:26] breathing or if I'm breathing."
[1:52:29] Something like that. And and he looks
[1:52:31] very depressed. And I just happened to
[1:52:34] turn my head and I see the casher, you
[1:52:37] know, the Tim Hortons. You guys don't
[1:52:39] have Tim Hortons here, but you should.
[1:52:43] Best coffee.
[1:52:45] I just happened to turn towards the the
[1:52:49] cashier and she's just smiling and
[1:52:51] happy. And so I tell the brother, "Look
[1:52:53] at the cashier. It's the grace of God if
[1:52:57] she's breathing too,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; but she doesn't even know it. And she's
[1:53:01] happier than you.
[1:53:10] living a life without privilege,
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; a miserable Christian life on earth
[1:53:16] waiting for heaven.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:53:21] if somebody fits the description this
[1:53:23] morning,
[1:53:25] maybe you haven't met God face to face
[1:53:27] yet.
[1:53:29] Because when you meet God face to face,
[1:53:32] you receive power and your commission.
[1:53:36] Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And it's no more it's no more about
[1:53:39] seeing someone with a great gift do
[1:53:42] miracles.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; It's about you yourself
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; walking in the path that God has for you
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; and redeeming your own people.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; You're called to redeem your people.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; It's not about the show anymore. It's
[1:53:57] not about sens sensationalism. It's
[1:54:00] about invasion and possession.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Mark 16 becomes part of
[1:54:06] your life. Go into all the world and
[1:54:09] preach the gospel to every creature. And
[1:54:11] he who believes and is baptized will be
[1:54:13] saved, and he who does not who does not
[1:54:15] believe will be condemned. And these
[1:54:17] signs will follow those who believe in
[1:54:19] my name. They will cast out demons. They
[1:54:21] will speak with new tongues. They will
[1:54:23] take up serpents. This is not for some
[1:54:26] gifted preacher to do.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. When you meet God, this is
[1:54:33] tools in your toolbox
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; for invasion and possession.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; This is the for the believer who met
[1:54:43] God.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; But that's not what the modern
[1:54:47] Christians want.
[1:54:50] They want the pastor to invite someone
[1:54:52] with a great gift.
[1:54:54] Someone who can put on a show, someone
[1:54:57] who can prophesy or speak in tongue or
[1:54:59] cast devil demons out. They want a
[1:55:03] public show in the church. Miracles,
[1:55:07] power.
[1:55:09] There's a trend of going back to
[1:55:11] Pentecostalism.
[1:55:14] Christians today it seems they want to
[1:55:17] see the miracles of Janice and
[1:55:18] Jambbrris.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Now get me right. I am not saying that
[1:55:26] if someone performs a miracle or casts
[1:55:29] out a demon he is Janice or Jamus. I
[1:55:32] could have said the miracles of Moses.
[1:55:34] The idea here is that the people want
[1:55:37] the trill. They want to see a gift in
[1:55:40] action
[1:55:42] and that thirst prove they don't yet
[1:55:45] possess the power for themselves.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; I want to make a strong
[1:55:55] statement tonight.
[1:55:58] In Egypt,
[1:56:00] the people were amazed and intrigued at
[1:56:03] the miracles performed by Moses. Yeah.
[1:56:07] And they all died in the wilderness
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; and Moses died too.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; And our prophet died as well.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; But the people nowadays they require
[1:56:21] they require that their pastors be like
[1:56:25] the prophet.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; I mean we they require that their
[1:56:30] pastors be like the prophet. Therefore
[1:56:33] asking them to be impersonators. Janice
[1:56:35] and Jambress.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; The first and second Paul
[1:56:48] they were Egypt.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; This is the climax of this morning's
[1:56:58] service.
[1:57:00] The first and second pool
[1:57:05] are for Egypt.
[1:57:08] But everything is perfect in three.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; We are called
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; In the season in which we live
[1:57:18] to manifest the third pull
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; which is the spoken word.
[1:57:26] When we are focused and amazed at the
[1:57:29] signs and wonders and when we are
[1:57:31] looking for them, it proves we are still
[1:57:35] in Egypt.
[1:57:38] But we are called to an exodus
[1:57:41] towards a promised land out of
[1:57:44] Pentecostalism
[1:57:46] and into the kingdom God promised us
[1:57:50] with the third pole. empower ourselves
[1:57:54] not for the show
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; but for the work of the kingdom.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it will not be a public
[1:58:02] show.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; It will be
[1:58:07] a secret.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; And and it makes me think of the 10th
[1:58:12] vision.
[1:58:14] I mean the 10 vision doesn't exist
[1:58:16] anyways, but it's a three-part vision.
[1:58:19] We've called it the tent vision, but
[1:58:21] really it's a three-part vision, but
[1:58:25] Brother Brham, he's he's up there. He's
[1:58:27] not in the tent. He's up there.
[1:58:30] And there's a lovely gentleman, he says,
[1:58:34] taking the people by the hand
[1:58:37] and bringing them to the promised land,
[1:58:42] a secret chamber
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; where they meet God face to face.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And they get out. The lady, she gets
[1:58:50] out, she's healed.
[1:58:52] The vision doesn't show a great gift
[1:58:56] of prophecy or a great gift of healing
[1:58:58] healing the sister. It shows a humble
[1:59:00] minister
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; bringing that sister the Christ
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; and she's never the same. She gets back
[1:59:08] out of that secret chamber healed and
[1:59:11] totally changed.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And then the angel told brother Brham,
[1:59:15] "You have to go there yourself."
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; And then the angel left where he was and
[1:59:20] went in there. And Barabanam went in
[1:59:22] there too. And he said, "I cannot even
[1:59:25] tell you what it is,
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; but it'll change your life forever."
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; We are called to the promised land.
[1:59:37] For the promise is every place that the
[1:59:40] soul of your foot will tread upon, I
[1:59:43] have given you. You possess it. Walk by
[1:59:48] faith and possess the land.
[1:59:51] There was no need for the first and
[1:59:54] second pole in the promised land.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; There was no need for divine healing in
[2:00:00] the promised land. There was not even a
[2:00:02] need for a hospital or a nurse because
[2:00:05] nobody was getting sick or hurt even in
[2:00:08] battle.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; We are called to cross over the Jordan
[2:00:15] into the promised land. Yeah.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] But what about
[2:00:24] the church in Midian?
[2:00:28] How about this little church and this
[2:00:30] little people, this little formal church
[2:00:34] where you could have your religion
[2:00:36] quietly?
[2:00:39] You know, we keep hearing about that
[2:00:41] church later on.
[2:00:43] You see, Moses was a member of that
[2:00:45] church for 40 years.
[2:00:48] He lost 40 years
[2:00:52] as a member of the church of Midian.
[2:00:55] And then while he's he's writing his
[2:00:58] commission and they are in a true
[2:01:00] Exodus, the people are.
[2:01:03] Here's what the Lord spoke to Moses.
[2:01:07] The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Take
[2:01:11] vengeance on the Medidianites,
[2:01:14] for the children of Israel. Afterward,
[2:01:17] you shall be gathered to your people."
[2:01:19] So Moses spoke to the people, saying,
[2:01:21] "Arm some of yourselves for war, and let
[2:01:24] them go against the Medidianites to take
[2:01:26] vengeance for the Lord on Medidian."
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Vengeance for what?
[2:01:36] And so the people went and they battled
[2:01:39] Midian and they killed all the men, but
[2:01:42] they spared the woman.
[2:01:45] And just a little later, Moses said to
[2:01:48] them,
[2:01:50] "Have you kept all the woman alive?"
[2:01:55] A woman is a church
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; in type, right? You know that
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; a woman in the Bible is a church. That's
[2:02:03] right.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Moses
[2:02:06] the prophet tells them, "Have you kept
[2:02:10] all the woman alive? Look, these woman
[2:02:14] caused the children of Israel through
[2:02:16] the council of Balam to trespass against
[2:02:20] the Lord in the incident of Por and
[2:02:23] there was a plague among the
[2:02:25] congregation of the Lord."
[2:02:29] The church of Midian under the influence
[2:02:33] of Balam
[2:02:35] has seduced the children of God and
[2:02:37] caused them to trespass against the
[2:02:40] Lord.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Even after they were really out of Egypt
[2:02:45] in an Exodus, Moses wasn't done dealing
[2:02:48] with the church of Midian yet.
[2:02:52] She was still opposing God's work and
[2:02:55] causing trouble as she was a tool in
[2:02:58] Satan's hand to hinder the children of
[2:03:00] God, hinder them from getting to the
[2:03:03] promised land.
[2:03:07] This is serious.
[2:03:10] And now I'm not talking about a church
[2:03:12] building because the Old Testament is
[2:03:14] literal and and uh for us it's a
[2:03:18] spiritual application. And you could be
[2:03:20] in the best church that this world this
[2:03:23] world has to offer and still be in the
[2:03:26] church of Midian.
[2:03:32] This church, this formal religious
[2:03:36] church
[2:03:38] where you can just live a quiet life for
[2:03:40] yourself and live out your religion away
[2:03:44] from God's plan and purpose for your
[2:03:46] life.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; It's a tool
[2:03:49] in the ends of our enemy.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; it is
[2:03:55] we are not called to a quiet Christian
[2:03:58] life.
[2:03:59] We are called to be partakers of the
[2:04:02] kingdom of God.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Still the people spared her one more
[2:04:12] time. They went in Midian. They killed
[2:04:15] every man. They killed a lot of people
[2:04:18] but they spared the church.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, we cannot say anything against it.
[2:04:24] We have to respect the church. Oh,
[2:04:27] brother, be careful what you say about
[2:04:29] the church.
[2:04:31] She caused the children of God to be
[2:04:34] infidel.
[2:04:36] That's what I have to say against the
[2:04:38] church of Midian.
[2:04:42] Are there sons of God in the church of
[2:04:44] Midian? Yes,
[2:04:47] they need to meet God face to face. Are
[2:04:50] there sons of God in Egypt? Yes, they
[2:04:54] need an Exodus.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; And I want to ask you personally this
[2:05:01] morning as we close to you personally. I
[2:05:06] want to ask
[2:05:09] where are you?
[2:05:12] Are you in an Exodus or are you in
[2:05:15] exile?
[2:05:19] Are you in Midian?
[2:05:22] Are you in Egypt? Are you in the desert?
[2:05:26] Are you in the promised land?
[2:05:31] Are you with the ones on the on the
[2:05:34] shores of the Jordan
[2:05:37] building a camp to go back to
[2:05:40] Pentecostalism?
[2:05:42] building a camp to go back to Egypt.
[2:05:45] They stood there on the shores of the
[2:05:48] Jordan,
[2:05:52] building a camp to go back to Egypt.
[2:05:55] They were saying, "Everybody is dying in
[2:05:57] the desert.
[2:06:00] Do you miss the miracles of Egypt?"
[2:06:04] Really?
[2:06:12] Here's how it goes.
[2:06:16] Yeah, we speak about Egypt exodus
[2:06:19] promised land, but really I think if
[2:06:22] we're honest, our journey out of Egypt
[2:06:27] goes more like this.
[2:06:31] Egypt,
[2:06:33] exile,
[2:06:36] invasion back to Egypt. Because I met
[2:06:38] God in Midian,
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Exodus,
[2:06:42] desert,
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; promised land.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; So, one last time as I'm closing,
[2:06:56] where are you personally
[2:07:00] on this chart?
[2:07:04] Are you in Egypt?
[2:07:07] Are you in exile?
[2:07:09] Are you on duty
[2:07:12] currently invading and possessing and
[2:07:14] leaving nobody behind?
[2:07:18] Are you in Exodus? Are you in the
[2:07:20] desert? Are you in the promised land?
[2:07:27] Lord willing, tonight we will speak more
[2:07:29] about the second and third Exodus and we
[2:07:32] will speak about the Jordan River.
[2:07:36] And you may have a lot of questions this
[2:07:39] morning as this meeting comes to a
[2:07:41] close. And uh maybe this sermon has
[2:07:45] raised a lot of questions in your minds.
[2:07:48] But I want you to know that was the
[2:07:49] goal.
[2:07:51] The goal was that this morning we
[2:07:54] challenge status quo.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Enough with patting ourselves on the
[2:08:02] back.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; We're the bride. We're good. We're the
[2:08:06] best. Enough.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Let us challenge others to go today and
[2:08:11] just, you know, meditate on these things
[2:08:13] this afternoon. Where am I, Lord? Am I
[2:08:17] in exile? Really?
[2:08:20] Have I left everybody I love behind,
[2:08:23] suffering? Am I living a Christian life
[2:08:26] without privilege?
[2:08:28] Have I met you face to face?
[2:08:31] Or is is my Christian life really
[2:08:35] intellectual? Oh, I know who I am. My
[2:08:38] mother taught me. Oh, I've listened to
[2:08:40] so many tapes. I know I'm the bride.
[2:08:42] Yeah,
[2:08:44] you know it here. But what about here?
[2:08:50] By the grace of God, I pray tonight
[2:08:54] we will have more answers.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[2:09:02] Father God,
[2:09:10] thank you
[2:09:14] for this people you have gathered this
[2:09:16] morning.
[2:09:18] Your people,
[2:09:20] sincere people.
[2:09:24] and for the words you have spoken this
[2:09:26] morning.
[2:09:28] These words were hard words, but
[2:09:33] Lord, may you, however they were
[2:09:35] pronounced,
[2:09:39] may you help,
[2:09:41] help us just take these words into our
[2:09:45] hearts.
[2:09:47] All of us came here this morning with a
[2:09:50] different path and a different
[2:09:52] situation,
[2:09:54] a different condition, a different state
[2:09:56] of mind. But whatever the need was this
[2:09:59] morning, and no matter the words that
[2:10:01] were spoken, may you fulfill the need of
[2:10:06] those who made a sacrifice to be here.
[2:10:09] May you speak to their hearts and may
[2:10:11] your spirit indwell them and
[2:10:18] prepare us tonight
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; for tonight's service and that we may be
[2:10:24] ready to hear more from you and to
[2:10:27] really position ourselves scripturally
[2:10:29] and
[2:10:32] help us to be humble and willing to
[2:10:34] change, willing to move,
[2:10:38] willing to repent.
[2:10:42] Lord, may someone this morning
[2:10:46] meet you face to face. If someone
[2:10:49] haven't met you face to face yet,
[2:10:53] this cannot wait.
[2:10:56] But give them a thirst and manifest
[2:10:58] yourself for them individually that they
[2:11:02] may see you face to face and and leave a
[2:11:05] different person than the way they came
[2:11:07] in.
[2:11:09] give life
[2:11:11] to their purpose and commission that
[2:11:14] they may be partakers of the kingdom.
[2:11:19] It's my prayer
[2:11:21] in Jesus name.
[2:11:25] Amen.
