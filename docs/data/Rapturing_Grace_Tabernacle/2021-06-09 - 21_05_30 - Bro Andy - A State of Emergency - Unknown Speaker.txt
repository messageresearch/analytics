fellowship with so many of you and just just want to welcome each and every one this morning in the precious name of our lord jesus christ and trust that you already feel welcome in his presence and that that if there's anything we can do to make you feel more welcome let us know and uh brother bruce can you know you can do all sorts of things so if you have a need let him know and he can make it happen praise the lord being the deacon on duty this morning amen but yes very welcome to allow visitors it's kind of a bit of a trial run for next weekend in a way because um we'll if you look around it's pretty full and we estimate possibly up to another 50 next weekend so i'll ask in advance that we next weekend we'll have to do at least four per pew and we'll need to squash up and be nice and nice and cozy with each other next weekend so but just really looking forward to that and just a few reminders so so next sunday we'll have that potluck after the morning service and as i say there's perhaps as many as 180 people going to be all up between the youth and and the people bringing them down and so forth so um please make sure to to bring enough is what i'm saying if you can't read between the lines um then just also a reminder that there's no sunday school next sunday morning so the young ones can just come straight here are there any questions anything that anyone is unsure about regarding next weekend i trust that all the arrangements have been done okay praise the lord then there's a couple of prayer requests i would appreciate prayer for my eye i've been just struggling with my with my left eye this whole week and it kind of comes and goes and just one moment it's fine and the next moment it just scratches so much i possibly got something in the eye while doing some work on mondays so if we if we can just pray about that and then the other request is um sister sister deborah walker is not in a very good condition her testimony is positive but the symptoms at the moment are looking really dire and we just want to take her to the lord this morning so how about we stand and we'll pray about those things and if you have a need on your heart you can also express it to the lord with an uplifted hand and then we'll pray together amen precious lord jesus father we're just saying about that hope lord fathers you who lord pay the price for every need we may have lord and we want to come lord jesus this morning because we know we are the purchase of your blood fat you esteemed us more than your own blood father that's why you shed your blood for us as unworthy as we are lord you have made us worthy oh god now we come lord jesus with your righteousness presented back to you this morning intercede for your sister deborah lord father you know everything lord you know much better what what her circumstances are like and lord jesus even what is going on in our heart lord and we just want to give the whole package to you this morning and pray father please undertake lord we want to intercede for our sister lord oh father we committed to you lord there's no better place to bring afar lord jesus i also want to pray about this eye of mine father lord i just need you to come on the scene father just pray that you will touch me that you will give me grace father lord jesus in every other need every other request lord jesus please help us father we we come lord jesus not begging father as big as father but we come as children asking our precious father father we pray that you will just undertake for every need lord jesus we

praise this morning amen hallelujah isn't he wonderful who believes our god is wonderful amen hallelujah well i trust you've got an expectation this morning not from me but from him amen because you see when your expectation is anchored in him you'll get what you expect and beyond it amen because god always just out does our expectation amen hallelujah amen amen well praise the lord i'm so grateful to be here and want to thank brother already and i want to just greet you all you know on behalf of wellington and um you know i think about seven years ago so nervous when i stood here i welcomed myself and i just want to welcome me so you know praise the lord with a bit of water's gone under the bridge since then so uh yeah praise god if you keep pulling i'll preach amen so that's a real thing you know let's enter in together let's have fellowship with god i believe that he wants to fellowship with you if you want fellowship with god you pull on him he will speak to you amen if you feel like it's irrelevant for you then you start pulling and it will be relevant for you because he'll speak to you it's an individual affair we're not here as in a lecture we're here to hear from our god to worship god amen to hear from our king and he wants to speak to you individually and i'm encouraging you now invite him to your seat invite him to where you're at invite him to your need this morning he will meet that need amen hallelujah amen god bless you all hallelujah let's turn in our bibles amen thank you musicians hallelujah i really appreciate the music amen hallelujah i want to speak from the scripture of 1 thessalonians 5 chapter 1 to 4 amen hallelujah it's very nice to be ministering in a church that's not your home church you know because you you don't know what's going on and and you don't know all of the things that's happening and so you can just preach exactly what the lord lays on your heart there's no human memories or anything involved it's just a straight course of fellowship with god amen hallelujah i want to speak this morning on a subject called state of emergency amen hallelujah that sounds a bit alarming you know i've walked in here i seen all these fire trucks there i was like oh well maybe the lord's confirming that too i don't know is that a drill or something today it's practice okay i'm like man how did someone crash there you know like hallelujah 1 thessalonians 5 1 to 4 it says here but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction comes upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape it's a serious time saints a very serious time but ye brethren now this is you this is your part here and i'm really i'm so glad that the lord brought this part to our attention and he didn't just leave it there hallelujah but you brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief amen lord jesus i pray that you would just speak to us out of your word lord the burden of your heart be revealed to us and that we could connect with it we could receive it i asked lord for you'd come and visit us you could send a ministering spirits and angels father to help us connect with the word and connect with revelation lord you said angels father to many people throughout the scriptures lord throughout the ages lord to help them understand lord give them wisdom understanding and knowledge and and be able to connect with the very thought of god the heartbeat of god and lord you even come as an angel yourself and lord to give clarity to give vision and i pray today that you would send angel's father to the pews lord to give a real connection lord between the speaker and the hero but lord between us and god in jesus christ nameless bless your word and i humble myself before you lord lord and just ask that you would use me in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated hallelujah the prophet says this in the great coming revival and the outpouring of the holy spirit he says god moving ahead in this nation just as sure as anything signs and wonders that begin to appear that we see we're at the end time we're right now merging into the greatest revival that this world has ever seen we're right now emerging into the greatest destruction that's ever hit all mankind since there ever was a world he preached this in 54 you know before the huge revival the when the sun of righteousness arose with healing and his wings to to go forth into all the around the earth you know through the ministry of malachi 4 and begin to heal and restore and begin to raise a people up who had been trodden down by the devil who had been stuck under dark denominationalism who'd been stuck under the ideas of man for all these years god began to raise the people up and feed them from the masters table so that they could dance and rejoice and begin to dance like the young calves that come out of the stall it says young oxen full of food little calves just so happy that they're just elated they're light they just float around they're just so happy right i'm not a farmer but there must be farmers in here that can know what i mean they just get so happy and it says that they will tread on the head of their wicked with the wicked enemy and and this is exactly what happened in this day to raise a people up amen why to cause a revival to come forth to heal a people to prepare a people so that they can come up and be above all of the things of the enemy this is our position saints we're not to be pushed around by the devil we're not to be pushed around by some enemy or some idea of man or some force that is not of god but we are here and god has put grace upon the earth he's crying grace to you saying come up i'm giving you power over your enemy i'm going to raise you up i'm going to show you who you are so that you can rejoice not just tread like some legal old thing but actually rejoice the joy of the lord is your strength hallelujah you know there's a saying that's been floating around with brahman and i and it was an interpretation of tongues in one of the prophets ministry uh services and he said and the lord said in this in this interpretation your victory lies between faith and rejoicing your victory lies between faith and rejoicing with joy you shall draw waters from the wells of salvation so if you don't have a joy this morning if the devils robbed you of your joy this morning claim it back take it back amen amen and zephaniah 1 verse 7 it says hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god for the day of the lord is at hand for the lord has prepared a sacrifice and he has bid as guests hi guests hello he has bid you he has bid his guests to a feast he has called a people to a supper he is calling us to a feast to sit at his table to feed to be raised up in our identity to know who we are to know where we stand so that we can stand amen in victory but remember your victory lies between faith and rejoicing zephaniah 1 12 and it says and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search jerusalem with candles and punish the men that are settled on their leaves and say in their heart the lord will not do good neither will he do evil this is reducing the character of god to a grandfather making god a dodie old grandfather that just doesn't care about cern or doesn't care about the situation but actually no god does care he cares a lot he's very he's he's for he he cares that can of the condition of his people he cares about the condition of your life he cares about the condition of the earth and he will act accordingly says here therefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses are desolation they shall also build houses but not inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereof the day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly hallelujah the voice of the day of the lord we are in it the voice has gone forth amen the lord has come down in a mighty way in the fullness of his presence to come and reveal himself and the voice has gone forth into all the earth to raise up a standard against the floods of the enemy so that people can rise up and stand above all of it and today i want to declare to you that we are in a state of emergency that's a state of emergency saints today and if you can see through the veneer that what the devil is painting he's painting your lives right now as a very comfortable you're going through some mental trials you'll go through some things there'll be thoughts going on you're having battles you're fighting against things but on a natural level what the devil's aim is is to make you as comfortable as possible to make you as complacent as possible so that you don't even have a need for the tree of life he wants to meet your needs this morning he wants to i'm talking about the devil now he wants to meet your needs he wants to give you a physical happy life he wants to make you real comfortable you know that because if he makes you real comfortable and he fulfills your fleshly desires and gives you all that you need and maybe you just need a bit of comfort so you can turn on your phone and you can watch something on youtube and you get a bit of comfort from that where back in the before that happened you would you would have to find something else to get comfort amen and so you see he wants to meet these needs but you see god on the other hand he has got a greater plan for you amen he wants to meet your needs he is your comforter he is our comforter this morning he is our comforter it's this evening he is our comforter for all things and you see a human being the desire is for comfort we need comfort we need peace we need our needs met hallelujah but if you can see through the veneer by inspiration amen if you can see through all of this comfort right now to see that right now where we stand we stand in a very treacherous time we stand in a time where the devil is warring and raging against us to try and keep us on a natural level to try and keep our minds full i know it i'm a businessman i've got lots of things going on inside on a natural level and you see it takes a great effort to continue walking with god it actually takes an effort to break through that and in your mind so full of all of these things that need to be done and all of the responsibilities and and everything the bible says redeem the time for the days are evil and so it's if the bible says redeem the time for the days of evil then there is a provision for you to redeem the time by faith don't try and do it by some action of the flesh casting this off and changing all that and cutting off and all of those things because you see that doesn't always work it's just you trying to do it but by faith the lord can help you he can change your situation he can do something so if you believe by faith lord i'm too busy my mind is too full right now i can't even pray properly i'm getting so pressured i feel anxious i feel depressed or whatever it may be because of all the pressure all the time and my emotions are becoming disconnected help me lord help me lord lord arrange my life in some way change my job situation change my circumstances in some way so that i can worship you so that when i pray i can have fellowship when i read the bible you can speak to me and my mind is not full of everything else amen who can agree there hallelujah amen you see come back to the simplicity the simplicity of asking simple things sometimes we think we've got to ask a big elaborate thing and and pray a big great visionary prayer to get god's attention to meet some sort of need and sometimes your picture's too big and you've just got to zone right down and say lord help me with my job or help me with this business help me lord to overcome this help me lord to have faith help me lord right down to the very base of your experience help me lord to believe because we're getting fought on every level and i declare to you today a state of emergency you're in a state of emergency your flesh may be comfortable right now some of you might be going through some things and you have a harder life depends on how much you're doing for the lord if you're if you're a threat for the kingdom of the devil if you are conquering the devil's kingdom and taking your land well then you're going to be going through a hard time but if you're standing still and not doing much and you're just enjoying your life and having a comfortable ride going to work nine to five eating your dinner and having some fellowship and enjoying your christianity there's nothing wrong with enjoying christianity by the way i love christianity who loves christianity amen there's nothing wrong with that i'm not condemning that but i'm saying if you're not conquering your land if you're not helping others conquer their land then the devil's not going to even worry about you amen you're just going to have a few little trials here and there but one day when you get a vision when the lord starts to work in your life and you say lord i'm tired of just warming a pew i'm tired of just sitting down and living my life oh why is it lord that these others are going through this and they're developing and they're growing and things are happening why not me why not now amen why not me lord why is it lord and i believe that if you really pray that the lord will come and he will speak to you and he will show you the next part of your land to get he will show you something and you become effective in your calling where you become effective in your ministry in your gifting because the moment that that gift gets operated by god the devil starts to turn his targets upon you and you may be fearing mad but don't fear that because the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wither so ever you go amen do you believe that this morning do you believe that the lord would leave you or forsake you no he would never do that he will always be with you you don't need to fear you know sometimes maybe you've stepped out before maybe you stepped out to do something for god and then your life got really hard and then it gave you a complex because you didn't want to do it anymore but it's time to rise up saints it's time because i declare to you a state of emergency it's a serious time this should be alarming you a state of emergency it may not look like it but i'm telling you and i want us just to kill this i thought i was going to title the sermon this but i couldn't fight back or fight first react or get in there first react to the devil or punish the devil what do you choose do you choose to be on the back foot or on the front foot do you choose because i'm warning you now times are coming times are changing and it's going to change more than you could ever imagine and you won't even realize it until it's too late unless you react now this is a serious you know i don't you just get impressed to say something right and i just i just i just challenge you this morning to say lord what he's telling me it sounds radical but lord i pray that you would show me i pray that my my i would get into a state that is suitable for the conditions of the time because the time is changing it's going to come on but like i read saints you are children of the day and the sun is shining upon you to warn you of the time that's coming of the tribulation that's coming the day of the lord is at hand i declare to you a state of emergency right now it's time to act don't continue on the way you've always been because you'll get what you've always got hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you can turn my um gain reduction down a little bit if you want so i don't yell so loud i do you know i don't yell by like i'm not trying to yell it just comes out like that you know it's an alarm this is a warning i don't think you know all the old testament prophets all that when god got a hold of them you know they want to just they want to come out urgently hallelujah so do uh yeah be gracious to me hallelujah amen amen i know that some of you uh get a bit like whoa he's just getting a bit like you know but praise god you know amen hallelujah and it shall come to pass i read that i want to just read to you now some of the things that happen in a state of emergency amen i feel like we're connected now that's so good you know breaking the ice amen let's enter in who's ready to have church hallelujah amen i love it when the spirit of god just starts to move you feel liberty amen keep praying keep pulling i need you hallelujah you know this is a new zealand government site that says here and i just thought it was quite fitting you know because countries all have like a protocol that it's like a new enactment it's like a new law it's like something altogether new comes when a state of emergency is declared so did you catch that i've declared a state of emergency so just keep that in mind declaring a state of emergency is a critical part of new zealand's response arrangements it is the declaration of a state of emergency that provides controllers redeemed sons and others with extraordinary power like that oh my hallelujah take it own it it's yours you can have that remember that you can have that hallelujah you just say lord can you just say this it's for me that's for me hallelujah you just lay your stake in the ground you say that's for me extraordinary powers amen you've had ordinary powers he sent you forth to preach the gospel he sent you forth to cleanse the lepers raise the dead and heal the sick but there's going to come a time when an emergency is declared where extraordinary powers begin to come out of your life amen hallelujah in the time of an emergency you know the word emergency i like that word because it doesn't just mean like oh no there's bad things happening something has to emerge hallelujah amen it's a to to me in this time was a twofold meaning there is a calamity upon the earth but through that calamity emerges as a manifested son a manifested daughter someone that can rejoice over their enemy someone that has victory this morning someone that can say to all their illnesses and all their troubles and all their woes no longer no more devil no more amen someone that can love their lord jesus like you he deserves you know the devil he just gets into your mind he just wants you to have a mild relationship with jesus but you see the lord he's longing for a bride just to really love him magnify the lord with me come insult his name together oh my and really when you sing that and and you s you hear the name of jesus christ it will cause you to dance now when i don't mean just some fleshly dance i mean it's like a rejoicing amen you see i believe you can claim back some joy this morning because you're with joy you shall draw waters from the wells of salvation anyone that does photography here will know what i'm talking about and i'll just give you a little explanation for you that don't know what i'm talking about aperture and a camera is how much light it lets in it's like a little function that you turn on or you can you can turn up and down and it opens up how much light gets let in do you know that the human heart has an aperture and it's how much light are you living in how open who are you to the word of god now i could preach to you the deepest mysteries and take it all together and make you so like wow right and you'll go well everyone goes well when a minister preaches those things it's amazing right but can you do the same thing with a simple cross is your aperture open enough or do you need to be preached into it or can you sit down in a service and i'm really challenging you and myself that you can sit down in a pew and the morning things are going before the singing and you sit there and get into a condition of meditation and thankfulness so much that you begin to weep and you begin to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory just at the thought oh my that you're here and you're in a church that's about to preach a seventh seal message a message that comes from the son of man abraham you know if you can get to that place you're going to have a wonderful time and the joy because you see if you go walk into pack and save or wherever new world over there and they're playing some party music and you you don't enjoy that music you think it's awful and if you do enjoy it then we can pray afterwards [Laughter] but if you don't enjoy that if which you should not enjoy it then it won't go into you you're not absorbing it you're not like oh i like this you know and start dancing with the music and moving to it and humming it you know the people that do that with whatever medium it may be it may be a movie it may be a tik tok video it may be a youtube thing it may be just some comedian it may be a tv show maybe a music song it may be just someone talking to you and saying the wrong joke and you begin to enjoy that and laugh and have a good time what happens is the aperture of your heart opens up and with joy you shall draw waters from the wells of damnation because there's two there's two places there's there's two sources revelation 9 out of darkness and out of the pit shall come smoke and block out the sun and stop you being able to worship and breaking down your relationship with god and with people and then there's revelation 10 who's come down from heaven with an open book and here's an influence upon you and now to what source you open your aperture to as to what will impact you so much that you shall draw waters from the wells of one of those sources if you sit in service and it's like you just blocked up and that joy is not there right now i just encourage you right now whatever you're going through the cross is more more sufficient he finished the work thankfulness it says i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise and i encourage you this morning right now if the joy channel is not open if the aperture's only a little bit open i encourage you to just think about what he's done for you because this is a very important thing in this hour where we're being stimulated by both revelation 9 and revelation 10 pouring in it's pouring in well you know you it's like you know you stop something right and it all just starts pouring around whatever you're using to stop it or it's bulging that's what that's what revelation 9 is trying to do does everyone know what i mean by revelation 9. you're all aware of revelation 9 right where the dark the the death angel was given a key to the bottomless pit and he fell from heaven he didn't come down he fell he got kicked out from heaven and he opened the key to hell and hell got spewed out on the earth in the last century around the same time that our lovely lord jesus came down amen and revealed himself in his full peruse your presence amen to to manifest father's glory to come into the darkest of nights and so satan's eden and pay that devil back for what he did in the beginning hallelujah be thankful just sit there you know oh lord you know you don't have to say anything it's not about the context or how elaborate that can come and generally as a result of this when you get in the spirit and he begins to pray he begins to speak he begins to intercede your life begins to change when we go down to praying and it's just this duty and we've got to do this and i've got to say this i've got to cover all the bases you miss it and the lord's i don't mean to speak for the lord but it's as if the law to say are you are you finished i want to take over now you know and if you can get to a place of thankfulness and enter his gates with thanksgiving real pure thanksgiving say lord here i am lord i'm just so thankful lord that you did this for me lord i'm so thankful lord that i'm here i'm about to hear a message of truth from someone that's preached from this message of malachi 4. i've got an opportunity here to be changed to be healed to be restored to get victory to walk in victory to maintain victory to stay on and continue on i've got a bright future you know you begin to think about these things you know this is a positive message oh who believes we've got a positive message away hallelujah you see i believe that your inheritance and if you don't have it right now i believe it's for now he's a now god who believes he's a now god a god that is of the now amen a real present living god you can have what he talked about in malachi 4. now oh we always put that to the millennium and yes it does be ultimately fulfilled on the earth but remember you inside you is a micro millennial condition do you know about that who knows about the micro millennial condition within your own life the lord came to comes you know on the millennium the lord comes to the earth right and he takes over the earth and he rules the the perfect love of god rules over the earth with a rod of iron right and we're with him that's the earth but what about now you me who's come hallelujah in every age the lord has come right to some measure to some measure he came to the first church age you come to the second and third with a measure with a portion but it wasn't until this church age when the baptism of the holy ghost would come to the earth with an open book hallelujah why to raise you up malachi 4 1-3 to raise you up as a young car for young oxen that says full of food to jump and rejoice to have joy unspeakable and full of glory make a table for you in the presence of your enemy a feast that you can enjoy and doesn't matter what's raging around you what's going on around you the troubles the wars everything that's going on and all of the woes and even your own internal troubles and struggles all of them all your enemies shall be delivered into your hands little by little we try and take on the whole lot sometimes and we get overwhelmed by it all but remember each one of them has a date each one of them has a date and each one you will rejoice over the top of their head hallelujah each one emergency powers consist there was a lot more but these ones they were not really relevant but i just read a few of these you know this is spoken word training and activation to activate what is really in you in the time of emergency these are these are the things under the website it says close or restrict access to remove or secure dangerous structures and materials to provide rescue first aid food shelter etc enter into onto premises example to rescue people or save lives to evacuate premises in places and to issue new laws without standard procedures amen something changes something comes over to override all of the discussions of man because somebody steps on the scene hallelujah someone greater than us amen amen and this is where the the full manifestation of jesus christ begins to appear hallelujah you know since 1963 there's been a lot of water go under the bridge there's been a lot of things happen amen same as israel when they came over under their prophet joshua they came over the river jordan and they came into the land and they met the mighty angel with the sword in his hand and the ark came over and stayed in shiloh for so long so long and we always that gets ignored almost but there's a great spiritual meaning to why that ark stayed in shiloh for so long and shiloh means silence tranquil the ark the seventh seal the full manifestation of power and sonship oh man i feel good that stayed in silence for all that time and even eventuated into the enemy's camp and then stayed in limbo it's just like what's the message believers doing with the seventh seal what's going on israelite message believers what's happening hallelujah the prophet says this in desperation he says usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation see it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slothful in their mind i'm putting my hand up i'm not going to pitch forkless i'm going to say lord yes help me i'm a human being is everyone a human being here hallelujah that it takes an emergency sometimes something arises and when they do then it throws them into that desperation and he says and really in doing that in desperation it brings out the real thing that you are i like that i like that it shows what you're made out of in the time of desperation it usually pulls out oh man this makes me just rejoice it usually pulls out all the good things that's in you hallelujah amen oh my amen you know there's good things in you hallelujah real good things you may not think that and maybe someone that's looking with the wrong eyes may not think that but there is good things in you and there is a time coming that's going to push and it's going to throw these things and throw you into desperation but i just want to tell you there is a way to be in that condition before a physical war or before a calamity extracts or before trouble hits your family you can be in a condition where god listens where you're connected where you actually really truly deeply care about what's happening around you where you can see through the veneer of the pale horse rider that's riding all over the earth and as the saving people and deceiving message believers and deceiving all the world showing them comfort and all a piece that's false a calm that's not really calm we think it's so protected here but there's things brewing and i just want to encourage you this morning there is a way to enter into a place a climate in your own life right now and i pray that by the end of the service you will have entered if you haven't already into this condition says here in desperations he says see you must come and when you're desperate then god is going to listen to you but if you're just slothful you don't care whether he does or not i once again i put my hand up you know many prayers i've prayed over my life where you just pray it and you get into a mode and it's like there's that desperation's not there it's like you know we get the devil fights us he doesn't let down he's not going to let you pray without something trying to resist whether it's around you or in you your flesh is your enemy right he knows what to leverage he knows how to get you frustrated you know you might be having you're going to have a conference with god you know we get into that place where i just i've got to speak to god and leading up to that it just gets real hard and maybe the family gets a bit upset or you just get busy or the business goes real bad and it's like everything trying to stop you in your spirit realm to to to to to to confuse everything and make you all uptight so that when you you you don't even feel like praying you have to fight that you have to fight that you have to fight amen and i want to encourage you fight back or fight first choose which way you want to work this because right now in the seemingly calm environment here in new zealand and many other countries right now it looks like it's okay right things are about to change drastically drastically i don't know how i know exactly when but it's going to happen if the prophet was saying it's emerging now then it's emerging it's been emerging for 50 years that was 54 he said that he said that in 54 an emerging of the greatest destruction that has ever struck mankind and he's been he's been destroying churches he's been destroying politics he's been destroying all these structures of society destroying fatherhood destroying motherhood destroying friendship destroying relationship destroying marriages destroying it all but there is a one that's come hallelujah and there's a people in this room that have come under great grace hallelujah a double portion of grace because the headship has come down to redeem you out of that to make you a peculiar treasure a separated people you do not have to stand for that you do not have to stand to be under the devil's vices you do not have to stand to have a broken marriage you do not have to stand to be sick you do not have to stand to be under a government of corruption hallelujah because your great king amen is the king of your life the greatest government is a righteous king who has a righteous king governing their life hallelujah you can rejoice you can rejoice with joy unspeakable this morning because you have a king amen who's raised you up above the governments of the earth raise you up above the corruption raise you up above the lies of the devil who would lie to you with your own thoughts to make you think you're thinking him he's very good at that but you just you even cast those thoughts down get active in your warfare get yourself cleaned out amen you know israel they came to a point after they had left the wilderness under moses uh joshua's ministry the lord said to joshua turn you northward and i'll take my people into the promised land take my people out of denominationalism take my people further than pentecostalism don't diminish those things because there's good in them to come but you need to go further you need to progress joshua take my people into the land hallelujah so he takes his people into the land and they're under this mighty messenger who's got a he's got a seventh seal revelation of a mighty angel that descended with a book in his hand and sword the sword of the spirit is the word with the book in his hand and then and under that ministry there was a great massive miracle that that that took a bride who was in prostitution and stuck under the rule of babylon and and doing all sorts of things she didn't want to do and it heard of this great one that was delivering and her faith activated and got her freed and this great messenger that came down from heaven the captain of the lord's host would reveal a message and unfold the very essence to set that bribe free and the bride was set free and she came into union with the captain she came into perfect union with the captain and brought about a lineage amen a lineage that would lead to a millennium a lineage that would open up a golden age for israel a linear german that would take everything that joshua's message said that they could have and enact it you know joshua's message was a declaration of independence hallelujah you know america the left false religion and they declared their independence and then there was a war because there has to be a war and if you want independence from the devil's kingdom this morning don't think that you're going to get that without a fight he ain't going to give nothing up without a fight but remember greater is he that is within you than he that is in the world so you can stand this morning and you can climb back myself hallelujah and so here we have this great lineage bringing coming up and here these people that had believed joshua's message they come and it's all enthusiasm it's all just going well and they're conquering the land they had a few hiccups but joshua was there and they were leaning on joshua they were leaning on the prophet they were looking to him and he would cry out to god when it went wrong and ai and and there and and god would show them what was wrong and they would conquer afterwards and they would continue on and then joshua passed off the scene but the angel didn't leave a man who knows the angel stayed because you see there was a land to conquer there was an inheritance that had been given you know that the lord through joshua the prophet with his message and the mighty angel there he said this is yours from dan to bashebo all the way through to this river and that sea all yours but there's a lot of squatting enemies on there a lot of squatting enemies on there i'm talking on an age level now we'll go to individual but let's just look at the age of them you see now they come out and they come through and joshua's gone now and the elders start to die off and things begin to change in the message things begin to get very very very ominous in the message are you following me now in that time where it's all ominous all the walls and all the fists begin to come out and all of the serpent doctrines begin to come out hothni and finney has hoffnai means fists and fighting finney house means the mouth of a serpent so these great leaners begin to rise up all through the different ages and it culminates in them the final fruit before an emergency was declared hallelujah the final it's like all that stuff that went on and all the darkness and all the evil that went on in the time of judges in the message worse than sodom could i dare say all right because they had more accountability than sodom hallelujah but an age was changing you know adorning because here had been a great outpouring and a great move under the prophet but then he left and now the people are left to their own devices and it says they were with no king in the time of the judges you see there was no one with a vision a real lasting vision to bring what do they need to bring everything that joshua promised this is the whole purpose there's an inheritance come down with an open book i don't have a bible here but i use an electronic one i always think i should have a book you know but anyway he comes down with an inheritance to them and reads it all out to them and they what happens they have to go through it they've got to go they've got to claim that they've got to get that but what happens when he leaves they go down down down down into the darkest of dungeons down into the darkest of places and then finally it comes up and he's a woman you know after all of that no king no lead leadership and and no inheritance really they've got some of it and this here and this here you know who finds that you know and there's been a lot of people now if i come to this day where they get so beaten down by this and then they go i'm leaving the message i'm out of here some great name pastors all over the world i'm leaving because of this brother did this and this pastor did this and this one here and that one there and you know who where's their faith is it in people or is it in him and if it's in him and they get real with god he will take you out and show you the bigger picture to show you what exactly is going on and why and yes it's bad but that bad is actually part of the purpose and plan of god having that time of darkness and and complete failure in all levels as part of the program it's part of the prophecy if israel went through it the bride goes through a similar thing in the spirit the natural types the spiritual but after all that you know and i believe i'm looking at a people that's gonna that's fulfilling this or and has fulfilled it a people that have risen up and gone enough is enough enough of this fighting enough of serpent teaching enough of these false things because you see this message is not a teaching this message is a person hallelujah this message is a mighty living god amen a god of the now a god of the presence this message is that and you see there's been a people and i believe i'm looking at you this morning hallelujah they've risen up like hannah and i've gone you know i just need to bring forth life i need to have something real happen in my life i need life to come forth from me and she she had been struggling for a long time and she had been ridiculed by her fellow wife penina which means pearl you see so a power is forming maybe you're going through some hard times maybe you feel like you're barren you haven't brought forth anything and all you've done is warm up you maybe you feel that way i don't know that's between you and the lord but you see and then you feel like these voices are coming at you and actually what is it doing it's forming a pearl of great price in your life that's causing a faith to rise up within you that can change the history of your own life and the lives of all of those around you and here comes hannah and she rises up and she's not worried about what goes on in the temple not worried about what's going on in the politics not worrying about what this one's doing and that one's doing whether that pastor's done wrong well that one's done not worried are you worried who's worried hey man i'm not worried i've got something a bigger fish to fry amen who's got bigger fish to fry amen hallelujah i've got bigger things to worry about than that amen you see because we're a work in progress hallelujah amen that's going to be conquered one day that's going to be conquered one day amen when when our david is anointed king amen when we begin to unify hallelujah instead of fighting like offline funny house we begin to unify and begin to see god enact everything that the prophet promised anyway hallelujah i declare an emergency this morning i declare a state of emergency upon you this morning and upon the bride upon the world that sounds megalomaniac but i don't know you know you just feel inspired sometimes hallelujah watch and see amen hallelujah what happened she got down to the temple there's all this going on he was troubled at the in the top of the message and all the great leaders trouble they were doing wrong things and the high priest wasn't even he wasn't really stop again and it comes down oh jesus oh great jehovah oh i'm i just i'm sick of being barren i want life give me life i just want to bring forth life and i promise you lord that the life i bring forth i will dedicate it to you i won't keep it for myself i will die to all my own desires to keep that life i'm going to give it to you and a great visitation of the high priest comes over and he says i grant you the desire go in peace hallelujah and life came forth she got serious and it was that life amen that begin the newness of israel's vision it took israel from a time of judges and headlessness and destruction and and and right there while she's there there's all this going on the the fruit of it all and the leadership everything is all there corrupt all the and a woman that was 60 god hallelujah released the miraculous upon the impossible hallelujah why because here comes a woman amen and she comes down omnipotent hallelujah and omnipotence meets omnipotence amen and he releases the miraculous upon the impossible what is that this is an impossible situation israel the message believers of that day were in dire straits things were just going wrong everything was bad but there was a vision coming because a woman who couldn't even have babies got a miracle amen i believe you can have a miracle this morning who needs a miracle hallelujah just ask now while he's present and say lord i need a miracle lord i need life i need deliverance i need healing i need whatever you need this morning you just ask let your request be made known hallelujah hallelujah let him be magnified and so god released the miraculous upon the impossible to change the very direction of israel hallelujah hallelujah and out of her line out of her belly came forth a prophet the prophet said because she was unselfish and her desires he gave her a prophet amen and now now israel now god can do something because see he's not going to let it die out completely if he didn't wait till this time israel would have just ceased because they had reached their iniquity fullness there was no vision but he waited now listen israel's state of emergency one samuel four one it says and the word of samuel came to all israel and i just want you young people to realize this realize it right now young people i know there's a lot of youth in here and i say this you know really sincerely we don't know how old samuel was but i was he is younger than many of the youth in here and god could use this man to change a nation and i'm encouraging you young people oh with all that's within me right now for you to draw a line in the sand and say this is it from this time if god can use samuel to change the very course of a nation under blood a ball and goat how much can he use you amen see samuel had to come out from under the wings of the of eli he had to have fear looking at fearlessness and courage now i don't mean you go and come out from under the wings of your past or anything like that i'm not saying that but i'm saying you need to have your own faith you need you've got to give these young people who is in here i'm not going to look at anyone individually but you you just go you just say lord here i am if you can use samuel you can use me hallelujah why not you why not now a gift is a gift amen you yield that to god and say lord maybe you don't know what it is you say lord you've made me on this earth for a purpose yes lord show me who i am lord what is my purpose lord i want to be like hannah lord hallelujah i don't want things to just continue on the same as they've always been and get what i've always got troubles and strife and just living a mediocre christianity and maybe you know some of the younger people might have only ever come to church with their mum and dad and you you actually haven't really had an experience with god but today today today young people it can go beyond mummy and daddy's faith today it can go into a whole new dimension where you enter in where the gifts in your life can begin to operate and god can begin to change this nation amen right here right here we're it's a supernatural it's not it's not like it used to be you know we're in a new season you know we we preach about the preparing of the lord right we preach about the how he has appeared in this generation and we think oh well he's appeared you know he's among us but really you've got to ask how does that appearing manifest how and i want to tell you now the main way it manifests he manifests is in the offices of his people in the gifts of his people because the revelation of our great king is happening within amen happening inside and therefore the gifts in your life reveal the coming of the son of man reveals the full measure the gifts in your life and not just gifts now i'm needing now offices as well amen so the fathers are different fathers than they were 20 years ago why why is that the mothers are different mothers than they were 20 years ago why i ask the question what's happening what's dawning what's coming up what's rising within the sisters are different sisters the brothers are different brothers the pastors are different pastors things are changing we're not changing them we aren't doing the changing he's doing the changing it's him he is it says that the day star shall arise in your hearts as a sunrise shalom peace to the bride good morning where inside you it's a bright aged we say where inside you i don't see a bright age out there i see loud to see you out there's loud to see you out there's dark and gloom and gross darkness upon the people that's going to end in tribulation but i see a bright age in you and coming from within and manifesting out of you so you are the dawning of a new day amen hallelujah amen and so young people these gifts and all of us i'm just i just i just wanted to labor on the young people here because samuel for all we know was 12 whatever years old i don't know does anyone know how old he was it doesn't say does it but he was very young when the lord first came to him and in the in the temple he was still a little boy but you see now i don't know how long it's transpired until here in samuel 4 1 where it says and the word of samuel came to all israel so you see now a vision had begun to come to a dark message believing community a vision hallelujah because you see you see out of hannah's comes a prophet right but the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy so the testimony of jesus christ in your life the day star arising in your hearts means that there is a sunrise happening in you hallelujah there is a dawning happening within you that is going to bring forth a testimony of jesus christ the spirit of prophecy so what does the spirit of prophecy in someone's life connect them to the vision of the original whatever prophet's ever come before and whatever the word has come and prophesied whatever is prophesied to happen begins to connect the people and all the congregation and all of them and everyone in the age back to the promises of god back to what joshua promised israel now things are starting to hum now things are starting to roll now revival begins to break watch how revival begins it's not how you think you know that song our god is tremendous and says that your victory will come not the way that you think it should well you know it's true very true amen and you look at this now so it says and the word of samuel came to all israel god came down to samuel he was a youth on fire to call a conference call an emergency now it says now so not just you know it doesn't just go on it says now israel went out against the philistines there's a reason why it says now because now's the time now here is a vision forming in the youth hallelujah young people no pressure but there's a vision for me you are the future of what's happening amen i still feel like a youth can i can i have that liberty amen actually you know what heaven is going to be one great youth camp one great youth meeting amen we're all going to be youth one day hallelujah all 18 amen will look like it anyway hallelujah i'm glad amen hello no more funny diets no more this than that trying to make myself this i'll just be right amen amen oh my amen don't have to worry about anything amen physically speaking we never you don't have to worry about anything spiritually right now but you better worry about your physical amen hallelujah amen you know we should respect the temple amen that we that we live in god gave us this body it's fallen as it is god gave it to us you know we have to we have to treat it well we have to treat it nicely and i just encourage you to treat your body good amen so it says now israel was went out against the philistines to battle and you know where this goes it's not you know amen and pitched beside ebenezer and the philistines pitched an affect and the philistines put themselves in a ray against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and slow of the army in the field about four thousand men and when the people would come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore has the lord smitten us today before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hands of our enemies so here we have now a group of message believers and yes the vision is forming but there has to be a bit of a showdown here there has to be a bit of a change going on here god is not ready we think oh yeah the vision's starting it's all going to go real good and then all of a sudden it goes the opposite direction all of a sudden it goes worse and we think why is all these people falling away why is everything going the way it is lord have i got it wrong am i in the wrong place am i in the wrong message no you're not in the wrong message god is working even when i don't see it he's working even when i don't feel it he's working just let him work amen don't temper with the evidence don't temper with it don't try and arrange it all let him work hallelujah he's got this amen he's got it all in control amen do you know that song he's got it all in control you know the song right he's got it all in control i have got nothing in control not me i am 100 relying on him hallelujah amen you see that captain came down for a purpose and yes israel they lost touch with him because they had lost the vision and they'd gone in their own ways and there was fist fighting and all that and the angel just stood back and waited but remember when the angel comes to appear amongst us again which i believe are in that time now he begins to guide you again he begins to give you the same mysteries that set rahab free to set you free to set these young ladies free say amen to set the young man free to break more walls down hallelujah to take the rest of the camp to take the rest of the land that's what he's here for he says he will deliver you he will send hornets he will send deliverance he will go before you to ensure that you get your inheritance and i just encourage you don't be scared of angels amen they're here for our help ministers ministering spirits sent to the ears of salvation hallelujah so here you have this message believing joshua's message and they take the seventh seal and they begin to preach the seventh seal and it's all wonderful and it's going so well and it and it's people are just amazed at how it's all unfolding and all the mysteries are coming together and this and realizing the significance of 63 recognizing the significance of what it all is but not having it that's right there's a big big difference between knowing it and having him there's a big difference hallelujah between taking the seventh seal arc and going into battle but not with god this can be just symbols we can take the book of revelation and we can preach all the symbols and paint it all together and then 4 000 people get killed the army retreats and they get down and they begin to pray whatever they did they got there was an emergency you see they there's a difference between when man calls an emergency and god calls an emergency and when god calls the emergency hallelujah that's when god is with the seventh seal because he is the seventh seal but if you just come with the ark and you begin to wave this arc upon the people and wave it over the people and it's but where's god as is he there is it causing something real to happen are you winning the victory is the land being taken hallelujah and then all these people start to die and then it says here after that they went and got the ark and they took half knight and finney has and they went and they took them in and they died great leaders walking away leaving the message i just want to commend you brethren and i want to commend all of the old school that have been around for 50 years and all of those i want to commend you you're still here you're still standing you've been through all the darkest and hardest times you have survived the war you have survived the battle but i encourage you continue on renew your youth renew your youth like an eagle this evening this today renew it rub your head against the rock hallelujah because we have a source of eternal youth amen hallelujah i'm not rebuking anybody i'm not getting disrespectful this is just what the lord laid on my heart to say that we have to humble ourselves we have to be humble and look at the bigger picture and see well i've been through all this where am i sitting where am i where do i sit in this equation am i half nigh am i hannah am i samuel who am i i believe i'm hannah and samuel but who are you where are you in this story because you're somewhere where are you now you can shift from one to the other if you want you you could have been in one and you can go to the other because the blood of jesus christ hallelujah it's got transforming power amen under this message you see it's like a bleach and it comes to cleanse you and take everything that you did and put it down on the head of the devil who's the one that influenced these things through fear and complexes and old other natures and all of these things that we are fleshly battling with hallelujah i'm about to close hallelujah amen i want to just take you now on a journey to the israel of today because we know that great things has been happening over there and when i say great i don't mean nice things but there's prophetic insight and you know ministers like brother adrian will probably bring it out with full color but i'll just touch on this just for the purpose of this thought emergency you see when israel gets attacked they're the natural bride does everyone believe that they're the natural inheritors of the land we're the spiritual bride and the inheritors of the land spiritually and eventually we will live in the new jerusalem and in the millennial conditions we'll be there but israel is a natural brother branham said watch the timepiece israel is god's timepiece you watch what she's doing and you'll get an indication of what's happening and you know those four thousand dead that happened you know we look at israel back in 20 something 14 or 16 and they discovered that there was all these philistines coming down underneath the waters and getting up into the ranks of israel into the ranks of the message believers up in there beginning to kill from within terror tunnels as they said you see and at the same time what was going on in the bride a mess spiritual murder of great named pastors and big names and and and all going on from within the ranks of the spiritual bride so you can see there is a divine connection between spirit the physical and spiritual and so now today hallelujah you just remember that that this is an intrinsic reality that when something happens there you can rest assured rest assured there is war coming and it's changing things are changing and i want to encourage you now look through the veneer because the veneer might be only here for a little longer and that veneer is your little buffer to get fighting to get ready to become a devil killer amen don't just sit there hey man don't just sit there and wait for your battles or your trials oh man you get down you get fooled amen it says that when the walls went down under the seventh seal message and jericho hallelujah what did they do did they just stand there and just have a good time yeah the miracles yeah the walls have gone down no they ran hallelujah they ran amen hallelujah you have to run run run run run go ford go forward and fight your enemy otherwise you will die do you want to die today what do you want to do what do you want to do are you going to sit there or are you going to fight hallelujah what are you gonna do saints this is your time the veneer is not gonna last you know what i mean it's a it's all happening now hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh i feel i don't know what i feel but praise god take that in love i don't mean that in any i just say fight it is your time this is your season and i endure i encourage you it is time don't sit because of you and you're not ready you'll get blindsided don't get blindsided i love you all you see we have to we've got to stand right now we've got to stand and let god anoint you amen don't go out there now on your own strength you get down on your knees like hannah you say lord oh the nation's changing oh there's coming someone on the scene of my life someone greater than i someone with a message amen to speak into my life and give me the keys to overcoming specific that captain when he when he rescued rahab it wasn't some general thing you do this and this will always he was so specific he said go around the walls six times and then sevens and the seven do it and then shout and then walk run for and take i'm just going to encourage you amen and i just pray the lord will anoint you this is a time of fighting now not each other that's what often i got in trouble for that's that spirit of hophni not each other you're fighting the devil he's the one if i could just preach a little bit to get you angry at the devil i could i'll do that but i'm not very good at that but he's the one that's destroyed your family or trying to he's the one that's taking your children away he's the one that tries to destroy your health he's the one that puts video games and tvs and things in your house to fill your mind with you know unsavory things he's the one that's destroyed the government in all politics so and your school your children go to schools and have you have to help them with it all they got to overcome that he's the one but he's the one that's breaking your body he's the one that hurts you he's the one that does all this are you going to entertain him are you going to put up with him you don't have to you don't have to put up with him if he's troubling you this morning i'm you know we're going to finish in a minute and i want you we're going to pray together we're all going to pray and i want you to address your enemy and i want you to glorify your father in heaven because you see enough is enough enough is enough the prophet said you have to get angry at the devil because oftentimes we're just kind of having a conversation with them i cast you out in the name of jesus christ you know and stupid devil sort of thing that's not enough there has to be a deep indignation you've got to really see how much he's trying to destroy his enemy if you had someone in the flesh at you like that you know before you got the holy ghost and sometimes after you're going to get mad right someone that just has that niggling thing that greats against you oh lord help me hey man you you you get mad right and then you don't get mad at the devil he's the one that's actually causing it it's him in that old nature it's him doing all this now assign that to who it's who's responsible and when you address him you address him correctly hallelujah so let me get to this and then we'll close see this is israel's do you know who knows that israel had a policy change this is very very significant and i want you to listen really carefully they've had a cataclysmic policy change and their agenda and their position of war let me read a senior leuked minister on saturday said israel would preemptively strike the hamas terror group in gaza when it becomes apparent it's restocking its rocket asuna arsenal and spent gearing up to fire at israel as he laid out what he described as the jewish state's new security doctrine hallelujah and i believe that we can have a new message doctrine which is not new it's just you need to fight preemptively don't wait for the terrorists to fire rockets at you don't wait for it you go first you watch him he's starting to gear up over there now you strike him hallelujah amen everything i've said well the lord has inspired me to say here is leading up the joy the prayer able to actually enter into a spiritual intercession you don't have to be an intercessor as an office to intercede don't leave that up to the prayer warriors you are a prayer warrior all of you are prayer warriors hallelujah take your land take your inheritance take it you are you know we this is the devil we just think we think oh you know i'm not a prayer warrior their prewar is that one brother john brother this brother that their prayer warrior is right and i just go and i just say my little prayer at night no it's no longer that you don't have to do that you i'm telling you now it's not what you pray it's how you pray i just want to give you something that's very liberating for me and it's maybe just for me but i have a lazy boy at home and i like my lazy boy i sit there and i i just be lazy and i put it up like this and i go right back and i just relax and i just start thinking i just i just it's like i just just be thankful and then if the lord the lord just begins to minister sometimes and then i just get i then i sit up you know okay but it's now that's an extreme like example of relaxing right relaxing in his presence i was going to sit down for the rest of the service then it felt real good it's the relaxing and thankfulness right to what is it to do to get you all of us don't sign yourself out of this now all of us to have fellowship with god in prayer so that you can begin to see the enemy before he strikes see israel the natural bride i just say that because i can't think of another word the natural church the natural inheritors they have got so much technology that they lead the world in military technology in many cases with security and with all of these things right to to see the potential strikes so they look at it all and you see when they were bombing gaza they were bombing things that they already knew were there but they were bombing under an old policy an old doctrine but there is a new doctrine hallelujah they've got a new one and this is what the guy says he says this is a total change of the equation and i love this we've never done this he said now if you can really believe and have faith in that if that's happening in natural what is happening in the spiritual what is god got in store for you if you apply it amen i believe and i'm just going to say something here and you can take it or leave it i believe that god's going to equip you with a greater prayer life i believe that god's going to give you the spiritual technology amen to pre-empt the enemy strike and that's going to tie in and this is all coming fresh that's going to tie in to the prophecy in the church age book that says when she can discern the antichrist spirit and know who she is she will discern all of that and she will be an invincible army why because the devil can't get her hallelujah so just take that if you if it's for you you can have it take it take it you can i believe god's going to equip you i mean you've already got it but now you just have to have faith to say yes i'm going to have that i'm going to be able to preempt the enemy's strike as israel said we've never done this hallelujah and i want to just finish with this one thought if the musicians could come fight back or fight first you will come out victorious in both instances but fighting first is a lot better than fighting back amen who believes that let's stand amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can you just play um do you know that song um what a beautiful name it is do you guys play that song here what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus christ my king if you can play that quietly i'm just going to read this just this is going to just close it all off [Music] matthew 24 7 it says for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and divers places and all these things are the beginning of sorrows and that means it's like a birth a child birth of sorrows of the woman all of these things and we know that we've been in those for many times a long time now all through the last century and now it's all coming to a great end ahead brother branham says this and remember i'm declaring an emergency and the emergency is the calamity that comes on the world to squeeze out what's really there but there has been that there is a opportunity for you this morning to be to to emerge before the calamity comes to your flesh you can begin to preempt the enemy strike you can begin to become an invincible army and i believe that you need to be an invincible army before this calamity strikes so i declare to you an emergency upon you and the the the realization of all that has been promised as you come together and anoint your david king anoint jesus king anoint the gifts in each life king hallelujah see jesus and your pastor see jesus and your mother see jesus and your father see jesus and your deacons see jesus in each other and anoint him king so that he can be glorified he's the one that can bring everything that willie and branham's message promise to manifestation in your life hallelujah and let the prayer of your lives be equipped with the spiritual technology that will prevent the devil strikes so that you can open the aperture of your heart and rejoice hallelujah to see your victory as you dance and it's not out of line if it's by the holy ghost actually your dance is part of your victory it's connected to your victory if you haven't danced yet then you need more victory hallelujah there's got to be a dance and i believe if you get drunk enough you're going to dance hallelujah i'm not going to work you up into a dance but you can dance you can if you can just get into that place and open the aperture of your heart and you can let the name of jesus christ oh yeah i was in vietnam my brother adrian and we were watching the people worshiping the devil in the town square and they were screaming and i thought i said to brother adrian what if the name of jesus spoken over the holy ghost lips could make us react like that to their reaction to the devil how can he do that can god do that yes let him impact you say lord i need greater victory lord i need my aperture cleared i need to be more open to you i want to be so in love with you that when i hear your name like john the baptist dead in the womb although you may be sitting dead in the womb of this church and then you hear jesus jesus jesus and anointing brings you to life so that you can live like john the baptist in a womb and come out in a ministry come out come out my people hallelujah [Music] it's tightening and when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third poll then see it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride [Music] and the church now we are closer than it seems to be i know now i don't know when but it's real real close that wasn't 63 by the way i may be building a platform for someone else to step on i may be taken before that time i don't know in this presence let that one he spoke about that he's made a platform for let him step on the scene for you now amen we're going to pray together we're going to sing this song and we're going to pray and i'm going to hand this service back over to brother already but i just want you to be real serious with the lord and i want you to pray just let him because remember the prophet's gone but he didn't leave he did make a platform for the one to step on that is our great one our hero you know someone else can preach on this one day but perfect love the prophet says because desperation brings love brings desperation he says you need to fall in love with him you start giving him glory for what he's done for you think about where he took you from who did that for you someone that loved you somebody loved you when you were dark and in horrible places and even all your trials and all your failures is love never fails you think about that let love come into your life in a greater way it'll bring you into desperation this morning let's sing that song what a beautiful name it is what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus
