of these services we were very disappointed when our convention was canceled and you know it's the Lord doesn't do things halfway and brother Jason really felt inspired to to preach these services and and when we spoke to him a few days ago to to ask him whether they'd be willing to do it remotely he was on board from the first go and and I want to thank my brother I know it's there's a lot of effort that had to go in on the side also to make it happen and we we just want to give the Lord all the all the glory in the price for that that it's all come together like this so we're looking

there's very holy girls we were [Music] god bless you greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus this evening well for you I suppose this morning for us it's evening but I'm glad that we were sure to arrive at a place together where we won't have time differences in separation a man I'm looking forward to that hours why we're gathered here tonight heard this morning I'm going to have to try to remember to say this morning so god bless you all greet you from our assembly here in Beaufort South Carolina have a few brothers here assembling with us tonight we're much like you we are on national walk down as it were and so we've been kind of doing our services livestream for the last number of weeks actually we're not allowed to have more than ten here at any given time so we just have some engineers working on the technical side we usually have it several musicians and we we're getting along nicely so I'm sure that you are as well it's amazing on the technology that we can come right into your homes I was speaking through some ministers yesterday and was commenting you know about this coming service and actually this isn't the only one there's a number of Easter meetings going on right now where they are live-streaming from the US and from Canada and different places and so it's it's kind of a first you know we've never been here before we've never had a situation where you know message churches around the world were under a constraint to not gather inside their normal building but you know actually I was commenting to those ministers that were going to leverage technology and use the enemy's tree of knowledge against him hey man we're gonna a men are gonna use it to our advantage and exact a toll I think you ought to exact a toll on the enemy in this in these services and it's just an amazing thing that this is even possible you know we we've said for years that we would we believed we were returning to the book of Acts and we desired that and desire it as we speak well you know if you read the book of Acts closely the most meetings that are held in the New Testament are held in homes and there they went house to house and so actually tonight we're more in line with the book of Acts than we've ever been and so you know the gathering in a common place was a privilege that we were given under civilized law when the church first started out and they were under severe persecution from the government they they they had to go house to house so while this isn't what we would call a persecution by any means it's just our doing our part why and preserve our testimony in the community and this after all every every you know our Jerusalem is our is our main or must always be our primary mission fields as Jesus told the disciples you'll be a witness first in Jerusalem and the whole where you are then in Judea then in Samaria then to the uttermost part of the earth so we we want to preserve our ability to help the people of our community and we could hardly do that if we were flaunting the recommendations of the government that would destroy our testimony and we wouldn't be able to help them at all so want to use the bad part of wisdom and do it this way and so what we I'm I'm somewhat used to it already for having done it several weeks now and I've got my normal spread of brothers hear preach to a man so I'm glad to have them all here tonight I want to thank brother I've never actually got to meet him in person I've met his dad a number of times we've had good good fellowship together loved his dad quite a bit his mom and but have never met or the how I never really talked to him until we use these electronic means and we were really looking for what I was looking forward to being there and gathering with you meetings were praying about not not having no idea that there wouldn't be any standard meetings they would go on in the normal sense and so uh but I'm just in prayer I eliminated all of them and let the already know that I felt it on my heart to participate in these meetings so when it looked like it wasn't going to happen it was a disappointment to me so I was very glad and immediately agreed because I had it on my heart my wife commented she said well you know this explains why you had it on your on your heart so strong and I said indeed it does so while you're standing let me invite you to st. John chapter six today and we're going to read just a few verses and I will let you be seated because we want to read a lengthy reading but we're gonna start in st. John chapter 6 verse 25 and also while it's on my mind I want to thank the technical engineering team that brother Hal Ray has in place they're wonderful wonderful brothers and my team here and we've worked together and so it's been a wonderful cooperation Amen so we're just trusting the Lord for it all right st. John chapter 6 and let's pick up from verse 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto Him rabbi when camest thou hither hither and and jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed a man let's bow our hearts in prayer Master we've come to this moment now and we are trusting completely in you Lord we have done all that we can do to prepare Lord we have not the technology running but it that's came from you and you'll have to keep it running Lord we've gathered here Lord but without you to be in vain what I've studied not prayed up prepared but I need you to anoint it Lord not only to the speaker but to all the hearers Lord may you grant it now Lord father and you see my heart i i'm just before you humbly just your assistant i just walked out here to be your assistant lord this is your message this is your truth this is your word your plan your people you're doing this is all on you lord you are the husband of the bride you're the bridegroom lord and so i i commit it to you now master i pray that you will give us hearing hearts today to hear your word that you have for us lord and i plan at least on my human side i have a certain amount of notes in a certain place i want to arrive to want to preach this in in a series as it were the lord it's ultimately up to you so i am just now here surrendering myself to you in jesus wonderful name thank you lord for making all of this possible we commit the balance of it now into your hands into your keeping in jesus name a man i want to continue reading in our passage from st. john chapter 6 let's carry on in verse 28 then said they and what shall we do that we might work the works of jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on Him whom he hath sent now I want to speak along tonight on a series that I preached at home here only and the Lord has it heavily on my heart even as I was going through it I knew I would preach it again somewhere soon and we want to take a thought tonight on the approaching time of the resurrection and I want to take as a subtitle tonight at least on this portion of it tonight a subtitle God being misunderstood is there in the in st. John's you with what he's doing there they're coming across they you know he had left secretly crossed the Sea of Galilee there they're come back to the meeting place where he had been the day before he's not there they're hunting for him he didn't tell anybody where he was going they finally find him they walk all the way around the Sea of Galilee and finding the next day and come to him and they found him on the other side you know Lord or where where'd you go why'd you leave what do you what are you doing here and you know they had it in their mind one reason why he was there and they had a reason why they were there and Jesus was very quick to get them to understand you've misunderstood why I'm here you've misunderstood why you should be here and you know you're gonna find this constantly Jesus then tries to steer them as as we're trying to do tonight to steer your hearts and minds to line up your life with the vision of God's purpose in your life because truly friends we are approaching the resurrection there's not another age coming God only had seven stars in his hand they've all been exhausted and the bride is now in fear that voice under her messenger that final voice to the final age and we realized that this can't just keep going on forever ever that there has to come a time when there's a completion of God's vision and I believe we're at it I believe that what we're seeing today modern events are made clear to us in prophecy and so you know he's trying to turn their understanding to a more clear understanding of what these meetings are about and said you're here because of the fishes and loaves you think this is just a social services program but I'm not with the government this is not a social services that I'm here to instruct you that you're not to labor for those things because those things perish but you're you're supposed to be here not because of fishes at Lowe's but meat that will last you forever and you're gonna want the bread that came down from heaven and you shouldn't labor for that which passes away but you should labor for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life now he goes down and begins to refer to his ministry of the Son of Man the father hath sealed God the Father has sealed and now there now here comes their second misunderstanding then said they unto Him okay fine then what shall we do that we might do the works of God now catch you can stay there Arthur misunderstanding still and Jesus has got a shock on my sleeve these are the works here's the works that you're supposed to do believe on Him whom he has sent that's not the answer they were expecting and that's not the answer many people look for today they try to think of some work that they can earn their way into heaven by they they have some type of program they they have some type of activity I remember you know just a personal way of personal testimony it's not in my notes but it comes to me now times total in my church a number of times some years ago I was you know praying and asking the Lord and saying lord I it just feels to me like I need to do more for you and I I started coming up in my mind just started brainstorming in my mind and and I start I could do this and I could have this and I could go on the streets and I could I could go into the community and I could do this in the church we can have this program in this program and a program for this and a program for that and and I said Lorna and I remember just repeating it Lord I just want to do more I just want to do more for you and friends the Holy Spirit just spoke to me in a voice just sort of audible to my ears and just simply said to me I don't need you to do more I need you to be more you do the being and I'll do the doing was what God said to my heart and so you know we where Jesus is trying to get them to understand your your misunderstanding the intent of God in sending me I'm here I'm the I am the manifestation of the prophecies that you've studied since childhood I am I am the fulfillment this day the scripture is fulfilled and you're standing here looking at the scripture fulfilled is what Jesus was saying and you're worried about fishes and loaves and you're worried about doing works let's get first things first do you believe on Him whom God had sent in other words are you walking in the light as he is in the light because there is where the purging of our sins takes place he goes on you'll see this pattern continuing and they verse 30 they said therefore in him watch this must understand what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what does that work our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat now watch Jesus correct their misunderstanding then jesus said to them verily verily they are truly truly I say to you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven see you you and your father's thought that that bread that came down out of heaven was God's endgame that wasn't even the beginning that was just a type that was just a shadow God only did that and gave you so much of it that you actually got sick of it they didn't want to admit that they didn't want to admit that they actually got sick of it and God gave them so much to prove to them that man does not live by bread alone you can see that God was trying to get Israel to understand what Jesus is now trying to get them to understand and so he says they said in him Lord evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that he also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out watching watched him declare his purpose Frank came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that all of which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone who would see it the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day and I watch the Jews began to murmur at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph whose father and mother we know now that was 100% accurate and a 100 percent misunderstanding and so he says so they's and they said and hath learned every man there I look at my place um how is it that he's death I came down from heaven verse 43 jesus therefore answered and said to them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I'll raise him up in the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of God he hath seen the father truly truly I say in you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that Bread of Life now watch him correct watch him try to bring and correct their misunderstanding your father's he says your father's did eat men in the wilderness you think that was great there everyone dead and and and the language of the scripture holds out that he was implying a spiritual death see not just and he wasn't being redundant they already knew those men were dead that's not what he wasn't being redundant he was in that he was now cutting to the heart of the matter to say they missed the spiritual application of what God was doing through Moses they thought of it natural that's what you're doing that's why you're missing it that's what the world is doing today that's why they're missing it see and so he says and he says this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give toward the life of the world and you know that's that's what is such a beautiful thing that he suffered in his flesh which which means then that he was certainly a man but as brother Brennan would say he was more than a man he was the god man because the greatest penalty that could come upon flesh was physical death and so therefore Jesus died suffering in his flesh a physical death he's already suffered the worst penalty possible so that you through faith in him by the spiritual revelation will never have to pay that penalty in your debt in your necks now that means that no matter what you have ever met whatever mistake you made however your flesh came into the earth and whatever a bad deeds this flesh committed in the past to the a tomorrow they're all met in the suffering and Lord Jesus Christ and therefore there is the Paul said nothing can separate me not famine or fear peril or sword there's nothing Paul even though Paul even would say you know even even I myself even me can't separate me from the love of God which was in Christ so he goes on he says now so the Jews verse 52 the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat sadness understanding constantly mankind is constantly misunderstanding God this is why brother Brennan would say he's always able to thank God for what he has done and praise him for what he is doing will do but miss what he's doing right now because he's always misunderstanding what God's intention and purposes and therefore he doesn't understand God's actions see all right so that's why the Bible would say to Israel God showed his acts they saw his history but to Moses he showed its ways and that's what the Holy Ghost that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost so that to bringing you into a into a relationship with the ways of God with the mind of Christ all right so there these people without that are constantly misunderstanding his history his daily activities they miss their misunderstanding his words now listen friends this is not a history lesson tonight you're only sitting a parallel look the day an hour that you live in this brightest is misunderstood brother Branham was one of the mists most misunderstood men he says that constantly I'm so misunderstood he said everybody thinks I'm against people he said I'm if they only know I'm for people see so he goes on he's not gonna he's not going to up you know he's not going to take his foot off of the accelerator he's actually going to press him harder who burst 54 verse 53 jesus saith unto them truly verily verily I say to you except you eat the flesh to the Son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raised him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father had sent me an island by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and our dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he and the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum so we find then that people are constantly misunderstanding they misunderstood Jesus when this is interesting I want you to watch this now to show you the the futility of trying to know God through knowledge through man knowledge because these people are it's one thing that they misunderstood God's Word in the Old Testament because he was showing things in type and shadow but now he's coming in the in the visible manifestation now he's right there in real time in living color they can talk to him they can touch him they have him standing there in the flesh when and with it standing there in the flesh they have every opportunity to question him to the right to the face they they can gauge his attitude they can catch the slightest infliction in his voice well he adds emphasis to what he pulls back on what he says forcefully they can gauge his attitude gauges spirit scenes expression here is inflection questioning back and forth asking for clarity and yet even with that they're constantly constantly misunderstanding you know we we we wondered today how can God send a message that we see it as so plainly this we hear those prophets words and and I have said around the world had preached this message on six of the seven continents of the world and I've challenged the world for years bring me even a single doctrinal teaching of William Branham and prove and disprove it by the Bible anyone very few of even attempted it and it's I've never had anyone successfully able to do it because we didn't we haven't believed cunningly devised tales this wasn't some man-made idea the world had had that for thousands of years God wasn't gonna send a prettier God was gonna send a coffin that he could a night and speak through and yet the world doesn't understand it and we hear and we look at it and we compare it and it makes perfect sense to me I believe the message and I I'm not even able to question William Brett the same way I believe the Gospels I'm not even Mable to question John who wrote it but Luke who pendant or Matthew or mark I'm not here to I can't question the Lord Jesus like these men did they could question him in real time the only way I can speak to him is in prayer and I find that as a far more successful way that's how Paul contact they constantly misunderstood a man who he was that's huge they misunderstood who he was maybe they misunderstood why he came and the enormous ly all-important issue of what it meant for their lives going forward let me say it again it's one thing that they misunderstood who he was they misunderstood why he was here but more importantly than that is they misunderstood what it meant for them going forward in their journey of life as I go on in this series I'm gonna take the topic journey to the resurrection we're now in the approaching time of the resurrection on this journey friends you can ill afford to misunderstand what he's doing you can ill afford to misunderstand your purpose in being here and why you are a believer say I'm a believer well I'm a believer because I believe it will do you think you had the ability to believe it on your own I tell you not according to scripture then if God has so graciously revealed this truth to you you need to ask yourself the question I want me the answer is gonna be because he loves you then you're right then your next questions to me what can I do Lord what do you need me to do Lord Jesus and it's gonna start out with believing him on whom God has sent it's not all about not doing more it's about becoming more because the real secret to the supernatural is always to relax the real secret to the supernatural that that Jesus brother Brandon would use language that Jesus operated in a world all his own he he had a he understood and he would even say to them you know we don't understand everything you're doing even his disciples didn't understand everything he said they would you know they would hear him say something and and they would misunderstand oh he needs because we didn't bring any bread he would turn around and say you know where's your faith that because you you think I'm meaning because I said they wherever the leaven of the Pharisees and you think that means because you forgot to pack lunch see GN and when they questioned him brother Branham said they they come and questioned him how I said that you come with all this power and we've already seen you raise dead people we've already seen you we do we know you can turn water into wine we know you discern the secrets of the heart we can see Nicodemus confessed it we know you're of God because you have the sign of Melchizedek that's we haven't seen that since Genesis where somebody could literally discern the secrets of a man's heart and speak it right out to it so we know you're sent from God for no one could do the things you're doing except he be of God and they say so you know why would you come to thee to the pool and hears all kinds of sick people with critical serious cases good people and you literally step over sick people probably sick children sick women sick sick old men and you come and you step over sick people and you come to one man who's really nothing all that sick you healing and you step back over sick people and leave now you just put yourself in the place those people that would be quite amazing yeah when you knew when you believe who this man was and yet you saw him do something but watch Jesus give a real key to his understanding of why he was here and he says when they asked him he says the son can do nothing the son do with nothing but what he sees the father doing so you know we there there's a whole lot of thing about a spoken word and the third pull and speaking the word and creating things and speaking to tumors and and speaking children and and speaking storms away you know what is it it wasn't then in the days of Jesus Jesus didn't walk around deciding who to heal what to say what to preach what miracles to do he operated perfectly by a vision it wasn't here you're talking about a person that were so surrendered to God so completely surrendered to God that he had he had sacrificed all of his will he was only being led of the father and I will tell you something friends as we approached this time of the Resurrection and that ought to be rig one of the things that we see returning with such fervency in the heart of the people that to have their life organized in such a way a prayer and dedication and disciplines before God and then our whole heart of their whole bank should just be Lord I'm not here for my purposes I got a job I got a family and a career Shore I'm gonna take vacations but none of that's why I'm here that's all going to go to ash and cinder why am I really here and what ever is that reason that's what I want to be about the Father's business it's not me deciding what to do what to speak who who to pray for even who'd even witness to what to say stay where we are humble before the Lord it's in a simplicity here you'll hear brother Brown say that shortly here in a minute so here they were and they failed to see who it was why he'd come what it meant for them in their journey even though they had him standing there in real time I thought to myself if they still weren't getting it and they had him there in the flesh they had him there where they could handle him Hoss Paul says that we we handled Peter talks about that we handled him John makes it so clear this was God we handled him we saw him when I was there Peter said I am the witness I was on the Mount I heard what he said and and you find that people who were misunderstanding and even that they say well but I've got a gene of God well so did the disciples but they constantly misunderstood him even on the Mount of Olives after his resurrection they still don't have it there's still don't get it there now they're saying okay okay finally I get it we kind of let sideways there we we messed up we didn't really understand what's all about you know you said you were gonna be crucified when we fought against it we said no way you know Peter said I'll never allow that to happen no you're not gonna wash my feet and Jesus is constantly having to correct those errors and bring them along and bring him home and you know finally they they they he's golf the scene and Peter's gotta go back fishing and the Cleopas gonna head home on the road to emmaus in' and you know what the whole church is broke up and they're all sad and Jesus steps out on the path why you said yeah why he said and and they said what are you a stranger you haven't heard the things that have happened and Jesus said what things now he wasn't that wasn't dis Jesus playing ignorant Jesus was trying to oh of Jesus of Nazareth and they we thought it would be the Messiah and they took him in Quixote man so now the filler day and some crazy women said he's all raised from the tomb and and you know but Jesus point is still the same like I said what things you think those are things what you think we're things was nothing but God's will what you are blown away by what you are crippled in your minds you're fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have said how is it that a prophet said that's what would happen you saw happen and you you're-you're you're saying have you not heard the things that have happened and I'm telling you what things well this this this yet exactly what I said what things because the things you're referring to you're in the perfect will of God listen France this world has gone crazy and we're all here much longer than we ever thought we would be my father I you know my dad and my mom were in the meetings and how many times I would question my dad before he went on to his reward and I would say dad you know back there in those days you know you surely never thought it would be 50 60 almost 60 years later and my dad would say goodness no he said I didn't even think my kids would have to go to school and not only did my kids go to school their kids went to school and their kids are in school and you know he's got children grandchildren great-grandchildren and we're still here and in the world is only getting worse and what they even what they thought back in the 1960s you know when twin brother Brandon would talk about a world following a pardon and and rampant perversion on the street we all know friends that was kindergarten compared to what we're facing now it was child's play of Cub Scouts compared to what we're facing now none of us expected to still be here but you know what here we are and I will imagine that the devil has a hard time figuring out how we're still believers but we are I don't I don't fully understand why I'm still here I know this God's got it all in his control I know this my life was booked for a purpose I know I was placed here for a reason I'm trying to walk in the vision it doesn't matter to me what it is so long as I'm in the vision God has for my life if it's another 50 years if it doesn't come in my lifetime I believe it will I believe the raptures coming in my lifetime I believe I'm going in the rapture and there's nothing I can do to stop because I caught a vision come into the mind of Christ I'm not questioning his actions any law doesn't matter to me what the devil does I've stopped caring about it a long time ago this world means very little to me I see myself as having only one purpose of any value at all and that is that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings of need me hallelujah they failed to see the true meaning and purpose of God they had failed to see it since the days of Moses to that very hour and they still weren't getting if that's true and it is if they failed to see it including disciples misunderstood and they catch him on the Mount of Olives before the Ascension they say okay finally you know they come to one point in his earthly ministry they say Lord now we believe and Jesus said do you finally now believe and they catch him on them on the Mount of Olives okay we get it yeah we misunderstood it we can't have that wrong okay okay okay now we're all back it's all good okay now now okay now okay now will you restore the kingdom I understand we're trying to run ahead of the picture and I was against your crucifixion and all I don't know yeah we were fools and slow hard we didn't I can ran for the hills and but you know but now will you now restore the kingdom and Jesus says fellas you're still not he's still not said you know do you really think that God that God's plan was to stay bottled up and one body walking the shores of Galilee going about doing good is that what you think his plan it was didn't I tell you that except the corn of wheat died abideth alone yeah what do you think that was about that I said if it if it died then it can bring forth many don't you on stand that that I'm only the beginning of the creation of God don't you understand that I'm the prototype that I and I'm the firstborn among many brethren here's what's gonna happen you're gonna tarry in Jerusalem till you be endued with power as far as my coming that's in the father's hand the kingdom gets restored that's in God's hand I don't even know when that's gonna happen but you're gonna receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you're gonna be a witness unto me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the other most part of the earth you know it's interesting to me I read there where Paul talks about there's better than 500 people heard that sermon by the time 10 days in the upper room there's only 120 people now I don't know what happened 80 people I don't know if they have too often been like us and get a little too impatient you know like us and miss out on the opportunities that God has I don't know surely if they were God's family God got a hold of it later I know that after that day 3,000 more came in and you don't come in you don't have a church till the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have the body of Christ to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so we realized then that when they call that that in doing power then now watch when they come out on and they come rolling out and down the steps and out the windows and into the streets and then the people are still misunderstanding them they say you're drunk but now Peters got something more than he used to have you're not saying no you're misunderstanding the plan of God we're not drunk like you think this is Scripture this is prophecy we are now you have a hard time hearing Jesus what's the living bread guess what now there's a hundred and twenty Jesus is watching her and by the time he got done preaching and they have a baptism 3,000 more Jesus this water this is the message of the hour that came to us in our day came to restore us back to that to pick up that church began to decline and the and the message of the hour comes at the end time to to come to that cresting over point that apex were they begin to decline to picked it up from there and move us on into the resurrection that was promised in this last day so the question then is is so loud and so obvious should be obvious to us all to ask ourselves today if they including including his own elected children if they misunderstood him when they had him in real time in the flesh and could question him and hear its inflections and catch his attitude and even if they were the gene of God and if they could misunderstand him in the flesh how do you ever expect to understand his movements and you don't even have the opportunity to see him in the flesh so how do you have a chance if you don't have a life activated by the Holy Ghost and how even if you're born again of the Spirit of God say I've had an experience 35 years ago fine where is it tonight because there has to be like Jesus there's got to be that continual your Jesus didn't save you and say okay you're saved see you in the rapture that's not why I'm saved you didn't save your friends just to keep you from destruction he puts you into the body for a purpose I got elements on my body and they have a purpose how do we hope to really get our own life's purpose and direction how do we expect to understand it without a passion of an in deep relationship with a person of Christ in his word ask yourselves that question at the start of these meetings my friends you sitting your homes you know we but they already didn't have a vision just uh you know we're gonna have some services and we're gonna hear some preaching and understand some doctrine that's not what it's about we're on a journey we're here for a reason we're going somewhere I'm glad because this world is not surviving and I'm ready to move on to the next one there's got to be that element down in our lives where we take a hold of that purpose of God and you know I've said many times that yes we are waiting on the old ship of Zion but the Lord never told us to go down to the docks and sit on our luggage it's not what its devour uh Jesus would even say the fields are ripe in the harvest but the laborers are few that's the problem pray in the Lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers and brother Brennan says how interesting he he was the Lord of the harvest and he's saying to them pray to the Lord of the harvest what he's saying to them is listen I want to do this but I need you to ask me do you understand I want you involved you understand that I want my words to speak through your words I want I have I'm not gonna use my feet my feet are never gonna touch this ground until I come riding out in revelation 19 and set my feet on the earth at last to take it back over and rebuild it for a millennial world but my feet are gonna be your feet my hands are gonna be your hands my lips are gonna be your lips and you're never going to walk where he wants you to handle what he needs you to setting' what he desires you to unless he is down deep inside in the control tower you'll you'll you'll walk your own steps in your own way and handle your own things and say your own words and come to your own conclusions and I promise you your life will your journey will be a million miles away from the vision God had for you brother Branham said I'm the most misunderstood man it's a minister he he you know he he comes in in 1962 and he's he's desiring he's coming to the pulpit he's desiring to teach the church about endtime evangelism he wants to preach it as a sermon but he says I can't preach it tonight I'm gonna have to wait he doesn't get it for another week he said I'm gonna take questions and answers tonight because you know he said I've been so misunderstood he says you know a man tells the story about a man came to him you know brother Branham on it the doctor says I need to have a surgery and but now brother Branham I'm so sure that you know the coming of the Lord is so imminent maybe I don't need to have that surgery what do you think for the bill brother Branham it discouraged him well the Branham says it made me feel real bad he said I thought have I have I not been clear have I been so unclear that he said don't you people realize that I don't know when he's coming he he may not come for another thousand years yet he may come in the morning he may come before the end of the service he said no one knows when he's coming it was so important to them that they don't that they don't just check out because listen friends if we were going to check out at the level of the craziness of the world they had fifty years ago we wouldn't even be in the game at this point I'm here to tell you the world is probably fifty thousand times more evil and more wicked and the lid had just been torn off of Helen and brother branham's day we find it today friends that everything that used to be right is now thought of as wrong and everything that used to be wrong is now thought of us not only right but normal advisable and it's recommended and if you don't go along with it it now comes your persecution so we're literally facing criticism because we're not crazy you're literally facing the the angst of the world and there what's with you people know yeah you're caught you don't even believe in same-sex marriage you must be a caught and sometimes I I hear their arguments and I just say have I just died and gone to some other parallel universe how is it that the church for 2000 years understood the scripture to mean this and that doesn't mean that anymore or it means this about families and marriage and women and men and children and this is how it is how we always believed it was and now because I'm still believing how it was and I'm not I'm not subscribing to your upside down and side out theories of what's right and wrong and you know as far as the world is concerned there's nothing right and wrong it's all relative well it's not true there's a writing those are wrong if if there was no God then there would be no right or wrong it would just be every man's opinion but because he is then there's a right and there's a wrong if you believe he is you cannot dismiss right and wrong and I certainly believe he is and brother branham he he comes to you know he's trying to say I'm so misunderstood and you know the world it's it's amazing that the things that get said about him ah in the day and hour that we live in and you know I I just say wow what a misunderstanding of such a lovely man a man who loved people man who gave his life to the gospel of man who refused fortune and glory over and over and over again and a man who literally literally he he he went home he had his his fatal accident on his way to serve the Lord in another set of series of meetings this was a man who would roll in one side of the bed just long enough to roll off the other side and and going and going and going and and the things that he went through and the world they the world of things and they make all kinds of horrible accusations and and yet none of his critics back in that day ever criticized him in that way even people who disagreed with his doctor no one questioned his character no one questioned him hit him as a man as a Christian and you know it becomes ridiculous to the end of stupidity today some of the things that they they've misunderstood a man who loved people I think it's sad it's a sad reality and you know sometimes I say Lord you have mercy we haven't always represented this thing right I mean come on let's just admit that we haven't always represented this thing I just say Lord God that way however if I've failed that it got me tonight got me tonight today help me on this day to say from this hour at Easter time in 2020 I'm gonna get with the vision I'm gonna allow my life to come into the cycle of what God has I believe that I'm approaching the resurrection to time to be deadly serious he talks about a sign and a voice and I I don't want to get down into the trenches of it too too deeply but he talks about how there had to be a sign of a voice and you know he goes back to Abraham Abraham had the sign that was one thing you know but then there was a voice with it John saw a pillar of fire but it was a message with it so he doesn't that's not just if you have a sign but then brother instead watch that voice and that's that's to me that is the comforting thing that I see in this hour I've seen ministries with supernatural signs that brother Branham wasn't the only man who got people healed in his prayer life but if there's even people impersonate a profit and do discernment with a high degree of accuracy that's not a that's not what it's about there's people who can get it prayers through but but I'm so thankful today that I'm not following a sign of following a voice the sign was only to get my attention it was just an attraction on the mountain but what followed it a message that and what would how do I know the message is true because it does what the Senate would do turn me back to the faith of the Father and where witnesses and you and your homes your witnesses yes that's what this message has done it has literally turned me back to an old-fashioned believer it has turned me back to someone who believes every word of God and my faith even sir even in tunnels beyond my understanding I even believe things but my faith is perfect in his word other balances don't fail to see that sign and the voice of the sign in 1964 don't fail to see that sign of a pillar of fire that God has vindicated and the voice behind it to turn back to God back to God don't let it pass you there is a sign and a voice they come and they ask him brother Branham 1963 qat on the seals with the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture and brother Branham says sure that's what's going on right now so what's going on right now the Bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour the Bride of Christ sure she consists of apostles promise teacher evangelists pastors that write the Bible thanks the Bride of Christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry the ministry of the hour but now watch it's so humble yeah amen see so they're asking when we have a ministry yes it's the Bride of Christ that's the ministry that's what the world is missing when this message came that it literally stood a people up on the earth who are the who are the bread on earth to the heavenly bridegroom and they have his voice and they have his life and they think they the signs that they perform and and the lives that they live which is even a greater sign even the greater sign I mean it's one thing it's one thing to speak a storm out of existence you might do that on a given day but how about your day-to-day life how about your everyday how about not just a day standing in Colorado or standing and praying and say you know this tumor or this not that's fine that's well well and fine what did God God showed it as a demonstration certainly fine we love that however God wants to do it but what about my day to day everyday my walking around and talking life my prayer life my testimony my witness in the world in an age I might add that is quite impossible to be that I'm gonna take something friends you're living in an age of impossibility there's no way to be an overcomer in this age it's just too wicked there's no way to do it if God had not sent a message and came with that message and put it into your heart by the Holy Ghost and now that word he Christ the word lives through you there's no way you could never survive this and that's why I can see people and and the yet though believers they may be children of God that he may be but I can tell you just when spending a little bit of time around and where their prayer life is I can tell you what the church habits are I don't even have to know them just hang around with them a little while because there's no way that you're gonna come into the presence of God on a regular basis and look like Leo to see it there's no way you're gonna spend quality time with the Lord there's no way you're gonna come around the fellowship with the Saints and go away not looking like that see so he says sure she's got a ministry a great ministry the ministry given of the hour it'll be so humble I've got a hurry all right I'm coming out to a I'm gonna hit my pause button we're not gonna finish as I said in the beginning this is developing a series and so I'll just hit a pause button and we'll pause and then we'll come back up tomorrow so she's got a ministry see a great ministry the ministry of the hour now it'll be so humble so that's what I was saying earlier see it's not a it's not deciding what to do but moving only by thus saith the Lord see you're it's like this I said years ago some of you know brother Branham said she has thus sayeth the Lord or she keeps still and people right away struggle ok well I know how will I know what if I get it wrong and you're acting like this is something you got to figure out and I just said I gave this example I've been in Africa I've been right near wild lions it was not fun you'd think it would be amazing but I was right near wild lions when they and they weren't even roaring at me they just from that guttural sound that came up from within them and I understood then for the first time as a brother down here a and we were standing there looking at him thankfully there was two sets of steel bars between us and there's steel bars here in a little ways and no more steel bars and then they were in a steel box behind steel bars but probably 10 10 to 12 feet away and then and and one of them looked like he was an old lion and he wasn't too interested in us but there was another one that they had caught and this guy had blood in his eyes man you could tell he had killed killed before many times and he'd come right to the edge of the cage and those eyes locked in on me and brother Donnie and he does somehow he didn't even roaring his wealth ooh and brother Donnie and I both went it literally was a physical thing something about the resonance I've always heard when a lion roars you die afraid they impair Eliza's you I experienced it all he did was just have some kind of uh some sound that he made looking at me like I want to kill you and literally brother Donnie and I both wiggled and brother Donnie said whew I'm getting out of here and we immediately walked away you know Anna and so I said this I've said you know if you were walking in the jungle and the lion walked up behind you and roared I promise you no one would have to tap you on the shoulder and say you should be afraid that's a lion no one would have to tell you no one would have to instruct you you wouldn't need a manual you wouldn't need to read a quote you wouldn't need to pray you wouldn't need to do anything it would be so real upon you I promise you fear would nearly paralyze you and when brother Branham says she has thus sayeth the Lord oh she keep still this is not this is not a Gordian knot this is not to confuse you this is not for you to struggle and worry oh goodness how well I know what if I miss it what if I don't hear it clear let me tell you something friends when the voice of God sounds it sounds like a trumpet you don't have to worry about Missy don't spend your time trying to figure out what you need to be doing spend your time getting so close to Christ that when these stakes you couldn't help but hear it go cut help but know it you couldn't have been possible for you to miss it people tried to people spend a lot of time and burn a lot of fuel trying to live overcoming lies grit their teeth and ironclad will and I'm gonna you know I'm gonna turn away and I'm gonna believe it and Jesus loves me and this I know for the Bible tells me so and and they walk around like I'm gonna win I'm gonna I'm gonna beat the devil I'm not gonna fail to that I'm not gonna fall that that's just human well I'm here to tell you get those teeth burglar punch those fists threaten the devil all you want you know you distributists retreated in his castle he'll call this door and he'll close it and he'll just wait you out and when all of that zeal and all this meeting goes away and you're months down the road and you haven't been able to be in church then you know what he does he lowers the drawbridge comes right back out and invades your whole life yeah I'm not here to use my will or my mind to try to beat him the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee from you does it but the Bible first says that you must submit yourselves to God then you resist the devil nobody ever resisted the devil without first submitting themselves to God so don't waste your time trying to build yourself up to some spiritual Superman so that you can grit your teeth and beat the devil out of your life spend your time better spend your time on your knees spend your time in the word spend your time talking to God get close to him love him he loves you this is where your strength will come from this is where your perfect understanding will come from he said anytime it's humility don't forget that he says I want to warn you again when God predicts anything great to happen the people looking so far away by the wisdom till they miss what happens yeah God says anything is great the world laughs out of that bunch of ignoramuses but when the great world and the great high church says boy that's glorious God says bunch of ignoramus so you see you have to watch so it's not unless why brother Branham would teach us it's not it's not about us making ourselves odd it's not you it's and it's not God pushing you into a mold and shoving is to a motive and then putting you in closing the mold waiting for it to take it open and open down there's a nice overcomer I brother brought him with use different language he would say it's not God pushing you through a pipe molding you it's not forming you when I am old you understand you're gonna have to overcome and it's the overcomer that God is looking for and so it's not us making ourselves odd it's rather living according to the word that the world has passed on the world has passed on it and it's left to us to believe it then this gives the true family of God the ability to see the word made manifest in realities in a real sense in the realities of God's only provided way it's the only path to surety is through that deep passionate relationship with Christ think of a think of friends think of what a benefit it is to not be fooled into thinking peace and safety think of what a payoff that's going to have that you're not going to be fooled by thinking with the world peace and safety see so he says he'll you know when he takes them to Isaiah 40 and the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and brother Branham says oh you know they thought when this man comes he'll point his finger he'll move mountains all the low places the ditches will be brought up that all the rough places will be smooth out boy what a misunderstanding that was see brother will plant corn and every field around here we're going to do great things when this man comes they was expecting God to take the crane and turn on it and bring the corridor down come on down the great reformer forerunner of the Messiah and as soon as he's gone they'll pull it back up and the ministries over they'll crank it down again put it right down beside the seminary say all right my beloved son walk down and tell him see Homer says when he come by whatever it happened here come a man that know none of their schools didn't have a fellowship card didn't have no credentials nobody ever knowed he went to school a day in his life you couldn't even tell by his talking he didn't he didn't even talk in the terms of ecclesiastics he talked about serpents and axes wilderness and things like that and reason he talked not in the terms of the ecclesiastical said of his day or any day see his language was humble friends this was this was a mark of the prophet that came in our day his language was humble and revealing supernatural meaning the ecclesiastical world completely overlooks it and misses it entirely I'm glad I see it says first thing you know he's standing there one day said yes he's standing in your midst see no watch he's gonna he's gonna do hit you with two things here I'm gonna close on this he's gonna he's gonna point two things you gotta be careful as I'm reading this is important to catch both sides of it first John is going to declare he's in the midst of you he's on the scene right now I don't know who it is yet but I know he's here John how do you know because I know who I am and I wouldn't be here if he wasn't there he got that and then the second phase then one day John's went trying to go there he is there he is that's the one I told you remember I told you he was in the midst there he is now watch brother branham unfold this drama first thing you know he's standing there one day said yes he's standing in your midst he was so sure he was that forerunner he knowed who he was see and they asked him what shall we do here's John sang he's among you now yeah and everybody said what shall we do shall we quit doing this should we stop doing this remember the man who asked brother Branham should I shouldn't even need the surgery right he's coming immediately I don't really need surgery right remember brother brought him down with people who'd quit their jobs and were waiting and and he said I gotta go correct my children misunderstood see and he said here was John's answer go on like you are continue on continue on it's true I Know Who I am I know he's here I know if I'm here he's here I don't know is yet but trust me he's in your midst has not been properly identified yet but if I'm here he's here because I know who I am yeah I am the voice of one crying the rulers I have a revelation God gave me a revelation I am Isaiah's words I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness and when I look back at what Isaiah said there's no way that I could be here except easier but we're just waiting for him to be clearly identified what and so they asked him what should we do this carry on continue on go ahead if you're raising potatoes raise them you soldiers don't do no violence and you do this and whatever be you just continue on as you are obey your masters and so forth rabbi what should we do just continue you want as you are but there's one in your midst that you don't know he know that the hour of his message he knowed he was to introduce that person he know he was there one in your midst you don't seem things are going on watch things are going on you don't know nothing about and then there's something going to happen he says you see and he'll be here and I'll know him and finally brother Bratton says finally one day behold there he is there is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world said and my time is up now I've introduced you to him I must decrease now I must go off the scene he'll take over from here now watch oh my simplicity be humble when God promises something big it is big in his sight see they just asked him well the bride have a ministry oh yes sure it's going in right now don't you understand be humble it's in simplicity you're looking for God to go do something great they were doing that in John's day they thought mountains were gonna go down in valleys and ditches we're gonna come and yet he the prophet was there and Christ was moving in the midst of them already the word they were already walking in the vision of the word they thought they'd missed had lives don't imagine that you must have a life don't imagine that you're just living a life you're on a journey to a fulfillment you're on a journey will the bride have a ministry of course she'll have a ministry it's going on right now I'm not looking for something good something Oh when this happens that happens this happens there's gonna be a great revival those gonna be a great suite I'm here to take something friends it's sweeping right now the great revivals on right now the Word of God if this if this message is that reviving you there's not nothing else coming to revive you the next event is Moses and Elijah to Israel and that's not even our message we're taking out of here buddy so wake up and understand your life is in the book now your life is happening the word is happening in your life in real time right now if there was ever a time to be humble to see God in simplicity to humble yourself know the humble that we mean to speak in low tones and to the dress in poor clothes and to drive an old cart no I have not knew how that's works of man that nauseates God humility the real works of God is to believe him whom God hath sent and allow that God to operate in your everyday normal going to work going to school going to the market every day walking talking life I'm here to tell you something friends those believers standing there shouldn't we quit this no carry on should we do this just what should we do what should we do we believe he's here we believe there's a rapture what should we do should we quit this quit that no just carry on just be humble remember to be so humble the Lord will come sweeping in that night he said that rap shall be so sweet he said he'll just come in and he'll just collect you like a thief carry you off and the world whose be right on [Music] calamities will set in once this bride is gone I'm gonna take some friends what's happening now isn't even in comparison oh if they think they're afraid of this what happens when it's when it's when it's disease after disease after disease plague after plague after plague like that one brother I read you that statement he said he said welcome to the dress rehearsal I'm glad that I've got a I've got another place I'm glad I don't have to worry but I don't have to put myself there all I gotta do is slip into the stream let the current just carry me home to glory oh my life is not about supersonics brother branham said don't chase supers don't don't do that and we're not chasing supers that's not what gets never what it's been about men have rose up taking people off wrecked lives wrecked churches young people regret before they can even get started in life I've seen it happen this camp that can this super preacher this super doctor this super anointing oh my but the bride just keeps watching right down the center the balance of God's words we're believers and we know what he's come to do and I know I'm a part I'd like to make it happen all I gotta do is just set my wings and let the current begin to carry me huh hello your friends that's what I want to do tonight set my wings in the current others of the mystery of God's movements all the world knows nothing about it but God is on the move think about where we are this is because if you look at if you look at it and see friends brother man and said see when you do that he just go right on take potatoes go to church they said will the dispensation of grace be over they're asking brother Branham and willing will the dispensation of grace be over after you open the Seventh Seal no I hope not no no friends don't get that in your mind see you just go right on potatoes go to church and ran on if it takes place in the morning you'll be found doing exactly what you were supposed to be done see when you see when you do that you twist the very thing away from the purpose its intended for you you get little peculiar thoughts and you get your own ideas about a thing and don't take your own idea just when you sit and listen to things like that say like thank you lord I'm just going to walk a little closer to you I don't have to figure it all out I just need to walk a little closer to him yeah I don't have all the answers people run themselves crazy trying to identify everything happening somehow fitting it into prophecy oh is this the tribulation is this what the Bible spoke of is this I'm here to take some friends I guarantee you this ain't no tribulation plate because I'm still here and I ain't a part of the tribulation I'm part of the first resurrection oh I'm here to take something friends you don't have to be afraid nor to run to and fro you don't need to worry about knowledge increase that's just destroying man all you need to do is move a little closer and the closer you get to God the more and then the slipstream over the vision that you will find yourself moving in seeing you you go right on do it do exactly what you're supposed to be doing see always in this wonderful don't look don't look up for some great big something just remember I'm closing now just remember the simple thing of believing what he promised we do not look for something big but in Jesus name we receive his promise that settles it that makes it over I thought to myself you know here was a prophet in our day all right let me just close my Bible and just finished with a few comments brother all right you get ready to just take back over here in just a moment let me just make these closing comments why don't you stand back with me so I'll know to stop Amen you know here here we find a profit come on the scene now watch this a moment it's just amazing as I thought about it in my mind I would have drew it out for you if we were gonna do a display but we elected not to do it to put it on the display but you've got brother branham and here he is identifying John and he's saying you know John identified but John even when he identified he also prophesied there's one among you he's coming and then when he came on the scene he said now I've got to go off the scene that's exactly what the set that the Elijah of our day did he began to identify he began to show it in the word it has to come and then when the when the seals are open and the Mighty One comes and an angel descends to give an open book then that prophet has one mission to feed that to the bride because now he's going to go off the scene because the bride isn't eating on theory she's not eating on the body of a man she's eating on the body word on the son of man you understand the gospel the met the seals weren't open to turn you into a hymn Branham the seals were open to turn you into Jesus trace hallelujah wasn't here to make William branham's out of a sin that was God's humble messenger and it was delivered and he went to his reward and he finished his course hallelujah now it's the time for the bride to move on and so now comes the question within what should we do to quit this know just keep right on going should I stop this or do that or run here or quit this no just live your life God is moving there's things going on you don't know about I promise you God is doing more in you than you are aware of Peleliu yeah God is a don't feel I don't feel like a Christian I can't overcome how this my god is going more in you than you would believe I'm here to tell you that you're standing here today as a believer when it's possible when when the world is going crazy and yet you're still a believer you're still holding to God's unchanging it you are a divine miracle walking the world hallelujah don't let the devil tell you otherwise here's a prophet standing that watch this beautiful he's using the same language having the same parallel in his ministry now you look at the Old Testament and you see thousands of years and hundreds of lives that are recorded in the Bible many many many lives recorded prophets priests Kings soldiers women old men young men children and all of their lives are a little puzzle a little piece in the puzzle that when all the pieces were put together over 4,000 years and it stood on the earth it was a man the puzzle was complete they all represented a piece in Christ when he came he was the fulfillment of all those types and shadows everything that they lived there now he comes to his prophet John now what's John John is going to come with his message to announce that someone is here prophet did that in our day John is announcing he's among you what do we do go on about your lives be humble is exactly what I probably did yeah John says okay there he is here's a prophet said he's here John says I must decrease this prophet says I must decrease he must increase he must increase and then John goes and Jesus starts his ministry and now that Ministry of Jesus is working in this ministry of a prophet you understand that when they stood in the water you had two men standing side-by-side a prophet and Christ - minun and the pillar of fire came down to identify what was happening in the word in the day an hour that you live in those both of those ministries were embodied in a single man and a single person of profit on this day of a forthcoming of Elijah where not only is he the forerunner but he's also the vessel the mighty angel begins to speak through because Jesus isn't coming in his corporal body you are his corporal body you are the body of the Lord and now Jesus lives of ministering goes three and a half years of ministry and that's exactly what this prophet and Christ operated and brother Brennan would say he's here and he's here and there'd be that pillar far same one John saw and then Jesus would go off the scene and the Holy Ghost would come into the church and bring the Jubilee along the way to Jubilee that had been prophesied in the Old Testament to come that I won't miss be above them or with them I'll be in am i well I'll take away their take their heart of stone up but give them a heart of flesh I'll live inside my family now watch and that's exactly what this opening of the seals brought back to us that original Jubilee that original abstract that original token and then you go into Paul and Paul goes many decades preaching and establishing and here is a prophet and his entire ministry was everything potahto Paul goes off the scene watch and then John is still there and John ends up on an island Padma's years after Paul's go on catches the revelation brings it back gives it to the church and here a prophet in this day do you realize that a prophet in that God seen in this day what took from the life of John and all of his ministry and the life of Jesus and his Street and the upper room and the life of Paul and the life while the Apostles and John on the island and all these decades and decades and decades it was all bottled up in a single ministry o friends what are you eating on today the body word of the Son of Man God has taken the whole thing that spanned decades and brought it down into a message that we are feeling you're literally feeding on the entire New Testament gospel hallelujah and it was in the New Testament as we promised I you shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and here we are and here we have it and the world misunderstands it yeah I just say today blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear I tell you many wanted to see it many wanted to hear it never saw it never heard it many didn't live long enough but God came in such a way and condensed from from from the very first opening of the New Testament in the book of Matthew all the way to the last words in the last part of the book of Revelation and everything that happened in between has to manifested itself and I repeated fullness in this hour that we have been allied we ought to just rejoice o raise up those hands and say Lord God I see it I see it in your homes today stand up and raise up those hands and say Lord I see it thank you for this work thank you for this message I'm a believer I don't understand I can't make it happen I don't know what all this means but I know you're working hard I know you're in my life and I want to know you more I want to draw closer that's the that's my message to you tonight friends the simplicity of drawing closer this is the approaching time of the resurrection you're now the culmination you're you're not only at the culmination you are the culmination of the entire New Testament as it relates to God's Gentile bride and here we are and there's not another age and there's not another messenger we're the final voice to the final age a man god bless you let's bow our heads I would turn it back to brother ALRI at the conclusion of this prayer amen let's pray Lord Jesus tonight we thank you Lord for this approaching hour that we find ourselves in I'm so glad to be here Lord I yeah this world is troubled and filled with sorrow misery and woe but Lord you know in through it all I I hold my head up I look up Lord I know that you you prophesied of terrible things that would come upon the earth and it's somewhat of a paradox Lord we're not at all happy we're not happy people are dying we're not happy over that we're not happy people are suffering I'm not happy Lord even some of your own family have been carried home in this in this pandemic it's not about that Lord we're not rejoicing over homes broken and children who don't have a parent anymore this over 19 took them Lord we're not happy rejoicing in that but at the same time Lord Jesus said when you see all of these things begin to happen lift up your head it's a paradox Lord we're not happy over the suffering but I lifting up my head I'm not burying my head in the sand I'm not running in fear I'm lifting I'm lifting up my head I'm looking toward the eastern sky I know my redemption is at hand Lord we see the world shaking I pray tonight Lord that the words of this message the real crux of this message what was that Lord my whole my whole my whole motive tonight was to get the people to come down and look within their own self deep introspection to realize Lord to try to show them the day an hour that we're living in and we arrived here by some cosmic accident this whole thing is Purpose Driven and my whole life is Purpose Driven my whole reason for being here Lord I can never find it I can never succeed and I can never get to that place if I'm if I'm connected all over a layer to see and I'm connected to the world I'm connected to the rat-race and I'm connected to entertainment and I'm connected all these things Lord let me unplug let me step away let me plug into you let my life enter into a greater a greater depth Lord that I may know you for that's the imperative reality that we must live in right now we must be very very close to you more I pray that hearts tonight father have recognized this we commit it to you now in Jesus Christ wonderful name amen without a god bless you my brother saints of God we'll be back with you again tomorrow now if the rapture comes we won't have the broadcast but I'll see you in the morning a man will see you at that meeting in the air but barring that we plan

opened up to us and we have a the benefit of perspective regardez has revealed his word completely but I so love how he should just walk forward in this relationship with Christ how we should just love forward and how our relationship should draw us closer to him I mean how his relationship reveals to us what we need to know how his relationship is what changes our lives his relationship is what gives us overcoming tower aiming brothers and sisters we've tried over the years to make yourself something to try and overcome from your own strength or from our own efforts and things and brother Jason I think he used the term ease we we've we've done unjustice to this message we represented it wrong for so many years but by God's grace I mean he is he's changing us we don't have to worry whether we gonna know what what he wants done with his word because his word is in us his Eternal Word was always predestinated there was always a CD and by His grace as his Holy Ghost feeds it
