[0:39] Hey babe where are the kids at? Come on kids. Time for bed.
[0:46] Did you brush your teeth? Yes Mom.
[0:48] Let me smell your breaths. Good boys.
[0:55] Remember what Mommy always says: If you tell the truth right the first time,
[0:59] you can say it again and again and again. Okay? Yes Mom.
[1:04] What story would you like to hear tonight. The story of the bull.
[1:07] Yes, the Story of the bull. Okay, let me find it here.
[1:15] I seen a vicious bull one day, was going to kill me. This is on record; I was a game warden at the
[1:20] time. I was going over the hill to pray for a sick man. And we're supposed to pack a gun,
[1:26] but you wouldn't go to pray for a sick man with a gun on your hand. So I took the gun and
[1:32] laid it in the little old truck, and crossed over through the field. And I was way out in
[1:37] the field and I knew... I had a--ought to of thought that this killer bull was out there,
[1:43] he'd just killed a colored man on a farm, Mr. Burks, just about three months before that ...
[1:50] Mom, speak to Jessie. Jessie! No laptop for a whole week.
[1:58] Boys, remember what brother Branham always said: Eternal Life is living for others.
[2:04] You must always live your life in such a way, that other people are blessed by
[2:07] it… even if that costs you some sacrifice. As you grow up, mommy wants you to always
[2:13] remember that. Yes, Mom.
[2:15] Okay time for bed. Let's pray.
[2:28] Dear Lord Jesus, we might not have much money, but we are so glad that we have You.
[2:35] Where would we be without You in our lives. Please bless Darius and Jesse.
[2:40] Please reveal Yourself to them in Your time. Please reveal yourself to them personally.
[2:46] Please express your Love to them. Let them grow up to serve You with
[2:50] their whole hearts. Amen.
[2:53] Amen. Good night, boys.
[2:59] Hop into bed. Hop into bed.
[3:24] Off to bed. Good night.
[3:24] The boys have grown up and Darius is now married. He has started an IT business that is
[3:30] rapidly expanding. He is putting heart
[3:33] and soul into the business and is working every waking hour to make a success of it.
[3:47] I really enjoyed the sermon last night. Hmmm
[3:53] God has been so gracious to us. Hmmm
[3:57] You are not really listening to what I’m saying to you, are you?
[4:00] Hmmm So, can I buy myself a new Maserati
[4:08] Hmmm… What??? Say that again.
[4:13] I’m trying to talk to you, but you are too busy with your work again.
[4:19] You know I must get the planning done before tomorrow.
[4:22] I am busy with that big project for the government,
[4:25] and my guys need to know what they are doing. I understand but why don’t you come sit with
[4:30] me for a bit? [bell rings]
[4:39] Who's that? Are you going to open the door, or must I?
[4:42] Let me get it. Hello! I wasn’t expecting you.
[4:59] Hello Darius. Come in. Have a seat.
[5:17] It's so nice to see you all. Would you like something to drink?
[5:22] Funny you should say that?
[5:27] Yes, please.
[5:30] This is a nice couch you got he re, man.
[5:33] Yes, Just the best
[5:37] How's Jesse doing, mom? He's good, thank you Bonnie.
[5:41] Is he still working on the farm? Yea, he's still shearing the sheep and milking the cows.
[5:47] He's never going to make it in life.
[5:58] Anyways, how is my RICH young son doing? Dad!
[6:02] Come on mate. Business must be all good. How's it going?
[6:07] Everything is going well, dad.
[6:12] I’ve just been awarded a real big project. Probably my first real breakthrough
[6:18] and there's a few tenders in the pipeline.
[6:21] Man, I’ve got some good guys working for me. I can't do it without them.
[6:26] And what about the Lord, Darius? He is the One that has blessed you with all these talents and
[6:31] you couldn’t do it without HIM.
[6:33] Yes, mom. Of course!
[6:35] You know I love the Message. That goes without saying.
[6:40] It should go WITH saying, son. Yes. Of, course.
[6:45] Seriously, son…
[6:47] You've always been an example to others
[6:49] and all the young people, they look up to you.
[6:50] You're such an example
[6:53] So, let the Book live in you, Darius.
[6:57] What your mother says is right. You always need to put God first.
[7:03] Remember who you are and remember what your purpose is on earth.
[7:07] [Mobile phone ringing]
[7:12] He's going to be on the phone for a long time.
[7:16] I guess that's our queue to go.
[7:21] I still need to do the muso roster anyway, so...
[7:29] Thank you for coming. Can I get a hand?
[7:37] Thank you. Thank you for that coffee.
[7:57] Do you have to work again?
[8:00] Come sit with me please. Just five minutes.
[8:05] Okay my darling. I'll come now. Just give me a moment.
[8:07] Would it be okay if I just do my daily tweet.
[8:10] Yea, sure.
[8:15] Where is that quote that I saw earlier? Oh, yes… here it is:
[8:22] Copy… Paste…
[8:26] Hey Bonnie, listen to this quote that I have just tweeted:
[8:29] He walked to the mountain, and the mountain opened up, and he went in. The shelves was full of gold
[8:37] and diamonds, as the little fairy story goes. He laid the flower down on a rock. And he run and
[8:43] grabbed a great big gem, and he said, “I must go show this to my friends. And now I’m a rich man.
[8:51] I have everything now. I must show this.” And so the flower spoke, “But,” said,
[8:56] “you have forgot the main thing.” So he runs back and picks up,
[9:01] said, “Well, maybe I’ll—I’ll get a piece of gold.
[9:04] I’ll get a piece of silver.” And so he said, “I’ll—I’ll hurry out, to tell the
[9:08] people how rich I am, and what all I’ve got.” 100 And he got to the door, and the flower said,
[9:14] “But you forgot the main thing.” So he runs back again. He said,
[9:19] “In here we find all kinds of materials.” So, he picked up a stone. He said, “I’ll go,
[9:25] take this stone and show the people what kind of a stone this mountain is made out of,
[9:29] so I can find my way back to it.” See? And he started out the door,
[9:34] and the flower said, for its final time, “You have forgot the main thing.”
[9:40] “Oh,” he said, “oh, shut up.” See, he didn’t want to hear it anymore,
[9:44] “Forgot the main thing,” and he ran out the door. And when he did, the door closed behind him,
[9:50] with the flower on the inside. The main thing was the flower. See? The main thing was the flower.
[9:57] “Always remember the main thing”
[10:02] That’s very striking, Darius, but
[10:04] are we doing that? Of course we are, honey.
[10:07] We’re in the Message? We go to church.
[10:08] don’t we? Most weeks… unless I’m too tired… We seem to be too tired very often lately.
[10:09] Don’t interrupt me, Bonnie! I’m trying to make a point!
[10:09] … Where was I.
[10:09] … Oh, yes… we go to
[10:09] church at least every other week, then. We probably go more than Simon.
[10:33] And we pay 10% of our income as tithes. Do you know how much my tithes is?
[10:47] Imagine if we had all that extra money for ourselves?
[10:50] And we love the Lord, don’t you agree? Sometimes I wonder if there’s not more.
[11:03] Sometimes in my heart, I feel like there’s a thirst for more of God.
[11:09] To be honest… sometimes I have the same thing. I’m just so busy that I never get time to really
[11:17] stop and think about it. …
[11:20] I tell you what I will do. I will phone the pastor and talk to him about it.
[11:45] Hello brother David… It’s Darius here. …
[11:51] Yes, nice to speak to you too. …
[11:56] I’m sorry, I’ve just been SO busy. …
[12:02] Yes, I know, brother David. Yes… priorities. Well, that’s actually why I phoned you:
[12:07] I wonder if I could come see you. I would like to discuss heart matters with you.
[12:19] … No, nothing wrong with my …
[12:23] … No, they are fine…
[12:27] … Business is fine.
[12:28] … No… no not at all. I just want to FEEL more. I …
[12:39] … Yes!
[12:42] Yes, like that! …
[12:46] Thursday is difficult. Actually, what about Saturday?
[12:51] … Oh, preparing for Sunday… of course… I understand.
[12:56] … An exception for me… no it shouldn’t take long…
[13:05] … Okay. 5pm on Saturday.
[13:09] I appreciate that very much. …
[13:13] God bless Yes, see you then.
[13:16] Yes, I will pass your regards to her. It is now Saturday afternoon and time for
[13:38] Darius’s visit to the pastor. Take a seat, Darius.
[13:50] Can I offer you some water. No thanks, I’ve just had something to drink.
[14:12] Shall I just ask the Lord’s blessing on our meeting.
[14:16] Lord Jesus, we ask your guidance, etc… …
[14:31] Okay Darius, I will let you talk. What can I help you with?
[14:40] Well, brother David, as I said on the phone… Life is good… business is good …
[14:53] I have no complaints from a natural perspective … I enjoy what I’m doing … and the Lord
[14:56] has blessed me with a wonderful wife… … and honestly, I have nothing to complain about.
[15:10] But in my heart, something seems to be amiss. Sometimes it feels like I am dead on the inside…
[15:18] and when I listen to the Message … I don’t have that excitement that I used to have.
[15:26] Do you have any unrepented sin in your life?
[15:29] You know, how the prophet says that if we have unrepented sin, the devil has a right to be there.
[15:38] I’ve wondered about that… and I can honestly say that I am living
[15:44] according to the standards of the Message. My parents taught me all the things that
[15:50] God requires of me … and since my youth I have tried to abide by those things.
[15:53] I’ve been coming to church all my life… I got baptised as a teenager … and I have never
[16:00] doubted that this Message is the truth. I dress right… I try to act right…
[16:14] I want to go to Heaven. I don’t want to be left behind. I’ve come too far to miss it now.
[16:21] I want to spend eternity with my family … and with Bonnie … and with you, of course.
[16:28] But I’m not sure what more I can do to inherit eternal life.
[16:39] The Holy Spirit seems to impress on me that there is one thing lacking, Darius.
[16:43] Remember how the Bible says that we cannot serve God and Mammon?
[16:50] Also: do you remember the 3 traps that Brother Branham warned us about?
[16:56] Women… popularity … and ??? Money …
[17:00] But wasn’t that just for the ministry? It WAS for the ministry too… but
[17:04] it is Satan’s three-pronged attack that he will try on every son of God.
[17:11] Those are areas in our make-up that we should always keep covered.
[17:16] What are you saying, brother David? What does that have to do with me?
[17:20] You are gifted with technology and business, Darius.
[17:25] And your gifts are making you popular… even in the eyes of the world…
[17:30] But have you surrendered your gifts completely to God?
[17:33] Have you really put God first in everything? And you ARE making a lot of money.
[17:47] But there’s nothing wrong with having money! I’ve worked hard for everything I have.
[17:57] I never want to be poor again. Do you have any idea how hard it is when everyone
[18:03] around you can afford things and you can’t. I believe God has blessed me
[18:10] with everything I have achieved. Many people say that MONEY is the root of
[18:13] all evil… but that is not what the Bible says. The Bibles says the LOVE of money is
[18:19] the root of all evil. You know your quotes,
[18:22] Darius… but is Jesus Christ number 1 in your life? That is interesting: I just tweeted that quote
[18:33] about the man who found that flower who gave him access to the mountain full of riches…
[18:41] Yes, I saw your tweet. … so have you forgotten the main thing?
[18:46] I go to church. I pay my tithes.
[18:51] I live the life of a Message believer. I read my Bible. I pray often… and God blesses me.
[18:59] I can give testimony after testimony of how He miraculously helped me to
[19:06] complete difficult projects. How can you insinuate I have
[19:12] forgotten the main thing? I am not accusing you,
[19:15] Darius… I’m asking YOU the question.
[19:18] The Bible says we must judge ourselves so that we won’t be judged at the white throne.
[19:23] … So, when you look in
[19:26] the mirror of the Word, where do you stand? So, are you saying I have a love of money?
[19:35] What does your heart tell you? So, what should I do, then?
[19:50] You know there was a young fellow in the Bible that asked Jesus the same question.
[19:55] The rich young ruler? Uh-huh…
[19:59] Can you remember what Jesus told him? Do you really expect me to sell everything
[20:05] I have and give it all away? Times have changed…
[20:09] I don’t believe it would be God’s will to dump Bonnie and the children into financial ruin.
[20:14] I don’t want to put my children through the same poverty that I had as a child.
[20:26] I believe what God is telling you … … is that you should love HIM more than money.
[20:35] But I believe I DO love Him more. I can’t be the judge of that, Darius… that is
[20:40] between you and God… but your strong protest tells me that you are not too sure of that yourself.
[20:44] … What would the evidence
[20:47] be that you love God more than anything? I don’t know? … that I come to
[20:52] church when other people don’t … … that I dress and act like a Message believer
[21:00] when many of my friends have walked away… … that I give donations to the mission
[21:05] fund when hardly anyone in church does? No, Darius. Those things should happen
[21:10] automatically when you LOVE God right. …
[21:13] When you LOVE Him right… you put Him above everything and everyone else.
[21:26] … Do you know
[21:26] what brother Branham says eternal life is? Yes… my mother always quoted that to me.
[21:33] I want you to say it, Darius. Do I have to?
[21:37] It would do you good to hear it again: Eternal life is ….
[21:42] Living for others. Perhaps God doesn’t expect you to
[21:49] give everything away like the rich young ruler … … but perhaps that voice that you hear in your
[21:55] heart is telling you that your love of money is more than your love for God or His people.
[22:02] I just can’t see that to be the case. Perhaps God wants to say to you that
[22:07] you should give other people the benefit of the gifts that God have placed in you,
[22:10] rather than just keeping it all to yourself. Can I read you a quote?
[22:17] Sure. The prophet says in a sermon “Law Or Grace”:
[22:34] Women put perfume on themselves for a pleasant. And men puts after-shave stuff on, sometimes,
[22:40] like that; that odors, foul odors, would be taken away from you. When you walk into the presence of
[22:46] someone, with body odors or with something another, perfumes is to take that odor away;
[22:52] so that you, in the presence of the person, that you might not be foul. It’s unbearable.
[22:57] 113 … Jesus said…See, He was the Rose of Sharon, and He was offered to God as a sweet-smelling
[23:03] Savour. …And then when we become unbearable before God, and … so stinky, … that our sins and things
[23:09] are so bad and so foul, then we come to Calvary … 114 … You take a flower, it’s beautiful; a big
[23:15] morning lily, or a rose. The Rose of Sharon is a beautiful flower. While it’s a living,
[23:21] it’s beautiful. But to get odor out of that, to get a perfume, it has to be crushed. And
[23:26] they crush it and squeeze the perfume out of it. 115 You see, Christ, when He was here on earth,
[23:31] He was beautiful. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. His life
[23:36] was never compared. He was beautiful. … 116 And to make us well pleased to God,
[23:40] He had to become crushed on Calvary, and the sin of this world had to squeeze out the life,
[23:46] out of Him. And He died, bearing the sins of the world, that we might be
[23:50] anointed with the Rose of Sharon. He was the Lily of the Valley. “He was wounded for
[23:55] our transgressions,” a sweet-smelling Savour. “By His stripes you were healed,” the Lily of
[24:01] the Valley that give us the opium, to ease our sicknesses and pain. What a marvelous picture!
[24:09] Now, Darius, that lily or that rose gives his perfume for others to enjoy. The gifts in our
[24:17] lives are for others, not for ourselves. That is the example that Jesus lived before
[24:24] us… He was crushed for our sakes. His Life was poured out to make a
[24:29] way for us to smell beautiful before God. … and as you know: He was our wave sheaf.
[24:39] Like that lily or that rose, Jesus gave EVERYTHING He
[24:44] was … so that WE could benefit from HIS Life… and He WAS eternal Life. In fact, He IS eternal Life
[25:00] He never kept His holiness for Himself… He lived a life for others.
[25:08] That is hard! I don’t know if I can do it. I’m just at the point where things are starting
[25:20] to look up in my business… Why do others have to
[25:25] benefit from all MY hard work. I will be praying for you, Darius.
[25:46] A few years have gone by, and Darius’s business is booming. Darius and his family are living
[25:53] the high life. He has opened offices all over the world and is often away on business trips.
[25:59] He has an active YouTube channel that specialises in motivational videos that
[26:04] encourage others to chase their dreams. He has over a million subscribers.
[26:26] Darius, your YouTube agent has called and asked you to phone him back.
[26:45] Apparently there is a company that would like you to do an endorsement on their clothing brand.
[26:51] Oh, wow! Another one! Hasn’t the Lord been blessing us?
[26:57] He sure has. But it reminds me… I still
[27:01] needed to record my weekly video. Does my hair look okay?
[27:10] Yes, your hair is fine… the bit that you have left, anyway.
[27:17] What was that? Oh, nothing… I’m just thinking out loud.
[27:44] Sorry! Hey what’s up my beautiful successful people!!

[28:20] Starting off, just a reminder, in case you missed it: I did a podcast with my man,
[28:27] Elon Musk. We dive into the recent crisis of StarLink’s network coverage loss that
[28:34] hit New Zealand hard last week. For that full story, remember you can access my podcast from
[28:40] the link in my bio. It is literally blowing up!! Skyrocketing into space with the views.
[28:49] Focusing on Todays episode, I’m finally sharing the exciting news I’ve been
[28:54] hinting at these past few weeks. My business partner, Bill Gates and I,
[28:59] are in the middle of launching the latest state of the art medical advancement.
[29:04] Picture this!!! Permanent face masks that double as virtual reality connectors.
[29:12] Imagine a mask that can make your everyday mundane tasks become a
[29:17] lot more fun through augmented reality. Imagine that instead of vacuuming your
[29:23] living room, you can be chasing raiders of the galaxy through a futuristic
[29:27] landscape… with your vacuum cleaner… … or instead of driving down state
[29:33] highway 3 … you are on a formula 1 racetrack… … or better yet: it can have a boss mode,
[29:40] where you can be a soccer superstar in the middle of a world-cup final,
[29:44] while it appears that you are sitting in front of your computer doing important work…
[29:49] You can have all these and many other features while at the same
[29:53] time being protected from the latest lurgies and pandemics.
[29:59] Stay tuned for the official launch date and pre-orders.
[30:04] Now, moving onto our question of the day segment,
[30:07] this one comes all the way from little old New Zealand. Joshua Sevenster asks,
[30:13] “hey boss man! huge fan of your videos! I’m trying to build an interface to steer my lawnmower with
[30:20] gamma rays. What’s the easiest way to get the pico state machine to interface to the bio1 headset?
[30:28] Wow! Thank you so much Joshua for that excellent idea and question!

[30:48] As always, I like to end with some words of wisdom,
[30:51] a challenge for you to live this out this week.
[30:55] Make sure you remember the main thing… … in other words: keep focusing
[31:00] on what is important… … whatever is important to you.
[31:04] The best way to ensure success in anything, is to put all your focus onto it.
[31:10] Until then! Stay happy and healthy! ✌🏼 God bless you👍🏼
[31:20] Hey, Laz. Yes, Bro.
[31:27] How many times to I have to tell you? At work, it is Boss or Darius… not Bro or Brother.
[31:32] Sorry, Boss. My Bad. When is that tech show
[31:36] that you were going to get tickets for? Oh, no! I knew there was something I was
[31:40] forgetting. I forgot to tell your P.A. but the show is on today.
[31:46] I obviously pay you too much. Can’t anyone do some proper work, around here?
[31:53] Why am I surrounded by people like this? What’s this, Laz?
[32:00] Don’t know, Boss. It’s an idiot sandwich.
[32:09] Boss, I actually wanted to speak to you about my pay.
[32:12] I can’t even feed my family on my current pay rate… not even to speak about
[32:19] maintaining the household. Laz, do you see this
[32:23] business that I have built up… … with God’s help, of course …
[32:27] But it was MY hard work and effort that has gone into making it what it is.
[32:32] This company didn’t come out of nothing. You want things just to be handed to you…
[32:35] … in your mind, you think like a beggar, Laz. No, mate. If you want more pay, I would need
[32:42] to see a lot more output from you. But boss, that’s not fair. I work
[32:49] hard every day… in fact, more hours than what I’m paid for… and I’m loyal to your company.
[33:02] I see you as a brother. That’s enough of that.
[33:13] I need to get to the conference. Look at all the people. I didn’t
[33:14] realise this show was so popular. I will look around and see if there are any
[33:22] well-known people that I can take my picture with. Oh, wow! Look who’s here!!!
[33:27] It’s Tech Tornado and Code Crusader! Girl, Look who’s here!
[33:35] Are you who I think you are? Are YOU who we think YOU are?
[33:38] I’m such a fan of your tech channel. As we are of yours!
[33:47] It is so exciting to meet you! Would you mind if I took a
[33:55] picture with you for my tech show tweet? Yes, of course. We’d be flattered.
[34:01] Can we take one with you for our Instagram page. Thank you. It was lovely to meet you.
[34:51] And you! Guess who I bumped into at the tech show today.
[35:13] Upload picture. And send.
[35:44] I guess I can head home now. I’ve seen enough. Good afternoon, RYR enterprises, focusing on
[35:47] things that matter – Can I help you? …
[35:54] Yes, it’s me speaking. …
[35:59] Oh, sister Laz… are you okay? You sound terrible!
[36:05] What??? When did this happen?
[36:17] And there was nothing they could do for him? … on the way to the morgue already …
[36:31] I am so sorry for your huge loss. We’ll be praying for you.
[36:41] Let me know if there is anything you need that we can do for you.
[36:52] Okay… God bless you.
[37:02] Bye Who was that?
[37:04] You look shocked! Are you okay?
[37:09] That was Sister Lazarus on the phone. Yes?
[37:12] Laz was on the way to our Hangarau site and was involved in a head-on collision…
[37:13] He was declared dead on the spot. Wow, that’s shocking!
[38:12] Can you remember your last words to him? Yes, sister Felicity.
[38:14] I called him an idiot sandwich… … but I didn’t mean any harm …
[38:25] … I just … Somebody, call the ambulance!
[38:42] I think, Darius had a heart attack! Both Lazarus and Darius are dead.
[40:45] Darius finds himself in the regions of the lost. Just a note here: Although, we recognize that
[40:51] Lazarus and Darius are in two separate dimensions, we will let
[40:55] them interact just for purposes of demonstration. I am homesick and blue, and I want to see Jesus;
[41:14] I would like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime;
[41:23] It would brighten my path and would vanish all fears;
[41:33] Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. Hello, my precious brother.
[42:20] Your earthly toil is all over. Wow, this is indescribable… is this
[42:27] what perfect Love feels like? It is just sublime.
[42:33] Aren’t you Brother Branham? Yes, my brother.
[42:39] Welcome to the joys of the Lord. You had it hard on earth… but
[42:40] all that is now something of the past. You stood for Jesus on earth and now you
[42:47] have come to your reward. Mommy!!!
[42:56] … Daddy!!!
[43:00] … Somebody, help me. I’m in torment!
[43:00] … Brother Branham… can you hear me?
[43:08] Yes, Darius Brother Branham, is Lazarus there with you?
[43:16] Yes, he is here on this side. Please send him to me to bring
[43:21] me some cool water. I am tormented here. We can’t cross to your dimension, Darius…
[43:30] Besides, you treated him like dirt on earth while you lived in luxury…
[43:34] He is no longer your slave for you to trample on. You had a life of comfort on earth while Lazarus
[43:37] had to be content with the crumbs that you let him have…
[43:40] But he chose the hard way. Despite his difficult life, he served the Lord with all his heart.
[43:48] But I gave him a job. It was thanks to ME that he even HAD a job.
[43:56] I went to church. I was in the Message… YOUR Message!
[44:00] I paid tithes… a lot of tithes… I read my Bible… I did everything God told me to!
[44:10] Did you? I want to tell you a secret:
[44:14] Do you know why God blessed you in business? It was not because you were so special… it was
[44:20] because of the sacrifices your ancestors made for God… and God will sometimes bless many generations
[44:26] because of a sacrifice of a parent. Let me ask you again:
[44:32] When God spoke to you though your mother… and told you that eternal life was living for others …
[44:37] Did you follow that Word? But …
[44:42] That was God speaking through your mother. When God spoke to you through your parents,
[44:47] telling you to put God first … did you? I did! I testified for Him… I even
[44:54] spoke about God on my YouTube channel. Many people probably heard about God through that.
[45:03] Darius, if you are honest with yourself, you know the truth.
[45:08] God was speaking to you through your mother and father.
[45:11] And when your pastor reminded you of that quote, not to forget the main
[45:15] thing… that was God speaking to you. In fact, God was speaking to you week
[45:19] after week through the ministry. God was desiring you to follow Him
[45:28] with ALL your heart. But a lot of your
[45:31] religious actions… were driven by pride. You wanted the applause of man… just like
[45:37] the Pharisees did all those years ago. Your motive was not always pure, Darius.
[45:43] Lazarus made good choices in hard circumstances … … but you made selfish choices in much
[45:50] easier circumstances. I wish I heeded the
[45:55] Voice of God speaking through my loved ones. Can you send someone to my wife to warn her?
[46:09] Please tell Bonnie to treat our workers better. Please tell her to give more to the needy!
[46:21] Please tell her to really focus on the main thing! Can you send someone to church to warn them?
[46:35] Please send someone to the Rapturing Grace Tabernacle …
[46:40] … to warn them that it is more than just going to church…
[46:48] … it is more than just being in the Message… … it is more than just following the rules.
[46:59] I was following the rules, but my HEART was not sold out to the main thing.
[47:09] I wish I can go back and change that! God is warning them of exactly those things…
[47:19] week after week across the pulpit … … day after day through His
[47:23] Word and through loved ones. The Bible says that the way the
[47:26] tree leans, is the way it falls. Lazarus has now gone on to his reward… and you to yours.
[47:39] In the Message “Investments”, that the prophet preached in Chicago, on the morning
[47:44] of th 30th of August, 196, the prophet says: 78 Well, there was a law of God, that under the
[47:54] blood of a lamb, that didn't take away sin, it just scattered it. And when man sinned,
[48:00] he crossed the great chasm, when he sinned, away, he separated himself away from God,
[48:06] leaving hisself no way back. But God, in tender mercy, accepted a substitute for him,
[48:12] and this substitute lasted for thousands of years; but it wouldn't take away sin, it only covered up
[48:18] sin. But when, not manufactured... 79 But God, in His creative power,
[48:27] created a Blood cell, without sexual desire, in the womb of the virgin;
[48:33] that don't only cover sin, it omits sin. It--it takes it so far away till it's never
[48:40] in the mind of God again. It don't make a bridge across the chasm, but it moves the
[48:46] chasm. ... Drop this little drop of ink into that bottle of bleach, or whatever it might be,
[48:53] you will never find that color again. But friends, we don’t access that pardon
[49:02] by just talking about the Message… the Message must be our main thing. God wants us to serve
[49:08] Him with ALL our hearts and come to Him in a spirit of true repentance.
