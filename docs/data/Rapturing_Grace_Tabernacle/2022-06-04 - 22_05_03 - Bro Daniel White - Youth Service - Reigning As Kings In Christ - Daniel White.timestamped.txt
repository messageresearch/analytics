[34:34] afraid i'm not going to ask you to do
[34:37] anything
[34:38] that um
[34:39] that might might embarrass you or
[34:41] belittle you in in any way it's
[34:44] it's really just to to be able to bring
[34:47] a point across
[34:49] uh clearly and oftentimes we just allow
[34:52] the holy spirit to
[34:53] expand that thought as we go through it
[34:57] none of us here tonight uh
[34:59] are
[35:00] even the oldies up the back bless you
[35:03] we um
[35:04] we're we can all learn tonight
[35:07] with what the lord has has for us so
[35:10] let's just commit the service to the
[35:11] lord in prayer tonight
[35:13] a heavenly father lord it is such an
[35:16] honor and privilege
[35:18] lord to stand before lord your purchase
[35:21] possession lord as
[35:23] as young sheep lord
[35:27] pushing through a world heavenly father
[35:29] that is going in the opposite direction
[35:32] to the
[35:33] direction that you have for these young
[35:35] people lord god
[35:37] lord we can't help but live in this
[35:39] world and and feel the pressures that
[35:42] are against us
[35:44] purely lord because we're not going the
[35:47] direction that they are
[35:49] we're not going with the current lord
[35:51] god we we are going upstream
[35:54] and lord god we just want to thank you
[35:56] for your grace and your love to us
[35:59] tonight
[36:00] lord it was
[36:02] by your thought that you saw this
[36:03] meeting here tonight before the
[36:05] foundation of the world
[36:08] lord you knew who would be here
[36:10] you knew the purpose of this meeting
[36:13] and lord god if we could just submit us
[36:16] ourselves
[36:17] to you tonight lord god that would allow
[36:20] you heavenly father
[36:23] to make that thought that you had
[36:25] manifest here tonight
[36:27] lord god as much as we feel prepared and
[36:31] lord god we we allow
[36:33] a portion lord god for you just to
[36:37] to move us in the direction lord god if
[36:39] it if it means leaving everything lord
[36:42] god that we have prepared for tonight
[36:45] lord god then so be it
[36:47] heavenly father we just commit the
[36:49] service into your hands lord
[36:52] may you and only you heavenly father be
[36:54] the one that receives the glory and
[36:56] honor
[36:57] from everything that is accomplished
[36:59] tonight as your word goes forth
[37:02] in jesus christ's name
[37:04] amen
[37:05] amen amen let's open our bibles tonight
[37:09] to the book of ephesians
[37:14] i have a real habit of of um
[37:18] going too long
[37:20] and um
[37:22] i'll
[37:23] i always do
[37:25] do my best not to um to keep you
[37:28] unnecessarily
[37:29] but we just want to allow the lord to
[37:32] lead us
[37:34] as it pleaseth
[37:36] him to lead us
[37:39] so we just want to give him preeminence
[37:41] tonight
[37:43] the thought tonight is
[37:45] reigning
[37:46] as kings in christ
[37:50] okay reigning as kings
[37:53] in christ ephesians
[37:55] chapter one
[37:58] we're gonna start from verse three
[38:04] the blessed be the god and father of our
[38:07] lord jesus christ
[38:10] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[38:13] blessings
[38:15] in heavenly places
[38:17] in christ
[38:20] according as he hath chosen us
[38:24] in him before the foundation of the
[38:27] world
[38:29] that we should be holy and without blame
[38:32] before him in love
[38:36] having predestinated us unto the
[38:39] adoption of children
[38:42] by
[38:43] jesus christ
[38:45] to himself
[38:47] according to the good pleasure
[38:50] of
[38:51] his will
[38:53] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[38:56] wherein he hath made us
[38:59] accepted
[39:00] in
[39:01] the beloved
[39:03] you can take your seats just keep your
[39:05] bibles open i have a couple more
[39:08] scriptures here that
[39:10] we would like to look at tonight i've
[39:12] asked joseph here to do the impossible a
[39:15] little bit later but
[39:17] all things are possible to them that
[39:19] believe
[39:21] but um
[39:22] we we thank the lord
[39:24] here
[39:26] for this encouragement in the book of
[39:28] ephesians
[39:30] how
[39:32] he hath chosen us
[39:34] in him before the foundation of the
[39:36] world that we should be holy and without
[39:39] blame before him
[39:41] in love having predestinated us
[39:44] unto the adoption
[39:47] of
[39:48] children by jesus christ
[39:52] to himself
[39:54] if we turn to the book of romans
[39:57] also romans chapter 8
[40:03] so we're predestinated to a position
[40:08] amen by jesus christ amen we're
[40:11] predestinated to a position
[40:14] by him it's it's not a self-elected
[40:19] position it's not a self-chosen
[40:22] position it's not a self
[40:24] it's not self positioning self
[40:28] in a position
[40:29] but it's
[40:30] christ that does all these things
[40:34] for us
[40:35] amen by predestination he has already
[40:39] foreordained your position
[40:42] okay so that position is something that
[40:46] we discover
[40:48] in life
[40:50] as
[40:51] young believers
[40:54] in um
[40:55] romans chapter 4 verse sorry chapter 8
[40:59] verse 14
[41:01] it says for as many as are led by the
[41:04] spirit of god they are
[41:06] the sons of god
[41:09] so you cannot find this position
[41:13] self cannot find its position
[41:17] because sons and daughters of god are
[41:19] those that are led by the spirit of god
[41:23] amen so it's not possible for us to find
[41:27] our position we must be led there
[41:30] we must be led to that position you
[41:34] you'll you'll find in in life if we're
[41:37] self-led
[41:38] then we can talk ourselves out of that
[41:41] position
[41:42] because we we put our self there
[41:46] all right but if god puts us there
[41:49] then no one not even you can talk your
[41:53] way out of that position because what
[41:56] god does he does
[41:58] permanently
[42:00] for his sons
[42:01] and daughters
[42:03] so as many as are led by the spirit of
[42:05] god they are the sons of god and i i
[42:08] trust that
[42:09] you believe that you're led by the
[42:12] spirit of god tonight
[42:14] amen you might say well i i don't have
[42:17] the holy ghost tonight do you realize
[42:20] that the spirit of god will lead you to
[42:23] the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:26] so leadership by the spirit of god does
[42:29] not start
[42:31] when you receive the holy ghost
[42:34] but the spirit of the the spirit of
[42:36] leadership the holy ghost in your life
[42:39] begins before you actually receive the
[42:41] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:44] amen we could talk about these things a
[42:46] lot for a long time but
[42:49] we we want to keep moving and i want to
[42:51] keep this as as
[42:53] simple as i can so
[42:55] so even the adults can get it
[43:01] verse 15 says for ye have not received
[43:04] the spirit of bondage again
[43:08] to fear
[43:09] but ye have received the spirit of
[43:12] adoption
[43:13] whereby we cry abba father
[43:18] amen we could go to galatians 4 here you
[43:20] know we we don't become sons by
[43:23] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:26] the reason that you receive the baptism
[43:28] of the holy ghost is that because you
[43:31] are a son
[43:32] amen the sons and daughters of god are
[43:34] they that receive the baptism of the
[43:37] holy ghost
[43:39] amen so we do not re receive the spirit
[43:42] of bondage
[43:44] again
[43:45] to fear joseph that that song
[43:49] you know that song that you sung that
[43:51] god pressed on your heart it's it's it's
[43:54] beautiful it's it's wonderful
[43:56] because god has has god is not leading
[43:59] us by fear
[44:00] god is leading us by the spirit of
[44:03] adoption
[44:04] amen by love he's leading us by his
[44:08] eternal love for us
[44:10] so we can go to the book of revelation
[44:13] as well and i know this is a lot of
[44:16] scripture reading
[44:17] but um just just bear with me
[44:20] and
[44:23] just a couple more scriptures
[44:25] revelations chapter 1
[44:27] verse 5
[44:30] and 6
[44:34] and from jesus christ
[44:36] who is the faithful witness and the
[44:38] first begotten of the dead and the
[44:40] prince
[44:41] of the kings of the earth unto him that
[44:44] loved us
[44:45] and washed us
[44:48] from our sins in his own blood
[44:52] and hath made us kings
[44:55] and priests
[44:57] unto god
[44:59] and his father to him be glory and
[45:02] dominion forever
[45:04] and ever
[45:06] so we see here
[45:07] that there's a position mentioned here
[45:10] in verse 6
[45:12] that the faithful witness has made us
[45:15] kings
[45:17] and priests
[45:18] unto
[45:20] god
[45:20] amen he has made us
[45:23] kings
[45:24] and priests now the thought tonight is
[45:26] reigning as kings
[45:29] in christ
[45:32] okay
[45:34] because we want to be what he's made us
[45:38] amen we want to be what he's made us
[45:42] revelation chapter 5
[45:45] verses 9 and 10
[45:54] verse 9 of revelation
[45:56] 5 and they sang a new song saying thou
[45:59] art worthy to take the book and to open
[46:01] the seals thereof for thou hast thou was
[46:05] slain and has redeemed us to god by thy
[46:09] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[46:13] and people and nation and hath made us
[46:18] unto our god kings and priests and we
[46:24] shall reign
[46:25] on earth
[46:29] amen
[46:30] rain we shall reign
[46:33] on earth if god has
[46:36] made you a king then he will
[46:39] also make it possible for you to fulfill
[46:43] that role
[46:45] amen
[46:46] if god positions you
[46:49] then he will give you what is necessary
[46:53] so that you can fulfill the things that
[46:56] are required of you
[46:58] in that role
[47:01] is that right
[47:05] god has made us
[47:07] kings
[47:08] and priests
[47:11] if god has made us something then he
[47:14] will equip us
[47:17] with what is necessary
[47:20] so that
[47:21] we can be
[47:23] who god tells us
[47:25] that we are
[47:27] amen so we're not self-chosen
[47:31] we're not self-positioned
[47:34] we're not self-armed
[47:38] amen everything we're not self-elected
[47:42] all right we're not self-chosen
[47:46] but everything that we are is something
[47:49] that god does
[47:51] for us
[47:54] all right so that why so that we might
[47:57] reign
[47:58] on earth
[48:00] now when will we reign
[48:03] on earth
[48:04] do i use this brothers
[48:07] this one yeah
[48:09] wonderful
[48:10] brother branham reads revelation 1 6
[48:14] and he says
[48:15] he hath made us or there are certain
[48:18] truths
[48:19] we need to emphasize
[48:22] this is one of them
[48:24] he
[48:27] he
[48:28] hath made us
[48:32] salvation is his doing
[48:35] salvation is of the lord
[48:38] all of
[48:40] all of grace
[48:42] he
[48:43] redeemed us
[48:44] for our purpose
[48:48] amen and we
[48:50] i
[48:51] want to fulfill my purpose
[48:54] amen because it's not just about
[48:56] redemption but he redeemed us for a
[48:59] purpose
[49:00] amen he redeemed you for a purpose
[49:04] amen and that's the purpose is what we
[49:07] want to find out
[49:09] he bought us for a purpose
[49:12] we are kings
[49:14] spiritual kings
[49:16] oh we are
[49:18] oh we are going to be kings upon the
[49:21] earth with him when he sits on his
[49:24] throne but now
[49:29] we are spiritual kings
[49:33] and we reign over a spiritual
[49:36] kingdom
[49:38] okay this this might sound a little bit
[49:40] heavy but
[49:41] but just stay with me don't don't don't
[49:44] shut down on me because it it'll become
[49:46] very simple as we get into the the
[49:49] practical side of this
[49:51] okay but what i want you to notice there
[49:53] is the bit in yellow there but now
[49:57] but now we are spiritual king so he's
[50:01] not talking about when we return after
[50:03] the millennial reign but he's talking
[50:05] about now
[50:07] we will be kings there too but we are
[50:09] also kings
[50:10] now
[50:12] we are now we now
[50:15] now we are spiritual kings and we reign
[50:18] over a spiritual kingdom
[50:23] all right because what someone tell me
[50:25] what does a king have
[50:30] a kingdom
[50:32] a kingdom
[50:33] he reigns over a spiritual
[50:36] kingdom
[50:38] because a king ain't a king unless he's
[50:40] got a kingdom
[50:43] but because you're a king you have a
[50:44] kingdom
[50:47] because you're a king you have a kingdom
[50:49] okay
[50:50] it says in romans 5 17
[50:53] for if by one man's offense
[50:58] death reigned by one much more they
[51:01] which receive abundance of grace
[51:04] of the gift of righteousness shall reign
[51:07] in life
[51:09] by one jesus christ
[51:15] that's not all is it
[51:17] there we go
[51:18] and in colossians 1 3 who hath delivered
[51:22] us from the power of darkness and hath
[51:24] translated us into the kingdom
[51:28] reign of his dear son
[51:31] right now we reign with christ
[51:35] having dominion over sin the world the
[51:38] flesh and the devil
[51:40] showing forth his praises and glory
[51:44] showing forth himself
[51:46] for it is christ in us
[51:50] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[51:53] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[51:57] heavenly places
[51:59] in
[52:00] christ
[52:01] jesus
[52:03] amen
[52:04] so we we thank we thank the lord for
[52:07] this amen now joseph this is where we're
[52:09] going to put your talents to the test
[52:12] now i want to just kind of bring you
[52:14] into this
[52:16] service tonight and i want to ask you
[52:19] what are some of the qualities of a king
[52:24] can anyone
[52:26] you can shut that i'll finish with that
[52:27] if you want to shut that down
[52:29] but um
[52:31] what what would be a quality of a king
[52:34] i'll i'll give you one as an example
[52:37] integrity
[52:40] anyone else
[52:42] wisdom
[52:43] could could yep
[52:45] loyalty
[52:48] yeah anyone else
[52:51] humility
[52:57] leadership
[52:58] yeah sorry
[53:01] fairness
[53:03] how we going there joe
[53:07] we got wisdom we've got um
[53:09] integrity
[53:15] um what was some uh humility was said
[53:28] it's better you than me i i wouldn't i
[53:30] don't even know how to spell humility so
[53:32] you're doing well bro
[53:36] leadership
[53:41] anyone else
[53:43] grace
[53:47] patience
[53:50] love
[53:54] fairness
[53:55] sorry sister
[54:06] anyone else
[54:10] integrity yeah
[54:24] forgiving
[54:29] you doing good joe
[54:35] we're up to forgiving
[54:41] what about free
[54:43] yeah you'd have to be free right
[54:47] because we don't want to lead
[54:49] we can't lead properly when if we're
[54:52] bound
[54:54] we want to be to lead correctly
[54:57] he must be free
[55:00] you know if you had one leg tied up
[55:02] behind you
[55:04] it would be pretty hard to lead someone
[55:07] so you want to be free from bondage
[55:10] free from fear
[55:14] because we don't want to be led by
[55:17] fear
[55:18] amen sons and daughters of god are not
[55:20] led by fear but they're led by
[55:22] the spirit of
[55:24] adoption
[55:27] okay so we want to lead correctly
[55:31] why why would we want to lead correctly
[55:33] why would a king want to lead correctly
[55:38] sorry
[55:41] yeah
[55:42] yeah absolutely anyone else
[55:46] yeah because it affects
[55:49] the follower
[55:51] even if it's only one
[55:54] okay because if you're a king you're
[55:56] you're meant to you're meant to reign
[55:58] you're meant to rule you're meant to be
[56:00] a leader and your your whole
[56:03] your whole heart
[56:06] is not for you but it's for the people
[56:08] that are following you
[56:12] okay so
[56:13] you want to be free because if you're
[56:15] not free
[56:16] then how you lead is going to affect who
[56:20] is behind you
[56:23] is that right
[56:24] absolutely it it will and it does
[56:28] okay so we want to be free we
[56:31] we we want to be
[56:33] um
[56:35] courageous
[56:36] we want to be loving
[56:39] one thing david did and i for me
[56:42] personally it was part of the reason
[56:44] that god said david you're a man after
[56:46] my own heart
[56:47] can anyone does anyone want to
[56:50] think about david and perhaps something
[56:52] comes to your mind that something david
[56:54] was
[56:55] able to do
[56:58] repent
[57:00] be able to repent
[57:03] but before you can repent
[57:06] what must you do
[57:08] what must you be able to do
[57:12] admit you're wrong see that you're wrong
[57:16] amen see a leader must be able to see
[57:20] when he's wrong and not be so
[57:23] hot-headed that
[57:25] no one can
[57:26] point out when they're wrong
[57:30] all right why
[57:31] because
[57:32] if you've done wrong it's going to
[57:34] affect who's following you
[57:38] right
[57:39] because this that's what happened to
[57:41] david when david did wrong it affected
[57:44] what was who was following him because
[57:46] david was king
[57:48] you know repentance is one of those
[57:50] things that
[57:51] pride gets in the way of our of our
[57:54] ability to to repent
[57:57] um because as
[57:59] we we as
[58:01] people
[58:03] we don't like to
[58:05] admit that we're wrong but let me give
[58:08] you a hint when you get to my age you
[58:10] get used to it
[58:14] the more you can do it it's not that you
[58:16] go out to make wrong do wrong you don't
[58:19] wake up in the morning say praise the
[58:21] lord another day to do wrong
[58:25] you know
[58:26] we don't do it intentionally
[58:29] but what you're going to find is there
[58:30] is a blessing that comes
[58:33] with acknowledging your mistakes
[58:37] god blesses you
[58:40] when you can acknowledge your mistakes
[58:43] do you know why
[58:47] because you're deeming him
[58:49] right
[58:51] and you're humbling
[58:53] humility
[58:55] you're humbling yourself
[58:58] under the authority
[59:00] of the king
[59:02] because you are a king
[59:04] not the king
[59:06] oh when i was 18 i was the king
[59:10] i was the king
[59:12] there was no one above me but guess what
[59:15] there was no one below me because no one
[59:17] wanted to follow me
[59:19] no one wants to follow someone who
[59:21] thinks that there's something when
[59:22] everyone else can see through your
[59:24] facade and say you ain't what you're
[59:26] saying you are
[59:28] humble yourself and to say lord
[59:32] bring yourself subject to his word
[59:35] because that's when the prophet come to
[59:37] david david submitted himself to the
[59:40] word of the lord
[59:41] amen david submitted himself he humbled
[59:44] himself said lord forgive me for what i
[59:46] have done and david was totally blinded
[59:49] to the fact
[59:52] of what he was doing he was blind to it
[59:55] but when the word of the lord comes
[59:58] because why david
[1:00:01] wasn't self-chosen david wasn't
[1:00:03] self-elected david wasn't elected by a
[1:00:06] company of people god god had chosen
[1:00:09] david
[1:00:10] amen and because god chose david god was
[1:00:15] god god held himself responsible for
[1:00:18] david
[1:00:20] and god holds himself responsible for
[1:00:23] you because he has chosen you so when
[1:00:26] when you mess up
[1:00:30] and the word of the lord comes to you it
[1:00:31] can come from a pulpit it can come
[1:00:33] through a 10 year old it can come
[1:00:35] through a a 90 year old it can come how
[1:00:39] however it comes god's word can come to
[1:00:42] you in many different forms in many
[1:00:44] different ways you can be mowing the
[1:00:46] grass and god's work god will just
[1:00:49] quicken something to your heart and you
[1:00:51] can recognize your error through those
[1:00:53] different means you can recognize your
[1:00:55] error looking at nature
[1:01:00] if we want to be right
[1:01:03] god will god will make sure that you are
[1:01:06] but we can't be right
[1:01:08] in our through our own efforts
[1:01:12] we've got we're only way that we can be
[1:01:14] who we are called to be
[1:01:16] is if if the king comes down and
[1:01:19] corrects a king
[1:01:22] he brings correction so we've got to be
[1:01:24] able to be
[1:01:25] corrected we've got to be able to
[1:01:28] be able to repent we've got to be able
[1:01:31] to
[1:01:32] as as children you know as as children
[1:01:36] sometimes it's easy to repent to an
[1:01:38] invisible god but
[1:01:40] but
[1:01:41] your parents are a god with skin on them
[1:01:46] it's god with skin on and sometimes god
[1:01:49] requires you to go back to your parents
[1:01:53] say mom dad
[1:01:54] sorry for my attitude
[1:01:57] sorry for what i've done here sorry for
[1:02:00] for what i've i've done there because
[1:02:04] we'll get to that in a further down the
[1:02:06] track
[1:02:07] joe can we keep that slide and start
[1:02:09] another one
[1:02:11] so let's let's talk about now we've
[1:02:14] probably included one or two in this
[1:02:15] already but what what are the
[1:02:18] roles of a king
[1:02:22] what are some of the things a king does
[1:02:26] judge
[1:02:31] provider
[1:02:36] yeah
[1:02:38] we could probably yeah mediator
[1:02:41] don't overwork joseph
[1:02:51] anyone else
[1:02:57] yeah
[1:02:58] a warrior not as in
[1:03:01] warrior
[1:03:11] a friend
[1:03:12] yeah
[1:03:25] sorry
[1:03:27] no
[1:03:29] anyone else
[1:03:33] teacher
[1:03:38] sorry yeah peacemaker yeah
[1:03:41] absolutely
[1:03:46] protector
[1:03:55] i want to use this one word and it's
[1:03:57] probably
[1:03:58] i don't know if it is a word but
[1:04:01] influencer
[1:04:09] because all these
[1:04:11] everything that he does
[1:04:15] influences
[1:04:18] who's looking
[1:04:22] he may
[1:04:23] someone may be looking who's who's not
[1:04:25] even a part of his kingdom
[1:04:29] okay but everything he does
[1:04:33] influences someone
[1:04:37] so a king influences
[1:04:41] uh for the for the ladies here obviously
[1:04:44] we're not just talking about when we
[1:04:45] talk about
[1:04:46] kings we're not just talking about male
[1:04:49] kings
[1:04:51] the bible says he hath made us it
[1:04:53] doesn't say he has made the men kings
[1:04:55] it says he hath made us
[1:04:58] kings and priests
[1:05:00] and brother rahm says very clearly that
[1:05:02] this is the body of christ
[1:05:06] both men and women
[1:05:08] okay
[1:05:10] because young boys look at the older
[1:05:13] boys and
[1:05:14] and
[1:05:16] how they're ruling their kingdom
[1:05:18] and how they're ruling the kingdom
[1:05:20] influences those
[1:05:23] that those younger boys
[1:05:25] and the younger girls look at the older
[1:05:27] girls and the way that the the the older
[1:05:30] girls are
[1:05:31] are ruling
[1:05:33] their kingdom influences the younger
[1:05:36] girls
[1:05:37] that are that are looking on
[1:05:41] okay so again our responsibility is is
[1:05:44] not just to ourself and it's not just to
[1:05:47] god even though that is a part of our
[1:05:49] responsibility but our responsibility is
[1:05:52] also to the people that around us not
[1:05:55] even necessarily the people that are
[1:05:57] following you
[1:05:59] it goes further than that
[1:06:02] okay but it goes to
[1:06:04] down to a level of people are watching
[1:06:10] and people are being influenced
[1:06:14] okay and we want to be influenced by the
[1:06:17] right things
[1:06:21] and
[1:06:22] you as kings
[1:06:26] are looking at others
[1:06:28] for influence
[1:06:34] okay
[1:06:35] because after all you know
[1:06:39] we are we are sheep and we are easily
[1:06:42] influenced but we want to be influenced
[1:06:44] by the right thing if we're not being
[1:06:47] influenced by
[1:06:49] the right thing then these other things
[1:06:52] are really going to
[1:06:54] to not be
[1:06:56] be portrayed correctly expressed
[1:06:58] correctly so we we we want to be who god
[1:07:03] asks
[1:07:04] us
[1:07:05] to be
[1:07:07] this is probably i don't know how you
[1:07:09] put this into words
[1:07:11] but a king controls
[1:07:16] what comes into his kingdom
[1:07:20] and what goes out
[1:07:24] a king controls what comes
[1:07:27] through the gate
[1:07:29] thinking in old testament terms
[1:07:32] a king controls what comes through the
[1:07:35] gate
[1:07:36] and what goes out of the gate
[1:07:39] okay so he doesn't want anything to come
[1:07:42] into the gate
[1:07:44] in through the gate that is going to
[1:07:47] defile his kingdom
[1:07:51] huh this is why a shepherd stands at the
[1:07:54] door
[1:07:56] because the shepherd is the king of his
[1:07:59] kingdom
[1:08:00] under the king
[1:08:02] all right but the reason that he stands
[1:08:04] at the door is because he doesn't want
[1:08:06] to allow
[1:08:08] something
[1:08:09] to the best of his ability he stops
[1:08:12] everything that
[1:08:13] that could possibly defile
[1:08:16] his flock
[1:08:18] from entering in
[1:08:20] because i'll give you a little hint
[1:08:23] it's easier to keep the devil out
[1:08:27] than to have to throw him out
[1:08:31] okay
[1:08:33] so a king controls what comes in
[1:08:39] all right
[1:08:40] i don't have my phone
[1:08:43] but your phone
[1:08:45] is something that you need to control
[1:08:51] because
[1:08:52] the the that
[1:08:53] the the things of this world
[1:08:56] can enter into
[1:08:58] your kingdom through the phone
[1:09:02] is that right
[1:09:03] but a king
[1:09:06] has the ability to control what comes in
[1:09:11] this is why the lord said to abraham thy
[1:09:13] seed shall possess
[1:09:15] the gate of the enemy
[1:09:19] okay because if you can possess the gate
[1:09:23] then you can possess what comes in
[1:09:28] if something comes in wrong
[1:09:31] if something comes in that you're
[1:09:33] not aware of
[1:09:36] then you have the power
[1:09:39] to expel
[1:09:40] that thing
[1:09:42] whatever it is be let it be an attitude
[1:09:46] okay we all get them
[1:09:48] all right if if we take on an attitude
[1:09:51] that's wrong
[1:09:53] we have the ability as kings the power
[1:09:56] as kings to expel
[1:09:59] to cast out that attitude
[1:10:04] in my experience
[1:10:06] this the simplest way
[1:10:09] to get rid of an attitude
[1:10:11] is through repentance
[1:10:16] okay that's through my experience
[1:10:18] through my experience you you may not
[1:10:21] even know where it come from
[1:10:24] but if you go back to the one where the
[1:10:26] mom dad um
[1:10:29] husband
[1:10:31] wife
[1:10:32] if you go back to that one and say look
[1:10:34] down i'm i'm sorry
[1:10:35] for my attitude
[1:10:38] that thing will just lift
[1:10:41] it's it's supernatural it's not
[1:10:44] literally picking the thing up and
[1:10:46] throwing it out
[1:10:49] you know it's it can be the just by
[1:10:51] following god's order
[1:10:54] satan is expelled from our lives
[1:10:58] he's pushed out
[1:11:00] okay
[1:11:01] so
[1:11:03] we we are we have the ability to
[1:11:08] to control what comes in and what comes
[1:11:10] out if we if we
[1:11:13] if we fail to control what comes in
[1:11:16] then
[1:11:18] we are responsible ourselves
[1:11:23] the king can't play in the gov we can't
[1:11:25] blame the governor and the governor
[1:11:26] can't
[1:11:27] you know a lord is the wife you gave me
[1:11:30] you know and and then the wife said i
[1:11:32] it's the serpent's fault he beguiled me
[1:11:34] no
[1:11:35] you you caused the error
[1:11:40] okay so we've got to take
[1:11:42] responsibility
[1:11:46] because you can't have a kingdom without
[1:11:48] having responsibilities
[1:11:52] so we have to take responsibilities
[1:11:56] for our errors
[1:11:58] and that ain't always easy
[1:12:02] okay
[1:12:03] and i'm not saying that i'm not speaking
[1:12:05] to you
[1:12:06] in a way that
[1:12:08] about something that i have not
[1:12:10] experienced and had to do myself
[1:12:14] if you look at one another you're all in
[1:12:17] the same boat
[1:12:18] none of us are perfect
[1:12:21] none of us have uh are mistake free we
[1:12:24] will make mistakes
[1:12:27] okay but we need to make
[1:12:29] take i should say
[1:12:31] responsibility
[1:12:33] one thing this world hates
[1:12:36] is responsibility
[1:12:40] coverts everyone else's fault you know
[1:12:42] it's just everyone else's fault the the
[1:12:45] guy on the dole can't meet his his
[1:12:47] budget yeah people on the dole have a
[1:12:49] budget
[1:12:52] i don't understand that
[1:12:54] and then they get cranky when the doll
[1:12:57] don't meet their budget
[1:12:59] well they should be out working
[1:13:03] because there's work everywhere
[1:13:06] at least where i am
[1:13:08] i can't get enough people in the cafes
[1:13:10] if you have to work in a cafe don't work
[1:13:12] in a cafe you'll do whatever is
[1:13:14] necessary you'll take responsibility
[1:13:18] for things
[1:13:20] in life
[1:13:21] okay
[1:13:23] now
[1:13:25] i'm going to ask for
[1:13:27] four volunteers
[1:13:29] and what the time is how are we going
[1:13:32] not too bad it's pretty good
[1:13:34] can i can i have some a couple of
[1:13:37] volunteers it won't hurt
[1:13:42] i want two boys and two girls if it's
[1:13:44] possible sorry i should have said that
[1:13:46] before
[1:13:52] i thought you were going to be a
[1:13:53] volunteer then bro
[1:13:56] okay dad
[1:14:01] i won't give you the mum one i need two
[1:14:03] girls come on
[1:14:05] please
[1:14:06] please
[1:14:09] come on james
[1:14:11] there you go son
[1:14:19] am i good i'm the mom
[1:14:28] now
[1:14:31] kings of a kingdom
[1:14:36] what does it mean
[1:14:39] what what
[1:14:40] by then i'm a king i'm i'm in a position
[1:14:42] yes but what is your position
[1:14:45] because from this service i don't want
[1:14:47] you going home and saying brother dan
[1:14:49] said i'm a king dad so step aside
[1:14:52] i can make my own decisions i'm my own
[1:14:55] protector
[1:14:56] and then the daughter goes home and says
[1:14:58] dad mom
[1:15:00] the pastor dan said tonight that that
[1:15:02] that i'm a king step aside i can do all
[1:15:05] this by myself
[1:15:08] i'm i'm i'm a king
[1:15:11] i'll make my own decisions from here on
[1:15:13] in
[1:15:15] we are kings
[1:15:18] and we are to reign in the position that
[1:15:20] god has
[1:15:22] given us to reign in but our positions
[1:15:26] can change but at the moment you're in
[1:15:28] the position that you are here now
[1:15:33] okay
[1:15:34] so
[1:15:35] when we when we look at
[1:15:38] dad here
[1:15:43] and we look at the son and the mom and
[1:15:46] the daughter
[1:15:48] they are positions
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:55] that has a position
[1:15:58] that god wants him to
[1:16:00] be a king in
[1:16:08] when i saw this
[1:16:09] which
[1:16:11] wasn't that long ago
[1:16:13] it just helped me so much
[1:16:16] i just rejoiced
[1:16:18] okay
[1:16:20] so
[1:16:21] dad
[1:16:23] what's your name bro
[1:16:25] michael
[1:16:26] you're not dad yet
[1:16:28] no
[1:16:29] but he is tonight
[1:16:31] so as a to explain the situation
[1:16:35] dad this is the position
[1:16:38] that god wants
[1:16:40] michael
[1:16:42] to reign in as a king
[1:16:48] we go to the sun
[1:16:52] the sun here
[1:16:55] this is the position
[1:16:57] that god wants
[1:16:59] the sun to be a king in
[1:17:04] all right so it's not a when when the
[1:17:07] sun is
[1:17:08] when this when the sun
[1:17:10] the sun being a king doesn't do away
[1:17:12] with dad
[1:17:17] we are kings and priests
[1:17:20] but what that means is that's just
[1:17:22] that's a form that's a in
[1:17:24] if we bring that into our everyday life
[1:17:26] that's symbolic that's a position that's
[1:17:29] a thing that's a position that god wants
[1:17:31] you to reign in but the position is son
[1:17:35] and then we've got mom
[1:17:36] same and the daughter is the same if if
[1:17:40] mom if the daughter now god has placed
[1:17:43] this young lady
[1:17:45] as a daughter and this is the position
[1:17:48] that god wants her to reign in
[1:17:52] this is the position that god wants her
[1:17:55] to rule in
[1:17:57] now if we look at all these things that
[1:18:00] joseph's professionally written down
[1:18:03] here
[1:18:04] we can we can look at the dad
[1:18:06] and we can say
[1:18:07] dad in the position that god wants you
[1:18:10] to reign in you are to be a judge a
[1:18:13] peacemaker a friend a provider a teacher
[1:18:16] a warrior a influencer can we go to the
[1:18:19] back to the slide before that
[1:18:23] and you are to have wisdom to have grace
[1:18:25] to have humility to show leadership that
[1:18:27] fairness forgiving etc etc
[1:18:30] this is the position
[1:18:33] that
[1:18:34] god wants
[1:18:37] dad to be a king in
[1:18:44] this is the position that god wants dad
[1:18:48] to reign
[1:18:49] in
[1:18:51] and we can go right right on down
[1:18:54] same with the sun this is the position
[1:18:57] that god wants the sun to reign in
[1:19:02] and in that position
[1:19:05] god wants the sun to have wisdom
[1:19:07] patience grace humility he wants him to
[1:19:10] be forgiving show love be loyal be free
[1:19:13] white because there's other sons
[1:19:16] looking at this son as an influence
[1:19:20] true okay and if you can reign
[1:19:24] in this position
[1:19:25] then you will be the influence to these
[1:19:29] other people other sons that you're
[1:19:32] meant to be but only
[1:19:34] only through that only through being a
[1:19:36] king can you be the right influence that
[1:19:39] you're meant to be same with our sister
[1:19:41] here
[1:19:42] through through as a daughter god wants
[1:19:45] her to reign as a daughter
[1:19:49] so that the other sisters who are
[1:19:52] looking on can see an influence
[1:19:55] the correct influence and they can
[1:19:58] follow that influence and use that
[1:20:01] influence as
[1:20:02] an example and it's the same with mom
[1:20:05] and it's the same with that there's
[1:20:07] there's other moms and dads that are
[1:20:09] looking on to these moms and dads but
[1:20:11] god wants mom and dad to reign
[1:20:15] to be kings
[1:20:16] in this position
[1:20:20] okay and it's it's it's so so so so so
[1:20:24] important that you understand
[1:20:26] this
[1:20:27] um it's important that moms and dads
[1:20:29] understand this and it's as important
[1:20:32] for sons and daughters to understand
[1:20:34] this so much
[1:20:37] it will change so much
[1:20:39] in your life
[1:20:41] because eventually
[1:20:43] there comes a promotion
[1:20:47] where the son becomes a dad
[1:20:50] and the daughter becomes a becomes a mom
[1:20:53] or we could say the son becomes a
[1:20:56] husband
[1:20:58] and the daughter becomes a wife
[1:21:02] okay
[1:21:03] so it's so this is so important because
[1:21:07] if if we
[1:21:10] if the son comes home to dad and says
[1:21:12] look dad i'm bigger than you
[1:21:16] step aside yeah i'm i'm a king
[1:21:19] but if the son is positioned correctly
[1:21:24] and ruling reigning in his
[1:21:27] god-given position
[1:21:30] he will show dad the respect
[1:21:35] that dad
[1:21:37] that that the lord requires the son
[1:21:40] to give to dad children respect your
[1:21:44] parents
[1:21:45] and i'll admit that sometimes that ain't
[1:21:48] always easy
[1:21:51] but nevertheless god didn't say when
[1:21:53] it's easy
[1:21:55] said
[1:21:56] he said children respect your parents
[1:22:00] all right
[1:22:01] so so
[1:22:02] if the son is in the right position and
[1:22:05] he's reigning in that position he will
[1:22:08] show dad the respect that dad requires
[1:22:13] okay
[1:22:15] now
[1:22:16] can i get two more
[1:22:18] a boy and a girl
[1:22:20] sorry male and female
[1:22:22] i didn't know whether to do this one or
[1:22:23] not because it might get me in trouble
[1:22:31] my writing's not as good as yours joe
[1:22:40] i hope i spelt it right
[1:22:44] anyone
[1:22:45] get on your boyfriend
[1:22:52] on your girlfriend
[1:22:56] now i i could have changed this one and
[1:22:59] made put boyfriend under it and
[1:23:01] girlfriend under that one but
[1:23:03] i thought i'd just add add to the
[1:23:05] picture a little bit
[1:23:06] so
[1:23:08] obviously a boyfriend is a is a boy
[1:23:12] at least in our vocabulary
[1:23:15] it is
[1:23:17] but now
[1:23:19] the boyfriend
[1:23:21] wants to be a girlfriend
[1:23:25] to dad's daughter
[1:23:32] the boyfriend wants to be a boyfriend
[1:23:35] to dad's daughter
[1:23:39] you see you got to be able to handle the
[1:23:41] correction all right
[1:23:45] the boy a boy wants to be a the to take
[1:23:48] dad's daughter to be his girlfriend
[1:23:53] as a young man
[1:23:57] what god wants you to do is reign in
[1:24:00] this position
[1:24:04] right he wants you to reign in this
[1:24:07] position
[1:24:08] now
[1:24:09] i hope this is okay
[1:24:11] but what's your name sister
[1:24:13] marissa
[1:24:15] amy so
[1:24:17] amy
[1:24:18] is michael's daughter
[1:24:24] okay
[1:24:25] so what's going to happen here is
[1:24:27] because this young man
[1:24:29] is reigning in his position
[1:24:32] he's going to do the right thing
[1:24:35] by
[1:24:36] the by his
[1:24:38] potential girlfriend
[1:24:41] by addressing the dad of the daughter
[1:24:45] that he has an interest in
[1:24:47] because he is
[1:24:50] he is called he is reigning in his
[1:24:53] position
[1:24:54] so he is going to access the daughter
[1:24:58] through the one
[1:25:01] that the daughter belongs to
[1:25:06] right
[1:25:06] so the way that you're going to access
[1:25:10] your potential wife
[1:25:13] is to go through
[1:25:14] the father
[1:25:17] all right you can read john 17 in your
[1:25:19] spare time and watch the vocabulary that
[1:25:23] jesus
[1:25:24] uses when he speaks about
[1:25:28] lord i thank thee for those that thou
[1:25:31] hast
[1:25:32] given me
[1:25:36] all right
[1:25:37] and he was speaking of us he's speaking
[1:25:39] of his potent his bride his potential
[1:25:41] bride
[1:25:43] all right but the way that he was going
[1:25:45] to
[1:25:46] access his bride was through
[1:25:50] the father
[1:25:52] because it was the father
[1:25:54] that is going to give
[1:25:56] what belongs to him
[1:26:00] to him
[1:26:01] i thank thee
[1:26:18] now if the daughter's not reigning in
[1:26:19] her position
[1:26:21] excuse me amy i know you're not this
[1:26:23] type of girl but i just i'll just make
[1:26:26] an example
[1:26:27] if she's not reigning in his position
[1:26:30] she'll she'll try
[1:26:32] and
[1:26:33] and go around the authority
[1:26:37] her authority
[1:26:38] her headship
[1:26:40] okay because her headship is her father
[1:26:45] but because she's reigning in her
[1:26:47] position she has no desire to to try and
[1:26:51] get around her headship
[1:26:53] she'll go through her headship
[1:26:56] all right and if if this young man
[1:26:59] wasn't ruling and reigning by the spirit
[1:27:02] of god that is within him
[1:27:04] then what he will do is he will try and
[1:27:08] bypass the headship of the woman
[1:27:13] remember what what satan offered
[1:27:16] satan offered jesus the bride for
[1:27:19] nothing
[1:27:21] take it
[1:27:22] it's yours
[1:27:23] and that jesus said no the price must be
[1:27:26] paid
[1:27:27] i have to do things the right way
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:32] so what this young man does
[1:27:35] is he he doesn't try and avoid headship
[1:27:38] he doesn't try he recognizes the
[1:27:40] headship the relationship between
[1:27:44] between the father and daughter he
[1:27:46] recognizes that and he recognizes that
[1:27:48] the only way because this is a
[1:27:50] spirit-filled man this is a
[1:27:52] spirit-filled man and she's got he's got
[1:27:54] a spirit-filled wife and a spirit-filled
[1:27:57] daughter the only way that he is going
[1:27:59] to access what is his is through the
[1:28:03] leadership that god has placed
[1:28:06] over the men
[1:28:08] over the girlfriend
[1:28:11] okay
[1:28:12] it's it's this it's the same principles
[1:28:14] within church this is why brother random
[1:28:16] hits out so much at proselyting because
[1:28:19] proselyting has begu is going behind the
[1:28:22] headship
[1:28:23] right
[1:28:24] because the pastor is the headship and
[1:28:27] when someone tries and pulls the flock
[1:28:29] behind the pastor's back the person
[1:28:31] who's pulled
[1:28:33] ends up i don't know how many times the
[1:28:35] bible says worse
[1:28:38] than what they are
[1:28:40] when before they were proselyted
[1:28:42] and and and
[1:28:44] and that is the truth so this is if this
[1:28:46] young man here was to avoid the pastor
[1:28:49] of the home and proselyte the girl
[1:28:52] um his daughter
[1:28:55] then what she's going to do she's going
[1:28:57] to pay the price
[1:29:00] figure that out she's going to pay the
[1:29:02] price the person who's proselyted ends
[1:29:05] up worse than what they are
[1:29:08] but because this man has a pure heart he
[1:29:10] wants things done right he wants to be
[1:29:13] led by the holy spirit and he wants what
[1:29:16] is best for the one that god has placed
[1:29:19] upon his heart he will follow
[1:29:23] the right path
[1:29:25] according to god's word to get what he
[1:29:28] believes is his
[1:29:31] okay
[1:29:32] now if we can just wait there a moment
[1:29:36] colossians 1 27 says
[1:29:40] to to
[1:29:41] who
[1:29:42] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:29:45] riches of his glory of the mystery among
[1:29:48] the gentiles which is christ
[1:29:52] in you
[1:29:54] the hope of glory
[1:29:57] now for those of you that aren't a part
[1:29:58] aren't standing up here
[1:30:00] if christ
[1:30:02] let's start with dad
[1:30:03] if christ was in dad
[1:30:07] how would christ express himself
[1:30:15] sorry
[1:30:17] as dead
[1:30:22] okay
[1:30:23] so
[1:30:25] brother if you just allow me
[1:30:28] and this will i'll do it on you because
[1:30:30] it's easier
[1:30:35] it's christ
[1:30:39] expressing himself
[1:30:42] as dad
[1:30:45] right
[1:30:48] so let's go to the sun now
[1:30:50] if christ
[1:30:52] is in
[1:30:53] his
[1:30:54] in this son
[1:30:55] how is christ
[1:30:58] going to express himself
[1:31:04] as
[1:31:06] or through
[1:31:09] the position
[1:31:11] of sun
[1:31:15] it's magnificent
[1:31:18] it is glorious
[1:31:20] that just because christ is in you
[1:31:24] doesn't just because christ is in the
[1:31:26] sun
[1:31:27] doesn't put himself up doesn't put the
[1:31:30] sun above the dad
[1:31:32] but christ in the sun is it'll be christ
[1:31:36] expressed through the sun
[1:31:39] what about the daughter
[1:31:41] if christ is in the daughter how's
[1:31:44] christ going to be expressed
[1:31:46] as mum
[1:31:48] as dad
[1:31:49] as a son
[1:31:52] no if christ is in the daughter it's
[1:31:55] going to be christ expressed as a
[1:31:58] daughter
[1:32:01] is that right
[1:32:02] it's glorious
[1:32:05] it's magnificent
[1:32:07] the the confusion of headship
[1:32:10] is finished here
[1:32:12] because every one of these come under
[1:32:15] headship
[1:32:17] and christ does not work against his own
[1:32:20] word
[1:32:22] the dad
[1:32:23] is subject to christ
[1:32:26] the wife is subject to the dad the son
[1:32:29] is subject to the parents
[1:32:32] the daughter is subject to the parents
[1:32:34] it's christ
[1:32:36] it's
[1:32:36] expressing himself as if christ is in
[1:32:40] mum
[1:32:42] who is christ going to be expressed as
[1:32:49] mum
[1:32:51] mum ordinary mum
[1:32:54] plain mum
[1:32:57] this is why if the son has a has a
[1:33:00] something he needs to talk about he can
[1:33:02] go to dad and he can go to mum
[1:33:05] and he can find his answer his answer
[1:33:08] can come through dad because christ is
[1:33:10] working through dad the cro
[1:33:13] he can go to his mother but because
[1:33:15] christ is working through mum
[1:33:18] mum can give him christ's
[1:33:20] answer to the question that he had
[1:33:27] it's the same with the daughter if the
[1:33:29] if a daughter has an issue the the
[1:33:32] daughter can go to the mother and and
[1:33:34] even though christ is in her
[1:33:37] i don't need to go to mum
[1:33:40] i'm a king no you are a king as a son
[1:33:44] speaking myself
[1:33:47] and sometimes the son has to go to the
[1:33:49] father because the father has
[1:33:51] has got more wisdom than the sun
[1:33:54] so so what happens is that the sun needs
[1:33:57] to go to the dad for some wisdom
[1:34:00] the son needs to humble himself i'm
[1:34:02] sorry but however old you are you don't
[1:34:04] know as much as your mum and dad's
[1:34:06] okay they've been on earth longer
[1:34:08] they've had more experience and
[1:34:10] sometimes you need to humble yourself as
[1:34:13] a son to say dad i don't know what to do
[1:34:16] here
[1:34:20] same with the daughter the daughter can
[1:34:22] go to the mom and say listen mom um i've
[1:34:24] got a question about about this and
[1:34:26] about that and what's she doing
[1:34:30] she's submitting herself
[1:34:33] to the authority that god has placed
[1:34:36] over her it's not a you know a whipping
[1:34:39] authority it's a loving authority
[1:34:44] and this is why if
[1:34:46] he's gonna be expressed as the boyfriend
[1:34:50] all right and and how
[1:34:54] how if if christ is in the boyfriend
[1:34:56] what he's gonna do is you're gonna see a
[1:34:58] pattern
[1:35:00] you're going to see a pattern within the
[1:35:02] scripture where god courted us
[1:35:05] where our husband courted us we could
[1:35:08] say in in bringing it down to our how
[1:35:10] we're looking at this
[1:35:11] our boyfriend had an interest in us
[1:35:16] right but he didn't because it was
[1:35:19] christ it was god
[1:35:21] in christ reconciling the world to
[1:35:23] himself because it was god in christ
[1:35:27] because it was god in the boyfriend
[1:35:30] he he didn't he didn't not pay the price
[1:35:33] he paid the price for his girlfriend and
[1:35:36] then it was a a legitimate
[1:35:39] a legitimate
[1:35:40] joint joining
[1:35:43] it was a legitimate union
[1:35:45] you don't want an illegitimate union you
[1:35:48] want a legitimate union and the only way
[1:35:51] the union can be legitimate is if the
[1:35:54] boyfriend pays the price
[1:35:57] sorry boyfriends
[1:35:59] but that's just life
[1:36:01] and that's just the way it is
[1:36:04] but because of your love
[1:36:07] because of his love
[1:36:10] that he has for this one he wants the
[1:36:13] best for her
[1:36:14] think about this if christ didn't pay
[1:36:16] the price
[1:36:18] would that have affected us
[1:36:22] oh yeah
[1:36:24] oh yeah if it affects the proselyter
[1:36:29] the one being proselyted it would have
[1:36:32] affected us because satan was trying to
[1:36:34] proselyte us
[1:36:38] okay so
[1:36:39] all this is is christ in dad christ in
[1:36:44] the boyfriend because christ is in the
[1:36:46] boyfriend christ will be expressed as
[1:36:50] the boyfriend
[1:36:52] i got one daughter left
[1:36:56] if i don't see christ
[1:36:58] in the boyfriend
[1:37:00] then he doesn't even have a chance
[1:37:06] not everyone that has christ has a
[1:37:08] chance
[1:37:10] let me just put that out there okay
[1:37:16] so we understand
[1:37:18] it's christ expressing himself
[1:37:22] in the office or in the position the
[1:37:25] office
[1:37:26] that god has positioned you in
[1:37:29] now
[1:37:30] when when the sun
[1:37:33] becomes a husband
[1:37:36] it'll be christ expressing himself
[1:37:38] through the husband
[1:37:40] when the son when the husband becomes a
[1:37:42] dad it'll be christ expressing himself
[1:37:46] as a son
[1:37:47] you're never not a son
[1:37:50] as a husband
[1:37:51] and as a dad
[1:37:53] this is why it's a promotion it's not
[1:37:55] the pulling off of a stripe and the
[1:37:57] putting on of a different color
[1:37:59] it's the adding of stripes one stripe
[1:38:02] son
[1:38:03] two stripes husband three stripes dad
[1:38:08] granddad
[1:38:10] won't be long
[1:38:14] all right but it's christ
[1:38:17] it's christ
[1:38:18] and this is what god wants you to see
[1:38:20] tonight
[1:38:21] it's christ
[1:38:23] in you
[1:38:24] if your
[1:38:25] the boyfriend
[1:38:27] is not a husband
[1:38:29] i'm sorry but he's not he might think he
[1:38:31] is he's not he's potentially a husband
[1:38:34] but he's not a husband and god doesn't
[1:38:36] operate through potential
[1:38:39] god operates through where he is now
[1:38:43] amen so you you you as the boyfriend
[1:38:46] cannot take leadership with the
[1:38:47] girlfriend because the girlfriend's not
[1:38:49] yours you're not in the position to take
[1:38:52] the leadership
[1:38:53] this is why marriage is a handing over
[1:38:55] of
[1:38:56] hatchet
[1:38:58] and until
[1:38:59] until there's a union
[1:39:01] there's not a handing over of headship
[1:39:04] and until there's
[1:39:06] until then
[1:39:07] this young man is subject to his dad and
[1:39:11] he's also subject to the his
[1:39:14] girlfriend's dad
[1:39:15] what his girlfriend's dad says ghost
[1:39:20] i'm sorry boys but it does
[1:39:23] what the girlfriend's dad says goes
[1:39:28] because you are under you are a son
[1:39:31] you're not a dad
[1:39:34] all right
[1:39:35] so
[1:39:36] it's christ as a dad it's christ as the
[1:39:39] boyfriend it's christ as a son christ as
[1:39:42] mum christ as a daughter christ as the
[1:39:45] girlfriend it's christ in you
[1:39:48] where are you
[1:39:50] what's your position we have sons and we
[1:39:52] have daughters perhaps we have people in
[1:39:54] in as boyfriends or girlfriends i don't
[1:39:57] know but but but whatever you are christ
[1:40:00] will be expressed
[1:40:03] in the office that you hold
[1:40:06] and in that office thank you very much
[1:40:10] in that office
[1:40:12] god
[1:40:12] wants
[1:40:13] you to
[1:40:15] reign
[1:40:19] god wants you to reign in the office
[1:40:23] that you are currently
[1:40:26] in
[1:40:27] and that takes
[1:40:30] for for the most part
[1:40:33] it takes humility
[1:40:36] to reign
[1:40:39] because most of the time
[1:40:41] going by experience
[1:40:44] we think too much of ourself
[1:40:49] and god has to pull us back
[1:40:53] so that we can be
[1:40:55] who we are ordained to be
[1:41:01] when david made his error
[1:41:04] it was a time where the kings should be
[1:41:07] at war
[1:41:10] but david decided to stay home
[1:41:20] but it was in a time
[1:41:23] where the king should be at war
[1:41:27] because david
[1:41:29] thought he was above
[1:41:32] the authority that was over him
[1:41:35] he made mistakes
[1:41:39] and most of our mistakes speaking by
[1:41:41] experience
[1:41:43] is because we
[1:41:44] we lift ourselves
[1:41:48] to a position that we're not meant to be
[1:41:55] and god wants us to recognize
[1:41:58] our position
[1:42:00] and i say this again
[1:42:02] most of the time it requires
[1:42:05] humility
[1:42:07] because
[1:42:08] most of the time we have to come back
[1:42:12] because the 18 year old wants to rule
[1:42:15] the home
[1:42:18] the 18 year old is not called to rule
[1:42:21] the home
[1:42:23] dad is meant to rule the home
[1:42:27] the daughter wants to rule the home no
[1:42:31] the daughter is not meant to rule the
[1:42:33] home the parents
[1:42:35] are meant to rule the home
[1:42:37] as a unit
[1:42:40] so it's christ
[1:42:42] in you
[1:42:43] expressing himself
[1:42:47] through the office
[1:42:48] that you are currently in
[1:42:53] this is why
[1:42:54] your pastor has a heart for you
[1:43:00] this is why he prays for you
[1:43:04] whenever he can
[1:43:07] because in that office
[1:43:12] it's christ
[1:43:14] being expressed
[1:43:16] as a pastor
[1:43:22] amen so we are
[1:43:25] very privileged people
[1:43:29] because we are called to rule we are
[1:43:32] called to reign
[1:43:35] in this world that we live in
[1:43:40] this world struggles with authority
[1:43:46] it struggles with headship
[1:43:56] and we can't allow the influence of the
[1:43:59] influences of this world to influence us
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:11] so we want to
[1:44:12] be we want to do
[1:44:15] what god wants us to do we want to be
[1:44:17] what god wants us to be in the position
[1:44:20] that god has placed us in
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:25] now i'm not i'm not saying
[1:44:28] if if your parents ask you to do
[1:44:30] something that's contrary to the word go
[1:44:33] and see your pasta
[1:44:37] if a if a father asks
[1:44:40] sorry if a husband asks
[1:44:43] his wife
[1:44:44] to cut her hair she doesn't have to do
[1:44:47] it
[1:44:52] why
[1:44:53] because according to the word
[1:44:56] it's wrong
[1:45:01] all right so
[1:45:02] what what i'm saying here you might say
[1:45:04] well but i don't i don't know your
[1:45:05] situations all right so i guess i'm just
[1:45:08] putting a bit of a disclaimer in here
[1:45:09] that if you have disbelieving parents if
[1:45:12] you have if if you have this
[1:45:15] just believing parents who who who are
[1:45:17] who are trying to discourage you
[1:45:21] um from from current coming to church
[1:45:25] um
[1:45:26] talk to your pastor about it
[1:45:31] go and speak to your past say what what
[1:45:33] do i do what do i do in this situation
[1:45:37] but those of you who have believing
[1:45:39] parents you're believing parents if your
[1:45:41] parents have the holy ghost they're not
[1:45:43] going to lead you contrary to god's word
[1:45:44] they're going to lead you according to
[1:45:46] god's word
[1:45:48] okay but even someone
[1:45:51] who does you harm you can still respect
[1:45:54] them
[1:45:58] jesus was the lamb of god
[1:46:02] all right and they flogged those nails
[1:46:04] through his palms of his hands
[1:46:08] he didn't hiss out at them
[1:46:09] didn't strike out of them they had a
[1:46:12] part to play
[1:46:14] in in
[1:46:15] him being able to take his position
[1:46:19] and we don't like this
[1:46:22] but god places people around us
[1:46:25] that are there to build character in us
[1:46:29] they have their part to play
[1:46:32] the important thing is that you don't
[1:46:34] lose respect
[1:46:36] for
[1:46:38] anyone you be you reign
[1:46:42] in your position as he
[1:46:44] reigned as the lamb of god you reign
[1:46:47] in your position
[1:46:50] and if you have any doubts
[1:46:52] whether what you're doing is is is right
[1:46:56] or not you have a pastor
[1:46:59] okay
[1:47:01] in in god's
[1:47:03] economy
[1:47:04] the pastor is the shepherd and his flock
[1:47:07] of the sheep
[1:47:09] the pastor is there to give guidance to
[1:47:12] the sheep
[1:47:15] so if you have a question that's what
[1:47:17] your past is for
[1:47:21] the problem
[1:47:23] no i mention
[1:47:26] that's because
[1:47:28] in a church scene that's what god's
[1:47:31] given you a pastor for
[1:47:33] it's not just you it's the parents as
[1:47:35] well it's the grandparents
[1:47:38] it's the widows it's everyone he's he's
[1:47:41] the shepherd of that flock it's going to
[1:47:43] be christ
[1:47:44] expressed through that office
[1:47:47] so if you have a question about
[1:47:49] something then your your parents are
[1:47:52] there yes absolutely i'm not i'm not
[1:47:54] saying not to go to your parents go to
[1:47:56] your parents but i'm also saying that
[1:47:58] your pastor is there to help you
[1:48:00] as well
[1:48:02] amen so we thank god amen
[1:48:05] we thank god that he he has he has
[1:48:08] revealed these things to us and he has
[1:48:10] made it possible
[1:48:12] in our lives to be the
[1:48:15] leader that we're called to be
[1:48:19] okay
[1:48:20] so we we we thank god and
[1:48:24] we want to say thank you lord for
[1:48:26] revealing these things to me so i can be
[1:48:28] a better
[1:48:30] christian than than what god has than
[1:48:32] what i am currently
[1:48:34] and that's okay to say that
[1:48:36] okay so god bless you all
[1:48:39] does anyone want to comment or
[1:48:42] say anything or
[1:48:47] no one
[1:48:48] did it help
[1:48:50] yeah
[1:48:53] so i know that you want to be right
[1:48:56] and that's the beautiful thing about the
[1:48:57] bride
[1:48:59] is that she wants to be right the
[1:49:01] members of the body of christ want to be
[1:49:03] right
[1:49:04] and they want god's guidance
[1:49:07] in
[1:49:07] and sometimes
[1:49:09] they need god we need god's guidance in
[1:49:12] areas of
[1:49:14] that we didn't think we needed guidance
[1:49:17] sometimes we think we have it all worked
[1:49:19] out and then god just
[1:49:22] opens his opens himself up and says ah i
[1:49:25] don't have it all worked out
[1:49:28] lord
[1:49:29] lord like david said lord teach me thy
[1:49:32] ways
[1:49:33] that i might walk in them
[1:49:36] teach me thy ways that i might walk in
[1:49:38] them and lord while i walk in them
[1:49:41] may the people who are watching may i
[1:49:44] may may you be expressed as i walk in
[1:49:48] your ways because it can't be anything
[1:49:50] else as long as you are walking in his
[1:49:52] ways it's going to be christ that is
[1:49:55] expressed through you
