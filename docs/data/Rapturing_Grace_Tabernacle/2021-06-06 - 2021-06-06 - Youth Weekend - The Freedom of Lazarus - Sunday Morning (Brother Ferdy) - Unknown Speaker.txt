stratford sorry um and just being with the youth and being like the hospitality here has been phenomenal and we're like oh we want to come back again next week um but the drive's a bit long but we'll sacrifice anyway um but just uh it's just been absolutely wonderful and we are so honored and privileged just to be standing with like-minded youth and you know what um the devil can't say he doesn't have he can't say he has everybody because he definitely don't have us um and we also i also heard actually from someone that the song were about to sing was sung by the phenomenal rapture and grace

[Music] [Applause] oh praise the lord well it's lovely to be here together it's a just a wonderful wonderful atmosphere just appreciate everyone that's here this morning and just want to welcome you with all our hearts it's it's lovely to be to be having a bigger portion of the bride of christ here this morning and we're just looking forward to to a time when we can all just worship him for eternity i mean we can just dwell with him and where we can fellowship with each other where there's no deadlines where there's no there's no lunches there's no nothing that keep us keep us you know occupied otherwise i remember it just jumps to mind that there was a young fellow back in south africa who um his grandmother told him that that in heaven we're only going to eat fruits and vegetables he wasn't so impressed he said he said grandma isn't there anyone that can cook proper food [Laughter] but i'm sure you'll have will enjoy the fruit and vegetables i mean so i would like to say thank you very much to everyone that's here um i know that there's many sacrifices that were made just even to get here and my god really bless you for it just want to also take a moment to to thank all the different churches involved and and and families and so forth that is putting effort to get here and support these weekends of of uh just fellowship together and just appreciate you all just really privileged to to have you here um the church is kind of back to capacity and i trust there's enough oxygen and i trust is enough um space around you but if there isn't i just trust that that you can make the best of it and that that we'll just have a joyful time this morning i would also say thank you to the to the different song items and and just my god bless you i also want to just take a moment to thank our local church there's just so much that's gone into this i on just so many fronts there's been there's been hard work and there's been effort and there's still still some of that laying ahead but but my god just richly bless you thank you for all your support and contributions and and all the organizing and cooking and all the things that you all that my god just richly bless you for that i just want to excuse me highlight that themed scripture again that we that we have for the weekend behold they are good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity you know just recently i i listened to a sermon where brother venom speaks about the unity of god in his church and he speaks about how it's god's will for us to be in unity but not the ecumenical unity not a man-made political negotiated unity but a unity with god and therefore unity with each other because we become one with him and that's our desire it's really a desire that god will break down all the church barriers and attitude barriers and history barriers and whatever barriers they are i mean if we can all just be truly one that we can just walk forward and support each other and bless each other so i don't want to take up too much time but just um just one or two logistical things firstly we've had a number of brothers who prefer to visit the sisters toilets just because they don't know where the brothers toilets are so i'll just make sure that everyone knows the the when you go out the door the brothers toilets are on the far end so you go as far as you can and turn left and they're hiding there around the corner and then the sisters are just outside the door on your left hand side so just to make it easier and less embarrassing on everyone then also i trust the young fellows and and ladies remember your socks i've got mine on good stuff i see some lovely socks good work all right just have a little bit of fun that's good i'm just also a reminder we have a potluck at the war memorial hall after service so i'll just say again i know i i said that before but i'll just reiterate that our visitors don't have to bring anything um just bring yourselves and everyone is welcome to to come so if you don't know where the war memorial hall is if you just walk down the road next to the church here probably i don't know 200 meters maybe not even that much and the memorial hall will be on your left-hand side so you're all welcome there but there's an exit clause you only welcome until three o'clock and then only the youth and those involved directly are welcome after that so uh so please come make yourself at home and enjoy yourselves but then we're gonna just ask you to uh to let us let us alone with the youth for a little while still right so any any questions on that front anything that anyone is concerned or worried or unsure about praise the lord that was easier so now this morning um we have the privilege to have brother ferdi minister for us and i've never heard him minister so i'm really excited this morning and i think that makes him maybe a little more nervous praise the lord but um he's a he's a he's an old salt he's ministered heaps and he's he's ministered in many places and just just really looking forward to what the lord has for us this morning so i'm going to invite my brother now as we sing one more song i know simon was going to sing my hope is in the lord let's sing that i'm not sure what number that is simon i want to also say thank you i i'm impressed that your voice is still holding out [Applause] 242 342 thank you my hope is in the lord from this time off [Music] hallelujah [Music] of [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen yes lord let us pray father it's like the song says god my hope is in the lord [Music] and we stand here this morning god all because of you nothing lord god of man nothing of man lord and father i i may have some notes and things i think i want to say would like to say but god i'd happily set it aside for you to speak this morning lord because it's not about further father it's about christ and i'm addressing lord i'm standing in front of the bride of jesus christ and i'm conscious of that lord and god may the holy ghost put a watch over my lips and my tongue may i say nothing that would be offensive or would hurt but lord god you whatever's burning in my heart may it burn over my lips this morning and may you speak lord god to the people because god we we are needy people father so please take man off the scene and i like i prayed this morning and i said lord i'm i'm leaving 30 in the mortal lord god and i'm being bringing christ with me so my prayer this morning god i don't know the needs i don't know the people i don't know the young people god but you know lord and father this this is a two-way thing lord i become the channel the the connector between them and christ and so whatever the young people need they pull and you'll speak through me lord so i'm just the mute instrument that you speak through lord and god and i pray that there'll be someone that would pull this morning god i pray lord god that you someone here this morning will have a need and say lord speak to me and god and i just want to be the microphone that you speak through so bless the reading of your word and bless whatever shall be said and done as we wait upon thee in jesus name amen amen just while you're standing we'll read a scripture and then you can have your seats amen thank you musicians appreciate that a man and appreciate every items and songs but we'll read quickly shall we amen uh john we'll just go to saint john chapter 11. amen and after i'll read i've after i've read out to my greetings amen john 11 1

talking about lazarus and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go amen and then

can't remember but all i know is when we you know we we off the boat all right quite a few off the boat people right you landed here by boat or by plane you're immigrants okay amen yeah man praise the lord amen so uh and when we landed in new zealand these were the men that was that was preaching the gospel that we could come into a christian country and then we could find a church and we could serve the lord and remember paul we salute you and brother adrian and i thought brother bruce was somewhere i'm not sure i was told that made me even more nervous i was told the veterans of the gospel was here amen all the all the all the older men were uh adrian andy everywhere but uh i thought i heard andy say that now all the older brothers are yeah praise the lord amen so i i really i really appreciate that and so it made me even more nervous amen and but you see i know who i am i know who i am and i know where god brought me from and i know where i'm standing and uh 20 years ago i i was a little bit was a little bit less of me and 20 years ago i had more i had hair on my head and i've got a photo in our bedroom where i'm standing with the girls and my wife and with his hair on the head and i and i sometimes look at that and say is that really me you know and uh but praise the lord i am and my wife says i look good amen jenny says i look good and that's and so i don't care about anybody else jenny says i look good praise the lord amen and doesn't matter if you get out of bed and it's creaky and it's groaning but jenny says i look good amen and so i don't care about anybody else i don't care about the critics she says i look good amen and as always that matters eh amen praise the lord so god bless you and just good to be with you this morning and you know i i don't preach long i normally preach about three hours uh but i was told a man that we you know it's almost like back home in auckland hey you know people have to be conditioned and i always tell the believers when it gets to 12 o'clock they're still sitting there but they've already left you know what it's like you know you know they're still sitting there but the mothers already in the kitchen put the pots on warming the lunch and the brothers us brothers already thinking about our afternoon nap and you know but they physically still there man so praise the lord amen i i i will we trust the lord him i won't be that long promise you but amen and but i i'd like just you know especially i want to speak to the young people this morning and and you know it's just something about the young people and you know just see them serving god that's our purpose really good to see you two brother heroes and your family amen it looked like all of auckland moved yeah i wonder what it is amen i wonder what it is amen amen amen praise the lord amen but uh you know god has blessed us with a sick with a church i'm so glad church back in auckland and and i'm so glad to be part of a church back in auckland we we we call ourselves the united nations we have we have filipinos and samoans and tongans and new wings and south africans and i live at anybody and zimbabweans and all that sorry you know we're all over amen and what i love is that you know it's like a melting pot and we all come together with our different nationalities and our different temperaments and different natures and we and god has put us there and we all blend and we and we have the attitude that i honor my brother more than myself so when you walk into church there's one seat left my brother you have my seat you know my sister you have my seat we honor one another you know we respect one another and sometimes it's i iron sharpening iron you know jeremy you know that i am sharpening i am when even when a nigerian and a south african meat that's always always sparks that fly amen and uh nigerians tend to think they're better than south africans and the south africans say no we're better than nigerians and the you know and then the aucklanders say they're better than the stratford stratfordonians and you know that type of thing but hey we're going to heaven right and i like what one brother said he said it's going to be an eternal youth meeting and i'm not sure whether you're going to recognize some of us we're going to be oh brother gilchrist god bless you brother dean good to see you to a man and imagine all of us say in heaven and i always asked i said you know we um and i don't use the pulpit as humor but i always said i wonder when we get to heaven is everybody gonna have blue eyes and blonde hair and you know because we i i'm from south africa and uh and i always said my hair was a little bit backslidden you know i never had the straight hair and the long hair and and i wonder sometimes when i get to heaven what kind of hair will i have and then brother brandon says well what it he says that he says the hair is where it was before i had it right and i'm thinking man is it going to be like that or like that or just silly things you think about but as long as i know i'm going to be there and i told brother i i brought my socks i can't put it on i believe this is female socks i'm not sure so i i show you i'm i'm i'm i play with but i'm not gonna put it on all right i ain't gonna put it on i know i did try it brother was too tight around the leg and i thought nah and jenny says this is a girl sock man now so uh maybe i'll swap with someone eh but um but praise the lord amen uh uh you know we love the youth love the young people and i always say young people must enjoy god young people you must enjoy god you know what you're not missing anything a lot of times the devil tells the young people you're missing out you know and there's oh the world says you don't know what fun is and you don't have fun and you probably serving god man you say brother you're an old man hey i was baptized when i was 12 years old okay and that's 40 years plus a goal all right and today i am i'm not going to tell you all when i turned a certain age i told my wife couldn't do the invite she had to send out had to say 45 plus 5. she wasn't allowed to invite people to my 50th birthday the invite had to say 45 plus 5. so i am 45 plus some gst and things added to it all right but i always say you know young people need to enjoy the lord and here i am today after so many years serving the lord i enjoy the lord you say whether i have the microphone whether i'm in a bench whether i'm cleaning the church whether i'm doing whatever i do it all heart i don't want to be accused of being a lazy christian i don't want to be accused of being a slothful christian i don't want to be accused of being on the fence i want to all heart so what i do for god i do all heart that's what i want to encourage you young people so if you're going to serve god serve him all heart if you want to go to the world go to the world and serve the devil all heart but when you come here give him your all give him your everything and that's what god wants him and brother branham said god don't make halfway christians but christians can't be halfway but i don't believe i'm looking at halfway young people i'm looking at young people and i said if we can take that enthusiasm i mean brother marian that we had on the court yesterday man you and your brother man man you and your brother man you are like two competitive uh man i watched the two of you yesterday man oh man now i said if they can take that enthusiasm and they bring that into the church those two will set the church on fire there'll be like a house on fire on a windy day man i don't know where you get the energy from a but i test we had that when we were that aj but hey man we've got a little bit more miles under us at the moment amen and but god bless you amen and that's what i always say and so this morning just a man just to encourage you and like i was saying i was 12 years old when i got baptized and god filled me with the holy ghost when i was 18. amen and tell you the year 1983 then some of you also thoughts in the back part of god's mind amen 1983 on the 31st of december 1983 god filled me with the holy ghost and that's going back many many many many many years and it was that one experience that changed my life i've had many more i want i want to an experience with god on a daily basis that's what i want but it was that one point in my life that he turned me around that one point i used to go to church i won't tell you about all those stories we used to go to church we used to go to a certain pastor's church back in south africa cape town and we used to listen to the messages of brother branham on a sunday morning and then a sunday evening the brother the pastor preached a sunday morning three-hour tape of brother branham sunday evening a three-hour sermon from the pastor and you growing up as a 12 13 year old it was a rough man it was rough you know and i always say parents and i think the worst punishment we as parents can give our kids is to sit them down and tell them listen to that tape and you don't move from there that's punishment you know and sometimes we think we're doing good but we're not really doing good we we we're developing a hatred inside of that kid for the message you know we're developing within that child a resentment to the word but i tell you but if you can meet god and and i i don't want to tell you what happened but i but what i do know i met god and he turned my life around so as an as i say as an 18 year old i started serving god i know i was on fire for god and i still am amen i i didn't care about the sisters amen as an 18 year old i didn't care about getting married after 18 year old i was on fire i was serving god i we were all over south africa man it was me and god and the young people and i got married when i was 27 you know but those nine years i served god man i'm still serving him but as a young man you see this because when you married you care about how you keep your wife happy but as a young person you know it's all about you and god you know what i mean so don't always young people try to get yourself hooked and attached you know and a lot of times young people think when i get myself attached i'm going to serve god better no you won't if you as a young person can't give god your all you're not gonna give it to him as a married person but we for those nine ten years man we were all over when there was a youth meeting we were there amen when there was a youth camp in there and you know south africa the distances between cape town and kimberley a thousand kilometers or up to johannesburg i think it's 1800 kilometers or something like that you know we traveled weekend not even a long weekend we'd leave a friday night we'd leave after work load a van full of young people off we go to kimberly get there early hours of saturday morning we busy saturday busy sunday after lunch back in the vehicle drive back to cape town monday work that's how we lived because we loved god we we we loved to have fellowshipping with the sisters also but amen it was about god working for the kingdom achieving something for the kingdom being an annoyance in the devil's life that's right that's what i wanted to be i want to be an annoyance to the devil i want to be a household name in hell that the devil hates and some of you young people like you know yeah brother fuddy yeah that's what i am there's a poster of me in hell and under that is called most wanted now i don't know whether you are whether your name in hell is part of the fan club whether the devil has friended you where the devil has sent you a facebook friend be my friend but no my name in hell i've got the most wanted there brother [Applause] and it says dead or alive so young people have you been befriended by the devil are you part of the devil's facebook friend list i ain't i ain't hey man i'm on his most wanted list and i hate him he hates me and we out to get one another but you know what i know who wins i know who wins i win in the end i've already won a man and you know what i'm not waiting for the battle to be over i'm shouting now so that same enthusiasm that i used to have on the court i've brought it into church same when i'm there i'm here crazy there i'm crazy here on fire there on fire i don't have two lives i don't have two lives i don't have a life at work and a life in church i am not i am not a spiritual james bond a undercover christian young people you cannot be an undercover christian shaken and not stirred no you gotta be what you are at school at home wherever you are you've got to be the same amen so god bless you man it's a little thought this morning and i was on the yeah so god changed my testimony god changed me and here i am today yes 27 i got married amen and uh here we are today still serving the lord encouraging the young people pushing the young people i we we push them out of their comfort zone that's what we do with them we because we see the potential in them there's something inside of you young people that we as the seniors we see it and you may not see it but we see it and we're trying to get it out of you that's why brother andy keeps pushing you keeps pushing you we keep pushing you no we're trying to be funny but there's something inside that needs to come out and i thank god and then back then the youth leaders pushed me a man and here we are today so trust you're happy and then that was just a little introduction and i'll watch my time and then i get a test i gotta try and be like ua amen praise the lord amen 90 what was in somebody said 19 minutes and 58 seconds last night and that's always the hard thing for a minister hey i've heard ministers say brother you know your earlier years we used to ask brothers to greet the people brother already and they come and they greet the people and they preach for an hour and you know and they say oh no i felt the holy ghost on me and i felt inspired come on and come on but praise the lord i mean it's a little thought this morning and if you i'm not gonna pick on titles but a little thought i want to speak on you god help me man the freedom of lazarus i want to speak on the freedom of lazarus and and we know the story and i realize as young people and you know and we know the story of lazarus and we you know we know about mary and martha and you know and we know about lazarus that the bible says uh they told jesus lazarus is sick whom thou love us amen so jesus loved him and he was in bethany and then let jesus went away when lazarus was sick and emmanuel jesus was 15 fur longs away and i sort of googled it and thank god for google as i reckon they say about three kilometers away or something like that and uh you know and and so you've got mary and martha and and how that jesus came after four days i think it was or and martha's visitation says lord if thou had been here my brother would not have died and you know and so on you know we know the story and uh and then martha sort of says lord i believe in verse 27 of the chapter we read and then verse 28 she goes to call mary and mary tells mary sister the master has come and calleth thee and you know so you've you've got all these characters and that that's to play and and so when you look at and then you've got you've got the mourners in john 11 19 they had their place amen and you've got lazarus you've got the people that rolled the stone away you've got the people that took off the grave clothes and and and i always and i wrote down you and i said the freedom of lazarus was a strategic military maneuver big words i know right and that's the biggest i'm going to get for that the words right if you think about it because everybody says well lazarus was raised from the dead and they'd lazarus the grave but if you look at that chapter you'll find there were the mourners there were the professional mourners there were people that had to roll the stone away there were people that had to take the grave clothes off there was mary there was martha there was jesus this whole group of people just to get lazarus free and that's why this morning we we're going to talk about the freedom of lazarus and you may say brother why freedom why not the resurrection of lazarus but you see jesus said in john 5 24 he that heareth my word i'm telling you i'm not why i didn't call it resurrection he that heareth my word he that believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is past from death and to life so here jesus tells him roll the stone away you know the story and he says lazarus come forth and lazarus raised out of the grave but when he came out of the grave he was alive but he wasn't free am i right because he had the grave clothes around him and so yes he had been resurrected but he came out and if you google it wrapped in glare grave clothes and if they had left him in grave clothes can you imagine the quality of life he would have had because he would have been going hopping all over the place wrapped in grave clothes and he would spend his life like that and so here we are this morning brother if jesus if you are a christian if you've be if you've repented and you've given your heart to the lord you have eternal life so if you drop dead now and no one is here anointed to pray for you back to life you're going straight into the arms of the lord full stop because you have eternal life and one or two people believe that the rest of the young people are yes let's try that again young people do you believe you have eternal life do you believe you have eternal life all right do you guys believe you have eternal life do you believe you have eternal life praise the lord so if you agree with me now and then a little amen this is your service right young people they put you right in front i would have loved brother andy because i know andy would you know what i mean but they put you young people right in front so if you agree with what i say no wink at me give me a thumbs up give me a smile nod your head no don't nod your head say amen brother but you're not aiming further you're aiming in the word all right so here was lazarus lazarus come forth and yet he came hopping out if jesus had left him like that imagine what kind of life he would have lived that's why we're saying we are not talking this morning on the resurrection of lazarus we are speaking on the freedom of lazarus because right now every one of you young people you are you are have passed from death and to life that's why you're here you're a christian you have eternal life if you drop dead you go to heaven we believe that but the question we have this morning is are you free yes brother i have eternal life but my question is do you have the freedom oh are you young people still hopping in grave clothes sunday morning you come to church oh sunday evening you come to church great clothes raise your hands sorry i can't raise my hand because i've got the grave clothes around me brother i can't say no to the world i've got the grave clothes around me brother i can't i can't sing for god i've got grave clothes around me and that's why we're talking about the freedom the freedom of lazarus amen amen that's what a man and so this morning my question is what is the quality of your christian life that you're living now you say brother i'm going to heaven i'm spiritual let me read you a scripture go with me to galatians chapter 2. go with me amen i'm going to show you something and don't worry i don't teach amen but go with me amen maybe brothers we can put it on descriptions 2 verse 20. and i'm going to read you a quote what brother branham said so brother man so the paul says here galatians chapter 2 verse 20. he says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ loveth in me and now here's the key okay and the life which i now live in the flesh you mean brother as a christian there's a specific quality to this life that i'm living now paul is not saying the life i live in church paul is not saying the life i love when i pray paul is not saying the life i love when i read spoken words no paul is saying the life i love when i'm at uni the life i love when i'm at work the life i live when i'm in the mall the life i live when i'm with my buddies the life i live when nobody sees me that's what paul is saying not talking about are you saved i know you saved but i want to know what is the quality of your christian walk this morning that's what we're talking about i'm not talking about are you safe there's no question about that if you drop dead you're going to heaven but what's the quality of that walk with god this morning are you being tormented by the devil can i say lose him and let him go you being tormented by drugs lose him and let him go you say brother if you've been tormented by being a message member i say lucy man let him go [Applause] i want to let you know young people i ain't a message member and i don't want you to be a message member i don't want you to say i follow the message i want you to say i am the message you want to see the message yes the message i'm the message brother could i get a little bit more volume on the mic please if you don't mind thank you amen and the message remember ben talks about that wilds polishman he was standing there swinging his baton hey where's the revival where's the revival that welshman said i'm the revival and this is what you young people should be listen listen listen the devil is real the devil is real and i can say the devil ain't your friend the devil wants to kill you and those friends that you have that you say they're your buddies they want to kill you they're not your friends oh brother my school friend no they not your friends if they were your friends they'd respect you for what you stand they wouldn't be trying to pull you to liquor trying to pull you to the world trying to pull you their way no they'll respect you they'll respect you for what you stand for and i always say they ain't your friends brother you're looking for friends here's your friends yes your friends you say brother can i live a quality of life as a christian that i always have a smile yes you can what about these mental issues you can go free brother what about the last you can go free what about pornography you can go free listen listen i'll tell you what the worst devil is it's that religious devil that gets on the young people and they walk around with an attitude i'm in the message the problem is we as parents we put it on them we as parents put it on them so we got that attitude i'm a message member hi intermessage member brother i'm a believer i'm the pride hey hey and i the devil hates me and i hate him back i'm sorry i'm about to wild for some of you stratfor strat stratfordonians i apologize you know we're in auckland we're a little bit a little bit oh you know it can be a little bit rowdy as aucklanders we're a little bit noisier than normal as aucklanders we we tend to do a little things a little bit more louder hey man we and so i'm sorry about that i apologize brother i apologize hey man i have but i just want you know and that's so this is what i'm talking about paul says the life i now live in the flesh young people in the flesh you know young people we sometimes so heavenly minded we earthly no good but what we need you to be is get a career get a job save for a house save for a car and when you get to 27 find a wife find out enough but what i'm saying is what is the quality of your life oh brother i'm in the message i can't smile rubbish sorry i shouldn't have said that nonsense who said listen i've grown up in the message right and i've heard so many brothers say when they talk about pentecost that's flesh how pentecost is flesh pentecost is emotion brother branham said we shouldn't have emotion brother branham said what problem said a church without emotion is dead no we're not pushing emotion like the pentecostals that shout shout shout and no word we we lay down the word and the anointing comes on the word that's what we do so we say word first so we are word fed what's the other part spirit spirit lead that's what we are but brother brown says a church without emotion is dead in the olden days when the baby was born him in the modern way they don't do it anymore olden days babies born they take the baby slap the baby on the bottom and the baby shouts that's baby's alive that baby's not stillborn apparently you're not supposed to do that today i don't know ryan i don't know what they do nowadays hey man kim and amy they i can't even remember their birth anymore but what i'm saying is my point is but nowadays we say and you see what we do so we we present to the believers no emotion but then we present to the believers wildfire but we as believers we take that we take that we bring it to the middle of the road and we live a life a happy life i'm a happy christian i may not be a millionaire but i'm a happy christian i may not have my father may not be bill gates but i'm a happy christian amen you a man jenny may look at me and say he's getting bald and fat but she's happy with me and that's what i want you young people to be be happy being a christian hey brother i'm not happy then i will say lose him and let him go let's get those grave clothes off you amen amen i don't i don't want you also just to clap your hands because you think you're pleasing me i don't want you just to clap your hands because your neighbors clapping your hands i want you to think about it i want you to leave here this morning say lord if i am bound i want to go free that's what we're saying amen we want to tell the young people you can go free because jesus died to set you free so the life i now live i live that life i love now in the flesh so tuesday morning i will go back to the office tuesday you will go back to uni that life in the flesh but all of a sudden you say sin will not have dominion over me sin will not have a hold over me oh come on brother sisters you young guys you know what i mean walk down the street and the little jezebel smiles at you and she wings at you oh brother that doesn't happen to me brother you liar you lie let's be real young people let's be real you say brother i don't have problem with women then they got to pray for you then they really have to pray for you but you're telling lies brother it's i was telling someone the other day i was telling brothers i hope you don't mind you know we were sitting i was i was temporarily kidding we were coming home one day and kim and amy being in the car they were younger nowadays they don't want to drive with us they got their own cars and they you know told us the other day we're getting old told us the other day jenny and i said she told they told us that ginny and i we can't handle the pressures of life they they must look after us said god forbid by the point i'm trying to make young people and i learned to listen we're driving and kim and amy were talking about boys and brothers are coming at me i apologize they were talking about brothers and boys and oh man you see that guy and this boy and that guy and i got in and me being in my self-righteous message member condition i got so annoyed and i said will you stop talking about brothers you know holy fury man i hate that man i hate that self-righteousness that we parents have in the message man i hate it man sorry but anyway and there was silence for a couple of seconds and i know who of them piped up one of the two of them i think it was kim what was that aim you aim your kim my one let's say about them and they piped up and they said dad do you want us to talk about girls rather and i stopped and i thought i said wow and i learnt a lesson then as a parent i learned a lesson because i realized it's normal for the girls to speak about boys and it's normal brother arnold if you've got a eye on a girl it's normal it's normal it's normal listen the life i now live in the flesh oh brother i'm not interested in girls and i had we had a brother in south africa i am not interested in girls brother i'm serving the lord and he became a father out of wedlock you remember the brothers but what i'm saying is it's normal the life i now live in the flesh and you know this life i've got to pay a mortgage this life i gotta fix a car this life my wife and i have a fallout now and then and this life my wife tells me off and in this life the life i live in the flesh my quality of life with god is of a high standard because i'm not bound with grave clothes i'm not bound with grave clothes i'm not bound by message grave clothes i am free that's what i want to say young people and forgive the aucklanders for being noisy but that's how we serve god because we are free you say brother uh yes i've passed from death unto life yes i have eternal life but the quality of my life serving god yes we have battles and there's nothing wrong if you've got an eye on a sister or a brother's got an eye on a sister or sister and a brother nothing wrong but don't make that the priority no my if you want to i'll tell you sisters if you're looking for a brother look for a brother that's serving god look for a brother that's anointed look for a brother that's on fire don't look for a brother that's got this holier-than-thou attitude look for a brother that's well-balanced he can run on the court and can worship god look for a brother that's got a prayer life hey man so whoever the sister is that's after a brother go talk to parents that's right if you like brother petey go talk to petey's parents and say mom dad does pd have a prayer life sorry i can use him as an example he's my friend and that's what i'm saying you know don't just look at the brother in church oh he looks so nice and come on come on and don't look at the sister in church because he's got long flowing hair and she can sing and she can play and no what did brother kaido say go ask mom and dad can she cook but hang on hang on hang on neither do i prescribe to that the sister must do the cooking i thought i'd drop that there look at these sisters yeah [Applause] but what i'm trying to say is paul says in galatians the life i live in the flesh listen i'm trying to make a point to you this morning young people the life in the flesh now when we say flesh paul didn't say all foolishness paul was saying the natural life that i love he says what's the quality of that life is the world pulling you or is jesus pulling you what's the quality of what are you struggling with this morning what is hindering your quality of life today young people jesus said lose him and let him go yes he had eternal life yes he was just come from the dead yes you have eternal life but what's the quality of your life i was listening to that sister's testimony last i don't know where she is man she said when she was blindsided by that truck driver said man that happens huh that happens but you know he just wiped the dust off you and i always say i always this is what i say i said when i if i don't know something and i have to ask someone once i will make sure that i go and learn it but i will never ask again other than in church with some of the stuff these kids do with social media but i work because i work in the it industry right if i have to ask someone something i'll ask you once but i will make it my business never to have to ask you the same thing twice so i will go away and i'll go learn it and that's what we say so i'm saying if you are bound you can go free now i'm going to read you a quote i'm going to read your quote brother branham says oh my how are we doing for time oh wow this is what random says he says why are people so tossed about i'm going to read this for you he says the justified man oh that's the saved man he says the justified man he walks by daylight you know how we talk about the courts the outer court inner court holies of holies we're not going to go there and teach that we'll leave that he says the justified man now he's not talking about a sinner he said brother i've got so many dramas in my life but i thought i gave my heart to the lord no you did you did it's normal it's normal for pressures young people it's normal it's normal when the devil flies over and it drops a little thought in your head don't let him make a nest it's normal i want by the grace of god i want to normalize your christian work because we put christianity up now that we have to strive for that but i want to normalize christianity i know we are striving to be like jesus i know we are striving to attain specific goals in christ but i also want to tell you young people yes you have your struggles now they're looking at brother it's okay to have struggles it's okay to struggle to pray it's okay to struggle to listen to brother branham it's okay when your mom says your dress has got to be over your feet and you have a problem with it it's okay it's okay that you say brother there's this pool for pornography it's okay it's part of living but you can go free so i don't want you to sit here this morning and think brother if you just knew what i'm struggling with i don't want to know but i want to say it's okay you at the right place this morning because i believe god told me to speak this to talk to you about the freedom of lazarus you say brother my life you just knew it's okay if you knew what i'm struggling it's okay but you see that's why jesus died but the devil has lied to you and he said you can't go free the devil has lied to you young people and he said this is your normal life i come from a broken family my father's a mess nut case my mother's a nut case and look at me brother this is who i am you're at the right place you're at the right place you don't have to leave your don't have to live here you can live here this morning free this morning we are here to tell you we are saying losing loser and let them go yes you have eternal life yes you have eternal life if you die you go to heaven right now but what's the quality of your life this is what i'm trying to get to you this morning you can live a life of freedom you can live a life of joy you can live a life free of legalism a life free of the world you into oh my the influence of your friends gone the influence of the world gone but you know how to manage it then brother what happens you see now something comes inside you because what you're doing is you're trying to free yourself i'm struggling i'm struggling no you've got a posture he'll loose and let you go you've got ministers they'll loose and let you go you can go free so i want to read you listen so brother branham said he says the justified man he says he walks by daylight in the outer court some days it's gloomy you know those days you know those days wake up come from a meeting like this weekend and you go home tuesday morning you've got to go back to school you know those days and you walk into school and those ungodly friends of yours call you aside and say hey what have you done how did you enjoy yourself this weekend and then you sit

and why did i no no no if you love jesus listen listen oh my i always say if you fall in love with jesus you fall in love with jesus if we can put the same enthusiasm we put in finding a young lady and the enthusiasm we put in fighting a young man if we can put that into serving god man you'd be an awesome christian awesome christian but what i want to say young people i am not saying don't look for a husband i'm not saying i heard a minister say one time you said no okay i know sisters you say well brother i can't approach the brother i know you can't but what you can do is on your knees you

sisters sitting there oh my what wild man is that i was also your age sisters you know brothers that's right you know by the day i went free you know i know you're not going to believe us right i'm a bashful person young people i'm better than gospel truth i'm a shy person i'm shy right but the holy ghost killed their chinese i i couldn't sing for jesus and i'm the worst singer on the face of the earth helped my brother salvador oh tears you're in trouble oh daz you better pray he doesn't get the tape oh man tesla i've i put my foot into it many times you just didn't brother but i could i could identify with that because i'm not a good singer but when i sing for god it's worth the joy you say brother you are old man listen no when god filled me with the holy ghost from the age who's 18 and up who's 18 years old any 18 year olds 18 year olds young brother gilchrist when 18 year old when god followed me i was like a house on fire on a windy day it was the 31st of december 1983 saturday evening i know what i was wearing i know where i stood i know what the minister said and it's almost 100 years ago but the point i'm trying to make is i met god listen young people listen listen i also struggled i struggled with wrong stuff one day my hope my dad doesn't hear the tape one day my parents called me in i don't want to say it but i'll say it forgive me lord forgive me freddie dorian one day my parents called me in and they were so determined that i was gonna serve god they called me in and they sat me down and they said ferdi we told god if you're not gonna serve him we'd rather god take you home but we are determined you're going to serve him now you want to wake up call don't say i said that just keep quiet between us you want a wake-up call that's how determined my parents were that i was going to serve god so i grew up in a conservative church and i grew up in a church where you know we man i won't say the pastor's name because you'll know him also brother and i grew up in the church and remember we used to have brother eighteen to speak real to real tapes man you young people are very easy and then the pastor came in with those massive i wish i could show you a picture of this massive on a sunday morning he walks in there and we're listening to future home and brand future home christ is a mystery you give that to a 12 year old man it's a nightmare and we listened to that and i sat there and my dad was the deacon and my dad had this beard and us laverne man he was a meanie but he was he meant well my dad meant well because that's all they knew the message and the message and the message and the message and i resent it and i resented it but we meant well we meant well as parents and i sat there and bought a presentment and one day i went to kimberly finished my trick they called me in told me the good news hey you're going to go home what's up anyway that doesn't matter the point i'm trying to make and then i went to kimberly 1983 and i walked into kimberly my brother-in-law owen palm had a church in kimberly and the man kimberly was on fire i come out of a conservative church i come out of a conservative church where we sing out of the hymn book man we sing manifesting time we sing every verse that's the church i come out of and i want to say amen i want to raise my hand but the devil lies man and the devil says she's watching you you know young brothers you know you want to do this and the devil that sister's watching you and the sister you want to raise your hands and the devil watch your hairstyle that's the same old devil from back then and so we went to kimberly in 1983 dio gloria drove that thousand kilometers brother from cape town hey man how many of us four are saying four four

kimberly man i tell you man and the people were on fire for god serving god and your mr conservative walks in couldn't raise my hand didn't know what my name was couldn't smile for jesus young people listen grew up in the message i walked into that church that saturday evening and the minister stood behind the pulpit and he said the fire's falling in south africa he got us to form a human chain and the holy ghost hit me 83 and here i am almost gosh so many years but what i'm trying to say is god changed me that point there god changed my life then it wasn't about did you read the seals do you know christ the mystery do you know the church ages it was then about do you know jesus i met jesus in 1983 and i was telling the people you know what he did he came to me michael and he embraced me i didn't want to embrace you amen i'm sweaty he embraced me and i said listen i was saying young people and there's times that he embraces you brother it's time to say let me go let me know he holds he holds he holds he holds you and you you you try to walk away you try no he holds and you say let me go let now he hopes and he's been holding me since 83 93 2003 2013 30 years 40 years almost he's had his arms around me and every time he just squeezes tighter he just squeezes tighter he just squeezes tighter what did he do he took the grave clothes off me i was saved i was saved i had eternal life but this was me this was me brother in 83 i went to deo gloria like this engraved clothes and what happened a minister he came and he took that grave clothes off me and i walked out of there with the spring in my step with a joy in my heart young people with a smile on my face i walked out of that meeting that's right i walked out of there i could smile for jesus not just that the young girls i could smile for jesus i could look at the brother shake the brother's hand brother and i could smile with him because there was something on the inside i moved from a man a lazarus that was resurrected to a lazarus that was free i moved from a message member to a man that was the message i moved from i'm following brother branham to where i am the message i moved what happened i met god i met and this is what i want to encourage you young people with if you meet god sorry i'm all over the place i apologize no i don't but if you meet god you meet god he changes you he sets you free because i want to read the quote but brother branham says yeah i think i want to read it problems words are beautiful he says the justified man the man that's repented given his heart to the lord he says the justified man he walks by daylight someday he has gloomy days just put yourself in there you get it some days you don't know whether you don't know whether it's even worthwhile to serve god or not the justified man the man that's given his heart to the lord the man with eternal life brother braham says some days you don't even know whether it's worth while serving god he says you're walking in the outer court he says sure you're eating manna listen brother says sure you are a believer it's there you are a believer he says sure you have eternal life he says sure if you die you'd go to heaven but then he says but what kind of life are you living i'm not talking to sinners i'm talking to believers that have eternal life i'm talking to young people that have eternal life if you die now you're going to heaven but what kind of a life are you living what are you struggling with what what is tormenting you young people what are the issues that you have right now that you're dealing with maybe mom and dad what are the issues you're dealing with justified man sanctified man what are the issues and brother random goes on my he says my don't you hate to live that kind of a life he says the up and down the trouble a pool day and night backslidden then back to church backslidden then back to church he says does that apologize for this over here the justified man he says you're living in the outer court he says what you don't have is you haven't moved into the holies of holies he says maybe you don't have the holy ghost i'll read on brother brown says he says what kind of a life are you walking in according to the weather justified man i'm not saying you're not saved i'm not saying you don't have eternal life but brotherhood says what kind of a life are you loving what what what what traumatic what torments you what torments you young people when the lights go out early hours of the morning what omens you what is that thing that you're fighting with on a daily basis what is that thing that's pulling you slowly to the world you know you're slipping give that thing to jesus what is that thing that you oh my that don't listen they say they say mental health issues is one of the biggest killers and i always used to think believers shouldn't have mental health issues then i realize it's part of life but i've got something to give you that can help with it have you tried the gospel you know it's it's not the panadol and the brufen and the valium and the morphine have you tried the gospel have you tried the gospel that changes oh my let me read on brother brandon says my according to the weather it give the light outside the gloomy the foggy the listen the halfway then a bright day then a gloomy a fogging a cloud over the sun he says now listen this is the striking part he says that's the way the regenerated justified man lives because you're in the outer court and he says and when you move into the inner court sanctification he says now you live by the candlelight and he says they also get smokey so when your life is a roller coaster if that's the quality of your life young people just ask where are you living are you living in the outer court as a message member are you living in the inner court as a message member or have you gone into the holies of holies brother bran says when you walk in and the veil drops behind you and as a young person you now live a life he doesn't take away the jezebels he doesn't he's not gonna just because you're gonna serve god so you come walking he'll send the jezebel on a detour ain't gonna happen you're gonna walk down the street pradhana and brother marion and that jezebel will come walking at you and she'll try to catch your eye yeah maybe it doesn't happen in stratford maybe only happens in auckland maybe it doesn't happen in wellington maybe you guys don't have their problems in wellington you're very holy in wellington know in auckland young people said brother you know if you just yeah anyway but it happens i'd say now you walk and now she go there no no she's gonna come walking up to you and she can try to catch your eye and what is gonna happen is that she's gonna try to connect with your spirit and form a connection in the spirit realm and then you walk away from that i should have asked the number oh i should have gotten an email address maybe i'll try and befriend on facebook no what has happened you connected with her in the spirit realm but if you in the holiest holy of holies isaiah you there where the veil is dropped you walk and she comes walking i rebuke you satan she comes walking and you walk you don't even bother to look at her why you're locked in the holies of holies oh helen listen and the sisters also you know because no no the handsome guys seem to be sinners there's no there's no handsome guys in the message no i'll lie i lie i lie i'm sorry i apologize you say oh man 12 12 months left you say brother oba is nice to me say brother but he's nice to me and i like him and what did brother branham say when he asked well why do you like why do you like it guy oh he smells nice yeah probably you marry because he smells nice when he wakes up in the morning and he says hello his mouth is like her yeah you better love that boy then young sisters say brother but he's well built and he's got a six-pack his mouth also smells he doesn't use the odor and he's gonna smell when he raises his arm yeah oh brother but i like him yeah you like him you're gonna marry him because you like his feet and you like his smell and you like his six-pack you better pray when he gets to my age he still has the six-pack that's right i had a six-pack one day whatever when i got married it's gone but the point i'm trying to make is and so now when you're as a young person you god fills you with the holy ghost look at me said god fills you with the holy ghost you still have problems you still have trouble i am not going to tell you when you get the holy ghost your life is problem free but i am gonna tell you when you get the holy ghost he fights your battle [Applause] i don't fight my battle anymore see the minute i try to fight my battle i'm gonna flop i let jesus fight my battle and so when i walk into the office when i walk into the office you know what i do when i come up the left to the third floor i say i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god that's i walk into the office and i won't tell them they're devils i used to try that and they used to get at me but now i walk in in my heart i bind you satan i banged you satan i banged you every spirit you know why i'm not fighting god fights god fights god fight was why i've got the holy ghost and brother branham said so when you get the holy ghost doesn't mean now you immune from battles no now the enemy comes after you but young people you've got now something on the inside you've got the christ the life i now live in the flesh because paul says christ lives in me now i live a life in the flesh because now it's god living in me and it's not that hard it's not that difficult just get the holy ghost after that god smile i got no joy oh brother i can't get away from that worldly girl oh brother i can't read my bible but i can't pray grave clothes has got you bound but i say this morning lose him let him go no i've got to finish i've got to finish right no so now you say brother now i'm free but now my question is i want to turn that around now what about the lazarus in your life what about the lazaruses in your community what about the lazarus is there where you work what about the lazarus that lives in the home with you what about your brother that's bound what about your sister that's bound what about your cousin that's bound now young people what do you do now you free now you tell the good news now you tell the good news now you tell the world because i find because brother branham said he says eternal life is loving for who others eternal life is loving for others and so now god sets you free now you go set others free you leave here tomorrow and you go back to your church to your community say brother you may be mary you may be martha your purpose may just be to roll the stones away your purpose may just be to take the grave clothes off your purpose may be just to be the mourner but we've got eternal life let's go and share it let's go out there and tell the world about jesus let's go out there hey man so now i'm done eh i'm done it's eight minutes to 12 i'm done the life i now love what's the quality of your life young men young girls what's the quality of your life i'm a christian i know you're a christian what's the quality of the life that you're living now say brother i want to go free you can go free you want to go free you can go free but brother i'm serving the lord but if you honest he said brother i got no problems what anybody tells me i've got no problems brother i got my life as sweet as that's it maybe the devil's got you but brother brahm says you become a christian to fight you become a christian to fight so i say young people go back to where you are from and go and fight don't roll over don't listen i declare in the name of the lord don't roll over don't when the devil slaps you on the one cheek give him the other chick that's the only time you don't have to turn the other cheek that's the only time when the devil don't i want to say take a stand stop being some wishy washy roll over and you you know sometimes young people we are gonna we are so selfish because i need to say this as young people you are so selfish sometimes you you just concerned about me myself and i my problems my music my this my clothes my that's why young people you still struggling with the length of your dress the music you must listen to what you can do what you can't do because you are still struggling with because you're too selfish what we should be doing is we should be concerned about what about that soul there that's dying what about that person out there that's lost their way what about that person and when i take the focus of me and i start going after those that are lost and i start going after the lazaruses in my home the lazarus's in our church the lazarus is in our community that what about the lazarus is james stratford what about the lazarus in wellington michael what you're doing about them what are you boys doing about them in wellington what are you doing about them in stratford the lazarus is in stratford i believe as young people we should stop me my problems my issues my situation my this my that imagine martha and mary had said oh i'm so sad my brother died and they went into a corner and they went to go and cry my morning my sadness lazarus would have still been dead do you know what they did we're going to go find the source of our problems we're going to find the solution and they went to find the solution how do you know you're not the solution how do you know young people you're not the solution brother i don't forget about ministry how do you you're not the problem solver how do you know you're not the one that's supposed to set the neighbor free how do you know you're not the one young people that's supposed to set your colleague free that colleague that you work with that you always talk to always how do you know you god hasn't sent that person into your life to break the chains how do you know and so this morning as i close the freedom of lazarus are you free and if you're free praise god if you want to go free you can go free if you're honest with yourself and say brother these are the things that are binding me you can go free you can go free this morning and that's what i want to tell you young people the freedom of lazarus the quality of your life as a christian you say brothers i jump well you don't have to jump but i scream now you don't have to scream but those things that are tormenting you it can stop today it can stop today god sent us to let you know and you have a pastor you have ministers to let you know it can stop today some of you are looking to brother i think

appreciate how the the i don't want to say the message but how us in the message i'm maturing by god's grace amen you know we i i grew up with this idea that you know no one in the message ever gets divorced no one in the message goes through real hard times no one in the messy message will you know die of sickness none of that kind of stuff but the reality is we're living the same lives as everyone else and it's and and if we if we create a false impression then we make it impossible to reach now is god a healer amen is god our peace amen is god our shepherd amen and and he wants to manifest those attributes to us but while we're living those things god allows things i was reading again this week where brother and just make statements about he says it pleases god it has put us through hardships it pleases god to allow his trials to come why because he needs to beat the gold so he can see himself in it i mean it's for our purpose for our benefit even brother andy will you close fasting primo brother hey man let's just bow our heads and hallelujah what an awesome service and we just want to be thankful to the lord and and sensitive in his presence right now and as we pray if there is somebody some young person or some parent that didn't make that decision when it was called before this is one more call you in the solemnness of this moment in the presence of the lord can defy gravity and raise your hand and say lord i'm sick of my past i'm sick of roller coasters i'm sick of being tossed about by winds and slates of man i'm sick of being tossed about by my own opinions and every other opinion fear and all of these things and right now in his presence as we pray just raise your hand to him and make that all sufficient decision to receive his all-sufficient atonement lord jesus father thank you for the service lord truly lord we don't want to leave here like we came in jesus name lord we want to walk lord jesus unbound untormented unsick
