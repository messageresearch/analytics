TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Uh if you wouldn't mind, we'll just maybe pray one more time. Our dearest heavenly father, Lord, as we stand here tonight, Lord God, though we may not feel worthy to stand here, Lord Jesus, and though Lord, you know the road that brought us here, heavenly father, but Lord, this we're not looking to us or anything else tonight, Father God, but we're looking to you, Lord. The only one who can meet every single need that we have, Lord Jesus. Lord, and we know, heavenly father, as a as a human, we may want to help somebody else, Lord God, as a man, Lord, but we know we can do nothing without you, Lord God, but with you, we can do all things, heavenly father. Lord, so we just surrender ourselves to you tonight, heavenly father. And I pray, Lord, you touch the people, Father God. May you just may you speak to where they are. I pray, Father, and may they know it's you, Lord, for we know a man can't help. So, we thank you for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you guys. Just put that there. All right. Um, God bless you all. Uh, greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Um, it's good to good to see all you guys and um want to thank brother Al for the opportunity to to be here. Um, see if we can get that to change real quick. There we go. All right. Praise the Lord. Um, pretty nervous, but we thank the Lord. Anyway, I um maybe before we start, we'll just we'll just start with the scripture. I like what the prophet always said, "My word might fail, but his never will." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just go to St. St. John 142 and um and um he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him uh speaking about this is Simon here and when Jesus beheld him he said thou art Simon the son of Jodah Jonah you know, thou shalt be called Caophosis, which is interpreted a stone. So, this is this is where um this is where Peter got his name. All right. Uh I just uh I'd like to ask if uh is is anyone um from Paris, anybody from the vintage area era? Oh, come on now. Ended in the 20s, but you all look like you're from there. So, what's what's going on? But you're not that. So, you see I think we can sometimes look like something that we're not, you know? &gt;&gt; And that that's our thought tonight. Um, I'd just like to maybe I'll leading into it, I just in praying to come here. um knowing that there's nothing I could say that would would help you. Um so we're we're completely dependent on the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Um but a thought kind of came to me. It actually brought back a memory of a a pivotal time in my life when I was actually the same age as you guys, which I'm not far off from you now, but this is a little while ago. and um and um I' I'd been doing my thing. I was uh at the time I was actually uh a pipeliner in Canada and that's who I was. Um that's what I did for work and that's who I thought I was. And um I I got I ended up, you know, wasn't serving the Lord or anything like that, but I end up getting a phone call from an uncle of mine who was a Christian. And whenever I was around him or around Christians or whoever I was around, that's what I was doing. That's who I was. So, um, anyway, he he rung me up one day and he said he said, "Who are you? Do you even know who you are?" And this coming to to me at 22 years old, of course, I'm a pipeliner. I know who I am. Like, come on. Um, but but he asked me the question. He just said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm not telling you to be this or be that." And I think that's that's an important thing. We you can't tell someone to be this or be that. You can't as much as I I could stand here and ask you to be Oh, yeah. Just up there. Good. Thanks, brother. All right. Bless you. As much as um I might ask you to be from Paris from the 1920s, you can look the part. I mean, we all look the part, don't we? But that's your efforts and that's how far it'll get you. &gt;&gt; And um you know how many we all go to a message church I believe, don't we? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just look the part. &gt;&gt; And that's okay. That's what we do. We're humans. We blend. &gt;&gt; But at some point it's something's got to change &gt;&gt; cuz you can't just go around looking the part. What good does that do you &gt;&gt; know? And at some point you got to be asked the the the question comes at some point. See this is it's funny because this question who are you? If we look at um there was there's these guys in in in the Bible um and um I could go to the scripture but we'll just just stay with me here for time sake. Anyway, they go to cast out a devil and they said, you know, they they're using they say Jesus and whom Paul preached of. And the devil goes, Jesus I know and Paul I know, but who are you? &gt;&gt; And and what are you going to do? This is this is the question that Satan comes to you with. This is the question Satan came to me with. That's how I know. &gt;&gt; And um what are you going to do when the question comes to you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, are you going to go, hey, don't you know who I am? My mom and dad been in this church this whole time. my dad preaches or you know my my mom and dad help set up the tables. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Your mom I know your dad I know but who are you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know &gt;&gt; and and when the question comes here's the beautiful thing about it and and the question this is really what Satan was asking Eve in the garden. Who are you? &gt;&gt; You know but when the question comes you it's already been answered. This is the answer. This is the only answer. Okay? &gt;&gt; This is the only thing that can tell you where you came from, &gt;&gt; who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; And where you're going. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; God answered it for you. Now, the question, the problem is where we get in trouble is we try to answer the question. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We try to answer the question, well, I'm Can you see who I am? I'm vintage Paris, man. But &gt;&gt; you were never called to answer the question. You were called to accept the answer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's that's what you were called to do. This is you were born for this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You were born to accept the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is pretty cool because, you know, in school I never I I was homeschooled, but I, you know, I played played the man, not the game. All right? So, I cheated. All right. But I I found the answer key. I didn't understand the answer. All right. And I didn't um I wouldn't say I I had uh Yeah, I did. I wouldn't say I understood the answer. I still don't. All right. But I the the point is I had the answer. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with the answer? You've been given the answer key to life. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And I'm lazy. I don't like to study and this that and the other for especially when it comes to school. I like to study God's word. And I'm sure you all do. But it's still hard. But you've been handed the answer key to life. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with it? It's not mom was this, dad was this, or my brother was this, or &gt;&gt; I'm New Zealander. Like, you know what? New Zealand. I know. Who are you? &gt;&gt; You know, it's funny because Peter, if you'd asked Peter before Jesus came to him who he was, he'd have said, "I am Simon. I'm a fisherman. I'm this. I'm that. What you do isn't who you are. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Who you are is why you do what you do. &gt;&gt; All right. It's you know how Peter Peter backslid. All right. He denied Jesus. Denied Jesus you know three times before the cockcrow. Um, we could go back even, you know, a after Jesus passed away. Where did he where did he find him? He found him naked fishing in a boat. Did he go back to being called Simon? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did he Did he lose his name? &gt;&gt; You've been given a name. You are the sinless, spotless bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You have been given a name. Why? Why has Christ come? He's come to tell you your name, &gt;&gt; who you are. That's right. &gt;&gt; You just got to accept it. &gt;&gt; And yeah, it's just beautiful. You're not going to just cuz you backslid or whatever whatever state you're in. Um I don't know you guys and you probably don't know me. Maybe some of you do, but it um that doesn't change who you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's just a point in time in life. &gt;&gt; I might actually just read a quote here. Um on that um actually before that I'll just give a little personal testimony. You know, a about a week and a half ago, I backslid. You know, we do. I I went backwards. I I uh you know, you kind of life gets real busy and whatnot and then I you know, you get caught up in death scrolling on YouTube on the shorts and whatnot. And does that mean I'm not saved? Does Does that mean does that whether I backslid a week and a half ago or not? Whether I've stood here stood with the Lord for 50 years, does that any of that give me a right to be here? &gt;&gt; No. We're we're not it's not anything we can do. &gt;&gt; We just got to accept grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to accept it. &gt;&gt; It's here's a quote from brother Brandon in the to in the token uh paragraph 178 here friends. If you ever was healed, if you if you live long enough, you're going to get sick again. But you you if you take one time, take the token, you've had it forever. grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption. Not to the next revival. You wasn't sealed. You You wasn't sealed until the day um whereby you were sealed until the day of your redemption. Not to the next revival. You wasn't sealed. I'm just having trouble here. You got emotionally worked up, but you are dead. And your life is hid through Christ. And you are sealed by the Holy Ghost. If you are once baptized into that Holy Spirit, now you can backslide. That's true. But you can't get away from that seal. You're sealed into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever Whatever happens in life, stuff happens. Life happens. It does. &gt;&gt; It just does. &gt;&gt; But what are you going to do with the answer key? We thank the Lord. Eh, &gt;&gt; he knew. He knew we were going to fail. He knew we couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; He knew we would try to dress up and look the part. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And he saw right through it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Sometimes we even fool ourselves for a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we thank the Lord that he allows us to see through it, too. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, and only he can do that for us. &gt;&gt; You know, what could Peter do for himself? What would Simon do for himself? Is he going to just hop out of his fishing boat one day and call himself Peter? He he could have, but we we we see Christ coming. &gt;&gt; That's what brought about the change. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. in um just going to in Matthew 6:27. It says, "Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?" &gt;&gt; Do you want to make yourself better? &gt;&gt; You can't. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Only God can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You got the cheat code. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, it um this is something the Lord really dealt with me on. Um I've seen some of you um through the years at the youth camp and this last youth camp I was I was really struggling physically and everything else. Um I was just like, man, I don't know if I can keep doing this. Like I don't know if I'm going to be able to. We got we got two kids now, you know, and life gets busy. But the Lord really helped me with this cuz um if I'm never able to help out again, that doesn't change who I am. And if you're never able to do anything, if Brother Al is never able to preach another sermon, that doesn't stop him from being the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If if he could never serve another person, &gt;&gt; it doesn't change who he is. &gt;&gt; You see, what you do is not who you are. &gt;&gt; But who you are will make you do what you do. &gt;&gt; You see the difference? If somebody walked in here from the 1920s and came dressed the same as us, he'd be doing the same thing we're doing, but it's different. &gt;&gt; It's just different. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It'd be a lot easier on him than it is on some of us. &gt;&gt; Because it's real. &gt;&gt; And that's what this word is. It's real. &gt;&gt; That's that's what that's what God is. He's real. And I I know you you all know this and I'm not gonna tell you anything you don't know, &gt;&gt; but the an the question of who you are is just not for you to answer. &gt;&gt; But point it to the answer. What did Jesus do when he was here? When he was tempted? When he was led away. And I'd like to add this part here. Jesus was led away into the desert by the spirit to be tempted. of Satan. You You think just because you fall into temptation, it's because of something you've done wrong. You're led there by the spirit of God. Sons and daughters of God are led of the spirit of God. I just love that because we just got to accept what he's done for us. Brother Brham tells a story about how his wife and um before he gets married, she had her her last name, &gt;&gt; but after the marriage, she had his last name. And then what she did was in the name of brother Brown, William Brown in in the name of Brown because that's his wife. &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know what you do is in the name of Christ. &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not your strength. And thank the Lord for that because we run out of it. &gt;&gt; We do. You if you haven't come to the end of your rope yet, you will. &gt;&gt; He lets us do that and that's his grace so that we know so that we can know that we can't do it &gt;&gt; but that he did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See my wife over there, there's things she can't do. She can't carry heavy load. She's a little woman. What kind of husband would I be if I if I tried to make her do it? If knowing she couldn't do it &gt;&gt; and if I as a natural man with the love that's in my heart for her wouldn't let her do it. How much more are loving our savior Jesus Christ when he sees you struggling under that load that you were never meant to carry &gt;&gt; that Satan tried to put on you. &gt;&gt; It's not yours. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's not. And then Satan coming to you. Who are you? Who are you? I know this. I know this about you. I know that. It's like, do you know my Lord? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Talk to him. He said it. &gt;&gt; I might not even see it. &gt;&gt; That's fine. &gt;&gt; He said it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, you could you could come up to my wife and say, you know, who are you? Who are you? Sort of thing. what you know what what business do you got hanging out with that guy? It would probably be the other way around, let's be honest. But but she just said, "Go talk to him." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and I and I I believe that's what we need to do cuz the devil's just in our ear 24/7. &gt;&gt; You know what? Go talk to my husband. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So he can recognize him. He just uses that approach. He's just slicker. Like, what kind of what kind of guy is going to come up and talk to my wife &gt;&gt; about about her and carry on? &gt;&gt; You just recognize it right there from their approach. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not coming through the door. &gt;&gt; Anyone that doesn't come through the door is a thief and a robber. Are you living off a past reputation, off a past experience? If you look at the children of Israel, God never respected them on what they had been. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He treated them on how they were currently. &gt;&gt; But they were still the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; They were still his people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whatever state you're in doesn't change who you are to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're not living off any past deposits in the bank. Let's get a fresh experience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in um in who do you say this is in um 64, brother Brandham paragraph 66 he says just notice how how few recognize him him to be the anointed word of that day. See God in the beginning being infinite and know all things from the beginning. And the only thing that these things are is the display of his attributes. An attribute. You have an attribute. That's your thought. You you think of something and then you speak it. Then you take it. That's God. He in the beginning. If you're if you ever was or ever will be in heaven, you was in heaven to start with. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You can't buy your way in. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Can't can't buy the right suit. Look the part. &gt;&gt; He did that for you. &gt;&gt; All right. He's in heaven to start with. You're you're part of God. That's really what you are. You were his thought. He knew your name. He knew who you are. Who you were before there ever was a molecule. &gt;&gt; Before there was a light, before there was anything, he knew you and your name. So this guy that's coming to you and asking you who you are, well, if he doesn't know, get lost. You were before him. &gt;&gt; And you are after him. &gt;&gt; It's who you are. &gt;&gt; He's got to get with the program. &gt;&gt; God said it. Before there was anything, he knew you and your name and put it on the Lamb's book of life. Before the world was ever formed. See, you were his thought and then uh then you became a word. And a word is a thought expressed and then you're manifest. That's who you are. The bride of Jesus Christ. You know the um I'm sure we all know the story about the the the slave when the the guy went to the markets and he seemed there's this one slave and he just kind of conducted himself a bit differently. &gt;&gt; You know if um I'm sure we all know that story you guys are all well taught, well raised. But see that that guy knew who he was. &gt;&gt; But he didn't come to the own conclusion. You know who told him who he was? His father. &gt;&gt; He's a son of a king. &gt;&gt; And that's that's that's who you are. Son of a king. &gt;&gt; You're kings and priests, chosen of God. Amen. you know, um yeah, it's it's it's just very easy to get caught up in thinking what we do is who we are. I I just really my whole life I was just looking for acceptance. Um just wanted to be whoever I I grew up I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up kind of all over the place. Uh we moved around a lot as a kid and uh just always wanted to fit in. Um it's funny because when I I grew originally I was I was born in America and then to Canada and then America and then Canada and then America and but when wherever I went just just looking for that acceptance and I know that's what each and every one of us want. We just want that acceptance um from our from our peers, from the guys at work or whatever. We just want to be one of them. &gt;&gt; It's that's natural. But you you can't fit in with something that you're not. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you ever in woodworking or whatever, if you ever take a square peg and try to hammer it down a round hole, &gt;&gt; you wonder why you get so tied up in knots. And uh and it's just so hard to carry on. It's because it's not you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um and you don't have to take my word for it. Just consult the cheat code. &gt;&gt; All right. It's a guaranteed 100% every time. &gt;&gt; It's pretty good. And I know it works. I could show you my grade my grade average at school. It was pretty good. Especially for somebody who's not educated. But you've been given the answer key to life. What are you going to do with it? I um won't take any more of your time. The help of the Lord. Just if you were helped at all tonight, just know it's not us, it's the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can't help each other. Only God can. [Applause] Amen. That's so good. That's uh it's just so real, brothers and sisters. You know, it's it's something that we that we so programmed as human beings is that we need to earn. We need to be good enough. We need to, you know, produce the goods. we need to um somehow meet a standard or meet a requirement or buy our access to God. You know, Brother Brandon makes statements. He says if if we could do anything if if we had anything to do with our salvation, Jesus Christ died in vain. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And the his intention is not for for us to meet God halfway. God is not God is not giving a a cheat code in the sense that if you do your bit um then maybe it will be good enough and you'll be qualifying for me to then add my part. There's nothing like that. It's all him &gt;&gt; and and he chose us before the foundation of the earth and he we were in his mind and there already we were sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's so beautiful how brother Bo has brought out that once we identify who we are, we need to accept who we are. And that makes us who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we are already that. But in our own minds, we, you know, we think we're a we're a Simon when really in God's mind, we're a Peter. And in our own minds, when we look at our when we look at our mistakes, we look at our weaknesses, we look at our battles and oh, all the highs and lows and the mountain tops that we think we we a son of God and then we get to the valley and oh, I must not have been a son of God. It doesn't work like that at all. From God's perspective, you were sealed before the foundation of the earth. Brother Rana makes that awesome statement where he says that the that wedding ring was put on our finger before the foundation of the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Already there. &gt;&gt; And really, we don't have a choice in the matter &gt;&gt; if God chose us. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, there's, you know, you remember that story of the guy who um who testified at work to another guy and he handed him a spoken word book and and the guy came back and he said, "Don't ever give me a book like that again." Because the man in that book called me a buzzard. And he said, "My goodness, I can't believe that. I read the same book and he called me an eagle. &gt;&gt; And that's really what it's about. You know, you can say, "Well, God is unfair. How does he give the cheat code?" Well, you'll only say that if you're a buzzard. &gt;&gt; The eagle is not going to complain about it. &gt;&gt; I mean, we're going to say, "Thank God." &gt;&gt; But really, it's God's grace. It's the beginning to the end. It's all God's grace. &gt;&gt; But brother makes a statement. He says when you preach like this, people think that, you know, we're going to we're going to um I can't remember his his specific words, but he says we we we get afraid that we people are going to get slack. Really, if you know who you are, if you know you're a son of God, you love him. &gt;&gt; I mean, you want to serve him with with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the whole the whole thing is once you recognize what your identity is like that son of that that king even though he was in a situation where he worked as a slave &gt;&gt; he was still a son of a king &gt;&gt; and he and he and he interacted with his environment. He interacted with people around him as if he was a son of a king because he knew who he was. And it's so it's so good because you know brother Bo has referred to situations like um in our work situation we sometimes feel we want to fit in in our school we we try to fit in. I I take my own my own um young days, you know, and and well, not just young days. I mean, there's there's always someone that puts pressure on you to ah just just have a beer with us or just come out to to the pub with us or, you know, just come watch this game with us or whatever it is, you know, you know what whatever the situation is. And and as as human beings, we so try to fit in. &gt;&gt; But the reality is it's the grace of God that doesn't let you fit in. &gt;&gt; It is God's grace because you were not made for that. &gt;&gt; You were made for eternity. You come from eternity. You go back to eternity. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And really the only place where you can find your identity and where you can find uh that sense of belonging, true belonging, eternal belonging is in the word of God &gt;&gt; because that's where you get that revelation of who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know as young people very often and and you know you're a range of ages, but growing up your your probably some of your biggest mind battles is about acceptance and about where do I fit in? Why do I feel like I not I don't fit in anywhere? And and I want to say this to you this evening. Take these things that our brother has spoken, take it on board and and ask the Lord to show you it doesn't matter if your closest friends agree with you or not. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. God just wants you to see who you are in his word. And not all of us others, you can be a son of God. Your brother, your sister, your your natural brothers and sisters may not even understand you. But that doesn't matter because God has made you in a unique and specific way because he has something for you. &gt;&gt; And ultimately when you find your identity in Christ then that identity guides your decisions &gt;&gt; and and it doesn't make your decisions dependent on whether people agree with you or not. &gt;&gt; But you you as a son or a daughter of God, you can live out the life that God has predestinated for you. Praise the Lord. I don't want to take up any more time. It's uh it's been just a a really special time. Thank you, Bo. God bless you.
