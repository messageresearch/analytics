we'll hand over to brother Michael I could say I am nothing and I would be telling the truth I could say I am worthless a hopeless sinner that's [Music] true but that's just part of the story I haven't told you everything I was lost Reborn born and raised a child of the [Music] king and I'm a royal descendant of the king of [Music] Jerusalem I'm a part of the bloodline of David that's who I am and I claim kred to Isaac to Jacob and Abraham I'm a royal descendant of the king of [Music] Jerusalem how in this world can I stand and say such a [Applause] fe to say that I'm Royal and claim that my father's a king I'll have to take you to an altar where it happen many years ago Hallelujah I met the king I'm his and now that's all that I [Music] know and I'm a [Music] royal [Music] [Music] amen that's beautiful word I'm not familiar with the song but amen it's um very valid very pertinent very much to the heart amen so we appreciate these songs that were divinely given amen from above I believe just to place us and to show who we are you may be seated for a little bit amen it's real good to be this side of the world literally uh we are from the other side of the world practically um from South Africa I was born in Durban not far many of you would know about the Durban meetings brother brandham had at the race at the race uh the horse racing Place uh graville where we know many many Souls came to the Lord and all that that one few incidences and um then raised a little bit higher up the road in a place called pint town and then at a pretty young age we moved up to Johannesburg side so we very much established some of you might know brother vly retif that has gone on to be with the Lord he was a real stward of the Gospel he established many many different churches up in Africa he's very well known and he's just was such a tool that the Lord used and my uh shall we say my my uh the base of where I was sort of established in the message under him we have so many wonderful uh memories and uh shall we say um uh building up growth underneath them and then about 7 years ago the Lord just led me to be going to another church that's on the other side of Johannesburg called ran fontain uh and they I'm under brother Ruben Daniels and he sends his greetings to to the church from his side amen he uh he uh was just so happy that we could have this privileges to come this side and we just want to make sure that we amen just give God all the honor and glory for making this possible so may the Lord just be with us this evening we just don't want to keep you too long recognizing it's a Wednesday night there's many friends family Amen brother Adrian God bless you good to see you amen he's ministered for us a couple of times and we should been and blessed by his ministry and we had some wonderful Fellowship good to see you amen so that's about it I would say let all rise to our feet at this time as we would just turn to an opening scripture here amen Romans 8 is there something I don't know [Laughter] about did he read from there well there we go we'll take that as a sign amen so I can be right at home Romans 8 amen 15- 19 amen I do we also have a presentation I'd like to speak on tonight recognize your position amen recognize your position by God's grace and we trust that the Lord will will be amongst us amen also just want to obviously acknowledge our dear Al and pillar they very close to our hearts if we've come a long way together as our brother said and and we really just appreciate also just the Friendship his ministry has also blessed us and I believe he's really being a tool in God's hands amen so readers thus and you I like to often just refer to some of the origal so as we would read along if I just sort of stop going where I am and and sort of jump back in forgive me but I like to S go into the originals of many of these things so I actually had an opening quote I was going to read but we'll come back to that now amen for you have not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear now that fear when you go into the original it's referring to Terror dread and I believe brothers and sisters we truly live in a neurotic paranoid and anti Faith age at this time amen but thank the Lord for buts in the scripture amen which is the opposite you have received the spirit of adoption and when you go to the original of that adoption it's referring to understanding who you are and coming into your correct position amen whereby we you we cry AB father why because we understand our lineage amen we understand where we come from and who is our father amen our true father is above us hallelujah the spirit is bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen so there's a a Unity there's a correlation between his spirit and our spirit it's the deep that causes the deep and it marries together amen and if children then HS Hallelujah CU that comes with the package hes of God and Joint air with Christ amen why due to the direct lineage we inherit all that's his if so be that we suffer with them that we may also be glorified together because surely we do walk a very similar if not the exact same path he had to walk for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation that is the anxious and P consistent expectation of the cre the creature which is the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen all of creation is waiting for you the bride Amen to realize who you are amen let's just close our eyes for word of prayer dear heavenly father we just come before you humbly Lord knowing that we can't bring much of ourselves we're just vessels for you to be used but Lord God it would be all fruitless if we just stood Lord knowing all things but without your spirit anointing it Lord so we ask that you anoint me but not only me anoint the people Lord that what can come from here will just will Quicken Lord it will bring something to life that could be dormant Lord that we may see fruits that will come from the service we ask in Jesus precious and wonderful name amen and amen God bless you you may be seated at this time I'll remove my jacket if that's okay with everyone amen so I would like to just start with the opening quote here just sort of tying up with my my title the new birth is Christ is a revelation and everyone needs a new birth Revelation it is so important it's not something you can exchange it's not something that you can figure out one to another not even a husband and wife can truly know it has to be you and God it has to be Revelation between you and him God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the the church the bride only knew its position but praise God it will one day amen and then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is amen so that's where I'm just going to pull my inspiration amen of recognizing your position because I don't know about you I'm tired of this world Amen I I know we can't push things I know God will move in his own time but I believe there's a bit of a two-fold purpose because Christ is in US amen amen so he's he's got the hook he's got us and we need to just stop fighting against the current and let us let him reel Us in amen so that we can be the vessels he wants to be to use amen that we can be the love slaves amen the prisoners that he desires in these times amen so may the Lord help us that 2024 may it be a special Year may it be a year maybe that we can just go home by his grace amen but we would have to come to the position of recognizing and knowing who we are and may the Lord help us because sometimes we have distractions amen sometimes we have things that hinder us and sometimes it's it's not obvious you know Som we live we complex beings we we try un being and and the flesh is the man that you the the the woman that you pamper in the window before you the mirror before you go out to work and you know the spirit man well he he's he's a he's a complicated one he's he's pushing both sides sometimes and and then you got The Soul Man and he's often the most quiet of them all and that that's the most important one amen so we have these these Realms we are in and as a human it can get confusing and that's often what often leads us not to inherit and to get all these great blessings that God has desired us amen so may the Lord help us may he lead us may he take us to higher Heights amen now just to move on Colossians 1:25 to 27 it says as thus now I want you to listen to the words here and this is so important cuz this ties in directly with understanding and recognizing your position wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and all from Generations so this this mystery has been head for so long brothers and sisters but there was a prophecy going forth amen that there'll become a time when this would just come forward amen and revealed in its fullness but now is made manifest to his Saints and our dear brother Paul amen he was inspired when he wrote this and truly they had a portion of this but the full amen Revelation the full unveiling of this is now brothers and sisters we have come to the fullness of this but now is made manifest to his Saints amen so what is this Revelation this one that's been hid through all the ages to whom God would have known what is the Riches of the glory of this mystery amongst us the Gentiles amen what is this mystery Christ in you in you this is the hope of glory amen that Christ the deity the Divinity of Christ himself would come in humanity in its fullness brothers and sisters not in part but completely amen unveil behind a human flesh amen that that you can just see when you read the sermon Christ is the mystery of God and you just look at how the prophet his main focus we're going to talk about that sort of you could say as my subtitle the second fold purpose of God but how God was so Desiring that that we would come to understand our position that we understand who we are that the bride is actually the mystery of Christ revealed amen because we've moved on brothers and sisters we we we call to something more at this age and if you want to sit there and look at yourself and look at your your own failings and your flesh brothers and sisters it will hinder you you'll never move forward with God but you're going to have to find a divine inspiration and to be able to sacrifice what you seeing and and your feelings and come under that anointing amen that he can have the preeminence over your life it can seem some unreach unreachable but amen but God by his grace in this day has made it reachable amen he's come in Simplicity amen he's come with his arms wide open in love amen he's come in the the cool of the evening he's married us we're in his tent he's pregnated us with the word man you you don't even have a choice brothers sisters does does a woman have a choice you know to control the growth of the baby absolutely not once she's pregnant that baby just grows whether the woman likes it or not she can't stop it hey and there'll be signs there'll be the belly Gro amen there'll be morning sickness spiritually speaking amen yeah you got to feel some things brothers and sisters but by God's grace the word will be manifest in its time amen and it's such a privilege it's such an opportunity we have in this day amen and it as I said it was spoken about through all the ages and now it's coming into his fullness but we need to be the vessels that God can use by his grace amen so yes God didn't call you brothers and sisters to make it by the skin of your teeth I know the Bible says that in the last days there'll be so bad that you know it'll be even hard for the elect to make it and that he might even have to shorten the days and he and he is you just see how the time is flying but but the reality is brother and sisters as we called to a higher calling did you see Christ when he was here on Earth just making it just slipping through I made it thank goodness no in control of the situation knowing his position knowing who he was amen and as Christ was was the full representative of God and flesh so we have another dispensation that has changed over and there's a bride amen there's a bride that's fully representing Christ on Earth don't don't doubt who you are brothers and sisters don't doubt your abilities it's just a matter of subjecting yourself to him and then the word can flow and you become such a an example to this generation as Christ was an example will you have to bear a cross of course you will will there be tough times absolutely if someone wants to sell you a gospel that it's nice and easy and you're just going to have a happy joy ride to heaven I'm sorry to say it's not going to happen amen but he said I'll be with you amen I'll never leave you or forsake you he said I'll never give you anything more than you can bear so whatever he's given you brothers and sisters even though it may seem dark it may seem hopeless and may seem depressing he is there and he will take you through just trust him amen he's promised that all things amen would work to your good didn't say they would be good but they'll work towards your good amen so hang in there you will be manifest at the point of time you just have to learn to trust in him amen so what are you talking brother Michael what what why isn't this just this typical Christianity you know we must just be repent and baptized amen the Holy Ghost will come upon you absolutely that's 100% gospel but we've called for one more step in this hour amen look what it said here now that's the same thing that constitutes the new birth water blood spirit the elements that came from his body is what makes his body see it come from his body uh is the material that takes to make his bride because Adam had his bride taken from his body Christ has his bride taken from the body and when Christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood spirit justification through believing water sanctification through the blood the baptism of the Holy Spirit but it doesn't end there now this last great step this last great step must come into the Perfection that the hope Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll make the head and the body unite together CC that's the body he is the head in the body now we find that he promised in these last days brother and sisters where we are living that that would be done we find it whether you believe it or not brothers and sisters it's happening and it's happening around you don't you want to join the party amen and let the Lord make you a vessel that he can be used amen because the the end of the day brothers and sisters if you can't see your value if you can't see your potential you can never be used the way God wants you to be used amen but if you can just change the way you think the way you look at things the way you know the promise just for the Holy Ghost itself the promise was that you become uh Living Waters you know when Christ met that woman at the well and he says do you want to drink you know you want some Living Waters that will never you'll never thirst again that is the exact same if you go to the original that's the exact same thing that he says when they receive the holy ghost out of their belly their soul if you go in the original shall flow rivers of Living Water the exact same thing he offer that woman at the well you possess inside of you brothers and sisters you can give it salvation is of the Lord absolutely there's predestination we know that absolutely but don't you want to be a vessel that can save someone you know there's different there's different Avenues brother and sisters yes there's there's the bride in in the temple but there's possibly going to be billions outside that Temple and how can they receive life through you someone can offer you a cup of water and they weren't even part of the original thoughts of God but just because inside of you you carry a living water you give life to someone that never had a hope some people make God an un unfair God God was only obligated to his family just like everyone here I'm obligated to my kids I'll help where are can absolutely but the reality is I'm I'm obligated as the father of my household to provide for my kids and my wife am I right when you with the original people were part when you originally part of God he was technically only obligated to you but my God just extends the borders as far as possible you know there's things that we we s can't comprehend we'll you'll be surprised who's going to be given life on that day and as you standing with God Amen on on this side remember you this side you're not going to be judged the sheep and the ghats that become before God is not you you you the predestinate you going to be judging with God and those that will come before you the Bible even says the people that will be given life won't even remember they'll say when did we help when did we clothe that one when they were naked and gave them water they won't even know Glory but there you'll stand forward and you'll say man that guy helped me change my tire when I had a flat and that one helped me at work when I didn't need it and you know what that man even though he's a homosexual wrote a song that so touched me in a time of depression and lifted me up and he gave me a spiritual cup of water blessed are the merciful for they shall receive Mercy that is Broad brothers and sisters how deep how far can that go you know we with our minds can so you know limit that you know we don't understand God's depth a basic action not even involving you just someone showing Mercy to someone a kind heart you know we don't want to make it cheap but I don't know I like a god that is willing to give favor in life to as many as possible amen that's my type of God Amen so let not Liber at God and remember he's used he wanting you to be used as a vessel that can reach out that can touch that can make the difference so next time maybe we in that heated argument maybe think well how can I maybe change the situation that this person can maybe receive something maybe they're not seed not all is C to seed but some people can receive life through you the Living Waters in this day and don't forget you'll also be used as a junction as a joiner for others that have got that seed cuz God wants to use you in this time amen so the Lord help us the Lord help us to have a bigger Vision not about me and my little my little you know little bubble as such to go out of the mall when you're in the mall and you see the roughest guy from tattoos from head to toe and and looking like you you don't want to step a step in this direction he's going to murder me or something but hey these people you don't know where the possibility is you know I know it may seem extreme but I'm just giving you some examples that we can have amen so Lord help us may he help us just to understand our idea amen of what we have because truly if you if you think you're a poper spiritually speaking amen you'll stay that way you won't you won't be able to to reach out you won't be able to go further hey man I didn't see many beggars but when I was in Oakland I saw a couple Beggars but um back in South Africa we have a lot more and you can imagine a beggar you know nothing you know there's we have real real problems back there there's there's real starvation issues and malnutrition amongst the the many of the folk back there because it's a there's some serious poverty back in South Africa and um there's people that canot eat for days that's just the reality of what it is back there it's it's harsh you know it's really really bad sometimes but I mean you can imagine a I'll I'll maybe just paint it in more of a as I say from where I come from but you can imagine a bigger side of the road he's never had a meal maybe for couple days now ragged Tatty hair is a mess hopeless got nothing imagine a a black limousine pulls up in front of him out of nowhere you know guy steps out the car full tuxedo looking the part it says uh good day are you uh are you Mr Smith yeah yeah what do you want well I don't know um is this your ID number and he reads it out and yeah yeah that's my ID number well I don't if you we but um back in Europe there's a family relative and uh the the the the the the lineage has run and you are the nearest living relative me yeah yeah you I don't know I've never heard of him never before never had no no no connection well it's you can you please step into the car you imagine the guy in that condition stinky starving feeling terrible now it's stepping into a vehicle that is you know pristine in its way how uncomfortable would he feel he wouldn't know where to sit what did I do I don't want to touch anything I just want to sit you and how that you know you know he would not even know what to say not know what to p his P his face but meanwhile without whether he realizes or not that limousine is now his the shur driving the vehicle is his shaur the two bodyguards sitting next to him is his bodyguards you know but he doesn't realize who he is and you know what maybe as time goes on maybe he gets back to the hotel and they give him a good cleanup and he's look feeling a bit you know got to shave looking the part a bit better still uncomfortable not quite knowing where gets in a private jet flies back to Europe you can just imagine this guy is out of his comfort zone man he doesn't know if he's coming or going the B guy and the reality is this is what Christ has done for us brothers and sisters spiritually speaking with nothing but a beggar and a poer but he came and he's raised us up but within our minds spiritually speaking we struggle to reach to understand the place he's caught us that at all things you hold Amen in your hands you can imagine him sort of trying to learn the ways of the English pump back there you know the now he has to mix with some high society back in Europe you know and as you know some of you may been to these fancy places you know there's about four or five you know Forks this side and another four or five knives and they all have a purpose man the guy doesn't know what to use man he's used he's used to Fe eating with his hands and now he's but he gets trained he gets trade and he starts to become comfortable in his position and when there's checks that need to be signed off we don't really use checks anymore maybe a pin on the on the on the credit card you know it's he has it he has the power and slowly but surely he starts to feel comfortable in his position and we need to get there brothers and sisters but you can't get there until you engage with what's yours and so you start turning on your mind to to say it but yes we have clouds around us we we struggle some us to see that remember this message is not a tradition brothers and sisters it's not just a way of life it's not just something we do for fun and you know my my parents brought me here and this is what you all need an individual experience you didn't know this is me you need not be bored you need to be excited you must be willing what wow what do I have what a what an incredible purpose a vision like the Bible says you don't have a vision the people perish may the Lord help us amen so just to go through you know what you you're very familiar but let's just go through this quickly notice God has a had a three has had a threefold purpose in his great mystery secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world begun he has got a three-fold purpose in it and now what we got what we want to go upon this morning is what is that three-fold purpose see now I Believe by the help of God who is present he'll show it to us now if we had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people which is through Christ on Earth God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till you could have preeminence to express himself through them and then thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowship with them to think brothers and sisters there's only been three purposes with God since the creation and you are one of them you are part of it am and where are we now we're at the second fold purpose purp of God at the moment the First full purpose of God has been accomplished Christ was on Earth God had the preeminence through him where has it gone to us and like a relay at a at atletics you know the kids we do the relay race and there's the Baton amen and Christ amen has handed the Batton to his bride amen God ran with it first while he cre well through creation all those things there came a point when he handed that to Christ andrist accomplished what he needed to accomplish amen and and ascended to the right hand of God Amen with the god of the power and the the the the the authority he needed and then from there he said my bride I want you to take the Baton amen the bats and lies with you brothers and sisters it s hard to to Fathom it SS hard to figure out but that is where it is and that was in the scripture we just read the great hope of glory Christ in you that's what he's looking for that's what heaven and it's a mystery because it's in a sinful flesh so you can see the P the perfect picture where brother bams talks about and the Bible talks about all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his bride amen let's just read some of these they're just beautiful because the bride amen has also got a Ministry and this batter that has been passed on you brothers and sisters you need to take it up and run with it yes the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece this is unfortunately what has happened out there the nominal Church they've just forsaken God's word they've not they've not they're not listening not prepared to to to submit to Humble themselves to what the word says so God is turning on her and how is he turning on her he will confound her what through the prophet praise God we all appreciate the prophets amen he formed such a beautiful part but it doesn't end there brothers and sisters and the briad for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be reputated which is to be rejected as in the first age look at the quote at the bottom from token it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same like we were saying Mercy lies with you brother sisters that River of of Life sits with you what will you do with it is my question what what are we doing it how do we think about these things because it's really powerful amen let me go back y so let's explore this all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was chist important to God so we start with God you know the perfect God logos he he created that there was something to worship by the angels we know him as Elohim self-existing one creator of heavens and earth amen I don't know about you but this God and as when you read about God in the Old Testament he in times of great Mercy he shows but sometimes as God can seem a little bit harsh of the Old Testament a little bit distant a little bit out of touch but this God by his grace came and all that was in him he went and poured into Christ now it's starting to feel a bit closer to home brothers and sisters now it's starting to feel like something I can associate with because this Christ even though it was perfect God in flesh and yes he was no he had no sin but he was tested and tried in all things all things amen let me go back all things I know but um I suffer from this bad habit and this addiction all things but they didn't have incident back then yeah of course but Spirits don't die they just start manifesting in different ways don't you think it's funny that when Nathaniel was called uh by was it Simon and he said can any good thing come out of um you know Nazareth I mean why why you know is there was there maybe something going on back back back where Jesus grew up you know we don't know the situation we don't know how bad how you know what the situation was that Jesus brought up it could have been intense incredible things that he had to deal with that we wouldn't understand so when the scripture says all things it's all things he had to and that's why he has become the perfect mediator and high priest for us cuz he understands you brothers and sisters he understands your fight your struggle what you are going through he gets it it's not strange to him and he's now become a friend and a lover to us he's our helpmate he's one that can take us through but this is where the picture gets hot and this is I believe where the where the bride in this day is struggling because all of that we were all very comfortable to talk about that but then when we go to the next step that all that was in Christ that came into the bride o goodness this one is different this one arrived in a condemn condemns flesh and sold under sin this one came into the world World speaking lies amen born and shaped in iniquity man that's where we are brothers and sisters that's where we came and on top of that we come with spiritual Amnesia we don't remember where we came from am mean we don't we we we we heard we we we Sons and Daughters of God but we should have remember and we come with all this baggage all this this this interruptions these these veils before us that needs to slowly but surely Stripped Away so this thing is a problem for us and it hinders us but thank God that he's come to make us hopefully understand a little bit more so we will now leave God and we know God is Christ but let's just move off that old shall we say dispensation and let's move into Christ and the bride because there was a similarity that had to be accomplished with Christ as what is required with us so here's Christ and the bride and what has to happen with both adoption Christ even though he arrived perfect on Earth with no sin no mistakes he had to come to his place of adoption and the same thing is required of us in this day so now we have a direct link Christ couldn't get away with this he had to come to his adoption and we have to come to our adoption same thing so now we got something that is directly correlated between us and Christ and maybe this is where we can start to see amen maybe where these things are because it can actually understand what is adoption what is it all of and I know son's adoption it can be interpreted in different ways you know brother BR comes in adoption shares he talks about finding your position in the church as a form of adoption knowing who you are but then there's another step of adoption brother Braham talks about the word being fully manifested in you you through third pool and stuff like that coming out where you can you know you can you can speak amen things that aren't there another form of adoption where the the checkbook if you sign it is as good as as God's signature on that checkbook and then there's which you could call the ultimate adoption which reveals if you adopted or not is is the going of the Rapture so there's almost like a three-fold you know uh three-fold uh shall we say unveiling of adoption now adoption and and this Perfection that we we we talk about it it it has to be something we understand clearly because this is where we sudden getting very confused so adoption coming to the completion maturity and end goal now notice what I've written here not Perfection of the flesh as Christ was born perfect but still required adoption remember when Christ came on Earth he was born perfect as a babe if if if he if if Perfection that you do nothing wrong in this flesh was the requirement that you are thinking in your mind that you do nothing wrong well then the second Christ was born he should have been adopted but he wasn't only towards the end of his ministry in his 30s does he receive his adoption when he goes on Mount Transfiguration so you need to understand what this is what when the Bible talks about coming to your Perfection the adoption whatever it is you need to make sure you place it because if you focus on me doing nothing wrong and me always in control and and and you know I just got it all together and I never seem to slip up you you you focus on the wrong thing you will never get there that's right what is adoption it's getting the victory of character remember you have to rule and reign with him but he cannot let you rule and reign with him until you get character cuz character am man if you want to rule without character that's going to be just satanic you're going to abuse that but if the spirit of Christ amen you you will have forgiveness you'll have love you have compassion that is the spirit he's trying to get out of you and he's only going to get that through things you're going to go through and the maturity to handle the spoken word where your signature is as good as his in the checkboard third pull fruit amen now that third pull fruit is something we need to always remember we hear all these things that are coming those that are well versed know what I'm saying you hear about you know giving the your your farmer the the rain and and speaking things and and whatever else and I mean sort of thing that is the third pull well just hang on a second that's the fruits of the third pool the third pool is laying inside of you brothers and sisters if you got that word that word God himself in you it's laying there the seeds are there and at the appointed time God will use it he just wants you to be ready when the time is right you don't have to force it the the fruit will come out Amen in its way and how it should be so may the Lord help us to focus on the right thing let's just see some scriptures had so beautiful when you look at it though he were a son so yes though he were a son though we are Sons and Daughters of God yet learned he obedience by what the things which he suffered and that's why I said brothers and sisters we have no choice as Christians to know we will have to suffer but there's a purpose amen it's not just for fun is a purpose and what being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto them that obey him us that follow can have the same amen being made perfect for it became him for whom are all things about whom are um for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified are all one we the same category brother and sisters for which cause he is not ashamed to call you Brethren brothers and sisters bride of Christ amen so you have to understand brothers and sisters you will always have a sticky nature you will have thorns in the flesh you're not going to get rid of you know that can hit you sometimes it's hard it can it can blind you because you're so determined that I must form this perfect picture but it's not like that you have to look beyond that amen the prophet l some beautiful things here we would we would known it today is the law of conscious and where there is good there is evil where there's right there is wrong and we will never no matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourself from the presence of either because Paul said when I would do good evil is present amen so we're never going to get away from that and you can see Paul in Romans 7 getting so frustrated when I do good do EV I want to do this and then this happens you can see it builds up and builds up and eventually is like oh Wretched Man that I am who can deliver me from this flesh man he's frustrated as we get frustrated but then he answers it in pretty much the next verse but I thank God through Jesus Christ there's an answer laying right there we need to get ourselves out of the way amen and let him amen take over us I love pictures that I think brother Randon paints such a beautiful picture here how can I take a cockabur and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that Cocker has been transmitted from a cockabur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cockabur and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the cckar and the life of the cockabur has been taken out but the nature of the cockabur is sticky oh I don't want to hear this well you're hearing it sorry to say and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth there is no more cockabur but wheat but while it's here on Earth amen out of the earth and a Cocker it's still sticky but it's got the nature of on the inside of it of Wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you and that's where you need to focus you're born again amen and you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all your sin has gone from you amen isn't that beautiful amen so you're going to have a cockabur and yes our job is to get rid of as many of those cockabur leaves as we possibly can while you're on Earth amen and we need God's help but you'll still have a portion of cockabur even if you get a rid of 99% of it until that Rapture goes you'll have a bit of cockabur on you so don't worry about it don't worry about your little mistakes he's looking for your reaction to the mistake not so much the mistake what is the re action is it excuses oh I had a right or is it Lord forgive me I didn't mean that I'm sorry oh that's my child and maybe five minutes later he does the same thing but his attitude's right Lord I'm so sorry I'm just trying forgive me that's my child this is my boy you see it's not about how perfect you can be but it's about making sure you just have the right spirit and attitude when you do make mistakes and then he can help you now I know brother bam at one stage alludes to what uh uh Paul's Thorn In the Flesh was and it was that his eyes he was struggling with his eyes now this is fascinating when you see this because if you understand this whole situation you can maybe get an idea of how hard it is sometimes to accept your Thorn In the Flesh to understand how hard it is to accept this this flesh part that you veiled in cuz Paul lays it out real good unless I should be exalted above measure and that's why God will leave thorns in your flesh and let you have a bit of cockabur cuz he knows your human nature is going to turn on you real quick because it's just we are like that unfortunately as much as we don't want to be we find ourselves very quickly get puffed up and we have to be get back down get on your knees that's where you belong through the abundance of Revelations CU sure brother Paul had had amazing Revelations I mean he wrote most wrote most of the New Testament but the Paul was an incredible amen prophet of that age there was given to me a thorn of the In the Flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me now that Buffet you got in the original man it's not just like it's strike with the fist mild treat treat with violence that's what that that buff it means it's not nice it's not easy the devil throws you around like a ragd doll sometimes because you can imagine Paul Lord you know I'm your messenger right yes brother Paul You're My Messenger but Lord I'm I'm really struggling I'm trying to write letters to the different churches I'm struggling to see I keep having to I'm writing over my letters and I'm having to keep correcting it's just a mess I feel sorry for the churches having to receive my letters please can you take it away for your honor and Glory I'm doing this for you um no Lord I mean they I had to rewrite this page five times yesterday get I'm really struggling to see I I can't figure things out and I'm feeling the bubble in my heart but I can't get it down on paper quick enough please can you just heal my eyes it's for your honor and glory Lord I'm doing it for you a service to you no and again the says he asked him three times no but Lord no that's hard brothers and sisters when you're doing something for God and he says no I'll leave that infirmity I'll leave that thorn upon you that's difficult brothers and sisters but he's looking for character what is your reaction when you don't get it what are you going to do about it Lord even though I will trust you am but look at Paul's attitude I love this amen and this if you to take this to a School of Psychology they'll say man this guy's he's he I don't know if he's even medication to help this guy he's too far over the edge amen but look what he says here it's incredible because he can see what what the Lord was trying to show him so yes Buffett he's been hit by Satan violently lest I should be exalted above measure so he understands his nature even though he's a great prophet he realizes hey I've got a problem you have God you know God lets everything come my way for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice three times that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee why for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I rather Glory man this is where PA you going way out of the norm I rather glory in my infirmities that infirmities is a lack of strength weakness sickness both spiritually and in the physical body but Lord I I believe in my healing I've been praying for my healing for 10 years it's your word Lord I believe your word what if he says no what are you going to say are you going to keep the right spirit and still believe that he's still the Healer amen that is difficult brothers and sisters but he's as I said we call to a higher place in this time it's no longer just average Christian Living and just getting through life it's about taking possession of who you are and understanding and understanding is trying to get a character out of you that irrespective of your circumstances that you say your word is true whether I receive it or not it's truth that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I will pleasure in infirmities in reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake sake for when I am weak then I am strong because if you can just realize that if you can just get out the way brothers and sisters God can use you so mightily all the examples through the scripture yay look at Moses man comes out 40 years old man this guy has got it together he's trained up in the Army he has it all together to get the Israelites out of there out of Egypt but God says nope can't use this guy let's send him to the back side of the desert oh and he's got a temper so let me just give him a wife while I'm at it that's got a maybe a worse temper than him and things weren't so Rosy on the back side of the desert amen you can imagine for Moses at times amen but yeah the fact is that God wanted to get a character out of Moses that eventually said Lord I can't even speak this wife you gave me she's I don't have words anymore I'm I'm done I'm done oh wow I could use you Moses good job hey good job sapora you did what I needed now I can use this man and God will do the same but the brah shows a place he says you know we start say oh this woman this wife well maybe that woman that wife is exactly what God gave you to keep you humble and on your knees and vice versa so yeah you might think uh you know you're going to get the right one on the other side but the right one is sitting right next to you so yes let us let us let us just say Lord hey let me be used of you amen for when I'm weak then I am strong then I can be used of you because this little mind so quickly gets high and up there it's just so quick it happens man and you find yourself in places you could just never thought you could get so quickly but but we need to focus on the Lord amen and get our things around away from us you know the current picture of the Bride is so beautifully paralleled with Esther do you know the the some of the first Messengers they they even thought Esther should even be in the Bible because it doesn't even talk hardly about God doesn't even talk about God doesn't mention it it's just like a story yeah but then you go into the original and you see man this was prophetic this was what the bride would be going through think about it Esther is born in a foreign land are we in a foreign land brothers and sisters of course we are we just so jous she's a nothing and a nobody she doesn't have parents she's living with her cousin suddenly this person like the beggar is shot up to a possible candidate for the queen out of nowhere not long after that she is the queen crowned wow but as much as I'm sure Esther was sort of starting to realize she had power because she can call servants and they can do this you know what I see something there with Esther that she still doesn't understand who she is definitely not because when the crisis comes that she hears that her people are possibly going to become extinct and wiped out she gets fearful she's please let's call her fast pray three days we need a consecrate I I'm going to most probably die and he has Esther walking in the presence of the King after 3 days just praying and begging just to say Esther I will not kill you or something to that effect imagine this the shock when she hears Esther my beloved King what do you want up to half my kingdom did I hear right yeah up to half my kingdom me I just was hoping I would survive and that's the reality sometimes you know we caught to queenship brothers sisters but yet we just try to survive sometimes and then I can't help but Wonder yeah we we know that there was a reason but when she calls the king to the the feast and she you know I wonder did she lose did she just she did she she what did they say you lost you lost guts or what is the word I'm looking for but you sort of you lose your composure whatever it is that she she couldn't actually address it at first that she says uh can you please come rather tomorrow night and and you wonder why Esther yes we knew there's a purpose and the King had to the scroll that night and you know we know how what played out but the fact of the matter is from Esther's perspective why did you not just there and then address it why did you have to say Lord can you come again tomorrow night I want like another Feast maybe just Esther doesn't know who she is she doesn't know her position does it sound familiar hey it sounds familiar to me yeah because when I see myself sometimes I don't quite get how much God loves me how much he's given to me how I'm joint a Ester bride up to half my kingdom joint a with me we're going to March back through to eternity together Esther then you know what happened that's so beautiful brothers and sisters you know what we doubt the power we hold within us because you know what happened when Esther reveals the situation the King was what does he do he gives his Signet his ring that bears his Mark and says yeaha do with it as you want and Esther herself not the king Esther herself defeated the enemy cuz she had the power now of the king in Earth amen and the same brothers and sisters with us the power lies within you you can get over that bad habit you can destroy that enemy in your life amen he's given you the power you just have to be humble and subject yourself to him amen hallelujah I'm closing off you let's trust the process amen look at how high the stakes are brother and sisters in this quote but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride you are the special lady how this is what I want you to understand oh sorry Hull is against this truth I think you need to let that sink in hell is desperately trying to make sure you don't understand who you are remember the stakes are high brothers and sisters as we get into the end Satan knows his time is limited he's using every single resource he knows to try and disturb you and not get you to understand who you are he's all outgoing full out Force like calling all the troops forward hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery the second-fastest is are raging hold fast I am his and he'll be made manifest through me that's her stand but listen this is where we have to be sober minded brothers and sisters cuz look what the prophet says here why do you hunger church that's the question why do you thirst cuz there's something there I believe as I was preaching to you not you feeling something hey man I want to be this I want to live up to this it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but yeah we have to be sober minded but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor some of you been hurt and Disturbed spiritually by men of God make no mistake you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation the last day is here Lord help us Lord help us this is serious brother sisters we have a the biggest war is Raging than ever before it's the stakes have never been this High and and Satan is desperate to Blind you he's desperate to distract you he's desperate to get things in your life to just keep you know blind you but you have to be take the time to get in his presence and how do you get in his presence brother and sisters through prayer put on a tape well we don't listen to tapes put on a message through your iPhone or whatever it is allow yourself in the presence unless you get in the presence of God you'll never hear him say Esther up to half my my kingdom is yours Esther had to first get in the presence of the king before she could hear and he could speak to her and tell her value back to her you're going to have to do it and you're going to have to just find the time sacrifice if you have to of course we still humans we still have to live through life we still have to have enjoyments we're not stopping that stuff but be fair to God also give him some time amen make sure you consecrate certain things to him don't put like the the prophet says you the cares of the world your family other things don't let it get blind and it's you and God forget about the rest I'm going to end with this scripture and we done I love the scripture I absolutely love it because this is actually what is happening look what the words is yeah it's beautiful but we are with an open faced unveiled amen if you can just see what he is seeing so you are the bride amen and what are you doing you beh holding as in a glass if you go to the original that's not a glass you can see through it's a mirror that reflects back so you are the bride amen and you're looking into a mirror imagine this think spiritually now you're looking into a mirror what is coming back at that mirror what are you seeing back in that mirror that's reflecting it is the glory of the Lord you don't see that you don't feel that but if you could have a spiritual window a mirror this evening and be able to see into it you would see God shining back at you all changed this is where we are at the moment cuz this is a process you're changed you're being transformed into the same image what you seeing in that mirror you are being changed in the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the Lord if you want to be changed from glory to glory you're going to have have to look in the mirror and this mirror amen is is one that is always going to help you to understand who you are amen we need to start becoming maybe a little bit more disciplined and as I say it's not about legalism it's about a love relationship and if you can just fall in love with him naturally something is going to want you to get into his presence because when you in your his presence you'll see God reflected back at you amen may the Lord help us all we all are struggling the minister behind this desk the pastor sitting in the Pew is also struggling we have our doubts we have our times where we just we we question as as Paul question Lord why can't you but if we can just see the bigger picture that the Lord is trying to get a character out of you he's trying to get you to the place where you know who you are that you know your position and then we're out of here brothers and sisters hey I want to get out of here brothers sisters this world is not my home amen and the more I'm in it the more it just doesn't feel comfortable may the Lord help us all at this time is our prayer amen you may be may just bow your heads amen at this time amen I believe this is opportunity just to be real honest with the Lord amen this is not the time to for the these and the THS where God is far away he's become a friend he's become a lover he's part of you you can speak to him literally like your best best friend as Frank as you want as honest as you want don't you want to just be honest with the Lord tonight and say Lord you know what I don't I don't quite feel it I don't I don't quite know it Lord I know you've got all these promises in the word and I see that I'm the second fold purpose and the Batton is with me but Lord I I just don't seem to know how to run with it I don't seem to know how to handle it I seem like I'm
