Father Moses, [Music] Moses, we also have a prayer request here, brother. Um so any other unspoken prayer request, but we also have one that says, "Please pray for Justin who has been battling with a sore back." So Justin who has been battling with a sore back and is particularly sore this morning. So just pray for his full healing. Thank you brotherise. &gt;&gt; Now we bow our heads for prayer. Our dear heavenly father, we just want to thank you this morning. Thank you Lord for the love you have given us which you always show to us. Father we approach you father.

And thank you, Father, for working at our hearts to come here, Father, to worship you, Lord. Father, many are our requests. And here we have Father Brother Jason battling Heavenly Father Pake. Heavenly Father, we've been born to be children of the most high God. And heavenly father, we have been given authority to put the wicked one under our feet. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, we claim our healing which you have already done on the cross of Calvary. We don't have heavenly father any complex father in claiming it and proclaiming victory because we know you have already done it my lord. Father we thank you. May you bless our time of singing, Lord. Father, may the angels of heaven come down and sing together with us, Lord, even to the preaching of the word. We thank you, my master.

Praise the Lord. Wonder if we can take our seats just for a moment. I would like to welcome all all our visitors this morning and of course welcome all our local folks too. trust that trust that each one will feel welcome in the presence of the Lord this morning and that we can give him full preeminence and just really coming with excitement this morning to fellowship around the word. We've had a very special weekend so far. Um Friday night's youth service was very very applicable, very special and again last night the brothers meeting so many very good things that were spoken. So just really excited about today. Trust trust that we come with our cups held out. Come that we trust we come with expecting hearts and prayed up and ready to receive everything that the Lord has for us. So I want to also say thank you for for those of you who made effort to come from from distance and all our visitors. I I already greeted you but I want to also say thank you for the effort that you've made to to come. Um, also, Brother Joe, he's um he's well, probably half of us know him by now because he's had uh the youth service and the brothers meeting, but um it's um I've only met him face to face for uh for the first time on Thursday. We had a a brief discussion a little while ago on on a video call. Um but um it's just been a real pleasure to to meet him and his vision and his perspective with the word and so on. Just really appreciate those things. So it's it's been really special so far. Um I uh Oh, the other important thing is that um he's not brother Joel, he's brother Joel. I remember Joel Joel Gala. So, it's the French part and you will definitely hear a little bit of the the French accent, although I must say his English is very good. He actually um runs a a language school. He's the CEO of a language school also as his day job. So, um he he's able to to speak English pretty good. Pretty good. So, anyway, praise the Lord. Um just a reminder that we have a evening service at 4:30 or late afternoon service at 4:30 this afternoon. Everyone is welcome again. Um and church lunch after after the service at the war memorial hall. Um everyone is welcome to join us. And I also say a little ahead of time um brother Joel is here on Wednesday night.

So, I'm fully following sister Kathy there making sure that she's, you know, on the straight and narrow. So, brother Michael has asked me to come over just for the weekend to uh to preach some services. Um, two more things I would like to just just briefly say. So, um, brother Adrian is leaving for Indonesia this afternoon. So, what I would like to do now is that we uh that we just lay hands on him and commit him to the Lord for the trip also. So, so maybe brother Adrian if you can come um and then as always any brothers that want to come and pray with us please come up and then we can just lay hands on our brother as we commit him to the Lord. Um but as he's coming also um I've been sharing with you the things that we're doing and and also um brother Mahan and them they're building a church building at the moment um and we've also donated um quite extensively to that fund um there. So, brother Aen is taking that money across also with him. Um, so just as a matter of a little bit of feedback on on our mission work. So, those of you who want to come up, don't be shy. Just gather gather around. Our most precious and loving heavenly father. Our God, we are privileged to be gathered in your house this morning. Father, we come to receive from you. Oh Lord Jesus, we pray you forgive our weaknesses, our humanness, shortcomings, our internal turmoils and mind battles and things. Father, I pray that you'll forgive those things and wash us clean with your precious blood. You've paid that price 2,000 years ago in Calvary, Father. Lord, we want to just dedicate the service again to you, Father. Pray that you will have your way. Oh God, you knew before the foundation of the world that we're going to gather here today. And I pray that you will achieve exactly your perfect will today. Father, I lift brother Joel before you again. Pray that you will use that vessel for your glory. Father God, I pray for each one of us, Lord, that we will have no walls up, no barriers, Lord Jesus, no opinions, no fears, no theology, no humanness that gets in the way, Father. Lord, I pray that you will achieve your purpose this morning and also this evening, Father. Lord, we're also gathering now to commit Brother Adrian um to you for this trip, Lord Jesus. We pray that you will keep him healthy. We pray that you will keep him safe. We pray that you will give him safe travels, Lord, oh Father. And we pray that you will anoint this vessel, that you will give him godly wisdom and inspiration for every circumstance that he may face. every time that someone may draw on the gift, Father, that you will be there to anoint it, Father, and that you will give the right answers, you will give the right guidance, that you will show the right attitudes, Father, that your life will be on display through this vessel, Lord. Father, I pray that you'll give him the strength for for the services, Lord, also where it's summer season there and really hot sometimes. Father, I pray that you will help him through those things, too. Father, we commit him to you in every way, Father, and bring him back safely with a good testimony of what you've done, Lord. We appreciate you, Lord. And we ask these things in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank you, brothers. Praise the Lord. So let's just sing a song as uh brother Joel come up. [Music] We are able to go up and take the country to possess the land from Jordan to the sea. Though the giants may be their way to he, God will surely give the victory. Sons of God Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. forward in the power of the Savior's name. Amen. Amen. Praise God. May God bless you all this morning. And uh maybe you could be seated for just a moment because uh just before we jump into the word, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and uh each time people say I work in the linguistic sector. as they introduce me, they put the pressure on me uh to speak very good English, which is still a second language. But uh yeah, so I I I just uh want to share with you how I truly believe God wanted me to be with you this weekend. Um, and that there are many reasons for this and and the first one is really I'm just a nobody &gt;&gt; and I truly mean it. I uh I just I just pastor a very small church that we've planted two years ago out of Quebec, Canada. And um yeah, I don't I don't know very many people and I don't travel really. And uh when brother Al called me, I would have said no like straight up to this invitation to go around the world and leave my family behind and the church and the business and all that that goes with it and and and to be here, I would have said no. But God had other plans and just to make sure these plan these plans would happen, he uh he gave me a vision about a week beforehand. I was in church on a Friday night for prayer meeting and as we went for prayer, I went in the front pew to kneel to pray and as soon as I knelt and I and closed my eyes, I just saw very strange vision. I uh if anyone of you ever had an experience of this type, you know how rattling it is. It is not a u very comfortable experience. We hear about them but you just see an image and then you feel an emotion but then you don't know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You think you know, you wonder. So at night I couldn't even get to sleep and my beloved wife uh told handed me a notebook and a pen and she said you should write it down with the dates and details and and so I wrote it down and and really in summary very quick I saw the the earth like I was in the atmosphere and there was some kind of arrow going around the earth and I knew this arrow was me and my stomach was very tight instantly as I had this vision but one week later brother already called me and actually I believe fulfilled that vision uh by inviting me and so um I am very happy to be here even though it's out of my comfort zone and I trust we uh will be blessed together &gt;&gt; this weekend as we have already been those who have been the uh the youth meeting or the men's meeting yesterday and today will be a two-part series and really including Wednesday, we could almost call it a three-part series, but um just maybe a little background about our church. We planted a church in a new city where there's no message church. And and um when we started off, there was 22 of us. It it was about a year and a half ago, a little over a year and a half ago. and and uh now there's over 55 of us and God has really just been blessing. You know, there are two ways of building a church. You do you either build God's kingdom or you build a man's kingdom. And uh and I mean get me right here. Every Christian has a right to choose a church to call home. But often times new churches are built on the back of old churches. It's not conversion, it's translation sometimes. And uh but we have been blessed to baptize new converts off the street. Just last week was our family camp and we went camping and we baptized three new converts uh in the lake. Actually, it was just a amazing moment. And so, uh, Jesus said when he was here, I will build my church. And so, we are not building nothing, but really we're just vessels and tools that that he uses. And uh, he is building his church. And so, we we are living a little revival in Quebec. So, keep us in our prayer in in your prayers uh, about this little work that uh, that has started and that is growing. And we pray that it Jesus always stays at the center of it and it always uh stays about &gt;&gt; God's kingdom and never becomes a man kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just maybe stand up to read a scripture. So by the grace of God this morning we we will mostly uh paint a canvas for tonight. Uh and so we will lay a foundation and and hopefully be able to uh kind of close it tonight. Don't worry, I'm not a long-wided preacher. I uh won't keep you long. We'll be out for for lunch. Exodus chapter 3 starting from verse one. Exodus 3 verse 1-6. Moses. Now, Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed. Then Moses said,"I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush does not burn." So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called him from the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here I am." Then he said, "Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground." M more Moreover, he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Let's pray. Father, this is not about me. This is all about you this morning. So may you take me out of the way and just speak to our hearts and give us Lord this morning humility to receive these words in a humble heart for your word says that you resist the prideful at heart. Lord may you be with us this morning and may you speak to us and help us understand your plans and your ways. We commit yourself in this meeting into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. And so lately, God started really revealing to me um and it really blesses me. He started revealing to me how the types in the Bible they must apply across the board from top to bottom from Christ to our personal lives. Um, yes, God has a great purpose, Christ and his bride, but there is also the local church and there is also the families and then there is the individual and and every type in the Bible triggers down and applies to every level. If we are guilty of looking at the Bible only from 20,000 ft, only looking at the big picture and seeing, you know, for example, how Moses is a type of Christ, which he is, we are missing on uh so much goodness we could draw from the Bible for our own actual lives. And um and so God is starting to show me that the these types they they apply to Christ in his church. They apply to the local church. They apply to our families. They apply to our personal lives as individuals. And um you know these these stories we read in the Bible, they are not stories. In fact, they are living today. &gt;&gt; They're not just stories. they have to come out of the book and and come to life once more in our lives. &gt;&gt; And so my my topic for this morning I called the church of Midian. The church of Midian. And we'll get back to it a little later because I want to just uh lay a foundation. And so we all know Moses is a type of Christ. Yeah. But the types must also apply to the church, to the family, to the individual. And and the word of God is an infinite source of wisdom and counsel and light. &gt;&gt; And it discerns the intentions and the thoughts of the heart. &gt;&gt; It does, and I pray it will do this morning and tonight especially. And uh I must warn you that I am a straightforward preacher. And uh I I sure hope to make some friends in New Zealand, but I didn't come to make some friends. I came to represent the kingdom &gt;&gt; and to preach the truth that God has laid on my heart. And truly, I got here unprepared. meaning uh uh I I used to when I I traveled a couple times in the past 5 years and I used to prepare 3 months in advance when I knew I was going to preach somewhere just to feel secure about it and then stay up all night the night before service to try to reprepare what God is laying on my heart and and then battle between preaching something really prepared and something you've just had on your heart and so I came to New Zealand unprepared but ready to really follow the leading of the Holy Ghost and and um and so this morning I want to speak and tonight as well of an exodus and and we believe there are three exodus right everything is perfect in three and and now we know about the first exodus Moses bringing the people out of Egypt and and the second exodus is Christ taking the people out of the law and into grace, out of the slavely the slavery of Judaism into the liberty in Christ. And here's what the prophet says. He says, "The Holy Spirit in the form of a pillar of fire. God coming down in coming down in manifestation brought out the first exodus uh brought Israel out of Egypt. The second exodus was Christ bringing the church out of Judaism, out of the law. And I'm afraid this second exodus uh is one not many Christians have walked. Not many Christians have walked out of the law and into grace. Yeah. You go around in churches and you just see how the law is still in effect in most churches. But uh when we look at Paul formerly Saul, you know, he was the chief Judaist, he um but how did he get out of it really? Have you ever wondered how um Paul get got out of Judaism? Was it, you know, fighting with Peter in a theological debate? Or was it fighting over quotes and trying to make a point or no? It was when you met God face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is when everything changed. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. And the Bible says that with God there is no variation of or shadow of turning. This is what the Bible says. And so indeed the way it happened the first time is the way it will happen every time. That is a key to the Bible. In the seven churches book, the prophet says the key that God gave me is that God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; This is a key. Everybody's trying to present to us a God that changes his ways and his plans, but he doesn't. And so the first and second Exodus, we can find so many similarities because they are the same. You see, in this first Exodus, like we've just read, it started to take place when Moses met the pillar of fire, right? &gt;&gt; The second Exodus started to take place when Paul met &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire. Moses taking the people out of Egyptian slavery. I mean, God did it. God says, "I remembered my people." But he did it using Moses, right? And Paul taking the people out of the slavery of the law. Christ did it. He died on the cross. But really, even after Christ's death and resurrection, we see how Peter is still in Judaism. &gt;&gt; But then Paul meets God face to face. He meets with a pillar of fire and then he starts taking the whole church as a first church messenger out of the slavery of law. Moses a former Egyptian Paul &gt;&gt; formerly in Judaism. &gt;&gt; It's funny how God works. E &gt;&gt; but there's a third Exodus &gt;&gt; and there's a third coming as well. you know that everything is perfect in three but this morning I want to speak uh just a little about the third exodus because we we believe we live in the days of the third exodus but uh I'm afraid we haven't walked the ex this exodus yet many of us and let's see what this exotus is about I won't spend long on it because I know you know it but there it is and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people, lest lest you share in our sins and lest you receive of our plague. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One last voice crying and one last Exodus. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if God is the same, we can study the past exodus to understand where we stand right now. &gt;&gt; And we should. If we live in the days of an Exodus, then we know we need to know what our Egypt is. &gt;&gt; We need to know what our desert is. We need to know what our promised land is. &gt;&gt; Now, God bringing Israel out of Egypt is a first exodus. But uh when the prophet Joel spoke about our time, he he he prophesied I will restore Sea the Lord. And and this work of restoration is really what takes place as this third third exodus is happening. And it's a work of getting back to the original. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so in a way the modern Exodus started back in 1520 when Luther got out of the Catholic Church. When Luther got out of Babylon by faith believing the promise, something started to take place. and to not and to this morning rather I'm I'm I'm used to preaching at night. So I might say tonight a couple of times this morning remembering that the types must apply at every level. I would I would love this morning to compare Luther coming out of Rome of Babylon to Abraham coming out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Both of them by faith One of whom or to whom the unconditional promise was made and one accepting the promise and rejecting the law and the works and accepting the fact that it is unconditional by grace through faith. Now Abraham is at the genesis of the first exodus. He is Abraham didn't walk the exodus out of Egypt. But if there is an exodus out of Egypt, it's because he is the one whom God made the promise to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Your people shall sojourn in a strange land for 400 years, but I will bring them out &gt;&gt; is the promise God gave to Abraham. I will deliver them and bring them into my promised land. And now we could take every step, every every step and every story from Abraham, Isaac, Isu and Isu and Jack, Jacob and Joseph and draw types out of every one of them. &gt;&gt; But but we don't have time this morning, but I just pray someone will be inspired to do so. Not because there's so much in there, but here is what I want us to realize this morning. There was a people that was the seed of Abraham and that people sojourned in Egypt for 400 years before their exodus to promised land. This is the first exodus, right? In the second exodus, same thing. Same thing. Malachi came about 400 years before Christ and carried the promises and prophecies of the Messiah while the people were sinking or falling into Roman and Jewish slavery, boat slaveries, Judaism and Romanism. And then they were without a prophet for 400 years. Captive of Judaism and captive of the Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to remember this for later. &gt;&gt; They were in a twin captivity. &gt;&gt; This is very important. We need to remember this for later. They were in a twin captivity to Judaism and to the Roman Empire. And now in the third exodus, it must be the exact same. &gt;&gt; As Luther is walking out of Babylon, &gt;&gt; 400 years &gt;&gt; before the Exodus, &gt;&gt; the people stay in denominational slavery for 400 years. &gt;&gt; And then this brings us to a big question this morning. What is our Egypt? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we cannot walk an exodus out of something if we don't know what that thing is. &gt;&gt; What are we called out of? &gt;&gt; And this third exodus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we have to know that we are called out of three things. &gt;&gt; We do have to walk the three exodus. &gt;&gt; And that is maybe what we'll be talking in depth tonight, walking the three exodus. Just in summary, we have to walk out of the slavery of the things of the world. &gt;&gt; We have to walk out of the slavery of the law. &gt;&gt; And we have to walk out of the slavery of the religious system. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. Maybe we'll have time to touch more on this tonight, but I want to read this so we really get I want everybody on the same page this morning. We need to know what our Egypt is. &gt;&gt; This is so important. &gt;&gt; I've heard 25 different answers about what our Egypt is. But let's see what Barraham says. Now, God is that message of repentance to the church nominal. God is in that message of divine healing to the church Pentecostal. God is in the message to the bride. See, so we find out that all of them calling one to this, this to that, and that to that. Three Exodus. God calling the church out of the world, calling the church, the denominational church into Pentecost and calling the bride out of Pentecost. Here brother Abraham is telling us that the Egypt of the third exodus is Pentecostalism. If we are bride, if we are walking called to walk this third exodus, we are called out of pent Pentecostalism. Now we need to know and understand clearly what our Egypt is. Our Egypt is Pentecostalism. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of Pentecostalism, Christ calls a bride to an exodus, to a promised land. &gt;&gt; So this is the 1 million buck question. Are you in the promised land? Are we in the promised land? Are we still in Egypt? Are we in the desert? Where are we? H. Where are we at? And I have a serious reason to ask this question. &gt;&gt; Very serious reason. And the reason is the the last couple of years I noticed a trend. Now I realize that I flew across the whole world to be here. And so sometimes, you know, um trends may differ from one part of the country to the other, but really I believe there's just one God, but there's also one enemy. &gt;&gt; And he is not, you know, he's not very uh very um what you say? He he always does the same tricks. He's not very imaginative, you know, he's just but but at the same time these tricks work, right? So, and so I noticed u a trend in our ranks, in our churches, and that trend is that people are looking for sensationalism, sensations. People are getting hyped about Pentecostals behaviors. Again, &gt;&gt; there's like a a form of going back &gt;&gt; to &gt;&gt; Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; I see a movement of of returning back to Pentecostalism. And I talked with many pastors mainly across the Americas. Yes. But there is a real movement towards Pentecostalism's gifts and miracles and shouting and speaking in tongue and prophesying and casting out demons and and in our rank people want sensationalism. People want strong emotions and they want the trill. It seems we lack the trill. They want excitement. Well, I I've preached many youth camps. This is what I mostly accept to travel for. And and I've noticed among the youths, there is that thirst. They they want to experience strong emotions and and trill and and they they just they want to scream and shout and and they want a Pentecostal message. &gt;&gt; They want what brother Abraham calls the message of divine healing. And uh this is a very personal topic to me because a little over two two years ago I left a very formal church that I was born and raised in to plant a church in a new area. And uh but I found myself in a position all of a sudden after over 30 years of what we could call being satisfied &gt;&gt; with the formal way of doing church. I found myself in a position or a state where I was searching for miracles, where I wanted to see spiritual gifts and miracles and and I wanted to see the miracles of the days of William Brham. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt like that? &gt;&gt; I want to see the miracles of the days of William Brham. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I went out looking for them. And do you know where I found them? in the Pentecostal church. Stay seated for a while. It's going to make sense in a moment. Stay calm. We're going somewhere. As I was on a quest for sensationalism, someone sent me a testimony from well TL Osborne. Ever heard of him? TL Osborne. He was an oldtime shouting Pentecostal. And he was in brother Brandham's meeting and brother Bham prayed to cast the spirit out of a person. But really what brother Brandham did is just he spoke simple words very quietly. &gt;&gt; Satan leave her body &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; And then brother said it's over sister. you're healed. You're delivered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And TL said, "Wait a minute. We haven't even started shouting yet. &gt;&gt; This can't possibly be. We haven't even started feeling emotions and and and you know, the thrill of casting the devil and the screaming. Nothing happened. She can't be already delivered." And that night listening to that testimony, I realized that God had so much more in store for me than shouting and sensationalism. &gt;&gt; God has had so much more in store than the message of divine healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I went to study the word and I wanted to understand why why that desire was all of a sudden raising in me to see something sensational or supernatural like I can't manufacture it. All of a sudden that desires like took life inside of me. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Where does that come from? Would you like to know why? It's because I had just met God face to face and that woke me out of my sleep. I was a sleeping Christian for 30 years. But when I met God face to face, that woke me out of my my sleep and that put me into action. And now I want to I want to ask this question this morning about Moses. Where did God meet Moses face to face? H where did God where did Moses met God face to face? It's in the church of Midian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember we have to see ourselves as individuals in the types of the Bible. And you see, Moses, just like me, and maybe just like most of us, was raised by a Christian mother. &gt;&gt; She taught him about the promise. She taught him about God, but Moses also received an education from Egypt. He received a godly education from his mother, &gt;&gt; but a worldly education from Egypt. &gt;&gt; Moses, like us, he had a call upon his life. He had a part to play in God's economy. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he also had a hurtly calling. The world wanted to make him a king. Egypt offered him pleasures and wealth and so forth, &gt;&gt; right? And Moses was living a double life for a while. He was a double agent. He would go to the palace and enjoy the pleasures of Egypt. Then he would go visit his people and and just fellowship with them. And he lived this double life for a while until he got caught and confronted with his life. And that day he ran from Egypt. We could almost say that this is the actual first Exodus. Moses leaving Egypt for the first time. &gt;&gt; So Moses leaves Egypt. He runs from Egypt. Do you know where he's going? &gt;&gt; He's going to church. Moses lets go of his double life. He takes charge of his life. He finds a local church in Midian. He even marries the pastor's daughter. &gt;&gt; Moses starts a family in Midian. He gets a stable job in the family business. He goes to church every Sunday. He doesn't live the worldly life in the palace of Egypt anymore. Oh, no. He's a Christian now. His life is straight now. Moses is a good Christian now. He's a good man. He's a good husband. He's a good father. Praise God for Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's the son in love, the pastor of the church of Median. &gt;&gt; There's only one problem. Only one. Moses ran away from his calling in a religion. &gt;&gt; There's just one problem. He left his people behind. &gt;&gt; Everybody is suffering but him. &gt;&gt; Moses is not living in Exodus. Moses is in exile. He testifies of it when his firstborn uh his first child is born. He names him Gersam. I don't know how you say it in English, but &gt;&gt; Gersham, which means in exile in a strange land. This is the meaning of his firstborn's name. Moses is not in a in an exodus. He's in an exile. Every single one of his family members and people is backslid and slave in Egypt. But that doesn't bother him. Oh no. He lives he just lives this little Christian life. You very quiet Christian life. Everybody's backslid in Egypt. But he doesn't care. He left Egypt for a small church in Midian. And now he now has a wife and kids and a good job and he's just happy with his quiet Christian life. &gt;&gt; And I'm not speaking about Moses now. I'm speaking about the modern Christian running from Egypt in the church of Midian. I'm afraid most believers build a life, a godly life in a little church in Midian. They're living a quiet and religious life far from the plan of God for their life. Yes, they left distance of Egypt. Praise God. But they also left their family, their belongings and their privilege behind. 40 years. 40 years that Moses spent in the church of Midian doing work, sleep, repeat. How many people here are doing work, sleep, repeat? &gt;&gt; Taking care of his wife and taking care of the sheep of his father-in-law. He was even a co-pastor. He helped with the sheep. 40 years running from his calling. Running to a church in Midian while everybody is suffering back in Egypt. Moses had never met God yet. &gt;&gt; Oh, mentally, intellectually, he knew who he was. Mama don't tell him when he was young. But he had never met God face to face. &gt;&gt; But when he met God, when he did, God gave life to his commission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave him courage. &gt;&gt; God gave him two pulls. &gt;&gt; Power to get the job done. &gt;&gt; Miracle. Supernatural. Yes. And there he goes back to Egypt to take over. &gt;&gt; Before in Exodus, there will be an invasion, &gt;&gt; a one-man invasion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Contrary to all common sense or logic. Now that Moses met God face to face, he's going back to Egypt to take over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? because he wasn't called to an to an exile but to an exodus. And an exodus means we leave nobody behind. &gt;&gt; We bring everybody with us. Exodus means we leave nothing behind. We bring all that belongs to us and everything belonging to Egypt as well actually. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But oh, how many Christians have adopted the exile mentality, running from the world into a local church in Midian. They become Christian and they cut themselves from everybody from society almost. They close themselves from the outside world and become very self-centered. Self-center can include your family, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They live a life without privilege. They live a miserable Christian life on earth with waiting for heaven. I met Christian that long for death to go to heaven. I'm sure you've met some too. You meet a Christian. How are you, my brother? Oh, by the grace of God, I'm doing good. I work in the linguistics. Do you want me to translate it? &gt;&gt; My life is a mess, but I'm not allowed to tell. &gt;&gt; Oh, by the grace of God. Which grace? &gt;&gt; I I was at coffee with a brother once and I asked him, "Are you brother?" He says, "Oh, it's the grace of God if I'm still breathing or if I'm breathing." Something like that. And and he looks very depressed. And I just happened to turn my head and I see the casher, you know, the Tim Hortons. You guys don't have Tim Hortons here, but you should. Best coffee. I just happened to turn towards the the cashier and she's just smiling and happy. And so I tell the brother, "Look at the cashier. It's the grace of God if she's breathing too, &gt;&gt; but she doesn't even know it. And she's happier than you. living a life without privilege, &gt;&gt; a miserable Christian life on earth waiting for heaven. &gt;&gt; Come on, if somebody fits the description this morning, maybe you haven't met God face to face yet. Because when you meet God face to face, you receive power and your commission. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's no more it's no more about seeing someone with a great gift do miracles. &gt;&gt; It's about you yourself &gt;&gt; walking in the path that God has for you &gt;&gt; and redeeming your own people. &gt;&gt; You're called to redeem your people. &gt;&gt; It's not about the show anymore. It's not about sens sensationalism. It's about invasion and possession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Mark 16 becomes part of your life. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. And he who believes and is baptized will be saved, and he who does not who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe in my name. They will cast out demons. They will speak with new tongues. They will take up serpents. This is not for some gifted preacher to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. When you meet God, this is tools in your toolbox &gt;&gt; for invasion and possession. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is the for the believer who met God. &gt;&gt; But that's not what the modern Christians want. They want the pastor to invite someone with a great gift. Someone who can put on a show, someone who can prophesy or speak in tongue or cast devil demons out. They want a public show in the church. Miracles, power. There's a trend of going back to Pentecostalism. Christians today it seems they want to see the miracles of Janice and Jambbrris. &gt;&gt; Now get me right. I am not saying that if someone performs a miracle or casts out a demon he is Janice or Jamus. I could have said the miracles of Moses. The idea here is that the people want the trill. They want to see a gift in action and that thirst prove they don't yet possess the power for themselves. &gt;&gt; I want to make a strong statement tonight. In Egypt, the people were amazed and intrigued at the miracles performed by Moses. Yeah. And they all died in the wilderness &gt;&gt; and Moses died too. &gt;&gt; And our prophet died as well. &gt;&gt; But the people nowadays they require they require that their pastors be like the prophet. &gt;&gt; I mean we they require that their pastors be like the prophet. Therefore asking them to be impersonators. Janice and Jambress. &gt;&gt; The first and second Paul they were Egypt. &gt;&gt; This is the climax of this morning's service. The first and second pool are for Egypt. But everything is perfect in three. &gt;&gt; We are called &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the season in which we live to manifest the third pull &gt;&gt; which is the spoken word. When we are focused and amazed at the signs and wonders and when we are looking for them, it proves we are still in Egypt. But we are called to an exodus towards a promised land out of Pentecostalism and into the kingdom God promised us with the third pole. empower ourselves not for the show &gt;&gt; but for the work of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it will not be a public show. &gt;&gt; It will be a secret. &gt;&gt; And and it makes me think of the 10th vision. I mean the 10 vision doesn't exist anyways, but it's a three-part vision. We've called it the tent vision, but really it's a three-part vision, but Brother Brham, he's he's up there. He's not in the tent. He's up there. And there's a lovely gentleman, he says, taking the people by the hand and bringing them to the promised land, a secret chamber &gt;&gt; where they meet God face to face. &gt;&gt; And they get out. The lady, she gets out, she's healed. The vision doesn't show a great gift of prophecy or a great gift of healing healing the sister. It shows a humble minister &gt;&gt; bringing that sister the Christ &gt;&gt; and she's never the same. She gets back out of that secret chamber healed and totally changed. &gt;&gt; And then the angel told brother Brham, "You have to go there yourself." &gt;&gt; And then the angel left where he was and went in there. And Barabanam went in there too. And he said, "I cannot even tell you what it is, &gt;&gt; but it'll change your life forever." &gt;&gt; We are called to the promised land. For the promise is every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon, I have given you. You possess it. Walk by faith and possess the land. There was no need for the first and second pole in the promised land. &gt;&gt; There was no need for divine healing in the promised land. There was not even a need for a hospital or a nurse because nobody was getting sick or hurt even in battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are called to cross over the Jordan into the promised land. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what about the church in Midian? How about this little church and this little people, this little formal church where you could have your religion quietly? You know, we keep hearing about that church later on. You see, Moses was a member of that church for 40 years. He lost 40 years as a member of the church of Midian. And then while he's he's writing his commission and they are in a true Exodus, the people are. Here's what the Lord spoke to Moses. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Take vengeance on the Medidianites, for the children of Israel. Afterward, you shall be gathered to your people." So Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Medidianites to take vengeance for the Lord on Medidian." &gt;&gt; Vengeance for what? And so the people went and they battled Midian and they killed all the men, but they spared the woman. And just a little later, Moses said to them, "Have you kept all the woman alive?" A woman is a church &gt;&gt; in type, right? You know that &gt;&gt; a woman in the Bible is a church. That's right. &gt;&gt; Moses the prophet tells them, "Have you kept all the woman alive? Look, these woman caused the children of Israel through the council of Balam to trespass against the Lord in the incident of Por and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord." The church of Midian under the influence of Balam has seduced the children of God and caused them to trespass against the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even after they were really out of Egypt in an Exodus, Moses wasn't done dealing with the church of Midian yet. She was still opposing God's work and causing trouble as she was a tool in Satan's hand to hinder the children of God, hinder them from getting to the promised land. This is serious. And now I'm not talking about a church building because the Old Testament is literal and and uh for us it's a spiritual application. And you could be in the best church that this world this world has to offer and still be in the church of Midian. This church, this formal religious church where you can just live a quiet life for yourself and live out your religion away from God's plan and purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; It's a tool in the ends of our enemy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is &gt;&gt; it is we are not called to a quiet Christian life. We are called to be partakers of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Still the people spared her one more time. They went in Midian. They killed every man. They killed a lot of people but they spared the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, we cannot say anything against it. We have to respect the church. Oh, brother, be careful what you say about the church. She caused the children of God to be infidel. That's what I have to say against the church of Midian. Are there sons of God in the church of Midian? Yes, they need to meet God face to face. Are there sons of God in Egypt? Yes, they need an Exodus. &gt;&gt; And I want to ask you personally this morning as we close to you personally. I want to ask where are you? Are you in an Exodus or are you in exile? Are you in Midian? Are you in Egypt? Are you in the desert? Are you in the promised land? Are you with the ones on the on the shores of the Jordan building a camp to go back to Pentecostalism? building a camp to go back to Egypt. They stood there on the shores of the Jordan, building a camp to go back to Egypt. They were saying, "Everybody is dying in the desert. Do you miss the miracles of Egypt?" Really? Here's how it goes. Yeah, we speak about Egypt exodus promised land, but really I think if we're honest, our journey out of Egypt goes more like this. Egypt, exile, invasion back to Egypt. Because I met God in Midian, &gt;&gt; Exodus, desert, &gt;&gt; promised land. &gt;&gt; So, one last time as I'm closing, where are you personally on this chart? Are you in Egypt? Are you in exile? Are you on duty currently invading and possessing and leaving nobody behind? Are you in Exodus? Are you in the desert? Are you in the promised land? Lord willing, tonight we will speak more about the second and third Exodus and we will speak about the Jordan River. And you may have a lot of questions this morning as this meeting comes to a close. And uh maybe this sermon has raised a lot of questions in your minds. But I want you to know that was the goal. The goal was that this morning we challenge status quo. &gt;&gt; Enough with patting ourselves on the back. &gt;&gt; We're the bride. We're good. We're the best. Enough. &gt;&gt; Let us challenge others to go today and just, you know, meditate on these things this afternoon. Where am I, Lord? Am I in exile? Really? Have I left everybody I love behind, suffering? Am I living a Christian life without privilege? Have I met you face to face? Or is is my Christian life really intellectual? Oh, I know who I am. My mother taught me. Oh, I've listened to so many tapes. I know I'm the bride. Yeah, you know it here. But what about here? By the grace of God, I pray tonight we will have more answers. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father God, thank you for this people you have gathered this morning. Your people, sincere people. and for the words you have spoken this morning. These words were hard words, but Lord, may you, however they were pronounced, may you help, help us just take these words into our hearts. All of us came here this morning with a different path and a different situation, a different condition, a different state of mind. But whatever the need was this morning, and no matter the words that were spoken, may you fulfill the need of those who made a sacrifice to be here. May you speak to their hearts and may your spirit indwell them and prepare us tonight &gt;&gt; for tonight's service and that we may be ready to hear more from you and to really position ourselves scripturally and help us to be humble and willing to change, willing to move, willing to repent. Lord, may someone this morning meet you face to face. If someone haven't met you face to face yet, this cannot wait. But give them a thirst and manifest yourself for them individually that they may see you face to face and and leave a different person than the way they came in. give life to their purpose and commission that they may be partakers of the kingdom. It's my prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Musicians Yep. In your presence. Let's stand up as we sing. [Music] I want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me, where my feet are on the rock.

Just really excited and we I just thank the Lord for his for his wonderful blessings. Amen. I'm uh I'm just going to close in a word of prayer and then hand over to mana just to sing a couple of songs as we dismiss. Let's just pray one more time. Father, we thank you Lord.

Father, please meet those who haven't met you yet. Lord, thank you for your word. God, I pray that you will bring us together again tonight. And Father, I pray that we will, Lord, just have another opportunity, Father, to bathe in your presence, to hear your word and to grow and to be drawn closer to you, Father, for you to continue to reveal your secrets to your bride, Lord.

Um it's 4:30 the meeting for uh the second meeting, but obviously there's a lunch after this as well. our heavenly father. Lord, it's Lord, we're so thankful, Lord God, for sharing to us as well what you have. Share to us, Lord God, this this um morning and Lord, we look forward to this evening, Lord, for what you have in store for us. and Lord, but we're also so thankful, Lord Jesus, just to see, Lord God, that you can take a minister from the other side of the world, Lord, and from his own account, having a a fellowship, a small fellowship, Lord, not a big name or anything like that, Lord. And you can work and say the same things, Lord, of what you've been saying to us for the last few weeks, Lord. And Lord, we're humbled by it, Lord, to know, Lord God, that Lord, that you work on this, Lord, the same page with your believers worldwide. And Lord, it's not because we are amazing of some sorts, Father, Lord, but Lord, you're the one in charge, Lord. You're the head of us and you're the head of them, Father. And Lord, we we are just so thankful for that, Lord. And I just pray now you continue to open your word, Lord. And bless our brother, Lord, as he continues to prepare for tonight. And Lord God, I just pray that your special anointing will be upon them, Lord, and upon our hearts as well. And I pray that you'll be in our fellowship as well with a shared lunch. And Lord, that we may be fellowship more and on your word, Lord, a shared testimonies of what you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, we commit ourselves under your hands and pray for um Lord, that you'll bring us back safely here again this this afternoon, Lord, in your precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
