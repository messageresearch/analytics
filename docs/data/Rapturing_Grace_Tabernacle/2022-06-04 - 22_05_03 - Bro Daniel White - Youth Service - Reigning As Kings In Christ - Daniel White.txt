even though most of the time i struggle to sing a bit but my voice is playing up a little bit so i just want to not overdo it tonight we had a bit of a road to travel this weekend and looking forward to it very much but um just want to say that it's a real honor and privilege to be here with you tonight a real honor and privilege some of you i don't know some of you i do know some of you i do know but i don't know because you've grown so much my goodness you're probably saying the same thing about me time has an effect on everyone they say but uh lord bless you it is a real honor it's not just another thing that we do it's not just another thing that that i'm here to do it's something that i deem a great privilege to be able to just bring something that the lord's laid upon upon my heart and a thought that helped me and really all we are is adults as big kids with these kids that are grown up so the same thing that helps you helps us the same thing that helps us can help you so i just i just want to be a blessing to you tonight by being a help to you and to help you along your life's journey the place positions that you have in life that's what we're here to do for one another is just to help each other along yeah there's there's a part of me that couldn't have got here tonight with without a part of me getting me here and we are one body in christ amen and we're here to to help each other and sometimes to carry each other sometimes to to encourage each other but one thing that we do know is that we will all be there by god's grace and only by god's grace so just want to be a help with you to you tonight um i'm not bringing anything new you have a pastor that has you on his heart so much and a pastor's wife um who have you at the very front of their heart and and love you and care for you and want the best for you in everything and that's that's a real gift from god so uh you're very lucky people very lucky people i'm privileged enough to have my wife here tonight it's a wonderful privilege for both of us to be here with you haven't um traveled out of australia for quite some time um but we're this is our first trip out for must be three or four years so it's um it's wonderful to be with you amen so we're just going to bring a real practical service tonight um perhaps uh well i'm going to need some help some volunteers tonight and don't be afraid i'm not going to ask you to do anything that um that might might embarrass you or belittle you in in any way it's it's really just to to be able to bring a point across uh clearly and oftentimes we just allow the holy spirit to expand that thought as we go through it none of us here tonight uh are even the oldies up the back bless you we um we're we can all learn tonight with what the lord has has for us so let's just commit the service to the lord in prayer tonight a heavenly father lord it is such an honor and privilege lord to stand before lord your purchase possession lord as as young sheep lord pushing through a world heavenly father that is going in the opposite direction to the direction that you have for these young people lord god lord we can't help but live in this world and and feel the pressures that are against us purely lord because we're not going the direction that they are we're not going with the current lord god we we are going upstream and lord god we just want to thank you for your grace and your love to us tonight lord it was by your thought that you saw this meeting here tonight before the foundation of the world lord you knew who would be here you knew the purpose of this meeting and lord god if we could just submit us ourselves to you tonight lord god that would allow you heavenly father to make that thought that you had manifest here tonight lord god as much as we feel prepared and lord god we we allow a portion lord god for you just to to move us in the direction lord god if it if it means leaving everything lord god that we have prepared for tonight lord god then so be it heavenly father we just commit the service into your hands lord may you and only you heavenly father be the one that receives the glory and honor from everything that is accomplished tonight as your word goes forth in jesus christ's name amen amen amen let's open our bibles tonight to the book of ephesians i have a real habit of of um going too long and um i'll i always do do my best not to um to keep you unnecessarily but we just want to allow the lord to lead us as it pleaseth him to lead us so we just want to give him preeminence tonight the thought tonight is reigning as kings in christ okay reigning as kings in christ ephesians chapter one we're gonna start from verse three the blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved you can take your seats just keep your bibles open i have a couple more scriptures here that we would like to look at tonight i've asked joseph here to do the impossible a little bit later but all things are possible to them that believe but um we we thank the lord here for this encouragement in the book of ephesians how he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself if we turn to the book of romans also romans chapter 8 so we're predestinated to a position amen by jesus christ amen we're predestinated to a position by him it's it's not a self-elected position it's not a self-chosen position it's not a self it's not self positioning self in a position but it's christ that does all these things for us amen by predestination he has already foreordained your position okay so that position is something that we discover in life as young believers in um romans chapter 4 verse sorry chapter 8 verse 14 it says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so you cannot find this position self cannot find its position because sons and daughters of god are those that are led by the spirit of god amen so it's not possible for us to find our position we must be led there we must be led to that position you you'll you'll find in in life if we're self-led then we can talk ourselves out of that position because we we put our self there all right but if god puts us there then no one not even you can talk your way out of that position because what god does he does permanently for his sons and daughters so as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and i i trust that you believe that you're led by the spirit of god tonight amen you might say well i i don't have the holy ghost tonight do you realize that the spirit of god will lead you to the baptism of the holy ghost so leadership by the spirit of god does not start when you receive the holy ghost but the spirit of the the spirit of leadership the holy ghost in your life begins before you actually receive the baptism of the holy ghost amen we could talk about these things a lot for a long time but we we want to keep moving and i want to keep this as as simple as i can so so even the adults can get it verse 15 says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father amen we could go to galatians 4 here you know we we don't become sons by receiving the baptism of the holy ghost the reason that you receive the baptism of the holy ghost is that because you are a son amen the sons and daughters of god are they that receive the baptism of the holy ghost amen so we do not re receive the spirit of bondage again to fear joseph that that song you know that song that you sung that god pressed on your heart it's it's it's beautiful it's it's wonderful because god has has god is not leading us by fear god is leading us by the spirit of adoption amen by love he's leading us by his eternal love for us so we can go to the book of revelation as well and i know this is a lot of scripture reading but um just just bear with me and just a couple more scriptures revelations chapter 1 verse 5 and 6 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever so we see here that there's a position mentioned here in verse 6 that the faithful witness has made us kings and priests unto god amen he has made us kings and priests now the thought tonight is reigning as kings in christ okay because we want to be what he's made us amen we want to be what he's made us revelation chapter 5 verses 9 and 10 verse 9 of revelation 5 and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou hast thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hath made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on earth amen rain we shall reign on earth if god has made you a king then he will also make it possible for you to fulfill that role amen if god positions you then he will give you what is necessary so that you can fulfill the things that are required of you in that role is that right god has made us kings and priests if god has made us something then he will equip us with what is necessary so that we can be who god tells us that we are amen so we're not self-chosen we're not self-positioned we're not self-armed amen everything we're not self-elected all right we're not self-chosen but everything that we are is something that god does for us all right so that why so that we might reign on earth now when will we reign on earth do i use this brothers this one yeah wonderful brother branham reads revelation 1 6 and he says he hath made us or there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord all of all of grace he redeemed us for our purpose amen and we i want to fulfill my purpose amen because it's not just about redemption but he redeemed us for a purpose amen he redeemed you for a purpose amen and that's the purpose is what we want to find out he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we are oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom okay this this might sound a little bit heavy but but just stay with me don't don't don't shut down on me because it it'll become very simple as we get into the the practical side of this okay but what i want you to notice there is the bit in yellow there but now but now we are spiritual king so he's not talking about when we return after the millennial reign but he's talking about now we will be kings there too but we are also kings now we are now we now now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom all right because what someone tell me what does a king have a kingdom a kingdom he reigns over a spiritual kingdom because a king ain't a king unless he's got a kingdom but because you're a king you have a kingdom because you're a king you have a kingdom okay it says in romans 5 17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ that's not all is it there we go and in colossians 1 3 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praises and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen so we we thank we thank the lord for this amen now joseph this is where we're going to put your talents to the test now i want to just kind of bring you into this service tonight and i want to ask you what are some of the qualities of a king can anyone you can shut that i'll finish with that if you want to shut that down but um what what would be a quality of a king i'll i'll give you one as an example integrity anyone else wisdom could could yep loyalty yeah anyone else humility leadership yeah sorry fairness how we going there joe we got wisdom we've got um integrity um what was some uh humility was said it's better you than me i i wouldn't i don't even know how to spell humility so you're doing well bro leadership anyone else grace patience love fairness sorry sister anyone else integrity yeah forgiving you doing good joe we're up to forgiving what about free yeah you'd have to be free right because we don't want to lead we can't lead properly when if we're bound we want to be to lead correctly he must be free you know if you had one leg tied up behind you it would be pretty hard to lead someone so you want to be free from bondage free from fear because we don't want to be led by fear amen sons and daughters of god are not led by fear but they're led by the spirit of adoption okay so we want to lead correctly why why would we want to lead correctly why would a king want to lead correctly sorry yeah yeah absolutely anyone else yeah because it affects the follower even if it's only one okay because if you're a king you're you're meant to you're meant to reign you're meant to rule you're meant to be a leader and your your whole your whole heart is not for you but it's for the people that are following you okay so you want to be free because if you're not free then how you lead is going to affect who is behind you is that right absolutely it it will and it does okay so we want to be free we we we want to be um courageous we want to be loving one thing david did and i for me personally it was part of the reason that god said david you're a man after my own heart can anyone does anyone want to think about david and perhaps something comes to your mind that something david was able to do repent be able to repent but before you can repent what must you do what must you be able to do admit you're wrong see that you're wrong amen see a leader must be able to see when he's wrong and not be so hot-headed that no one can point out when they're wrong all right why because if you've done wrong it's going to affect who's following you right because this that's what happened to david when david did wrong it affected what was who was following him because david was king you know repentance is one of those things that pride gets in the way of our of our ability to to repent um because as we we as people we don't like to admit that we're wrong but let me give you a hint when you get to my age you get used to it the more you can do it it's not that you go out to make wrong do wrong you don't wake up in the morning say praise the lord another day to do wrong you know we don't do it intentionally but what you're going to find is there is a blessing that comes with acknowledging your mistakes god blesses you when you can acknowledge your mistakes do you know why because you're deeming him right and you're humbling humility you're humbling yourself under the authority of the king because you are a king not the king oh when i was 18 i was the king i was the king there was no one above me but guess what there was no one below me because no one wanted to follow me no one wants to follow someone who thinks that there's something when everyone else can see through your facade and say you ain't what you're saying you are humble yourself and to say lord bring yourself subject to his word because that's when the prophet come to david david submitted himself to the word of the lord amen david submitted himself he humbled himself said lord forgive me for what i have done and david was totally blinded to the fact of what he was doing he was blind to it but when the word of the lord comes because why david wasn't self-chosen david wasn't self-elected david wasn't elected by a company of people god god had chosen david amen and because god chose david god was god god held himself responsible for david and god holds himself responsible for you because he has chosen you so when when you mess up and the word of the lord comes to you it can come from a pulpit it can come through a 10 year old it can come through a a 90 year old it can come how however it comes god's word can come to you in many different forms in many different ways you can be mowing the grass and god's work god will just quicken something to your heart and you can recognize your error through those different means you can recognize your error looking at nature if we want to be right god will god will make sure that you are but we can't be right in our through our own efforts we've got we're only way that we can be who we are called to be is if if the king comes down and corrects a king he brings correction so we've got to be able to be corrected we've got to be able to be able to repent we've got to be able to as as children you know as as children sometimes it's easy to repent to an invisible god but but your parents are a god with skin on them it's god with skin on and sometimes god requires you to go back to your parents say mom dad sorry for my attitude sorry for what i've done here sorry for for what i've i've done there because we'll get to that in a further down the track joe can we keep that slide and start another one so let's let's talk about now we've probably included one or two in this already but what what are the roles of a king what are some of the things a king does judge provider yeah we could probably yeah mediator don't overwork joseph anyone else yeah a warrior not as in warrior a friend yeah sorry no anyone else teacher sorry yeah peacemaker yeah absolutely protector i want to use this one word and it's probably i don't know if it is a word but influencer because all these everything that he does influences who's looking he may someone may be looking who's who's not even a part of his kingdom okay but everything he does influences someone so a king influences uh for the for the ladies here obviously we're not just talking about when we talk about kings we're not just talking about male kings the bible says he hath made us it doesn't say he has made the men kings it says he hath made us kings and priests and brother rahm says very clearly that this is the body of christ both men and women okay because young boys look at the older boys and and how they're ruling their kingdom and how they're ruling the kingdom influences those that those younger boys and the younger girls look at the older girls and the way that the the the older girls are are ruling their kingdom influences the younger girls that are that are looking on okay so again our responsibility is is not just to ourself and it's not just to god even though that is a part of our responsibility but our responsibility is also to the people that around us not even necessarily the people that are following you it goes further than that okay but it goes to down to a level of people are watching and people are being influenced okay and we want to be influenced by the right things and you as kings are looking at others for influence okay because after all you know we are we are sheep and we are easily influenced but we want to be influenced by the right thing if we're not being influenced by the right thing then these other things are really going to to not be be portrayed correctly expressed correctly so we we we want to be who god asks us to be this is probably i don't know how you put this into words but a king controls what comes into his kingdom and what goes out a king controls what comes through the gate thinking in old testament terms a king controls what comes through the gate and what goes out of the gate okay so he doesn't want anything to come into the gate in through the gate that is going to defile his kingdom huh this is why a shepherd stands at the door because the shepherd is the king of his kingdom under the king all right but the reason that he stands at the door is because he doesn't want to allow something to the best of his ability he stops everything that that could possibly defile his flock from entering in because i'll give you a little hint it's easier to keep the devil out than to have to throw him out okay so a king controls what comes in all right i don't have my phone but your phone is something that you need to control because the the that the the things of this world can enter into your kingdom through the phone is that right but a king has the ability to control what comes in this is why the lord said to abraham thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy okay because if you can possess the gate then you can possess what comes in if something comes in wrong if something comes in that you're not aware of then you have the power to expel that thing whatever it is be let it be an attitude okay we all get them all right if if we take on an attitude that's wrong we have the ability as kings the power as kings to expel to cast out that attitude in my experience this the simplest way to get rid of an attitude is through repentance okay that's through my experience through my experience you you may not even know where it come from but if you go back to the one where the mom dad um husband wife if you go back to that one and say look down i'm i'm sorry for my attitude that thing will just lift it's it's supernatural it's not literally picking the thing up and throwing it out you know it's it can be the just by following god's order satan is expelled from our lives he's pushed out okay so we we are we have the ability to to control what comes in and what comes out if we if we if we fail to control what comes in then we are responsible ourselves the king can't play in the gov we can't blame the governor and the governor can't you know a lord is the wife you gave me you know and and then the wife said i it's the serpent's fault he beguiled me no you you caused the error okay so we've got to take responsibility because you can't have a kingdom without having responsibilities so we have to take responsibilities for our errors and that ain't always easy okay and i'm not saying that i'm not speaking to you in a way that about something that i have not experienced and had to do myself if you look at one another you're all in the same boat none of us are perfect none of us have uh are mistake free we will make mistakes okay but we need to make take i should say responsibility one thing this world hates is responsibility coverts everyone else's fault you know it's just everyone else's fault the the guy on the dole can't meet his his budget yeah people on the dole have a budget i don't understand that and then they get cranky when the doll don't meet their budget well they should be out working because there's work everywhere at least where i am i can't get enough people in the cafes if you have to work in a cafe don't work in a cafe you'll do whatever is necessary you'll take responsibility for things in life okay now i'm going to ask for four volunteers and what the time is how are we going not too bad it's pretty good can i can i have some a couple of volunteers it won't hurt i want two boys and two girls if it's possible sorry i should have said that before i thought you were going to be a volunteer then bro okay dad i won't give you the mum one i need two girls come on please please come on james there you go son am i good i'm the mom now kings of a kingdom what does it mean what what by then i'm a king i'm i'm in a position yes but what is your position because from this service i don't want you going home and saying brother dan said i'm a king dad so step aside i can make my own decisions i'm my own protector and then the daughter goes home and says dad mom the pastor dan said tonight that that that i'm a king step aside i can do all this by myself i'm i'm i'm a king i'll make my own decisions from here on in we are kings and we are to reign in the position that god has given us to reign in but our positions can change but at the moment you're in the position that you are here now okay so when we when we look at dad here and we look at the son and the mom and the daughter they are positions right that has a position that god wants him to be a king in when i saw this which wasn't that long ago it just helped me so much i just rejoiced okay so dad what's your name bro michael you're not dad yet no but he is tonight so as a to explain the situation dad this is the position that god wants michael to reign in as a king we go to the sun the sun here this is the position that god wants the sun to be a king in all right so it's not a when when the sun is when this when the sun the sun being a king doesn't do away with dad we are kings and priests but what that means is that's just that's a form that's a in if we bring that into our everyday life that's symbolic that's a position that's a thing that's a position that god wants you to reign in but the position is son and then we've got mom same and the daughter is the same if if mom if the daughter now god has placed this young lady as a daughter and this is the position that god wants her to reign in this is the position that god wants her to rule in now if we look at all these things that joseph's professionally written down here we can we can look at the dad and we can say dad in the position that god wants you to reign in you are to be a judge a peacemaker a friend a provider a teacher a warrior a influencer can we go to the back to the slide before that and you are to have wisdom to have grace to have humility to show leadership that fairness forgiving etc etc this is the position that god wants dad to be a king in this is the position that god wants dad to reign in and we can go right right on down same with the sun this is the position that god wants the sun to reign in and in that position god wants the sun to have wisdom patience grace humility he wants him to be forgiving show love be loyal be free white because there's other sons looking at this son as an influence true okay and if you can reign in this position then you will be the influence to these other people other sons that you're meant to be but only only through that only through being a king can you be the right influence that you're meant to be same with our sister here through through as a daughter god wants her to reign as a daughter so that the other sisters who are looking on can see an influence the correct influence and they can follow that influence and use that influence as an example and it's the same with mom and it's the same with that there's there's other moms and dads that are looking on to these moms and dads but god wants mom and dad to reign to be kings in this position okay and it's it's it's so so so so so important that you understand this um it's important that moms and dads understand this and it's as important for sons and daughters to understand this so much it will change so much in your life because eventually there comes a promotion where the son becomes a dad and the daughter becomes a becomes a mom or we could say the son becomes a husband and the daughter becomes a wife okay so it's so this is so important because if if we if the son comes home to dad and says look dad i'm bigger than you step aside yeah i'm i'm a king but if the son is positioned correctly and ruling reigning in his god-given position he will show dad the respect that dad that that the lord requires the son to give to dad children respect your parents and i'll admit that sometimes that ain't always easy but nevertheless god didn't say when it's easy said he said children respect your parents all right so so if the son is in the right position and he's reigning in that position he will show dad the respect that dad requires okay now can i get two more a boy and a girl sorry male and female i didn't know whether to do this one or not because it might get me in trouble my writing's not as good as yours joe i hope i spelt it right anyone get on your boyfriend on your girlfriend now i i could have changed this one and made put boyfriend under it and girlfriend under that one but i thought i'd just add add to the picture a little bit so obviously a boyfriend is a is a boy at least in our vocabulary it is but now the boyfriend wants to be a girlfriend to dad's daughter the boyfriend wants to be a boyfriend to dad's daughter you see you got to be able to handle the correction all right the boy a boy wants to be a the to take dad's daughter to be his girlfriend as a young man what god wants you to do is reign in this position right he wants you to reign in this position now i hope this is okay but what's your name sister marissa amy so amy is michael's daughter okay so what's going to happen here is because this young man is reigning in his position he's going to do the right thing by the by his potential girlfriend by addressing the dad of the daughter that he has an interest in because he is he is called he is reigning in his position so he is going to access the daughter through the one that the daughter belongs to right so the way that you're going to access your potential wife is to go through the father all right you can read john 17 in your spare time and watch the vocabulary that jesus uses when he speaks about lord i thank thee for those that thou hast given me all right and he was speaking of us he's speaking of his potent his bride his potential bride all right but the way that he was going to access his bride was through the father because it was the father that is going to give what belongs to him to him i thank thee now if the daughter's not reigning in her position excuse me amy i know you're not this type of girl but i just i'll just make an example if she's not reigning in his position she'll she'll try and and go around the authority her authority her headship okay because her headship is her father but because she's reigning in her position she has no desire to to try and get around her headship she'll go through her headship all right and if if this young man wasn't ruling and reigning by the spirit of god that is within him then what he will do is he will try and bypass the headship of the woman remember what what satan offered satan offered jesus the bride for nothing take it it's yours and that jesus said no the price must be paid i have to do things the right way amen so what this young man does is he he doesn't try and avoid headship he doesn't try he recognizes the headship the relationship between between the father and daughter he recognizes that and he recognizes that the only way because this is a spirit-filled man this is a spirit-filled man and she's got he's got a spirit-filled wife and a spirit-filled daughter the only way that he is going to access what is his is through the leadership that god has placed over the men over the girlfriend okay it's it's this it's the same principles within church this is why brother random hits out so much at proselyting because proselyting has begu is going behind the headship right because the pastor is the headship and when someone tries and pulls the flock behind the pastor's back the person who's pulled ends up i don't know how many times the bible says worse than what they are when before they were proselyted and and and and that is the truth so this is if this young man here was to avoid the pastor of the home and proselyte the girl um his daughter then what she's going to do she's going to pay the price figure that out she's going to pay the price the person who's proselyted ends up worse than what they are but because this man has a pure heart he wants things done right he wants to be led by the holy spirit and he wants what is best for the one that god has placed upon his heart he will follow the right path according to god's word to get what he believes is his okay now if we can just wait there a moment colossians 1 27 says to to who to whom god would make known what is the riches of his glory of the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory now for those of you that aren't a part aren't standing up here if christ let's start with dad if christ was in dad how would christ express himself sorry as dead okay so brother if you just allow me and this will i'll do it on you because it's easier it's christ expressing himself as dad right so let's go to the sun now if christ is in his in this son how is christ going to express himself as or through the position of sun it's magnificent it is glorious that just because christ is in you doesn't just because christ is in the sun doesn't put himself up doesn't put the sun above the dad but christ in the sun is it'll be christ expressed through the sun what about the daughter if christ is in the daughter how's christ going to be expressed as mum as dad as a son no if christ is in the daughter it's going to be christ expressed as a daughter is that right it's glorious it's magnificent the the confusion of headship is finished here because every one of these come under headship and christ does not work against his own word the dad is subject to christ the wife is subject to the dad the son is subject to the parents the daughter is subject to the parents it's christ it's expressing himself as if christ is in mum who is christ going to be expressed as mum mum ordinary mum plain mum this is why if the son has a has a something he needs to talk about he can go to dad and he can go to mum and he can find his answer his answer can come through dad because christ is working through dad the cro he can go to his mother but because christ is working through mum mum can give him christ's answer to the question that he had it's the same with the daughter if the if a daughter has an issue the the daughter can go to the mother and and even though christ is in her i don't need to go to mum i'm a king no you are a king as a son speaking myself and sometimes the son has to go to the father because the father has has got more wisdom than the sun so so what happens is that the sun needs to go to the dad for some wisdom the son needs to humble himself i'm sorry but however old you are you don't know as much as your mum and dad's okay they've been on earth longer they've had more experience and sometimes you need to humble yourself as a son to say dad i don't know what to do here same with the daughter the daughter can go to the mom and say listen mom um i've got a question about about this and about that and what's she doing she's submitting herself to the authority that god has placed over her it's not a you know a whipping authority it's a loving authority and this is why if he's gonna be expressed as the boyfriend all right and and how how if if christ is in the boyfriend what he's gonna do is you're gonna see a pattern you're going to see a pattern within the scripture where god courted us where our husband courted us we could say in in bringing it down to our how we're looking at this our boyfriend had an interest in us right but he didn't because it was christ it was god in christ reconciling the world to himself because it was god in christ because it was god in the boyfriend he he didn't he didn't not pay the price he paid the price for his girlfriend and then it was a a legitimate a legitimate joint joining it was a legitimate union you don't want an illegitimate union you want a legitimate union and the only way the union can be legitimate is if the boyfriend pays the price sorry boyfriends but that's just life and that's just the way it is but because of your love because of his love that he has for this one he wants the best for her think about this if christ didn't pay the price would that have affected us oh yeah oh yeah if it affects the proselyter the one being proselyted it would have affected us because satan was trying to proselyte us okay so all this is is christ in dad christ in the boyfriend because christ is in the boyfriend christ will be expressed as the boyfriend i got one daughter left if i don't see christ in the boyfriend then he doesn't even have a chance not everyone that has christ has a chance let me just put that out there okay so we understand it's christ expressing himself in the office or in the position the office that god has positioned you in now when when the sun becomes a husband it'll be christ expressing himself through the husband when the son when the husband becomes a dad it'll be christ expressing himself as a son you're never not a son as a husband and as a dad this is why it's a promotion it's not the pulling off of a stripe and the putting on of a different color it's the adding of stripes one stripe son two stripes husband three stripes dad granddad won't be long all right but it's christ it's christ and this is what god wants you to see tonight it's christ in you if your the boyfriend is not a husband i'm sorry but he's not he might think he is he's not he's potentially a husband but he's not a husband and god doesn't operate through potential god operates through where he is now amen so you you you as the boyfriend cannot take leadership with the girlfriend because the girlfriend's not yours you're not in the position to take the leadership this is why marriage is a handing over of hatchet and until until there's a union there's not a handing over of headship and until there's until then this young man is subject to his dad and he's also subject to the his girlfriend's dad what his girlfriend's dad says ghost i'm sorry boys but it does what the girlfriend's dad says goes because you are under you are a son you're not a dad all right so it's christ as a dad it's christ as the boyfriend it's christ as a son christ as mum christ as a daughter christ as the girlfriend it's christ in you where are you what's your position we have sons and we have daughters perhaps we have people in in as boyfriends or girlfriends i don't know but but but whatever you are christ will be expressed in the office that you hold and in that office thank you very much in that office god wants you to reign god wants you to reign in the office that you are currently in and that takes for for the most part it takes humility to reign because most of the time going by experience we think too much of ourself and god has to pull us back so that we can be who we are ordained to be when david made his error it was a time where the kings should be at war but david decided to stay home but it was in a time where the king should be at war because david thought he was above the authority that was over him he made mistakes and most of our mistakes speaking by experience is because we we lift ourselves to a position that we're not meant to be and god wants us to recognize our position and i say this again most of the time it requires humility because most of the time we have to come back because the 18 year old wants to rule the home the 18 year old is not called to rule the home dad is meant to rule the home the daughter wants to rule the home no the daughter is not meant to rule the home the parents are meant to rule the home as a unit so it's christ in you expressing himself through the office that you are currently in this is why your pastor has a heart for you this is why he prays for you whenever he can because in that office it's christ being expressed as a pastor amen so we are very privileged people because we are called to rule we are called to reign in this world that we live in this world struggles with authority it struggles with headship and we can't allow the influence of the influences of this world to influence us amen so we want to be we want to do what god wants us to do we want to be what god wants us to be in the position that god has placed us in amen now i'm not i'm not saying if if your parents ask you to do something that's contrary to the word go and see your pasta if a if a father asks sorry if a husband asks his wife to cut her hair she doesn't have to do it why because according to the word it's wrong all right so what what i'm saying here you might say well but i don't i don't know your situations all right so i guess i'm just putting a bit of a disclaimer in here that if you have disbelieving parents if you have if if you have this just believing parents who who who are who are trying to discourage you um from from current coming to church um talk to your pastor about it go and speak to your past say what what do i do what do i do in this situation but those of you who have believing parents you're believing parents if your parents have the holy ghost they're not going to lead you contrary to god's word they're going to lead you according to god's word okay but even someone who does you harm you can still respect them jesus was the lamb of god all right and they flogged those nails through his palms of his hands he didn't hiss out at them didn't strike out of them they had a part to play in in him being able to take his position and we don't like this but god places people around us that are there to build character in us they have their part to play the important thing is that you don't lose respect for anyone you be you reign in your position as he reigned as the lamb of god you reign in your position and if you have any doubts whether what you're doing is is is right or not you have a pastor okay in in god's economy the pastor is the shepherd and his flock of the sheep the pastor is there to give guidance to the sheep so if you have a question that's what your past is for the problem no i mention that's because in a church scene that's what god's given you a pastor for it's not just you it's the parents as well it's the grandparents it's the widows it's everyone he's he's the shepherd of that flock it's going to be christ expressed through that office so if you have a question about something then your your parents are there yes absolutely i'm not i'm not saying not to go to your parents go to your parents but i'm also saying that your pastor is there to help you as well amen so we thank god amen we thank god that he he has he has revealed these things to us and he has made it possible in our lives to be the leader that we're called to be okay so we we we thank god and we want to say thank you lord for revealing these things to me so i can be a better christian than than what god has than what i am currently and that's okay to say that okay so god bless you all does anyone want to comment or say anything or no one did it help yeah so i know that you want to be right and that's the beautiful thing about the bride is that she wants to be right the members of the body of christ want to be right and they want god's guidance in and sometimes they need god we need god's guidance in areas of that we didn't think we needed guidance sometimes we think we have it all worked out and then god just opens his opens himself up and says ah i don't have it all worked out lord lord like david said lord teach me thy ways that i might walk in them teach me thy ways that i might walk in them and lord while i walk in them may the people who are watching may i may may you be expressed as i walk in your ways because it can't be anything else as long as you are walking in his ways it's going to be christ that is expressed through you as sons as daughters as boyfriends as girlfriends as long as you're work walking according to god's word it's going to be christ that is going to be expressed through you amen let's just let why don't we stand to our feet bow our heads in a in a word of prayer ask someone to come and close the service a heavenly father lord god these things are just life-changing but lord god because you have chosen us before the foundation of the world to be kings of our kingdom lord god you are also the the tudor you are also the one who comes and teaches us how to rule in our kingdom how to reign in our kingdom because lord god it is true that it doesn't come naturally to us but lord god we need your leadership you designed us this way you designed us as sheep all of us as sheep and sheep cannot lead themself sheep need the holy ghost shepherd in our lives to lead us in the ways that we ought to be walking in to lead us and teach us how we are meant to rule and reign over our kingdoms lord we love you we love one another and lord god we want to be right we want to do things right yes we are not here for ourself lord god but we are here so that you can receive glory through us oh lord god that is our purpose is that you might be expressed through each and every one of us no matter whatever our position might be lord god our desire is that you might be expressed through who we are through the position that you have given us at this time lord god if we have been misled if we have been self-led lord if we are wrong in any way then i ask lord god that you would reveal it to us personally reveal it to me lord god that i might walk according to your word because it is only that way that you are expressed oh lord god we thank you for the young people here tonight lord god they are more precious in your sight lord god than we can ever imagine and heavenly father a part of that expression lord god has been expressed here tonight by you lord god just sharing a little bit more about yourself oh lord god we thank you for opening up yourself to us tonight we thank you lord god for coming down amongst us lord god and as that shepherd that you said you

position and if if we can just realize that and recognize that and and ask him to to take full preeminence in each of our roles in each of our positions then we'll then we'll get the best out of those
