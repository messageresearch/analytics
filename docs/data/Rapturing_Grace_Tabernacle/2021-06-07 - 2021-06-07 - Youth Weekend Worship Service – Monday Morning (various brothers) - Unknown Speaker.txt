are awake i had a good night's sleep so let's just open in a word of prayer quickly before we go into scripture this morning precious heavenly father o lord god truly that's the song of our hearts that you'd come and cover us this morning lord lord god we don't want to see any of our humanity we don't want to see any of ourselves lord we just want you and you alone father oh lord god i pray you'd come this morning and that you've attached lives lord oh god we've seen how you've worked over this weekend lord how you've built relationships how you've worked in lives lord how you've encouraged the young people oh god oh father and i pray you'll come once again this morning and do the same work lord lord just take them a step closer to you father oh lord god we know father you're that great dad that they just hung about lord with open arms lord god that we can run into father and be safe lord oh god i pray lord that you just take these few little words lord and lord that you'll just give me the direction that you wanted to go father and to highlight the points just as an encouragement lord i pray father that you just have perfect preeminence in this meeting now father we committed into your hands in jesus christ amen god bless you but before we take a seat um you can just turn in your bibles to romans eight i'm just going to read a few little scriptures from there um just they already just asked me last night if i wouldn't mind to share five minutes uh i don't know how 5 minutes is going to go it's going to be a bit rough to get it in five minutes but we'll we'll see what the lord does i'll try and keep it short and sweet and to the point romans 8 and verses 28 to 31 thank you musicians what a wonderful atmosphere here this morning and just appreciate the presence of the lord it goes on and says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did fore know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified focus on this last verse here what shall we say what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us i have your seats this morning we've been having a wonderful time amongst all the youth this weekend each one of you have have a good time i made you maybe new friends and and rekindled old friendships and just strengthened your relationships with each other over this time and we know that the devil is not happy with that he's not going to keep trying to keep it that way he's going to want to try and destroy that he's going to want to try and break those friendships down by bringing in little isms or little things that maybe somebody says to to destroy a relationship the devil will try and twist any words that might be spoken amongst you to try and separate you again and let you go off on separate paths and isolate yourself and put yourself in a corner somewhere because he's that's what he wants to do it's like a coal that you take from a fire and you put it on the side it gets cold and it dies off and that's exactly what the enemy wants to do with each one of you your lives is to separate you put you in a little cocoon somewhere and die off and get cold but i encourage you to spend time together found a friend that you can pray with somebody that will encourage you in the word somebody that will lift you up not somebody that will draw you away from the things of the word rather just build friends that are one that's to draw you closer to god and that you can do things to support the cause of this gospel in this day and we can rest in what god has done in our lives we can have a peace in our lives we do not need to fear anymore about what the enemy will try and bring against us because our god is more than able to deliver us and to bring us through because our god is the one that is for us as that scripture says so who can be against us there is no one that can come against there is nothing that can come against you we have the greatest one that's on the inside of us it's not our own strength it's not our own energy that we can do this in it's nothing that we can achieve only by his grace that we can this morning and the great thing is that the lord has started a work in your life and he is the one that is going to finish that work we don't need to worry about that because god is not a haphazard project manager that comes on the scene to start a project and and start something and not realize how much it's going to cost we might do that we try and do renovations maybe at home or different things and we get halfway through and oh we haven't budgeted for this we haven't thought about this unforeseen thing but with god nothing is unforeseen he sees the end from the beginning he knows exactly what the cost is going to be to bring you to the end and he has already paid that full price god has got all the resources that he needs to do the work in your life there is no sin that you could have gone too far and that god cannot change that this morning that he cannot wash that clean the blood of jesus christ is so powerful the devil will try and tell you that you've gone too far that you've crossed the line that you you there's no more hope for you but i want to encourage you this morning that there is god is here this morning still to change our life he is still the same god yesterday today and forever he's never failed he never changes there is no plan b with god when he starts with you he knows the end result he's never going to throw you out and god can't fix any of your problems you don't need to listen to the enemy that tells us god can't fix me god has raised us up each one of us is different each one of us have a purpose that god has called us to be and i cannot be like you and you cannot be like me i cannot preach like brother tazewell or the other wonderful ministers i'm not them and they're not me so each one of us are a tool in god's toolbox this morning and god who pulls out a tool at different times to do different work he does not bring out a hammer to to screw a screw into the wall yes you might get a similar result but it's going to be a bit of a mess so we cannot use god does it you know god uses you individually for the situation that is that is a that is the need of the hour so don't feel bad if you don't get called on from the lord every single meeting to do something for him the lord knows an appointed time where you will pull out you could be a tool in a box for a year or ten years and god will reach us down and says today i have need of this and just maybe for that one time in your life that god has need of you to say something to change a soul to reach out to somebody and that could be your moment just keep humble before the lord keeps it sincere before him and trust him that he will bring you into that position rest in him this morning we can trust in god that he will bring those things out for us so we can stand firm in this battle knowing that god is before us so don't try and be somebody else because we're going to put a pressure on ourselves that's unnecessary try and be something that we are not we try and live this message in a legalistic approach and then it becomes so hard it becomes such a difficult walk because we're trying to attain maybe to a brother or sister that's sitting on the side of us i want to be so spiritual like them but you don't know what they're going through behind it might just be a front you don't know what goes on behind closed doors what they struggle with so just relax in his presence the lord is working on you i just encourage you just to take god at his word and stand on it trust him to see you through to the end because the theme of what i wanted to bring forth this morning is we are disruptors we're disruptors to satan's plan to satan's plan he had for you he will come to disrupt you disrupt his program and then i just googled this quickly last night to found out what the disrupter means and they say to be a disrupter is to create a product a service or a way of doing things which is which displaces the existing existence market leaders and eventually replaces them at the helm of the sector so that is what you are here today you're a disrupter this morning you're yet to disrupt the enemy's plans that he had for you god has come and intervened with you this morning he's coming and has just changed your life you're no longer needing to dance to this music sheets of satan anymore that great composer has come and taken over you can now dance with the lord here is now captivated your life he has changed your your direction that you are heading in here's a disruptor in your life you yet to change the course of where you were going that's what the that's what the lord has come to do this this weekend such a privilege that we've had to see young people blossom in the things of the lord and just being together and and just fellowshipping one to with another what a wonderful thing it is so go forth god has raised up this generation right in this dark age to be a disrupter we are dangerous to the enemy super dangerous to him as our brother says be on the most wanted list in hell we are dangerous to the work of the enemy that's what you are this morning you might be sitting there thinking i'm not much i'm just a little sister little brother sitting here on the outskirts no you're important to god you're a disrupter this morning you can change the course of life for those around you and for yourself that's what god has brought us just want to read a quote quickly out of the church age message and then i hopefully haven't gone too long yet but brother branham says now remember this christ in the church and christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts that's exactly what i have before us this morning a continuation of the book of acts it's not your parents religion anymore your parents believe writing a book it's your turn this morning to write the book of acts it's your turn to step up and take the lead and to take this message into a new generation but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the true come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless he says it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people that's what the enemy has tried to do how to destruct your lives put you on a course that was heading to destruction but god has come and changed it today he goes on he says right right down to the tom he is cast into the lake of fire this is talking about where the end of where satan is going that's that's his destination so whenever he comes to to try and convince you that you're not born again and you've got this wrong that wrong you can remind him of his he's their destination this morning he's headed for lake of fire we're heading to the streets of gold with our heavenly heaven god this he fights that this is not a walk in the park the enemy hates that and he's going to fight you on every side he says he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit that's what you're here to withstand that it's not something you can do on yourself it's taking on the christ spirit in you that withstands that antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her once we have that spirit of god in us satan is powerless powerless before us he's a bluff and he's a good bluff but he is powerless he will be as definitely taught today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert that's what power we have within us the same power it was in christ because christ is in you so what difference he is the one that is doing the work is not your energy your strength it is christ that is coming to you so with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so we are the ones of chosen generations today we are raised up as an invincible army we can the enemy cannot destroy us we have the life of christ in us and that can never be destroyed the enemy tried that on the cross 2000 years ago and he could not keep him in the grave he rose again and that same life is in each one of you this morning we are an invincible army the enemy trembles at us we are dangerous look at jericho's the walls that just fell down those people that were there how they feared the israelites of what the great lord had done through their lives so you young people this morning are able to slay the enemy that comes your way to christ that helps us in joshua two and not two and ten or nine i'm just going to read a few script scriptures there that's the account of when the two spies went to rahab he said and he said unto them i know that the lord has given you the land and that your terror is befallen upon us that's what satan is trembling in his boots this morning we have a group of young people here that are filled with the holy spirit and the enemy is trembling this is what his their report was they were trembling because they were coming towards him and so when the enemy sees you coming he is trembling but he'll try and put up a big wall a big front a big giant to try and scare you off but he can't they are fury he's fearing in his boots he says for we have heard how the lord dried up the water you can reference look what the lord had done throughout your parents look what the lord has done to us this weekend look at what he's done through the prophet we can refer the enemy back and say look this is what the lord has done for me we are almighty mighty army so for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt what he did unto yeah unto the two kings of the ammonites so the lord is here to deliver you from whatever we need there's many examples you can look at other young ones that have been delivered from from drugs and alcohol and lust and all those different things we can refer back to that and say lord as you heard brother adrian said last night look at what they've done for them you can do it from here he is here we are called to be overcomers this this day god has called you to be that you are that great salmon that flows up the stream you're not going with the big stream down the down to the waterfall and heading into destruction like the rest of the world god has raised you up to be a disrupter to go against the stream against the flow that is coming your way that is what god has raised you up for at the same time and the god's word is what defines who you are not what your friend might say or the enemy on your shoulder might say or or the mistakes that you make do not define you god's word is what defines you this morning and you can take confidence in that it's not your own report or the enemy's report we can believe the report of the lord this morning so i just want to encourage you this morning with those few thoughts just to spend time together fellowship around the things of the lord and if you do see one that is drifting off and getting cold reach out and love to them don't cut them off that's the worst thing you could ever do is they are they meddling in the things of the world i'm gonna push them aside no reach out and love don't go with the critical heart and the critical spirit and condemn but go with love and save our brothers there's something i can pray with i see you struggling because you guys know each other better than what we would ever know know your friends reach out encourage those that are strong on the things of the lord reach out to the younger ones to the weak ones and encourage spend time together pray together i remember when i was growing up as a youth 20 22 years old we'd go to a bunch of brothers come together and talk a fellowship about the things of the lord and just encourage one another yes we also played cricket and sports and different things we messed around and had fun but there's times where we needed to spend time around the things of the lord so i encourage you it's fun to have play games and do all those things that you've done this weekend but encourage one another too in the things of the lord and it is a joy to serve the lord it's not something that we have to be sad about so i just trusted this morning that we can go forth from this place and disrupt the plans of satan for your life and change the course that the enemy wanted you to go down so just trust it encourage somebody this morning so let's just bow our heads as well hand over and just a word of prayer if if you need something from the lord and you feel that you are still stuck in your right and unable to get out of it the lord is here to break that and to change your course this morning heavenly father i just thank you for your grace and your mercy i just thank you for the wonderful young people before me lord although god is just so beautiful to see lord how you change lives lord how you come in and make the difference nothing lord that we have ever done to try and manufacture it or try and produce it because we cannot lord lord god we cannot make our young people serve you oh god that is not something we would ever want to do is force somebody into a legalistic approach father i've seen too much of it i've been through it myself lord hello god we need to have a relationship with you lord god that's what changes lives when we can experience that love of god in our lives and i pray father if there is any young ones here old ones whichever ones that is needing a touch i pray that you'll move past this seat this morning encourage their hearts change their lives change their thought pattern father o lord god because the enemy is sometimes gets them in such a well-walked path in their minds as soon as something is said they automatically go to that thought pattern and it takes them in a spiral downhill into depression into you whatever the enemy tries to draw their attention away from you but i pray lord that you would put a roadblock in that path lord god that they cannot go down that old piles anymore but they have to form a new path with you lord encourage them father strengthen your your bride here this morning we commit each life to you the precious name of jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord amen 210 i'll just play soft i just encouraged just what he said there eh pray together you know if you meet up for a game of basketball meet up to go shopping whatever nothing more powerful than a couple of you young guys just getting together and have a quick word of prayer before you go or something like that you know amen reach out and touch the lord and then brother joseph reach out and touch the lord [Music] as he passes by you'll find [Music] sing by this moment reach out and touch the lord as he passes by reach up and touch the low as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he's passing by this moment his needs to supply reach out and touch the lord as he by [Music] heavenly father lord we're so thankful for this opportunity that we can come this morning lord god lord we just pray you'll take these words that you've spoken on my heart and help me to say them the way that you want them to be said father in your precious name amen um if we can turn into our bibles to romans chapter eight i got a little bit nervous when brother stephen said romans chapter eight this morning i was just going to read one verse from verse 18. and it says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed unto us amen you guys can take your seats i'm going to start off with a brother brenham quote um and then we'll go from there so in um believers though this he says reminds me of paul raider how many of you ever remember heard of paul rayder well i guess you all have he he's probably preached here a few years ago one day him and his wife he was sitting at a table and know you know how families are something came up she wanted to go somewhere and he didn't wouldn't let her go so he said no i just can't do it i got something else to do and so he hurt her feelings he looked over and she was crying so he just thought wow cry and and he said he got his hat and started out and she'd always meet him at the door and kiss him goodbye when he left said brother branham when i came to the door said she was standing there with her head down she kissed me goodbye all right sid i went out to the gate and pulled the gate together and looked back she's always standing at the gate and waved and said she was standing or standing at the door and waved as he went out the gate said she was at the door she waved said i went down the street and said i began to think about it said my heart began to get bigger and bigger you know think about what what had happened what if something were to happen to me today she's my wife i love her i remember the vows said after a while he got or his heart got so big he couldn't stand it and he turned back around and back up and the way he went up the street opened the gate ran into the door real quick shoved the door open looked it looked around for her and said she was standing behind the door crying said he just grabbed her never said a word turned around kissed her turned around walked out the door said he walked down the gate and started out started out the gate said he turned around and she was standing at the gate said he waved goodbye and said she waved goodbye again um so many times recently and even you know often ministers say what they're preaching they're going through themselves and my sermon has been my testimony this morning and it's an interesting quote because um it's an odd quote from because you're all mostly single youth but it's the principle i want to focus on this morning um you know how many times have you been in situations where something happens between a brother or a sister or a friend a mum and a dad you know that kind of stuff can fester and your mind goes all sorts of places and what if the lord takes you tomorrow that person is left with that situation going on in their head and they there's no way to make peace with that because that person is there to no longer do it in romans chapter six oh sorry romans chapter eight verse six and seven it says to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded as life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so the mind the mind is always it's the one thing that is not under control of god because god can come into your mind or speak to you through your heart and your soul but the devil can also be putting thoughts into your minds all the times and what often happens and certainly in my own life anyway and i'm sure a lot of you guys are affected by this as well instead of addressing those issues and getting down on our knees and praying about it and asking the lord's guidance on that what do we do we go to social media we jump on youtube we watch tik tok you know rather than actually spending time with the lord and trying to resolve those things we mask it by watching youtube doing those things rather than actually trying to better ourselves and those things and i always looked it this way we're in a relationship with god where we are his bride he is the husband and when we turn to those things we are ignoring him he wants us to bring our problems our needs our issues that we've got and talk to him intimately and and for us to come to his bosom and feed um and all we do is we feed our flesh with short-term gratification the issue is still there after we finish and then in question answers there's a question that came across and the question was should evangelist continue in the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change a thing if jesus is coming in the morning preach like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour don't get scrupled up about up now that's not what i'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing if you're gonna do something wrong or doing evil repency come back to god continue on your evangelic service as you always did if you're building a house put it on up jesus comes tomorrow you be found faithful at your duty if you're building a church go on put it up i'd rather be putting my money in something like that than be found with it in my pocket see continue right on just go right as you were now just don't stop don't do nothing just go right as you were as you are keep on knowing it was 15 minutes before quizzing yeah oh sorry now for instance instance if you was if you're working for a man and you know it was 15 minutes before quizzing time where i'd say ah just 15 more minutes well i might as well just go over and sit down you'd get docked for that 15 minutes if you're planting wheat plant your wheat if you're digging potatoes keep go on dig them out well nobody will eat them that don't make any difference dig them out anyhow see just continue on as you are and that's that's so difficult today as christians because we know that time is so near and sometimes we can get so caught up in our circumstances and and we get so caught up in our circumstances that we don't actually live the most that we can for god today rather than so we get caught up in our circumstances and we forget about the lord and then if the rep you know if the rapture was to come you know what state are you in to be ready you always need to be ready but also you need to plant your potatoes for tomorrow you want to make the most out of every day you've got um because you never know what the next day is going to hold in your life and the trials that you're going to have um so i guess my two final statements are plant your t potatoes but be ready if he comes today and cherish the moments you have because you never know how long you've got and to finish off i want to sing a quick song which ties into the title which i didn't tell you which is called living for today so i'll do that now [Music] sitting at my room staring at the wall wondering about the meaning of it all why is it this thing called life has got me going crazy [Music] so i open up your word and let it speak to me the purpose and the plan that you have designed is clear to see and i believe i'm gonna live for the day i'm gonna follow in your way i'm gonna let my little light shine like there's no tomorrow i won't worry about the past i know my future isn't taxed so i'll choose to live my life one way i'm gonna leave it for the day you told me not to worry about what lies ahead so i am gonna focus on today instead making every moment counting accounts on every single blessing i'm gonna set my mind on the here and now and this is what i want my life to be about and this is how i'm gonna live for the day

let my little light shine like there's no tomorrow i won't worry about the past i know my future is intact so i'll choose to live my life one way i'm gonna live it for [Music] [Applause] today hey man amen 201 [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] and make me more [Music] once more make me give me [Music] brothers and sisters um you can sit down um i trust you all of enjoy the weekend i know i have and um the lord's certainly um come to us and done done something for us um i'll just jump straight into it and if we can put on i've i've got i'm just just scripture verse up there just so everyone can read it just the scripture first um yep um it says and john these things have i spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world um and brother stephen essentially said everything i was gonna say so i'll just i'll just echo what he said um and i'm i'm just gonna say what was the highlight for me and um what i got out of this weekend and it's um you know as we go back to our everyday lives our lives in the flesh is by the food he said it's um you know it's out of this atmosphere it's out of out of the positive environment that we had here and we go back to everyday life and just face our own you know our the trials that we that that we do um you know what it's what it means for me is you know the lord has given us the key to live a victorious life in this life and you know um we don't have to live a mediocre life we can we we certainly can live a life of overcoming and and you know what the lord has done for us we don't have to bow down to you know things in our lives that we struggle with um you know those things that bug us the most the key is there for us it's um yeah it's a fight like it's always gonna be a fight but but yeah the lord has made the way for us and um i like what the brothers have said you know we have the key to tear down satan's kingdom in our lives he's got plans for our lives um but you know the devil's plans has been cancelled and and you know we we can mean something for someone else again you know and um allow the lord just to work through us um but what i've also realized is you know it cost something it cost it costs you everything um you know we've got ambitions and certain ideas for this life um i know i've got my ideal idea of what i want to do and well not necessarily what i want to do but i i've got my idea of fun and what i'd like out of this life and to be honest you know you can you can make certain things an idol and and and not really give the lord that first place in your life and um and and that's what he asked for it's like it says in matthew um where um you know it speaks about if you're not willing to take up your cross and follow him you're not worthy of him and that's um it's quite a direct statement so yeah may the lord just help us to lay down you know every facet of our lives and um you know as brother adam said if you if you've gained this whole world like you often look at maybe sports styles or whatever whatever you look at they you know they give their everything for for what they attain and what they become good at but the real reality is you know you look at them you think oh you know i'm missing out but if you've missed christ and you've gained that you've missed the mark you know at the end of their lives where are they going um and elizabeth adrian said last night you know we've we've got to lay down ourselves our own south wales so that his strength can be made perfect and now in our own weaknesses and insufficiencies i just want to can you put on that quote please um brother random captures it quite nicely right there so and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble and puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god um yeah that just it just says it right there and so it's more valuable than than you know comfort and peace and uh actually brother and you said something last week that uh that sort of stuck with me a little bit and that was you know you know christ has won a complete victory for us is complete there's every you know every trial in your life has a due date and even maybe that thorn in the flesh that the lord's left there even that's got a due date like it might be like paul when you pass over but you know it's a total victory there's absolutely nothing that can actually stand you know um and brother just finished that quote um we ask for comfort and peace god gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comfort is just beyond the river it's so easy to say but that is true and um and i was talking to a brother over the weekend and what we were talking about is you know this opportunity that we have on this side that's once in all eternity that we have really and we we can actually the struggles we go through the personal things that we have to push through it's an opportunity you know it can actually it can actually better us and and you know produce something good in our lives so rather than a dreary something that we walk through you know like the personal battles it's actually it can produce something good in our lives and and uh just to close off i just want to say um you know it's going to be worth it all you know you know every time you've got a yeah it's going to be worth it'll win i'm sure once we get to the other side it's um we'll be able to see things a bit more clearly and and yeah we'll be we'll be thankful that the lord took us through all of it so and um yeah i'll keep it short and sweet [Applause] simon amen should we sing that it will be worth it [Music] it all when we see jesus life's triumphs we'll [Music] [Music] so let us run the race it will be worth it all when we see jesus [Music] will seem so small [Music] when we see [Music] oh sorry [Music] so let us it's just our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father lord what a privilege is it is lord to be gathered here in your presence father lord jesus and things that we've heard this morning father of such value to us lord so encouraging father so amazing to see how you're lining it all up father lord i just want to yield my vessel to you now father and ask you'll take complete control father help me to relax and get out of the way father lord and i just pray that you'll speak to every heart your father minister to every need lord jesus lord i pray that there will be deliverance in this place father lord that will all walk out of you with a testimony of what you've done for us lord lord we thank you father we just commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen amen god bless you all well i'm just turned out into our bibles to psalms chapter 119 i woke up with a bit of a croak in my voice this morning so just bear with me it's just was so amazing just listening to the things that were being spoken about by the other brothers it's like mario is saying they've said it all now but i'm basically just going to repeat what was said so it's the same holy spirit amen psalms 119 verse 9. wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to thy word with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against thee blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes with thy lips have i declared all judgments of thy mouth i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches i will meditate in my precepts and have respect unto thy ways i will delight myself in thy statutes i will not forget thy word amen this is partially something that i spoke about a couple of weeks um you don't have to turn the isaiah chapter 26 verse 3 that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee i mean you can take your seats now we are we're the most privileged people on the face of the earth we're gathered here in an atmosphere a special atmosphere that's why we see deliverance that's why we see victory while we see you know we come together and we're so happy is because we create an atmosphere and when you come you bring your lick of fire and all together it it produces a blazing fire you know the law just you know is able to work here because of the atmosphere that we produce and i want to i want to encourage you to stay in the right atmosphere this atmosphere that we have with us we can take it with us when we go back to our daily lives we don't have to let it go we don't have to slum back into what we were before and get it back into the same rut we can take that atmosphere with us and the way to do that is like david is saying here in this in the scripture keep him before your face when you go go back to your work go back to uni back to college to school wherever you go don't forget about the things you heard this weekend keep it before your face think about it meditate on the word stay in fellowship with jesus christ because when you stay in an atmosphere satan is powerless against you when you stay in that right atmosphere and uh excuse me david is saying here you know he delights himself in the lord is god you can you can just look at his life and you can see the stuff that he went through manny you know he comes back to ziklag one day and it's it's burnt to the ground you know his family and everything is stolen and the men want to kill david like how much worse can it get and what did they would do he didn't panic and say oh lord what am i going to do now he delighted himself and the lord is god and that's when the lord came on the scene like you know i believe it's paul and silas when they were stuck in their prison they delighted themselves in the lord they started singing they started worshiping and that atmosphere caused the whole prison to be shaken around them you can create an atmosphere in your life that can set people free around you the brothers and sisters in your life you young people if you go back to your churches and you create that atmosphere take that fire with you you can be the medium that god uses to deliver another person and i want to encourage you to relax and let the holy spirit have its way brother brahman speaks about you know that welsh revival that policeman that you know he was he was the revival and brother brahman says if you could ask him one thing what what what do you need to do to get into this revival he would say relax and let the holy spirit have its way relax and let the holy spirit have its way because when you can do that the lord will work through you the secret to the supernatural is to relax amen so we don't have to try and make everything up you know we don't have to try and strive and make the word come to pass that's not our job that's god's promise it's his job to bring his word to fulfillment in our lives amen and um something mother andy said last week as well it was a real blessing that service by andy um based on a tongue's interpretation was given to one of the messages is your victory lies between faith and joy and that is that is so powerful because the faith lying in your victory lying in faith that comes by resting in jesus christ you just believe god's promise you believe his word and he brings it to pass in your life and joy be happy like brother third he was saying you say be happy you know when you know when everything just comes against you know people your friends are you know angry at you or you know you go back to work and the boss says oh you've messed up you know just be happy be happy don't let that steal your joy because when the devil steals your joy you'll lose your victory because the bible says the joy of the lord is your strength so you just hang on to that joy be happy praise the lord i want to read a quote here i haven't got it up on the um on the powerpoint but uh it's a long long long-ish quote and uh in the message he swore by himself brother muhammad says listen i'm going to say something this is one of my favorite quotes this is so amazing look faith is unconscious amen you believe it i've learned that in the years of travel around the world and meeting the peoples of all different walks faith is unconscious you've got faith and you don't even know it that's right jesus christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gale is knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in a face in a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god said so he didn't say have i prayed through i wonder if i fasted long enough wonder if i did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what god said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he know that his life was to fulfill them amen and we've got a prophecy that's spoken over us and our part is to fulfill that that there's going to be a bride you know that's without spot or wrinkle and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with god hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with god if the neighbor doesn't like you walk with god just keep on walking with god just stay in that atmosphere amen enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with god got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with god doctor says you're going to die walk with god doctor says you can't well walk with god just walk with god that's all for god has promised you i'll never leave you or forsake you i'll never i'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that covenant that he give you that he would confirm it just walk with god then you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you got to go through briar patches over sharp rocks over bluffs down over hillsides up through the mountains over waters by walk with god yes sir there's so many hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way amen my my just look at there all that's been look back at your footprints it won't be very much amen so you just you just i want to encourage you to stay in that right atmosphere you know when satan comes and tries to pull you out of that and you go back to your day-to-day life you know treat every single day as if it's your last day we want to live like christ isn't coming in a thousand years but we want to live like he's coming tomorrow as brother ram said live as if the person that you're dealing with that person that you're trying to encourage live as if it's the last opportunity you'll ever get to speak to that person encourage them like it's the last thing you'll ever be able to say and excuse me we've been we've been given a message of power friends a message of deliverance and it's our job to share that with the world don't keep it to yourself share it share it go out if you you know ram said there was a message that i was listening to last night where a tongue's an interpretation went forth and the brother said you know all the lord said through that brother listen to the world and if you listen you'll hear the cry of those that are bound in chains what we've got is a message of deliverance for those people around us for your brothers and sisters and even in the workplace the way that you treat the people in your workplace can affect their eternal destination consider that go out and share the gospel share this message that we have don't keep it to yourself the joy that you've got this weekend don't keep it to yourself go share it with the world amen we are you know we are god's hands and feet and mouth right now he he chose men to speak with to speak through he could have chosen the rocks he could have chosen the wind to preach the gospel but he chose us and we just want to be that vessel for the lord to carry this message forward amen i'll just leave you with that god bless you [Applause] you get my powerpoint up then we just get hold of it so long you don't have to start it up yet okay so we're kind of getting towards the end of things now end of uh of a camp or not a camp don't get me in trouble this wasn't a camp it was a weekend i'm sorry just excuse me for a moment here so um you know i heard where brother braham said this week once the man twice the child right so what he's saying is we don't ever really grow up inside you just feel the same as as when you were just a little kid so we're going to be little kids now for a moment we can't have youth camp without singing the hallelujah you know the hallelu song so um so actually actually you should have said diane i'm sorry so you you know the drill when you sing hallelujah it's the brothers that stand and when you say when you sing praise you the lord is the sisters that stand okay so let's start by sitting down does everyone know the song okay you'll get to know it soon enough okay so listen carefully because i'm gonna go faster as we go right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise ye the lord right with that last praise you lord is everyone standing okay so you've got it now so let's go again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise he the lord hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah thank you hallelujah praise the lord well done thank you very much i'm glad to see that you are young at heart and that you've got the joy of the lord we won't make you sing the ha ha you can sit down so i just want to take a quick moment just to say thank you very very much for coming you know we can do all the organizing and we can do all those things but if you don't come then there's nothing to have right but also i want to say thank you for the amazing attitude you had it was just absolutely precious from that first time we got together on saturday just a lovely atmosphere i mean even on the you know in the sports center there the way that you treated one another the way that you got involved in things i want to say i really salute you you wonderful wonderful young people and i want to and i want to encourage you and say continue like that we've had our theme scripture for the weekend behold our good and our pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together and and i've seen that happen this weekend and i thank god for that so i want to say as we go out different ways that you know you take that love back to your church homes but don't get in your own little silo you know don't get in your own little between four four walls and shut others out again you know you've made friendships hopefully and these friendships if the lord should tarry will go for years to come and it will be a blessing for years to come now there's something else brother apparently brother freddie said it recently i'm i'm told right so if i'm wrong please forgive me but you know you look at one another as brothers and sisters but there's going to be a point as we heard over the weekend it's okay to look at one another it's more than just brothers and sisters okay we need wives and husbands too so there's friendships that's established and out of friendships also the lord gets relationships and and marriages but also god raises up you know there might be a brother in this church and another brother in another church that's going to be both ministers one day and perhaps pastors one day and so forth and what we want is we want the walls broken down so that we can be one so that we can you know walk all in the same direction pull in the same direction encourage one another and so forth so just a quick thank you or two um firstly thank you so much to all the different brothers that has ministered and also this morning it was a real blessing and and i just want to thank god for that amen and a special thank you to brother ferdi and brother dazzwell and brother adrian also for taking those those services over the of the weekend god bless you briefly and then there was a young lady that uh that i never thanked properly yet um where is tiana right in front of me so she was very instrumental in getting the hoodies prepared and designed and with andy's help also i understand and i think her mums god bless you and i'm just gonna quickly run through as i said i will i will afterwards um thank these people again but there's been so many help musicians that was involved the sisters that did the cooking the brothers involved with the activities um you know just so many different things brothers who helped with the sound people that came in clean the church between the services and moved pews around and all sorts of things god bless you for all of that so we just thank you for all of that and and may the lord richly bless you this there's no way that you can really say thank you for the level of effort that has gone into these things and all we can say is god bless you so now i hope you have a little bit of energy left just to listen to me for a few minutes right so i want to share a little thought with you and as i was laying in bed this morning the lord just placed this on my heart and and i want to know this is not a christmas message but i want to share with you something about the season of giving yeah you know very often you see you know what's it now it's june so in like three or four months we'll start seeing christmas advertisements coming again and you know one of the themes that people put on and and really it's a whole commercial trick but it's the season of giving but that's not what i want to speak about i want to speak about the season of giving for a christian and i want to read this opening scripture wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world stand at lest i make my brother too fiend so what paul is writing here is he's saying that there's that there's certain things that my brother is sensitive about you know in that in that specific chapter paul speaks about you know how some person is their conscience is is more uh sensitive on a specific thing and so forth and paul is saying for the sake of my brother i won't do certain things not to offend for the sake of my sister i won't do certain things not to offend and that is a sacrifice because you know we have liberty we are set free you know we are set free like like um even when you know in the old testament um god gave laws about you know what they were allowed to eat and what not and so forth but then in the new testament god showed that dream to peter and and said you know showed him that don't call uh unclean what god has made clean and so forth and and paul writes about you know even even meat that's been offered to idols now how many of us if someone gives you a plate of food and they tell you this meat has been offered to idols you would feel really awkward about eating it right but the reality is i mean what's the idol it's a dead thing it's nothing right but if the if your conscience bother you then don't do it because your conscience then makes it you can't eat it in faith right so so that's the principle is that when someone's conscience is weak about something then we accommodate them and we and we do certain things and we live in a specific way that we can be a blessing to them and that is what i'm speaking about giving now we're living in the low dc age where everything is about self what i can get what i can gather what i can you know what makes me feel good what and betters me and don't care about the next person it's all about human rights but really every person's problem is my rights i don't care about anyone else's rights i want my rights i want what's good for me i want what's going to benefit me but now let's just let's just take it to the christmas story and i hope this doesn't defend anyone you know i i find that in the message people get so afraid when you speak about christmas right and i was listening over the last few weeks two or three messages that brother branham preached at the end of 1958 around the time of christmas and he says the biggest present that this world ever got the biggest gift that this world ever got was christ and the problem with what we do commercially in christmas today we take all the focus away from it right and we know christmas you know the 25th of december wasn't the birth of christ and so forth we know those things but hey relax don't get uptight about this now the principle is god gave the biggest gift that he could ever give you personally the biggest gift he could give you was to give his life a ransom for yours and mine right when we could not do anything to come back to christ when man had fallen when there was a gap when there was a gulf where there was an incrossable big gulf god came and he crossed that gulf for us and he gave everything for you and for me and we love to be the recipients of that gift we love to be the recipients we love the freedom we love the the benefits we love the power that god has released to his bride to his church because of the gift that he gave us the price that he paid but there was a season in which each one of us received christ received the benefits and and we still permanently every day we depended on the benefits of what the cross paid for right but there's a season in which you and i must give out also we're so quick to receive we're so quick to gather everything we can to ourselves you know have you ever seen a bunch of kids and kids in a lolly scramble you know it's like oh these are mine these are mine stay away you know that kind of thing everything for me but what about the next person we're so quick to gather we're so quick to grab everything we can but if no one is going to give where is the world ever going to see christ if no one is going to give when is your friend sitting next to you in church today ever going to see christ the bible speaks about that story of the man that was forgiven so much and then he turned around and he's you know his fellow man owed him a little bit compared to what he had been you know he he's his big guilt that was taken away the little bit that that person owed him he didn't want to forgive him that and the result was the king said i think it was the king that said you know put him in prison and so forth until he pays all even in the lord's prayer it says help me to forgive others as i forgive my debtors sorry if you forgive my dad says i forgive as i forgive others you see the bible says we freely received but we should also freely give the gospel that we've received is not just for ourselves the reality is when we are filled with the holy spirit the whole purpose of god giving you and me the holy spirit is to be a blessing to others is to put you in use for his church is to use the gifts that if he's placed in your life for others and sometimes it means that you suffer sometimes it means that you go through hard times because people don't always want to receive what you have people sometimes people can really really hurt you when you're actually trying to do good to them and the more needful people are the more hurtful they become and it takes god's grace to look beyond that attitude and see the need in that person's heart you see we sing about god he looked beyond my faults and saw my knee but what about us now it's our season of giving can we look beyond the faults of the next person and see the need in their heart can we look beyond that can we try and pull others up instead of pushing them down so that we can be lifted higher you know you see that so often in the workplace in the corporate environment i've seen that heaps i've seen how people just back bite and cut one another i've seen i worked for a company where in the company there was like five or six different business units and they set it up deliberately that the business units competed with each other in order to get the biggest bonuses well what a mess because they were just they they would even like do things that that would um you know be negative to the company where they would talk bad to the customers against the other business units and stuff like that so that their business unit can look better and it in the end it doesn't benefit the company and it's the same we see among christians if you are honest with yourselves brothers and sisters how many times have you pointed out the the faults and the failures in others to take away the attention from the fact that you were battling how often but god's way is for us to reach out to others to help others god's way is for us to lift others up to the bible speaks about how we prefer one another in other words let the other one get the better deal it's the other one sometimes you can do something and someone else walks away with the glory and then we can blow up like a big bullfrog eight buckshot as brother branham said you know but but so what god sees it i know it's humanly speaking it's not easy and emotionally speaking you know it can be tough for those things people can be unfair and so on but i want to say give the best to others give the benefit to others something else i want to say is god doesn't waste pain now write this in your hearts as deep as you can god never wastes pain if god allows pain through you know several of the brothers even this morning has spoken about how god allows trials and testings and things like that brother marion are finished with that so beautifully when we ask for peace god sends trials and tribulations why well there's two purposes one is god forms your character with it god changes your life god shows you how much you need him and so forth and you you draw closer to him but the second thing is when god allows you and me to go through things what happens is when the next person goes through it next time then you can be a blessing to them then you can really put yourself in their shoes i want to make the statement though and that is that most people are not willing to actually put themselves in other people's shoes most people are just not interested in seeing the other person's side of things they just want what's good for them what they can get out of it but it's the season of giving and i i i want to nearly say it this way that when you are baptized with the holy ghost when you are filled with the holy ghost that's your season of giving that's when god wants to take the gifts in your life and not lift you up but be a blessing to the next person if you've got a gift of singing if you've got a gift of cooking if you've got a gift of loving if you've got a gift of being friendly if you've got a gift of preaching whatever it is god wants to use the gift in your life to be a blessing to others not to lift you up it's clear the biblical principle is if we want to be going up we're going to need to go down humble yourselves before the lord be as little as you can brother braham says it over and over be as little as you can that literally you can get god will lift you up in his time amen but give the best to others render your gifts for others to benefit from it so i want to make these things just a little more practical so you can kind of relate to it and and and i'm sure you've all seen this stuff right you get one one person they finish primary school i don't know what you call them here is primary school primary school finish primary school and they go to intermediate right so they are intermediate now now their best friend is still in primary school three months older than them but they just you know fell in the next year and now suddenly they say i can't be a friend anymore because i'm in the intermediate school right have you ever experienced that kind of stuff i mean you get it in different in all sorts of walks of life right and then suddenly i am the big one now i'm better than you no that's the time to draw that one up to encourage that one and say just hang on just one year and you're with me and then we can continue let's stay friends and let's make that person feel like they're important living for others a season of giving because we so want to feel that we're the big one and the thing is the reality is i found out in life and i'll give you that from my own perspective you get to in south africa we had standard five which is the you know the last year of primary school and you the guy you know you think you've arrived and all these little baby you know little ones and then the next year you go to high school he doesn't have intermediate schools and then you the baby again and all you want to be is the matric the you know the standard 10 guy the oldest ones in high school you want you want to be like them because you know that's the place you want to arrive at and when you get there then you kind of think you you're the business and the next year you go to college or varsity or or apprenticeship or whatever it is and again you nothing and then you go and study and then you know by your you finish your studies and you think i have arrived i'm going to conquer the world i know it all and you walk into the workplace and you're the rookie you're the nothing again right and then you think oh my if i can just have that position you know and the reality is we never arrive okay but we can make the walk for each other so much easier by pulling each other up by reaching out to others but is it easy to say it but can you do that instead of saying i have this you don't have it yet so i'm better than you rather encourage that person draw them in with you pull them up with you take them on board right i'm going to say something that brother steve brisson is has made this comment and it's stuck with me he says the christian army is the only army that kills the wounded soldiers because they are embarrassed of them now listen to this someone is struggling spiritually we cut them off because it makes the church look bad or it makes the family look bad or come on that's a soldier that's a brother that's a sister right let's reach out to each other let's encourage let's take hands write our theme scripture for the weekend was how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together and of course it goes for sister in too okay right but the thing is before we even look outside our own church boundaries if if i want to use that term look at your closest friend are you really encouraging them are you really helping them or you're just cutting them down and undermining them and making life as hard as possible for them and you know jealous of each other and all sorts of rubbish like that who's that helping it's not helping you and it's not helping them and it's actually working against the kingdom of god but let's enter by god's grace a season of giving will you sacrifice yourself will you humble yourself and i'm going to say this to you brothers and sisters and i want you to listen to this and remember it because human beings are wired this way the more insecure you are in yourself the more you want to feel important and you want to lift yourself up but the more confident and secure someone is in their position in god the more you can humble yourself and you don't need to try to be nothing so when someone is trying to put you down realize they've got the problem not you they are the one that's insecure and pray for them don't get angry at them when they put you down pray for them because they are the needy one amen i trust something was said that that you can take with you but let's as we go away from you let's look at others knees before our own i can't remember which of the brothers said it over the weekend as soon as we start fig focusing on other people's needs our own needs just you know smooth out so much easier because we're not staring at our need all the time amen god bless you richly and let's stay in touch i think i sent a notification out this morning please load up some photos on that on that google photo thing and um keep on sharing but remember we won the bride is one okay let's not just go each one to our own corner and then you know the auckland church is better than the stratfor church or the wanganui church is better than the wellington church or i mean come on what rubbish is that it's not a competition we body okay we won we want to draw closer we want to lift each other up let's rather say if we're in the stretch for church yeah the auckland church is way better praise god but we want to be like them my dream is to be able to song lead like brother tazewell amen praise god but let the lord like brother stephen said this morning let god use each one of us how he's made us we're all different last thought um i just was thinking of that when i think it was when brother joseph was ministering this morning brother greg alford he uh he coined the phrase that i really enjoyed and each one of us have a unique thumbprint okay and with god each one of us is someone special so brother greg he he coined this this phrase he said you're a thumb body with god right each one of you are a somebody with god so as you go away this weekend remember i am a thumb body with god like that song they sang this morning you know god ran to you you know all of us reach a point in our lives where we're a prodigal son we're a prodigal daughter but god loves you whether you feel his love right now or not he loves you whether you whether you want to believe that or now or not whether you're going through hard trials god loves you and you're a somebody with god i wonder if we can stand together wow look at that 2 minutes to 12. let's just pray and i want to say if you've got a need in your heart this morning of whatever type you can express it to the lord with an uplifted hand and we'll pray together now precious father lord jesus i thank you lord father we thanked so many different people but we want to thank you lord thank you for your presence through this weekend thank you for providing for us thank you lord jesus for the energy and the vision and lord jesus thank you for ministers and pastors that have supported this time father we pray that you will bless everyone lord but bless this young people father for for being here and for good attitudes and thank you for a lovely atmosphere father our gardeners we go our different ways now we pray that you will be with us god i pray that lord you've seen the many hands that were lifted up before you now i pray that you will answer that you will heal that you will encourage and you will provide father i pray that you will establish relationships between each other and between us and you draw us to you father there's a heart this morning that feels discouraged lord i pray that you are encouraged our god help us as a christian army lord not to kill our wounded soldiers but to care for them to dress their wounds to bring them to you in prayer father oh lord jesus we appreciate you so much and we ask these things in the most precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen thank you lord i'll just announce quickly before we close off so we're going to have lunch at the war memorial hall where we had our lunch and tea on
