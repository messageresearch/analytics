much for everyone that's contributed in every way it was a real neat those as Sunday school kids have a were able to put together that song item so that was that was really special thank you very much for that for everyone who was involved I mean god bless you richly so I'd like to greet everyone this morning in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Sunday morning again it's just amazing how quickly these weeks fly past and another week done and tomorrow's is a statutory holiday and I think there's very few people that it's gonna actually affect at the moment given our current circumstances but I trust that that we that we're all having a place of time with our families and so forth so I I'm so excited to have brother Eugene preach for us this morning he he's got the easy end of the bargain though for him it's four o'clock in the afternoon or something similar and so it's not quite that for that in terms of I had to get up at 3 o'clock last weekend at 3 o'clock in the morning but either way that's not what it's about we're just looking forward to to a place a time today and just just trust that that God will give us a good time together around his word and that the Lord will bless us with his presence and that we will that that her brother has the freedom to to minister but the Lord puts on his heart and that the Lord has something for us I believe he does and I'm excited about it I just really looking for brother Eugene mentioned to me yesterday that that he hears fresh inspiration the ludus has laid something very specific on his heart and and that's that's wonderful and we just excited about that so we have a couple of free requests I had a contact from brother Shabazz Eden Pakistan who he sent me some pictures of a young girl in the in the church she's in hospital with infection in her intestines and asked if we could keep her in pray so we want to take her to the Lord this morning I mean say she's in a real bad condition and then also brother mark that friend of mine back in South Africa it seems like the the situation with him is he's getting quite quite negative from a natural perspective and so just to to put you in the picture a little bit so it's now nearly three weeks ago that he went in and he was gonna have that operation so because of the coronavirus stuff going on his wife wasn't allowed to go to the hospital with him so he had the operation well in fact his wife wasn't even sure whether he was going to have the operation they because I don't know if you remember but he's his heart wasn't going to be in the right place to to take operation and things like that and then she got a phone call from the doctor the next day that the operation went well and then for four I think two and a half weeks or more she didn't hear anything she couldn't find him they switched his phone off she didn't even know where they had his phone with him or nothing and just could not get hold of them she found the doctors she found that the hospital just couldn't get through couldn't get any information out of him and then they discharged him they or two ago and it seems like he's is very incoherent now and my understanding is and this might be wrong with my understanding is that he's not even able to communicate properly with the family or anyone so he's in a he's not in a in a good situation obviously the families he's going through a hard time as well so if we can just like take those requests the Lord this morning and and just trust that the Lord will step on the scene I mean we we excited to see to see that the Lord will will undertake folding so so if you have a need on your heart this morning you can also make it known to the Lord as we take it to the Lord in prayer now precious and loving father although Jesus you are so good to us Lord Father and we're so thankful Lord - for you making an opportunity Lord for making this available for us to be able to come to you this morning father into no law that you are the same year and there and every wave father oh Jesus you also the same yesterday today and forever Lord father and your Holy Spirit is with her brother Eugene right now

have for us God we commit the service into your hands now and we pray it in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord well I I have a real excitement in my heart this morning I can't brother Eugene as a very close friend and a precious brother and I've probably learned more from him than from any other brother in terms of just sharing different things and so on and I just really highly regard him we also had wonderful fellowship with him last year when we visited Canada and just really appreciate my brother brother Eugene you just like your liberty and and just goes through all these you so brother Eugene I'm gonna and over to you now and just just just let the Lord have his way god bless you my brother hey maybe Saints it's good to be with you here this afternoon and it's a special time to be able to have fellowship together via via these [Music] and man's a type of what God has always been right now I'm in halfway around the world and I've got an instrument in my hand at SAP that sends a signal to a satellite and that satellite may send it to one or two or three more and then it sends it down to your home from my home to your home but we know that the satellite is only a type of what God already had a long time ago because God is these satellites that can download the revelation to any home personally he would like to I've been very very happy to be with you today brother all riously loves us more than I love you because he got up in the middle of the night spoke for us last last Sunday and for me it's Saturday in the afternoon so he's made a bigger sacrifice than I have but having said all of that I really appreciate your past you very much he's a genuine pastor he has a genuine pastor's heart and I certainly enjoyed the revelation in his life and learned much from him certainly to learn much from him I just want to say God bless the church this morning I have very fond memories very fond memories of of the time that we spent with you over there very personal fond memories and I want to just say God bless you from our church and our fellowship over here it's a wonderfully wonderful to be part of the same family of God I'm in my church office today hope everything comes to clear my only problem I think I'm going to have is that I hope I don't go too long so that I end up wearing you all out here this morning but what we could do maybe I like to be able to take a thought this morning that the Lord has led me to and I hope I can express it correctly and be able to express it properly this morning the thing of it is it's not a matter of how much to get on to be able to preach that problem I have is to take pay off of the fork not to put hay back on the fork because sometimes I don't know where to leave all the material that God inspires you to I certainly enjoyed all this many school children oh well having part in that presentation and the special this morning it was very very good and it was very good to see the family of God still operating as a family I have many fond memories I remember going with brother John to that bull sail with his son that was a special time for me spending time in your different homes and present so I've got some very good fond fond memories so this morning here I'd like to take a thought on the invisible union of the heavenly groom and an earthly bride knowing that we're in a wonderful wonderful junction of time we're in a secret movement of God is moving his program along and we're at an intersection in his program and God has hid these things from the church world so to speak but reveal them to his sweetheart to his bride I just want to again say that I really appreciate your pastor his family all in the prime of youth with the prime of Revelation in their hearts moving from glory to glory we had a wonderful time with his daughter we just actually rode horseback this morning with my granddaughter's together with my granddaughter's I have evidence that your pastor is also a Methodist that he's like John Wesley he has spent some time on horseback so we've got evidence of that that he's also part of the sanctification ministry there's a picture of his beautiful daughter that we had this wonderful time with but we've also got some other young people that spent time with us from your church they there they're still young at heart and they're certainly looking for adventure and they've got you got many many wonderful wonderful memories together with them also a motorbike yet but that could happen who knows so we've talked about young and hard to there they're probably going to end up back over here to get even with me after all these pictures but we'll certainly enjoy them back over here for sure this is the best picture of all right over here this is our our sister deacon over here taken over the church she's gonna take over the whole church I'm so wonderful good to see you my brothers good to see you so we're gonna take a short thought if I Lord willing on on on this topic the invisible union of the heavenly groom and the earthly bride and I like to just take and remind us that God is privileged us as the husband and the wife will often have a secret language between them me and my wife we're sitting across the table from each others and there could be you know 10 15 people at the table but if my wife gives me a certain looker I give her a certain looker a certain nod both her and I know exactly what that means and we have developed a secret relationship between us secret language between us based on relationship and it's that relationship that actually holds the language and I like to talk about the same kind of an effect between Christ and the bride where the groom and the bride they developed a secret language between them based on a relationship and so uh for starters this morning I'd like to take your Bible that you would in turn to revelations chapter 8 in your Bible revelations chapter 8 very familiar to all of us but certainly a key for the bride this morning and so I just want to again just take the thought this morning that God is doing something very very special for us and he and and in all of that he's hiding the things that he is revealing to the bride and that he's developed a protocol that the bride will catch it for the sisters for the young people today at don't wanna spit out I don't want this to be a intellect but I wanted to be a real practical thought this morning that we can see the bigger picture of what the the time we're living in I talked to spur the Steve Brussels this morning and it's very interesting all the brothers and sisters that I've talked to in the last couple of two three months over here with this virus thing with this plague that's been unleashed on our world and how that it has brought the whole world economy it's very interesting how that it to them escape the world is nervous the world is running around and feared trying to find answers bride wise the bride has no problem with being able to reconcile what is going on over here so I will just read from revelations chapter 8 verse 1 this this this morning for you revelations 8:1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of 1/2 an hour and I'd like to read a little bit further than that and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them was given seven trumpets so in verse three and another angel this would be the eighth angel means another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer so now we realized that this is a very special angel with the special office and he is in the holiest in the holy stock of in the tabernacle and the type and there was given unto Him much incense and we know that's at the incense also with the prayers of the Saints that he should offer it up with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne so he's at a particular spot and he's going to step into the holiest of Holies but before he gets in there he has to have he has to make the preparations for all these things and the smoke on the guttenberg and the smoke of the incense which came from the with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand and the angel took the censer filled it with the fire off the altar and cast it to the earth and there was voices and thunders and lightnings and earthquakes so all I want you to understand this morning is that at the same time when the seventh seal opens it also causes a disruption of nature or an effect on the earth if I can use that term it causes at the same time a destructive effect on the earth now let's just take and while after we've read that let's just take and bow our heads and just ask God for I want to find that channel for us this morning that I believe that the Lord gave us first Heavenly Father we buy or hearts before you and I bow my heart before you and humility I pray you give me the supernatural guidance through the Scriptures that the Scriptures could become real and the Scriptures could do the talking I pray for the audience that hears that we could be tuned into the heavenly Channel and to leave this earthly realm to catch your thoughts I bring you download your thoughts into our hearts this morning I pray in your word to give us eternal life in your name we pray amen amen well god bless you this morning I'd like to start off this morning and I'm going to spend a little bit of time and trying to lay a good foundation so that when we move into the scriptures that we all catch the same thing so we have a good foundation this morning I'm gonna Rita a bunch of quotes at first but my thought this morning is that seven seal secret the secret communication between the husband and the wife the seventh seal secret communication between the husband and the wife so we'll read first of all some close I'd like to read this morning and this I found this astounding the other day when I was telling the church this now God cannot make anybody believe and board that struck me this morning God can't make anybody believe he so respects your free moral agency even if he knows you're gone and fighting your way to hell which we know that the believers they have to fight their way to hell go against everything god is that that even if he sees you going the wrong direction you're fighting your way to hell that God can't make anybody believe and I thought my that's astounding and then the next line is even more astounding God can only reveal himself in different forms so it's amazing God can't make us believe and the only thing God can do is reveal himself and he reveals himself many many many different ways let's just read a little bit more he can only reveal himself four different forms he has revealed himself in the wind in the mysterious movements and so forth in the form of angels he has revealed himself in his revealed himself in man by preaching the gospel he's revealed himself in times of trouble to the people revealing himself in times of trouble and sometimes he has to take a loved one sometimes to bring the heart of the person to the acknowledgment of God I find it amazing because when I think of my children for instance I can't make my children believe believe that I'm their dad but the best I can do is reveal myself in the fact that I am their dad and you know revelation is an amazing thing revelation is not information revelation is also not an explanation revelation is much much deeper than that we know revelation is faith there's different descriptions of revelation but a revelation lots of times will come to you when you're not studying when you're relaxed when nothing when you're not under pressure then God will reveal himself to you revelation is very interesting how it comes to you even in droves case old was looking for the evidence of the resurrection and yet every year the flower would would rise in spring would give its glory to the earth would die and fall and then next spring the flower would come up again so the flower was preaching a resurrection message to Joe but job didn't have the key to unlock the encrypted message that the flower was trying to preach to job so the job couldn't get the message of the flower though the flower was preaching to him every single year Mary often you know God reveals himself in our family lights for instance when our children are coming into the world as a baby they come in under complete innocence they have no fear they're one with the world as far as they're concerned the world loves them they have no boundaries of fear and separation but then the children go from age two to age 12 and then they'd be cool through the Ox age and they learn to have mom and Ella dad's identity because they don't have none of their own under the Ox age then the children go to the manage from puberty to the time of twenty-one years old or eighteen maybe and then they learn in the manage their own identity they learn how they feel themselves not what mom and dad are but what they are there for you also find after that they see when they buying that predestinated mate that God has for them then they they step into the Eagle age they set step into a secret union between husband and wife and then they become creators they first were a creation but now when they meet their mate they become a creator and now they create children now they're responsible for those children's redemption so in all of those things God's preaching his mystery for us I like to Rita another call here if we could and it's interesting now that we know that all that God can do is reveal himself now we find ourselves in the first purpose of that seventh seal because remember the first purpose was to reveal himself and the more that Christ reveals himself through the many different forms in the healing lines brother branham would stand sit on stage brother branham would sit on stage and then he would and then he would say you know what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for him to come if he'll come if he'll come then then we can continue with the healing so God was revealing himself God was revealing himself yeah unplug it yeah God was revealing himself on stage through healing that he was there he was actually there so all of that regard revealing himself we know what it would do is it would take and we would earn his preeminence because God revealed himself he earned his right and we wanted to give him preeminence because he revealed himself and we know that result of that would be to restore the kingdom so let's just go back a little bit do a little takeaway remember when God can make you a believer and number two all God can do is reveal himself you look at the Ministry of the Son of Man ministry in our day it's amazing that the more I fed on the Word of God in in in the prophets ministry the son of man in the prophets ministry the more I wanted to give him preeminence he definitely earned my respect will read a little bit more because there's a whole mystery involved that Paul was aware of that he knew that he had to keep secret and that he knew was going to be made fully revealed in the end time because remember Paul's ministry was the prophecy of the fulfillment of the seventh angels ministry so Paul's ministry mirrored the seventh angels ministry and Paul knew that he had to keep the secret way back 2,000 years ago he had to put it in mystery form so Paul said things like this now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel think of how many preachers they were preaching in Paul's day but he knew that he had the only one that could establish the bride according to his gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began so think Paul knew this secret before the foundations of the world and he was the only one that knew that secret let's read a little bit more and I want to make a point here so we understand the angel the effect of the angel in our instead of via some of the uhh uh facing in enough or day to see once we see Paul's ministry then we will also see then we will also see the Angels ministry and our day also just a minute over here you so Paul knew this secret that was kept before the foundations of the world and he'll say things like he'll be amazing with some of the things that he will say so he said this he said Ephesians 3:9 to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery so I want to stop there this is good this where it gets good you mean to tell me this mystery wants fellowship that's exactly what I'm saying it's wonderful this secret that Paul knew was from before the foundation of the world that secret mystery wants fellowship to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery Ephesians 39 which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God which had been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers and heavenly places remember in heavenly places he might be made known by the church to the manifold wisdom of God and I don't want that to sound complicated I just want you to realize that Paul he recognized that that mystery from before the foundation of the world that mystery wanted fellowship and and is looking for somebody to have fellowship with so again just thinking along the lines of Paul hiding the secret which was going to be revealed in our day in mark 4:11 the Bible says and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but unto them that or all these things are done in parables ah I find that fascinating for myself personally I was raised in a minute night home with none of God in it at all we were raised as worldly as can be we were raised without God as can be ah but I like I say this to you it is given to know the mystery you didn't earn it you didn't get it cuz you're in a good bloodline you didn't get it because you were a good person you didn't get it because you you you did anything to attract God's attention God looked in the Lamb's Book he saw your name he chose you and he decided that I'm gonna let you know the mystery that was secret before the foundation of the world this whole thing is God 100% choosing you picking you up picking you up and showing you his secrets from before the foundations of the world that's 100% what this thing is and so to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but what to the rest of the world he speaks in parables Wow to the rest of the world the Bible is Bible story Sunday school stories a book of morals but to the bride now we understand that this Bible is actually the book that Adam lost this Bible actually is the lamb's book section in the book of life and God has revealed that to us to show us that he treats that we are his bride and we have secret communication between husband and wife let's just read a little bit more here this morning if we can brother Branham says some amazing amazing amazing things in trying to show us that we are special in God's economy revelation is the previously hidden truth but now it's divinely revealed and I'm going to go to us because this is all building a foundation to try to get us to understand that there's a secret communication the seventh seal is encrypted and the reason we encrypt something is to keep out unauthorized access now think of it we have email these days that we there's encrypted email and the purpose of it it is so that unauthorized access can't get access to the email and that's what the seventh seal is God encrypted the seventh seal and we know that the the Bible now here's the difference the Bible is not just a record a book of Revelation it actually is the revelation it is the book that Adam lost when he fell on the garden and that Bible that has our name in it because remember I'll get to this later that this Bible isn't just a story about God or about revelation this Bible itself is the book that Adam lost the mystery of Christ in the book itself even the way is constructed is a mystery and we know that when Adam lost a book which we hold in our hands not just the physical ink on paper whether we're talking about the book of life that Adam lost it held three things number one it held the correct relationship with God number two it held the dominion over all of nature and number three it held eternal life itself so we find out that this Bible is a special special book written in a certain way for a certain people and and we find out that this Bible also contains the revelation that there's a supernatural communication of truth to the soul the Bible itself communicates truth and not just ink on paper because president says remember the secret of God is written between the lines not on the lines between the lines it's secret communication and we know that revelation is faith and the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed form that will be received by the bride the Bible is not just the Word of God but it's actually the thoughts of God because remember thoughts first we were God's thought first then became word so the Bible isn't just God's Word the Bible is a transfer of God's thoughts and that has been held secret and it's represented those thoughts are representativeness garment in the red that that Rahab had the seventh seal is written between the lines and it's like a jigsaw puzzle you know when you do a jigsaw puzzle you can put a couple of five seven pieces together my wife loves puzzling you got a puzzle table at the end of our table the sisters come over to our house and all of a sudden half of them they don't even go for coffee they sit down to the jigsaw puzzle table I'm there pretty soon they got all their hands on that puzzle down there and they're all talking like crazy as this picture becomes into formation I remember when did you take a jigsaw puzzle what do you do you do the outside first because that has the lines you can recognize most the time you do the sky first because that's all blue you put all the black pieces in one spot and all the Reds in another spot now you can put four or five pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together and you say wow look at that I've got these four pieces together but you know what that still doesn't form the whole picture the Seventh Seal is actually the picture that the jigsaw puzzle becomes when you put the pieces together right and those pieces you can't you know like but I get it too a jigsaw puzzle I'll put pressure on it because I make these two pieces come together that's the way I see some preachers they take two scriptures and they make them come together but it doesn't reflect the picture of Jesus Christ under that seventh seal when they're done so just thinking of that thought I want to bring you another thought and again I don't want to sound intellectual that's not my purpose today but but we we know that the Bible is formulated in a certain way and that Bible we've had six church ages and then there's a gap if you read your Bibles there's an open door between the 6th and 7th church age and the same thing with the seals there's six seals and there's a gap between the 6th and the 7th church seal the same thing with the trumpets if you take your Bibles there are 6 trumpets in a row then there's a gap or an interval between the 6th and 7th trumpet and the same thing happens in the vials if you go from your Bibles you find there's two major events between the sixth and seventh vial in your Bibles and it's done this way for a reason I want you to just notice this is done for a reason because president says the mystery is in the interval you don't find brother but I'm talking about the interval said after the seals are open and again I don't want to sound complicated but I just want you to see a pattern over over here that there's an interval between the 6th and the 7th in all cases and the mystery of all of these things the secrets that they hold is wrapped up and centered 7th under voices in Revelations 10 4 so the seventh under voices in Revelations 10 4 reveals all of these things and it's a secret communication and the bride will catch it why these things are the way that they are it's a wonderful lesson of the revealing of the secret to the bride like to just read a couple of more quotes I'm I'm finding myself a little bit long here already but to understand that Paul he had the secret to the mystery that the seventh angel was going to be able to reveal because remember through 2000 years those secrets were going to be kept away or hidden for 2,000 years have to happen in our day to reveal what Paul knew and the mystery that Paul had I want to stop just a little bit I have four years I want to make a confession here to you today for years when I came to this message I was marvel ah by the Son of man ministry but I didn't know the son of man ministry I just knew God sent a prophet and I loved listening to the tapes and for years I preached the quotes but the truth of it is for years I couldn't make the picture come together I want to confess to you today that for years there's quotes that the prophet spent time on that I stayed away from it didn't make sense to me and then to make it worse one of the things that happened is there have been some ministry that came along and they actually distorted the truth in some of those quotes and that kind of made me gun-shy I stayed away from many of those things but as time went on I realized I was missing a key to unlock so many beautiful secrets in the scriptures and I had it stop back pull myself out and just take another look at this and what I realized and let me just speak to you personally a little bit one of the things that helped me spiritually junk or forced me out of my comfort zone or push me to another level was a couple of seven eight years ago I wonder why it is that the scoffers we knew that scoffers had to come no problem but I was wondering why did the scoffers attack the cloud the first thing that made no sense to me they weren't there they didn't even know anybody personally that was there and yet it was interesting to me how the scoffers in the gainsayers and the Korra's and the Balaam's rolls up inside the message and the first thing they did attack something that had been proven scientifically proven by camera proven and they would attack something like that and what that did is that told me there's something about that that the devil hates that I think I'm missing after a while it was interesting to me how that after a while when they attacked the cloud and yet Jesus said in acts 1 he said the way you see me go up is the way you're going to see me come down and I was wondering my goodness that means if they had been there if they had been standing there in acts 1 and see Jesus go up in a cloud they'd have probably been some of the 380 remember there is 500 saw him go up but when it was done there's only 120 that obeyed the voice the instructions and went to the upper room that means there was 380 they saw the cloud and they turned her onto walked away and they said ah that's nothing and it's interesting to me how that now when Christ fulfilled exactly what he said he would do he made himself known in that cloud proving ancient of days was coming to the Son of man the junction between the son of man of the Ancient of Days the junction between Daniel 7 and revelations 114 and we're living in that Junction and don't recognize and appreciate the effect ancient of me in the Ancient of Days coming to the Son of man in our day how blind we are to think that we're looking for something in the future and don't realize it's already happened in the past say this my precious friends I had a person come to me a while ago and say oh look at this world a sort of control I can hardly wait till Jesus comes something inside of me just stood up and said not me I can hardly wait till he leaves because he's here already under the sixth seal under the tribulation seal under the interruption of nature think of it the interruption of political systems the interruption of finance the interruption of nature the sixth seal he is here under the sixth seal proving he's here revealing himself in the word giving us the third pull evidence that he's here and people are saying oh I can hardly wait till he comes I say to you brothers I can hardly wait till he leaves because once he leaves I'm going with him because remember he comes three times the first time to redeem his bride the next time to get his bride and the third time we're coming back with him with the bride think of that we're in the second full part of his people coming and I'm not waiting for him to come I'm waiting for him to leave because he's already come and that's why they hate that cloud cuz the cloud is the evidence that he is here doing exactly what he said he was going to do praise the Lord the bride is the only one that knows the secret coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in this coming he comes calling your name personally he's not coming calling the church name everybody in that church he's not calling coming calling a group he's coming calling your name personally watch the secret what's the secret of the seven sealed and drawn seven and eight remember when Jesus came to Mary and Martha and Lazarus his friends that had already been nurturing the message under the criticism of the scribes and Pharisees under the judgment I of the religious world they've been nurturing the message made flesh the Christ made flesh remember when Lazarus died that Jesus he waited till the fourth day haha remember the fourth stage is the resurrection stage remember Ezekiel 36 what's the first stage prophesized son of man can these bones live so it starts off with a resurrection prophecy then what happens then the bone comes to bone stage 1 the sinews come to sin use stage 2 the skin comes stage 3 but yet there's no life all you have is uh created being but no life but the fourth stage says come win give life thou shall prophesy again the second time remember the fourth state is the resurrection stage prophesy again and it stood up to be a mighty great army and it starts off with prophecy can your family live your family may be dead in sin and trespasses but it starts off with somebody prophesying can your family live yes Lord thou knowest well then the Lord said will you prophesy you speak to the bones you speak to the sinew you speak to the skin you prophesy again and call for life a pastor might be looking at his church his church might be spiritually dead living in the first six seals and not in the seventh seal and the body is there to sing you is there the bones are there the skin is there but there's still no 7c a life in the church and then God will look at the pastor and he'll say prophesy and then the pastor speaks the seventh seal and the seventh seal gives the life to the church it's the fourth stage and here Jesus in the seventh seal type so that we catch this catch this he waits till the fourth day till the Eagle stage lion Hawks mani go wait till that body is good and dead the debtor the greater the miracle but it takes somebody to speak speak the words speak to seventh seal Christ is here breathe life into that body and remember how happens in the first remember to look at the secret of the resurrection look at the seventh seal in that chapter and Jesus goes to the tomb and he says Lazarus come forth you know why he called Lazarus name because if he hadn't a said Lazarus come forth it would have caused the whole Old Testament Saints to come out of the grave that would have been the general resurrection but remember this resurrection that we're in right now is a secret resurrection a name called resurrection when God calls your name personally to the resurrection the general resurrection will come at the end of the millennium when all the sea will give up the dead and the earth will give up the dead and every soldier that died on a burning ship through all the wars and all the men that died in the civil wars from the beginning from Jesus Christ day through the two thousand those will all rise in the general resurrection to the white throne judgement but remember before that resurrection there is a secret resurrection to the elect and Jesus went to Lazarus's tomb and he said Lazarus come forth and Lazarus heard his name in the secret resurrection and he came forth and when he came forth Jesus told the servants lose him in other words take off all those dead clothes and loose him in the secret resurrection and look I'll read it to you that I'm getting ahead of myself but I'll read it to you brother Brendan they asked brother Branham a question brother branham how's the bride gunas bride going to get a new name and brother bum says yeah but he's going to call you first he says the bride the God doesn't call ormond level Li veil william branham called you by your earthly name how does God call you he calls you by revealing a mystery opening a secret and when you catch that secret that is the calling of your name showing that you're eligible for the private resurrection praise the Lord God's calling your name personally how is he doing that by showing you a secret inside the scriptures to you it is given to know the mysteries of God what a resurrection that was 2,000 years ago brother Branham said in the rising of the Sun but then he said what a resurrection this causing life to come again now let me just get back to this to this secret that Paul held brother Branham says this this is the contest now and remember this is 6212 showing that how he's stepping into another segment of his ministry that the bride will catch and understand help us Lord forgive us I pray thee raise up mighty raise up mighty warriors of the faith open this year Lord the hidden manna now let me stop they remember who open the hidden manna remember there was public mana that felt publicly for the children of Israel but then there was hidden manna private manna that was in the ark reserved for priests alone not so now brother Branham is saying Lord that hidden manna that rock beneath the rock that revelation underneath the revelation that we could see the program of God what's the result of eating the hidden manna what's the result of the rock beneath the rock and that is that we can see the program of God the whole program from Genesis 1 to revelations 22 only for the elect sake cap off the pyramids of our lives of our life Lord put on the capstone Jesus Christ upon every and each and every one of us we find out that we also see here that in the seventh seal again I don't want to sound intellectual is not about being intellectual I just want this to be plain and easy to be understood I remember let me read this first there are city things that goes with it one unfolded yesterday the one unfolded today and the other one yesterday and today and there's one thing that couldn't interpret because it was an unknown language but I stood right there and I looked straight at it this is the third pull coming up and then he says that's the reason that heaven was silent that's the reason that heaven was silent one place he said why was heaven silent because God left heaven everything stopped and God came down to this earth in 63 and the form of that cloud and now he is here rearranging the whole environmental political financial world and he's also uniting that's the secret coming that the bride knows the world knows the church world knows nothing about this and then remember he said that's I better stop right there I just feel checked not to say anything right there and there's a reason for that I find myself that it is the more time goes on the more I'm becoming aware of what the prophets thoughts were and how that he could articulate those thoughts now think of it God sent us a prophet he had to send and speak both to the false vine and the true vine remember the false line they got the first and second pull they got the healing and they got the discernment but the bride got more than that Street God and of the heeling remember this when the Eliezer came to get Rebekah eleazar's family brothers they got the gifts but Isaac but Rebecca Isak think of what a predicament the Prophet was in he loved the people and he had displayed the first and second pole and he wanted them to get it he explained many many spiritual secrets trying to convince the people to give them a revelation but remember God can't make you a believer all can do all God can do is reveal himself and because the brother brands love for the people he tried to explain the spiritual status that he was in and every time he did that it caused the counterfeit all of a sudden you had preachers with blood out of their hands you had women with all kinds of suits saying things people running after and it had created such a counterfeit that it caused a huge confusion because of the counterfeit will now the cloud came and he knew who that was now remember when Ahab got to the throne in 1960 when JFK got to the throne remember now he realized he better open more of the word so he opened the church ages remember he also recognized that God was on the move and changing from intercessor to judge now let me let me stop my brushless brothers and sisters so often because of our rejection complex when we think the word judge we feel condemned and guilty the judges here but what we've got to realize is the judge is the one that can annul your sentence and that can say forgiven he's the one that can say destroy your past records he's the one that puts a gavel down and pronounces you're free so the term judge to the bride isn't something we're scared of actually the truth of it is we love the fact that the judge is here because he's the only one that can take and clean up our record he's the only one that can do that and remember that Christ through the church ages was an intercessor interceding for us but in our generation he's turned from intercessor to judge and that junction is a relief to the bride it's a good day that the judges hear it's a wonderful thing that we've got God now as judge proclaiming the bride sinless and spotless and giving the bride the the the confidence that she needs I want you to notice that brother varanasi and 19th recognized the junction in God's economy sixty he already recognizes there's many things changing real fast and in nineteen sixty in the Patmos vision he says this he's the judge now come to judge the nation's Oh for that day when you see him like like that like he is look at his hair his hair is white of snow Daniel saw him coming to the Ancient of Days watch those two blend together all right watch those two blend together then later on this is 1960 think of it a have just got to the throne think of it he just preached the church ages think of it he says now the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as will John turned and saw one like the Son of man coming in the midst of the seven candlesticks snow-white hair the judge not girdle around his waist but girdle around his paps or his shoulders up there a judge with the sash of the judge over his shoulders he stood with a golden pure holy refined girdle that held his righteousness his cover he was covered all the way down to his feet what's the seventh full manifestation of his person in glory think of it brothers and sisters that was in 1960 think of it nobody but the seventh church age messenger recognized the junction between the intercessor and the judge and not only that gave the bride confidence and security that the judge is going to be part of our DNA we're family with the judge he was going to prove that our DNA and a and he came to pronounce his family perfect and pure and had everything that we need to be completely condemnation free only the son of man ministry in our day could give the bride back confidence but the rest of the world is gonna feel plagues that Moses brought remember the same Moses that brought the place is the same Moses that provided the blood on the door for the elect remember the same Elijah that caused the drought in first Kings 17 is the same Elijah had the secret food for the woman in that drought that he had caused so remember the political disturbance the natural disturbance is the same one that's showing that the Redeemer has come to pick up the redemption the redeemed ones if we can go on just a little bit more and trying to get to something in the scriptures I'm not doing a very good job I'm trying to lay a good foundation to take away the fear because remember when when Jesus came to the boat which was under the sixth seal the first thing that Jesus said to the people though fear not and once they recognized who is in the boat under that tribulation and he spoke all things were at peace let's read a little bit more now we know that this seventh seal has been revealed in every type in every shadow and every story and you're well versed in these things and I'm going to go to some of those stories so we're going to go a little bit more watch this quote God's great mystery of how it's a secret it was kept a secret nobody should know anything about it even the Angels didn't understand it see he revealed didn't reveal it that's the reason under the seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence because remember if brother Brandon would have spoke it it would have created another perversion so that's why brother Brandon didn't speak the seventh seal so that the devil couldn't create another perversion or a counterfeit but yet he's given the bride the keys she knows needs what's this quote now all these things in there we find out sometimes like I come to Shreveport where we have just been about two or three weeks I'd like to take 30 minutes a night and just on teaching now I love this part see just stay right in the word these secret passages see where we could find out how just how find out just how to get in so there's secret passages in this Bible that are actually doorways for the bride to get in for secret communication we'll read a little bit more my subject this morning I trust that God will reveal it and each time if you take the tapes and listen I hope and trust that you that have a spiritual understanding of what God's trying to get over to the church without saying it right out so think of the predicaments that brother Brandon was in he had to get something over to us but he couldn't say it so he was trusting on private communications to catch the part that he wasn't allowed to speak and just going back to what I was referring to the calling of the names nothing will be saved only those whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding if now remember Paul sealed a 2,000 years ago not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is Wallace calling those names see you finally understand now see the book doesn't say hey now lavell is to be saved in time of this church age or ormond Nevel or whatever no it doesn't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it that's what I said that the other night so these secrets passages are in the scripture that the world knows nothing about and yet to the bride they hold a secret to give her faith to take away fear so that she knows what stage of the program she's in if you can take your Bibles with me you're probably getting close to my time already but if I can take one story in the Bible just to sure follow that seventh seal secret that's been encrypted it's been hiding and laying in the Bible for thousands of years but it was only starting to come to light now with the son of man ministry you take your Bibles and if we'll go to Genesis we'll go to Genesis the 24th of 24th well look ya know let's go yeah let's go to Genesis 24 and I'm sure that these things are nothing new to you and and you've read all these things before and I'm sure brother always shown these things before but perhaps this morning for somebody just a focusing real tight on the seventh seal which is actually secret communication which is actually encrypted which is actually reserved for a certain time and and and to give the bride the faith that she needs remember the seventh seal is in every shadow every story every type if I can also just while we're going there I'd like to show you the seventh seal even in Genesis chapter one verse one I find it so interesting that the Prophet actually when Brisbane says we now for the first time are able to go back into God's mind and shows us what's in the back part of God's mind imagine the thoughts before they became word now remember the Seventh Seal always reveals itself under tribulation so I'm going to use the words the Seventh Seal reveals itself under the sixth seal because the sixth seal is the tribulation see six seal of political disturbance financial disturbance spiritual disturbance of environmental earthly disturbance under that tribulation seal God reveals himself now I don't want again I want to bring this down home now very often when you find somebody going through a hard time in life family's falling apart they're in the middle of the divorce they lost their job they're feeling the effects of the 200,000 thousand demons crossing the river euphrates they've got a child in their house that heads off to the world and a lion and a bear eats on that child and now they've got to be David to go rescue that lamb you find a church maybe under the sixth seal under spiritual tribulation under under under religious persecution you find a family maybe under economic and political persecution from the rest of the relatives you find tribulation or persons late I want you to understand that the seventh seal reveals itself under the sixth seal under that tribulation and we find that all through the Bible when Egypt was under the sixth seal that's when the Seventh Seal revealed itself and the profit told us that when Genesis 1:1 this world was without form or void when you take Genesis 1:1 this earth was without form or void and he told us that it had crashed it was under tribulation it was under your judgment under the judgement seal under the sixth seal the sixth seal is the judgment seal the earth was under the judgment sixth seal of judgment seal as he was without form and it was void remember in the next verse the Bible says and the spirit moved and God spoke said let there be light and created light in the midst of the judgement seal and that's what brought that earth back into order and the Seventh Seal doesn't quit till Genesis 2:25 something that was in chaos something that was deformed the Seventh Seal speaks the spirit moves it speaks it says let there be light and there was light and the light separates light from darkness that's the first stage of taking something that's in chaos many families are without form would their void they're in confusion they're under the judgment seal but inside of that sixth judgment seal God speaks I mean the spirit moves God speaks and he creates light and the Seventh Seal creates light and the Seventh Seal is the light that takes the chaos out of the first six seals so the Seventh Seal started right from Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 the whole Bible starts with the seventh seal bringing something out of chaos and judgment with a form and void and the spirit moves and speaks and says let there be light and there was like the whole Bible starts with the seventh seal it's the secret that the son of man ministry gave to the bride so that we understand everything starts with the seventh seal and everything ends with the seventh seal the mystery secret praise the law I love it and remember when this earth was in judgment of water and with covered in water God spoke and dried off the earth that was under judgment and brought out a brand new civilization and Noah and his family had the unbelievable privilege of walking from one destructive civilization crossing through the breach under an arc that was sealed inside and out and walked out in a brand new millennium civilization by faith and remember the bribe is going to be like Noah because we've been given instructions how to build the ark you and I are gonna walk out of this condemned judgment earth into a brand new millennium civilization were the only ones that will taste two civilizations under that seventh seal a man and it gets better in that civilization Nimrod he knew the first six seals but he didn't know the seventh seal and the first six seals caused him to try to build his own deliverance from what he saw the former world destroyed by but Abraham was the Seventh Seal - Nimrod Nimrod knew the first six seals he was in an ungodly man he knew the first four horse riders and he was working against that seventh seal but Abraham possessed the seventh seal and Abraham was the seventh seal to Nimrod he held a secret Nimrod was looking for let me say this bright my friends my friends let me say this we hold the God the rest of the world is looking for what do you think that accelerator in France is all about they want to find the sole gene of the creation of God they're trying to find the molecule of creation what they're looking for we got what do you think Hubble is all about they're sending Hubble Oh to the space up there to do what to find what started this whole thing what therefore we got we hold what they're looking for and what nimrod was looking for was in abraham amen the bride possesses the eternal God that the scientists are looking for we hold the vaccine that they're trying to find to be disease-free they wanna they don't realize it's sin that causes disease and a vaccine will never stop disease because the sin will continue and what we have they're looking for and now it's so wonderful nothing to the sixth seal of this earth the plagues are being released financial strife spiritual strife under under under environmental troubles God reveals himself to a bride in secret in the encryption it's a wonderful thing now let me get back to Genesis 24 and I I'm getting a little bit long over here now so I'm gonna try to finish off with this I trust you're enjoying this I trust that the Seventh Seal is going past your flesh past your spirit going into your soul and giving you confidence of what happens in the Son of Man ministry in our day how that he knew the program of God he knew how to keep this program secret he knew how to take and let it be revealed at the right time and now we're 54 or odd years later and now the bride is finally starting to understand what it is the prophet knew all along because she's catching the revelation that he is that he encrypted for us to find in our generation right secret passages in the Bible that's good at Genesis 24 and this is an old story for you but I want to just bring some highlights of the effect of that seventh seal so here Abraham we know is looking for a wife for Rebecca for Isaac and you understand the story how that Abraham put Isaac or Eliezer and survery under oath and Eliezer when he's going out to look for a bride remember this III can't I can't help but I remember this that the wind Eliezer is looking for a bride his dilemma was how am I going to know that that I'm gonna be successful because he put himself under oath to find a bride remember brother Branham found himself under oath he's the one that had to go find a bride but he didn't want to go find a bride by putting an adult for and on a dating site for our description of character he wanted something eternal that would hold the test of time and we find out that what happened was over here that in verse 14 that Eliezer now he's he wants the confidence that how is he gonna the bride there's gonna be a lot of women but how is he gonna recognize the bride that he's looking for so that he's successful in his journey and he makes this deal with the angel in verse 14 let it come to pass that the damsel whom I shall say let down that picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall she she she shall say drink and I will give thy camels so watch now he's talking to the angel he said the damsel that'll say drink when I asked for a drink that's gonna say drink I'll give you to drink and I'll give thy camels to drink also let the same be the one that thou has appointed now watch that word that thou hast appointed for thy servant appointed for thy servant remember you didn't choose God God trolls you God came after his seed he knew where the seed was you weren't looking for God God was looking for you you came at an appointed time that the damsel that has been appointed for thy servant Isaac you've been appointed to Isaac remember he didn't have a choice who her husband was he came out of Adam she had no choice she was Adams wife before she knew that there wasn't Adam and there is the mystery written inside of her before she even recognized who Adam was and remember this that the bride doesn't have a choice whose husbands we are we have no choice we came in a priced we're going back to her husband it's God all in all predestinated and thereby shall I know that thou has sought kindness unto thy master and it came to pass before that he was done speaking remember Eliezer oh lord help us we've had an Eliezer called in our generation remember choosing of a bride the thick service the six service seven services in a row six services in a row sorry he's preaching on the west coast in Los Angeles the sixth service under the sixth seal under the judgement seal the sixth service the Son of Man is on the west coast and on that West Coast remember he's the one that's thrown the rock in the air he's the one that caused the judgment on the west coast and now he's back on the west coast in the six sermon he's preaching choosing a bride and he places himself under Genesis 24 as an Eliezer calling for a bride and he places himself as the vile angel in Revelation 21 9 in the same sermon the Eliezer and the vile angel under the sixth service under the west coast in the west coast where he's thrown the stone to start the earthquake and while the Bible says over here and I came to pass that before he was done speaking remember Eliezer still speaking he still got the angel on the scene he's still making a deal with the angel and before he's done speaking there's a bride that's catching the secret of who that is while he's still speaking praise the Lord and I came to path before he done speaking that behold Rebecca came out who was born of besties well the son of Milcah the dell wife of neighbor Abraham's brother and with her picture on her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man no one hurt and she went down to the well and was filling her pitcher and she came up and the servant ran to meet her and he said I pray thee now watch watch friends what it was a two-part deal with the angel here's the two-part deal the woman that says I'm gonna give you to drink and the woman that'll feed the camels remember it was a two-part token remember now he's only gonna tell the Eliezer one part so I have a question for you where is she gonna find the second part so that the token matches remember there's one part to Calvary and one part in our day and it has to match remember there's a Christ a husband and there's a wife but this alone by itself is not complete it's not complete till we have an invisible union and they both think the same thought and they come together remember Eliezer had given the angel a two-part token and now do and the servant ran to meet her and said I pray thee a little drink of water from thy pitcher now watch he asked her for a drink but he never told her the second part he never told her the part about watering the camels she's gonna have to get that part that secret communication that seventh seal from the seventh seal that's not spoken in other words there was going to be no quote for the seventh seal there's only B gonna be a quote for the first six seals but there's not going to be a quote for the seventh seal but she's gonna have to catch the the second part without a quote because Eleazar does not tell her about watering the camels that's why brother Brendan says when the Eleazar got to the well brother BAM says and the angel went ahead of him by about a half an hour and the angel beat Eleazar to the well by a half an hour and the angel beat Eleazar went all the way to Rebecca's house and put a Sox and Rebecca's mind that says you know what for some reason or other I think I need to get to the well and it seems to me I just got the slot to get to the well little did Rebecca know she was already under the influence of the angel before she got to the well that's what brought her to the message it wasn't that the message of the angel the angel went ahead of the messenger to can bring you to the message I had to come to realize that God was the one that brought me to this message before the message came to me God was already dealing with me bringing me to the message I was already under the influence of that angel before I even came to the message that's what brought me to the message amen praise the Lord and now eleazar's just gonna reveal the first six seals not gonna tell Rebecca the Seventh Seal and the servant ran and said I pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher and she said drink my Lord and she hasted and let down the pitcher on her hand and gave him to drink and when she had done giving him drinks she said I will also draw for thy camels until they have done drinking and she hasted ended her picture in the trough and ran again into the well and drew the water and drew for the camels watch now watch now here's Eliezer looking at the Rebecca and realizing she caught the part that I didn't speak this is the woman this is the guarantee that I've been looking for so that I will be successful and what's this and the man wondered at her and held her peace because he only told her part of the token but she caught the second part that he had privately talked to the angel above and to it whether the Lord had made his prosper journey or not so now he realized it was the unspoken part that was the evidence that made his journey complete praise the Lord I feel my time is up I have probably where I exhausted your time I hope you've been really comfortable and you've had a orange juice or a coffee or a latte or something but I just pray that something of eternal values been made real to you when I say things like Abraham was the seventh seal to Nimrod Nimrod remember what happened to Nimrod Nimrod had the public role of what he knew God had done in the sixth seal under the tribulation to the earth but he didn't recognize Abraham and Abraham when he walked out also showed the Seventh Seal to us remember these are secret passages in the Bible that were there all along but God had hidden them for 2,000 years these secret passages that are only going to be made available to the bride in our generation over here and brother Branham gave us the keys to unlock these things because even in Abraham's life remember his name was Abram and when he comes up to to Genesis chapter 13 he's under sanctification and our justification under Luther's message and we realized that men in Genesis 15 he's under sanctification in Wesley's message and then under Genesis 17 he comes to Pentecost still doesn't have the right name still uncircumcised still has a covenant that he can't realize and so it takes some secret in Revelations 18 for him to meet the angel that actually gives him the faith to realize that when the angel met him in the tent that was private and when the angel talked to him in the tent and confirmed his confidence to him and showed him the program what's this the Angels now all of a sudden Abraham knew that the Angels that were mercy to him were judgment to Sodom so again we see the junction of time between judgment and between mercy and here the angels are going to be judgment to Sodom but they're going to be mercy to Abraham and while they're going down to burn sawed him into it pull up the elect but Assad and remember only the relatives of Abraham are going to be saved while they're going down to burn sought him Abraham walks with that one angel and then the angel says to him and opened the Seventh Seal in verse 17 and says can I hide any of my secrets from my friend and right there the angel actually tells Abraham the secrets that nobody knows nothing about and reveals the self for six sealed the seventh seal to him because the angel himself is the seventh seal that revealed the six seals and when Abraham realized the junction that he was in that's going to be judgment to Sodom but mercy to his seed remember this there's a three-fold reason why the angel said I came to you what's this you can write this down he says number one I came to you because you're gonna teach your children think of it the confidence that the angel had in Abraham to tell him a secrets was that he was going to teach his children and number two that I know thee and number three that you're gonna teach your children and they will recognize my visitation and their generations think of the consonants the angel is put in us in our generation to teach us his secrets knowing that we need to teach our children so that they recognize the day of their visitation so the Seventh Seal is wonderful and when you see it it's all you can see even Tmart knew that if she was going to be found pregnant they were gonna burn her under the sixth seal but she knew she had the seventh seal evident in her pocket of who she was pregnant with so it's God bless you this morning I just think I'm I hope I haven't been too scattered everywhere I hope that there's been something of eternal value I hope that you recognize that sometimes when a person's life is under the judgement seal that's exactly when God's got a chance to reveal himself to make himself known so I just want to say God bless you this morning I just want to say again you have a wonderful pastor it's got a pastor's heart he himself just like myself also realized that as a pastor even as the pastor of a home of the father of a home and his brother a Lurie and as myself if we're not growing spiritually then the whole church isn't growing spiritually if us as fathers of our home are going downhill spiritually we drag our whole family with it but your pastor a wonderful man of God has a desire to grow spiritually and I would I do also and that's what makes it really exciting it's been amazing to me the secrets that God has revealed in the book that Adam once held that's just been reserved for our day so I want to say God bless you and I'm just gonna turn it over to your wonderful pastor and let him end the service this morning I hope we can meet in person someday again I hope maybe we can go to another Bowl sale I hope maybe we can do something for you and when do you want to ever run away from wanna run away from the seal and we've always got a place for you so god bless you this morning God richly bless you we love you take greetings from our church and godly with you this morning god bless amen well brother Eugene that was wonderful really appreciated that I I got so much out of it and just really enjoyed that god bless you recently my brother just I mean so many so many Nuggets day that that it that was really special one thing is have brother Eugene spoke about how this resurrection is a secret resurrection and and it was just that that link between how the resurrection now is is the the same as when Lazarus was called and this is not the general resurrection that we in that that's just that thought how he placed that in in pipe was just really special I thoroughly enjoyed that and then also he made the statement that often because of our rejection complex we fear it when the judge is present but he's the only one that can wipe away our record I mean that that's a beautiful beautiful thought also how the same Elijah who calls for the drought was the one who took care of the widow woman I mean hallelujah it's that same principle of of the lion vs. the lamb I mean to the bride he's always gonna be the lamb I mean I also love her how her brother said that that God chose us and we had no choice whether we was gonna be his bride I mean he chose his bride be before she even knew that she was gonna be his bride like Eve was to Adam Amy and of course today with with all the women's liberation kind of Minds hits and stuff people would argue that's so unfair but if you are the bride that's not on fear you are just thankful that that God chose you amen I like that thought of the private communication that private inspiration that that principle we we spoke about that some time ago but but just the way this was presented just really special how Rebecca had to catch that that thought that was in God's mind and and the perspective that that really either and the angel had a had a two-part deal you could say but how the second part of the deal wasn't spoken and how Rebecca had to come into that inspiration to define that second part and also what I really enjoyed was how how Rebecca was already under the influence of the angel before she went to the well really special and how that applies how God was already preparing us for the message God was already bringing bringing us and the message together before it actually came across her path wasn't there just something and then the Seventh Seal reveals himself under tribulation the Seventh Seal and talking back to you to Genesis and how God created order in chaos that's what the Seventh Seal that's what that person of the Seventh Seal does for us just so much brothers and sisters I would certainly recommend you having a listen to that again and and maybe I can twist brother Eugene's arm at some point to do a part two for us but we'll we'll see we'll have a discussion and see if if you would fall for that Amy well god bless you richly I'm gonna ask brother Simon to produce few songs and close the meeting but god bless you it was good to fellowship together and may the Lord be with you Amy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music]
