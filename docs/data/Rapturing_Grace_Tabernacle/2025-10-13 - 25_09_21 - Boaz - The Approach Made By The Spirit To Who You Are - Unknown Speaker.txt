The greatest love story. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's good to be here this morning. Amen. I'm so thankful to be in the house of the Lord this morning. I'm so thankful to serve a living God. &gt;&gt; In fact, not a living God. There's no such a thing as a living God. There's only the living God. Amen. Praise God. We are so privileged to serve him. Wonder if we can take our seats just for a moment. Um just really appreciate the time so far this morning. I want to say thank you for that song item. Amanda, that was very special. Hope there's many more to come with your group, not just Amanda, but God bless you all. It was really special. Um, we'd like to welcome all our visitors this morning. We we have a fuller house than I expected. Brother John and brother Mark asked me on on Wednesday night, do I expect many people? And I said, no, not really. But we're a nice group. It's always always special when we have when we have full house like this. So, uh, it's real real nice. Welcome. May the Lord make each one feel real at home and trust that, uh, that we'll have a blessed time together. Um, want to also say it's a real real privilege to have Boaz here with with his wife Libby. Where's Libby hiding? You want to stand for a moment so people can just Yes, please. Here we go. Welcome. It's so good to have you. Um, so I don't know some of you know know the family, but um, Libby Libbyy's mom Debbie is brother Daniel's sister. So Daniel is a uncle. And um, Boaz is I don't know what he is. He's a Canadian American Aussie with a with the accent that draws from all the above. Praise God. I know what it feels like. Um, so we we just want to want to uh just have a blesser time this morning, a relaxed time this morning. I um kind of enticed the young people to wear their their dress this morning that they used for the banquet last night and some rose to the challenge. So very good on you. Um that's good. You know, it's a privilege to serve the Lord, but it's also fun to serve the Lord. It's a It's good to be a Christian. We don't have to be sour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Some of these things would have got us crucified or put under church century a generation ago. But there was always a saying, what happens at the conference stays at the conference. So we'll say what happened at the banquet stays at the banquet. Um, so speaking of last night, I I really really enjoyed the time and I want to say thank you for everyone who made it happen for all the hard work and Pow and her team did an amazing job and I now this this is just me and this is just me being very bluntly open and honest with you. I'm my love language is acts of service and when I saw the team come in last night you know 10:00 half past 10 and work and break down and so so forth I just really felt loved and cared for and I really appreciate that and I can't explain it I don't understand it but I want to say God bless you it's just good to to have brothers and sisters like this and with the setup and with the prep and with everything there's so much hard work that went into these things. But I just want to say thank you to God for you and thank you for for your effort for those things. Really appreciate it. Um we had a we had an interesting mishap. I'm sure many of you have heard about it. Um, similar to last year, thankfully last year it was during the prep time, but um, last night halfway through the evening, the fire brigade was called out because the um, presumably again the steam in the kitchen set off the the alarms and the poor young ones stand stood out in the cold for I don't know 40 minutes or something. So that put a bit of pressure on your on your evening. Um but you know at the same time the Lord really undertook for us because it was supposed to rain yesterday. Um and even in that the Lord really undertook for us. So really thankful for that. The Lord is always gracious with these things. So we don't always understand why it happens and my flesh really struggled when it happened. I was quite frustrated especially when the people who were supposed to ring the keys didn't have the keys and then all sorts of things had just extended. But God knows God knew why we needed that and all up it was a wonderful wonderful time. Um just on that front and sorry to do it here but it's probably easier. Um there's a bunch of chair covers tablecloths etc that needs to be washed and pillars just asked if if any sisters up for doing some if you can just make contact with her directly and then um that would be much appreciated if that could happen. Also, um probably don't need to remind you from here, but it's maybe worth a while. I won't be here, so it won't affect me, but um daylight savings next Sunday. So, uh just remember that. And then since I I'm leaving on Tuesday, um going to the US for a week, um God willing, I'll be back Wednesday after. Um but, um I'm I'm not going to be here next Sunday. So I would like to wish the October birthday babies a happy birthday today. So we have a few. On the 4th, Sister Chavevel, on the 9th, Sister Tracy, on the 14th, um Joshua Sevenster, Simon Oliver, and on the 25th, Lzelle on Ferin. May God bless you each one on a on your day and give you a very special day also. Really blessed year ahead. Um, and then I I also will just um ask for your prayer for the trip. I've been battling with my health a little bit over the last week. Um, just really ask that the Lord will will keep his hand over me. Um, like I've I've said a couple of times, the motive is to attend those brothers meetings. So, thankfully, I'm only going to do one service uh preach one service there, and that's on Wednesday night there for brother Barry coffee. Um but um so it's not going to be a work trip in that sense. Um I'm going to really um spend some time in fellowship and go to learn and go to see how they do things. So really excited about the trip. But also please keep the brothers in prayer who will be ministering here. Brother Jonathan, do we still have that PowerPoint up that we had up before service? Um yeah, that's exactly the one there. Can you just put that slide up? Let me just grab that one. Whoops. How do you do that? There we go. Isn't that just amazing? It really struck me when I when I saw that. If we believe not, in other words, if we in a lie, if we battle, if we struggle with the flesh, if there's things that block our faith, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himself. Now, there's two things that I mean, I just feel like preaching. There's two things that just jumped out at me. Firstly, he cannot deny himself. In other words, he can't deny his attributes &gt;&gt; that towards us, &gt;&gt; but also he can't deny us because we're part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whether we believe it or not, we're still part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I so love the word. It's just so beautiful. &gt;&gt; Just thought I would share that. And uh yeah, ah the Lord is so good. Okay, I'm not going to take any more time. Thank you, brother Jonathan. Um so, Brother Boaz, I don't know if you need any further introductions. There's a few people who asked how old you are. Is it going to be very politically incorrect to ask you? How old are you? &gt;&gt; 30. &gt;&gt; 30. Exactly right. That's probably the center of the guesses that that happen. So, let's just um let's just sing one song as we call you up. Um there is none like you. Let's stand together and sing that. Yeah. Let's just sing that chorus together. There is none like you. [Music] No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none. [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. There is no light. Amen. Let's just uh go to the Lord in prayer. Our dearest heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you this morning, Lord, we just thank you for this opportunity you've given us to be here, heavenly father, to witness you, heavenly father, in all your glory. Lord, may you just be expressed to the people this morning. I pray heavenly father and to me Lord may we just come to know you and ourselves more Lord God may we just see the intertwining Lord God as you've woven us together Lord through all eternity Lord though Satan may try to unravel it in our minds we just accept it this morning heavenly father and we come on the basis of your word we thank you for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you musicians Um, I'd just like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Um, bring greetings from the saints back home and brother Daniel, my pastor, and Sister Cheryl. I know they love you all very much. And, um, I just want to thank you for making myself and my wife so welcome here. It's been a real honor and a privilege. Uh if we could turn in our Bibles to um um to Matthew 3 verse 15. Want to thank brother Al as well and his wife for all their efforts for last night and for making it possible for us to be here this morning. God bless you. Um, now this is this is when um maybe we'll just go back one to verse 14. And this is when Jesus had come to John. But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me. And Jesus answered him, saying unto him, suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him. Uh you may take your seats. Now I just love how he put it here. He didn't say to to fulfill most righteousness, to fulfill my righteousness, but he said to fulfill all righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um just got to forgive me. I got to bring this up. Got this one on my phone, not the tablet. Um if we go into that righteousness you can through the direct translation of that word um the verdict of approval that that's that's what what was going on here to fulfill the verdict of approval. And if we go to St. John uh 19:30. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." And he bowed his head and gave up the ghost. It's finished. In case you were wondering, &gt;&gt; all all righteousness has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, see, John had to humble himself to the word that was standing in front of him. &gt;&gt; Even though John himself, I mean, who who was worthy to baptize the Christ? &gt;&gt; Well, John was cuz he came to him. But he had to get over what he thought of himself. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just got to get over what we think about ourselves. &gt;&gt; Doesn't really matter what what your opinion is, what your thought is. If it's contrary to the word of God, it's got to come down. Sometimes it's a harder fall than other times. Praise the Lord. Um, I guess this is something that's just really really struck me is um the question that's being asked the bride today is who are you? &gt;&gt; That's that's what Satan's really coming to each and every one of us with. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; I know even though we might live in different geographical locations, we all we all face the same trials. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they come in different ways, but &gt;&gt; you know, it's it's to them that overcome. We we all we're all overcomers. &gt;&gt; No big overcomers, little overcomers. Just say as overcomers. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, it's good to see you, Stephen. Going to pick on you a little bit this morning. That's all right. I know you're tough and you can take it. Stephen's my buddy down there. Um, now, like you heard last night, we had the fire alarms. they went off and um when they went off in the building, I look and I seen Steven running out the door and I was like, "Okay, well, that's a bit weird." But he told me before that he's um he's on the volunteer fire department. He's you're not not quite there yet, but you're going through the training. Um, but yet even though Stephen's not a real firefighter yet, uh, when that truck showed up, guess who was sitting in there wearing the uniform? &gt;&gt; That's my buddy. And, um, and you know, you could come up to him and say, "Hey, I know you're not a firefighter yet." And all this, but I mean, he got to ride in the truck. He was wearing the un What are you going to What are you going to say? like you don't have a qual what qualifications do you have to be in that truck &gt;&gt; to be to be wearing that uniform you know but if somebody wanted to come up to him I'm sure Stephen he's pretty tough guy he'd probably he'd probably tell you tell you right off but see that's the that's the temptation that we're all faced with whenever Satan comes to us who are you we want to we want to give an answer don't you know who I am this that and the other &gt;&gt; well that's just not The word tells us who we are. &gt;&gt; And if if Steven really wanted to shut anybody down, see the guy that was driving that truck, the guy that was in charge, he's a bit of a disagreeable fellow, kind of marched in there like he owned the place and marched back out the same way. But, you know, if if Stephen wanted to stand on his own, well, he'd be all right. Depending on how many people, you know, he might might find himself in a bit of trouble. But all Stephen's got to do is say when when you go, "What right do you have to have that uniform on? What right do you got to be in that truck? Go talk to the guy that drove the truck. He said I could be here." &gt;&gt; And that's what we got to do to Satan when he comes to us with all this trouble. If you got a problem with me being in the bride, go ask the one that married me. &gt;&gt; If you don't think I'm worthy, that's fine. &gt;&gt; Go ask him. &gt;&gt; I don't think you either. So, &gt;&gt; but what's that got to do with anything? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord for these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just make sure we get to get in the truck. Doesn't matter about your qualifications. All right. &gt;&gt; Love you, buddy. See, every trial in our life has been handpicked by God. &gt;&gt; And it's been picked in such a way where we can't overcome it. &gt;&gt; It's perfect. &gt;&gt; So, he set upon the bride in this last day an impossible task. Well, it doesn't sound like a very just God, but we know that he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we go to Zechariah, you don't need to turn there, but Zechariah chapter 4. Um, I might just read this whole starting from the beginning. And the angel that talked with me and with me came again and waked me as as a man that is waked out of his sleep, and said unto me, What seeest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes, and seven lamps, which are upon and upon the top thereof, and the two olive trees by it upon one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of the bowl. So, pardon me. So I answered him and spake answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" You know, sometimes we just need to stop and ask. We don't need to try and work out what it is. &gt;&gt; Just stop and ask. Look at Look at the humility of Zachariah here. He said, "What are these, my Lord?" &gt;&gt; He's seen the vision, &gt;&gt; but what what is it? Amen. And and that's that's like each and every one of us when the word comes forth, we see it. But okay, Lord, what is it? You know, then the angel that talked with me and answered said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" Now, that's about when most of us pipe up and go, "Oh, yeah. No, see those those seven candlesticks. Yeah, no, they're you know, but and he said, "No, my Lord." &gt;&gt; Such humility. Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we do an impossible task? Do we train for it? You know, if I wanted to join the firefight department with Stephen and I went and trained in what I thought was required, it doesn't really do me any good. because that's not what's required. See, Steven's joined the firefighting department. The training's come after. &gt;&gt; And um a lot of times we think we got to do something, be something, whatever else. But &gt;&gt; you just accept his word, get in, he'll worry about the training. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord for that. Because it's not by power, not by might, not by studying, not by this, not by that, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean, there's no no more studying that probably has ever been done than by the Pharisees and Sadducees. And they missed it when he stood right in front of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we'll miss it, too, if he doesn't reveal it to us. &gt;&gt; It's just the way it is. It's got to be God. All God, not the grace of God. That's his grace is this is what brother Daniel's been preaching on back home on. But the grace is God's works. &gt;&gt; It's not our works and God's works. It's just God. &gt;&gt; There's no place for us to get big in there. &gt;&gt; It's just him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um our um our title tonight, if you could call it that or this morning is um the approach made by the spirit to who you are. It's a bit of a mouthful, but it's all we got. Um, praise God. Eh, but yeah. So, God set on us an impossible task. And I I really love this because if if um if you look at David, David had on his heart such a a a a beautiful thing to build the Lord a house. An impossible task. and he wanted to build build the Lord a house for the Lord to to live in. And and God said to him, he couldn't do it. There's too much blood on his hand. See, you can't do this work. You can't. It's got to be God. &gt;&gt; See, Solomon had to come and the work was done, but it was done by Solomon, not by David. And it's the same in our life. It's not us doing it. It's the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, um, if we go to, um, Matthew 6:27, I really love this one. Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? He set us an impossible task. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, might just go to that first slide. Psalm 65:4. Blessed is the man whom thou choost and causeth to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. um &gt;&gt; the man see we think it's us coming to God but it's actually a bit more rigged than that whom now causes to approach to come near to approach enter into to draw near to I like this one if you go a little further down to be brought near &gt;&gt; we are being brought near &gt;&gt; amen praise the Lord whom thou chooses choose elect to decide for it's been decided for you. &gt;&gt; Pressurees off. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Eh, but then when trials come, then we think we failed or we did something wrong to bring this trial upon ourselves. And this this right here has done wonders for me. Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. See, when we when we get tempted, when we fall into temptation and whatever else, uh we think it's because we've we've sinned, we fall away from God or this, that, and the other. But he was led of the spirit. Sons and daughters of God are led of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we we don't every time we're tempted, we don't get it right every time. That's why God gave us grace, he didn't give us something we didn't need. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have um tools in the tool belt we're not going to use. We're not getting weighed down by anything. And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights afterward and hungered, and when the temp tempter came to him, he said, "If thou be the son of God, command that these stones be made of bread." See how that's the question that's on Satan's mind. It was on his mind when Jesus was here. It's on his mind with Eve and it's on his mind today. Who are you? &gt;&gt; And that's that's the one he he tries to get each and every one of us &gt;&gt; to answer. But it's it's it's not it's not something for us to answer. It's already been answered in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can as Jesus did, we can just point them right back to it. Amen. When it says tempted, uh if you go down here, it says um to try whether a thing can be done, to try make a trial, a test for the purpose of ascertaining his quantity or what he thinks or how he will behave himself. to try the bottom one there to try or test one's faith, virtue, character by enticement to sin, hence to solicit sin, to tempt of the temptations of the devil. He was led of the spirit to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it's by by grace that we are saved, not works, lest any of us could boast. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this. Here's a quote right here from um the rising of the sun. He's the one who opened those seals. He's he's those seals. For the whole word of God is Christ, and Christ is the seals that was opened. What is the opening of the seals then? Revealing Christ. And when when and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it. &gt;&gt; They did. They took the picture not us. &gt;&gt; And there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end. What an identification. What quickening power did that to us. Amen. What an identification we have. See, that's that's what everyone's looking for is identification in this, that, or the other, in a job, in in a country. Lord knew I would really lean on that one, so he didn't really give me one I could lean on. I'm a Canadian, American, and soon to be Australian, so praise God. Anyhow, um bear with me a second while I find this um scripture. Ah, here we go. That's it. That's the one. Praise the Lord. In the book of Acts, thank you, Lord. Verse uh chapter 19. We'll start from verse 11. And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul, so that his body were brought so that from his body were brought onto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the disease departed from them, and evil spirits went out of them. Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits. the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure ye by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth." And there were seven sons of uh I can't say that word, a Jew, and a chief of the priest which did so. And the evil spirits answered and said, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?" &gt;&gt; Amen. I think this this fits perfectly to where we are. See, we've we've seen this here is the first messenger, and we've seen the last messenger. Amen. And it's just so beautiful how the these these guys come and you know Jesus we could do the same today. I come you know in the name of Jesus who who um William Brandon preached of &gt;&gt; well Jesus I know William Brandom I know but who are you? &gt;&gt; You know &gt;&gt; and that's that's you got to know where you're standing. &gt;&gt; And you're not going to know it by your power. You're not going to know it by your might, but by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only God can reveal this to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just thank the Lord for what he's done. It didn't end up well for those guys. &gt;&gt; And it won't end up well for us if we go out on our own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we don't stand here in our own power. We don't stand here in our own might, but by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. That's how this bride stands today &gt;&gt; going on in in the same line. Quickening power lets us see is coming. Quickening power snatched us from death to life. Quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do and what you have done and what you ought not have done and what you should have done and what you will be. Quickening power. all these things. Our Lord Jesus so full of quickening power. He was all of it together. He was so full of quickening power. He said, "You destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days." Amen. Talk about confidence and quickening power. Destroy this body and I'll this temple and I'll bring it up in three days. Amen. And and it's the same today in the bride. We've been given the word. Now we just got to stand on the word that was given to us because it cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was already spoken of him that I will not why how could he say this? Because it said I I will not suffer my holy one to see corruption. He knew the word that was spoken of him. And each and every one of us, this is what God's calling us to to know the word that is spoken of us. And you're not going to know it by power. You're not going to know it by your own might, but by the spirit of God. Amen. only he can reveal this to us. &gt;&gt; It's not not anything we can do, nothing less we could boast cuz we would. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's by grace. &gt;&gt; And we just thank the Lord for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going on. Why? Why did he say that? He knew. Yeah. Here we go. It was written of him. See that? It was written of him by the word of God which could not fail. The word said, "I will not suffer my holy one to see corruption, neither I'll leave his soul in hell." And he knowed that quickening power would raise him up that there wouldn't be one cell corrupt. He said, "You destroy this temple and I'll bring it back again in 3 days." Why? It was prophecy, the word of God. And prophecy, if it's true, word of God cannot fail. And the same prophecy and word of God that said he'd raise him up says we are already raised with him. No wonder he said, "Fear not." And it is written that the spirit that is now was in him now in us also quickens our mortal body. Fear not friend. The sun is up. The sun is up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this part here. Now look at trans look at transfiguration. We was everyone represented there. &gt;&gt; There was the living saints that had raptured. There was Elijah standing there and there stood Moses. The dead saints represented. Amen. If we're looking for represent representation, it's right there. Also, both of them had quickening power. Whether one died and whether one didn't die, they're all there. Amen. So, fear not, little bride. &gt;&gt; It's already been sorted. &gt;&gt; Because it was becoming to fulfill all righteousness. Amen. Thank you, Father. I might just leave that one there. And um and going back to by grace we are saved, not by works, lest any of us can boast. See, we can't we can't give something we don't have. &gt;&gt; And it's it's grace that's been freely given to us, but we got to accept it. &gt;&gt; It it won't do any good if we don't accept it. See, Stephen had a seat waiting for him in that truck, but he had to accept it. &gt;&gt; And each and every one of us, we got a seat waiting in that truck, but we just got to accept it. Amen. &gt;&gt; One, the beautiful thing about it is once we accept it, see I think I seen one of the sisters get up in that truck. See, you can give freely as you've been given. &gt;&gt; It's not just for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are you anyhow? um going on same sermon here. But remember, he went there with you in him. See, God had never separated the bride from the groom yet. So when God looked down upon the body of Christ, he saw both male and female. It was all redeemed in that one body. They are one same same word. The same word spoke of the groom, speaks of the bride. Amen. Well, how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when he did everything, even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards, then don't the bride have to do the same thing? Have to be exactly what the word said she would be in these last days? Praise the Lord. I might go might go back on that. This is the the same service but um same sermon but a different quote. That's the paragraph 248. And when a man has said that he believes the word and when the Holy Spirit comes, it's the abstract title to the title and and gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and everything is on it belongs to you. Amen. And that gives us the abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw back yonder before the foundation of the world and put it name on the book of life but was born through a man and woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin. Um I get that subject to sin and guilty of sin. But when I believed on it I received the deed. But when the Holy Ghost come, it was the abstract that everything against me, whether my mother done it, my father done it, my grandmother done it, like little epileptic child I prayed for a few moments ago that had come through the grandparents. The epilepsy fell down upon the child and I said, "Oh, I've lost the next portion of that quote." See, that that child got his deliverance. Even though there's things that's been handed down to us from our parents, from other generations, &gt;&gt; it's not your fault. &gt;&gt; You don't have to bear that. You were never made to. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there's deliverance that's been provided to us in this age. &gt;&gt; We just got to accept it. &gt;&gt; The devil likes to whisper in your ear and tell you he's got he's got rights to be on that land. Don't you know I was in your mom, I was in your daddy. &gt;&gt; He ain't got no rights. You're the purchased. You're the purchased bride of Jesus Christ. There's been a meeting at the gate. &gt;&gt; I don't care what he comes to you with. I don't care what your memories are. &gt;&gt; Boaz went down to the gate and he settled everything for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not talking about this guy. &gt;&gt; Amen. But our great great savior. He went down to the gate. Amen. at Gethsemane and he took back everything that was lost. Amen. He took back us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the purchased possession of Christ. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Going on, how can I overcome? In Jeffersonville, um 1963, paragraph 73. But in Noah's time, there was eight overcomers and that's what went in. They were caught inside. Now look friends, I believe they're typing this and if it's on the television or pardon type or whatever you do who is listening now or who will listen hereafter the hour is very late. This is 63 and you do have you do have good intention but be caught inside now. Don't struggle. &gt;&gt; This bit was for me. &gt;&gt; Not him that willth or him that runth but God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could just let God just just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he will be able to perform. Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to this church every day won't save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't if you're looking just to the church to save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let God, &gt;&gt; we don't need to struggle. We don't need to try to be something we're not. &gt;&gt; Just let God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in case we're wondering about where we may find ourselves, whether Psalms 139, whether shall I go from thy spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there? If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take up wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, &gt;&gt; and thy right hand shall hold me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's come down and he's weaved himself so into you. You are him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when you braid two ropes together after a wall, you don't know which is which. It's cuz they're the same. That's all the rope is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. In the Philadelphia church age book, uh yes, there he stands the Lord of glory. Once is the father. He was surrounded by the angels, the archangels, the cherubims and seraraphims, and the whole host of heaven crying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts." Such was his holiness that no man could approach unto him. But now we see him in the church sharing his own holiness with him until in him we have become the very righteousness of God. The very righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because someone had to suffer it to be so. &gt;&gt; Amen. It behoove it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Amen. It was all fulfilled in him. Praise the Lord. If we just go um to Revelations chapter 19 starting from uh verse verse 7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him. For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. Amen. We see this garment that we're clothed in, it was given to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got to put it on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to put it on. But it was given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This suit, I didn't pack it in my bag. My My precious wife did. But I still had to put it on. &gt;&gt; It'd be a bit of a side if I didn't. And it's the same for each and every one of us. We We got to put on what God's given to us. &gt;&gt; We put on his righteousness. He took our place. &gt;&gt; That was our place. Surely surely we we could humble ourselves to take his &gt;&gt; not by power, not by might &gt;&gt; but by his spirit. Amen. I um just in closing here, I've always loved this This statue right here, that's Michelangelo's Moses. Brother Bram spoke about it and I've always just found it. I could just look at the photo forever. Um, this is each and every one of us. That's just a perfect masterpiece. And that's what you are. Amen. And it's just it's beautiful. And Michelangelo uh the sculptor he said he said the sculpture is already complete within the marble block before I start my work. &gt;&gt; It is already there. I have I just have to chisel away the super flush material. Some of us got a bit more material than others. That doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; The masterpiece is there. &gt;&gt; It's in each and you are masterpieces. what you what you see when you look in the mirror does not matter &gt;&gt; especially if it's contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that right there is a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Might not look like it, but it is. &gt;&gt; And he's still working on me. And I know he's still working on you cuz we're still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you are all masterpieces whether we see it or not. You are the sinless, spotless, unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Whether it looks like it or not, &gt;&gt; whether you got anything in this life that you can sink your teeth into and say, "Oh, it's this, that, or the other." You just sink your teeth into that word one time. &gt;&gt; You want to know about real life? You sink into that word and it doesn't matter what it looks like. You are the masterpiece. You are the sinless, unadulterated product of Jesus Christ. That's who you are. I don't care what Satan says about you. I don't care what your mom says about you. I don't care what your dad says about you, what your friends say about you. That's who you are. You just humble yourself to the word of God and you accept it. I don't care if you just look like that mountain. That mountain is full of masterpieces &gt;&gt; and that's what I'm looking at tonight by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Let's humble ourselves to the word. Thank you, brother. God bless you all. [Applause] Praise the Lord. That was wonderful. &gt;&gt; Absolutely wonderful. Amen. Things that we that we um so many different things that we look at often just came together so beautifully this morning and so many scriptures and really just reiterating for us. It doesn't matter what you think of yourself. It doesn't matter what I think of you, what I think of myself. Amen. And and the difficult part that we say as an individual is it doesn't matter what you think of me. Amen. because because we all so want to fit in and we all want to feel accepted and all of that. Amen. But ultimately there's one that has already accepted us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the Bible speaks about Jacob and Esau. One have I loved, one of I hated before. Amen. Before either of them were born. Amen. And God is in the business of of chiseling off all the bits that's not his vision of us. I love that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that we're all encouraged this morning. &gt;&gt; It's just lovely to have been here. It's just been a real privilege. Let me just pray and then I'll I'll ask Simon to come up. We'll sing I Have a Maker. Let's stand together. Most wonderful and loving father, Lord, I just appreciate the tender loving way in which you spoke to us this morning. [Music] Father, [Music] Lord, I pray that no one will go out of here that needs this to be applied to our souls, to be applied to our lives, Lord, without meeting that one, without meeting the eternal God who says it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter what you think. It doesn't matter where you think you are. It doesn't matter if you feel like you're in a valley. And at the same time, it doesn't matter if you think you're in a mountaintop because he's already taken care of it all for us. Father, you've taken care of it all for us. Oh God, we are so privileged, Lord. Father, as as human beings, we all want to work, work, work, work, work, work ourselves into something. We all want to try and present something to you. We all want to try and meet you halfway, Lord, but that's not how you work, Lord. Father, you've paid the price, Lord. You see the the masterpiece inside the block when all we see of ourselves sometime is just that ugly old block that's standing there. Father, Lord, I love how you see through our brother this morning. You've given us the robe. We just need to put it on, Father. Lord, help us just to submit. Help us just to put on the word. Help us just to put on the grace that you've given us. Help us just to surrender, Lord. Father, you've spoken it. You've given us the shout, Lord. Now, I pray that you'll give us grace to submit to the word that you've given us. Submit to the word what you say about us, Lord. Oh God, we just thank you so much. It was good to be here, Lord. I pray that you will bless us the rest of this day and that your presence will go with us, Lord Jesus. And I pray as we sing, as we enter into worship now, Lord, let this word that we've heard sink into our souls, Father, Lord Jesus, and that it will change our thinking even, Father. It will change our attitudes. It will change our lives and father raise our faith. [Music] Give us a little more confidence, Lord, in who we are. I thank you, Father. We give you all the glory. I pray that you will bless my brother Richley. You will renew his strength, take him home with a testimony of your grace. God, we ask it in your precious name, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
