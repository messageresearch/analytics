how to take care of our our needs and our desires amen so what a privilege we have to gather again tonight and we're just thankful to be here with you it's been a real privilege to be here with everyone and to see everyone and just to feel the the spirit of God in your lives and to have been able to be blessed by that we just are truly privileged and we want to thank each and every one of

them that and see there's a great pull already brother you got to be careful with that but um you know we truly do love it here so home away from home and we just thank you for that amen let's go to the word tonight how many of you have figured out which story we are going to look into this evening well this evening we're going to look at the story of sister Georgie Bruce sister Georgie Bruce and uh trust it'll just be a blessing to you tonight just a simple little story and and I believe that these simple truths you know they they reflect or they look at our lives and we can look at our lives and we can see a reflection in somebody else and see what God has done for them and sometimes you know somebody goes through a similar struggle and and then we can draw strength from their the way God dealt with them or help them and this really what we want to do tonight we want to look at a parable or a story and just draw from it's it's um its truth it's little nuggets that are hidden throughout and and we know that even in the Bible in in Acts 9 which is where we're going to turn to you're going to find this woman Tabitha or Dorcas and uh you know she's so we find that God has given us a modern day Tabitha and that that would happen to be our sister Georgie Bruce there so I'm just thankful for these things that that God has done for us and the lives he is allowed to be lived out before us and we can glean from them for our examples amen amen before we just go to the scriptures why don't we just bow our heads one more time and um we just ask the Lord to bless the service tonight if you have a need this evening just feel free to let it be known it's an uplift the hand once again and the Lord sees beyond those hands he sees right into our hearts our very Hearts desires and lives amen and he he knows how to meet those needs tonight our precious Heavenly Father we just come before your awesome presence this evening Lord at the close of these services and truly we are thankful Lord that you're always there you're faithful Lord and Lord we we we can walk in your presence we can walk with you we can learn from you we can draw strength from you Lord I'm just so thankful that it's not up to me tonight but I can turn to you this evening and say Lord you know exactly what what your people need tonight you know exactly what our hearts desires are you know how to do it better Lord than we can even think or imagine so Lord we want to yield to you this evening we want to just lay our our Loaves and Fishes Lord in your hands I said you would multiply that you would feed your people tonight you see the hands that were lifted you see our needs our desires Lord we just give them to you tonight Lord we know that you have a need also Lord and that is to be worshiped Lord to have faith in you Lord and so we want to express our love to you tonight we want to say that we we thank you Lord From the Bottom of our hearts for what you've done for us the love that you've given to us the grace your mercies Lord we just give you praise tonight we give these thanks Lord you truly are faithful Lord God this evening as we turn to your sacred word that you would come and just let it be a blessing to our hearts give it let it be nourishment for our walk Jesus Christ and we pray amen you'll feel turn it with me in your Bibles to the book of Acts chapter 9. acts 9 and verse 36. acts 9 and 36. if you're there just say Amen it reads like this it says now there was at Jaffa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this name was full of good works and arms Deeds which she did does anybody here know somebody like that you know that sister that's always at the potluck she's always making food she's always bringing things always cleaning up after everybody always serving does anybody know a brother like that maybe got really quiet there all right we'll just leave that alone we're not here to preach about that tonight amen but you know there's somebody in our lives that we can look to and we can say wow that's a real servant of God that's you know there's that somebody in our midst that always just brings such a nice atmosphere there's somebody always serving you know we could see our brothers at the sound booth there and and they're doing slides and you know and we see those on the instruments and and the song leaders and the deacons you know brother John at the door there you know this we look at those lives and we we thank the Lord because they're always there serving amen they're always in our midst they're full of good works and and let's just give thanks for that tonight you know we appreciate that this evening and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber now here's an incredible thing because here's someone who has a real benefit to the assembly and then something happens in their life and it causes them not to be a benefit anymore right and and so here in verse 38 it goes on and and Forest matches Lita who was nigh to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them and then Peter arose and he went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the windows the widows sorry stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them you know they appreciated her they really felt a loss when she when she went and passed away and so they're praying and they're weeping because of her loss you know there's some amazing lives that that God has invited home and they're on the other side of the chasm this evening and and we feel the loss we feel the void you know because of what they meant to the assembly and it says here in verse 40 but Peter put them all forth and he kneeled down and he prayed and turned turning him to the body said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and she gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and the widows he presented her a life praise the Lord you may have your seeds this evening you know so we find this woman in the Bible who was full of good works and OMS these which he did and when she passed away she was missed you know some people we don't miss as much as others right but you know this person was greatly missed amen she was greatly missed and and so the congregation felt it the people felt it there was even people there to stand there as a testimony for the works that she did in their midst and so this was a great loss but we see how that God moves on the scene on their behalf to do what to restore her to the assembly so that she can continue in the work that she was doing so we see how this but I want to look at some of the struggles that people can go through we can we can go to church and we can serve God and you know and for myself my brother and sister I don't have a testimony like some do where they were in the world and and got saved and God did a great thing and they have wonderful testimonies and sometimes I I wish I had a testimony like that but I grew up around the message I grew up in the churches and my whole life I knew the church life and and you know the Lord just kind of in very small little steps worked in my life and my growth has been consistent but but slow you know no big great uh you know uh big events or anything like that even when I was baptized I just knew this this is my time and I knew that was the very next step in my life and just simple things like that and but you know you can go through the motions you can go through life like that and you can serve God and God is very is he's kind he's generous he's he's loving and and he's and he keeps you and he and he protects you from the the things of this world but you know my run sister in serving God sometimes we can get weary and well doing you know we can sometimes lose our vision a little bit even John one of the greatest men that ever lived you know his his eagle eyes got dimmed over a little bit there was a time in his life where you know he even started to sit down and just feel Lord you know I what about me and you know what about the the things that you've spoken of you know promises I've waited so long can you do something in my life you know it became very personal and you know we go through struggles and so we want to look at sister Georgie Bruce I just feel that God did something really special with sister Georgie Bruce and the kind of life that she lived in and some of the stages of her life and we want to just look through that and a trust it will encourage you this evening so the first time we hear of of sister Georgie is in this service here and this is in the service in in the handwriting on the wall 1956 and it says it like this now now she was privileged to be in the very Services of brother Brennan how many would have enjoyed that that would have been a real privilege Amen to sit right in the services of of the prophet of the end time and so she was there she witnessed the Miracles I want you to just try and picture sister Georgie Brewster in the services you know she's enjoying the the Miracles that are taking place and the and the great things that are happening the word that's coming over the pulpit so notice the scene and the event that takes place here remember now I said this is in 1956. he says and these two ladies at the altar how many has been to an altar how many came to an altar this this morning right so look at this the events here he says these two ladies at the altar do you realize Now ladies that Jesus Christ saves you from sin very simple question he asked them he says what do you have to do he says nothing because he's already done it on the cross see he says he has done it for you the only thing you have to do is accept what he has done for you this is we're talking about sister Georgie Bruce this evening amen think of this now this is she's sitting under these very words she's in the service she hears these words and she's one of these two ladies he says accept it and then you're a candidate to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost God promised he'd fill you with the Holy Ghost Those Who Come Peter said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ sorry for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we're in the days of the outpouring of the spirit great signs and wonders he says in the church everybody in prayer now he says I want to go talk to these ladies just a moment I love this I love these secret little moments that God has with his people and he and then the tape actually records it and and uh and and the transcriber I believe that's what you call it he he actually writes down sister Bruce and then there's a question mark and there's a blank spot on the tape but remember now what he said just accept it just receive it and now he's going to go down and like we do in all our services we just saw camp meetings this weekend a lot of this happening we saw it this morning people coming up ministry goes down they pray they have a little conversation they encourage them in the word and the Lord and then and and and then they have a prayer then a couple paragraphs later he comes back and he talks to the two ladies again at the altar he said about them at the altar he says oh isn't this wonderful these ladies here the two little ladies on the end weeping so they come down to the altar they said they were saved catches now they were saved when they accepted the Lord of course he says this they were saved when they accepted the Lord of course you know how many has been to a camp meeting and he gave your heart to the Lord right you went to a church meeting and you gave your heart to the Lord you were in a Mountainside somewhere you gave your heart to the Lord they were saved when they accepted the Lord of course look at the Simplicity of this just a regular meeting she happens to be there and and she's crying and weeping she accepts the the altar call or whatever what happened there and and brother Brandon goes have a conversation with her prays with them right but this is for real like this is a real person this really happened in our day okay now I wanted to highlight this because let's go through her the rest of her story now God's showing how powerful and simple our Salvation is and we we can underrate it sometimes sometimes we don't realize how powerful how effective his salvation is remember salvation when it comes to God it is an absolute complete work you're sealed until the day of your Redemption so he's going to prove to us now how powerful this salvation work is and sister Bruce is a witness to all of this remember all these things that we're going to go through tonight she was there when all these things happened right sister Bruce has a meeting then with brother Branham wherein she is healed from cancer this is not on tape but she has a meeting with brother Branham and he prays with her and she is healed from cancer that's a pretty great event how many here thinks that's a pretty big event and so God does something great in her life she she has a trial a trouble that comes up in her life and God comes through the prophet and she is healed amen so we see even great things happening in our life exciting things and wonderful things testimony is building and then later we find her in the service again this is in the message images of Christ 1959 so we're moving through the years now right he says here's a woman sitting here praying she's a warrior now listen to the like brother Brandon he's not prone to just say whatever right so we find here that he calls her a warrior you know I love that you know we have a sister in our church uh that you know when she hears things like that or or something nice has said or she hears a promise from the word or you know God does something special she calls it the love touches of God Amen and so we can see how God is even just extending a little bit of Grace to her showing her that that he loves her you know it's all these little hints and so he calls her a warrior he says I know her he says but I can't help because that light is hanging over her so he's just telling people I know who this woman is so it's not a big secret that I know things that are going on in her life but he's saying she's a warrior I know who she is but that light is hanging over her so something's happening he says that's Miss Bruce now miss Bruce he says I don't know a thing about about what's wrong with you he says you were healed with a cancer one time so he acknowledges that she was healed he says I don't know what's wrong with you right now he says but right there at that door the first time that I ever told you saw you standing in that door the Holy Spirit told me that something that nobody knows besides you and the doctor that's right isn't it do you believe he can tell me what's wrong now I mean these are very profound events taking place in her life he says I know you he says I don't know what's your trouble now I have no idea because you're healed of the cancer but I can't help that that light is hanging over you it's staying right there he says now I see somebody else rising up look at how the story unfolds here he says oh it isn't for you she's that Warrior right she's Dorcas Tabitha she's she's that help in the assembly he says it isn't for you it's for somebody who has got cancer so now here's a woman in the congregation standing for somebody else in the assembly he says that's exactly right and then I see a woman or something she's a sinner or something have a have a habit of drinking or something and you're packing two handkerchiefs on you for me to lay hands on she's standing in the Gaffers for two other people in the service see she's a warrior he says for their Deliverance he says that's that's saith the Lord that's exactly right now you be the judge is that right is that right raise up your hand he says somebody back in here oh that I don't know raise up your hand somebody that I don't know here he says what is that raise up your hands again right there in the corner there's four or five women sitting there do you believe me to be his servant do you believe that what you see is operated by the spirit of God is using this woman for all these things all right you do he says if you can believe the woman sitting looking at me with a little hat glasses on white looking earrings says yes it's not for yourself it's for somebody else and you're and they're in a serious condition it's an inward bleeding they're in a hospital in a hospital in New Albany that's the truth so look at how this is moving now right she initiated this right faith is building in the sanctuary he says the young woman did you raise your hand the woman on this other side looking at me this way do you believe me you have a desire on your heart you believe that God can reveal it to me all right you're praying for somebody else too it's somebody who has got cataracts on their eyes they're afraid they're going to go blind that's right he says now if you'll believe for her she won't go blind if you will believe it wow how many is praying for somebody else tonight I'm just holding for somebody else tonight you know she'll be healed if you believe it that's just that simple amen I love it and then we see there's some trials that come along her way we see these great events and we see the you know her being there when the discernment's taking place she Witnesses these great events I mean what would that do for our faith even tonight if we could witness things like that and like you know I call out a name and and God shows something personal in that person's life and and shows something very specific that only that person would know it would do a lot for our faith well she was sitting in these kinds of meetings but now we see a trial that arises in her life and in the message who is this 1959 again this is five months now later from the the previous quote he said we see her fighting cancer again he says I'm privileged looking upon a woman a few days ago who met us and said oh brother Branham it seems that a dreadful disease that you cursed one time in the name of the Lord is trying to return again what a thing huh that that devil doesn't know how to give up right he says but I'm resting solemnly upon thus saith the Lord and when the Physicians had examined our sister Bruce they found her to be negative he says we are grateful Lord that you keep your word your promise is so true this is now in the message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God 1960. and this is like I say just a few months later again a couple months later from the other one he says Georgie Bruce I see her sitting there you're always trying to find something for somebody else trying to help somebody Georgie says you was healed with a cancer no question in your mind the day that you come to this Tabernacle and walked out that door Yonder the Holy Spirit come upon me and told you right there some ACT that's nobody in the world knowed but you and God and another person he keeps coming back to that he keeps reminding her that God is using you sister Georgia he keeps reminding her that you're a warrior he keeps reminding her that God loves you you know and God's using you and that God healed you but she's going through battles right she's just in a Christian just like any one of us he says that day he come to the Tabernacle and that happened he says is that right amen he says that's right you believe me don't you Georgie you got something on your heart Georgie you believe God can tell me what's on your heart would that make the rest of you people that know me believe the congregation said amen and then he goes on he says I know Georgie but she's thinking of something she's got two people that's away from here she's praying for both of them live in Corydon that's right and she's got a person here a man she's praying for that's out here in the hospital and you're praying not so much for his healing but the salvation of his soul here She is again and God allowed her to see through that Prophet that God sees her requests that she's making he says that that's in the hospital you're praying for the Salvation of his soul that's that's saith the Lord that's right that's right Georgie that's exactly right look at this this woman in the congregation always interceding for other people and yet she's she's dealing with her own things as we'll get into in a minute he says God God is not going to forget her needs also right she's always praying for everybody else and then at some point we see in her life how even in the in the sermons now remember I can only go with what's on the tapes right I don't know all the other little details but there's enough on the tapes to show us really all the things that was transpiring in her life so now we we see how that she's always interceding for other people she's got this walk with the Lord she's she's working in the assembly and all these things you know she's a warrior but now God wants to deal with some of her needs right God does not forget that she also has needs and even brother Branham thinks that it's going to be for somebody else but recognizes that no she's actually praying for something she needs the message adoption 1960 another couple months later he says sister Bruce I know you the little nurse that rubbed my back knew you she's from down there near the motel JJ or twin J or something like that he says you will stand for others and what's your desire tonight from your father and sister Bruce says for myself tonight he says for yourself tonight sister Bruce speaks again and then the enemy has jerked you he says from Beyond the doctor's reach but I'm coming after you with a slingshot there's this Blank Spot on the tape and look at what the prophet is saying the enemy has jerked you from Beyond the doctor's reach but I'm coming after you wow that should do something for our sister Georgie he says I'm coming after you with a slingshot in the name of Jesus Christ I direct the slingshot Arrow at the Rock that's got into the kidneys in blocked condition it'll bring you back to God to his house so here She's suffering with with ailments in her body but he's saying I'm coming after you tonight notice this now brother Branham even goes as far as to include her in a dramatization of the millennium I mean just amazing how God constantly reminding her who she is where she's going he loves her he heals her he says and you know I'm walking out there through there all of us walk out there sorry I should give you the quote it's adoption number two also 1960. so just the next message he preached he says and you know I'm walking out through there all of us walk out through there just about 500 years just a little journey talking about the Millennium a million he says don't make any difference see it's the truth because there's no time there it's eternity so sorry just after the Millennium he says and when I go there I walk along down through there and you know I meet out there you know who I meet out there he says well if it ain't sister Georgie Bruce why sister Georgie been a long time since I've seen you looks like she's always looked see she may be 10 million years old but just as young as she ever was she'd be scratching somebody on the back and I looked there and it's a cheetah and the lion says well bless your heart sister Georgie no harm can come nothing at all in the evening time we'll go on up the top of the mountain and say oh papa God I once was lost oh I once was in the muck of sin powerful God and you saved me emphasizing here on the love of God look at how he brings her story in every time and it's always to do with God loves you God cares about you he mentions the song oh love of God and you can go read that for yourself now here again in another message and this is again in 1960 this is now one month later in the unfailing realities of the Living God we see her again sister George G Bruce is standing for herself but does not forget the other so now she does both we see both things together and her sister in the church and some loved ones you'll see here he says sister Bruce has hurt her leg I just everyday stuff dealing with everyday trials you know just regular things right sister Bruce has hurt her leg and she is also and then it says your sister Bruce speaks to brother Branham he says she's still in the hospital he says am I dismissed he said did you fall or something he says she says I was knocked off the escalator that's one of our sisters here at the church he says she was knocked off an escalator and she's really in the hospital is it broken and sister Bruce answers he says oh the leader the leaders and blood vessels and so forth and then she is standing for some loved ones also another paragraph later he says God As I Lay My Hands upon them may their requests be given to them granted o God In The Name of Jesus may it be so father for our sister Gertie in the name of Jesus also for sister Bruce Lord may it be so her request her knee and her limbs I'm just showing you the the regular life she had there in the prophet's meetings all the great experiences Amen in this meeting brother Branham talks about an interpretation that was corrected when it was said again he says I I think that's right isn't that right sister Bruce this is the message respects 1961. they hadn't given given it right the the message the interpretation he said said that was this that what the sign was was to show to them like appreciation of them that they had believed the message that was going forth here at the Tabernacle like that and said that they was going to see greater things when this had taken place that when they seen even angels ascending and descending and ascending he says so we are living in these days in the last days and we're at the end time and he says this sounds may sound terrible to some but to the to the Christians I'm glad that we're here I'm glad that we are at the end so even in interpretations and things like this she's involved she's right there in the assembly over and over you're going to find she's part of the services in the assembly in the congregation going through regular trials like we all do but how did she start let's not forget how she started or her story starts with her at the altar and the prophet says you're saved I mean he declares her saved because she accepted the Lord Jesus Christ let's move on I'm showing you these things for a reason tonight all these amazing things that she was a part of all these great experiences that she had even here in Christianity versus adultery idolatry he says God this 1961 the end of the year he says God in Jesus name bless our sister Bruce we know Lord that she is thy servant and that's as clear as it can get imagine if the prophet was standing here this evening or Jesus Christ himself and he told you to your face I know that you are my servant wow that would that would do a lot well she experienced these things you know and ministers can come here and say you know that that if you accept Jesus Christ down the house shall be saved and give you all kinds of promises it's just that personal he says we pray that you will give her her request in Jesus Christ's name amen and then he says these signs shall follow them that belief a little later on in in 1962 in the message taking signs with Jesus she Burns herself it says it right here in the message sister Bruce packing that water she's getting old father time is taking its toll on this little lady in the congregation and it starts to have experiences and things and and she said he says she's getting old father and there she burned her arms and up and down her body we pray for her she's probably hospitalized and we pray that you'll deliver her and bring her out granted father we ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ the message what shall I do with Jesus with Jesus called Christ 1963. at the end of the year this is even after the seals he says a lady sat right in here somewhere that was called and it was a sister by the name of Bruce I don't see her this morning but she was always she was a very very much a woman to pray and this woman come in was last time I was here and there was no prayer cards given nor nothing so there wouldn't be nobody no prayer line so they just the Holy Spirit just called out over the audience and this little Miss Bruce she was healed once herself with cancer and she just always got a burden on her heart for somebody else and she was just praying and there was a lady from Louisville that was dying cancer in the throat and while she was praying the Holy Spirit goes right to that woman calls her and whatever it did tell her who she was told her rather who she was and what her trouble was and about her having cancer and said that she it would be all right and the lady went home and a couple days after that she started choking to death nearly just her throat swelled up like that and she gave a big cough and the cancer jumped out and she's perfect see but who prayed the prayer for that lady it was just somebody in the meeting just an ordinary sister in the meetings just there in the everyday kind of uh you know motions of what we do every day the Sunday and Wednesday and Thursdays or Fridays whatever we you know wherever we're serving the lord and and her prayer is what touched the Holy Spirit to go and discern the thoughts and intents of that person's heart that healing came because of that sister's faith think of that great experiences see there's a lot of amazing experiences we can have a lot of great things we can go through camp meetings which we just did we can have great outpourings of the Holy Spirit we can have great Washings and revivals and we can have all these wonderful things my brother and sister great experiences great memories with the Lord not just being in the meetings but literally being a part of the meanings she played a big part in these meetings if you think about it to see the countless lives that were saved and changed by the word she sat there and witnessed these things to be praying for someone and the angel of the Lord picking up her prayer and healing a person that she's praying for believing in the word and seeing it come to pass right before her very eyes now we want to look at something here you know there are very few private interviews that are actually recorded with brother Brennan and simple reason for that is because they're private but sister Bruce's interview is recorded I think that's very special she's recorded having this private interview with brother Branham and today we can listen to him we can read it now I don't believe that God allowed that just by accident right so of all the interviews this is the one that we have readily available that is archived with the sermons of brother Brennan to me that's really interesting her little interview her secret you know to me it's special because you think of even Peter in the resurrection God had a secret interview with Peter secret little interview and you know Peter was a loud and boisterous man he he recorded everything he told even his faults and failures and you know in his books he he recorded everything you know he wasn't ashamed you know but that little interview is private and I find it amazing here we have this interview that was made between her and this prophet and it's recorded for us and it's there it's right there in the archives of all the sermons of the prophet of the end time why did God do that why did God do that I don't want us to underestimate what God did with sister Georgie Bruce he says so what about this interview let's take a quick look this evening this interview takes place on a Sunday in 1964. if I can just get it for you it's 1964 the seventh month on the fifth day it's called private interview so it's easy to find now he's having this private interview with sister Bruce let's just go through here real quick now with all of her experiences we would think man she would be the most on fire person in the congregation she would have no doubts no fears right because of her experiences with the Lord right he says I visit you in the hospital that time and I prayed constantly God wouldn't that God wouldn't let you die because you're a value to the church sister Georgie Bruce you're a value to the church see now I know you I know you're going to be all right sister Bruce I believe that with all my heart see that should be enough already sister Georgia Bruce says brother Branham most of all I want the experience that have been sealed in the Holy Ghost wow that's powerful after all this time she still has a question in her heart isn't that amazing she has this question she has this she wants to know that I have the Holy Ghost I want an experience I want to know that have been sealed in with the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart she wants to know if she's going to be okay you mean after all the experiences after the the seals have been opened and all the great things and we we go through camps and we go through conventions and all these things here a person ends up with even healings and testimonies in her life she's carrying the secret question she wants to know Lord but am I really saved that's incredible I I for you know if you think about my brown sister it's an incredible thing that we can go through all the motions and all these things and have all the experiences and hear somebody still have a question am I safe and we see this a lot even in the message people who come up they've been attending churches for for 30 years and they say I want the Holy Ghost and there's a question in their life am I saved am I really saved and they're asking that because there's something going on in their life watch brother Brandon's response here I believe with all my heart that you are a real Born Again believer that's powerful okay now this and I hope to settle some things uh for for anyone here who may have any doubts or fears about am I really sealed in um am I really saved you know she just something happened in her life that set her off a little bit made her nervous made her question and here he confirms to her I believe with all my heart that you are a real born-again believer and yet she finds herself in this condition Bruce he says how could that Spirit just leave he says when you get sick you get weary he says and you are a nervous type person oh my this is good he says you're just a nervous type person but she's the one serving in the congregation she's the one she's the prayer Warrior you know she's the one that that skin the Holy Spirit comes in and will discern on her behalf amen and healings take place and the throat cancer comes out and I mean you're a nervous type person wow that's I'm so encouraged by that you know if we can go through these little things in our lives it doesn't change what God has done for our as as far as our Salvation goes you're a nervous type person Bruce says yes see and you get things on your mind you overthink it you just overthink it you know little things happen and you just overthink it you get things on your mind see little bitty things man it's not like she went out into the world it's not like she started drinking and smoking no it's just the weariness of everyday Christian walk serving in the congregation playing the instruments coming to church you know just that everyday walk and yet she was a nervous type person in all her servitude and all her her her experiences yet she had this little nervous type personality and it but it caused her to start questioning it started it caused her to to wonder am I really saved isn't that that's so precious to me you know that God isn't looking at our weaknesses huh he's looking at his finished work it's already done you're a nervous type person yes and you get things on your mind and and they're little bitty things oh my if you're that kind of person I say just just I hope this really gets a hold of you tonight these little bitty things he says and it just keeps building up both ways he says you're you'll get somebody on your heart so see this isn't just like evil things this is she's she's a real Warrior in the congregation he says you'll get someone on your heart and you want to pray for them and you get up and you pray for it and you can't rest till you get that person prayed for just so on fire just so um in you know in passion and in love and and just wants to do something for people and she gets a burden on her heart and she cannot rest until that person has been prayed for this is not a bad thing but see that that kind of approach you know it causes her flesh to to battle with her right he says that is the real you he says that's you he says then take that on the other side and Satan maybe might want to present something to you that you and out this way he kind of is a little bit vager he says see then God you and you're a nature and God works and Satan works and then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not see you keep building this and maybe this and this see in her mind she keeps building this thing see he says now this is powerful right here he says don't look at yourself sister Bruce he says remember he says I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy of that I think what would I do if Jesus was sitting here now and what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay hands his hands upon you and with his great faith see you would get well well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I'm I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman says it again just lays it right in there I believe that you are a genuine Christian woman he says I remember Sister Bruce says this is funny because he said it twice now he's made it very clear I mean this should settle it by now right but then she says she interrupts him he says I remember the thing and she interrupts she says it says sister Bruce says sister Bruce says right I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times she said oh man I could just we just put our own names in there sometimes right he says that's why brother Branham then says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes it wouldn't be allotted to you see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him how many here desires to serve him he says your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce says yes he says all right he says that's what he died for it's so you can serve him he says see it's not your mistakes are not even looked at they're not even allotted to you Oh my he says he is your perpetuation see he is your sin offering your sins are not even known you're not a sinner before God oh my that's that's powerful he says Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him it's so simple she has a desire to serve God and and he's looking at her desire in her heart and he's and look at the the kind of things he's telling her Christ took your sins became you because your desire is to serve him sister Bruce says but I never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost this is so good because you know we get young people growing up in in our churches in our message churches and they're looking for experiences I've never had that great big something you know and I can attest to this I've never had that Earth shaking you know where I was smoking and drinking before and now I'm not right great testimonies and I love those testimonies but see look at this woman who is serving God she was in the line of duty and giving her heart to the Lord and serving God's people and she's admitting she's saying I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I can put my foot on wow so now what now what I want to hear it feels that way Lord I I would like you know I've never had that experience that I can really put my finger on but yet I love you and yet I want to serve you and I want to serve your people and God I have a desire to do better and to and to love you and you know right just simple such a simple thing he's told her twice now you're a real genuine born-again Christian and yet she's still battling with that I haven't had that experience all right notice this he says ordinary ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being the sister Bruce says yes he says that was your nature and then he says it changed once what changed it she says Christ and here's his response there you are sister it's so simple huh You're basically your desires were changed somewhere somewhere along the line your desires have changed you want to serve God what makes you serve God the devil the devil doesn't make you serve God absolutely not no he'd rather see you out there in the world right so here we find that her desires were changed something happened in her life and he's saying what changed that and she recognized yeah Christ did that amen he says that's it there you are sister see John 5 here I've got one more slide here for you John 5 24 says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past from Death unto life I'm going to hear believes how many years heard the word being preached how many here has taken that word and say Lord I believe that is nothing but the truth everlasting life Prophet says he that heareth my words is going on now in this interview he says he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but hath past tense he says past from Death to life he says and he refers to Saint John 5 24 Jesus speaking that's why I put the scripture up for you and now he goes on he says so you he says you you're you're a Christian sister Bruce you're a Christian it reminds her again he says I've watched your life I've watched you under vision and I know you're a Christian see not one spec he says see I am your Shepherd as it was Sister Bruce says yes somebody to help you see if there was any doubt in my mind if I thought you was there was something wrong I would tell you sister Bruce she says I believe that but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything wrong between you and God as far as I know anything about it sister Bruce there is not a thing there's not one thing and then he says we're going to pray sister Bruce says course I'm going to die unless God undertakes for the heart he says you're not going to die I don't think so sister Bruce if it is it's hid from me sister Bruce says thank you brother now this is the prayer so even even after all this she says I'm I'm going to die just nervous little lady huh little things working on her emotions or her thoughts or her memories whatever it may be just emotional wreck you know and you can see how the prophet is laying that in laying that in all the time you're there's nothing wrong with you you know God saved you there at that at that altar that those many years ago God did something eternally It's Already Done Right and yet she's battling and battling a nervous little lady and she's serving God and all these things hmm this is the prayer now he says Dear God this little woman has constantly constantly done good and sister Bruce says oh God exclamation mark he says she has tried like Dorcas of old and now she is getting this time of her heart which is very bad she says oh my but did not your word that we put our whole soul and mind in say that all things work together for good to them that loves you then it must be that you're working something that we don't know nothing about and she says thank you God he says it's all for the good for she loves you now to the great Shepherd over all of us the Lord Jesus Christ and in his name I lay my hands upon my sister may The God Who made her and brought her it to this earth may his spirit that sealed her away from the things of the world to be your servant may it heal her sick body make her completely well for we need her in the service Lord I commit her to you with this prayer of faith my hands laying upon her to identify myself with the prayer and say to this mountain in the name of Jesus Christ be moved that our sister may live to the kingdom of God and for the glory of God and end of interview let's stand you know the message has been around for a while there's been hundreds if not thousands upon hundreds of thousands of sermons preached testimonies experiences vindications and yet we still find to this day people ourselves questioning Lord am I really saved and I just wanted to encourage you tonight if you had an experience if you came to an altar once you gave your heart to the Lord God God would not cast you away amen if you come to God he will not turn you away all that come to me right and my brother sister you know I think of of the Simplicity of her salvation she was saved that night it was finished it didn't matter that she was going to face things later on it didn't matter that she would get a little bit nervous here and there and her faith might waver a little bit know her salvation held you know we can lose the joy of our salvation but you cannot lose your salvation that's why David prayed to restore unto me the joy of my salvation you see we can go through troubles but my brother says I want to encourage you tonight if God has done a work in your life if your desires have changed and you're serving God then just have faith in him just have faith in him the work is already done amen we can get nervous we can we can get anxious and we can get worried and all these things and and even in well-doing we can be weary but it doesn't change the the grip of God's salvation you cannot be unsaved amen once you are sealed you're sealed until the day of your Redemption and I just want to encourage you tonight if if you've ever had that experience if you've ever given your heart to the Lord if you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know someone said to me once how do I know I got I got the Holy Ghost and I said to them have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you repented have you gone through all those things that's required and he said yes and I said well then God said so God said you have the Holy Ghost God said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not simple see we're trying to over complicate it you know we try and look for a sensation or we look for this or wait till the next camp meeting or you know we and we gauge our Salvation on these things we've got to be careful with that you know and if you have a nervous type kind of character just remember maybe you put on your fridge somewhere you know if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ down the house shall be saved you know put something on there that reminds you that it's gonna be okay God loves you he cares about you and I love how that God had a prophet in our day have a private interview with someone point out these little things in her life and and tell her it's going to be okay you are a Christian amen cannot can we say that tonight I am a Christian amen let's bow our heads this evening and if you have anything on your heart tonight I mean struggling with something or you know just whatever you know you can lay it at the altar tonight just say Lord you know there's been questions or maybe I'm going through something or I've taken a detour even whatever that is but Lord I know you did something for me that you changed my desires and that is why I feel that pull tonight I feel that you've done something for me Lord and I want more of you tonight and maybe you haven't had an experience maybe you haven't given your heart holy unto the Lord well tonight's the night and it doesn't have to be an evangelist here it doesn't have to be some great big thing going on here you can just simply come and say Lord I I come to you tonight amen I I want that salvation I want that Holy Ghost that that people are talking about I want that experience with the Lord he hears and he answers pray if you knock on his door tonight the Bible tells us he will open it unto you if you seek him you will find him amen don't overthink it God loves you he cares about you he'll take care of you the rest of your journey amen let's buy our heads this evening grace is Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your promises we're so thankful Lord for your word Lord and the power Lord and the Vindication and all these things you've given to us we've seen all the Miracles we've seen the great testimonies in our midst Lord and father we've experienced Lord the outpouring of your Holy Spirit Lord in our meetings and in our lives Lord we've felt the power of your love and and our hearts Lord and all these things and yet Lord we can still get to places in our in our walk Lord where we get a little weary nor do we get a little worried or anxious Lord or whatever it may be oh God tonight we just want to rest in your arms father and Lord and we accept Lord this little private interview this this little Parable that we find in the message Lord this woman that you allow to go through all these experiences the everyday things Lord this little prayer Warrior Lord and yet even heard Lord came to a place where her little eagle eyes got dimmed over and Lord getting up in years Lord God and just Lord knowing that some of the struggles that she may have faced so God and yet Lord he had a prophet on the scene to say Lord that you Lord when you do a work of Salvation it's a complete work oh God we don't have to worry about how strong that salvation is or how strong your blood is our sins are not even allotted to us so God and Lord even our mistakes Lord you don't even see them Lord all you hear is our voice coming through the blood Lord we're so thankful for that tonight Lord we're thankful for that finished work we're thankful for the blood Lord that that washes us and sanctifies us and keeps us holy before you Lord we thank you for your love and your mercies that are new Every Morning Lord we thank you for these simple truths that we have to carry us along the way and father
