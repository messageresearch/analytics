[38:47] get a little bit of perspective I mean
[38:49] we can see that that there is something

[39:49] spirituality on you know how much I can
[39:52] sit through a three-hour sermon and I
[39:54] blah blah blah you know that's that's

[50:28] he went in therefore and shut the door
[50:30] upon the Twain and prayed unto the Lord

[50:35] and put his mouth upon his mouth and his
[50:38] eyes upon his eyes
[50:40] and his hands upon his hands and he
[50:43] stretched himself upon the child and the
[50:45] Flesh of the child waxed warm then he
[50:48] returned and walked in the house to and
[50:50] fro and went up and stretched himself
[50:52] upon him and the child sneezed seven
[50:55] times and the child opened his eyes may
[50:59] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[51:01] of his words we may be seated
[51:05] so
[51:07] I really want to greet you for the as
[51:10] far as I understand the last service for
[51:12] this year that we have together is that
[51:14] is that correct yes and uh I really want
[51:19] to bring you again the greetings I see
[51:21] some of the brothers and sisters uh came
[51:24] here new and I wish you all from our
[51:26] hearts God's blessings and I would love
[51:29] to enter directly into that mystery of
[51:32] the shunamite woman and I'm hoping that
[51:34] we understand we were talking about us
[51:37] and um got quite some a lot of
[51:39] compliments for the preaching of this
[51:41] morning and happy for this uh and I want
[51:45] to say this we have to understand one
[51:47] thing we are just a team that plays
[51:49] together I mean I got inspired by about
[51:52] the Adrian's uh quotes about about the
[51:55] theophany and I got inspired by Abra
[51:58] Murray about his his video that he made
[52:00] about timepieces of God I mean how often
[52:03] did I see this how much was it revealing
[52:05] the plan of God for me
[52:07] how maybe I won't even mention in some
[52:10] of the preaching some of the sources but
[52:11] the dean told to me you know that that I
[52:14] didn't forget when we were talking
[52:15] sitting on on the couch together and so
[52:18] we are just
[52:19] team and uh uh as I said the winning
[52:22] team because I always call it the Dream
[52:24] Team
[52:25] God's dream team and I would love to
[52:27] enter directly into the word of the Lord
[52:30] if it says fine for you and uh make a
[52:33] little teaching about it and a little
[52:35] help for each and everyone uh not to to
[52:38] to to lose too much time and uh as
[52:41] brother said the brother said I will not
[52:42] be long
[52:44] but long enough
[52:45] [Laughter]
[52:50] so I thank you again too that you have
[52:52] uh Grace with me with my kind of humor
[52:56] you you have more patience than my wife
[52:58] and my daughter
[53:00] they always say papa you are so
[53:01] embarrassing I said hey I'm cool I'm hip
[53:05] [Laughter]
[53:12] so so so
[53:14] um from the service from this morning
[53:16] it's quite an interesting subject and I
[53:18] and I come just enough I put off my
[53:20] jacket a little bit later
[53:22] um
[53:23] a little bit of the old school please
[53:25] please I said I will purposely on Monday
[53:28] I will have a blue shirt only that you
[53:30] see another German anymore huh
[53:32] but but I'm a little bit of your old
[53:33] school white shirt and all these things
[53:35] but this is has nothing to do with the
[53:37] message this is just the traditional
[53:40] Lutheran okay but but I would purposely
[53:43] I come I would change on Monday about it
[53:46] okay so I'm converted into a true uh to
[53:51] New Zealand
[53:52] I will not start with the Haka huh
[53:56] I was not starting that service like
[53:58] this okay but
[54:00] so I said today this morning it's quite
[54:02] interesting the time that I was talking
[54:03] about was the time between the day of
[54:07] Pentecost and the first church age
[54:10] remember it's a mystery because there's
[54:12] a quota brother REM said the Ephesian
[54:14] church was not seduced they were not
[54:16] deceived but they left the first love
[54:19] and there is no contradiction to what I
[54:21] said this morning because we were
[54:22] talking about the time before the
[54:25] Ephesian Church
[54:26] Ephesus Church because brother blame
[54:28] said or the the every Bible reader says
[54:30] the day of Pentecost was 30 up depending
[54:33] on the calculation 33 after Christ A.D
[54:37] brother Ben starts the first church at
[54:39] 53 so in between about 20 years
[54:43] that was already the fall of the church
[54:45] and Paul came to church was already a
[54:48] fallen woman okay and remember that
[54:50] brother blame said when the Holy Spirit
[54:51] felt the Antichrist Philip fell exactly
[54:54] at the same time and we always thought
[54:56] for many many years that the church fell
[54:58] at night cruel my brother Remy said a
[55:00] different time it fell at nicely around
[55:02] but in the seals he said it fell in the
[55:04] beginning but it was crowned at night
[55:09] it fell already there but the crown it
[55:11] received a nice year room so so just if
[55:14] if somebody reads this you have to
[55:16] really put it into the right right order
[55:18] and and I would love this afternoon
[55:21] again speak to your heart okay and I
[55:24] would love to to to to to to to to speak
[55:26] about our Heavenly fathers something
[55:28] that we have in common
[55:30] um normally when I'm preaching I realize
[55:32] that we have quite a bunch of young
[55:34] people here okay and whenever I make a
[55:37] teaching I have always a sequence of
[55:39] talking to the young people and when I'm
[55:40] talking to the young people I always
[55:41] have a sequence of teaching uh so that
[55:44] everybody I love that everybody can go
[55:47] out and say I got something okay for you
[55:50] as the youngsters we never be please
[55:52] never be frustrated
[55:54] if a minister prepares a service that he
[55:56] takes weeks and months and weeks and
[55:58] months for that okay so nobody expects
[56:01] for you to go out and repeat everything
[56:03] that was said if you get five percent
[56:05] that's perfect
[56:06] that's perfect just get the picture
[56:08] because the next one will build upon
[56:10] that same Rock
[56:11] I'm a remember there's a lot of thinking
[56:14] a lot of praying a lot of reading to put
[56:16] just into 90 minutes okay and and so uh
[56:20] uh but we are adding to our faith all
[56:24] these things so the story of the
[56:26] shunamite
[56:27] uh of Elijah and the shunamide starts
[56:31] with a story that the prophet Elisha was
[56:35] in Israel
[56:37] in Israel they didn't like their
[56:40] Prophets
[56:42] by the way they were extremely
[56:44] respectless to them
[56:47] and we remember that Elisha was Elisha
[56:51] was it Elijah
[56:52] that went through Israel and these young
[56:55] people made fun
[56:57] about it called him bald heads
[57:00] brother Branham was a young man and he
[57:03] had a problem with his hairdresser and
[57:06] the hairdresser put some liquid on his
[57:08] head so he became bold it was not the
[57:10] problem of the headrest it was God
[57:12] ordaining the man to do the wrong thing
[57:14] because brother Ben was typing the
[57:16] Prophet Elijah therefore he was bold on
[57:19] his back
[57:20] and what happened is these youngsters
[57:23] they made fun of the Prophet Elijah
[57:27] and
[57:28] the prophet was so much in Anger that he
[57:31] called a she-bear
[57:32] and killed 42 of these youngsters
[57:35] and brothers said it was not the fault
[57:38] of the children
[57:40] it was the fault of the parents
[57:42] the prophet said
[57:44] what the parents said behind the
[57:47] curtains that's what the children said
[57:49] on the streets
[57:51] that is what I was telling this morning
[57:53] if you want to teach your children
[57:54] something teach them to respect people
[57:57] teach them to respect Ministries even if
[58:01] you don't agree fully but put a man of
[58:04] God into God's hand God will take care
[58:06] of him
[58:08] we nobody needs your commentary your
[58:11] comment nobody needs my command be sure
[58:14] of that God will put everything into it
[58:17] into the right channel even a minister
[58:19] is growing
[58:21] never forget he's growing in his
[58:23] ministry he is growing in his Revelation
[58:26] he is he is just amen so what happened
[58:29] is
[58:30] I remember we had a we had a brother in
[58:33] our church and everybody was Jezebel
[58:35] everybody the kindergartens were Jezebel
[58:38] the school teachers were Jezebels the
[58:41] neighbors everybody was Jezebel and
[58:44] one day the neighbors a true story one
[58:47] day the neighbor was ringing at the door
[58:49] and the little boy opens the door he
[58:52] said Papa Jesse Bell is at the door
[58:55] so so that happens if we if if we don't
[58:58] pay attention
[59:00] that message taught us feeling
[59:04] taught us respect
[59:06] amen because
[59:08] if somebody let me say you see a bump on
[59:11] the street you see a uh somebody who's
[59:14] who's living on the street
[59:16] brother Graham said
[59:18] he might be nothing for us but he is a
[59:21] son of a mama
[59:23] and maybe he's a daddy of a little girl
[59:26] for us he's nobody for that little girl
[59:28] she's he's Daddy
[59:30] amen never forget that every human being
[59:32] is made in the image of God whatever he
[59:35] believes whatever he is you cannot
[59:38] produce a bride a bride comes from the
[59:40] presence of God she's part of him so
[59:43] what happens is that that uh that that
[59:47] the Prophet Elijah he just went to a
[59:49] city and he seems to make a miracle
[59:52] and here is that shunamite woman and her
[59:55] husband and they see what the Prophet
[59:57] Elijah did
[59:59] and they had Grace enough to invite the
[1:00:02] man into their home
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] Elijah never had a t-shirt by the name
[1:00:09] of prophet Elisha
[1:00:11] but somehow God opened the eye of that
[1:00:15] woman
[1:00:16] to see who that man was
[1:00:19] it was the same holy spirit that opened
[1:00:21] your eyes
[1:00:23] things in the in the economy of God are
[1:00:26] Supernatural remember when the Prophet
[1:00:29] Elijah came to that widow woman from
[1:00:31] sabraptor the Bible says I commanded a
[1:00:36] widow woman
[1:00:37] the Bible never said she had a dream she
[1:00:40] saw a vision she heard a voice but in
[1:00:43] her subconscious God acted through her
[1:00:46] that she made the right decision maybe
[1:00:48] she didn't know what she was doing but
[1:00:50] it was God ordaining her
[1:00:53] when a when a person gives his heart to
[1:00:56] the Lord
[1:00:57] be sure it's not her head
[1:01:01] it must be her heart his heart have you
[1:01:04] ever seen when there was some kind like
[1:01:06] a calling and your heart was faster than
[1:01:09] your head
[1:01:10] I mean that was my conversion I was
[1:01:12] faster at the altar than I thought that
[1:01:14] I could I could think about that that is
[1:01:17] that little piece of God that he placed
[1:01:20] in our heart responding
[1:01:22] amen so he didn't just say that woman oh
[1:01:25] that's
[1:01:26] oh that's man and God bless you we were
[1:01:28] blessed
[1:01:29] they were they were entertaining
[1:01:33] that profit to come into their home
[1:01:37] now what she did she was preparing a
[1:01:41] room for him
[1:01:43] here we are again in the tent Vision
[1:01:45] that little room which is prepared
[1:01:48] we are waiting that God does tremendous
[1:01:51] things
[1:01:53] but we are not expecting another public
[1:01:56] show that must be so clear
[1:01:59] we don't expect another Pentecost
[1:02:01] Revival because brother Graham is that
[1:02:03] the Revival is over
[1:02:06] but he said the bride did not have her
[1:02:09] Revival yet that means it will be a
[1:02:12] Revival but different than we had it in
[1:02:14] the past
[1:02:16] don't look for some Pentecostalism
[1:02:18] because you might look in the wrong
[1:02:20] corner and God does tremendous things
[1:02:23] but it doesn't fit into our program
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:27] so she prepared a little room and
[1:02:31] brother Brian said this
[1:02:33] it doesn't have to be a cave it doesn't
[1:02:35] have to be a special room
[1:02:37] but it should be a place in our hearts
[1:02:41] where God can come and go whenever he
[1:02:44] wants
[1:02:46] to take inventory
[1:02:49] I remember I was a young boy newly
[1:02:51] converted to the Lord
[1:02:53] and I love the Lord and I do it more
[1:02:56] than I did in the beginning and I'm sure
[1:02:58] I'm talking to people who feel exactly
[1:03:00] the same way exactly the same way we're
[1:03:02] not brandemites we are Christians
[1:03:04] we love the Lord Jesus with all of our
[1:03:07] hearts huh and what happens when I was
[1:03:10] reading that story of of of Christmas
[1:03:13] then I found out that when Mary arrived
[1:03:17] over there in Bethlehem there was no
[1:03:19] room
[1:03:20] every Inn every every Hotel was closed
[1:03:24] you see that God is in humor
[1:03:27] God knows what he does Amen in the time
[1:03:30] of Jesus all the hotels all the Inns
[1:03:34] were closed we're full and he had to go
[1:03:38] in some some kind like a like a cave
[1:03:42] amen so that Christ could be born
[1:03:45] when the seals were open the later part
[1:03:48] of brother Branson's Ministry the
[1:03:50] churches were closed
[1:03:52] amen but what did God open the hotels
[1:03:56] I mean because the Christian businessmen
[1:03:58] they were not gathering in churches they
[1:04:01] gathered into hotels
[1:04:03] so most of our greatest sermons that we
[1:04:06] have the choosing of a bride Ramada Inn
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] great Services holiday in Tucson amen
[1:04:15] Cafe Bowl so-and-so I'm in Clifton's
[1:04:19] Cafeteria the choosing of a bride God
[1:04:22] left the church and went into the hotels
[1:04:27] God knows what he does
[1:04:29] amen he takes whatever he can
[1:04:32] so when I was reading that story I was
[1:04:34] just praying I said Heavenly Father you
[1:04:36] have no place
[1:04:37] in in laodicea I realized that but in my
[1:04:40] heart I want to give you praise
[1:04:43] Amen Let My Life be for your glory and
[1:04:47] for your honor if I'm a middle I never
[1:04:49] thought that I would become a minister
[1:04:50] but that has nothing to do let me be
[1:04:53] just a Christian and show to the world
[1:04:56] that this message is not a theory this
[1:04:58] message is Christ himself
[1:05:01] can you say Amen
[1:05:03] so so so they opened there's room for
[1:05:06] the prophet and for gehazi
[1:05:09] and let me start by this
[1:05:12] there is nothing that you can do for God
[1:05:15] unless he pays it back
[1:05:17] it's nothing
[1:05:19] whatever you do God
[1:05:23] remembers it
[1:05:25] God is your Rewards
[1:05:27] brother this message is not Social
[1:05:30] Gospel please do not expect everyone
[1:05:32] always clapping on your shoulder how
[1:05:35] good you are and how happy we are that
[1:05:37] you came to church thank you very much
[1:05:39] we are free you do these things for your
[1:05:41] own sake
[1:05:44] hallelujah amen because after some time
[1:05:48] after some years it was not that woman
[1:05:51] going to the Prophet Elijah and saying
[1:05:54] look man I mean I come all these here to
[1:05:56] church I pay my tight things I do this
[1:05:58] I'm the one who has to clean all the
[1:06:01] time I mean where is now my reward that
[1:06:03] was not her attitude
[1:06:05] and it was not even the prophet said
[1:06:07] look I mean what can we do for that
[1:06:09] woman how much she was always so nice
[1:06:11] but it was God's remembering what she
[1:06:15] did
[1:06:17] and God spoke to the prophet speaker
[1:06:20] whatever she wants
[1:06:22] and remember that's the same God
[1:06:25] speaking to Hattie Wright thousands of
[1:06:28] years later
[1:06:29] the same attitude caused the same God on
[1:06:32] the scene
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:35] blessing is not a question of Doctrine
[1:06:38] blessing is a question of attitude
[1:06:40] towards god brother you can be wrong in
[1:06:43] your Doctrine but if your heart is right
[1:06:45] God brings you on the way
[1:06:48] but I've seen sometimes people they were
[1:06:50] very strongly adopting but they had an
[1:06:52] arrogant spirit and God will not bless
[1:06:54] this absolutely no
[1:06:56] so we see how God really remembers and I
[1:07:01] want to show some examples about this
[1:07:04] and we will then we go a little bit in
[1:07:06] the in a deep teaching about it you help
[1:07:08] me the brothers
[1:07:09] exactly so I know that I was preaching
[1:07:12] that subject years ago when I was in New
[1:07:16] Zealand I know about that I know I'm
[1:07:18] over 50.
[1:07:20] and I'm forgetting many things but I'm
[1:07:22] writing down what I was preaching
[1:07:23] therefore I know the titles
[1:07:27] but we will change it a little bit this
[1:07:29] is such a good group such a good
[1:07:30] atmosphere that we can bring in a little
[1:07:32] bit on a higher level
[1:07:34] a little bit for eagle's food okay
[1:07:36] definitely so yeah I'm pretty sure that
[1:07:39] here is quite Eagles together
[1:07:41] now this is Eric Liddell
[1:07:44] Eric Lindell was a young minister in the
[1:07:47] time of
[1:07:48] the beginning of last century
[1:07:51] and what happens is that he was a
[1:07:54] believer
[1:07:55] in I think in the Methodist Church
[1:07:57] whatever he was a runner and they called
[1:07:59] him the Scottish locomotive he was a
[1:08:03] fast runner
[1:08:05] his life was put together in a film by
[1:08:08] the name's Chariots of Fire so he was
[1:08:12] studying he should start in the Olympic
[1:08:14] game I think it was 1924 but I'm not
[1:08:17] positive sure Bob if you see the picture
[1:08:19] you can see definitely that was he was a
[1:08:22] Christian and he was a runner he was a
[1:08:24] sportsman
[1:08:25] so he came into two finals one please
[1:08:30] don't I think it was a thousand meters
[1:08:31] and the second one was two thousand or
[1:08:33] three thousand something like this no
[1:08:35] matter
[1:08:36] in both he came into the final race
[1:08:40] and the for one of the races he was
[1:08:43] absolutely favorite
[1:08:45] he was going for gold
[1:08:48] the second one he had not much chance
[1:08:52] but the one where he was going for gold
[1:08:55] was on a Sunday
[1:08:57] and Eric bidel refused to run on a
[1:09:01] Sunday
[1:09:02] you can call it legalism I call it
[1:09:05] revelation
[1:09:06] I call it revelation
[1:09:08] because he remembered what Sunday means
[1:09:11] for God
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] so he refused and these people they are
[1:09:17] just
[1:09:19] even the government the British
[1:09:21] government made pressure on him because
[1:09:22] he went for gold but he said I will not
[1:09:25] run on a Sunday Sunday is the day of the
[1:09:29] Lord
[1:09:30] I always say this Sunday is not barbecue
[1:09:33] day
[1:09:34] Sunday is not the day to change the
[1:09:37] tires
[1:09:38] Sunday is our Shabbat
[1:09:42] it's the time to think about
[1:09:44] eternal things
[1:09:46] it's the grace of God to lay down to
[1:09:49] come to rest and to think about
[1:09:51] eternal thoughts you have six days to
[1:09:54] work
[1:09:55] the seventh day is to rest and to think
[1:09:58] about things that are higher than just
[1:10:00] work
[1:10:01] amen so he refused and got that pressure
[1:10:06] and what happened is that he then went
[1:10:10] into the final of the course of the race
[1:10:13] where he was not a favorite at all
[1:10:16] and the American trainer the American
[1:10:18] coach came and put a little leaflet into
[1:10:22] his hand and Eric Lydell is a true story
[1:10:24] true testimony he put that leaflet into
[1:10:27] his back pockets
[1:10:29] and when he was running
[1:10:31] then
[1:10:33] eyewitnesses say it was like he was
[1:10:36] energized
[1:10:38] and he was winning that that contest he
[1:10:40] made he would he made Olympic gold
[1:10:43] I mean I became later a preacher in in
[1:10:46] the Anglican church or whatever hmm
[1:10:49] so
[1:10:50] as a big surprise he he was running for
[1:10:54] gold
[1:10:56] and when he later put out of the pocket
[1:11:00] a little leaflets that he got from the
[1:11:02] American coach from the U.S coach
[1:11:05] it was a leaflet of the Bible
[1:11:08] of the book of the story of Eli and his
[1:11:10] sons
[1:11:11] and he was reading
[1:11:13] I honor those who honor me
[1:11:19] brother whatever we do we must do it by
[1:11:22] love for God
[1:11:25] the dressing
[1:11:26] we don't have a church called dress code
[1:11:28] we don't have but we have something that
[1:11:31] pleases to God
[1:11:32] if you're a Christian you have a feeling
[1:11:35] what pleases unto God and what is not
[1:11:37] pleasing unto God
[1:11:39] can you say Amen
[1:11:41] if you pay your tithesis just people who
[1:11:44] want to discuss about paying your
[1:11:45] tithing I said brother you don't have a
[1:11:47] revelation what goes along with that
[1:11:50] foreign
[1:11:51] keep your tithing for yourself but you
[1:11:53] will pay for it
[1:11:55] because there's a blessing
[1:11:57] understanding following God's rules and
[1:12:00] God will bless you abundantly
[1:12:03] I said if you want to economize money
[1:12:06] please pay your tithings he said you say
[1:12:09] I never got a cash back from God
[1:12:12] I said yes
[1:12:14] at motor
[1:12:15] that should have cracked after a hundred
[1:12:17] thousand miles God tells to all these
[1:12:20] molecules and all these I mean that man
[1:12:22] is a faithful man you run up to 300 000
[1:12:25] miles
[1:12:26] because our God is the God of all
[1:12:28] dimensions
[1:12:30] um it matters to serve the Lord
[1:12:34] it's a question of Revelation it's not a
[1:12:36] question of legalism it's a question of
[1:12:39] Revelation whatever you do
[1:12:41] brother God is watching you every mile
[1:12:44] that you go
[1:12:45] I tell you one thing
[1:12:47] he loves to give to people
[1:12:51] he loves to give you a little gift why
[1:12:56] that because he is a father
[1:12:58] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:13:01] angel the the mystery of God is revealed
[1:13:04] and brother Abraham said God's mystery
[1:13:06] he is he wanted to be a father all the
[1:13:09] time a father likes to bless his
[1:13:12] children amen
[1:13:15] you say I love Jesus but you don't know
[1:13:17] how Jesus how he much love how much he
[1:13:19] loves you amen
[1:13:21] I remember God remembers those things
[1:13:24] because
[1:13:26] it's a little story but there is a truce
[1:13:28] behind and I know I I was showing it to
[1:13:31] you to the Elder one years ago
[1:13:33] when we came to the message
[1:13:36] I mean we're a little bit younger I'm
[1:13:38] I'm good in shape because I had a
[1:13:40] slipped disc in my back so I have to
[1:13:42] make bodybuilding again so that's the
[1:13:44] doctor he told me you have to do because
[1:13:45] if not we have to make an operation so
[1:13:47] but when I was young I was even more in
[1:13:49] shape
[1:13:50] so we came to the Lord and we're really
[1:13:53] honestly said
[1:13:55] whole Germany comes to the message of
[1:13:58] the hour
[1:13:59] by Marcus Becker
[1:14:03] yeah yeah brother we were we were young
[1:14:07] and we were we we had a lot of ambitions
[1:14:12] and we had a lot of naivety
[1:14:14] and God has a very nice way to take all
[1:14:17] naivety out of us
[1:14:18] he said okay my son let's let's run a
[1:14:21] little bit brother and then God takes
[1:14:24] that gold and he gives him some beatings
[1:14:26] that is part of our training amen and
[1:14:30] here we are here's Marcus vicker
[1:14:36] and today we pray dear friends we say
[1:14:39] Lord keep me on the way
[1:14:41] Lord be with me help me to please you in
[1:14:45] all things
[1:14:46] because we learned one thing without God
[1:14:48] we cannot do anything
[1:14:50] you can try to change your family you
[1:14:53] can try to put the television out you
[1:14:55] can try to stop smoking and it will not
[1:14:57] work you throw it out and it comes back
[1:14:59] later
[1:15:01] but once God takes care of his we'll
[1:15:05] never come back again
[1:15:07] now I want to tell you to your oldest
[1:15:09] older older brothers and sisters I'm
[1:15:11] more now on your side and
[1:15:14] there's many prayers that we were
[1:15:17] praying When We Were Young
[1:15:18] Heavenly Father we want to serve you we
[1:15:21] want to do this and we want to do that
[1:15:23] and and brother over the years we have
[1:15:26] forgotten our own prayers
[1:15:29] but God did not forget them
[1:15:31] for God our prayer of 50 years ago is
[1:15:35] still there
[1:15:36] time means nothing for God
[1:15:39] age is nothing for God he because he's
[1:15:41] the master of all dimension
[1:15:44] his brother his brother Billy Paul and
[1:15:46] he gives that little example and we know
[1:15:48] this but it just shows how it so matters
[1:15:52] in 2023 to say look for me and my house
[1:15:56] we serve the Lord we have no option
[1:15:59] brother Branham is there
[1:16:01] and we don't have to talk about miracles
[1:16:03] of problem because we see in a church
[1:16:05] today but not in that measure that he
[1:16:07] had for sure but here comes that little
[1:16:09] girl and and and and she is obviously
[1:16:12] she's crippled
[1:16:14] and brother Billy Paul tells the story
[1:16:17] that girl says in that little cartoon in
[1:16:20] that little um the shoes because I
[1:16:22] believe if you pray for me I can walk
[1:16:24] and brother Brahm says to that girl why
[1:16:27] don't you sit over there
[1:16:28] and then Billy Paul said to his brother
[1:16:30] Ben told her he said please stay a
[1:16:32] little bit in church so that your little
[1:16:34] faith can raise up that's the reason we
[1:16:37] come to church
[1:16:39] streaming will never replace that
[1:16:42] you can stream Marcus Becker every day
[1:16:45] it is just entertainment don't forget it
[1:16:48] it's just nice knowledge about what
[1:16:50] Marcus know you must eat the book
[1:16:53] yourself
[1:16:55] nobody will eat it for you nobody will
[1:16:58] digest it for you you must eat that book
[1:17:04] I mean thank you I was waiting for
[1:17:05] somebody say hey
[1:17:08] and after a couple of hours one or two
[1:17:11] hours
[1:17:12] uh brother Ben was just praying for the
[1:17:15] people and behind him was his brother
[1:17:17] Donnie
[1:17:19] and he was sitting behind brother
[1:17:20] Brennan when he sings in his mind and
[1:17:22] sings in his heart hey Billy forgot
[1:17:25] about that girl who was sitting there or
[1:17:27] maybe he doesn't have faith for that
[1:17:30] little girl and he wants to dismiss us
[1:17:32] and then the little girl he was not
[1:17:33] prayed for and he was just thinking in
[1:17:35] his heart and in that moment brother
[1:17:37] Brian turns around he said no no Donny I
[1:17:40] didn't forget her
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:45] something that is as much higher than
[1:17:46] and he said and Jesus did not forget her
[1:17:48] neither
[1:17:51] brother if you if you consecrate
[1:17:54] into the law
[1:17:56] and they are in the
[1:17:58] Heap your faith in what you did don't
[1:18:02] look on the circumstances Lord they are
[1:18:04] dedicated to you and you will call them
[1:18:06] when your time comes you will call them
[1:18:08] can you say Amen
[1:18:10] deaf whatever you do if you dedicate a
[1:18:13] child if you dedicate your marriage do
[1:18:16] it in faith not as a religious act and
[1:18:20] God will bless what you did
[1:18:23] okay say Amen
[1:18:25] a young girl and a young boy want to
[1:18:27] marry and say brother America's uh we
[1:18:30] love one another I have different time
[1:18:31] this kid you've taken care a little bit
[1:18:33] of young people we love one another but
[1:18:35] uh we need time you know spiritually and
[1:18:38] and I said one thing is sure but the
[1:18:41] Brahman said only born-again people can
[1:18:44] marry
[1:18:45] it's no way around forget it no way
[1:18:47] around
[1:18:48] because I was preaching this morning of
[1:18:51] giving the Next Generation a vision
[1:18:54] how can you give your children a vision
[1:18:56] if you don't have a vision yourself
[1:18:58] forget it you can just bring them to
[1:19:00] church and they will sleep in the church
[1:19:02] like you do
[1:19:04] not you but
[1:19:05] [Laughter]
[1:19:08] but I said hey if you are a teenager and
[1:19:10] there is a there is such a love between
[1:19:12] you both and this is pure it's right
[1:19:14] it's not sensual not sexual not immoral
[1:19:17] there's a true love to one another why
[1:19:20] don't you both find the Lord together
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:24] and search for the Holy Ghost together
[1:19:25] and make that romance to become a
[1:19:29] spiritual union that nobody can break up
[1:19:31] it's amen God allows these things that
[1:19:35] somebody gets in love before is really
[1:19:36] born again so that both are now bringing
[1:19:39] themselves up into the Throne of God he
[1:19:42] said we come together to church and we
[1:19:44] pray together
[1:19:45] can you say amen God can take big great
[1:19:49] Miracles if we just come in the right
[1:19:51] line so please make the next okay I'll
[1:19:54] make the next one can you say Amen
[1:19:56] whatever you do you do it
[1:20:00] in love to God
[1:20:02] if we are anti-legalist don't believe
[1:20:06] that we don't know that every promise
[1:20:11] is connected to a condition
[1:20:15] that's what brother Brands says every
[1:20:18] promise is connected to a condition that
[1:20:20] we fulfill amen so I I keep that thing
[1:20:25] up but let me just talk about that
[1:20:27] little girl
[1:20:29] forgot her name but it's in the
[1:20:31] generation book and certainly you have
[1:20:33] you were reading about the sister so and
[1:20:36] so I forgot your name
[1:20:40] she said this she were they were friends
[1:20:42] with the Branham family she was friend
[1:20:44] of one of the Branham God Sarah or Becky
[1:20:47] and what happened is she liked to have
[1:20:49] high heels okay
[1:20:52] and you cannot walk unsexy with high
[1:20:55] heels there's no way about that okay if
[1:20:57] I can even I'm looking sexy with it
[1:21:03] [Laughter]
[1:21:06] with a with a little bit of fantasy okay
[1:21:09] [Laughter]
[1:21:12] but you see the love of God
[1:21:14] is never hurting people but he tells the
[1:21:17] truth that's because he's a father
[1:21:20] amen and she says I was standing at some
[1:21:24] kind of a shop with my shoes in our own
[1:21:26] testimonial generation book and brother
[1:21:28] Brandon stopped by his car and he put
[1:21:30] down the window shield he said hey
[1:21:32] um I think Norman or whatever her name
[1:21:34] is hey or the abekia I think Becky uh
[1:21:38] that's too high half of it is enough and
[1:21:41] then brother and said is think about
[1:21:42] your back
[1:21:44] foreign
[1:21:46] so in other words more healthy to have a
[1:21:48] little
[1:21:50] and look what she said
[1:21:52] she said I went home and I threw all
[1:21:54] these shoes away I was so embarrassed
[1:21:56] that the prophet of God had to tell me
[1:21:59] what what thing to wear and not to wear
[1:22:02] that was in her heart
[1:22:04] I mean can we have that same attitude to
[1:22:07] God said Lord I want to please you
[1:22:09] whatever you feel
[1:22:10] amen then the same girl in her testimony
[1:22:16] they had a little photograph photo of
[1:22:19] what they made in the school
[1:22:22] and she was in the same uh class as the
[1:22:26] daughter of brother Brian I think Becky
[1:22:27] or Sarah
[1:22:28] and
[1:22:30] what happened is they made a photo with
[1:22:32] a certain uniform
[1:22:34] and that uniform did not have any any
[1:22:36] sleeves okay and you can say okay here
[1:22:39] comes that German Lutheran he wants to
[1:22:40] talk about sleeves but ah we talk about
[1:22:43] the heart condition okay
[1:22:45] so so so
[1:22:47] that girl said I don't think that it
[1:22:50] will please unto God no I will be not on
[1:22:52] the photo amen and she said there was a
[1:22:55] lot of pressure from the school because
[1:22:56] everybody had to have the same school
[1:22:58] uniform and even brother Brown's
[1:23:00] daughter was part of it she didn't have
[1:23:02] the strength okay um
[1:23:04] what happens is that a couple times
[1:23:07] later she was in a suing contest
[1:23:11] okay and she miraculously made number
[1:23:14] two or number three in the whole state
[1:23:16] of Kentucky
[1:23:18] and a couple of days later brother
[1:23:20] Brennan phoned according to his testing
[1:23:22] a phone to her father and they were just
[1:23:24] talking the father said can you give me
[1:23:27] uh your daughter so and so exactly and
[1:23:30] she said hello brother Brandon and
[1:23:32] brother Brahm said look I heard that you
[1:23:34] were winning or number being number two
[1:23:36] on that soaring contest in Kentucky he
[1:23:39] said yes brother Branham that is just a
[1:23:41] miracle that was wonderful and then
[1:23:42] brother when he said yes
[1:23:44] remember God gave you that price because
[1:23:47] he saw your attitude with the photo
[1:23:53] God has a feeling God as a father don't
[1:23:56] try to clown with him around
[1:23:59] um he's not Grandpa he is a father and
[1:24:02] he helps his children God loves his
[1:24:05] children can you say Amen whatever you
[1:24:08] do God will pay it back to you God will
[1:24:11] be your reward I mean it's in the
[1:24:13] generation books now what happened then
[1:24:16] is this
[1:24:17] God remembers amen and you remember when
[1:24:22] when when and we will see it in the next
[1:24:24] services
[1:24:25] how God placed brother Branham in a body
[1:24:29] that he didn't like
[1:24:31] when we were coming on this Earth
[1:24:35] nobody asked you do you want to be South
[1:24:36] African or kiwi
[1:24:38] nobody asks you
[1:24:40] nobody asked you want to be male or
[1:24:42] female nobody asked you do you want to
[1:24:45] be black or white nobody asks you you
[1:24:47] couldn't even choose your own name
[1:24:51] you have to bear a name that you don't
[1:24:52] like all your world
[1:24:54] you live in a body that you don't like
[1:24:57] you try to make any kind of feeling or
[1:24:59] whatever never never works
[1:25:02] every diet that you try is not working
[1:25:05] amen amen you live in sir you came into
[1:25:09] a family that you never choose
[1:25:11] do you understand one thing
[1:25:13] our our children did not have choice to
[1:25:16] our families we have to treat them right
[1:25:18] we have no right to bring our complexes
[1:25:22] upon the Next Generation we have no
[1:25:24] right for this
[1:25:25] because our children are our brothers
[1:25:27] and sisters in reality
[1:25:29] when you're both with your children
[1:25:31] driving against the wall on the other
[1:25:32] hand side you have the same to you often
[1:25:33] you're at the same age
[1:25:36] our children are our brothers and our
[1:25:37] sisters don't never forget that but we
[1:25:41] came into a situation
[1:25:45] if God would have asked us where would
[1:25:48] we like to be born everybody would like
[1:25:50] to be a Rockefeller
[1:25:53] amen but God placed us I was born in a
[1:25:56] broken family
[1:25:57] rather I saw my father beating my mother
[1:26:00] you never forget this in your life even
[1:26:02] with the Holy Ghost you had these things
[1:26:04] come up in your dreams that's all I
[1:26:06] never choose that
[1:26:07] brother blame told about that story how
[1:26:10] he came from a family where everybody
[1:26:11] was an alcoholics
[1:26:13] amen you have a difficult background and
[1:26:16] you think yet you came wrong on Earth
[1:26:19] and that might be so but it's not so
[1:26:22] because brother blame said this God
[1:26:25] pre-planned your birth
[1:26:27] for many generations
[1:26:32] in the second world war those Germans
[1:26:35] could not kill your grandfather
[1:26:37] because your father was still in him
[1:26:41] and your father could not die because
[1:26:43] you were still in him
[1:26:45] now we were talking about our theophany
[1:26:47] amen and you have to understand your
[1:26:50] theophany looks like you
[1:26:52] brother Brahm said Meda had the same
[1:26:54] black hair there as she had on Earth
[1:26:56] amen
[1:26:58] that means who was there first your
[1:27:00] theophany or your Earth
[1:27:03] and God according to the image that he
[1:27:06] had in his mind he had to bring over
[1:27:08] thousands of years the right parents
[1:27:10] that you're looking exactly exactly
[1:27:14] therefore the natural birth is more
[1:27:17] miraculous than the Virgin births
[1:27:19] amen therefore you can say I'm a maid in
[1:27:23] a wonderful way
[1:27:25] can you say Amen
[1:27:27] therefore God wants you to be like you
[1:27:30] are
[1:27:31] amen so we think that we came wrong on
[1:27:35] this Earth but in the message sings it
[1:27:37] out to be brother Brahm said God
[1:27:39] pre-planned your birth
[1:27:42] for many generations
[1:27:45] amen if God pre-planned my birth he
[1:27:47] pre-planned my death
[1:27:50] he pre-planned my my my my my rapturing
[1:27:55] my Rapture everything is pre-planned in
[1:27:57] God's eyes therefore God could tell the
[1:28:00] minutes when married and Monroe would
[1:28:02] die and told the prophet she will die at
[1:28:04] this in this minutes
[1:28:06] keep one thing in your mind when you
[1:28:08] were when I say you I always say we okay
[1:28:10] but I'm a preacher I'm just talking to
[1:28:12] you but we talk to us okay
[1:28:14] when you were born
[1:28:15] the date of your death was already on
[1:28:19] your on your front
[1:28:23] you haven't how
[1:28:25] it called expired dates
[1:28:29] and when your time is up your time is up
[1:28:32] and I'm not against this definitely so
[1:28:35] I'm living a body I'm happy that I'm
[1:28:36] healthy and I'm eating healthy I do a
[1:28:38] lot of sport I have to because I had
[1:28:40] problems in my back I had to do this but
[1:28:43] one thing is sure you can live healthy
[1:28:46] and you can eat healthy but when your
[1:28:48] time is up you die healthy
[1:28:54] you die healthy because your time is up
[1:28:56] on Earth
[1:28:57] that means Lord let me use my little
[1:29:00] these some little ears on this Earth
[1:29:04] let me be wise
[1:29:05] David said let me be wise to know that I
[1:29:08] will die someday
[1:29:10] don't wait for the last years to serve
[1:29:13] the Lord if you're young if you want to
[1:29:14] serve the Lord do it now because you
[1:29:16] don't have much ears on this Earth
[1:29:18] anyhow
[1:29:19] can you say Amen
[1:29:21] but one thing is sure if we believe that
[1:29:23] we came wrong on this Earth be sure that
[1:29:25] you go that you leave the world in the
[1:29:28] right way
[1:29:29] and this Earth journey is only there to
[1:29:33] mold that character
[1:29:34] Amen to to mold us and to form us into
[1:29:38] the image that he has already of us in
[1:29:41] his in his great minds blessed be the
[1:29:43] name of the Lord
[1:29:45] so you see how brother Branham he calls
[1:29:48] himself
[1:29:50] until the end of his ministry he said
[1:29:53] I'm an erotic type of person
[1:29:57] and he says I'm a melancholic type of
[1:29:59] person many musicians are that we're
[1:30:01] melancholics typical okay nothing wrong
[1:30:04] with it but you have to know who you are
[1:30:07] brother it's a confession that's not
[1:30:10] easy to make
[1:30:12] um
[1:30:13] and I do not do it at home but you are
[1:30:15] far enough
[1:30:18] and I'm hoping that you're cutting the
[1:30:20] streaming
[1:30:22] but but but I was I was for many many
[1:30:25] years I was standing in my own way you
[1:30:27] know as big as I am and I was a soldier
[1:30:31] I just I was in the French Foreign
[1:30:33] Legion I made a lot of things I was
[1:30:35] living in the jungle I was a real how do
[1:30:38] you call it Indiana Jones I did all
[1:30:40] these things before my conversion
[1:30:42] but I found out in my in my mind I'm a
[1:30:45] super sensible person
[1:30:47] I'm not don't demonize me
[1:30:50] but five percent of all people are soup
[1:30:52] are super sensible you can hurt them
[1:30:55] easily
[1:30:56] and I didn't realize it for myself until
[1:30:58] I found it out that's the way I protect
[1:31:00] myself from many many things
[1:31:02] okay
[1:31:03] I cannot change the way how God made me
[1:31:06] but I have to realize that is the
[1:31:08] strength that I have and here is my
[1:31:10] weakness
[1:31:11] and brother Brian said you have to cover
[1:31:13] your weak points with prayer
[1:31:16] everybody has them
[1:31:19] you have maybe said you say I'm another
[1:31:21] type that's fine but we have our weak
[1:31:23] points
[1:31:25] we have to realize that that's me that's
[1:31:27] how my makeup made me and here is my
[1:31:30] weak point so lot
[1:31:32] protect me amen by and I protect myself
[1:31:35] by prayer so brother Brandon was a
[1:31:38] neurotic type of a person
[1:31:42] he says it in the message on the wings
[1:31:44] of a snow white death of 1965 that means
[1:31:47] he was neurotic
[1:31:48] before his conversion with the Holy
[1:31:51] Ghost and after 30 years in the minutes
[1:31:53] is still a neurotic person
[1:31:55] do you understand one is the soul and
[1:31:57] one is the psyche of a man
[1:31:59] and we were Pentecostal we never
[1:32:01] understood that principle we always
[1:32:03] thought here comes the Holy Ghost we are
[1:32:05] a new person and therefore many many
[1:32:06] years we thought we were not born again
[1:32:08] because we're looking on our flesh and
[1:32:10] did not understand our flesh is not
[1:32:12] redeemed
[1:32:13] I mean our flesh is still our face it is
[1:32:15] only made under control by the Holy
[1:32:17] Spirit but it's still a wild animal
[1:32:21] I tell you young girl a boy without the
[1:32:23] Holy Ghost is nothing else than a mammal
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:29] a boy without the Holy Ghost nothing
[1:32:31] else in them he just loves your body
[1:32:34] he's never loving your soul he will love
[1:32:36] your soul when he's a born-again
[1:32:37] Christian then he has a spiritual
[1:32:40] Insight in certain things if not he just
[1:32:43] loves your body and you say Amen
[1:32:46] so here's brother Branham and and he is
[1:32:49] 1963 and he has this kind of spells that
[1:32:53] you always have
[1:32:54] and he goes to hunt and here comes God
[1:32:57] and he says and the voice spoke to me he
[1:32:59] said you remembered your promise I knew
[1:33:02] it was him I said yes Lord and he said
[1:33:04] so do I remember mine I will never leave
[1:33:07] you I will never forsake you
[1:33:09] that burden lifted Christian friends it
[1:33:12] has been back since that was last
[1:33:15] October I have been a different person
[1:33:17] keep your promise to God whatever you
[1:33:20] say to God you believe it separate
[1:33:22] yourself from anything contrary to this
[1:33:24] word God will hear answer prayer let us
[1:33:27] bow heads
[1:33:29] you remember that picture was made
[1:33:33] May 1963 and brother Brahm said I built
[1:33:36] up a complex
[1:33:39] now here is a man who has the baptism of
[1:33:43] the Holy Ghost since he was a young boy
[1:33:47] though he had the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:49] Ghost twice he tried to take his life
[1:33:53] that's what we never understood as
[1:33:54] Pentecostals
[1:33:56] and he still
[1:34:01] and brother brands said this
[1:34:03] he said I was not fit for that work
[1:34:06] and many let me know this
[1:34:10] brother there's two things that destroys
[1:34:12] a person too much Applause and too much
[1:34:15] criticism
[1:34:17] every Minister you and you destroy the
[1:34:19] man you discourage him so far so much by
[1:34:22] too much Applause and too much criticism
[1:34:25] amen so when when when the car stopped
[1:34:30] the voice said look to the West
[1:34:33] amen and he sees Seven Mountains
[1:34:36] and bro and God says to brother Brahm
[1:34:38] that's your life
[1:34:40] your name is written all over these
[1:34:43] Seven Mountains
[1:34:44] now I want to ask you a question when
[1:34:47] did those seven mountains appear on this
[1:34:49] Earth
[1:34:51] 1963
[1:34:53] when God created the Earth
[1:34:56] he knew that the seventh angel is an
[1:34:58] erotic type of a person and he builded
[1:35:01] up these Hills to show that's your life
[1:35:04] that's our father
[1:35:06] knowing the end from the beginning can
[1:35:09] you say Amen
[1:35:11] and God shows to him he said look
[1:35:13] I will not take
[1:35:15] all these Hills and Valleys away from
[1:35:18] you but at the end it will end up in
[1:35:20] eternity
[1:35:21] that's what it always says for for for
[1:35:24] New Year there will come problematic
[1:35:27] situations and there will come easy life
[1:35:30] situations but if you are on the
[1:35:32] Mountaintop
[1:35:33] don't become arrogant
[1:35:36] said oh I don't understand family so and
[1:35:39] so and their children and what happened
[1:35:41] to them and they should pray more and
[1:35:43] believe only believe brother only
[1:35:45] believe that's fine but one thing is
[1:35:47] sure the next Valley is waiting for you
[1:35:50] it's already in the plan of God but if
[1:35:53] you are in the valley don't give up
[1:35:56] don't give up because the next mountain
[1:35:59] is waiting for you
[1:36:01] can you say Amen
[1:36:03] so God says I remember my promise I'm in
[1:36:08] here you see God
[1:36:12] sees the end from the beginning
[1:36:17] remember a prophet sees in the future
[1:36:22] he sees already here is
[1:36:25] The Prophet by the name of Jeremiah
[1:36:29] and Israel is taken to captivity and
[1:36:32] Jeremiah says already look gentlemen it
[1:36:34] is not very long only 70 years and you
[1:36:37] come back
[1:36:38] all right
[1:36:40] he sees in the future he says you have
[1:36:42] to go now into captivity but I see you
[1:36:45] already back in your country
[1:36:49] amen
[1:36:51] do you believe that God sees us today in
[1:36:53] the rapture
[1:36:55] therefore in the seventh seal brother
[1:36:57] Brian said I don't know if you
[1:36:58] understand what I'm telling you but I
[1:37:00] call you now bright
[1:37:02] not church anymore you say I don't know
[1:37:04] if I make it God says but I know he said
[1:37:07] but I don't feel if armor God says I
[1:37:08] know I see you there already
[1:37:11] you get it fear casts love quests all
[1:37:15] all fear you must see yourself like God
[1:37:19] sees you
[1:37:20] and then God can correct you and he can
[1:37:23] mold you he can do whatever you do but
[1:37:25] gospel is good news
[1:37:28] it's always good news every Sunday is
[1:37:31] good news because God sees already the
[1:37:33] victory at the end
[1:37:35] so here is Israel and we see when the
[1:37:38] church was scattered Israel was
[1:37:40] scattered and brother baby said why is
[1:37:42] God so thought and cared so much about
[1:37:45] that little place of Palestine see when
[1:37:48] it's just a little spot but right in
[1:37:51] there is where the temple is set
[1:37:53] that's where the New Jerusalem will
[1:37:55] break up right there Olive Mount of
[1:37:57] other shell cleave part to the right and
[1:37:59] to the left shoe when he pushes up what
[1:38:01] does you have to understand the fight
[1:38:04] around Israel is a spiritual fight
[1:38:08] it's not a geographical fight
[1:38:11] because God said that place is for
[1:38:14] Israel because here the temple will
[1:38:17] stand
[1:38:19] and when brother blame said why is God
[1:38:21] so much cared about that little place in
[1:38:24] Palestine
[1:38:25] huh then I can say why is God so much
[1:38:28] cared about that little place in your
[1:38:29] heart
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:32] because the bride is New Jerusalem
[1:38:38] Jerusalem will visit Jerusalem if you
[1:38:41] take El Al Uno El Al but we will see it
[1:38:44] anyhow one day the bride is the New
[1:38:47] Jerusalem
[1:38:49] Abraham was searching for a city
[1:38:52] and he thought just geographically is it
[1:38:55] into some or is it in Jeffersonville but
[1:38:59] brother Brahma said that city is now
[1:39:01] right hanging above us
[1:39:03] your own theophany
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:06] what a time that we live what a
[1:39:08] revelation of the sons of God can you
[1:39:11] say Amen
[1:39:12] but look at this
[1:39:14] huh
[1:39:15] so Israel was completely destroyed the
[1:39:18] Temple mount everything so even Theodore
[1:39:22] herzl thought by himself
[1:39:25] we search a home for the Jews it does
[1:39:28] not have to be Palestine it could be
[1:39:31] they thought Uganda or Argentina
[1:39:34] but God says I remember that there
[1:39:38] should be there
[1:39:41] you say Amen
[1:39:44] so what happens
[1:39:47] never ever if a civilization was
[1:39:50] destroyed it never came back
[1:39:53] you take the meters the Persians
[1:39:57] the the Aztecs the Incas these Chinese
[1:40:01] uh uh
[1:40:03] the the meters the Persians uh the
[1:40:07] Assyrians ever civilization once was
[1:40:10] destroyed it never came back only one
[1:40:14] people and that's Israel
[1:40:17] after two thousand years exactly in the
[1:40:20] same spots
[1:40:22] and brother brand because and brother
[1:40:24] Brahm says this and I hope I'm not
[1:40:25] discouraging someone but please don't
[1:40:28] search for a Pentecostal Revival in this
[1:40:31] message because brother Graham said if
[1:40:33] if a Revival ever dies it never comes
[1:40:36] back
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:38] but the words in the beginning brought
[1:40:41] the words to the end
[1:40:43] can you say Amen
[1:40:45] it was God leading them and now I put on
[1:40:48] this is now pure Marcus interpretation
[1:40:52] Marcus interpreter you can reject it but
[1:40:55] still love me okay
[1:40:58] but there is a quote and many people
[1:41:00] struggle about Revelation 10 because
[1:41:01] brother Brian said he goes directly to
[1:41:04] Israel when that angel comes down of
[1:41:06] Revelation 10. now that happened 1963
[1:41:09] what was the next great thing that
[1:41:12] happened that was The Six Day War in
[1:41:15] Israel 1967.
[1:41:18] and people said that victory was
[1:41:21] miraculously
[1:41:23] it was not the arms and look what it
[1:41:26] does the seventh seal is complete
[1:41:29] silence
[1:41:31] but complete silence doesn't mean that
[1:41:33] everybody is sleeping
[1:41:35] complete silence you do something that
[1:41:37] the enemy doesn't be aware of
[1:41:40] but there's great activity in great in
[1:41:42] in great silence you know how the sixth
[1:41:45] day well the sixth day was one
[1:41:48] on one morning the whole Air Force of
[1:41:50] the of of Israel went and they were
[1:41:53] flying below the radar
[1:41:55] and they could not be detected
[1:41:57] and in between of one hour 45 minutes
[1:42:01] the whole Egyptian Air Force was
[1:42:03] destroyed
[1:42:05] amen amen miraculously I mean not and
[1:42:10] and the thing was this
[1:42:12] the the general at that time was Moshe
[1:42:16] Dayan
[1:42:17] amen and you have to understand natural
[1:42:20] types to spiritual amen as the
[1:42:24] Pentecostal Church got their leader with
[1:42:27] one eye by the name of Seymour I'm an
[1:42:30] Israel got their Leader by Moshi Daya
[1:42:33] the man with one eye bringing these
[1:42:36] people back to the temple mounts
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:39] and Moshe Dayan said this when we are
[1:42:42] destroying our enemy not one time we
[1:42:46] will have any call between the airplanes
[1:42:49] total silence
[1:42:51] until the last plane is destroyed
[1:42:55] amen
[1:42:56] so there was total silence Seven Seals
[1:42:59] but total silence does not mean God is
[1:43:02] sleeping
[1:43:04] God does great things
[1:43:07] but he doesn't explain it to everyone
[1:43:10] because this is the time of Romeo and
[1:43:13] Juliet and when you take the bride you
[1:43:15] will not tell everybody that you're now
[1:43:17] at her window and taking her home
[1:43:21] and you would surely not tell the
[1:43:22] parents
[1:43:23] I
[1:43:25] you get it it's a tremendous time right
[1:43:28] now but it's different than we thought
[1:43:30] it before
[1:43:32] God does not make any show can you say
[1:43:35] Amen
[1:43:36] so what a Time amen hallelujah do you
[1:43:40] love the Lord
[1:43:41] can I continue now with a little
[1:43:43] teaching
[1:43:44] is that fine for you
[1:43:46] I mean I'm I'm look I mean here I want
[1:43:50] to prove
[1:43:52] by the Bible
[1:43:53] why God will not forget he cannot forget
[1:43:57] amen now let me explain you with history
[1:44:01] just some minutes
[1:44:02] this is Constantine
[1:44:04] and Constantine was one of the rulers in
[1:44:08] Rome
[1:44:09] at that time Rome had an Eastern part in
[1:44:13] the western parts
[1:44:15] remember this morning we were talking
[1:44:17] about the early church
[1:44:19] and we are now in the time where Judaism
[1:44:22] is now going down
[1:44:26] I mean and Christianity from a little
[1:44:28] sick the first Christians they were
[1:44:30] thought were Jew they thought they were
[1:44:31] Jews with the Holy Spirit but now
[1:44:34] Christianity comes into a state religion
[1:44:37] because God has in mind seven Church
[1:44:39] ages hmm
[1:44:41] we have now two rooms East Rome and West
[1:44:45] Rome
[1:44:47] and in these little Easter and Western
[1:44:50] we have two schools of thoughts
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:56] I don't know exactly which one we have
[1:44:58] the school of Alexandria and we have the
[1:45:00] school of another school amen
[1:45:04] one says Jesus was divine
[1:45:09] and one says Jesus was just an adopted
[1:45:13] man he was a human being he was a man
[1:45:16] and both have quotes of the Bible one
[1:45:20] school said he said at the cross why did
[1:45:23] you forsake me so he could not be God it
[1:45:25] must have been a man
[1:45:27] the other school that the other the
[1:45:29] other school said yes but Jesus said if
[1:45:31] you see me you see the father
[1:45:33] he's God
[1:45:36] and we find out how brother Brian brings
[1:45:39] it together he was 100 God fully God and
[1:45:41] was fully men definitely so
[1:45:43] but we have different schools of
[1:45:46] thoughts very prominent in the first
[1:45:49] three centuries arianism and the other
[1:45:54] school
[1:45:56] so that's not a problem in itself but
[1:45:59] now God wants to continue with
[1:46:01] Christianity
[1:46:02] and he brings this man Constantine and
[1:46:06] he is now fighting against the next
[1:46:08] Caesar in Rome
[1:46:11] now the night before he has his fights
[1:46:14] in Rome he sees a sign
[1:46:18] or he hears a voice it says in Hawk seek
[1:46:21] no vinces that means you will win in
[1:46:24] under this sign
[1:46:26] Constantine is not a Believer he doesn't
[1:46:29] understand that religion but he believes
[1:46:31] the dream that he has for he has that
[1:46:33] the vision that he saw during the day
[1:46:35] and he puts on the shields of his
[1:46:39] Fighters
[1:46:40] a Christian cross
[1:46:43] and
[1:46:44] he wins the battle at the bridge of
[1:46:47] mileage amen
[1:46:49] he now becomes
[1:46:54] the Emperor of a whole room
[1:46:57] so
[1:46:58] he is not a Believer he is not a
[1:47:01] Christian
[1:47:02] but he's a businessman
[1:47:04] amen he he feels now
[1:47:07] that the god of the Christians has more
[1:47:11] power than the God of all the rest so
[1:47:13] let us all become Christians
[1:47:16] okay
[1:47:19] and what he does he says I'm now the
[1:47:21] highest priest pontifex Maximus what the
[1:47:24] pope became later
[1:47:26] so he says to all of his people
[1:47:29] in the 4th century
[1:47:31] Christianity now becomes State religion
[1:47:34] now Christianity from a little Jewish
[1:47:37] sect
[1:47:38] overnight becomes now a big religion for
[1:47:41] the whole Roman Empire and at the same
[1:47:44] time Judah is now
[1:47:46] declines more and more definitely so hmm
[1:47:50] but
[1:47:51] he's now promoting his new religion
[1:47:56] he says we have a great God and his name
[1:47:59] is Christ and he's so powerful that I
[1:48:02] had a vision I saw the cross and he is
[1:48:04] now the god of our room
[1:48:07] so please teach that Doctrine
[1:48:10] to all of our Heathen worshipers because
[1:48:13] this God is not a god beside the rest
[1:48:16] everybody is a Christian that was that
[1:48:19] was Constantine but one thing is sure
[1:48:22] here you have two fundamental difficult
[1:48:26] different
[1:48:28] schools of thoughts fundamentally
[1:48:31] different
[1:48:33] and the Heathen priest would have said
[1:48:35] hey we would love to receive
[1:48:38] Christian doctrine but these Christians
[1:48:40] don't know what they believe themselves
[1:48:43] because one says this and the other one
[1:48:45] says this let them first find out what
[1:48:47] they believe
[1:48:48] that was the beginning of the nicer
[1:48:51] Council of Rome
[1:48:54] that is the reason because he said if we
[1:48:56] have a state religion we need one Faith
[1:48:58] one belief
[1:49:00] because if they don't know what they
[1:49:02] believe I will never convince my my my
[1:49:04] my my worshipers so Constantine came to
[1:49:09] nicaea and he says look I'm not
[1:49:11] interested in your religion you find out
[1:49:14] whatever you want
[1:49:15] at the end I want to have
[1:49:18] one solution one Doctrine and brother
[1:49:21] blame said the true Christian should
[1:49:22] have not gone there
[1:49:25] young people
[1:49:27] please understand so there are certain
[1:49:29] things in our life where God says you
[1:49:31] should not even go there
[1:49:33] amen no it's no need for you to go there
[1:49:35] a young brother wants him to spoke with
[1:49:38] me
[1:49:39] um it goes too far
[1:49:42] so what happens
[1:49:44] they now sorted out
[1:49:47] and the question is this
[1:49:50] it seems to be difficult but I make it
[1:49:52] very very easy
[1:49:54] if Jesus is divine he's part of God then
[1:49:59] he is Godly
[1:50:00] if he is just a man who was now adopted
[1:50:03] and he is just human
[1:50:05] exactly
[1:50:07] so they find out Jesus is divine he is
[1:50:11] God as the father is God
[1:50:14] that means that was the beginning of the
[1:50:17] Trinity Doctrine
[1:50:18] because later they found off is Jesus if
[1:50:21] God and the father is God and the son is
[1:50:23] God then the Holy Spirit must be God too
[1:50:25] the treaty Doctrine is more tricky than
[1:50:27] sometimes we think because it makes more
[1:50:29] sense than a false one one God Doctrine
[1:50:35] that was the question is now Jesus
[1:50:38] same
[1:50:40] person in Greek you say homo uzios
[1:50:44] r-e-c-a creation of Gods
[1:50:48] I mean from now on you put on your
[1:50:50] spiritual jacket because I speak about
[1:50:52] the bride
[1:50:54] there is a difference
[1:50:57] between a creation and a birth
[1:51:02] I can create many things
[1:51:07] but I only burst one daughter
[1:51:13] I can create many things but it's just
[1:51:15] an object but the thing that I burst
[1:51:18] part of me is in her
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:25] foreign
[1:51:29] he said so he first was got Jehovah and
[1:51:32] out of him let's just picture now as a
[1:51:34] little drama so you can get it let's see
[1:51:36] coming out of space where there was
[1:51:38] nothing let's make it a little white
[1:51:40] light like a Mystic light like a Halo
[1:51:43] and that was the logos that went out of
[1:51:46] God in the beginning that means that
[1:51:48] logos was part of God
[1:51:52] that was the son of God that came out of
[1:51:54] the bosom of the Father the logos was
[1:51:57] part of God
[1:52:00] that was what was in the beginning was
[1:52:02] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:52:04] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:52:05] flesh and dweld Among Us in the
[1:52:07] beginning was God and then out of God
[1:52:09] came the logos a part of God that went
[1:52:13] out of God
[1:52:15] so God didn't create the logos
[1:52:19] but the logos was part of God that come
[1:52:21] out of him
[1:52:23] and God looked to his son
[1:52:26] and his son looked to his father
[1:52:28] amen
[1:52:30] amen same person
[1:52:34] no two Gods no no no two godheads in the
[1:52:37] three in in there's no Trinity there's
[1:52:39] no same person it's like you take a
[1:52:43] spoon of water out of the ocean you have
[1:52:45] ocean in your in your teaspoon
[1:52:47] same substance
[1:52:49] only another dispensation
[1:52:51] the Sun comes out
[1:52:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:52:58] therefore
[1:53:00] and you put on your spiritual jacket
[1:53:03] brother Graham said the first thing and
[1:53:05] here we have brother brother uh brother
[1:53:08] Murray's presentation you remember
[1:53:10] brother Murray brother Tony when brother
[1:53:12] Bremen said the first thing that God
[1:53:14] created was angels
[1:53:16] she quote brother Brennan
[1:53:18] amen and he said here's a comp here's
[1:53:22] the contradiction it's not contradiction
[1:53:23] because the logos was not created
[1:53:28] the logos was burst
[1:53:31] the logos was part of God the Ancients
[1:53:33] were not part of God they were created
[1:53:35] like like planets
[1:53:37] you see the difference between something
[1:53:39] that was versed if if I giving birth to
[1:53:42] my own daughter you understand through
[1:53:44] my wife
[1:53:45] but in my in my daughter it's part of my
[1:53:48] DNA
[1:53:49] Part of Me Myself is in the next person
[1:53:52] but I can create a puppet or whatever
[1:53:55] but that's just creation God created
[1:53:57] angels but he burst a logos
[1:54:02] it's a big difference
[1:54:03] big difference
[1:54:05] the Eternal thought and you put on your
[1:54:08] spiritual decade
[1:54:10] the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[1:54:12] you are the thoughts of God eternal
[1:54:16] if you can see this you will see many
[1:54:19] things
[1:54:20] oh if you see this you can see many
[1:54:24] things you don't see it you don't see
[1:54:25] much in the message
[1:54:28] you just you just send see God send the
[1:54:30] prophet but if you can see this
[1:54:33] you can find your origin
[1:54:35] and your origin will be your future
[1:54:38] brother Graham said if you can see this
[1:54:40] you will see many things God is
[1:54:42] unchangeable both in essence and
[1:54:43] behavior and so on and he is omniscient
[1:54:46] he has never had a new thought about
[1:54:47] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:54:50] always had and always will have and
[1:54:52] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:54:54] he is God thus the thoughts of God are
[1:54:58] Eternal they are real
[1:55:00] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:55:03] blueprint he has drawn up which one day
[1:55:05] will be translated into substance and
[1:55:08] form but they are already real and
[1:55:11] eternal and part of God
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:18] you believe the prophet can you say Amen
[1:55:22] you understand why God came to set the
[1:55:24] prophet in our time
[1:55:26] none of the prophets ever could see
[1:55:29] Farah than William Branham
[1:55:31] Moses could just say in the beginning he
[1:55:34] could see the creation
[1:55:36] John could say in the beginning God
[1:55:39] John could see the logos in the
[1:55:41] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:55:42] with God he could see that moment but
[1:55:45] brother Brian could even see right
[1:55:46] before the beginning
[1:55:48] nobody could look farther than him
[1:55:52] and we needed to understand that is our
[1:55:55] origin
[1:55:56] amen so the thoughts of God is not like
[1:56:01] we are thinking
[1:56:02] thoughts of God are part of God
[1:56:06] Eternal already just to be here to
[1:56:08] become manifested
[1:56:10] nobody can preach you into the family of
[1:56:12] God and nobody preaches you out of it
[1:56:15] can you say Amen
[1:56:17] you are born on this Earth Jesus said
[1:56:19] I'm born for a purpose I have to become
[1:56:22] a light for for the world you can say
[1:56:25] the bride can say I'm born for a purpose
[1:56:29] to find my father
[1:56:31] to find my mother
[1:56:34] to fight my eternal destination and to
[1:56:36] become a further part of God's
[1:56:39] revelation for my time my purpose in
[1:56:41] life is not to make money
[1:56:43] my purpose not to build a house
[1:56:46] my purpose is to come home to become
[1:56:49] redeemed to come back in the family from
[1:56:51] where I came from
[1:56:55] do you see the difference between the
[1:56:56] church and the bride
[1:56:58] let the rest find Salvation whosoever
[1:57:01] come let him come but only the the
[1:57:04] family of God was in the mind of God
[1:57:07] now I stress you that is my question
[1:57:11] are you created no I was birthed
[1:57:18] when in the beginning when the logos
[1:57:20] came out of God why this
[1:57:24] can you say Amen
[1:57:25] that is now the part not for the
[1:57:27] teenagers that is now that is not among
[1:57:28] ministers if you don't say Amen direct
[1:57:30] number that is that is real ministering
[1:57:32] but I spoke the first part was for you
[1:57:34] okay
[1:57:36] amen but but but brother Brands showed
[1:57:39] in the Bible says
[1:57:40] he says Eve was in Adam
[1:57:43] we know this
[1:57:45] and I said what I said two days ago a
[1:57:48] sister said to me when Eve and God took
[1:57:51] Eve out of Adam he took the best part
[1:57:53] out of the man I said okay I disagree
[1:57:56] with that but
[1:57:58] but she was yeah took some seconds there
[1:58:02] oh you didn't dare to laugh because he
[1:58:05] was sitting beside you
[1:58:06] [Laughter]
[1:58:11] but do you realize
[1:58:13] the woman never got a name she was just
[1:58:15] woman when God came in the Garden of
[1:58:17] Eden called Adam two people came
[1:58:21] because they were both called Adam
[1:58:24] amen he called Adam two people came when
[1:58:27] God speaks about Christ he speaks about
[1:58:29] the bride the same time
[1:58:32] [Applause]
[1:58:33] nobody will know only Christ in the
[1:58:35] bright so if Christ knows I will know
[1:58:36] too
[1:58:37] because I'm part of him
[1:58:39] so brother Brahm even said he said we
[1:58:42] were so much in him that we prayed for
[1:58:44] our own sins at the cross quote brother
[1:58:46] Branham
[1:58:48] so if we were in Christ
[1:58:52] then we were in Melchizedek because
[1:58:54] Melchizedek was Christ before
[1:58:56] in what form Ever God knows
[1:58:59] if we were in Melchizedek
[1:59:02] we were in the pillar of Fire
[1:59:04] the logos that came out of God
[1:59:07] and when we were in the logos we were in
[1:59:09] God right in the beginning
[1:59:11] we come from God and we go back to God
[1:59:14] nobody will step us
[1:59:16] nobody because we are predestinated
[1:59:19] brother we have a Heavenly navigation
[1:59:21] system in our soul that takes us home
[1:59:25] sometimes we make a lot of nonsense in
[1:59:27] our life but the navigation system says
[1:59:29] new calculation
[1:59:32] new calculation
[1:59:34] goal but the end goal is already
[1:59:37] programmed by God
[1:59:41] in what form Ever I will not enter into
[1:59:44] this because then I'm I'm I'm I'm going
[1:59:46] I'm just going to see how God remember
[1:59:47] we can speak about the angels we are not
[1:59:48] do okay
[1:59:49] but you put on your spiritual jacket
[1:59:51] okay
[1:59:52] in what form ever
[1:59:54] what forever
[1:59:56] brother Graham said quote brother Ben
[1:59:58] God in the beginning was alone with his
[2:00:01] thoughts
[2:00:02] have you ever had said
[2:00:04] in other words he wasn't alone
[2:00:07] in other words he wasn't alone he was
[2:00:10] alone with his thoughts
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:14] it doesn't mean God was thinking
[2:00:17] he was alone with his thoughts
[2:00:20] what is his thought it's his family
[2:00:22] [Applause]
[2:00:26] nobody can preach you in brother no no
[2:00:29] wonder this message is to reach for
[2:00:31] denominations they cannot handle that
[2:00:33] that means you make yourself God
[2:00:37] I'm I'm just Marcus from Germany but
[2:00:42] deep in my heart
[2:00:44] amen I'm a new creation man
[2:00:46] therefore you don't become an eternal
[2:00:49] being by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:51] you have already part of God in your
[2:00:53] soul
[2:00:54] therefore the Holy Ghost is it's part
[2:00:57] you must receive it sooner or later
[2:00:58] because God ordained you together
[2:01:02] can you say Amen
[2:01:05] now you behave like your father so you
[2:01:07] understand a real bride cannot have
[2:01:10] complexes
[2:01:12] if we have these things because we do
[2:01:14] not know who we are
[2:01:15] but God doesn't take time it does take
[2:01:18] time you know to bring it as a slope and
[2:01:21] it's one thing
[2:01:22] but to soak that thing so deep into your
[2:01:26] heart you say that's me
[2:01:28] you come for the first time into a
[2:01:30] village the message of the hour
[2:01:32] and you have never seen a mirror on the
[2:01:34] denominational nonsense and here you go
[2:01:37] and you say hey
[2:01:39] hey
[2:01:40] hey
[2:01:42] he said Mama that's me
[2:01:45] that's what the message did with us
[2:01:48] we came into the message
[2:01:50] I'm happy to be safe and to be safe and
[2:01:52] then we were reading you would say hey
[2:01:54] that sounds familiar
[2:01:56] that's what I said and don't know in
[2:01:58] what form but we believe all the
[2:02:01] Miracles in the ministry of brother
[2:02:02] Branham because in what form Ever we
[2:02:05] were there when the creation was made
[2:02:07] and we remember somehow that was exactly
[2:02:10] so
[2:02:11] therefore brother Brian said God
[2:02:13] blackened out our minds
[2:02:16] so that we forget
[2:02:18] therefore you can have spiritual amnesia
[2:02:23] you can only have spiritual Amnesia if
[2:02:25] you once you knew who you were
[2:02:28] if not you can't have amnesia
[2:02:30] I mean but God just closed our eyes we
[2:02:34] came onto this world and he would say
[2:02:36] I'm so happy to be a kiwi
[2:02:38] and God says that is just your natural
[2:02:41] birth but deep inside of you is a
[2:02:44] mystery
[2:02:45] which is revealed at the end time
[2:02:48] can you say Amen
[2:02:51] therefore
[2:02:55] therefore always said
[2:02:57] Esther the Queen of Heaven Esther who
[2:03:01] who buried death that great uh
[2:03:06] King by the name of of
[2:03:09] forgot the name but he's there amen who
[2:03:12] what was the name of
[2:03:14] ahas for us
[2:03:16] Esther had two names
[2:03:18] one was her Earth's name was Esther
[2:03:20] means star but your true name was
[2:03:22] Hadassah
[2:03:24] brother you have two names one is on
[2:03:27] your passport
[2:03:29] but you have another name deep and soon
[2:03:32] your personality is not key we are South
[2:03:35] African you are a Christian deep in your
[2:03:38] hearts a son and a daughter of God
[2:03:41] can you say amen and God takes away that
[2:03:44] Amnesia from us
[2:03:46] therefore Esther had no father and she
[2:03:51] had no mother
[2:03:52] amen that reminds us to Melchizedek who
[2:03:55] had no father and he had no mother
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:03:59] we are living here for 70 years on this
[2:04:02] Earth but in US is a mystery
[2:04:04] it's a seed of God coming from eternity
[2:04:07] bringing us back from where we come from
[2:04:11] this is not Harry Potter this is the
[2:04:13] truth
[2:04:14] can you say Amen
[2:04:16] only the messenger could bring these
[2:04:19] things to us because it was not in
[2:04:21] reformers age it was not the time but
[2:04:23] this is the time of the Capstone this is
[2:04:25] the time as I always says amen I'm here
[2:04:30] you have loudest here now if you see my
[2:04:32] passport you just see Marcus
[2:04:35] and brother Brian said he is loud he's
[2:04:37] here speaking in tongues this is
[2:04:39] Pentecostal age 1906 then the eyes God
[2:04:43] sent the prophets I mean William Branham
[2:04:45] is this the end program said no the
[2:04:47] intelligence comes
[2:04:49] brother Ram says there's no sound when
[2:04:51] the intelligent comes but it's there
[2:04:54] you recognize Who You Are
[2:04:56] you unless you find your position
[2:04:58] um you know one thing
[2:05:00] if I'm getting that job or losing that
[2:05:02] job if my brother betrays me or not I'm
[2:05:05] the inherited my inheritance is eternal
[2:05:07] anyhow
[2:05:09] I mean somebody's betraying you somebody
[2:05:11] steals your position in the church
[2:05:12] somebody steals this somebody somebody
[2:05:14] betrays you with car whatever you can
[2:05:17] just say okay in this whole world is my
[2:05:19] inheritance anyhow
[2:05:21] I remember one time years ago I came to
[2:05:23] the US and and and I came in the plane
[2:05:27] and Air Force One was Mr Obama came so
[2:05:30] we had to stop and he came with his
[2:05:32] plane Air Force One in in Dallas not
[2:05:34] Dallas in Atlanta
[2:05:36] so I was winking
[2:05:38] but he didn't Wing back
[2:05:41] and I thought by myself Mr obana your
[2:05:44] time is limited but my time will come
[2:05:49] do you understand on this Earth we're
[2:05:51] doing simply I'm a janitor at home a
[2:05:54] janitor simple things but at the same
[2:05:57] time God is molding our character
[2:05:59] because on the other side our ministry
[2:06:02] starts
[2:06:03] our ministry is not to be the man of the
[2:06:05] hour our ministry is to reign in the
[2:06:07] Millennium together with Christ
[2:06:09] and God is just changing our exploding
[2:06:12] our character because character might
[2:06:15] without character is satanic can you say
[2:06:18] Amen
[2:06:19] amen
[2:06:20] and continue amen
[2:06:23] God
[2:06:25] cannot forget you
[2:06:27] did someone of you ever felt that God
[2:06:30] forgot you somehow or he is a little bit
[2:06:33] too late have you ever felt like this
[2:06:35] I'm the only one okay fine some others
[2:06:38] somehow
[2:06:40] God did you did you just Overlook me
[2:06:43] but he cannot Overlook me
[2:06:45] take Heat said Jesus in Matthew that you
[2:06:49] despise none of these little ones for I
[2:06:51] say unto you that in heaven their Angels
[2:06:54] do always behold the face of My Father
[2:06:57] which is in heaven and so on and so on
[2:07:00] and so on
[2:07:02] amen I know what you know what now comes
[2:07:05] amen I'm questions and answers please
[2:07:07] Brothers explain about Matthew chapter
[2:07:10] 18 verse 10. that you despise not one of
[2:07:14] these little ones for I say unto you
[2:07:16] that in heaven their Angels do always
[2:07:19] behold the face of My Father which is in
[2:07:22] heaven what is the answer turn to
[2:07:25] Corinthians 5 if this Earthly Tabernacle
[2:07:29] is dissolved you know what it is if this
[2:07:31] earthy Tabernacle is his hope we have
[2:07:33] already one waiting all right what is
[2:07:35] the brother braam said that's our
[2:07:37] theophany
[2:07:39] every funeral we are reading this for a
[2:07:43] funeral why shouldn't we read this for
[2:07:45] life
[2:07:46] I mean why should we wait for our
[2:07:48] funeral to read this and to say this is
[2:07:51] my inheritance this is my true being
[2:07:53] amen that is the answer and he continues
[2:07:55] he said and now notice because their
[2:07:58] Angels always behold my face which is in
[2:08:02] heaven you see in other words they're
[2:08:05] Angels they're Messengers their bodies
[2:08:08] Angelic bodies that they will go to if
[2:08:11] they die are always before my father's
[2:08:13] face in heaven
[2:08:17] that means my angel is my theophany
[2:08:21] game
[2:08:23] Hallelujah in other words this part of
[2:08:26] me is always beholding gods
[2:08:29] in what form Ever it's the body
[2:08:32] in which I will enter when I die
[2:08:37] amen amen therefore there's no bad news
[2:08:40] for Christmas Even if you have cancer if
[2:08:42] I have cancer we can say death where's
[2:08:44] your sting
[2:08:46] honestly where's your sting it is
[2:08:49] sometimes difficult to die but death for
[2:08:52] a Christian is nothing
[2:08:53] Billy Graham even said if I die don't
[2:08:57] don't cry don't mourn I just changed my
[2:09:00] address
[2:09:01] that's what he said what can we say as
[2:09:04] the bride
[2:09:06] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:09:07] therefore young people it matters to
[2:09:09] serve the Lord
[2:09:11] amen hallelujah
[2:09:13] their Angels behold their faith and now
[2:09:15] you understand one thing
[2:09:17] I mean when Jesus when he had to bypass
[2:09:20] and he had to come to Samaria
[2:09:23] there was a little woman
[2:09:25] amen
[2:09:26] and brother Brandon said this and you
[2:09:28] put on your spiritual jacket okay who
[2:09:30] has a jacket with you somehow without
[2:09:32] the boys you put on your jacket okay
[2:09:33] spiritually okay
[2:09:36] amen
[2:09:38] brother the Bible says he had to come
[2:09:40] through Samaria
[2:09:43] and brother Ben explains because that
[2:09:45] woman had a representation
[2:09:47] of the thoughts of God
[2:09:50] whatever it was for me it was her
[2:09:52] theophany but this is Marcus I don't
[2:09:53] have a quote for if you have a quote let
[2:09:55] me know but this is my interpretation
[2:09:57] she had representation of the thoughts
[2:09:59] of God but what does it mean
[2:10:01] she did not get representation because
[2:10:04] Jesus passed by
[2:10:06] Jesus had to pass by because she had
[2:10:09] representation
[2:10:12] the new birth doesn't give us a
[2:10:13] theophany
[2:10:15] we had the theophany when we were born
[2:10:16] and we must be born again to fit into
[2:10:18] the ethiopathy God makes sure that we
[2:10:21] make it
[2:10:23] can you say Amen
[2:10:25] and the bride will not be lazy okay I
[2:10:27] can drink I can smoke nobody preaches
[2:10:29] that but you cannot force yourself into
[2:10:32] yourself and you have it you are born
[2:10:33] with it that's the greatest gift that
[2:10:35] God could give you
[2:10:37] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:10:39] so what happens
[2:10:41] is that the name of the Lord is just so
[2:10:45] wonderful
[2:10:47] that there is something of you whatever
[2:10:50] you want to call it
[2:10:52] something of you some part of you
[2:10:56] you're positive let me call it like this
[2:11:00] stands in the presence of God and
[2:11:02] reminds him
[2:11:03] God cannot forget you
[2:11:06] because your angel is always beholding
[2:11:09] and you remember that brother Graham
[2:11:11] said only the elect have angels
[2:11:15] amen
[2:11:17] so you're not alone
[2:11:19] so brother Brennan was not the messenger
[2:11:21] who invented tea of theophonies
[2:11:25] he did not invent them but he was a
[2:11:27] prophet who could see in the other
[2:11:28] dimension and he would say by glorified
[2:11:31] body is now standing right here on their
[2:11:33] platform charging me like a battery
[2:11:35] nobody else could say this
[2:11:38] amen
[2:11:40] so if you walk you're never alone
[2:11:47] somebody who has no Revelation who is
[2:11:49] who is in hospital
[2:11:51] brother Marcus uh I'm sick and nobody
[2:11:55] nobody nobody visited me
[2:11:58] even the pastor I mean I don't know what
[2:12:00] he's paid for really
[2:12:04] no nobody these these people nobody
[2:12:07] think No Love in the church no
[2:12:09] understanding brother that's the talk of
[2:12:11] an unbeliever
[2:12:12] or somebody who did not really
[2:12:15] understand message Doctrine
[2:12:17] because somebody who believes he said
[2:12:19] hey I was not alone
[2:12:21] because my theophany was very near to me
[2:12:24] amen amen I've heard from my theophany
[2:12:28] amen she's part of me even if the church
[2:12:31] forgot me but God cannot forget me
[2:12:33] because my angel just is in his presence
[2:12:36] all the time can you say Amen
[2:12:39] so that takes
[2:12:42] us away from social Christianity
[2:12:47] it takes us away from slogans
[2:12:50] Jesus loves you I think I think he cares
[2:12:53] for you and he loves you you know one
[2:12:55] thing he must care for me he will care
[2:12:57] for me because part of me is right there
[2:13:00] waiting for me just to enter
[2:13:03] I'm just a negative but the real
[2:13:05] positive is already on the other sides
[2:13:07] that's for me that it's pure Marcus that
[2:13:10] is what brother Brahman said cricket and
[2:13:12] power brought me behind the curtain of
[2:13:14] time and I saw all of you there
[2:13:16] that must be that part that he must have
[2:13:18] seen blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:13:20] amen now let's see this and continue I'm
[2:13:22] coming to the end
[2:13:24] that is a point
[2:13:26] while a true Christian has wings to fly
[2:13:31] away from all problems
[2:13:34] amen that is a picture it's a little
[2:13:36] film that was made by uh uh uh General
[2:13:41] Geographics or whatever is the name is
[2:13:45] amen National Geographics
[2:13:48] it's a little film and this is one of
[2:13:50] the pictures out of that little film
[2:13:52] and it shows a crow
[2:13:55] which is on the back of that eagle
[2:13:58] and what happens is this it's an
[2:14:01] unbeliever who made that little film in
[2:14:03] that photo series and he makes a little
[2:14:05] text about it
[2:14:07] and he explains this when that Crow was
[2:14:10] on the back of that eagle the crow was
[2:14:12] attacking the eagle the head of the
[2:14:14] eagle
[2:14:15] and the eagle was not fighting back the
[2:14:17] eagle was just just flying like this in
[2:14:20] the air
[2:14:21] amen but after some time that eagle just
[2:14:25] went up
[2:14:27] and the eagle knew one thing hey
[2:14:30] comrades
[2:14:32] if you don't pay attention you would you
[2:14:34] would you will be bursting into a
[2:14:36] thousand pieces because I will now go up
[2:14:39] into an altitude where you cannot follow
[2:14:42] you better leave me here because
[2:14:46] an unbeliever wrote that text the eagle
[2:14:48] was not fighting back but after some
[2:14:50] time the eagle was just going up
[2:14:52] and the crow behind him
[2:14:57] the eagle could go higher than any demon
[2:15:00] can go
[2:15:01] thank you
[2:15:03] do you see that you have a potential
[2:15:05] when it comes very deep
[2:15:07] maybe in 2023 becomes a difficult year
[2:15:11] maybe you have a lot of sicknesses
[2:15:13] maybe a lot of financial problems maybe
[2:15:15] a lot of problems with your children but
[2:15:17] there is something in you that can go
[2:15:20] higher into another Realm brother
[2:15:23] therefore we come into the house of God
[2:15:25] to rise up and go higher in certain
[2:15:27] things
[2:15:28] can you say Amen
[2:15:31] that is the nature of an eagle
[2:15:34] thank you Jesus
[2:15:36] what a privilege that we have God
[2:15:39] remembers
[2:15:41] let me finish that little Story I mean
[2:15:43] can you say Amen so far
[2:15:46] what a difference between a creation
[2:15:48] therefore brother Graham said the first
[2:15:50] thing that God created were angels and
[2:15:52] he was right
[2:15:54] and then he said the first thing that
[2:15:55] came out of God was the logos and his
[2:15:58] right too because the Locust was not
[2:15:59] created the logos was birthed out of him
[2:16:02] it's a difference amen and we were right
[2:16:05] in that amen because all the theophonies
[2:16:08] were in that logos
[2:16:10] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:16:12] so we see that the shunamite woman
[2:16:15] her boy
[2:16:21] and
[2:16:23] that woman was a believer
[2:16:26] because when the boy died
[2:16:30] she laid that boy exactly in the same
[2:16:34] room that she prepared
[2:16:38] for the prophet and its message
[2:16:43] brother bran said it like this when
[2:16:45] Elisha entered into the house of the
[2:16:47] Widow of serpter
[2:16:49] he said he was not a prophet who was
[2:16:51] invited it was God that he invited she
[2:16:54] invited to him
[2:16:55] and she laid him just on his bed and he
[2:16:58] made herself on the way to the man of
[2:17:02] God
[2:17:04] and while she was on her donkey gehasi
[2:17:07] came her way
[2:17:09] and he said it's it's all well with the
[2:17:11] boy it's all well with the husband and
[2:17:13] brother brame said that woman said all
[2:17:15] is well
[2:17:17] the bar is dead everything is there but
[2:17:19] she says all is well in other words my
[2:17:23] father is in control
[2:17:25] all is well the doctor says this and
[2:17:28] this all is well my father is in control
[2:17:32] can you say Amen Putin says this and
[2:17:35] Putin says this and we say all is well
[2:17:38] because Putin can do not nothing but God
[2:17:42] doesn't allow
[2:17:43] everything I mean every move
[2:17:46] God is behind every move
[2:17:49] so she comes he said the boy is dead
[2:17:53] and what happened is that that that that
[2:17:56] that that that the Prophet Elijah he's
[2:17:58] just sent a little gift a little staff
[2:18:02] and send it over to laid upon the boy
[2:18:08] and when they laid it upon it
[2:18:12] it never worked
[2:18:14] brother sister you must understand this
[2:18:16] message is not not a new Catholicism
[2:18:20] you can go to Jeffersonville you can
[2:18:23] touch the rifle of brother Branham you
[2:18:25] can touch the pulpit of Brother by him
[2:18:26] you can even go to Sunset mountain and
[2:18:29] and lift your hands in the air but there
[2:18:32] is no more God there
[2:18:34] God is in his words
[2:18:39] amen
[2:18:40] there is no touching of certain things
[2:18:43] and now I get healed about this
[2:18:45] so she got a little gift
[2:18:48] and to lay it upon the boy
[2:18:51] and I want to say it like this we are
[2:18:54] for the gifts I have a gift
[2:18:57] and if you have a gift praise the Lord
[2:19:00] use your gift for the glory of God
[2:19:03] but understand a gift will not give you
[2:19:06] eternal life
[2:19:07] never major Upon A minor no gift will
[2:19:11] give you rapturing Faith rapturing faces
[2:19:13] in the words
[2:19:15] can you say no emotion gives you
[2:19:17] rapturing faith if you find your
[2:19:19] position in the words
[2:19:20] you can stream Marcus Becca up and down
[2:19:23] you can say that's the best preacher in
[2:19:24] the world but that will not help you on
[2:19:26] Long effect you just become Marcus fan
[2:19:28] not more you must touch him the person
[2:19:31] yourself you must get that message and
[2:19:34] eat the book yourself
[2:19:36] okay
[2:19:37] you say Amen
[2:19:40] amen I'll take another name what to say
[2:19:44] so now
[2:19:46] tied to God
[2:19:49] that Prophet now comes down the mountain
[2:19:54] and goes down into that house of that
[2:19:57] window woman
[2:20:00] brother Ben said it like this and here's
[2:20:03] our father who speaks
[2:20:05] brother Brahm said whenever it is
[2:20:07] important whenever deals of God's
[2:20:10] children God is not sending an angel he
[2:20:13] comes down personally
[2:20:16] amen
[2:20:17] tied to our time Revelation 10. among
[2:20:21] God came down to make the Rapture sure
[2:20:23] for us
[2:20:24] amen it was not Elijah searching The
[2:20:27] Chariot it was this Chariot searching
[2:20:29] Elijah
[2:20:30] blessed be the name at least these
[2:20:33] angels are searching us we are not
[2:20:35] searching you are not searching you of
[2:20:36] the offering because the offer is
[2:20:38] searching you
[2:20:40] to make sure that you come home
[2:20:42] because you have a place prepared from
[2:20:44] God
[2:20:45] what a father we have
[2:20:47] Calvary just opened the way for it what
[2:20:50] a what a blessed thing
[2:20:52] I know that I'm repeating myself can you
[2:20:54] say Amen so far
[2:20:55] this is the last service of this year
[2:20:59] and I just want to make it as a little
[2:21:01] dedication service to say Lord look
[2:21:04] about the Beauty and the goodness of God
[2:21:06] in 2022 and look how God will be with us
[2:21:10] in 2023.
[2:21:13] and that we can say this message is not
[2:21:15] a Doctrine it is a father that talked to
[2:21:17] us
[2:21:18] I'm not I know that I'm repeating myself
[2:21:20] but it's so beautiful that some of the
[2:21:22] youngsters
[2:21:23] that you understand how our father works
[2:21:26] amen and how it's make makes it matters
[2:21:30] so much to become Born Again amen
[2:21:33] because you become then like your father
[2:21:35] I know I'm repeating myself maybe
[2:21:37] somebody remember
[2:21:39] but here comes that little boy
[2:21:41] and he wants to and he wants to buy some
[2:21:44] dogs
[2:21:45] and the owner of this boy comes down the
[2:21:48] staircase and the boy says I want to
[2:21:49] have that dog and
[2:21:51] the owner says what do you want to do
[2:21:53] with that dog I mean he's handicapped he
[2:21:56] cannot walk like the rest he has no
[2:21:57] value what do you want to have with the
[2:21:59] dog and the boy is just putting up the
[2:22:02] throat the trousers on his leg
[2:22:05] and from his knee down he is handicapped
[2:22:09] and the boy says I want to buy this dog
[2:22:12] because if when we go out he understands
[2:22:15] me and I understand him
[2:22:17] and brother Ben said this God became man
[2:22:21] to understand me
[2:22:24] that's our father
[2:22:27] God was not sitting in heaven and said
[2:22:29] okay we will see who will make the
[2:22:30] Rapture only only the brave Only the
[2:22:33] Good only only who comes Sunday and
[2:22:35] Wednesday and Friday and
[2:22:37] the raptures our father comes down
[2:22:40] and takes us up home
[2:22:44] the Rapture is not a reward system a
[2:22:46] bonus point system so so often I read a
[2:22:49] message so it must be in our heart to
[2:22:51] serve the Lord and that the inner man is
[2:22:54] fed by the word of the Lord amen quote
[2:22:57] brother Brennan
[2:22:58] God became teenager to understand the
[2:23:01] teenagers
[2:23:03] quote brother Ben God became man
[2:23:05] physically you want to understand what I
[2:23:07] want to say as a mixed group to
[2:23:09] understand man
[2:23:10] so whatever you pray God says I know
[2:23:13] what you talk about because I was a man
[2:23:15] myself
[2:23:16] whatever weakness we speak we confess
[2:23:18] him God says I understand that because
[2:23:20] you're in a body who has thrives and is
[2:23:22] a mammal body I understand what you say
[2:23:25] that's the father that we serve
[2:23:28] therefore we can say whatever happens in
[2:23:31] your life don't stay home
[2:23:34] um and the biggest mistakes that you
[2:23:37] make just coming to the house of God is
[2:23:38] a Heavenly Father Here I Am you will not
[2:23:41] become more spiritual by staying home
[2:23:44] that is the time to have a father and
[2:23:46] not having a religion that is the time
[2:23:48] that you speak open with him Lord that's
[2:23:51] my weakness honestly I want to be
[2:23:53] different but that is my weakness and
[2:23:54] God says I made you that way but I help
[2:23:56] you out can you say Amen
[2:23:59] amen therefore we love to preach this
[2:24:02] message
[2:24:02] so he comes into the house amen
[2:24:07] and the boy lays there and the prophet
[2:24:11] enters
[2:24:12] God in form of their prophet and he
[2:24:16] closes all the doors
[2:24:18] again your tenth Vision it will not be a
[2:24:22] public show
[2:24:23] amen God does great things without
[2:24:25] playing it for the people I'm I'm very
[2:24:29] intimidated and what he does is this
[2:24:31] he lays himself upon the boy
[2:24:34] brother and this is what this message
[2:24:36] made with us
[2:24:38] I mean our mouth is his mouth
[2:24:42] our eyes became his eyes
[2:24:45] our mind became the mind of God he laid
[2:24:48] himself upon the dead body of his bride
[2:24:51] and the bride comes to life
[2:24:53] and she knows who she is
[2:24:55] can you say Amen
[2:24:57] God in silence does great things
[2:25:01] God does not forget his children amen
[2:25:04] blessed be the name of the Lord amen I
[2:25:08] story is not finished last point do you
[2:25:10] love the Lord
[2:25:12] therefore gospel is good news
[2:25:15] even if God corrects us even if God is
[2:25:19] chastening us even if he but God is
[2:25:21] molding us with a purpose
[2:25:23] so we say now they're just wonderful and
[2:25:25] the Bible continues it says it came to
[2:25:28] pass at the seven years end that the
[2:25:31] woman returned out of the land of the
[2:25:33] Philistines and she went fast to cry
[2:25:35] unto the king for her house and for her
[2:25:37] land and the King talked with gehazi the
[2:25:41] servant of the man of God saying tell me
[2:25:44] I pray thee all great things that Elisha
[2:25:47] had done and it came to pass as he was
[2:25:51] telling the King how he had restored a
[2:25:54] dead body to life that behold the woman
[2:25:57] who his son had restored to life cried
[2:26:00] to the king for a house and foreign
[2:26:07] and this is her son whom Elisha restore
[2:26:10] to life and when the king asked the
[2:26:13] woman she told him so the king appointed
[2:26:16] unto her as certain officer saying
[2:26:18] restore all that was hers and all the
[2:26:22] fruits of the field since the day that
[2:26:24] she left the land even until now
[2:26:29] can you say Amen
[2:26:31] it started with the little tracts
[2:26:34] with a little conversion Jesus loves you
[2:26:36] oh where okay rapturing face Tabernacle
[2:26:38] yes I need Jesus okay that's fine it
[2:26:41] started with salvation but sooner or
[2:26:44] later God showed you no no no no no no
[2:26:45] no I have much more with you than just
[2:26:47] salvation I bring you back
[2:26:50] I'm into the place where you belong to
[2:26:53] you said great he brings us back to the
[2:26:55] book of Acts no no no he takes us pharah
[2:26:59] he takes us till the Garden of Eden
[2:27:01] praise him no no no no he takes us far
[2:27:04] away
[2:27:05] um he takes us back to our origin
[2:27:08] amen into a body that belongs which is
[2:27:11] eternal
[2:27:12] can you say Amen what a father we have
[2:27:15] we did not know who we were but God knew
[2:27:17] who we were
[2:27:19] and so everything in our life what we do
[2:27:21] for God let it become
[2:27:24] a part of thankfulness to our father
[2:27:28] when we say as for me and my house we
[2:27:30] serve the Lord it should not be because
[2:27:32] we are fearing death
[2:27:34] we're not fearing death it couldn't be
[2:27:36] we're Believers Christ paid for us but
[2:27:39] we do everything that we do out of love
[2:27:41] for our Eternal Father Can you say Amen
[2:27:45] when we pray when we come to church let
[2:27:47] it do it with all our hearts to say as
[2:27:49] for me and my house we serve the Lord if
[2:27:52] the musicians would come Hallelujah and

[2:29:03] a pastor friend of mine he was bringing
[2:29:06] a real message of cutting those people
[2:29:09] and really repenting them and after
[2:29:11] service nobody repented everybody was
[2:29:13] applauding
[2:29:14] he said I didn't ask for Applause but
[2:29:17] for repentance

[2:29:20] repentance I want to just say let us be
[2:29:22] aware what kind of church we are we are

[2:39:45] trying to sleep he heard a voice
[2:39:48] and the voice said John this is Jesus

[2:46:48] are backslidden and you know that you
[2:46:50] are not where you should be though you
[2:46:52] are quite some time on your way amen and
[2:46:55] God calls you to a higher call I want
[2:46:58] you to stand up and make a confession
[2:46:59] before all the angels I said I'm not
[2:47:01] what I should be
[2:47:03] and I want the Holy Spirit and I want
[2:47:06] the word of the Lord to change my life
[2:47:09] not to become just old in the message
[2:47:12] and become more worldly than I ever was
[2:47:15] I want to say heavenly father you called
[2:47:17] me with a holy call years and years ago
[2:47:19] but it seems I became a little bit
[2:47:21] church member I became a little bit
[2:47:24] religious in this message but heavenly
[2:47:27] father let me grow let me let me again
[2:47:32] flap These Wings that you gave me
[2:47:35] let me just stream and be a little bit
[2:47:37] entertained but Lord let me eat the book
[2:47:39] let me get my time with you and go up
[2:47:43] into the eternity with you brother
[2:47:46] Marcus cannot do it for me brother Noah
[2:47:49] but heavenly father I'm not where I
[2:47:51] should be but I ask you please
[2:47:54] take my hands
[2:47:57] amen I cannot change my past but please
[2:48:00] heavenly father when I'm entering into
[2:48:02] 2023 let it be a changing year for me
[2:48:08] let me become a father
[2:48:10] who is a model for his family let me be
[2:48:14] a father like God as a father to me let
[2:48:17] me be a mother like God is a mother to
[2:48:19] me
[2:48:21] amen
[2:48:23] so Heavenly Father we are we are we're
[2:48:26] just consecrating our life
[2:48:29] you see we don't need a prayer line
[2:48:31] you are the prayer line we can't make a
[2:48:33] prayer line
[2:48:35] but Heavenly Father you spoke to their
[2:48:37] hearts foreign
[2:48:39] [Music]
[2:48:46] because goodness and mercy will follow
[2:48:48] me all the days of my life
[2:48:51] amen let us all sit down
[2:48:54] amen and you please
[2:48:59] take that purpose I many times say to
[2:49:01] the young people
[2:49:02] don't expect that tomorrow everything is
[2:49:05] new it's a process
[2:49:07] but you're entering into that process
[2:49:10] voluntary step by step
[2:49:13] don't go home and think everything will
[2:49:15] be new it's not new we have to throw
[2:49:17] this out everything it will not change
[2:49:19] but you make a stop at a start to now
[2:49:23] step by step
[2:49:25] bring things under your control under
[2:49:27] the feet of Satan as we were singing
[2:49:29] today
[2:49:31] and you take your own confession amen
[2:49:35] and bring it before the Lord
[2:49:37] and you water it with prayer and he said
[2:49:40] according be it according to your will
[2:49:43] and I will arrive exactly there you
[2:49:47] water your confession must always be
[2:49:49] positive God in his time has seen my
[2:49:53] hand and he has seen my stand therefore
[2:49:56] I told you in the beginning I'm that
[2:49:58] woman took a stand for God and brother
[2:50:00] Brandon called her you got that price
[2:50:03] because God saw your attitude with that
[2:50:07] dress
[2:50:08] is not who has the longest stress is our
[2:50:10] attitude towards God you honor God and
[2:50:14] God will honor you
[2:50:16] that is gospel because God is a father
[2:50:20] heavenly father is a different ending
[2:50:23] than our thought but
[2:50:25] you are so wonderful
[2:50:28] we come out of 2022 we are on the way
[2:50:31] home we are pilgrims
[2:50:35] we are not strangers we are pilgrims but
[2:50:37] here is people they decide I want to be
[2:50:40] better on track
[2:50:42] I want to really serve the Lord not in
[2:50:45] legalism it never worked it will never
[2:50:47] work
[2:50:48] but I want to have
[2:50:50] a little room in my own heart where you
[2:50:53] can come wherever you want to talk to me
[2:50:55] because you told one time to your
[2:50:58] prophet
[2:51:00] why don't you walk with me
[2:51:03] that is what you tell your Earthly bride
[2:51:06] I want to walk with you I want to talk
[2:51:09] with you I want to have fellowship with
[2:51:11] you because this is bright age
[2:51:14] and last we want to tell you we want to
[2:51:16] we don't want to be too busy
[2:51:18] to serve you amen
[2:51:22] blessed be the name of the Lord if you
[2:51:24] wouldn't mind we just end with the song
[2:51:28] if you know the song I have a father
[2:51:30] amen amen that fight for you amen and
[2:51:34] that and then I give over to this
[2:51:36] giveaway to the song service or to the
[2:51:37] pastor what do you think to our brother
[2:51:39] do we sing the song Amen you can't
[2:51:42] imagine I could now have made any kind
[2:51:45] of come to the front I come down we will
[2:51:47] this and cry we're not doing this your
[2:51:50] reaction is for God enough it's for God
[2:51:54] enough but if you purposed in your
[2:51:56] hearts
[2:51:57] um you speak your dad and you speak with
[2:51:59] your pastor hey what is my next step to
[2:52:02] do I want to serve the Lord I want to
[2:52:04] take his hand amen do you see that was
[2:52:07] an altar call without fear did you
[2:52:09] realize that
[2:52:11] did you realize it was an altar call
[2:52:13] without pressure
[2:52:14] amen it was not to confirm the preacher
[2:52:17] a preacher doesn't have to be confirmed
[2:52:19] how great the service was it was just
[2:52:22] God telling his children children I love
[2:52:25] you
[2:52:25] I mean come home
[2:52:28] like every daddy tells his children come
[2:52:30] home and daddy is waiting for you I'm a
[2:52:33] blessed be the name of the Lord what a
[2:52:36] father we have God bless you it's a
[2:52:38] great honor I'm going to follow that
