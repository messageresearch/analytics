God for bringing this message across our path thank God for for his love to us and we just appreciate him so much we also thank the Lord for this opportunity for us to to meet in this way just trust that that the Lord will will bless us in every way to die and just looking forward to what the Lord has for us I was tremendously blessed blessed yesterday and and I am I'm certainly going to go listen to that service again myself are just so blessed and thank God for His goodness I would like to thank brother Jason again for his willingness to to take part and say good morning brother Jason god bless you richly and we're just looking forward to what the Lord has for us this morning I would just like to announce now that for those who who have the time and who can be involved we have a second service tomorrow evening we we haven't we didn't announce that initially but on Monday night New Zealand time we will have another service where brother a bee will take a second service so tonight we have brother a bee on six-thirty in New Zealand time and then tomorrow night we have him again so that that was that will be extra service I trusted that that would be a blessing so maybe before we hand over to brother Jason it's just open with freer and just ask the Lord to do bless us again if you have a need on your heart you can make it known to the Lord now as we take them to the Lord precious heavenly father it is lovely to know you it's a privilege father that we can come on this Easter Sunday morning the first day of the week father when you rose father and we want to honor your resurrection father but that resurrection is very personal Lord well random spoke these words what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is we are now living in the fullness of that resurrection our garden we just thank you this morning father for the work that you've done 2,000 years ago but also for the work that's happening in our lives father our garden we just looking

amen let's just sing a song B before we hand over to brother Jason how about we sing that that chorus of consuming fire let me just find it here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] brother Jason Europe Commission my brother praise Lord God bless you all hey man god bless you there in New Zealand bring you greetings again today forum you it's morning and what a morning it no doubt is we are still here behind you so you're ahead of us I hope it doesn't happen like that in the rapture I hope we get to all go together amen and so but congratulations on a man being ready to receive the Lord on Easter 2020 amen I don't think any of us as I was commenting last night never would have imagined that we would still be here but obviously the Lord has purpose in it amen if he didn't you can rest assure God's not redundant he doesn't waste time life and things like that are very valuable to God and every Jesus illustrates that clearly taking the Bible with so many different authors and written over so many years by so many different people and yet Jesus would say not even an iota not a jot or tittle of it can fail I mean that's a jot or a tittle is even less than what we would understand to be a punctuation so every word that God has given us is purposed and so we're purposed people a man and this message came for a purpose we were ministering on that to you last yesterday morning yesterday I've learned to say today that way it covers you in the morning and me in the evening so he was ministering we were ministering yesterday on God's purpose in our life and kind of as a as a theme because we we found that we are approaching a resurrection that wonderful day I don't know about you but it's been a day but I've looked for all my life since a child since a young boy my parents in the prophets meetings I was raised right into it said it my mother's knee is just a young lad hearing the stories of the Bible and that the tales of adventure my mom could make the Bible live and I tell you I all my childhood heroes were Bible characters and you know my first big thick official big book I could ever say I officially read a big grown-ups book and it was called King David and a man I loved that book and I've never found it sequel there's a lot of books written about David I love the stories in the Bible because they they give me purpose they let me realize that none of this is an accident amen so we won again to thank brother al ray and a wonderful team of of people that he has their brothers and sisters I I said the brothers last night and then I remembered I saw a very lovely little sister playing the piano I could hear brother ray talking but it didn't look like him anymore and so I thought okay he must be in the same room somewhere and I understood it was his daughter so we want to thank our sister and any others who were participating making this happen it's a wonderful privilege for me to be able to come to you we're gonna look right into the scripture the 1st Thessalonians 4 real familiar to us all ah we could almost probably quote it we've been hearing it for many years 1st Thessalonians 4 and I want to just start right in verse 13 and we'll go through verse 17 and then we will begin to go from there all right so I last our yesterday I was speaking on the approach the approaching resurrection and so today I want to move into this term and at a term now not just that we're approaching it but that we're on a journey to that resurrection and now that is going to be a jumping off from where I was so emphasizing yesterday about that you know we're here for a purpose and God has a plan and and our life isn't to just go down to the docks set on our luggage and wait on the old ship of Zion no we're on a journey friends and and so you know this was something that God you know you know really he noticed it and he mentions it to the children of Israel when they had failed so miserably and he he emphasizes to them that I sent you on a journey and it's hard to say you know what you you could almost want to ask that mixed multitude what did you think this was about you know I mean a prophet comes in you're gonna go out of 400 years of slavery according to a promise that happened to our father Abraham and and there was darkness and water turned to blood and and the angel the Death Angel came through the camp and there was hail and there was frogs what do you think that was about do you think God was just you know there for a circus act or was this just you know so so we can go out and just you know start another country no friends it this message didn't come to it to give you better theology than the Baptist now we have better theology than the Baptist we have better theology than all of them but that's not why it came it came to show us we're on a journey to position us in the word so we could be prepared for what we need to be about we need to be about the father's business 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 what a wonderful time what a wonderful time to be at Easter weekend 1st Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word as you are seated god bless you amen so from yesterday in the approaching time of the resurrection we we came to the ending and we were showing you how we're showing you the pattern and we emphasize from the Old Testament how that all of those people spanning all of those all of those decades and even millennia and multiple millennia that they were living out parts of their life that Christ would be a fullness of and then we found it curious and and and to me it was it's wonderful to to to loot to see it line out how that you we came down to John the Baptist and we found that from the time of John the Baptist there to announce that he's among you somewhere and then from there he would announce oh there he is he's here and then he would say now I must decrease and then he did he didn't die immediately but he began to fade out and then Christ comes on the scene and then now John with his six months of ministry the Lord Jesus with his three and a half years of ministry by Roman calendar three years by Jewish calendar we find that then then the Upper Room experience and then the book of Acts begins to be written and then Paul comes on the scene and then Paul lives out his ministry and then Paul goes home I fought a good fight I've kept the faith from there's a crown awaiting me and all those who love his appearing was it done note that it's still ticking John is still there he's the last living apostle then he's going to be sent to the Isle of Patmos and we're gonna find that he's there for some years then he comes back then he brings back the book of Revelation and then he passes away and you'll find that all of those years that ended up being decades through multiple ministries John and Jesus and the Apostles and Paul and then John on the island and coming back and every bit of that is housed in a single ministry that comes at the end time and a prophet of Elijah of this day because we're literally introduced to Christ and then restored back the entire teaching of st. Paul and taken into the book of Revelation and the mysteries are opened up to us a man blessed be the name of the Lord now I excuse me I'm hearing like is this microphone catching something it's like something's rubbing maybe somebody's bumping okay maybe it's me I just want to make sure we had an audio issue as we started yesterday it cleared up fortunately we were able to switch mics hopefully today we have a backup mic in case that would happen have a little better audio appreciate all the hard work of the brothers so now we find then that that you know if you just think about everything that I just said what a surety what a Salaam that should bring us because you can't accidentally do that nobody could have planned it like that to send and it's not that william branham made that up I'm just simply referencing the history of his ministry you know it I know it the whole world knows it it it perfectly patterned the time from John and we see with the opening of the seals it goes right all the way to the Ministry of Paul to the book of Revelation and that is the that is that is the masterpiece work and when you have a masterpiece work its evidence there's a master behind it there's a master builder who can build a masterpiece and so we we thank God for a certainty and it was so beautiful in the thing to me that makes it even more lovely is the simplicity of it all and we find that that that God did it so simply and here we have such a dark hour that we live in but I want you to know that we have a certainty of that same simplicity in this hour doesn't matter what's happening to the world they're running in fear they're locking their doors they're you know and I and I'm not against common sense and and and we're even meeting here tonight and and and socially distance trying to follow their guidelines but I'm here to tell you something friends the world is not going to get better it can't get better it's got to get worse so why don't you just go ahead and start today and say I'm just gonna trust the Lord from here on cuz it ain't getting any better I was listening as I was studying approaching this weekend and and I was saw I found it somewhat fascinating I III had a chance to to kind of listen to some some podcast of some of the great supposedly the great minds of our day and the great thinkers and they were they were you know every every topic was being discussed and I had I had a purpose behind it it's not that I do that very often but I was I was making a comparison in my mind to the message that we have from the mind of God - that came through a Kentucky hillbilly let me tell you I've driven through the areas of Kentucky he was born and raised in they are hillbillies and I'm here to tell you God did it that way by design was brilliant it was brilliant on God's part because now you you go and you look at these men find men nothing to say against them some of them I I greatly admired and they they're men of learning and of multiple races and multiple ethnicities and and very brilliant men and you know but I but I realized that one would have this opinion and they'd ask him about a social issue and he'd have an opinion and you know there's this social issue and this political question well what about this going on and and they and I and I and I just listened to them for almost a whole day just going from different one to different one trying to get various opinions and and and I I found exactly what I was hunting I found just what I thought I would find and that is that they don't have any real answers they have a lot of philosophy they have a lot of things they believe are correct and they disagree one with another and then one will sit here and be the armchair quarterback of why this president when Lyndon Johnson and he did it this and he should have did it this way if he did it this way we wouldn't have had this issue and if Kennedy would have did this then this would have happened or we could have had this instead of that and I just sit there and thought what madness I would feel so bad if that's all I had if all I had was men and the Bible says they thought themselves to be so wise they became fools I'm here to tell you something friend in this strange and fearful time we have an anchor we have a surety hallelujah gives us peace it gives us understanding we have more understanding I was saying to one of my grandson's he's making his way now through the church age book I've persuaded him to read it I hooked him in I knew it would work I've made him read the resume first and you can't read the resume in the church age book then you got to devour the book I promise you if you're ever gonna give somebody a church age book make them promise to read the resume first only book I ever say read back first unless you're my mom she always reads the back of a book first so I don't know why it's just her thing so she can't stand you know she's got a she's got to know the ending so so and she doesn't read fiction she reads history but she's always got to read the end first and so uh so III like the back of this book I like the first check book in the last book really well the devil don't like him too good and that's probably why I like him so good but you know I talked him into reading the resume and sure enough it hooked him and I said and now he's he said man I gotta go back and catch that first chapter cuz I read this in the resume and I gotta see what that's all about he was testifying to me today that he's he's going through it you know devouring it and so I was really proud of him and and so so you know we we have such a such a piece such an anchor we and I and I told him I said I said uriah I promise you I promise you if you really just digest that Church age book just read it don't speed read it thoroughly think about it and digest it and assimilate it I said when you get done at just 15 years old you'll have more understanding of this book I promise you then men who have spent decades in Bible theology schools you'll understand it far more than they will ever understand it and and and and that is that is the privilege that we have as believers I was amazed to hear brother al ray using this quote from the rising of the Sun because I was sitting in the back office preparing and I just had it come on my heart to to put this in here this is actually the intro to our church videos on our archives or whenever you're live streaming or archiving from our website then this brother Matt who built our site arranged for it to play began you know and brother branham oh this the quote starts out because I live he live also speaking to his wife because I live he live also and then it comes on right away on our website what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power oh my he goes on to say he was waved to them the word now this is an important point I'm not just reading this because it's Easter because brother Brandon talks about you know the significance brother Branham said there had been many men who had give their life for a great cause many great men good men who willingly gave their life for a very noble ahh and royal cause he says but never was there a man who could lay his life down and then pick his own life back up again there was never a man like this man but he raised for a purpose he raised on a mission see I I had a I had a a preacher say to me some some time ago and he was saying you know Calvary's all we need that calvary said I don't need a message I said Calvary's it yeah Calvary is all I need I said so you don't need the resurrection oh well yeah I mean well yeah of course yeah of course we have to have the resurrection - okay good what about the Ascension yeah I guess that I guess we needed that - okay well what about when he came back and brought his life into the church you need that do uh yeah I guess we need that too I said so you're gonna be a little more than Calvary you're gonna need more than death you're gonna need more than burial you're gonna need resurrection you're gonna need a sentient you're gonna need him to come back again and live inside you hallelujah I said do you honestly suppose I said answer a question for me he said he said well but that that's all the process of Calvary and he said you know oh that's that's all that a man needs and I said okay all right so let's go a little for a little further I said so so if if a man comes up before God's throne and they he's asked about his his worthiness and his his ability to enter into heaven and the man's testimony is this I was I was at Golgotha I saw him I believed him I said that's the Son of God I believe that he's dying there for my sins and he said all of that I said would you say that man being good standing he goes oh yeah he'd be in real good standing and and if he said I just believed Jesus he said yeah that's what he needs to do I said well you better hear the other half of it but then he says but now as far as those apostles I mean I don't know about those guys you know that Paul's kind of strange there's Peter he's kind of ignorant and I don't really like some of their teaching and I don't really need the book of Acts or the New Testament or Paul's letters or John I just believed Jesus I said do you suppose that man would find acceptance in the presence of God and he said well that's a real good question I said you sure is I said wants to go think about that and come back and give me your answer he never came back and gave me an answer but I'm gonna tell you something friend where where you you know people people love to say that you know I don't need a message I don't need a prophet I just love Jesus and I say you know Jesus yes which one oh well there was only one I said oh no Paul spoke of another Jesus that people would worship and he wasn't the original Jesus but he was a he was a man-made contrivance and they would worship Him and they'd forsake the real Jean and because the real Jesus isn't synonymous with his word he is his word and there's no way today to deny his word and say I love Jesus you don't love Jesus you love another Jesus that man has concocted to give you a lifestyle that you can just live any away and it doesn't really matter because I love Jesus all you're in love with is a historical idea of a man who lived 2,000 years ago and you're not even aware that Jesus Christ there is the same yesterday today and forever he's risen he didn't just die there he didn't just get buried there he rose and he ascended and he sent back gifts and gave gifts unto men and he lives in his body hallelujah he shapes and molds your life and mold your mind and mold your attitude once you accept his lordship you will never be the same he will make no mistake he will change everything about you he loves you when he finds you saves you and redeemed you and fills you with his spirit he loves you far too much to leave you like he found you so it's important now that when you realize that he's waved over them the word this is an important statement the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost so you know we're at in history in the Bible it's on the day of Pentecost and he says it like this four simple words the word made manifest and that's what he calls that he was waved to them waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made flesh now he didn't come among them in the flesh so if it was the word made manifest then it had to be in their flesh so now now they become the living word you understand so it's not just about head knowledge or doctrine this is a this is a life force that comes inside of you and now you become the word made flesh that's the Ministry of the Son of Man the Son of Man is not unique to our day it was in Jesus day it was in the Apostles day it means the Word made flesh I'm not talking about the office of son of man that's a prophet that was Paul that was brother Branham that was one to a generation that but that gift that prophet go can still go home like Paul did and brother Branham did but the ministry of the son of man was still alive and it is today it's the word in you the Word made flesh you are the body of the Lord now that's not just something to tickle your ears with that should have impact on your life because he says now as I say it's to be waved again in the last day so again the word is to come flesh come back full brother Branham says in the path of life 1962 he's referencing of course Psalms 1/16 familiar to us precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints brother Branham says now the Bible said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints see that's when the time comes I said he's at a funeral and he's his funeral text and he's he's now he's giving these people in the path of life he's giving them a testimony about when he preached the funeral and he said you know I was I said the Bible said precious in the sight of the Lord as the death of his Saints when that time comes and I said the life is going back now I'm preaching to you tonight I went yesterday and preached you about it Roach and today I'm preaching you that we're on a journey to something now watch this language the life is going back so the life is going somewhere so brother Brandon would say you know that when Jesus you know and I don't have it here in front of me it's familiar to most I'm sure where brother Branham says that he's talking to his disciples you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you in other words I never forget where they Abraham Myra preaching that and he said you know so sincere was the Lord Jesus such a man of honesty that he just said listen if this weren't true I would just tell you I wouldn't lie to you if it weren't so I just admitted to you but if it weren't so but in my father's house are many mansions hallelujah if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place that where I am you can be also I love that scripture because it really speaks of the coming of the Holy Ghost more than it speaks of the Millennium I know you're right away in your mind say Jesus says I go to prepare place that's speaking of heaven that's speaking of the Millennium but Jesus didn't say I go to prepare a place that where I'll be you'll be he said I go to prepare that where I am right now the condition that I'm in what kind of what separated him from them because he had the Spirit of God inside of him and it literally made him a brother branham said he lived in a world all to himself he was a mystic to the people that life of God inside him was gonna come inside of them and he said where I am right now that you may be also because if you don't get that life here you're not gonna go to a world there hallelujah so it's all about being filled with the light and and then and then and then it's not you trying to get into a rapture it's the life in you being rapture hallelujah oh my so the life is going back brother Branham said life is a tree we are all hanging on a tree of life that's right see so we I don't have time to just get into this labor too long I I feel like you're following along with me so we find in that sin is is a necessary element for redemption that is necessary brother Branham said that it was necessary for God to predestinate a man who would need salvation in order to give himself a reason and purpose of being so we find then that sin is a necessary element for redemption but listen friends once redemption is finished then then it's you understand when redemptions claims are completely finished then the new heavens and the new earth opens up at the end of the millennium at the end of the judgment it's all done death and he'll are cast into the lake of fire and then John said I saw a new heavens and a new earth and then it's not even time any longer it's not even time the millenniums actually in time if if though and that's why you know the world's not ending I'm always correcting people you find them and in my chaplaincy work with the police departments and I and I and I'm all time in conversations you know somebody will say all the world's ending I said oh no no no it's just changed its transitioning world can't be annihilate its internal attribute of God they're like huh wait what the world's not ending I said no goodness no the millennium is gonna be right here it's not ending it's just it's just transitioning to a new ownership the sons of God are gonna come forward now King is gonna set on the throne and it's going to be the sovereign of the whole world and he's going to have his royal family who are gonna be the administrators of his laws and of his justice hallelujah there there'll be there will be the world would be filled brother Branham talks about heathens raised up and an honor to preach on all that and and and people who who we rule over with uh with a rod of iron brother em said you're not gonna rule if you don't have inviting subjects to rule over so I'm not preaching on the land and I don't mean to get down into that but we're going somewhere and then that's why if you're full of the Holy Ghost today and and if the rapture were to occur tomorrow for sure you would see the 22nd century you will be alive in the 24th century I will be alive in the Year 26:45 but Jaco will be alive in the Year 2027 nineteen I'll be alive in the year twenty eight eighty hallelujah and then when that's all over then it's on to eternity yeah one of the our friends you understand what you've been called to oh it deserves our everything hallelujah so it it but but my emphasis is it's going forward so your life is never to be stagnant you weren't here as I said yesterday God didn't say that an altar and say okay you're saved great seeing that see in heaven you're safe for a purpose you're redeemed you're redeemed unto God God had a vision for you and now it's time for you to cooperate in the vision so we're on a journey to the resurrection now resurrection is a beautiful term because resurrection means to cause something that had ended to exist again to cause something that had been forgotten or lost to be used again that's a very beautiful thing I want to say it again the resurrection is to cause something that had ended or been forgotten or lost to exist again to be used again so this is why now you can understand this is why the Bible would call death precious because the transition was never to be a sad loss that's not what death is about death is a temporary sorrow for us I've experienced it at a very personal level I've got a father and two brothers on the other side waiting for me so I know what it is to to grieve a poet and say that we don't grieve you just said we don't grieve like the world Greek you know we're because they don't have a hope we we not only have a hope we have an assurance so the Bible calls death precious it's never to be looked at as a sad loss the resurrection here's an important point now what listen don't don't I say all the time don't throw a rock at me till you hear me out and it's gonna be hard for you to hit me from New Zealand but listen the resurrection is not merely an event marked on a heavenly calendar I want to say that again the resurrection is not an event on a heavenly calendar that's going to like like some occurrence because Jesus said when when when Mary when Martha said to him he said my brother shall rise again and she said yes in the resurrection at the last day Jesus didn't say oh yeah when the calendar hits and that event comes no jesus said I am the resurrection not she see in her mind she's got a calendar event I know at the last day Jesus Anan ha no you're missing the whole point I the resurrection see and so so so and and it's a fair question you can say well but you know isn't isn't the resurrection a translated people yes of course yes of course the resurrection is a translated people but the trend but the actual translation of their bodies is the final move of the Holy Ghost in the pride because yes it's a translated people who before they were translated were transformed by the renewing of their mind so you understand now now got you moving with me this thing's going forward you're on a journey we're approaching something you're moving along and God's will you're not here just killing time hallelujah your life isn't meaningless I don't care it doesn't matter if you have the lowliest job and brother branham said if you're just a foot wash flunky I'm here to tell you I don't love dope in that foot wash flunky who gotta who had the opportunity to wash the feet of the master oh I never passed it up say how do you know you wouldn't have passed it up then cuz I don't pass it up now hallelujah so so now you're understanding you're you're approaching you're moving life is going back we're going somewhere you're on a journey see so in this journey there's a process it's a it's a birth and it's a growth and it's a girl it's a maintenance and and God is a my jesus said my father is the gardener my father is the farmer my father is the husbandman see so yes it's a translated people it's a people who before they are translated they're transformed by the renewing of their mind you're never gonna face you're never gonna get the translation without transformation hallelujah how did they get transformed because they believed the report they heard the voice of their day hallelujah just like in any age whoever heard the voice of the day and believed it that was a transforming experience in their life and if it didn't transform you then you didn't experience the voice say that's an odd term experience the voice you know hang on hang on it's got to be an experience the whole world has the ability to listen to all 1200 tapes see that doesn't mean it'll never be an experience for him they could even actually believe the doctrine of it brother Branham made it very clear this was a you talking about a a top-secret military intelligence this was classified top-secret Satan had never told anybody this just like back in the day when he when he had a plan in his heart - - I will be like God I will ascend I will be above the stars of heaven he never want anybody to know that but a prophet discerned the secret of his heart and wrote it in the book and then a prophet comes along in this day now Satan's got another secret at the end time he don't want nobody to know and brother Branham discerning as a prophet would says you see friends Satan doesn't care how religious you are he imagines Satan like shut him up somebody don't say that to them Oh further Satan not only not only that but Satan he doesn't not only does he not care how religious you are he doesn't care how right you are in your doctrine because here's what he knows that I can hear all the devil I can hear sloughs we're going now what he knows is that he didn't want you to know that a prophet revealed is if you missed that life you won't come up anyway so he doesn't care how religious you are he'll let you go to church he'll help you go to church he'll find your car keys for you he'll help you he doesn't care he doesn't care if you sit and memorize quotes and memorize scriptures he doesn't care what kind of belt buckle you have or what a kind of vehicle you drive he doesn't care who you went hunting or fishing with he will help you do those things and what he's trying to prevent is you becoming an experience that that voice becomes a living reality see so your journey to the resurrection begins with the revelation of the word for your day it's not merely doctrinal training or teaching but it's Christ revealing himself to you personally now watch our brother Brennan brings this out in the breach between the ages and the seals brother Branham says now seven seals on the book has these seven seals has the book sealed see the book is absolutely sealed do you see it the book is absolutely a sealed book until the seven seals is broken it is sealed up with seven seals he says now that's different from the seven thunders see now brother branham makes he caught and it wasn't obvious to everybody at the moment until he actually quotes it later but brother Branham is already catching that the thunders are the mysteries contained in the seven seals and even if he's not as aware of it at this time until because he doesn't even know he says no I don't know what that first seal is and when he preached diversity said I don't know what the second one is and they preach the sanguine I don't know what the third one is I'm just relying on him and night after night that angel comes in and and reveals these things and so I understand it's progressive to him and it's progressive to him even after the seals were over it's two years later he's standing preaching what is the attraction on the mountain and he's looking back and he's saying my do you realize what happened back there in the Coronado far as this Mini Mouse this direction from Tucson a setting of history a setting of prophecy brother branham is all thrilled all over again realizing what really took place do you realize what really took place back there it's the word becoming clear the word now made made manifest that's what it always was always God's purpose so he goes on he says this is seven seals on the book and the book will nod the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel sea so we are presuming but that but watch this but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth now that's exactly what the word said the mystery should be finished at that time and the seven sealed book remember it was closed here in revelation fifth chapter in Revelations the 10th chapter it's open so now what's it going to be a genuine revelation is going to bring a perfection brother branham makes a mention of that I don't have it here in front of me but how that those ages they they never could come to that perfection because they didn't have the perfecting message it hadn't been restored certainly Paul had it in his day but the church fell away and now Christ must and you know they're perfectly qualified to go in the rapture they've got the abstract title they've got the token they've got the deed of life they've got the perfect word they've got everything I had a preacher say to me some time ago and he said oh but brother you understand brother Branham brought us a deeper understanding than Paul had I'm like how where what and I said okay brother excuse me but what exactly what scripture would you refer me to that teaches me that every scripture I read tells me it's a restoration back to something that it's a restoration of the original the Omegas being restored back to the Alpha back to the book of Acts back to the original faith of the fathers I said beyond that I said please tell me which doctrine in the message that brother Branham ever preached is not founded on what Paul taught which one predestination election are you kidding marriage and divorce who is this Melchizedek the rapture mystery I'm read to you pose understanding of the rapture mystery I mean what would the Godhead baptism please the original sin which one are you going to point me to which and and the Wonder millions who stood there when he said I only ever preached what Paul preached and they shouted we're resting on that that's why we don't need an eighth messenger or an eighth age or another super preacher to stand up we've got the the full word restored and the and the only thing that we're doing that's more than what they had is we're fulfilling things that were left in prophecy sure of course they didn't fulfill it all they fell away Paul said it would happen it did happen and instead of instead of Christ not had to happen in the larger sense I get the fifty thousand foot view brother branham said that seed had to go into the ground it had to so in that sense no they couldn't go in the rapture that's not my point my point is they had all they had the gene they had the abstract they had the Jubilee that everything the prophets had said would come and that's why we're restored so when that church begins to go off which is why brother Branham doesn't he start the church ages until they start falling away he says those first few years it was perfect word and we've been restored back to that and now we pick up where they decline and we take it on up to the rad resurrection of our bodies sure of course there were things in the book of Revelation Paul wasn't even alive when the book of Revelation was written I understand there's things left in prophecy of course there are things that are unique to this hour absolutely I've won hundreds in believe that first of all there there this is the day of the seventh age the seventh angel this is the day of Satan's Eden this is the day when Lucifer is the god of this evil age brother Brenda makes it clear that was not in vain this was the only age that's ever said that about so I understand that this the only age that ever put Christ out of the church I fully understand that there were things that didn't get fulfilled back there and they're being fulfilled in this hour that's not what I'm talking about and I know that they didn't go in a rapture they didn't get a body change we will hallelujah in fact is us finishing where they fell off is what's going to bring the dead out of the graves hallelujah the perfection of this bride hallelujah we'll bring those from the grave who had to go into the grave because the seed had to go in and otherwise it abided alone jesus said that and brother and said I had to go into the ground it had to happen so I get that I understand it completely but sometimes people say sometimes people say oh but we're the final voice to the final age well no kidding but I wonder if sometimes people stop and think why that's true why are you the final voice to the final age because brother Branham said the bride under her messenger because that messenger who we are under restored back the original words of the original voice for all the ages Paul was Paul was the final voice to all the ages Paul said that Paul said if even an angel if anybody I don't care who it is even if I come back and preach any other thing than what I have preached let him be accursed Paul said very boldly that in the day when God will judge the world by Jesus Christ he will judge them according to my gospel Paul was the final will and testament of God on teaching and because that was lost it was able to be restored and a prophet come back to restore that voice which made him the final voice and now we under him are the last and final voice because we've had the restoration of the full voice and now we're moving into realms of of prophetic fulfillment that that age never could fulfill because they died they went into the ground Wow I don't know why I got wind down that path amen I apologize for the owl ray for taking such doctrinal positions if I broke something you can fix it amen hey man hallelujah so god bless see my brother alright I just got excited there but it's it you understand then that this is it's so important because because John John heard a great declaration from heaven and and he heard an uttering of voices that John described as seven thunders uttering their voices so you have to understand John experienced the thunders sounding it's just like Moses Moses stood there at the mountain and God was speaking and and and the people said it sounds like thunder and mode and they were afraid and they there because that mixed multitude and they were falling backwards and Moses like no tomorrow no no no don't don't go away he's he wants to talk to you he's trying to speak you all know Moses no it's too scary for us and but you understand that when Moses heard that voice of God it was an experience it wasn't something that just affected his eardrums everybody else I ran in fear but to Moses it was an experience it was a thunder and that's what you've heard today you've heard a thunder because you've had an experience and when you've had an experience that's a thunder hallelujah you literally become the voice that was speaking in a manifested form you're now a Vindicator that's my brother Brendan so I read that for you that's why he said it's a vindicated God will be made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth God will be made perfect you think God wasn't already perfect within his own self it's not about God being perfect it's about a completion it's about a cycle that's coming to the last say stages of Earth's history and it's about the translator bride at the molecular level and take her off the earth hallelujah oh my see so the mystery of the rapture then so because you had an experience and you know what from that day it didn't matter I want to tell you when you have when you have that kind of experience then that Thunder has taken on more than just information it's taken on more than just theology it's taken on more than just doctrinal teaching because the thunders were the mysteries that we came out of the seven seals and the whole world heard that and they can even believe it and even brother Branham said that doesn't mean they're saved even the devil believes it and brother Branham said he don't make believe it he actually believes it he's not safe he knows the will of God he refuses to do it the whole world I can't they can't resist the teaching of the message not using this book that's impossible I challenge them around the world take one of the doctors that came out of those seals and take this book and prove it wrong you cannot do it but that doesn't save them until this book becomes flesh and brother branham said when the books are closed for the last time the word will be flesh standing there hallelujah I'm here to taste something friends were on a journey that's what this Easter means he's risen because he lived you live also hallelujah that's what Easter means to us glory to God in the highest oh my because you had an experience that's a thunder it's a living reality it's a vindicated truth it's God being perfected in you so the mystery of the rapture how I gotta hurry so the mystery of the rapture is a people becoming the word see no wonder their bodies changed no wonder no not that that's why he talked is the type that's why is he look here's the type of the raptured bride you you find that that that in one sense Noah types thee the foolish virgin carried across the through the tribulation I realized the Ark is Christ and not trying to separate all that out right now I'm not preaching on that I'm just simply saying that Enoch Enoch is the type because his walk his his journey his pilgrimage his walk of life became closer to his heavenly reality than his earthly reality you understand brother Evan describes it that way said he just kept walking started going up he just kept walking and finally God said hey listen you're you're closer to here than you are there you might as well just come on in because literally friends do you understand you have a representation there though don't chase after what do you do and chasing after the pleasures of this flesh what are you doing chasing Laodicea young people come to your senses the earth is burning down you can't stay here don't chase after Hollywood don't chase after sports stars don't chase after those things it's all going to ash and center hallelujah only once eternal will live hallelujah literally his life became closer to his heavenly reality than his earthly reality Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this ask you today believe us how this what say yea new zealand what say you Bethel Tabernacle believe us now this hallelujah if we believe it then what are we doing chasing the world at any time the winds of war and tribulation are blowing I'm here to taste something friend this world is passing away life was never intended to be stationary you weren't intended that you were put here to put roots here then I say this to my church let me say it to you this life is not about this life get that in your heart today if you when you leave this service if you only remember that you'll be a value this life is not about this life this life is about the next one this life here is only a proving ground it's only a training field your only trainings I owe my life this in my life then it's one unfair and why did this happen to him and didn't happen to me or why'd this happen to me it didn't happen to her well I don't know friends but listen I can't answer why everything happened in your life the way it happened but you don't know what you're gonna be over there you don't know you he knows he knows what you need he knows what he's doing father knows best just believe that hallelujah life was never intended to be stationary not even in the Garden of Eden it was playlists it was to be perpetual yes but not stationary it's eternal it's everlasting its unending its ceaseless it's permanent its continual its enduring its undying its uninterrupted that's what life was supposed to be your life was supposed to be uninterrupted God has always had a plan for going forward your life was supposed to be ceaseless now I'm gonna turn my last corner and run for the finish line tonight and again we'll just hit a pause button we're not gonna finish so just it's okay wasn't intended to be the interruption of nature I get that it's in God's grander scheme of things and men would need salvation in order to give himself a reason and purpose I understand that we can that's the 50,000 foot view can I come down out of the ethereal and just come right down to let's get down to Ground Zero where you live because where we live is where we have our questions where we have our ponderings where we live is where we have our fears and our secret problems and our troubles and our weaknesses and things that we only confess to the Lord in our closet that's at Ground Zero phrase and I can preach into the 50,000 foot view all night long all day long and it'll thrill you because you're an eagle and you love hearing about high altitude flight you love being up there you're an eagle it makes sense but listen when these meetings are over you're gonna have to come and face the real world you're going to have to you're going to have to find the wherewithal to believe God's Word you're going to have to find and sometimes as I read to your life is supposed to be under did that was what real life was about he that liveth and believeth on me shall never die he's the bread of life he was the fountain of life it was perpetual life it was eternal life it was ceaseless life it was undying life it was uninterrupted life and many of us have had things in our lives and it's been a total interruption sometimes an interruption to our sanity sometimes an interruption to our faith sometimes an interruption and our love and our marriages and our children and families can become strained oh I'm coming down to Ground Zero today sometimes things happen in churches and between spouses and between preachers and and between parents and yeah I don't I'm not gonna stand up here today and tell you I have all the answers I probably don't have even half of them but I know I know that God's in control I know that for sure and I can't explain it all but I I just know he's gonna make it work to my good that's what he promised he would do and I'm here and only take some friends I don't care how big of a problem you got right now I give you my word it won't matter ten thousand years from now you won't care at all oh when you cross over a promise said the first thing that's gonna go through your mind is why was I ever worried Oh Paul said it's not gonna even be worthy to be mentioned probably said one day you're gonna sit down under a tree think about all these things you worrying stress over now you're gonna sit down under a tree and laugh one of these days brother Jack we're gonna laugh hallelujah brother alright one of these days we're gonna last together brother we're gonna be giddy we're gonna be like kids heaven I've told my grand jury said do you realize heaven is gonna be the largest youth camp of all time everybody there and the teenagers everybody there runnin skipping like lambs oh yeah oh my it was supposed to be uninterrupted but it got interrupted that's why to me the resurrection is so precious because the resurrection is so precious I want to be on this journey I want to keep going till I get there I don't want to slow down I've had too many interruptions I've had too many problems in my life where things that I knew that was not of eternal quality that was an interruption that was not life that was death I'm here to take some friends I can't get to the resurrection soon enough the resurrection again is - cause I love that determining word - cause something that had ended or been forgotten or lost to exist again to be used again Jesus says that this one that we're celebrating today who rose he said all let the Father give with me st. John 6:37 240 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and that beautiful beautiful thing see you didn't find God he wasn't lost he found you he found you when you were an enemy and your mind wasn't even capable of agreeing with him and he overtook you I want to tell you something friends when the Holy Ghost that starts chasing you you don't get away thank God well Alou you all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me this is the ones the father gave him I will in no wise in other words I will for no reason cast them out there's not a reason there's no there's nothing that his children who are known of him before the foundation of the world have ever done or could ever do to give him a reason to not accept you on that day I don't a some friends if you're the come from the genealogy if you come from the gene of Almighty God and you know you have because there's an Amen down inside of you on his word even when here doesn't understand it here says Amen even when here is angry and doesn't want to admit it there's something down in here going hey man hallelujah that ain't that guy is so loud he'll drive sleep for you he'll drive friends from you he'll get you fired off your job he'll be he'll cause you to lose all your money and all he's doing is done they're going to a man a man a man hallelujah I'm glad he yelled at me hallelujah Jesus says they'll come to me all the father's given me will come him that cometh to me I will for no reason imaginable doable under the Sun past present or future in no wise cast out why Jesus for this reason for I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the resurrection I'll raise it up again I will I will cause something that has ended or been forgotten or lost to exist again to be used again people often times when they're quoting this and I get in other passages you know wonder but John records a little bit of a difference here Jesus doesn't say people oftentimes quoted all the father that all of which he has given me I lose no one but it doesn't say I lose no one he's already said that in the 37th verse and verse 38 he's not being redundant he's not repeating himself he's already said I won't lose any people but now he's going a little further of everything that they ever were ever characteristic that was ever to be I lose nothing I don't care what kind of interruption you had I don't care what the devil took from you I don't care maybe even you're the one who gave him the keys to the house maybe you're the one that you you ruin your own self and you went along and you followed the Pied Piper you listen to the siren song and you went the way you shouldn't go and did what you shouldn't do and look at what you should have gauged that in thought and said and did and acted in ways and it ruined you and interrupted you and broke you and starred you and stained you it put marks all over your spirit and in your mind and you struggle to pray and you struggle to believe there's something in you that wants to believe but you're all hindered you're all broke up I'm here to tell you at the resurrection Jesus Christ gives it all back whatever happened whatever damage he didn't saddle most people he said these people have my characteristics everything that I ever put in them that the devil took from them I'm here to tell you when the mighty angel descended down in this hour Jesus Christ came back to restore his family and I don't care what you've lost I'm here to tell you today Jesus Christ gives it back to you now all yata raised up hands and receive it and just say I accept God's provision I accept the freedom and the healing that the word brings into my life hallelujah see everything his people were to be none of his attributes that were placed in his wife say by the fall his attributes were subject to marring and contamination but he loses nothing every attribute that God poured into Christ and then poured into his bride are completely in this hour the effect of all of that problems is canceled against you and in God's mind you are fully completely totally absolutely - an abstract title clean pure holy righteous you say I don't know Huns feel righteous if you only knew what I did yesterday I have all these thoughts I'm not talking about what you think I'm telling you what he has said I'm telling you friends if you want victory if you want strength then just fall in love with this resurrected Christ Oh New Zealand let this Easter be the Easter that you say I'm falling in love all over again I'm accepting the word that's what Easter means if it doesn't mean that to you that it's just another holiday you might as well go get on your fishing boat but it means more than a holiday to me hallelujah he's risen and doesn't he'll have been conquered and I've been liberated but in the mind of God I can never go back in God's mind it doesn't matter what interrupted me everything the Archangel came to redeem all that was in this book along with every characteristic of the word that is down inside of us everything Satan has taken from me the mighty angel came to restore they never want to they never want the groom to see the bride before he sees her coming down the aisle I'm here to taste something friends when the Lord sees this bride coming she's not gonna have all those scars she's not gonna have all those interruptions she's not gonna have all those marks that that's that's what that's what clean this means clean this clean this means free from dirt free from marks free from stains hallelujah you know I'm gonna close here for the hour you get ready just to take it back here momentarily a man and we were singing along with you guys here so we'll probably sing some more well once we turn it over to you so y'all just do what we did last night and then and then but just know that as you're worshiping and you're after service even after the feet is cut off from here we'll still be worshiping with you it's been wonderful to preach to you and I just give you this last little thing that was on my heart and I thought about how that you know any anybody who reads about streets of gold walls of Jasper anybody could want that it's not unique that you'd want that eternal life yeah eternal youth sure sign me up everybody over the age of 30 will take that one my street pavement is transparent gold that's pavement in heaven one gate is one gigantic pearl yeah every day is beautiful there's no sickness no trouble no sorrow no pain no death no parting all is peace forever more on that happy golden shore anybody would take that but I want to tell you something friends for the child of God I know it's true for me and I'm certainly not unique I'm sure it's true for every born-again child of God for me if it's a cabin at the end of a dirt road what I'm after is cleanness what I'm after is righteousness what I'm after is all the interruptions gone on I'm afters all the marks gone all the dirt is gone all the stains I got no more stains I got no more troubles nothing to hinder me I don't have to hear cussing and I don to see drinking I don't deceive Oh Garrity everywhere I look is the righteousness of the king everywhere I look nature is singing his praises that's what heaven is to the believer it's it's a it's a restoration it's a resurrection everything that I ever used to be that doesn't work anymore everything that was lost everything he's gonna cause it to be used again hallelujah whatever you ever sacrifice to the devil don't worry God's gonna cause it to be used again he's not gonna lose that gift he's not gonna lose what he puts you here for Oh Oh blessed be the name of the Lord let's stand my brother's blessed be the name of the Lord what a glorious Easter what a day Oh New Zeeland
