[58:21] Christ and we give you all the glory
[58:23] Lord amen amen
[58:26] I mean I wonder if I can ask you to take
[58:27] your seeds just for a moment I won't be
[58:29] long
[58:30] don't want to take a lot of time but
[58:32] there's some of you that I haven't seen
[58:34] yet since I returned from from Australia
[58:36] and I'm gonna say it's lovely to see you
[58:37] it's just a just a real special
[58:39] atmosphere in church this morning and
[58:41] just just thankful to be able to come to
[58:43] come together and worship together and
[58:46] serve the Lord together and
[58:49] and it's true it's lovely to see other
[58:51] parts of the body of Christ amen we we
[58:54] go through our different battles and
[58:55] things and not everyone is at the on a
[58:57] high at the same time sometimes time is
[58:59] on a low and others are on the high
[59:01] praise God that's how he works I mean I
[59:03] believe God always allows some highs and
[59:05] some lows in different places so that we
[59:08] can kind of encourage one another amen
[59:12] um I also I briefly mentioned it on
[59:14] Wednesday night I think but I want to
[59:16] also again say thank you very much to
[59:18] the brothers that's done the work in the
[59:20] in the roof
[59:22] um it's it was actually markedly less
[59:25] less Bowie when I came in the first time
[59:28] yeah of course it's still a little bit
[59:30] Bowie but but this is as good as it's
[59:32] going to get and I'm really thankful I
[59:33] tried the office door and it's still
[59:35] open and closed and things like that so
[59:38] I'm very thankful for that but thank you
[59:40] Brothers for for your effort and and I
[59:43] know
[59:49] I I saw brother Gideon become a
[59:53] structural engineer and
[59:56] do all sorts of drawings and brother
[59:59] Jonathan helped well together all sorts
[1:00:02] of mechanical structures and things and
[1:00:04] and so forth so but everyone who helped
[1:00:07] in any way thank you very much it's
[1:00:09] really good Sonia God willing the
[1:00:13] the hopefully the lights will be able to
[1:00:16] install soon so it's real nice that
[1:00:18] we'll that we'll be able to do that
[1:00:21] um apparently I I don't know if that was
[1:00:23] a joke whether it was real but I think
[1:00:25] it was real that after the the ceiling
[1:00:28] was pushed up a little bit the the
[1:00:30] projector needed adjusting again so
[1:00:31] that's a good sign
[1:00:34] so it means means that there's
[1:00:36] definitely less than less of a bow so
[1:00:38] thankful for that
[1:00:41] um I also want to ask
[1:00:44] um next Saturday
[1:00:46] um besides the fact that it's Michael's
[1:00:48] birthday we uh his mum is moving house
[1:00:52] so I wonder if there's a possibility of
[1:00:56] of some brothers that that be able to
[1:00:58] come help
[1:01:00] um and and move uh sister Louise's
[1:01:03] things what would work if we aim for
[1:01:04] nine o'clock is that too early
[1:01:07] is that two Early Brothers nine o'clock
[1:01:09] all right
[1:01:10] okay nine o'clock at sister Louise's
[1:01:12] current place and then we'll start from
[1:01:14] there and if you can bring Utes and
[1:01:16] trailers and things that would be lovely
[1:01:17] if you if you have that available if you
[1:01:20] can do that
[1:01:23] um and yes speaking of birthdays these
[1:01:26] uh these couple birthdays that's already
[1:01:28] gone but we mentioned them and I don't
[1:01:30] think either of them were here on the
[1:01:33] night that I mentioned it but James had
[1:01:34] his birthday last week sometime on the
[1:01:37] fourth
[1:01:38] and also sister Chevelle so God bless
[1:01:41] you again
[1:01:43] and then also on the 14th is Joshua
[1:01:47] Stevens there and also Simon
[1:01:50] saying God bless you both
[1:01:52] if you have a blessed day
[1:01:54] the next day on the 15th is Brooke
[1:01:56] Bailey
[1:01:57] and then as I said on on the 16th is is
[1:02:00] Michael
[1:02:02] and then on the 18th Lani maritz and
[1:02:05] then on the 19th Eden O'Connor
[1:02:08] may God bless you all I really trust
[1:02:10] that the Lord will will give you a very
[1:02:13] special day and that you will that you
[1:02:15] will experience his presence throughout
[1:02:17] the day and not only on the day but in
[1:02:19] the year to come amen that the Lord will
[1:02:21] just continue to draw you closer to him
[1:02:23] and that you will you will be aware of
[1:02:25] his love and his presence and his care
[1:02:29] I mean so now we have brother Moses it's
[1:02:31] been a while since he's ministered here
[1:02:32] in church I know the last time he
[1:02:34] ministered for us at all was at the
[1:02:36] Family Camp in 2021 so even that has
[1:02:40] been a while ago so we're just looking
[1:02:43] forward this morning I trust you come
[1:02:44] with with cups held out came in with
[1:02:47] Open Hearts and prepared hearts and that
[1:02:49] you've been praying with us and trusting
[1:02:51] that the Lord will will speak to us this
[1:02:53] morning so I'm not going to take any
[1:02:55] more time and he doesn't need any
[1:02:56] introduction it's just really privileged
[1:02:58] to to have her brother here
[1:03:00] so let's stand together and sing a song
[1:03:02] as I as I invite brother Moses to come
[1:03:05] up now

[1:13:56] says here for God hath not given us the
[1:13:59] spirit of fear
[1:14:01] but of power
[1:14:03] and of love
[1:14:05] and of a sound mind
[1:14:07] amen praise the Lord I love that
[1:14:10] sound mind
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:16] but he has given us the spirit of power
[1:14:20] Spirit of love
[1:14:22] and the sound mind amen praise the Lord
[1:14:25] I'll take her for what will be preaching
[1:14:28] this morning I will take it from the
[1:14:30] book of Exodus where we just read
[1:14:33] and I will take those words
[1:14:35] stand still amen
[1:14:37] and see the salvation of Our Lord
[1:14:40] amen praise the Lord so happy
[1:14:44] and we're so thankful to the Lord amen
[1:14:46] for him to bring USA into his house
[1:14:51] those words were spoken to Moses as we
[1:14:54] have read the
[1:14:55] children of Israel received great
[1:14:58] Deliverance
[1:15:00] from the bondage in Egypt
[1:15:06] they had seen all the plagues that have
[1:15:09] been put on the Egyptians
[1:15:12] and they were on their way
[1:15:14] and God himself was leading the children
[1:15:17] of Israel
[1:15:20] it was none other than
[1:15:21] Almighty himself leading his children
[1:15:24] amen praise the Lord
[1:15:26] and uh he led them to a place
[1:15:34] uh uh leading them into a tribe
[1:15:37] and uh
[1:15:39] indeed it was a
[1:15:42] to the natural eye
[1:15:49] they were writing a trip amen
[1:15:52] and uh
[1:15:53] the enemy was behind them
[1:15:56] and they came to that spot
[1:15:59] and then they saw the enem pursuing them
[1:16:02] amen and I think that goes very well
[1:16:06] with our Christian Life
[1:16:09] when we get saved
[1:16:11] we feel happy
[1:16:14] we are happy and we are moving with the
[1:16:16] Lord and uh
[1:16:18] everything is moving fine
[1:16:20] but at times he leads us into those uh
[1:16:24] Sports
[1:16:26] amen way everything seems to be upside
[1:16:30] down
[1:16:31] and the enemies are right on your heels
[1:16:33] and you don't even know what to do
[1:16:36] so that's when he says stand still
[1:16:41] praise the Lord that's when he says
[1:16:44] stand still
[1:16:49] when things are like that I know it's
[1:16:52] natural and that we can't play many what
[1:16:55] it's easy to really uh kind of
[1:16:59] uh being shaky and uh uh you don't know
[1:17:03] what to do
[1:17:05] that's natural
[1:17:07] but I like it when it comes in yes and
[1:17:10] he chips in and he says stand still amen
[1:17:14] and seal the salvation of Our Lord amen
[1:17:17] I like it when it's uh like that when he
[1:17:19] comes in and he gives you
[1:17:25] it's gonna be all right and when we save
[1:17:27] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:29] no matter how things are sent to be
[1:17:33] no matter how the situation is uh
[1:17:36] looking terrible yours looks like it's
[1:17:39] out of control
[1:17:42] there's one thing that just gives us a
[1:17:45] consolation
[1:17:46] that everything is gonna be all right
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:50] it can be you might be in a sickness
[1:17:55] and you might be nigh unto death
[1:17:59] everything is gonna be all right or it
[1:18:02] can be sickness
[1:18:03] and even come you you even die and we
[1:18:06] bear you
[1:18:07] everything is gonna be all right
[1:18:10] because the goodness is when the Lord is
[1:18:13] just coming and gives you that assurance
[1:18:18] that smile that crosses on your face and
[1:18:22] gives you that assurance that it's gonna
[1:18:25] be all right
[1:18:26] I've heard many sayings when they come
[1:18:28] to that point
[1:18:29] even the great uh Apostle Paul he says
[1:18:32] for me to live
[1:18:34] is Christ and for me to die I might have
[1:18:37] put those words across but you are
[1:18:40] someone who has a uh not scared of uh
[1:18:43] dying or not
[1:18:48] deliver him from there from his uh
[1:18:52] predicament but he knew either way
[1:18:55] God is going to be in it and either way
[1:18:58] he's gonna come out right amen praise
[1:19:02] the Lord I always wonder I don't I see a
[1:19:06] mystery to me and I think it is a
[1:19:09] mystery to you as well
[1:19:10] we all talk about heaven it's a
[1:19:13] beautiful place and we all want to go
[1:19:18] means for us now to cross over to go to
[1:19:21] heaven comes
[1:19:23] nobody wants to go home amen but it's a
[1:19:26] beautiful place
[1:19:27] I don't understand
[1:19:29] we are human beings are things that's
[1:19:31] just the way we are made amen we don't
[1:19:34] understand this beautiful place here at
[1:19:37] times we when that call comes that we
[1:19:41] we are scared and uh we don't want to go
[1:19:44] home to the extent that I think even the
[1:19:46] Lord Jesus Christ you post it as well
[1:19:50] when uh his friend Lazarus died
[1:19:53] the Lord Jesus Christ you know Lazarus
[1:19:55] was a righteous man and Lazarus has gone
[1:19:58] up to to heaven
[1:20:00] but we find him when he comes
[1:20:02] he weeps for his friend
[1:20:05] why was he weeping when his friend has
[1:20:07] just gone to a beautiful place
[1:20:09] we don't understand it it's one of those
[1:20:12] Mysteries there he's going to a good
[1:20:15] place but you you you're crying and then
[1:20:17] you have to bring him back amen so we
[1:20:19] don't understand that some of these
[1:20:21] things when we are putting uh those are
[1:20:23] difficult positions
[1:20:25] and one thing that I would want to say
[1:20:28] that we are human beings
[1:20:30] and when you are in those corners
[1:20:33] uh
[1:20:34] uh when things are tough and when things
[1:20:37] are not moving right
[1:20:40] uh
[1:20:42] it's no time to feel our self-pity
[1:20:46] you might find yourself
[1:20:49] in self-pity
[1:20:51] but it's not a time to dwell and uh
[1:20:56] start thinking oh poor me what has
[1:20:58] happened to me or I'm such a horrible
[1:21:01] person for these things to happen to me
[1:21:04] it's not time to think that amen
[1:21:07] it's time to lift up your eyes
[1:21:09] unto the Lord and see the salvation of
[1:21:12] Our Lord amen praise the lord it's time
[1:21:15] to look up to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:18] and see
[1:21:20] what good is going to come out of this
[1:21:23] praise the Lord because no matter how
[1:21:26] bad the situation is
[1:21:28] you are a chosen vessel amen you are a
[1:21:33] chosen of Jehovah God Amen so no matter
[1:21:36] whatever situation you are in whatever
[1:21:39] uh condition you are battling
[1:21:42] be very assured of this Fear One Thing
[1:21:46] about everything is gonna be all right
[1:21:49] everything is gonna work out right and
[1:21:53] everything eventually things will come
[1:21:56] out right amen praise the Lord I can put
[1:21:59] it in this way you will have the last
[1:22:01] love against the devil for amen praise
[1:22:03] the Lord amen you will have the last
[1:22:06] laugh when he thinks that he has really
[1:22:08] pinned you down and you you you you die
[1:22:13] you'll be saying farewell I'm going to
[1:22:16] my beautiful home amen praise the Lord

[1:23:51] he knew exactly where to go to
[1:23:54] and he went to the to God himself amen
[1:23:58] and God said
[1:24:00] stand still
[1:24:02] so if your children

[1:24:15] boys were
[1:24:17] not doing right and she wanted the
[1:24:20] children back to save the Lord
[1:24:23] and problem said

[1:24:50] love them don't neck them
[1:24:52] and you pray
[1:24:55] you pray
[1:24:56] they'll come back
[1:24:59] they'll come back
[1:25:01] because it's a promise amen we are not a
[1:25:03] whatever praise the Lord
[1:25:06] probably uh
[1:25:08] husband is picking his bags
[1:25:12] I'm out of this place
[1:25:15] you pray
[1:25:19] yeah there are situations where brother
[1:25:21] Brahma maida the husband was speaking uh
[1:25:28] they would come to the prophet and the
[1:25:31] prophet says Beckham
[1:25:33] what uh the best cake that he loves amen
[1:25:37] and they do
[1:25:39] they are not a whatever
[1:25:43] people no we are Christians amen and we
[1:25:47] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ amen we
[1:25:50] want to be a true ambassadors
[1:25:54] for this gospel it says
[1:26:00] and it's despised the way it is today
[1:26:03] and people make fun of it and he says
[1:26:05] it's because of poor representation amen
[1:26:09] but we as Believers amen as Believers we
[1:26:14] have been called that in these end times
[1:26:18] praise the Lord and we have been
[1:26:20] restored back to the original faith
[1:26:23] we want to put that to a stop
[1:26:26] we want to live such a life
[1:26:29] until in this region there when they say
[1:26:32] when they want to see a living God
[1:26:35] they will say God Rapture in Christ
[1:26:38] and they will say you want God go to
[1:26:41] that place
[1:26:43] I like
[1:26:45] what brother brother was you're at one
[1:26:47] time he was tested
[1:26:54] kind of talks they're criticizing my
[1:26:57] Ministry and everything but one thing
[1:26:59] that they
[1:27:03] if I it's true
[1:27:05] it's genuine and that that it's true
[1:27:09] they have no questions about it they
[1:27:11] know it's true and they testify and they
[1:27:14] somehow they think here they are saying
[1:27:16] I've got a genuine gift and I'm deceived
[1:27:19] and he says but I don't see where I'm
[1:27:22] deceived
[1:27:23] so we want to come to that spot
[1:27:26] when the world wants to see
[1:27:28] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:30] when the world wants to see true
[1:27:32] Christianity
[1:27:34] they see it in rupturing Grace amen are
[1:27:37] they so you see through Christianity
[1:27:39] Bible Believers amen they see true
[1:27:43] Christianity in you amen so we say
[1:27:46] stand still
[1:27:50] don't give up

[1:29:09] whom we are worshiping amen praise the
[1:29:12] lord it's not an imaginary God

[1:29:24] kids when they are distressed and they
[1:29:25] start sucking

[1:29:47] nah
[1:29:48] it doesn't make mistakes
[1:29:51] no
[1:29:52] and he doesn't have a time where he has
[1:29:55] to say uh well I'm sorry I got it wrong
[1:29:58] the first time I will get it right this
[1:30:01] time
[1:30:01] no it doesn't do that
[1:30:04] praise the Lord whatever he does
[1:30:06] it's perfect
[1:30:08] whatever it does is good
[1:30:12] is the source of our light
[1:30:15] is a source of warmth
[1:30:18] that's right
[1:30:20] yeah coldness is from the Devil
[1:30:22] is a source of warmth

[1:30:57] he will come in your situation you'll
[1:30:59] come and help you out
[1:31:02] praise the Lord and now uh
[1:31:05] there are some tricks that we are taught
[1:31:07] by Malachi for
[1:31:09] brother pranam
[1:31:11] taught us those are tricks at times some
[1:31:13] of some of those things uh
[1:31:17] they may look very like they are very
[1:31:21] small or we we really can't put value on
[1:31:26] them but they're the real things
[1:31:28] that hold the thing together
[1:31:33] praise the Lord
[1:31:34] very small things that you've taught us
[1:31:37] Malachi for amen so you're staying still
[1:31:40] and now we're saying when you are now
[1:31:42] standing still
[1:31:44] in your position it might be lingering
[1:31:47] it might be dragging and taking years
[1:31:50] and uh
[1:31:51] I don't know how whatever it is
[1:31:55] just stand still
[1:31:59] praise the Lord
[1:32:00] stand
[1:32:02] still
[1:32:03] and see the salvation of our Lord and
[1:32:06] now when you are standing still just
[1:32:08] understand still there and uh not doing
[1:32:11] nothing
[1:32:12] start praising the Lord
[1:32:15] start reading that spoken word
[1:32:17] start reading that Bible
[1:32:20] praise the Lord
[1:32:22] and don't forget to come and fellowship
[1:32:25] together
[1:32:26] that's very important now you come your
[1:32:30] fellowship together praise the Lord
[1:32:33] because that's where you get a little
[1:32:35] bit of a big boost here
[1:32:38] yes that's where you get a big boss
[1:32:41] when these children of Israel we are
[1:32:44] talking about when they came out of
[1:32:46] Egypt they knew this great God was
[1:32:49] before them
[1:32:51] they knew this great God we had really
[1:32:53] destroyed all Egypt and paralyzed it
[1:32:56] they knew him
[1:32:58] and then you hear him when I further
[1:33:00] down there you open the Red Sea for them
[1:33:02] and they crossed over
[1:33:04] yeah and when they came to Mount Sinai I
[1:33:07] saw him he was thundering on that uh uh
[1:33:11] Mount Sinai it was on smoke thundering
[1:33:14] and everything
[1:33:16] and they were saying my
[1:33:18] what a great being
[1:33:20] I wonder if he will go all the way with
[1:33:24] us and dwell with us in our promised
[1:33:26] light
[1:33:31] thought that
[1:33:33] and probably some way we could have
[1:33:36] thought it they said we want him to come
[1:33:38] and dwell amongst us
[1:33:40] and one day there was great news
[1:33:43] Moses he went up the mountain and he
[1:33:46] came down and he says Israel I bring you
[1:33:49] good news
[1:33:50] the one who's standing on that mountain
[1:33:52] the one was producing all those
[1:33:55] Lightnings and everything he says he
[1:33:57] want to dwell amongst us and he says we
[1:33:59] can build him a tabernacle and he will
[1:34:02] come and dwell amongst us
[1:34:04] that was good news
[1:34:06] and Israel says yes we'll do that and
[1:34:08] they build a tabernacle
[1:34:10] but you know what the best news of all
[1:34:13] is
[1:34:14] in US
[1:34:16] he never chose to to dwell in a
[1:34:18] tabernacle but he chose to dwell in our
[1:34:22] hearts
[1:34:23] he is right in your heart
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:29] you may not feel him
[1:34:31] he may not understand it
[1:34:34] but the minute you accepted him amen the
[1:34:37] minute you received that baptism of the
[1:34:40] Holy Ghost
[1:34:41] says that it was like a little size of a
[1:34:45] pattern
[1:34:46] something was planted right into your
[1:34:49] into your heart amen and it's still
[1:34:52] there amen and you have to water it here
[1:34:55] for it to grow
[1:34:56] water it for it to grow
[1:34:58] praise the Lord and
[1:35:00] when you come to church
[1:35:02] praise the Lord you bring your leg of
[1:35:04] fire they bring a leak of fire together
[1:35:07] you get the encouragement
[1:35:09] praise the Lord amen so with those
[1:35:13] little nuggets that are prophet of
[1:35:15] Malachi for taught us amen I think we
[1:35:19] will be restored and I believe we'll go
[1:35:22] back to that
[1:35:24] original amen
[1:35:27] like Pentecost was amen praise the Lord
[1:35:30] raising the Dead
[1:35:32] no it's not wishful thinking it's truth
[1:35:36] raising the Dead the blind seeing praise
[1:35:40] the Lord
[1:35:41] they will have to take them from the
[1:35:44] hospital they say we can't have your
[1:35:47] situation my friend we can't do medical
[1:35:49] science can't do anything
[1:35:51] but I'll tell you one thing if you go in
[1:35:54] Stratford
[1:35:55] on Reagan Street
[1:35:58] there are some people there we don't
[1:36:00] understand them but
[1:36:02] they if they pray for you
[1:36:05] your eyesight will be restored
[1:36:08] praise the Lord if they pray for you
[1:36:10] your limbs will be straightened amen
[1:36:13] that's not wish for thinking amen that's
[1:36:16] what the Bible talks about as amen and
[1:36:18] that's what all those things are we have
[1:36:22] gone on uh they are looking forward for
[1:36:24] us to do that amen praise the Lord and
[1:36:27] that's what all the animals there the
[1:36:29] whole creation is groaning for to see
[1:36:31] the manifested manifestation of the sons
[1:36:34] of God Amen the world creation is
[1:36:36] looking upon us amen praise the Lord and
[1:36:40] uh that was what what Daniel saw he said
[1:36:42] that when he saw it he said that uh
[1:36:45] those who love their God shall do
[1:36:47] exploits and wonders praise the Lord and
[1:36:50] we happen to be
[1:36:52] that group of people amen so we say
[1:36:55] stand still
[1:36:56] and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:36:59] you're sent there you pray amen
[1:37:03] hold on to him
[1:37:04] praise the Lord and now we we're talking
[1:37:07] about now the conditions now you are
[1:37:09] standing still
[1:37:11] standing and waiting for him to act
[1:37:14] there are some things now that you must
[1:37:16] do praise the Lord
[1:37:19] reading the Bible
[1:37:21] and now we're putting their nuggets that
[1:37:23] brother tells us about here
[1:37:25] praise the Lord when you are standing
[1:37:27] still
[1:37:28] attitude met us a lot
[1:37:31] your attitude towards these promises
[1:37:35] made us a lot amen praise the Lord don't
[1:37:37] give up
[1:37:39] keep holding on Amen praise the Lord
[1:37:41] I'll read what the prophet says in
[1:37:44] expectation that was preaching 50-0405
[1:37:50] on paragraph 13.
[1:37:52] and he says just for a little text if I
[1:37:56] should call it that
[1:37:58] I want to speak for a moment or two on
[1:38:01] the word of expectation
[1:38:03] and he says we always get what we expect
[1:38:11] when people expect anything well then
[1:38:15] they usually get what you look for
[1:38:18] and he says it's the mental attitude
[1:38:21] that you have amen praise the Lord
[1:38:25] I'll try to die myself
[1:38:29] saying that I'm Healed
[1:38:32] and yet I'm dying I would rather die
[1:38:34] confessing that rather than giving up
[1:38:37] because I know God doesn't lie amen
[1:38:40] praise the Lord amen I know he doesn't
[1:38:42] like amen I would rather die that way
[1:38:44] than giving up
[1:38:47] I may not see uh well I may not see all
[1:38:52] my loved ones my mama my my my uncles
[1:38:55] and them coming to the Lord but as long
[1:38:57] as I've put them there I've claimed them
[1:38:59] they're my sisters as long as I've
[1:39:01] claimed them they I know they will come
[1:39:04] I don't want that to fizzle out amen
[1:39:07] praise the Lord amen
[1:39:09] says he says it's the mental attitude
[1:39:11] that we have
[1:39:13] remember this and never forget it
[1:39:16] that's problem says remember this and
[1:39:20] never forget it
[1:39:22] he says that the right mental attitude
[1:39:26] towards any promise of God
[1:39:30] will bring it to pass
[1:39:32] so just the right mental attitude
[1:39:34] towards those promises he says or to
[1:39:37] bring it past amen he says the right
[1:39:39] mental attitude towards any uh Promises
[1:39:43] of God
[1:39:44] and he says it doesn't take Gifts of
[1:39:46] healing to heal sick people
[1:39:49] any person in here is a right to meet
[1:39:52] certain anyway
[1:39:55] if you are a Christian
[1:39:57] and defeat him on any grounds that he
[1:40:02] could stand on
[1:40:03] praise the Lord so even
[1:40:06] you're washing your dishes
[1:40:09] you can't defeat the Devil right then
[1:40:11] praise the Lord you're driving on the
[1:40:13] road
[1:40:14] you can then defeat the Devil right
[1:40:16] there you are working busy at your
[1:40:18] workplace your defeat him amen praise
[1:40:21] the Lord and I like it when God at times
[1:40:25] you know the way he does it at times
[1:40:27] it's not by power
[1:40:29] not by mighty
[1:40:31] but by his spirit
[1:40:33] he just does it
[1:40:35] praise the Lord he just does it the
[1:40:39] situation that has been bothering you
[1:40:41] for for so long a Time
[1:40:44] one day you will find and you wake up

[1:40:54] anymore

[1:40:58] pain anymore and it looks like it's been
[1:41:01] four four four four weeks now since I
[1:41:03] last I felt it

[1:41:07] comes in uh quietly and he does the job
[1:41:10] quietly and he goes
[1:41:12] and at times some of the the situations
[1:41:14] you only get to see it way way way way
[1:41:17] after
[1:41:19] but he does it all the same amen that
[1:41:22] right mental attitude towards any
[1:41:25] promises of God praise the lord we want
[1:41:28] to keep on holding on the burner lifting

[1:41:50] praising the Lord and worshiping him
[1:41:54] simple it's not complicated at times
[1:41:57] it's men will try to make it very
[1:41:59] complicated
[1:42:01] times that people try to make the
[1:42:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost very
[1:42:05] complicated
[1:42:07] just read your Bible read your spoken
[1:42:10] word he comes in and he does it
[1:42:13] amen easy praise the Lord

[1:42:20] you don't struggle to breathe
[1:42:23] when you struggle to breathe there's
[1:42:25] something wrong there

[1:57:58] when he's dealing with us
[1:58:00] it doesn't sort of like I show us the
[1:58:03] whole plan right from the beginning
[1:58:04] right to the end
[1:58:06] times it's always
[1:58:08] step
[1:58:09] by step
[1:58:11] step
[1:58:12] by step
[1:58:14] you finish this one you overcome this
[1:58:16] one another one is coming
[1:58:19] you overcome that one another one very
[1:58:22] tricky will be coming
[1:58:24] and you overcome this one another one
[1:58:27] may be a bit simpler now to give you a
[1:58:30] little bit of rest is coming
[1:58:33] but it's always
[1:58:35] we are on our way up what is we go with
[1:58:38] him amen praise the Lord and he says
[1:58:41] when Jesus was here on Earth the father
[1:58:43] was in him God was in I was in Christ
[1:58:47] reconciling the world to himself
[1:58:49] and he says we believe that
[1:58:51] all the fine qualities was of the father
[1:58:56] was in him
[1:58:58] but when he met Satan
[1:59:01] look how he did
[1:59:03] he brought it in your reach
[1:59:07] and yours yours and all of you
[1:59:13] you never use great Powers when the
[1:59:15] devil was coming and tempting to him no
[1:59:18] no brother pranam says he brought it to
[1:59:20] your level
[1:59:21] he brought it to Summer
[1:59:24] on very simple terms
[1:59:27] and that's the principle of God problem
[1:59:30] says God and we all know it it is so
[1:59:34] simple
[1:59:36] and people they
[1:59:37] stubble over him they jump over him they
[1:59:40] are looking over for him over there yet
[1:59:42] he's right here
[1:59:44] he makes it very simple
[1:59:46] so that even the littlest one can catch
[1:59:50] it
[1:59:51] so that even the the the the the the
[1:59:53] foolish ones they can catch it he makes
[1:59:56] it very simple so that's what problem he
[1:59:58] says here he says the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:00] he gave us that example
[2:00:02] it was very uh a simple example
[2:00:06] of how to deal with the Devil
[2:00:09] he never used his great gift when Satan
[2:00:11] comes in and said if thou be the Son of
[2:00:13] God turn these stones to bread
[2:00:16] he said it is written
[2:00:22] praise the lord it's always a written

[2:00:43] praise the Lord it is written
[2:00:46] whatever situation it is written and he
[2:00:50] says men shall not live by bread alone
[2:00:53] he taken him up on the Pinnacle of the
[2:00:56] temple Jesus said it is written you took
[2:00:58] him up on a map on a high mountain
[2:01:00] showed him the kingdoms of the world
[2:01:03] said I will give them all to you

[2:10:21] very true
[2:10:23] your offerings in the Bible it says
[2:10:26] they are robbing me because they are not
[2:10:28] paying their tithes
[2:10:29] well we don't force you

[2:10:50] you here
[2:10:52] some of these things it's a process
[2:10:55] yeah it goes slowly slowly slowly slowly
[2:10:59] and with time you find ah

[2:18:12] and I trust you
[2:18:15] and program says it seems strange
[2:18:18] when a person
[2:18:21] has done all they can do
[2:18:24] that they fulfilled every request that
[2:18:27] God has asked them to do
[2:18:30] and still
[2:18:32] he is silent
[2:18:34] yeah there are times like that when it's
[2:18:36] just silent
[2:18:38] he is real
[2:18:40] very very yeah
[2:18:45] but at times it's just
[2:18:47] silent
[2:18:51] just silent and at times that silent
[2:18:55] when God tells he doesn't give you a
[2:18:59] half taste oh he gives it a maximum
[2:19:03] yeah when he really does it closes his
[2:19:06] eyes
[2:19:09] and if you pass it he knows
[2:19:11] it's a genuine one
[2:19:15] genuine one
[2:19:18] yeah
[2:19:20] those who are his
[2:19:22] they always
[2:19:23] stand that test
[2:19:25] it's an ultimate test
[2:19:29] ultimate this stand still
[2:19:33] and see the salvation of the Lord
[2:19:36] oh I see almost a Breaking Point
[2:19:40] stand seal and see the salvation of the
[2:19:43] Lord
[2:19:44] and at times it even breaks
[2:19:47] drop
[2:19:51] before it hits the grounds
[2:19:53] he picks it up
[2:19:55] that's his promise before it hits the
[2:19:59] ground he picks it up
[2:20:03] and I'll be smiling to you he says
[2:20:07] see
[2:20:09] I am Jehovah God
[2:20:12] when he met the prophet on that mountain
[2:20:13] that hurricane is coming
[2:20:16] he says go back
[2:20:18] I'm the one who created the winds and
[2:20:20] everything you go back
[2:20:25] and you just to do what God was asking
[2:20:27] him to do
[2:20:29] and he says speak and it speaks
[2:20:35] when you have passed that out mid taste
[2:20:39] yeah
[2:20:41] God will say that no we can't refuse him
[2:20:46] our genuine character we can't refuse in
[2:20:49] our deep Fellowship
[2:20:54] he's one of us
[2:20:57] coming
[2:21:00] praise the Lord
[2:21:01] don't give up
[2:21:04] I love you just the same and I trust you
[2:21:07] it seems strange when a person has done
[2:21:10] all that they can do that they have
[2:21:12] fulfilled every request that God has
[2:21:14] asked them to do and still be silent
[2:21:19] when you've done
[2:21:20] all that God has requested you to do
[2:21:24] and still he is silent
[2:21:27] just be sure
[2:21:29] that you know God
[2:21:32] and remember faith is silently
[2:21:35] waiting
[2:21:37] he is only testing
[2:21:40] your faith
[2:21:41] to see what you will do
[2:21:48] a brother misbehaves
[2:21:51] is testing to see what he will do
[2:21:55] you pray for them
[2:21:59] you pray for that don't say ah separate
[2:22:01] seed good readings now
[2:22:04] you'll pray
[2:22:06] he wants to see your reaction he'll pray
[2:22:08] for them yeah yeah exercise that face
[2:22:11] yeah at times it's if they have grown to
[2:22:13] your times it's difficult to pray for
[2:22:15] them pray with their Grudge
[2:22:19] really biting your hair
[2:22:23] you win that one it gives you another
[2:22:25] one
[2:22:26] yeah

[2:22:35] praise the Lord and you come to his
[2:22:37] perfection
[2:22:39] hallelujah amen and I like this uh that
[2:22:42] Brahm says he says God
[2:22:45] is not known by knowledge
[2:22:48] but is known by faith
[2:22:50] because the Devils they know him by
[2:22:52] knowledge yeah the devil knows there's
[2:22:54] God he knows him by knowledge but he
[2:22:56] doesn't know him by faith
[2:22:59] faith
[2:23:01] is what makes God move amen it's not by
[2:23:04] faith and faith alone is the only way
[2:23:07] you will know God
[2:23:08] and this works are the acts of faith
[2:23:12] in the stage of a perfect man he says
[2:23:14] that knowledge is there is that
[2:23:16] knowledge not just the knowledge of
[2:23:18] knowing that the scriptures but the
[2:23:20] knowledge of knowing that God will keep
[2:23:24] that which he has promised me
[2:23:30] not for trust not for Assurance and I
[2:23:33] believe
[2:23:34] that's where we are coming to amen
[2:23:37] praise the Lord and he says if you find
[2:23:40] faith
[2:23:42] faith is always accompanied
[2:23:45] with love
[2:23:48] they are great friends
[2:23:50] faith and love
[2:23:52] move hand in hand
[2:23:54] faith and love amen so if that faith
