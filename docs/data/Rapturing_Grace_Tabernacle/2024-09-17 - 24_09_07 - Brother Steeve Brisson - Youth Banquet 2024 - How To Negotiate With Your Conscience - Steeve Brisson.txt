TRANSCRIPT
========================================
right God bless you all it's be privileged to be back again tonight you all looking good all pumped up and shiny amen so we um going to share the word of God tonight um we're going to turn in our Bible you might not have your Bible tonight but we will uh read a scripture in Acts uh chapter 24 verse 16 I got a different version here on the screen um it's from a different version more like a simplified English King James is I'm French so King James Sometimes is a bit difficult it's all English it's a bit uh difficult to understand so some of the some of the slides tonight is going to be of a more simplified version I wanted to make sure that it kept the the good meaning uh because you know we believe the J King James is accurate so we going to read from verse 16 and Ain do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense offense towards God and toward men let's bow ahead Lord Jesus we want to thank you tonight we are gathered we had we have good fellowship and we had good food and certainly we want to put it this time aside Lord for the spiritual food turning our eyes towards you waiting upon you for you to speak to our hearts we want to pause Lord this evening and to stop everything we're doing to wait upon you Lord we ask you to take control over every Spirit of our over our mind my thoughts everything that I am I want to surrender to myself to you tonight so you can have the freedom to move through me through your people so that we get closer to you and have a greater understanding Lord free Us by your truth tonight we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated so tonight I want to speak on how do you negotiate with your conscience maybe a peculiar topic but I want to introduce this topic um just to give you maybe a background where I come from with this topic I was uh when I was 2 years old my mom gave her gave her life to the Lord so I was raised in church like most of you and been raising church you've uh have your conscience shaped by a Christian environment Christian parents church you've been to and now today I'm 47 I had five children so I've I've been raised by a mother then I've became a minister became a pastor raised my my own children saw the effect of raising children in a certain Manner and it really inspired me to make this study that we going to do together tonight as a little journey and so for me the conscience always been a little bit something that I did not understand well and I pray tonight that through the study of this topic it may help maybe someone to be able to navigate and to understand what's the conscience what's the use of that and how God wants to use it because if God send it it's for us it has a meaning so we want maybe to better understand that so we've read the acts and I want also want to read in 1 Timothy chapter 3 Paul is says holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience obviously here he's talking about church officers that you know they must not be Liars heavy drinkers but I think that all all of us we have to be uh uh in pure conscience we don't have have something that we are bearing that that that it's you know when we have a heavy conscience when we feel guilty about something and so it's something that we want to understand tonight so before we go along with the subject we want may maybe want to understand how where where that comes from and how it was shaped how was your conscience was shaped so as a young child you know a young child does not know at first whether is gestures are wrong are right or wrong it is the reaction of the people around him that allows him to know so basically when you were a kid you didn't know what was right what was wrong so you have to look to your parents to see if what you're doing was right or it was wrong right and so you know you wanted a toy and you slap your sister to get the toy and then mommy's around and says no no don't do that he like what's wrong I want the toy and then you learn that you know there's there's things that are good and and things that are are are wrong but you know moral conscience represent a person ability to consider the views of others before acting true moral awareness a person is able to assess the consequences of their actions on others and understand whether that they are what they are doing is right or wrong the moral conscience therefore makes it possible to J judge what behaviors are acceptable or not we're just starting with really really basic stuff here a child's morals conscience develop little by little as observes the reaction of adults to the action he takes this awareness also sets in as he develops his social skills and learns to take into account what others are feeling it is it is thanks to moral awareness that a child learns to control himself and that he becomes aware of the responsibility of his action it is therefore essential to live well with others however a child's moral conscience is not fully acquired until the age of seven of or eight where where we we say that it's the Age of Reason where you start to realize for yourself that's why obviously sometime you know it's around 7 8 9 10 year old sometime that you have a a child has been raised in church and suddenly he realized he's a sinner he realized he's a sinner and he wants to serve the Lord and remember at 8-year-old that's a decision I took my wife was a similar age 8year old she gave her life to the Lord got baptized I got baptized at 8-y old because something came on me and I wanted and something came inside of me it's like I want to be a Christian before that I I didn't have that awareness I was just you know with my mother and everything was okay but when that awareness when when your conscience is being developed and even my children some of them that awareness came at at an early age look it's the age of of Reason where your conscience is being shaped but you need others to do that you know even in the in the so those who sell puppies you know they raise dogs they breed dogs they sell puppies there's there's I don't remember what age but if you take a you buy a puppy way too early you know what he's doing he bites and and and and the reason is is that he has to grow a couple of months or this couple of weeks I don't remember the exact date but the principle is that you have he has to stay with his sibling and his mother because that's where he's going to learn that bite biting hurts because when he bites his sister or he bites his his his his brother they they yell and then they learn oh okay I got teeth and and if I and if I bite it hurts and so they said say that if even when you buy want to buy a puppy you don't buy it too early because there is a raising there's an awareness in their own language there's stuff they need to learn so imagine if we have that with dogs what about us right and so for example your toddler understand that it's wrong to hit the sister because you intervene and learns that it's nice to let him toys or give him a hug because you Praise Him however because your child is still has little self-control it is still open the case that if that is or her impulse are greater than his or her fear of being punished so at one point it becomes a balance into how much pleasure than I can get out of this and what's the level of pain with the punishment and you want to balance it out right you know you have some children sometime that you know they want something so bad they're not afraid of the punishment because their conscience is all only shape in a matter of it's not right or wrong is is how much I want it okay so the Bible is clear with that that the Bible says that wherefore ye must need be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake so the Bible says that we should be able to subject and obey the word of God not by fear of being punished but because we have a conscience that tells us that this is is wrong now but the conscience as we made a quick thought here our conscience has been shaped by the environment we've been raised in some of you have been raised by parents that it's really strict they live in a small box other have been raised in a family where the box is is is bigger and and that your parents have been influenced where with their background how strict their parents was or maybe in what church they were or church is really really strict a lot of rules a lot of spying on each other you know this brother this this so so and the pastor come the deacons calls you and everything is so strict people live in a small box everything is wrong everything is a sin you got other people that you know they don't have a conscience as much it's like the box is box is way too bigger and you want to judge if some somebody has been um raised too strict you and maybe some of you will remember but you want to see if if your a child has been under way too much pressure is if they spill a glass of water at the table they spill a glass of water at the table and they start crying if you have that is that that that kid's been raised under way too much pressure and that in spilling the glass of water something inside of him breaks down and he start crying because he realized this is a fatal mistake and if you have that kind of reaction it it should tell you even you're going to raise kids later if your kids do that you putting way too much pressure on him because you know uh uh to spill a glass of water is not the end of the world all right so the reaction should be you know oops you know you're not start crying it should be oops you know I need a towel and I will I will clean that quickly right so there he's not falling apart inside but he considered that oops you know I I I will fix this but I can move on okay and then you got this other one that you know spills it and he think it's funny spills a glass of water and it is like that's not a big deal and everybody's like well do something about it right you just feel like it's not the end of the world but you know this is a mistake and you should to be you should be doing something about the mistake you did to fix it because it is a mistake right and then you got this kid who spills you know tons of glass of water and for him it's fun because he lives in a world where nothing matters so maybe in this room we have those four different kids that one that's put way too much on his shoulder and the other the other one like nothing bothers and so it's really important how we've been raised but our conscience is being shaped by the way we've been raised now when we are Christians sometime we wonder is my conscience is is it the word of God or is it God or the conscience is a self dialogue kind of a conversation you have with yourself about what's wrong and what's right right so we want to study that tonight because sometime it can be confusing it was confusing for me I was raised in a really really tight and strict environment way too tight way too strict and is it it has damaged me in a sense that when you've been raised in such a strict environment you live in a small box and in a small box there's no Oxygen I can tell you my testimony I was raised so so so tight that when I was 16 my mom backslid I was just raised with my mother no sibling no father so I was just living with my mother and usually you know teenagers again made me have some rough time and they run away from home in my situation it was the contrary my mom had some rough time and she left the house back slid and went to live with a man and I ended up at 16 by myself when that happened I said you know I'll keep going to church CU I'm I'm not going to church because of my mother I'm going to church because I want to save the Lord serve the Lord that's what I thought that's what I wanted but you know what happened when we live in a such a tight environment we're never able to take decision for ourself and so we don't know exactly what we think we don't know exactly what we believe because there's always someone that intervene before we are able to face our own decision most of you you know you're teenagers we have adults here and that's a transition it should be a healthy transition when we become a teenager as we move adult into adulthood where or the parents you know they slowly backed off and let you take some of the decision what happened with me is I went from full control to No Control at all yeah so guess what happened within a year I was in jail I ended up in police station sleeping there sleeping there because of a robbery a failed one praise the Lord my career didn't last really long and know I got arrested and then the judge asked for a evaluation you know psychological evaluation of this young boy 18-year-old that just con committed a robbery so I was interviewed by a psychologist and he asked me all kind of question interview my mother and you know what was the report at the end this young man was raised in such a tight environment and overnight he became free and couldn't handle that freedom because I went from totally control and so I was living in the box of my mother but I didn't have any myself I didn't have any cons I lost it because I was I became drunk on freedom freedom yeah so-called Freedom sometime this happen when a teenager gets a car and suddenly he can escape or he's get a moped how you call this a scooter a moped how do you call that you got this here New Zealand you get a moped back in Quebec Canada you get a moped at 14 Freedom you can go much further than a petson so you get a car and suddenly the parents are kind of panicking a little bit okay you got your car but now you know time out you got to come back home at this and and they try to help you budget and manage this new acquired freedom because we can be get drunk on freedom where suddenly we realize finally there's no limits and when you have that feeling you're proving yourself that you were living under the conscience of your parents which is perfectly normal because the Bible says obey your parents so obey your parents means obey they conscience their conscience because it's not just about the word of God because there's many things in the rule it's not in the word of God like you know when it's the time to have a meal everybody sits at the table when we're finished I want you to take your plate and bring it to the counter that's not the word of God that's what your parents is asking based on what they think is proper are you with me and so you follow the in the Bible God is asking you to follow along that line because you got to live with the box of your parents but we we have to be able to transition into try to find out what do I believe so sometime we I have thought maybe for years and sometime we think that we all have the same conscience but we don't have all the same conscience the Bible says that some people believe this and some people believe that and Paul is not trying to say that we should have all the same conscience but the Bible says that we should respect each other's conscience you got that in first Corinthians chapter 8:7 not and it's a modern version but it says the same thing but in easier English not everyone knows these things in fact many people this is talking about eating Uh u a meat that's been sacrificed to Idols it used to be a big topic it is not anymore but just to give you an example not everyone knows these things in fact many people have grown up with the belief that Idols have life in them so when they eat meat offered to Idols they are bought bed by a weak conscience but food doesn't bring us any closer to God we are wor we are no worst off if we don't eat and we are no better off if we do so the Bible says that there you know they've been grown up with a belief you know so they've grown up with a conscience that when if they if they eat you know meat that was sacrificed in satanic temple they felt in their heart in their conscience that they would be defiled and they couldn't do it but others they say you know that's not a big deal Idols are nothing so that meat is not corrupt meat is meat and so Paul is not saying we should all believe the same but Paul say you should respect your brother or your sister's conscience that is weaker so that means that we don't have the same conscience and the Bible is not trying to press Us in that we should all be the same but we should respect each other don't cause problem for someone with a weak conscience just because you have the right to eat anything you know all this and so it doesn't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol but suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that food that has been offered to Idols then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for when you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience you sin against Christ for many years people in church have tried to have everybody doing exactly the same thing and having the exact same standard and that was a mistake because that's not what the bible teach and I'm not talking about well I want to kill someone and you don't feel like doing it so you know you should respect me I'm not talking about clearcut word of God there's many great areas that people are tried to enforce on other people that's right I remember when I was young in church there was a brother going around it's telling you if you have a baseball cap with a sign or a shirt with a trademark he said that that we that these were idols and and and that we should not have any trademark he was trying to tell everybody that this was wrong or another brother if you had glasses that were a little bit mirror that was hypocrite cuz you're hiding your highs and and so well if you believe that it's good for you but you cannot enforce that on everybody you're with me because the Bible says we have different conscience now some of you here are young enough that you still have to obey because you'll be blessed by obeying your parents even though you know my my kids are old enough as I said I'm preaching this and I have a h not a full cycle but I like I have my own experience and I have my experience of me raising children and seeing them having discussion with me about you know Dad he like you know you're kind of strict on this or or and and at one point I had to realize that you know some of the thing as they grw up and they become adults they have to make their own decision what do you believe about that it's like Jesus asked his disciple who do you say that I am I can enforce the fact that I'm the Son of God but but Jesus wanted to know what do you believe and the first answer is well well those people are saying this those people are saying that Jesus that's not what I I'm not asking you what the church is saying I'm asking you what you believe so he wanted to see where they were at and so when my mom left at 16 you would have asked me was I ready like I'm I'm good I'm good but I was not good I was not ready to face life on my own because I was not trained to take decision Paul is is talking in Romans 14 that one man esteem it one day above another another esteemed every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in in his own mind Paul says he that regarded the day regarded unto the Lord he that regarded not the day to the Lord he that not regard it he that eat it eat it to the Lord so basically he's saying if you're a Christian and you do something that you are fully persuaded you're doing it for the Lord but you cannot ask somebody else to do the same thing because Paul is not saying here that we are everybody's going to be alike Paul is saying that you have to respect the one that has a higher standard for something and this other one doesn't consider this as as as to give it give it the same importance now let give me you a let me give you a modern example let's say you got you have a guy that was in the world and when he was in the world he was lifting weight he was Mr Universe right taking protein and powder and all pumped up and that was his that was his life he was doing competition he was you know he was you know big muscle you know he knows everything about lifting weights and all that and then God calls him and he gives his life to the Lord and God is saying to him put everything this is all rubbish put that all that aside and when he comes to the Lord he is so disgusted by the lifting weight universe that he that he runs away from that and and and this thing is of the devil and and really ruined my life and it brought you know such bad thing in my life so he becomes a Christian and for him you know lifting weight is something that you know the Lord delivered him from and he was putting that before God and and he's delivered he's so happy he goes to church and in his mind he's so sure that everyone has the same experience as him and then on a Sunday afternoon he's invited to the pastor's home for lunch and then he enter by the garage and he gets in the garage and then he sees some weight lifting equipment in the corner of the garage and he's like my goodness my pastor is going to hell and he doesn't understand how a man of God could lift weight it's impossible but that man of God is past 50 and his muscle are disappearing so he's just trying to keep up with age right that's right I I heard an amen there but this man is able to do his few pumps you know sweat a little bit take a shower and feel relaxed and move on to something else it's not a big deal for him but this man that came out from the world his conscience is so effective because in for him it was destructive so he will regard that thing as evil and you know what maybe God is shape his conscience to say you because of your past you'll have to stay away from that because the weightlifting for you is a door to the world but for this other man that lifting weight is not a door to hell you're with me when I was when I was in the world hcky for me became the main thing it it became a survival thing for me because you know when you raised a Christian sometime in school you are you are rejected and you're a kind of a nobody and because I was a good hockey player I I kind of used that to be accepted so when when when you do something and you're accepting you're love you are noticed oh Steve is good this this this it becomes over it becomes unbalanced because you all your self-esteem is pour into that you become this to be loved to be appreciated it's a it's it's it becomes a trap and I was so much in hockey hockey was so big for me when I gave my life to the Lord and God called me to the Ministry God called God asked me to put to put some of those things aside and not even return back to that because for me it triggers something even though I'm born again we're still in the flesh but I'm cannot turn around and preach that because first of all it's not in the word it's my personal experience with my background God can ask me something out of me that is not asking to you at one point you'll have to determine with the leading of the Holy Spirit what's good for you and what's not good for you because sometime it's not what you're doing it's what it leads you to and you have to use discernment as even Paul is teaching that not everything is bad but you don't want to become slave of those things now conscience equals conviction so let's go back to Romans 14 some of the followers some of the Lord's followers think one day is more important than another other things all days are the same but each of you make up your own mind that's a that's a modern uh uh verion so you have to be fully persuaded because later on in the in the in the in the verse it says what you believe about this thing should be kept between you and God you are fortunate if your actions don't make you have doubts so you want to be sure that you are fully persuaded because the Bible says but if you have doubts about what you eat you are going against your belief so basically you're going against your conscience and you know that is wrong because anything you do against your belief is a sin so if you go against your conscience you are sinning but your conscience is not the word of God so it becomes a bit tricky right so we want to deal we want to go deeper into that topic to understand so if you go against your conviction you're committing a sin because you are trespassing the policeman that God has put inside of you but your conscience has been shaped by your parents if you've been a Christian it's been shaped by the word of God by the pastor by the church by other what are the people are saying about your family by your parents and it's all a kind of a sometime it's a Melting Pot of a lot of information and sometime it can become confusing it's like what do I believe and if you travel a little bit you go from Camp to Camp like we have people here and you maybe you come from another church and that other Church believe it this way but you visit that other church and they don't do it that way like we are Canadian sometime we have youth people they they they travel they go to the United States and the Americans you know they're this way this way Canadian or that way and sometime young people they come back and they're a bit confused well they do this over there but us we don't do that and and when you travel a little bit sometime you get confused because you like well this people doesn't like they believe the same message but they don't end up with the same box and it's a bit confusing like is it a different God no it's the same God but with different people with different background that's why the prophet is teaching that every church is Sovereign because it's not every pastor we who will apply the word the same way but we don't want to use that to Rebel but we want to go deeper to be mature to understand that this is something that that can vary and I'm not talking about the word can vary the word is firm it doesn't change but there's the humanity in between that sometime confuses us something your conscience will do is that your conscience will accuse you and that's a boring thing you're doing something you think you're all good and then you're you're sto in your track she's laughing yeah you're like I'm not supposed to do that who told you that your conscience right now it just accuse you like you were going at it and suddenly you realize Christian is not supposed to do that what am I doing am I a Christian yes no my parents is the pastor around you got people at the church around okay I'm good I'm good it's a battle right you're on the web you're clicking clicking suddenly you're like I think I'm going too far who's accusing you your conscience you have to deal with that it's a it's an ongoing conversation that never stops all right so we got an example in the Bible so when they brought a an adulterous woman and everybody want to Stone her everybody's good she's a sinner we're not we're going to kill her because she committed a sin and Jesus what he did he used our conscience and he says Whoever has no sin cast the first stone and the Bible Bible says from the youngest to the oldest you start to hearing dropping of stone talk talk talk talk talk talk talk because the Bible says when they heard G Jesus appealed he didn't name any sin he didn't say anything all he did is trigger their conscience and when he triggered their conscience they realize I'm holding a stone to Stone her but I'm full of sin myself and the Bible says they were convicted by their own conscience but my question is where was their conscience five minutes ago it was there but it was quiet but when it was triggered it came back and they stopped what they were doing so it means that we can trigger somebody's conscience to make him stop what he's doing by making that conscience accusing you so your conscience is talking to you Paul says in 2 Corinthians for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience so your conscience is not just accusing you when it accusing you your conscience is basically testifying to you in a modern version it says we can be proud of our clear conscience we have always live honestly sincerely etc etc so the Bible is saying that your conscience can accuse you your conscience can can testify to you about yourself but based on older information cuz it's it's been shaped by something else and that's where we're heading slowly stay with me cuz we're going somewhere with that the prophet says you got a woman where she says it doesn't condemn me to wear short hair it doesn't condemn me to wear manicure or makeups or whatever it is it don't condemn me to go to dances it don't me condemn me to let to tell a little white lie it don't condemn me to play bridge in my bridge party you know why you ain't got nothing to condemn that don't hurt my conscience you got no more conscience than a snake has hips so you ain't got no conscience there ain't nothing there to hurt you you're of the world and so if you're in that position tonight well like I can do whatever I want it doesn't hurt me you're in trouble because you have blasted that mechanism that comes from God that God has created us with an internal policeman and if you have busted everything that well I don't feel condemned about nothing you're in trouble and if you're in that state tonight you want to pray to Lord Lord restore inside of me some boundaries B and you know who are the people who bust all the limits and all the boundaries it's people that been that is put in it way too small of a box so tight they they they had to Rebel to breed and that's a problem because after that once you've busted that little world you don't have anymore and that's what happened to me when my mom left my life I was living in a small box a dynamite but I ended up I had to go in jail to know the limit and I had to hit the limit not of my church but of my Society like you don't rub a store period that's why the Bible says that the policeman is a servant of God why because he'll stop you but we should have a policeman inside of us and maybe some of you are asking well you're not talking about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is supposed to do that job yeah the Holy Ghost is supposed to do that job but the Holy Ghost will use your conscience because we don't have visions unless you have a dream one night and the angel appear to you and says what you're about to do is wrong God's going to use your conscience that's how he want to talk to you but the problem is our conscience can be shaped by many things so we want our ience to be reliable I hope we can have that mature conversation amen so we're going somewhere with that you had another person living on their great condemnation and it was an an adulterous woman we remembered a story she she went to see the prophet and she was under so much pressure because she was so condemned by her subconscious and she was not aware of that she says I feel the world's going to burst and when the prophet had a vision and he showed that you know she she did uh uh adultery and all that and she need to confess to the husband the prophet says well I that's all I can tell you a psychiatrist would have never pulled that out of you it means that when she did that she felt guilty guilty guilty until you know there's people they say well I'm tired to feel guilty right you've heard that before for I'm tired to feel guilty and when they do that what they want to do is they want to Dynamite the guilt feeling to be free from guilt but the the thing of it is you have to question why do you feel guilty are you you can be tired of feeling guilty but the the the answer is not always to get rid of the guilt feeling you got to question why am I fing guilty and then you some people can say well brother CA I don't believe I don't believe that we uh can feel guilty for no reason really I'll give you an example it depends in what kind of environment you've been raised in one day the disciples were with Jesus and we know the disciples been raised in in an abusive environment the Pharisees was rough on people putting weight on people that they were not not even pushing thems you know the story so one day they're walking with Jesus and now they're under a new spiritual leadership they're with Jesus and the disciple they forgot to take the bread so Jesus start preaching and so they forgot to take the bread and Jesus start talking he says Jus said unto them take heed and Beware of the living of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the disciples they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have not taken the bread because in Jesus sermon he's he's kind of hint about the bread right away in their heart they felt condemned it says well he's saying that because we didn't so they thought that Jesus was condemning them because they didn't they didn't bring the bread but it had nothing to do with that but they were so used to be blamed about on everything that when Jesus opened their mouth their conscience were triggered about something something and so Jesus says Jesus perceived and he said unto them oh ye a little of Fate why reason ye among yourself because he have brought no bread so they felt guilty thinking that Jesus was condemning them and it's a good thing Jesus perceived the thought he says I'm not even talking about that but they felt condemned why because they used to be under they be used to be condemned over everything that now they made a mistake and and as soon as they hear the word they make a link that God is condemning me while he was not so it's to show you that conscience that conscience of the disciple has been shaped by people who always wanted to trap you that's was the Pharisees that was that's what it was to live under the Pharisees so much then one day they saw a man which was blind from birth and right away in their mind cuz they are so shaped in guilt and guilt and guilt right away they saw a blind man and they asked the Lord master who did Sin the guy's blind man somebody's done something wrong right away their conscience went to that it has to be linked to bad behavior somebody has caused that who is Sin here come on get up get up confess Jesus answered no no no no nobody has sin nobody has done something wrong here it's neither him did that man didn't sin he's not blind because of that he's not blind because of his parents but he's blind because the works of God should be made manifest in him so actually it was a positive thing but when when when you have people who've been raised with such a heavy heavy burden where every every aspect of behavior is control and blame and blame and blame when something bad happened in your life because in this case the disciple there's there's there looking at somebody else life but what if something bad happened to you right away you'd say Lord what did I did wrong the question is is something that's happening to you now is it related to your behavior it's just a trial maybe it's just a trial the prophet says that a sunshine is not the sign of approval of God neither a Cloudy and a thunder is not a sign of disapproval that that God is not in in debt but when our conscience is all it's been so damaged under so heavy heavy hand or the contrary some maybe there's some here that that needs that needs a conscience to be restored we got both I don't know anyone here so there's bothside I've seen bothside there sometime I wish you know these young people I wish they would have some trigger inside like you're going too far who said that you should know you're going too far I'm wondering why nothing inside of you is being triggered and so that blind man ended up being healed and then he he appeared in front of the Pharisees and Pharisee asked him why are you not blind who healed you like who did that and he try to explain well it's this man and well the Pharisees is like Jesus he's a sinner so and then the the the the Blind Men tried to explain to them something great happened in his life now he was blind now he sees he's all excited he's trying to explain that to the Pharisees and when he tried to explain that at one point the Pharisees says you know they answered and said thou was all together born in sins and thou thou teach us and so they want to The Blind Men that's now see they want to to shut him up they want him to shut up and you know how they did it they did it by blaming him for being born in sin like the Pharisees were not born in sin but it's a blaming game to blame you trigger your conscience so I can dominate you for you to shut up so that's was the Pharisees that's the kind of game they were playing and when you're under that it damages you because you don't know what's right and what's wrong so the prophet says in the message the greatest battle ever fought that we have five senses of the Mind the spirit and those five sents you know you got reasoning you got conscience you got memory but the prophet says that Satan has access to all of those he has access to your imagination he has access to your reasoning to your conscience to your memory so he has access to your conscience everybody has access to your conscience if you if I if I meet you in town and you're doing something and I and I'm just coming at you and how dare you you should be ashamed of yourself it it it leaves a scar in your conscience next time you're doing this you're kind of nervous like I hope Steve's not around he told me I was going to hell if I was doing that I don't believe that but I'm nervous anyway why because I've damaged your conscience I remove the freedom so the prophet says that imagination conscience memory reason and affection s they're all right if they agree with the word now we're going to bring the word into the conversation but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you'd blow a flu right quick so let me give you an example back home if you ride a motorcycle or a moped you need a helmet that's the law is it the same thing in New Zealand by law you need a helmet so it's a safe country if you go to the US many states you don't need a helmet you know some states even slogan is Live Free or Die well you're going to die for sure live free you know the US live free yeah no helmet so after I preached on the conference a brother went to came to me after service he said brother Steve I got to tell you a story he says I was riding a motorcycle years ago and he said you know in Quebec we need a helmet but he says when we cross in certain you United States the certain States we didn't have to wear one so we gladly removed it was like yeah we're free no helmet so he says I was driving with my spouse and then at one point that was before he was a Christian so he said he said you know what she said after a while my she said we need to stop I need I don't feel comfortable I I need to put it because she even though she was allowed to do it because she was an environment where she's not supposed to do it she was not comfortable and that's just a natural element but she was not comfortable wearing not wearing one because in your heart in your mind is was like I'm doing something wrong let me give you an example let's say that's you you've been raised in a in in a church I don't know Holiness movement something that that if you you go to church you need a how do you call that is it a scarf or they they they they think the veil is a scarf they think that they see 1 Corinthians 11 they think it's and so you've been raised you go to church you wear this and and and then suddenly you come in the message and then you realize you know the word the word is open it's revealed and you realize my hair is my covering wow that's amazing but let me tell you if every day of your life you you went to church and wearing one the first meeting you go with the new revelation of the word you're kind of you go and sit in church you're like like something is missing I understand the word doesn't ask me to do that but I feel like right yeah exactly because now your conscience need to get adjusted with the word of God and before it was adjusted by a Dogma or something that was required of you that God was not asking you so it needs to get adjusted but not adjusted by a Dogma by Church rule but by the revelation of the word of God because this is how God want to build this church it's upon Revelation but we got a lot of young people that you're under your parents and you the Bible is asking you the Bible require of you to obey your parents well you say well my parents are demanding something I don't agree with you know what God will honor you more if you obey them while God is asking you obeying them in something that maybe in your heart says well maybe one day when I built my family I won't do that but for now God is asking me to obey my parents and God will bless you if you subject yourself to to your parents and pray for your parents but also pray for Lord to show you are they right is it is it something you're asking you or this is just my father who believes that but until you're home and until you're there under their headship you have to obey God will bless you God will bless you in obeying something that maybe your father's not right maybe you don't have to do that God will bless you more than because if if you go against that you know what you get you get a rebellious Spirit when you disobey you get a rebel your spirit and when you get a rebel your spirit you're in trouble because that spirit will eat you up so what we want is our conscience oh I didn't move the slide so what we want is our conscience to agree with the word because the Bible says that be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God so God wants to transform every one of us so that we can discern by the renewing of our mind and to be to prove what is good acceptable and perfect you with me so our conscious accuses us our conscious testify to us but the prophet says we have to clean our conscience just like the prophet says in greatest battle ever fought says just like an old boiler with the flu stooped up you put a fire and it'll blow your thing up that's what the matter with so many blow up Christian is because they don't clean the channels out they don't go down the inside you've got to clean it conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadultered word of God that is the truth so you got memories that are bad God can clean it you have a conscience that that's damaged by sin you got to repent God's going to clean your conscience but God wants to clean your conscience also if you've been under bondage and sometime it does it doesn't come from parents sometime it comes from friends on both side oh you guys are so strict your family is so strict man man you're not allowed to do anything man come on man come on loose up a little bit and and and you got friends who attack your conscience saying it's too tight uh oh oh you got friends that attack your conscience you're too loose I don't I don't understand why your family's allowed to do that man it's it's wrong in church they they don't want to and and then you get attack on both side and sometime it's confusing and say Lord what are you asking of me that church allows this that church doesn't allow that wh what what's your opinion you know one day the prophet and I'm not talking about obvious thing like lying stealing adultery I'm not talking about clear-cut thing I'm talking about gry Zone because theyve many Grays on I'll give you an example the prophet was con constantly criticized because he in his prayer line he used to pray for color people because he would he wanted to see a vision for each one of them so after a couple of them he get he was getting tired and he he had to stop they would pull him out of the platform because he was so exhausted and people were disappointed they drive many miles they want to be in the prayer line and after four or five maybe 10 I don't know he would quit and stop and the people complain he says Oral Roberts he prayed for 500 people and after three or five the people are disappointed and he had so much pressure he was like Lord what do you want me to do they say I should pray for 500 and I pray for just for a couple of them because I believe that if I have a vision for each one of them the faith was going to rise and everybody's going to be healed but people complain and he said he said to himself next time the angel appear I'm going to ask the question I'm going to ask the Lord what should I do pray for five or pray for 500 there's surely an answer here because some people are not happy what I do because now so is in his conscience he thought that 4 five was good but because because people attack him now he's not sure anymore about what to do so next time the angel appeared to him he asked a question and he he asked the angel he says this is what I have as a problem I pray for a couple of them and and and people criticize me because oral or Roberts pray for 500 what should I do and he's expecting to have a clear-cut decision of God like this is what you're going to you know what was the answer of the Angel do as you feel led I want to be told I want to be told because I don't want to be I don't want to be uhhh I don't want to be blamed I hate to be feel so the prophet wanted to be in a position where nobody would blame him and he would feel 100% comfortable with his own conscience regarding the people but the Angel didn't help him that day because you have to do as you feel led if you're under your parents you have to follow their leadership but it depends some family there's something you can have you sit in the living room and have a fellowship on a topic other family maybe discuss is a sign of rebellion so you have to be with your family some family are up into discussion you can sit with that and say that have a question you know I've on my heart I don't think it's wrong but you don't want me can you explain me do you see in the word and I'm not challenge you I'd like to understand one day I'll have to take decision for myself now I'm under you and I want to be under you I'm not rebelling I don't know if you can have that conversation I don't want to trigger some problem but at one point you don't want to go to what I went from 16 small box to nothing then you get married and you never took a decision in your life you know you have sometime young people they get married and they end up in the world and you know why that happened because that sudden Freedom they never realize that it's the church rules parents rules that kept them they had nothing inside first of all you need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost but I'm taking a different angle tonight on purpose I'm not trying to diminish the importance of the Holy Ghost it's it's preach a lot and I'm and I and I the problem is that myself Having the Holy Ghost for many years I've struggled with my conscience knowing that Lord I know that you're you have nothing against that but when I do it I feel like I'm nervous because of where I come from it's like that woman with a scarf like every time I go to church I'm nervous I feel like my parents are looking at me because they raised me in that Holiness Church church so sometime it is difficult to enjoy the freedom let me give you another example Peter was the one who received a revelation that he could eat everything right he had a revelation God showed him you know that that uh came down from heaven Turtle all kinds of stuff then God says kill and eat like oh no Lord never never and God had to teach him the New Freedom the new revelation and so finally Peter enter into that that New Liberty and he's eating with with pagans sitting at the table with Gentiles having Great Fellowship but then there's people from that other church that still believe that is wrong they come in and then Peter is cut in between the conscience of those people those people and he ran and hide and even Paul call him a hypocrite why because he got caught between two different conscience and he didn't know where to stand Peter had the Holy Ghost but he struggled with the old view that that was the ended years ago and a new acquired Freedom by the opening of the word that's why I'm taking purposely that angle tonight I'm not talking about the baptism Holy G that's a granted you it's been preached I know you've heard that I'm I'm the conversation we're having tonight is to young people who have the Holy Ghost but still wonder Lord why am I so nervous why I do always feel guilty are you condemning me or it's the whole system system running after me and it's not not easy to get free from that I'm closing got to find a way to do it quickly so your conscience I'll finish with that got to skip a lot Romans 2 says that for when the Gentiles Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contain in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thought the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another so what is saying here is that when the the word of God is written the law of God has written in our hearts our conscience should be adjusted with what in our heart and not with what people are saying so the purpose at the end of the day we all said that to say that our prayers is that Lord I want my conscience to be adjusted with your word but sometime we want God to tell us everything in details like the prophet was sincere to I pray for five or 500 and he's waiting for a number he won't get that number because you have to walk by faith and take the decision to the best of your ability out of sincere of your heart in Romans 9 it says I say the truth I lie not my conscience also bearing me withness in the Holy Ghost and so we want our conscience to testify to us the word of God not the rule of our friend or this group or this idea if you under your parents it comes to your prin and God will bless you for that but as you're moving slowly to take your own decision you want this is the direction you want to takes Lord I want my own identity with you we have brothers here you're going to start a family your wife your children's going to look to you says what do you believe well let me call my dad right at one point you won't call your dad anymore god dad can be around and good advice and it's good to keep a connection all that experience but at one point you'll have to know for yourself let's barhead Lord Jesus we want to thank you for the clarity of your word and I pray Lord tonight something has been said to help the young people because sometime we have that internal conversation within oursel and we're confused Lord is it you talking to me or is it me to me where this come from and we want we don't want to Dynamite to burst to blast all those limits that's not the purpose but Lord we want to live in your freedom and we want to we we don't want to be in bondage of peer pressure peer pressure to loose up or PR peer pressure to fall under the law Lord help us to keep a balance and to know what do I believe I don't want any young people who go through this sudden Freedom that I went through that I couldn't handle and that brought me straight in the world because I was not ready I was not prepared I was not TR trained my prayer is this we'd have young people getting married and and and to build a solid a strong family rooted in your word this is why this is my prayer for every young people here Lord I pray in Jesus name amen amen brotheri MC
