We are halfway through the weekend and just what a wonderful, wonderful weekend it has been. Maybe I can just ask you to take your seats for a moment. Um just an absolutely special time. I trust that that each one of us are refreshed this morning, ready to receive what the Lord has for us. Um, just the the types and shadows and the principles are just wonderful and I uh I'm excited to see how we're going into the application and the practical side of it today. I assume I have no idea. Praise God. But I'm just really excited about the day. So, uh, thank you everyone for coming. Um just looking forward to excuse me just a really good day of fellowship with everyone. Um there's just a couple of things I I want to mention. Firstly um I announced we're going to have those special um Wednesday night services in the war memorial hall on the 3rd and the 10th. um the dear lady at the district council um had not looked properly and came back to me and said oh sorry the 10th is not available so what we'll do is we'll move the 10th to the 17th um so the two two Wednesday night services that will be moved to the war memorial hall will be the 3rd and the 17th of December so the youth focus service on the 3rd the coup's focus service on the 17th um so just remember that that Wednesday night is moved out with a week, but the rest of the services go on as usual, but it's just that we changed the location for those two services. Um, and then something else that I just feel is is um useful to mention, we've just had a a wonderful wonderful response for the youth camp um announcement this year and thanks to the the amazing team that's involved, various various ones and um this is this is 2025 technology. I'm still in the 1900s, but um it's been really really amazing to see um the response that we've had and we've we out of places we've we've had to stop registrations. Um we've all the places have been filled um and just really excited about it. I spoke to brother Steven Coffee um again this morning and um he's he's really gearing up to come and seeking the Lord and asking for prayer that we keep him before the Lord to make sure that he gets the the direction that the Lord wants him to go in and yeah just all around just very exciting and just looking forward to that that time in February um that will come around really really quickly once we hit December it's crazy month um so we're Just thank the Lord that everything has come together so far. Praise the Lord. Yeah, I just wanted to share that with you this morning. So, maybe we can stand together and sing one more song and then I'll just hand straight over to brother Daniel. Um, he became me. He became me so that I could become him by grace. He became me so that I could become him by grace. And he took my place so that I through his love could take he Oh, he became me so that I could become him by grace. He became me. Oh, here he Come here by my gra. so that I could become him by grace. Amen. You thankful for that this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you musicians. Praise the Lord. Amen. and good to be back in service with you again this morning and uh really just uh looking forward to continuing with our our thought from from last night and uh trust it was a a blessing to you and &gt;&gt; and uh sometimes these type of topics uh stimulate a bit of fellowship which is always nice. Uh it's the good thing about having questions, you know, &gt;&gt; um if the wife has a question, then she can um ask a husband and if the husband has a question, then he can uh ask his wife about, you know, what what did you think about this or what did you think about that? And and uh it's it's great. I love it. There's there's something about fellowship that uh even a church service can't do. So uh we thank the Lord for the opportunity to gather here again this morning in his presence uh with his guidance to us all and uh just really really relying on our on our Lord this morning. So, um, we're going to continue, but we're going to recap a little, not much, just a little, um, simply because, um, if if we just start off and you weren't here last night, then it could, uh, it could seem a little bit odd perhaps, um, to you if you could put that first slide up there. Thanks, bro. Yeah. Uh, opening slide. Um, but we're going to turn in our Bibles here to the the book of Luke. Um, which is the got a bit of a picture of at least what an artist has um attempted to capture um the event of what go is going on in Luke chapter 4. Um but we understand by God's grace um through the revelation that he has given us that we can see details in the story &gt;&gt; that the greatest artist can't actually paint &gt;&gt; or put together. It's actually it's actually not not possible. um they can they can see the mechanics of of what is going on but the the dynamics is a whole another thing. The they they can't see the mystery. &gt;&gt; And um I was speaking to a brother, a minister one time and he was just telling me about his concern with AI and its ability to be AI to be able to generate sermons. and uh he was a little bit concerned and I I said to him I said brother there's one thing that AI can't do &gt;&gt; and that is it can't see the mystery &gt;&gt; it cannot see the mystery behind the letters it can just see the mechanics it can only take what is written it can't read in between the lines amend has given his bride the ability to be able to read in between the lines 's not not making his not taking his word out of context, but she is by his grace able to see the mystery written within the lines uh of the event that uh that that we're speaking about here in Luke 4. And so let's just let's just read it here from verse uh 14. It says Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee. And there went out a fame of him through all the region roundabout. And he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all. And he came to Nazareth where he had been bought up. And as it his c as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he opened the book, he found the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised. to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And when and he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." And all bear witness and wondered at the gracious words he that which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, "Is not this Joseph's son?" Amen. We'll come back to that. Let's uh turn to the book of Revelation. Uh Revelation chapter 5. We're just going to read this again this morning. Uh, Revelation 5:es 1:7. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon a throne a book written within, and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book. and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Amen. Maybe we could just flip over to uh chapter 8 verse one. This is this is that same one when it says a and when he opened this is that lamb that was talking about in uh in in verse 5 oh sorry chapter 5 7 that was coming to take the book. So we see here in revelation 8:1 that he now had possession of the book. &gt;&gt; And because he now had possession of the book remember he was the only one worthy. He was the only one able. &gt;&gt; But because now he had possession of the book, &gt;&gt; it says, "And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word as you take your seats this morning. So just to um draw a bit of a a a context here from the story that we read uh in in uh Luke 4 here. We we spoke about this uh here and there last night and just we saw how what was happening here was that the book took the book and revealed himself as the book. Because Jesus, he he was the word. So he took the word and he revealed himself as the word. All right? He didn't pick up the book. And I remember if you I better put the timer on. I um re remember last time I was here, we we focused on this scripture. But he did not pick up the book as a mystery to himself. He picked up the book as a mystery to the public. &gt;&gt; He picked up the book as a mystery to the priest that gave him the book. The priest that gave him the book didn't know who he was. &gt;&gt; But he was not a mystery to himself. And the evidence that he was not a mystery to himself is what is that he could take the book that was given to him which was closed. He which was the book of Isaiah. We know that he took the book he opened the book and he found the place where it was written of him. The only way that he could find the place that was written of him is if he knew who he was. &gt;&gt; He was revealing himself by the word. &gt;&gt; Right? So that's the book. &gt;&gt; Now, as we said last night when we looked at the story of Zakius and Jesus said, um, I'm coming to your house. You know, we were there then. &gt;&gt; We we were in Christ when he went to Zakius's home. &gt;&gt; And we understand that in this event here, you was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were in him as a mystery. &gt;&gt; He was both bride and groom. And we understand that through the return of a son of man ministry or the son of man ministry there was going to be a another manifestation of the word again &gt;&gt; but but not in this form. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was going to take on another form. And what I mean by form is he was going to be flesh again, &gt;&gt; but he was not going to be in the the form of flesh that he was here &gt;&gt; in the second manifestation. &gt;&gt; He was going to be in another manifestation of him. It was going to be another manifestation of himself &gt;&gt; in another form. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we looked at that last night um off and on again looking at Adam um and and his wife, how when God bought Adam's wife to Adam, it was actually the second coming of Adam &gt;&gt; because that's who that was, &gt;&gt; right? So the second coming, he is not coming in a masculine form. &gt;&gt; But he is coming in a in a in a feminine form. &gt;&gt; He is coming in a bride form. &gt;&gt; And we can say he's coming, but there should be something in you that says, "Brother Dan, you're wrong. He's he's he's come." And and that is true, but it's also not true. Because there's some people that he hasn't come to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's some people he hasn't revealed himself to. &gt;&gt; He's come and he's coming. &gt;&gt; All right. Because the I I have a I have a son who's not serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe that my son was in him &gt;&gt; as a member of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; But God hasn't revealed himself &gt;&gt; to him yet. So he hasn't come to him yet. &gt;&gt; And we understand that the the coming of the Lord and when we think about in a in a many membered body, it's a progressive coming. It's not just a coming, but it's a progressive coming because he comes to every member &gt;&gt; at an appointed time &gt;&gt; because he doesn't deal with us as a church. He doesn't deal with us as as a group of message believers. He deals with us on a on a very personal level and at a and a at appointed time at an appropriate time he comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we I I I believe that because the bride is a part of the same book. Brother Brandon said this is the complete revelation &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Right. That means that this the revelation of Jesus Christ in also includes him in bride form. &gt;&gt; So because you are a part of this book, I believe that he wants you to pick up this book the same way that he picked up the book. &gt;&gt; We could say it like this. He's going to pick up the book again. &gt;&gt; All right? Because we've got to stop separating us from him somehow. And it's very difficult in our through our natural minds and our natural tongue to sometimes speak a a heavenly language. But he is he is he is picking up the book again and he is opening the book again and she is turning to where it is written of him and saying this day this scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so Revelation 5 um through to Revelation 5 through to the opening of the seals in Revelation, the seventh seal and Revelation 8 is something that the bride the bride picks up the book and she says, "This day this scripture is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's a it's a wonderful thing when we when we look at this because what we find is that the book is in the home. The book is in the home. That's the this is this part two of what we looked at yesterday. Uh the the the book in the home. And so, the breaking of the seals has a spiritual application. But is it possible for Revelation 5 to be in a natural application in our home? Can those principles be be expressed be applied to our homes to our to ourselves as fathers uh mothers, sons and daughters. Absolutely 100% in in my opinion there's there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that God wants us to live by the principles of his of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it doesn't matter what we think. It doesn't matter how difficult they might might seem like uh to live by. They are life. &gt;&gt; The principles of God are life. The principles of God are something that God wants to see in our homes. &gt;&gt; All right? God wants to see these principles played out in our homes because this is the level that God has condescended to. &gt;&gt; God has condescended to a level beyond I'll say it like lower than a prophet. &gt;&gt; He's condescended now to mom's dads, &gt;&gt; sons, and daughters. &gt;&gt; All right. He's kind of saying he he I say this, he can't go any lower, &gt;&gt; but really he can't go any higher &gt;&gt; because the way up is down. &gt;&gt; You know, the the he couldn't condescend into our lives until he had condescended into a prophetic office. He couldn't take the office of of a father until he'd taken the office of of prophet. So what what you call up or down, I'm not really sure, but the statue of a perfect man goes like this, right? And it gets closer to him as it gets to the top. &gt;&gt; All right. So we we are up at that capstone and God is now expressing himself and manifesting himself as his family. &gt;&gt; Not in a man but in a many membered body. God in his family. All right. So we looked at these characters. Um we looked at these the the characters in Revelation 5. Uh we have the lamb. We have the book and we have the one who is holding the lamb. The the lamb we know it's the son. The hand holding the book we know that's the father. But the book is the mystery. &gt;&gt; All right. Adam, we know, God, we know. But who is this? &gt;&gt; Right. Speaking of Adam's bride. &gt;&gt; All right. Adam, we know. The the word identifies Adam as Adam. The word identifies the one that bought the mystery to Adam as being God. &gt;&gt; But the mystery, who is this? All right. And it was the same with uh Eza. A Abraham. We know Isaac. We know. But who is this? &gt;&gt; Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Rebecca was the mystery. &gt;&gt; All right. Rebecca was the one that was sealed. Uh Adam's wife was the one that was sealed. This book is sealed. All right. It's the It's the females that are sealed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not the males that are sealed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the females that are sealed. And we we looked at that a little bit last night of why why would God put a seal in a woman &gt;&gt; that only one man is worthy to open. &gt;&gt; When this book was sealed with seven seals, but there was only one man who was worthy to open it. I I I believe God God is wanting us to connect &gt;&gt; that seven sealed book with our daughters &gt;&gt; cuz they're sealed. &gt;&gt; So that's that's where we're going to go. That's that's the direction we're going to head. And we we we are going to look at the the application uh of this um tonight uh this morning. So there we have it. We have the on the left lower we have the lamb coming to take the book. We have the um the hand holding the book and we have the book. The book is the mystery. All right. The the book is female. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We spoke about relationship. This is all about relationship. There's a relationship between the hand and the book. There's a relationship between the book and the hand. There's a relationship between the lamb and the hand holding the book. And there's a relationship between the lamb and the book and the book and the lamb. It doesn't matter which way you want to connect it. You can just go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. It's it's all about relationship. &gt;&gt; All right. But we we understand that the the seals here belonged to someone. &gt;&gt; The seal belongs to someone. &gt;&gt; All right? And and really that's what a sister desires. A sister desires to come into contact with the one who that seal belongs to. &gt;&gt; All right. And the brother wants to come into contact with the seal that belongs to him. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So let let's just read some uh I had had these on there as sorry. What am I doing here, man? Slow down. All right. We read this quote last night. Now you see the seals when he was in his meteoral work back there redeeming. But someday he comes forth to take this book that he's redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And all that's in the book would be him. &gt;&gt; For that's the believer. The words in the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the and the word is him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. She is him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because she is the words in the book and the word is him. And all that's all that's in that he came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain before when he was slain as a lamb. All right. So here we we have the picture here looking at it how we we saw it last night. It's all about relationship. Sorry I haven't got father there. I don't know maybe on the next slide. Yeah, I do. So, uh in in this slide in verse seven and this could be just you can take this or you can leave it whatever but in verse seven is the only verse where all three are mentioned together in one verse. We're in verse seven. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God, &gt;&gt; the mystery of the book &gt;&gt; shall be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we see here it says, "And he," it's the lamb, I've got them colorcoded. You can connect them. came and took the book, the bride, &gt;&gt; out of the hand of him, the father &gt;&gt; that sat upon the throne. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so in in in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, what's actually going to be revealed here is that these three are one. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God, &gt;&gt; not the mystery of gods. Remember John saw one sitting upon the throne, &gt;&gt; right? So, so what what we are re what God is revealing to us here is this is this is one person in three offices. &gt;&gt; God the father, &gt;&gt; God the son, &gt;&gt; are you ready for it? &gt;&gt; God the bride. &gt;&gt; Right? These three are one. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When in the when when is this revealed? When is when do we see them as one? In verse seven, &gt;&gt; when do we see them as one? When the mighty angel's message comes forth, &gt;&gt; it reveals all three as being one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's all the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's it's this as a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's all of this &gt;&gt; revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The complete revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, just to um again, we I'm not sure if I said this last night or not. I couldn't I know I had stop written very clearly, but um I'm not I can't remember where I actually stopped even though it says stop. But we want to bring this scene into the home. We have father, son, bride. Right. Let me go to the next slide here. Parents, daughters, sons. So we want to bring this this scene into the home. What the hand of God is to the book. Can you see it there? What the hand of God, hand of the father, the parents. All right? It's not just the father. The parents need a relationship with their children. &gt;&gt; All right? Because the the the parents are the one that um govern the home. And yes, the father is the head of the home. The father is the one who traditionally gives away the bride, right? Who gives this woman to marry this man? &gt;&gt; And the father says I do. But he he's not saying I do when his wife's saying I don't. &gt;&gt; All right. He's actually it's it's one voice, &gt;&gt; but it's two opinions. &gt;&gt; Right. He's he's saying what she is saying, right? Not because happy wife, happy life, but because they have a revelation &gt;&gt; of the individual. All right? So what what the father is to the book, the parents are to the book. &gt;&gt; What the parents are? Sorry. What the father is to the son, the parents are to the son. Because you know he has parents too, right? &gt;&gt; Right. The the the the young man who's interested in my daughter, he has parents, right? So there's a relationship between the hand, the the son and his parents. But there's also a relationship between the son and the parents of who the parents of the book. &gt;&gt; There has to be &gt;&gt; it it it shouldn't it does happen but it should not happen &gt;&gt; unless there is and we'll find out why later. Okay. Um, what the lamb is to the book, the young men are to their lady. All right. What the young men are, sorry, what the lamb is to the book, the young men are to their lady. That's right. &gt;&gt; What the book is to the lamb. You sisters are to your men. What the book is? Oh, this this book is something else, man. &gt;&gt; I mean, when you think about what the lamb had to go through, &gt;&gt; what he had to go through &gt;&gt; speaks about the book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE THE BOOK IS SOMETHING ELSE. That's right. &gt;&gt; My the book is just you sisters are a type of the book. &gt;&gt; What the book is to the lamb, you sisters are to your man. &gt;&gt; What the book is to the father or the parents. The sisters, you sisters are to your parents. &gt;&gt; The how the father is seeing the book is the same way that the son is. I'm just jumping ahead here. &gt;&gt; If the boy the man is not seeing the book the way that the father sees the book, &gt;&gt; then he's not worthy of the book. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN THE BOOK'S NOT HIS. HE'S JUST got to grow &gt;&gt; into the revelation &gt;&gt; of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So in this scene, the father was the keeper of the book. Let me let me go back here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in in this this scene in Revelation five, the father is the keeper of the book. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we want to look at that a little bit because in the home, the parents are the keeper of their daughters or daughter. The book is sealed. The daughter is sealed. The relationship that God had with the book in Revelation 5 was the protection of the book &gt;&gt; and so it needs to be in the home. &gt;&gt; It's the father's relationship. I say say father but parents it's the parents relationship with their daughter that protects the daughter &gt;&gt; because this is why we say can Revelation 5 be in the home and I'm telling you it can. And I'm telling you, it's not that it can, it is. &gt;&gt; If you can understand, if you can see it, if if it this is a personal experience to you, then you can bring it into your into your home. Now, I am the father because this is the level that God has CONDESCENDED TO. AND WHY WOULD GOD CONDESCEND TO THIS level and not fulfill his word in this level? So we we talk about it. We've talked about it. It's it's all about relationship, right? So what this scene is showing us is the parents position to their daughter. But it also shows the the daughter's position to their father or their parents, right? Because a relationship is two ways. So it shows you the position of a parent and the position of you as a daughter. All right? We understand that the hand of God which is right up here the father's hand the book was in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne right which was God the father god as a father right and that the hand of God represents power and authority &gt;&gt; this hand in revelation five that the book is in is the same hand THAT THE SEVEN STARS WERE in &gt;&gt; in Revelation 1. &gt;&gt; Because God doesn't have right hands. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have powers &gt;&gt; AND AUTHORITIES. HE HAS POWER &gt;&gt; and authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the same hand that the seven angels were in &gt;&gt; are the same hand that the book is in &gt;&gt; which is power and authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this IS THIS IS MIGHTY BECAUSE the reason that those seven angels were in the right hand the the Lord's right hand is because they were valuable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. They had purpose, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO, ANYTHING THAT IS IN THE RIGHT HAND OF THE OF GOD HAS VALUE, &gt;&gt; he was THE SEVEN ANGELS PROTECTOR, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. He kept them. They were kept &gt;&gt; BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO HERE WE HAVE A BOOK THAT IS kept a bride WHO IS KEPT BY THE SAME POWER AND AUTHORITY THAT THE SEVENTH ANGEL WAS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Showing us that YOU ARE OF THE SAME VALUE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT THE SEVENTH ANGEL WAS. HE LOOKS at you like he LOOKS AT HIM. &gt;&gt; HE HAD A DIFFERENT PURPOSE, BUT THE IT'S NOT THE PURPOSE THAT BRINGS VALUE. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; That brings value. &gt;&gt; All right. So the prophet of God, he he said this question and answers, God, I I came from God and I go back to God. Is that right? after his death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, when the body was taken up and set at the right hand of God. Now, I don't mean God's got a right hand. &gt;&gt; God's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the right hand means means in power and authority of God. that in that name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it. Everything in heaven in earth is named after it and subject to it. A name above all names Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO IT'S IT'S POWER AND AUTHORITY. Now if we if we understand who we are as fathers, WHERE IS THE POWER AND authority of God today? &gt;&gt; Wherever God is, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO IF GOD IS IN YOU, &gt;&gt; THEN THE POWER OF GOD AND THE AUTHORITY OF GOD IS in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAID HE HAS no hands but your hands. &gt;&gt; Right. So, so who are these hands? &gt;&gt; All right. I'm speaking to THE FATHERS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT to understand what level God is condescended to and what level of relationship that you can have with your daughters when they are a mystery to themselves. In first Peter 1:3, it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. who are kept BY THE POWER OF God &gt;&gt; through FAITH &gt;&gt; UNTO salvation &gt;&gt; ready &gt;&gt; to be revealed in the last time. &gt;&gt; So what do what what does God do for us? He keeps us. &gt;&gt; How does he KEEP US? BY HIS POWER AND AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE WE ARE IN the right HAND OF GOD. WE HAVE BEEN in the right hand of God. WE HAVE BEEN KEPT BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY of God because there's a purpose for keeping you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. AND THE PURPOSE OF HIM KEEPING YOU is so that you through salva through faith unto salvation so that you are ready to be revealed in the last time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the last days in the last hour the you are going to be revealed. &gt;&gt; So there's there's two things here that ARE IMPORTANT WHICH IS KEPT and ready. Because a woman needs to be ready. Before she becomes unsealed, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE seal is broken, she needs to be in a position that testifies she is ready for that seal to be broken. IF SHE'S NOT IN A POSITION THAT TESTIFIES THAT SHE'S READY, then she's not ready. So, WE UNDERSTAND THE POSITION of the book. THE POSITION OF THE BOOK WAS IN the hand of the father. All right. That word kept there it means um keep keep with a garrison to guard protect by a military guard &gt;&gt; EITHER TO PREVENT HOSTILE invasion or to keep the inhabitants of a besieged city from flight. &gt;&gt; All right. So to to keep we are kept by the power of God. All right. We are guarded &gt;&gt; by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. We are protected by the power of God. HE HAS PREVENTED &gt;&gt; HOSTILE INVASION. &gt;&gt; That's right. MEANING THAT HE HAS PREVENTED someone &gt;&gt; invading the book, &gt;&gt; BREAKING THE BOOK, OPENING THE SEALS ON the book. HE HAS PREVENTED SOMEONE ENTERING THE BOOK THAT IS NOT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY or the right to enter the book. &gt;&gt; Right? So now you can see this as THERE'S A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. THIS is this is I say this is the problem but it's not really a problem but this is the problem with the opening of the word because as the word opens it puts more responsibility onto us BECAUSE WE ARE INVOLVED in the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Right? SO THE PURPOSE OF A FATHER the parents to their DAUGHTER IS TO PREVENT HOSTILE INVASION. IT'S TO PREVENT SOMEONE BREAKING THE SEAL WHO DOES NOT HAVE the right &gt;&gt; to break that seal. &gt;&gt; Because that seal belongs to one person, &gt;&gt; right? THERE WAS NO ONE FOUND IN HEAVEN. THERE WAS NO ONE FOUND IN EARTH. THERE WAS NO ONE FOUND UNDER THE EARTH. NO ONE WAS FOUND WORTHY. BUT THERE'S A MESSAGE that came THAT SAID THERE WAS ONE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, AND JOHN JOHN WEPT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NO ONE WAS found worthy. &gt;&gt; Now, this may be a I don't this may be a little bit embarrassing, but for the sisters, but sisters weep sometimes BECAUSE THEY FEEL THERE'S NO ONE WORTHY, &gt;&gt; there's no one eligible, &gt;&gt; right? in in the message, we lack men. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's like here, but I know at at home, I think we have uh one, two, three, four in our youth group, we have four four boys, five boys and about 15 sisters. SO, SOMEONE'S GOING TO WEEP. just putting it logically if you know what I mean. I don't know where their husbands are but or who they are but you you understand what I mean because they the and so the the um part of the meaning of to guard there is to keep the inhabitants of a pre uh besieged city from flight. So the the relationship that the father has with his the I say father because this is the first time I've put it as parents because I believe it is a parents role. If I say father moms just include yourself in there. All right because you are him. &gt;&gt; All right. So the the relationship that the parents have with their daughter prevents her from flight FROM RUNNING OUT. SO THERE'S NO ONE HERE. I'VE GOT TO GO INTO THE WORLD AND FIND ME A HUSBAND. LOOK, IF YOU'RE a sister looking for a husband, you're in the wrong place anyway. &gt;&gt; That's right. All right? Because it's the man that that searches you out. &gt;&gt; You you pray for your husband and he'll come to you. God, I promise you, God will bring him to you. &gt;&gt; All right? So, so the the the relationship that the the father has with the book stops THE BOOK FROM JUST HAVING AN IDEA THAT OH, anyone will do. Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't know about you fathers, but I can only speak from my my own experience that you know that we we if we see that our our daughters are getting a bit flighty, a bit worried, there's no one around, right? Then you through the relationship that you have with him sit down with them. You don't you don't call a meeting, you know, you need to come into my office. You know, it's just like go and buy an an ice cream and sit on the beach and talk about it and say, "Look, look, look, don't worry. &gt;&gt; There there is one. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're a daughter of God. If you're a daughter of God, God has someone for you. You just we just need to be patient and uh allow God to bring him to you. All right? It's through that it's through that relationship. But at the at the same time um his his his purpose is to to prevent um hostile invasion. So the f the parents stand as the door &gt;&gt; that you can't come to my daughter but through me. H how how are you going to get Now this this is a topic that people will totally disagree with me especially young men. &gt;&gt; Especially young men. All right. HOW CAN YOU GET TO THE book but through the hand? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF GOD. IF IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE BRIDE, YOU'VE GOT TO BREAK THROUGH THE power of God. &gt;&gt; BUT THE POINT IS HERE THAT WHEN A YOUNG MAN CAN SEE HIMSELF IN REVELATION 5, HE'LL UNDERSTAND HIS DUTY. HE'LL UNDERSTAND HIS ROLE THAT HE'S A THE ONLY ACCESS THAT HE HAS TO THAT BOOK IS THROUGH THE FATHER OF THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT IS THE PARENTS DUTY TO PREVENT HOSTILE INVASION. &gt;&gt; AND FATHERS, THE DEVIL WANTS YOUR DAUGHTERS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't Look No, it's not the devil. It's It's a GUY IN CHURCH. LOOK, THE DEVIL COMES TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT? SO WHAT? BUT DAN, HE'S A HE'S BEEN COMING TO CHURCH FOREVER. IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE HOSTILE INVASION DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S A BAD PERSON. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It means HE'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; He can be a good man, &gt;&gt; right? But there THERE IS A SEAL FOR HIM. YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT HIS SEAL MAY NOT BE MY DAUGHTER'S SEAL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? There is a seal, &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ANY seal will do. AND IT'S THE SAME WAY THAT THE DAUGHTER needs to think &gt;&gt; that not any man will do &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY MAN HAS THE ABILITY TO BREAK THE SEAL. BUT I DON'T WANT A MAN. &gt;&gt; I WANT A MAN WHO IS WORTHY. &gt;&gt; I WANT A MAN WHO IS ABLE. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST ABLE, BUT WORTHY AND ABLE. AND THAT'S WHO THE HAND &gt;&gt; WAS WAITING FOR. &gt;&gt; THE HAND THAT WAS HOLDING THE BOOK WAS WAITING FOR HIM WHO WAS WORTHY AND ABLE. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just waiting for a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO was worthy and able. And we're going to look at that because what makes a man worthy and what makes a man able? The relationship you see uh here is not a relationship of fear. &gt;&gt; You see the the the book is not deformed. &gt;&gt; THE BOOK IS HOW IT is meant to be. All right. This hold that the book has keeps it in its perfect order. &gt;&gt; We're going to come to this a a little later. It's it's not a relationship of fear. &gt;&gt; It's not a legalistic hold &gt;&gt; AND NOR IS IT A COMPROMISING HOLD. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because a legalistic hold will deform the book. &gt;&gt; A compromising hold will not be able to hold the book. &gt;&gt; By a compromising hold, you lose the book. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we compromise out of fear. Yes. &gt;&gt; So both a legalistic hold and a compromising hold or a liberal hold &gt;&gt; are stimulated or they are the result of fear &gt;&gt; because with a legalistic hold you hold it in fear of losing it. &gt;&gt; In a COMPROMISING HOLD YOU HOLD IT in a way of fear of losing it but lose it. SO THE HOLD here that the HAND HAS OF the book holds it in its POSITION WITHOUT DEFORMING IT. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A HOLD BUT IT'S NOT A hold a hold that applies pressure and then brings uh it does apply PRESSURE BUT NOT A PRESSURE TO a level that causes a deformity &gt;&gt; in the book. &gt;&gt; All right. So when the lamb took the book, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PRESS OUT the wrinkles, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Each one of these thoughts is a service in itself and and trying to reduce this down um to three services, but we're doing our best. Um now let let's let's look at the book. And the book uh here represents uh the the sisters. Okay. Um in the position that the book is in in this scene, she is ready to be revealed. The book is in a position of readiness. &gt;&gt; All right. The book is not its own protector. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Um the book is not its own headship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's under headship. &gt;&gt; It's under leadership. &gt;&gt; The right type of leadership. &gt;&gt; The right type of headship, not a liberal headship, not a legal headship. The right type of headship. It's actually a headship that she desires to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now there's a challenge for the fathers to create a headship that your daughters want to be under. &gt;&gt; That can be challenging, &gt;&gt; but it is possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the book is there as a free moral agent. THE BOOK IS NOT TIED THERE. &gt;&gt; It's the book is actually a free moral agent. the the the the book has decided &gt;&gt; to stay under the headship &gt;&gt; of its father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until &gt;&gt; he comes along &gt;&gt; and takes her in marriage. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The book is loved by her father. parents, &gt;&gt; right? Your sisters should feel loved &gt;&gt; by your father, by your parents, you know, and sometimes a good little exercise for your parents to do for your children is to ask them, "What makes you feel loved? Now, obviously, you can be tried on that because if they say, "Well, I want to go to the blue light disco." Well, you know, um, you can go, but I'm coming with you. You know, if you're dancing, I'm going to be the one who dances with you, you know, but you you understand what I mean, you know? But but she she cuz we're our our daughters are different. If you've got more than one daughter, you'll you'll quickly understand that your daughters are different from one another and they respond differently um to different things because of they're different. My two daughters are are ve are very different in their personalities and what their likes are and and dislikes. So, you know, God the Father, he knows us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, we don't even need to tell him. He know he knows us. BUT HE STILL LIKES US TO TELL HIM. &gt;&gt; You have not because you ask not, &gt;&gt; you know. So, sometimes it's a good idea even though the spirit of God is within you that that you don't always know what your daughter likes and what she doesn't like and what she needs and doesn't need. Okay? But the book is loved by her by her father. And it is the father's love for the book that becomes the book's protection. &gt;&gt; All right? Your your love for her needs to be stronger than anyone else's love. &gt;&gt; Anyone else's anyone else's. BECAUSE IF SOMEONE CAN CAN can love her more than you, then the the potential is that that one who is loving her more than what you are will pull her out from under your authority. &gt;&gt; So your love for her is your protection. &gt;&gt; All right. Um the book is under the headship of her father. THE BOOK IS not a free roaming book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um the book is not her own headship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The book is never without the need of headship. A woman can never be the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She is always the body. &gt;&gt; Right? So remember that God is not restricted by many things but he is restricted by one thing and that is the mask that he embodies himself in. And in this case what we are looking at is the daughter the book and how if God is in our daughters then how will God act through our daughters &gt;&gt; right now this is a good one for you brothers because the question that brothers have is the same as the sisters but vice versa the brothers have well how do I know if she has the Holy Ghost? HOW DO I KNOW IF CHRIST is in her? Well, how does she act? How does she respect her daddy? HOW DOES SHE RESPECT HER PARENTS? &gt;&gt; Why she she respects mom and and DOESN'T RESPECT DAD? WELL, THERE'S A PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; All right. So the the way that we can one of the ways that we can figure or or find or see how um a daughter has a sister has the Holy Ghost or not is her relationship to her father. Now her father may not be in a This is where it kind of blows out but her father may not be a believer BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT GIVES the sister a right to disrespect him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. You have your boundaries. If your if your father says cut your hair, you don't have to cut your hair because there's a higher authority than him that has said you don't have to. He doesn't want you to. &gt;&gt; Right? So that we understand that there's boundaries in these things and sometimes the father has been taken off the scene &gt;&gt; and the mother is raising the children. And as a result of that, what what happens here? This is why I've changed it from just being father to being parents. Because if THE FATHER IS TAKEN OFF THE scene through some some accident or something that that's happened and it's just mom raising the children, then then it is the m it's the hand of the mother that the relationship that the mother has with their children that actually keeps their children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so because God is in the daughter, he operates as a daughter. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. God in the daughter is not going to be head of the home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If the daughter is head of the home, it's not God &gt;&gt; because simply it's a perversion. &gt;&gt; All right. So even from the from the parents of the of the um the groom you you should be interested in your son's the one that your son has interest in. &gt;&gt; You should be interested. Ah it's his choice. Let him do what? No. No. You should be interested, right? Because the father of the son was interested in the performance one of the son but also the position of the daughter. &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE YOU AS the as parents of the son have a responsibility. You need to watch OVER HIM. YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT HE ISN'T being entangled with some Delilah, &gt;&gt; right? Because when when someone is in the arena, SOMETIMES THEY NEED SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF THE arena looking into the arena to see what is actually going on. &gt;&gt; All right. So the just because the Holy Ghost IS IN THE DAUGHTER DOESN'T mean the daughter doesn't need headship. And this is not often a problem with the daughter. It's a problem with the parents. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're old enough. THEY'RE ACCOUNTABLE. IT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOW. WELL, THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE THIS PICTURE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THE ATTITUDE THAT GOD HAD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE WAS STILL HAD AN INTEREST IN HIS DAUGHTER. He still had AN INTEREST IN WHO SHE WAS CONNECTING WITH. UH YOU KNOW and and it it it it rials me because I I've heard it often that IT'S OH IT'S THEIR CHOICE NOW. WELL, IT IS THEIR CHOICE. THEY DO GET to that age. But does that mean that you just have no responsibility to your children anymore? I don't believe so. &gt;&gt; I absolutely 100% don't believe so. I believe we have a responsibility to our children no matter how old they are. &gt;&gt; All right. It is it's uh let me just skip a bit here again. You know it's the same Holy Ghost that's in the daughter is in the father. &gt;&gt; Right? The same Holy Ghost that's in the father is in the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God in the father is acting as a father. God in the daughter is acting as a daughter. God in the groom is acting as a groom. So how how do we know if they have the Holy Ghost or not? Well, give them a word test. Try them out and see if even by you provoking them, they'll still respect their parents. Oh, your dad, you know, he's a bit of a funny daddy. You know what, sister? That's my dad. And no matter how much of a fuddy duddy we think he is, he's my dad. &gt;&gt; And I respect him. And it's the same same the other way. The sister can the the brother can say something about the the sister's dad and I can't believe it. YOU KNOW, HE WANTS US HOME BY 9:00. I MEAN WHAT IS GOING I MEAN YOU I MEAN YOU CAN PLAY THIS YOU CAN YOU CAN PUT THIS on because acting is not enough &gt;&gt; but the acting needs testing &gt;&gt; to SEE IF IT IS AN ACT OR IS THERE THE GENUINE HOLY GHOST IN THERE &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR DAD WANTS US HOME BY 9:00 AND WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO HERE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO THERE and And and you sisters can say, "Listen, that's my dad, and I respect his decisions. He may be a a little bit trying at times, but he is my keeper." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He is my headship, &gt;&gt; right? And when she submits to that headship, brothers, go home happy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Cuz it's testifying of something. is testifying of someone. &gt;&gt; All right. So for for a young man who's looking for for a wife or a young sister who's looking for a for a husband's there there are there are certain things that you can do and there's certain things that the father of the daughter can do and there's certain things that the father of the groom can do. I mean groom, but this is way before groom. All right? This is when this is when their boyfriend and girlfriend or courtship. This is before engagement. &gt;&gt; All right? That this this all this all happens. Um so I'm just trying to skip a little here, but um the book the sister uh is is never without headship. You'll notice here that the book is going to be transferred from one hand &gt;&gt; to another hand. &gt;&gt; There's not a time &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the book is not in a hand. There's not a time when THE BOOK IS NOT UNDER SOME FORM OF PROTECTION. &gt;&gt; BEAUTIFUL. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Even after marriage, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But there is a transfer. The book is transferred from one hand to the other. All right. She is moving from one form of headship to another form. From the headship of her father to the headship of her groom. Now there's a reason for that and we'll get to that. It's all it's it's all in the scripture. You you remember the scripture says in verse 7 that he came and took the book OUT OF THE HAND of him that sat upon the throne. Right? So he took the book. There was a there was a transfer &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; of hands &gt;&gt; from the BOOK OF HIM THAT SAT UPON THE THRONE TO THE BOOK OF THE THE hand of the lamb. from the hand of him that sat upon the throne to the hand of the lamb. There was a transfer. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHERE THE BOOK WASN'T in a hand. &gt;&gt; And the hand represents headship. &gt;&gt; The hand and headship is protection. &gt;&gt; All right? IT'S IT'S NEVER THERE'S NEVER A TIME WHERE THE BOOK WASN'T LOVED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT THE HAND REPRESENTS &gt;&gt; IS LOVE. &gt;&gt; HEADSHIP IS AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HEADSHIP IS NOT DOMINANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HEADSHIP IS AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE. IF A IF A HUSBAND HAS THE RIGHT TYPE OF HEADSHIP, HE WON'T NEED TO PRESSURE OR CHAIN HIS WIFE TO THE POSITION OF BEING UNDER his headship. IT'S A PLACE SHE'LL WANT TO BE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A PLACE THAT SHE WILL TRY AND ESCAPE, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A PLACE THAT SHE DESIRES TO BE. SO WHEN WE AS FATHERS HAVE THE RIGHT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR DAUGHTER, THEN SHE WANTS TO BE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE TIE HER TO. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE TO FORCE HER TO. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP THAT WE have with her, it it it BECAUSE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP, she desires to be under THAT HEADSHIP. SHE DESIRES TO BE IN THE HAND. BUT THERE IS COMING A TRANSFER of hands. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. There's coming is she's moving FROM ONE FORM OF HEADSHIP TO ANOTHER form of headship. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONE FORM OF HEADSHIP CANNOT DO FOR HER WHAT THIS FORM THAT IS COMING TO TAKE HER can do. &gt;&gt; All right. So it's it's it's wonderful. Remember, IT'S IT'S THE SAME HOLY Ghost &gt;&gt; in the Father. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IN THE SON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S COMING TO TAKE THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; All right. It's It's the IT'S A CHANGE OF HEADSHIP. IT'S A CHANGE. NO, IT'S NOT A CHANGE OF HEADSHIP. IT'S A CHANGE OF THE FORM OF HEADSHIP &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS THE HEADSHIP OF THE DAUGHTER THROUGH THE H through the father. BUT NOW THE HOLY GHOST IN THE IN THE BOY in the MAN IS THE HEADSHIP OF THE THE THE BOOK THROUGH A SON THROUGH THE OFFICE OF SON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We'll get to some pictures maybe tonight on that because it's just absolutely fabulous. Um, in Genesis 2, Adam's wife was originally under the leadership of God. God the Father. It was God that brought her to Adam. &gt;&gt; Leadership. She was under leadership. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T FIND HER OWN WAY TO ADAM. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE SAYS GENESIS 2:22 THAT GOD BOUGHT THE WOMAN UNTO UNTO ADAM, UNTO THE MAN, &gt;&gt; LEADERSHIP, HEADSHIP. AND THEN WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? Adam was going to step forward and take the book. YES, &gt;&gt; THERE IS A GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN THE FORM OF LEADERSHIP. &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE THERE HAS TO BE A CHANGE IN THE FORM OF LEADERSHIP BECAUSE THE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF LEADERSHIP ALLOWS THE BOOK TO BE UNSEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; SO, she's going from one hand to another hand. Um just to tell you a bit of a a story. um in had a brother, young brother come to me one time and and um he was he was courting or or not courting but he was just friends with this with sister and he'd approached the the the father of the daughter and got his approval and and uh he he come into my office and he said he said uh brother Dan he said I I don't think she's the one. I said, "Well, that's okay. That's that's if she's not the one, that's a good revelation to come to." But I said, "Tell me why she's not the one. Why what what brings you to that conclusion?" He said, "Well, well, he's he she's she's not coming under my headship." &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Well, who said she had to? Because you're boyfriend and girlfriend, &gt;&gt; right? This transfer is not at boyfriend girlfriend. &gt;&gt; It's it's not at engagement. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, this is at the altar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is THIS IS A WEDDING CEREMONY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. So I explained to him, brother, the thing that you are disqualifying her for should be the thing that YOU THAT QUALIFY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT QUALIFIES HER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE YOU'RE TEMPTING HER. YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL HER OUT FROM UNDER HER HEADSHIP AND SHE'S SAYING NO. SHE KNOWS HER POSITION &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S READY TO BE REVEALED. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ah, he got a bit of a surprise and went out of that room pretty happy. But praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. So, let's let's look uh at why it is important that she is under the protection by relationship. Revelation 5:1. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon a throne a book written with within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And no man in heaven, nor in the earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read and neither to look thereon. Now I've I've highlighted these things down here specifically because here John here is is saying that the one who is worthy will be worthy to open. &gt;&gt; He'll be worthy to read her and he'll be worthy to look her look look on her. only one. &gt;&gt; So, let me just um take you to a quotation here. And the events that we're we're we're seeing taking place is absolutely showed in the Bible of every age. We think we're all out of cada, but we're not. Everything's moving just exactly with God's word. Now, the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's not a book like the Bible. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The book picked up the book and revealed the himself as the book in Luke 4. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BIBLE, we're talking about this. But who is the revelation of this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. We're talking this this is he he's I BELIEVE GOD SAID THINGS through the prophet just to provoke us to think. &gt;&gt; Um but he he he goes on here. There's no book like the Bible because the Bible is God in word form. It's a word is a thought expressed. God's thinking expressed it. his words through the prophets and they they wrote the Bible which is in word form. Okay. So he's going as far as the thought. So yeah the thought the word but he's not he does but in this quote as far as I've gone with it he's not talking about the manifestation of the word &gt;&gt; and you are the manifestation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, SO THIS BOOK IS A SACRED BOOK. &gt;&gt; The thought that was in the mind of God was a sacred thought. THE MANIFESTATION of the book is also sacred. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this in the FORM OF THE BOOK BEING our daughters, IT MEANS THAT OUR DAUGHTERS ARE SACRED. All right, let's go another step. A woman was not even in the was not even in the beginning of creation because God knowed that she would fall. All other females could not commit adultery. She is the only one that could commit adultery. If she had been made like the original, that would be discomplementary to God's great wisdom. She's made a byproduct of a man. But because she was cast over in that side, she has ALSO BEEN GIVEN A SACRED CHARGE from God for redemption. She's got characteristics that she must not defile. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're looking at the thought of why why is it why is it that she needs protection? I mean, is it that because I don't want to say the wrong thing, but is it because she's clueless? IT'S BECAUSE OF HER VALUE. &gt;&gt; The reason that SHE NEEDS HEADSHIP IS BECAUSE OF HER VALUE. &gt;&gt; The reason she NEEDS TO BE LOVED IS BECAUSE OF HER VALUE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. CHRIST LOVED YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE VALUABLE TO HIM. IT'S NOT SOMETHING HE HAD TO DO. IT'S SOMETHING HE DESIRED TO DO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE CHOSE TO DO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT he wanted to do. &gt;&gt; All right? Her body is given to her a sacred trust from God. NO FEMALE DOG, no bird, no other animal, no other creature LIKE IT. NO, SHE IS THE only one. But but she the reason it is so sacred she is to bring forth life into the world into the earth. Her body is the bedding grounds of life. Therefore that's the reason she is given this sacred trust. Look what Hollywood has done to the women. Look how it is. It's robbed the sacred virtues of the women. On and on we could go see. All right. So the there is the the the re the reason that that the father needs to have that loving relationship is because of her value and her purpose on earth. &gt;&gt; All right. So I hope the parents are seeing this. I I hope you see your daughters as sacred &gt;&gt; and not just another female on the street or another female in the house. But I hope you're SEEING YOUR DAUGHTERS AS GOD SEES THEM. BECAUSE GOD SEES YOUR DAUGHTERS AS SACRED VESSELS. And when we understand what they are to God, then we can form A LEVEL OF PROTECTION around them because we understand who they are and what they are. It's like anything. If you had a gold bullion, you wouldn't leave it sitting on your letter box, right? you would you would HAVE A A FORM OF protection around a thing that that is valuable to you TO STOP A HOSTILE INVASION. &gt;&gt; You you you see you see if if if if um someone knew you had 10 uh blocks of gold in your house, WELL, YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF UP FOR AN INVASION, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE SOMEONE KNOWS THE value of WHAT'S THERE. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE AT MORE RISK OF BEING INVADED THAN THE GUY NEXT DOOR THAT THE BEST THING HE'S GOT IS AN OLD RICKETY BIKE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S VALUE IN THE HOME, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WELL, THERE'S VALUE IN THE BELIEVER'S HOME. THERE'S THERE'S VALUE IN MY HOME. AND AND AND AND WHAT I NEED TO TO DO IS TO PROTECT MY HOME BECAUSE OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I HAVE OF THE VALUE THAT'S IN MY HOME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT'S IN MY HOME, I can expect someone TO ATTEMPT TO PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND. YES, &gt;&gt; I CAN EXPECT IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY'RE VALUABLE. &gt;&gt; WHY ISN'T THE HOUSE UNDER UNDER THE SAME SIEGE, UNDER THE SAME ATTACK? THERE'S NOTHING VALUABLE THERE. &gt;&gt; BUT MY DAUGHTERS ARE VALUABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE DAUGHTERS OF THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SATAN WANTS MY DAUGHTERS. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I said this before and I just want to give you a little bit of an illustration here of the hold that the the book um has um which I'm sure your imagination has already gone there but you you you will notice in this picture that the book holds sorry the hand holds the book in such a way that it's not deforming the book. &gt;&gt; All right. When fear comes into our life, when we try and protect &gt;&gt; with fear &gt;&gt; instead of love, we put a grip &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; on that deforms the book, &gt;&gt; right? It's a it's when you grip when you try and hold someone &gt;&gt; with a legalistic hand, a legalistic strength, it deforms the book, right? And this this is what has happened in the past &gt;&gt; in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Right. And then the the groom comes forward, takes the deformed book and he has to take her and restore hermen, &gt;&gt; right? He he has to have a different approach. He if he holds her with the same grip that her father had, the hand will just get stronger and it'll continue to deform her, right? But but on the on the other hand um you know because fear can be expressed in two ways and legalism is one way but liberalism is actually another way. &gt;&gt; All right because because liberalism will cause you to compromise &gt;&gt; on the word because well if I do that I'm going to lose my children. Look, if you don't do that, you're going to lose your children. The the things that GOD ASKS YOU TO DO WILL NOT CAUSE YOU TO LOSE YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO. THE THINGS THAT GOD ASKS YOU TO DO will not cause you to lose your children. So when you have a liberal hold, A COMPROMISING HOLD WHICH IS STIMULATED FROM FEAR, &gt;&gt; you loosen the hold &gt;&gt; and you lose your children &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HOLD them &gt;&gt; with a compromising hand. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HOLD them with a liberal with a liberal hand. So you've you've the the hold that we have that we need to have is the is a hold that we have by revelation. &gt;&gt; Because perfect love cast out for you. &gt;&gt; It's by revelation. BY THE REVELATION of who they are, you can have a relationship with them. &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THE FATHER KNEW WHO THE BOOK WAS? That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. IT WAS THE FATHER'S REVELATION OF THE BOOK IS WHY THE BOOK REMAINED in the hand of the father. &gt;&gt; Right. So you can have a relationship with your children that will cause them to remain in your hand through the revelation of who they are AND THAT THEY ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I have a son who's not serving the Lord. Does that mean I didn't have a right hold somewhere? Well, potentially it could mean that. Potentially it could mean that I was one way or the other way. But generally, you know, just because YOUR CHILDREN GO OUT INTO the world doesn't necessarily mean that you have had a wrong hold. Right? BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I HAVE WITH MY son and I've had with my son is one of the things that IS GOING TO CAUSE HIM TO TURN around and come back out of the world that he walked into. &gt;&gt; All right? And again, we can go many places with with this, but um we we need to to finish very soon. Um So we don't we we want a revelation of our children. And this is kind of an interesting thought because you know when God come to Abraham Abram and said you shall be a father of many nations and you're going to have a son and the promise the covenant that I've made with you is with you and your children. Abraham could look at Isaac with the revelation of who he was &gt;&gt; as a child in in in um in in his hands. Isaac could take that child and look at that child and and know that there was a promise attached to that child. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. through the word. &gt;&gt; Right. And this promise is to you and your children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So your your Isaac become a revelation was a revelation to Abraham. &gt;&gt; That no it it doesn't matter. I don't need to worry. I don't need to fear. I don't need to be legal. And I don't need to compromise. This this child has the same promise attached to it that I have &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROMISE SAME PROMISE that was given to Abraham was also given to Isaac and the same promise that is given to me is also given to my children. So I can look at my son in the condition that he IS AND DENY ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES, EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN HIS LIFE, the the moods, the whatever ELSE THERE IS. I I CAN PUT THAT THERE ARE SIMPLY JUST CIRCUMSTANCES because I have a word that says this promise is to you and your children. SO I CAN LOOK AT MY child as someone the same as what I am a son or a seed of the most high. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the the same promise. So when our children become a revelation to us &gt;&gt; then we don't need to worry. BUT THAT MEANS THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE can compromise, &gt;&gt; right? But it doesn't mean that we need to be legal BECAUSE PERFECT LOVE CASTS out fear. Perfect love casts out legalism. PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT uh liberalism, the compromising spirit. All right? SO, BUT PERFECT LOVE KEEPS YOU ON THE WORD. You live by the word. You apply the word. You teach the word knowing that within them is a seed that is able to receive the word. A AND EVERYTHING MAY TESTIFY THAT THERE'S NOT. Think about the Apostle Paul. What what WAS THERE TO TESTIFY that he had something within him that was able to receive the word for his day? There was nothing. &gt;&gt; NOTHING FROM OUTSIDE. WHAT WAS THERE IN GIDEON? WHAT WAS THERE IN ABRAM? WHAT WAS THERE IN SARAI? WHAT WAS THERE IN MOSES? WHAT WAS THERE IN NOAH? WHAT WHAT WAS THERE IN MARY? WHAT WHAT ON THE OUTSIDE ON THE ON THE EXTERNAL? WHAT WAS WHAT DID ANYONE HAVE THAT COULD TESTIFY that they had the ability TO SEE THE THE WORD FOR THEIR DAY AND ACCEPT IT? No one had anything. And neither did you. Neither did you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, YEAH. BUT MY DAD WAS A PREACHER. MY DAD WAS SO WHAT? &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE THE THAT THAT'S NOT YOUR GATEWAY TO HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. None of us had anything that testified that we had the ability to receive the word for our day. But when the word of God spoke, there was something in us that connected with that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did Jesus have a revelation of the woman at the well? Was there anything that the that that in the woman at the well's life that testified that she had anything to receive the word for her day? &gt;&gt; Absolutely 100% not. But he could see it. &gt;&gt; He could see it. AND WHEN HE SPOKE THE WORD, HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF &gt;&gt; in her. &gt;&gt; He actually introduced himself to her in her. because it wasn't her, &gt;&gt; it was him in her &gt;&gt; responding to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. So, I'm going to finish in a moment here on the on the daughters and we're going to um move into the to the to the sun. But the the point we we just want to finish with here is that the the the when the book is under headship, if the right one when the right one comes along, she's ready for the change in headship. &gt;&gt; If the book is a free floating book, I don't need a man. I don't need a dad. I don't need this. I don't need that. Well, I have a question for the brother. What on earth are you doing marrying someone who doesn't need a man? &gt;&gt; Right. But a woman that is a free roaming woman, not under headship, is not ready for headship. &gt;&gt; It's not even that she she It's not even that she may not be yours. &gt;&gt; I can tell you another story. This is Yeah. I I can tell you another story of a young man who who um who went to another part of Australia. Um he he he just connected with this this uh lady who had been in church uh all her life backsliden out in the world. Um nothing to testify on her at all um that she was a a message believer or in the message. I don't think she cut her hair. That was about the only thing. But but um this young man comes back to me and he says, "Uh, brother Dan," he says, "I've I've I've seen someone and for some reason I've connected um with her. We were in a in a group. They went out to a restaurant for for dinner and and um he just got talking to her over the table and he didn't get her number. He didn't text her, anything like that." All right. So, but uh but um he said I've uh I don't I don't know. I don't know. But he said, "Is it possible for me to connect with someone um and and she be the right right one but not in the right place?" &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, as a type of the bride of Christ, weren't we all that way?" like did did God come to any of us because we were in the right place? Not a one. &gt;&gt; Not a not a one. So I said so I said yeah there there there is that possibility. But he said he he said well he said I guess I'm just going to have to wait to see what happens. I said yeah you are. You're going to have to wait to see what happens. Cuz this is this is just my opinion. I don't I don't think a man or a woman should join themselves as boyfriend or girlfriend until you know who they are because emotions can run. Um she can come to church and this is what happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. this this young girl ended up ended up coming to church and and um so he he he comes back to me, the young man comes back to me and just wants to fill me in and he says, "Bro Dan," he says, "I know that she's come to church, but I want you to know that that doesn't mean anything to me." I said, "Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." Um he he wanted more than a churchgoer, &gt;&gt; right? But you you think the devil's not cunning. &gt;&gt; You know that you think the devil's trying to woo our children in the bars and at and at at the parks. NO. HE COMES TO church &gt;&gt; in the FORM OF A FEMALE AND THE FORM OF A MALE. &gt;&gt; He comes to get both our sisters and our brothers &gt;&gt; any way that he can. &gt;&gt; So So the young man he he says, "Look, that that doesn't mean anything to me." So she comes to church Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday, every service, every service. Um, she she comes to me after a little while and tears rolling down her face and she says, "I want to get baptized." Young man comes back to me and says, "But Dan, I'm thankful that she got baptized, but I just want you to know that that doesn't mean anything to me." That my what is GOING ON? THIS IS FANTASTIC, RIGHT? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU SEEN BAPTIZED? &gt;&gt; You go down a sinner, you come up a wet one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; So, he wanted more than a churchgoer. &gt;&gt; All right. He he wanted HE WANTED MORE THAN SOMEONE WHO who had tears rolling down her face. And this is WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU BE CAREFUL, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU BE CAREFUL. AND SOMETIMES IT'S THE PARENTS &gt;&gt; THAT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE emotion &gt;&gt; of what is happening. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, this is a good sermon title. The difference between emotion and revelation. &gt;&gt; EMOTION. THERE CAN BE EMOTION in revelation. There should be, RIGHT? BUT EMOTION BY ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY REVELATION. OH, I LOVE YOU. All right. So, the young man goes on and so she gets she gets um see she's changed from shorts, I mean short shorts to to long long long dresses. Um she's changed from skimpy tops to um moral tops and you know every everything looks right. everything is just it it LOOKS RIGHT, BUT IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN LOOK RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, time went on and time went on and time went on and time went on and and uh the brother comes back to me and he says, "Bad Dan," he said, "I've even tried to ignore her deliberately to see if she would leave church." &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he said after a little while he said I realize that she has become a revelation to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. beautiful &gt;&gt; and I believe that she is mine. &gt;&gt; Not because of this and because of that, because of this and because of that, but she became a revelation to him. I wonder if the lamb, the book was a revelation to the lamb. I wonder if it was the revelation that the lamb had of the book that caused him to do what he had to do to get the book. &gt;&gt; We're going to go into that this this this evening. But what about the book? What about can the book become a have a revelation of the lamb? &gt;&gt; Sure. Can Can that be the reason that she does what she does? &gt;&gt; Because he's a revelation to her. &gt;&gt; Well, though that that couple, they got together and they started their courtship and went through their engagement and now they're they're happily happily married. But one one one thing that happened with with her is she didn't have a a father that was in a position to um know whether she could accept headship or not. And uh her mother wasn't around either. So my query was how do I know if she can respect headship? So what happened was I became &gt;&gt; her father. &gt;&gt; I took the position &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of father in her life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I set boundaries deliberately &gt;&gt; for her that she she just didn't she Yeah. No problem. if that's what you want me to do that I was I was expecting retaliation, right? But clearly this woman was a revelation to herself &gt;&gt; because once she becomes a revelation to herself and she knows that she needs headship because the book can't can't change hands unless it's in a hand. &gt;&gt; Because the book is in a hand, it can change hands. But until the book is in a hand, it can't change hands. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, so this Yeah, that that that story is actually my son &gt;&gt; and now my daughter-in-law who happy married with three kids. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this is what I'm saying. Is the book in the home? &gt;&gt; The book is in the home. &gt;&gt; The book is in the home. My my my daughter Charity, she's very different to Melody. Mel Melody would dress in anything like as in she didn't have to look nice. She would always dress morally, but she didn't care whether her hair was whether she had morning hair or afternoon hair or she didn't care. the charity. My youngest daughter, she she she dresses very nicely. She's got to look nice all the time. If she's had a hat on, she won't take her hat off under any circumstances unless she's in her room so she can redo her hair, &gt;&gt; right? She's just got to look that way. And John's very happy about that because he he likes to see her looking that way. So that's that's the one that she's cing. They're cording each other at the moment. But um just a bit of a story about your power of relationship uh with the with the parents to the to their daughter. Um because she likes to dress nice. She likes to shop. Because how can you dress nice unless you like Melody's happy to go to the op shop? Well, Charity's not happy to go to the op shop. I'm not wearing someone else's stinky clothes, you know. I want I want new stuff. Yeah. So, and because because she likes to stop shop, she comes into contact with spirits, &gt;&gt; right? Because Hollywood is the designer &gt;&gt; of of the clothing. So, you know, because because of who she is, she is she is tempted in a way that Melody wasn't. We had to look after Melody in other ways. All right. But but so so um Charity would go shopping and she knew what I liked and didn't like. We talked about clothes. Don't leave it to your daughter to guess what you like. &gt;&gt; Fathers, mothers, talk about it. Tell Tell them if I don't mean sit them down, come into my office. Um, I've got a slideshow of the clothes I like and don't like. No, no. Take them to the beach, buy them an ice cream, say, "Hey, you you look really nice this morning." JUST DON'T MAKE IT OFFICIAL. Don't make it formal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. BUT YOU'RE BY TELLING THEM, YOU'RE LETTING THEM KNOW. IT'S THE SAME WITH MY I DO THE WE SHOULD DO THE SAME WITH OUR WOW, DARLING, YOU LOOK nice to the to the today. You know what they'll do when they'll go shopping? They'll go shopping looking for the clothes that you said they look nice in. &gt;&gt; So, Charity goes to the shop as she does and she she pulls out a a dress. Ah, I don't know the difference between dress and a skirt, but she pulls out a dress and and it looks nice and she goes into the the the change room and she puts it on and this is her telling the story. Okay, she she puts it on and and um it's it's it's tight, right? But because she likes to look nice, she's looking at herself as looking nice with this tight dress on. BUT THEN SHE remembers me, right? The power of relationship because because she knows what I like. Because she knows as she's looking in the mirror, she's thinking, "Dad's not going to like this." She takes it off, puts it back on the hanger, puts it back in the rack because of our relationship. &gt;&gt; Because of the power of relationship. Do not underestimate the power of relationship that you have with your daughters and sons &gt;&gt; for that matter. &gt;&gt; I believe it's it for my son. I believe we we do the same. We we we we've done the same when they were growing up. We taught them what we like and what we don't like. And now, you know, he's living at home with with us has been for the last year and a half, you know, and and he knows what we like in the home and what we don't like in the home. I don't have to tell him what I don't like in the home. He just doesn't bring it into the home. &gt;&gt; So, there there is that respect. Yeah. His room just looks like a total pigsty at times. And sometimes I feel like taking the door off so it can just air out a bit. But but you know that's just boy things. It's just men men can live in a in a I guess some men can live can live in conditions that a sister would just run from. But that's why we get married. H they're they straighten us out a bit in that way. They that's why we have help. They're our helpmate. You know, my my my cuz. Cuz I can guarantee you none of you sisters would sleep on the bed that he sleeps on. It's filthy. But praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, the power of relationship. Amen. Sisters, what's your position in relationship to your parents? Because the the position the the position in relationship to your parents testifies &gt;&gt; of whether you are ready for marriage or not. Okay. Now you're you may not have parents but you have a if you attend this church you have a wonderful pastor. wonderful pastor and he would be more than happy to take that position in your life if you don't have anyone else to take that position. It's the same with sister uh sister Priscilla. She she's as the pastor's wife. If you don't if you don't have a mom, she's happy to be your mom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. She's happy to to to take that role in your life. And my wife and I, we do it. We do it. And the amount of times um we we have it it has See, you know, you know how the enemy works, huh? The enemy picks out the vulnerable. &gt;&gt; You you watch a story of a of a hyena or someone who's who's looking for for a meal. you know, they they're they're able to sense &gt;&gt; the weak ones, &gt;&gt; the ones who who who uh don't have the protection that they need to be. And then they get that herd running and then the weak one falls back &gt;&gt; and it becomes isolated and then the they come in for the kill, &gt;&gt; you know. And that's that's the same thing that can happen in a in a church scenario where it's it's often the weak ones that that that fall back. Those that don't have the protection that they need, those that don't have the the support that they need, the mother and father that they need. It's them that that fall back. And it's it's them that the te the the devil attempts attempts to take because as a pastor the pastor is the door. &gt;&gt; As a father you fathers are the door to your home. &gt;&gt; No one no one can gain no one should be able to gain access to your children but they come through you. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's nice song, brother. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's um let's leave it there. I got a big red stop here again. Um and we'll we'll attempt to get through the rest of this tonight. So, God bless you. Um looking forward to tonight. I I like I really really really like the next part of this.
