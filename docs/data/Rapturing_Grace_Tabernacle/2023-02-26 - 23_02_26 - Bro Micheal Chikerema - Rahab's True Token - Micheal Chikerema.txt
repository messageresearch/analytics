but forgive me if I if I repeat myself but I was nervous about this you know brother from Africa that comes and preaches and I was thinking maybe he's coming down the whole legalistic thing and then

to minister for uh we had special meetings in Perth and invited him over we had such a tremendous time spent the weekend with him wonderful fellowship and the Word was wonderful we're still talking about it and still feasting from it so that was good amen happy also to see brother Moses I think I was trying to calculate it could probably be 20 years since we last seen each other yeah it's very strange yeah it's probably close to 20 years since we last seen each other and your wife but she hasn't changed much I'm sure the sister will enjoyed that comment so happy to see you happy to see you my brother it's the doings of God Amen we were young men then never thought of being past as especially this part of the world but God had the path all worked out and now we bump into each other here in New Zealand uh in the taranak region that's that's a bit strange but God is good amen praise the Lord I want to also great brother Alpha we've kind of communicated on the phone but I had not met in person I'm trying to look around and see familiar faces but uh I think we all know each other in one way or another amen but I want to salute you all the Elders of this church the pastor appreciate the invitation and the work that has gone on over the years here and you can see how God is with you and you are still standing in the faith so you really want to appreciate that amen want to also appreciate my brother in love with my sister in love brother Morgan and sister patients that have been tremendous host for me we took the long drive down from Auckland I didn't want to fly it's my first time in New Zealand so I really wanted to really experience New Zealand so it was a long drive for brother Morgan but I enjoyed myself just to enjoy the scenery take it all in and when I was coming everybody in Perth was like man this is the bad time to visit New Zealand right now but I was willing to take the risk amen and just to be able to come and meet with you brother so we thank the Lord for that the church sends the greetings I did ask and say how many of you want me to take greetings to New Zealand and everyone lifted their hands so I'm not just being diplomatic and saying things but the church said their greetings A man also greetings from my precious wife I'm married with the two children my daughter the oldest daughter is turning nine in July my young boy is turning three in May amen so I've got a young pretty young family and so yeah like brother every said I've been this December will be nine years in Australia and I'm sure everyone is trying to calculate and try and place my age praise the Lord I I turned 40 last September to save you the calculations amen so I I actually initially relocated to Western Australia to do work I'm an Auto Electrician by trade Sparky Auto Sparky by trade so when I relocated to Australia that was what I had to do to provide a living for the family and I got involved in the ministry laboring under brother Claude Porter some of you Old-Timers surely definitely still remember him and so I labored with him a while and the Lord took him home and the responsibility fell upon me and I was elected and ordained in June 2019 to be pastor of Spoken Word Fellowship in Perth in terms of numbers very difficult to say we we are mining mining State flying fly out probably we're talking about 80 80 100 people somewhere there the numbers fluctuate because people do fly and fly out but on a Sunday probably on a whale hasn't attended Sunday we are more like what you are here right now so God is giving us Grace we've got over 10 nationalities in the church so we we are the United Nations [Laughter] from across the world Amen from the islands from the Asia Pacific from Africa from Europe New Zealand and obviously Australia so yeah but God has been good to us amen we speak one language that's the word of God one culture Christian culture amen and so that's what we try and do and God has been gracious it's been wonderful so I guess I've introduced myself now we can get to the word amen praise the Lord if we could stand on our feet for a scripture reading praise God amen so we read from the book of Joshua the Book of Joshua chapter 2. the Book of Joshua chapter 2. I had some personal greetings from Brother Kuda brother Kuda knows quite a few of you here he called me just before I took off and he said man I know a lot of people that make sure you do greet them for me amen so I bring those greetings from Brother Kuda and I'm trying to remember somebody else who also sent personal greetings is the wrong time to try and remember things when you're buying the puppet about to preach but you know some people that you know they sent their greetings [Laughter] praise the Lord amen Joshua chapter 2 start from verse 1. the Bible reads and Joshua the son of man sent out of two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into in Harold's house named Rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to set out the country and the king of Jericho sent out sent Andrew saying bring forth the men that have come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search all the country and the woman took the two men and hit them and said thus they came men unto me but I wish not once they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went I what not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them but she's she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hit them with the stocks of flags when she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way of Jordan unto the Forts and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them up on the roof and she said unto the man I know that the Lord had given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when he came out of Egypt and what he did unto the two kings of the amorites that were in the other side of Jordan other side Jordan cehan and OG which he utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in the earth beneath now therefore I pray you sway unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that he will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true talking and that you save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if he utter not this our business and it shall be when the Lord had given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let down by the cord through the window for a house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursue has been retained and afterward may he go your way may the Lord blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Saints praise the Lord and so tonight not tonight this morning we have we have an evening and a late afternoon service on Sundays so here I see you're privilege to have it on a Sunday morning that's great so this morning I would like to speak on rahab's true token rahabs true talking amen and we read there in the scripture that rehab was just an ordinary woman in the in the city but somehow it was very clear to her what the god of Israel was going to do it was very clear to Rahab that the god of Israel had pronounced judgment upon Jericho and she had no doubt that Jericho was under judgment and it was just a matter of time before judgment rested on Jericho and everything else was going to be destroyed and she knew that if she found a way she could appeal to the messages and The Messengers would be able to put in word for her so that she herself and their family could be saved amen and if we go to the scriptures if we can continue with a little bit of scripture reading we go to the book of Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10 verse 30. so we find a relatively common woman in Jericho and yet you find she's mentioned several times in the scriptures amen she's one of the individuals that you find in the Bible who has a very strange nickname or reference amen she's referred to as Rahab the halot and so I hope you do not be offensive to any as we are just repeating what the Bible States about her amen so it's a very strange uh situation that you have a woman whose even past life is referred to and there's nothing glorious about your past life and yet she features several times in the scriptures so if she even features she's one of the two women that appear in the great Heroes of the faith chapter Hebrews chapter 11. it's only rehab and Sarah of all the mighty women in the scriptures in the Hall of Fame in Hebrews chapter 11. amen and it says yeah Hebrews 11 verse 30 the Bible reads by faith the woes of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the hallowed Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace and what I shall I must say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jephthah of David also in Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrote righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the age of the sword out of weakness were made strong Works Valiant in fight tend to flight the armies of aliens so even in the great faith chapter Hebrews chapter 11 Rahab appears amen and she gets even her own space but the others like David like Barack like Samson they are referred to if only we had time we could have talked about this Mighty Men but Rahab has their own portion he has their own sentences their own verse but great men like David did Barack and Samson if only with time we would have talked about them [Music] so she occupies a very important place in Scripture let's go to the Book of James chapter 2. praise the Lord James chapter 2. and we start from verse 21. so I always say I try and wait as long as I hear Bible Pages flipping I try and wait for people I don't want to tempt people to just open a page and just wait there as if they are reading because they are too embarrassed to keep searching so I try and give it a bit more time um so I'm sure where most of us are there James chapter 2 verse 21 the Bible reads was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar says Thou how Faith wrote with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works and Men is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rehab the hallowed justified by works when she had received the messages and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also James in referring to Faith goes to the father of our faith Abraham and talks about his faith and we all know that the prophet says James is not contradicting any portion of scripture by talking about works but he's talking about what man sees the prophet says God sees our faith but men see our works and for a Christian people have to see the works of your faith so there's no contradiction there so he goes to the father of our faith Abraham and shows us that Abraham had the faith that God could see and also the faith that men could see amen and immediately after referring to the faith of Abraham of all the characters in The Bible he picks way up the halot and goes and mentions your faith also amen so the one thing that is outstanding about Rahab from the portions of scriptures that we have read the one thing that makes Rahab stand out over a lot of the women and a lot of the Mighty Warriors of God of our faith in the Bible was their faith rehab was a halot rehab was an ordinary woman in the city Rahab had no reputation rehab was just like any other Gentile but there is one thing that distinguished Rahab from everybody else that was in Jericho it was a faith praise the Lord and it was a faith that revealed to her that she could get a token the one thing that made it believe was the faith that was already in him though she did not know much though she did not understand the Mysteries and could not put the verses and the quotes together but somehow in a heart she understood that she could ask for a token amen and so there's a few places where the Prophet starts to drop certain things about this story that is in the Book of Joshua chapter 2 about the story of Rahab where the Prophet shows us that that is actually a very important story for the Gentile bride in the end time amen so it's not just some old story yes it's a reality this happened but it happened and it was a type of what God has done for the gentle bride in the end time and in the message as I was with Moses uh the prophet okay so I've got a picture there just to illustrate what actually happened so I'm not saying this was exactly what happened but it's just an illustration and so we see that she put uh uh the Scarlet thread down a window and the war everywhere else is crumbling down and the Levites are sounding the seven remhons and the circle the city seven times and then when the circle is seven times they sound the seven remones amen and we know that the realm is a male amen is easy it is a lamp that has grown to adulthood amen and so that in itself is very significant and the number of the horns is very significant to us who believe the message and know about God's Messengers amen and the shout that has been given amen and so when they sound it and they give the shout of Victory they then the woes come down and the walls crumble everywhere else apart from the house of Rahab who had put the Scarlet thread hanging down a window under the instructions of Messengers who were working under the Joshua Commission praise the Lord so it was The Messengers that were working under Joshua commission when the great prophet Moses had left the scene and these men were sent under the Joshua commission and they gave the instruction on how to apply the token and she followed their instruction on applying the token did exactly what they had said and God honored the word of The Messengers that ministered under the Joshua commission and the war did not crumble amen and so the war is very significant if you noticed in the scripture that we read it's actually very specific that the Bible mentions the location of halot of of rahab's house says she was living by the wall because the one outstanding structure in Jericho was the war amen the one defense that they had was the war and it was strong it was wide it was impenetrable it was something that gave them pride and even though they knew that they were under judgment yet they still had confidence that we have such a great wall they are not going to be able to pass the war and God chooses a woman whose house is by the wall amen where there's confidence where there's security where there is Assurance God says this woman has to be living by the world Amen because the one thing that God wanted to do was to show Jericho that he would go and Destroy even their very strength but in order to show Redemption he would destroy everything else except for the house of Rahab which is also under judgment but a token has been applied amen so in the messages I was with Moses the prophet says here now rehab the halot known as a hallowed she was a type of the believer today the real believer so you notice the prophet is already taking the story of Rahab and bringing it to today a real believer she didn't say now I hear that Joshua can do signs because he's the success of Moses I would like to see those signs and if I could see those signs then I'll believe it well he didn't absolutely have to show those signs because she believed it anyhow she was a Thomas she believed it and so just like in the book of Hebrews just like in the Book of James the prophet goes back to rehab and refers to her faith that the kind of faith that Rahab had was not the type of faith that looked for signs she was one who was prepared could believe even without seeing any other fresh signs Amen in the message widely to Bethlehem in referring to Bethlehem the city or the village or the settlement is you'd want to refer to it he says and we find out that it was also became the home of the Harlot rehab when Israel had passed over the borderline of the Jordan River into Palestine we are acquainted with the story of Rahab the halot let's pick jahed this morning for a few minutes as a young lady a beautiful young woman whose some Misfortune in life he had been forced in being Pagan he had been forced into the life that she was living and many times people are forced into the life that they live so the prophet goes and addresses the hallowed Pact in the full name of Rahab and he says yes she was but it was not by choice yes she was she was not known for great morals she was not known for being upright she was known for other things other than her morality but yet it was not because she chose to be in that situation the voice says she was forced into that situation by circumstances in other parts of the message many of you message readers the prophet says both her parents were cripples and being unbelievers she was forced into prostitution in order to provide for a living for a family amen so she was not choosing of her own choice she was not enjoying it in fact you realize that she did not want to be in it she wanted out but there was no way to come out Redemption under those two Messengers was also a Redemption from the life that she had long wanted to come out of amen so the prophet points that one out she did not want to be like that but circumstances wrong teachings wrong environments doctrines of devils had put here in that situation and the message token the prophet says this and this hallowed now taking the issue the story of Rahab and bringing it today he says this harlot Gentile watch all her family she was a believer oh her family had to get under that Scarlet streak that token they had to go under it or they would perish they had heard the wrath of God they had heard the displaying signs and miracles of god amongst his people and they had to receive it she had to receive it God's destroying Angel was coming they knew it and Joshua was that angel they were in line so is every nation in the world in line of God's judgment and so God takes the the rehab story takes the time she's in takes the types there and brings them to today and he says Jericho was under judgment there was only one way of Escape that was to be under the token and he says it's the same case today the world is under judgment nothing is going to stand everyone the scientists the economists the politicians they know that the world is under judgment everyone is expecting something tremendous to happen people know at the back part of their minds they know that this civilization has come to an end they know that after this where are we going that understanding is there amen people know that there is Judgment coming but amongst all that cares confusion fear and everything else that's happening there is a small humble woman that has been abused that has been used that has been forced by circumstances to be part of this corruption to be part of this wrong teaching to be part of this broken civilization yet within her she's got a faith in her heart that the I can get a token that yes this civilization is judged yes everything that I see this Cosmos is judged but I am sure you can if I can find the messengers of this God of Israel I can be able to get a token [Music] amen so there's a simple humble woman who's not much to look at yet there is a faith in him that believes that I can be able to obtain the token and if I obtain the token then I'm going to be spared the prophet in referring to the Scarlet thread amen just to show us that this story of Ray of the halot means much more than you look at it on the surface the red heifer was to be killed first the red denoted Christ red also is a danger sign and red is a sign of redemption God brings Redemption through the red blood Rahab the halot was Redeemed by the Scarlet thread that left down from a house red is a sign of danger and red is a sign of Redemption so in other words that talking that Rahab received was actually Christ because the prophet says that the red denoted Christ and Christ speaks of redemption so in the type of that story Rahab received Christ hair Redemption and it was Christ a Redemption that stood and made so that she did not receive judgment just like everybody else and in the end time there is a humble woman that is going to receive Christ Hallelujah and it is going to be the Christ that she receives that's going to stand with her and be able to to protect him from the judgment and redeem her amen I was looking at my sister and I was like that's a very familiar face I couldn't remember praise the Lord now it's just come to me praise God we've been together in Perth a couple of times yeah yeah praise the Lord are you sister flesh mother praise the Lord so I've got small eyes but they see praise God amen praise God so you start to see that the story of Rahab the hallowed is tremendous amen and we can see what God's plan is when you look at Realm brother just when we look at that story which can even start singing Amazing Grace just to think that God before the foundation of the world head rehabi in his thoughts just to think that God in his thoughts was not concerned about a profession he was concerned about your faith just to think that in the whole city with all the important people the religious leaders political leaders the business people in the city God had a place for one person and that was rehab and God in his planning sends two Messengers and of all the places they could ever lend they landed in rehab's house yeah hey man they were Angels involved in the moving of the Angels working under the Joshua Commission the Angels were leading them and guiding them not to a noble house but to the house of a halot known as rehab because God had a plan for Rahab because Rahab is the type of the end time bride amen and God brought the connection between the messengers and Rahab and made them come to an understanding and the relationship because the faith in the two was exactly the same oh the grace of God the grace of God coming for one woman doesn't it remind you of the story of Eliza Hallelujah in the whole city God sends Elisa and Eliza says a prayer and he says Lord the woman that will give me a drink but not only me but also my camels that's the woman you have chosen for my master Hallelujah and God visits the young lady gives you a revelation she comes to the world at that moment immediately after the words have been spoken in prayer she arrives and she gives him a drink but not only him the camels also a little bit God works on both ends praise the Lord God works on both ends and so God and His angels were involved in the Redemption of Rebecca and God and His angels were involved in the Redemption of rehab and God and His angels are involved in the Redemption of the Bride of the end time everything has been set up you are not born in this generation by mistake you are not where you are by mistake God has for ordained it from before the foundation of the world that you would be born in this generation and God sent his Messengers and he came with them cut them a certain way gave them a certain voice gave them a certain personality gave them a certain location everything was designed because it would somehow be able to catch you and you would bring the connection between you and his messenger Hallelujah in the message the Easter sealed the prophet says paragraph 84. the voice says and the same thing is with every True Believer when the preaching of God's word comes forth and it is Vindicated and proved that is God's word for this hour then there is something within the believer I don't care how loyal his father was to a church or how loyal his mother was or his grandparents if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message there is something in him that screams out he will leave the Banyan he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day but this is Eagle hour it is a different there is something that he must leave the old cook and fly away Into the Blue then this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to The Obedience of God's word amen now when this Holy Spirit represented as the ego flying over the land and finds the believer no man can come to me no man can come to me as he wants to oh the father has given me will come to me but no man can come by himself it isn't your own thinking your own drawing it's God drawing see oh the father has given me will come to me now the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like he did on Jesus Christ amen amen I like that first part of that paragraph now the Holy Spirit Joshua a type of the Holy Spirit and the prophet is saying the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the great super Son of God who redeemed us all it comes down and takes its place of Abode in the human life now notice brought the quickening power now that quickening power That Came Upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day amen so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery Holy Spirit if it's not the devil mocking the Holy Spirit but it is the real true Holy Spirit it will manifest that promise of this hour when it fell upon Luther it manifested that promise of that hour when it fell upon Wesley it manifested the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fell upon Moses it manifested the promise of that hour fell upon Noah it manifests the promise of that hour when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the promise of that hour is the holy spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that fall ordained of God to be in the rapture [Applause] now once you mention the word quickening you don't Quicken nothing yeah once you mention the word quickening you Quicken something that can be quickened now I want you to notice something that the two Messengers did not bring this colored thread to the house of rehab the Scarlet thread was already in the house of rehab the only thing that the two Messengers did was to show her how to apply the token oh yeah praise the Lord so your eternal life your salvation is already in you it's not coming from somewhere it's already in you the only thing that the word does it quickens the very life that is within you [Applause] so Rahab was born with the faith to believe she could believe for the token because she was born with the equipment in him to believe the only thing that Messengers did to her was to show her how to apply the token but the token was already there because the prophet shows us that the token today is not the chemistry of the blood it's the life that is in the blood and eternal life is God's life Zoe and if you are Eternal you were always Eternal you don't become Eternal that day that you believe how we're together so the only thing that happened with Rahab was that she was quickened that which was in her was brought and quickened made alive so that it could start growing and the prayer says that's exactly the same thing today he says the word has come to Quicken those that are already for ordained praise the Lord in other words there is a people today that have already been designed have got the equipment in them the only thing they need is to hear the ego scream the eagle scream is not bringing anything new to them the eagle scream is telling them that you are not a chicken that you have the equipment already that those wings can fly Hallelujah that that diet you are eating is wrong that the things that you are doing are wrong you are not an earth-bound creature you are an ego of the atmospheres but the potentials are already there amen the potentials are already there and if you want to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the Revelation that you need don't need you don't need to fight to fast the process you don't need to quit this and quit that and quit that he says all you need to do is receive Christ and then the Christ in you will start to grow and he will push out all these things amen he says the Holy Ghost today will manifest the promise of the day if you were born for this day you were designed for this day don't you worry when inflation goes up don't you worry when there's four D and 5G don't you worry about all these things you were born for such a time as this don't you worry when life seems to overwhelm you and it's so hard to understand where you're going to be and what tomorrow holder don't you worry about what's going to happen to my kids you are so afraid that you will lose your kids but I want you to understand if your kids are full ordained to eternal life you will never lose them they were designed for such a time as this I know it's crazy out there but our God is not the author of confusion Our God will not fail Our God brought us to this generation because he knew we have what it takes to deal with the challenge of the hour praise the Lord and the prophet says here in the Easter seal message he says let me say that again when this Spirit has found you that individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your Eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world is that is your potential like if you asked me for an oak tree and I give you an aircon now the life of the oak tree is in the Echo now but you have to wait till it grows up so do we when you receive the holy spirit of God it's God's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and you are sealed by the spirit of promise of God into the body of Christ when God looked down at Calvary and seen Jesus dying he not only he died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the word of God for the age whether it's it's Fit Body head or wherever it is see it's Christ was bleeding and dying and God looking upon Him saw his resurrection and the church raised with him on Easter now I want you to get all this together because I got something here in a little bit I want to say now notice it's the earnest or potential the quickening power of your Resurrection when you receive the Holy Spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it notice you are now on your way growing to the full Resurrection the prophet says the problem with the Pentecostals is that when they received the Holy Ghost they said this is all of it and the prophet what they didn't understand is what they didn't understand was that it is the beginning praise the Lord so if you are satisfied that you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are getting to betrayed like the Pentecostals because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is actually the beginning of it now let me say this the receiving of the token that Rahab received amen was just the beginning of the second phase of her life the only thing that the token meant was that the days of hair being used and abused were over what the token represented was Redemption that I have set you free from a life of sin and bondage and I'm giving you a new life but she was not going to end by just remaining in that wall house and saying oh thank you Lord Jesus I was not destroyed with the rest of the city I can now live in my own house in peace but when she received the token applied the token displayed the token then she started to grow and she started to grow in the second phase of her life because we understand that after she was saved she did not remain with the Gentiles she was inducted into the Commonwealth of Israel she became a part of Israel she fell in love with one of the mighty captains of Israel salmon and through Salman she received a seed the seed that was going to be a revelation of the mystery of the coming of the son of man because she received their seed from salmon a son of Caleb and after she received the seed she did not fall pregnant and give birth in one day but she waited she waited she lived Time After Time ate drank lived a month two months three months four months nine months and then Boaz was born who became the lord of the Harvest who also in a type redeemed Ruth that's right God protected the womb of Rahab in a prayer in her asking you don't hear of rehab praying for your children she asked for Redemption for a father her mother her brothers and the family and with that kind of love if she had children she would have asked for their Redemption she did not have children before someone in other words God knowing the Plan of Redemption protected the womb of Rahab we do all that she went through God did not allow her to conceive the children of all the other Gentiles but the seed of someone does God do that is that Bible pattern God visited the king after said I was prepared about to be taken as a wife and God says to the king you are a dead man you are a dead man because this is another man's wife God could not allow that seed to be able to settle there and conceive because he had a plan and no matter what you have gone through in life no matter what wrong teachings you've been in no matter what kind of riotous living you've been in I assure you brother sister God is always protected you there's places that God never allowed you to go there's things that God never allowed you to do there is abuses that God never allowed you to suffer because he knew that would not work in his advantage to according to the Plan of Redemption because you are a chosen vessel [Music] so he protects so that he can work out his Plan of Redemption right so rehab when she applied the token that was not the end of it she said I'm not remaining in this place of unbelief I'm not remaining in this place that is under judgment I'm joining a new Commonwealth the Commonwealth of Israel I don't know how long she stayed in Israel but all the habits that had been acquired whilst in Jericho one by one they started to fall off Hallelujah all the slang started to fall off hallelujah oh that dressing in that dressing started to fall off all the other things that were unclean started to fall off and brother Ray of the hallowed started to be rare rehab they're gorgeous Hallelujah in the mighty Captain Hallelujah of Israel looked at her and did not see a harlot and he saw a bride foreign [Applause] and as you hear the word as you feed on the word your life is slowly transformed and you start to change all the habits start to go old shoes are thrown out old clothes are thrown out and the new clothes come in Hallelujah new things come in new language coming new habits coming Hallelujah what's happening you are being transformed by the renewing of your mind and your life starts to manifest the revelation of the coming of the son of man you have you receive your seed and that seed has got to be made manifest what's that seed the very Life of Christ praise to my mind Hallelujah so it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your Resurrection when you receive the Holy Spirit then is dwelling in you notice you are now on your way growing to the full Resurrection no tree just comes up overnight that's some of the frustrations that people have when they start doubting their experience they're expecting to be perfect in a single day I came to the altar I had that experience I know something happened to me but how come I still have these thoughts how come I still feel this way how come I still have this struggle keep growing in his grace you are not going to become an adult Tree in one day Enoch walked with God it was not overnight it was a walk over years and years and years but he kept walking with God until he was not amen so don't give up don't think I'm a failure I should change it flick of a switch like that look closely in the scriptures you will see how God works you are not going to become an adultery in one day amen and he says there you um it's got to grow as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God you are baptized into the Holy Spirit now as the Pentecostal Church baptized into the holy spirit it's begin growing limb says died they was pruning them off but the tree is still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they are led by the spirit to Quicken the word to you who is Believers the word keeps quickening as you come to First limp second limb third limb on out it just keeps quickening the spirit of God keeps quickening to you amen he says the spirit of God keeps quickening to you brother says how is the raw cold right and he says the role is not called out as in Oman never come up or as in live Veil come up he says but your name is called by the unfolding of the mystery are you understanding this in other words the revelation of the word is connected to your name amen so God doesn't to call doesn't have to call your name and say brother Michael it's now it's your time to live sin and come and start to live with me God directs his Messengers whether it's a brother whether it's a sister but he makes an appointment like he made an appointment with Rahab and you come into contact with one of his Messengers and the messenger tells you about the word of God in other words gives you the revelation of the mystery of the word of God and something in you resonates with what you hear you're like something connects to this it's like I've had this thing before I don't know why this church is a bit odd this church is called account by people but somehow when I hear what they say there is a connection the prophet says what is happening the unfolding of the mystery is the calling out of your name so God doesn't have to do much he just has to send his messenger and reveal the mystery and when you hear the mystery you are going to hear your name amen that's what rayab heard when she heard of the mighty works of God she heard the name they have heard their name she did not understand Israel but when she heard of the great things of God that he was doing somehow in a heart she knew that she belonged in Israel the great works of God spoke her name what did Rachel what did Rebecca see she hate their name she heard the name is aliens I was talking about his master oh he's like this oh he's like that in the depth of the mind of Rebecca she saw herself stand next to this master she started to see the vision and see that Isaac needed a wife and I am that wife and it was such a strong Revelation that when she was asked that shall you go with this man this strange guy who's coming with long tails shall you go with him she said clear cut I will go with him because it was revealed in him that she belonged next to Isaac and in this end time there is a people that are clear on who they are that are clear that they are a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ they have heard the ego Shout they've heard the unfolding of the mystery and in the unfolding of the mystery they've heard their names and though they are people of no reputation though they are not special people yet they are special before God and they receive instruction from The Messengers that are working under the Joshua commission and they know how to apply the token and they apply the token and they escape the judgments Hallelujah and when they escape the judgments that life that they've received which is Christ represented by this colored thread starts to grow within them and everything else of Jericho starts to fall off with each passing day and they get connected to their maid salmon and they bring out a seed that reveals the mystery of Christ that's you and I you were born for this you are equipped for this the prophet says when God said to to Moses why cry speak the Bible says God when he said that he knew that Moses was born with the equipment in him and the prophet says Moses was born with the gift of great faith so when God says speak and move forward he knew that he had that Faith to speak and move forward When God says there shall be a bride without Spoto wrinkle don't look around look in the mirror yes you may not look like much but God when he says there is going to be a bride without spot or wrinkle he knows you've got the equipment in you to overcome in this generation in this generation with all the websites with all the entertainments with all the World Cups with all the influence of the enemy God knows you are more than able to overcome this world yeah why because you were designed to live in this age you are like rehab God says yeah that's a mighty woman of villa and everyone else is standing and looking at each other like what's happening is he talking about but there was one thing that stood it was the faith of rehab there was something eternal in real there was something eternal in the woman in the world there was something eternal in Mary Magdalene there was something eternal in Ruth but they faced a husband had to die so that she could have a second husband there's always been something Eternal in the bride but the first husband is going to die because there's only one seed that reveals the mystery of the coming of the son of man is the seed of the second husband which is Christ the Lord and that's where we are growing in his grace the limbs are growing out the approach says everything that you need in this life and in the Rapture is already in you he says the only thing that you need to do is to make sure that you are planted By the Waters and you drink in so much so that you push out so much and everyone says all those bushels of apples where were they they were in the little seed the thing that you need to overcome right now is not out there it's right in you the only thing that you need to do is to take in so much so that you can push out so much and produce the fruit that meets the challenge of this generation I'll read this quote as I come to your close the Sun has got to be reviewed again in the bride in the last day that quickening power has got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of the Living God oh that's the promise of the day a Living Word of the Living God who are we talking about you and I that's the promise of this generation the word living written Epistles that are read of all men Rahab the hallowed married to Salman the Great Captain coming together producing the seed that's the bride that's the son of man that's Christ coming together and his life coming forth through us which is the Living Word of the Living God that's the promise of today that's who we are there is no false matter in these things there's no cranking ourselves into it we were born into this there's no trying to force ourselves into the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is for us the Holy Ghost is for you you cannot force it in you were predestinated to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you were born for that reason to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to show forth Christ in this generation that's why we are here to show Christ to this world amongst the Carpenters amongst the mechanics amongst the teachers amongst the students amongst the business people amongst all these people there is a people that God has said I am choosing you to show forth my life and the more we feed on this world the more we become like him the more we continue to feed the approach says the moment you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have received your potential for the Rapture in other words you are already a Rapture candidate whilst Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them in other words as the Revelation was going forth that which is eternal that was in them was quickened up and there was a connection between the Revelation and the one receiving the Holy Ghost Hallelujah for full obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the token why because that token is connected to the message this is the prophet says in one place this is the message to apply the token amen this message is the unleashing of the Holy Ghost upon the people this message is what awakens you to what you already have and tells you that it just needs to be quickened this message this Holy Ghost message is the quickening power to Quicken that which is eternal already in you so that you come to life to become who you are supposed to be but the potential is already there that's you and I may the Lord reach to bless you as we invite the musicians forward praise the Lord amen amen [Applause] oh Hallelujah when the mother Eagle says she's not being brutal she's not being cruel she knows you can come up higher

wonderful this morning amen amen just so many beautiful things that came out amen the Rope was already there Hallelujah praise the Lord those Messengers didn't give her the Rope the messages only revealed to her how to apply the Rope hey man that's so good another thing is you are not an accident I mean you know I just love how [Music] of all those inhabitants in Jericho God LED those Messengers exactly to the woman who would receive the message in fact not just the woman who randomly would receive the message the woman that God before the foundation of the Earth has already identified as a seed Hallelujah you're not growing up in a family without a purpose you know growing up in a place without a purpose you did not just happen to meet up with that person who shared the message with you it wasn't just that you were potentially available and therefore you grabbed it no no God elected you and God let it come across your path whatever way amen hallelujah that's why miss the message runs in families because God uses one member of a family too you know to share with another one that's just how it works amen but it's by Grace by Elation Hallelujah and that little Eagle
