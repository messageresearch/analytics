[59:15] the story of sister Georgie Bruce
[59:18] sister Georgie Bruce
[59:20] and uh trust it'll just be a blessing to
[59:22] you tonight just a simple little story
[59:24] and and I believe that these simple
[59:26] truths you know they they reflect or
[59:28] they look at our lives and we can look
[59:30] at our lives and we can see a reflection
[59:32] in somebody else and see what God has
[59:33] done for them and sometimes you know
[59:35] somebody goes through a similar struggle
[59:37] and and then we can draw strength from
[59:39] their the way God dealt with them or
[59:41] help them and this really what we want
[59:43] to do tonight we want to look at a
[59:44] parable or a story and just draw from
[59:47] it's it's um its truth it's little
[59:50] nuggets that are hidden throughout and
[59:52] and we know that even in the Bible in in
[59:55] Acts 9 which is where we're going to
[59:56] turn to you're going to find this woman
[59:57] Tabitha or Dorcas and uh you know she's
[1:00:01] so we find that God has given us a
[1:00:03] modern day Tabitha and that that would
[1:00:05] happen to be our sister Georgie Bruce
[1:00:07] there so I'm just thankful for these
[1:00:09] things that that God has done for us and
[1:00:11] the lives he is allowed to be lived out
[1:00:13] before us and we can glean from them for
[1:00:15] our examples amen
[1:00:17] amen before we just go to the scriptures
[1:00:19] why don't we just bow our heads one more
[1:00:21] time and um we just ask the Lord to

[1:03:00] booth there and and they're doing slides
[1:03:02] and you know and we see those on the
[1:03:04] instruments and and the song leaders and
[1:03:06] the deacons you know brother John at the
[1:03:08] door there you know this we look at
[1:03:10] those lives and we we thank the Lord
[1:03:12] because they're always there serving
[1:03:13] amen they're always in our midst they're
[1:03:16] full of good works and and let's just
[1:03:18] give thanks for that tonight you know we
[1:03:20] appreciate that this evening and it came
[1:03:22] to pass in those days that she was sick
[1:03:24] and died whom when they had washed they
[1:03:26] laid her in an upper chamber now here's
[1:03:29] an incredible thing because here's
[1:03:31] someone who has a real benefit to the
[1:03:33] assembly and then something happens in
[1:03:35] their life and it causes them not to be
[1:03:37] a benefit anymore right and and so here
[1:03:39] in verse 38 it goes on and and Forest
[1:03:41] matches Lita who was nigh to Joppa and
[1:03:44] the disciples had heard that Peter was
[1:03:46] there they sent unto him two men
[1:03:48] Desiring him that he would not delay to
[1:03:51] come to them and then Peter arose and he
[1:03:53] went with them when he was come they
[1:03:55] brought him into the upper chamber and
[1:03:58] all the windows the widows sorry stood
[1:04:00] by him weeping and showing the coats and
[1:04:02] garments which Dorcas made while she was
[1:04:05] with them you know they appreciated her
[1:04:08] they really felt a loss when she when
[1:04:10] she went and passed away and so they're
[1:04:13] praying and they're weeping because of
[1:04:14] her loss you know there's some amazing
[1:04:16] lives that that God has invited home
[1:04:19] and they're on the other side of the
[1:04:21] chasm this evening and and we feel the
[1:04:24] loss we feel the void you know because
[1:04:26] of what they meant to the assembly and
[1:04:28] it says here in verse 40 but Peter put
[1:04:30] them all forth and he kneeled down and
[1:04:32] he prayed and turned turning him to the
[1:04:34] body said Tabitha arise
[1:04:37] and she opened her eyes and when she saw
[1:04:39] Peter she sat up and she gave her his
[1:04:42] hand and lifted her up and when he had
[1:04:45] called the Saints and the widows he
[1:04:47] presented her a life praise the Lord you
[1:04:49] may have your seeds this evening you
[1:04:51] know so we find this woman in the Bible
[1:04:52] who was full of good works and OMS these
[1:04:55] which he did and when she passed away
[1:04:57] she was missed you know some people we
[1:04:59] don't miss as much as others right but
[1:05:01] you know this person was greatly missed
[1:05:03] amen she was greatly missed and and so
[1:05:06] the congregation felt it the people felt
[1:05:08] it there was even people there to stand
[1:05:10] there as a testimony for the works that
[1:05:12] she did in their midst and so this was a
[1:05:14] great loss but we see how that God moves
[1:05:16] on the scene on their behalf to do what
[1:05:18] to restore her to the assembly so that
[1:05:21] she can continue in the work that she
[1:05:23] was doing so we see how this but I want
[1:05:25] to look at some of the struggles that
[1:05:27] people can go through we can we can go
[1:05:29] to church and we can serve God and
[1:05:31] you know and for myself my brother and
[1:05:33] sister I don't have a testimony like
[1:05:35] some do where they were in the world and
[1:05:37] and got saved and God did a great thing
[1:05:39] and they have wonderful testimonies and
[1:05:42] sometimes I I wish I had a testimony
[1:05:44] like that but I grew up around the
[1:05:46] message I grew up in the churches and my
[1:05:48] whole life I knew the church life and
[1:05:50] and you know the Lord just kind of in
[1:05:51] very small little steps worked in my
[1:05:54] life and my growth has been consistent
[1:05:55] but but slow you know no big great uh
[1:05:58] you know uh big events or anything like
[1:06:00] that even when I was baptized I just
[1:06:02] knew this this is my time and I knew
[1:06:04] that was the very next step in my life
[1:06:06] and just simple things like that and but
[1:06:08] you know you can go through the motions
[1:06:09] you can go through life like that and
[1:06:11] you can serve God and God is very is
[1:06:13] he's kind he's generous he's he's loving
[1:06:16] and and he's and he keeps you and he and
[1:06:18] he protects you from the the things of
[1:06:20] this world but you know my run sister in
[1:06:22] serving God sometimes we can get weary
[1:06:24] and well doing
[1:06:25] you know we can sometimes lose our
[1:06:27] vision a little bit even John one of the
[1:06:30] greatest men that ever lived you know
[1:06:31] his his eagle eyes got dimmed over a
[1:06:34] little bit there was a time in his life
[1:06:35] where you know he even started to sit
[1:06:37] down and just feel Lord you know I what
[1:06:40] about me and you know what about the the
[1:06:42] things that you've spoken of you know
[1:06:44] promises I've waited so long can you do
[1:06:46] something in my life you know it became
[1:06:48] very personal and you know we go through
[1:06:49] struggles and so we want to look at
[1:06:51] sister Georgie Bruce I just feel that
[1:06:53] God did something really special with
[1:06:54] sister Georgie Bruce and the kind of
[1:06:57] life that she lived in and some of the
[1:06:59] stages of her life and we want to just
[1:07:01] look through that and a trust it will
[1:07:03] encourage you this evening
[1:07:05] so the first time we hear of of sister
[1:07:07] Georgie
[1:07:09] is in this service here and this is in
[1:07:12] the service in in the handwriting on the
[1:07:14] wall 1956
[1:07:16] and it says it like this now now she was
[1:07:19] privileged to be in the very Services of
[1:07:21] brother Brennan how many would have
[1:07:22] enjoyed that that would have been a real
[1:07:24] privilege Amen to sit right in the
[1:07:26] services of of the prophet of the end
[1:07:28] time and so she was there she witnessed
[1:07:30] the Miracles I want you to just try and
[1:07:32] picture sister Georgie Brewster in the
[1:07:34] services you know she's enjoying the the
[1:07:36] Miracles that are taking place and the
[1:07:38] and the great things that are happening
[1:07:40] the word that's coming over the pulpit
[1:07:42] so notice the scene and the event that
[1:07:45] takes place here
[1:07:46] remember now I said this is in 1956.
[1:07:51] he says and these two ladies at the
[1:07:53] altar how many has been to an altar how
[1:07:56] many came to an altar this this morning
[1:07:57] right so look at this the events here he
[1:08:01] says these two ladies at the altar do
[1:08:03] you realize Now ladies that Jesus Christ
[1:08:05] saves you from sin very simple question
[1:08:07] he asked them he says what do you have
[1:08:10] to do he says nothing
[1:08:12] because he's already done it on the
[1:08:14] cross see he says he has done it for you
[1:08:16] the only thing you have to do is accept
[1:08:19] what he has done for you this is we're
[1:08:22] talking about sister Georgie Bruce this
[1:08:23] evening amen think of this now this is
[1:08:26] she's sitting under these very words
[1:08:27] she's in the service
[1:08:29] she hears these words and she's one of
[1:08:31] these two ladies
[1:08:33] he says accept it and then you're a
[1:08:35] candidate to receive the baptism of the
[1:08:37] Holy Ghost God promised he'd fill you
[1:08:39] with the Holy Ghost Those Who Come Peter
[1:08:41] said repent every one of you be baptized
[1:08:43] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:08:44] remission of sins and be baptized in the
[1:08:47] name of Jesus Christ sorry for the
[1:08:49] remission of sins you shall receive the
[1:08:50] gift of the Holy Ghost we're in the days
[1:08:52] of the outpouring of the spirit great
[1:08:54] signs and wonders he says in the church
[1:08:56] everybody in prayer now he says I want
[1:08:59] to go talk to these ladies just a moment
[1:09:02] I love this I love these secret little
[1:09:04] moments that God has with his people and
[1:09:08] he and then the tape actually records it
[1:09:10] and and uh and and the transcriber I
[1:09:13] believe that's what you call it he he
[1:09:15] actually writes down sister Bruce
[1:09:18] and then there's a question mark and
[1:09:20] there's a blank spot on the tape
[1:09:22] but remember now what he said just
[1:09:24] accept it just receive it and now he's
[1:09:26] going to go down and like we do in all
[1:09:28] our services we just saw camp meetings
[1:09:30] this weekend a lot of this happening we
[1:09:32] saw it this morning people coming up
[1:09:34] ministry goes down they pray they have a
[1:09:36] little conversation they encourage them
[1:09:38] in the word and the Lord and then and
[1:09:40] and and then they have a prayer
[1:09:42] then a couple paragraphs later he comes
[1:09:45] back and he talks to the two ladies
[1:09:47] again at the altar he said about them at
[1:09:49] the altar he says oh isn't this
[1:09:51] wonderful these ladies here the two
[1:09:53] little ladies on the end weeping so they
[1:09:56] come down to the altar they said they
[1:09:58] were saved
[1:10:00] catches now they were saved when they
[1:10:03] accepted the Lord of course he says this
[1:10:07] they were saved when they accepted the
[1:10:09] Lord of course
[1:10:12] you know how many has been to a camp
[1:10:13] meeting and he gave your heart to the
[1:10:15] Lord
[1:10:15] right you went to a church meeting and
[1:10:18] you gave your heart to the Lord you were
[1:10:19] in a Mountainside somewhere you gave
[1:10:21] your heart to the Lord
[1:10:23] they were saved when they accepted the
[1:10:25] Lord of course
[1:10:27] look at the Simplicity of this just a
[1:10:29] regular meeting she happens to be there
[1:10:31] and and she's crying and weeping she
[1:10:33] accepts the the altar call or whatever
[1:10:35] what happened there and and brother
[1:10:37] Brandon goes have a conversation with
[1:10:38] her prays with them right but this is
[1:10:40] for real like this is a real person this
[1:10:42] really happened in our day
[1:10:44] okay
[1:10:46] now I wanted to highlight this because
[1:10:48] let's go through her the rest of her
[1:10:49] story now
[1:10:52] God's showing how powerful and simple
[1:10:55] our Salvation is and we we can underrate
[1:10:57] it sometimes sometimes we don't realize
[1:11:00] how powerful how effective his salvation
[1:11:02] is remember salvation when it comes to
[1:11:04] God it is an absolute complete work
[1:11:06] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:11:09] Redemption
[1:11:11] so he's going to prove to us now how
[1:11:13] powerful this salvation work is
[1:11:16] and sister Bruce is a witness to all of
[1:11:18] this remember all these things that
[1:11:19] we're going to go through tonight she
[1:11:20] was there when all these things happened
[1:11:22] right sister Bruce has a meeting then
[1:11:24] with brother Branham wherein she is
[1:11:26] healed from cancer this is not on tape
[1:11:28] but she has a meeting with brother
[1:11:30] Branham and he prays with her and she is
[1:11:32] healed from cancer that's a pretty great
[1:11:34] event how many here thinks that's a
[1:11:36] pretty big event and so God does
[1:11:38] something great in her life she she has
[1:11:40] a trial a trouble that comes up in her
[1:11:42] life and God comes through the prophet
[1:11:44] and she is healed
[1:11:46] amen so we see even great things
[1:11:49] happening in our life exciting things
[1:11:51] and wonderful things testimony is
[1:11:53] building and then later we find her in
[1:11:55] the service again this is in the message
[1:11:58] images of Christ 1959 so we're moving
[1:12:01] through the years now right he says
[1:12:03] here's a woman sitting here praying
[1:12:05] she's a warrior now listen to the like
[1:12:08] brother Brandon he's not prone to just
[1:12:10] say whatever right so we find here that
[1:12:12] he calls her a warrior you know I love
[1:12:15] that you know we have a sister in our
[1:12:16] church uh that you know when she hears
[1:12:18] things like that or or something nice
[1:12:20] has said or she hears a promise from the
[1:12:23] word or you know God does something
[1:12:24] special she calls it the love touches of
[1:12:26] God Amen and so we can see how God is
[1:12:29] even just extending a little bit of
[1:12:31] Grace to her showing her that that he
[1:12:33] loves her you know it's all these little
[1:12:35] hints and so he calls her a warrior he
[1:12:37] says I know her he says but I can't help
[1:12:40] because that light is hanging over her
[1:12:42] so he's just telling people I know who
[1:12:44] this woman is so it's not a big secret
[1:12:46] that I know things that are going on in
[1:12:48] her life but he's saying she's a warrior
[1:12:50] I know who she is but that light is
[1:12:52] hanging over her so something's
[1:12:53] happening he says that's Miss Bruce now
[1:12:56] miss Bruce he says I don't know a thing
[1:12:58] about about what's wrong with you he
[1:13:00] says you were healed with a cancer one
[1:13:02] time so he acknowledges that she was
[1:13:04] healed he says I don't know what's wrong
[1:13:05] with you right now he says but right
[1:13:08] there at that door the first time that I
[1:13:10] ever told you saw you standing in that
[1:13:12] door the Holy Spirit told me that
[1:13:14] something that nobody knows besides you
[1:13:17] and the doctor
[1:13:18] that's right isn't it do you believe he
[1:13:20] can tell me what's wrong now I mean
[1:13:23] these are very profound events taking
[1:13:25] place in her life he says I know you he
[1:13:28] says I don't know what's your trouble
[1:13:29] now I have no idea because you're healed
[1:13:31] of the cancer but I can't help that that
[1:13:33] light is hanging over you it's staying
[1:13:35] right there he says now I see somebody
[1:13:37] else rising up
[1:13:40] look at how the story unfolds here he
[1:13:42] says oh it isn't for you
[1:13:45] she's that Warrior right she's Dorcas
[1:13:47] Tabitha she's she's that help in the
[1:13:49] assembly he says it isn't for you it's
[1:13:52] for somebody who has got cancer so now
[1:13:55] here's a woman in the congregation
[1:13:56] standing for somebody else in the
[1:13:58] assembly
[1:14:00] he says that's exactly right and then I
[1:14:02] see a woman or something she's a sinner
[1:14:04] or something have a have a habit of
[1:14:06] drinking or something and you're packing
[1:14:08] two handkerchiefs on you for me to lay
[1:14:10] hands on she's standing in the Gaffers
[1:14:13] for two other people in the service see
[1:14:16] she's a warrior he says for their
[1:14:18] Deliverance he says
[1:14:20] that's that's saith the Lord that's
[1:14:22] exactly right now you be the judge is
[1:14:24] that right is that right raise up your
[1:14:26] hand he says somebody back in here oh
[1:14:28] that I don't know raise up your hand
[1:14:30] somebody that I don't know here he says
[1:14:32] what is that raise up your hands again
[1:14:34] right there in the corner there's four
[1:14:36] or five women sitting there do you
[1:14:38] believe me to be his servant do you
[1:14:39] believe that what you see is operated by
[1:14:42] the spirit of God is using this woman
[1:14:46] for all these things all right you do he
[1:14:48] says if you can believe the woman
[1:14:50] sitting looking at me with a little hat
[1:14:52] glasses on white looking earrings says
[1:14:54] yes it's not for yourself it's for
[1:14:56] somebody else and you're and they're in
[1:14:58] a serious condition it's an inward
[1:15:00] bleeding they're in a hospital in a
[1:15:02] hospital in New Albany that's the truth
[1:15:04] so look at how this is moving now right
[1:15:06] she initiated this
[1:15:08] right
[1:15:09] faith is building in the sanctuary he
[1:15:11] says the young woman did you raise your
[1:15:13] hand the woman on this other side
[1:15:14] looking at me this way do you believe me
[1:15:16] you have a desire on your heart you
[1:15:18] believe that God can reveal it to me all
[1:15:20] right you're praying for somebody else
[1:15:21] too it's somebody who has got cataracts
[1:15:24] on their eyes they're afraid they're
[1:15:26] going to go blind that's right he says
[1:15:28] now if you'll believe for her she won't
[1:15:30] go blind if you will believe it
[1:15:33] wow how many is praying for somebody
[1:15:34] else tonight I'm just holding for
[1:15:36] somebody else tonight you know she'll be
[1:15:39] healed if you believe it that's just
[1:15:41] that simple
[1:15:42] amen I love it
[1:15:44] and then we see there's some trials that
[1:15:47] come along her way
[1:15:49] we see these great events and we see the
[1:15:51] you know her being there when the
[1:15:52] discernment's taking place she Witnesses
[1:15:54] these great events I mean what would
[1:15:56] that do for our faith even tonight if we
[1:15:59] could witness things like that and like
[1:16:00] you know I call out a name and and God
[1:16:02] shows something personal in that
[1:16:04] person's life and and shows something
[1:16:06] very specific that only that person
[1:16:07] would know it would do a lot for our
[1:16:09] faith well she was sitting in these
[1:16:11] kinds of meetings but now we see a trial
[1:16:14] that arises in her life and in the
[1:16:16] message who is this 1959 again
[1:16:19] this is five months now later from the
[1:16:21] the previous quote he said we see her
[1:16:24] fighting cancer again
[1:16:26] he says I'm privileged looking upon a
[1:16:28] woman a few days ago who met us and said
[1:16:31] oh brother Branham it seems that a
[1:16:33] dreadful disease that you cursed one
[1:16:34] time in the name of the Lord is trying
[1:16:37] to return again
[1:16:39] what a thing
[1:16:40] huh that that devil doesn't know how to
[1:16:43] give up right he says but I'm resting
[1:16:45] solemnly upon thus saith the Lord
[1:16:48] and when the Physicians had examined our
[1:16:50] sister Bruce they found her to be
[1:16:52] negative
[1:16:54] he says we are grateful Lord that you
[1:16:56] keep your word your promise is so true
[1:17:01] this is now in the message hearing
[1:17:03] recognizing acting on the word of God
[1:17:04] 1960.
[1:17:07] and this is like I say just a few months
[1:17:09] later again a couple months later from
[1:17:10] the other one he says Georgie Bruce I
[1:17:13] see her sitting there you're always
[1:17:15] trying to find something for somebody
[1:17:18] else
[1:17:19] trying to help somebody Georgie says you
[1:17:21] was healed with a cancer no question in
[1:17:24] your mind the day that you come to this
[1:17:26] Tabernacle and walked out that door
[1:17:27] Yonder the Holy Spirit come upon me and
[1:17:30] told you right there some ACT that's
[1:17:32] nobody in the world knowed but you and
[1:17:34] God and another person he keeps coming
[1:17:37] back to that he keeps reminding her that
[1:17:39] God is using you sister Georgia he keeps
[1:17:41] reminding her that you're a warrior he
[1:17:43] keeps reminding her that God loves you
[1:17:45] you know and God's using you and that
[1:17:47] God healed you
[1:17:49] but she's going through battles right
[1:17:52] she's just in a Christian just like any
[1:17:54] one of us
[1:17:57] he says that day he come to the
[1:17:58] Tabernacle and that happened he says is
[1:18:00] that right
[1:18:01] amen he says that's right you believe me
[1:18:04] don't you Georgie you got something on
[1:18:07] your heart
[1:18:08] Georgie you believe God can tell me
[1:18:10] what's on your heart
[1:18:12] would that make the rest of you people
[1:18:14] that know me believe
[1:18:15] the congregation said amen and then he
[1:18:18] goes on he says I know Georgie but she's
[1:18:20] thinking of something she's got two
[1:18:22] people that's away from here she's
[1:18:24] praying for both of them live in Corydon
[1:18:26] that's right and she's got a person here
[1:18:28] a man she's praying for that's out here
[1:18:30] in the hospital and you're praying not
[1:18:32] so much for his healing but the
[1:18:34] salvation of his soul here She is again
[1:18:36] and God allowed her to see through that
[1:18:39] Prophet that God sees her requests that
[1:18:42] she's making
[1:18:44] he says that that's in the hospital
[1:18:46] you're praying for the Salvation of his
[1:18:47] soul that's that's saith the Lord that's
[1:18:49] right that's right Georgie that's
[1:18:51] exactly right look at this this woman in
[1:18:53] the congregation always interceding for
[1:18:56] other people and yet she's she's dealing
[1:18:58] with her own things as we'll get into in
[1:19:00] a minute
[1:19:02] he says God God is not going to forget
[1:19:04] her needs also right she's always
[1:19:06] praying for everybody else and then at
[1:19:08] some point we see in her life how even
[1:19:10] in the in the sermons now remember I can
[1:19:12] only go with what's on the tapes right I
[1:19:14] don't know all the other little details
[1:19:16] but there's enough on the tapes to show
[1:19:17] us really all the things that was
[1:19:19] transpiring in her life
[1:19:21] so now we we see how that she's always
[1:19:23] interceding for other people she's got
[1:19:25] this walk with the Lord she's she's
[1:19:26] working in the assembly and all these
[1:19:28] things you know she's a warrior but now
[1:19:30] God wants to deal with some of her needs
[1:19:32] right God does not forget that she also
[1:19:36] has needs and even brother Branham
[1:19:38] thinks that it's going to be for
[1:19:39] somebody else but recognizes that no
[1:19:41] she's actually praying for something she
[1:19:43] needs
[1:19:45] the message adoption 1960 another couple
[1:19:48] months later he says sister Bruce I know
[1:19:51] you the little nurse that rubbed my back
[1:19:53] knew you
[1:19:54] she's from down there near the motel JJ
[1:19:57] or twin J or something like that he says
[1:20:00] you will stand for others
[1:20:03] and what's your desire tonight from your
[1:20:06] father and sister Bruce says for myself
[1:20:09] tonight
[1:20:12] he says for yourself tonight sister
[1:20:13] Bruce speaks again and then the enemy
[1:20:16] has jerked you he says from Beyond the
[1:20:18] doctor's reach but I'm coming after you
[1:20:20] with a slingshot there's this Blank Spot
[1:20:22] on the tape and look at what the prophet
[1:20:25] is saying the enemy has jerked you from
[1:20:27] Beyond the doctor's reach but I'm coming
[1:20:29] after you
[1:20:30] wow that should do something for our
[1:20:33] sister Georgie
[1:20:35] he says I'm coming after you with a
[1:20:37] slingshot in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:20:39] direct the slingshot Arrow at the Rock
[1:20:40] that's got into the kidneys in blocked
[1:20:43] condition it'll bring you back to God to
[1:20:46] his house so here She's suffering with
[1:20:48] with ailments in her body
[1:20:50] but he's saying I'm coming after you
[1:20:52] tonight
[1:20:54] notice this now brother Branham even
[1:20:55] goes as far as to include her in a
[1:20:57] dramatization of the millennium
[1:21:00] I mean just amazing how God constantly
[1:21:03] reminding her who she is where she's
[1:21:05] going he loves her he heals her
[1:21:08] he says and you know I'm walking out
[1:21:10] there through there all of us walk out
[1:21:12] there sorry I should give you the quote
[1:21:14] it's adoption number two also 1960. so
[1:21:18] just the next message he preached he
[1:21:19] says and you know I'm walking out
[1:21:21] through there all of us walk out through
[1:21:23] there just about 500 years just a little
[1:21:25] journey talking about the Millennium a
[1:21:27] million he says don't make any
[1:21:29] difference see it's the truth because
[1:21:30] there's no time there it's eternity so
[1:21:33] sorry just after the Millennium he says
[1:21:35] and when I go there I walk along down
[1:21:37] through there and you know I meet out
[1:21:39] there you know who I meet out there
[1:21:41] he says well if it ain't sister Georgie
[1:21:44] Bruce why sister Georgie been a long
[1:21:46] time since I've seen you looks like
[1:21:49] she's always looked see she may be 10
[1:21:51] million years old but just as young as
[1:21:54] she ever was she'd be scratching
[1:21:55] somebody on the back and I looked there
[1:21:57] and it's a cheetah and the lion says
[1:21:59] well bless your heart sister Georgie no
[1:22:02] harm can come nothing at all in the
[1:22:04] evening time we'll go on up the top of
[1:22:07] the mountain and say oh papa God I once
[1:22:09] was lost oh I once was in the muck of
[1:22:11] sin powerful God and you saved me
[1:22:16] emphasizing here on the love of God look
[1:22:19] at how he brings her story in every time
[1:22:21] and it's always to do with God loves you
[1:22:23] God cares about you he mentions the song
[1:22:25] oh love of God and you can go read that
[1:22:27] for yourself now here again in another
[1:22:30] message and this is again in 1960 this
[1:22:33] is now one month later in the unfailing
[1:22:35] realities of the Living God we see her
[1:22:38] again sister George G Bruce is standing
[1:22:40] for herself but does not forget the
[1:22:43] other so now she does both we see both
[1:22:44] things together and her sister in the
[1:22:46] church and some loved ones you'll see
[1:22:48] here he says sister Bruce has hurt her
[1:22:50] leg
[1:22:51] I just everyday stuff dealing with
[1:22:54] everyday trials you know just regular
[1:22:56] things right
[1:22:57] sister Bruce has hurt her leg and she is
[1:23:00] also and then it says your sister Bruce
[1:23:02] speaks to brother Branham
[1:23:04] he says she's still in the hospital he
[1:23:07] says am I dismissed he said did you fall
[1:23:09] or something he says she says I was
[1:23:12] knocked off the escalator that's one of
[1:23:14] our sisters here at the church he says
[1:23:15] she was knocked off an escalator and
[1:23:17] she's really in the hospital is it
[1:23:20] broken and sister Bruce answers he says
[1:23:22] oh the leader the leaders and blood
[1:23:24] vessels and so forth and then she is
[1:23:27] standing for some loved ones also
[1:23:30] another paragraph later he says God As I
[1:23:32] Lay My Hands upon them may their
[1:23:34] requests be given to them granted o God
[1:23:36] In The Name of Jesus may it be so father
[1:23:39] for our sister Gertie in the name of
[1:23:42] Jesus also for sister Bruce Lord may it
[1:23:45] be so her request her knee and her limbs
[1:23:48] I'm just showing you the the regular
[1:23:50] life she had there in the prophet's
[1:23:52] meetings all the great experiences
[1:23:55] Amen in this meeting brother Branham
[1:23:57] talks about an interpretation that was
[1:23:59] corrected when it was said again he says
[1:24:01] I I think that's right isn't that right
[1:24:04] sister Bruce this is the message
[1:24:05] respects 1961. they hadn't given given
[1:24:09] it right the the message the
[1:24:11] interpretation he said said that was
[1:24:14] this that what the sign was was to show
[1:24:16] to them like appreciation of them that
[1:24:19] they had believed the message that was
[1:24:21] going forth here at the Tabernacle like
[1:24:23] that and said that they was going to see
[1:24:25] greater things when this had taken place
[1:24:27] that when they seen even angels
[1:24:30] ascending and descending and ascending
[1:24:32] he says so we are living in these days
[1:24:33] in the last days and we're at the end
[1:24:35] time and he says this sounds may sound
[1:24:38] terrible to some but to the to the
[1:24:40] Christians I'm glad that we're here I'm
[1:24:42] glad that we are at the end so even in
[1:24:45] interpretations and things like this
[1:24:46] she's involved she's right there in the
[1:24:48] assembly over and over you're going to
[1:24:50] find she's part of the services in the
[1:24:52] assembly in the congregation going
[1:24:54] through regular trials like we all do
[1:24:56] but how did she start let's not forget
[1:24:59] how she started
[1:25:00] or her story starts with her at the
[1:25:03] altar and the prophet says you're saved
[1:25:06] I mean he declares her saved
[1:25:09] because she accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:25:11] Christ
[1:25:13] let's move on
[1:25:14] I'm showing you these things for a
[1:25:16] reason tonight
[1:25:18] all these amazing things that she was a
[1:25:20] part of
[1:25:21] all these great experiences that she had
[1:25:23] even here in Christianity versus
[1:25:25] adultery idolatry he says God this 1961
[1:25:28] the end of the year
[1:25:30] he says God in Jesus name bless our
[1:25:32] sister Bruce we know Lord that she is
[1:25:35] thy servant
[1:25:36] and that's as clear as it can get
[1:25:39] imagine if the prophet was standing here
[1:25:41] this evening or Jesus Christ himself and
[1:25:43] he told you to your face I know that you
[1:25:46] are my servant
[1:25:48] wow that would that would do a lot well
[1:25:51] she experienced these things you know
[1:25:53] and ministers can come here and say you
[1:25:55] know that that if you accept Jesus
[1:25:57] Christ down the house shall be saved and
[1:25:59] give you all kinds of promises it's just
[1:26:01] that personal
[1:26:04] he says we pray
[1:26:05] that you will give her her request in
[1:26:07] Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:26:10] and then he says these signs shall
[1:26:11] follow them that belief
[1:26:14] a little later on in in 1962
[1:26:17] in the message taking signs with Jesus
[1:26:19] she Burns herself
[1:26:22] it says it right here in the message
[1:26:24] sister Bruce packing that water she's
[1:26:26] getting old father
[1:26:28] time is taking its toll on this little
[1:26:30] lady in the congregation
[1:26:33] and it starts to have experiences and
[1:26:35] things and and she said he says she's
[1:26:38] getting old father and there she burned
[1:26:40] her arms and up and down her body we
[1:26:42] pray for her she's probably hospitalized
[1:26:45] and we pray that you'll deliver her and
[1:26:46] bring her out granted father we ask
[1:26:48] these blessings in the name of Jesus
[1:26:50] Christ
[1:26:52] the message what shall I do with Jesus
[1:26:54] with Jesus called Christ 1963.
[1:26:57] at the end of the year this is even
[1:26:59] after the seals
[1:27:01] he says a lady sat right in here
[1:27:04] somewhere that was called and it was a
[1:27:07] sister by the name of Bruce I don't see
[1:27:09] her this morning but she was always she
[1:27:13] was a very very much a woman to pray
[1:27:17] and this woman come in was last time I
[1:27:20] was here
[1:27:21] and there was no prayer cards given nor
[1:27:24] nothing so there wouldn't be nobody no
[1:27:26] prayer line so they just the Holy Spirit
[1:27:28] just called out over the audience and
[1:27:31] this little Miss Bruce
[1:27:33] she was healed once herself
[1:27:35] with cancer and she just always got a
[1:27:38] burden on her heart for somebody else
[1:27:41] and she was just praying and there was a
[1:27:43] lady from Louisville that was dying
[1:27:45] cancer in the throat and while she was
[1:27:48] praying the Holy Spirit goes right to
[1:27:50] that woman calls her and whatever it did
[1:27:53] tell her who she was told her rather who
[1:27:55] she was and what her trouble was and
[1:27:57] about her having cancer and said that
[1:28:00] she it would be all right and the lady
[1:28:02] went home
[1:28:03] and a couple days after that she started
[1:28:06] choking to death nearly just her throat
[1:28:08] swelled up like that and she gave a big
[1:28:09] cough and the cancer jumped out and
[1:28:11] she's perfect see but who prayed the
[1:28:14] prayer for that lady
[1:28:16] it was just somebody in the meeting just
[1:28:18] an ordinary sister in the meetings
[1:28:20] just there in the everyday kind of uh
[1:28:23] you know motions of what we do every day
[1:28:26] the Sunday and Wednesday and Thursdays
[1:28:28] or Fridays whatever we you know wherever
[1:28:30] we're serving the lord and and her
[1:28:32] prayer is what touched the Holy Spirit
[1:28:34] to go and discern the thoughts and
[1:28:35] intents of that person's heart
[1:28:38] that healing came because of that
[1:28:41] sister's faith
[1:28:42] think of that great experiences
[1:28:46] see there's a lot of amazing experiences
[1:28:49] we can have a lot of great things we can
[1:28:51] go through camp meetings which we just
[1:28:53] did we can have great outpourings of the
[1:28:56] Holy Spirit we can have great Washings
[1:28:58] and revivals and we can have all these
[1:29:00] wonderful things my brother and sister
[1:29:02] great experiences great memories with
[1:29:04] the Lord
[1:29:06] not just being in the meetings but
[1:29:08] literally being a part of the meanings
[1:29:11] she played a big part in these meetings
[1:29:13] if you think about it to see the
[1:29:15] countless lives that were saved and
[1:29:17] changed by the word she sat there and
[1:29:18] witnessed these things
[1:29:20] to be praying for someone and the angel
[1:29:22] of the Lord picking up her prayer and
[1:29:24] healing a person that she's praying for
[1:29:27] believing in the word and seeing it come
[1:29:29] to pass right before her very eyes
[1:29:32] now we want to look at something here
[1:29:35] you know there are very few private
[1:29:37] interviews that are actually recorded
[1:29:40] with brother Brennan
[1:29:42] and simple reason for that is because
[1:29:44] they're private
[1:29:46] but sister Bruce's interview is recorded
[1:29:52] I think that's very special
[1:29:54] she's recorded having this private
[1:29:56] interview with brother Branham and today
[1:29:58] we can listen to him we can read it
[1:30:01] now I don't believe that God allowed
[1:30:03] that just by accident
[1:30:04] right
[1:30:06] so of all the interviews this is the one
[1:30:08] that we have readily available that is
[1:30:10] archived with the sermons of brother
[1:30:12] Brennan to me that's really interesting
[1:30:15] her little interview her secret you know
[1:30:18] to me it's special because you think of
[1:30:20] even Peter in the resurrection God had a
[1:30:22] secret interview with Peter
[1:30:25] secret little interview and you know
[1:30:26] Peter was a loud and boisterous man he
[1:30:28] he recorded everything he told even his
[1:30:31] faults and failures and you know in his
[1:30:33] books he he recorded everything you know
[1:30:35] he wasn't ashamed you know but that
[1:30:37] little interview is private and I find
[1:30:40] it amazing here we have this interview
[1:30:41] that was made between her and this
[1:30:43] prophet and it's recorded for us and
[1:30:46] it's there it's right there in the
[1:30:48] archives of all the sermons of the
[1:30:50] prophet of the end time
[1:30:52] why did God do that
[1:30:55] why did God do that I don't want us to
[1:30:57] underestimate what God did with sister
[1:30:59] Georgie Bruce
[1:31:04] he says so what about this interview
[1:31:05] let's take a quick look this evening
[1:31:07] this interview takes place on a Sunday
[1:31:09] in 1964.
[1:31:11] if I can just get it for you it's 1964
[1:31:14] the seventh month on the fifth day it's
[1:31:17] called private interview
[1:31:19] so it's easy to find
[1:31:22] now he's having this private interview
[1:31:24] with sister Bruce let's just go through
[1:31:25] here real quick now
[1:31:27] with all of her experiences we would
[1:31:29] think man she would be the most on fire
[1:31:31] person in the congregation
[1:31:34] she would have no doubts no fears right
[1:31:36] because of her experiences with the Lord
[1:31:39] right
[1:31:40] he says I visit you in the hospital that
[1:31:43] time
[1:31:44] and I prayed constantly God wouldn't
[1:31:46] that God wouldn't let you die
[1:31:49] because you're a value to the church
[1:31:51] sister Georgie Bruce you're a value to
[1:31:54] the church
[1:31:55] see now I know you
[1:31:57] I know you're going to be all right
[1:31:59] sister Bruce I believe that with all my
[1:32:02] heart see
[1:32:03] that should be enough already
[1:32:06] sister Georgia Bruce says brother
[1:32:09] Branham most of all I want the
[1:32:11] experience that have been sealed in the
[1:32:13] Holy Ghost
[1:32:15] wow
[1:32:16] that's powerful
[1:32:18] after all this time she still has a
[1:32:21] question in her heart
[1:32:23] isn't that amazing
[1:32:24] she has this question she has this she
[1:32:27] wants to know that I have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:30] I want an experience I want to know
[1:32:33] that have been sealed in with the Holy
[1:32:34] Ghost and if God will reveal it to your
[1:32:37] heart she wants to know if she's going
[1:32:38] to be okay
[1:32:40] you mean after all the experiences after
[1:32:42] the the seals have been opened and all
[1:32:44] the great things and we we go through
[1:32:46] camps and we go through conventions and
[1:32:48] all these things here a person ends up
[1:32:51] with even healings and testimonies in
[1:32:53] her life she's carrying the secret
[1:32:55] question
[1:32:56] she wants to know Lord but am I really
[1:32:59] saved
[1:33:01] that's incredible I I for you know if
[1:33:04] you think about my brown sister
[1:33:06] it's an incredible thing that we can go
[1:33:09] through all the motions and all these
[1:33:10] things and have all the experiences and
[1:33:13] hear somebody still have a question am I
[1:33:15] safe
[1:33:16] and we see this a lot even in the
[1:33:18] message people who come up they've been
[1:33:19] attending churches for for 30 years and
[1:33:22] they say I want the Holy Ghost
[1:33:24] and there's a question in their life am
[1:33:26] I saved am I really saved and they're
[1:33:29] asking that because there's something
[1:33:31] going on in their life
[1:33:36] watch brother Brandon's response here
[1:33:38] I believe
[1:33:40] with all my heart that you are a real
[1:33:44] Born Again believer
[1:33:49] that's powerful
[1:33:51] okay now this and I hope to settle some
[1:33:53] things
[1:33:54] uh for for anyone here who may have any
[1:33:57] doubts or fears about am I really sealed
[1:33:59] in
[1:34:00] um
[1:34:01] am I really saved you know she just
[1:34:05] something happened in her life that set
[1:34:07] her off a little bit made her nervous
[1:34:10] made her question
[1:34:11] and here he confirms to her I believe
[1:34:13] with all my heart that you are a real
[1:34:16] born-again believer and yet she finds
[1:34:19] herself in this condition
[1:34:21] Bruce he says
[1:34:23] how could that Spirit just leave
[1:34:27] he says when you get sick you get weary
[1:34:29] he says and you are a nervous type
[1:34:32] person
[1:34:34] oh my this is good he says you're just a
[1:34:37] nervous type person but she's the one
[1:34:39] serving in the congregation she's the
[1:34:40] one she's the prayer Warrior you know
[1:34:43] she's the one that that skin the Holy
[1:34:45] Spirit comes in and will discern on her
[1:34:47] behalf amen and healings take place and
[1:34:50] the throat cancer comes out and I mean
[1:34:52] you're a nervous type person
[1:34:55] wow that's I'm so encouraged by that you
[1:34:59] know if we can go through these little
[1:35:00] things in our lives it doesn't change
[1:35:02] what God has done for our as as far as
[1:35:04] our Salvation goes
[1:35:07] you're a nervous type person
[1:35:09] Bruce says yes
[1:35:12] see and you get things on your mind
[1:35:15] you overthink it
[1:35:17] you just overthink it you know little
[1:35:20] things happen and you just overthink it
[1:35:22] you get things on your mind see little
[1:35:24] bitty things man it's not like she went
[1:35:27] out into the world it's not like she
[1:35:29] started drinking and smoking no it's
[1:35:31] just the weariness of everyday Christian
[1:35:33] walk
[1:35:35] serving in the congregation playing the
[1:35:38] instruments coming to church you know
[1:35:40] just that everyday walk and yet she was
[1:35:42] a nervous type person in all her
[1:35:45] servitude and all her her her
[1:35:46] experiences yet she had this little
[1:35:49] nervous type
[1:35:50] personality
[1:35:52] and it but it caused her to start
[1:35:54] questioning
[1:35:56] it started it caused her to to wonder am
[1:35:59] I really saved isn't that that's so
[1:36:01] precious to me
[1:36:03] you know that God isn't looking at our
[1:36:05] weaknesses huh he's looking at his
[1:36:07] finished work it's already done
[1:36:11] you're a nervous type person yes and you
[1:36:13] get things on your mind and and they're
[1:36:14] little bitty things
[1:36:16] oh my if you're that kind of person I
[1:36:18] say just just I hope this really gets a
[1:36:21] hold of you tonight these little bitty
[1:36:22] things
[1:36:23] he says and it just keeps building up
[1:36:26] both ways he says you're you'll get
[1:36:29] somebody on your heart so see this isn't
[1:36:31] just like evil things this is she's
[1:36:34] she's a real Warrior
[1:36:36] in the congregation he says you'll get
[1:36:38] someone on your heart and you want to
[1:36:40] pray for them and you get up and you
[1:36:42] pray for it and you can't rest till you
[1:36:45] get that person prayed for just so on
[1:36:48] fire just so
[1:36:50] um in you know in passion and in love
[1:36:52] and and just wants to do something for
[1:36:55] people and she gets a burden on her
[1:36:57] heart and she cannot rest until that
[1:36:58] person has been prayed for this is not a
[1:37:00] bad thing but see that that kind of
[1:37:03] approach you know it causes her flesh to
[1:37:06] to battle with her right
[1:37:09] he says that is the real you he says
[1:37:12] that's you
[1:37:14] he says then take that on the other side
[1:37:16] and Satan maybe might want to present
[1:37:19] something to you that you and out this
[1:37:22] way he kind of is a little bit vager he
[1:37:24] says see then God you and you're a
[1:37:27] nature and God works and Satan works and
[1:37:30] then when Satan tries to make you
[1:37:32] believe that you are not see you keep
[1:37:34] building this
[1:37:36] and maybe this and this
[1:37:40] see
[1:37:42] in her mind she keeps building this
[1:37:44] thing
[1:37:46] see he says now this is powerful right
[1:37:49] here he says don't look at yourself
[1:37:54] sister Bruce he says remember he says
[1:37:57] I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not
[1:37:59] worthy of that I think what would I do
[1:38:01] if Jesus was sitting here now and what
[1:38:04] would he do if he was sitting here
[1:38:07] he'd lay hands his hands upon you and
[1:38:10] with his great faith see you would get
[1:38:12] well well I think well I'm a sinner I'm
[1:38:16] not him but I'm I come to represent him
[1:38:19] but remember me being a sinner and
[1:38:22] before God I'm not a sinner neither are
[1:38:24] you
[1:38:25] we got a blood sacrifice laying there
[1:38:28] God don't even see us
[1:38:32] he hears our voice but he sees the blood
[1:38:35] of Christ that's it see he sees the
[1:38:38] blood of his own son it's our voice
[1:38:40] Christ's blood then it's Christ that's
[1:38:42] talking through us to God
[1:38:45] so therefore we're not Sinners no more
[1:38:48] we are Christian I believe you to be a
[1:38:52] genuine Christian woman
[1:38:55] says it again just lays it right in
[1:38:58] there I believe that you are a genuine
[1:39:00] Christian woman
[1:39:02] he says I remember Sister Bruce says
[1:39:05] this is funny because he said it twice
[1:39:08] now he's made it very clear I mean this
[1:39:09] should settle it by now
[1:39:11] right but then she says she interrupts
[1:39:14] him he says I remember the thing and she
[1:39:16] interrupts she says it says sister Bruce
[1:39:18] says sister Bruce says right I make so
[1:39:22] many mistakes
[1:39:24] and I fail so many times
[1:39:27] she said
[1:39:30] oh man I could just we just put our own
[1:39:32] names in there sometimes right he says
[1:39:34] that's why brother Branham then says
[1:39:36] that's why Christ had to die
[1:39:38] so that you with your mistakes it
[1:39:41] wouldn't be allotted to you see he took
[1:39:45] your mistakes your desire in your heart
[1:39:48] is to serve him
[1:39:50] how many here desires to serve him he
[1:39:52] says your desire in your heart is to
[1:39:54] serve him
[1:39:55] sister Bruce says yes he says all right
[1:39:58] he says that's what he died for it's so
[1:40:00] you can serve him
[1:40:03] he says see it's not your mistakes are
[1:40:05] not even looked at they're not even
[1:40:07] allotted to you
[1:40:10] Oh my he says he is your perpetuation
[1:40:13] see he is your sin offering your sins
[1:40:16] are not even known
[1:40:19] you're not a sinner before God
[1:40:21] oh my that's that's powerful
[1:40:24] he says Christ took your sins and became
[1:40:27] you because your desire is to serve him
[1:40:31] it's so simple
[1:40:33] she has a desire to serve God and and
[1:40:35] he's looking at her desire in her heart
[1:40:37] and he's and look at the the kind of
[1:40:39] things he's telling her Christ took your
[1:40:41] sins became you because your desire is
[1:40:42] to serve him sister Bruce says but I
[1:40:45] never had an experience that I've been
[1:40:46] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:50] this is so good because you know we get
[1:40:53] young people growing up in in our
[1:40:54] churches in our message churches and
[1:40:56] they're looking for experiences I've
[1:40:58] never had that great big something
[1:41:01] you know and I can attest to this I've
[1:41:03] never had that Earth shaking you know
[1:41:06] where I was smoking and drinking before
[1:41:08] and now I'm not
[1:41:10] right great testimonies and I love those
[1:41:12] testimonies but see look at this woman
[1:41:14] who is serving God she was in the line
[1:41:16] of duty and giving her heart to the Lord
[1:41:18] and serving God's people and she's
[1:41:20] admitting she's saying I've never had an
[1:41:22] experience that I've been filled with
[1:41:24] the Holy Ghost that I can put my foot on
[1:41:27] wow
[1:41:30] so now what
[1:41:32] now what
[1:41:34] I want to hear it feels that way Lord I
[1:41:37] I would like you know I've never had
[1:41:39] that experience that I can really put my
[1:41:41] finger on but yet I love you and yet I
[1:41:44] want to serve you and I want to serve
[1:41:46] your people and God I have a desire to
[1:41:49] do better and to and to love you and you
[1:41:52] know
[1:41:52] right just simple such a simple thing
[1:41:58] he's told her twice now you're a real
[1:42:01] genuine born-again Christian
[1:42:04] and yet she's still battling with that I
[1:42:06] haven't had that experience
[1:42:11] all right
[1:42:12] notice this he says ordinary ordinarily
[1:42:16] a human being is born in sin shaped in
[1:42:19] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:42:22] that's the nature of a human being the
[1:42:24] sister Bruce says yes
[1:42:27] he says that was your nature
[1:42:29] and then he says it changed once
[1:42:32] what changed it
[1:42:35] she says Christ and here's his response
[1:42:38] there you are sister
[1:42:41] it's so simple huh You're basically your
[1:42:45] desires were changed somewhere somewhere
[1:42:47] along the line your desires have changed
[1:42:49] you want to serve God what makes you
[1:42:52] serve God the devil the devil doesn't
[1:42:54] make you serve God
[1:42:55] absolutely not no he'd rather see you
[1:42:57] out there in the world right so here we
[1:42:59] find that her desires were changed
[1:43:01] something happened in her life and he's
[1:43:03] saying what changed that and she
[1:43:05] recognized yeah Christ did that
[1:43:08] amen he says that's it there you are
[1:43:10] sister see
[1:43:12] John 5 here I've got one more slide here
[1:43:14] for you John 5 24 says verily verily I
[1:43:16] say unto you he that heareth my word
[1:43:18] believeth on him that sent me half
[1:43:21] everlasting life
[1:43:23] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:43:25] into condemnation but his past from
[1:43:27] Death unto life
[1:43:29] I'm going to hear believes how many
[1:43:31] years heard the word being preached how
[1:43:33] many here has taken that word and say
[1:43:35] Lord I believe that is nothing but the
[1:43:37] truth
[1:43:40] everlasting life
[1:43:43] Prophet says he that heareth my words is
[1:43:46] going on now in this interview
[1:43:48] he says he that heareth my words and
[1:43:49] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:43:51] everlasting life
[1:43:52] eternal life and shall not come to the
[1:43:55] Judgment but hath past tense he says
[1:43:57] past from Death to life he says and he
[1:44:00] refers to Saint John 5 24 Jesus speaking
[1:44:02] that's why I put the scripture up for
[1:44:04] you and now he goes on he says so you
[1:44:07] he says you you're you're a Christian
[1:44:11] sister Bruce you're a Christian it
[1:44:14] reminds her again he says I've watched
[1:44:16] your life
[1:44:18] I've watched you under vision and I know
[1:44:21] you're a Christian
[1:44:25] see not one spec he says see I am your
[1:44:28] Shepherd as it was Sister Bruce says yes
[1:44:31] somebody to help you see if there was
[1:44:34] any doubt in my mind if I thought you
[1:44:37] was there was something wrong I would
[1:44:39] tell you sister Bruce she says I believe
[1:44:41] that
[1:44:43] but if there's anything wrong in your
[1:44:45] experience anything wrong between you
[1:44:47] and God as far as I know anything about
[1:44:50] it sister Bruce there is not a thing
[1:44:53] there's not one thing
[1:44:56] and then he says we're going to pray
[1:45:00] sister Bruce says course I'm going to
[1:45:01] die unless God undertakes for the heart
[1:45:05] he says you're not going to die I don't
[1:45:08] think so sister Bruce if it is it's hid
[1:45:11] from me
[1:45:12] sister Bruce says thank you brother
[1:45:15] now this is the prayer
[1:45:18] so even even after all this she says I'm
[1:45:20] I'm going to die
[1:45:22] just nervous little lady huh little
[1:45:25] things working on her emotions or her
[1:45:27] thoughts or her memories whatever it may
[1:45:29] be just emotional wreck you know and you
[1:45:31] can see how the prophet is laying that
[1:45:33] in laying that in all the time you're
[1:45:35] there's nothing wrong with you you know
[1:45:36] God saved you there at that at that
[1:45:38] altar that those many years ago God did
[1:45:40] something
[1:45:41] eternally It's Already Done Right and
[1:45:43] yet she's battling and battling a
[1:45:45] nervous little lady and she's serving
[1:45:47] God and all these things
[1:45:50] hmm
[1:45:52] this is the prayer now
[1:45:54] he says Dear God
[1:45:56] this little woman has constantly
[1:45:58] constantly done good and sister Bruce
[1:46:01] says oh God
[1:46:02] exclamation mark
[1:46:05] he says she has tried like Dorcas of old
[1:46:09] and now she is getting this time of her
[1:46:11] heart which is very bad she says oh my
[1:46:15] but did not your word that we put our
[1:46:17] whole soul and mind in
[1:46:19] say that all things work together for
[1:46:22] good to them that loves you
[1:46:25] then it must be that you're working
[1:46:27] something that we don't know nothing
[1:46:28] about and she says thank you God
[1:46:34] he says it's all for the good for she
[1:46:37] loves you now to the great Shepherd over
[1:46:39] all of us the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:43] and in his name I lay my hands upon my
[1:46:46] sister may The God Who made her and
[1:46:48] brought her it to this earth may his
[1:46:50] spirit that sealed her away from the
[1:46:52] things of the world to be your servant
[1:46:55] may it heal her sick body make her
[1:46:57] completely well for we need her in the
[1:47:00] service Lord
[1:47:01] I commit her to you with this prayer of
[1:47:04] faith my hands laying upon her to
[1:47:06] identify myself with the prayer and say
[1:47:09] to this mountain in the name of Jesus
[1:47:12] Christ be moved that our sister may live
[1:47:15] to the kingdom of God and for the glory
[1:47:17] of God and end of interview
[1:47:22] let's stand
[1:47:33] you know the message has been around for
[1:47:34] a while
[1:47:35] there's been hundreds if not thousands
[1:47:39] upon hundreds of thousands of sermons
[1:47:40] preached testimonies experiences
[1:47:44] vindications
[1:47:46] and yet we still find to this day
[1:47:49] people ourselves questioning Lord am I
[1:47:52] really saved
[1:47:54] and I just wanted to encourage you
[1:47:55] tonight if you had an experience if you
[1:47:58] came to an altar once you gave your
[1:48:00] heart to the Lord
[1:48:02] God God would not cast you away
[1:48:05] amen if you come to God he will not turn
[1:48:07] you away all that come to me right and
[1:48:10] my brother sister you know I think of of
[1:48:12] the Simplicity of her salvation she was
[1:48:15] saved that night it was finished it
[1:48:18] didn't matter that she was going to face
[1:48:20] things later on it didn't matter that
[1:48:21] she would get a little bit nervous here
[1:48:23] and there and her faith might waver a
[1:48:25] little bit know her salvation held
[1:48:28] you know we can lose the joy of our
[1:48:31] salvation but you cannot lose your
[1:48:33] salvation
[1:48:34] that's why David prayed to restore unto
[1:48:36] me the joy of my salvation you see we
[1:48:38] can go through troubles but my brother
[1:48:40] says I want to encourage you tonight if
[1:48:41] God has done a work in your life if your
[1:48:43] desires have changed and you're serving
[1:48:45] God then just have faith in him
[1:48:47] just have faith in him the work is
[1:48:49] already done amen we can get nervous we
[1:48:52] can we can get anxious and we can get
[1:48:54] worried and all these things and and
[1:48:56] even in well-doing we can be weary
[1:48:59] but it doesn't change
[1:49:01] the the grip of God's salvation you
[1:49:04] cannot be unsaved
[1:49:06] amen once you are sealed you're sealed
[1:49:08] until the day of your Redemption and I
[1:49:10] just want to encourage you tonight if if
[1:49:12] you've ever had that experience if
[1:49:14] you've ever given your heart to the Lord
[1:49:16] if you've been baptized in the name of
[1:49:18] the Lord Jesus Christ you know someone
[1:49:19] said to me once how do I know I got I
[1:49:21] got the Holy Ghost and I said to them
[1:49:22] have you been baptized in the name of
[1:49:24] the Lord Jesus Christ if you repented
[1:49:25] have you gone through all those things
[1:49:27] that's required and he said yes and I
[1:49:30] said well then God said so God said you
[1:49:33] have the Holy Ghost God said you shall
[1:49:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:37] it's not simple see we're trying to over
[1:49:39] complicate it you know we try and look
[1:49:42] for a sensation or we look for this or
[1:49:44] wait till the next camp meeting or you
[1:49:46] know we and we gauge our Salvation on
[1:49:48] these things we've got to be careful
[1:49:50] with that
[1:49:51] you know and if you have a nervous type
[1:49:52] kind of character
[1:49:54] just remember maybe you put on your
[1:49:56] fridge somewhere you know
[1:49:58] if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:00] down the house shall be saved you know
[1:50:01] put something on there that reminds you
[1:50:03] that it's gonna be okay God loves you he
[1:50:06] cares about you and I love how that God
[1:50:08] had a prophet in our day have a private
[1:50:10] interview with someone point out these
[1:50:11] little things in her life and and tell
[1:50:13] her it's going to be okay you are a
[1:50:15] Christian
[1:50:16] amen cannot can we say that tonight I am
[1:50:18] a Christian

[1:50:39] that you changed my desires and that is
[1:50:41] why I feel that pull tonight I feel that
[1:50:43] you've done something for me Lord and I
[1:50:44] want more of you tonight and maybe you

[1:50:48] haven't given your heart holy unto the
[1:50:50] Lord well tonight's the night and it
[1:50:52] doesn't have to be an evangelist here it

[1:50:58] and say Lord I I come to you tonight

[1:51:03] Holy Ghost that that people are talking
[1:51:05] about I want that experience with the
