[29:40] [Music]
[29:45] [Music]
[30:21] brother Jason Europe Commission my
[30:26] brother
[30:36] praise Lord God bless you all
[30:40] hey man god bless you there in New
[30:44] Zealand bring you greetings again today
[30:48] forum you it's morning and what a
[30:51] morning it no doubt is we are still here
[30:55] behind you so you're ahead of us I hope
[30:58] it doesn't happen like that in the
[31:00] rapture I hope we get to all go together
[31:04] amen
[31:05] and so but congratulations on a man
[31:11] being ready to receive the Lord on
[31:14] Easter 2020 amen I don't think any of us
[31:19] as I was commenting last night
[31:21] never would have imagined that we would
[31:23] still be here but obviously the Lord has
[31:26] purpose in it amen if he didn't you can
[31:30] rest assure God's not redundant he
[31:32] doesn't waste time life and things like
[31:35] that are very valuable to God and every
[31:38] Jesus illustrates that clearly taking
[31:42] the Bible with so many different authors
[31:46] and written over so many years by so
[31:49] many different people and yet Jesus
[31:51] would say not even an iota not a jot or
[31:54] tittle of it can fail I mean that's a
[31:57] jot or a tittle is even less than what
[31:59] we would understand to be a punctuation
[32:01] so every word that God has given us is
[32:06] purposed and so we're purposed people a
[32:09] man and this message came for a purpose
[32:12] we were ministering on that to you last
[32:15] yesterday morning yesterday I've learned
[32:19] to say today that way it covers you in
[32:21] the morning and me in the evening so he
[32:24] was ministering we were ministering
[32:26] yesterday on God's purpose in our life
[32:30] and kind of as a as a theme because we
[32:34] we found that we are approaching a
[32:36] resurrection that wonderful day I don't
[32:39] know about you but it's been a day but
[32:41] I've looked for all my life since a
[32:43] child since a young boy my parents in
[32:46] the prophets meetings I was raised right
[32:49] into it
[32:50] said it my mother's knee is just a young
[32:52] lad hearing the stories of the Bible and
[32:54] that the tales of adventure my mom could
[32:58] make the Bible live and I tell you I all
[33:00] my childhood heroes were Bible
[33:02] characters and you know my first big
[33:05] thick official big book I could ever say
[33:08] I officially read a big grown-ups book
[33:11] and it was called King David and a man I
[33:13] loved that book and I've never found it
[33:17] sequel there's a lot of books written
[33:18] about David I love the stories in the
[33:21] Bible because they they give me purpose
[33:24] they let me realize that none of this is
[33:26] an accident amen
[33:28] so we won again to thank brother al ray
[33:32] and a wonderful team of of people that
[33:36] he has their brothers and sisters I I
[33:38] said the brothers last night and then I
[33:40] remembered I saw a very lovely little
[33:43] sister playing the piano I could hear
[33:45] brother ray talking but it didn't look
[33:47] like him anymore and so I thought okay
[33:50] he must be in the same room somewhere
[33:51] and I understood it was his daughter so
[33:53] we want to thank our sister and any
[33:55] others who were participating making
[33:59] this happen it's a wonderful privilege
[34:01] for me to be able to come to you we're
[34:03] gonna look right into the scripture the
[34:05] 1st Thessalonians 4 real familiar to us
[34:08] all
[34:09] ah we could almost probably quote it
[34:11] we've been hearing it for many years
[34:14] 1st Thessalonians 4 and I want to just
[34:17] start right in verse 13 and we'll go
[34:21] through verse 17 and then we will begin
[34:25] to go from there all right
[34:28] so I last our yesterday I was speaking
[34:32] on the approach the approaching
[34:36] resurrection and so today I want to move
[34:40] into this term and at a term now not
[34:44] just that we're approaching it but that
[34:47] we're on a journey to that resurrection
[34:49] and now that is going to be a jumping
[34:53] off from where I was so emphasizing
[34:57] yesterday about that you know
[35:02] we're here for a purpose and God has a
[35:04] plan and and our life isn't to just go
[35:07] down to the docks set on our luggage and
[35:10] wait on the old ship of Zion no we're on
[35:13] a journey friends and and so you know
[35:16] this was something that God you know you
[35:22] know really he noticed it and he
[35:25] mentions it to the children of Israel
[35:27] when they had failed so miserably and he
[35:31] he emphasizes to them that I sent you on
[35:34] a journey and it's hard to say you know
[35:36] what you you could almost want to ask
[35:38] that mixed multitude what did you think
[35:40] this was about you know I mean a prophet
[35:44] comes in
[35:44] you're gonna go out of 400 years of
[35:47] slavery according to a promise that
[35:49] happened to our father Abraham and and
[35:52] there was darkness and water turned to
[35:55] blood and and the angel the Death Angel
[35:59] came through the camp and there was hail
[36:01] and there was frogs what do you think
[36:03] that was about do you think God was just
[36:06] you know there for a circus act or was
[36:08] this just you know so so we can go out
[36:11] and just you know start another country
[36:13] no friends it this message didn't come
[36:16] to it to give you better theology than
[36:19] the Baptist now we have better theology
[36:22] than the Baptist we have better theology
[36:24] than all of them but that's not why it
[36:26] came it came to show us we're on a
[36:29] journey to position us in the word so we
[36:33] could be prepared for what we need to be
[36:35] about we need to be about the father's
[36:39] business
[36:39] 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 what a
[36:43] wonderful time what a wonderful time to
[36:47] be at Easter weekend
[36:49] 1st Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not
[36:54] have you to be ignorant brethren
[36:56] concerning them which are asleep that
[36:59] you sorrow not even as others which have
[37:02] no hope for if we believe that Jesus
[37:06] died and rose again even so them also
[37:09] which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[37:13] him for this we say unto you by
[37:16] the word of the Lord that we which are
[37:19] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[37:21] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[37:24] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[37:27] descend from heaven with a shout with
[37:30] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[37:32] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[37:35] shall rise first then we which are alive
[37:38] and remain shall be caught up together
[37:41] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[37:44] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[37:47] the Lord
[37:49] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[37:53] reading of his word as you are seated
[37:55] god bless you amen
[38:07] so from yesterday in the approaching
[38:11] time of the resurrection we we came to
[38:15] the ending and we were showing you how
[38:19] we're showing you the pattern and we
[38:20] emphasize from the Old Testament how
[38:23] that all of those people spanning all of
[38:25] those all of those decades and even
[38:28] millennia and multiple millennia that
[38:30] they were living out parts of their life
[38:33] that Christ would be a fullness of and
[38:36] then we found it curious and and and to
[38:41] me it was it's wonderful to to to loot
[38:44] to see it line out how that you we came
[38:47] down to John the Baptist and we found
[38:50] that from the time of John the Baptist
[38:53] there to announce that he's among you
[38:56] somewhere and then from there he would
[38:59] announce oh there he is he's here and
[39:01] then he would say now I must decrease
[39:03] and then he did he didn't die
[39:06] immediately but he began to fade out and
[39:08] then Christ comes on the scene and then
[39:11] now John with his six months of ministry
[39:14] the Lord Jesus with his three and a half
[39:16] years of ministry by Roman calendar
[39:18] three years by Jewish calendar we find
[39:21] that then then the Upper Room experience
[39:24] and then the book of Acts begins to be
[39:27] written and then Paul comes on the scene
[39:29] and then Paul lives out his ministry and
[39:32] then Paul goes home I fought a good
[39:34] fight I've kept the faith from there's a
[39:37] crown awaiting me and all those who love
[39:39] his appearing was it done note that it's
[39:41] still ticking John is still there he's
[39:44] the last living apostle then he's going
[39:47] to be sent to the Isle of Patmos and
[39:50] we're gonna find that he's there for
[39:53] some years then he comes back then he
[39:56] brings back the book of Revelation and
[39:58] then he passes away and you'll find that
[40:01] all of those years that ended up being
[40:04] decades through multiple ministries John
[40:07] and Jesus and the Apostles and Paul and
[40:10] then John on the island and coming back
[40:12] and every bit of that is housed in a
[40:14] single ministry that comes at the end
[40:17] time and a prophet of Elijah of this day
[40:20] because we're literally introduced to
[40:23] Christ and then restored back the entire
[40:27] teaching of st. Paul and taken into the
[40:30] book of Revelation and the mysteries are
[40:32] opened up to us a man blessed be the
[40:36] name of the Lord
[40:37] now I excuse me I'm hearing like is this
[40:41] microphone catching something it's like
[40:43] something's rubbing maybe somebody's
[40:45] bumping okay maybe it's me I just want
[40:48] to make sure we had an audio issue as we
[40:50] started yesterday it cleared up
[40:52] fortunately we were able to switch mics
[40:54] hopefully today we have a backup mic in
[40:56] case that would happen have a little
[40:58] better audio appreciate all the hard
[41:00] work of the brothers so now we find then
[41:04] that that you know if you just think
[41:08] about everything that I just said what a
[41:12] surety what a Salaam that should bring
[41:17] us because you can't accidentally do
[41:20] that nobody could have planned it like
[41:22] that to send and it's not that william
[41:25] branham made that up I'm just simply
[41:28] referencing the history of his ministry
[41:30] you know it I know it the whole world
[41:33] knows it it it perfectly patterned the
[41:36] time from John and
[41:38] we see with the opening of the seals it
[41:41] goes right all the way to the Ministry
[41:43] of Paul to the book of Revelation and
[41:45] that is the that is that is the
[41:48] masterpiece work and when you have a
[41:53] masterpiece work its evidence there's a
[41:55] master behind it there's a master
[41:58] builder who can build a masterpiece and
[42:02] so we we thank God for a certainty and
[42:07] it was so beautiful in the thing to me
[42:09] that makes it even more lovely is the
[42:13] simplicity of it all and we find that
[42:16] that that God did it so simply and here
[42:20] we have such a dark hour that we live in
[42:22] but I want you to know that we have a
[42:25] certainty of that same simplicity in
[42:28] this hour doesn't matter what's
[42:30] happening to the world they're running
[42:33] in fear they're locking their doors
[42:35] they're you know and I and I'm not
[42:38] against common sense and and and we're
[42:40] even meeting here tonight and and and
[42:42] socially distance trying to follow their
[42:44] guidelines but I'm here to tell you
[42:46] something friends the world is not going
[42:49] to get better it can't get better it's
[42:52] got to get worse so why don't you just
[42:54] go ahead and start today and say I'm
[42:57] just gonna trust the Lord
[42:59] from here on cuz it ain't getting any
[43:02] better
[43:03] I was listening as I was studying
[43:07] approaching this weekend and and I was
[43:10] saw I found it somewhat fascinating I
[43:14] III had a chance to to kind of listen to
[43:19] some some podcast of some of the great
[43:22] supposedly the great minds of our day
[43:25] and the great thinkers and they were
[43:28] they were you know every every topic was
[43:31] being discussed and I had I had a
[43:32] purpose behind it it's not that I do
[43:34] that very often but I was I was making a
[43:38] comparison in my mind to the message
[43:42] that we have from the mind of God - that
[43:46] came through a Kentucky hillbilly
[43:50] let me tell you I've driven through the
[43:53] areas of Kentucky he was born and raised
[43:55] in they are hillbillies and I'm here to
[43:59] tell you God did it that way by design
[44:03] was brilliant it was brilliant on God's
[44:07] part because now you you go and you look
[44:11] at these men find men nothing to say
[44:15] against them some of them I I greatly
[44:17] admired and they they're men of learning
[44:19] and of multiple races and multiple
[44:23] ethnicities and and very brilliant men
[44:26] and you know but I but I realized that
[44:29] one would have this opinion and they'd
[44:30] ask him about a social issue and he'd
[44:33] have an opinion and you know there's
[44:35] this social issue and this political
[44:37] question well what about this going on
[44:39] and and they and I and I and I just
[44:42] listened to them for almost a whole day
[44:44] just going from different one to
[44:46] different one trying to get various
[44:48] opinions and and and I I found exactly
[44:52] what I was hunting I found just what I
[44:55] thought I would find and that is that
[44:58] they don't have any real answers they
[45:01] have a lot of philosophy they have a lot
[45:05] of things they believe are correct and
[45:07] they disagree one with another and then
[45:10] one will sit here and be the armchair
[45:12] quarterback of why this president when
[45:14] Lyndon Johnson and he did it this and he
[45:16] should have did it this way if he did it
[45:18] this way we wouldn't have had this issue
[45:19] and if Kennedy would have did this then
[45:21] this would have happened or we could
[45:23] have had this instead of that and I just
[45:25] sit there and thought what madness I
[45:27] would feel so bad if that's all I had if
[45:31] all I had was men and the Bible says
[45:34] they thought themselves to be so wise
[45:36] they became fools I'm here to tell you
[45:40] something friend in this strange and
[45:42] fearful time we have an anchor we have a
[45:46] surety hallelujah gives us peace it
[45:51] gives us understanding we have more
[45:55] understanding I was saying to one of my
[45:58] grandson's he's making his way now
[46:00] through the church age book I've
[46:02] persuaded him to read it
[46:03] I hooked him in I knew it would work
[46:05] I've made him read the resume first and
[46:07] you can't read the resume in the church
[46:09] age book then you got to devour the book
[46:10] I promise you if you're ever gonna give
[46:12] somebody a church age book make them
[46:13] promise to read the resume first only
[46:15] book I ever say read back first unless
[46:18] you're my mom she always reads the back
[46:19] of a book first so I don't know why it's
[46:21] just her thing so she can't stand you
[46:24] know she's got a she's got to know the
[46:26] ending so so and she doesn't read
[46:28] fiction she reads history but she's
[46:30] always got to read the end first and so
[46:32] uh so III like the back of this book I
[46:37] like the first check book in the last
[46:39] book really well the devil don't like
[46:41] him too good and that's probably why I
[46:43] like him so good but you know I talked
[46:46] him into reading the resume and sure
[46:48] enough it hooked him and I said and now
[46:49] he's he said man I gotta go back and
[46:51] catch that first chapter cuz I read this
[46:54] in the resume and I gotta see what
[46:55] that's all about he was testifying to me
[46:58] today that he's he's going through it
[47:00] you know devouring it and so I was
[47:02] really proud of him and and so so you
[47:05] know we we have such a such a piece such
[47:09] an anchor we and I and I told him I said
[47:12] I said uriah I promise you I promise you
[47:16] if you really just digest that Church
[47:19] age book just read it don't speed read
[47:22] it thoroughly think about it and digest
[47:25] it and assimilate it I said when you get
[47:28] done at just 15 years old you'll have
[47:31] more understanding of this book I
[47:34] promise you then men who have spent
[47:38] decades in Bible theology schools you'll
[47:42] understand it far more than they will
[47:45] ever understand it and and and and that
[47:48] is that is the privilege that we have as
[47:51] believers I was amazed to hear brother
[47:54] al ray using this quote from the rising
[47:57] of the Sun because I was sitting in the
[48:00] back office preparing and I just had it
[48:02] come on my heart to to put this in here
[48:04] this is actually the intro to our church
[48:07] videos on our archives or whenever
[48:09] you're live streaming or archiving from
[48:11] our website then this brother Matt who
[48:14] built our site arranged for it to play
[48:17] began you know and brother branham oh
[48:19] this the quote starts out because I live
[48:22] he live also speaking to his wife
[48:25] because I live he live also and then it
[48:29] comes on right away on our website what
[48:32] a resurrection that was and what a
[48:35] resurrection this is to be quickened
[48:38] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[48:42] Jesus by God's quickening power oh my he
[48:48] goes on to say he was waved to them the
[48:52] word now this is an important point I'm
[48:54] not just reading this because it's
[48:56] Easter because brother Brandon talks
[48:59] about you know the significance brother
[49:02] Branham said there had been many men who
[49:04] had give their life for a great cause
[49:07] many great men good men who willingly
[49:11] gave their life for a very noble ahh and
[49:17] royal cause he says but never was there
[49:21] a man who could lay his life down and
[49:24] then pick his own life back up again
[49:27] there was never a man like this man but
[49:33] he raised for a purpose
[49:35] he raised on a mission see I I had a I
[49:41] had a a preacher say to me some some
[49:46] time ago and he was saying you know
[49:48] Calvary's all we need that calvary said
[49:50] I don't need a message I said Calvary's
[49:52] it yeah Calvary is all I need I said so
[49:55] you don't need the resurrection oh well
[49:58] yeah I mean well yeah of course yeah of
[49:59] course we have to have the resurrection
[50:01] - okay good
[50:02] what about the Ascension yeah I guess
[50:04] that I guess we needed that - okay well
[50:06] what about when he came back and brought
[50:07] his life into the church you need that
[50:09] do uh yeah I guess we need that too I
[50:11] said so you're gonna be a little more
[50:12] than Calvary you're gonna need more than
[50:14] death you're gonna need more than burial
[50:17] you're gonna need resurrection you're
[50:19] gonna need a sentient you're gonna need
[50:21] him to come back again and live inside
[50:24] you hallelujah
[50:27] I said do you honestly suppose I said
[50:31] answer a question for me he said he said
[50:34] well but that that's all the process of
[50:36] Calvary and he said you know oh that's
[50:40] that's all that a man needs and I said
[50:42] okay all right so let's go a little for
[50:44] a little further I said so so if if a
[50:48] man comes up before God's throne and
[50:53] they he's asked about his his worthiness
[50:58] and his his ability to enter into heaven
[51:02] and the man's testimony is this I was I
[51:07] was at Golgotha I saw him I believed him
[51:13] I said that's the Son of God I believe
[51:17] that he's dying there for my sins and he
[51:22] said all of that I said would you say
[51:23] that man being good standing he goes oh
[51:25] yeah he'd be in real good standing and
[51:26] and if he said I just believed Jesus he
[51:32] said yeah that's what he needs to do I
[51:33] said well you better hear the other half
[51:35] of it but then he says but now as far as
[51:38] those apostles I mean I don't know about
[51:40] those guys you know that Paul's kind of
[51:43] strange there's Peter he's kind of
[51:45] ignorant and I don't really like some of
[51:47] their teaching and I don't really need
[51:50] the book of Acts or the New Testament or
[51:52] Paul's letters or John I just believed
[51:54] Jesus I said do you suppose that man
[51:58] would find acceptance in the presence of
[52:01] God and he said well that's a real good
[52:04] question I said you sure is I said wants
[52:08] to go think about that and come back and
[52:09] give me your answer he never came back
[52:10] and gave me an answer but I'm gonna tell
[52:13] you something friend where where you you
[52:15] know people people love to say that you
[52:18] know I don't need a message I don't need
[52:20] a prophet I just love Jesus and I say
[52:22] you know Jesus yes which one oh well
[52:26] there was only one I said oh no Paul
[52:27] spoke of another Jesus that people would
[52:30] worship and he wasn't the original Jesus
[52:33] but he was a he was a man-made
[52:35] contrivance and they would worship Him
[52:37] and they'd forsake the real Jean
[52:39] and because the real Jesus isn't
[52:42] synonymous with his word he is his word
[52:45] and there's no way today to deny his
[52:48] word and say I love Jesus you don't love
[52:51] Jesus you love another Jesus that man
[52:54] has concocted to give you a lifestyle
[52:57] that you can just live any away and it
[53:00] doesn't really matter because I love
[53:02] Jesus all you're in love with is a
[53:04] historical idea of a man who lived 2,000
[53:09] years ago and you're not even aware that
[53:11] Jesus Christ there is the same yesterday
[53:14] today and forever he's risen he didn't
[53:21] just die there he didn't just get buried
[53:24] there he rose and he ascended and he
[53:27] sent back gifts and gave gifts unto men
[53:29] and he lives in his body hallelujah he
[53:35] shapes and molds your life and mold your
[53:37] mind and mold your attitude
[53:39] once you accept his lordship you will
[53:43] never be the same
[53:45] he will make no mistake he will change
[53:48] everything about you he loves you when
[53:53] he finds you saves you and redeemed you
[53:56] and fills you with his spirit he loves
[53:58] you far too much to leave you like he
[54:01] found you so it's important now that
[54:06] when you realize that he's waved over
[54:10] them the word this is an important
[54:12] statement the word which he was was
[54:17] waved back to them on the day of
[54:19] Pentecost so you know we're at in
[54:21] history in the Bible it's on the day of
[54:24] Pentecost and he says it like this four
[54:28] simple words the word made manifest and
[54:33] that's what he calls that he was waved
[54:36] to them waved back to them on the day of
[54:39] Pentecost the word made flesh now he
[54:45] didn't come among them in the flesh so
[54:49] if it was the word made manifest then it
[54:52] had to be
[54:53] in their flesh so now now they become
[54:57] the living word you understand so it's
[55:00] not just about head knowledge or
[55:02] doctrine this is a this is a life force
[55:05] that comes inside of you and now you
[55:08] become the word made flesh that's the
[55:11] Ministry of the Son of Man the Son of
[55:13] Man is not unique to our day it was in
[55:15] Jesus day it was in the Apostles day it
[55:18] means the Word made flesh I'm not
[55:20] talking about the office of son of man
[55:22] that's a prophet that was Paul that was
[55:24] brother Branham that was one to a
[55:26] generation that but that gift that
[55:28] prophet go can still go home like Paul
[55:31] did and brother Branham did but the
[55:34] ministry of the son of man was still
[55:36] alive and it is today it's the word in
[55:39] you the Word made flesh you are the body
[55:44] of the Lord now that's not just
[55:49] something to tickle your ears with that
[55:51] should have impact on your life because
[55:57] he says now as I say it's to be waved
[56:01] again in the last day so again the word
[56:06] is to come flesh come back full brother
[56:12] Branham says in the path of life 1962
[56:16] he's referencing of course Psalms 1/16
[56:19] familiar to us precious in the sight of
[56:22] the Lord is the death of his Saints
[56:24] brother Branham says now the Bible said
[56:28] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[56:32] death of his Saints see that's when the
[56:36] time comes I said he's at a funeral and
[56:39] he's his funeral text and he's he's now
[56:43] he's giving these people in the path of
[56:45] life he's giving them a testimony about
[56:46] when he preached the funeral and he said
[56:49] you know I was I said the Bible said
[56:52] precious in the sight of the Lord as the
[56:54] death of his Saints when that time comes
[56:56] and I said the life is going back now
[57:01] I'm preaching to you tonight I went
[57:04] yesterday and preached you about it
[57:06] Roach and today I'm preaching you that
[57:10] we're on a journey to something now
[57:12] watch this language the life is going
[57:15] back so the life is going somewhere so
[57:18] brother Brandon would say you know that
[57:20] when Jesus you know and I don't have it
[57:22] here in front of me it's familiar to
[57:24] most I'm sure where brother Branham says
[57:26] that he's talking to his disciples you
[57:28] believe in God believe also in me in my
[57:31] father's house are many mansions if it
[57:33] were not so I would have told you in
[57:36] other words I never forget where they
[57:39] Abraham Myra preaching that and he said
[57:41] you know so sincere was the Lord Jesus
[57:45] such a man of honesty that he just said
[57:48] listen if this weren't true I would just
[57:52] tell you I wouldn't lie to you if it
[57:56] weren't so I just admitted to you but if
[57:59] it weren't so but in my father's house
[58:02] are many mansions hallelujah if it were
[58:06] not so I would have told you I go to
[58:09] prepare a place that where I am you can
[58:12] be also
[58:12] I love that scripture because it really
[58:17] speaks of the coming of the Holy Ghost
[58:19] more than it speaks of the Millennium I
[58:22] know you're right away in your mind say
[58:24] Jesus says I go to prepare place that's
[58:27] speaking of heaven that's speaking of
[58:29] the Millennium but Jesus didn't say I go
[58:33] to prepare a place that where I'll be
[58:35] you'll be he said I go to prepare that
[58:39] where I am right now the condition that
[58:44] I'm in what kind of what separated him
[58:47] from them because he had the Spirit of
[58:50] God inside of him and it literally made
[58:52] him a brother branham said he lived in a
[58:54] world all to himself he was a mystic to
[58:57] the people that life of God inside him
[58:59] was gonna come inside of them and he
[59:02] said where I am right now
[59:03] that you may be also because if you
[59:06] don't get that life here you're not
[59:09] gonna go to a world there
[59:12] hallelujah so it's all about being
[59:15] filled with the light and and then and
[59:18] then and then it's not you trying to get
[59:20] into a rapture it's the life in you
[59:22] being rapture hallelujah
[59:26] oh my so the life is going back brother
[59:37] Branham said life is a tree we are all
[59:43] hanging on a tree of life that's right
[59:45] see so we I don't have time to just get
[59:49] into this labor too long I I feel like
[59:52] you're following along with me so we
[59:55] find in that sin is is a necessary
[59:59] element for redemption that is necessary
[1:00:05] brother Branham said that it was
[1:00:07] necessary for God to predestinate a man
[1:00:09] who would need salvation in order to
[1:00:11] give himself a reason and purpose of
[1:00:13] being so we find then that sin is a
[1:00:15] necessary element for redemption but
[1:00:18] listen friends once redemption is
[1:00:20] finished then then it's you understand
[1:00:23] when redemptions claims are completely
[1:00:26] finished then the new heavens and the
[1:00:29] new earth opens up at the end of the
[1:00:31] millennium at the end of the judgment
[1:00:33] it's all done death and he'll are cast
[1:00:34] into the lake of fire
[1:00:35] and then John said I saw a new heavens
[1:00:38] and a new earth and then it's not even
[1:00:40] time any longer it's not even time the
[1:00:44] millenniums actually in time if if
[1:00:47] though and that's why you know the
[1:00:49] world's not ending I'm always correcting
[1:00:51] people you find them and in my
[1:00:53] chaplaincy work with the police
[1:00:54] departments and I and I and I'm all time
[1:00:57] in conversations you know somebody will
[1:00:59] say all the world's ending I said oh no
[1:01:01] no no it's just changed its
[1:01:03] transitioning world can't be annihilate
[1:01:06] its internal attribute of God they're
[1:01:07] like huh wait what the world's not
[1:01:09] ending I said no goodness no the
[1:01:11] millennium is gonna be right here it's
[1:01:13] not ending it's just it's just
[1:01:15] transitioning to a new ownership the
[1:01:17] sons of God are gonna come forward now
[1:01:19] King is gonna set on the throne and it's
[1:01:21] going to be the sovereign of the whole
[1:01:22] world and he's going to have his
[1:01:24] royal family who are gonna be the
[1:01:26] administrators of his laws and of his
[1:01:28] justice hallelujah there there'll be
[1:01:31] there will be the world would be filled
[1:01:33] brother Branham talks about heathens
[1:01:35] raised up and an honor to preach on all
[1:01:36] that and and and people who who we rule
[1:01:39] over with uh with a rod of iron brother
[1:01:41] em said you're not gonna rule if you
[1:01:42] don't have inviting subjects to rule
[1:01:43] over so I'm not preaching on the land
[1:01:44] and I don't mean to get down into that
[1:01:46] but we're going somewhere and then
[1:01:50] that's why if you're full of the Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost today and and if the rapture were
[1:01:56] to occur tomorrow for sure you would see
[1:01:59] the 22nd century you will be alive in
[1:02:04] the 24th century I will be alive in the
[1:02:07] Year 26:45 but Jaco will be alive in the
[1:02:11] Year 2027 nineteen I'll be alive in the
[1:02:15] year twenty eight eighty hallelujah and
[1:02:19] then when that's all over then it's on
[1:02:21] to eternity yeah one of the our friends
[1:02:28] you understand what you've been called
[1:02:29] to oh it deserves our everything
[1:02:34] hallelujah
[1:02:37] so it it but but my emphasis is it's
[1:02:42] going forward so your life is never to
[1:02:47] be stagnant you weren't here as I said
[1:02:50] yesterday God didn't say that an altar
[1:02:53] and say okay you're saved great seeing
[1:02:54] that see in heaven you're safe for a
[1:02:57] purpose you're redeemed you're redeemed
[1:03:00] unto God God had a vision for you and
[1:03:05] now it's time for you to cooperate in
[1:03:07] the vision so we're on a journey to the
[1:03:11] resurrection now resurrection is a
[1:03:15] beautiful term because resurrection
[1:03:19] means to cause something that had ended
[1:03:25] to exist again to cause something that
[1:03:31] had been forgotten or lost to be used
[1:03:36] again that's a very beautiful thing I
[1:03:41] want to say it again the resurrection is
[1:03:44] to cause something that had ended or
[1:03:48] been forgotten or lost to exist again to
[1:03:51] be used again so this is why now you can
[1:03:58] understand this is why the Bible would
[1:04:00] call death precious because the
[1:04:06] transition was never to be a sad loss
[1:04:09] that's not what death is about death is
[1:04:13] a temporary sorrow for us I've
[1:04:15] experienced it at a very personal level
[1:04:17] I've got a father and two brothers on
[1:04:20] the other side waiting for me so I know
[1:04:23] what it is to to grieve a poet and say
[1:04:26] that we don't grieve you just said we
[1:04:27] don't grieve like the world Greek you
[1:04:29] know we're because they don't have a
[1:04:31] hope we we not only have a hope we have
[1:04:34] an assurance so the Bible calls death
[1:04:38] precious it's never to be looked at as a
[1:04:42] sad loss the resurrection here's an
[1:04:45] important point now what listen don't
[1:04:47] don't I say all the time don't throw a
[1:04:50] rock at me till you hear me out and it's
[1:04:51] gonna be hard for you to hit me from New
[1:04:53] Zealand but listen the resurrection is
[1:04:57] not merely an event marked on a heavenly
[1:05:02] calendar I want to say that again
[1:05:04] the resurrection is not an event on a
[1:05:08] heavenly calendar that's going to like
[1:05:11] like some occurrence because Jesus said
[1:05:15] when when when Mary when Martha said to
[1:05:18] him he said my brother shall rise again
[1:05:20] and she said yes in the resurrection at
[1:05:22] the last day
[1:05:22] Jesus didn't say oh yeah when the
[1:05:24] calendar hits and that event comes no
[1:05:26] jesus said I am the resurrection not she
[1:05:33] see in her mind she's got a calendar
[1:05:35] event I know at the last day Jesus Anan
[1:05:39] ha no you're missing the whole point
[1:05:41] I
[1:05:42] the resurrection see and so so so and
[1:05:48] and it's a fair question you can say
[1:05:50] well but you know isn't isn't the
[1:05:53] resurrection a translated people yes of
[1:05:56] course yes of course the resurrection is
[1:05:59] a translated people but the trend but
[1:06:01] the actual translation of their bodies
[1:06:04] is the final move of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:08] in the pride because yes it's a
[1:06:11] translated people who before they were
[1:06:14] translated were transformed by the
[1:06:18] renewing of their mind so you understand
[1:06:22] now now got you moving with me this
[1:06:25] thing's going forward you're on a
[1:06:27] journey we're approaching something
[1:06:30] you're moving along and God's will
[1:06:33] you're not here just killing time
[1:06:36] hallelujah your life isn't meaningless I
[1:06:39] don't care it doesn't matter if you have
[1:06:41] the lowliest job and brother branham
[1:06:44] said if you're just a foot wash flunky
[1:06:47] I'm here to tell you I don't love dope
[1:06:49] in that foot wash flunky who gotta who
[1:06:52] had the opportunity to wash the feet of
[1:06:55] the master
[1:06:56] oh I never passed it up say how do you
[1:07:00] know you wouldn't have passed it up then
[1:07:01] cuz I don't pass it up now hallelujah so
[1:07:07] so now you're understanding you're
[1:07:10] you're approaching you're moving life is
[1:07:14] going back we're going somewhere you're
[1:07:19] on a journey see so in this journey
[1:07:24] there's a process it's a it's a birth
[1:07:27] and it's a growth and it's a girl it's a
[1:07:30] maintenance and and God is a my jesus
[1:07:33] said my father is the gardener my father
[1:07:37] is the farmer my father is the
[1:07:40] husbandman see
[1:07:44] so yes it's a translated people it's a
[1:07:48] people who before they are translated
[1:07:51] they're transformed
[1:07:54] by the renewing of their mind you're
[1:07:56] never gonna face you're never gonna get
[1:07:58] the translation without transformation
[1:08:01] hallelujah how did they get transformed
[1:08:04] because they believed the report they
[1:08:07] heard the voice of their day hallelujah
[1:08:11] just like in any age whoever heard the
[1:08:13] voice of the day and believed it that
[1:08:15] was a transforming experience in their
[1:08:19] life and if it didn't transform you then
[1:08:24] you didn't experience the voice say
[1:08:28] that's an odd term experience the voice
[1:08:30] you know hang on hang on
[1:08:34] it's got to be an experience the whole
[1:08:40] world has the ability to listen to all
[1:08:43] 1200 tapes
[1:08:45] see that doesn't mean it'll never be an
[1:08:47] experience for him they could even
[1:08:50] actually believe the doctrine of it
[1:08:53] brother Branham made it very clear this
[1:08:56] was a you talking about a a top-secret
[1:09:00] military intelligence this was
[1:09:03] classified top-secret Satan had never
[1:09:07] told anybody this just like back in the
[1:09:10] day when he when he had a plan in his
[1:09:12] heart - - I will be like God I will
[1:09:16] ascend I will be above the stars of
[1:09:18] heaven he never want anybody to know
[1:09:20] that but a prophet discerned the secret
[1:09:22] of his heart and wrote it in the book
[1:09:24] and then a prophet comes along in this
[1:09:27] day now Satan's got another secret at
[1:09:29] the end time he don't want nobody to
[1:09:30] know and brother Branham discerning as a
[1:09:33] prophet would says you see friends Satan
[1:09:36] doesn't care how religious you are he
[1:09:40] imagines Satan like shut him up somebody
[1:09:43] don't say that to them Oh
[1:09:47] further Satan not only not only that but
[1:09:51] Satan he doesn't not only does he not
[1:09:53] care how religious you are
[1:09:54] he doesn't care how right you are in
[1:09:57] your doctrine because here's what he
[1:10:01] knows that I can hear all the devil I
[1:10:03] can hear sloughs we're going now what he
[1:10:06] knows is that he didn't want you to know
[1:10:08] that a prophet revealed is if you missed
[1:10:12] that life you won't come up anyway
[1:10:16] so he doesn't care how religious you are
[1:10:19] he'll let you go to church he'll help
[1:10:21] you go to church he'll find your car
[1:10:24] keys for you he'll help you he doesn't
[1:10:26] care he doesn't care if you sit and
[1:10:28] memorize quotes and memorize scriptures
[1:10:31] he doesn't care what kind of belt buckle
[1:10:33] you have or what a kind of vehicle you
[1:10:34] drive
[1:10:35] he doesn't care who you went hunting or
[1:10:37] fishing with he will help you do those
[1:10:39] things and what he's trying to prevent
[1:10:40] is you becoming an experience that that
[1:10:44] voice becomes a living reality see so
[1:10:52] your journey to the resurrection begins
[1:10:55] with the revelation of the word for your
[1:10:57] day it's not merely doctrinal training
[1:11:00] or teaching but it's Christ revealing
[1:11:03] himself to you personally
[1:11:07] now watch our brother Brennan brings
[1:11:10] this out in the breach between the ages
[1:11:14] and the seals brother Branham says now
[1:11:18] seven seals on the book has these seven
[1:11:25] seals has the book sealed see the book
[1:11:29] is absolutely sealed do you see it the
[1:11:31] book is absolutely a sealed book until
[1:11:34] the seven seals is broken it is sealed
[1:11:37] up with seven seals he says now that's
[1:11:41] different from the seven thunders see
[1:11:45] now brother branham makes he caught and
[1:11:49] it wasn't obvious to everybody at the
[1:11:52] moment until he actually quotes it later
[1:11:55] but brother Branham is already catching
[1:11:57] that the thunders are the mysteries
[1:12:00] contained in the seven seals and even if
[1:12:03] he's not as aware of it at this time
[1:12:05] until because he doesn't even know he
[1:12:07] says no I don't know what that first
[1:12:08] seal is and
[1:12:09] when he preached diversity said I don't
[1:12:11] know what the second one is and they
[1:12:12] preach the sanguine I don't know what
[1:12:13] the third one is I'm just relying on him
[1:12:15] and night after night that angel comes
[1:12:17] in and and reveals these things and so I
[1:12:20] understand it's progressive to him and
[1:12:23] it's progressive to him even after the
[1:12:24] seals were over it's two years later
[1:12:27] he's standing preaching what is the
[1:12:29] attraction on the mountain and he's
[1:12:31] looking back and he's saying my do you
[1:12:33] realize what happened back there in the
[1:12:35] Coronado far as this Mini Mouse this
[1:12:38] direction from Tucson a setting of
[1:12:40] history a setting of prophecy brother
[1:12:42] branham is all thrilled all over again
[1:12:44] realizing what really took place do you
[1:12:47] realize what really took place back
[1:12:49] there it's the word becoming clear the
[1:12:54] word now made made manifest that's what
[1:12:56] it always was always God's purpose so he
[1:13:02] goes on he says this is seven seals on
[1:13:05] the book and the book will nod the seals
[1:13:08] will not be released until the message
[1:13:09] of the seventh angel sea so we are
[1:13:14] presuming but that but watch this
[1:13:16] but the genuine revelation of God will
[1:13:21] be made perfect in that sounding and
[1:13:26] vindicated truth now that's exactly what
[1:13:28] the word said the mystery should be
[1:13:31] finished at that time and the seven
[1:13:33] sealed book remember it was closed here
[1:13:35] in revelation fifth chapter in
[1:13:37] Revelations the 10th chapter it's open
[1:13:40] so now what's it going to be a genuine
[1:13:44] revelation is going to bring a
[1:13:46] perfection brother branham makes a
[1:13:48] mention of that I don't have it here in
[1:13:50] front of me but how that those ages they
[1:13:52] they never could come to that perfection
[1:13:54] because they didn't have the perfecting
[1:13:56] message it hadn't been restored
[1:13:58] certainly Paul had it in his day but the
[1:14:01] church fell away and now Christ must and
[1:14:04] you know they're perfectly qualified to
[1:14:07] go in the rapture they've got the
[1:14:08] abstract title they've got the token
[1:14:10] they've got the deed of life they've got
[1:14:12] the perfect word they've got everything
[1:14:16] I had a preacher say to me some time ago
[1:14:18] and he said oh but brother you
[1:14:21] understand brother Branham
[1:14:22] brought us a deeper understanding than
[1:14:24] Paul had I'm like how where what and I
[1:14:29] said okay brother excuse me but what
[1:14:33] exactly what scripture would you refer
[1:14:37] me to that teaches me that every
[1:14:41] scripture I read tells me it's a
[1:14:44] restoration back to something that it's
[1:14:47] a restoration of the original the Omegas
[1:14:51] being restored back to the Alpha back to
[1:14:54] the book of Acts back to the original
[1:14:56] faith of the fathers I said beyond that
[1:15:00] I said please tell me which doctrine in
[1:15:04] the message that brother Branham ever
[1:15:07] preached is not founded on what Paul
[1:15:10] taught which one predestination election
[1:15:14] are you kidding
[1:15:15] marriage and divorce who is this
[1:15:17] Melchizedek the rapture mystery I'm read
[1:15:22] to you pose understanding of the rapture
[1:15:24] mystery I mean what would the Godhead
[1:15:27] baptism please the original sin which
[1:15:31] one are you going to point me to which
[1:15:33] and and the Wonder millions who stood
[1:15:36] there when he said I only ever preached
[1:15:38] what Paul preached and they shouted
[1:15:40] we're resting on that that's why we
[1:15:45] don't need an eighth messenger or an
[1:15:47] eighth age or another super preacher to
[1:15:49] stand up we've got the the full word
[1:15:52] restored and the and the only thing that
[1:15:55] we're doing that's more than what they
[1:15:57] had is we're fulfilling things that were
[1:15:59] left in prophecy sure of course they
[1:16:03] didn't fulfill it all they fell away
[1:16:04] Paul said it would happen it did happen
[1:16:06] and instead of instead of Christ not had
[1:16:09] to happen in the larger sense I get the
[1:16:10] fifty thousand foot view brother branham
[1:16:13] said that seed had to go into the ground
[1:16:14] it had to so in that sense no they
[1:16:17] couldn't go in the rapture that's not my
[1:16:19] point my point is they had all they had
[1:16:21] the gene they had the abstract they had
[1:16:23] the Jubilee that everything the prophets
[1:16:26] had said would come and that's why we're
[1:16:28] restored so when that church begins to
[1:16:30] go off which is why brother Branham
[1:16:33] doesn't he
[1:16:33] start the church ages until they start
[1:16:36] falling away he says those first few
[1:16:38] years it was perfect word and we've been
[1:16:41] restored back to that and now we pick up
[1:16:44] where they decline and we take it on up
[1:16:46] to the rad resurrection of our bodies
[1:16:51] sure of course there were things in the
[1:16:54] book of Revelation Paul wasn't even
[1:16:56] alive when the book of Revelation was
[1:16:58] written I understand there's things left
[1:17:00] in prophecy of course there are things
[1:17:02] that are unique to this hour
[1:17:04] absolutely I've won hundreds in believe
[1:17:07] that first of all there there this is
[1:17:10] the day of the seventh age the seventh
[1:17:12] angel this is the day of Satan's Eden
[1:17:18] this is the day when Lucifer is the god
[1:17:22] of this evil age brother Brenda makes it
[1:17:25] clear that was not in vain this was the
[1:17:26] only age that's ever said that about so
[1:17:29] I understand that this the only age that
[1:17:31] ever put Christ out of the church I
[1:17:33] fully understand that there were things
[1:17:36] that didn't get fulfilled back there and
[1:17:38] they're being fulfilled in this hour
[1:17:39] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:17:41] and I know that they didn't go in a
[1:17:43] rapture they didn't get a body change we
[1:17:44] will hallelujah in fact is us finishing
[1:17:49] where they fell off is what's going to
[1:17:52] bring the dead out of the graves
[1:17:54] hallelujah the perfection of this bride
[1:17:57] hallelujah
[1:17:58] we'll bring those from the grave who had
[1:18:01] to go into the grave because the seed
[1:18:03] had to go in and otherwise it abided
[1:18:05] alone jesus said that and brother and
[1:18:07] said I had to go into the ground it had
[1:18:09] to happen so I get that I understand it
[1:18:12] completely but sometimes people say
[1:18:17] sometimes people say oh but we're the
[1:18:21] final voice to the final age well no
[1:18:24] kidding but I wonder if sometimes people
[1:18:28] stop and think why that's true why are
[1:18:32] you the final voice to the final age
[1:18:35] because brother Branham said the bride
[1:18:38] under her messenger because that
[1:18:42] messenger who we are under restored back
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:46] original words of the original voice for
[1:18:50] all the ages
[1:18:51] Paul was Paul was the final voice to all
[1:18:56] the ages Paul said that Paul said if
[1:19:01] even an angel if anybody I don't care
[1:19:05] who it is even if I come back and preach
[1:19:08] any other thing than what I have
[1:19:10] preached let him be accursed
[1:19:12] Paul said very boldly that in the day
[1:19:15] when God will judge the world by Jesus
[1:19:17] Christ he will judge them according to
[1:19:20] my gospel Paul was the final will and
[1:19:23] testament of God on teaching and because
[1:19:26] that was lost it was able to be restored
[1:19:28] and a prophet come back to restore that
[1:19:31] voice which made him the final voice and
[1:19:34] now we under him are the last and final
[1:19:37] voice because we've had the restoration
[1:19:40] of the full voice and now we're moving
[1:19:46] into realms of of prophetic fulfillment
[1:19:49] that that age never could fulfill
[1:19:51] because they died they went into the
[1:19:53] ground Wow I don't know why I got wind
[1:19:57] down that path amen
[1:19:59] I apologize for the owl ray for taking
[1:20:02] such doctrinal positions if I broke
[1:20:03] something you can fix it amen hey man
[1:20:06] hallelujah so god bless see my brother
[1:20:10] alright I just got excited there but
[1:20:12] it's it you understand then that this is
[1:20:15] it's so important because because John
[1:20:19] John heard a great declaration from
[1:20:22] heaven and and he heard an uttering of
[1:20:27] voices that John described as seven
[1:20:31] thunders uttering their voices so you
[1:20:35] have to understand John experienced the
[1:20:39] thunders sounding it's just like Moses
[1:20:41] Moses stood there at the mountain and
[1:20:44] God was speaking and and and the people
[1:20:50] said it sounds like thunder and mode and
[1:20:51] they were afraid and they there because
[1:20:54] that mixed multitude and they were
[1:20:56] falling backwards and Moses like no
[1:20:58] tomorrow
[1:20:59] no no no don't don't go away he's he
[1:21:02] wants to talk to you he's trying to
[1:21:04] speak you all know Moses no it's too
[1:21:07] scary for us and but you understand that
[1:21:09] when Moses heard that voice of God it
[1:21:13] was an experience it wasn't something
[1:21:15] that just affected his eardrums
[1:21:17] everybody else I ran in fear but to
[1:21:20] Moses it was an experience it was a
[1:21:23] thunder and that's what you've heard
[1:21:25] today you've heard a thunder because
[1:21:27] you've had an experience and when you've
[1:21:29] had an experience that's a thunder
[1:21:32] hallelujah you literally become the
[1:21:35] voice that was speaking in a manifested
[1:21:38] form
[1:21:39] you're now a Vindicator that's my
[1:21:41] brother Brendan so I read that for you
[1:21:43] that's why he said it's a vindicated God
[1:21:45] will be made perfect in that sounding
[1:21:48] and vindicated truth God will be made
[1:21:50] perfect you think God wasn't already
[1:21:53] perfect within his own self it's not
[1:21:55] about God being perfect it's about a
[1:21:57] completion it's about a cycle that's
[1:22:00] coming to the last say stages of Earth's
[1:22:03] history and it's about the translator
[1:22:06] bride at the molecular level and take
[1:22:09] her off the earth hallelujah oh my see
[1:22:17] so the mystery of the rapture then so
[1:22:22] because you had an experience and you
[1:22:25] know what
[1:22:26] from that day it didn't matter I want to
[1:22:30] tell you when you have when you have
[1:22:32] that kind of experience then that
[1:22:34] Thunder has taken on more than just
[1:22:37] information it's taken on more than just
[1:22:39] theology it's taken on more than just
[1:22:42] doctrinal teaching because the thunders
[1:22:45] were the mysteries that we came out of
[1:22:47] the seven seals and the whole world
[1:22:49] heard that and they can even believe it
[1:22:51] and even brother Branham said that
[1:22:53] doesn't mean they're saved even the
[1:22:55] devil believes it and brother Branham
[1:22:57] said he don't make believe it he
[1:22:59] actually believes it he's not safe he
[1:23:01] knows the will of God he refuses to do
[1:23:03] it the whole world I can't they can't
[1:23:06] resist the teaching of the message not
[1:23:08] using this book that's impossible
[1:23:11] I challenge them around the world take
[1:23:13] one of the doctors that came out of
[1:23:14] those seals and take this book and prove
[1:23:17] it wrong you cannot do it but that
[1:23:20] doesn't save them until this book
[1:23:21] becomes flesh and brother branham said
[1:23:24] when the books are closed for the last
[1:23:25] time the word will be flesh standing
[1:23:29] there hallelujah I'm here to taste
[1:23:32] something friends were on a journey
[1:23:33] that's what this Easter means he's risen
[1:23:37] because he lived you live also
[1:23:42] hallelujah that's what Easter means to
[1:23:45] us glory to God in the highest
[1:23:47] oh my because you had an experience
[1:23:53] that's a thunder it's a living reality
[1:23:56] it's a vindicated truth it's God being
[1:23:59] perfected in you so the mystery of the
[1:24:06] rapture how I gotta hurry so the mystery
[1:24:10] of the rapture is a people becoming the
[1:24:15] word see no wonder their bodies changed

[1:27:03] this life is about the next one this
[1:27:07] life here is only a proving ground it's
[1:27:10] only a training field
[1:27:12] your only trainings I owe my life this

[1:27:43] life was never intended to be stationary
[1:27:46] not even in the Garden of Eden it was
[1:27:48] playlists it was to be perpetual yes but
[1:27:50] not stationary it's eternal it's
[1:27:54] everlasting its unending its ceaseless
[1:27:57] it's permanent its continual its
[1:28:00] enduring its undying its uninterrupted
[1:28:03] that's what life was supposed to be your
[1:28:11] life was supposed to be uninterrupted
[1:28:16] God has always had a plan for going
[1:28:21] forward your life was supposed to be
[1:28:26] ceaseless now I'm gonna turn my last
[1:28:30] corner and run for the finish line
[1:28:31] tonight and again we'll just hit a pause
[1:28:33] button we're not gonna finish so just
[1:28:36] it's okay wasn't intended to be the
[1:28:44] interruption of nature I get that it's
[1:28:46] in God's grander scheme of things and
[1:28:48] men would need salvation in order to
[1:28:51] give himself a reason and purpose I
[1:28:53] understand that we can that's the 50,000
[1:28:56] foot view can I come down out of the
[1:28:59] ethereal and just come right down to
[1:29:00] let's get down to Ground Zero where you
[1:29:02] live because where we live is where we
[1:29:05] have our questions where we have our
[1:29:06] ponderings where we live is where we
[1:29:09] have our fears and our secret problems
[1:29:11] and our troubles and our weaknesses and
[1:29:14] things that we only confess to the Lord
[1:29:16] in our closet that's at Ground Zero
[1:29:18] phrase and I can preach into the 50,000
[1:29:21] foot view all night long all day long
[1:29:23] and it'll thrill you because you're an
[1:29:25] eagle and you love hearing about high
[1:29:26] altitude flight you love being up there
[1:29:30] you're an eagle it makes sense but
[1:29:31] listen when these meetings are over
[1:29:33] you're gonna have to come and face the
[1:29:35] real world you're going to have to
[1:29:38] you're going to have to find the
[1:29:40] wherewithal to believe God's Word you're
[1:29:43] going to have to find and sometimes as I
[1:29:45] read to your life is supposed to be
[1:29:47] under
[1:29:47] did that was what real life was about he
[1:29:51] that liveth and believeth on me shall
[1:29:52] never die he's the bread of life he was
[1:29:56] the fountain of life it was perpetual
[1:29:58] life it was eternal life
[1:30:00] it was ceaseless life it was undying
[1:30:03] life it was uninterrupted life and many
[1:30:08] of us have had things in our lives and
[1:30:11] it's been a total interruption sometimes
[1:30:13] an interruption to our sanity sometimes
[1:30:18] an interruption to our faith sometimes
[1:30:20] an interruption and our love and our
[1:30:22] marriages and our children and families
[1:30:25] can become strained oh I'm coming down
[1:30:27] to Ground Zero today sometimes things
[1:30:30] happen in churches and between spouses
[1:30:32] and between preachers and and between
[1:30:35] parents and yeah I don't I'm not gonna
[1:30:37] stand up here today and tell you I have
[1:30:39] all the answers I probably don't have
[1:30:40] even half of them but I know I know that
[1:30:44] God's in control I know that for sure
[1:30:48] and I can't explain it all but I I just
[1:30:51] know he's gonna make it work to my good
[1:30:54] that's what he promised he would do and
[1:30:57] I'm here and only take some friends I
[1:30:59] don't care how big of a problem you got
[1:31:01] right now I give you my word it won't
[1:31:04] matter ten thousand years from now you
[1:31:06] won't care at all oh when you cross over
[1:31:11] a promise said the first thing that's
[1:31:12] gonna go through your mind is why was I
[1:31:15] ever worried Oh
[1:31:17] Paul said it's not gonna even be worthy
[1:31:19] to be mentioned probably said one day
[1:31:22] you're gonna sit down under a tree think
[1:31:24] about all these things you worrying
[1:31:26] stress over now you're gonna sit down
[1:31:28] under a tree and laugh one of these days
[1:31:32] brother Jack we're gonna laugh
[1:31:34] hallelujah brother alright one of these
[1:31:36] days we're gonna last together brother
[1:31:37] we're gonna be giddy we're gonna be like
[1:31:40] kids heaven I've told my grand jury said
[1:31:43] do you realize heaven is gonna be the
[1:31:45] largest youth camp of all time everybody
[1:31:49] there and the teenagers everybody there
[1:31:52] runnin skipping like lambs
[1:31:54] oh yeah oh my it was supposed to be
[1:32:00] uninterrupted but it got interrupted
[1:32:03] that's why to me the resurrection is so
[1:32:09] precious because the resurrection is so
[1:32:13] precious I want to be on this journey I
[1:32:16] want to keep going till I get there I
[1:32:21] don't want to slow down
[1:32:24] I've had too many interruptions I've had
[1:32:27] too many problems in my life where
[1:32:29] things that I knew that was not of
[1:32:32] eternal quality that was an interruption
[1:32:34] that was not life that was death I'm
[1:32:37] here to take some friends I can't get to
[1:32:39] the resurrection soon enough the
[1:32:43] resurrection again is - cause I love
[1:32:46] that determining word - cause something
[1:32:51] that had ended or been forgotten or lost
[1:32:56] to exist again to be used again Jesus
[1:33:05] says that this one that we're
[1:33:07] celebrating today who rose he said all
[1:33:11] let the Father give with me st. John
[1:33:15] 6:37 240 all that the father giveth me
[1:33:19] shall come to me and that beautiful
[1:33:23] beautiful thing see you didn't find God
[1:33:26] he wasn't lost he found you he found you
[1:33:30] when you were an enemy and your mind
[1:33:31] wasn't even capable of agreeing with him
[1:33:33] and he overtook you I want to tell you
[1:33:36] something friends when the Holy Ghost
[1:33:38] that starts chasing you you don't get
[1:33:40] away thank God well Alou you all that
[1:33:45] the father giveth me shall come to me
[1:33:50] and him that cometh to me this is the
[1:33:54] ones the father gave him I will in no
[1:33:57] wise in other words I will for no reason
[1:34:01] cast them out
[1:34:05] there's not a reason there's no there's
[1:34:09] nothing that his children who are known
[1:34:11] of him before the foundation of the
[1:34:12] world have ever done or could ever do to
[1:34:16] give him a reason to not accept you on
[1:34:19] that day I don't a some friends if
[1:34:22] you're the come from the genealogy if
[1:34:24] you come from the gene of Almighty God
[1:34:26] and you know you have because there's an
[1:34:28] Amen down inside of you on his word even
[1:34:30] when here doesn't understand it here
[1:34:33] says Amen even when here is angry and
[1:34:36] doesn't want to admit it there's
[1:34:38] something down in here going hey man
[1:34:41] hallelujah that ain't that guy is so
[1:34:44] loud he'll drive sleep for you he'll
[1:34:47] drive friends from you he'll get you
[1:34:49] fired off your job he'll be he'll cause
[1:34:52] you to lose all your money
[1:34:53] and all he's doing is done they're going
[1:34:55] to a man a man a man hallelujah I'm glad
[1:35:00] he yelled at me hallelujah Jesus says
[1:35:03] they'll come to me all the father's
[1:35:06] given me will come him that cometh to me
[1:35:08] I will for no reason imaginable doable
[1:35:12] under the Sun past present or future in
[1:35:14] no wise cast out why Jesus for this
[1:35:21] reason for I came down from heaven not
[1:35:24] to do mine own will but the will of him
[1:35:28] that sent me and this is the Father's
[1:35:32] will which hath sent me that of all
[1:35:38] which he hath given me I should lose
[1:35:42] nothing but should raise it up again in
[1:35:46] the resurrection I'll raise it up again
[1:35:50] I will I will cause something that has
[1:35:55] ended or been forgotten or lost to exist
[1:36:00] again to be used again people often
[1:36:04] times when they're quoting this and I
[1:36:05] get in other passages you know wonder
[1:36:07] but John records a little bit of a
[1:36:10] difference here Jesus doesn't say people
[1:36:12] oftentimes quoted all the father
[1:36:15] that all of which he has given me I lose
[1:36:17] no one but it doesn't say I lose no one
[1:36:20] he's already said that in the 37th verse
[1:36:23] and verse 38 he's not being redundant
[1:36:26] he's not repeating himself he's already
[1:36:28] said I won't lose any people but now
[1:36:31] he's going a little further of
[1:36:33] everything that they ever were ever
[1:36:36] characteristic that was ever to be I
[1:36:39] lose nothing I don't care what kind of
[1:36:44] interruption you had I don't care what
[1:36:48] the devil took from you I don't care
[1:36:51] maybe even you're the one who gave him
[1:36:53] the keys to the house maybe you're the
[1:36:56] one that you you ruin your own self and
[1:36:59] you went along and you followed the Pied
[1:37:01] Piper you listen to the siren song and
[1:37:04] you went the way you shouldn't go and
[1:37:05] did what you shouldn't do and look at
[1:37:07] what you should have gauged that in
[1:37:09] thought and said and did and acted in
[1:37:11] ways and it ruined you and interrupted
[1:37:13] you and broke you and starred you and
[1:37:15] stained you it put marks all over your
[1:37:18] spirit and in your mind and you struggle
[1:37:22] to pray and you struggle to believe
[1:37:23] there's something in you that wants to
[1:37:25] believe but you're all hindered you're
[1:37:28] all broke up I'm here to tell you at the
[1:37:31] resurrection Jesus Christ gives it all
[1:37:33] back whatever happened whatever damage
[1:37:39] he didn't saddle most people he said
[1:37:42] these people have my characteristics
[1:37:45] everything that I ever put in them that
[1:37:48] the devil took from them I'm here to
[1:37:50] tell you when the mighty angel descended
[1:37:52] down in this hour Jesus Christ came back
[1:37:56] to restore his family and I don't care
[1:38:00] what you've lost I'm here to tell you
[1:38:02] today Jesus Christ gives it back to you
[1:38:05] now all yata raised up hands and receive
[1:38:08] it and just say I accept God's provision
[1:38:11] I accept the freedom and the healing
[1:38:15] that the word brings into my life
[1:38:18] hallelujah
[1:38:20] see everything his people were to be
[1:38:26] none of his attributes that were placed
[1:38:30] in his wife say by the fall his
[1:38:33] attributes were subject to marring and
[1:38:36] contamination but he loses nothing every
[1:38:41] attribute that God poured into Christ
[1:38:46] and then poured into his bride are
[1:38:50] completely in this hour the effect of
[1:38:55] all of that problems is canceled against
[1:38:58] you and in God's mind you are fully
[1:39:02] completely totally absolutely - an
[1:39:07] abstract title clean pure holy righteous
[1:39:16] you say I don't know Huns feel righteous
[1:39:18] if you only knew what I did yesterday I
[1:39:20] have all these thoughts I'm not talking
[1:39:22] about what you think I'm telling you
[1:39:25] what he has said
[1:39:26] I'm telling you friends if you want
[1:39:29] victory if you want strength then just
[1:39:32] fall in love with this resurrected
[1:39:35] Christ Oh New Zealand let this Easter be
[1:39:39] the Easter that you say I'm falling in
[1:39:42] love all over again I'm accepting the
[1:39:46] word that's what Easter means if it
[1:39:48] doesn't mean that to you that it's just
[1:39:50] another holiday you might as well go get
[1:39:53] on your fishing boat but it means more
[1:39:55] than a holiday to me hallelujah he's
[1:39:58] risen and doesn't he'll have been
[1:40:02] conquered and I've been liberated but in
[1:40:05] the mind of God I can never go back in
[1:40:08] God's mind it doesn't matter what
[1:40:10] interrupted me everything the Archangel
[1:40:13] came to redeem all that was in this book
[1:40:16] along with every characteristic of the
[1:40:19] word that is down inside of us
[1:40:23] everything Satan has taken from me the
[1:40:26] mighty angel came to restore they never
[1:40:30] want to they never want the groom to see
[1:40:32] the bride before he sees her coming down
[1:40:36] the aisle I'm here to taste something
[1:40:38] friends
[1:40:39] when the Lord sees this bride coming
[1:40:42] she's not gonna have all those scars
[1:40:44] she's not gonna have all those
[1:40:46] interruptions she's not gonna have all
[1:40:48] those marks that that's that's what
[1:40:50] that's what clean this means clean this
[1:40:54] clean this means free from dirt free
[1:40:59] from marks free from stains hallelujah
