[1:10:06] to be able to do that with him together
[1:10:11] amen praise the Lord amen i' like to
[1:10:15] bring a a thought to you the this
[1:10:17] morning that um has been on my my heart
[1:10:21] I've I'm type of guy that if uh the Lord
[1:10:25] puts something on my heart then I
[1:10:26] struggled to go in this direction or
[1:10:28] that direction I've just got to stick on
[1:10:30] that and um that's just the way I the
[1:10:33] way I am so we're we're going to look at
[1:10:35] a thought that's uh been resonating in
[1:10:38] my heart and it's not that I haven't
[1:10:40] ministered but it's it's something that
[1:10:42] continues to to open it's it's like you
[1:10:46] you think you've you've come to the end
[1:10:47] of it and then all of a sudden another
[1:10:50] another chapter of it opens up and you
[1:10:53] just continue with it so we we uh we
[1:10:55] thank God for his word amen it's because
[1:10:59] of God in my life that I am here I I can
[1:11:02] truly say that it's because of God in my
[1:11:05] life that I can stand before you the way
[1:11:07] that I am uh it it's it would not be
[1:11:10] possible it is not possible without him
[1:11:14] but but me being here as a
[1:11:16] testimony as it was for David a
[1:11:18] testimony when Goliath went down it was
[1:11:20] a testimony that God that David was not
[1:11:23] alone a lot of people saw that Goliath
[1:11:26] went down but really what God wanted
[1:11:28] people to see that there was more than
[1:11:29] David on the scene and there was one
[1:11:32] there that could turn on the light amen
[1:11:35] so we we thank God I I appreciate him
[1:11:37] with all of my heart I would not be able
[1:11:40] to have the pleasure of meeting you all
[1:11:43] the way that I am without him in my life
[1:11:47] amen so we we thank him just want to
[1:11:50] acknowledge the other ministers in the
[1:11:52] in the church here may God bless you
[1:11:54] your Ministries and uh may may um you
[1:11:58] just continue to serve him with all of
[1:12:00] your heart amen God bless you brother
[1:12:03] Paul I think I saw brother Paul back
[1:12:04] there somewhere God bless you brother
[1:12:06] good to see you here this morning amen
[1:12:09] so the thought that we want to look at
[1:12:11] this morning is uh Rising by
[1:12:15] Revelation um so if we can turn in our
[1:12:17] Bibles this morning to the book of
[1:12:19] Hebrews chapter 10 verse
[1:12:23] 7 and amen it's an honor to serve him it
[1:12:27] really is amen
[1:12:29] Hebrews uh chapter
[1:12:32] 10 verse verse
[1:12:43] 7 this the one verse and then we'll go
[1:12:45] to Colossians
[1:12:48] 2:9 and John
[1:12:52] 13 uh Hebrews 10:7 it says then
[1:12:56] said I lo I come in the
[1:13:01] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:13:06] to do thy will oh
[1:13:09] God Amen let's read that again then said
[1:13:12] I lo I come in the
[1:13:15] volume of the
[1:13:18] book it is written of
[1:13:21] me to do thy will oh God
[1:13:26] amen if we can turn to the book of
[1:13:30] Colossians Colossians
[1:13:42] 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the
[1:13:49] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:13:55] and ye are complete in
[1:13:58] him which is the head of the
[1:14:02] principality of
[1:14:04] power verse 9 there for in him dwelleth
[1:14:08] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:14:13] amen we know who that scripture is
[1:14:15] speaking of speaking of our Lord and
[1:14:18] savior the Lord Jesus
[1:14:20] Christ and uh we'll go to to John John
[1:14:23] 13 verse1
[1:14:34] now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:14:36] when Jesus knew that his hour was
[1:14:39] come that he should depart out of this
[1:14:42] world unto the father having loved his
[1:14:45] own which were in the world he loved
[1:14:48] them until the
[1:14:50] end and suffer being ended and the devil
[1:14:53] having now put Into the Heart of Jesus
[1:14:58] Judas es scariot Simon's son to portray
[1:15:01] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:15:04] given all things into his
[1:15:08] hands and that he was come from God and
[1:15:12] went to God he riseth from
[1:15:16] supper and laid aside his garments and
[1:15:19] took a towel and GED
[1:15:22] himself amen let's bow our hearts this
[1:15:25] morning our heavenly
[1:15:26] father Lord God may you speak to each
[1:15:29] and every individual this morning Lord
[1:15:32] we we can say Lord God that it is
[1:15:36] because of you in our lives Lord that we
[1:15:39] are what we are so Lord God we we thank
[1:15:43] you for your presence we thank you for
[1:15:46] the for the revelation of the man who
[1:15:49] can turn on the light oh Lord God we
[1:15:52] just appreciate you so much Lord we we
[1:15:55] want to glorify you Lord God we we want
[1:15:57] to honor you Heavenly Father we want to
[1:16:00] submit to your will for this service
[1:16:03] this morning oh Lord God may may you
[1:16:07] feel Lord welcome here in Jesus Christ's
[1:16:11] name amen amen God bless you you can
[1:16:14] take your seats this morning we want to
[1:16:17] look at uh these these three
[1:16:21] um portions of scripture that we've read
[1:16:24] from here um we just want to start by by
[1:16:28] here by by looking at uh John 13 and and
[1:16:31] verse um three and four there it says
[1:16:34] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:16:36] all things into his hands and that he
[1:16:39] was come from God and went from God and
[1:16:44] went to God he riseth from supper so the
[1:16:49] thought that we want to look at this
[1:16:50] morning is Rising by Revelation or we
[1:16:54] could say as I touched on it yesterday
[1:16:57] Rising by the Revelation by the strength
[1:17:00] of the revelation of who we are yeah I
[1:17:04] believe with all of my heart that this
[1:17:06] is what God desires for each and every
[1:17:09] one of us because you'd be amazed at how
[1:17:12] many times that you rise in a day you
[1:17:16] rise from bed you rise from The
[1:17:18] Breakfast Table you you you you rise
[1:17:21] from the lounge you rise up out of your
[1:17:23] car uh from your car that you'd be
[1:17:26] amazed at how many times that you go
[1:17:29] from a seated position to a standing
[1:17:33] position in your everyday
[1:17:35] life but it's interesting that I believe
[1:17:39] with all of my heart that what God
[1:17:41] desires for you is to rise in the
[1:17:44] revelation of who you are amen I believe
[1:17:47] he wants you to rise whenever you rise
[1:17:49] he wants you to rise in the revelation
[1:17:53] of who you are and that is what Jesus
[1:17:55] was doing here verse three says Jesus
[1:17:58] knowing that the father had given all
[1:18:00] things into his hands Jesus knowing that
[1:18:03] the father had given all things into his
[1:18:05] hands so if I can if you'll allow me to
[1:18:08] say it like this now Jesus had a
[1:18:11] revelation of himself he knew who it was
[1:18:14] he knew who he was so he wasn't just
[1:18:18] rising to rise but he was rising in the
[1:18:21] strength of who he was it was it was by
[1:18:25] the revelation of who he was now often
[1:18:28] times when we think about this we think
[1:18:30] about Easter and we think about the
[1:18:32] great
[1:18:33] Resurrection the the great Rising when
[1:18:36] Jesus rose from the dead but we
[1:18:39] understand that there's there's minor
[1:18:40] resurrections or there's minor risings
[1:18:43] however you want to put it but we
[1:18:45] understand that this event here in in
[1:18:48] John 13 it had to happen before the
[1:18:51] great
[1:18:53] Resurrection so before the great
[1:18:55] Resurrection which we understand is
[1:18:57] close there are a people that God is
[1:19:00] going to have on Earth who are going to
[1:19:02] rise in the revelation of who they are
[1:19:05] amen they're going to rise in everyday
[1:19:07] life in the revelation of who they are
[1:19:10] you Rose to come to church this
[1:19:13] morning but God wants you to do more
[1:19:16] than that he he wants you to have more
[1:19:19] than that he wants to give you more than
[1:19:22] that he wants you to to the there to be
[1:19:25] a greater meaning behind what are you
[1:19:27] doing while I'm getting up to go to
[1:19:30] church right he wants you to do more
[1:19:32] than that he wants you to have more than
[1:19:34] that he wants you to rise in the
[1:19:36] strength of who you are and come to
[1:19:39] church right so it's not just about
[1:19:42] coming to church it's not just about
[1:19:45] fulfilling the father's will but it's
[1:19:47] fulfilling the father's will or doing
[1:19:50] the father's will in the strength of who
[1:19:52] you are because it brings a whole new
[1:19:55] meaning to church it absolutely does it
[1:19:58] brings a whole new meaning to Parenthood
[1:20:00] it brings a whole new meaning to being a
[1:20:02] pastor it brings a whole new meaning to
[1:20:04] be a
[1:20:05] husband when you do when you're doing
[1:20:08] what you're doing when you're doing what
[1:20:10] you're called to do in the strength of
[1:20:13] who you are you're not just doing it
[1:20:16] because you're called to do it but
[1:20:18] you're doing it in the strength of the
[1:20:21] revelation of who you are because
[1:20:25] Revelation is something that uh as we
[1:20:27] know we we
[1:20:29] cannot uh give it to
[1:20:32] ourself uh flesh and blood cannot give
[1:20:34] it to us but our father in Heaven is the
[1:20:38] The Giver of all Revelation so I I'm
[1:20:43] believing that the thought that the Lord
[1:20:46] has been dealing with
[1:20:48] me uh in will be a a blessing to you
[1:20:53] today and uh uh maybe someone will uh be
[1:20:58] able to rise from the service different
[1:21:02] to how they came in amen cuz that's our
[1:21:05] desire isn't it that's our desire for
[1:21:08] one another is that right but we've got
[1:21:11] to we've got to understand something
[1:21:13] that I can't give you
[1:21:15] Revelation but there is a man who can
[1:21:17] turn on the light is that right so when
[1:21:20] when we rise different to the way we sat
[1:21:24] it means someone was
[1:21:27] present amen and that's the whole that's
[1:21:29] that's what God wants to us to see is
[1:21:32] him he want he wants us to see him he
[1:21:35] wants us to acknowledge Him there is a
[1:21:37] man who can turn on the light there is a
[1:21:40] man who can turn on the light in your
[1:21:43] life amen but you know the the bride has
[1:21:46] this uh ability where a lot of people
[1:21:49] look at the light and they stay focused
[1:21:51] on the light but what the what the
[1:21:53] bride's ey do is they look at the light
[1:21:56] but then they follow the light they they
[1:21:59] find the the man who turned on the light
[1:22:01] so the focus goes from the light to the
[1:22:04] man who turned on the light because the
[1:22:06] purpose of turning on the light in your
[1:22:08] life is that you know that he's present
[1:22:11] in your life that's right amen there is
[1:22:13] a man not there was or there will be
[1:22:16] there is a man who can turn on the light
[1:22:20] amen amen so we are we are um privileged
[1:22:26] people to have a
[1:22:30] man who can turn on the light amen amen
[1:22:34] my Lord my groom my husband is the man
[1:22:39] who can turn on the light there's only
[1:22:42] one there's not men there the prophet
[1:22:45] didn't say there is men who can turn on
[1:22:47] the
[1:22:47] light no he said there is a
[1:22:50] man who can turn on the light there's
[1:22:53] one there's one amen and that's what we
[1:22:57] desire for each other's lives amen that
[1:23:01] the man who can turn on the light would
[1:23:03] make himself known by turning on the
[1:23:05] light amen because he's he's there we
[1:23:08] just want him to turn on the light amen
[1:23:11] so we we want to look at this thought
[1:23:13] here R Rising uh by Revelation and we
[1:23:17] want to we want to kind of start from
[1:23:19] the beginning and and and work our our
[1:23:22] way through uh we understand in the
[1:23:25] revealing of the Lamb that Jesus was
[1:23:28] revealed or introduced to the people um
[1:23:32] by John who was the Forerunner these
[1:23:35] things are very you know these things uh
[1:23:39] John by the Holy Ghost revealed the
[1:23:42] Masterpiece the Lamb of God the original
[1:23:45] Masterpiece all right brother Ram said
[1:23:47] if it weren't for the Holy Ghost John
[1:23:49] would have never known the Masterpiece
[1:23:51] but the Holy Ghost revealed the
[1:23:53] masterpiece pece to John the original
[1:23:57] Masterpiece all
[1:23:59] right the timing was
[1:24:02] such that
[1:24:05] God had to wait until the last Old
[1:24:10] Testament
[1:24:12] Prophet was going to reveal the
[1:24:18] Masterpiece we understand that there is
[1:24:20] a prophecy a virgin shall conceive and
[1:24:24] 30 years later that person was revealed
[1:24:29] not the Virgin but the
[1:24:34] person the Son of God but the timing was
[1:24:38] such that God had to
[1:24:40] wait he that Masterpiece couldn't be
[1:24:43] revealed in Isaiah's time or Moses time
[1:24:48] or or Jeremiah's time there it he had to
[1:24:52] wait and there's a reason
[1:24:55] that he had to wait the same the same
[1:24:57] reason that the last prophet to the
[1:25:01] Gentiles is also a forerunner yes it it
[1:25:05] wasn't just H this seems like a good
[1:25:07] idea I'll just wait till the last one no
[1:25:09] there was actually a purpose behind it
[1:25:12] because God just doesn't do something to
[1:25:14] do something but God does things God
[1:25:18] does things
[1:25:19] purposely amen and not not just to do it
[1:25:22] to do it but to do it purposely they say
[1:25:26] okay so God couldn't become flesh as it
[1:25:30] was in Jesus in the Days of
[1:25:33] Elijah he couldn't become flesh in the
[1:25:36] days of Jeremiah he couldn't become
[1:25:38] flesh in the days of Moses because he
[1:25:41] was the Fulfillment of the spoken word
[1:25:44] of the Old Testament
[1:25:46] prophets okay he was the Fulfillment of
[1:25:49] that word he was the manifestation of
[1:25:52] that word so the the word had to be
[1:25:55] spoken before the word became manifest
[1:25:58] that's right all right it's the same if
[1:26:00] you go to Genesis uh chapter 1 it says
[1:26:03] let there be light there was not light
[1:26:05] before God said let there be light it
[1:26:08] had to be spoken and then the light came
[1:26:10] forth all right so the word the if you
[1:26:13] can catch the the the way that God works
[1:26:16] here the word had to be spoken first yes
[1:26:21] and once the word was spoken
[1:26:24] then the manifestation came amen all
[1:26:27] right the the scripture tells us in
[1:26:28] Ephesians it says all things were made
[1:26:31] by him and for him by him means by the
[1:26:35] word by the word everything that is made
[1:26:38] was made by the spoken word of God so
[1:26:42] nothing that is made is not made by the
[1:26:46] spoken word it's all made by the spoken
[1:26:48] word it's not a part of this and a part
[1:26:50] of that it's all the word all right so
[1:26:53] Jes J is God becoming flesh he could not
[1:26:56] become flesh until that word had been
[1:27:01] spoken the prophet of God says in uh
[1:27:04] Christ is identified he says when Jesus
[1:27:08] come he was the
[1:27:11] word so was Moses the word Moses the
[1:27:15] rest of the prophets was the word but
[1:27:17] they were the word in
[1:27:20] portion he was the word in full he was
[1:27:24] the fullness of the word he was the word
[1:27:28] all right so now we're we're not talking
[1:27:31] about someone in a as it was in Moses
[1:27:34] we're talking about someone greater than
[1:27:36] Moses all right because now we're
[1:27:38] talking about our Lord we're talking
[1:27:41] about our original Masterpiece we're
[1:27:43] talking about the fullness of the word
[1:27:46] amen he was the fullness of the word he
[1:27:50] was he was all the prophets made in one
[1:27:55] us even that right now the prophet of
[1:28:00] God drops these little things in here
[1:28:02] like the plus even that and we we we'll
[1:28:04] get to that Lord willing as we go
[1:28:06] through but he was all the words he was
[1:28:10] all the prophets made in one plus even
[1:28:14] that so he was not just the Old
[1:28:17] Testament
[1:28:18] prophets but he was also the new the
[1:28:21] word of the New Testament prophets
[1:28:25] cuz he was the fullness of the word he
[1:28:28] was all the word the prophets was just
[1:28:30] the word to their age but he was the
[1:28:32] word to all
[1:28:36] ages amen he was God himself coming down
[1:28:40] and manifested in a h in a body of Flesh
[1:28:44] the word made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:28:48] amen so he wasn't just the Old Testament
[1:28:51] prophet's word but he was the word of
[1:28:54] all prophets he was the word to of all
[1:28:58] ages amen meaning that he was the word
[1:29:02] of this age that's right is that right
[1:29:05] he was the word of this age he he was
[1:29:09] the word of all ages amen meaning that
[1:29:13] he was the first 2 third fourth fifth
[1:29:15] 6th seventh he was all he was the word
[1:29:18] of all ages so we could say it like this
[1:29:21] he was both the Old Testament and the
[1:29:23] New Testament
[1:29:24] yes he was not just the Old Testament
[1:29:27] but he was both the Old and the new
[1:29:32] amen notice he was the word made light
[1:29:35] and become light the word in that
[1:29:38] generation he was the he was the word of
[1:29:41] that generation because the prophets of
[1:29:44] old had spoke of
[1:29:46] him and he come and Vindicated he was
[1:29:51] the light of God's spoken word see all
[1:29:55] the prophets had said had been fulfilled
[1:30:00] in
[1:30:01] him see the prophets back here with were
[1:30:07] the word like God was at the beginning
[1:30:11] when he said let there be light and
[1:30:13] Light Came now the prophet said a virgin
[1:30:16] shall conceive bring forth the son they
[1:30:18] shall call his name Emmanuel for it'll
[1:30:21] be God With Us now had
[1:30:25] spoken the word went out but he was the
[1:30:30] light what was he the
[1:30:33] Fulfillment Hallelujah he was the
[1:30:37] Fulfillment of that word he was the
[1:30:42] manifestation of that word okay so so we
[1:30:48] see that the word had to be
[1:30:51] spoken and then they came
[1:30:55] manifestation the word was spoken and
[1:30:58] then there came a
[1:30:59] manifestation of that which was spoken
[1:31:03] that's why he could pick up the book in
[1:31:06] uh Luke 4 and read and say this day this
[1:31:10] scripture is
[1:31:11] fulfilled is that right because he was
[1:31:14] the
[1:31:15] Fulfillment of this of the word of the
[1:31:18] prophets all right so we see that he
[1:31:21] couldn't come earlier he was the
[1:31:24] manifestation of that word he could not
[1:31:27] be the manifestation of that word until
[1:31:31] every Old Testament Prophet that God had
[1:31:34] ordained to speak had
[1:31:37] spoke so God has a
[1:31:41] time and God has a
[1:31:43] season go that that's why God said
[1:31:46] through Isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[1:31:49] but 600 years
[1:31:52] later the virgin conceived there was a
[1:31:56] purpose it wasn't just go I'll just wait
[1:31:59] 600 years no God knew that there are
[1:32:01] prophets to come after Isaiah but the
[1:32:04] word still had to be spoken but we
[1:32:08] understand God we we we are able to we
[1:32:11] are given God's thinking we understand
[1:32:13] why he had to wait we understand why he
[1:32:16] had to wait for 600 years because there
[1:32:18] were other prophets to follow so the
[1:32:22] word of God had had not been entirely
[1:32:25] spoken through
[1:32:28] Isaiah there were still other prophets
[1:32:31] there was still more word to
[1:32:34] come and that's what God was waiting for
[1:32:37] he he was waiting for the for the end of
[1:32:40] the Old Testament prophets to speak the
[1:32:42] last one to speak and then there could
[1:32:45] come a
[1:32:46] manifestation you you can again just
[1:32:49] just um simply you can you can think
[1:32:52] about this when God God said let there
[1:32:54] be light he didn't say let there be
[1:33:00] light the word had to be finished he
[1:33:03] said let there be light
[1:33:07] not now the word had to be finished let
[1:33:10] there be light and once the word was
[1:33:14] finished then come a manifestation you
[1:33:17] can think about it in the context again
[1:33:19] of R uh Genesis 1 where God said let
[1:33:22] every seed bring forth after through its
[1:33:24] own kind nothing happened when he said
[1:33:26] let that let
[1:33:28] every because not all the word was
[1:33:31] spoken
[1:33:32] yet the the the the the word had to be
[1:33:36] spoken concerning that day and when the
[1:33:39] word was spoken concerning that day then
[1:33:43] there could come a manifestation of what
[1:33:46] was spoken you so so God wasn't
[1:33:48] complacent and said let every let every
[1:33:52] um let every seed bring and then say you
[1:33:55] know I'll just leave it up to them
[1:33:57] they'll figure the rest
[1:33:59] out no it it was up to God to bring the
[1:34:02] word it was up to God to bring all the
[1:34:05] word not just words but all the word all
[1:34:09] the word had to be spoken the the
[1:34:11] mystery of God had to be finished before
[1:34:14] there could come a manifestation it had
[1:34:16] to be spoken then there could come a
[1:34:19] manifestation amen so we're looking at
[1:34:22] this thought in the in the context of
[1:34:25] our our Jes our Jesus our lord our groom
[1:34:28] the original Masterpiece that all the
[1:34:30] word had to be spoken before he could
[1:34:33] become flesh it it wasn't just for the
[1:34:37] sake of it it wasn't just um him having
[1:34:39] a good idea no there was a purpose there
[1:34:42] was a purpose all right so it it was the
[1:34:47] word of the
[1:34:50] prophets
[1:34:51] that became manif EST on
[1:34:57] Earth it's a good time to take me
[1:35:17] jacket I have this effect on microphones
[1:35:29] can you hear me BR
[1:35:31] yep thank you
[1:35:34] bro so praise the Lord
[1:35:38] amen so the there cannot be a
[1:35:41] manifestation without the word being
[1:35:43] spoken okay
[1:35:47] um so that is why John was able
[1:35:51] to um reveal feel the
[1:35:56] Masterpiece was because the word had
[1:35:58] been
[1:35:59] spoken and now the word that had been
[1:36:02] spoken was being revealed yes
[1:36:07] amen I think it's a beautiful thing a
[1:36:09] beautiful thought that you know God God
[1:36:13] does his work but then he wants to show
[1:36:15] his his
[1:36:18] bride he speaks the word the word is
[1:36:21] creative it comes into
[1:36:24] manifestation and now he says now what
[1:36:26] I'm going to do is I'm going to reveal
[1:36:29] what I've made to my
[1:36:32] wife I get a it it just it just Thrills
[1:36:35] my my heart to to to just understand
[1:36:38] that the the mind of God and sometimes
[1:36:40] we put God way up and out of out of our
[1:36:43] reach and but he he operates in such a
[1:36:46] way that we can relate to him and I just
[1:36:50] love it so much because the whole the
[1:36:52] whole purpose of the Lord revealing the
[1:36:55] Lamb of God through John was to reveal
[1:36:59] what he'd done yes
[1:37:02] am because literally if we can say it in
[1:37:06] this context God had said let there
[1:37:10] be he was the word a lamb was the word
[1:37:15] and now God revealed through John to
[1:37:19] those that had had eyes to see
[1:37:23] his
[1:37:25] workmanship and he says I'm I'm here
[1:37:29] this is this is the manifestation of the
[1:37:32] word the word is God right this is this
[1:37:35] is my workmanship this is what I've done
[1:37:39] and I want to I want to show it to
[1:37:41] you wow God God wants you to see his
[1:37:47] Masterpiece amen John John John pulled
[1:37:51] the the the the cover off the the
[1:37:53] Masterpiece you know if you build
[1:37:56] something can you cover it over with a
[1:37:58] with a sheet or something maybe it's a
[1:37:59] plaque or there's an unveiling which
[1:38:02] means if there's an unveiling at some
[1:38:04] time the Masterpiece is actually there
[1:38:07] but it's veiled it's veiled so God God
[1:38:11] waited till the Masterpiece was complete
[1:38:14] and when the Masterpiece is complete
[1:38:16] then there's going to be an unveiling so
[1:38:19] so what what God did through John was to
[1:38:22] reveal the master the piece amen Reve oh
[1:38:26] my praise God am me it's it's it's a
[1:38:29] beautiful thing it's a it's a wonderful
[1:38:32] thing it's a personal thing it's a it's
[1:38:35] it's an intimate thing that God's God's
[1:38:38] desires for you as his bride are are
[1:38:42] intimate all
[1:38:46] right so we the word was
[1:38:49] spoken once the word was spoken it came
[1:38:52] into manifest
[1:38:54] ation once that which was now manifested
[1:38:59] was manifested was now
[1:39:03] revealed it was spoken created
[1:39:08] revealed spoken created
[1:39:12] revealed spoken it C the spoken word be
[1:39:16] come into
[1:39:18] manifestation and then the the at at the
[1:39:21] manifestation it was originally failed
[1:39:24] that's right all right it when it went
[1:39:27] from word to
[1:39:29] manifestation people could see it but
[1:39:31] they didn't know what it was so there
[1:39:33] was a veil over it there was a veil over
[1:39:36] Jesus there was a the Masterpiece was
[1:39:39] veiled all right so it went from word to
[1:39:43] manifestation the manifestation was
[1:39:45] veiled but then there came a time
[1:39:48] through a through through a forerunner
[1:39:51] that that that God was going to
[1:39:53] introduce the people to the
[1:39:55] manifestation by lifting the veil but
[1:39:59] the the the Masterpiece was there the
[1:40:01] unveiling didn't make the Masterpiece
[1:40:04] the Masterpiece the Masterpiece was
[1:40:06] always a masterpiece but now the
[1:40:08] Masterpiece was being
[1:40:10] revealed amen hallelujah amen all God's
[1:40:14] works are
[1:40:16] Masterpiece amen amen praise God praise
[1:40:21] the Lord amen
[1:40:27] amen you know the Lord operates in a
[1:40:30] little different way to
[1:40:33] us in that he knows how to achieve what
[1:40:36] he desires to achieve you know God
[1:40:40] doesn't operate like some mad sinist in
[1:40:42] a in a science lab and mixing this with
[1:40:45] that and hoping he gets the results that
[1:40:47] he he desires he knows what he means he
[1:40:52] knows what he wants
[1:40:54] God speaks his word and what he speaks
[1:40:57] manifests it doesn't matter what you
[1:41:00] think of
[1:41:02] it God's word is perfect and what is
[1:41:07] manifested by his word is
[1:41:10] perfect it doesn't matter what you
[1:41:13] think if God says it's a
[1:41:17] masterpiece that's what it is he he he's
[1:41:20] he's not deterred he's not discouraged
[1:41:25] by people saying well I don't see it as
[1:41:27] you see
[1:41:30] it it doesn't bother him it doesn't
[1:41:34] worry
[1:41:36] him God is always on time and God is
[1:41:40] always in order all right so Jesus stood
[1:41:44] on Earth not just as the Old Testament
[1:41:47] word but also as the New Testament word
[1:41:51] he's he did not stand as the word in
[1:41:56] part as Moses
[1:41:58] stood but he stood as the fullness of
[1:42:02] the
[1:42:03] word he stood as the fullness of the
[1:42:07] godhead
[1:42:10] bodily meaning that he was both Old
[1:42:13] Testament and New Testament yes
[1:42:16] true because if he was if he was only
[1:42:20] the Old Testament then he wasn't the
[1:42:22] fullness of the godhead bodily that's
[1:42:24] right but he was both the Old Testament
[1:42:27] and the New Testament he he was the
[1:42:30] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[1:42:34] that actually becomes a revelation to
[1:42:36] you
[1:42:38] now God can God is still revealing that
[1:42:41] Masterpiece yes because Jesus rose in
[1:42:45] the in the strength of where he come
[1:42:47] from and where he was going
[1:42:51] to we'll get to that in a little bit
[1:42:54] later but the New Testament had not been
[1:42:57] spoken
[1:43:06] yet
[1:43:10] when you
[1:43:14] looked on Jesus this is what you
[1:43:19] saw he was the fullness
[1:43:23] of the godhead
[1:43:24] bodily he was the Old
[1:43:27] Testament and he was the New
[1:43:31] Testament he came in the volume of the
[1:43:34] book we could
[1:43:37] say he came as the
[1:43:40] new and the
[1:43:43] old but what in fact you were
[1:43:47] seeing was this portion yes
[1:43:53] because he was the
[1:43:56] manifestation of the word of the Old
[1:44:00] Testament
[1:44:03] prophets he was the old and the
[1:44:06] new but what you were seeing was the
[1:44:10] manifestation of the Old Testament but
[1:44:13] he was both the Old and the new
[1:44:18] amen the same as when God created Adam
[1:44:23] yeah that's right there was a part of
[1:44:25] Adam that was in Adam that you didn't
[1:44:27] know was in
[1:44:29] Adam right there was a part of Adam Adam
[1:44:33] was a masterpiece but there was a
[1:44:35] masterpiece within the Masterpiece but
[1:44:38] but you couldn't see that hidden part of
[1:44:40] the Masterpiece the only bit that was
[1:44:43] manifested was the the adom the male
[1:44:46] part we could say of the
[1:44:50] Masterpiece so there was a hidden part
[1:44:53] heart of Adam that you couldn't see now
[1:44:56] when Jesus stood on Earth he stood on
[1:44:58] Earth as this but what you couldn't see
[1:45:00] was this this is the New Testament this
[1:45:02] is the Old Testament but it was there
[1:45:04] all along amen it was there you just
[1:45:07] didn't know it was there because only
[1:45:10] the word that was spoken could come into
[1:45:13] manifestation is that right so it's only
[1:45:16] the word that was spoken that was in
[1:45:18] manifestation but there was another
[1:45:20] portion of him that was hidden that was
[1:45:22] there it was there on along and that's
[1:45:24] why when when when God spoke about Adam
[1:45:28] he spoke about Adam as
[1:45:30] them he was speaking to
[1:45:34] one physically we we could say but there
[1:45:38] was two and God knew who he speaking to
[1:45:42] and God knew when he was speaking about
[1:45:45] Adam he was speaking to more than just
[1:45:47] the Old Testament but he was also
[1:45:49] speaking to a New Testament part of him
[1:45:52] he was also speaking to a female part of
[1:45:55] him that was locked up inside of him
[1:45:58] that's amen hallelujah amen but I'm
[1:46:01] making the point here that the only
[1:46:04] thing that was in manifestation at that
[1:46:06] time was Adam the only thing that was in
[1:46:09] manifestation in John 13 was the male
[1:46:12] the groom the Masterpiece
[1:46:16] groom amen hallelujah so so God knows
[1:46:23] what he has manifested God knows what he
[1:46:27] had created when God created Adam he
[1:46:29] knew what he had created he
[1:46:32] testified of the mystery
[1:46:36] Portion by his
[1:46:39] word I don't know what the Angels
[1:46:42] thought when God said
[1:46:46] them created he them in the
[1:46:50] Angels how many do you see
[1:46:56] I know God's God and we just have to
[1:46:58] trust him on this
[1:47:02] one but when he said them there was two
[1:47:06] but there was one but there was two but
[1:47:09] you but the Angels could only see
[1:47:12] one right and when Jesus was on Earth he
[1:47:16] he was the Lamb of God who taketh away
[1:47:19] the sin of the world but when when God
[1:47:21] looked down upon him he wasn't seeing
[1:47:23] one he was seeing
[1:47:27] two amen
[1:47:29] amen so there was a male part and there
[1:47:32] was a there was a female part amen she
[1:47:36] she was
[1:47:38] there but you couldn't see
[1:47:43] her he was the fullness of the
[1:47:47] word right Jesus Christ was the fullness
[1:47:51] of the godhead bottle
[1:47:53] he wasn't the godhead bodily like Adam
[1:47:56] was sorry like Moses
[1:47:59] was because Moses was a portion of the
[1:48:03] male that's right but now when Jesus
[1:48:06] when the fullness of the word when the
[1:48:08] word became flesh and dwelt amongst us
[1:48:11] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:48:13] bodily meaning that he was more than
[1:48:16] what Moses
[1:48:18] was not just because Jeremiah hadn't
[1:48:21] spoken yet
[1:48:23] but because there was a female form
[1:48:26] there was a female part of our Lord
[1:48:29] Jesus Christ the in him that wasn't in
[1:48:33] Moses that's
[1:48:35] right because he was the not he was not
[1:48:39] the word in portion but our Lord was the
[1:48:43] word in fullness all right he was the
[1:48:47] Old
[1:48:48] Testament and he was the New Testament
[1:48:53] okay so we understand that the
[1:48:56] Bible the
[1:48:59] Bible is the complete
[1:49:03] revelation of Jesus
[1:49:07] Christ is that right the
[1:49:11] Bible the Bible not the Old
[1:49:16] Testament the Bible yes old and
[1:49:21] new you can't it's all we need is the
[1:49:23] New Testament no no you don't the Bible
[1:49:28] the Bible consists of Old Testament and
[1:49:31] New Testament is the complete revelation
[1:49:34] of Jesus Christ which means that there
[1:49:37] is a
[1:49:39] portion
[1:49:41] of Jesus Christ that was not
[1:49:45] revealed 200,000 year ago amen the same
[1:49:49] as when the word that God spoke about
[1:49:54] Adam let us make man in the in our own
[1:49:56] image the see the word had to be
[1:49:59] spoken and then the word became
[1:50:03] flesh but there was a there was a
[1:50:06] portion of Adam that wasn't
[1:50:11] revealed and there's a portion of this
[1:50:14] book that's right 2,000 years ago that
[1:50:18] wasn't revealed all right but now that
[1:50:22] portion is being
[1:50:26] revealed he was the manifestation of the
[1:50:29] spoken word of the Old Testament
[1:50:31] prophets
[1:50:34] plus I'll see if I can go
[1:50:38] back he was all the all the prophets
[1:50:42] made in one
[1:50:44] plus yes right plus even
[1:50:49] that so he was more than that there was
[1:50:53] a there was a part of him that was
[1:50:55] hidden there was a part of him that was
[1:50:57] not
[1:51:00] spoken there was a portion of him that
[1:51:03] wasn't spoken
[1:51:06] yet but it was
[1:51:09] there there was a portion of Adam that
[1:51:12] wasn't spoken
[1:51:14] yet but it was there it was there all
[1:51:18] along amen so he wasn't just the Old
[1:51:21] Testament he was both the Old and the
[1:51:24] New
[1:51:26] Testament so as that man Jesus stood
[1:51:31] upon the Earth there was a part of him
[1:51:35] that no one knew nothing
[1:51:39] about no man no woman no Beast No
[1:51:46] Angel only God knew that there was
[1:51:50] coming a new testament
[1:51:57] no one but God knew that there was a she
[1:52:01] in
[1:52:03] him no one knew that there was coming a
[1:52:07] new testament
[1:52:09] bride no one knew that there was a
[1:52:12] masterpiece in the masterpiece
[1:52:22] listen to this Luke likewise
[1:52:26] also the C the cup
[1:52:29] after the cup after supper saying this
[1:52:33] cup is the New
[1:52:36] Testament in my
[1:52:40] blood now think about these two words
[1:52:43] New
[1:52:45] Testament had they been spoken by men
[1:52:49] before had these two words ever been re
[1:52:53] received into people's uh hearing
[1:52:59] before so the groom was testifying of
[1:53:02] the New
[1:53:04] Testament the groom was testifying that
[1:53:07] there was coming a new testament amen
[1:53:11] this is the New Testament where in my
[1:53:14] blood it's a part of
[1:53:17] me the prophet of God extensively tells
[1:53:20] us that the the blood is
[1:53:23] life is that right so so what's going to
[1:53:27] come forth is a is another portion of
[1:53:29] the original
[1:53:31] life this is the cup this is the cup in
[1:53:34] the New Testament which New Testament in
[1:53:38] my blood and Peter must have thought
[1:53:39] then you
[1:53:42] what I don't understand what you mean
[1:53:45] Lord but Peter what Peter didn't realize
[1:53:47] is he was a part of the Lord was
[1:53:50] actually testifying who Peter was but
[1:53:53] Peter couldn't connect it true all the
[1:53:56] apostles except
[1:54:00] Judas cuz he wasn't a part of the New
[1:54:04] Testament he wasn't a part of the
[1:54:06] Masterpiece all right so the the Lord
[1:54:10] here the the groom is testifying that
[1:54:12] there is another part of
[1:54:14] me that's going to come
[1:54:17] forth there's another part of me that's
[1:54:20] going to come forth but the only way
[1:54:23] that this part is going to come forth is
[1:54:26] if I take my position according to the
[1:54:29] will of
[1:54:30] God you you you I hope those that were
[1:54:33] there this yesterday are joining these
[1:54:35] things together all right because Christ
[1:54:38] is our
[1:54:39] pattern if you want to know how to be a
[1:54:41] husband if you want to know how to be
[1:54:43] how to be a a a father Christ is your
[1:54:48] example if he took his position she's
[1:54:51] going to find hers
[1:54:52] that's right is that right it doesn't
[1:54:55] mean she's going to slot in her into her
[1:54:57] position there's going to be trials and
[1:54:59] struggles that she's going to go through
[1:55:01] but as long as he's in her position he's
[1:55:04] in his position she's going to find hers
[1:55:08] so there was a part of there was the the
[1:55:10] part of uh the groom that was not seen
[1:55:15] was relying upon him taking his
[1:55:18] position and if he took his position
[1:55:21] it's going to allow her to take her
[1:55:24] position
[1:55:28] true the rising of the Sun the pro of
[1:55:30] God says but remember he went there with
[1:55:33] you in him that's
[1:55:37] right right see God had never separated
[1:55:42] the bride from the groom
[1:55:44] yet you see so when God looked down upon
[1:55:47] Jesus Christ he saw more than a groom
[1:55:52] he saw a
[1:55:53] bride but no one else could see it but
[1:55:57] the groom was testifying of it because
[1:55:59] he knew who he was he knew who he was he
[1:56:02] knew what position he had to take he
[1:56:04] knew his purpose on Earth and and so he
[1:56:07] was testifying of who was in him but no
[1:56:10] one else could see who was in
[1:56:14] him but when God looked down upon Jesus
[1:56:17] he saw both male and female he saw both
[1:56:21] bride and groom
[1:56:23] my
[1:56:25] goodness so when we look back you see
[1:56:28] where let let the mind that was in
[1:56:30] Christ be in you let take on God's mind
[1:56:33] when we look back 2,000 years ago what
[1:56:35] do we
[1:56:39] see we just don't see a man on a
[1:56:42] cross that's we just don't see a man
[1:56:45] taking the
[1:56:47] lashings we see what God saw by divine
[1:56:51] revelation amen and we say I was in
[1:56:54] him I was in him was he when when he
[1:56:57] took the lashings I was in him when he
[1:57:00] took the markings how by divine
[1:57:07] revelation so when God looked down upon
[1:57:09] the body of Christ he saw both male and
[1:57:12] female it was all redeemed in that one
[1:57:17] body see they are one
[1:57:23] same same
[1:57:25] word the same word spoke of the groom
[1:57:28] speaks of the
[1:57:33] Bride look notice this but God
[1:57:37] foresaw the bride in the groom the
[1:57:41] prophet is bringing your attention to
[1:57:43] something look notice
[1:57:45] this he's he's he's saying something
[1:57:48] he's catching your attention he's
[1:57:50] wanting you to pay attention because
[1:57:52] it's going to help you it's going to
[1:57:55] help you to understand where you come
[1:57:58] from Jesus rose in the strength that he
[1:58:02] came from God and he was going back to
[1:58:04] God Amen am mean what does God want you
[1:58:07] to rise in what does your groom want you
[1:58:10] to rise in in your own strength in the
[1:58:12] strength of the church or the strength
[1:58:15] of the revelation of where you come
[1:58:20] from amen I came from him and I'm going
[1:58:23] back to him amen that's the truth glory
[1:58:27] to God amen
[1:58:32] amen so God spoke to his Masterpiece at
[1:58:36] Calvary and from that
[1:58:41] Masterpiece came forth a new
[1:58:47] testament from the Masterpiece came
[1:58:50] forth the New
[1:58:57] Testament God was now beginning to build
[1:59:01] another Masterpiece
[1:59:05] yes in type if you look at
[1:59:09] Adam the male Masterpiece was
[1:59:14] first that's
[1:59:16] right because the woman was made for man
[1:59:20] not manade for the woman
[1:59:23] Paul testifies of the
[1:59:26] order of God am that the woman was made
[1:59:31] for the man and we found out why
[1:59:34] yesterday the woman was made for the man
[1:59:38] not the man made for the woman showing
[1:59:41] us that the man the male the groom comes
[1:59:45] first and the Bride Comes
[1:59:48] second in your your Bible test defies of
[1:59:52] the order of
[1:59:54] God the groom comes
[1:59:58] first the female the Bride Comes
[2:00:02] second the Old Testament comes first the
[2:00:07] New Testament comes next all right all
[2:00:12] are part of the same
[2:00:14] word the the the Old Testament is the
[2:00:17] word of God the New Testament is the
[2:00:20] word of God is that right it's all the
[2:00:23] same word the same word that speaks of
[2:00:26] the groom speaks of the Bride same word
[2:00:29] same material there's no difference
[2:00:31] between the old and the New Testament
[2:00:33] it's it's God the word is God God is his
[2:00:37] word so it's all the word of God it's
[2:00:40] all God so both male and female are
[2:00:46] God
[2:00:48] amen amen absolutely 100% that's right
[2:00:52] nothing else the same word the spoke of
[2:00:55] the groom speaks of the Bride same
[2:00:59] word now like we said yesterday that
[2:01:02] doesn't mean we don't need the
[2:01:06] groom is that right that doesn't mean we
[2:01:08] don't need the groom because what's the
[2:01:10] difference between the bride and the
[2:01:12] groom position same word the same word
[2:01:17] that speaks of the groom speaks of the
[2:01:19] Bride the difference is position
[2:01:22] because God wants to be expressed both
[2:01:26] through the woman and through the male
[2:01:29] God wants to be expressed through the
[2:01:32] woman as a
[2:01:34] woman God doesn't want to be expressed
[2:01:36] through the woman as a man no God wants
[2:01:40] to be expressed through the woman as a
[2:01:42] woman God wants to be expressed through
[2:01:44] the man as a
[2:01:46] man that's why you and your wife husband
[2:01:49] and wife you are one you are equal but
[2:01:53] there's a difference in
[2:01:56] position amen your pastor and you are
[2:02:00] one same word this the same thing your
[2:02:03] pastor is you are but there's a
[2:02:05] difference in position why it it's it's
[2:02:08] not a domineering
[2:02:10] thing the the pastor doesn't get up here
[2:02:12] and say now listen here you know who I
[2:02:14] am and you better submit to unto me
[2:02:17] because through the revelation of who I
[2:02:19] am that's it's not that it's a it's an
[2:02:22] God wants to be expressed through his
[2:02:24] Masterpiece
[2:02:27] family God just doesn't want to be
[2:02:29] expressed in an office that's right he
[2:02:33] wants to be expressed in all
[2:02:38] offices amen it doesn't matter whether
[2:02:41] you're a a a a father a mother a a a
[2:02:45] husband a wife a child it's it's God's
[2:02:49] desire to be expressed through you
[2:02:52] in the office that you
[2:02:54] hold outside of that it's a perversion
[2:02:58] that's
[2:02:59] right this is why the deception of the
[2:03:02] of Satan in the garden was so
[2:03:06] dramatic because Satan knew where to go
[2:03:10] yes Satan knew if he could get to the
[2:03:14] woman he knew that he couldn't influence
[2:03:16] Adam so he went to the woman right
[2:03:20] because he knew he could influence
[2:03:22] the
[2:03:24] woman but what the woman should have
[2:03:26] done is gone to the to a
[2:03:29] head she should have gone back to Adam
[2:03:33] and said listen I've heard someone said
[2:03:36] this this and this today what do you
[2:03:38] think about it Adam would have squashed
[2:03:42] it right and this is why we in in this
[2:03:46] day where he failed this bride won't
[2:03:50] that's right all right cuz she knows
[2:03:52] where to go she's got a revelation of
[2:03:56] her position Hallelujah all right she
[2:03:59] knows that she's the weaker
[2:04:02] vessel and she's not too proud to admit
[2:04:09] it
[2:04:18] Hallelujah so when God put Adam to sleep
[2:04:23] what he was doing was creating another
[2:04:26] Masterpiece he was taking the hidden
[2:04:29] portion of
[2:04:31] Adam and creating another
[2:04:39] Adam you
[2:04:45] know we can't
[2:04:48] become better husbands
[2:04:53] by our own
[2:05:01] thinking in
[2:05:06] cultures the
[2:05:09] woman is something different to the man
[2:05:13] let me put it that way nice and
[2:05:17] easy but God's word takes care of
[2:05:20] culture
[2:05:23] hallu now I'm not talking about from
[2:05:26] here to another country you can have
[2:05:27] family
[2:05:31] culture when God opens his
[2:05:36] word if you're wrong admit
[2:05:42] it because your
[2:05:45] wife is an expression of
[2:05:48] you she is another part of you this why
[2:05:52] a man who abuses his wife lacks
[2:05:56] Revelation that's that's all it is okay
[2:05:59] he lacks Revelation a man that demeans
[2:06:02] his wife a man that runs his wife down a
[2:06:05] man's that a man that won't allow his
[2:06:08] wife to become intimate with him is
[2:06:10] someone who lacks
[2:06:13] Revelation and this is why like I said
[2:06:16] yesterday we we we are seeing an we are
[2:06:20] seeing a rising in the quality of our
[2:06:25] marriages because the word is
[2:06:28] opening amen the word is revealing that
[2:06:32] my wife is actually actually an
[2:06:35] extension of me yes what I what she what
[2:06:38] I am she
[2:06:40] is what she is I
[2:06:42] am so if I mistreat her are mistreating
[2:06:47] me
[2:06:56] so what God was
[2:06:58] doing
[2:07:00] by laying Adam to
[2:07:02] sleep he was creating a
[2:07:05] masterpiece for a
[2:07:09] masterpiece because if the original was
[2:07:12] a masterpiece then the one that comes
[2:07:13] out of him has to be a masterpiece it
[2:07:15] can't be anything
[2:07:18] different it doesn't matter what you
[2:07:20] think of it
[2:07:22] yes if God says the original is a
[2:07:25] masterpiece then what comes out of it is
[2:07:27] a masterpiece it doesn't matter what you
[2:07:30] think God is not even interested in what
[2:07:32] you
[2:07:35] think God doesn't unveil his Masterpiece
[2:07:38] and then he says so what do you
[2:07:39] think like he's looking for approval of
[2:07:42] what he's done no he's not unveiling his
[2:07:45] Masterpiece so you can give your
[2:07:49] opinion all his work works are perfect
[2:07:53] Hallelujah Glory he's not interested in
[2:07:56] your opinion he doesn't need your
[2:08:00] opinion but we're
[2:08:05] opinionated even when someone doesn't
[2:08:07] want our opinion sometimes we give
[2:08:15] it in the Masterpiece we just go through
[2:08:18] a few of these I think he says now for
[2:08:21] nearly 2,000 years God had been again
[2:08:24] making him a masterpiece because he
[2:08:26] struck Adam to get a masterpiece a piece
[2:08:29] off of him part of him a rib to make a
[2:08:33] wife for him and now that perfect
[2:08:36] Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he
[2:08:39] got a piece off of him it's just the New
[2:08:45] Testament that's all fulfilled he
[2:08:49] fulfilled the Old Testament
[2:08:52] yes I like the way the prophet says it
[2:08:55] you it's just the New Testament that's
[2:08:57] all like it's no big deal it's just the
[2:09:00] New Testament that's all wow so the
[2:09:04] peace that God struck off the original
[2:09:09] Masterpiece there was a piece that he
[2:09:11] struck
[2:09:13] off right it was the hidden
[2:09:16] peace it was a peace that was there all
[2:09:19] the
[2:09:20] time right he didn't add a peace he
[2:09:23] struck off a peace which means the peace
[2:09:27] was always there the New Testament was
[2:09:30] always there he was the fullness of the
[2:09:33] godhead bodily the New Testament was
[2:09:36] there but he struck that new testament
[2:09:38] off him glory
[2:09:41] glory it's just the New Testament that's
[2:09:45] all he got a piece of him just the New
[2:09:49] Testament it's just the New Testament
[2:09:51] that's Soul he
[2:09:53] fulfilled the Old
[2:09:58] Testament he fulfilled the Old
[2:10:01] Testament
[2:10:03] now I wonder who's going to fulfill the
[2:10:08] second or the
[2:10:13] new I think it'll be him
[2:10:18] again yeah I think I think it'll be him
[2:10:22] again I don't think it'll be anything
[2:10:25] different I think the
[2:10:28] peace that he struck off will fulfill
[2:10:32] the New Testament
[2:10:36] yeah because he
[2:10:38] was the old and the new but he fulfilled
[2:10:43] the Old
[2:10:44] Testament and the peace that he struck
[2:10:47] off is going to fulfill the New
[2:10:49] Testament okay brother then well don't
[2:10:52] you mean then she will fulfill the new
[2:10:54] test yeah that's what I
[2:10:56] said Glory that's what I
[2:10:59] said because she is
[2:11:04] him so he was the fulfiller of the Old
[2:11:08] Testament but really he is the fulfiller
[2:11:11] of the Bible amen it's not you
[2:11:15] fulfilling his will yeah it's him
[2:11:17] fulfilling his own will amen Glory

[2:16:46] yes it was there he just had to chip
[2:16:49] away the bits of it that weren't a part
[2:16:51] of the original Vision so the
[2:16:52] Masterpiece is
[2:16:54] hereen we're not waiting for the
[2:16:57] Masterpiece the Masterpiece is here but
[2:16:59] God is stripping away from me a parts of
[2:17:03] the Masterpiece that and a part of his

[2:17:08] ideas my god of what it means to be a
[2:17:11] father yes God is stripping away my
[2:17:14] ideas of what it means to be a husband

[2:17:19] behalf of my wife her ideas on what it
[2:17:22] means to be a wife God is stripping away
[2:17:24] her ideas on what she thinks it means to
[2:17:27] be a mother God is stripping away why he
[2:17:31] because he's bringing us to a point
[2:17:33] where we will be the very manifestation
[2:17:36] of the word
[2:17:38] hallelujah not the word end thank you
[2:17:41] Jesus but the word Hallelujah Jesus was
[2:17:45] the word amen and this masterpiece is
[2:17:48] going to be the word she is the word yes
[2:17:51] amen she will be the manifestation of
[2:17:53] the New Testament
[2:17:56] word by his
[2:17:58] grace how's he doing it by making this a
[2:18:02] reality Jesus amen by making this
[2:18:05] personal we've talked about it we've
[2:18:08] preached about it but now it's becoming
[2:18:10] a reality the book is becoming a reality
[2:18:14] the lamb is becoming reality the seals
[2:18:16] are becoming a reality the contents are
[2:18:19] becoming a reality
[2:18:24] to where
[2:18:26] God will be my wife's
[2:18:36] husband as this
[2:18:40] body surrenders to
[2:18:43] him it's not
[2:18:46] me being a husband to my
[2:18:49] wife it's him
[2:18:51] yes being a husband to my wife through
[2:18:56] this body Hallelujah beautiful you are
[2:18:59] not seeing the further development of
[2:19:02] this
[2:19:03] body no sir you are seeing the further
[2:19:06] development of this word in me amen you
[2:19:12] are seeing God In Action my wife is
[2:19:16] Experiencing God In Action we're back in
[2:19:18] the Garden of Eden where my wife is
[2:19:21] Experiencing God in
[2:19:23] action and it's the same the other way
[2:19:31] yes it's not my wife loving
[2:19:34] me but it's God in
[2:19:37] her loving me through
[2:19:41] her you see what you see where where
[2:19:45] where Parenthood is coming
[2:19:48] to you you see how God takes care of
[2:19:55] cultures there's no point preaching at a
[2:19:58] culture open the
[2:20:01] word God needs to come into th into
[2:20:03] those cultures that have their own ideas
[2:20:05] and open the word and when the word
[2:20:07] opens it takes care of the
[2:20:11] culture there's no point coming to me
[2:20:13] and preaching to me about my family
[2:20:16] culture there's no point coming to me
[2:20:18] and preaching to me about how my dad did
[2:20:20] things
[2:20:23] amen that's not going to solve the
[2:20:27] problem that's what surprised you
[2:20:32] yesterday because it's the opening of
[2:20:34] the word that fixes the
[2:20:37] problem when you see your place when the
[2:20:41] word opens you become the
[2:20:43] word when the book becomes a reality you
[2:20:46] become the book
[2:20:52] Hallelujah I thank God for his
[2:20:56] presence I thank God that there is a man
[2:21:00] who can turn on the light yes amen I
[2:21:03] thank God that he is the one who is
[2:21:06] turning on the light what what does that
[2:21:09] mean it means the word becomes a reality
[2:21:11] you can quote it you can you can
[2:21:13] memorize it you can do whatever you want
[2:21:15] but that doesn't mean the light's turned
[2:21:17] on the evidence that the light is turned
[2:21:19] on is when when the word becomes
[2:21:21] manifested the prophet of God said that
[2:21:23] is the light that is the word when the
[2:21:26] word becomes
[2:21:28] manifested and that's what we're
[2:21:31] seeing we're seeing God as a
[2:21:36] husband we're seeing God as husbands
[2:21:39] we're seeing God as
[2:21:41] wives even pastoring has
[2:21:45] changed because we had traditional
[2:21:48] methods of pastoring
[2:21:50] absolutely we did we we had traditional
[2:21:53] methods of pastoring but by the opening
[2:21:56] of the word God is stripping away
[2:21:57] tradition yes God is stripping away
[2:22:01] Church ideas Church
[2:22:03] culture isn't that what he said he's
[2:22:05] doing
[2:22:08] here all he has all all has to be cut
[2:22:12] away from the
[2:22:15] church both in this form and this form
[2:22:20] yes that's
[2:22:26] right praise
[2:22:28] God God's
[2:22:30] good
[2:22:32] amen God is
[2:22:34] present
[2:22:39] amen how the Masterpiece is
[2:22:43] present the New Testament Masterpiece is
[2:22:47] present he's just taking it it's like if
[2:22:49] you would have walk through a padic that
[2:22:51] has
[2:22:52] burs and then you're picking off you get
[2:22:56] to the end of your walk and then you
[2:22:57] begin to pick off things that weren't
[2:23:00] there when you
[2:23:02] began so you just but you're there
[2:23:05] you're just removing parts
[2:23:08] of parts that are stuck to you that are
[2:23:11] not
[2:23:14] you so in in our in our in through our
[2:23:17] new birth through our through our
[2:23:19] original birth our through the the
[2:23:21] through our sex birth we picked up
[2:23:25] things we picked up things through our
[2:23:27] through our sex birth and then even
[2:23:30] through through after our new birth
[2:23:33] there were still things hanging on to us
[2:23:36] we we we pick we go to one church and we
[2:23:38] pick up their
[2:23:39] culture it's true you if if if New
[2:23:43] Zealand that goes to Australia every
[2:23:45] country had its Spirit every country has
[2:23:46] its culture if you're in Australia for
[2:23:49] long enough you will pick up the a
[2:23:50] Australian
[2:23:51] culture when when one Church comes from
[2:23:54] to when one person goes from one Church
[2:23:56] to another church if you're in that
[2:23:58] church long enough you'll pick up the
[2:23:59] culture of that church so we we are not
[2:24:02] exempt for picking up things when I
[2:24:05] become a dad i d i i was a father as my
[2:24:08] father was a father when I become a
[2:24:10] pastor I fathered as my father
[2:24:13] pastored do you know why God doesn't
[2:24:15] call the
[2:24:18] qualified he qualif if is the called
[2:24:23] am so when we when we first become a
[2:24:26] masterpiece when we first you was always
[2:24:28] a
[2:24:29] masterpiece you didn't even become a
[2:24:32] masterpiece you was always a masterpiece
[2:24:35] because you are in him then but in your
[2:24:37] time from there to now you've picked up
[2:24:39] things that God is stripping away glory
[2:24:42] and you will be in this
[2:24:44] life what you were in him yes Jesus
[2:24:49] hallu oh walking Oracle of God the word
[2:24:53] made
[2:24:54] flesh and dwell among
[2:24:57] us this is why we're seeing a an
[2:25:01] elevation in the quality of
[2:25:04] marriages H nothing to do with me
[2:25:07] nothing to do with you it's God this is
[2:25:10] why we're seeing an elevation in the
[2:25:12] quality of fatherhood we're seeing an
[2:25:15] elevation in the quality of motherhood
[2:25:17] nothing to do with you nothing to do
[2:25:19] with me but but it's all to do with God
[2:25:22] it's all to do with him opening his word
[2:25:24] and the opening of the word it causes
[2:25:26] the traditions and dogmas and our own
[2:25:29] denominational ideas to roll
[2:25:32] away nothing to do with me nothing to do
[2:25:35] with you I am his
[2:25:39] workmanship and praise God he
[2:25:42] alone oh there's times when I tried to
[2:25:45] pick up the
[2:25:47] hammer you know he wasn't moving fast
[2:25:49] enough for me you know so I thought I'd
[2:25:50] give him a
[2:25:52] hand well you know what that does huh it
[2:25:55] just delays the works even more because
[2:25:58] then he's got to come back and fix up
[2:26:00] what I tried to fix
[2:26:02] up it's the truth it ain't nothing but
[2:26:05] the
[2:26:07] truth amen
[2:26:10] 187 amen L Lord Make Me mold me make me
[2:26:14] Lord what I should
[2:26:16] be then there'll be a different thing
[2:26:23] so he's he's
[2:26:25] acknowledging the
[2:26:27] Masterpiece creating another Masterpiece
[2:26:30] that I'm not my own Masterpiece but he's
[2:26:32] the one who's making
[2:26:34] me says then if I be lifted up from the
[2:26:37] earth I will draw all men unto me yes
[2:26:39] sir he is cutting you out
[2:26:46] now he is cutting you out now who is the
[2:26:51] you the Masterpiece he is cutting
[2:26:56] you the Masterpiece exists yes Lord
[2:27:00] though God be still working on it the
[2:27:03] Masterpiece has come to a place now
[2:27:06] where it can testify for
[2:27:09] itself that it
[2:27:14] exists Hallelujah he is cutting you out
[2:27:18] now amen cutting you down to his word
[2:27:23] only cutting all the Creeds and dogmas
[2:27:26] and everything away from you trying to
[2:27:28] get you back to a bride for the son
[2:27:31] another Masterpiece part of the word the
[2:27:34] word oh say I I don't have any dogmas I
[2:27:38] don't have any Creeds Yeah well yeah you
[2:27:40] do and you just testify that you did
[2:27:43] because that idea that you just spoke is
[2:27:45] wrong so your own words condemn you yes
[2:27:49] your own words cond vict you yes oh we
[2:27:51] all need cutting down absolutely we all
[2:27:55] need
[2:27:56] trimming I don't care whether we're at
[2:27:58] the place where God's taking a
[2:27:59] sledgehammer and knocking off a big part
[2:28:02] or God is refining he's still removing a
[2:28:05] part of you that's not
[2:28:09] you Hallelujah the word the word the
[2:28:13] word we're coming back to the word we're
[2:28:15] coming back to the word get back to the
[2:28:17] word the prophet would say we're coming
[2:28:19] back to the word
[2:28:20] Hallelujah I am the word but I'm coming
[2:28:22] back to the word only amen it's not
[2:28:25] going to be me a part of me and a part
[2:28:28] of him it's all going to be I'm all him
[2:28:31] amen we're coming back to the word back
[2:28:33] to the word how are we coming back to
[2:28:35] the word because he's removing
[2:28:37] everything from us that is not a part of
[2:28:39] the word thank you Lord glory to God
[2:28:43] we're on the threshing
[2:28:45] floor the threshing floor is when you
[2:28:47] get thrown up in the air and and and
[2:28:50] when there's a breeze the wheat gets
[2:28:52] thrown up in the
[2:28:54] air and as a result of being thrown up
[2:28:56] in the air the the wheat is heavier yes
[2:29:00] than the Shar so the the wheat gets
[2:29:02] thrown up but the breeze that comes
[2:29:05] through blows what is not the wheat
[2:29:08] away amen Ruth met Boaz where on the
[2:29:11] threshing floor Hallelujah I'll meet you
[2:29:14] in
[2:29:18] there h
[2:29:20] hallelujah
[2:29:22] hallelujah so in the in the molding of
[2:29:25] the Masterpiece it means that the how
[2:29:28] can I say this
[2:29:30] the the this the person with the
[2:29:34] vision and the
[2:29:37] Masterpiece have to come
[2:29:43] together it means that in order for the
[2:29:47] bride masterpiece
[2:29:51] to become the word only the only way
[2:29:54] that that can happen is if the groom
[2:29:57] comes to the
[2:30:02] bride because it's him molding
[2:30:05] her it's him revealing
[2:30:09] himself all right so there has to be
[2:30:12] someone
[2:30:14] present for me to be who I am today I'm
[2:30:19] not who I am today who I was yesterday
[2:30:21] or the day before I've felt a change in
[2:30:24] my life in the last two
[2:30:26] weeks right the the the the thing that
[2:30:30] God wants you to understand in that is
[2:30:32] who did
[2:30:34] it because what the PO what what's the
[2:30:37] point of a change if we don't
[2:30:38] acknowledge the one who made the
[2:30:41] change is that right the purpose of the
[2:30:44] change the purpose of God changing me
[2:30:47] yes is for him to testify me I'm here
[2:30:51] because you can't do
[2:30:53] thisall you can't do this there's only
[2:30:57] one there is only one yes who can change
[2:31:03] you that's right I believe that and that
[2:31:05] is him that is my
[2:31:10] groom when when Isaac took Rebecca into
[2:31:14] the tent there was a
[2:31:18] change that's right there there weren't
[2:31:20] men in the
[2:31:23] tent there was one it was Isaac and
[2:31:28] Rebecca Rebecca came out of that tent
[2:31:31] different to how she went
[2:31:35] in the angel of the Lord receives a
[2:31:38] vision of a little
[2:31:41] tent and he saw people going in with
[2:31:45] infirmities do you know who they were
[2:31:48] masterpieces
[2:31:52] yes they were
[2:31:55] masterpieces and by that Union by that
[2:31:58] meaning he said the the the Lord said
[2:32:00] I'll meet you in there I'll meet you not
[2:32:04] you I'll meet you personal I'll meet you
[2:32:08] in
[2:32:10] there they went in with infirmities they
[2:32:14] came out
[2:32:16] whole by that meeting they would
[2:32:21] changed I'm being
[2:32:24] changed yes it's not a oneof
[2:32:29] thing it's a it's a it's a chip after
[2:32:32] chip it's a cutting after a cutting but
[2:32:35] the point is I'm being
[2:32:38] changed I'm
[2:32:40] there he met me in there well had you
[2:32:44] know because I'm
[2:32:46] Different to how I went from the time
[2:32:49] that I went went into the tent I'm
[2:32:59] different part of the word the
[2:33:08] word so God is making a masterpiece
[2:33:15] wife he's got to do it the same way he
[2:33:17] did the first one
[2:33:21] he'll do this he'll he'll make the
[2:33:23] second Masterpiece the same way that he
[2:33:26] made his first
[2:33:28] Masterpiece as it taken him 4,000 years
[2:33:31] to make this masterpiece now he's been
[2:33:33] for nearly 2,000 years making another
[2:33:36] Masterpiece a bride for Christ another
[2:33:39] Masterpiece in doing it he does it by
[2:33:44] his his never changing method the same
[2:33:48] way he made the Masterpiece his word
[2:33:54] that's the way he makes his
[2:33:57] masterpieces beautiful because he can
[2:34:00] only be a perfect
[2:34:03] Masterpiece when it's the
[2:34:05] perfect word amen any dirt trash
[2:34:11] injections it'll break but heavens and
[2:34:14] earth will pass away but that word will
[2:34:18] never break to God Amen so the same way
[2:34:24] that he made the original
[2:34:27] Masterpiece is the same way he's making
[2:34:30] his masterpieces and we know that's the
[2:34:33] many membered body of Christ all right
[2:34:35] he's making his masterpieces he's not
[2:34:38] making it another
[2:34:41] way so if we understand how God made his
[2:34:45] original
[2:34:46] Masterpiece then we're going to get a
[2:34:48] glimpse of how God is going to make his
[2:34:51] second Masterpiece and he made his
[2:34:54] original Masterpiece by the word now
[2:34:57] he's making another Masterpiece he can't
[2:35:00] make it another way he's got to make it
[2:35:02] the same way the original Masterpiece it
[2:35:05] had to be the spoken word that became
[2:35:08] manifested so the word had to be spoken
[2:35:11] first and then the word that was spoken
[2:35:13] become manifest and then the word that
[2:35:15] was manifest become revealed that was
[2:35:17] the original way and now the second
[2:35:19] Masterpiece is going to make the same
[2:35:21] way so the mind of God the word of God
[2:35:24] has to be spoken then the word of God is
[2:35:26] going to become manifested and then the
[2:35:28] manifested word is going to become
[2:35:31] revealed
[2:35:32] wow Mighty God the same
[2:35:39] way see you thought you could get there
[2:35:41] by praying
[2:35:46] harder well there's nothing wrong with
[2:35:48] praying harder but why you just drop the
[2:35:50] idea of that you can get there by your
[2:35:56] prayer Jesus didn't become the
[2:35:58] manifested word because he prayed
[2:36:02] hard the reason he prayed hard is was
[2:36:04] because he was the manifested word see
[2:36:07] the moment that you you think that I'll
[2:36:09] become the word when I do this or after
[2:36:10] I do that or after I overcome this or
[2:36:13] after I overcome that you got the
[2:36:14] picture Twisted you got to turn it to
[2:36:17] the right you got to look at it right
[2:36:18] you got to see it how God sees it and
[2:36:22] when you see it how God sees it when you
[2:36:24] see you how God sees you yes then you'll
[2:36:28] overcome yes you're not an overcomer
[2:36:31] when you
[2:36:32] overcome you're an overcomer therefore
[2:36:34] you can overcome
[2:36:37] amen David wasn't King when he became
[2:36:41] King David was King when God said he was
[2:36:44] King but he was always King in the mind
[2:36:47] of God am amen
[2:36:50] see you didn't become a masterpiece when
[2:36:52] you
[2:36:54] overcome you didn't become Masterpiece
[2:36:56] when you finally overcome that that that
[2:36:59] Spirit of
[2:37:00] lust but that's how the devil wants you
[2:37:03] to think well you know if if you if you
[2:37:06] can just you know what listen listen
[2:37:08] Billy you know once you get past this
[2:37:11] lust thing then you'll be then you'll be
[2:37:14] a
[2:37:16] masterpiece and that's wrong it's AB
[2:37:19] absolutely wrong it's 100% wrong the
[2:37:23] revelation of who you are allows you to
[2:37:26] overcome David went down to the
[2:37:28] battlefield knowing who he
[2:37:31] was amen you're you're you're a
[2:37:34] masterpiece but God is chipping away the
[2:37:37] parts of your thinking that are not his
[2:37:39] thinking and he says you're a
[2:37:41] masterpiece but when you say I'm a
[2:37:43] masterpiece when I he says H I got to
[2:37:46] strip that off you you're a masterpiece
[2:37:49] therefore you will
[2:37:54] overcome see this this is how the devil
[2:37:57] Keeps Us in bondage he does I know all
[2:38:00] right I I know I I I was there he keeps
[2:38:03] us in bondage by by by getting us to
[2:38:07] believe or think like he
[2:38:10] thinks and that's exactly what he did to
[2:38:12] the woman in the Garden of Eden he got
[2:38:14] her to think like he thinks and then it
[2:38:16] become manifested
[2:38:20] but God is chipping
[2:38:22] away those silly
[2:38:27] ideas the word is the
[2:38:31] word
[2:38:33] you
[2:38:35] thinking
[2:38:37] that if you think that this is the word
[2:38:41] when you prove it
[2:38:43] is you're
[2:38:47] wrong because it is
[2:38:50] and God don't care what you think of
[2:38:57] it Jesus was not the word when he rose
[2:39:01] from the
[2:39:04] dead no but they said if thou
[2:39:09] be if thou be come down if thou be save
[2:39:14] thyself that wasn't his
[2:39:17] thinking but he was tempted to think if
[2:39:21] I if I am who God says I am then why am
[2:39:24] I where I
[2:39:27] am the circumstances don't dictate who
[2:39:31] you
[2:39:33] are now you can be def in a defeated
[2:39:36] place that's right yes sir but does that
[2:39:39] mean that you're not a part of the a
[2:39:41] part of the original
[2:39:45] Masterpiece when Eve fell

[2:39:53] Adam

[2:40:24] sermon or gave your first
[2:40:27] special or dedicated your life to God no
[2:40:32] the reason you could dedicate your life
[2:40:34] to God is because you were a
[2:40:37] masterpiece your dedication to him
[2:40:39] doesn't make you
[2:40:41] anything the reason that you can
[2:40:43] dedicate your life to him is because of
[2:40:45] who you

[2:41:22] point you weren't lost but you became
[2:41:25] lost amen but just because you were
[2:41:28] Fallen God didn't say well you know

[2:41:33] you
[2:41:34] fell oh God forbid that's right God knew
[2:41:38] what he was looking at God knew who he
[2:41:41] he was Redeeming the same as Adam knew
[2:41:44] who he was redeeming whether she Adam
[2:41:47] was given the choice to go with her her
[2:41:49] or stay in the
[2:41:52] garden but he had to go yes
[2:41:56] Lord because if he had if he let her go
[2:42:00] he was letting a part of himself
[2:42:03] go so even in in the evees in the
[2:42:08] woman's Fallen condition she was still a

[2:44:49] Ruth met him on the threshing floor he
[2:44:53] spoke he spoke to her that word had
[2:44:57] redeeming
[2:44:59] power she just had to believe what he
[2:45:03] said he redeemed her by his
[2:45:06] word this is why if God didn't speak we
[2:45:10] couldn't be redeemed yes but the first
[2:45:13] the way that he created the first
[2:45:15] Masterpiece is the way he's creating the
[2:45:17] second Masterpiece he is bringing that
[2:45:19] Masterpiece back unto
[2:45:23] himself because that's where she
[2:45:27] started she started in
[2:45:30] him and she's going to end up in
[2:45:33] him Jesus rose from supper what in the
[2:45:37] strength of the revelation of what of
[2:45:44] himself he wasn't relying on Peter
[2:45:47] having the revelation
[2:45:51] he he wasn't relying
[2:45:53] upon the the man who gave Jesus the
[2:45:58] scroll to have the revelation of who he
[2:46:02] was you see you can't rely on
[2:46:05] anyone you can't rely on your pastor
[2:46:09] right God wants
[2:46:11] you to be a revelation to you amen we
[2:46:15] shouldn't need podcasts
[2:46:19] to remind to to tell us who we
[2:46:22] are but we should wake up in the I'm not
[2:46:25] saying that those things are wrong but
[2:46:26] we should be able to wake up in the
[2:46:28] morning in the strength amen of the
[2:46:32] revelation of who we are though though
[2:46:34] the the rest of the world perish and you
[2:46:37] be the only one left on this world you
[2:46:40] should be able to rise in the strength
[2:46:43] of who you are and fulfill God's will
[2:46:46] for your life amen amen
[2:46:50] think about this Jesus had no one to
[2:46:53] lean
[2:46:55] on he he he didn't have a church to go
[2:46:58] to that preached the open
[2:47:03] book he didn't have a church to go to
[2:47:07] that preached this day this scripture
[2:47:11] that's right the book was
[2:47:15] sealed to the
[2:47:17] church yes that's right but to the
[2:47:22] Masterpiece it was
[2:47:26] open to the
[2:47:29] Masterpiece the book was not sealed the
[2:47:32] mystery of the book was revealed Luke 4
[2:47:36] this day this scripture what was he
[2:47:38] doing he was
[2:47:39] testifying that the book is no more an
[2:47:42] open book but the seven
[2:47:45] seal
[2:47:47] revealed the content of the
[2:47:55] book The Seven
[2:47:57] seal revealed
[2:48:00] himself as being the
[2:48:03] contents of the
[2:48:10] book The Seven seal took the book this
[2:48:14] is not in the script okay the seven seal
[2:48:17] took the book
[2:48:19] remember he was
[2:48:21] seated and he rose and took the
[2:48:24] book out of the hand the book changed
[2:48:28] hands and he opened the book to where it
[2:48:32] was written of
[2:48:34] him who took the
[2:48:40] book the one who took the book was the
[2:48:42] manifestation of the book
[2:48:48] the manifestation of the book took the
[2:48:51] book and opened the
[2:48:54] book where it was written of
[2:48:58] him and said this
[2:49:01] day what did he say I am the
[2:49:03] manifestation of this book sir I come in
[2:49:06] the volume of the book
[2:49:09] yes and they said is that not Joseph's
[2:49:13] son
[2:49:19] the book was open but the book was
[2:49:24] closed the
[2:49:27] lamb come forth and took the
[2:49:31] book Luke
[2:49:35] 4 but it was closed but it was
[2:49:38] open yes but it was open to the
[2:49:42] manifestation of the
[2:49:46] book this is Rich bro
[2:49:49] this this is fresh this is Rich it was
[2:49:52] open to the manifestation of the book
[2:49:54] that's and it was
[2:49:57] closed to those who
[2:50:04] weren't the same way he created the
[2:50:07] first Masterpiece is the same way he's
[2:50:08] going to create the second
[2:50:12] Masterpiece you know Peter James and the
[2:50:14] disciples some I feel like someone's
[2:50:17] thinking went there will you say about
[2:50:18] Peter Jam they weren't a part of the
[2:50:20] manifestation of the Old
[2:50:23] Testament they were a part of the
[2:50:24] manifestation of the New
[2:50:27] Testament but there was
[2:50:30] one there was one who could take that
[2:50:32] book oh boy there was one in Luke 4
[2:50:37] there was one the scripture said he went
[2:50:40] there as as custom as it was as it were
[2:50:43] custom he went to church as it were
[2:50:47] custom but there was
[2:50:49] one who could take the
[2:50:53] book just
[2:50:55] one and what reveal the
[2:51:00] contents no one else was
[2:51:03] worthy no one else was
[2:51:08] able praise God no one else was worthy
[2:51:14] no one else was able
[2:51:19] just
[2:51:25] one that's why the Masterpiece
[2:51:28] really is only ever revealed to the
[2:51:39] Masterpiece oh we're in a good time
[2:51:42] brothers and sisters the problem of God
[2:51:44] say if there's ever a time I could

[2:56:47] earrings hooked out of those girls you
[2:56:49] preach on it bro no he raises the
[2:56:52] standard by raising by opening the word
[2:56:59] am it's manifesting time thank you Lord
[2:57:04] right that's where we are that's that
[2:57:06] that that's where that's where the
[2:57:08] original Masterpiece was and the same
[2:57:10] things have to be here why because God
[2:57:13] is proving his
[2:57:14] Works yes that's right God's proving his
[2:57:17] works it don't matter what comes the
[2:57:20] Masterpiece is the Masterpiece and the
[2:57:22] devil can't make a masterpiece not a
[2:57:26] masterpiece the Masterpiece was will
[2:57:28] always be the Masterpiece it was always
[2:57:31] the Masterpiece that if you're a part of
[2:57:33] that original Masterpiece there's
[2:57:34] nothing on this Earth that Satan can do
[2:57:37] to make you not a part of
[2:57:41] it it's not
[2:57:44] possible praise God that's right amen we
[2:57:48] are his
[2:57:51] workmanship we are his
[2:57:54] workmanship so we thank God Amen we
[2:57:57] thank God we're not our own
[2:57:59] workmanship
[2:58:01] amen amen so the the same way that he
[2:58:04] created the first Masterpiece is the
[2:58:06] same way he's going to take he's going
[2:58:08] to create the second Masterpiece so the
[2:58:11] first Masterpiece was the manifestation
[2:58:13] of the spoken word of
[2:58:15] God so therefore the second Masterpiece
[2:58:17] the bride Masterpiece what she is going
[2:58:20] to be is the manifestation of the spoken
[2:58:22] word of God Amen which means that she
[2:58:24] can't come into full manifestation in
[2:58:27] the third messenger's age the third age
[2:58:29] or the fourth age or the fifth age or
[2:58:31] the or the second age he's got to wait
[2:58:33] until the the word of God has been
[2:58:36] spoken yes that when the once the New
[2:58:38] Testament gospel has been spoken then
[2:58:41] there's going to come a time where the
[2:58:44] second Masterpiece is going to be
[2:58:46] revealed this is why it says in in
[2:58:48] Revelations 10:7 in the days of the
[2:58:50] voice of the seventh what is the seventh
[2:58:52] the last amen people are looking for who
[2:58:56] are looking for an a don't have a
[2:58:58] revelation of the manifestation of the
[2:59:00] word now listen you you don't think that
[2:59:03] that wasn't there in jesus' time right
[2:59:06] oh yeah they put him on a cross and went
[2:59:08] looking for
[2:59:09] another yes he was the manifestation of
[2:59:12] the word of God that's true they cut
[2:59:16] John's head off
[2:59:22] the
[2:59:24] Forerunner why because they didn't
[2:59:26] believe what he
[2:59:28] said but that didn't bother
[2:59:31] God and nor does it today amen when they
[2:59:34] cut the seventh Angel's head off that's
[2:59:37] right it makes no difference I mean that
[2:59:39] didn't happen literally but what I you
[2:59:42] understand what I'm saying that they're
[2:59:44] destroying his influence they're
[2:59:46] destroying his character and by dest
[2:59:48] destroying his character that destroy
[2:59:49] his
[2:59:52] influence but that didn't make any
[2:59:54] difference that doesn't make any
[2:59:55] difference to God and nor does it make
[2:59:57] any difference to the manifestation of
[2:59:59] the
[3:00:01] word so it's not by the word it's by the
[3:00:05] spoken word
[3:00:07] amen it's by the spoken word of God this
[3:00:10] is a spoken word
[3:00:11] bride
[3:00:14] yes she once was an attribute in him
[3:00:17] that's
[3:00:18] then she became the spoken word of God
[3:00:22] hallu Amen she became she was the spoken
[3:00:26] word of
[3:00:28] God and now she has become the
[3:00:30] manifestation of the spoken word of
[3:00:33] God this is why you can't
[3:00:36] disconnect you can't the the original
[3:00:38] Masterpiece you can't you there's no way
[3:00:41] that you could disconnect him from the
[3:00:43] Old Testament
[3:00:45] prophets no it's it's it's not
[3:00:48] possible because he was the word that
[3:00:52] was spoken by the Old Testament
[3:00:56] prophets right so so now in in this time
[3:00:59] you you are the
[3:01:01] word that has been been spoken by the
[3:01:04] seven messengers of the seven Church
[3:01:07] ages you are that
[3:01:10] word you were that word but now that
[3:01:14] word is comeing to manifestation and
[3:01:17] this is why you can't be
[3:01:19] separated from the message of the hour
[3:01:23] yes because you are the very
[3:01:25] manifestation of that
[3:01:27] word I don't know what God's done in
[3:01:30] your life but sometimes God proves
[3:01:34] that because sometimes you try to run
[3:01:37] from this
[3:01:44] message but you realize you can't run
[3:01:47] from something that you a part of well
[3:01:49] you can but you can only run for so
[3:01:52] long that's the truth that's a testimony
[3:01:55] of my life things got too much things
[3:01:58] got too hard I said I'm out of here but
[3:02:00] you can't run from something for too
[3:02:02] long that you're a part of Amen so
[3:02:06] sometimes it's not even the the the the
[3:02:08] the the wrong wrong spirits that come in
[3:02:11] and and try and uh pull you from the the
[3:02:14] message of the hour sometimes it's you
[3:02:17] that's
[3:02:19] sometimes you run from your
[3:02:21] groom but you realize you can't run for
[3:02:24] too
[3:02:25] long because there's only God only
[3:02:27] allows you to go so far and then you you
[3:02:31] you stop running because it's too
[3:02:35] hard you started to run because it's too
[3:02:38] hard but then you stopped running
[3:02:39] because it's too
[3:02:40] [Laughter]
[3:02:44] hard because it's not you it's him it it
[3:02:48] that when things become too hard we put
[3:02:51] too much on
[3:02:53] ourself we do Jesus said come unto me
[3:02:56] all you that are weak and heavy laden I
[3:02:58] will give you rest the the reason that
[3:03:01] Things become too hard is be because we
[3:03:03] haven't given some things to
[3:03:07] him so she's going to be the spoken she
[3:03:10] is the spoken word of God she is the
[3:03:13] manifestation of the word she is the
[3:03:16] word made flesh
[3:03:18] amen God has been working to this point
[3:03:22] God always finishes his projects we are
[3:03:26] his
[3:03:27] workmanship the bride is the workmanship
[3:03:30] of the spoken word of God and that is
[3:03:35] what the evening message has
[3:03:40] produced now if they don't
[3:03:43] like what has been produced that's not
[3:03:47] my
[3:03:51] because they didn't
[3:03:53] like what the Old Testament prophets
[3:03:56] word produced you think because you're
[3:03:59] the bride of Christ you're going to be
[3:04:00] liked
[3:04:02] no
[3:04:04] sorry why you might be liked among
[3:04:07] family you might be liked um by the
[3:04:13] bride but anyone outside of the Bride
[3:04:16] they ain't necessarily going to like
[3:04:17] like you too much amen you might have
[3:04:20] friends or you might have this or you
[3:04:21] might have that but that friendship can
[3:04:23] only go so far this is why it's
[3:04:25] important for young people not to be
[3:04:27] unequally yolked that's
[3:04:31] right because you don't want to be
[3:04:34] married to someone who's not a part of
[3:04:35] the original
[3:04:38] Masterpiece this is why the prophet of
[3:04:40] God said get the Holy Ghost amen he
[3:04:44] didn't say it just to say it he said it
[3:04:47] because the the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[3:04:49] on an individual's life is the evidence
[3:04:50] that they're a part of the Holy a part
[3:04:52] of the Masterpiece and if two if if if a
[3:04:55] boy and a girl come together with the
[3:04:57] Holy Ghost then they're a part of one
[3:04:59] another
[3:05:02] yes all there's some good-looking girls
[3:05:05] out
[3:05:06] there but that don't mean
[3:05:10] nothing because Satan has perverted
[3:05:15] beauty beauty is not on the outside
[3:05:17] beauty is on the
[3:05:20] inside amen so
[3:05:23] uh the scripture says it shall be
[3:05:26] light in the evening
[3:05:29] time huh it shall be light in the
[3:05:32] evening time this is one of the
[3:05:34] prophet's most favorite
[3:05:36] sayings and you say you sometimes think
[3:05:38] man he says that a lot and you just move
[3:05:40] on oh there he goes again and you move
[3:05:43] on but he's saying something without
[3:05:45] saying something
[3:05:48] he's
[3:05:49] testifying that someone's present
[3:05:51] because how else can it be light unless
[3:05:53] there's a man to turn on the
[3:05:55] light all right the only way that it can
[3:05:57] be light in the evening time is if
[3:05:59] there's someone who can turn on the
[3:06:01] light that's right is that right so so
[3:06:04] the reason that that that the the reason
[3:06:06] that you
[3:06:08] see is because someone turned on the
[3:06:10] light that's
[3:06:12] right the reason that you see what God
[3:06:15] desires for you to see is because
[3:06:18] someone turned on the light that's true
[3:06:20] and when the light is turned on it
[3:06:21] pushes back Darkness amen but there is a
[3:06:25] man who can turn on the light the reason
[3:06:27] that I can see myself the way that I see
[3:06:30] myself today is because someone turned
[3:06:32] on the light but there's only one who
[3:06:35] can turn on the light Hallelujah all
[3:06:37] right it's not men who can turn on the
[3:06:39] light there is a man who can turn on the
[3:06:41] light yes and this is why I am seeing
[3:06:44] myself
[3:06:45] different all the time
[3:06:49] why because I believe the light is not
[3:06:51] just a flick of a switch but the light
[3:06:53] is like a
[3:06:54] dimmer but God is increasing the
[3:06:57] intensity of the light and as the
[3:07:00] intensity of the light increases it just
[3:07:02] pushes back the darkness it's it's
[3:07:06] natural the light doesn't have to say
[3:07:08] okay come on let's have you you know let
[3:07:09] us see who can win this battle ah the
[3:07:12] light just comes on and the Darkness go
[3:07:14] po say where did it go
[3:07:17] he turn it off poo comes back turn it on
[3:07:20] poof he
[3:07:22] goes but God doesn't have a switch on
[3:07:25] and a switch
[3:07:26] off it's a
[3:07:28] dimmer so the intensity is becoming
[3:07:31] greater that's right and the in as the
[3:07:35] intensity
[3:07:36] increases it's pushing back my own
[3:07:40] ideas it's pushing back my own thoughts
[3:07:43] it's pushing back my family traditions
[3:07:46] it's pushing back my family culture it's
[3:07:49] pushing back Church culture it's p
[3:07:52] pushing back Australian
[3:07:58] culture but it's being
[3:08:01] replaced by
[3:08:08] light it's being
[3:08:10] replaced by
[3:08:12] light God doesn't empty the house to
[3:08:16] keep it empty
[3:08:19] the reason he's emptying it is to fill
[3:08:23] it so
[3:08:25] light is taking the
[3:08:28] place of
[3:08:31] Darkness cuz my own idea is darkness my
[3:08:35] way of thinking is darkness my culture
[3:08:39] is Darkness the Australian culture is
[3:08:42] Darkness the lwf culture is Darkness
[3:08:47] but he's not just throwing out Darkness
[3:08:50] but how he is throwing out darkness is
[3:08:53] replacing
[3:08:54] it with
[3:08:56] light he's replacing
[3:09:00] it with
[3:09:05] himself so the only thing that will be
[3:09:10] left is
[3:09:15] him he's everything other than him is
[3:09:19] Darkness
[3:09:22] true the only thing that will be
[3:09:26] left is the word which is the
[3:09:30] light the manifestation of the word is
[3:09:34] light the only thing that will be left
[3:09:38] is the manifestation of the word this is
[3:09:41] why you can't
[3:09:43] parent like your dad did
[3:09:48] you can't you fail you fail you you you
[3:09:52] fail anyway but you understand what I
[3:09:53] mean you say well my dad was successful
[3:09:56] so I'm going to parent the way he
[3:09:57] parented it's not going to
[3:09:59] work my dad was a a successful Pastor so
[3:10:02] I'm going to Pastor the way he did not
[3:10:04] going to
[3:10:05] work not going to work you you can take
[3:10:08] what he did but you got to add to
[3:10:11] it you can take what your parents did
[3:10:14] but now God's opening the word and he's
[3:10:16] adding two
[3:10:18] what your parents did because your
[3:10:20] parents operated at a level that the
[3:10:23] book was
[3:10:24] open this is I said this yesterday this
[3:10:27] is why you shouldn't kick
[3:10:29] yourself and and because now you're up
[3:10:32] here but you parented down here and now
[3:10:36] up here you say I wish I had
[3:10:38] a I should
[3:10:42] have but the reason that you can say
[3:10:44] that you couldn't say that here because
[3:10:46] when you were here you are parenting to
[3:10:48] the fullest of the knowledge that you
[3:10:49] had the fullest of the Revelation that
[3:10:51] you had that's how you parented that's
[3:10:53] how you you husband right Lord but the
[3:10:57] reason you can say I should have is
[3:10:59] because the words opened and the words
[3:11:01] lifted you up and now you can look back
[3:11:05] and
[3:11:06] down in Hinds side I say I shouldn't
[3:11:09] have done
[3:11:11] that well you're right you you shouldn't
[3:11:14] have but you didn't know that then
[3:11:17] but because now now your children are
[3:11:21] here right and this is why when as a as
[3:11:25] a mother and a father we sit down with
[3:11:27] our children and we talk about
[3:11:28] Parenthood and we talk about well this
[3:11:30] is what we this this is how we did it
[3:11:32] but what we realiz is that we did it
[3:11:37] wrong but it's not wrong as in we
[3:11:40] rebelled that's right you know we went
[3:11:43] again we didn't go against the word we
[3:11:45] didn't know
[3:11:48] and God doesn't hold you accountable for
[3:11:50] what you don't know so stop causing
[3:11:53] yourself stop beating yourself up about
[3:11:56] things and causing your causing yourself
[3:11:58] to become accountable for things that
[3:12:00] you didn't know you got to stop that
[3:12:04] God's in
[3:12:06] control otherwise you'll live in the
[3:12:10] past right and what happens when you
[3:12:12] live in the past you repeat it
[3:12:18] either you repeat it or your kids
[3:12:23] will God doesn't hold you accountable
[3:12:26] for what you don't know am but we're
[3:12:31] growing my goodness if I look at the way
[3:12:33] that I was a husband to my wife when I
[3:12:35] get married 30 years
[3:12:40] ago I wish I
[3:12:43] had you got to stop that although I wish
[3:12:47] I did cuz it would have saved her a lot
[3:12:49] of
[3:12:50] pain but I didn't
[3:12:54] know but what I know now I can put into
[3:12:57] practice amen I don't have to repeat
[3:12:59] history I don't have to be a husband
[3:13:01] like I was a husband 30 years ago God's
[3:13:03] given me the ability to come up higher
[3:13:06] thank you
[3:13:10] Lord how how could
[3:13:13] John how could John see
[3:13:18] Revelations 4 when he was in Revelations
[3:13:21] 3 that's
[3:13:25] right and John got the revelations 4 and
[3:13:27] he said man I wish I knew this when I
[3:13:29] was in Revelations
[3:13:30] 3 I wouldn't have made all these
[3:13:33] mistakes but God said the reason that
[3:13:36] you weren't up here is because I it
[3:13:37] wasn't time for you to be up here the
[3:13:39] reason you can say that now it's because
[3:13:41] I have invited you up and I have lifted
[3:13:43] you up and I have given you a heavenly
[3:13:45] vision and now you can look back down
[3:13:47] and say man I wish I had what I had now
[3:13:49] down
[3:13:50] there well we do the same thing in
[3:13:53] fatherhood we do the same thing in
[3:13:54] motherhood we do the same thing as a as
[3:13:56] a as a as a wife we do the same thing as
[3:13:59] a husband we do the same thing
[3:14:06] pastoring God's in
[3:14:10] control God's God's the one that lifts
[3:14:13] us God's the one that raises us go God
[3:14:16] God the one that allows us to do
[3:14:20] better my wife should say praise
[3:14:28] God amen
[3:14:32] amen praise the
[3:14:36] Lord so now
[3:14:38] we're we're we're we're we're living in
[3:14:41] a time I'm going to finish this here
[3:14:45] where what is what is the time
[3:14:49] uh 10 10 10 oh no 12:30 is that right
[3:14:55] 12:30 quarter to one okay let's let's
[3:14:58] finish
[3:14:59] here so we're living in a time
[3:15:02] now where
[3:15:05] God through a
[3:15:10] forerunner through a
[3:15:14] message is revealing his second
[3:15:18] Masterpiece to the master to
[3:15:21] herself brothers and sisters not to the
[3:15:27] world not to Mom and Dad
[3:15:31] perhaps this is
[3:15:33] personal this is I'll meet you in their
[3:15:36] moment this is where my wife's song come
[3:15:39] from this this is this is that
[3:15:43] moment this is uh a moment where where
[3:15:47] we're living in a time now where the the
[3:15:49] the shadow of Isaac taking Rebecca into
[3:15:52] the tent we're living in that
[3:15:55] time we're living in that time where
[3:15:59] Isaac broke the
[3:16:04] veil of
[3:16:07] Rebecca he broke the
[3:16:11] Seal of
[3:16:13] Rebecca in that
[3:16:15] tent yes
[3:16:17] and she could never be the
[3:16:22] same
[3:16:24] after that
[3:16:30] meeting this is what God desires for
[3:16:37] you as Isaac came to Rebecca they were
[3:16:43] moving toward one another
[3:16:47] as Isaac came to
[3:16:50] Rebecca this is God's desire for
[3:16:55] you you're
[3:16:57] moving it's his desire for you to
[3:17:02] meet and become
[3:17:05] one and break the
[3:17:08] seal from around your life the day of
[3:17:12] redemption is here
[3:17:17] this is God's desire for
[3:17:19] you I think it's interesting when the
[3:17:22] prophet talks about the third pool and
[3:17:24] his he he's up on the mountain and he
[3:17:26] said I had my hands
[3:17:30] raised but then he said a sword drop
[3:17:33] down into my
[3:17:36] hand so he raised his hands but as he
[3:17:39] was raising his hands there was a sword
[3:17:44] coming see the third pull is all about a
[3:17:48] meeting I'll meet you in there the sword
[3:17:52] coming to the hand it's about a union
[3:17:55] it's about two people becoming
[3:17:58] one how by God removing the
[3:18:03] veil from your life amen amen we are
[3:18:07] living in that time we're living in the
[3:18:11] time of the
[3:18:13] unveiling Rebecca was reveal red Isaac
[3:18:18] revealed
[3:18:19] Rebecca Isaac revealed Rebecca to
[3:18:23] Rebecca that's right Rebecca didn't
[3:18:26] fully understand the
[3:18:28] connection between her and him but he
[3:18:33] revealed her to her amen she was not a
[3:18:38] mystery to
[3:18:40] him she was a mystery to
[3:18:44] herself you are not a mystery to
[3:18:47] him but you are a mystery to
[3:18:50] yourself God is revealing you to
[3:18:54] you amen Rebeca Isaac is speaking to
[3:18:58] Rebecca saying what I am you
[3:19:02] are amen what I am you are they were in
[3:19:08] Fellowship they were there was a man in
[3:19:11] that tent who could turn on the light
[3:19:13] yes concerning Rebecca and push back all
[3:19:17] spiritual Amnesia that she might have
[3:19:19] had he pushed that back there was a man
[3:19:22] who can turn on the light there was only
[3:19:24] one eler couldn't do
[3:19:28] it right ela's work was
[3:19:32] done but there was one who had to come
[3:19:34] on the scene to reveal the Masterpiece
[3:19:37] to the
[3:19:42] Masterpiece William bram's work is done
[3:19:48] the man is it's
[3:19:50] done people want to say well he didn't
[3:19:53] finish his work well that's your
[3:19:59] opinion as it was in the time of if I
[3:20:03] can just dramatize a little bit there
[3:20:04] were th those people in the days of
[3:20:06] Isaac and Rebecca
[3:20:08] yes Isaac Ela never finished his work
[3:20:13] Rebecca could look at him say you blind
[3:20:16] leaders of the
[3:20:17] blind what in this world are you talking
[3:20:20] about I know he's finished his
[3:20:25] work you can't tell me that and it
[3:20:30] influenced me to doubt I know who I
[3:20:35] am
[3:20:39] amen do we thank God
[3:20:42] Amen that we're living in that time yes
[3:20:48] it's a precious
[3:20:53] time it's a time of
[3:20:59] intimacy it's a time where my
[3:21:04] intimacy with my
[3:21:06] Lord is
[3:21:09] growing and you know what that
[3:21:12] does it
[3:21:14] causes an intimacy
[3:21:17] between me and my
[3:21:21] wife it causes
[3:21:26] it I I could say it a little different
[3:21:29] it causes a
[3:21:32] growth in my
[3:21:34] Intimacy in my level of intimacy with my
[3:21:42] wife because what happens between me and
[3:21:45] God
[3:21:47] is reflected between me and my
[3:21:52] wife this is why we can't be who we are
[3:21:55] are ordained to be without the Lord in
[3:22:00] our
[3:22:01] lives but when when when he increases
[3:22:04] when he when he increases when he his
[3:22:08] when
[3:22:10] he reveals a further revelation of
[3:22:14] himself to me it has has an effect here
[3:22:18] it has an effect on this
[3:22:20] level Earth
[3:22:28] level it has an effect how I
[3:22:34] father you know what that causes to
[3:22:36] happen it it's the same thing with my
[3:22:38] wife when when God reveals things to my
[3:22:42] wife it causes her it causes a change in
[3:22:46] her relationship with
[3:22:50] me this is why we're dependent upon God
[3:22:53] to be who we're called to be in this
[3:22:56] hour and we can't be
[3:22:59] it by
[3:23:03] education we can't be it by more
[3:23:05] services if you understand what I mean
[3:23:08] if we have more services then will know
[3:23:11] more
[3:23:12] no no there's nothing wrong with having
[3:23:15] more services but come to
[3:23:18] service with the understanding you can't
[3:23:21] do it you come into these doors say Lord
[3:23:24] I I know what needs to be done but I
[3:23:26] can't do it I'm depending on you oh you
[3:23:30] watch God
[3:23:31] move and the prophet of God knew that
[3:23:34] the those seals had to be open but he
[3:23:36] couldn't do it he couldn't do it himself
[3:23:40] he knew what needed to be done but he
[3:23:42] couldn't do
[3:23:45] it as a a husband I I know if I can just
[3:23:49] say if I can speak for two weeks ago all
[3:23:51] right I knew I knew that I could be
[3:23:57] better but I can't produce
[3:24:02] it but there's something within me that
[3:24:05] knows I could be
[3:24:09] better but you know I I look at the the
[3:24:12] master Craftsman I I say Lord
[3:24:17] I I know it needs to be done but I can't
[3:24:19] do it and would would you do
[3:24:23] it you know what he does he takes his he
[3:24:26] he he takes takes his word and he
[3:24:29] reveals it and in the revealing of the
[3:24:32] word it breaks things
[3:24:35] away that have been causing me not to be
[3:24:40] who I desire to
[3:24:43] be brother the look you you got from
[3:24:46] glory to glory
[3:24:48] right God does that and then you say wow
[3:24:52] Lord there there's
[3:24:54] more it's like John went to from
[3:24:57] Revelations 3 to Revelations 4 but then
[3:24:59] he went from Revelations 4 to
[3:25:00] Revelations 5 Revelations 5 to
[3:25:02] Revelation 6 and Revelation 6 to
[3:25:04] Revelation 7 Revelation 7 to Revelations
[3:25:06] 8 it was a it was a journey there there
[3:25:08] was more there was more there was more
[3:25:10] there was War One seal another seal
[3:25:12] another seal another seal that's right
[3:25:15] there's more
[3:25:20] praise God we're depending on
[3:25:23] him brother ELR if you'd like to come
[3:25:26] God bless
[3:25:27] you trust you have a blessed afternoon
[3:25:30] and I'd like to if the Lord will we'll
[3:25:32] we'll pick this up this afternoon and
[3:25:34] look at some slides of uh Genesis 2 and
[3:25:37] Revelations chapter 5 so God bless you
[3:25:41] all
[3:25:43] amen thanks BR God bless you
[3:25:58] that was absolutely action-packed
[3:26:02] that's absolutely wonderful you know I I
[3:26:05] um I was thinking as brother Daniel was
[3:26:08] preaching you can start playing that
[3:26:09] song so long
[3:26:11] um you know even maybe a year ago we
[3:26:15] couldn't say many these things amen and
[3:26:18] and it's just so wonderful how God is
[3:26:20] revealing more and more um brother
[3:26:22] Daniel made made a statement he said he
[3:26:25] said you have the spoken word and then
[3:26:27] you have the manifestation and the
[3:26:29] manifestation is real already but it
[3:26:32] takes time for the Revelation to hit
[3:26:35] that's exactly where we're at amen the
[3:26:38] manifestation is here Christ is here
[3:26:41] amen and it's and it's and we've been
[3:26:43] saying it for years but God God is
[3:26:46] revealing just a little more and a
[3:26:47] little more and he summarized it so
[3:26:49] beautifully here at the end when he said
[3:26:51] it's a dimmer switch it's not just a
[3:26:53] flick and it's all on that will blow us
[3:26:55] away amen that will blow the fuse but
[3:26:59] it's a dmer switch and God is just
[3:27:00] turning up the D dmer switch just little
[3:27:02] by little by little and we're just
[3:27:04] seeing more and more and more and I I I
[3:27:07] just I love how God does things and I
[3:27:09] also love how God come uses a vessel
[3:27:13] that is wired differently made
[3:27:15] differently says things differently as
[3:27:17] we're looking at the same word
[3:27:20] amen hallelujah um the other thing I
[3:27:23] want to just mention is Luke 4 that Luke
[3:27:26] 4 will never be the same for me I mean
[3:27:29] Luke 4 and Revelation 5 coming together
[3:27:31] just so beautiful I mean when the
[3:27:34] bridegroom
[3:27:35] Masterpiece Hallelujah took the book
[3:27:37] opened the book and identified that's me
[3:27:40] this day the scripture is fulfilled amen
[3:27:44] hallelujah and and what happened in in
[3:27:47] Luke 4 they raised up and said well
[3:27:49] who's this guy don't me know he's you
[3:27:52] know isn't this Joseph's son and so and
[3:27:54] what did it cause them the religious
[3:27:56] leaders wanted to crucify him wanted to
[3:27:58] Stone him there I mean for what for
[3:28:01] identifying this is me Hallelujah
[3:28:04] because they couldn't handle the
[3:28:06] Revelation but they couldn't stop the
[3:28:08] Masterpiece hey amen praise the Lord
