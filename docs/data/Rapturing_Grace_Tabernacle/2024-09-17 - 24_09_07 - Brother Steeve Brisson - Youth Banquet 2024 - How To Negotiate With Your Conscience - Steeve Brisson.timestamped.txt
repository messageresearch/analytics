[0:00] right God bless you all it's be
[0:03] privileged to be back again tonight you
[0:06] all looking good all pumped up and
[0:11] shiny amen so we um going to share the
[0:16] word of God tonight um we're going to
[0:19] turn in our Bible you might not have
[0:20] your Bible tonight but we will
[0:23] uh read a scripture in
[0:26] Acts uh chapter 24
[0:44] verse
[0:49] 16 I got a different version here on the
[0:51] screen um it's from a different version
[0:54] more like a simplified English King
[0:56] James is I'm French so King James
[0:58] Sometimes is a bit difficult it's all
[1:00] English it's a bit uh difficult to
[1:02] understand so some of the some of the
[1:04] slides tonight is going to be of a more
[1:06] simplified version I wanted to make sure
[1:08] that it kept the the good meaning uh
[1:11] because you know we believe the J King
[1:13] James is accurate so we going to read
[1:16] from verse 16 and Ain do I exercise
[1:18] myself to have always a conscience void
[1:20] of offense offense towards God and
[1:24] toward men let's bow ahead Lord Jesus we
[1:27] want to thank you tonight we are
[1:29] gathered we had we have good fellowship
[1:31] and we had good food and certainly we
[1:35] want to put it this time aside Lord for
[1:36] the spiritual food turning our eyes
[1:39] towards you waiting upon you for you to
[1:42] speak to our hearts we want to pause
[1:44] Lord this evening and to stop everything
[1:47] we're doing to wait upon you Lord we ask
[1:50] you to take control over every Spirit of
[1:52] our over our mind my thoughts everything
[1:55] that I am I want to surrender to myself
[1:57] to you tonight so you can have the
[1:59] freedom to move through me through your
[2:02] people so that we get closer to you and
[2:04] have a greater understanding Lord free
[2:06] Us by your truth tonight we pray in
[2:08] Jesus name amen you may be
[2:14] seated so tonight I want to speak on how
[2:16] do you negotiate with your
[2:18] conscience maybe a peculiar
[2:21] topic but I want to introduce this
[2:24] topic
[2:26] um just to give you maybe a background
[2:29] where I come from with this topic I was
[2:32] uh when I was 2 years old my mom gave
[2:33] her gave her life to the Lord so I was
[2:36] raised in church like most of
[2:38] you
[2:40] and been raising church you've uh have
[2:43] your conscience shaped by a Christian
[2:46] environment Christian parents church
[2:48] you've been to
[2:51] and now today I'm 47 I had five children
[2:54] so I've I've been raised by a mother
[2:56] then I've became a minister became a
[2:58] pastor raised my my own children saw the
[3:02] effect of raising children in a certain
[3:06] Manner and it really inspired me to make
[3:11] this study that we going to do together
[3:13] tonight as a little
[3:15] journey and so for me the conscience
[3:19] always been a little bit something that
[3:21] I did not understand well and I pray
[3:24] tonight that through the study of this
[3:27] topic it may help maybe someone to be
[3:31] able to navigate and to understand
[3:33] what's the
[3:35] conscience what's the use of that and
[3:38] how God wants to use
[3:40] it because if God send it it's for us it
[3:44] has a meaning so we want maybe to better
[3:47] understand that so we've read the acts
[3:49] and I want also want to read in 1
[3:51] Timothy chapter 3 Paul is says holding
[3:54] the mystery of the faith in a pure
[3:56] conscience obviously here he's talking
[3:58] about church officers that you know they
[4:00] must not be Liars heavy drinkers but I
[4:02] think that all all of us we have to be
[4:05] uh uh in pure conscience we don't have
[4:08] have something that we are bearing that
[4:11] that that it's you know when we have a
[4:13] heavy conscience when we feel guilty
[4:14] about something and so it's something
[4:16] that we want to understand tonight so
[4:18] before we go along with the subject we
[4:20] want may maybe want to understand how
[4:22] where where that comes from and how it
[4:23] was shaped how was your conscience was
[4:26] shaped so as a young child you know a
[4:27] young child does not know at first
[4:29] whether is gestures are wrong are right
[4:31] or wrong it is the reaction of the
[4:33] people around him that allows him to
[4:34] know so basically when you were a kid
[4:36] you didn't know what was right what was
[4:38] wrong so you have to look to your
[4:39] parents to see if what you're doing was
[4:42] right or it was wrong right and so you
[4:45] know you wanted a toy and you slap your
[4:48] sister to get the toy and then mommy's
[4:50] around and says no no don't do that he
[4:52] like what's wrong I want the toy and
[4:54] then you learn that you know there's
[4:56] there's things that are good and and
[4:58] things that are are are wrong but you
[5:01] know moral conscience represent a person
[5:03] ability to consider the views of others
[5:05] before acting true moral awareness a
[5:08] person is able to assess the
[5:10] consequences of their actions on others
[5:12] and understand whether that they are
[5:14] what they are doing is right or wrong
[5:17] the moral conscience therefore makes it
[5:19] possible to J judge what behaviors are
[5:21] acceptable or not we're just starting
[5:24] with really really basic stuff here a
[5:26] child's morals conscience develop little
[5:29] by little as observes the reaction of
[5:30] adults to the action he takes this
[5:33] awareness also sets in as he develops
[5:35] his social skills and learns to take
[5:37] into account what others are feeling it
[5:40] is it is thanks to moral awareness that
[5:42] a child learns to control himself and
[5:44] that he becomes aware of the
[5:45] responsibility of his action it is
[5:47] therefore essential to live well with
[5:49] others however a child's moral
[5:51] conscience is not fully acquired until
[5:53] the age of seven of or eight where where
[5:55] we we say that it's the Age of Reason
[5:57] where you start to realize for yourself
[6:00] that's why obviously sometime you know
[6:02] it's around 7 8 9 10 year old sometime
[6:05] that you have a a child has been raised
[6:07] in church and suddenly he realized he's
[6:09] a sinner he realized he's a sinner and
[6:12] he wants to serve the Lord and remember
[6:14] at 8-year-old that's a decision I took
[6:16] my wife was a similar age 8year old she
[6:18] gave her life to the Lord got baptized I
[6:20] got baptized at 8-y old because
[6:22] something came on me and I wanted and
[6:24] something came inside of me it's like I
[6:25] want to be a Christian before that I I
[6:28] didn't have that awareness I was just
[6:30] you know with my mother and everything
[6:31] was okay but when that awareness when
[6:33] when your conscience is being developed
[6:35] and even my children some of them that
[6:37] awareness came at at an early age look
[6:40] it's the age of of Reason where your
[6:42] conscience is being
[6:46] shaped but you need others to do that
[6:48] you know even in the in the so those who
[6:50] sell puppies you know they raise dogs
[6:52] they breed dogs they sell puppies
[6:55] there's there's I don't remember what
[6:56] age but if you take a you buy a puppy
[6:59] way too early you know what he's doing
[7:02] he
[7:03] bites and and and and the reason is is
[7:06] that he has to grow a couple of months
[7:08] or this couple of weeks I don't remember
[7:09] the exact date but the principle is that
[7:12] you have he has to stay with his sibling
[7:14] and his mother because that's where he's
[7:16] going to learn that bite biting hurts
[7:19] because when he bites his sister or he
[7:21] bites his his his his brother they they
[7:24] yell and then they learn oh okay I got
[7:26] teeth and and if I and if I bite it
[7:28] hurts and so they said say that if even
[7:30] when you buy want to buy a puppy you
[7:31] don't buy it too early because there is
[7:33] a raising there's an awareness in their
[7:36] own language there's stuff they need to
[7:37] learn so imagine if we have that with
[7:40] dogs what about us right and
[7:49] so for example your toddler understand
[7:52] that it's wrong to hit the sister
[7:54] because you intervene and learns that
[7:56] it's nice to let him toys or give him a
[7:58] hug because you Praise Him however
[8:01] because your child is still has little
[8:04] self-control it is still open the case
[8:06] that if that is or her impulse are
[8:09] greater than his or her fear of being
[8:11] punished so at one point it becomes a
[8:13] balance into how much pleasure than I
[8:15] can get out of this and what's the level
[8:18] of pain with the punishment and you want
[8:20] to balance it out right you know you
[8:23] have some children sometime that you
[8:24] know they want something so bad they're
[8:26] not afraid of the
[8:27] punishment because their conscience is
[8:31] all only shape in a matter of it's not
[8:34] right or wrong is is how much I want
[8:38] it okay so the Bible is clear with that
[8:42] that the Bible says that wherefore ye
[8:44] must need be subject not only for wrath
[8:47] but also for conscience sake so the
[8:49] Bible says that we should be able to
[8:51] subject and obey the word of God not by
[8:53] fear of being punished but because we
[8:56] have a conscience that tells us that
[8:59] this is is
[9:01] wrong now but the conscience as we made
[9:04] a quick thought here our conscience has
[9:08] been shaped by the environment we've
[9:11] been raised in some of you have been
[9:13] raised by parents that it's really
[9:14] strict they live in a small box other
[9:17] have been raised in a family where the
[9:19] box is is is bigger and and that your
[9:22] parents have been influenced where with
[9:23] their background how strict their
[9:25] parents was or maybe in what church they
[9:27] were or church is really really strict
[9:30] a lot of rules a lot of spying on each
[9:32] other you know this brother this this so
[9:34] so and the pastor come the deacons calls
[9:35] you and everything is so strict people
[9:37] live in a small box everything is wrong
[9:41] everything is a
[9:42] sin you got other people that you know
[9:45] they don't have a conscience as much
[9:46] it's like the box is box is way too
[9:50] bigger and you want to judge if some
[9:53] somebody has
[9:54] been um raised too strict
[9:59] you and maybe some of you will remember
[10:02] but you want to see if if your a child
[10:05] has been under way too much pressure is
[10:08] if they spill a glass of water at the
[10:09] table they spill a glass of water at the
[10:12] table and they start
[10:13] crying if you have that is that that
[10:16] that kid's been raised under way too
[10:18] much pressure and that in spilling the
[10:21] glass of water something inside of him
[10:23] breaks down and he start crying because
[10:25] he realized this is a fatal
[10:27] mistake and if you have that kind of
[10:29] reaction it it should tell you even
[10:32] you're going to raise kids later if your
[10:33] kids do that you putting way too much
[10:36] pressure on him because you know uh uh
[10:40] to spill a glass of water is not the end
[10:41] of the world all right so the reaction
[10:44] should be you know
[10:47] oops you know you're not start crying it
[10:49] should be oops you know I need a towel
[10:52] and I will I will clean that quickly
[10:54] right so there he's not falling apart
[10:57] inside but he considered that oops you
[10:59] know I I I will fix this but I can move
[11:04] on
[11:05] okay and then you got this other one
[11:08] that you know spills it and he think
[11:10] it's
[11:11] funny spills a glass of water and it is
[11:14] like that's not a big deal and
[11:15] everybody's like well do something about
[11:18] it right you just feel like it's not the
[11:20] end of the world but you know this is a
[11:22] mistake and you should to be you should
[11:25] be doing something about the mistake you
[11:27] did to fix it because it is a mistake
[11:29] right and then you got this kid who
[11:31] spills you know tons of glass of water
[11:34] and for him it's fun because he lives in
[11:35] a world where nothing
[11:40] matters so maybe in this room we have
[11:44] those four different
[11:46] kids that one that's put way too
[11:50] much on his
[11:52] shoulder and the other the other one
[11:54] like nothing bothers
[12:00] and so it's really important how we've
[12:01] been raised but our
[12:06] conscience is being shaped by the way
[12:09] we've been raised now when we are
[12:11] Christians sometime we
[12:15] wonder is my conscience is is it the
[12:18] word of
[12:19] God or is it
[12:23] God or the conscience is a self dialogue
[12:28] kind of a conversation you have with
[12:31] yourself about what's wrong and what's
[12:34] right right so we want to study that
[12:37] tonight because sometime it can be
[12:39] confusing it was confusing for me I was
[12:41] raised in a really really tight and
[12:43] strict environment way too tight way too
[12:48] strict and is it it has damaged me in a
[12:52] sense that when you've been raised in
[12:55] such a strict environment you live in a
[12:57] small box and in a small box there's no
[13:02] Oxygen I can tell you my testimony I was
[13:04] raised so so so tight that when I was 16
[13:08] my mom backslid I was just raised with
[13:11] my mother no sibling no father so I was
[13:13] just living with my mother and usually
[13:14] you know teenagers again made me have
[13:16] some rough time and they run away from
[13:17] home in my situation it was the contrary
[13:20] my mom had some rough time and she left
[13:22] the house back slid and went to live
[13:24] with a man and I ended up at 16 by
[13:28] myself when that happened I said you
[13:30] know I'll keep going to church CU I'm
[13:33] I'm not going to church because of my
[13:34] mother I'm going to church because I
[13:36] want to save the Lord serve the Lord
[13:39] that's what I thought that's what I
[13:42] wanted but you know what
[13:44] happened when we live in a such a tight
[13:47] environment we're never able to take
[13:50] decision for
[13:51] ourself and so we don't know exactly
[13:54] what we think we don't know exactly what
[13:57] we believe because there's always
[13:59] someone that
[14:00] intervene before we are able to face our
[14:03] own decision most of you you know you're
[14:06] teenagers we have adults here and that's
[14:08] a transition it should be a healthy
[14:12] transition when we become a teenager as
[14:15] we move adult into adulthood where or
[14:17] the parents you know they slowly backed
[14:20] off and let you take some of the
[14:21] decision what happened with me is I went
[14:24] from full control to No Control at all
[14:29] yeah so guess what
[14:31] happened within a year I was in
[14:34] jail I ended up in police station
[14:37] sleeping there sleeping there because of
[14:39] a robbery a failed one praise the Lord
[14:42] my career didn't last really
[14:45] long and know I got arrested and then
[14:49] the judge asked for
[14:50] a evaluation you know psychological
[14:53] evaluation of this young boy 18-year-old
[14:56] that just con committed a robbery so I
[14:59] was interviewed by a psychologist and he
[15:01] asked me all kind of question interview
[15:02] my mother and you know what was the
[15:04] report at the
[15:05] end this young man was raised in such a
[15:08] tight
[15:09] environment and overnight he became free
[15:13] and couldn't handle that
[15:18] freedom because I went from totally
[15:21] control and so I was living in the box
[15:24] of my
[15:26] mother but I didn't have any
[15:31] myself I didn't have any cons I lost it
[15:35] because I was I became drunk on
[15:40] freedom freedom yeah so-called Freedom
[15:45] sometime this happen when a teenager
[15:46] gets a car and suddenly he can escape or
[15:50] he's get a moped how you call this a
[15:52] scooter a moped how do you call that you
[15:54] got this here New Zealand you get a
[15:57] moped back in Quebec Canada you get a
[15:59] moped at 14
[16:01] Freedom you can go much further than a
[16:08] petson so you get a car and suddenly the
[16:11] parents are kind of panicking a little
[16:13] bit okay you got your car but now you
[16:15] know time out you got to come back home
[16:17] at this and and they try to help you
[16:21] budget and manage this new acquired
[16:24] freedom because we can be get drunk on
[16:27] freedom where suddenly we realize
[16:30] finally there's no limits and when you
[16:33] have that feeling you're proving
[16:35] yourself that you were living under the
[16:38] conscience of your parents which is
[16:40] perfectly normal because the Bible says
[16:42] obey your parents so obey your parents
[16:45] means obey they conscience their
[16:49] conscience because it's not just about
[16:51] the word of God because there's many
[16:53] things in the rule it's not in the word
[16:55] of God like you know when it's the time
[16:58] to have a meal everybody sits at the
[17:00] table when we're finished I want you to
[17:02] take your plate and bring it to the
[17:03] counter that's not the word of God
[17:05] that's what your parents is asking based
[17:08] on what they think is proper are you
[17:10] with me and so you follow the in the
[17:13] Bible God is asking you to follow along
[17:16] that line because you got to live with
[17:19] the box of your parents but we we have
[17:22] to be able to transition into try to
[17:24] find out what do I believe
[17:30] so sometime we I have thought maybe for
[17:34] years and sometime we think that we all
[17:37] have the same
[17:40] conscience but we don't have all the
[17:42] same
[17:43] conscience the Bible says that some
[17:46] people believe this and some people
[17:48] believe that and Paul is not trying to
[17:50] say that we should have all the same
[17:52] conscience but the Bible says that we
[17:54] should respect each other's conscience
[17:57] you got that in first Corinthians
[17:59] chapter
[18:00] 8:7 not and it's a modern version but it
[18:03] says the same thing but in easier
[18:06] English not everyone knows these things
[18:08] in fact many people this is talking
[18:10] about eating Uh u a meat that's been
[18:13] sacrificed to Idols it used to be a big
[18:15] topic it is not anymore but just to give
[18:17] you an example not everyone knows these
[18:20] things in fact many people have grown up
[18:22] with the belief that Idols have life in
[18:25] them so when they eat meat offered to
[18:27] Idols they are bought bed by a weak
[18:31] conscience but food doesn't bring us any
[18:33] closer to God we are wor we are no worst
[18:35] off if we don't eat and we are no better
[18:38] off if we do so the Bible says that
[18:41] there you know they've been grown up
[18:42] with a belief you know so they've grown
[18:44] up with a conscience that when if they
[18:47] if they eat you know meat that was
[18:50] sacrificed in satanic temple they felt
[18:53] in their heart in their conscience that
[18:55] they would be defiled and they couldn't
[18:57] do it
[18:59] but others they say you know that's not
[19:01] a big deal Idols are
[19:02] nothing so that meat is not corrupt meat
[19:05] is meat and so Paul is not saying we
[19:08] should all believe the same but Paul say
[19:12] you should respect your brother or your
[19:15] sister's conscience that is
[19:17] weaker so that means that we don't have
[19:20] the same conscience and the Bible is not
[19:22] trying to press Us in that we should all
[19:26] be the same but we should respect each
[19:28] other
[19:33] don't cause problem for someone with a
[19:35] weak conscience just because you have
[19:37] the right to eat anything you know all
[19:40] this and so it doesn't bother you to eat
[19:42] in the temple of an idol but suppose a
[19:45] person with a weak conscience sees you
[19:47] and decides to eat food that food that
[19:50] has been offered to Idols then what you
[19:53] know has destroyed someone Christ died
[19:56] for when you sin by hurting a follower
[20:00] with a weak conscience you sin against
[20:03] Christ for many years people in church
[20:07] have tried to have everybody doing
[20:09] exactly the same thing and having the
[20:11] exact same standard and that was a
[20:14] mistake because that's not what the
[20:16] bible teach and I'm not talking about
[20:18] well I want to kill someone and you
[20:19] don't feel like doing it so you know you
[20:21] should respect me I'm not talking about
[20:23] clearcut word of God there's many great
[20:27] areas that people are tried to enforce
[20:29] on other people that's right I remember
[20:32] when I was young in church there was a
[20:33] brother going around it's telling you if
[20:35] you have a baseball cap with a sign or a
[20:37] shirt with a trademark he said that that
[20:39] we that these were idols and and and
[20:42] that we should not have any trademark he
[20:44] was trying to tell everybody that this
[20:46] was wrong or another brother if you had
[20:49] glasses that were a little bit mirror
[20:51] that was hypocrite cuz you're hiding
[20:52] your highs and and so well if you
[20:55] believe that it's good for you but you
[20:57] cannot enforce that on
[20:59] everybody you're with me because the
[21:02] Bible says we have different
[21:06] conscience now some of you here are
[21:08] young enough that you still have to obey
[21:11] because you'll be
[21:13] blessed by obeying your parents even
[21:16] though you know my my kids are old
[21:18] enough as I said I'm preaching this and
[21:20] I have a h not a full cycle but I like I
[21:24] have my own experience and I have my
[21:26] experience of me raising
[21:30] children and seeing them having
[21:33] discussion with me about you know Dad he
[21:36] like you know you're kind of strict on
[21:39] this or or and and at one point I had to
[21:41] realize that you know some of the thing
[21:43] as they grw up and they become adults
[21:45] they have to make their own decision
[21:47] what do you believe about
[21:50] that it's like Jesus asked his disciple
[21:52] who do you say that I am I can enforce
[21:55] the fact that I'm the Son of God but but
[21:58] Jesus wanted to know what do you believe
[22:02] and the first answer is well well those
[22:03] people are saying this those people are
[22:05] saying that Jesus that's not what I I'm
[22:06] not asking you what the church is saying
[22:09] I'm asking you what you
[22:14] believe so he wanted to see where they
[22:17] were at and so when my mom left at 16
[22:20] you would have asked me was I ready like
[22:23] I'm I'm good I'm good but I was not good
[22:25] I was not ready to face life on my own
[22:28] because I was not trained to take
[22:45] decision Paul is is talking in Romans 14
[22:49] that one man esteem it one day above
[22:51] another another esteemed every day alike
[22:54] let every man be fully persuaded in in
[22:58] his own
[23:01] mind Paul says he that regarded the day
[23:04] regarded unto the Lord he that regarded
[23:06] not the day to the Lord he that not
[23:09] regard it he that eat it eat it to the
[23:11] Lord so basically he's saying if you're
[23:13] a Christian and you do something that
[23:15] you are fully persuaded you're doing it
[23:18] for the Lord but you cannot ask somebody
[23:21] else to do the same thing because Paul
[23:23] is not saying here that we are
[23:25] everybody's going to be alike Paul is
[23:28] saying that you have to respect the one
[23:30] that has a higher standard for
[23:33] something and this other one doesn't
[23:35] consider this as as as to give it give
[23:38] it the same
[23:40] importance now let give me you a let me
[23:42] give you a modern example let's say you
[23:45] got you have a guy that was in the world
[23:47] and when he was in the world he was
[23:48] lifting weight he was Mr
[23:51] Universe right taking protein and powder
[23:54] and all pumped up and that was his that
[23:57] was his life he was doing competition he
[23:59] was you know he was you know big muscle
[24:01] you know he knows everything about
[24:03] lifting weights and all that and then
[24:05] God calls him and he gives his life to
[24:06] the Lord and God is saying to him put
[24:09] everything this is all
[24:11] rubbish put that all that aside and when
[24:15] he comes to the Lord he is so disgusted
[24:19] by the lifting weight
[24:21] universe that he that he runs away from
[24:24] that and and and this thing is of the
[24:26] devil and and really ruined my life and
[24:30] it brought you know such bad thing in my
[24:33] life so he becomes a Christian and for
[24:35] him you know lifting weight is something
[24:37] that you know the Lord delivered him
[24:39] from and he was putting that before God
[24:42] and and he's delivered he's so happy he
[24:44] goes to church and in his mind he's so
[24:46] sure that everyone has the same
[24:48] experience as him and then on a Sunday
[24:51] afternoon he's invited to the pastor's
[24:53] home for lunch and then he enter by the
[24:55] garage and he gets in the garage and
[24:57] then he sees some weight lifting
[25:01] equipment in the corner of the garage
[25:02] and he's
[25:05] like my goodness my pastor is going to
[25:11] hell and he doesn't understand how a man
[25:15] of God could lift weight it's
[25:20] impossible but that man of God is past
[25:22] 50 and his muscle are disappearing so
[25:24] he's just trying to keep up with age
[25:26] right that's right I I heard an amen
[25:32] there but this man is able to do his few
[25:35] pumps you know sweat a little bit take a
[25:37] shower and feel relaxed and move on to
[25:40] something else it's not a big deal for
[25:43] him but this man that came out from the
[25:46] world his conscience is so effective
[25:49] because in for him it was destructive so
[25:51] he will regard that thing as
[25:54] evil and you know what maybe God is
[25:57] shape his conscience to say you because
[26:00] of your past you'll have to stay away
[26:03] from that because the weightlifting for
[26:05] you is a door to the
[26:08] world but for this other man that
[26:11] lifting weight is not a door to
[26:14] hell you're with me when I was when I
[26:18] was in the world hcky for me became the
[26:20] main thing it it became a survival thing
[26:22] for me because you know when you raised
[26:24] a Christian sometime in school you are
[26:26] you are rejected and you're a kind of a
[26:27] nobody and because I was a good hockey
[26:29] player I I kind of used that to be
[26:32] accepted so when when when you do
[26:34] something and you're accepting you're
[26:36] love you are noticed oh Steve is good
[26:38] this this this it becomes over it
[26:40] becomes unbalanced because you all your
[26:43] self-esteem is pour into that you become
[26:46] this to be loved to be appreciated it's
[26:48] a it's it's it becomes a trap and I was
[26:51] so much in hockey hockey was so big for
[26:55] me when I gave my life to the Lord and
[26:57] God called me to the Ministry God called
[26:59] God asked me to put to put some of those
[27:02] things aside and not even return back to
[27:04] that because for me it triggers
[27:07] something even though I'm born
[27:10] again we're still in the
[27:13] flesh but I'm cannot turn around and
[27:16] preach
[27:17] that because first of all it's not in
[27:19] the word it's my personal experience
[27:23] with my background God can ask me
[27:26] something out of me that is not asking
[27:28] to
[27:29] you at one point you'll have to
[27:32] determine with the leading of the Holy
[27:35] Spirit what's good for you and what's
[27:38] not good for you because sometime it's
[27:39] not what you're doing it's what it leads
[27:42] you
[27:43] to and you have to use discernment as
[27:46] even Paul is teaching that not
[27:48] everything is
[27:49] bad but you don't want to become
[27:53] slave of those things
[28:13] now conscience
[28:16] equals
[28:19] conviction so let's go back to Romans 14
[28:22] some of the followers some of the Lord's
[28:24] followers think one day is more
[28:27] important than another other things all
[28:31] days are the same but each of you make
[28:35] up your own mind that's a that's a
[28:37] modern uh uh verion so you have to be
[28:40] fully
[28:42] persuaded because later on in the in the
[28:45] in the in the verse it says what you
[28:47] believe about this thing should be kept
[28:49] between you and
[28:53] God you are fortunate if your actions
[28:56] don't make you have doubts so you want
[28:58] to be sure that you are fully persuaded
[29:01] because the Bible says but if you have
[29:04] doubts about what you eat you are going
[29:07] against your belief so basically you're
[29:09] going against your conscience and you
[29:11] know that is wrong because anything you
[29:14] do against your belief is a
[29:17] sin so if you go against your conscience
[29:21] you are
[29:22] sinning but your conscience is not the
[29:25] word of God
[29:30] so it becomes a bit tricky right so we
[29:32] want to deal we want to go deeper into
[29:35] that topic to understand so if you go
[29:37] against your conviction you're
[29:39] committing a sin because you are
[29:41] trespassing the policeman that God has
[29:43] put inside of you but your conscience
[29:45] has been shaped by your parents if
[29:47] you've been a Christian it's been shaped
[29:49] by the word of God by the pastor by the
[29:51] church by other what are the people are
[29:52] saying about your family by your parents
[29:54] and it's all a kind of a sometime it's a
[29:56] Melting Pot of a lot of information and
[29:59] sometime it can become confusing it's
[30:01] like what do I believe and if you travel
[30:03] a little bit you go from Camp to Camp
[30:05] like we have people here and you maybe
[30:07] you come from another church and that
[30:08] other Church believe it this way but you
[30:10] visit that other church and they don't
[30:11] do it that
[30:14] way like we are Canadian sometime we
[30:16] have youth people they they they travel
[30:18] they go to the United States and the
[30:20] Americans you know they're this way this
[30:21] way Canadian or that way and sometime
[30:23] young people they come back and they're
[30:24] a bit confused well they do this over
[30:26] there but us we don't do that and and
[30:29] when you travel a little bit sometime
[30:31] you get confused because you like well
[30:32] this people doesn't like they believe
[30:34] the same message but they don't end up
[30:36] with the same
[30:38] box and it's a bit confusing like is it
[30:41] a different God no it's the same God but
[30:45] with different
[30:46] people with different background that's
[30:49] why the prophet is teaching that every
[30:51] church is
[30:52] Sovereign because it's not every pastor
[30:55] we who will apply the word the same way
[30:59] but we don't want to use that to Rebel
[31:01] but we want to go deeper to be mature to
[31:04] understand that this is something that
[31:06] that can vary and I'm not talking about
[31:08] the word can vary the word is firm it
[31:10] doesn't change but there's the humanity
[31:13] in between that sometime confuses us
[31:31] something your conscience will do is
[31:32] that your conscience will accuse
[31:36] you and that's a boring thing you're
[31:39] doing something you think you're all
[31:40] good and then
[31:42] you're you're sto in your
[31:45] track she's
[31:47] laughing yeah you're
[31:50] like I'm not supposed to do that who
[31:54] told you that your
[31:56] conscience right now it just accuse you
[31:58] like you were going at it and suddenly
[32:00] you realize Christian is not supposed to
[32:02] do that what am I doing am I a Christian
[32:05] yes no my parents is the pastor around
[32:08] you got people at the church around okay
[32:10] I'm good I'm
[32:11] good it's a battle right you're on the
[32:15] web you're clicking clicking suddenly
[32:17] you're like I think I'm going too far
[32:19] who's accusing you your conscience you
[32:22] have to deal with that it's a it's an
[32:24] ongoing conversation that never stops
[32:28] all right so we got an example in the
[32:30] Bible so when they brought
[32:34] a an adulterous
[32:37] woman and everybody want to Stone
[32:40] her everybody's good she's a sinner
[32:43] we're not we're going to kill her
[32:44] because she committed a sin and Jesus
[32:46] what he did he used our
[32:48] conscience and he says Whoever has no
[32:51] sin cast the first stone and the Bible
[32:55] Bible says from the youngest to the
[32:57] oldest you start to hearing dropping of
[32:58] stone talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
[33:02] because the Bible says when they heard G
[33:05] Jesus appealed he didn't name any sin he
[33:09] didn't say anything all he did is
[33:11] trigger their conscience and when he
[33:13] triggered their conscience they realize
[33:14] I'm holding a stone to Stone her but I'm
[33:16] full of sin
[33:18] myself and the Bible says they were
[33:20] convicted by their own conscience but my
[33:23] question is where was their conscience
[33:26] five minutes ago it was there but it was
[33:29] quiet but when it was triggered it came
[33:33] back and they stopped what they were
[33:35] doing so it means that we can trigger
[33:38] somebody's conscience to make him stop
[33:41] what he's doing by making that
[33:44] conscience accusing
[33:47] you so your conscience is talking to you
[33:52] Paul says in 2 Corinthians for our
[33:54] rejoicing is this the testimony of our
[33:57] conscience so your conscience is not
[33:59] just accusing you when it accusing you
[34:02] your conscience is basically testifying
[34:04] to you in a modern version it says we
[34:07] can be proud of our clear conscience we
[34:10] have always live honestly sincerely etc
[34:13] etc so the Bible is saying that your
[34:15] conscience can accuse you your
[34:17] conscience can can testify to you about
[34:23] yourself but based on older information
[34:27] cuz it's it's been shaped by something
[34:29] else and that's where we're heading
[34:31] slowly stay with me cuz we're going
[34:34] somewhere with
[34:37] that the prophet says you got a woman
[34:41] where she says it doesn't condemn me to
[34:43] wear short hair it doesn't condemn me to
[34:45] wear manicure or makeups or whatever it
[34:47] is it don't condemn me to go to dances
[34:49] it don't me condemn me to let to tell a
[34:52] little white lie it don't condemn me to
[34:54] play bridge in my bridge party you know
[34:56] why you ain't got nothing to
[35:00] condemn that don't hurt my conscience
[35:03] you got no more conscience than a snake
[35:06] has
[35:07] hips so you ain't got no conscience
[35:10] there ain't nothing there to hurt you
[35:12] you're of the world and so if you're in
[35:14] that position tonight well like I can do
[35:16] whatever I want it doesn't hurt me
[35:18] you're in trouble because you have
[35:21] blasted that mechanism that comes from
[35:24] God that God has created us with an
[35:27] internal
[35:28] policeman and if you have busted
[35:30] everything that well I don't feel
[35:32] condemned about nothing you're in
[35:36] trouble and if you're in that state
[35:38] tonight you want to pray to Lord Lord
[35:40] restore inside of me some boundaries B
[35:43] and you know who are the people who bust
[35:46] all the limits and all the boundaries
[35:48] it's people that been that is put in it
[35:50] way too small of a box so tight they
[35:53] they they had to Rebel to breed
[35:57] and that's a problem because after that
[35:59] once you've busted that little world you
[36:02] don't have anymore and that's what
[36:03] happened to me when my mom left my life
[36:06] I was living in a small box a dynamite
[36:09] but I ended up I had to go in jail to
[36:11] know the limit and I had to hit the
[36:14] limit not of my church but of my Society
[36:17] like you don't rub a store
[36:21] period that's why the Bible says that
[36:23] the policeman is a servant of God why
[36:25] because he'll stop you but we should
[36:27] have a policeman inside of
[36:30] us and maybe some of you are asking well
[36:33] you're not talking about the Holy Ghost
[36:34] the Holy Ghost is supposed to do that
[36:36] job yeah the Holy Ghost is supposed to
[36:39] do that job but the Holy Ghost will use
[36:40] your conscience because we don't have
[36:43] visions unless you have a dream one
[36:45] night and the angel appear to you and
[36:47] says what you're about to do is wrong
[36:48] God's going to use your conscience
[36:50] that's how he want to talk to you but
[36:52] the problem is our conscience can be
[36:54] shaped by many things so we want our
[36:57] ience to be
[36:59] reliable I hope we can have that mature
[37:02] conversation
[37:05] amen so we're going somewhere with
[37:10] that you had another person living on
[37:13] their great condemnation and it was an
[37:15] an adulterous woman we remembered a
[37:17] story
[37:19] she she went to see the
[37:22] prophet and she was under so much
[37:24] pressure because she was so condemned by
[37:28] her subconscious and she was not aware
[37:30] of that she says I feel the world's
[37:31] going to burst and when the prophet had
[37:34] a vision and he showed that you know she
[37:37] she did uh uh adultery and all that and
[37:40] she need to confess to the husband the
[37:43] prophet says well I that's all I can
[37:44] tell you a psychiatrist would have never
[37:47] pulled that out of you it means that
[37:48] when she did that she felt guilty guilty
[37:51] guilty until you know there's people
[37:53] they say well I'm tired to feel
[37:55] guilty right you've heard that before
[37:57] for I'm tired to feel
[37:59] guilty and when they do that what they
[38:02] want to do is they want to Dynamite the
[38:05] guilt feeling to be free from guilt but
[38:08] the the thing of it is you have to
[38:10] question why do you feel
[38:12] guilty are
[38:15] you you can be tired of feeling
[38:19] guilty but the the the answer is not
[38:22] always to get rid of the guilt
[38:24] feeling you got to question why am I
[38:26] fing
[38:28] guilty and then you some people can say
[38:31] well brother CA I don't believe I don't
[38:33] believe that we uh can feel guilty for
[38:36] no reason
[38:39] really I'll give you an
[38:42] example it depends in what kind of
[38:44] environment you've been raised
[38:46] in one day the disciples were with Jesus
[38:49] and we know the disciples been raised in
[38:51] in an abusive environment the Pharisees
[38:54] was rough on people putting weight on
[38:56] people that they were not not even
[38:57] pushing thems you know the story so one
[39:01] day they're walking with Jesus and now
[39:02] they're under a new spiritual leadership
[39:05] they're with
[39:06] Jesus and the disciple they forgot to
[39:09] take the
[39:11] bread so Jesus start preaching and so
[39:15] they forgot to take the bread and Jesus
[39:17] start talking he says Jus said unto them
[39:19] take heed and Beware of the living of
[39:22] the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[39:24] disciples they reasoned among themselves
[39:26] saying it is because we have not taken
[39:29] the bread because in Jesus sermon he's
[39:31] he's kind of hint about the bread right
[39:34] away in their heart they felt condemned
[39:36] it says well he's saying that because we
[39:38] didn't so they thought that Jesus was
[39:40] condemning them because they didn't they
[39:43] didn't bring the bread but it had
[39:46] nothing to do with that but they were so
[39:49] used to be blamed about on everything
[39:52] that when Jesus opened their mouth their
[39:54] conscience were triggered about
[39:57] something something and so Jesus says
[39:59] Jesus perceived and he said unto them oh
[40:02] ye a little of Fate why reason ye among
[40:04] yourself because he have brought no
[40:06] bread so they felt guilty thinking that
[40:10] Jesus was condemning them and it's a
[40:12] good thing Jesus perceived the thought
[40:14] he says I'm not even talking about that
[40:17] but they felt condemned why because they
[40:19] used to be under they be used to be
[40:21] condemned over
[40:24] everything that now they made a mistake
[40:27] and and as soon as they hear the word
[40:29] they make a link that God is condemning
[40:32] me while he was
[40:34] not so it's to show you that conscience
[40:38] that conscience of the disciple has been
[40:41] shaped by people who always wanted to
[40:43] trap you that's was the Pharisees that
[40:46] was that's what it was to live under the
[40:49] Pharisees so much
[40:52] then one day they saw a man which was
[40:55] blind from birth and right away in their
[40:58] mind cuz they are so shaped in guilt and
[41:01] guilt and guilt right away they saw a
[41:04] blind man and they asked the Lord master
[41:06] who did Sin the guy's blind man
[41:08] somebody's done something
[41:10] wrong right away their conscience went
[41:13] to that it has to be linked to bad
[41:15] behavior somebody has caused that who is
[41:18] Sin here come on get up get up
[41:21] confess Jesus answered no no no no
[41:24] nobody has sin nobody has done something
[41:28] wrong
[41:28] here it's neither him did that man
[41:32] didn't sin he's not blind because of
[41:33] that he's not blind because of his
[41:35] parents but he's blind because the works
[41:37] of God should be made manifest in him so
[41:39] actually it was a positive thing but
[41:42] when when when you have people who've
[41:44] been raised with such a heavy heavy
[41:46] burden where every every aspect of
[41:48] behavior is control and blame and blame
[41:50] and blame when something bad happened in
[41:52] your life because in this case the
[41:55] disciple there's there's there looking
[41:57] at somebody else life but what if
[42:00] something bad happened to you right away
[42:02] you'd say Lord what did I did
[42:04] wrong the question is is something
[42:08] that's happening to you now is it
[42:09] related to your behavior it's just a
[42:12] trial maybe it's just a trial the
[42:15] prophet says that a sunshine is not the
[42:18] sign of approval of God neither a Cloudy
[42:21] and a thunder is not a sign of
[42:23] disapproval that that God is not in in
[42:26] debt but when our conscience is all it's
[42:29] been so damaged under so heavy heavy
[42:33] hand or the contrary some maybe there's
[42:36] some here that that needs that needs a
[42:39] conscience to be
[42:41] restored we got both I don't know anyone
[42:43] here so there's bothside I've seen
[42:47] bothside there sometime I wish you know
[42:50] these young people I wish they would
[42:52] have some trigger inside like you're
[42:53] going too far who said that you should
[42:58] know you're going too
[43:00] far I'm wondering why nothing inside of
[43:03] you is being
[43:07] triggered and so that blind man ended up
[43:10] being healed and then he he appeared in
[43:12] front of the Pharisees and Pharisee
[43:15] asked him why are you not blind who
[43:16] healed you like who did that and he try
[43:19] to explain well it's this man and well
[43:20] the Pharisees is like Jesus he's a
[43:22] sinner so and then the the the the Blind
[43:24] Men tried to explain to them something
[43:26] great happened in his life now he was
[43:28] blind now he
[43:29] sees he's all excited he's trying to
[43:32] explain that to the Pharisees and when
[43:34] he tried to explain that at one point
[43:37] the Pharisees says you know they
[43:39] answered and said thou was all together
[43:41] born in sins and thou thou teach us and
[43:44] so they want to The Blind Men that's now
[43:46] see they want to to shut him up they
[43:48] want him to shut up and you know how
[43:50] they did it they did it by blaming him
[43:53] for being born in
[43:55] sin like the Pharisees were not born in
[43:58] sin but it's a blaming game to blame you
[44:02] trigger your conscience so I can
[44:03] dominate you for you to shut
[44:06] up so that's was the Pharisees that's
[44:09] the kind of game they were playing and
[44:11] when you're under that it damages you
[44:14] because you don't know what's right and
[44:16] what's
[44:19] wrong so the prophet says in the message
[44:22] the greatest battle ever fought that
[44:28] we have five
[44:29] senses of the Mind the
[44:32] spirit and those five sents you know you
[44:34] got reasoning you got conscience you got
[44:37] memory but the prophet says that Satan
[44:40] has access to all of those he has access
[44:43] to your imagination he has access to
[44:44] your reasoning to your conscience to
[44:46] your memory so he has access to your
[44:48] conscience everybody has access to your
[44:51] conscience if you if I if I meet you in
[44:54] town and you're doing something and I
[44:56] and I'm just coming at you and how dare
[44:58] you you should be ashamed of yourself it
[45:01] it it leaves a scar in your conscience
[45:03] next time you're doing this you're kind
[45:04] of nervous like I hope Steve's not
[45:06] around he told me I was going to hell if
[45:08] I was doing that I don't believe that
[45:10] but I'm nervous
[45:11] anyway why because I've damaged your
[45:16] conscience I remove the
[45:21] freedom so the prophet says that
[45:23] imagination conscience memory reason and
[45:26] affection s they're all right if they
[45:32] agree with the word now we're going to
[45:36] bring the word into the
[45:40] conversation but if your affection
[45:42] doesn't agree with the word get rid of
[45:43] it you'd blow a flu right quick so let
[45:47] me give you an example back home if you
[45:49] ride a motorcycle or a moped you need a
[45:51] helmet that's the law is it the same
[45:53] thing in New Zealand by law you need a
[45:56] helmet so it's a safe country if you go
[45:58] to the US many states you don't need a
[46:03] helmet you know some states even slogan
[46:06] is Live Free or Die well you're going to
[46:08] die for
[46:09] sure live free you know the US live free
[46:13] yeah no helmet so after I preached on
[46:16] the conference a brother went to came to
[46:18] me after service he said brother Steve I
[46:19] got to tell you a story he says I was
[46:21] riding a motorcycle years ago and he
[46:23] said you know in Quebec we need a helmet
[46:25] but he says when we cross in certain you
[46:27] United States the certain States we
[46:28] didn't have to wear one so we gladly
[46:31] removed it was like yeah we're free no
[46:33] helmet so he says I was driving with my
[46:35] spouse and then at one point that was
[46:38] before he was a Christian so he said he
[46:40] said you know what she said after a
[46:42] while my she said we need to stop I need
[46:44] I don't feel comfortable I I need to put
[46:46] it because she even though she was
[46:48] allowed to do
[46:49] it because she was an environment where
[46:52] she's not supposed to do it she was not
[46:55] comfortable and that's just a natural
[46:57] element but she was not comfortable
[46:59] wearing not wearing one because in your
[47:03] heart in your mind is was like I'm doing
[47:04] something
[47:05] wrong let me give you an example let's
[47:08] say that's you you've been raised in a
[47:10] in in a church I don't know Holiness
[47:12] movement something that that if you you
[47:14] go to church you need a how do you call
[47:15] that is it a scarf or they they they
[47:18] they think the veil is a
[47:21] scarf they think that they see 1
[47:23] Corinthians 11 they think it's and so
[47:25] you've been raised you go to church you
[47:27] wear this and and and then suddenly you
[47:29] come in the message and then you realize
[47:32] you know the word the word is open it's
[47:34] revealed and you realize my hair is my
[47:36] covering wow that's
[47:37] amazing but let me tell you if every day
[47:40] of your life you you went to church and
[47:41] wearing one the first meeting you go
[47:44] with the new revelation of the word
[47:46] you're kind of you go and sit in church
[47:48] you're like like something is missing I
[47:51] understand the word doesn't ask me to do
[47:52] that but I feel
[47:54] like right yeah exactly because now your
[47:58] conscience need to get adjusted with the
[48:00] word of God and before it was adjusted
[48:04] by a Dogma or something that was
[48:06] required of you that God was not asking
[48:08] you so it needs to get adjusted but not
[48:12] adjusted by a Dogma by Church rule but
[48:15] by the revelation of the word of
[48:17] God because this is how God want to
[48:19] build this church it's upon
[48:21] Revelation but we got a lot of young
[48:23] people that you're under your parents
[48:25] and you the Bible is asking you the
[48:27] Bible require of you to obey your
[48:30] parents well you say well my parents are
[48:32] demanding something I don't agree with
[48:34] you know what God will honor you more if
[48:37] you obey them while God is asking you
[48:40] obeying them in something that maybe in
[48:42] your heart says well maybe one day when
[48:44] I built my family I won't do that but
[48:47] for now God is asking me to obey my
[48:51] parents and God will bless you if you
[48:55] subject yourself to to your parents and
[48:58] pray for your parents but also pray for
[49:00] Lord to show you are they
[49:03] right is it is it something you're
[49:05] asking you or this is just my father who
[49:07] believes
[49:08] that but until you're home and until
[49:11] you're there under their headship you
[49:13] have to obey God will bless
[49:16] you God will bless you in obeying
[49:19] something that maybe your father's not
[49:20] right maybe you don't have to do that
[49:24] God will bless you more than because if
[49:26] if you go against that you know what you
[49:28] get you get a rebellious
[49:31] Spirit when you disobey you get a rebel
[49:34] your spirit and when you get a rebel
[49:36] your spirit you're in trouble because
[49:38] that spirit will eat you
[49:43] up so what we want is our conscience oh
[49:47] I didn't move the
[49:50] slide so what we want is our conscience
[49:53] to agree with the word
[49:57] because the Bible says that be not
[50:00] conformed to this world but be ye
[50:02] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[50:06] that ye may prove what is good and
[50:10] acceptable and perfect will of God so
[50:14] God wants to transform every one of us
[50:18] so that we can discern by the renewing
[50:20] of our mind and to be to prove what is
[50:23] good acceptable and perfect
[50:27] you with
[50:29] me so our conscious accuses us our
[50:33] conscious testify to
[50:39] us but the prophet says we have to clean
[50:42] our
[50:46] conscience just like the prophet says in
[50:49] greatest battle ever fought says just
[50:50] like an old boiler with the flu stooped
[50:52] up you put a fire and it'll blow your
[50:54] thing up that's what the matter with so
[50:56] many blow up Christian is because they
[50:58] don't clean the channels out they don't
[51:00] go down the inside you've got to clean
[51:03] it conscience memory thoughts laying
[51:07] aside everything and coming from the
[51:08] inside out with that unadultered word of
[51:11] God that is the truth so you got
[51:13] memories that are bad God can clean it
[51:16] you have a conscience that that's
[51:18] damaged by sin you got to repent God's
[51:20] going to clean your conscience but God
[51:22] wants to clean your conscience also if
[51:24] you've been under bondage
[51:28] and sometime it does it doesn't come
[51:29] from parents sometime it comes from
[51:31] friends on both
[51:34] side oh you guys are so strict your
[51:36] family is so strict man man you're not
[51:38] allowed to do anything man come on man
[51:39] come on loose up a little bit and and
[51:41] and you got friends who attack your
[51:43] conscience saying it's too
[51:45] tight uh
[51:48] oh oh you got friends that attack your
[51:51] conscience you're too loose I don't I
[51:54] don't understand why your family's
[51:55] allowed to do that man it's it's wrong
[51:57] in church they they don't want to and
[51:59] and then you get attack on both side and
[52:01] sometime it's
[52:02] confusing and say Lord what are you
[52:04] asking of
[52:06] me that church allows this that church
[52:09] doesn't allow that wh what what's your
[52:11] opinion you know one day the prophet and
[52:13] I'm not talking about obvious thing like
[52:15] lying stealing adultery I'm not talking
[52:17] about clear-cut thing I'm talking about
[52:19] gry Zone because theyve many Grays
[52:25] on I'll give you an example the prophet
[52:27] was con constantly criticized because he
[52:30] in his prayer line he used to pray for
[52:32] color people because he would he wanted
[52:34] to see a vision for each one of them so
[52:35] after a couple of them he get he was
[52:37] getting tired and he he had to stop they
[52:40] would pull him out of the platform
[52:42] because he was so exhausted and people
[52:44] were disappointed they drive many miles
[52:46] they want to be in the prayer line and
[52:48] after four or five maybe 10 I don't know
[52:50] he would quit and stop and the people
[52:52] complain he says Oral Roberts he prayed
[52:54] for 500 people and after three or five
[52:57] the people are disappointed and he had
[52:59] so much pressure he was like Lord what
[53:01] do you want me to
[53:03] do they say I should pray for 500 and I
[53:06] pray for just for a couple of them
[53:07] because I believe that if I have a
[53:08] vision for each one of them the faith
[53:10] was going to rise and everybody's going
[53:12] to be healed but people complain and he
[53:14] said he said to himself next time the
[53:16] angel appear I'm going to ask the
[53:17] question I'm going to ask the Lord what
[53:20] should I do pray for five or pray for
[53:23] 500 there's surely an answer here
[53:26] because some people are not happy what I
[53:29] do because now so is in his conscience
[53:32] he thought that 4 five was good but
[53:34] because because people attack him now
[53:36] he's not sure anymore about what to do
[53:39] so next time the angel appeared to him
[53:41] he asked a question and he he asked the
[53:43] angel he says this is what I have as a
[53:45] problem I pray for a couple of them and
[53:48] and and people criticize me because oral
[53:50] or Roberts pray for 500 what should I do
[53:53] and he's expecting to have a clear-cut
[53:55] decision of God like this is what you're
[53:57] going to you know what was the answer of
[53:59] the Angel do as you feel
[54:05] led I want to be
[54:08] told I want to be told because I don't
[54:11] want to be I don't want to be uhhh I
[54:14] don't want to be
[54:15] blamed I hate to be feel so the prophet
[54:18] wanted to be in a position where nobody
[54:20] would blame him and he would feel 100%
[54:23] comfortable with his own conscience
[54:24] regarding the people but the Angel
[54:26] didn't help him that
[54:28] day because you have to do as you feel
[54:35] led if you're under your parents you
[54:38] have to follow their leadership but it
[54:41] depends some family there's something
[54:43] you can have you sit in the living room
[54:44] and have a fellowship on a topic other
[54:46] family maybe discuss is a sign of
[54:48] rebellion so you have to be with your
[54:52] family some family are up into
[54:54] discussion you can sit with that and say
[54:56] that have a question you know I've on my
[54:59] heart I don't think it's wrong but you
[55:01] don't want me can you explain me do you
[55:02] see in the word and I'm not challenge
[55:04] you I'd like to understand one day I'll
[55:06] have to take decision for myself now I'm
[55:09] under you and I want to be under you I'm
[55:10] not rebelling I don't know if you can
[55:12] have that conversation I don't want to
[55:13] trigger some problem but at one point
[55:17] you don't want to go to what I went from
[55:21] 16 small box to nothing then you get
[55:25] married and you never took a decision in
[55:27] your
[55:28] life you know you have sometime young
[55:30] people they get married and they end up
[55:32] in the
[55:33] world and you know why that
[55:35] happened because that sudden
[55:37] Freedom they never realize that it's the
[55:41] church rules parents
[55:43] rules that kept them they had nothing
[55:48] inside first of all you need the Holy
[55:51] Ghost you need the Holy Ghost but I'm
[55:53] taking a different angle tonight on
[55:55] purpose
[55:57] I'm not trying to diminish the
[55:58] importance of the Holy Ghost it's it's
[55:59] preach a lot and I'm and I and I the
[56:01] problem is that myself Having the Holy
[56:04] Ghost for many years I've struggled with
[56:07] my
[56:08] conscience knowing that Lord I know that
[56:11] you're you have nothing against that but
[56:14] when I do it I feel like I'm nervous
[56:17] because of where I come from it's like
[56:19] that woman with a scarf like every time
[56:21] I go to church I'm nervous I feel like
[56:22] my parents are looking at me because
[56:24] they raised me in that Holiness Church
[56:26] church so sometime it is difficult to
[56:29] enjoy the
[56:30] freedom let me give you another example
[56:34] Peter was the one who received a
[56:36] revelation that he could eat
[56:38] everything right he had a revelation God
[56:40] showed him you know that that uh came
[56:43] down from heaven Turtle all kinds of
[56:45] stuff then God says kill and eat like oh
[56:47] no Lord never never and God had to teach
[56:49] him the New Freedom the new revelation
[56:52] and so finally Peter enter into that
[56:56] that New Liberty and he's eating with
[56:58] with pagans sitting at the table with
[56:59] Gentiles having Great Fellowship but
[57:01] then there's people from that other
[57:03] church that still believe that is wrong
[57:04] they come in and then Peter is cut in
[57:06] between the conscience of those people
[57:08] those people and he ran and hide and
[57:10] even Paul call him a
[57:12] hypocrite why because he got caught
[57:14] between two different conscience and he
[57:16] didn't know where to
[57:18] stand Peter had the Holy
[57:20] Ghost but he
[57:23] struggled with the old view that that
[57:25] was the ended years ago and a new
[57:29] acquired Freedom by the opening of the
[57:33] word that's why I'm taking purposely
[57:35] that angle tonight I'm not talking about
[57:37] the baptism Holy G that's a granted you
[57:39] it's been preached I know you've heard
[57:41] that I'm I'm the conversation we're
[57:44] having tonight is to young people who
[57:45] have the Holy Ghost but still wonder
[57:48] Lord why am I so
[57:50] nervous why I do always feel guilty are
[57:53] you condemning me or it's the whole
[57:55] system system running after
[57:59] me and it's not not easy to get free
[58:03] from
[58:04] that I'm
[58:11] closing got to find a way to do it
[58:17] quickly so your
[58:20] conscience I'll finish with that got to
[58:23] skip a
[58:25] lot Romans 2 says that for when the
[58:29] Gentiles Gentiles which have not the law
[58:32] do by Nature the things contain in the
[58:35] law these having not the law are a law
[58:37] unto themselves which show the work of
[58:41] the law written in their hearts their
[58:44] conscience also bearing witness and
[58:48] their thought the meanwhile accusing or
[58:50] else excusing one another so what is
[58:53] saying here is that when the the word of
[58:55] God is written the law of God has
[58:57] written in our hearts our conscience
[59:00] should be adjusted with what in our
[59:02] heart and not with what people are
[59:06] saying so the purpose at the end of the
[59:09] day we all said that to say that our
[59:12] prayers is that Lord I want my
[59:14] conscience to be adjusted with your
[59:20] word but sometime we want God to tell us
[59:23] everything in details like the prophet
[59:25] was sincere to I pray for five or 500
[59:27] and he's waiting for a number he won't
[59:30] get that number because you have to walk
[59:33] by faith and take the decision to the
[59:37] best of your ability out of sincere of
[59:40] your
[59:43] heart in Romans 9 it says I say the
[59:46] truth I lie not my conscience also
[59:49] bearing me withness in the Holy Ghost
[59:56] and so we want our conscience to testify
[1:00:01] to us the word of
[1:00:04] God not the rule of our friend or this
[1:00:07] group or this idea if you under your
[1:00:10] parents it comes to your prin and God
[1:00:12] will bless you for that but as you're
[1:00:14] moving slowly to take your own
[1:00:17] decision you want this is the direction
[1:00:19] you want to takes Lord I want my own
[1:00:22] identity with
[1:00:24] you we have brothers here you're going
[1:00:26] to start a family your wife your
[1:00:28] children's going to look to you says
[1:00:30] what do you believe well let me call my
[1:00:33] dad right at one point you won't call
[1:00:36] your dad
[1:00:37] anymore god dad can be around and good
[1:00:40] advice and it's good to keep a
[1:00:42] connection all that experience but at
[1:00:45] one point you'll have to know for
[1:00:47] yourself let's
[1:00:52] barhead Lord Jesus we want to thank you
[1:00:56] for the clarity of your word and I pray
[1:00:58] Lord tonight something has been said to
[1:01:00] help the young
[1:01:02] people because sometime we have that
[1:01:04] internal conversation within oursel and
[1:01:07] we're confused Lord is it you talking to
[1:01:09] me or is it me to me where this come
[1:01:14] from and we want we don't want to
[1:01:16] Dynamite to burst to blast all those
[1:01:19] limits that's not the purpose but Lord
[1:01:21] we want to live in your freedom
[1:01:27] and we want to we we don't want to be in
[1:01:30] bondage of peer pressure peer pressure
[1:01:32] to loose up or PR peer pressure to fall
[1:01:35] under the law Lord help us to keep a
[1:01:38] balance and to know what do I
[1:01:42] believe I don't want any young people
[1:01:45] who go through this sudden Freedom that
[1:01:47] I went through that I couldn't handle
[1:01:49] and that brought me straight in the
[1:01:50] world because I was not ready I was not
[1:01:54] prepared I was not TR
[1:01:57] trained my prayer is this we'd have
[1:02:00] young people getting married and and and
[1:02:02] to build a solid a strong family rooted
[1:02:05] in your
[1:02:07] word this is why this is my prayer for
[1:02:09] every young people here
[1:02:11] Lord I pray in Jesus
[1:02:14] name amen amen
