Camp father those that have helped him the different teams and different ones Lord who have put together labor and effort Lord and and father what a momentous thing this is Lord F Lord even just the burden that he had and the vision that he has Lord to have this place and to set aside this time no doubt preparation has went in no doubt these young people have prepared themselves to be here and counted down the days and so here we are Lord father and I just want to say I don't want to miss what you have for me I don't want to miss Lord what your spirit is trying to say God may you we all Lord as we raise our hands and surrender may we just yield our vessel and say Lord uh make myself available to you I make my my vessel Lord available for your word to come and find a resting place Lord let it not be old vessels Lord God uh Lord old skins but let it be new fresh skin Lord that can move with the flow of the Holy Spirit father may we receive that stimulation of Revelation Lord father that the world doesn't have but we have it here tonight we're thankful bless every heart Lord we pray we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you love him this this evening amen God bless you if you have your Bible and they could just you could turn me down just a little bit Brother Joseph little bit hot up here on the monitor but that's all right Isaiah chap 52 if you have your your Bible amen we'll just turn uh to Isaiah chapter 52 amen do you love the Lord Jesus amen how many came with an expectation upon your heart amen and and I just believe the Lord will meet that need we just want to say again God bless you and uh certainly just an honor to be here with you and I trust that um you came with a real desire to see the Lord and uh and a hunger and thirst for righteousness I believe the Bible says that they that hunger for it shall be filled and so God is the god of filling amen emptying out is what we have to do but filling is his job amen and so as long as we can empty God can fill amen the uh the the fullness of the Living God Waits on an empty vessel so how many just want to say Lord I empty out everything so that you can fill me amen Isaiah chapter 52 and I just want want to um go straight here to the word still just a little bit uh boomy up here just a little bit you could turn that down Isaiah chapter 52 I want to just um uh read from Isaiah chapter 52 and then we'll have you be seated and I have a few of the things that I want to read but first we'll to start here the Lord just um moved on my heart as I was just waiting on him this afternoon and had prepared a a way that we would go um and and wasn't really uh planning to go the direction I'm going here tonight but the Holy Spirit just stopped me and I'm going to uh just obey him are you glad say brother Matt obey obey the Lord you know God can just stop you in your track sometimes and and take you a totally different direction and so that's all right we just we surrender to him amen he knows what's best his way is always the right way Amen brother bradam said our way is always the wrong way and so we just want to take his way Isaiah chapter 52 I'm just going to give this a very simple title here and I'm going to title this the choices that we make the choices that we make Isaiah chapter 52 and we'll just begin reading here at verse one awake awake put on thy strength oh Zion put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy City for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean notice these powerful words here I believe that scripture sometimes can just be so gripping if we just read it in the way that God spoke it through this prophet and he says here Shake yourself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem notice the colon there because this is always conditionalizing something this is God's way of making a promise or making a option you could say to that to the uh the person that he was speaking to he says here uh let's read it again Shake thyself from the dust and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck how many know that sometimes there's things that God has to free us from other times God gives you the key and he needs you to Free Yourself you see there's some things some banss that we put on ourself that God didn't or nor the devil put upon us and so God says here this is typing the daughter notice who he's speaking of here this is the daughter of Jerusalem it's not a heathen this is actually God's family he says Shake Yourself and from the dust and arise and sit down old Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus saith the Lord you have sold yourself for not for nothing and you shall be redeemed without money for thus saith the Lord my God my people went down a four time into Egypt to sojourn there and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause Lord we just bow our heads here tonight in great need of you once again Lord needing father a Special Touch from you Lord for we've have a a task that is before us Lord that without you would be impossible Lord for it's possible for me to say things Lord that maybe would sound good to some and intellectually we could agree with it and we can make points Lord that would maybe make us laugh or make us cry Lord but what good does that do us if it only stays in that emotional realm Lord I could say things tonight father in the words that I speak Maybe by this time next year or maybe just a few months from now people would struggle to even remember my title let alone the substance of what I said Lord for that's the weakness and the shallowness of men's words but oh Lord if you would speak and if your voice could be heard and the souls and The Echoes of of your word could echo down through the souls of men and women young adults Lord God then I believe that it could have such an effect it could change us eternally Lord I pray God that you would come now and take your Divine wisdom divine inspiration Divine leadership Lord I make myself now subservient to you Lord to your spirit father I just lay aside my thoughts and my ideas Lord and I'm just a vessel waiting to be used by you I pray Lord that every heart Lord that's here God every mother who sent their children and father who sent their children and or who no no doubt are praying with an expectation and a prayer Lord for that young person father may all Heaven move upon the prayers of that Faith Lord I pray that you would come and shield us Lord from the thoughts of the enemy Shield us Lord and take us up into that strong tower where we can run into and are safe Lord and may every heart father be pricked by the word that is spoken tonight father I pray that you would have your way in all things we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated I want you you just to keep your place just for a moment in Isaiah chapter 52 and then I'll have you also turn to the Book of Judges I'm ministering to you tonight on choices that we make you know life is such an amazing thing and you get this from the perspective uh different perspectives of life this just Dawns on you in such a different way than it did when I was maybe some of your age and at at my age now I could even say that the perspective that my father has is even a greater uh in a greater way than what I'm about to say but life has a way to teach you that it's very fleeting and it's very short and it's actually life that you think will just go on and and and go on and go on and there'll just be more years to your life you really get a sense for the the the shortness and the the fry that you have here in in this part of your existence and actually it's through a lot of things that happen maybe not always good but sometimes through sorrow and through trouble you realize that life is really just a life of struggle and it's a life of of endless Doom without the Lord Jesus and all pleasure that you could have and joy that you can have without the Lord and apart from the Lord is so shallow it's such a just a shallow veneer of of happiness and and and joy I believe that real contentment and real true happiness only comes to a Christian and you know I believe that it's amazing because life we understand it and the Bible even teaches us that that it's this way that it's a journey you notice in your Bible it starts with a journey a man named Abram who leaves the land of everything that he ever knew and everything that he had ever learned and everything that he thought was normal his mother his father his belongings his life everything he had worked for and yet God told him I want you to get up from this land Abram and I want you to sojourn means to start a journey I'm not going to tell you where you're going specifically but I just need you to start moving and Abram goes with this Faith because it's complete faith is the only way you'll ever be able to walk this Christian walk it's not by a walk that you understand everything all the time if we'd be honest with oursel even as Christians serving the lord for many years we'd be honest enough to say that there's many times we don't have a clue what God is doing in our life and many times we could look at things and and look back at certain things and we're trying to figure out why did God do it this way and and and and you know many times for a real believer it doesn't always make sense not not everything that happens to even Servants of God makes sense all the time brother brandham would even say prophets don't know everything God only tells prophets what they need to know think of how many years that Jacob had to live in agony and anxiety and sorrow waking up in the middle of the night not knowing what happened to his dream Joseph and he didn't know what what what condition he was in whether he was dead whether he was alive but brother bam said God kept that from him and didn't show it to him and so every servant of God every man of God woman of God that has served the Lord for any length of time would be honest enough to tell you that you don't always have it figured out and even years later sometimes you look back in your life and go I still don't know why this happened in the way that it did but here's what I know all things work together for the good of them who love the Lord who are called according unto his purpose you see trusting God is not something that always makes human sense many times trust in God is is just trust in a promise whether the outcome is it comes out the way that you thought it should or not and so life we understand is a life of choices it's a life of many different decisions Abram's Journey starts and he says leave everything I want you to leave your father I want you to leave your your your your home I want you to leave everything you work where am I going Lord just get up Abram and go and I'll I I'll show you you know for Sons and Daughters of God many times God is looking for you to be be faithful and what he has told you before he'll tell you what's next and so many times we want to know what's next Lord and God saying are you Faithful in what I've already told you because if you're not faithful in what I've already revealed to you I'm not going to show you what's what the next step and the right next decision is to make until you prove yourself that you can have enough confidence that I know what I'm doing and you don't and I've got all things in control and that's all that you need to know Abram leave everything you know that was a very hard thing for him but he had to make a decision he could have told the Lord know God I've got it really good down here doesn't mean I want to walk away from you but I really Lord I I'd just rather stay right here I'm just content but there was something in his heart to where he he knew that he must obey the voice of the Lord in his life and so he comes to that Crossroad in his life that hard decision that time you know when it's not just going with the flow sometimes in your life it feels just like cruise control and your just life is just unfolding sort of coming at you and you're just you're just dealing with it as it comes then there come certain spots in your life that we could call Junctions you know the prophet of God said that's the critical part it's not what you it's not what takes place you know just necessarily on a day-to-day basis but there's certain times God brings you to certain Junctions or Crossroads and he's watching what decision will you make what decision will you go left will you go right will you go forward will you go backwards Abraham I want you to do something even even even harder than that your father's going to die and it's going to be a very sorrowful thing for you Abra and no doubt Abram spent you know time there to sorrow over his father and sorrow and sorrow and grief but there came a time when God comes to Abram again and says get up get up Abram you've sorrowed long enough now you've got to move you can't stay here in this state anymore because you'll never get to the place that I've ordained for you staying in sorrow and distress you've got to make a decision but God I don't understand it doesn't make sense but Abram you got to move on you've got to pass the test ABR you've got to keep going and there's so many things that come in our life that want to get us to stop and sit down like this captive daughter eventually got to the place to where she wasn't just sitting down she was laying down in the dirt with a chain about her neck and she's graveling there in the dust and and and and and and such a terrible condition the Bible paints for us that she was in the the Philistines are mocking her Isaiah says and they're mocking her and here's the voice of God the voice of her father and he speaking saying get up daughter get up arise put on your strength put on your beautiful garments Abram came to another place in his life after he passed that test and yet he comes to another Junction in his life when he's going to have to cast out the Bond woman and this may you can make it become very disconnected from the story but this was a very hard decision on AB when he took a woman who he loved a baby that was his own and God made such a gave him such clear instructions that he must cast her out of his of her home now God wasn't going to just leave her we know that from the story of the scripture God had provision for Hagar and for ishmail but but God needed Abram to put her and his child in his hands it was a very difficult thing you could imagine re it would just rip the heart out of this man but he must be obedient he had a choice to make his journey wasn't completed and until he made that choice God was not going to show him the next instructions for his life he comes even further than that as I'm sure you know where I'm going with this and it would come to an even harder harder decision a harder Crossroad a harder choice and God says Abram you've passed the test of leaving ER you've passed the test of leaving your father you passed the test with Hagar but I'm not done with you Abram there's another test you've got to pass this is the big one Abram this is the large one Abram this this is this is the test that that that I promise I give you my word I love it when God swears and gives his promise because you can count on it when God puts his word behind it the Bible says it this way that it's impossible for God you say there's something impossible for God yes it is impossible for him to tell a lie and he says I promised you Abraham you were faithful and that was a good thing when you left her you were faithful and that was a good thing when you left your father but but but now it's all Christendom at this one moment I want you to take your son your only son read it the way Genesis says it this is the way it says it take your son your only son whom thou lovest it's amazing because some of the sometimes the things that God asks us seem impossible you can imagine for this father this Blood of his blood flesh of his flesh here was the promise here's Abraham standing and here was the promise all of his all all of his Joy everything he had waited for everything that he thought he had endured for and now God needs him to sacrifice his son his only son whom thou lovest Abraham would do you love me this much you know it's a hard Choice it's very much a hard choice and that's the way that life is life is an array of choices you'll learn that as you go through life and you get o older and years and you leave the home of the tutelage of your family and brother bramman influence said you start as a baby and you're under the influence of your mother and he says the first love that a baby feels the first time that he feels the love of God Is the Love through a mother and he's under that dispensation of that love of a mother but he can't stay there it's got to go and pass on to in the dispensation of the love of the father and the Father's Love is very different than the mother's love but just as important to the growth and the nurture and the furthering of that child's life and then the brother bandam says after that voice of influence of that father you're turned over into the influence of maybe teachers Sunday school teachers and then you're under the tutelage of those and you've got to progress and then you move from that influence and you go into the influence of your workplace and in your job and you're under the influence of maybe school and college and different things and many different influences and brother Adam then stops and says but who's influencing you now what voice of influence are you are you following now and so we know that this was the way that life is made up it's a it's an array of choices some of them are very small some of them are very large some of them seem insignificant and some sometimes it's the decisions that we think are so significant we look back and realize those were't really the significant ones at all you know I I think of another man here and I'm just going to parallel the life of two men here just for a moment I want to parallel the life of this man Samson because also like Abram Abraham Samson's life was a life full of choices some of them really good some of them not so good his life starts out in Judges chapter 13 could you turn in your Bible with me if you could just for a moment I just want you to turn there and read it with me it'd be good if you could read it yourself I believe that that we should any time we can should read it right from right from our Bible you love the Lord notice here because this is going to be a prop uh a prophecy or or an angel that appears to to this woman and manoah and and his wife and the Bible says in verse two there was a certain man of Zora the family of the danites whose name was monoa and his wife was Barren and bore not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said to her behold Thou Art Barren and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazar right unto God notice this from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and here this woman repeats it to her husband and he says in verse she says in verse 7 he said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing notice the promise that the angel gives this mother for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death so you see the promise of God that he places over a life doesn't end with the bad decisions Hallelujah you see Samson is going to go a lot of places God never told him to go but yet the promise the anointing the purpose that God had for him will be from the very first breath to the very last breath he breathes he says he shall be a Nazareth unto God from the days born verse 7 until the day of his death and so here we know that God gives him this promise and I'm just going to not take the time to read the rest of it but you see that it's these it's Samson's life that this promise was giving out through it and every choice that we make even us here just for a moment we have choices that we make some large some small and every decision we make some large some small will have some determinant Factor upon where we ultimately end up in life ultimately every choice young people has a consequence yes sir I want to I want to just take a moment to emphasize that to you because there's no choice too insignificant that doesn't bear some consequence to your life whether it's the choices of the friends that you have and you have that choice no one forces you to be friends with anybody can we just preach here just for a moment you see there's different people that that that Satan will anoint in your life and they can be called friends but actually they're not friends they're vo they're they're not speaking of the individual but Satan will use something in their life to to harm you or afflict you or bind you or keep you from what God has and so often times we need to recognize the tactic of the devil as brother Bram said overcoming is recognizing the devil and his tactics and sometimes we over complicate that when it's actually so simple and sometimes it's the music that we listen to We have that choice it's the atmospheres it's the places that we subject our spirits to and so every decision that we make ultimately has some type of consequence what we watch what we allow to enter into the gates of our spirit of our human Spirit the place where we go to church the place where we choose to be employed the words that come out of our mouth the thoughts and the things that we feed upon on our smartphones these are all choices that ultimately develop character in our life you see because choices leads to habits always choices lead to habits good choices lead to good habits that's right and bad choices lead to really bad habits and so so we we allow these things brother brandom says it this way and I love this quote in the marriage of the Lamb he says God could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through it but you've got to make the decision for yourself so in the larger picture just for a moment as we close this Loop here with choices in the larger Grand picture of one's life the Journey of life that we call it where you end up in 10 years is only the result of the daily choices that you make and you're making today that's true you see it's it's our life in the grand picture we see a choice after choice and eventually after you review those choices what you'll find is a pattern and a pattern of choices will give you a trajectory of one's life and you can watch the trajectory of one's life that is constantly going up not that they don't make mistakes and fall sometimes but the overall trajectory is as ever ascending and you get some on the other end of the spectrum to where they're here today and maybe it doesn't look so consequential but you look over the past pattern of their life of the last little bit and you don't see a trajectory that's ever ascending you see a trajectory that is descending friends I'll just be honest it's that simple I think sometimes it's as simple as us inventorying our own lives and saying Lord am I closer to you today than I was last year at this Youth Camp am I closer to you today than I was last month it will reveal are the choices I'm making ultimately sending me on a trajectory upwards or are they sending me on a trajectory downwards can you say Amen to the word you could look at your life now and understand that you have arrived where you're at in life because of choices very natural ones and Samson's life was to me when I read this book it's such a tragedy such lost potential such a a a life of what could have been God anoints him in such a powerful way and anoints him from his very birth says he's going to be a Nazarite unto God from the day he's born until the day he dies and the Bible says his life begins with an anointing you know Samson wasn't filled with the spirit of God as you are but yet his yet in his outward Temple it was only the Holy Ghost the enabling of the holy spirit that allowed Samson to be what he was brother Brandon makes that clear and he talks about men like Samson and he says what was that that was the ruach which is the Breath of God it's the same thing the Holy Ghost is the only difference is is that the breath or the ruach of God doesn't in our lives to the Born Again doesn't just anoint our flesh but it actually dwells in our soul but Samson lived by this Breath of Life and God had sent this great anointing upon his life and and from the very moment that he's born there's a very special calling there's a very special plan there's a special blueprint and and God says to his mother he's going to begin to deliver he's going to be a savior he's going to be a deliverer this is the word of a judge it means a savior it means he'll begin to save the people not from their sins as Jesus did but save them from their oppressors God had such a beautiful plan for Samson's life he had such a beautiful objective and long before he was ever born he already Drew up the blueprints he already Drew up the engineered set he already knew everything that he would ever face and he already made provision he' already he' already uh he had already brother random said it this way he had already given him the equipment he was borned with the equipment built down inside of him and he comes to his life under this anointing and the Bible says he shall begin to deliver the Israel the Israel out of the hand of the Philistines so we know that that they're under oppression they're they're backsliding and God comes to this Barren mother and gives him a promise and says you're going to he's going to begin to deliver such a powerful thing he's going to be a savior you know I just want to stop here just for a moment I just feel the Holy Spirit stopping me right here you know God God could use you just your own no matter how sign significant you think that your life is a life that is surrendered to God doesn't have to have some great gift of preaching doesn't have to have some great G gift of teaching doesn't have to have even a great gift of of singing or some kind of outward talent but any life that'll surrender them their vessel to the Holy Spirit God can use you to bring Salvation and Redemption to those that are around you a life that is surrendered to the holy spirit it's a tool in the toolbox of God it's a weapon in the hand of God and it will tear down the devil's Kingdom I I I I just believe that with all my heart it doesn't matter who you are the prophet of God says it this way God has always had one problem getting a vessel a person who he could get under his complete control under his complete submission oh I wonder if there's anybody here tonight that feels like I feel and would just say Lord I want you to have complete control of my life life whatever you got to do God whatever you've got to to shave down out of my life I want to be a vessel that you can use I want to be an instrument Lord God that you can use in my life I I just want to say and I I would invite you to say it this way if you could use anything Lord you can use me if you could use anything Lord you can use me in my life oh that he could get somebody under his complete control a life that is so yielded to the Holy Spirit uh not just your soul but your every action your every thought the words that you speak the thoughts that you entertain let it be to the glory and the honor of God and it will be a life that's under the control of the Holy Spirit oh Samson's life was meant to be a savior it was meant to be a deliverer it was something he was born with he was an anointed consecrated vessel can I just stop here and say for a moment that God has anointed a purpose for every life under the sound of my breath under the sound of my voice every life has an anointing which means a purpose I'm not talking about some filling and some Goosebump that's wonderful but many times we mistake what the anointing is brother Ram said the anointing is not an emotion it's not a feeling that you feel I feel an anointing and I love it when I feel it on my flesh I love it when I feel Goosebumps I be honest I think people that don't want to feel God have never felt him cuz if you ever feel him you'd say give me some more of of what I felt if you ever feel the Holy Spirit move on your outward body it's one of the greatest Sensations you could ever have but can I just say that is not the anointing the anointing brother brandham says is power it's it's it's it's it's it's Supreme control uh power under control it's a v so under control of the Holy Spirit true anointing from God comes with the purpose even the word anointing is cha in the in the Hebrew it means to smear or to rub with oil this is what they would do when they would anoint a king it's what they would do when they would anoint a prophet you can remember David's PR uh when he's anointed by Samuel and and and later in the Psalms and David is is talking about the anointing oil and he says oh how good it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the oil that flowed from Aaron's head to his beard down to his paps all the way down to his to his to to the floor what was it it was a purpose it wasn't just the oil it wasn't just about getting oily yeah in other words it wasn't just the sensation but actually the anointing was that God had a purpose for this life he had a mission for this life he had a job an instruction specific to this person's life and let me just stop here and say you can never fulfill another person's anointing don't you ever try to be anybody that you're not don't you ever try to be somebody if God didn't make you that way you'll be if you try to be that way maybe you're not a person who screams and shouts that's all right maybe you're not a person who dances and runs up up and down the church that's all right if that's who God made you to be then you better not resist God when he comes comes upon you but I just want to say this be who you are yes sir because God has only anointed you for the mission that he's given you and you could only defeat the Devil by surrendering yourself to that anointing David has given Saul's armor and says David had one thing to say it wasn't that anything was wrong with Saul's armor but David said I've not proven these things in other words you be you Saul I've got to be me I've got to be who God Made Me and so God anointed that life he anointed the life of of of Samson he says there's going to be a deliverer what is that anointing it comes with a purpose so God would literally have a burden and God in order to express that burden he would take a prophet and he would so anoint and baptize that man with his burden to where the voice of that Prophet becomes the voice of God that's what brother bandam said and he says that voice of that Prophet would carry wasn't that man's voice was it the human voice it wasn't just the human voice it wasn't about that people want to deify the voice of brother brandham had nothing to do with his human vocal cord had nothing to do with his Kentucky accent though I love it but behind that human voice was an anointed voice from the throne and when you heard the voice of Jeremiah it was no longer the thoughts of Jeremiah it was the thoughts from the throne room of God and let me just say when you rejected Ezekiel you were not rejecting Ezekiel you were not turning away from Ezekiel you were turning away from god Jehovah who had anointed the words of Ezekiel amen amen somebody it was more than the voice of a man when that man when that Prophet spoke it was the very heart the very burden of God passed down through a human vessel and then he would begin to express that burden even men like Pro like Isaiah men like Jeremiah had to live out things in their life that no one else would have to live even God tells his Prophet don't get married never allows him to because God wanted Israel wanted that man to know what it would feel like because this is the way God felt and so he would actually tell that man that he would actually take that prophet and put him through certain things in his life that maybe no one else would have to ever experience in their life but God needed that man to come under the weight or the burden this is what an anointing is is when you come under the purpose of God for your life and that purpose of God is transferred from God to Your Vessel it's amazing because God anoints his life in such a way and he's going to be a consecrated ated vessel it's a life with a purpose it's a life with a anointing of God an unction from the spirit of God so long as he surrenders to that plan that God had before the foundation of the world you see long before Samson was ever born God already was the architect of everything he would go through in his life he had it all drawn up long before he ever faced it listen friends do you understand young people that most of the time where anxiety comes from you want to know where depression comes from where fear comes from we talked about it this morning anxiety and fear comes from the unknown when you don't know something when you got questions about what's happening in your life it always has the onset of fear and anxiety and worry because you don't know what's going to take place but did you know something long before it ever took place God already seen it hello somebody amen I'm talking about Sons and Daughters of God who are LED by the spirit of God long before that problem ever came God already signed off on that trial give it gave it his stamp of approval and gave the devil permission to attack you or afflict you but I got I got good news for you tonight that if my heavenly father signed off on it then my heavenly father's got to back up everything that happens in my life listen young people you can't go through anything in your life that your heavenly father didn't already know that what you would would go through made a way of Escape out of it and all of it will be for the glory of God there is nothing the Sons and Daughters of God go through outside of something that will bring glory to the name of your father long before it ever took place God already anointed the life isn't it so amazing that nothing ever catches God by surprise amen nothing ever catches him by surprise God never is biting his fingernails he's never worried and anxious and what's going to happen What will what will take place God's never up in heaven when you make a bad God goes oh man what are we going to do we got to come up with Plan B no no there's no plan B with God maybe plan C Plan B didn't work I'll go to plan C there is no plan C you see from the beginning from the Cradle to the Grave God has already written out your drama your story and every F the family you were born in the home you were raised in the kind of father that you had you say well brother Matt you don't know my life I don't but God does and long before you ever came into this world God raised you up for a certain purpose a certain Mission I'm preaching to somebody here tonight because the Lord had me is is stopping me it won't let me go any further from this right here God had had you go through that what you went through because there was a mission in your life and God needs you to get to stop questioning what's taking place and stop get you know blaming this and blaming that and just say Lord all things be to the glory of God my life is in your hands as David said my times are in your hands my seasons are in your hands from the beginning to the end you know what you're doing God and if you're not worried why should I be worried it's amazing what brings on fear is the fear of the unknown it's just like people you know it's it's so incredible because I told this story and it's very hilarious to me uh and maybe you can relate here I know any good old American could relate to this but you know it's so amazing because you ever you ever you ever seen somebody that that is is is uh has their favorite team and they really want that team to win you know that that that tournament what do you all have here rugby it's not not American football or you know maybe you call football something we call soccer that's all right who's right who's wrong I don't know you drive on the right we drive on the left but I you know I'll leave it there won't say anymore you do drive on the right so that must be right so but you know it's amazing because you ever watch somebody who who loves their favorite team you know how much stress and how much pressure they get under when that team is in the greatest moment and here's the here's everything the whole season's led up to this moment and and everything that they've spent all their money and all their life on and man they've invested everything it's so amazing how much people invest in something emotionally that they have zero control over what happens yet they will shout at the TV in the living room they will scream they will they will they will clap their hands and yet all the clapping and all the shouting and all the hurah and throwing the remote down on the it doesn't have any effect or any bearing on the game yeah I I hate to bust your bubble but just cuz you clapped your hands doesn't mean that they're going to throw a winning touchdown pass now that doesn't have any bearing no matter what you do it's amazing to me because here we are in church actually you're clapping and you're a Manning and you're shouting actually could have a bearing on the service yet we shout at ball games and we have no control over what happens and here we are in the presence of God and there's angels and there's demons and there's doubts and there's fear and we have an option to have an effect on the service of God but it's amazing because people get so invested in that and they're so fearful they become so nervous o over what happens if they lose and and you're so incredible because we were at a I was preaching somewhere and I was with my wife and I went to go get takeout at a restaurant that that night and I'd went into the restaurant and I'd watched and when I walked in I'm expecting a very loud busy place and man when I walk in I thought something is wrong because the place was just dead silent but there's people but it's dead silent and so I sort of you know walk in and I'm walking up to the spot where you see takeouts and then I notice and the whole restaurant I'm talking 200 people are Frozen not eating not drinking have their heads turn to the TV screen and it's this great moment of of of Tennessee and they're going to kick they they they they had never won or beat this team and I think ever and they were going to they were they were going to win it was like 3 seconds left in the game and they all they had to do is Kick this little Chip Shot field goal and and it would be over and you could just man you know you can feel the atmosphere sometimes you ever walked in somewhere and you realize man I walked in at the wrong moment and you could cut it with a knife you could feel it like you just want to turn around and go the other way you know you could feel that it was palpable you could feel the the the the pressure from one side the anxiety from the other and you could just feel that moment I thought this is incredible because here what what was it it was it was the greatest moment but what wasn't it was the unknown of what's going to happen and you could just feel that fear you could feel that anxiety and that that tension and that pressure that was there was so real and I'm just standing there and I just watch it that moment they're getting ready and the guy calls a timeout he's trying to ice the kicker and oh man you could that that tension just went up like 10 more notches in that room and and at that moment you know here they go and it's just about to happen and two or three guys just go I can't watch it anymore they just walk out they storm out of the of the restaurant and I'm thinking here you are you've waited the whole season for this here's the moment here's your team they're about to can you can't even at the greatest moment of Victory you can't even watch it you're so troubled I know y'all don't have weirdos like this in New Zealand it's all as us American weirdo goes you just pray for us and they can't even watch I thought it's so incredible because this is this is just pause for a moment this is exactly so much so real how people treat their life because sometimes at the very moment that God has you at that Junction or that Crossroad in your life and it's going to be the most important if you could he could say to he could say to Abraham Abraham if you'll just keep your faith right if you just keep your love right if you'll keep your confession right if you'll just pass this test I promise Abraham I'll bless you above all I'll bless your family I'll bless your home I'll bless you I'll pour out the window open the windows of Heaven you just got to keep your spirit right Abraham Hallelujah but it was so hard at this moment to have a right confession a right testimony and there are these people were and this guy's go storming out and I'm thinking ain't that something now you know what's amazing it's easy for me to talk cuz I could not care less about this football game I didn't even know until the game was over why it was so significant CU I don't I didn't care about college football but you know what these these people who really do care man they have so much invested in it you know what that me I didn't care at all it didn't really matter didn't really you know that's sort of how I feel about the way sometimes Believers I think we need to check oursel and have a reality check because sometimes we get I can't believe the reaction of Believers when politics happen and presidents get voted in and this is happening we get we we act like we're of this world or we act like that man is somehow in control don't let's just remind oursel it doesn't matter what president is in the states it it doesn't matter what Putin does it doesn't matter what Netanyahu does they're not in control of anything there's one thing in control of history and it ain't a man and a wife house it's a God in heaven and when he says it's over then it's over before then nothing can happen to me not even a hair on my head brother Ram said it this way Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you amen I have no investment in this world at all none and I had no investment in that game at all none and so I could just watch it happily and sort of Snicker at these people and I just watch and he goes out I can't even watch can't even watch here it is at the moment the greatest moment and he can't even watch but you know what's so amazing about that have you ever watched the man who's watching the replay of the game you ever watched him now here his team fumbles the ball but man he's just eating popcorn watch this but your team just threw an interception don't matter what is it his atmosphere is different it's the same game oh but his Revelation is different you see he already has a revelation of who wins in the end so he doesn't worry he doesn't panic he doesn't get stressed there's no anxiety he already knows it doesn't matter what happens in this life I might fumble the ball I might get make a mistake I might fall down but I'm going to get back up because I'm a winner in Jesus Christ oh if we could ever have that perspective that the story has already been written of our lives and there is nothing as a Believer you can go through that God is not already ordained for your life yes from the beginning to the end from the Cradle to the Grave everything brother brandham says it that way about Moses everything has all of his intellects he had all of the equipment bned bned with the equipment the only thing he lacked was the anointing brother Brandon says it was such a different Moses as the Moses prior to the burning bush the Moses prior had all the intellect he had all the training he had it all up here brother manam says and I think any Christian and until that he says it's a wonderful thing for you to have it all intellectually it's a good thing that we learn about the message it's a good thing we learn God sent a prophet it's a good thing we study our Bible good thing we read our Bible good thing we talk to the Lord but listen friends sometimes you can have it just intellectually in your heart intellectually in your mind but it's never dropped to the bottom and the core of your heart brother Bram says and Moses with all of his intellects with all of his understanding yet he had never came to that burning bush and that Burning Bush was not going to change what he had that Burning Bush was going to anoint what God had already placed in his life you see everything Moses lacked was in that burning bush and can I just say this here tonight my brother and my sister it's wonderful to look at the pillar of fire over the Houston Coliseum it's a wonderful thing to see that over brother bram's head but until that light that person leaves that picture and anoints your life and your equipment then it's nothing more you might be a good Christian you might be a good church member you might be a good message believer oh but I say God give me more than just a name only let me be an anointed vessel a vessel that can be used by you Lord Jesus notice here I want you just to parallel this and I just I'm I'm going to run out of time if I don't get to this his life just begins to unravel in such a sad way he's born as a Nazarite is going to have many many victories oh but he's going to have many defeats see how did it how did he get to this place brother Matt this man is born with such power such strength and he's not some great you know big old bodybuilder that's not Samson there's a reason why Delilah looked at him and said what is the secret cuz it ain't this brother random said he was just a little scny shrimp so what is the secret of your great strength wasn't that he had all this great power and he was great physical man but when the spirit of God came on him he was unnatural yeah yeah and and he could he could do things that no other man could do because of the power of God because of the ruach the Breath of God anoint in his life and notice this here he he could come to a place in his life he's born under this Nazarite vow he's God has used him to get many victories he he tells his his his his father he's going to be a deliverer God is going to blueprint his life and he's going to have an anointing upon him and and and and God even before before listen friends here's what's so powerful that even though God had blueprinted a life it didn't mean that God was going to force him it didn't mean that God was going to make him surrender his life to that plan yes you see God has a plan but he's also left us with free moral agency amen and we've got to make the choice yes sir for ourself mama can't make it Daddy can't make it the pastor can't make it oh if we could we would I promise if we could push a button and fill you with the Holy Ghost mothers and fathers would be breaking that button but we can't it's got to be your choice your decision as brother Brandon with Danny Henry and he's given the prophecy over his life and the interpretation of that un own tongue you ever catch what it says in that interpretation it says because thou has chosen not that I forced you not that I made you but you have chosen the harder way and then I love that the prophecy says and it's my way because this was a life that brother bam lived of self-denial and that was the way of Jesus every decision in his life led him to the cross it wasn't the cross was just the ultimate it was just the final surrendering of his human will he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and here was here was the prophecy over brother Ram's life because you have chosen it was a choice you have chosen the harder way and it's my way no one forced you no one made you you could have had a different way you didn't have to take that path but because you did there's a great portion of Heaven waiting for you you know what that great portion was you and me do you realize that friends when brother Ram goes beyond the curtain of time and he's laying back in his bed and brother Ram gets confused because of all these people and he says who are there your people and brother brandham said are all these Brams he says oh no no these are your converts the ones you led to the Lord his portion his great portion of heaven was the lives that he had impacted by that life of self-denial do we realize sometimes the choices that we're making has an impact has an effect it leaves behind a legacy it leaves behind an imprint come on young people get with me here the choices that you make have a have a have an impact have an effect little did he know go did it matter how many you know Jeremiah 29 for I know the thoughts the plans that you have for me but out of all of those plans it doesn't mean that we surrender to those plans he Samson was never fully going to surrender in his life he goes all the way to the very end of his life and he's blind he's shaved and his his outward image of this man bound with brass as brother Brandon said represents judgment yet long before the the physical chains he had been bound a long time long before they put out his eyes yeah Samson had been losing his vision and and he gets to this place and and and even even judges 14 we can go we can go through some of this I'm just going to I'm just going to skip through this I'm looking at my time now so let's just go to Genesis if you have your Bible turn to the Book of Genesis and I I just want to take you to a completely different place here Genesis chapter 28 you love the Lord here's another man that we could look at in his life and just draw from this man Jacob he's a very disobedient child of God Jacob Cher Sur planter but he was also an anointed servant now remember Jacob was not a good man you see Esau was actually a good man and brother Brandon points that out that in Esau's makeup his nature of who he was Jacob was a Shyer Jacob was a supplanter Jacob was a deceiver but there's a very big difference between a good man and a God man you see Jacob might not have been a good man at that moment but he was a God man because God had an anointing upon his life yeah and he couldn't get away from it and he comes to this place to where he's sinful he's disobedient and he's he's he's he's his sins have brought his entire family to rock bottom but I want you just to back up here for a moment in this man's life long before he gets to that place the Bible says that God Appears to him in such a supernatural way such a powerful way and God Appears to him at bethl and he sees a ladder in Genesis 28 and let's just pick it up here in verse 15 and he gives them this promise I I'll just I'll just begin at verse 12 we could read a lot more but just to save time he lights upon a certain place and he the Bible says he put them took stones of that place put them for his pillows and he dreams and behold a ladder set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and the angels of God ascended and descended the Lord stood above it and said notice this I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and of the god and the god of Isaac and the land wherein thou liest to thee the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed it's a very Supernatural experience but it's going to come with a a very special promise and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and shall spread abroad to the West the East the north the South and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and verse 15 God gives him one of the most powerful promises God says Jacob I am with thee I am with thee Jacob do you know do you know how powerful that is I Am with You Jacob and I will keep you in all the places whether thou goest Hallelujah you're going to make a lot of a lot of places Jacob you're going to go a lot of places that I never told you to go but I want you to know how powerful my promise is when I make it I will be with you Jacob and all of the left turns right turns U turns all of the turns that you make all the crossroads you come to in your life Jacob I want you to know that there will be nothing you can do in your life that will detach you Hallelujah from the promise I make to you Hallelujah it does not mean Jacob that you will ever find rest and you will find the place that I've called you to but I'm never going to stop I'm never going to stop pushing I'm never going to stop pressing I love that God says I want you to know how sure the promise is Jacob as brother brandham tells brother Billy Paul God's got a promise over your life son right and he holds us hands out like this you remember that as brother Billy Paul tells it in his testimony like a cross and he says you may go the long way you may run you may run from God you may go far you you you may you may turn away from the Lord but I want you to know God's going to bring you back it may come through hard times that you may come through sorrow through pain through loss of limb through loss of Health through loss of Mind through loss of spirit through loss of everything but I promise you if you're a Son of God if you're a daughter of God God will not lose you am you Lord oh I'm so thankful for that kind of Grace I want you to know you're going to go a lot of places Jacob but my promise is with you look at verse 15 for I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of Jacob wakes up you imagine the supernatural experience he comes to he wakes up and he says oh oh Jacob says in verse 16 sure the Lord is in this place and I knew it not oh how Dreadful that word is actually awesome is this place this is none other but the house of God and the Gate of this is the Gate of Heaven Jacob rose up early in the morning took the stone he had put upon it for his pillow set up a pillar you can imagine him trying to memorialize such a supernatural thing he's he's looking at the pillow the Rocks he slept upon and he says I'm just going to anoint this because that's where my head laid I'm going to anoint the stone because God spoke to me here what was it when God speaks to you put a marker down and say this was a special moment in my life Satan you might come in my life but I can always go back to that moment and say I may go a long way from that but at this moment I know God spoke to me at this meeting I know he deal he dealt with my heart I may not hear the voice of God at all right now but here's what I can say God spoke to me on that day he spoke to me at that moment I'm going to anoint this Stone because it's a special moment in my life and he's going to go you think brother Matt what happens to Jacob from that moment after he anointed oh he calls the name of the place bethl and he he anoints and he vows a vow in verse 20 if God will be with me keep me in this way that I go and will give me to to to to me bread to eat and reignment to put upon so that I come again to my father's house in peace he calls the name of the place bethl the house of God the house the dwelling The Vessel the house of God yeah beautiful you say where's he going to go from here brother Matt oh surely this journey the story is going to unfold is with all of these wonderful things that are going to take place no it's so sad how sometimes a very special moment moment doesn't always lead to a life and he's going to go 20 long years years from this moment and he's going to become so carnal my goodness so corrupted in his life 20 years following this marvelous powerful Supernatural experience and you know what follows that experience years of Trials sorrow trouble failure lots of it I'm talking lots of failure enough to make you doubt that I ever hear from God at all yeah but you know what I can tell you here tonight because the Bible tells us throughout all of the mistakes throughout all of the failure God never left him amen thank you Lord because God had joined himself to Jacob he had joined himself in in such a way even though this man settles down in apathy lukewarmness sinfulness and he quickly forgets the glory of that night and brother R like he says of the Ephesian Church they lost The Wonder of their message and even after all of this and and and all of that experience he'd become cold backslid lustful carnal I want you to pick it up here in Genesis chapter 31 we're going to close here we're just at 59 minutes so can you give me Grace just for a few can you give me Grace just for a few thank you God Appears to him again cold carnal backsliding lustful but he comes to him again and he says in verse 11 the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream saying Jacob and I said here I am he says here in verse 13 I am the god of bethl yes where thou anointed the pillar where thou vowed a vow unto me now arise arise same thing he says to that captive daughter arise get up Jacob what are you doing here what are you doing here Jacob get up I'm the god of bethl I'm not the god of the sin I'm not the god of your warness I'm not the god of that carnal carnal thing I'm the god of bethl Jacob he says in verse 13 get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy Kindred did he do it no God saying remember Jacob remember how I touched you remember how I spoke to you remember how I dealt with you Jacob get up put on your strength put on your beautiful garment why you lay there and allow the enemy to walk over you oh but I just need you don't you don't understand brother Matt oh I'll just when I could just get to this when this thing you know sometimes we wait and we wait and we wait and we put it off somewhere in the misty blue somewhere when this takes place and when then this happens and then when that happens and then when that takes place then I'll get right with the Lord when this takes brother Matt when I get to this spot in my life you know brother brandom said that that was actually the spirit that hung over his life as a dark shadow and kept him from surrendering his life to the Lord and brother bandam says I should have given my life to the Lord years before I did but a spirit hung over me saying you got time yeah that's right Jacob get up get up remember how I touched you remember how I talked to you go back to bethl go back to the altar instead Jacob doesn't Jacob settles down down in a town called shech God says go right do I still have you young people you still here you all right look this way it's all right God says Jacob go left Jacob goes right God says go forward Jacob goes the other way and God comes to him again in Genesis 33 turn there with me God tells him once again Jacob get up get up Jacob instead he goes to this land called Sheck you know what shech means it means going back not going back to bethl backsliding it's powerful because it also this word sheam means the place of burdens you know anytime we become disobedient to the Lord we can guarantee ourselves we're going to the place of burdens Sheck him he gets into all kinds of trouble he had no clue what that decision that choice would cost him he goes there in his house the the Bible says was Dishonored one of his daughters is raped did you ever imagine Jacob when you disobeyed the voice of the Lord what would take place in your family did you ever imagine the Calamity that you would bring by just not obeying the voice of the Lord his sons murder become murderers they weren't murderers before but they go and murder the men who did that to their sister you imagine the weight of this man friends I know that's very sobering but I want I just I think sometimes the gospel needs to be bare knuckled because life is bare knuckled and the consequences of sin I it it it it the consequences and the results of sin are horrible and Jacob's life becomes unwind and begins to you could almost say spin out of control his family's defiled his name is defiled his sons have now become murderers all because he's at the wrong place when God told him to go to bethl he goes to sheam it's amazing because you could think to yourself my goodness what a disobedient servant he is Jacob how could you how could you do this but do you know what the voice of the Lord says to Jacob notice here in verse 11 the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream saying Jacob I said here am I and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the Rams which leap upon the cattle verse 13 I am the god of bethl notice here this is God speaking to this weird to this Aid and ser it now Jacob has no idea Jacob you could imagine just for a moment you know be honest with yourself young people if this was you in fact if you could say if you were God In This Moment how would you have spoken to Jacob exactly it's amazing because sometimes we would treat ourselves or others so differently than how the Holy Spirit treats us and God comes to Jacob in such a powerful way forgive me just reading out of 31 and 33 and God comes to Jacob in such a powerful way there's no there's no chiding in fact there's there's no why didn't you listen why didn't you obey my instructions why are you so weak Jacob why are you so disobedient Jacob instead no he just says get up go to bethl go back to the altar go back to your first love get up Jacob it's once again it's the same words it's the same encouragement friends let me just tell you God is word God's word his message is not going to change to you his word is just going to keep coming at you his word is going to keep preaching at you you can go ahead and get this settled in your mind you say Lord when are you going to finally give up when am I just going to finally cross the line and finally you just say you know what done with you I'm done I should have never started listen friends you can go ahead and rest assure on one thing you might walk away from God God will never walk away from you you might give up on God God is never going to give up on you he's going to keep pressing he's going to keep pouring he's going to keep loving he's going to keep preaching he's going to keep encouraging until you get up get up Jacob and you know what Jacob does this time he goes back to bethl and the Bible says he gets rid of all of his idols wakes up and tells his wife Cast Away all your Idols Cast Away all your earrings and he says Cast Away all of the all of the shame all all everything that we've everything that we've been identified before with I want you to lay it all aside lay it all aside I want you to I want you to get up Jacob gathers his family they go back to bethl and you know what happens in bethl he's restored back to who he was in the first place friends there's only one thing waiting for you at bethl and that's restoration not condemnation not why did you do it not you're never going to be good enough not not you sorry you sorry thing if there's only one thing waiting at bethl and that's restoration that's a father with outstretched arms ready to receive you back again you know what's so powerful when he goes back this time I've preached out my time but I'll just say it here you know what he names that place he doesn't name it bethl he names it El bethl it's very different because it's not going to be the house of God it's going to be the god of the house it's very different when it's the house of God and when it's the god of the house brother bandham comes and I want the musicians just to return now brother bham comes to a place and he's in Flint Michigan I I believe that's the city he's in and he's he's there to pray for the insane he's there to pray for those that are have lost mine and brother brandom gets so overwhelmed in that moment you could just hear it in the tape there he preaches just play something just the piano for now if you could just something softly he he he comes to that that Asylum and boy I couldn't imagine being in the shoes and here you are as people look at you as the Healer and here's people that are beating their head against the wall screaming and straight jackets and they're injecting them with shots and and just out of their mind just lost and and and you ask yourself how did you get to this place brother bam is starting to ask that he he tells in another place and he's talking and he's in South Africa and he's seeing men laying on the street and they've soiled their pants and their bums laying on the street and and brother Brandon's just saying surely something could be done done about this how does a man end up like this how do you get to that place in your life and and the prophet of God looks at that situation and he just looks so hopeless and he's looking at that all of all of just a just hard cases you no doubt how we would look at it and say how did they how did they get there how do you find yourself many times and I don't mean it in any kind of a critical way but many times I've sat there and looked at a man there at the stoplight and he's got a sign up and he's begging for food and you know beard down to here and no shirt on and he's dirty and dis shoveled and he's and he's asking hungry help have a family and you know many times I've stopped there and and just when he's not looking at me and I'm just I just stare into his eyes and I just think to myself how did you how did you get here how did your life when you were five when you were 7 years old playing in the yard when you were 10 13 when you were a little girl dreaming of your house and your babies and [Music] your and dress up dolls and did you ever imagine did you ever could you ever have imagined that you would have ended up here my goodness did they ever think in their life that when they were 10 when they were 12 say how did they get there brother Matt one choice after another Choice after another Choice after another [Music] choice and sin has a way of settling like dust over our life and then before you know it we're 20 and we've got the same problems we're 25 same issues in that trajectory 30 we've got the same problem 35 40 and you watch so many times we think somewhere down the road down the road it'll I'll get over it down the road I'll overcome it somewhere and we become like that captive daughter laid on the ground no one put her there but herself in fact no one put the chain around her that's why that's why the voice of God says loose yourself from the bond from the band around your neck yes amen who's going to deliver me who's coming no one's coming child you've got the power already inside of you you just have to get up it's what his message is to Jacob get up Jacob so many times we're waiting for a preacher we're waiting for this person we're waiting for this sensation waiting for this moment and the moment's right here right now and it just takes our choice brother Bam gets so overwhelmed he's looking at those cases they look impossible and he just he just Rings his hands he says Lord where do I even start a little girl can imagine little girl 20 something years old I think brother bam says says she ra raises her finger and says sir I wish you would start with me and brother Bram says you you're not a patient here she says yes brother brandham I wish you'd hear my story she says I was raised in a good home I had a good mother taught me to do do the right taught me to shun the wrong had a good home she says but I got with the wrong friends got with the wrong group and she says I got with a boy and and and before I knew it I was you know he says he'd put something in my drink and the next thing I know I wake up and she you know the the girl just begin to to to tell brother brandham and her her life and she had she had she had she had lost her Purity and that girl says and from that moment from that time it's amazing because the prophet preaches that message I think it's three times maybe four and he says you know all of us could look back to that one moment that one time when we could say there's where it all changed right there can pinpoint back to that one moment and it was all different and that girl says it was that one moment from that time I was different brother Bram said I started drinking and one drink led to two and led to three and before you knew it I was an alcoholic couldn't have just wanted to drink all the time she went on for years like that and every year new year she'd try to try to make some turn a new leaf and I'm going to get over and she tried to get help she went to Alcoholics Anonymous took her to the good Shepherd's home she says and they tried to you know they converted her to a Catholic and she said I did pretty good for a little while brother Brandon but then I went right back to it then they led me check took me and converted me from a Catholic I think it was from a Catholic to a Protestant and and brother brother she says brother Brandon says I did good for a little while but she says then the trajectory just kept getting worse she says then I I went right back to my alcohol and then before you knew it brother Bram I was on the street selling my body a prostitute think about that from that time and brother Brandon begins to deal with that sister and he says oh oh sister what about your mother what about your father she says oh they're dead brother Brandon they're going long what about the rest of your family I ain't got none no mother no father no brother no sister says no brother Brandon they're all they're all going look at what I've done look I've made a mess out of my life and brother brandom says but sis says don't you don't you have a desire to to to have a family so you could just see it in her eyes oh brother brandom oh how I long for that so much says don't you long to have little babies Oh and be a mother she says oh brother Brandon might do she says oh but but who would have me [Music] prophet of God says sis the Lord Jesus will have you and you can imagine to get to such a place she says oh brother brandom what could I offer the Lord Brother brandham says there's only one thing you can offer sis and that's your soul to Jesus Christ she says oh but but what about me brother brandham I've lost my Purity he wouldn't have me back brother brandham says oh sis let me tell you the blood of Jesus can take you back to your virgin before you when you were a virgin before you were guilty and shameful of your sin the Lord Jesus can take you back Guiltless before God oh my brother my sister let me just preach to you here for a moment the blood of Jesus is greater than any problem it's greater than any mistake it's greater than any failure I just want to tell you here tonight your failure is not final it is not the final word it is not the Final Chapter it is not the end of your story the blood of Jesus can take the vile of Sinner and wash them white before [Music] God I wonder if there'd be someone with your head bowed could you bow your heads with [Music] me I wonder if there'd be someone as we've just coming to now to the [Music] end I wonder if there'd be someone like that little sister maybe You' to say to the Lord Lord would you start with me I see a hand up God bless you brother God bless you sis raise it to the Lord now not to brother Matt the Lord sees that hand you know God seen that stone when Jacob thought he was just being emotional God refers to it and says when you anointed the pillar God sees that hand he sees that heart say Lord I feel like a mess I feel like the last chapter of my life my life Lord i' I've made so many mistakes can't go back if I could only go back what she says to brother Brandon if I could only go back [Music] again if I could only go back to that moment but from that time my brother my sister I want to tell you the Lord Jesus can take you back to that moment the Lord Jesus can take turn back the hands of time I'm not talking about your human mistakes sometimes we make mistakes in our life and in our journey of life we fall and we cut ourselves and we live with the scars of that but the blood of Jesus can take you back to your Guiltless condition before God before you was ever in trouble before you ever made that mistake let me tell you no matter what you've thought before the blood of Christ is sufficient and Powerful to transform The vious Sinner to a Blood Washed Holy Ghost filled saint of God Guiltless before God you don't have to live with that guilt you say I've tried so many times that's all right that's all right I've made a I've made so many attempts at it oh but tonight can be from that time you could say from that moment from that instant I was changed forever my guilt was gone forever God can restore a right mind a right Spirit a right heart oh hands up all over the building my hand I invite you those that have your hands raised I invite you to stand to your feet now in a sign of surrender and say Lord I'm bringing all of me all of my needs all of my tears all of my pain all of my torment all of the voices in my head all of the things the devil has tried to lie to me about I'm I'm laying it down right now and saying I'm giving it all to you I've made a mess of it Lord I I can't fight it anymore I'm laying down my pride I can't conquer it anymore that guilt is suffocated ating my life it's trying to take me out but but God I'm here to tell you I'm giving it to you now Lord Jesus I'm making a start right now and not just turning over a new Leaf I'm really going to come down and contact God and say Lord I'm here back back again at bethl I wonder if you would say by enough the hand God be the god of the house I don't just want to talk about the house of God I want you to be the god of my house be the god of my testimony be the god of my vessel the god of my body my spirit my soul I want to make a choice friend it starts with something so simple starts with a choice

purpose purpose that it was sent for I see Hands Lord I see hearts I see tears Lord from some father May those tears be tears May that may the breeze of Calvary just blow over that soul may they flow
