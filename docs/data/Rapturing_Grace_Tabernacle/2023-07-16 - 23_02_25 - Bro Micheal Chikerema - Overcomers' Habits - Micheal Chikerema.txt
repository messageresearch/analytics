see you all I've longed to see you all face to face soon the Lord made it possible this weekend I don't know if this is powered up or I can keep talking that's all right yeah so happy to be here this weekend many of you obviously are seeing me for the first time my name is Michael my surname is a bit difficult for many of you to pronounce but you just go with the vows it's chicarima c-h-i-k-e-r-e-m-a to those that speak Africans you know exactly what it means that scale him so it used to be my grandfather's nickname he was called a scaling because he used to train horses and he was quite good at it so they whenever they had issues with horses and oxen remember the olden days when they were making roads they would have like 10 pairs of auction and sometimes when they are tired they play tricks and they start just pretending like they're confused so that they can take a break so he was known for making sure he separates them and keeps them all in line and so they called him scale him so that's why I got my Nick my surname from uh but uh so yeah based in Perth Western Australia I'm originally from Zimbabwe if you know your map it's right there on the southern tip near the southern tip of Africa that's where I'm originally from I've been in Perth this December will be nine years I also worked and lived in Botswana also southern Africa lived there for about seven years so I speak a little bit of setswana but I'm no expert so happy to be in the service of the Lord I was speaking to brother Fred last night and he did ask my age I turned 40 last September he said oh you're a young boy I said brother I've been in the ministry since I've been 20. so I feel like I'm already about to retire now so I started in the ministry when I was pretty young and I was looked just like this so I don't really change with age I guess I'm hoping to be still looking like this when I'm 60. so we want to appreciate the Lord so much I consider brother Elroy a friend amen we haven't known each other for a long time sometimes you meet some people once or twice and you kind of connect and you feel like you're good friends amen and so happy to have him we were tremendously blessed to have him when he visited Us in Perth and preached for us when we had special meetings and we are still talking about those services so I had this opportunity to come this weekend and we felt we could grab it and I could come down and and I quickly fly back even at the airport they were asking me so when do you go back I said Monday and it was hard for them to believe like you know what's the point but uh we could only grab these four days for me to come down so we appreciate the Lord for that happy to see you all I guess we'll go straight into the scripture we pray and then I've got just a few things to share with you uh that would be great want to appreciate family my brother-in-law I hate to say brother-in-law my brother in love and my sister in love and their family who are hosting me and traveling with me around brother Morgan sister patience and and the children amen difficult to say Josiah the children because he doesn't seem to fit that category so somebody happy to have them with us we'll go straight into the scripture if we could read the book of Matthew chapter 21 we start from verse 21. just want to salute all uh brother Elvis wife I understand we can call her sister pillar so we have the appreciate your sister and uh happy to see you and meet you in person Matthew chapter 21 we start from verse 21. the Bible reads Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not he shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if he shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive may the Lord that blessing to the reading of his word if we could just bow our heads for a word of Prayer Lord Jesus you saw this day you saw this group you saw this father from before the foundation of the world we are meeting for the first time knowing each other in the flesh for the first time but father oh God you saw this meeting from before the foundation of the world and father though it'd be good to meet one another and father Lord to just speak in general and have Fellowship but father speaking and gathering around the word of God is a beautiful thing and father oh God how can we speak of your word and be inspired without your spirit we father pray for an infused connection with the throne above that you may come amongst us tonight and father in this interactive fellowship with your love those that you have died for father those that you chose in this generation that is lost and seeking Pleasures seeking of God all kinds of ungodly satisfactions you have chosen these young people father and called them by their name and father Lord surely you wouldn't gather them tonight to hear from no man I pray in the words that shall be spoken may your Holy Spirit give action May the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit direct may your Holy Spirit father come down and be able to minister to the house of the people and we shall be careful father to give you all the glory and the honor and the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord so I understand I don't have to be preacher like we can talk and and then just share a few thoughts just for your comfort um and just as a disclaimer when I get excited sometimes I shout sometimes I jump I'm trying to give a very good impression so I'll avoid to do that tonight [Laughter] so if if I shout I'm not trying to dominate I'm just excited and I get a bit emotional my passion takes over but I'm I'm not expecting that to happen tonight and I'm also not a long-winded preacher I I usually preach an hour an hour 15 minutes so tonight I intend to do a bit shorter speak for 45 minutes or something like that so don't you worry about it I'm don't see me going and think man we'll be here until midnight hahaha that would be very unusual unless the Holy Ghost leads that way if it's the Holy Ghost I'm sure it will be easy on everybody but that's my intention so I want to speak on Overcomers habits Overcomers habits as you interact with I mean being in the faith and interacting with people and pastoring a group of people and interacting with people in various situations you start to notice one thing that I think is very important for all Christians not just young people especially young people but I think all Christians you wish we had a good grasp on it that nothing in the faith nothing of God it works in a flicker switch kind of mode you know sometimes many people when they come they are not feeling well they want prayer if they don't get healed instantly many a time even if the Lord is what the miracle in their life they lose their healing because where I was prayed for I'm still feeling the same sometimes when somebody's struggling with a certain habit is struggling with certain thoughts struggling with something and they come and they sit down with the pastor or any Elder of the church and they confession they want that thing to end right there and sometimes God does that but many a time it doesn't happen that way um and and maybe somebody's seeking for a breakthrough there want it can be a trade it can be something in their life that they really want to achieve many times people want to be prayed for and you know I was prayed for a church or I lifted up my hands or I went to the altar I was prayed for and so this thing should happen right now um and and and that in itself becomes a source of major disappointments to a lot of Christians and and and and that's where sometimes people lose their faith that's why sometimes people think the message is all talking no God in it but when you look at the scriptures when you really go back to the scriptures anything that ever amounts to anything significant is always come as a result of a habit or a result of persistence amen so we want to talk about Overcomers habits and when you talk about an overcomer an overcomer is a person that encounters uh that encounters difficulties that encounters resistance that encounters negative forces that are working against their progress but yet they are able to go through and overcome whatever is standing in their way any obstacle in their way and come out the other side Victorious that's an overcomer an overcomer is not a person sitting down doing nothing because they're afraid of making mistakes and Overcomer is not a person who fails once fails twice fails three times and gives up that's not an overcomer that's a quitter an overcomer is a person who fails once fails twice fails three times four times five times but still keep going at it that's an overcomer and so when we talk about this message and we say it's an Overcomers message we are not talking about people who are sitting doing nothing chickening out of challenges is not trying anything because they are afraid of making mistakes we are talking about people who are human beings who have weaknesses we have failures but they never give up they continue whatever they are facing they face it once twice three times whatever many times they face it they continue to fight on until they come out the other side Victorious that's an overcomer and when we talk about the Habit we are talking about something that you constantly do I think I've got a definition here that I found in one of the online dictionaries which says a habit is an acquired behavior pattern regularly followed until it has become almost involuntary it is an acquired pattern acquired means you are not born with it means it doesn't come naturally to you you acquire it because you keep doing it you are quiet because it's not inside but you make sure that you keep doing something over and over again until it becomes a part of you until it becomes so set up in you it says that the pattern is regularly followed until it has become almost involuntary you keep doing it over and over again until you start doing it without thinking amen and if you look in the Bible any people that ever had strong Victory where people that actually were very prone to habits amen so habits are not bad it just depends what kind of a habit you have so in this case we are talking about good habits and so the Lord Jesus Christ in that scripture we read in Matthew 21 says that you can ask anything and you should not doubt it and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive now if you go to the Book of Mark chapter 1 and we go to verse 30 Mark chapter 1 and we go to verse 30. the Bible reads but Simon's wife's mother lays sick of a fever and unknown they tell him of her and he came and took Hair by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them and that even when the son did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed of devil with devils and all this city was gathered together in the door and he healed many that were sick of diverse diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the Devils to speak because they knew him and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and they prayed and Simon and they that were with him followed after him and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee right that's what we find the Lord Jesus Christ doing isn't it in Mark chapter 1 verse 30 if we look if we open our Bibles to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 6. Luke chapter 6 if we go to verse 12 the Bible says and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God and when it was day he called unto his disciples and of them chose 12. whom also he named the apostles Simon whom he also named the surnamed named Peter and Andrew his brother James and John Philip in battlemeu Matthew and Thomas James the son of alpheus and Simon called zealots and Judas the brother of James and Judas Iscariot which also was the traitor so you notice something that the Lord Jesus did you can already see a pattern there's many other scriptures that we could refer to but this is just to give us a snapshot of what the Lord Jesus Christ in his ethnic Ministry did he had one very strong habit that was prayer so everything that we witness about his ministry all the Miracles even the choosing of the disciples was connected to prayer amen all the wonderful tremendous Miracles that we read about in the scriptures that the Lord Jesus Christ did In the Flesh they were connected to a habit and that was that the Lord Jesus Christ was always in prayer amen nothing ever nothing tremendous nothing significant ever happens without doing something over and over again trying harder putting your time putting your energy putting your effort and everything in life whether it's good or bad no Sportsman becomes an Olympic gold medal winner when others are in the uh sporting field training or in the gym lifting weights or doing anything they are busy eating markers and you expect to win the Olympic gold medal it's not going to work even if you juice yourself up with steroids you still need a little bit of exercise you know steroids don't work on everybody they work on somebody who has potentials and somehow they they they polish up and Juice you up to be a little bit more able to perform than than others but the fact Still Remains you've got to be able to practice spend hours in the gym spend hours on the track running up and down so that you can be able to win something of significance it's like that in the world if you listen to all these things that have been discovered you listen about how Steve Jobs was able to start up his company together with his friend Stephen and them you notice that they were in a garage time and time again trying things out and trying this and joining a tech club and going there and attending meetings and sharing ideas how many hours did they spend just involved in the things that they wanted to achieve whether it's attending a technical Club whether it's being in a garage putting things together trying things and failing tomorrow they don't give up and say well yesterday I failed so I'm not going to try anything today the next day they would come and try again and fail again amen and the next day come try fail again until they were able to put things together and everything started to work anything significant in life comes by effort comes by trying and comes by failure and not giving up when you fail because sometimes failure is the best thing that could do to that could happen to you failure could be the thing that keeps you going failure is the thing that shows you that if you try it this way it's not going to work because it doesn't work this way I've got to try in another way so your failure is good because it shows you what works and what doesn't work and so once it doesn't work you know you can eliminate that approach and try another one so one less Problem by the failure that you went through amen and so this is what life is all about so the Lord Jesus Christ here the habit and that was prayer and the prophet in the message the healing of Jairus daughter he says just the previous chapter we find a place where the Son of God spends so much time in prayer and if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer virgin born son of God sinless didn't come to the world speaking lies amen like we do amen we came the the hard way and but if the Virgin born sinless son of God called the prophesied by Isaiah prophesied in the scriptures the angel came down to tell the father about the promise of the word and he comes like that if that kind of an individual had to be constantly in prayer to stay in good fellowship with the spirit that was within him the prophet is asking the question how much more do you and I have to stay in prayer we read that the way the scripture says he was in prayer for the whole night amen we read in way the Lord was always in prayer he walked away a distance from his disciples walked away a distance from uh uh all the people that were gathered around him so that he could be in prayer and throughout the gospels you notice that was his habit always in prayer so that he could be in good fellowship with the spirit that was within him what about you and I so for us to really live a fulfilled life a perfect Christian Life and Overcoming life we cannot do it without prayer amen so for you to be an overcomer you've got to have the habit of praying amen prayer has got to become a part of your life that's the only way you can overcome one preacher was preaching he says the problem with Christians is they are part-time Christians but they are fighting a full-time devil that's the problem we are trying to fight a full-time devil and we are worshiping God part-time only on a Sunday that's when we think of church that's when we think of praying that's when we only want to save his day that's when we Are Spiritual enough or we try and speak to God it shouldn't be like that we should be a habit that is a believer in order to be in perfect harmony with the spirit that has been given to us we are always in prayer amen he spent much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant sometimes when you are in prayer God changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen do you believe that might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation where you say if God knows his is going to happen what would my prayer do if God knows is going to happen so what's the point you know and the Lord says you remember when he stood there looking out upon the Harvest he said he was the lord of the Harvest he said the Harvest his life is ripe the laborers are few pray the Lord of the Harvest that he will send the Liberals into his harvest in other words pray to me that I send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you it's such a needy thing but part of it lays in human beings now Jesus said in one place I am the vine and the other branches the vine can bear fruit the branches in the vine base fruit God cannot bear fruit of himself it's good to take the church is that right he's going to take you branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth see what I mean God wants your hands he wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips once your ears once your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you so there's things that God has purpose to happen in this generation there's things that people God has purposed to happen it's already in his plan he has purpose for those things to happen to this town to the surrounding towns or to your neighborhood wherever you are best in and he knows that that thing has got to happen but God doesn't expect you to just have those things happen and you haven't done anything about it though he has prophesied that those things should happen yet he expects you to do something about it amen he is already papers for the thing to happen and he wants you to be able to be part of it but it's not just going to come when you're seated doing nothing amen God wants it to happen he's already seen it happening but part of the mystery is you having a burden on your heart and praying about it and doing something about it then God comes to work through you amen that's that's life that's the Christian Life the Bible says Enoch walked with God it was not a walk where they were holding hands and say you know let's just go for a walk it was a life lived it was step by step today is going through this he deals with that next day he's going through these deals with that he was walking with God and he got to a point where he was so perfect in the eyes of God and he walked so further down the road so victorious in his work God says you know what let's go home amen so if you notice everything of God I hope I don't start a controversy by dropping this statement but you are a well-taught church I have confidence in brother Elroy so he will put things in place if if you feel like they've been misplaced the Rapture is a process that culminates in an event but we are already in the rapture because the rap just starts with the shout amen and the shout is the message so we are already in the Rapture but the Rapture is a process that culminates in an event so the Rapture is the life that we are living now the Rapture is the victories we are having every day the Rapture is the battles that we are fighting every day failing today overcoming tomorrow the Rapture is when we hear the word and we have stuck in a habit where there's gossip whether it's watching the wrong things on the internet whatever it is but you are in there and the preacher comes and preaches the word and somehow you get strength you get convicted and you go and you fight that thing I'm not going to click on that website I'm not going to say those things about people that's the Rapture that's the Rapture that's happening because all the nature the humanity is being overcome and we will have so much Victory one day until this world cannot hold us anymore that's the Rapture so the Rapture is a everyday Victory the Rapture is a walk the Rapture is failing and standing up and running again falling and standing up and running again that's the Rapture so people will be like you know I want to close myself in a room close myself in a room play the tapes Non-Stop you know I don't want to come out of there day in day out to close myself in a room stay away from people when I walk out of there I'm going to have Rapture and faith that's not the right approach because the Rapture is connected to your life your Perfection is connected to the life that you live you are not perfected without challenges you are not perfected without challenging you're gonna go through stuff you're gonna be tempted you're going to sometimes fail sometimes to stumble but the Rapture is you stumbling and still being able to maintain your trajectory amen so the Rapture is not a flicker switch kind of situation you know people want Rapture in faith but they don't want challenges people want Rapture in faith but they don't want problems people want Rapture in faith but they don't want to do and have good habits and be in prayer and read their Bibles and do the right kind of things but they want to be raptured the Rapture is going to come by the things that you go through you could close yourself in a room and play the tapes non-stop but as long as you're not living the life you cannot be perfect because your Perfection is connected to the full ordained experiences that God has already put in your life amen not everybody goes through the same challenges because you as an individual need a certain kind of challenge that might not be good for this other individual so we all have stuff that we are dealing with we all have weaknesses human weaknesses that we are dealing with to somebody's signal is cigarettes but you might even think man what's wrong with this brother how can you struggle to quit cigarettes it's a problem for him it may not be a problem for you but you may have a problem that this brother never even thinks of having but yet it's all we are all going through stuff but it's the victories that we have over these things that gives us Rapture and faith amen and so we've got to be in prayer and part of it lies in that amen and so God help us to see these things and then the prophet in the message communion he says now our bodies need food and drink each day to survive our physical body if we don't take food each day and drink then our body weakens there is something in us that we must have food one day food is not last one day's food will not last for the next day you've got to have food each day to strengthen your mortal being you can live over but you are weaker and the second day you are still weaker and the third day you are getting tremendous week well that's what many times that we do in spiritual realm you see each day we've got to commune with Christ you've got to talk to him each day with God to settle it with him each day Paul said I die each day see each day I die yet I live not me but Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the Lord each day to survive right so it's just the same if your natural body needs food your spiritual body needs food as well men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God so each day we've got to study the Bible some people doesn't study that oh some picks it up every two or three times a year but a real real believer that's really spiritually built up he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord that's right he has to men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God one of the biggest problems that we have is we expecting God to come with a big trunk of time and say here you are sister I give you a week with nothing to do so that you can read your Bible here is a bag full of time I give you my brother so that you can read the Bible guess what life is too hectic for that you're gonna be required to do school you're going to be required to do homework you're gonna be required to do chores at home gonna be required to do this that or work or college or university whatever it is life is so hectic if you're a parent there's kids involved there's bills to be paid we all hate those white envelopes in the mailbox but they keep coming and they never stop sometimes you see one you ignore it next week There's a friendly reminder about the first one that you ignored right so there's always things happening in your life there's always going to be stuff happening in your life so you are never going to get time to say well you know what finally I have so much time to read my Bible now this life is going to be demanding of your time and energy you know the prophet says that in the message let him off pressure the prophet says the devil has made it so so that we are working under pressure all the time because when we are under pressure then we are prone to making decisions that we would not normally make if we were relaxed so the world system has been configured by the devil to work against good decisions and good lives because you are in a survival mode every day you you're trying to just survive it it feels like you need a 36-hour day because 24 hours is not enough amen people are drinking Red Bull people agree because the energies the energy is just not there to do all the things that are required of you so you're never going to have enough time you never going to have enough energy in your body to think oh man now I can take a seat sit on my rocking chair then read my Bible so you have got to adapt with the times you've got to be able to still be able to hear the word of God how can you do that well you drive 20 minutes 30 minutes from your house to work you drive I don't know how long from this place to that place guess what you've got audio Bibles amen so you you might not get the time to sit down and start flip through to start to flip through the pages of a Bible but guess what you could still read the Bible because now we've got all your Bibles amen so instead of you waiting and be like you know what I'm gonna be stuck in traffic I'm not too sure here but in the bigger cities I'm sure traffic is a big is a huge problem and obviously now with the landslides and everything that's happened you could be stuck waiting for traffic one lane is open you are standing there sitting there in your car for 10-15 minutes guess what 10 15 minutes you would have listened to two chapters of the Bible you know what I mean so you've got to change how you think you've got to change how you think you've got to be able to live in today you've got to be able to know 24 hours is not going to be enough I'm never going to have enough time to listen to the message to read my Bible but you know what I have a way of maximizing my time I've got a 30 minutes break lunch break or 45 minutes lunch break you know what I'm gonna read the whole chapter of the Bible I'm gonna start on the Book of Matthew chapter one and I'm gonna say by June where I will be I tell you by June you'll be finished with the New Testament you know so if you think I want to read the Bible from cover to cover and you think you're gonna have three months of just sitting doing nothing reading the Bible from cover to cover you might never get that time but you know what if you start beginning of the year and whatever opportunity you can get and you start listening to an audio Bible by the time you get to Christmas time you've been through the Bible you've probably started on the seven changes you are now on the Seven Seals right so it's all about what kind of habits do you have what kind of a habit You're Expecting you've got to have good habits you've got to be able to know what to do with your time you've got to be able to really structure things because you know that without feeding on the word you are weaker but when you feed on the word of God you are stronger you know that you've got to be in a time of prayer you've learned to create that time you learn to find Corners in the house you learn to find Corners in the school you learn to find Corners in the University you learn to find Corners in the workplace where you can go and Whisper a prayer because if you are waiting for I'm gonna try and clear everything then I'll have all the time to myself so that I can start praying brother I tell you three days can go without you saying a single breath all right and if you notice time for prayer is the difficult time even people's moods change when it's prayer time have you ever seen how prayer time people get upset when you say come let's pray I'm still doing this I'm just coming out of the shower you wait a little bit oh I'm still eating oh there's always something that comes up when it's prayer time everyone has got their priority it's very difficult to get everyone to say oh you know what we are now all ready can we pray everyone feels like whatever they are doing on the phone is a priority whatever they are doing in the kitchen is a priority whatever they are doing in the bathroom is a priority and before you know it everybody is frustrated and everyone just goes to their rooms and you go and sleep without praying and we expect to overcome a full-time devil in this generation loudisha living lives like that we can't we are too weak the world says our bodies spiritually we are like our bodies if you've got days without eating you get weaker you may get by but your strength is getting weaker and weaker so is it also spiritually so you've got to develop good habits develop good habits develop the right you know know how to do what to do with your time and as a human being learn to just look at your day and say how much of my day was focused on the things that pertain to the kingdom of God I'm not going to ask because we don't want to embarrass each other maybe I'll be more embarrassed than you you never know so but I'm saying sometimes there's a human being be honest with yourself right and just sit down even now take your time and think okay apart from the service since morning how much of my time was focused on the things that pertain to God and you'll be shocked to find out how much of our time goes to other things that don't really pertain to the kingdom of God it's a huge portion of our time but yet we Are Spiritual Beings we are here for that purpose to live for God and to be Overcomers but how can we be Overcomers when we are more involved in the things of the world than the things that pertain to the kingdom that we know we're a part of now I think each one of you for a few moments ago when you were singing for you I am praying that's what I want you to do it's prayer that I depend on that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the key that opens the door to everything of God everything of God is prayer if you pray and believe when you pray then believe that you receive what you ask for and God will make it known the big Mysteries there's there's no you know Fantastics and fireworks and strobe lights and for you to start believing that things that will happen just a simple life of Prayer will make you such a powerful believer you you're looking for something that is like super duper you know people always want to really feel like you know I felt like I was charged up you know that's Batman in Jurassic Park and all kinds of stories that's that's Shazam that's that's that's the Magic win you know Cinderella stories but when you come to the gospel it's deliberate moves habits prayer fasting reading your Bible being involved in the things of God it's simple basic stuff that actually makes you the powerhouse sometimes with got to be you know whatever we imagine but what makes you what gives you Joy what gives you the power to overcome is really basic stuff really basic stuff so I think we've mentioned on prayer Jesus in the message Believers doubt this 530906. now it comes to our text one place quickly listen close he went over to live with the mother in Mary and them at Bethany now he was called away when Jesus went away from that home sickness and sorrow come in and when Jesus goes away from your home sickness and sorrow will come in yes sir watch if you turn Jesus down at your home quit having family prayer quit having Bible readings and so forth in your home look for trouble to come in that's right it's on its Road right then so sometimes you just wonder well you know we're just living a life of Victory we have so much joy in our home how come things are working you know sometimes we are so used to bad things happening you start wondering why is things bad things not happening because we are so used to them you think something should happen it's been a long time since something terrible has happened you know what maybe you are living the right kind of life sometimes we wonder why bad things happen to us why did this thing happen why did that thing happen the previous thing sometimes it's because we've chased Jesus away from our lives and how do we do that we do that by not reading the Bible by not having family Prayer by not doing all the right Christian things simple Christian things that we should do in our homes and the Bible says the moment you move that out of your home watch out because trouble is already on its way there's a lot of unknown things to us that are actually happening in the spiritual Realm when we are living simple Christian lives you don't know what's happening in the spiritual Realms when you are kneeling down to pray you don't know what's happening in the spiritual Realms when you are reading your Bible you don't even know what's happening in the spiritual Realms when you are just seated meditating on the word of God I'll read the quote where problem says it very clearly in the message blind batimians 660-330 the prophet says we put a lot of time and things but God wants us to come apart and just sit down and worship him and talk with him talk it over I love that all that sweetness that's the greatest time of anybody's life is just to sit down and meditate take everything off your mind if you would do that there wouldn't be so much nervousness around the country if we would just think on God draw nigh unto me and I will draw nigh unto you sometimes all this depression that's affecting us all this nervousness he always on the edge frustrated with life so many things your brain is running at 250 kilo miles per hour there's just so much stuff happening you seem like you can't cope the prophet gives a very simple remedy say sometimes what you need it's just to take a little bit of time sit down and meditate can you imagine we we are looking for what can I do you know you want the preacher to come and say come out in the name of Jesus you know you want the past to shake you up you want the pastor to see a vision vision is right there you want a dream you want something you you want to see an angel come flapping the wings down sometimes you just need to take your time sit down and meditate huh but sometimes you are running you are so fast everything has got to happen now sometimes what you need is just to cool down take some moments think of the word of God think of God think of a wonderful hymn start Hamming it if you know the word start singing it amen just relax just relax listen to a nice good worship song play some beautiful Spiritual music even when you feel like exploding in the traffic just play some wonderful worship and people will see you raise your hands up and they wonder what's happening with this person you don't know red road rage when you're in that Realm amen sometimes we are showing each other singer because people are not in the right space of course but you can break out of that Realm into a certain place that just calms you down it doesn't mean these things are not happening it's all around you but your meditation can create a gaussian for you sometimes we don't realize this we will spend so much money going through counseling taking so much medication which is all good but sometimes the solution is right there in the wood how much of your time is going to the world many a time we spend more time worrying about our problems than meditating on the world and the world creates more pressure for us makes us more frustrated more unhappy makes the situation worse in another space in another place brother Brown says something very profound very striking says America does not need an atomic Wars and all these defense systems he says they now need those things because they have taken the Bible from their homes and prayers from public schools so even the feeling that your enemies have for you can actually be caused by your actions you can place yourself in a spiritual position where even your enemies don't think of attacking you because of the atmosphere that you have created around you many a time we invest so much time on on the material on the security on on all these things that money and effort can produce and yet what we actually need is very cheap and free of charge we just need to be taking the right stand instead of you going around the workplace and trying to say bad things about your boss or bad things about that person that you're competing with for position in the University so much time and you get so creative and say this person you know did you hear what they said about you I don't think I should tell you but I'll just tell you and you cook up all these stories and invest so much time in gossiping and all the Slender what you just need is be in the right place and that person will not stand the chance because God is standing with you amen Jehovah the prophet says quit reading old funny stories and looking at old no good television programs and back to the church to praying you say a woman said well I just can't find time to read my Bible to my children why Susanna Wesley she had 17 children and she spent three hours a day with no modern convenience she didn't press a button to wash her dishes she didn't turn on a tip to get little water out like that she petted it from a spring in an old wooden bucket and they got deeper pegged it from the spring and raised 17 children and could spend three hours a day in prayer what did she raise up out of it a John and a child Hallelujah yes certainly men that shook the world in their days we could go on and on and on about the great things that took place in the scriptures the Bible says they could not throw away Moses because they found that he was a proper child and brother Branham comes and verbraham says they knew he was a proper child because your Shepherd and emram had been praying and worried about the situation amongst their people and in prayer God had come down and revealed to Imran that I shall give you a son who be a deliverer there's so many issues stories in the Bible where brother Branham says actually they were in prayer or he was in prayer or she was in prayer when it comes to Mary and the angel visiting her what does the prophet say the prophet says she was meditating on that scripture on the promise of the Virgin shall conceive the process she was meditating on the world and when she was meditating on the word the angel of the Lord came down in the book of Acts it was when Peter was fasting and praying and on the upper chamber and he was wicking his body but strong in his Spirit then the angel appeared to him the commission of the prophet in Greensville cave brother Brahma had said to me that if I don't return you take care of my children I'm so confused I don't understand what this is all about but I'm going to a place of prayer and he was prepared to die and that night in prayer and reading the scriptures the angel of the Lord came down and said fear not if you look at so many significant things in the scriptures you notice they came when somebody was laboring in prayer when somebody was meditating on the world Joshua was told meditate on this book of the Lord day and night so it doesn't mean you're you're you are less spiritual than somebody else I went to school with a guy I'll call his nickname we need them we nicknamed him guapo and Guapo was not sharp I tell you I've seen people who can't understand Guapo was another case Guapo would read the whole night when we had an exam in the morning and Guapo who have 11 out of 30. when some of us who were sleeping would be getting like 25 out of 30. and you wonder I mean what's the point of being awake but Guapo was like that Guapo would would spend so much time to study and he would come and wake us up and ask us how can you solve this and you just tried to explain it to him you could tell that man it was difficult for him to grasp things but all the years that I went to school with him he was like that and he just barely made it by the skin of his teeth to pass exams all the time he was always at 50 percent 51 just barely crawling across the line but right now he's an auditor doing very well you know what he didn't he never allowed his limitations to pull him down he could have easily accepted that situation and say what's the point what's the point you know I tried so hard I never get a high marks these guys are sleeping whilst I'm awake studying that guy would start so much he would dip his legs in cold water so that you don't dose of Debbie's legs in cold water well other people were snoring right next to him and you'll be studying and it gets 51 percent and the guy who's sleeping there gets 75 percent but he never allowed that to discourage him and right now his life in terms of just looking at it from a natural standpoint is much better than the people that used to get 80 percent 90 percent why because he appreciated his limitations but he knew that what he could not have in terms of natural ability he could cover that Gap with hard work and many a time we shy away from hard work we shy away from some people can believe for something oh sister I prayed for this thing and I got it just like that maybe it doesn't work like that for you but guess what what you may not have easily like that you may out pray that sister that brother and you stay on your knees you keep believing you keep holding on until you get what you're asking for guess what later in life you look back at your life in the accomplishments that you have there might be much more than this individual so never compare your life to anybody never compare your abilities to anybody because you have your own path but never shy away from hard work I say to the church in Perth certain things should be easy for us we may not be some super duper Spiritual Church you may not have the greatest gift but I said coming later to church is just being lazy you don't need the special gift to come to change your time [Laughter] you know there are certain things that you don't need a special gift for you don't need a special gift to just come and live good quality quiet time in church and prepare for the service you don't need a special gift for that I said if we do the basics right like the prophet has taught us even if we're an average church if we do the basics right then we are not going to be average the problem is our approach is average and we're expecting tremendous results things don't work like that you can be average if I you can be awake the whole night studying the whole weekend studying and you come you preach on Sunday and people say well that was decent but you know what you put the effort in you did the best that you could amen you preached the best sermon that you can amen because that's what God has given you but imagine if I sleep like tomorrow is a Sunday and I say ah amen what can I preach I'm going to sleep and tomorrow I come and I don't even know which scripture to read is it the Book of John or Luke I'm confusing scriptures everyone is scratching their heads and wondering man where did Pastor auri meet this brother is confused man he's all over the place what a shame isn't it he may be average but if you do your things right you'll never be average you may have averaged abilities and gifting but you know what you outwork everybody else and see where God takes you develop the right kind of habits in your life that's why brother Billy Paul says to him if you want to be a bum be the best bum you can be and never work a day in your life be the best that you can be in your life amen I say to our music team I I everyone says you know Pastor you know we want our music to be like that change that change so God has given us Grace because we are sharing a building with the Pentecostal Church they come on a Thursday evening they start at 6 30 and sometimes I made the church in the office studying or whatever and they live on a Thursday evening midweek and they leave at 11 PM and I say to my music team I said you want to play good you want good music it's not we're not going to come to the Altar and pray and fast for it and expect it to work you guys have a lot of work to do [Laughter] there is a lot of practice sessions yes you pray you but you need to come and practice if you just sleeping like everybody else is just being average in your approach like everybody else you're gonna get the average results sometimes even below average but if you put the work in practice sing and do it again and do it again and again you become a master and before the preacher preaches people are already breaking in the spirit why because you've just done your Basics right that's the Christian Life it's basics program says I always fast and pray for three days before all my meetings and he says and in that period of fasting and praying the Lord most of the time shows me exactly what's going to happen in the meetings I just have to repeat it to the people so we look at brother branham's Ministry was God's Prophet look at how he lived look at how he lived look at how he approached things results don't just come easily hard work you want to achieve anything in life the modern day believer the young person who believes the message should understand hard work should understand effort anything in life even if you say well this message is not good enough for me or I'm not good enough for this message I want to try another life whatever you are thinking you are accomplishing that life is never going to come easy you know people see those artists with gold chains and all those things that are just sparkling all around you know when they see those heavy chains and all those expensive clothes and everything it didn't come easy they spent hours and hours in a studio practicing one line when you see them on the platform you think ah you know it just comes there just spitting verses from nowhere you look behind the scenes and see what happens young girls see actresses you know winning Awards and you know they want to live the faith and go to Hollywood and win Awards and the next thing you hear all these actresses saying they were abused by a certain big man in Hollywood but when they are receiving their Awards they never tell you what they went through how they got that part how did they get it they never tell you ah they get their award newspaper headlines and the young girls young men look at those things and they want to be like that nothing is cheap nothing is cheap there's a man called Bernie Sanders and Barry Barry Sanders used to play American football some of you may know it you know with the helmets in very hard contact spot at the top of his game he retired and people almost beat him up retire when they are in the top of your game he said this is a high contact spot you cannot do it for a long period of time I've done enough I cannot do it anymore people see success he'd been spotting it been anything in life they think it's easy it's not even easy being a devil as how difficult everything is so if you want to be bad really bad imagine that devil has a hard time imagine where you're going to be nothing is easy Brothers nothing is easy but it's also simple is developing the right kind of habits prayer reading your Bible singing songs participating in church doing the right things you will be so strong no devil can touch you no devil can visit your home and if they do make it through your door they don't stand a chance when you speak the word not because you are this great person but you are a child of God who knows where they stand may God we should bless you amen praise God foreign there we go really really enjoyed that brother Michael thank you very much and enjoy is probably the wrong word really spoke to my heart um and you know I want to say we can so easily say well you know I'm a young person and I don't want to put that time in yet and I don't want to dedicate my life here to whatever but the reality is if we want the results which all of us want the results then we also need to dedicate your time dedicate your time to spend some time in the world spend some time with the Bible spend some time in the message spend some time in prayer build a relationship with God those things are not going to come just automatically we have to also do our part I mean ultimately only God can change us we can't change ourselves but like I could rather see if we if we show dedication and we put in our birth of effort amen God takes that and he and he does a lot more with it than the better we can do I mean just really appreciate it Arnold I'll end up with you sing the song I'm amazed I'm in the key of C or candy okay let's sing in the cave can we go up to D is that okay I'm Amazed [Music] and my sins oh my sins [Music] how long how long I was feeling and The Emptiness I tried so hard to hide for though I laughed and said my life was
