[59:50] by the fire of god
[59:53] so romans chapter 12
[59:55] verses 1 and 2.
[59:58] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[1:00:01] mercies of god that you present your
[1:00:03] bodies
[1:00:05] a living sacrifice
[1:00:08] holy
[1:00:09] acceptable unto god
[1:00:12] which is your reasonable service
[1:00:16] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:00:18] be transformed
[1:00:21] by the renewing of your mind
[1:00:25] that ye may prove
[1:00:27] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:00:31] perfect
[1:00:32] will
[1:00:33] of god
[1:00:34] amen so we see the
[1:00:37] the the words there in the first verse
[1:00:40] one the living sacrifice that you
[1:00:42] present
[1:00:43] your bodies
[1:00:45] a living sacrifice
[1:00:48] go to hebrews chapter 12
[1:00:54] i was going to read verse 28 as well
[1:00:56] here
[1:00:59] hebrews 12 28
[1:01:03] wherefore we
[1:01:05] receiving a kingdom
[1:01:07] which cannot be moved
[1:01:09] let us have grace where
[1:01:12] by we may serve god
[1:01:14] acceptably
[1:01:16] with reverence
[1:01:18] and godly fear
[1:01:20] for our god
[1:01:22] is a consuming fire
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:27] so if we can also go to the book of
[1:01:29] kings first kings
[1:01:31] just i'm not moving too
[1:01:33] too quickly for
[1:01:36] you a bit easier for the minister at
[1:01:40] least i have all these little bits of
[1:01:42] paper through my bible because
[1:01:44] oftentimes you can get up in the pulpit
[1:01:45] and you can't find kings
[1:01:49] it's just those nerves kind of take over
[1:01:52] until you settle down a little bit and
[1:01:54] the lord takes over
[1:01:56] at first kings
[1:01:58] 18
[1:02:00] 36
[1:02:04] and it came to pass
[1:02:07] at the time of the off offering
[1:02:10] of the
[1:02:11] evening offering
[1:02:14] that elijah the prophet came near and
[1:02:16] said
[1:02:17] lord god of abraham isaac and of israel
[1:02:21] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:02:24] king
[1:02:25] in us so they are god in israel
[1:02:30] and that i am thy servant
[1:02:33] and that i have done all these things at
[1:02:36] thy word
[1:02:38] hear me o lord hear me
[1:02:40] that this people may know
[1:02:43] that thou art the lord god
[1:02:46] and that thou has turned
[1:02:49] their heart
[1:02:50] back again
[1:02:52] then the fire of the lord fell
[1:02:55] and consumed
[1:02:57] the burnt sacrifice
[1:02:59] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:03:02] and licked up the fire
[1:03:04] that was in the trench
[1:03:07] and when all the people saw it they fell
[1:03:09] down on their faces and they said
[1:03:12] the lord
[1:03:13] he is the god the lord he is the god
[1:03:19] amen a heavenly father lord we
[1:03:22] commit this evening into your hands
[1:03:25] lord jesus
[1:03:28] lord may you be the one heavenly father
[1:03:30] that receives glory
[1:03:32] lord from our time we've we've put aside
[1:03:35] for this service lord that
[1:03:37] we may be vessels heavenly father
[1:03:40] that you can work through this evening
[1:03:42] lord not just me lord jesus but each and
[1:03:46] every one of us here tonight
[1:03:49] lord god we love you with all of our
[1:03:50] hearts
[1:03:52] lord god we pray that you would just
[1:03:54] develop this thought lord
[1:03:56] into the manifestation lord of what you
[1:03:59] had
[1:04:00] predetermined it to be lord before the
[1:04:03] foundation of the world
[1:04:05] lord that we might know lord god that
[1:04:08] thou art the lord
[1:04:10] god in jesus christ's name we ask these
[1:04:14] things amen
[1:04:16] amen god bless you
[1:04:18] take your seats
[1:04:24] tonight i kind of feel like i'm being
[1:04:27] forced to go slow here but
[1:04:31] we'll um distrust in the lord tonight
[1:04:35] amen so
[1:04:36] we want to look at this thought here
[1:04:38] when the evening sacrifice is consumed
[1:04:42] by the fire
[1:04:44] of god
[1:04:46] and we understand
[1:04:48] that in romans 12 it tells us that we
[1:04:52] are to present our bodies as a
[1:04:54] as a living sacrifice and
[1:04:57] we understand that the evening time
[1:05:00] as we know it is the is the closing
[1:05:03] uh of the day to the gentiles
[1:05:06] just to give kind of bring you into a
[1:05:08] context here of
[1:05:10] what we're what we're talking about the
[1:05:11] evening time we understand that we're in
[1:05:14] the evening time now
[1:05:16] the closing of the day of grace to the
[1:05:19] gentiles
[1:05:21] so we we know that that we are there
[1:05:24] most most definitely
[1:05:27] and we want to kind of look at the
[1:05:28] conditions that
[1:05:30] israel found themselves in in first
[1:05:32] kings 18 here
[1:05:34] it's a it's a wonderful um thought
[1:05:38] that that the lord is as um once wants
[1:05:41] us just to pay a little bit attention to
[1:05:43] tonight
[1:05:44] and just to
[1:05:47] understand
[1:05:49] the importance
[1:05:50] of these things and these things are
[1:05:53] always
[1:05:54] always important
[1:05:56] so as we just want to go through this
[1:05:58] and just look at the conditions that
[1:06:01] we could say just to bring it into our
[1:06:03] context here at the time in which we
[1:06:05] live in that the
[1:06:07] religious world was in it at this time
[1:06:11] um we know this story very well
[1:06:15] and we understand that the people were
[1:06:18] at this time between between two
[1:06:20] decisions
[1:06:23] they they didn't know they were between
[1:06:25] opinions the bible says
[1:06:27] elijah came unto the people and said how
[1:06:30] long halt ye between two opinions
[1:06:34] so this was a very interesting time
[1:06:38] um a very interesting day that elijah
[1:06:41] was there and we understand
[1:06:43] by this that there was a elijah ministry
[1:06:47] at this time that was on earth
[1:06:50] but the question that elijah had was how
[1:06:53] long halt ye between two opinions
[1:06:56] very clearly here elijah wasn't one of
[1:06:59] those who had halted as the word says
[1:07:02] there in between two decisions
[1:07:05] elijah had a clear understanding of who
[1:07:08] the lord was but we understand that
[1:07:10] there was a question over who is the
[1:07:13] lord is is baal god or is the lord god
[1:07:16] and that that was the decision that they
[1:07:19] were caught in between
[1:07:21] interesting when you look at this word
[1:07:23] how long halty i've underlined it there
[1:07:27] when it means
[1:07:29] one of the if you look in the hebrew it
[1:07:32] means to be lame
[1:07:37] it's described in the hebrew to be
[1:07:40] someone who is lame
[1:07:43] and this is very interesting because
[1:07:46] if we can bring this into a context that
[1:07:48] we might understand it
[1:07:50] if you come to a t intersection
[1:07:54] and you don't know whether to turn right
[1:07:56] or turn left
[1:07:58] then you're lame
[1:08:00] you're not going to move
[1:08:02] all right because you're between two
[1:08:04] decisions
[1:08:06] all right and we know that
[1:08:08] our lives come to a place where we have
[1:08:10] to make a decision
[1:08:12] all right we there's there's there's
[1:08:14] really no middle of the road
[1:08:17] okay you've got to make a decision to go
[1:08:20] with the lord or not with the lord
[1:08:22] you've got to go one way or another so
[1:08:26] it was interesting here that god's
[1:08:28] people
[1:08:29] had had stopped moving forward
[1:08:32] they had stopped possessing
[1:08:35] what was theirs and just understand me
[1:08:38] tonight that i'm just going to build a
[1:08:40] bit of a foundation so we can get a bit
[1:08:43] of an idea
[1:08:44] of the the main thrust the main thought
[1:08:47] behind the service tonight
[1:08:49] but they had had stopped
[1:08:51] possessing
[1:08:52] what was theirs it's not that they were
[1:08:54] bad people they were just caught in a
[1:08:57] place
[1:08:58] they were caught in a position it wasn't
[1:09:01] their heart's desire to be in that place
[1:09:04] but they found themselves in that place
[1:09:07] i i believe that god's people want to
[1:09:10] know who god is
[1:09:12] and i believe that the reason they want
[1:09:15] to know that is because god wants them
[1:09:17] to know that they god wants them to know
[1:09:20] him and that's why we have a desire to
[1:09:23] know him is because he wants us to know
[1:09:27] him as he is known
[1:09:30] so it wasn't that they were bad people
[1:09:32] it wasn't that that um
[1:09:35] it was their heart's desire to know who
[1:09:38] god was but we understand that every
[1:09:41] time god wants us to move in a direction
[1:09:45] we need to be led by the spirit of god
[1:09:49] sons and daughters of god are they that
[1:09:51] are led by the spirit of god
[1:09:55] amen so god's people became lame
[1:09:58] so what israel needed was a healer
[1:10:04] amen we don't think of healing in this
[1:10:05] way very often but what god's people
[1:10:08] needed was a healer
[1:10:11] because
[1:10:12] that's what he came to do
[1:10:14] he came to heal the lame
[1:10:16] but not very often do we put that word
[1:10:19] lame in a place where it's a we're in a
[1:10:22] place between decisions
[1:10:26] in that place it's a dangerous place
[1:10:29] because in that place
[1:10:31] people decay very quickly
[1:10:36] your your christian walk becomes
[1:10:39] less of a christian walk church
[1:10:41] attendance becomes
[1:10:43] less your commitment to the lord becomes
[1:10:46] less because you're you're in that place
[1:10:49] where you're in no man's land you're
[1:10:52] you're neither here and you're neither
[1:10:54] there you know and we we understand the
[1:10:57] message to the lady i see in church ages
[1:10:59] that god hates lukewarmness but but
[1:11:03] sometimes those who are lukewarm they
[1:11:06] don't desire to be lukewarm
[1:11:08] they want to be hot for god
[1:11:10] amen if they want to be cold they would
[1:11:13] already be cold
[1:11:15] all right but but we're not
[1:11:17] people who are lukewarm i was there
[1:11:20] are not bad people
[1:11:23] they're just in a place of indecision
[1:11:26] and they need god to do something in
[1:11:28] their lives
[1:11:30] so that they can move forward
[1:11:34] amen and this is what i believe that we
[1:11:38] are in that place now
[1:11:40] where god wants us to move forward i'm
[1:11:42] not saying you're lukewarm i'm not
[1:11:44] saying that i'm lukewarm but what i'm
[1:11:47] saying is that god
[1:11:49] from here we are to go to a millennial
[1:11:53] supper
[1:11:54] a wedding supper
[1:11:57] amen and and there's something that's
[1:12:00] going to happen
[1:12:02] in order for us to move from where we
[1:12:05] are now
[1:12:07] to that wedding supper
[1:12:08] the same thing here where israel found
[1:12:11] themselves in in order for them to find
[1:12:13] themselves moving forward god had to do
[1:12:17] something
[1:12:18] and what that did is that allowed them
[1:12:20] to live the next day
[1:12:23] different to this day that they were
[1:12:25] living in and i don't know about you but
[1:12:27] i'm looking forward to the body change
[1:12:30] amen because it's going to allow me to
[1:12:32] live that day different to what this day
[1:12:36] is
[1:12:37] amen amen
[1:12:39] so we we're
[1:12:40] we want
[1:12:41] we want
[1:12:43] to take from this story just to be able
[1:12:45] to help us
[1:12:47] along life's way
[1:12:52] israel had got into kind of a rut where
[1:12:55] you know it was the same stuff on a
[1:12:57] different day
[1:12:59] you know
[1:13:00] monday and tuesday yeah it was a
[1:13:02] different day but what they did tuesday
[1:13:04] they did the same thing monday
[1:13:06] it was the same stuff a different day
[1:13:10] amen and and i believe that that's not
[1:13:13] how god wants us to operate
[1:13:16] god wants every day to be a new day this
[1:13:19] is the day that the lord has made
[1:13:21] let us be glad and rejoice in it
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:25] so god's desire for us is to be
[1:13:28] continually
[1:13:29] moving forward god's desire for israel
[1:13:33] was to be continually moving forward but
[1:13:36] the thing that was stopping them from
[1:13:39] moving forward was
[1:13:42] who was the lord there was a revelation
[1:13:45] needed
[1:13:48] and god is the revealer of himself
[1:13:53] so there was only one person
[1:13:56] who could move israel from the position
[1:13:59] they were in
[1:14:01] and move them forward and that was the
[1:14:04] lord because he is the revealer of
[1:14:07] himself
[1:14:09] and the the when i say that there was a
[1:14:11] revelation needed there was a revelation
[1:14:14] of god needed
[1:14:16] we'll bring it into our day there was a
[1:14:18] revelation of jesus christ needed
[1:14:23] otherwise
[1:14:25] if god doesn't do it
[1:14:28] for us
[1:14:30] then our lives take on this crazy cycle
[1:14:34] where things just constantly
[1:14:37] repeat themselves repeat themselves
[1:14:40] repeat themselves
[1:14:43] but god doesn't want our lives to repeat
[1:14:45] day after day after day
[1:14:49] god wants us to be growing in him
[1:14:52] amen god wants us to be possessing his
[1:14:55] promises
[1:14:57] amen god gave you promises for your
[1:15:00] earthly journey
[1:15:03] when you're in that millennial reign you
[1:15:06] there are promises that pertain to that
[1:15:08] but you won't be able to come back and
[1:15:11] and and
[1:15:12] and possess the promises that god gave
[1:15:14] you here
[1:15:16] we are to possess the promises here
[1:15:20] amen we are to possess the land here
[1:15:26] continually
[1:15:29] continually constantly
[1:15:31] possessing
[1:15:33] the things that god has promised for us
[1:15:40] so what we find here is that israel was
[1:15:42] in a position that unless god
[1:15:46] did something
[1:15:47] that could they could not move
[1:15:50] forward
[1:15:52] god was going to have to bring a healing
[1:15:56] to israel
[1:15:58] and that healing was going to come
[1:16:01] through
[1:16:02] the rev the revelation
[1:16:05] of the lord
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] if they had the revelation of the lord
[1:16:12] that be moving forward but the fact was
[1:16:14] that they did not have the revelation of
[1:16:17] who the lord was because balaam had and
[1:16:21] his false prophets had crept in and
[1:16:23] started sowing their own seed and got
[1:16:25] the people mixed up in a in a in a bit
[1:16:28] of a a mixed up state in their mind but
[1:16:32] god is obligated to his people so god
[1:16:35] was going to come down and heal his
[1:16:37] people
[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:41] in psalm 103 it says bless the lord on
[1:16:44] my soul all my soul and all that is
[1:16:47] within me bless his holy name bless the
[1:16:50] lord all my soul and forget not all his
[1:16:54] benefits
[1:16:56] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[1:16:59] healeth all thy diseases
[1:17:03] amen who redeemeth thy life from
[1:17:06] destruction hallelujah who crowneth thee
[1:17:10] with lovingkindness
[1:17:12] and tender mercy if god was not going to
[1:17:15] come on the scene here then the israel
[1:17:18] would have fell into destruction but god
[1:17:20] was going to redeem their life from
[1:17:24] destruction
[1:17:25] hallelujah amen he was going to heal
[1:17:29] their disease
[1:17:31] he was going to heal their their their
[1:17:34] lameness he was going to heal because
[1:17:36] god is the healer of of all
[1:17:43] this left no room for anyone else
[1:17:47] oh
[1:17:49] sorry
[1:17:52] i bumped it
[1:17:54] all thy
[1:17:56] diseases amen so this meant that only
[1:18:00] there was only one one god
[1:18:03] who could
[1:18:04] who could cause the people
[1:18:08] to move forward from where they were and
[1:18:11] yet they were in a place where they were
[1:18:14] tossing up
[1:18:15] who was lord and who wasn't lord
[1:18:18] amen so god was going to god was going
[1:18:22] to reveal himself and in his ability to
[1:18:26] reveal himself he was going to heal
[1:18:30] israel and allow them to move into the
[1:18:33] next day that god had ordained them to
[1:18:37] move into
[1:18:39] israel could not heal themselves
[1:18:43] no doubt they'd tried
[1:18:46] but like the woman who tried so many
[1:18:48] physicians you know
[1:18:53] there was no one else could that could
[1:18:55] heal him they could not be
[1:18:57] self-healed
[1:19:00] and he's the same today
[1:19:05] he is the healer
[1:19:07] he is the one that causes us to move
[1:19:10] forward
[1:19:12] perhaps we're being a a little bit
[1:19:14] stagnant perhaps a little bit lukewarm
[1:19:17] perhaps we're in that place of
[1:19:20] indecision my prayer for you tonight is
[1:19:22] that god would do something in your life
[1:19:25] that causes you to move forward so that
[1:19:28] tomorrow cannot be a repeat of today but
[1:19:32] you can move forward and possess
[1:19:34] the enemy's gate
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:38] this is our desire
[1:19:40] this is god's desire
[1:19:43] for you
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:51] let's just read a little bit here
[1:19:54] first kings we've we've read this verse
[1:19:56] here
[1:19:57] am i going the wrong way sorry i'm going
[1:19:59] the wrong way
[1:20:01] we want to go the right direction amen
[1:20:05] amen
[1:20:08] first kings 18 21
[1:20:11] and elijah came unto all the people and
[1:20:14] said how long halt ye between two
[1:20:16] opinions if the lord be god follow him
[1:20:21] but if baal then follow him
[1:20:24] and the people answered him
[1:20:27] not a word
[1:20:30] let them therefore this is elijah
[1:20:32] speaking
[1:20:34] give us two
[1:20:35] bullocks
[1:20:38] and let them choose one bullock for
[1:20:40] themselves and cut it in pieces and lay
[1:20:42] it on the wood and put no fire under
[1:20:46] and i will dress the other bullet and
[1:20:49] lay it on the wood and put no fire under
[1:20:53] and call ye on the name of your gods
[1:20:57] i like that huh call ye on the name of
[1:21:01] your gods
[1:21:03] and i
[1:21:04] i will call on the name of the lord
[1:21:08] [Laughter]
[1:21:10] i like that amen and the god that
[1:21:13] answereth by fire let him be god
[1:21:17] all and all the people answered and said
[1:21:21] it is well spoken
[1:21:24] so we see here that elijah under the
[1:21:26] inspiration of the almighty is is is
[1:21:31] bringing a bit of a a showdown a
[1:21:33] challenge to the people
[1:21:36] not in a way that he wanted to belittle
[1:21:39] the people
[1:21:40] not in a way that he wanted to belittle
[1:21:42] israel but he did want to identify the
[1:21:46] false god that was in their midst
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:51] he wanted to identify the false god well
[1:21:54] let's say it another way he wanted to
[1:21:56] identify the true god and when you
[1:21:59] identify the true god then you can
[1:22:02] automatically identify the false god
[1:22:05] amen so this was the challenge to the
[1:22:08] people
[1:22:09] god um elijah wasn't belittling israel
[1:22:13] but elijah wanted israel to move forward
[1:22:17] in their walk with the lord and possess
[1:22:20] what was theirs amen so so god was going
[1:22:25] to do their healing
[1:22:27] by coming down in the form of a
[1:22:30] consuming fire
[1:22:35] amen god was going to reveal himself
[1:22:39] through an elijah ministry and how he
[1:22:41] was going to reveal himself was that he
[1:22:44] was going to be in the form of a
[1:22:46] consuming fire
[1:22:50] amen our god is a
[1:22:52] consuming fire
[1:22:55] amen so god was going to come down and
[1:22:58] reveal himself and in revealing himself
[1:23:02] he was going to bring a healing to the
[1:23:04] people he was gonna he was gonna heal
[1:23:08] their lame bodies and cause them to move
[1:23:10] forward
[1:23:13] again this is very interesting and i
[1:23:15] need to make this statement very clear
[1:23:18] and that is that elijah knew
[1:23:20] who god was elijah knew who god who was
[1:23:24] god and who wasn't god
[1:23:27] so he wasn't doing this for himself
[1:23:31] amen elijah had a had had a contact with
[1:23:35] god himself he he knew who god was it
[1:23:38] was the people who were blinded to the
[1:23:41] to who god was
[1:23:43] amen he had a revelation of who god was
[1:23:46] so in theory what elijah could have done
[1:23:50] was elijah could have just said the lord
[1:23:54] he is god
[1:23:57] couldn't he
[1:23:58] because he knew who allah who knew who
[1:24:01] god was
[1:24:03] so elijah could have just said to israel
[1:24:06] know ye not that the lord he is god
[1:24:10] or he could have said thus saith the
[1:24:12] lord the lord he is god
[1:24:17] is that right he could have done it
[1:24:19] because he knew who god was
[1:24:24] but god wanted the people to have an
[1:24:26] experience
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:31] god wanted the people to have a personal
[1:24:34] testimony
[1:24:36] god wanted the people to have a personal
[1:24:39] revelation of who he was
[1:24:42] and not just work walk forward in saying
[1:24:45] elijah said he is god god wanted the
[1:24:49] people to have a personal testimony of
[1:24:52] who he was
[1:24:55] i believe jesus christ is the same
[1:24:57] yesterday today and forever and i
[1:24:59] believe that he wants you to have that
[1:25:01] same thing tonight
[1:25:02] amen not just because the prophet said
[1:25:05] but god wants you to have a revelation
[1:25:07] god wants you to have an
[1:25:10] experience amen
[1:25:12] of who he is
[1:25:16] he wants to be more
[1:25:18] than someone you speak about
[1:25:23] through the experience of someone else
[1:25:31] he wants you
[1:25:32] to experience him personally
[1:25:41] it's beautiful
[1:25:43] to think of how personal god wants to be
[1:25:45] with us
[1:25:52] i thank god that he can be that personal
[1:25:55] i think i thank him that he wants to be
[1:25:58] that personal with me
[1:26:01] he doesn't want to be he doesn't want a
[1:26:03] relationship with me because i read
[1:26:05] something about him on a poster
[1:26:08] or i heard a song that someone said and
[1:26:12] my god is awesome
[1:26:14] he can move mountains well that's
[1:26:15] wonderful but god wants more than that
[1:26:19] god wants to exp us to experience
[1:26:22] his awesomeness
[1:26:24] and his power
[1:26:34] the experience
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:42] god was going to give israel
[1:26:45] was going to come through
[1:26:48] an elijah ministry
[1:26:53] because god does nothing but he reveals
[1:26:55] it to his prophets
[1:26:57] first
[1:26:58] so the experience that israel was going
[1:27:01] to
[1:27:02] to be a part of was going to come
[1:27:05] through
[1:27:06] an elijah ministry
[1:27:12] but the experience was for all of israel
[1:27:17] and not just elijah
[1:27:21] okay what elijah experienced
[1:27:25] was not was it was not just for elijah
[1:27:29] god wanted
[1:27:30] israel to have the same experience as
[1:27:32] elijah
[1:27:35] amen
[1:27:36] and we bring that into our day and and
[1:27:39] our elijah we get these funny ideas that
[1:27:42] that
[1:27:43] that god doesn't want us to have the
[1:27:45] same experience
[1:27:48] that our elijah did but i beg to differ
[1:27:52] yeah i'm not a prophet
[1:27:56] i'm in the office of a pastor i'm a
[1:27:58] father i'm a i'm a husband
[1:28:01] i'm a son
[1:28:03] but in the in the office that i hold god
[1:28:06] wants
[1:28:07] me
[1:28:08] to experience him so that uh that he so
[1:28:11] that he is as real to me as what he was
[1:28:15] to the prophet
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:18] the prophet could stand in a service
[1:28:20] and and and be so sensitive to the holy
[1:28:23] spirit he say he is here
[1:28:26] i mean god wants a personal relationship
[1:28:29] with each and every one of us amen god
[1:28:33] wants
[1:28:34] god wants me to experience him
[1:28:39] so that he is
[1:28:40] as real
[1:28:43] in my life as what he was in the
[1:28:45] prophet's life yes i'm not a prophet
[1:28:49] don't expect me to to to see visions etc
[1:28:52] etc but in the place that i stand in the
[1:28:56] office that i hold god wants me to
[1:28:59] experience him god wants to be real to
[1:29:01] me
[1:29:02] amen god wants to be real to you
[1:29:05] amen god wants to be tangible
[1:29:08] amen god wants to god wants you to know
[1:29:11] that he's here
[1:29:13] amen god doesn't want you to be
[1:29:15] wondering if he's here god wants you to
[1:29:18] know if he's here
[1:29:21] he wants you to know that he's here
[1:29:24] amen it's an experience it's something
[1:29:28] that that that god wants
[1:29:30] for you and i
[1:29:32] i'm so thankful that he that he wants
[1:29:34] that for me amen
[1:29:36] amen i feel humbled
[1:29:40] i feel humbled
[1:29:42] to to to understand that he wants me to
[1:29:45] have
[1:29:46] this experience
[1:29:50] so we we come now to a time
[1:29:54] when the prophets of baal
[1:29:56] prepared their sacrifice
[1:29:59] as elijah had instructed them
[1:30:03] they we we know the story they danced
[1:30:05] they sung they shouted
[1:30:08] elijah teased them a bit maybe he's gone
[1:30:10] on vacation maybe he's fallen asleep
[1:30:12] maybe he's on the phone you know what i
[1:30:14] mean
[1:30:15] maybe he's busy you know
[1:30:17] um and they cut themselves and and blood
[1:30:21] was pouring out and
[1:30:23] not nothing happens
[1:30:26] and it came to pass when midday was
[1:30:28] passed
[1:30:29] and they prophesied
[1:30:32] until the time of the offering of the
[1:30:35] evening time
[1:30:37] of the evening sacrifice that there was
[1:30:40] neither voice
[1:30:41] nor any to answer
[1:30:44] nor any
[1:30:45] that
[1:30:46] regarded okay so there was just nothing
[1:30:50] it was just a lot of noise
[1:30:52] there was just a lot of noise with with
[1:30:55] with no presence of the lord amen
[1:30:58] despite their efforts despite everything
[1:31:01] that they did and elijah i can just
[1:31:05] imagine what elijah must have been
[1:31:06] thinking as he was as he was watching
[1:31:10] and we noticed that not at any time that
[1:31:13] elijah step in and say hey enough's
[1:31:15] enough but he let him go and he let him
[1:31:18] go and he let him go until that had
[1:31:21] enough
[1:31:24] okay and and now
[1:31:26] it was it was elijah's
[1:31:29] time
[1:31:32] and elijah said unto all the people come
[1:31:35] near unto me
[1:31:37] you know you'll always know when you're
[1:31:39] in contact with an elijah ministry
[1:31:42] because there's a certain confidence
[1:31:45] that comes with it
[1:31:47] so elijah says come near unto me
[1:31:50] and all the people came near unto him
[1:31:54] now remember here that it wasn't just
[1:31:57] israel but it was also the false
[1:31:59] prophets etc etc he called them all in
[1:32:03] he called them all in and said come near
[1:32:05] unto me and all the people
[1:32:07] came near unto him and he prepared the
[1:32:10] altar of the lord that was broken down
[1:32:13] and elijah took 12 stones according to
[1:32:16] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:32:19] jacob unto whom the word of the lord
[1:32:23] came
[1:32:24] saying israel shall be thy name
[1:32:29] and with the stones he built an altar
[1:32:32] this is interesting i'll just throw this
[1:32:34] in here you can see up in the background
[1:32:36] the top right corner there that there's
[1:32:38] another alter
[1:32:39] the theologians that the the people who
[1:32:41] do the concordance on the bible said
[1:32:43] elijah didn't use
[1:32:46] the the the same sacrifice or the same
[1:32:49] altar he built a new altar
[1:32:53] because the altar represents the word
[1:32:57] right so god was not going to come down
[1:32:59] on a false word god was only going to
[1:33:02] come down on his word
[1:33:04] amen
[1:33:07] verse 33 and he put the wood in order
[1:33:10] and cut the bullock in pieces and laid
[1:33:13] him on the wood and said
[1:33:16] fill four barrels with water and pour it
[1:33:19] on the burnt sacrifice
[1:33:22] and on the wood
[1:33:24] and he said do it
[1:33:26] the second time and they did it the
[1:33:29] second time and he said do it the third
[1:33:32] time and he did it the third time they
[1:33:34] did it the third time and the water ran
[1:33:37] about the altar
[1:33:39] and filled the trench also
[1:33:43] with water
[1:33:46] and it came to pass that the
[1:33:48] at the time of the offering
[1:33:51] of their evening
[1:33:54] sacrifice
[1:33:56] so it was the evening time
[1:34:00] that a revelation was going to come
[1:34:03] forth
[1:34:05] god was going to come down
[1:34:08] amen
[1:34:09] god was going to come down
[1:34:12] amen the the dove
[1:34:15] was going to come down
[1:34:17] amen was going to come down
[1:34:19] at the when the evening time let's bring
[1:34:22] that into our day in the closing of the
[1:34:25] dispensation of grace to the gentiles in
[1:34:28] the evening time the dove was going to
[1:34:31] come down again the seventh seal was
[1:34:33] going to come down again
[1:34:35] amen the the the fire of god god the
[1:34:38] consuming fire was going to come down
[1:34:40] again he wasn't going to send someone
[1:34:43] else our god is a consuming fire he was
[1:34:46] going to come down himself and vindicate
[1:34:49] who he was
[1:34:52] oh my it was the evening time
[1:34:56] this is why elijah had to let him go
[1:35:00] at nine o'clock he said hey you got six
[1:35:02] hours to go yet
[1:35:06] at midday he said hey you got three
[1:35:08] hours to go yet
[1:35:10] because evening time starts they say
[1:35:11] around around three o'clock
[1:35:15] whatever it is
[1:35:18] but
[1:35:19] they had to stop
[1:35:22] at the evening time
[1:35:24] because the evening time is god's time
[1:35:30] the prophet would say god would come
[1:35:31] down and speak to abra
[1:35:34] um
[1:35:34] sir
[1:35:36] adam and eve in the evening time is
[1:35:39] god's vindication time
[1:35:42] it was the evening time
[1:35:45] let's move forward
[1:35:47] that elijah the prophet came near and
[1:35:49] said lord god of abraham
[1:35:53] isaac and of israel
[1:35:55] let it be known this day notice here
[1:35:58] that there's three reasons
[1:36:00] for this
[1:36:01] number one is
[1:36:03] that
[1:36:04] that thou art god
[1:36:07] in
[1:36:08] israel
[1:36:10] not god of israel
[1:36:14] god in israel
[1:36:16] there's a big difference
[1:36:19] god not god of israel
[1:36:22] god is israel so now think about this in
[1:36:24] the context they're in between two
[1:36:26] opinions
[1:36:27] the the the reason that they couldn't
[1:36:30] decide who was god was not because god
[1:36:33] wasn't there
[1:36:37] god was there but they didn't know god
[1:36:42] because he elijah was saying here that
[1:36:44] thou art god in israel
[1:36:48] not god of israel even though he was god
[1:36:50] of israel but the god of israel was in
[1:36:53] israel and he was unidentified
[1:36:59] my
[1:37:03] and that i am thy servant
[1:37:07] and that i have done all
[1:37:10] these
[1:37:11] things
[1:37:12] at
[1:37:13] thy
[1:37:14] word
[1:37:17] really
[1:37:18] important verse here because we want to
[1:37:20] concentrate on that last part there for
[1:37:23] a little bit that i have done all these
[1:37:25] things
[1:37:29] at thy word
[1:37:33] what this means is
[1:37:37] that when
[1:37:39] elijah asked
[1:37:43] for the four barrels of water
[1:37:48] it wasn't his idea
[1:37:58] it was god's idea
[1:38:00] why because i have done all
[1:38:03] all these things at thy word not at my
[1:38:06] word not according to my idea but at thy
[1:38:09] word i have done these things
[1:38:15] so the four barrels of water that elijah
[1:38:17] asked for
[1:38:19] were
[1:38:21] were
[1:38:22] inspired it was god who inspired elijah
[1:38:26] to do these things
[1:38:29] and then he asked it for the second time
[1:38:32] and then he asked for the third time so
[1:38:34] three times elijah god had revealed to
[1:38:38] elijah to get four barrels fill those
[1:38:41] four barrels with water and bring them
[1:38:43] up and pour them over the altar we're
[1:38:46] under we see that the
[1:38:48] in the picture there i think i've got a
[1:38:50] blown up version here
[1:38:51] that had that they're pouring the water
[1:38:54] over the altar
[1:38:58] you know things that god revealed to
[1:39:00] elijah didn't always make a lot of sense
[1:39:07] at least not to the human mind
[1:39:11] people didn't understand why elijah was
[1:39:14] doing what he was doing but brother and
[1:39:16] sister we understand if god inspired
[1:39:19] elijah to do it there had to be a
[1:39:21] purpose
[1:39:23] there had to be a reason even though
[1:39:25] people don't understand it and perhaps
[1:39:27] if we were standing there at that time
[1:39:30] we we couldn't we we would struggle to
[1:39:32] understand why would elijah be doing
[1:39:35] this why is elijah doing this i i don't
[1:39:39] understand why elijah is doing what he
[1:39:42] is doing but i understand who elijah is
[1:39:46] elijah is an inspired man and elijah has
[1:39:49] contact with god and he hears things
[1:39:52] from god that i don't hear so i'm just
[1:39:54] going to have to have confidence in
[1:39:56] elijah that god is inspiring him
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:04] and that's the way sometimes
[1:40:08] god works with us
[1:40:11] through our elijah ministry he asks us
[1:40:13] not to do certain things
[1:40:15] he asks us to do certain things
[1:40:18] and sometimes we don't know why he asks
[1:40:21] us
[1:40:21] to do certain things and not to do
[1:40:24] certain things but if we have a
[1:40:26] revelation of elijah we'll understand
[1:40:28] this man is god-led
[1:40:30] if he's hell if he's telling us
[1:40:32] something standing in his in the
[1:40:34] position that he is then it's best just
[1:40:37] to listen and to do what he is asking us
[1:40:40] to do and wait for the revelation to
[1:40:44] come a little bit later on
[1:40:46] even in the foot washing service jesus
[1:40:48] said you know not what you do now but
[1:40:50] you'll know hereafter just follow just
[1:40:53] just do what i say for now the
[1:40:55] revelation will come
[1:40:58] amen obedience to the word
[1:41:01] amen and perhaps even in elijah in
[1:41:04] elijah's mind
[1:41:05] he was questioned not questioning but he
[1:41:08] was saying
[1:41:09] as he was asking for the water perhaps
[1:41:11] he didn't really understand perhaps he
[1:41:13] didn't understand what the purpose was
[1:41:16] behind it but elijah was obedient
[1:41:19] elijah was obedient because elijah knew
[1:41:22] that god that i'm hearing tell me do
[1:41:24] these things he can't fail
[1:41:27] amen so he was doing things just by
[1:41:30] obedience to the word
[1:41:37] elijah
[1:41:41] prepares the sacrifice
[1:41:48] elijah
[1:41:50] prepares
[1:41:52] the sacrifice i'll say that another way
[1:41:54] the sacrifice becomes prepared through
[1:41:57] an elijah ministry
[1:42:01] the sacrifice
[1:42:04] becomes prepared
[1:42:06] through
[1:42:07] an elijah ministry
[1:42:12] remember romans
[1:42:14] 12
[1:42:16] offer your bodies as a
[1:42:19] living
[1:42:21] sacrifice
[1:42:23] the sacrifice
[1:42:25] becomes
[1:42:26] prepared through
[1:42:29] an elijah ministry
[1:42:32] was elijah the only one preparing
[1:42:36] the sacrifice
[1:42:39] no
[1:42:41] no
[1:42:42] elijah had helpers
[1:42:46] there were other ministries
[1:42:50] that were going to be involved
[1:42:54] in the preparing
[1:42:57] of the sacrifice
[1:43:00] and those ministries were effect are
[1:43:03] effective and they were and are
[1:43:05] effective
[1:43:07] because of their obedience to the elijah
[1:43:10] ministry
[1:43:13] if one of them had a comeback with wine
[1:43:16] instead of water elijah was standing
[1:43:19] there as the judge
[1:43:22] of what they were pouring over the altar
[1:43:25] because god had asked for water
[1:43:30] not wine he'd asked for water
[1:43:33] so elijah was standing there
[1:43:36] making sure that the water that it was
[1:43:40] water
[1:43:41] and not any anybody nobody had lent to
[1:43:45] their own understanding
[1:43:49] and bringing something that wasn't
[1:43:52] according to god's mind
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:59] now it's interesting here
[1:44:02] because
[1:44:04] when the prophets of baal
[1:44:07] prepared their sacrifice
[1:44:10] they never did this
[1:44:13] and nor did elijah instruct them to
[1:44:18] they just did what elijah said
[1:44:23] and they did what they thought was
[1:44:25] necessary
[1:44:28] to bring god down
[1:44:31] and that was really
[1:44:33] self-afflicting themselves
[1:44:36] whipping themselves cutting themselves
[1:44:40] singing but
[1:44:42] singing their own version
[1:44:45] of our lords is perfect or something you
[1:44:47] know
[1:44:49] but elijah was
[1:44:52] do what elijah did he did all things
[1:44:57] at god's word
[1:45:01] so what this means is that elijah was
[1:45:04] given by god a revelation of the
[1:45:07] sacrifice
[1:45:11] elijah was given a revelation of the
[1:45:14] sacrifice
[1:45:17] amen
[1:45:19] amen
[1:45:20] because everything that elijah did
[1:45:23] he did according to god's word
[1:45:26] so what this sacrifice was was the word
[1:45:29] of god expressed yes
[1:45:32] it was the word of god manifested
[1:45:35] amen it was god's thoughts now tangible
[1:45:40] if you wanted to know the mind of god
[1:45:42] you could look at the sacrifice and say
[1:45:44] that is the mind of god revealed
[1:45:50] elijah had a revelation
[1:45:53] elijah was given a revelation of the
[1:45:56] evening sacrifice
[1:46:04] oh my
[1:46:06] so god could only come down
[1:46:09] when elijah had done everything
[1:46:12] that he was asked to do
[1:46:16] because if elijah said well
[1:46:18] you know
[1:46:20] water on the sacrifice
[1:46:23] no
[1:46:25] no think about how sure elijah was of
[1:46:28] god's voice
[1:46:30] oh my
[1:46:32] elijah was so sure that that was god's
[1:46:35] voice telling him to put water over the
[1:46:38] sacrifice that he put water over a
[1:46:40] sacrifice that god was going to prove
[1:46:43] himself by fire
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:48] it makes no sense
[1:46:53] but god could only come down
[1:46:57] upon his own revelation
[1:47:00] expressed
[1:47:04] amen
[1:47:05] this is going to kind of be the theme of
[1:47:07] the of the
[1:47:09] of the next couple of services
[1:47:11] god could only come down upon
[1:47:14] his mind
[1:47:16] expressed
[1:47:19] now there was no guessing
[1:47:23] now if we were standing there
[1:47:27] we could look at this sacrifice
[1:47:30] say this is the mind of god
[1:47:33] expressed
[1:47:37] this is god's thoughts god
[1:47:39] god's thoughts expressed
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:46] and i want to just emphasize this that
[1:47:49] god
[1:47:51] could only come down
[1:47:54] upon his own revelation
[1:48:00] god will not anoint your revelation
[1:48:05] god will not anoint my revelation
[1:48:09] the devil can anoint his revelation
[1:48:13] his own
[1:48:15] but god will only come down
[1:48:19] the dove will only come down
[1:48:22] upon the pure word
[1:48:26] upon the mind of god expressed
[1:48:31] will the dove come down
[1:48:35] the sacrifice
[1:48:37] was a revelation
[1:48:40] to elijah
[1:48:44] now our elijah
[1:48:48] was
[1:48:49] going to get a revelation of the evening
[1:48:53] sacrifice
[1:49:00] present your bodies a
[1:49:02] living sacrifice
[1:49:05] when in the evening time
[1:49:08] in the closing of the dispensation of
[1:49:10] grace to the gentiles there will be an
[1:49:13] evening sacrifice
[1:49:22] god was going to prove to his people
[1:49:26] that the revelation given to elijah
[1:49:30] was not elijah's
[1:49:39] god was going to prove to the people
[1:49:42] that the revelation that elijah had of
[1:49:45] the sacrifice
[1:49:47] was the lord's revelation
[1:49:52] not elijah's
[1:49:55] it was god's revelation god's revelation
[1:49:58] all elijah was doing was expressing what
[1:50:01] god had revealed to him
[1:50:07] it was god's own revelation
[1:50:10] given to elijah
[1:50:14] so what we have read in the scriptures
[1:50:17] is that we are to present our bodies as
[1:50:19] a living sacrifice
[1:50:21] but the
[1:50:22] sacrifice must be a revelation to us
[1:50:28] because this the revelation that was
[1:50:31] given to elijah was now given to the
[1:50:34] people
[1:50:37] a lot the elijah ministry never never
[1:50:40] never never made the people dependent
[1:50:43] upon the man
[1:50:45] but the revelation was given to the
[1:50:48] predestinated seeds of god
[1:50:51] amen so the revelation that was given to
[1:50:54] elijah here in this picture was now
[1:50:56] going to be given to god's people that
[1:50:59] this is the evening sacrifice this is
[1:51:02] the mind of god expressed
[1:51:06] and it's the same in our day that the
[1:51:08] revelation of the evening sacrifice that
[1:51:12] god is going to have in this end time
[1:51:15] if it's not just bottled up in one man
[1:51:18] that revelation has gone out to a people
[1:51:21] of the sacrifice
[1:51:23] now we're not looking at a sacrifice you
[1:51:26] are the sacrifice
[1:51:36] let's look at this
[1:51:40] the god that answereth by fire
[1:51:43] let him be god
[1:51:47] fire
[1:51:48] water
[1:51:52] fire
[1:51:54] water
[1:51:55] in my experience as a boy
[1:51:58] you use water to put fire out
[1:52:03] and yet god instructed elijah
[1:52:08] to pour water over a sacrifice
[1:52:14] that god was going to prove himself to
[1:52:16] be god by consuming that sacrifice with
[1:52:19] water with fire
[1:52:22] but now there was there was there was so
[1:52:24] much water
[1:52:27] on the sacrifice that it had filled the
[1:52:30] trench
[1:52:32] that elijah had dug
[1:52:35] around the altar
[1:52:38] there was water in the in the bullock
[1:52:42] the timber was wet
[1:52:44] the stones were wet
[1:52:47] 12 barrels of water had been poured over
[1:52:51] a sacrifice
[1:52:52] that god was going to prove himself by
[1:52:56] to be god
[1:52:58] someone explain it
[1:53:03] but this is god's idea
[1:53:07] not elijah's idea this is god's idea
[1:53:13] it's hard to burn wet wood
[1:53:17] it's hard to burn
[1:53:18] wet rocks
[1:53:21] it's hard to burn water
[1:53:29] in the minds of the people
[1:53:31] elijah had gone too far
[1:53:39] the people questioned the man's mental
[1:53:42] state
[1:53:46] why would you pour water over a
[1:53:48] sacrifice that you intend to prove god
[1:53:51] by
[1:53:57] there were pools of water on the altar
[1:53:59] there were pools of water in the beast
[1:54:01] there were pools of water everywhere why
[1:54:04] why why would you do this
[1:54:08] elijah
[1:54:09] why would you why would you
[1:54:12] why are you doing this
[1:54:19] why are you doing this when you're going
[1:54:22] to prove who is god
[1:54:24] by a fire coming down and consuming a
[1:54:27] sacrifice
[1:54:28] when you've just totally covered it and
[1:54:31] saturated it in water why are you doing
[1:54:34] this perhaps some decided to walk home
[1:54:40] perhaps there were some who become
[1:54:42] discouraged by the acts
[1:54:44] of elijah
[1:54:47] perhaps there were some who didn't want
[1:54:49] to be a part of the embarrassment
[1:54:51] that would come
[1:54:53] as a result of the failure of the elijah
[1:54:57] ministry
[1:54:59] and there was
[1:55:01] then there were some who just stayed
[1:55:04] watching to see what was going to happen
[1:55:08] perhaps there were some who were
[1:55:10] thinking back at their own experience
[1:55:14] of trying to start a fire with wet wood
[1:55:18] because fire was a major part in their
[1:55:20] in in their economy
[1:55:23] and they they knew
[1:55:24] that
[1:55:26] it's hard
[1:55:27] to start a fire with wet wood
[1:55:32] so they were kind of thinking on a
[1:55:34] carnal level that
[1:55:36] um i i just can't see
[1:55:39] how this is gonna work
[1:55:42] i can't understand how
[1:55:45] this is going to work
[1:55:48] and yet
[1:55:49] a lot everything elijah had done he had
[1:55:52] done at god's word
[1:55:55] just because we don't understand what
[1:55:57] elijah done doesn't mean it's not
[1:56:00] according to god's word
[1:56:06] by all accounts
[1:56:08] this fire should not have started
[1:56:13] according to my experience with fire
[1:56:17] this fire
[1:56:18] should not have started
[1:56:20] but we know
[1:56:21] that it did
[1:56:25] proving to
[1:56:26] us
[1:56:28] that god can do what you can't
[1:56:36] what is impossible for man is possible
[1:56:40] for
[1:56:40] god amen and the sacrifice on a on a man
[1:56:45] level it was impossible
[1:56:48] but when god looked at this sacrifice
[1:56:53] after elijah had done everything he was
[1:56:56] called to do
[1:56:58] and it sat there in its saturated state
[1:57:02] god said it is perfect
[1:57:06] it's exactly the way i wanted it
[1:57:10] well done my faithful servant
[1:57:19] god is not limited by physics
[1:57:25] god is not limited by education
[1:57:30] god is not limited by statistics
[1:57:35] and god is not limited by wet wood
[1:57:39] and god is not limited in power
[1:57:46] what was
[1:57:48] causing
[1:57:50] the people
[1:57:52] to question elijah's authenticity
[1:57:57] god was going to reveal his strength
[1:58:01] through it
[1:58:07] what was causing the people to question
[1:58:11] elijah's
[1:58:13] authenticity
[1:58:17] god was going to
[1:58:19] reveal
[1:58:20] his strength
[1:58:24] through the weakness
[1:58:28] of the sacrifice
[1:58:38] at the time that this fire ignited
[1:58:43] maybe
[1:58:44] those who had started to walk home now
[1:58:47] listen sometimes you can't blame people
[1:58:51] for getting discouraged
[1:58:54] in church
[1:58:58] you can't
[1:58:59] because sometimes
[1:59:01] things just go beyond what they
[1:59:04] know
[1:59:05] is
[1:59:07] capable or able or possible
[1:59:12] but if like thomas
[1:59:14] god will prove to his people that he is
[1:59:18] god
[1:59:19] amen
[1:59:21] so some of these people who were walking
[1:59:24] home
[1:59:26] before elijah called for the fire
[1:59:30] heard a a racket behind them
[1:59:34] people shouting and singing and dancing
[1:59:40] as the fire erupted on the altar and ran
[1:59:43] back to see for themselves
[1:59:48] this is what we need in the church
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] we need people
[1:59:56] sacrifices
[1:59:59] who are consumed by god
[2:00:02] and it causes the discouraged to turn
[2:00:06] around and come back and say what's all
[2:00:08] the racket about he says the consuming
[2:00:11] god is here
[2:00:13] my consuming god is here
[2:00:16] god is a consuming fire
[2:00:25] god
[2:00:27] will cause us to move
[2:00:30] forward amen
[2:00:32] you cannot lead yourself
[2:00:35] to the wedding supper
[2:00:37] you don't even know the way there excuse
[2:00:40] me
[2:00:41] okay you need to be led there
[2:00:45] because you are sheep
[2:00:47] and sheep cannot find their way home
[2:00:50] sheep need a shepherd and it is our
[2:00:53] lord god the consuming fire who will
[2:00:57] cause us to find our way home
[2:01:05] think about the water
[2:01:11] this water was perhaps just
[2:01:15] in the ocean somewhere
[2:01:19] remember it hadn't rained for three
[2:01:21] years no one really knows where this
[2:01:23] water come from but we know that there
[2:01:25] was water
[2:01:29] but through the elijah ministry
[2:01:33] there was a portion
[2:01:35] of water
[2:01:37] that was called by god
[2:01:40] through
[2:01:41] an elijah ministry
[2:01:43] to become part of god's program
[2:01:50] sometimes i repeat things because i feel
[2:01:52] led to repeat them so if i repeat myself
[2:01:54] it's not because i'm getting old
[2:02:01] this water was in the ocean somewhere
[2:02:03] let's say
[2:02:06] and a through an elijah ministry
[2:02:11] god was going to
[2:02:14] god was calling a portion of this water
[2:02:19] to himself
[2:02:21] so that that water could find its
[2:02:23] position in god's program
[2:02:28] through the elijah ministry
[2:02:33] an elected water
[2:02:38] that was in god's mind before the
[2:02:40] foundation of the world
[2:02:46] god's strength was going to be made
[2:02:49] perfect through the water
[2:02:55] the water surrounded
[2:02:58] the altar
[2:03:04] elijah had dug that trench
[2:03:10] elijah in all things
[2:03:13] at god's word
[2:03:15] elijah dug that trench
[2:03:18] because god knew
[2:03:20] the water was going to surround
[2:03:24] the sacrifice
[2:03:30] the trench that elijah dug held the
[2:03:33] water
[2:03:38] brothers and sisters it's not you
[2:03:39] holding god
[2:03:42] it's god holding you
[2:03:46] amen
[2:03:49] your ability to get to the wedding
[2:03:52] supper is not by your strength
[2:03:55] it's by his
[2:03:57] the prophet of god said he said it's not
[2:03:58] your love in question it's his
[2:04:03] amen
[2:04:05] it's god holding you
[2:04:07] not you holding god
[2:04:14] the weakest part
[2:04:16] of what you see here was the water
[2:04:21] the weakest part of this sacrifice
[2:04:25] was
[2:04:26] the water
[2:04:28] what did god say he said my strength is
[2:04:31] made perfect
[2:04:33] in weakness
[2:04:40] the
[2:04:41] sacrifice and all its components
[2:04:45] were a revelation
[2:04:48] to elijah
[2:04:50] the water represents humanity
[2:04:57] chosen before the foundation of the
[2:05:00] world
[2:05:03] called by an elijah ministry
[2:05:08] placed correctly in relationship to the
[2:05:12] word
[2:05:16] all
[2:05:18] this is the perfect
[2:05:21] mind of god on display
[2:05:27] god cannot use
[2:05:30] unsurrendered
[2:05:32] humanity
[2:05:36] that's why through an elijah ministry
[2:05:40] there became 12 barrels of water that
[2:05:44] were now surrendered as a result of that
[2:05:47] ministry to the work of the lord
[2:05:56] and god can't use us
[2:06:00] unless we're fully surrendered
[2:06:04] to his word
[2:06:06] and the way that we become surrendered
[2:06:09] to his word is through an elijah
[2:06:12] ministry
[2:06:14] and through that elijah ministry now we
[2:06:16] can play our part
[2:06:19] amen because we have a part because
[2:06:22] elijah had done all these things at
[2:06:25] god's word
[2:06:26] so the water was a part of god's program
[2:06:29] the weakness was a part of god's program
[2:06:33] this humanity is a part of god's program
[2:06:37] it was in his mind before the foundation
[2:06:40] of the world
[2:06:42] but now it has been called through an
[2:06:45] elijah ministry it's it and now it's
[2:06:48] positioned
[2:06:50] correctly
[2:06:52] in relationship to the word
[2:06:58] why
[2:07:00] let's refresh
[2:07:02] why
[2:07:04] because god was going to prove
[2:07:08] that he was god
[2:07:10] through the weakness
[2:07:14] of the sacrifice
[2:07:16] through the weakness of the sacrifice
[2:07:19] god was going to be made strong
[2:07:38] think about this
[2:07:41] we have thought about the water
[2:07:44] by thinking about this body
[2:07:48] god placed himself
[2:07:51] in a body of flesh
[2:07:53] that was born by sex desire
[2:07:59] this body
[2:08:02] is like the water on the altar
[2:08:06] and the same questions come up now
[2:08:11] how can god do it
[2:08:17] how can
[2:08:19] signs and wonders follow
[2:08:25] such
[2:08:26] weakness
[2:08:29] [Music]
[2:08:35] look at them
[2:08:39] elijah's gone off the rails
[2:08:42] he's gone too far
[2:08:46] but it's exactly in accordance with
[2:08:48] god's word
[2:08:52] it won't work
[2:08:56] but brothers and sisters
[2:08:59] we ain't just anybody
[2:09:03] you know what i find in my my walk over
[2:09:06] this over the past six months
[2:09:08] is that the devil wants me to think that
[2:09:10] i'm just like anyone else
[2:09:15] well let me ask you a question devil was
[2:09:18] this water
[2:09:20] like all the other waters
[2:09:23] [Music]
[2:09:25] this water
[2:09:27] was had the same characteristics
[2:09:30] but it was cold
[2:09:33] it was chosen
[2:09:35] it was elected by god from before the
[2:09:38] foundation of the world that i'm gonna
[2:09:40] work through that water i'm gonna walk
[2:09:42] work through that humanity
[2:09:46] we ain't like everyone else
[2:09:49] we're chosen by god positioned through
[2:09:53] an elijah ministry
[2:09:56] separated because of an eagle call
[2:10:04] you can call yourself a chicken
[2:10:08] but god's told me i'm an eagle
[2:10:16] that's what makes the difference
[2:10:20] is the elijah ministry
[2:10:24] this flesh
[2:10:26] has been called
[2:10:28] by an eagle call
[2:10:32] to become part of the sacrifice
[2:10:40] that's what makes the difference
[2:10:46] it's not the way
[2:10:48] you
[2:10:49] you do your hair it's not the way that
[2:10:51] you dress
[2:10:53] but the reason
[2:10:55] i do
[2:10:57] that is because i have been called by
[2:11:00] god through
[2:11:02] an elijah ministry
[2:11:06] without that elijah ministry i could not
[2:11:09] be positioned
[2:11:14] amen
[2:11:15] but we've got to recognize that we are
[2:11:17] part of god's order we are a part of
[2:11:20] god's program even even though we are
[2:11:25] the weakest part of the sacrifice
[2:11:29] i'm still a part of his program he still
[2:11:32] called me even though i am the weakest
[2:11:35] part of the the sacrifice that you see
[2:11:38] the bit that you see is the weakest part
[2:11:41] humanity
[2:11:44] glory
[2:11:48] this body is dedicated to the work of
[2:11:51] the lord
[2:11:55] and i am the weakest
[2:11:59] of this relationship
[2:12:03] yes sir i am the weaker vessel
[2:12:09] because we are the bride
[2:12:16] that is what i am i am
[2:12:19] human
[2:12:22] lord i'm weak
[2:12:24] i am the weak one in this relationship
[2:12:28] but i understand my position
[2:12:32] i understand i'm called
[2:12:34] i understand i have a purpose
[2:12:37] in what you are doing
[2:12:39] i am the water on the altar
[2:12:42] but lord in my weakness you are made
[2:12:46] strong in my inability
[2:12:50] you express your ability
[2:12:54] the more i can accept my weakness the
[2:12:57] greater opportunity i give you to
[2:13:00] express your strength
[2:13:04] amen
[2:13:05] the more that i can accept my weakness
[2:13:10] the more opportunity i give you to
[2:13:12] express your strength
[2:13:16] because why god's strength is perfected
[2:13:19] through weakness
[2:13:26] but again
[2:13:29] the water didn't limit
[2:13:31] god
[2:13:37] humanity doesn't limit god
[2:13:40] surrendered humanity doesn't limit god
[2:13:49] it's surrendered to his will
[2:13:53] it doesn't limit
[2:13:55] god it says oh god i said oh my god look
[2:13:58] what bro look i can't believe that i
[2:14:00] chose brother dan
[2:14:04] what have i done
[2:14:08] that's me he says that
[2:14:10] why'd you choose me for all lord
[2:14:12] i don't understand it
[2:14:16] if the water could speak
[2:14:18] it'll say i don't understand
[2:14:22] why don't you choose me
[2:14:25] you mean that you're going to prove
[2:14:27] yourself through me
[2:14:31] i don't get it
[2:14:34] you know what he says you don't have to
[2:14:38] just surrender
[2:14:41] to surrender to the fact that you are
[2:14:43] chosen by me ordained by me positioned
[2:14:47] by me and your purpose is by me i will
[2:14:51] you you are what you are because of me
[2:14:55] paul said i am what i am because of the
[2:14:58] grace of god
[2:15:03] oh my
[2:15:11] we need to surrender
[2:15:13] to god's will
[2:15:19] allow god to work
[2:15:23] through us
[2:15:28] don't be ashamed
[2:15:32] that you're the weaker vessel
[2:15:37] because god is going to prove himself
[2:15:39] through you
[2:15:43] i think this is incredible
[2:15:46] that god designed something to prove
[2:15:48] himself by
[2:15:51] god designed this sacrifice
[2:15:54] why to prove himself by it
[2:15:57] amen
[2:15:58] god designed you
[2:16:01] god designed me
[2:16:04] god designed you brother dan yeah with
[2:16:07] all your flaws yeah
[2:16:11] with all your weaknesses yeah
[2:16:14] i mean you can't even say half the names
[2:16:15] in the bible yep
[2:16:22] yep he did
[2:16:29] well but then i don't know how god can
[2:16:31] use you in that way
[2:16:33] well
[2:16:34] they didn't know how god was going to
[2:16:36] use a seventh grader either
[2:16:39] and you know what i got to grade 10.
[2:16:43] but that doesn't mean nothing in the
[2:16:45] scheme of god
[2:16:47] nothing at all all god wants is
[2:16:49] surrendered to humanity your education
[2:16:52] doesn't help god
[2:16:55] and nor does the lack of education help
[2:16:58] god
[2:17:00] god don't need help
[2:17:01] he just needs us to surrender
[2:17:05] to him
[2:17:08] god is perfected
[2:17:11] through weakness
[2:17:20] god is not limited
[2:17:22] by weakness
[2:17:26] god is perfected
[2:17:28] by weakness
[2:17:32] god's strength is perfected in weakness
[2:17:39] god's strength is perfected in weakness
[2:17:45] god is not limited
[2:17:48] by your humanity
[2:17:53] god is limited by your strength
[2:18:02] when you think you're something that
[2:18:03] you're not you just limit god
[2:18:10] god had to send moses into the desert
[2:18:12] for every year that he was educated
[2:18:18] why because moses education limited god
[2:18:22] in that moses thought he was something
[2:18:24] because he had an education
[2:18:26] i'm not saying we all need to be
[2:18:28] uneducated
[2:18:29] okay if you've got a phd just remember
[2:18:31] you're nothing
[2:18:33] you're no more than the guy who didn't
[2:18:35] finish seventh grade
[2:18:39] why because your phd doesn't help god
[2:18:41] okay
[2:18:42] so through the revelation that you're
[2:18:44] still human
[2:18:48] we need to recognize
[2:18:50] this might be a bit of a shock to you
[2:18:52] okay
[2:18:53] we need to recognize our humanity
[2:18:59] and recognize that our humanity is the
[2:19:02] very thing that god will use to bring
[2:19:05] his people
[2:19:07] unto himself
[2:19:14] this is stranger
[2:19:16] recognize our humanity yeah recognize
[2:19:21] our humanity
[2:19:23] because through your humanity
[2:19:27] god will bring his people unto himself
[2:19:29] when he works through that humanity just
[2:19:33] exactly the same
[2:19:34] as what he was going to do here he was
[2:19:36] going to bring himself
[2:19:39] bring his people unto himself
[2:19:42] by consuming a weak sacrifice
[2:19:46] but the sacrifice the strength wasn't in
[2:19:49] the sacrifice was it
[2:19:51] once elijah had done all the work
[2:19:54] elijah can step back and say lord i've
[2:19:57] done my bit and there was that that that
[2:20:00] sacrifice did nothing for the people
[2:20:05] amen it wasn't until the the dynamics
[2:20:09] and the mechanics united together elijah
[2:20:12] had done the mechanics but now the
[2:20:14] dynamics needed to unite with the
[2:20:16] mechanics so that both could work
[2:20:18] together
[2:20:22] and we god just wants us to do what he
[2:20:25] wants us to do but what it takes is a
[2:20:28] union between the mechanics and the
[2:20:31] dynamics it needs the dove to come down
[2:20:36] upon the sacrifice
[2:20:39] in a marital union
[2:20:41] so that now god can do through the
[2:20:44] evening sacrifice what he wanted to do
[2:20:47] before the foundation of the world the
[2:20:49] sacrifice could do nothing of itself
[2:20:53] does that ring any bells the sacrifice
[2:20:55] could do nothing of itself
[2:20:58] we should know that
[2:21:01] not because we read it in the bible
[2:21:03] but because we've tried
[2:21:07] we've tried to do it ourself and fell on
[2:21:09] our face
[2:21:10] by god's grace
[2:21:15] why because it takes the dove
[2:21:20] to come down upon the sacrifice
[2:21:25] in a marital union
[2:21:29] so that now god through
[2:21:32] the union
[2:21:34] through whom he has united with
[2:21:39] reproduces himself
[2:21:43] through that union again
[2:21:46] the whole the purpose in marriage is
[2:21:49] that the the male seed can reproduce
[2:21:52] himself through whom he has united with
[2:21:58] the purpose of the union
[2:22:01] between christ and his bride is so that
[2:22:04] he can reproduce himself in
[2:22:08] through
[2:22:09] the very thing that he has united
[2:22:12] himself with
[2:22:18] through
[2:22:19] humanity
[2:22:22] god reproduces himself
[2:22:25] through humanity god is reproducing
[2:22:28] himself in a many-membered body
[2:22:34] the mechanics
[2:22:36] are in place
[2:22:40] and got elijah calls
[2:22:44] on god and said lord i've done all
[2:22:47] these things at thy word.
[2:22:50] and down comes
[2:22:52] the fire of god
[2:22:56] and the fire of god just didn't hover
[2:23:00] on the top
[2:23:03] the fire of god was a
[2:23:06] consuming
[2:23:08] fire
[2:23:09] it it it it
[2:23:12] it consumed
[2:23:14] the bullock
[2:23:16] the wet bullock
[2:23:18] it consumes
[2:23:20] the wet water
[2:23:23] well that's understandable isn't it
[2:23:26] but let's go a bit further
[2:23:27] it consumed the stones
[2:23:33] this is something else
[2:23:35] this is something beyond
[2:23:37] what we imagined
[2:23:42] let god interpret his word by bringing
[2:23:45] it to pass you you don't know how
[2:23:47] consumed god can consume you until you
[2:23:50] allow god to consume you but let me just
[2:23:53] say this once upon a time there was a
[2:23:56] man named enoch and he was consumed
[2:24:01] because my god is a consuming fire god
[2:24:05] consumed him
[2:24:07] [Music]
[2:24:08] and when fire come down upon this altar
[2:24:11] it consumed the stones it says it
[2:24:13] consumed the dust
[2:24:18] and it lifted up
[2:24:20] humanity
[2:24:24] it licked up the water
[2:24:26] until the onlookers looked
[2:24:32] and they said it was there
[2:24:36] well once upon a time
[2:24:38] there was a man named enoch
[2:24:42] and then the fire of god come down and
[2:24:44] consumed him
[2:24:46] and they looked
[2:24:48] and they said he was there
[2:24:52] where did he go
[2:24:54] he was not found
[2:24:58] well guess what
[2:25:00] it was
[2:25:01] not found
[2:25:04] perhaps there was a burnt spot in the
[2:25:06] dirt
[2:25:07] i don't know
[2:25:08] but it was not found
[2:25:11] well brothers and sisters
[2:25:14] there is a evening sacrifice
[2:25:18] amen that has become a revelation
[2:25:22] she has become a revelation unto herself
[2:25:27] and she in her weakness is becoming
[2:25:31] consumed
[2:25:34] until the people of this tabernacle the
[2:25:37] neighbors will say he once lived over
[2:25:39] there
[2:25:43] amen
[2:25:44] once she lived over there with a with a
[2:25:47] daughter
[2:25:51] where are they going i don't know
[2:25:54] but we know
[2:25:56] we will look at us say they were
[2:25:58] consumed
[2:26:00] by the fire of god
[2:26:04] amen we are being consumed
[2:26:09] until we won't be found
[2:26:13] there will be no trace of you brother
[2:26:15] jeremy
[2:26:17] there will be no trace of me
[2:26:21] they're gone
[2:26:24] amen
[2:26:26] through my
[2:26:28] weakness
[2:26:30] god is made strong
[2:26:34] through this humanity
[2:26:38] god is going to prove himself
[2:26:42] to be the one
[2:26:44] true
[2:26:46] god
[2:26:49] the thing that we try and escape
[2:26:52] we need to accept
[2:26:54] that's right
[2:26:58] we are trying to escape humanity
[2:27:02] through a body change
[2:27:04] but the way that we're going to be
[2:27:06] changed is by accepting our humanity
[2:27:16] this isn't very popular i guess
[2:27:23] in our in our way of thinking
[2:27:28] but the revelation of jesus christ
[2:27:33] is very real
[2:27:37] and it needs to be as real to you as
[2:27:40] what it was to
[2:27:42] elijah
[2:27:46] it's god in humanity
[2:27:50] god in flesh
[2:27:55] and we need to accept
[2:28:01] our humanity
[2:28:04] i'll read you some quotations
[2:28:10] so moses this young fine strong
[2:28:14] giant intelligent man
[2:28:17] he set out to do a good work but god
[2:28:20] simply absolutely could not use it
[2:28:25] he could not use his natural abilities
[2:28:30] it isn't today
[2:28:32] that we cannot god cannot use our
[2:28:35] natural abilities
[2:28:38] but there's one thing moses
[2:28:42] had
[2:28:42] that i admire
[2:28:45] he had sense enough to know that he was
[2:28:48] licked
[2:28:50] we haven't
[2:28:54] moses realized it
[2:28:56] and he knowed enough then god took him
[2:28:59] back
[2:29:00] in the back in the wilderness to learn
[2:29:04] him some human weaknesses
[2:29:11] he took him back to learn him
[2:29:14] what it was all about
[2:29:19] human weaknesses god took moses back to
[2:29:22] the backside of the desert to teach
[2:29:24] moses human weaknesses
[2:29:28] god took moses to the backside of the
[2:29:30] desert to teach him what it was all
[2:29:32] about
[2:29:37] so well did he learn oh my did did he
[2:29:40] ever get a lesson
[2:29:42] god must have had a time with him back
[2:29:44] there you know moses had a temper and
[2:29:46] god gave him a wife by the name of
[2:29:48] sapporo she had one too so i imagine
[2:29:51] everything wasn't so pleasing back on
[2:29:54] the back side of the desert for a while
[2:29:56] when both of their tempers got out of
[2:29:58] control at the same time
[2:30:03] brothers your wife is chosen for you
[2:30:08] sisters your husband is chosen for you
[2:30:12] why to learn some human
[2:30:16] weaknesses oh it's fantastic
[2:30:21] i suppose this intelligent
[2:30:23] concept of a psychological ought to
[2:30:26] control a person
[2:30:28] didn't do much good because when he was
[2:30:31] on the road to egypt i see sapporo still
[2:30:35] had a temple she cut the foreskin off
[2:30:38] her
[2:30:40] she cut the foreskin
[2:30:42] of her son off and throwed it before
[2:30:45] moses and said you're a bloody husband
[2:30:48] to me
[2:30:50] god was so angry with him
[2:30:54] that he looked for him in the end and if
[2:30:56] he could have found him
[2:30:58] he'd have slain him
[2:31:01] i guess there was a little things god
[2:31:04] had to teach him back there see
[2:31:07] that he was a human
[2:31:16] why
[2:31:18] because god was going to work through
[2:31:20] humanity
[2:31:24] but moses got the idea that he was
[2:31:26] something more than humanity
[2:31:30] so god had to teach him that he was a
[2:31:33] human
[2:31:36] yeah he was a chosen human
[2:31:39] he was elected
[2:31:41] human
[2:31:43] but he was still human
[2:31:47] all of his weakness of egypt all of his
[2:31:49] wisdom of egypt all of his powers of
[2:31:51] intellectual god
[2:31:53] could not
[2:31:54] use are one of them
[2:31:58] you come say now lord i've been schooled
[2:32:00] for 40 years i'm an intellectual student
[2:32:04] i can quote the bible with my eyes
[2:32:06] closed god can't use a bit of that see
[2:32:08] no oh i belong to the biggest church
[2:32:11] there is in the country i'm this lord
[2:32:13] i'm i'm a pentecostal glory to god i
[2:32:16] received the holy ghost the other night
[2:32:18] hallelujah you're going to make me to do
[2:32:22] so and so god can't use a bit of that
[2:32:26] no
[2:32:28] when you get licked
[2:32:31] and realize you're licked
[2:32:34] and then come back come on back and
[2:32:37] humble yourself
[2:32:38] get weak
[2:32:40] find out you're human
[2:32:43] and there's none of your intellects
[2:32:46] can do to
[2:32:48] human weakness will never be used of god
[2:32:52] god by the human weakness
[2:32:56] pours himself into you
[2:33:00] then he uses himself
[2:33:03] you just become an instrument
[2:33:06] certainly you've got to get yourself out
[2:33:10] of
[2:33:11] the way
[2:33:13] god can't use human weakness but god by
[2:33:17] the human weakness pours himself into
[2:33:21] you
[2:33:22] then he uses you
[2:33:25] he uses himself then he uses himself
[2:33:30] you just become
[2:33:32] an instrument
[2:33:38] so let's just going to go and reverse
[2:33:39] here
[2:33:44] god pours himself
[2:33:47] into you
[2:33:50] and then he uses himself
[2:33:54] to accomplish his purpose
[2:33:57] that he had for you
[2:34:02] amen
[2:34:03] god
[2:34:04] pours himself into you
[2:34:08] and uses
[2:34:10] himself
[2:34:12] to accomplish
[2:34:14] his purpose
[2:34:16] that he had for you
[2:34:19] did god have a purpose for the water
[2:34:22] how was the purpose fulfilled how was
[2:34:24] the purpose for the water fulfilled
[2:34:27] by the consuming fire
[2:34:30] by the dove
[2:34:32] coming down
[2:34:34] and consuming
[2:34:37] the humanity
[2:34:39] and then the consuming fire fulfilled
[2:34:43] the purpose
[2:34:45] that was given to the water
[2:34:48] glory amen
[2:34:50] and and and
[2:34:52] let me just find it here
[2:34:58] did they cry out
[2:35:00] then the fire of god fell and consumed
[2:35:03] the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[2:35:06] stones and the dust and licked up the
[2:35:09] water that was in the trench and when
[2:35:11] all the people saw it they fell on their
[2:35:13] faces and they said the lord
[2:35:16] he is the god
[2:35:19] the lord
[2:35:20] he is
[2:35:21] the god
[2:35:23] amen god wants to use you
[2:35:26] to reveal himself
[2:35:30] god is not using you to reveal you
[2:35:35] god is using you to reveal himself
[2:35:41] and people look at you and think
[2:35:44] how can god ever
[2:35:46] how can god do what he said he was going
[2:35:49] to do
[2:35:50] through humanity
[2:35:52] well brothers and sisters we stand here
[2:35:55] as witnesses
[2:35:56] that the lord he is the god the lord he
[2:36:01] is the god the lord he is the god why
[2:36:05] because a consuming fire
[2:36:08] has come down
[2:36:10] and consumed
[2:36:12] the evening sacrifice
[2:36:16] and in its weakness
[2:36:20] god
[2:36:21] is revealed
[2:36:25] in the weakness of the sacrifice
[2:36:29] god
[2:36:30] is revealed
[2:36:33] if you want to do something for god
[2:36:36] surrender
[2:36:40] surrender to his word
[2:36:43] because if
[2:36:44] he's called you
[2:36:46] you come
[2:36:49] and some people in this building know
[2:36:52] that they're called
[2:36:53] but they're fighting the calling
[2:36:58] yes they are
[2:36:59] but listen to me
[2:37:01] god is greater than you
[2:37:06] god is stronger than you
[2:37:09] i don't care how many times you've been
[2:37:11] to the gym i don't know how many times
[2:37:13] you've run up to this mountain and i do
[2:37:15] not care
[2:37:18] because god is greater than you
[2:37:21] god is you think you can outrun god give
[2:37:24] it a shot but i am a witness
[2:37:27] that if you are called by god you will
[2:37:31] find yourself praising god in the pew as
[2:37:35] a living sacrifice because god has
[2:37:38] ordained you before the foundation of
[2:37:41] the world to be a living sacrifice and
[2:37:44] nothing
[2:37:46] can stop god's word coming to pass
[2:37:50] amen
[2:37:52] my god is awesome
[2:37:55] he can move mountains
[2:37:59] but he can cause those that are running
[2:38:02] from him
[2:38:04] to turn them
[2:38:05] he'll just watch you
[2:38:07] he's got so much energy he'll just watch
[2:38:10] you until you get too tired that you
[2:38:12] can't run anymore and he'll look down at
[2:38:14] you he won't be huffing he won't be
[2:38:16] puffing he wants i'm glad you stopped
[2:38:18] he'll say are you done yet
[2:38:22] if you want to keep going let's keep
[2:38:24] going
[2:38:26] it ain't no big deal to me i got all the
[2:38:28] you know you're shoving down these v
[2:38:30] drinks and parades and all these things
[2:38:31] that energize yourself it doesn't matter
[2:38:34] to god you turn around and say surely
[2:38:36] i've lost him you turn turn around and
[2:38:38] he's right there
[2:38:43] he's not stressing he's not sweating
[2:38:45] he's not changing his shoes he's not
[2:38:47] doing up his laces he's just there
[2:38:53] god doesn't get tired
[2:38:59] god's strength is endless
[2:39:04] and if you want to fight god go ahead
[2:39:08] but i know the end
[2:39:10] you lose
[2:39:12] i'm sorry you lose
[2:39:15] and that's just
[2:39:17] a fact
[2:39:21] our god
[2:39:23] the consuming fire
[2:39:27] is here
[2:39:29] amen
[2:39:31] this is this is the question among our
[2:39:32] young people
[2:39:34] where's god
[2:39:37] it's true where's god
[2:39:42] but he's here
[2:39:45] because the god
[2:39:48] as elijah said
[2:39:50] lord that you might show to the people
[2:39:52] that you are god in israel
[2:39:57] we're not speaking about a god in heaven
[2:40:01] we're speaking about a god in the bride
[2:40:06] amen a god in the bride not the god of
[2:40:09] the bride yes the god in the bride is
[2:40:11] the god of the bride but the god of the
[2:40:13] bride is the god in the bride
[2:40:20] through our weakness
[2:40:24] humanity
[2:40:27] god
[2:40:29] is going to be revealed
[2:40:34] god is going to be revealed
[2:40:36] to the father and the mother perhaps of
[2:40:40] a of a child that hasn't come to christ
[2:40:42] yet god is going to be revealed to that
[2:40:45] child
[2:40:47] through the father or the mother or
[2:40:49] perhaps a brother or perhaps a sister i
[2:40:51] don't know but all i know is that god is
[2:40:54] going to reveal himself to whom i
[2:40:57] predestinated to know him because it's
[2:41:00] his desire for his seed to know him
[2:41:06] god is our healer
[2:41:11] god is my son's healer
[2:41:17] amen
[2:41:18] god can cause
[2:41:21] my son
[2:41:22] in us in the stalemate that he finds
[2:41:25] himself in that place of indecision god
[2:41:28] could cause that person to turn around
[2:41:30] but we've got to realize that it could
[2:41:32] be through me
[2:41:36] that god reveals himself
[2:41:38] causing him to turn around and come back
[2:41:41] to where he left god
[2:41:45] evening sacrifice
[2:41:48] there's an evening light
[2:41:51] amen
[2:41:52] there's an evening light
[2:41:55] the evening light is in the evening
[2:41:57] sacrifice the evening light come on the
[2:41:59] evening sacrifice
[2:42:06] did you know
[2:42:08] that jesus had a revelation of his
[2:42:11] humanity
[2:42:18] wow
[2:42:19] jesus had a revelation of his humanity
[2:42:22] yes
[2:42:23] he said i can do nothing
[2:42:26] of myself
[2:42:31] jesus knew his weakness
[2:42:36] we don't think of the revelation of
[2:42:38] jesus christ like this but the
[2:42:40] revelation of jesus christ it has power
[2:42:43] that there is a weaker vessel and there
[2:42:45] is the powerful vessel
[2:42:47] the revelation of jesus christ is
[2:42:49] twofold
[2:42:50] it's the lamb and the dove yes
[2:42:55] the seventh seal comes down on the on
[2:42:58] the lamb the dove comes down upon the
[2:43:00] lamb the weakest vessel
[2:43:05] what the dove can't do
[2:43:07] sorry what the lamb can't do the dove
[2:43:10] did for the lamb
[2:43:20] what the lamb can't do
[2:43:24] the dove
[2:43:28] did
[2:43:35] what the lamb can't do
[2:43:39] the dove does
[2:43:43] the spirit of god
[2:43:45] the holy ghost
[2:43:48] what the lamb can't do
[2:43:52] ba
[2:43:53] the lamb
[2:43:54] what the lamb can't do
[2:43:57] the dove does
[2:44:02] the living sacrifice
[2:44:06] in the weakness
[2:44:08] of the sacrifice
[2:44:11] god was made strong
[2:44:15] amen let's just stand to our feet
[2:44:17] brother elroy i'm going to have to ask
[2:44:18] you to close
[2:44:25] let's just offer a word of prayer
[2:44:32] our gracious and loving heavenly father
[2:44:39] lord i know from my life that
[2:44:43] you've bought me this road for a reason
[2:44:47] and lord god it's only because of you
[2:44:50] that i can think of myself this way
[2:44:55] because this is a revelation
[2:44:59] the evening sacrifice is a revelation
[2:45:04] and the evening sacrifice
[2:45:06] is on earth
[2:45:12] and she is a revelation
[2:45:16] unto herself
[2:45:21] lord god may you just take from us
[2:45:23] tonight any thoughts that we might have
[2:45:27] that we can accomplish anything of
[2:45:29] ourselves
[2:45:31] lord we stand here as as as useless
[2:45:35] as that sacrifice was
[2:45:37] that altar that elijah had prepared by
[2:45:40] your word
[2:45:43] and lord god you have prepared yourself
[2:45:45] for sacrifice
[2:45:47] we are not self-prepared
[2:45:52] but lord god you have prepared us
[2:45:57] to be totally consumed by you
[2:46:02] in all our weakness
[2:46:05] in all that we are
[2:46:09] the things that we try and escape
[2:46:13] we need to accept
[2:46:18] lord god
[2:46:20] we want to thank you
[2:46:22] tonight for this
[2:46:25] beautiful
[2:46:26] revelation that you have given us
[2:46:30] that you are not asking us to be strong
[2:46:34] in our human ability
[2:46:38] but lord god the strength that you
[2:46:40] require of us
[2:46:42] is through the revelation of who we are
[2:46:46] and into the revelation of who you are
[2:46:51] that lord god we can achieve nothing
[2:46:54] of ourself
[2:46:56] but lord god with you
[2:46:59] all things
[2:47:01] are possible
[2:47:05] oh lord that's the revelation of jesus
[2:47:08] christ for this hour
[2:47:12] it's strength
[2:47:13] and weakness uniting together
[2:47:18] it's the supernatural
[2:47:20] and the natural
[2:47:22] uniting together
[2:47:26] oh lord god
[2:47:28] our prayer heavenly father is if we have
[2:47:30] been in that place of indecision
[2:47:33] that this revelation lord god would sink
[2:47:36] deep into our hearts
[2:47:38] and lord jesus if there be someone
[2:47:40] amongst us tonight that is questioning
[2:47:43] who is god lord god may you reveal
[2:47:47] yourself tonight
[2:47:49] through a surrendered vessel through a
[2:47:52] living sacrifice that is here tonight
[2:47:55] lord god
[2:47:57] for your honor and glory
[2:48:00] o lord god our desire is that we become
[2:48:02] so consumed
[2:48:04] lord god that the people who have become
[2:48:07] discouraged
[2:48:10] turn back
[2:48:12] to see what the noise is about
[2:48:14] lord god and you you attract people to
[2:48:17] yourself
[2:48:19] lord god you are not attracting people
[2:48:21] to grace tabernacle but lord god you're
[2:48:24] attracting
[2:48:26] people to yourself through the grace
[2:48:28] tabernacle
[2:48:30] oh lord god may we as fathers
[2:48:35] understand who we are
[2:48:37] may we understand may we not limit god
[2:48:40] but say well i don't know if god can use
[2:48:42] me i'm just too weak that's the very
[2:48:44] thing that god is going to reveal
[2:48:46] himself through
[2:48:48] may mothers
[2:48:50] lord god be the same way
[2:48:52] they may feel insignificant they may
[2:48:55] feel insufficient they may not know what
[2:48:57] the next step is but lord god if if we
[2:49:01] would just recognize who we are and call
[2:49:03] on you like a lie to call and you say
[2:49:06] lord i have done all that you've asked
[2:49:08] for consume your sacrifice lord
