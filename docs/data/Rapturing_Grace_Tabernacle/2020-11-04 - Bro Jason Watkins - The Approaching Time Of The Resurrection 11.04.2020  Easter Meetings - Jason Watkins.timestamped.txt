[28:31] god bless you greet you in the name of
[28:34] the Lord Jesus this evening well for you
[28:36] I suppose this morning for us it's
[28:39] evening but I'm glad that we were sure
[28:44] to arrive at a place together where we
[28:46] won't have time differences in
[28:48] separation a man I'm looking forward to
[28:51] that hours why we're gathered here
[28:53] tonight heard this morning I'm going to
[28:55] have to try to remember to say this
[28:56] morning so god bless you all greet you
[28:59] from our assembly here in Beaufort South
[29:02] Carolina have a few brothers here
[29:06] assembling with us tonight we're much
[29:08] like you we are on national walk down as
[29:11] it were and so we've been kind of doing
[29:15] our services livestream for the last
[29:18] number of weeks actually we're not
[29:21] allowed to have more than ten here at
[29:24] any given time so we just have some
[29:26] engineers working on the technical side
[29:28] we usually have it several musicians and
[29:31] we we're getting along nicely so I'm
[29:34] sure that you are as well it's amazing
[29:37] on the technology that we can come right
[29:40] into your homes
[29:40] I was speaking through some ministers
[29:43] yesterday and was commenting you know
[29:47] about this coming service and actually
[29:48] this isn't the only one there's a number
[29:51] of Easter meetings going on right now
[29:55] where they are live-streaming from the
[29:58] US and from Canada and different places
[30:00] and so it's it's kind of a first you
[30:05] know we've never been here before we've
[30:06] never had a situation where you know
[30:09] message churches around the world were
[30:11] under a constraint to not gather inside
[30:16] their normal building but you know
[30:17] actually I was commenting to those
[30:20] ministers that were going to leverage
[30:22] technology and use the enemy's tree of
[30:27] knowledge against him hey man we're
[30:30] gonna a men are gonna use it to our
[30:32] advantage
[30:33] and exact a toll I think you ought to
[30:37] exact a toll
[30:38] on the enemy in this in these services
[30:42] and it's just an amazing thing that this
[30:45] is even possible you know we we've said
[30:49] for years that we would we believed we
[30:52] were returning to the book of Acts and
[30:53] we desired that and desire it as we
[30:56] speak well you know if you read the book
[30:58] of Acts closely the most meetings that
[31:01] are held in the New Testament are held
[31:03] in homes and there they went house to
[31:05] house and so actually tonight we're more
[31:08] in line with the book of Acts than we've
[31:10] ever been
[31:11] and so you know the gathering in a
[31:13] common place was a privilege that we
[31:17] were given under civilized law when the
[31:20] church first started out and they were
[31:22] under severe persecution from the
[31:24] government they they they had to go
[31:26] house to house so while this isn't what
[31:29] we would call a persecution by any means
[31:31] it's just our doing our part why and
[31:36] preserve our testimony in the community
[31:39] and this after all every every you know
[31:42] our Jerusalem is our is our main or must
[31:46] always be our primary mission fields as
[31:49] Jesus told the disciples you'll be a
[31:51] witness first in Jerusalem and the whole
[31:54] where you are then in Judea then in
[31:57] Samaria then to the uttermost part of
[31:59] the earth so we we want to preserve our
[32:02] ability to help the people of our
[32:05] community and we could hardly do that if
[32:07] we were flaunting the recommendations of
[32:09] the government that would destroy our
[32:12] testimony and we wouldn't be able to
[32:14] help them at all so want to use the bad
[32:16] part of wisdom and do it this way and so
[32:20] what we I'm I'm somewhat used to it
[32:22] already for having done it several weeks
[32:24] now and I've got my normal spread of
[32:27] brothers hear preach to a man so I'm
[32:29] glad to have them all here tonight I
[32:31] want to thank brother I've never
[32:33] actually got to meet him in person I've
[32:36] met his dad a number of times we've had
[32:38] good good fellowship together loved his
[32:41] dad quite a bit his mom and but have
[32:44] never met or the how I never really
[32:46] talked to him until we use these
[32:48] electronic means and we were really
[32:51] looking for what I was looking forward
[32:52] to being there and gathering with you
[33:04] meetings were praying about not not
[33:08] having no idea that there wouldn't be
[33:10] any standard meetings they would go on
[33:13] in the normal sense and so uh but I'm
[33:17] just in prayer I eliminated all of them
[33:20] and let the already know that I felt it
[33:22] on my heart to participate in these
[33:25] meetings so when it looked like it
[33:27] wasn't going to happen it was a
[33:29] disappointment to me so I was very glad
[33:31] and immediately agreed because I had it
[33:35] on my heart my wife commented she said
[33:37] well you know this explains why you had
[33:39] it on your on your heart so strong and I
[33:42] said indeed it does so while you're
[33:45] standing let me invite you to st. John
[33:48] chapter six today and we're going to
[33:52] read just a few verses and I will let
[33:55] you be seated
[33:56] because we want to read a lengthy
[33:58] reading but we're gonna start in st.
[34:01] John chapter 6 verse 25 and also while
[34:06] it's on my mind I want to thank the
[34:08] technical engineering team that brother
[34:10] Hal Ray has in place they're wonderful
[34:14] wonderful brothers and my team here and
[34:16] we've worked together and so it's been a
[34:20] wonderful cooperation Amen so we're just
[34:23] trusting the Lord for it all right
[34:25] st. John chapter 6 and let's pick up
[34:29] from verse 25 and when they had found
[34:34] him on the other side of the sea they
[34:36] said unto Him rabbi when camest thou
[34:40] hither hither and and jesus answered
[34:46] them and said verily verily I say unto
[34:51] you you seek me not because you saw the
[34:54] miracles but because you did eat of the
[34:57] loaves and were filled labor not for the
[35:01] meat which perisheth but for that meat
[35:04] which endureth unto everlasting life
[35:07] which the Son of man shall give unto you
[35:11] for him hath God the Father sealed a man
[35:17] let's bow our hearts in prayer Master

[35:25] trusting completely in you Lord we have
[35:30] done all that we can do to prepare Lord

[36:47] all of this possible we commit the
[36:49] balance of it now into your hands into
[36:52] your keeping in jesus name a man i want
[36:59] to continue reading in our passage from
[37:05] st. john chapter 6 let's carry on in
[37:08] verse 28 then said they and what shall
[37:14] we do that we might work the works of
[37:17] jesus answered and said unto them this
[37:19] is the work of God that you believe on
[37:23] Him whom he hath sent now I want to
[37:30] speak along tonight on a series that I
[37:34] preached at home here only and the Lord
[37:38] has it heavily on my heart even as I was
[37:40] going through it I knew I would preach
[37:43] it again somewhere soon and we want to
[37:46] take a thought tonight on the
[37:48] approaching time of the resurrection
[37:52] and I want to take as a subtitle tonight
[37:55] at least on this portion of it tonight
[37:58] a subtitle God being misunderstood
[38:06] is there in the in st. John's
[38:14] you
[38:24] with what he's doing there they're
[38:28] coming across they you know he had left
[38:31] secretly crossed the Sea of Galilee
[38:33] there they're come back to the meeting
[38:35] place where he had been the day before
[38:37] he's not there they're hunting for him
[38:39] he didn't tell anybody where he was
[38:40] going they finally find him they walk
[38:42] all the way around the Sea of Galilee
[38:44] and finding the next day and come to him
[38:47] and they found him on the other side you
[38:50] know Lord or where where'd you go
[38:52] why'd you leave what do you what are you
[38:53] doing here and you know they had it in
[38:56] their mind one reason why he was there
[39:00] and they had a reason why they were
[39:02] there and Jesus was very quick to get
[39:06] them to understand you've misunderstood
[39:08] why I'm here you've misunderstood why
[39:12] you should be here and you know you're
[39:15] gonna find this constantly Jesus then
[39:18] tries to steer them as as we're trying
[39:21] to do tonight to steer your hearts and
[39:24] minds to line up your life with the
[39:27] vision of God's purpose in your life
[39:30] because truly friends we are approaching
[39:32] the resurrection
[39:34] there's not another age coming God only
[39:37] had seven stars in his hand
[39:40] they've all been exhausted and the bride
[39:42] is now in fear that voice under her
[39:45] messenger that final voice to the final
[39:47] age and we realized that this can't just
[39:51] keep going on forever ever that there
[39:55] has to come a time when there's a
[39:57] completion of God's vision and I believe
[40:00] we're at it I believe that what we're
[40:03] seeing today modern events are made
[40:05] clear to us in prophecy and so you know
[40:09] he's trying to turn their understanding
[40:11] to a more clear understanding of what
[40:15] these meetings are about and said you're
[40:17] here because of the fishes and loaves
[40:19] you think this is just a social services
[40:22] program but I'm not with the government
[40:25] this is not a social services
[40:29] that I'm here to instruct you that
[40:32] you're not to labor for those things
[40:34] because those things perish but you're
[40:36] you're supposed to be here not because
[40:38] of fishes at Lowe's
[40:40] but meat that will last you forever and
[40:43] you're gonna want the bread that came
[40:45] down from heaven and you shouldn't labor
[40:48] for that which passes away but you
[40:51] should labor for that meat which
[40:55] endureth unto everlasting life now he
[40:59] goes down and begins to refer to his
[41:01] ministry of the Son of Man the father
[41:04] hath sealed God the Father has sealed
[41:06] and now there now here comes their
[41:09] second misunderstanding then said they
[41:12] unto Him okay
[41:13] fine then what shall we do that we might
[41:16] do the works of God
[41:18] now catch you can stay there Arthur
[41:20] misunderstanding still and Jesus has got
[41:23] a shock on my sleeve these are the works
[41:26] here's the works that you're supposed to
[41:28] do believe on Him whom he has sent
[41:31] that's not the answer they were
[41:34] expecting and that's not the answer many
[41:36] people look for today they try to think
[41:40] of some work that they can earn their
[41:42] way into heaven by they they have some
[41:44] type of program they they have some type
[41:46] of activity I remember you know just a
[41:50] personal way of personal testimony it's
[41:51] not in my notes but it comes to me now
[41:54] times total in my church a number of
[41:55] times some years ago I was you know
[41:59] praying and asking the Lord and saying
[42:01] lord I it just feels to me like I need
[42:04] to do more for you and I I started
[42:06] coming up in my mind just started
[42:08] brainstorming in my mind and and I start
[42:10] I could do this and I could have this
[42:12] and I could go on the streets and I
[42:14] could I could go into the community and
[42:15] I could do this in the church we can
[42:17] have this program in this program and a
[42:19] program for this and a program for that
[42:20] and and I said Lorna and I remember just
[42:23] repeating it Lord I just want to do more
[42:25] I just want to do more for you and
[42:27] friends the Holy Spirit just spoke to me
[42:30] in a voice just sort of audible to my
[42:32] ears and just simply said to me I don't
[42:35] need you to do more I need you to be
[42:39] more you do
[42:41] the being and I'll do the doing was what
[42:45] God said to my heart and so you know we
[42:49] where Jesus is trying to get them to
[42:52] understand your your misunderstanding
[42:54] the intent of God in sending me I'm here
[43:01] I'm the I am the manifestation of the
[43:04] prophecies that you've studied since
[43:06] childhood I am I am the fulfillment this
[43:10] day the scripture is fulfilled and
[43:13] you're standing here looking at the
[43:16] scripture fulfilled is what Jesus was
[43:18] saying and you're worried about fishes
[43:21] and loaves and you're worried about
[43:22] doing works
[43:23] let's get first things first do you
[43:26] believe on Him whom God had sent in
[43:29] other words are you walking in the light
[43:32] as he is in the light because there is
[43:36] where the purging of our sins takes
[43:38] place he goes on you'll see this pattern
[43:42] continuing and they verse 30 they said
[43:46] therefore in him watch this must
[43:48] understand what signs show us thou then
[43:51] that we may see and believe thee what
[43:54] does that work our fathers did eat manna
[43:57] in the desert as it is written he gave
[43:59] them bread from heaven to eat now watch
[44:02] Jesus correct their misunderstanding
[44:04] then jesus said to them verily verily
[44:07] they are truly truly I say to you Moses
[44:10] gave you not that bread from heaven but
[44:12] my father giveth you the true bread from
[44:15] heaven see you you and your father's
[44:19] thought that that bread that came down
[44:22] out of heaven was God's endgame that
[44:25] wasn't even the beginning that was just
[44:28] a type that was just a shadow God only
[44:30] did that and gave you so much of it that
[44:33] you actually got sick of it they didn't
[44:36] want to admit that they didn't want to
[44:39] admit that they actually got sick of it
[44:40] and God gave them so much to prove to
[44:44] them that man does not live by bread
[44:46] alone you can see that God was trying to
[44:49] get Israel to understand what
[44:52] Jesus is now trying to get them to
[44:53] understand and so he says they said in
[44:57] him Lord evermore give us this bread and
[44:59] Jesus said unto them I am the bread of
[45:03] life he that cometh to me shall never
[45:05] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[45:07] never thirst but I said unto you that he
[45:10] also have seen me and believe not all
[45:13] that the father giveth me shall come to
[45:15] me and him that cometh to me I will in
[45:17] no wise cast out watching watched him
[45:21] declare his purpose Frank came down from
[45:24] heaven not to do my own will but the
[45:29] will of him that sent me and this is the
[45:34] Father's will which hath sent me that
[45:37] all of which he hath given me I should
[45:39] lose nothing but should raise it up
[45:42] again at the last day and this is the
[45:45] will of him that sent me that everyone
[45:47] who would see it the Son and believeth
[45:49] on him may have everlasting life and I
[45:51] will raise him up at the last day and I
[45:53] watch the Jews began to murmur at him
[45:56] because he said I am the bread which
[45:58] came down from heaven and they said is
[46:00] not this Jesus the Son of Joseph whose
[46:03] father and mother we know now that was
[46:08] 100% accurate and a 100 percent
[46:12] misunderstanding and so he says so
[46:16] they's and they said and hath learned
[46:21] every man there I look at my place um
[46:25] how is it that he's death I came down
[46:28] from heaven verse 43 jesus therefore
[46:30] answered and said to them murmur not
[46:31] among yourselves no man can come to me
[46:34] except the Father which hath sent me
[46:36] draw him and I'll raise him up in the
[46:37] last day it is written in the prophets
[46:39] and they shall all be taught of God
[46:42] every man therefore that hath heard and
[46:44] hath learned of the Father cometh unto
[46:46] me not that any man hath seen the father
[46:48] save he which is of God he hath seen the
[46:51] father truly truly I say in you he that
[46:55] believeth on me hath everlasting life I
[46:58] am that Bread of Life now watch him
[47:00] correct watch him try
[47:02] to bring and correct their
[47:03] misunderstanding your father's he says
[47:07] your father's did eat men in the
[47:10] wilderness you think that was great
[47:13] there everyone dead and and and the
[47:18] language of the scripture holds out that
[47:21] he was implying a spiritual death see
[47:25] not just and he wasn't being redundant
[47:27] they already knew those men were dead
[47:29] that's not what he wasn't being
[47:30] redundant he was in that he was now
[47:32] cutting to the heart of the matter to
[47:34] say they missed the spiritual
[47:36] application of what God was doing
[47:38] through Moses they thought of it natural
[47:41] that's what you're doing that's why
[47:43] you're missing it that's what the world
[47:46] is doing today that's why they're
[47:48] missing it see and so he says and he
[47:54] says this is the bread which cometh down
[47:56] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[47:58] and not die I am The Living bread which
[48:02] came down from heaven If any man eat of
[48:04] this bread he shall live forever and the
[48:05] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[48:07] I will give toward the life of the world
[48:11] and you know that's that's what is such
[48:15] a beautiful thing that he suffered in
[48:18] his flesh which which means then that he
[48:22] was certainly a man but as brother
[48:25] Brennan would say he was more than a man
[48:27] he was the god man because the greatest
[48:30] penalty that could come upon flesh was
[48:33] physical death and so therefore Jesus
[48:36] died suffering in his flesh a physical
[48:40] death he's already suffered the worst
[48:42] penalty possible so that you through
[48:46] faith in him by the spiritual revelation
[48:49] will never have to pay that penalty in
[48:51] your debt in your necks
[48:53] now that means that no matter what you
[48:56] have ever met whatever mistake you made
[48:58] however your flesh came into the earth
[49:00] and whatever a bad deeds this flesh
[49:03] committed in the past to the a tomorrow
[49:06] they're all met in the suffering and
[49:09] Lord Jesus Christ and therefore there is
[49:14] the Paul said nothing can separate me
[49:18] not famine or fear peril or sword
[49:21] there's nothing Paul even though Paul
[49:24] even would say you know even even I
[49:27] myself even me can't separate me from
[49:31] the love of God which was in Christ so
[49:35] he goes on he says now so the Jews verse
[49:42] 52 the Jews therefore strove among
[49:45] themselves saying how can this man give
[49:48] us his flesh to eat sadness
[49:51] understanding constantly mankind is
[49:55] constantly misunderstanding God this is
[49:59] why brother Brennan would say he's
[50:00] always able to thank God for what he has
[50:04] done and praise him for what he is doing
[50:08] will do but miss what he's doing right
[50:12] now because he's always misunderstanding
[50:15] what God's intention and purposes and
[50:19] therefore he doesn't understand God's
[50:20] actions see all right so that's why the
[50:23] Bible would say to Israel God showed his
[50:26] acts they saw his history but to Moses
[50:29] he showed its ways and that's what the
[50:31] Holy Ghost that's the purpose of the
[50:33] Holy Ghost so that to bringing you into
[50:36] a into a relationship with the ways of
[50:39] God with the mind of Christ all right so
[50:45] there these people without that are
[50:48] constantly misunderstanding his history
[50:52] his daily activities they miss their
[50:55] misunderstanding his words now listen
[50:57] friends this is not a history lesson
[50:59] tonight you're only sitting a parallel
[51:01] look the day an hour that you live in
[51:03] this brightest is misunderstood brother
[51:06] Branham was one of the mists most
[51:08] misunderstood men he says that
[51:09] constantly I'm so misunderstood he said
[51:12] everybody thinks I'm against people he
[51:14] said I'm if they only know I'm for
[51:16] people see so he goes on he's not gonna
[51:21] he's not going to up
[51:23] you know he's not going to take his foot
[51:26] off of the accelerator he's actually
[51:29] going to press him harder who burst 54
[51:33] verse 53 jesus saith unto them truly
[51:36] verily verily I say to you except you
[51:38] eat the flesh to the Son of man and
[51:39] drink his blood you have no life in you
[51:42] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[51:44] blood hath eternal life and I will
[51:45] raised him up at the last day for my
[51:47] flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[51:49] drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[51:52] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[51:54] in him as the living father had sent me
[51:56] an island by the father so he that
[51:58] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[52:02] is that bread which came down from
[52:04] heaven not as your father's did eat
[52:07] manna and our dead he that eateth of
[52:10] this bread shall live forever
[52:13] these things said he and the synagogue
[52:17] as he taught in Capernaum so we find
[52:22] then that people are constantly
[52:25] misunderstanding they misunderstood
[52:28] Jesus when this is interesting I want
[52:31] you to watch this now to show you the
[52:33] the futility of trying to know God
[52:36] through knowledge through man knowledge
[52:40] because these people are it's one thing
[52:44] that they misunderstood God's Word in
[52:47] the Old Testament because he was showing
[52:50] things in type and shadow but now he's
[52:53] coming in the in the visible
[52:55] manifestation now he's right there in
[52:57] real time in living color they can talk
[53:02] to him
[53:02] they can touch him they have him
[53:04] standing there in the flesh when and
[53:09] with it standing there in the flesh they
[53:11] have every opportunity to question him
[53:14] to the right to the face
[53:16] they they can gauge his attitude they
[53:19] can catch the slightest infliction in
[53:22] his voice well he adds emphasis to what
[53:25] he pulls back on what he says forcefully
[53:27] they can gauge his attitude gauges
[53:30] spirit scenes expression here is
[53:32] inflection questioning back and forth
[53:34] asking for
[53:35] clarity and yet even with that they're
[53:41] constantly constantly misunderstanding
[53:46] you know we we we wondered today how can
[53:50] God send a message that we see it as so
[53:54] plainly this we hear those prophets
[53:58] words and and I have said around the
[54:01] world had preached this message on six
[54:03] of the seven continents of the world and
[54:05] I've challenged the world for years
[54:07] bring me even a single doctrinal
[54:09] teaching of William Branham and prove
[54:11] and disprove it by the Bible anyone very
[54:15] few of even attempted it and it's I've
[54:17] never had anyone successfully able to do
[54:20] it because we didn't we haven't believed
[54:22] cunningly devised tales this wasn't some
[54:25] man-made idea the world had had that for
[54:27] thousands of years God wasn't gonna send
[54:30] a prettier God was gonna send a coffin
[54:33] that he could a night and speak through
[54:35] and yet the world doesn't understand it
[54:38] and we hear and we look at it and we
[54:40] compare it and it makes perfect sense to
[54:43] me I believe the message and I I'm not
[54:51] even able to question William Brett the
[54:54] same way I believe the Gospels
[54:56] I'm not even Mable to question John who
[54:59] wrote it but Luke who pendant or Matthew
[55:01] or mark I'm not here to I can't question
[55:03] the Lord Jesus like these men did they
[55:06] could question him in real time the only
[55:08] way I can speak to him is in prayer and
[55:10] I find that as a far more successful way
[55:14] that's how Paul contact they constantly
[55:18] misunderstood a man who he was that's
[55:23] huge they misunderstood who he was maybe
[55:27] they misunderstood why he came and the
[55:35] enormous ly all-important issue of what
[55:42] it meant for their lives going forward
[55:46] let me say it again it's one thing that
[55:48] they misunderstood who he was they
[55:52] misunderstood why he was here but more
[55:56] importantly than that is they
[55:59] misunderstood what it meant for them
[56:02] going forward in their journey of life
[56:08] as I go on in this series I'm gonna take
[56:11] the topic journey to the resurrection
[56:15] we're now in the approaching time of the
[56:17] resurrection on this journey friends you
[56:20] can ill afford to misunderstand what
[56:23] he's doing you can ill afford to
[56:25] misunderstand your purpose in being here
[56:28] and why you are a believer say I'm a
[56:31] believer well I'm a believer because I
[56:33] believe it will do you think you had the
[56:35] ability to believe it on your own I tell
[56:37] you not according to scripture then if
[56:39] God has so graciously revealed this
[56:42] truth to you you need to ask yourself
[56:45] the question I want me the answer is
[56:48] gonna be because he loves you then
[56:50] you're right then your next questions to
[56:51] me what can I do Lord what do you need
[56:54] me to do Lord Jesus and it's gonna start
[56:58] out with believing him on whom God has
[57:01] sent it's not all about not doing more
[57:05] it's about becoming more because the
[57:09] real secret to the supernatural is
[57:11] always to relax the real secret to the
[57:15] supernatural that that Jesus brother
[57:17] Brandon would use language that Jesus
[57:19] operated in a world all his own he he
[57:23] had a he understood and he would even
[57:25] say to them you know we don't understand
[57:28] everything you're doing even his
[57:30] disciples didn't understand everything
[57:31] he said they would you know they would
[57:34] hear him say something and and they
[57:36] would misunderstand oh he needs because
[57:38] we didn't bring any bread he would turn
[57:39] around and say you know where's your
[57:41] faith that because you you think I'm
[57:44] meaning because I said they wherever the
[57:46] leaven of the Pharisees and you think
[57:47] that means because you forgot to pack
[57:49] lunch see GN and when they questioned
[57:55] him brother Branham said they they come
[57:57] and questioned him how I said that you
[57:58] come with all this power
[57:59] and we've already seen you raise dead
[58:02] people we've already seen you we do we
[58:05] know you can turn water into wine
[58:08] we know you discern the secrets of the
[58:10] heart we can see Nicodemus confessed it
[58:14] we know you're of God because you have
[58:17] the sign of Melchizedek that's we
[58:20] haven't seen that since Genesis where
[58:22] somebody could literally discern the
[58:25] secrets of a man's heart and speak it
[58:27] right out to it so we know you're sent
[58:31] from God for no one could do the things
[58:33] you're doing
[58:34] except he be of God and they say so you
[58:39] know why would you come to thee to the
[58:43] pool and hears all kinds of sick people
[58:46] with critical serious cases good people
[58:50] and you literally step over sick people
[58:54] probably sick children sick women sick
[58:57] sick old men and you come and you step
[59:01] over sick people and you come to one man
[59:04] who's really nothing all that sick you
[59:08] healing and you step back over sick
[59:11] people and leave now you just put
[59:15] yourself in the place those people that
[59:16] would be quite amazing yeah when you
[59:19] knew when you believe who this man was
[59:20] and yet you saw him do something but
[59:22] watch Jesus give a real key to his
[59:25] understanding of why he was here and he
[59:28] says when they asked him he says the son
[59:31] can do nothing the son do with nothing
[59:34] but what he sees the father doing so you
[59:38] know we there there's a whole lot of
[59:40] thing about a spoken word and the third
[59:43] pull and speaking the word and creating
[59:45] things and speaking to tumors and and
[59:48] speaking children and and speaking
[59:50] storms away you know what is it it
[59:54] wasn't then in the days of Jesus Jesus
[59:57] didn't walk around deciding who to heal
[1:00:00] what to say what to preach what miracles
[1:00:02] to do he operated perfectly by a vision
[1:00:06] it wasn't here you're talking about a
[1:00:08] person that were
[1:00:10] so surrendered to God so completely
[1:00:16] surrendered to God that he had he had
[1:00:19] sacrificed all of his will
[1:00:22] he was only being led of the father and
[1:00:25] I will tell you something friends as we
[1:00:27] approached this time of the Resurrection
[1:00:30] and that ought to be rig one of the
[1:00:33] things that we see returning with such
[1:00:36] fervency in the heart of the people that
[1:00:38] to have their life organized in such a
[1:00:41] way a prayer and dedication and
[1:00:44] disciplines before God and then our
[1:00:47] whole heart of their whole bank should
[1:00:49] just be Lord I'm not here for my
[1:00:51] purposes I got a job I got a family and
[1:00:54] a career Shore I'm gonna take vacations
[1:00:57] but none of that's why I'm here that's
[1:01:00] all going to go to ash and cinder why am
[1:01:03] I really here and what ever is that
[1:01:05] reason that's what I want to be about
[1:01:07] the Father's business it's not me
[1:01:11] deciding what to do what to speak who
[1:01:15] who to pray for even who'd even witness
[1:01:18] to what to say stay where we are humble
[1:01:23] before the Lord it's in a simplicity
[1:01:25] here you'll hear brother Brown say that
[1:01:27] shortly here in a minute so here they
[1:01:31] were and they failed to see who it was
[1:01:36] why he'd come what it meant for them in
[1:01:40] their journey even though they had him
[1:01:42] standing there in real time
[1:01:45] I thought to myself if they still
[1:01:49] weren't getting it and they had him
[1:01:52] there in the flesh
[1:01:54] they had him there where they could
[1:01:56] handle him
[1:01:58] Hoss Paul says that we we handled Peter
[1:02:02] talks about that we handled him John
[1:02:04] makes it so clear this was God we
[1:02:08] handled him we saw him when I was there
[1:02:12] Peter said I am the witness I was on the
[1:02:14] Mount I heard what he said and and you
[1:02:18] find that people who were
[1:02:21] misunderstanding and even that they say
[1:02:23] well but I've got a gene of God well so
[1:02:25] did the disciples but they constantly
[1:02:28] misunderstood him
[1:02:29] even on the Mount of Olives after his
[1:02:32] resurrection they still don't have it
[1:02:34] there's still don't get it there
[1:02:36] now they're saying okay okay finally I
[1:02:38] get it we kind of let sideways there we
[1:02:41] we messed up we didn't really understand
[1:02:43] what's all about you know you said you
[1:02:44] were gonna be crucified when we fought
[1:02:46] against it we said no way you know Peter
[1:02:48] said I'll never allow that to happen no
[1:02:50] you're not gonna wash my feet and Jesus
[1:02:52] is constantly having to correct those
[1:02:54] errors and bring them along and bring
[1:02:57] him home and you know finally they they
[1:03:00] they he's golf the scene and Peter's
[1:03:04] gotta go back fishing and the Cleopas
[1:03:06] gonna head home on the road to emmaus
[1:03:08] in' and you know what the whole church
[1:03:10] is broke up and they're all sad and
[1:03:14] Jesus steps out on the path why you said
[1:03:17] yeah why he said and and they said what
[1:03:22] are you a stranger you haven't heard the
[1:03:25] things that have happened and Jesus said
[1:03:27] what things now he wasn't that wasn't
[1:03:31] dis Jesus playing ignorant Jesus was
[1:03:35] trying to oh of Jesus of Nazareth and
[1:03:38] they we thought it would be the Messiah
[1:03:39] and they took him in Quixote man so now
[1:03:41] the filler day and some crazy women said
[1:03:42] he's all raised from the tomb and and
[1:03:44] you know but Jesus point is still the
[1:03:47] same like I said what things you think
[1:03:51] those are things what you think we're
[1:03:54] things was nothing but God's will what
[1:03:57] you are blown away by what you are
[1:03:59] crippled in your minds you're fools and
[1:04:03] slow of heart to believe all the
[1:04:05] prophets have said
[1:04:06] how is it that a prophet said that's
[1:04:09] what would happen you saw happen and you
[1:04:11] you're-you're you're saying have you not
[1:04:13] heard the things that have happened and
[1:04:14] I'm telling you what things well this
[1:04:17] this this yet exactly what I said what
[1:04:19] things because the things you're
[1:04:22] referring to you're in the perfect will
[1:04:24] of God
[1:04:25] listen France this world has gone crazy
[1:04:28] and we're all here much longer than we
[1:04:31] ever thought we would be my father I you
[1:04:34] know my dad and my mom were in the
[1:04:36] meetings and how many times I would
[1:04:38] question my dad before he went on to his
[1:04:40] reward and I would say dad you know back
[1:04:42] there in those days you know you surely
[1:04:45] never thought it would be 50 60 almost
[1:04:48] 60 years later and my dad would say
[1:04:51] goodness no he said I didn't even think
[1:04:53] my kids would have to go to school and
[1:04:55] not only did my kids go to school their
[1:04:57] kids went to school and their kids are
[1:04:59] in school and you know he's got children
[1:05:03] grandchildren great-grandchildren and
[1:05:06] we're still here and in the world is
[1:05:09] only getting worse
[1:05:10] and what they even what they thought
[1:05:12] back in the 1960s you know when twin
[1:05:15] brother Brandon would talk about a world
[1:05:17] following a pardon and and rampant
[1:05:20] perversion on the street we all know
[1:05:22] friends that was kindergarten compared
[1:05:25] to what we're facing now it was child's
[1:05:28] play of Cub Scouts compared to what
[1:05:30] we're facing now none of us expected to
[1:05:32] still be here but you know what here we
[1:05:34] are and I will imagine that the devil
[1:05:37] has a hard time figuring out how we're
[1:05:39] still believers but we are I don't I
[1:05:43] don't fully understand why I'm still
[1:05:44] here I know this God's got it all in his
[1:05:47] control I know this my life was booked
[1:05:50] for a purpose I know I was placed here
[1:05:52] for a reason I'm trying to walk in the
[1:05:56] vision it doesn't matter to me what it
[1:05:58] is so long as I'm in the vision God has
[1:06:01] for my life if it's another 50 years if
[1:06:04] it doesn't come in my lifetime I believe
[1:06:06] it will
[1:06:06] I believe the raptures coming in my
[1:06:08] lifetime I believe I'm going in the
[1:06:10] rapture and there's nothing I can do to
[1:06:12] stop
[1:06:13] because I caught a vision come into the
[1:06:18] mind of Christ I'm not questioning his
[1:06:21] actions any law doesn't matter to me
[1:06:24] what the devil does I've stopped caring
[1:06:26] about it a long time ago this world
[1:06:29] means very little to me I see myself as
[1:06:32] having only one purpose of any value at
[1:06:34] all and that is that I may know him and
[1:06:37] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:06:40] Fellowship of his sufferings of need me
[1:06:43] hallelujah they failed to see the true
[1:06:50] meaning and purpose of God they had
[1:06:54] failed to see it since the days of Moses
[1:06:57] to that very hour and they still weren't
[1:06:59] getting if that's true and it is if they
[1:07:07] failed to see it
[1:07:09] including disciples misunderstood and
[1:07:12] they catch him on the Mount of Olives
[1:07:14] before the Ascension they say okay
[1:07:16] finally you know they come to one point
[1:07:19] in his earthly ministry they say Lord
[1:07:21] now we believe and Jesus said do you
[1:07:24] finally now believe and they catch him
[1:07:27] on them on the Mount of Olives okay we
[1:07:30] get it
[1:07:30] yeah we misunderstood it we can't have
[1:07:32] that wrong okay okay okay now we're all
[1:07:34] back it's all good
[1:07:35] okay now now okay now okay now will you
[1:07:39] restore the kingdom I understand we're
[1:07:42] trying to run ahead of the picture and I
[1:07:43] was against your crucifixion and all I
[1:07:45] don't know yeah we were fools and slow
[1:07:46] hard we didn't I can ran for the hills
[1:07:48] and but you know but now will you now
[1:07:51] restore the kingdom and Jesus says
[1:07:55] fellas
[1:07:56] you're still not he's still not said you
[1:08:01] know do you really think that God that
[1:08:04] God's plan was to stay bottled up and
[1:08:07] one body walking the shores of Galilee
[1:08:09] going about doing good is that what you
[1:08:12] think his plan it was didn't I tell you
[1:08:14] that except the corn of wheat died
[1:08:16] abideth alone yeah what do you think
[1:08:19] that was about that I said if it if it
[1:08:21] died then it can bring forth many don't
[1:08:23] you on
[1:08:24] stand that that I'm only the beginning
[1:08:27] of the creation of God don't you
[1:08:30] understand that I'm the prototype that I
[1:08:32] and I'm the firstborn among many
[1:08:33] brethren here's what's gonna happen
[1:08:36] you're gonna tarry in Jerusalem till you
[1:08:39] be endued with power as far as my coming
[1:08:41] that's in the father's hand the kingdom
[1:08:43] gets restored that's in God's hand I
[1:08:45] don't even know when that's gonna happen
[1:08:47] but you're gonna receive power after
[1:08:50] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[1:08:53] you're gonna be a witness unto me in
[1:08:54] Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the other
[1:08:56] most part of the earth you know it's
[1:09:01] interesting to me I read there where
[1:09:03] Paul talks about there's better than 500
[1:09:05] people heard that sermon by the time 10
[1:09:09] days in the upper room there's only 120
[1:09:12] people now I don't know what happened 80
[1:09:14] people I don't know if they have too
[1:09:16] often been like us and get a little too
[1:09:18] impatient
[1:09:19] you know like us and miss out on the
[1:09:22] opportunities that God has I don't know
[1:09:23] surely if they were God's family God got
[1:09:26] a hold of it later I know that after
[1:09:28] that day 3,000 more came in and you
[1:09:30] don't come in you don't have a church
[1:09:32] till the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:09:33] don't have the body of Christ to the
[1:09:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost and so we
[1:09:38] realized then that when they call that
[1:09:39] that in doing power then now watch when
[1:09:43] they come out on and they come rolling
[1:09:45] out and down the steps and out the
[1:09:47] windows and into the streets and then
[1:09:48] the people are still misunderstanding
[1:09:51] them they say you're drunk but now
[1:09:55] Peters got something more than he used
[1:09:57] to have you're not saying no you're
[1:10:00] misunderstanding the plan of God we're
[1:10:03] not drunk like you think this is
[1:10:05] Scripture this is prophecy we are now
[1:10:09] you have a hard time hearing Jesus
[1:10:11] what's the living bread guess what now
[1:10:14] there's a hundred and twenty Jesus is
[1:10:16] watching her and by the time he got done
[1:10:19] preaching and they have a baptism 3,000
[1:10:23] more Jesus this water this is the
[1:10:28] message of the hour that came to us in
[1:10:32] our day
[1:10:35] came to restore us back to that to pick
[1:10:41] up that church began to decline and the
[1:10:44] and the message of the hour comes at the
[1:10:48] end time to to come to that cresting
[1:10:51] over point that apex were they begin to
[1:10:53] decline to picked it up from there and
[1:10:55] move us on into the resurrection that
[1:10:58] was promised in this last day so the
[1:11:03] question then is is so loud and so
[1:11:06] obvious should be obvious to us all to
[1:11:09] ask ourselves today if they including
[1:11:14] including his own elected children if
[1:11:18] they misunderstood him when they had him
[1:11:21] in real time in the flesh and could
[1:11:24] question him and hear its inflections
[1:11:25] and catch his attitude and even if they
[1:11:28] were the gene of God and if they could
[1:11:31] misunderstand him in the flesh
[1:11:33] how do you ever expect to understand his
[1:11:37] movements and you don't even have the
[1:11:40] opportunity to see him in the flesh so
[1:11:44] how do you have a chance if you don't
[1:11:46] have a life activated by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:49] and how even if you're born again of the
[1:11:52] Spirit of God say I've had an experience
[1:11:53] 35 years ago fine where is it tonight
[1:11:56] because there has to be like Jesus
[1:11:59] there's got to be that continual your
[1:12:01] Jesus didn't save you and say okay
[1:12:04] you're saved
[1:12:05] see you in the rapture that's not why
[1:12:08] I'm saved you didn't save your friends
[1:12:11] just to keep you from destruction he
[1:12:13] puts you into the body for a purpose I
[1:12:17] got elements on my body and they have a
[1:12:19] purpose how do we hope to really get our
[1:12:30] own life's purpose and direction how do
[1:12:34] we expect to understand it without a
[1:12:38] passion of an in deep relationship with
[1:12:41] a person of Christ in his word ask
[1:12:43] yourselves that question at the start of
[1:12:46] these meetings my friends you sitting
[1:12:48] your homes you know we but they already
[1:12:51] didn't have a vision just uh you know
[1:12:54] we're gonna have some services and we're
[1:12:56] gonna hear some preaching and understand
[1:12:57] some doctrine that's not what it's about
[1:12:59] we're on a journey we're here for a
[1:13:02] reason we're going somewhere I'm glad
[1:13:05] because this world is not surviving and
[1:13:08] I'm ready to move on to the next one
[1:13:11] there's got to be that element down in
[1:13:14] our lives where we take a hold of that
[1:13:16] purpose of God and you know I've said
[1:13:20] many times that yes we are waiting on
[1:13:23] the old ship of Zion but the Lord never
[1:13:25] told us to go down to the docks and sit
[1:13:27] on our luggage it's not what its devour
[1:13:30] uh Jesus would even say the fields are
[1:13:34] ripe in the harvest but the laborers are
[1:13:36] few that's the problem
[1:13:38] pray in the Lord of the harvest that he
[1:13:40] send forth laborers and brother Brennan
[1:13:41] says how interesting he he was the Lord
[1:13:44] of the harvest and he's saying to them
[1:13:46] pray to the Lord of the harvest what
[1:13:47] he's saying to them is listen I want to
[1:13:49] do this but I need you to ask me do you
[1:13:51] understand I want you involved you
[1:13:54] understand that I want my words to speak
[1:13:57] through your words I want I have I'm not
[1:13:59] gonna use my feet my feet are never
[1:14:02] gonna touch this ground until I come
[1:14:04] riding out in revelation 19 and set my
[1:14:07] feet on the earth at last to take it
[1:14:10] back over and rebuild it for a
[1:14:12] millennial world but my feet are gonna
[1:14:14] be your feet my hands are gonna be your
[1:14:18] hands my lips are gonna be your lips and
[1:14:22] you're never going to walk where he
[1:14:24] wants you to handle what he needs you to
[1:14:26] setting' what he desires you to unless
[1:14:29] he is down deep inside in the control
[1:14:31] tower
[1:14:32] you'll you'll you'll walk your own steps
[1:14:35] in your own way and handle your own
[1:14:36] things and say your own words and come
[1:14:38] to your own conclusions and I promise
[1:14:40] you your life will your journey will be
[1:14:43] a million miles away from the vision God
[1:14:45] had for you brother Branham said I'm the
[1:14:49] most misunderstood man it's a minister
[1:14:53] he he you know he he comes in in 1962
[1:14:59] and he's
[1:15:01] he's desiring he's coming to the pulpit
[1:15:03] he's desiring to teach the church about
[1:15:06] endtime evangelism he wants to preach it
[1:15:09] as a sermon but he says I can't preach
[1:15:11] it tonight I'm gonna have to wait he
[1:15:13] doesn't get it for another week he said
[1:15:15] I'm gonna take questions and answers
[1:15:17] tonight because you know he said I've
[1:15:19] been so misunderstood he says you know a
[1:15:23] man tells the story about a man came to
[1:15:25] him you know brother Branham on it the
[1:15:27] doctor says I need to have a surgery and
[1:15:29] but now brother Branham I'm so sure that
[1:15:32] you know the coming of the Lord is so
[1:15:34] imminent maybe I don't need to have that
[1:15:36] surgery what do you think for the bill
[1:15:38] brother Branham it discouraged him
[1:15:42] well the Branham says it made me feel
[1:15:44] real bad he said I thought have I have I
[1:15:49] not been clear have I been so unclear
[1:15:53] that he said don't you people realize
[1:15:55] that I don't know when he's coming he he
[1:15:58] may not come for another thousand years
[1:16:00] yet he may come in the morning he may
[1:16:03] come before the end of the service he
[1:16:05] said no one knows when he's coming it
[1:16:08] was so important to them that they don't
[1:16:10] that they don't just check out because
[1:16:14] listen friends if we were going to check
[1:16:17] out at the level of the craziness of the
[1:16:21] world they had fifty years ago we
[1:16:24] wouldn't even be in the game at this
[1:16:25] point I'm here to tell you the world is
[1:16:28] probably fifty thousand times more evil
[1:16:31] and more wicked and the lid had just
[1:16:33] been torn off of Helen and brother
[1:16:35] branham's day we find it today friends
[1:16:37] that everything that used to be right is
[1:16:39] now thought of as wrong and everything
[1:16:41] that used to be wrong is now thought of
[1:16:43] us not only right but normal advisable
[1:16:46] and it's recommended and if you don't go
[1:16:49] along with it it now comes your
[1:16:50] persecution so we're literally facing
[1:16:54] criticism because we're not crazy you're
[1:17:01] literally facing the the angst of the
[1:17:04] world and there what's with you people
[1:17:06] know yeah you're caught you don't even
[1:17:09] believe in same-sex marriage you must be
[1:17:11] a caught
[1:17:14] and sometimes I I hear their arguments
[1:17:16] and I just say have I just died and gone
[1:17:19] to some other parallel universe how is
[1:17:22] it that the church for 2000 years
[1:17:25] understood the scripture to mean this
[1:17:27] and that doesn't mean that anymore
[1:17:29] or it means this about families and
[1:17:31] marriage and women and men and children
[1:17:32] and this is how it is how we always
[1:17:35] believed it was and now because I'm
[1:17:38] still believing how it was and I'm not
[1:17:42] I'm not subscribing to your upside down
[1:17:45] and side out theories of what's right
[1:17:48] and wrong and you know as far as the
[1:17:52] world is concerned there's nothing right
[1:17:54] and wrong it's all relative
[1:17:56] well it's not true there's a writing
[1:18:01] those are wrong if if there was no God
[1:18:04] then there would be no right or wrong it
[1:18:06] would just be every man's opinion but
[1:18:08] because he is then there's a right and
[1:18:11] there's a wrong if you believe he is you
[1:18:16] cannot dismiss right and wrong and I
[1:18:19] certainly believe he is and brother
[1:18:22] branham he he comes to you know he's
[1:18:27] trying to say I'm so misunderstood and
[1:18:30] you know the world it's it's amazing
[1:18:33] that the things that get said about him
[1:18:35] ah in the day and hour that we live in
[1:18:38] and you know I I just say wow what a
[1:18:42] misunderstanding of such a lovely man a
[1:18:44] man who loved people man who gave his
[1:18:48] life to the gospel of man who refused
[1:18:51] fortune and glory over and over and over
[1:18:54] again and a man who literally literally
[1:19:00] he he he went home he had his his fatal
[1:19:05] accident on his way to serve the Lord in
[1:19:08] another set of series of meetings this
[1:19:12] was a man who would roll in one side of
[1:19:14] the bed just long enough to roll off the
[1:19:16] other side and and going and going and
[1:19:20] going and and the things that he went
[1:19:22] through and the world they the world of
[1:19:24] things and they make all kinds of
[1:19:26] horrible accusations and and yet none of
[1:19:29] his critics back in that day ever
[1:19:31] criticized him in that way even people
[1:19:34] who disagreed with his doctor no one
[1:19:36] questioned his character no one
[1:19:38] questioned him hit him as a man as a
[1:19:40] Christian and you know it becomes
[1:19:43] ridiculous to the end of stupidity today
[1:19:46] some of the things that they they've
[1:19:48] misunderstood a man who loved people I
[1:19:51] think it's sad it's a sad reality and
[1:19:55] you know sometimes I say Lord you have
[1:19:58] mercy we haven't always represented this
[1:20:00] thing right I mean come on let's just
[1:20:02] admit that we haven't always represented
[1:20:04] this thing I just say Lord God that way
[1:20:08] however if I've failed that it got me
[1:20:10] tonight got me tonight today help me on
[1:20:14] this day to say from this hour at Easter
[1:20:17] time in 2020 I'm gonna get with the
[1:20:21] vision I'm gonna allow my life to come
[1:20:23] into the cycle of what God has I believe
[1:20:27] that I'm approaching the resurrection to
[1:20:31] time to be deadly serious he talks about
[1:20:39] a sign and a voice and I I don't want to
[1:20:41] get down into the trenches of it too too
[1:20:44] deeply but he talks about how there had
[1:20:47] to be a sign of a voice and you know he
[1:20:50] goes back to Abraham Abraham had the
[1:20:51] sign that was one thing you know but
[1:20:54] then there was a voice with it John saw
[1:20:56] a pillar of fire but it was a message
[1:20:58] with it so he doesn't that's not just if
[1:21:01] you have a sign but then brother instead
[1:21:03] watch that voice and that's that's to me
[1:21:06] that is the comforting thing that I see
[1:21:09] in this hour I've seen ministries with
[1:21:11] supernatural signs that brother Branham
[1:21:14] wasn't the only man who got people
[1:21:17] healed in his prayer life but if there's
[1:21:19] even people impersonate a profit and do
[1:21:22] discernment with a high degree of
[1:21:24] accuracy that's not a that's not what
[1:21:28] it's about
[1:21:28] there's people who can get it prayers
[1:21:30] through but but I'm so thankful today
[1:21:33] that I'm not following a sign of
[1:21:35] following a voice
[1:21:37] the sign was only to get my attention it
[1:21:40] was just an attraction on the mountain
[1:21:42] but what followed it a message that and
[1:21:45] what would how do I know the message is
[1:21:47] true because it does what the Senate
[1:21:50] would do turn me back to the faith of
[1:21:53] the Father and where witnesses and you
[1:21:58] and your homes your witnesses yes that's
[1:22:01] what this message has done it has
[1:22:03] literally turned me back to an
[1:22:05] old-fashioned believer it has turned me
[1:22:07] back to someone who believes every word
[1:22:10] of God and my faith even sir even in
[1:22:12] tunnels beyond my understanding I even
[1:22:15] believe things but my faith is perfect
[1:22:19] in his word other balances don't fail to
[1:22:23] see that sign and the voice of the sign
[1:22:27] in 1964 don't fail to see that sign of a
[1:22:30] pillar of fire that God has vindicated
[1:22:32] and the voice behind it to turn back to
[1:22:35] God back to God don't let it pass you
[1:22:37] there is a sign and a voice they come
[1:22:42] and they ask him brother Branham 1963
[1:22:44] qat on the seals with the Bride of
[1:22:48] Christ have a ministry before the
[1:22:51] rapture and brother Branham says sure
[1:22:55] that's what's going on right now so
[1:22:58] what's going on right now the Bride of
[1:23:00] Christ certainly it's the message of the
[1:23:03] hour the Bride of Christ sure she
[1:23:07] consists of apostles promise teacher
[1:23:09] evangelists pastors that write the Bible
[1:23:11] thanks the Bride of Christ sure she's
[1:23:13] got a ministry great ministry the
[1:23:15] ministry of the hour but now watch it's
[1:23:17] so humble yeah amen see so they're
[1:23:21] asking when we have a ministry yes it's
[1:23:26] the Bride of Christ
[1:23:28] that's the ministry that's what the
[1:23:30] world is missing when this message came
[1:23:33] that it literally stood a people up on
[1:23:36] the earth who are the who are the bread
[1:23:38] on earth to the heavenly bridegroom
[1:23:42] and they have his voice and they have
[1:23:45] his life and they think they the signs
[1:23:48] that they perform and and the lives that
[1:23:51] they live which is even a greater sign
[1:23:53] even the greater sign I mean it's one
[1:23:56] thing it's one thing to speak a storm
[1:23:58] out of existence you might do that on a
[1:24:01] given day but how about your day-to-day
[1:24:03] life how about your everyday how about
[1:24:06] not just a day standing in Colorado or
[1:24:09] standing and praying and say you know
[1:24:12] this tumor or this not that's fine
[1:24:14] that's well well and fine what did God
[1:24:16] God showed it as a demonstration
[1:24:18] certainly fine we love that however God
[1:24:21] wants to do it but what about my day to
[1:24:23] day everyday my walking around and
[1:24:27] talking life my prayer life my testimony
[1:24:30] my witness in the world in an age I
[1:24:33] might add that is quite impossible to be
[1:24:35] that I'm gonna take something friends
[1:24:39] you're living in an age of impossibility
[1:24:41] there's no way to be an overcomer in
[1:24:44] this age it's just too wicked there's no
[1:24:46] way to do it if God had not sent a
[1:24:50] message and came with that message and
[1:24:53] put it into your heart by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] and now that word he Christ the word
[1:24:57] lives through you there's no way you
[1:24:59] could never survive this and that's why
[1:25:02] I can see people and and the yet though
[1:25:05] believers they may be children of God
[1:25:07] that he may be but I can tell you just
[1:25:09] when spending a little bit of time
[1:25:10] around and where their prayer life is I
[1:25:12] can tell you what the church habits are
[1:25:14] I don't even have to know them just hang
[1:25:17] around with them a little while because
[1:25:19] there's no way that you're gonna come
[1:25:21] into the presence of God on a regular
[1:25:23] basis and look like Leo to see it
[1:25:25] there's no way you're gonna spend
[1:25:27] quality time with the Lord there's no
[1:25:30] way you're gonna come around the
[1:25:31] fellowship with the Saints and go away
[1:25:33] not looking like that see
[1:25:39] so he says sure she's got a ministry a
[1:25:42] great ministry the ministry given of the
[1:25:45] hour it'll be so humble I've got a hurry
[1:25:51] all right I'm coming out to a I'm gonna
[1:25:54] hit my pause button we're not gonna
[1:25:55] finish as I said in the beginning this
[1:25:58] is developing a series and so I'll just
[1:26:01] hit a pause button and we'll pause and
[1:26:03] then we'll come back up tomorrow so
[1:26:07] she's got a ministry see a great
[1:26:10] ministry the ministry of the hour now
[1:26:14] it'll be so humble so that's what I was
[1:26:16] saying earlier see it's not a it's not
[1:26:18] deciding what to do but moving only by
[1:26:22] thus saith the Lord see you're it's like
[1:26:25] this I said years ago some of you know
[1:26:28] brother Branham said she has thus sayeth
[1:26:30] the Lord or she keeps still and people
[1:26:33] right away struggle ok well I know how
[1:26:36] will I know what if I get it wrong and
[1:26:38] you're acting like this is something you
[1:26:41] got to figure out and I just said I gave
[1:26:45] this example I've been in Africa I've
[1:26:48] been right near wild lions it was not
[1:26:50] fun
[1:26:51] you'd think it would be amazing but I
[1:26:53] was right near wild lions when they and
[1:26:55] they weren't even roaring at me they
[1:26:57] just from that guttural sound that came
[1:26:59] up from within them and I understood
[1:27:02] then for the first time as a brother
[1:27:03] down here a and we were standing there
[1:27:04] looking at him thankfully there was two
[1:27:06] sets of steel bars between us and
[1:27:09] there's steel bars here in a little ways
[1:27:11] and no more steel bars and then they
[1:27:12] were in a steel box behind steel bars
[1:27:14] but probably 10 10 to 12 feet away and
[1:27:17] then and and one of them looked like he
[1:27:20] was an old lion and he wasn't too
[1:27:22] interested in us but there was another
[1:27:23] one that they had caught and this guy
[1:27:25] had blood in his eyes man you could tell
[1:27:27] he had killed killed before many times
[1:27:28] and he'd come right to the edge of the
[1:27:31] cage and those eyes locked in on me and
[1:27:34] brother Donnie and he does somehow he
[1:27:37] didn't even roaring his wealth ooh and
[1:27:40] brother Donnie and I both went it
[1:27:44] literally was a physical thing something
[1:27:47] about the resonance I've always heard
[1:27:50] when a lion roars you die afraid
[1:27:52] they impair Eliza's you I experienced it
[1:27:56] all he did was just have some kind of uh
[1:27:58] some sound that he made looking at me
[1:28:01] like I want to kill you
[1:28:03] and literally brother Donnie and I both
[1:28:06] wiggled and brother Donnie said whew I'm
[1:28:10] getting out of here and we immediately
[1:28:12] walked away you know Anna and so I said
[1:28:15] this I've said you know if you were
[1:28:17] walking in the jungle and the lion
[1:28:20] walked up behind you and roared I
[1:28:22] promise you no one would have to tap you
[1:28:26] on the shoulder and say you should be
[1:28:28] afraid that's a lion no one would have
[1:28:33] to tell you no one would have to
[1:28:34] instruct you you wouldn't need a manual
[1:28:36] you wouldn't need to read a quote you
[1:28:39] wouldn't need to pray you wouldn't need
[1:28:41] to do anything it would be so real upon
[1:28:44] you I promise you fear would nearly
[1:28:47] paralyze you and when brother Branham
[1:28:49] says she has thus sayeth the Lord oh she
[1:28:51] keep still this is not this is not a
[1:28:54] Gordian knot this is not to confuse you
[1:28:56] this is not for you to struggle and
[1:28:58] worry oh goodness how well I know what
[1:29:00] if I miss it what if I don't hear it
[1:29:02] clear let me tell you something friends
[1:29:03] when the voice of God sounds it sounds
[1:29:05] like a trumpet you don't have to worry
[1:29:08] about Missy don't spend your time trying
[1:29:11] to figure out what you need to be doing
[1:29:13] spend your time getting so close to
[1:29:16] Christ that when these stakes you
[1:29:18] couldn't help but hear it go cut help
[1:29:21] but know it
[1:29:22] you couldn't have been possible for you
[1:29:24] to miss it people tried to people spend
[1:29:28] a lot of time and burn a lot of fuel
[1:29:31] trying to live overcoming lies grit
[1:29:35] their teeth and ironclad will and I'm
[1:29:37] gonna you know I'm gonna turn away and
[1:29:39] I'm gonna believe it and Jesus loves me
[1:29:42] and this I know for the Bible tells me
[1:29:44] so
[1:29:44] and and they walk around like I'm gonna
[1:29:46] win I'm gonna I'm gonna beat the devil
[1:29:48] I'm not gonna fail to that I'm not gonna
[1:29:50] fall that that's just human well I'm
[1:29:52] here to tell you get those teeth burglar
[1:29:54] punch those fists threaten the devil all
[1:29:57] you want you know
[1:29:58] you distributists retreated in his
[1:30:00] castle he'll call this door and he'll
[1:30:03] close it and he'll just wait you out and
[1:30:05] when all of that zeal and all this
[1:30:07] meeting goes away and you're months down
[1:30:09] the road and you haven't been able to be
[1:30:11] in church then you know what he does he
[1:30:12] lowers the drawbridge comes right back
[1:30:14] out and invades your whole life yeah I'm
[1:30:17] not here to use my will or my mind to
[1:30:20] try to beat him
[1:30:20] the Bible says resist the devil and he
[1:30:23] will flee from you does it
[1:30:25] but the Bible first says that you must
[1:30:28] submit yourselves to God then you resist
[1:30:31] the devil
[1:30:32] nobody ever resisted the devil without
[1:30:35] first submitting themselves to God so
[1:30:38] don't waste your time trying to build
[1:30:41] yourself up to some spiritual Superman
[1:30:43] so that you can grit your teeth and beat
[1:30:45] the devil out of your life spend your
[1:30:47] time better spend your time on your
[1:30:49] knees spend your time in the word spend
[1:30:52] your time talking to God get close to
[1:30:55] him love him he loves you this is where
[1:30:59] your strength will come from this is
[1:31:01] where your perfect understanding will
[1:31:03] come from
[1:31:07] he said anytime
[1:31:09] it's humility don't forget that he says
[1:31:14] I want to warn you again when God
[1:31:16] predicts anything great to happen the
[1:31:22] people looking so far away by the wisdom
[1:31:26] till they miss what happens yeah God
[1:31:29] says anything is great the world laughs
[1:31:31] out of that bunch of ignoramuses but
[1:31:34] when the great world and the great high
[1:31:36] church says boy that's glorious God says
[1:31:38] bunch of ignoramus
[1:31:41] so you see you have to watch so it's not
[1:31:44] unless why brother Branham would teach
[1:31:46] us it's not it's not about us making
[1:31:49] ourselves odd it's not you it's and it's
[1:31:53] not God pushing you into a mold and
[1:31:56] shoving is to a motive and then putting
[1:31:59] you in closing the mold waiting for it
[1:32:01] to take it open and open down there's a
[1:32:03] nice overcomer I brother brought him
[1:32:06] with use different language he would say
[1:32:07] it's not God pushing you through a pipe
[1:32:08] molding you
[1:32:10] it's not forming you when I am old you
[1:32:13] understand you're gonna have to overcome
[1:32:16] and it's the overcomer that God is
[1:32:19] looking for and so it's not us making
[1:32:21] ourselves odd it's rather living
[1:32:24] according to the word that the world has
[1:32:27] passed on the world has passed on it and
[1:32:29] it's left to us to believe it then this
[1:32:32] gives the true family of God the ability
[1:32:36] to see the word made manifest in
[1:32:38] realities in a real sense in the
[1:32:41] realities of God's only provided way
[1:32:43] it's the only path to surety is through
[1:32:47] that deep passionate relationship with
[1:32:50] Christ
[1:32:51] think of a think of friends think of
[1:32:54] what a benefit it is to not be fooled
[1:32:59] into thinking peace and safety think of
[1:33:04] what a payoff that's going to have that
[1:33:08] you're not going to be fooled by
[1:33:11] thinking with the world peace and safety
[1:33:14] see so he says he'll you know when he
[1:33:20] takes them to Isaiah 40 and the voice of
[1:33:24] him that cries in the wilderness prepare
[1:33:26] the way of the Lord and brother Branham
[1:33:28] says oh you know they thought when this
[1:33:30] man comes he'll point his finger he'll
[1:33:33] move mountains all the low places the
[1:33:35] ditches will be brought up that all the
[1:33:37] rough places will be smooth out boy what
[1:33:39] a misunderstanding that was see brother
[1:33:41] will plant corn and every field around
[1:33:43] here we're going to do great things when
[1:33:45] this man comes they was expecting God to
[1:33:47] take the crane and turn on it and bring
[1:33:49] the corridor down come on down the great
[1:33:51] reformer forerunner of the Messiah and
[1:33:55] as soon as he's gone they'll pull it
[1:33:57] back up and the ministries over they'll
[1:33:58] crank it down again put it right down
[1:34:00] beside the seminary say all right my
[1:34:02] beloved son walk down and tell him see
[1:34:04] Homer says when he come by whatever it
[1:34:07] happened here come a man that know none
[1:34:09] of their schools didn't have a
[1:34:11] fellowship card didn't have no
[1:34:13] credentials nobody ever knowed he went
[1:34:15] to school a day in his life
[1:34:16] you couldn't even tell by his talking he
[1:34:19] didn't he didn't even talk in the terms
[1:34:21] of ecclesiastics he talked about
[1:34:23] serpents and axes wilderness and things
[1:34:25] like that and reason he talked not in
[1:34:27] the terms of the ecclesiastical said of
[1:34:29] his day or any day see his language was
[1:34:34] humble friends this was this was a mark
[1:34:38] of the prophet that came in our day his
[1:34:39] language was humble and revealing
[1:34:42] supernatural meaning the ecclesiastical
[1:34:46] world completely overlooks it and misses
[1:34:49] it entirely I'm glad I see it says first
[1:34:56] thing you know he's standing there one
[1:34:57] day said yes he's standing in your midst
[1:34:59] see no watch he's gonna he's gonna do
[1:35:02] hit you with two things here I'm gonna
[1:35:04] close on this he's gonna he's gonna
[1:35:10] point two things you gotta be careful as
[1:35:12] I'm reading this is important to catch

[1:43:22] you twist the very thing away from the
[1:43:24] purpose its intended for you you get
[1:43:27] little peculiar thoughts and you get
[1:43:29] your own ideas about a thing and don't
[1:43:31] take your own idea just when you sit and
[1:43:34] listen to things like that say like
[1:43:36] thank you lord I'm just going to walk a
[1:43:38] little closer to you I don't have to
[1:43:42] figure it all out I just need to walk a
[1:43:44] little closer to him yeah I don't have
[1:43:47] all the answers people run themselves
[1:43:49] crazy trying to identify everything
[1:43:52] happening somehow fitting it into
[1:43:54] prophecy oh is this the tribulation is
[1:43:56] this what the Bible spoke of is this I'm
[1:43:58] here to take some friends I guarantee
[1:44:00] you this ain't no tribulation plate
[1:44:01] because I'm still here
[1:44:02] and I ain't a part of the tribulation
[1:44:04] I'm part of the first resurrection oh
[1:44:06] I'm here to take something friends you
[1:44:09] don't have to be afraid nor to run to
[1:44:10] and fro you don't need to worry about
[1:44:12] knowledge increase that's just
[1:44:14] destroying man all you need to do is
[1:44:16] move a little closer and the closer you
[1:44:18] get to God the more and then the
[1:44:20] slipstream over the vision that you will
[1:44:22] find yourself moving in seeing you you
[1:44:26] go right on do it do exactly what you're
[1:44:28] supposed to be doing see always in this
[1:44:31] wonderful don't look don't look up for
[1:44:35] some great big something just remember
[1:44:38] I'm closing now just remember the simple
[1:44:41] thing of believing what he promised we
[1:44:45] do not look for something big but in
[1:44:47] Jesus name we receive his promise that
[1:44:51] settles it that makes it over I thought
[1:44:57] to myself you know here was a prophet in
[1:45:01] our day all right let me just close my
[1:45:03] Bible and just finished with a few
[1:45:05] comments brother all right you get ready
[1:45:07] to just take back over here in just a
[1:45:09] moment let me just make these closing
[1:45:11] comments why don't you stand back with
[1:45:13] me so I'll know to stop Amen you know
[1:45:17] here
[1:45:20] here we find a profit come on the scene
[1:45:24] now watch this a moment it's just
[1:45:26] amazing as I thought about it in my mind
[1:45:29] I would have drew it out for you if we
[1:45:31] were gonna do a display but we elected
[1:45:33] not to do it to put it on the display
[1:45:36] but you've got brother branham and here
[1:45:40] he is identifying John and he's saying
[1:45:44] you know John identified but John even
[1:45:46] when he identified he also prophesied
[1:45:49] there's one among you he's coming and
[1:45:51] then when he came on the scene he said
[1:45:53] now I've got to go off the scene that's
[1:45:55] exactly what the set that the Elijah of
[1:45:57] our day did he began to identify he
[1:46:00] began to show it in the word it has to
[1:46:02] come and then when the when the seals
[1:46:04] are open and the Mighty One comes and an
[1:46:06] angel descends to give an open book then
[1:46:09] that prophet has one mission to feed
[1:46:11] that to the bride because now he's going
[1:46:14] to go off the scene because the bride
[1:46:16] isn't eating on theory she's not eating
[1:46:19] on the body of a man she's eating on the
[1:46:21] body word on the son of man you
[1:46:25] understand the gospel the met the seals
[1:46:27] weren't open to turn you into a hymn
[1:46:29] Branham the seals were open to turn you
[1:46:32] into Jesus trace hallelujah wasn't here
[1:46:36] to make William branham's out of a sin
[1:46:38] that was God's humble messenger and it
[1:46:41] was delivered and he went to his reward
[1:46:42] and he finished his course hallelujah
[1:46:46] now it's the time for the bride to move
[1:46:50] on and so now comes the question within
[1:46:52] what should we do to quit this know just
[1:46:55] keep right on going should I stop this
[1:46:57] or do that or run here or quit this no
[1:46:59] just live your life God is moving
[1:47:01] there's things going on you don't know
[1:47:03] about I promise you God is doing more in
[1:47:08] you than you are aware of Peleliu yeah
[1:47:11] God is a don't feel I don't feel like a
[1:47:14] Christian I can't overcome how this my
[1:47:16] god is going more in you than you would
[1:47:18] believe I'm here to tell you that you're
[1:47:21] standing here today as a believer when
[1:47:24] it's
[1:47:25] possible when when the world is going
[1:47:27] crazy and yet you're still a believer
[1:47:30] you're still holding to God's unchanging
[1:47:32] it you are a divine miracle walking the
[1:47:36] world hallelujah don't let the devil
[1:47:40] tell you otherwise here's a prophet
[1:47:43] standing that watch this beautiful he's
[1:47:46] using the same language having the same
[1:47:48] parallel in his ministry now you look at
[1:47:53] the Old Testament and you see thousands
[1:47:58] of years and hundreds of lives that are
[1:48:01] recorded in the Bible
[1:48:03] many many many lives recorded prophets
[1:48:07] priests Kings soldiers women old men
[1:48:14] young men children and all of their
[1:48:18] lives are a little puzzle a little piece
[1:48:22] in the puzzle that when all the pieces
[1:48:25] were put together over 4,000 years and
[1:48:29] it stood on the earth it was a man the
[1:48:32] puzzle was complete they all represented
[1:48:36] a piece in Christ when he came he was
[1:48:38] the fulfillment of all those types and
[1:48:41] shadows everything that they lived there
[1:48:43] now he comes to his prophet John now
[1:48:48] what's John John is going to come with
[1:48:51] his message to announce that someone is
[1:48:54] here prophet did that in our day John is
[1:48:59] announcing he's among you what do we do
[1:49:01] go on about your lives be humble is
[1:49:03] exactly what I probably did yeah John
[1:49:06] says okay there he is here's a prophet
[1:49:09] said he's here John says I must decrease
[1:49:12] this prophet says I must decrease he
[1:49:15] must increase he must increase and then
[1:49:19] John goes and Jesus starts his ministry
[1:49:22] and now that Ministry of Jesus is
[1:49:26] working in this ministry of a prophet
[1:49:28] you understand that when they stood in
[1:49:31] the water you had two men standing
[1:49:36] side-by-side
[1:49:37] a prophet and Christ - minun and the
[1:49:41] pillar of fire came down to identify
[1:49:44] what was happening in the word in the
[1:49:47] day an hour that you live in those both
[1:49:50] of those ministries were embodied in a
[1:49:52] single man and a single person of profit
[1:49:56] on this day of a forthcoming of Elijah
[1:49:59] where not only is he the forerunner but
[1:50:01] he's also the vessel the mighty angel
[1:50:03] begins to speak through because Jesus
[1:50:07] isn't coming in his corporal body
[1:50:09] you are his corporal body you are the
[1:50:12] body of the Lord and now Jesus lives of
[1:50:16] ministering goes three and a half years
[1:50:18] of ministry and that's exactly what this
[1:50:21] prophet and Christ operated and brother
[1:50:23] Brennan would say he's here and he's
[1:50:25] here and there'd be that pillar far same
[1:50:26] one John saw and then Jesus would go off
[1:50:30] the scene and the Holy Ghost would come
[1:50:31] into the church and bring the Jubilee
[1:50:33] along the way to Jubilee that had been
[1:50:36] prophesied in the Old Testament to come
[1:50:37] that I won't miss be above them or with
[1:50:40] them I'll be in am i well I'll take away
[1:50:41] their take their heart of stone up but
[1:50:43] give them a heart of flesh
[1:50:44] I'll live inside my family now watch and
[1:50:48] that's exactly what this opening of the
[1:50:52] seals brought back to us that original
[1:50:55] Jubilee that original abstract that
[1:50:58] original token and then you go into Paul
[1:51:01] and Paul goes many decades preaching and
[1:51:05] establishing and here is a prophet and
[1:51:08] his entire ministry was everything
[1:51:11] potahto
[1:51:13] Paul goes off the scene watch and then
[1:51:16] John is still there and John ends up on
[1:51:19] an island Padma's years after Paul's go
[1:51:21] on catches the revelation brings it back
[1:51:23] gives it to the church and here a
[1:51:25] prophet in this day do you realize that
[1:51:28] a prophet in that God seen in this day
[1:51:30] what took from the life of John and all
[1:51:33] of his ministry and the life of Jesus
[1:51:36] and his
[1:51:36] Street and the upper room and the life
[1:51:39] of Paul and the life while the Apostles
[1:51:41] and John on the island and all these
[1:51:43] decades and decades and decades it was
[1:51:45] all bottled up in a single ministry o
[1:51:48] friends what are you eating on today the
[1:51:52] body word of the Son of Man God has
[1:51:56] taken the whole thing that spanned
[1:51:58] decades and brought it down into a
[1:52:01] message that we are feeling you're
[1:52:03] literally feeding on the entire New
[1:52:06] Testament gospel hallelujah and it was
[1:52:10] in the New Testament as we promised I
[1:52:12] you shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:52:16] twinkling of an eye and here we are and
[1:52:21] here we have it and the world
[1:52:22] misunderstands it yeah I just say today
[1:52:25] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[1:52:30] blessed are your ears for they hear I
[1:52:32] tell you many wanted to see it many
[1:52:35] wanted to hear it never saw it never
[1:52:38] heard it many didn't live long enough
[1:52:40] but God came in such a way and condensed
[1:52:44] from from from the very first opening of
[1:52:48] the New Testament in the book of Matthew
[1:52:50] all the way to the last words in the
[1:52:53] last part of the book of Revelation and
[1:52:55] everything that happened in between has
[1:52:57] to manifested itself and I repeated
[1:53:00] fullness in this hour that we have been
[1:53:03] allied we ought to just rejoice o raise
[1:53:08] up those hands and say Lord God I see it
[1:53:12] I see it in your homes today stand up
[1:53:15] and raise up those hands and say Lord I
[1:53:17] see it thank you for this work thank you

[1:53:45] culmination you're you're not only at
[1:53:48] the culmination you are the culmination

[1:54:04] final voice to the final age a man god

[1:54:12] turn it back to brother ALRI at the
[1:54:14] conclusion of this prayer amen let's
[1:54:16] pray Lord Jesus tonight we thank you
[1:54:21] Lord for this approaching hour that we
[1:54:23] find ourselves in I'm so glad to be here
[1:54:27] Lord I yeah this world is troubled and
[1:54:29] filled with sorrow misery and woe but
[1:54:32] Lord you know in through it all I I hold
[1:54:36] my head up I look up Lord I know that
[1:54:39] you you prophesied of terrible things
[1:54:41] that would come upon the earth and it's
[1:54:43] somewhat of a paradox Lord we're not at
[1:54:45] all happy we're not happy people are
[1:54:47] dying we're not happy over that we're
[1:54:49] not happy people are suffering I'm not
[1:54:52] happy Lord even some of your own family
[1:54:54] have been carried home in this in this
[1:54:56] pandemic it's not about that Lord we're
[1:54:59] not rejoicing over homes broken and
[1:55:01] children who don't have a parent anymore
[1:55:03] this over 19 took them Lord we're not
[1:55:06] happy rejoicing in that but at the same
[1:55:08] time Lord Jesus said when you see all of
[1:55:12] these things begin to happen lift up
[1:55:14] your head it's a paradox Lord we're not
[1:55:18] happy over the suffering but I lifting
[1:55:21] up my head I'm not burying my head in
[1:55:23] the sand I'm not running in fear I'm
[1:55:25] lifting I'm lifting up my head I'm
[1:55:27] looking toward the eastern sky I know my
[1:55:30] redemption is at hand
[1:55:31] Lord we see the world shaking I pray
[1:55:34] tonight Lord that the words of this
[1:55:36] message the real crux of this message
[1:55:39] what was that Lord my whole my whole my
[1:55:44] whole motive tonight was to get the
[1:55:47] people to come down and look within
[1:55:48] their own self deep introspection
[1:55:51] to realize Lord to try to show them the
[1:55:54] day an hour that we're living in and we
[1:55:56] arrived here by some cosmic accident
[1:55:58] this whole thing is Purpose Driven and
[1:56:01] my whole life is Purpose Driven my whole
[1:56:03] reason for being here Lord I can never
[1:56:06] find it I can never succeed and I can
[1:56:08] never get to that place if I'm if I'm
[1:56:11] connected all over a layer to see and
[1:56:13] I'm connected to the world I'm connected
[1:56:15] to the rat-race
[1:56:16] and I'm connected to entertainment and
[1:56:18] I'm connected all these things Lord let
[1:56:20] me unplug let me step away let me plug
[1:56:23] into you let my life enter into a
[1:56:26] greater a greater depth Lord that I may
[1:56:29] know you for that's the imperative
[1:56:32] reality that we must live in right now
[1:56:35] we must be very very close to you more
[1:56:39] I pray that hearts tonight father have
[1:56:42] recognized this we commit it to you now

[1:58:43] is he's changing us we don't have to
[1:58:46] worry whether we gonna know what what he
[1:58:48] wants done with his word because his
[1:58:50] word is in us his Eternal Word was
[1:58:53] always predestinated there was always a
