[23:09] amen and it's good to see you all
[23:13] I've longed to see you all face to face
[23:16] soon
[23:17] the Lord made it possible this weekend I
[23:19] don't know if this is powered up or I
[23:21] can keep talking
[23:23] that's all right yeah so happy to be
[23:26] here this weekend many of you obviously
[23:28] are seeing me for the first time my name
[23:30] is Michael
[23:32] my surname is a bit difficult for many
[23:35] of you to pronounce but you just go with
[23:38] the vows it's chicarima
[23:42] c-h-i-k-e-r-e-m-a to those that speak
[23:45] Africans you know exactly what it means
[23:47] that scale him
[23:49] so it used to be my grandfather's
[23:52] nickname he was called a scaling because
[23:55] he used to train horses and he was quite
[23:58] good at it so they whenever they had
[24:00] issues with horses and oxen remember the
[24:02] olden days when they were making roads
[24:04] they would have like 10 pairs of auction
[24:08] and sometimes when they are tired they
[24:10] play tricks and they start just
[24:12] pretending like they're confused so that
[24:14] they can take a break so he was known
[24:17] for making sure he separates them and
[24:18] keeps them all in line and so they
[24:21] called him scale him so that's why I got
[24:23] my Nick my surname from uh but uh so
[24:27] yeah
[24:28] based in Perth Western Australia I'm
[24:31] originally from Zimbabwe if you know
[24:34] your map it's right there
[24:36] on the southern tip near the southern
[24:38] tip of Africa that's where I'm
[24:40] originally from I've been in Perth this
[24:43] December will be nine years
[24:46] I also worked and lived in Botswana also
[24:49] southern Africa lived there for about
[24:51] seven years so I speak a little bit of
[24:53] setswana but I'm no expert
[24:58] so happy to be in the service of the
[24:59] Lord I was speaking to brother Fred last
[25:02] night and he did ask my age I turned 40
[25:05] last September he said oh you're a young
[25:07] boy I said brother I've been in the
[25:08] ministry since I've been 20. so I feel
[25:11] like I'm already about to retire now
[25:16] so I started in the ministry when I was
[25:18] pretty young and I was looked just like
[25:20] this so I don't really change with age I
[25:22] guess I'm hoping to be still looking
[25:24] like this when I'm 60.
[25:29] so we want to appreciate the Lord so
[25:31] much I consider brother Elroy a friend
[25:34] amen we haven't known each other for a
[25:37] long time sometimes you meet some people
[25:39] once or twice and you kind of connect
[25:41] and you feel like you're good friends
[25:43] amen and so happy to have him we were
[25:46] tremendously blessed to have him when he
[25:48] visited Us in Perth and preached for us
[25:50] when we had special meetings and we are
[25:52] still talking about those services so I
[25:56] had this opportunity to come this
[25:57] weekend and we felt we could grab it and
[25:59] I could come down and and I quickly fly
[26:03] back even at the airport they were
[26:05] asking me so when do you go back I said
[26:07] Monday and it was hard for them to
[26:09] believe like you know what's the point
[26:12] but uh we could only grab these four
[26:15] days for me to come down so we
[26:16] appreciate the Lord for that happy to
[26:18] see you all I guess we'll go straight
[26:21] into the scripture we pray and then I've
[26:24] got just a few things to share with you
[26:26] uh that would be great want to
[26:28] appreciate family my brother-in-law I
[26:31] hate to say brother-in-law my brother in
[26:33] love and my sister in love and their
[26:35] family
[26:36] who are hosting me and traveling with me
[26:38] around brother Morgan sister patience
[26:41] and and the children amen difficult to
[26:44] say Josiah the children because he
[26:46] doesn't seem to fit that category so
[26:49] somebody happy to have them with us
[26:52] we'll go straight into the scripture if
[26:54] we could read the book of Matthew
[26:55] chapter 21
[26:57] we start from verse 21.
[27:00] just want to salute all uh
[27:04] brother Elvis wife I understand we can
[27:07] call her sister pillar
[27:09] so we have the appreciate your sister
[27:12] and uh happy to see you and meet you in
[27:15] person
[27:16] Matthew chapter 21 we start from verse
[27:19] 21.
[27:24] the Bible reads Jesus answered and said
[27:27] unto them verily I say unto you if ye
[27:30] have faith and doubt not he shall not
[27:34] only do this which is done to the Fig
[27:36] Tree but also if he shall say to this
[27:39] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[27:42] cast into the sea it shall be done and
[27:45] all things whatsoever ye shall ask in
[27:47] prayer believing you shall receive may
[27:51] the Lord that blessing to the reading of
[27:52] his word if we could just bow our heads
[27:54] for a word of Prayer
[27:55] Lord Jesus you saw this day you saw this
[27:59] group you saw this father from before
[28:01] the foundation of the world we are
[28:03] meeting for the first time knowing each
[28:05] other in the flesh for the first time
[28:07] but father oh God you saw this meeting
[28:10] from before the foundation of the world
[28:12] and father though it'd be good to meet
[28:14] one another and father Lord to just
[28:17] speak in general and have Fellowship but
[28:20] father speaking and gathering around the
[28:22] word of God is a beautiful thing and
[28:25] father oh God how can we speak of your
[28:27] word and be inspired without your spirit
[28:29] we father pray for an infused connection
[28:33] with the throne above that you may come
[28:35] amongst us tonight and father in this
[28:38] interactive fellowship with your love
[28:41] those that you have died for father
[28:43] those that you chose in this generation
[28:45] that is lost and seeking Pleasures
[28:47] seeking of God all kinds of ungodly
[28:50] satisfactions you have chosen these
[28:53] young people father and called them by
[28:55] their name and father Lord surely you
[28:57] wouldn't gather them tonight to hear
[28:59] from no man I pray in the words that
[29:01] shall be spoken may your Holy Spirit
[29:03] give action May the Holy Spirit the Holy
[29:06] Spirit direct may your Holy Spirit
[29:08] father come down and be able to minister
[29:10] to the house of the people and we shall
[29:12] be careful father to give you all the
[29:14] glory and the honor and the mighty name
[29:16] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[29:18] pray amen
[29:20] praise the Lord so I understand I don't
[29:23] have to be preacher like we can talk and
[29:27] and then just share a few thoughts just
[29:29] for your comfort
[29:31] um and just as a disclaimer when I get
[29:34] excited sometimes I shout sometimes I
[29:37] jump I'm trying to give a very good
[29:40] impression so I'll avoid to do that
[29:42] tonight
[29:42] [Laughter]
[29:45] so if if I shout I'm not trying to
[29:49] dominate I'm just excited and I get a
[29:52] bit emotional my passion takes over but
[29:55] I'm I'm not expecting that to happen
[29:56] tonight and I'm also not a long-winded
[30:01] preacher I I usually preach an hour an
[30:04] hour 15 minutes so tonight I intend to
[30:07] do a bit shorter speak for 45 minutes or
[30:11] something like that so don't you worry
[30:14] about it I'm don't see me going and
[30:17] think man we'll be here until midnight
[30:19] hahaha
[30:21] that would be very unusual unless the
[30:24] Holy Ghost leads that way if it's the
[30:26] Holy Ghost I'm sure it will be easy on
[30:28] everybody but that's my intention so I
[30:31] want to speak on Overcomers habits
[30:35] Overcomers habits
[30:39] as you interact with I mean being in the
[30:42] faith and interacting with people and
[30:45] pastoring
[30:47] a group of people and interacting with
[30:49] people in various situations you start
[30:52] to notice one thing that I think is very
[30:55] important for all Christians not just
[30:57] young people especially young people but
[30:59] I think all Christians you wish we had a
[31:02] good grasp on it
[31:04] that nothing in the faith nothing of God
[31:08] it works in a flicker switch kind of
[31:12] mode you know sometimes many people when
[31:15] they come they are not feeling well they
[31:17] want prayer if they don't get healed
[31:19] instantly many a time even if the Lord
[31:22] is what the miracle in their life they
[31:24] lose their healing because where I was
[31:27] prayed for I'm still feeling the same
[31:28] sometimes when somebody's struggling
[31:31] with a certain habit is struggling with
[31:34] certain thoughts struggling with
[31:35] something and they come and they sit
[31:38] down with the pastor or any Elder of the
[31:40] church and they confession they want
[31:42] that thing to end right there and
[31:44] sometimes God does that but many a time
[31:47] it doesn't happen that way
[31:50] um and and maybe somebody's seeking for
[31:53] a breakthrough there want it can be a
[31:55] trade it can be something in their life
[31:57] that they really want to achieve many
[32:00] times people want to be prayed for and
[32:03] you know I was prayed for a church or I
[32:05] lifted up my hands or I went to the
[32:06] altar I was prayed for and so this thing
[32:09] should happen right now
[32:11] um and and and that in itself becomes a
[32:15] source of major disappointments to a lot
[32:16] of Christians and and and and that's
[32:19] where sometimes people lose their faith
[32:21] that's why sometimes people think the
[32:24] message is all talking no God in it but
[32:27] when you look at the scriptures when you
[32:29] really go back to the scriptures
[32:30] anything that ever amounts to anything
[32:33] significant is always come as a result
[32:36] of a habit or a result of persistence
[32:40] amen so we want to talk about Overcomers
[32:44] habits and when you talk about an
[32:46] overcomer an overcomer is a person that
[32:49] encounters uh that encounters
[32:53] difficulties that encounters resistance
[32:56] that encounters negative forces that are
[33:00] working against their progress but yet
[33:02] they are able to go through and overcome
[33:06] whatever is standing in their way any
[33:08] obstacle in their way and come out the
[33:10] other side Victorious that's an
[33:12] overcomer an overcomer is not a person
[33:15] sitting down doing nothing because
[33:16] they're afraid of making mistakes and
[33:18] Overcomer is not a person who fails once
[33:21] fails twice fails three times and gives
[33:23] up that's not an overcomer that's a
[33:25] quitter an overcomer is a person who
[33:27] fails once fails twice fails three times
[33:30] four times five times but still keep
[33:33] going at it that's an overcomer and so
[33:36] when we talk about this message and we
[33:38] say it's an Overcomers message we are
[33:40] not talking about people who are sitting
[33:41] doing nothing chickening out of
[33:43] challenges is not trying anything
[33:45] because they are afraid of making
[33:47] mistakes we are talking about people who
[33:49] are human beings who have weaknesses we
[33:52] have failures but they never give up
[33:54] they continue whatever they are facing
[33:56] they face it once twice three times
[33:59] whatever many times they face it they
[34:02] continue to fight on until they come out
[34:04] the other side Victorious that's an
[34:06] overcomer and when we talk about the
[34:08] Habit we are talking about something
[34:10] that you constantly do I think I've got
[34:12] a definition here that I found in one of
[34:16] the online dictionaries which says a
[34:18] habit is an acquired behavior pattern
[34:22] regularly followed until it has become
[34:25] almost involuntary
[34:28] it is an acquired
[34:30] pattern acquired means you are not born
[34:33] with it means it doesn't come naturally
[34:36] to you you acquire it because you keep
[34:38] doing it you are quiet because it's not
[34:41] inside but you make sure that you keep
[34:44] doing something over and over again
[34:45] until it becomes a part of you until it
[34:49] becomes so set up in you it says that
[34:52] the pattern is regularly followed until
[34:55] it has become almost involuntary
[34:58] you keep doing it over and over again
[35:01] until you start doing it without
[35:03] thinking
[35:05] amen and if you look in the Bible any
[35:08] people that ever had strong Victory
[35:11] where people that actually were very
[35:14] prone to habits amen so habits are not
[35:18] bad it just depends what kind of a habit
[35:20] you have
[35:22] so in this case we are talking about
[35:24] good habits and so the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:28] in that scripture we read in Matthew 21
[35:30] says that you can ask anything and you
[35:33] should not doubt it and all things
[35:36] whatsoever you shall ask in prayer
[35:39] believing you shall receive now if you
[35:42] go to the Book of Mark chapter 1 and we
[35:45] go to verse 30 Mark chapter 1 and we go
[35:49] to verse 30. the Bible reads
[35:58] but Simon's wife's mother lays sick of a
[36:02] fever and unknown they tell him of her
[36:05] and he came and took Hair by the hand
[36:08] and lifted her up and immediately the
[36:11] fever left her and she ministered unto
[36:14] them and that even when the son did set
[36:17] they brought unto him all that were
[36:20] diseased and them that were possessed of
[36:23] devil with devils and all this city was
[36:26] gathered together in the door and he
[36:29] healed many that were sick of diverse
[36:31] diseases and cast out many devils and
[36:35] suffered not the Devils to speak because
[36:37] they knew him and in the morning rising
[36:40] up a great while before day he went out
[36:44] and departed into a solitary place and
[36:47] they prayed and Simon and they that were
[36:50] with him followed after him and when
[36:52] they had found him they said unto him
[36:55] all men seek for thee right that's what
[36:59] we find the Lord Jesus Christ doing
[37:00] isn't it
[37:02] in Mark chapter 1 verse 30 if we look if
[37:06] we open our Bibles to the Book of Luke
[37:08] Luke chapter 6.
[37:22] Luke chapter 6 if we go to verse 12
[37:34] the Bible says and it came to pass in
[37:37] those days
[37:39] that he went out into a mountain to pray
[37:41] and continued all night in prayer to God
[37:44] and when it was day he called unto his
[37:47] disciples and of them chose 12. whom
[37:52] also he named the apostles Simon whom he
[37:54] also named the surnamed named Peter and
[37:57] Andrew his brother James and John Philip
[38:00] in battlemeu Matthew and Thomas James
[38:03] the son of alpheus and Simon called
[38:06] zealots and Judas the brother of James
[38:09] and Judas Iscariot which also was the
[38:14] traitor so you notice something that the
[38:16] Lord Jesus did
[38:18] you can already see a pattern there's
[38:20] many other scriptures that we could
[38:22] refer to but this is just to give us a
[38:24] snapshot
[38:25] of what the Lord Jesus Christ in his
[38:27] ethnic Ministry did he had one very
[38:30] strong habit that was prayer
[38:33] so everything that we witness about his
[38:36] ministry all the Miracles even the
[38:39] choosing of the disciples was connected
[38:41] to prayer
[38:42] amen all the wonderful tremendous
[38:45] Miracles that we read about in the
[38:48] scriptures that the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:49] did In the Flesh they were connected to
[38:52] a habit
[38:53] and that was that the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:55] was always in prayer
[38:58] amen nothing ever nothing tremendous
[39:01] nothing significant ever happens without
[39:05] doing something over and over again
[39:08] trying harder putting your time putting
[39:11] your energy putting your effort and
[39:14] everything in life whether it's good or
[39:16] bad no Sportsman becomes an Olympic gold
[39:20] medal winner when others are in the uh
[39:24] sporting field training or in the gym
[39:27] lifting weights or doing anything they
[39:29] are busy eating markers and you expect
[39:31] to win the Olympic gold medal it's not
[39:34] going to work
[39:34] even if you juice yourself up with
[39:37] steroids you still need a little bit of
[39:38] exercise
[39:39] you know steroids don't work on
[39:41] everybody they work on somebody who has
[39:43] potentials and somehow they they they
[39:46] polish up and Juice you up to be a
[39:48] little bit more able to perform than
[39:52] than others but the fact Still Remains
[39:55] you've got to be able to practice
[39:57] spend hours in the gym spend hours on
[40:00] the track running up and down so that
[40:03] you can be able to win something of
[40:05] significance it's like that in the world
[40:08] if you listen to all these things that
[40:10] have been discovered you listen about
[40:12] how Steve Jobs was able to start up his
[40:14] company together with his friend Stephen
[40:16] and them you notice that they were in a
[40:19] garage time and time again trying things
[40:22] out and trying this and joining a tech
[40:25] club and going there and attending
[40:27] meetings and sharing ideas how many
[40:30] hours did they spend just involved in
[40:33] the things that they wanted to achieve
[40:34] whether it's attending a technical Club
[40:37] whether it's being in a garage putting
[40:39] things together trying things and
[40:41] failing tomorrow they don't give up and
[40:42] say well yesterday I failed so I'm not
[40:44] going to try anything today the next day
[40:46] they would come and try again and fail
[40:48] again amen and the next day come try
[40:51] fail again until they were able to put
[40:54] things together and everything started
[40:56] to work anything significant in life
[40:58] comes by effort comes by trying and
[41:02] comes by failure and not giving up when
[41:06] you fail because sometimes failure is
[41:08] the best thing that could do to that
[41:10] could happen to you failure could be the
[41:12] thing that keeps you going failure is
[41:14] the thing that shows you that if you try
[41:16] it this way it's not going to work
[41:17] because it doesn't work this way I've
[41:18] got to try in another way so your
[41:21] failure is good because it shows you
[41:23] what works and what doesn't work and so
[41:26] once it doesn't work you know you can
[41:28] eliminate that approach and try another
[41:31] one so one less Problem by the failure
[41:34] that you went through amen and so this
[41:37] is what life is all about so the Lord
[41:39] Jesus Christ here the habit and that was
[41:41] prayer and the prophet in the message
[41:43] the healing of Jairus daughter he says
[41:46] just the previous chapter we find a
[41:48] place where the Son of God spends so
[41:51] much time in prayer and if Jesus had to
[41:54] spend much time in prayer to stay in
[41:57] fellowship with the spirit that was in
[42:00] him how much more do you and I have to
[42:05] spend in prayer
[42:08] virgin born son of God sinless didn't
[42:12] come to the world speaking lies amen
[42:14] like we do amen we came the the hard way
[42:18] and but if the Virgin born sinless son
[42:22] of God called the prophesied by Isaiah
[42:25] prophesied in the scriptures the angel
[42:27] came down to tell the father about the
[42:29] promise of the word and he comes like
[42:31] that if that kind of an individual had
[42:35] to be constantly in prayer to stay in
[42:38] good fellowship with the spirit that was
[42:40] within him the prophet is asking the
[42:42] question how much more do you and I have
[42:45] to stay in prayer
[42:47] we read that the way the scripture says
[42:50] he was in prayer for the whole night
[42:52] amen we read in way the Lord was always
[42:56] in prayer he walked away a distance from
[42:58] his disciples walked away a distance
[43:01] from uh uh all the people that were
[43:03] gathered around him so that he could be
[43:05] in prayer and throughout the gospels you
[43:08] notice that was his habit always in
[43:11] prayer so that he could be in good
[43:13] fellowship with the spirit that was
[43:14] within him what about you and I so for
[43:18] us to really live a fulfilled life a
[43:21] perfect Christian Life and Overcoming
[43:23] life we cannot do it without prayer amen
[43:26] so for you to be an overcomer you've got
[43:29] to have the habit of praying amen prayer
[43:33] has got to become a part of your life
[43:36] that's the only way you can overcome one
[43:39] preacher was preaching he says the
[43:41] problem with Christians is they are
[43:43] part-time Christians but they are
[43:45] fighting a full-time devil that's the
[43:47] problem we are trying to fight a
[43:49] full-time devil and we are worshiping
[43:51] God part-time only on a Sunday that's
[43:53] when we think of church that's when we
[43:55] think of praying that's when we only
[43:57] want to save his day that's when we Are
[43:59] Spiritual enough or we try and speak to
[44:01] God it shouldn't be like that we should
[44:04] be a habit that is a believer in order
[44:06] to be in perfect harmony with the spirit
[44:09] that has been given to us we are always
[44:11] in prayer amen he spent much time in
[44:14] prayer if you only knew what time in
[44:18] prayer meant sometimes when you are in
[44:21] prayer God changes the complete
[44:23] destination of different things that's
[44:26] going to happen do you believe that
[44:28] might be something fixing to happen and
[44:31] your prayer could change the whole
[44:33] situation where you say if God knows his
[44:36] is going to happen what would my prayer
[44:39] do if God knows is going to happen so
[44:42] what's the point you know
[44:43] and the Lord says you remember when he
[44:46] stood there looking out upon the Harvest
[44:48] he said he was the lord of the Harvest
[44:50] he said the Harvest his life is ripe the
[44:54] laborers are few pray the Lord of the
[44:57] Harvest that he will send the Liberals
[44:59] into his harvest in other words pray to
[45:03] me that I send laborers into my Harvest
[45:08] which I'm just telling you it's such a
[45:11] needy thing
[45:13] but part of it lays in human beings
[45:18] now Jesus said in one place I am the
[45:22] vine and the other branches the vine can
[45:25] bear fruit the branches in the vine base
[45:27] fruit God cannot bear fruit of himself
[45:32] it's good to take the church is that
[45:34] right he's going to take you branches to
[45:38] bear fruit
[45:39] and when you branches are yielded to the
[45:43] vine then fruit comes forth see what I
[45:46] mean God wants your hands he wants your
[45:50] eyes he wants your tongue he wants your
[45:53] lips once your ears once your hands and
[45:56] feet so he can bring forth fruit through
[46:00] you
[46:01] so there's things that God has purpose
[46:03] to happen in this generation
[46:05] there's things that people God has
[46:07] purposed to happen it's already in his
[46:09] plan he has purpose for those things to
[46:12] happen to this town to the surrounding
[46:14] towns or to your neighborhood wherever
[46:16] you are best in and he knows that that
[46:19] thing has got to happen but God doesn't
[46:22] expect you to just have those things
[46:24] happen and you haven't done anything
[46:26] about it though he has prophesied that
[46:29] those things should happen yet
[46:31] he expects you to do something about it
[46:34] amen he is already papers for the thing
[46:37] to happen and he wants you to be able to
[46:39] be part of it but it's not just going to
[46:41] come when you're seated doing nothing
[46:43] amen God wants it to happen he's already
[46:46] seen it happening but part of the
[46:49] mystery is you having a burden on your
[46:52] heart and praying about it and doing
[46:54] something about it then God comes to
[46:57] work through you
[46:59] amen that's that's life that's the
[47:01] Christian Life the Bible says Enoch
[47:03] walked with God it was not a walk where
[47:06] they were holding hands and say you know
[47:07] let's just go for a walk it was a life
[47:09] lived it was step by step today is going
[47:13] through this he deals with that next day
[47:15] he's going through these deals with that
[47:17] he was walking with God and he got to a
[47:21] point where he was so perfect in the
[47:24] eyes of God and he walked so further
[47:26] down the road so victorious in his work
[47:29] God says you know what let's go home
[47:33] amen so if you notice everything of God
[47:37] I hope I don't start a controversy by
[47:39] dropping this statement but you are a
[47:41] well-taught church I have confidence in
[47:42] brother Elroy so he will put things in
[47:44] place if if you feel like they've been
[47:46] misplaced the Rapture is a process
[47:50] that culminates in an event
[47:52] but we are already in the rapture
[47:55] because the rap just starts with the
[47:57] shout
[47:58] amen and the shout is the message so we
[48:02] are already
[48:04] in the Rapture but the Rapture is a
[48:07] process that culminates in an event so
[48:11] the Rapture is the life that we are
[48:12] living now the Rapture is the victories
[48:15] we are having every day the Rapture is
[48:18] the battles that we are fighting every
[48:20] day failing today overcoming tomorrow
[48:22] the Rapture is when we hear the word and
[48:25] we have stuck in a habit where there's
[48:27] gossip whether it's watching the wrong
[48:29] things on the internet whatever it is
[48:31] but you are in there and the preacher
[48:33] comes and preaches the word and somehow
[48:35] you get strength you get convicted and
[48:38] you go and you fight that thing I'm not
[48:41] going to click on that website I'm not
[48:43] going to say those things about people
[48:44] that's the Rapture that's the Rapture
[48:47] that's happening because all the nature
[48:49] the humanity is being overcome and we
[48:52] will have so much Victory one day until
[48:54] this world cannot hold us anymore
[48:56] that's the Rapture so the Rapture is a
[48:59] everyday Victory the Rapture is a walk
[49:02] the Rapture is failing and standing up
[49:04] and running again falling and standing
[49:07] up and running again that's the Rapture
[49:09] so people will be like you know I want
[49:11] to close myself in a room close myself
[49:13] in a room play the tapes Non-Stop
[49:16] you know I don't want to come out of
[49:18] there day in day out to close myself in
[49:21] a room stay away from people when I walk
[49:22] out of there I'm going to have Rapture
[49:24] and faith
[49:25] that's not the right approach because
[49:28] the Rapture is connected to your life
[49:29] your Perfection is connected to the life
[49:32] that you live you are not perfected
[49:34] without challenges
[49:37] you are not perfected without
[49:39] challenging you're gonna go through
[49:41] stuff you're gonna be tempted you're
[49:43] going to sometimes fail sometimes to
[49:45] stumble but the Rapture is you stumbling
[49:48] and still being able to maintain your
[49:50] trajectory
[49:52] amen so the Rapture is not a flicker
[49:55] switch kind of situation you know people
[49:56] want Rapture in faith but they don't
[49:58] want challenges
[50:00] people want Rapture in faith but they
[50:02] don't want problems people want Rapture
[50:04] in faith but they don't want to do and
[50:06] have good habits and be in prayer and
[50:09] read their Bibles and do the right kind
[50:11] of things but they want to be raptured
[50:13] the Rapture is going to come by the
[50:15] things that you go through you could
[50:17] close yourself in a room and play the
[50:19] tapes non-stop but as long as you're not
[50:21] living the life you cannot be perfect
[50:22] because your Perfection is connected to
[50:25] the full ordained experiences that God
[50:27] has already put in your life
[50:30] amen not everybody goes through the same
[50:33] challenges because you as an individual
[50:36] need a certain kind of challenge that
[50:38] might not be good for this other
[50:40] individual so we all have stuff that we
[50:42] are dealing with we all have weaknesses
[50:45] human weaknesses that we are dealing
[50:47] with to somebody's signal is cigarettes
[50:49] but you might even think man what's
[50:52] wrong with this brother how can you
[50:54] struggle to quit cigarettes it's a
[50:56] problem for him it may not be a problem
[50:58] for you but you may have a problem that
[51:01] this brother never even thinks of having
[51:04] but yet it's all we are all going
[51:07] through stuff but it's the victories
[51:10] that we have over these things that
[51:12] gives us Rapture and faith
[51:14] amen and so we've got to be in prayer
[51:17] and part of it lies in that amen and so
[51:23] God help us to see these things and then
[51:25] the prophet in the message communion he
[51:28] says now our bodies need food and drink
[51:31] each day to survive
[51:33] our physical body if we don't take food
[51:36] each day and drink then our body weakens
[51:39] there is something in us that we must
[51:43] have food
[51:44] one day food is not last one day's food
[51:47] will not last for the next day you've
[51:50] got to have food each day to strengthen
[51:53] your mortal being you can live over
[51:56] but you are weaker and the second day
[51:58] you are still weaker and the third day
[52:01] you are getting tremendous week well
[52:05] that's what many times that we do in
[52:08] spiritual realm you see each day we've
[52:12] got to commune with Christ
[52:14] you've got to talk to him each day with
[52:17] God to settle it with him each day Paul
[52:21] said I die each day see each day I die
[52:25] yet I live not me but Christ lives in me
[52:30] so if your physical body needs food each
[52:34] day and drink each day to survive your
[52:38] spiritual body needs spiritual food and
[52:42] communion with the Lord each day to
[52:44] survive
[52:45] right so it's just the same if your
[52:48] natural body needs food your spiritual
[52:50] body needs food as well men shall not
[52:53] live by bread alone but by every word
[52:56] that proceeded out of the mouth of God
[52:59] so each day we've got to study the Bible
[53:02] some people doesn't study that oh some
[53:06] picks it up every two or three times a
[53:08] year but a real real believer that's
[53:13] really spiritually built up he reads his
[53:16] Bible every day and talks to the Lord
[53:20] that's right he has to men shall not
[53:24] live by bread alone but by every word
[53:27] that proceeded out of the mouth of God
[53:32] one of the biggest problems that we have
[53:34] is we expecting God to come with a big
[53:37] trunk of time
[53:39] and say here you are sister I give you a
[53:42] week with nothing to do so that you can
[53:45] read your Bible
[53:46] here is a bag full of time I give you my
[53:50] brother so that you can read the Bible
[53:52] guess what life is too hectic for that
[53:55] you're gonna be required to do school
[53:57] you're going to be required to do
[53:58] homework you're gonna be required to do
[54:00] chores at home gonna be required to do
[54:02] this that or work or college or
[54:04] university whatever it is life is so
[54:08] hectic if you're a parent there's kids
[54:10] involved there's bills to be paid we all
[54:13] hate those white envelopes in the
[54:14] mailbox but they keep coming and they
[54:16] never stop sometimes you see one you
[54:18] ignore it next week There's a friendly
[54:21] reminder about the first one that you
[54:22] ignored
[54:24] right so there's always things happening
[54:27] in your life there's always going to be
[54:28] stuff happening in your life so you are
[54:30] never going to get time
[54:33] to say well you know what finally
[54:36] I have so much time to read my Bible now
[54:41] this life is going to be demanding of
[54:43] your time and energy you know the
[54:45] prophet says that in the message let him
[54:47] off pressure the prophet says the devil
[54:50] has made it so so that we are working
[54:52] under pressure all the time because when
[54:55] we are under pressure then we are prone
[54:57] to making decisions that we would not
[55:00] normally make if we were relaxed
[55:03] so the world system has been
[55:07] configured by the devil to work against
[55:10] good decisions and good lives because
[55:13] you are in a survival mode every day you
[55:16] you're trying to just survive it it
[55:18] feels like you need a 36-hour day
[55:20] because 24 hours is not enough
[55:25] amen people are drinking Red Bull people
[55:28] agree because the energies the energy is
[55:31] just not there to do all the things that
[55:33] are required of you so you're never
[55:35] going to have enough time you never
[55:37] going to have enough energy in your body
[55:39] to think oh man now I can take a seat
[55:42] sit on my rocking chair then read my
[55:44] Bible so you have got to adapt with the
[55:47] times you've got to be able to still be
[55:50] able to hear the word of God how can you
[55:52] do that well you drive 20 minutes 30
[55:55] minutes from your house to work you
[55:58] drive I don't know how long from this
[56:00] place to that place guess what you've
[56:02] got audio Bibles
[56:04] amen so you you might not get the time
[56:07] to sit down and start flip through to
[56:11] start to flip through the pages of a
[56:13] Bible but guess what you could still
[56:15] read the Bible because now we've got all
[56:17] your Bibles
[56:19] amen so instead of you waiting and be
[56:21] like you know what I'm gonna be stuck in
[56:23] traffic I'm not too sure here but in the
[56:26] bigger cities I'm sure traffic is a big
[56:27] is a huge problem and obviously now with
[56:30] the landslides and everything that's
[56:32] happened you could be stuck waiting for
[56:34] traffic one lane is open you are
[56:36] standing there sitting there in your car
[56:38] for 10-15 minutes guess what 10 15
[56:40] minutes you would have listened to two
[56:42] chapters of the Bible
[56:45] you know what I mean so you've got to
[56:48] change how you think you've got to
[56:50] change how you think you've got to be
[56:52] able to live in today
[56:54] you've got to be able to know 24 hours
[56:57] is not going to be enough I'm never
[56:59] going to have enough time to listen to
[57:01] the message to read my Bible but you
[57:03] know what I have a way of maximizing my
[57:06] time I've got a 30 minutes break lunch
[57:08] break or 45 minutes lunch break you know
[57:10] what I'm gonna read the whole chapter of
[57:12] the Bible
[57:14] I'm gonna start on the Book of Matthew
[57:17] chapter one and I'm gonna say by June
[57:20] where I will be I tell you by June
[57:22] you'll be finished with the New
[57:23] Testament
[57:24] you know so if you think I want to read
[57:27] the Bible from cover to cover and you
[57:29] think you're gonna have three months of
[57:31] just sitting doing nothing reading the
[57:33] Bible from cover to cover you might
[57:34] never get that time
[57:36] but you know what if you start beginning
[57:38] of the year and whatever opportunity you
[57:41] can get and you start listening to an
[57:43] audio Bible by the time you get to
[57:45] Christmas time you've been through the
[57:47] Bible you've probably started on the
[57:48] seven changes you are now on the Seven
[57:50] Seals
[57:52] right so it's all about what kind of
[57:55] habits do you have
[57:57] what kind of a habit
[57:59] You're Expecting
[58:00] you've got to have good habits you've
[58:03] got to be able to know what to do with
[58:04] your time you've got to be able to
[58:06] really structure things because you know
[58:09] that without feeding on the word
[58:11] you are weaker but when you feed on the
[58:14] word of God you are stronger you know
[58:16] that you've got to be in a time of
[58:18] prayer you've learned to create that
[58:21] time you learn to find Corners in the
[58:23] house you learn to find Corners in the
[58:25] school you learn to find Corners in the
[58:28] University you learn to find Corners in
[58:30] the workplace where you can go and
[58:32] Whisper a prayer
[58:34] because if you are waiting for I'm gonna
[58:36] try and clear everything then I'll have
[58:38] all the time to myself so that I can
[58:41] start praying brother I tell you three
[58:43] days can go without you saying a single
[58:45] breath
[58:47] all right and if you notice time for
[58:49] prayer is the difficult time even
[58:51] people's moods change when it's prayer
[58:52] time have you ever seen how prayer time
[58:54] people get upset when you say come let's
[58:56] pray
[58:57] I'm still doing this I'm just coming out
[58:59] of the shower you wait a little bit oh
[59:02] I'm still eating oh there's always
[59:04] something
[59:05] that comes up when it's prayer time
[59:09] everyone has got their priority it's
[59:12] very difficult to get everyone to say oh
[59:15] you know what we are now all ready can
[59:18] we pray everyone feels like whatever
[59:20] they are doing on the phone is a
[59:22] priority whatever they are doing in the
[59:24] kitchen is a priority whatever they are
[59:26] doing in the bathroom is a priority and
[59:28] before you know it everybody is
[59:29] frustrated and everyone just goes to
[59:31] their rooms and you go and sleep without
[59:33] praying
[59:36] and we expect to overcome a full-time
[59:39] devil
[59:42] in this generation loudisha living lives
[59:46] like that
[59:49] we can't we are too weak the world says
[59:52] our bodies
[59:54] spiritually we are like our bodies if
[59:57] you've got days without eating you get
[59:59] weaker you may get by but your strength
[1:00:03] is getting weaker and weaker so is it
[1:00:06] also
[1:00:08] spiritually so you've got to develop
[1:00:11] good habits
[1:00:12] develop good habits develop the right
[1:00:16] you know know how to do what to do with
[1:00:19] your time and as a human being learn to
[1:00:22] just look at your day and say how much
[1:00:24] of my day was focused on the things that
[1:00:27] pertain to the kingdom of God
[1:00:29] I'm not going to ask because we don't
[1:00:31] want to embarrass each other maybe I'll
[1:00:33] be more embarrassed than you you never
[1:00:34] know so but I'm saying
[1:00:36] sometimes there's a human being be
[1:00:38] honest with yourself
[1:00:39] right and just sit down even now take
[1:00:42] your time and think okay apart from the
[1:00:45] service
[1:00:45] since morning
[1:00:47] how much of my time was focused on the
[1:00:49] things that pertain to God
[1:00:53] and you'll be shocked
[1:00:55] to find out how much of our time goes to
[1:00:57] other things
[1:00:58] that don't really pertain
[1:01:00] to the kingdom of God
[1:01:02] it's a huge portion of our time
[1:01:06] but yet we Are Spiritual Beings
[1:01:08] we are here for that purpose to live for
[1:01:11] God and to be Overcomers but how can we
[1:01:14] be Overcomers when we are more involved
[1:01:16] in the things of the world than the
[1:01:18] things that pertain to the kingdom that
[1:01:19] we know we're a part of
[1:01:24] now I think each one of you for a few
[1:01:26] moments ago when you were singing for
[1:01:29] you I am praying that's what I want you
[1:01:32] to do it's prayer that I depend on
[1:01:34] that's the secret of all the mysteries
[1:01:38] of God that's the key that opens the
[1:01:42] door to everything of God
[1:01:45] everything of God is prayer if you pray
[1:01:50] and believe when you pray then believe
[1:01:52] that you receive what you ask for and
[1:01:55] God will make it known
[1:01:59] the big Mysteries there's there's no you
[1:02:02] know Fantastics and fireworks and strobe
[1:02:04] lights and for you to start believing
[1:02:06] that things that will happen just a
[1:02:09] simple life of Prayer
[1:02:12] will make you such a powerful believer
[1:02:14] you you're looking for something that is
[1:02:17] like super duper you know people always
[1:02:19] want to really feel like you know I felt
[1:02:21] like I was charged up you know that's
[1:02:24] Batman in Jurassic Park and all kinds of
[1:02:26] stories that's that's
[1:02:29] Shazam that's that's that's the Magic
[1:02:32] win you know Cinderella stories but when
[1:02:35] you come to the gospel it's deliberate
[1:02:38] moves habits prayer fasting reading your
[1:02:43] Bible being involved in the things of
[1:02:46] God it's simple basic stuff that
[1:02:49] actually makes you the powerhouse
[1:02:54] sometimes with got to be you know
[1:02:56] whatever we imagine but what makes you
[1:03:00] what gives you Joy what gives you the
[1:03:03] power to overcome is really basic stuff
[1:03:07] really basic stuff
[1:03:09] so I think we've mentioned on prayer
[1:03:15] Jesus in the message Believers doubt
[1:03:17] this 530906.
[1:03:19] now it comes to our text one place
[1:03:22] quickly listen close
[1:03:24] he went over to live with the mother in
[1:03:27] Mary and them at Bethany now he was
[1:03:31] called away
[1:03:32] when Jesus went away from that home
[1:03:35] sickness and sorrow come in
[1:03:38] and when Jesus goes away from your home
[1:03:42] sickness and sorrow will come in yes sir
[1:03:45] watch if you turn Jesus down at your
[1:03:49] home
[1:03:50] quit having family prayer quit having
[1:03:54] Bible readings and so forth in your home
[1:03:57] look for trouble to come in
[1:04:00] that's right it's on its Road right then
[1:04:06] so sometimes you just wonder well you
[1:04:09] know we're just living a life of Victory
[1:04:11] we have so much joy in our home how come
[1:04:13] things are working you know sometimes we
[1:04:14] are so used to bad things happening you
[1:04:16] start wondering why is things bad things
[1:04:18] not happening because we are so used to
[1:04:20] them you think something should happen
[1:04:22] it's been a long time since something
[1:04:24] terrible has happened
[1:04:26] you know what maybe you are living the
[1:04:29] right kind of life
[1:04:31] sometimes we wonder why bad things
[1:04:33] happen to us why did this thing happen
[1:04:35] why did that thing happen the previous
[1:04:37] thing sometimes it's because we've
[1:04:39] chased Jesus away from our lives
[1:04:41] and how do we do that we do that by not
[1:04:45] reading the Bible by not having family
[1:04:48] Prayer by not doing all the right
[1:04:49] Christian things
[1:04:51] simple Christian things that we should
[1:04:53] do in our homes and the Bible says the
[1:04:55] moment you move that out of your home
[1:04:57] watch out because trouble is already on
[1:05:00] its way
[1:05:03] there's a lot of unknown things to us
[1:05:06] that are actually happening in the
[1:05:09] spiritual Realm
[1:05:10] when we are living simple Christian
[1:05:13] lives
[1:05:14] you don't know what's happening in the
[1:05:17] spiritual Realms when you are kneeling
[1:05:19] down to pray
[1:05:20] you don't know what's happening in the
[1:05:23] spiritual Realms when you are reading
[1:05:25] your Bible
[1:05:27] you don't even know what's happening in
[1:05:29] the spiritual Realms when you are just
[1:05:31] seated meditating on the word of God
[1:05:34] I'll read the quote where problem says
[1:05:37] it very clearly
[1:05:41] in the message blind batimians 660-330
[1:05:45] the prophet says we put a lot of time
[1:05:49] and things
[1:05:51] but God wants us to come apart
[1:05:54] and just sit down
[1:05:57] and worship him
[1:05:58] and talk with him
[1:06:01] talk it over
[1:06:03] I love that
[1:06:04] all that sweetness
[1:06:06] that's the greatest time of anybody's
[1:06:09] life
[1:06:10] is just to sit down and meditate
[1:06:15] take everything off your mind if you
[1:06:19] would do that
[1:06:20] there wouldn't be so much nervousness
[1:06:22] around the country
[1:06:24] if we would just think on God draw nigh
[1:06:29] unto me and I will draw nigh unto you
[1:06:36] sometimes all this depression that's
[1:06:38] affecting us
[1:06:40] all this nervousness
[1:06:42] he always on the edge frustrated with
[1:06:45] life so many things your brain is
[1:06:48] running at 250 kilo miles per hour
[1:06:50] there's just so much stuff happening you
[1:06:53] seem like you can't cope
[1:06:55] the prophet gives a very simple remedy
[1:06:59] say sometimes what you need
[1:07:01] it's just to take a little bit of time
[1:07:04] sit down and meditate
[1:07:09] can you imagine
[1:07:10] we we are looking for what can I do you
[1:07:13] know you want the preacher to come and
[1:07:15] say come out in the name of Jesus you
[1:07:17] know you want the past to shake you up
[1:07:19] you want the pastor to see a vision
[1:07:21] vision is right there
[1:07:24] you want a dream you want something you
[1:07:26] you want to see an angel come flapping
[1:07:29] the wings down
[1:07:36] sometimes you just need to take your
[1:07:38] time
[1:07:39] sit down and meditate
[1:07:43] huh
[1:07:45] but sometimes you are running you are so
[1:07:48] fast everything has got to happen now
[1:07:52] sometimes what you need is just to cool
[1:07:54] down
[1:07:55] take some moments
[1:07:57] think of the word of God
[1:08:00] think of God
[1:08:02] think of a wonderful hymn
[1:08:05] start Hamming it
[1:08:07] if you know the word start singing it
[1:08:10] amen just relax
[1:08:13] just relax listen to a nice good worship
[1:08:16] song play some beautiful Spiritual music
[1:08:20] even when you feel like exploding in the
[1:08:23] traffic just play some wonderful worship
[1:08:25] and people will see you raise your hands
[1:08:28] up and they wonder what's happening with
[1:08:30] this person you don't know red road rage
[1:08:34] when you're in that Realm
[1:08:38] amen sometimes we are showing each other
[1:08:42] singer because people are not in the
[1:08:45] right space
[1:08:48] of course
[1:08:49] but you can break out of that Realm
[1:08:53] into a certain place
[1:08:55] that just calms you down
[1:08:58] it doesn't mean these things are not
[1:08:59] happening it's all around you
[1:09:02] but your meditation can create a
[1:09:04] gaussian
[1:09:05] for you
[1:09:08] sometimes we don't realize this we will
[1:09:11] spend so much money
[1:09:12] going through counseling taking so much
[1:09:15] medication
[1:09:17] which is all good
[1:09:19] but sometimes
[1:09:21] the solution is right there
[1:09:23] in the wood how much of your time
[1:09:26] is going to the world
[1:09:29] many a time we spend more time worrying
[1:09:32] about our problems
[1:09:33] than meditating on the world
[1:09:36] and the world creates more pressure for
[1:09:38] us makes us more frustrated more unhappy
[1:09:42] makes the situation worse
[1:09:48] in another space in another place
[1:09:50] brother Brown says something very
[1:09:52] profound very striking
[1:09:55] says America does not need an atomic
[1:09:58] Wars and all these defense systems
[1:10:02] he says they now need those things
[1:10:05] because they have taken the Bible from
[1:10:08] their homes and prayers
[1:10:11] from public schools
[1:10:15] so even the feeling that your enemies
[1:10:18] have for you
[1:10:19] can actually be caused by your actions
[1:10:23] you can place yourself in a spiritual
[1:10:26] position where even your enemies don't
[1:10:29] think of attacking you because of the
[1:10:31] atmosphere that you have created around
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:36] many a time we invest so much time on on
[1:10:39] the material on the security on on all
[1:10:42] these things that money and effort can
[1:10:45] produce and yet what we actually need is
[1:10:48] very cheap and free of charge
[1:10:51] we just need to be taking the right
[1:10:53] stand
[1:10:56] instead of you going around the
[1:10:59] workplace and trying to say bad things
[1:11:00] about your boss or bad things about that
[1:11:02] person that you're competing with for
[1:11:04] position in the University so much time
[1:11:06] and you get so creative and say this
[1:11:09] person you know did you hear what they
[1:11:11] said about you I don't think I should
[1:11:13] tell you but I'll just tell you
[1:11:15] and you cook up all these stories and
[1:11:17] invest so much time in gossiping and all
[1:11:20] the Slender what you just need is be in
[1:11:23] the right place
[1:11:25] and that person will not stand the
[1:11:27] chance because God is standing with you
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:36] Jehovah the prophet says quit reading
[1:11:39] old funny stories
[1:11:41] and looking at old no good television
[1:11:43] programs and back to the church to
[1:11:46] praying you say a woman said well I just
[1:11:49] can't find time to read my Bible to my
[1:11:51] children why Susanna Wesley she had 17
[1:11:54] children and she spent three hours a day
[1:11:58] with no modern convenience
[1:12:01] she didn't press a button to wash her
[1:12:03] dishes she didn't turn on a tip to get
[1:12:06] little water out like that she petted it
[1:12:08] from a spring in an old wooden bucket
[1:12:10] and they got deeper pegged it from the
[1:12:12] spring and raised 17 children and could
[1:12:16] spend three hours a day in prayer
[1:12:20] what did she raise up out of it a John
[1:12:23] and a child Hallelujah yes certainly men
[1:12:28] that shook the world
[1:12:30] in their days
[1:12:34] we could go on and on and on
[1:12:38] about the great things that took place
[1:12:40] in the scriptures
[1:12:42] the Bible says they could not throw away
[1:12:44] Moses
[1:12:46] because they found that he was a proper
[1:12:48] child
[1:12:49] and brother Branham comes
[1:12:51] and verbraham says they knew he was a
[1:12:54] proper child because your Shepherd and
[1:12:58] emram had been praying and worried about
[1:13:01] the situation amongst their people and
[1:13:04] in prayer God had come down and revealed
[1:13:07] to Imran that I shall give you a son who
[1:13:10] be a deliverer
[1:13:12] there's so many issues stories in the
[1:13:15] Bible where brother Branham says
[1:13:17] actually they were in prayer or he was
[1:13:19] in prayer or she was in prayer when it
[1:13:22] comes to Mary and the angel visiting her
[1:13:24] what does the prophet say the prophet
[1:13:26] says she was meditating on that
[1:13:29] scripture
[1:13:31] on the promise of the Virgin shall
[1:13:33] conceive the process she was meditating
[1:13:35] on the world and when she was meditating
[1:13:37] on the word the angel of the Lord came
[1:13:39] down
[1:13:42] in the book of Acts it was when Peter
[1:13:45] was fasting and praying and on the upper
[1:13:47] chamber and he was wicking his body but
[1:13:50] strong in his Spirit then the angel
[1:13:52] appeared to him
[1:13:55] the commission of the prophet in
[1:13:57] Greensville cave brother Brahma had said
[1:14:00] to me that if I don't return you take
[1:14:02] care of my children I'm so confused I
[1:14:05] don't understand what this is all about
[1:14:06] but I'm going to a place of prayer and
[1:14:09] he was prepared to die and that night in
[1:14:12] prayer and reading the scriptures the
[1:14:14] angel of the Lord came down and said
[1:14:16] fear not
[1:14:17] if you look at so many significant
[1:14:20] things in the scriptures you notice they
[1:14:22] came when somebody was laboring in
[1:14:25] prayer
[1:14:26] when somebody was meditating on the
[1:14:28] world Joshua was told meditate on this
[1:14:31] book of the Lord day and night
[1:14:36] so it doesn't mean you're you're you are
[1:14:38] less spiritual than somebody else
[1:14:41] I went to school with a guy I'll call
[1:14:43] his nickname
[1:14:45] we need them we nicknamed him guapo
[1:14:48] and Guapo was not sharp I tell you I've
[1:14:50] seen people who can't understand Guapo
[1:14:53] was another case
[1:14:54] Guapo would read the whole night when we
[1:14:57] had an exam in the morning
[1:14:59] and Guapo who have 11 out of 30. when
[1:15:03] some of us who were sleeping would be
[1:15:04] getting like 25 out of 30. and you
[1:15:07] wonder I mean what's the point of being
[1:15:09] awake
[1:15:10] but Guapo was like that Guapo would
[1:15:13] would spend so much time to study and he
[1:15:17] would come and wake us up and ask us how
[1:15:19] can you solve this and you just tried to
[1:15:20] explain it to him you could tell that
[1:15:22] man it was difficult for him to grasp
[1:15:25] things but all the years that I went to
[1:15:27] school with him he was like that
[1:15:31] and he just barely made it by the skin
[1:15:34] of his teeth
[1:15:36] to pass exams all the time he was always
[1:15:40] at 50 percent 51 just barely crawling
[1:15:45] across the line
[1:15:47] but right now he's an auditor
[1:15:52] doing very well
[1:15:54] you know what he didn't he never allowed
[1:15:57] his limitations to pull him down
[1:16:00] he could have easily accepted that
[1:16:02] situation and say what's the point
[1:16:04] what's the point you know I tried so
[1:16:07] hard I never get a high marks these guys
[1:16:10] are sleeping whilst I'm awake studying
[1:16:12] that guy would start so much he would
[1:16:14] dip his legs in cold water
[1:16:16] so that you don't dose of Debbie's legs
[1:16:19] in cold water well other people were
[1:16:21] snoring right next to him and you'll be
[1:16:24] studying and it gets 51 percent
[1:16:26] and the guy who's sleeping there gets 75
[1:16:30] percent but he never allowed that to
[1:16:32] discourage him
[1:16:35] and right now his life in terms of just
[1:16:37] looking at it from a natural standpoint
[1:16:40] is much better than the people that used
[1:16:42] to get 80 percent
[1:16:44] 90 percent why because he appreciated
[1:16:48] his limitations but he knew that what he
[1:16:51] could not have in terms of natural
[1:16:53] ability he could cover that Gap with
[1:16:57] hard work
[1:17:00] and many a time we shy away from hard
[1:17:02] work we shy away from
[1:17:04] some people can believe for something oh
[1:17:06] sister I prayed for this thing and I got
[1:17:08] it just like that maybe it doesn't work
[1:17:10] like that for you but guess what what
[1:17:13] you may not have easily like that you
[1:17:15] may out pray that sister that brother
[1:17:17] and you stay on your knees you keep
[1:17:19] believing you keep holding on until you
[1:17:21] get what you're asking for guess what
[1:17:23] later in life you look back at your life
[1:17:26] in the accomplishments that you have
[1:17:27] there might be much more than this
[1:17:29] individual
[1:17:30] so never compare your life to anybody
[1:17:32] never compare your abilities
[1:17:35] to anybody because you have your own
[1:17:38] path
[1:17:39] but never shy away from hard work
[1:17:42] I say to the church in Perth
[1:17:45] certain things
[1:17:47] should be easy for us we may not be some
[1:17:50] super duper Spiritual Church you may not
[1:17:53] have the greatest gift but I said coming
[1:17:56] later to church is just being lazy you
[1:17:59] don't need the special gift to come to
[1:18:01] change your time
[1:18:02] [Laughter]
[1:18:04] you know there are certain things that
[1:18:06] you don't need a special gift for you
[1:18:09] don't need a special gift to just come
[1:18:11] and live good quality quiet time in
[1:18:13] church and prepare for the service you
[1:18:15] don't need a special gift for that I
[1:18:17] said if we do the basics right like the
[1:18:20] prophet has taught us even if we're an
[1:18:23] average church if we do the basics right
[1:18:26] then we are not going to be average
[1:18:33] the problem is our approach is average
[1:18:36] and we're expecting tremendous results
[1:18:38] things don't work like that
[1:18:42] you can be average if I
[1:18:50] you can be awake the whole night
[1:18:52] studying the whole weekend studying and
[1:18:54] you come you preach on Sunday and people
[1:18:55] say well that was decent
[1:18:58] but you know what you put the effort in
[1:19:01] you did the best that you could
[1:19:03] amen you preached the best sermon that
[1:19:06] you can amen because that's what God has
[1:19:08] given you but imagine if I sleep like
[1:19:11] tomorrow is a Sunday and I say ah amen
[1:19:14] what can I preach I'm going to sleep and
[1:19:16] tomorrow I come and I don't even know
[1:19:18] which scripture to read is it the Book
[1:19:20] of John or Luke I'm confusing scriptures
[1:19:23] everyone is scratching their heads and
[1:19:25] wondering man where did Pastor auri meet
[1:19:27] this brother
[1:19:31] is confused man he's all over the place
[1:19:35] what a shame
[1:19:36] isn't it
[1:19:38] he may be average
[1:19:40] but if you do your things right you'll
[1:19:43] never be average
[1:19:44] you may have averaged abilities and
[1:19:47] gifting but you know what you outwork
[1:19:50] everybody else
[1:19:52] and see where God takes you
[1:19:55] develop the right kind of habits in your
[1:19:57] life that's why brother Billy Paul says
[1:20:00] to him if you want to be a bum be the
[1:20:03] best bum you can be and never work a day
[1:20:06] in your life
[1:20:07] be the best that you can be in your life
[1:20:11] amen I say to our music team I I
[1:20:14] everyone says you know Pastor you know
[1:20:17] we want our music to be like that change
[1:20:20] that change
[1:20:21] so God has given us Grace because we are
[1:20:25] sharing a building with the Pentecostal
[1:20:27] Church they come on a Thursday evening
[1:20:29] they start at 6 30 and sometimes I made
[1:20:33] the church in the office studying or
[1:20:35] whatever and they live on a Thursday
[1:20:37] evening midweek and they leave at 11 PM
[1:20:42] and I say to my music team I said you
[1:20:45] want to play good you want good music
[1:20:47] it's not we're not going to come to the
[1:20:49] Altar and pray and fast for it and
[1:20:51] expect it to work you guys have a lot of
[1:20:54] work to do
[1:20:54] [Laughter]
[1:20:58] there is a lot of practice sessions
[1:21:00] yes you pray you
[1:21:03] but you need to come and practice
[1:21:06] if you just sleeping like everybody else
[1:21:08] is just being average in your approach
[1:21:11] like everybody else you're gonna get the
[1:21:13] average results
[1:21:15] sometimes even below average
[1:21:18] but if you put the work in practice sing
[1:21:22] and do it again and do it again and
[1:21:26] again you become a master
[1:21:28] and before the preacher preaches
[1:21:31] people are already breaking in the
[1:21:32] spirit
[1:21:34] why because you've just done your Basics
[1:21:37] right
[1:21:38] that's the Christian Life
[1:21:40] it's basics
[1:21:42] program says I always fast and pray for
[1:21:45] three days
[1:21:46] before all my meetings
[1:21:49] and he says and in that period of
[1:21:51] fasting and praying the Lord most of the
[1:21:54] time shows me exactly what's going to
[1:21:55] happen in the meetings I just have to
[1:21:58] repeat it to the people
[1:22:02] so we look at brother branham's Ministry
[1:22:05] was God's Prophet look at how he lived
[1:22:10] look at how he lived look at how he
[1:22:12] approached things
[1:22:14] results don't just come
[1:22:18] easily
[1:22:20] hard work
[1:22:22] you want to achieve anything in life
[1:22:25] the modern day believer the young person
[1:22:27] who believes the message should
[1:22:29] understand hard work
[1:22:31] should understand effort anything
[1:22:34] in life even if you say well this
[1:22:37] message is not good enough for me or I'm
[1:22:38] not good enough for this message I want
[1:22:40] to try another life whatever you are
[1:22:42] thinking you are accomplishing that life
[1:22:44] is never going to come easy
[1:22:47] you know people see those artists with
[1:22:50] gold chains and all those things that
[1:22:53] are just sparkling all around you know
[1:22:55] when they see those heavy chains and all
[1:22:58] those expensive clothes and everything
[1:23:00] it didn't come easy
[1:23:03] they spent hours and hours in a studio
[1:23:05] practicing one line
[1:23:10] when you see them
[1:23:12] on the platform you think ah you know it
[1:23:14] just comes there just spitting verses
[1:23:16] from nowhere
[1:23:19] you look behind the scenes and see what
[1:23:21] happens
[1:23:23] young girls see actresses you know
[1:23:26] winning Awards and you know they want to
[1:23:28] live the faith and go to Hollywood and
[1:23:30] win Awards and the next thing you hear
[1:23:32] all these actresses saying they were
[1:23:34] abused by a certain big man in Hollywood
[1:23:39] but when they are receiving their Awards
[1:23:41] they never tell you what they went
[1:23:43] through
[1:23:44] how they got that part
[1:23:46] how did they get it they never tell you
[1:23:50] ah
[1:23:51] they get their award newspaper headlines
[1:23:55] and the young girls young men look at
[1:23:57] those things and they want to be like
[1:23:59] that
[1:24:01] nothing is cheap
[1:24:03] nothing is cheap
[1:24:08] there's a man called Bernie Sanders
[1:24:12] and Barry Barry Sanders used to play
[1:24:15] American football some of you may know
[1:24:16] it you know with the helmets in very
[1:24:19] hard contact spot
[1:24:21] at the top of his game
[1:24:23] he retired and people almost beat him up
[1:24:28] retire when they are in the top of your
[1:24:30] game
[1:24:31] he said this is a high contact spot
[1:24:34] you cannot do it for a long period of
[1:24:36] time
[1:24:37] I've done enough I cannot do it anymore
[1:24:42] people see success he'd been spotting it
[1:24:45] been anything in life they think it's
[1:24:47] easy
[1:24:51] it's not even easy being a devil
[1:24:55] as how difficult everything is
[1:25:00] so if you want to be bad really bad
[1:25:03] imagine that devil has a hard time
[1:25:05] imagine where you're going to be
[1:25:09] nothing is easy Brothers nothing is easy
[1:25:13] but it's also simple
[1:25:15] is developing the right kind of habits
[1:25:18] prayer reading your Bible singing songs
[1:25:21] participating in church doing the right
[1:25:23] things you will be so strong
[1:25:26] no devil can touch you no devil can
[1:25:29] visit your home and if they do make it
[1:25:32] through your door they don't stand a
[1:25:34] chance when you speak the word not
[1:25:36] because you are this great person but
[1:25:38] you are a child of God who knows where
[1:25:41] they stand may God we should bless you
[1:25:44] amen praise God
[1:26:18] foreign
[1:26:28] there we go
[1:26:30] really really enjoyed that brother
[1:26:32] Michael thank you very much
[1:26:34] and enjoy is probably the wrong word
[1:26:37] really spoke to my heart
[1:26:39] um
[1:26:40] and you know I want to say we can so
[1:26:43] easily say well you know I'm a young
[1:26:45] person and I don't want to put that time
[1:26:48] in yet and I don't want to dedicate my
[1:26:50] life here to whatever
[1:26:51] but the reality is if we want the
[1:26:54] results which all of us want the results
[1:26:57] then we also need to dedicate your time
[1:27:00] dedicate your time to
[1:27:02] spend some time in the world spend some
[1:27:04] time with the Bible spend some time in
[1:27:05] the message spend some time in prayer
[1:27:07] build a relationship with God
[1:27:10] those things are not going to come just
[1:27:11] automatically we have to also do our
[1:27:14] part
[1:27:15] I mean ultimately only God can change us
[1:27:17] we can't change ourselves but like I
[1:27:20] could rather see if we if we show
[1:27:22] dedication and we put in our birth of
[1:27:24] effort amen God takes that and he and he
[1:27:27] does a lot more with it than the better
[1:27:29] we can do
[1:27:31] I mean just really appreciate it Arnold
[1:27:34] I'll end up with you
[1:27:44] sing the song I'm amazed I'm in the key
[1:27:47] of C or candy okay let's sing in the
