[1:01:32] the word and and we'll see what the Lord
[1:01:34] has for us so we're going to speak on
[1:01:36] the subject victory in battle as you can
[1:01:38] see the the picture up there I mean
[1:01:40] they're they're in battle array amen you
[1:01:43] know I I get excited you know because if
[1:01:45] you look at those soldiers up there you
[1:01:47] know they've got weapons and and they
[1:01:48] and you can tell which country they come
[1:01:50] from which country do they come from
[1:01:53] somebody Rome right they're Romans right
[1:01:57] so we see that they're Romans how can we
[1:01:59] tell them that they're Romans
[1:02:03] yeah the headgear
[1:02:05] what else how can we tell the Romans
[1:02:08] right they're uniform their Shields
[1:02:10] they're the way they're dressed right
[1:02:11] easily right right quick we can tell who
[1:02:13] they are which side they're on you know
[1:02:16] we can maybe see a little bit of who
[1:02:17] they're fighting over there but right
[1:02:19] away we can tell who they are you know
[1:02:20] we can we can see which side of the
[1:02:22] battle you're on by by your the way you
[1:02:24] look outward appearance and we can see
[1:02:27] the kind of weapons they use and even
[1:02:29] Paul you know when when he's talking
[1:02:31] about fighting the good fight of faith
[1:02:32] and you know he was talking about a
[1:02:34] Roman sword and you see those Roman
[1:02:36] swords are short and they're shorter
[1:02:38] than the enemy swords because the Romans
[1:02:39] wanted to get into close combat they
[1:02:41] wanted to draw the enemy right in so
[1:02:43] when Paul was thinking about soldiers he
[1:02:45] was he was talking about getting right
[1:02:46] in the enemy's face amen not not being
[1:02:48] afraid of the enemy but I love this this
[1:02:51] picture because you know the Romans
[1:02:52] lines are tight
[1:02:55] amen amen that's a good picture huh
[1:02:57] everyone in their posts of Duty
[1:02:59] everyone's standing shoulder to shoulder
[1:03:01] going into the battle everyone with the
[1:03:03] right equipment how many hairs got their
[1:03:04] sword tonight now we've been equipped
[1:03:06] for the battle today amen so God's
[1:03:09] dressed us he's equipped us and he he
[1:03:10] has he has has told us how to fight the
[1:03:13] enemy so we're going to look at these
[1:03:14] things a little bit tonight Ephesians
[1:03:18] chapter 6 and verse 11.
[1:03:21] tells us if you can read this with me
[1:03:23] tonight Ephesians 6 and 11.
[1:03:27] says put on the whole armor of God that
[1:03:30] you may be able to stand against The
[1:03:32] Wiles of the devil
[1:03:34] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:03:36] blood but against principalities against
[1:03:39] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:03:41] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:03:43] wickedness in high places oh boy we've
[1:03:47] been called to call to a battle I don't
[1:03:48] know if any of you realize this but
[1:03:50] we're in a we're in the in the heat of a
[1:03:52] battle
[1:03:54] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:03:57] of God that's that's the word for us
[1:04:00] tonight
[1:04:01] take on take unto you the whole armor of
[1:04:04] God that you may be able to withstand in
[1:04:07] the evil day and having done all to
[1:04:11] stand
[1:04:12] amen let's bow our heads one more time
[1:04:14] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we so
[1:04:16] appreciate your word and it encourages
[1:04:18] us and it strengthen strengthens us we
[1:04:21] just anoint the word tonight Lord and
[1:04:23] speak to our hearts father as as we just
[1:04:26] Lord turn to you now we yield ourselves
[1:04:29] to you father Lord move in our midst
[1:04:31] tonight Lord and strengthen us in your
[1:04:33] word in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:04:35] you may have receipts
[1:04:38] so already in the word here we can see
[1:04:40] that we are in a battle how many hearers
[1:04:42] has realized that we're in a battle amen
[1:04:45] that's right so but you know we can see
[1:04:47] that we're in a battle we're we're not
[1:04:49] just in a battle we're we're in an epic
[1:04:51] battle we're in one of the greatest
[1:04:53] battles ever fought we are right in the
[1:04:56] very end of the Gentile dispensation
[1:04:58] everybody understand that right we're at
[1:05:01] the very end of the Gentile dispensation
[1:05:02] which means every every side is throwing
[1:05:05] everything they've got into it you know
[1:05:07] the enemy is throwing everything he's
[1:05:09] got into it you know he's he's gotten
[1:05:11] really smart you know he's gotten really
[1:05:13] slick you know in in the in the medieval
[1:05:16] times when we think of even the the days
[1:05:18] when they used to take uh Christians and
[1:05:20] burn them at the stake you know their
[1:05:22] battles were very different than ours
[1:05:23] you know they were short quick battles
[1:05:25] you know they had made a decision were
[1:05:27] taken to the arena and put to death but
[1:05:30] you know it seems like our our battle
[1:05:31] seems to just kind of drag on anybody
[1:05:34] ever notice that you know our battle
[1:05:36] seems to be in a battle of endurance it
[1:05:39] seems to be a battle of social aspects
[1:05:42] and principles and and doctrines and
[1:05:44] Winds of doctrines and all kinds of
[1:05:47] movements and and sicknesses and all you
[1:05:50] know it's it's a it's a it's a time of
[1:05:52] great pressure on the believer and that
[1:05:54] pressure is to do what
[1:05:56] what why do you think the enemy is is
[1:05:58] putting pressure on and putting pressure
[1:06:00] on and putting pressure on why does the
[1:06:02] enemy do that
[1:06:05] is trying to kill us very good brother
[1:06:07] amen somebody knows what's going on out
[1:06:10] there and he's trying to kill us right
[1:06:12] so he's he's he puts pressure on and
[1:06:15] pressure on and what is he doing he's
[1:06:16] finding weak spots in the line you know
[1:06:19] and then you'll you'll find a you know
[1:06:21] there's a weak one in the in the line
[1:06:22] there and then they'll start to focus in
[1:06:24] on that little area there and and start
[1:06:26] to try and break through the lines and
[1:06:27] you know they just keep putting pressure
[1:06:29] on and then they've got arrows flying
[1:06:31] overhead and they've got spearmen in the
[1:06:32] front you know pushing through and then
[1:06:34] they've got rocks and then they're
[1:06:35] pouring boiling water on you and all
[1:06:38] kinds of things now I might be talking
[1:06:39] about boiling water and rocks and Spears
[1:06:42] but you know what these are these are
[1:06:43] you know Facebook social media movies
[1:06:46] music
[1:06:48] what are some of the things that the
[1:06:49] enemy is throwing at us what are some of
[1:06:51] his weapons today
[1:06:53] peer pressure
[1:06:55] peer pressure and peer pressure right
[1:06:58] both of them right
[1:07:00] right our friends can can put pressure
[1:07:02] on us how how do our friends put
[1:07:04] pressure on us
[1:07:06] what are some of the ways that our
[1:07:07] friends put pressure on us
[1:07:13] say that again
[1:07:16] yeah try and influence us now this can
[1:07:19] be at work this can be at school
[1:07:21] right just every day you know oh why do
[1:07:24] you always have to have long hair and
[1:07:25] and you know it's it's why why do you
[1:07:28] always wearing a skirt and you know it's
[1:07:30] just this constant in and out and even
[1:07:32] the brothers why don't you come drink
[1:07:34] with us after work today you know we're
[1:07:35] we're all friends we're co-workers and
[1:07:38] you know people are starting to talk
[1:07:39] about you maybe you don't like us
[1:07:42] you know they start to say little things
[1:07:43] and you know I used to play rugby and
[1:07:45] that was the thing you know is to go
[1:07:47] drink with the boys and you know they
[1:07:49] start to put pressure on you because if
[1:07:50] you don't come drink with us you're not
[1:07:52] really part of our team so now you got a
[1:07:54] decision to make
[1:07:55] now these are these you know we we start
[1:07:58] with easy battles in our life we start
[1:08:00] with the the little things and then we
[1:08:02] move up into bigger things you know it's
[1:08:05] easy sometimes at school it's very black
[1:08:07] and white you can see you know oh my
[1:08:09] goodness you know smoking and drinking
[1:08:10] and ah you know even those things we can
[1:08:12] overcome those things in school and but
[1:08:14] then we get into even Church life huh
[1:08:18] or maybe it's just in Canada maybe I
[1:08:19] should just preach a different sermons
[1:08:21] you know maybe you guys don't have these
[1:08:23] battles but you know let me just go
[1:08:25] through some of these things tonight you
[1:08:27] know we can go into even Church Life and
[1:08:29] there's pressures in church life and
[1:08:31] things maybe doesn't isn't going the way
[1:08:33] you you want them to go or maybe you're
[1:08:35] disappointed or maybe something happens
[1:08:36] right but what is that we've got to
[1:08:38] recognize that we're fighting an enemy
[1:08:41] right and he's going to use not just uh
[1:08:43] you know co-workers and our friends at
[1:08:45] school or rugby mates or or something
[1:08:47] like that or you know he's not gonna you
[1:08:49] know he's gonna move closer to home
[1:08:50] closer to home why because he's
[1:08:52] continually putting pressure on and
[1:08:54] putting pressure on right
[1:08:56] oh my goodness hey I love talking about
[1:08:59] about our weapons of our Warfare amen
[1:09:02] because we are we're on The Winning Side
[1:09:04] we can't lose this battle but it's so
[1:09:07] good for us to look at the tactics of
[1:09:09] the enemy so that we can overcome you
[1:09:11] know we want to overcome and we
[1:09:12] shouldn't be afraid to talk about the
[1:09:14] you know what the enemy's doing out
[1:09:16] there and how we're going to overcome
[1:09:17] him and that Daddy gets his family
[1:09:19] around it after a long hard day and and
[1:09:21] he says you know how was your day and
[1:09:23] the kids maybe talk about something that
[1:09:24] happened at school and then we fortify
[1:09:26] one another you know that's why we go to
[1:09:27] church to glean the word to you know
[1:09:29] faith comes by hearing right that's
[1:09:32] that's that's us gleaning so we can
[1:09:33] fight our enemy better every day right
[1:09:37] amen so if we fight a real enemy he's
[1:09:40] real and it can sometimes come through
[1:09:42] our families and come through churches
[1:09:44] it can come through uh our church
[1:09:46] friends and or school friends or
[1:09:48] co-workers and there's pressure in our
[1:09:50] life so we need to understand that that
[1:09:52] we are wrestling not just against flesh
[1:09:54] and blood you know we could be we could
[1:09:56] see that's oh that's this brother is
[1:09:58] doing this or or this friend is doing
[1:09:59] this or or this musician didn't shake my
[1:10:02] hand or you know whatever right it looks
[1:10:04] like flesh and blood that that looks
[1:10:06] like the enemy but my brother and sister
[1:10:07] we need to look deeper than those things
[1:10:09] you see it's it's in a spirit Realm
[1:10:12] right and you know what it helps my
[1:10:15] brother and sister to see things that
[1:10:16] way that when something happens in your
[1:10:18] life remember you're fighting a devil
[1:10:20] okay and sometimes it might it might
[1:10:22] come through somebody you know but
[1:10:24] remember at the end of the day it's a
[1:10:26] devil right we're not fighting each
[1:10:28] other we're fighting the devil amen
[1:10:31] You Know The Enemy will do that
[1:10:32] sometimes you'll come in dressed looking
[1:10:34] like a friend or you'll come in and
[1:10:37] you'll spy or maybe come in at night
[1:10:39] time to cause confusion you know we see
[1:10:41] even these things in in the in Bible
[1:10:43] stories you know how that at night they
[1:10:45] did things and you know it comes in
[1:10:46] dressed like the enemy tries to do what
[1:10:49] bring deception and confusion right
[1:10:52] so but here here's the important thing
[1:10:54] that that God is telling us
[1:10:57] that we are to take the whole armor of
[1:10:59] God in other words he's made preparation
[1:11:01] for these things he has given us
[1:11:05] something it's already there it's in the
[1:11:07] Armory all we have to do tonight is go
[1:11:10] into the Armory and take possession of
[1:11:12] all the equipment that he's given to us
[1:11:14] he says take take unto you the whole
[1:11:17] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:11:19] withstand the in the evil day
[1:11:22] and having done all to stand I feel like
[1:11:26] we are you know how many here believes
[1:11:28] the Rapture is right here I mean we know
[1:11:30] the Rapture is happening but the Rapture
[1:11:33] is is right here amen I feel like we're
[1:11:36] going to take just another step and
[1:11:37] we're we're going to be out of here so
[1:11:40] we I mean how many more battles have we
[1:11:41] got left you know I started thinking of
[1:11:43] it like this the other day and I thought
[1:11:45] you know if we knew how many Sundays we
[1:11:47] had left of services yes you know even
[1:11:50] covet has kind of taught us that right
[1:11:52] that you know they might only be you
[1:11:54] know 10 Sundays left can you imagine if
[1:11:56] we knew that that the Rapture was going
[1:11:57] to happen 10 Sundays from now what we
[1:11:59] would do in our services how's different
[1:12:01] our services would be right because why
[1:12:04] we want to be ready we want to fight a
[1:12:06] good fight you know I look across this
[1:12:07] room tonight and I would say that we're
[1:12:09] probably all in agreement that we want
[1:12:11] to fight a good fight
[1:12:12] right uh what I don't want to lose right
[1:12:15] I want to win and I want to know that
[1:12:17] what I'm doing is is pleasing to the
[1:12:19] Lord and I want to know that what I'm
[1:12:21] doing is working
[1:12:22] right
[1:12:23] you know we don't want to do stuff in
[1:12:25] our homes and and and find out one day
[1:12:27] well that wasn't you know that wasn't
[1:12:29] going to work
[1:12:30] and then find out that you messed
[1:12:32] everything up and you know legalism can
[1:12:33] do that
[1:12:34] so God has given us specific weapons
[1:12:37] that are that will bring Victory the
[1:12:39] weapons that God gives us brings Victory
[1:12:42] amen therefore are good they're for
[1:12:44] edification they're to strengthen us
[1:12:46] he's a god of peace and kindness and
[1:12:48] love so what God does for us is not to
[1:12:50] hurt us but to give us strength is to
[1:12:53] bring victory in our life amen his
[1:12:56] weapons are not to break us down and not
[1:12:58] to and and not to for us to one day find
[1:13:01] out that it didn't work or it wasn't you
[1:13:03] know we weren't going to win no matter
[1:13:04] what we did no God has called us to be
[1:13:07] Overcomers in this day
[1:13:10] so an army when he plants a war
[1:13:14] you know an army does not uh plan a war
[1:13:18] and plan on being defeated
[1:13:20] you know they they plan on on winning
[1:13:23] how many how many hearers played Sports
[1:13:24] you know just it's okay it's safe how
[1:13:28] many years played sports right I see
[1:13:30] some of you have some are honest some
[1:13:32] are not honest see there's battles going
[1:13:33] on right now right do I raise my hand do
[1:13:35] I not raise my hand is this a trick
[1:13:37] question this is not a trick question
[1:13:40] well that already isn't here it's okay
[1:13:44] right
[1:13:45] so so we played Sports and you know I
[1:13:48] don't remember anybody ever playing a
[1:13:51] sport and planning on losing right right
[1:13:53] we run the race to win we play the game
[1:13:56] to win right and that's good that's what
[1:13:59] you want to be doing we want to be
[1:14:01] victorious when you start a a family or
[1:14:04] you start a a relationship with someone
[1:14:06] even those things you want you plan on
[1:14:08] winning you plan on being successful
[1:14:10] when you start a new career all those
[1:14:12] things my brother sister is pretty
[1:14:13] simple right we want to be successful
[1:14:15] but why not in our Christian walk also
[1:14:18] you know wake up in the morning and pray
[1:14:20] a prayer like Lord I want to be pleasing
[1:14:22] Lord I want to be successful in my
[1:14:24] Christian walk I want I want your will
[1:14:26] to be my will I want to defeat the enemy
[1:14:29] at every turn today Lord I I Lay My Life
[1:14:32] down in your hands let me be victorious
[1:14:34] today instead of letting you know going
[1:14:36] through the same motions of depression
[1:14:38] or anxiety or fear or even sickness but
[1:14:41] Lord today let me overcome that today
[1:14:44] Lord I plan on being successful today I
[1:14:47] plan on being Victorious and to do that
[1:14:50] we've got to we've got to have the
[1:14:51] you've got to make a decision
[1:14:53] you know it comes down to that right you
[1:14:55] you've got to make a decision that I
[1:14:57] want to be successful I want to be
[1:14:59] victorious
[1:15:01] and our brother was singing Jesus Christ
[1:15:03] came he is the Victorious one he is the
[1:15:06] Overcomer so Lord lead me through my day
[1:15:08] today I need a general I need I need a
[1:15:11] captain amen the captain of the host of
[1:15:13] the Lord
[1:15:15] oh my I'm trying not to preach tonight I
[1:15:17] want to do more just talk to you a
[1:15:19] little bit this evening but amen it
[1:15:21] talks you know it feels good to talk
[1:15:23] about these things
[1:15:24] so to to be victorious in the battle
[1:15:28] we must understand our enemy we must
[1:15:31] understand the enemy's tactics to
[1:15:33] overcome them you know it's no no use
[1:15:36] that we go into the battle today with
[1:15:37] swords and Spears
[1:15:39] uh you know why not because the enemies
[1:15:42] using machine guns you know it would be
[1:15:45] a very sad uh day for us we showed up
[1:15:48] there were Spears
[1:15:50] if we have an end time Prophet we have
[1:15:52] musicians we have mother mothers that
[1:15:55] pray
[1:15:56] we've got all everyone in their position
[1:15:58] you know that was the biggest thing in
[1:16:00] Nehemiah restoring the walls of
[1:16:03] Jerusalem was that every family worked
[1:16:05] on their portion of the wall and that
[1:16:07] they weren't distracted with what the
[1:16:09] other ones were doing right everyone had
[1:16:12] their portion to play you know they had
[1:16:14] a map once up in the church and then I
[1:16:16] showed how that you know the one gate
[1:16:18] you know everyone was was building a
[1:16:20] gate or a piece of a wall and and at one
[1:16:22] side it was the the horse gate you know
[1:16:24] that's where all the horses went in and
[1:16:26] out and the Stables were and another
[1:16:28] place was was you know where the where
[1:16:30] where the where the and another place
[1:16:32] was was you know where the where the
[1:16:35] where the food was the food gate and you
[1:16:37] know so everyone had a very specific
[1:16:38] part in the kingdom of God and you know
[1:16:40] there was a dung gate you know that
[1:16:42] there was a garbage gate you know there
[1:16:44] were some gates that were not as
[1:16:45] glorious as the other ones right but it
[1:16:47] was essential if those Gates weren't
[1:16:49] operating and if they weren't uh in the
[1:16:51] right place and somebody wasn't
[1:16:52] restoring them guess what the whole city
[1:16:54] would fall down because you gotta have
[1:16:56] have all those things operating you know
[1:16:58] we might feel Lord my part is so little
[1:17:00] but you know my brother and sister God
[1:17:02] has put every enemy under his feet so if
[1:17:05] you're the little toe in the kingdom of
[1:17:07] God the enemy is still under your feet
[1:17:09] amen so don't underestimate who you are
[1:17:11] and the position God has placed you in
[1:17:15] so God has for this day I'm just reading
[1:17:17] a line here from The Prophet's message
[1:17:19] God has selected his soldiers for this
[1:17:22] day
[1:17:23] that's all of us I'm not talking about
[1:17:25] just pastors and evangelists and you
[1:17:28] know these things that we lift up like
[1:17:29] that and that's fine but my brother and
[1:17:31] sister I'm talking about all of us each
[1:17:33] and every one of us God has selected for
[1:17:35] this end time and you know he saw what
[1:17:37] the enemy would do he saw the the great
[1:17:40] wicked and evil day that we would live
[1:17:42] in my brother and sister he he also saw
[1:17:44] who he was placing here and he knew it
[1:17:47] would be enough to withstand to to shine
[1:17:49] to have a testimony in the darkest
[1:17:51] dismal day
[1:17:53] he picked you and I
[1:17:55] no one else is coming
[1:17:57] he picked you and I to defeat the enemy
[1:17:59] in this day
[1:18:00] wow
[1:18:03] so this great conflict we know began in
[1:18:06] heaven between Michael and his and his
[1:18:08] angels and Lucifer and his his followers
[1:18:11] Lucifer rising up against God thinking
[1:18:13] that he would be lifted higher than he
[1:18:15] he rose up against the word and God's
[1:18:17] order you see in God how did God deal
[1:18:20] with him there
[1:18:22] how did God deal with Lucifer there
[1:18:24] remember this is the very first battle
[1:18:25] right there
[1:18:27] he cast them out
[1:18:29] so even today we have the same process
[1:18:32] we cast out the devil as the Devil comes
[1:18:34] and what does he do he raises himself
[1:18:36] higher than the word right so he'll come
[1:18:39] in sickness when God has said that by
[1:18:41] his stripes we were healed how many
[1:18:43] believes that tonight by stripes we were
[1:18:45] healed right we're just looking at some
[1:18:46] of our our weapons in our Arsenal right
[1:18:49] he said that by his stripes we were
[1:18:50] healed then the enemy Rises up above the
[1:18:52] word
[1:18:53] right isn't that what he's doing rising
[1:18:55] up above the word but we have a right to
[1:18:57] cast him out if you resist the devil he
[1:18:59] shall flee amen how do we resist him how
[1:19:02] do we overcome him right very simply
[1:19:04] tonight Jesus Christ Our Champion showed
[1:19:06] us how to resist him
[1:19:08] I know this sounds so simple tonight
[1:19:10] right
[1:19:11] but it really is
[1:19:12] how did he resist him
[1:19:15] it's written
[1:19:17] it's written devil right it's written
[1:19:19] and he had to do it three times
[1:19:23] but we know the Battleground did not end
[1:19:25] there I'm just going to go through this
[1:19:26] really quickly here the Battleground did
[1:19:28] not end there the Battleground moved
[1:19:29] down to earth okay now God wasn't taken
[1:19:33] off guard when this happened
[1:19:35] God knew God knew the end from the
[1:19:37] beginning he knows the end from the
[1:19:39] beginning he he orchestrated the whole
[1:19:41] thing he allowed all this to happen why
[1:19:43] because he was he wants to be victorious
[1:19:45] in battle amen he wants to prove his
[1:19:48] people his attributes he wants to show
[1:19:50] what we're made of Amen just like he did
[1:19:53] with job it wasn't God wasn't teasing
[1:19:55] job God wasn't trying to be cruel or
[1:19:57] anything like that it wasn't a social
[1:19:59] experiment with God no God wanted to
[1:20:01] draw nigh unto job he wanted job to know
[1:20:04] what his relationship was all about that
[1:20:07] he was strong enough that that his grace
[1:20:09] was sufficient even in those times you
[1:20:12] know so God God knows what he's doing
[1:20:14] he's got a purpose he's got a battle
[1:20:15] plan and he doesn't plan on losing amen
[1:20:18] so when God says have he considered my
[1:20:20] servant you know put your name there
[1:20:21] tonight God has a battle plan he he's
[1:20:24] he's orchestrated it so that even if
[1:20:26] you're one against a thousand you're
[1:20:28] going to win
[1:20:30] God has God has that kind of confidence
[1:20:32] in US
[1:20:36] you see both sides have to meet on a
[1:20:39] common Battlefield
[1:20:40] there's a chosen Battlefield and you can
[1:20:43] see it in in many of the wars both
[1:20:45] generals would try and flex and and
[1:20:47] maneuver and try and outmaneuver the
[1:20:48] other one why it's all about positioning
[1:20:51] on the battlefield but eventually they
[1:20:53] meet on a battlefield and we can go to
[1:20:55] the battlefield in heaven we can go to
[1:20:56] Battlefield in the Garden of Eden so we
[1:20:59] can see how both sides you know Evil
[1:21:01] versus good and God versus Satan all
[1:21:03] these things we can go to all the
[1:21:04] different battlefields and see how they
[1:21:06] tried to outmaneuver each other to get
[1:21:08] to a certain point to to strike at the
[1:21:11] other one
[1:21:12] but we see how that everything is in
[1:21:14] perfect harmony when it comes to the
[1:21:16] word
[1:21:16] God is always in perfect harmony with
[1:21:19] his word you know Jesus Christ when he
[1:21:21] came he could have called Angels out of
[1:21:23] heaven and and they could have removed
[1:21:24] him from the cross or from the Roman uh
[1:21:27] grip you know he could have done all
[1:21:28] those things but what did he do he was
[1:21:30] in harmony with the word all the time I
[1:21:32] can only do it my father shows me so say
[1:21:35] for us it's so important that when we go
[1:21:37] into our battles or we we find ourselves
[1:21:39] in Conflict find ourselves in harmony
[1:21:41] with the word
[1:21:42] you see sometimes we want to jump and
[1:21:44] and oh this would be an easier way let's
[1:21:46] do things this way when God is laid out
[1:21:48] for us how we do things
[1:21:50] amen you know there's simple things and
[1:21:52] I can I'll just say it tonight but if
[1:21:53] you want to see victory in your life
[1:21:55] just line yourself up with a word seek
[1:21:57] ye first the kingdom of God you might
[1:21:58] think what does God need with my money
[1:22:01] you know what does tithing got to do
[1:22:02] with anything
[1:22:03] huh you see we're just lining up with a
[1:22:05] word I mean what is church what does
[1:22:07] going to church have to do with anything
[1:22:09] we're lining up with the word right
[1:22:10] we're finding ourselves in our position
[1:22:12] amen God has orchestrated all these
[1:22:14] things he's got an economy for all these
[1:22:16] things amen he's got a purpose so
[1:22:18] there's it's important to be in harmony
[1:22:20] with a general's instructions
[1:22:26] we can talk about Eve in the Garden of
[1:22:28] Eden but I think we we know that story
[1:22:30] well tonight how the enemy moved in
[1:22:33] trying to get her out of her position
[1:22:35] and try to get her off the word try to
[1:22:37] get her out of harmony with the word
[1:22:39] just a little thing here and a little
[1:22:41] thing there just subtly constantly
[1:22:43] trying to move her off the word right
[1:22:47] so where was the Battleground for for
[1:22:49] Eve
[1:22:50] for Eve it was right there in her mind
[1:22:53] you know so we started to see this
[1:22:54] pattern all throughout the scriptures
[1:22:56] where it always comes down to this
[1:22:57] decision or something that happens in
[1:22:59] the mind
[1:23:01] you know first what happened she saw him
[1:23:04] and then she stopped long enough
[1:23:06] for him to say something
[1:23:08] right you see we can see something we
[1:23:11] can be distracted and pulled aside by
[1:23:13] something and what's the first thing
[1:23:15] that happens is we stop long enough to
[1:23:16] to listen you know an email might come
[1:23:19] in you see the email so these are the
[1:23:21] gates I'm talking about our Warfare
[1:23:22] right this is our battle you know this
[1:23:25] we fight against principalities and
[1:23:27] Powers right so the enemy sends an email
[1:23:30] you know what happens we see the email
[1:23:31] we we're not sure where that email came
[1:23:33] from or maybe we know where that email
[1:23:35] came from but curiosity eh curiosity
[1:23:38] killed the cat right so curiosity causes
[1:23:41] us to open the email right you know
[1:23:43] where this is leading already but you
[1:23:45] open the email
[1:23:47] and there's something negative in there
[1:23:49] or something breaking down your faith or
[1:23:51] just whatever I mean you you can fill in
[1:23:53] the blanks tonight but now you've opened
[1:23:55] up and as soon as you've opened up that
[1:23:57] that email now the mind has been
[1:23:59] activated right because now you start
[1:24:01] reading now memories kick in reasoning
[1:24:03] kicks in the mind has been activated
[1:24:05] you've opened a door in your mind
[1:24:07] you know my brother and sister I've I've
[1:24:09] opened emails and it's like wow I wish I
[1:24:11] never read that you know I walked right
[1:24:14] into this and then you have that
[1:24:16] negative thought or that feeling you've
[1:24:17] got this feeling with you all week you
[1:24:20] just feel uncomfortable you know I did I
[1:24:22] wish I didn't know that or there was a
[1:24:24] struggle that you're facing or maybe
[1:24:25] something happened but you know it
[1:24:27] affects you
[1:24:28] right it affects you and some of those
[1:24:31] things can get really dark they can
[1:24:32] really affect your walk with the Lord
[1:24:34] they can discourage you maybe maybe it
[1:24:36] was a song may you read listen to music
[1:24:38] and that music drives you into
[1:24:40] depression
[1:24:41] you know
[1:24:45] or watching movies
[1:24:47] huh you can it can really mess with your
[1:24:49] mind
[1:24:51] but you open the door and this is really
[1:24:53] where Eve made her mistake as she opened
[1:24:55] the door
[1:24:56] right and it started to work not just in
[1:24:59] her eyesight but it starts to work in
[1:25:01] the next level right what's the enemy
[1:25:03] doing is pushing in right he's breaking
[1:25:05] he's broken through the first gate which
[1:25:07] is the outer Gates right and then he now
[1:25:09] he's in the inside Gates he's in the
[1:25:11] spirit realm what is he doing he's he's
[1:25:12] breaking his way in in through those
[1:25:14] Gates
[1:25:16] you need to realize that I'm under siege
[1:25:19] I'm going to Siege this is not just an
[1:25:22] email anymore this is not just about
[1:25:23] this person anymore it's not just about
[1:25:25] this habit of mine or whatever it might
[1:25:28] be right there's a devil and he's trying
[1:25:31] to kill you
[1:25:35] so where really is this Battleground you
[1:25:36] know the prophet told us the greatest
[1:25:38] battle ever fought is where
[1:25:40] in the mind
[1:25:42] in our minds
[1:25:44] you know let's just settle this once and
[1:25:46] for all right there's nothing wrong with
[1:25:48] God
[1:25:49] amen there's nothing wrong with God
[1:25:51] there's nothing wrong with his word
[1:25:54] you believe this word
[1:25:55] amen there's nothing wrong with the word
[1:25:57] there's nothing wrong with the power of
[1:25:58] God with the Holy Ghost with his
[1:26:00] promises
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:05] so it's all in our mind
[1:26:07] we gotta we gotta fight this thing every
[1:26:09] day
[1:26:10] all the time we're fighting our minds
[1:26:13] there's a battle taking place right here
[1:26:16] we also find out in this moment and we
[1:26:18] could we could preach sermons on this
[1:26:20] literally that right in this moment in
[1:26:23] her mind
[1:26:24] that there is a free moral agency also
[1:26:26] working
[1:26:28] right
[1:26:29] you see if we didn't have free moral
[1:26:31] agency we wouldn't really have a battle
[1:26:32] would we
[1:26:35] God would just pull us drag us through
[1:26:37] life and then set us up for eternity
[1:26:40] and there would be no character
[1:26:42] but he gave us free moral agency
[1:26:45] so that we can have character
[1:26:48] amen he didn't give us free moral agency
[1:26:50] to see if we would make it he knows we
[1:26:52] would make it because he knows the end
[1:26:54] from the beginning he knows what
[1:26:55] decisions we would make
[1:26:57] but so he gave us free moral agency
[1:26:58] someone asked me once he says how does
[1:27:00] that work you know we have free moral
[1:27:02] agency and yet I'm predestinated how
[1:27:04] does that work
[1:27:06] anybody here ever thought about that
[1:27:08] I see there's a few here yeah
[1:27:10] right well let me ask you this question
[1:27:12] I'll answer the question with a question
[1:27:14] whose will is stronger
[1:27:17] your free moral agency or God's will
[1:27:20] I'll just leave that with you but think
[1:27:22] about that
[1:27:23] huh
[1:27:25] God's will to save you is stronger than
[1:27:27] your free moral agency
[1:27:32] you know we talk about our hearts and
[1:27:33] and and if our hearts condemn us and all
[1:27:36] these kinds of things but you know
[1:27:37] there's another scripture it's also
[1:27:38] written God Is Bigger than our heart
[1:27:41] he's greater than a heart
[1:27:43] praise the Lord all right well that's
[1:27:44] for another time
[1:27:46] so we see how this battle is taking
[1:27:48] place in Eve's mind
[1:27:49] right she she was conflicted
[1:27:52] she had free moral agency agency she
[1:27:55] could choose
[1:27:56] she had the ability to make a decision
[1:27:58] which tells me that we're all in the
[1:28:00] same place tonight we all can make
[1:28:03] decisions
[1:28:06] hmm
[1:28:08] Prophet says that the battle raged when
[1:28:11] Eve opened her mind to listen to her
[1:28:13] reasonings
[1:28:17] that is the chosen Battleground for
[1:28:19] today
[1:28:21] why else do we have all the social media
[1:28:23] why else do we have all the streaming
[1:28:26] and access to to whatever we have it's
[1:28:30] all about the mind the eye gate the ears
[1:28:32] the mind
[1:28:34] we're finding a real battle
[1:28:36] you know you can find out anything about
[1:28:38] the message by just typing it in
[1:28:40] searching it out and still know
[1:28:42] absolutely nothing about the message
[1:28:44] because all that's ever happened is
[1:28:46] intellectual conception but never really
[1:28:49] allowing that word to come from your
[1:28:51] mind into your heart
[1:28:52] never really knowing the author amen
[1:28:56] so there's a real battle up here there's
[1:28:58] a lot of intellectualism
[1:29:01] there's a lot of people that can talk
[1:29:02] about the quotes talk about the message
[1:29:04] they can talk about all the the
[1:29:05] scriptures and put things together in
[1:29:07] conspiracies and you know they just they
[1:29:09] just know how to talk about the
[1:29:10] Mysteries and all those things but the
[1:29:12] life
[1:29:12] doesn't line up
[1:29:14] you can't they just can't come to church
[1:29:16] they just can't seem to live a
[1:29:18] Victorious Life can't seem to overcome
[1:29:20] things in their life and you know that
[1:29:21] the family is a mess you know and things
[1:29:23] just seem to break down and break down
[1:29:25] and you got to ask yourself why is this
[1:29:27] person not victorious in battle
[1:29:31] right
[1:29:34] so there's three rounds of of men and
[1:29:36] there's a scripture for this
[1:29:39] first Thessalonians 5 23 it says and the
[1:29:43] Very God of Peace sanctify you holy
[1:29:46] and I pray God your whole spirit and
[1:29:50] soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:29:52] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:56] so there's three Realms of many as we've
[1:29:58] heard the prophet talk taught us and
[1:30:00] here we find the scripture where it's
[1:30:02] where God is praying I pray God
[1:30:05] your whole spirit
[1:30:07] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:30:10] that's a powerful prayer
[1:30:13] you know that's that's can you imagine
[1:30:14] that this flesh
[1:30:16] be blameless
[1:30:18] God you know as a prayer Lord is
[1:30:20] sanctify me wash me you know because
[1:30:23] this flesh can can have scars you know
[1:30:25] there are irreversible things that you
[1:30:27] can do like for instance to give you an
[1:30:29] easy example tonight a tattoo
[1:30:32] right you can get a tattoo no you can't
[1:30:33] get a tattoo sorry but you know if you
[1:30:36] were able to you you get this tattoo on
[1:30:39] your arm you know you're in the world
[1:30:40] and whatever and then you you get saved
[1:30:43] and praise the Lord It's amazing And and
[1:30:46] you're Sanctified and you're washed and
[1:30:47] you receive the Holy Spirit and you're
[1:30:49] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:30:50] but that tattoo is there to to do one
[1:30:54] play with your memory
[1:30:56] it's a battle scar it's a scar that you
[1:30:59] carry all although I'm so I'm I'm
[1:31:01] thankful my brother sister that God
[1:31:03] gives us a new body
[1:31:04] huh a new body all the scars will be
[1:31:06] done away with all the all the all the
[1:31:09] the weaknesses and all those things
[1:31:10] complexes and depressions or whatever it
[1:31:13] may be or the scars of this walk you
[1:31:16] know Prophet says that the resurrection
[1:31:18] will fix everything that life and death
[1:31:20] did to us
[1:31:22] I'm so thankful amen the final great
[1:31:25] Victory but you know we can carry that
[1:31:28] scar there's things that we can do to
[1:31:30] ourselves or that can happen to us
[1:31:32] that cannot be reversed on this side
[1:31:35] but you carry that scar but you can
[1:31:37] still be victorious over those things
[1:31:41] so there's this three rounds the prophet
[1:31:43] says it like this
[1:31:45] he says in the message the Messiah for
[1:31:47] instance when a man gets saved he's just
[1:31:49] about like the light that comes into him
[1:31:51] is about like this little white button
[1:31:53] on my shirt
[1:31:54] that's when God comes into the inner
[1:31:57] part of a man in the inner part of a man
[1:31:58] or a man is made up in the system of a
[1:32:01] Tabernacle in the outer courts then the
[1:32:04] holy place in the holiest of holies the
[1:32:06] Shekinah Glory on the inside the Veil
[1:32:10] I'll go to the next quote here he says
[1:32:12] and now on the outside Gates of a man is
[1:32:15] his five senses that enters to his body
[1:32:17] on the inside which is the soul the soul
[1:32:20] is the nature of the spirit that's on
[1:32:22] the inside of his heart produces his
[1:32:25] soul which makes the atmosphere around
[1:32:26] him he or he has also five entrances
[1:32:29] then on the inside he has only one gate
[1:32:32] one entrance to go into the Shekinah
[1:32:34] Glory where God can enter into him and
[1:32:37] take over in the control tower and that
[1:32:39] way is through self-will
[1:32:41] whether you will or not that's up to you
[1:32:44] but that's the only Avenue that's open
[1:32:47] to the man that God can come into his
[1:32:49] heart is by self-will puts him right
[1:32:52] back like Adam and Eve on free moral
[1:32:54] agency again you can choose right or
[1:32:57] wrong either one you want to
[1:33:00] you might say well if the music was just
[1:33:02] right or if we get a certain evangelist
[1:33:04] through here and man he just preaches
[1:33:06] just the right kind of sermon and you
[1:33:08] know puts just the right kind of words
[1:33:09] together and and then I'll decide to do
[1:33:12] the right thing we do this in our minds
[1:33:15] okay you know it's not a it's nothing to
[1:33:17] be ashamed of you know we have a desire
[1:33:19] to to be changed and so you start to
[1:33:21] look for things to to change you but you
[1:33:23] know you can make if you know that God
[1:33:25] is calling you and God's moving in your
[1:33:27] life you can just make a decision say
[1:33:30] Lord I want to draw nigh unto you yes
[1:33:32] it's that simple Lord I I don't want to
[1:33:35] base this decision on feelings or
[1:33:37] emotions and all those things are fine
[1:33:39] my brother and sister I believe in a
[1:33:40] living God and I believe in in in
[1:33:43] experiences and so and so forth by my
[1:33:46] brother and sister it doesn't have to be
[1:33:48] that let your let your decision be based
[1:33:51] on the word of God based it on something
[1:33:53] solid so that when the battles come and
[1:33:55] and the influences come you can take it
[1:33:57] back to the word not based on how you
[1:33:59] feel because you're not going to feel
[1:34:00] good comes Monday
[1:34:02] right you're going to be tired you're
[1:34:05] going to get weary and all these things
[1:34:06] are going to happen so don't base your
[1:34:08] decisions you make with the Lord on
[1:34:11] emotions because they're like this right
[1:34:15] so we have a free moral agency he says
[1:34:18] you can choose right or wrong either one
[1:34:19] you want to now obviously there's
[1:34:22] there's many other things we need to
[1:34:23] talk about to talk to discuss this
[1:34:26] obviously the Lord is the one who pulls
[1:34:28] and he has a season and we understand
[1:34:29] all those things but I want to show you
[1:34:31] tonight that you have a right if God is
[1:34:33] talking to you and if he is if if you're
[1:34:35] in a battle you have a right to choose
[1:34:37] right from wrong
[1:34:39] and God will give you Grace to overcome
[1:34:41] but you can say Lord I choose right you
[1:34:45] might have you might be battling with a
[1:34:46] habit I don't I don't care what it is
[1:34:48] tonight my brother and sister you can be
[1:34:49] smoking alcoholism whatever you fill in
[1:34:52] the blanks tonight whatever you're
[1:34:53] dealing with you can choose tonight and
[1:34:55] say Lord I'm done with this thing
[1:34:57] sharpen my sword Lord teach my hands to
[1:34:59] do war against the enemy I'm deciding to
[1:35:01] be victorious over this thing maybe it's
[1:35:04] a complex
[1:35:05] and you can say tonight Lord I'm
[1:35:07] deciding tonight that that I don't want
[1:35:09] to live like this anymore you said that
[1:35:11] that the joy of my strength amen so so
[1:35:14] you want you can decide tonight Lord I
[1:35:17] want better I know there's a better way
[1:35:19] I know we I can rise higher than this so
[1:35:21] you have a right to those things
[1:35:23] just like shamgar he realized one night
[1:35:26] he came to himself amen he realized I
[1:35:28] don't have to put up with this anymore
[1:35:29] right you have to put up with those
[1:35:32] things you can overcome
[1:35:33] he's raised us to overcome in this day
[1:35:36] we're raised for such a time as this
[1:35:38] amen
[1:35:40] oh my okay
[1:35:44] Christ revealed in his own word he says
[1:35:46] and last Sunday when he was going into
[1:35:48] those Cycles about how the five senses
[1:35:50] in the outer realm that's the inlet five
[1:35:53] senses to the body there's only one way
[1:35:55] you can get into the body that's why
[1:35:56] those five senses tastes feel smell in
[1:35:59] here there's no other way to contact the
[1:36:01] body okay these are the rules of
[1:36:03] engagement this is how this is set up
[1:36:06] or on the inside of that man is a man
[1:36:08] called Spirit called spirit and he has
[1:36:11] five senses see it goes on next quote
[1:36:13] here he says now you can't think with
[1:36:15] your body you think with your mind and
[1:36:17] in there is is where too many Christians
[1:36:19] only stop and they can it says just like
[1:36:22] the corn in the field and the weed in
[1:36:24] the field they can be Anointed with the
[1:36:26] same holy spirit that the real believer
[1:36:28] is Anointed with but down on the inside
[1:36:30] of that the next realm the Third Realm
[1:36:33] is the soul and that's predestinated by
[1:36:36] God there is where the real sea germ
[1:36:38] lays is in there
[1:36:41] so you walk with the Lord it will your
[1:36:44] your body will be affected by it it'll
[1:36:45] change your walk but it's not based on
[1:36:47] that
[1:36:48] because it's just his flesh
[1:36:50] so let's just simplify it a little bit
[1:36:52] more
[1:36:53] so here you have the three Realms of men
[1:36:56] I wasn't about to start drawing a body
[1:36:58] for you amen I'm not that creative but
[1:37:00] there's three circles the body spirit
[1:37:02] and soul now earlier in the in the
[1:37:04] little sermon tonight uh we were Prophet
[1:37:07] was talking about the Tabernacle he says
[1:37:09] we are built like the Tabernacle you
[1:37:11] know the outer course the Intercourse
[1:37:13] and then the holiest of holies remember
[1:37:14] that part so how many here when they
[1:37:17] were coming into the building tonight
[1:37:18] let's call this the Tabernacle right so
[1:37:21] when they when you came into the
[1:37:22] building tonight how many here felt the
[1:37:24] wind out there
[1:37:25] only a few of you did okay
[1:37:28] it's all right interesting maybe it was
[1:37:30] just me right but we feel the wind and
[1:37:33] if it starts to rain what you know you
[1:37:35] feel the effects of everything that
[1:37:37] happens out there so when you're outside
[1:37:39] of this Tabernacle all the effects of
[1:37:41] the wind and the noise of the cars
[1:37:43] driving by I had to remind myself again
[1:37:45] it was very close but I reminded myself
[1:37:47] again I had to look right first
[1:37:50] not left first coming down the street
[1:37:51] right crossing the street because you
[1:37:54] know back in Canada The Cars first come
[1:37:56] from the left side right
[1:37:57] but this here is a little bit different
[1:37:59] you know go figure but you have to be
[1:38:02] careful but all those things can affect
[1:38:04] you in the outer course here and here
[1:38:06] hopefully I don't have to worry about
[1:38:08] wind they don't have to worry about rain
[1:38:10] you know I'm I'm now in a different
[1:38:12] realm so the different Realms are
[1:38:15] affected by different things amen
[1:38:18] and so we Face different things and here
[1:38:20] we might face you know if it's too hot
[1:38:22] or too cold but out there we might face
[1:38:24] you know lightning strikes or whatever
[1:38:26] it may be if she has bigger things
[1:38:28] moving into smaller things and smaller
[1:38:30] things honing it all the way down into
[1:38:31] that holiest of holies right here where
[1:38:34] the pulpit maybe is and there's one
[1:38:36] voice you know out there there's many
[1:38:37] voices in here there's just one voice
[1:38:39] and so forth so even that our our body
[1:38:43] is made this way
[1:38:44] so out there you know see smell taste
[1:38:47] feel here
[1:38:49] what are some of the the things that can
[1:38:51] influence hearing just quick show of
[1:38:53] hands here
[1:38:54] how many here
[1:38:55] yeah
[1:38:56] music music right can affect hearing
[1:38:58] that's because hearing is what a gate to
[1:39:00] the inside
[1:39:02] so what are some other things that can
[1:39:03] affect hearing
[1:39:07] gossip yeah gossip okay that seems to be
[1:39:10] a popular one yeah
[1:39:12] right what else and that's easy brothers
[1:39:15] and sisters hey you know it's easy to
[1:39:16] gossip
[1:39:17] okay that's easy you'll be talking along
[1:39:20] in a conversation and before you know
[1:39:21] whoa how did I get here
[1:39:24] right it's I get it but it's a battle
[1:39:26] right we're not all perfect but it's a
[1:39:28] battle and you just have to recognize at
[1:39:29] that time in that moment when you
[1:39:31] realize you're walking into a trap just
[1:39:32] say whoa hey I don't this doesn't feel
[1:39:36] good you know good feeling is gone right
[1:39:39] the atmosphere has changed something's
[1:39:41] off you have a right to fight back and
[1:39:44] just say Satan I resist you that's right
[1:39:46] I resist you now I have to say three
[1:39:48] things positive about that person
[1:39:51] fight back amen fight back change the
[1:39:54] atmosphere right okay what else can
[1:39:56] affect our hearing
[1:39:59] noise yeah you know people can get
[1:40:01] really afraid I heard about this girl
[1:40:03] that was that I heard a dog barking
[1:40:05] across the street I mean a dog never
[1:40:07] better or anything like that his brother
[1:40:08] uh Cadre Diggs I think was telling the
[1:40:10] story right and how did that noise right
[1:40:12] and every time she hears a dog bark man
[1:40:14] it triggers something on the inside
[1:40:18] right these things affect us right what
[1:40:21] about uh feel
[1:40:25] right Phil
[1:40:30] interesting right just think about that
[1:40:32] right smell or see sight I mean man we
[1:40:35] could really talk about sight tonight
[1:40:37] you know our cell phones computers
[1:40:41] whatever I mean you name it these are
[1:40:43] all outside Gates
[1:40:45] I would encourage you tonight like The
[1:40:47] Prophet said you know we need to fortify
[1:40:49] we need to recognize our weak spots
[1:40:52] you know recognize our weak spots if
[1:40:54] music is a problem for you you don't
[1:40:56] blame it on everybody else and try and
[1:40:58] control everybody else with your problem
[1:40:59] right we're sensitive to one another I
[1:41:02] get that but you need a you need to
[1:41:04] guard that gate
[1:41:05] right that's something that you're
[1:41:07] fighting
[1:41:08] right just recognize this is a problem
[1:41:11] in my life
[1:41:12] and Lord help me overcome it Lord help
[1:41:15] me be rid of this memory or this feeling
[1:41:17] or sensation you know people get saved
[1:41:20] from the world and come into the message
[1:41:21] and and and they and and and they bring
[1:41:24] that baggage with them sometimes and
[1:41:25] it's hard for them to to say you know to
[1:41:28] to um to forget those things and leave
[1:41:30] it behind they walk past a bar room and
[1:41:33] they hear music or a dancehall and they
[1:41:34] hear music and and what does it do it
[1:41:36] tugs on that the memory in our flesh
[1:41:39] you know just recognize it's the devil
[1:41:42] trying to get at you amen right and say
[1:41:44] Satan I resist you yes yes right I cast
[1:41:47] you down
[1:41:48] you have no right here this this is a
[1:41:50] living place for the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:52] yes not for you you have no influence
[1:41:54] here
[1:41:55] right
[1:41:57] what else can can our site be affected
[1:41:59] by
[1:42:03] food yeah
[1:42:05] I hear you brother
[1:42:07] pray for me
[1:42:10] yes sir
[1:42:11] social media right you see a young
[1:42:14] person do this or you see somebody a
[1:42:16] friend do this or a family member do
[1:42:18] that and how why is it that they're
[1:42:19] always happy and I and I'm not like them
[1:42:22] or my household isn't like that or what
[1:42:24] they're always on vacation it seems like
[1:42:27] huh you know those things are fine and
[1:42:30] so forth but if if you're not in the
[1:42:32] right frame of mind those things can
[1:42:33] wear on you
[1:42:34] and you start to look at your life as
[1:42:36] not fun anymore not exciting and before
[1:42:39] you know it you know you're in some
[1:42:40] weird place
[1:42:42] you know people don't love me God
[1:42:45] doesn't love me and man it's weird you
[1:42:47] know we deal with some really
[1:42:48] interesting stuff
[1:42:49] but it's a battle
[1:42:51] right yeah social media
[1:42:55] influences why can't I do what he's
[1:42:57] doing it this and that and you know
[1:43:00] leave it for your parents to sort out
[1:43:01] right
[1:43:03] so smell taste feel here this is a we we
[1:43:07] drag this guy around with us everywhere
[1:43:11] and he is constantly stimulated he gets
[1:43:14] tired he gets excited right
[1:43:16] but see this all outside things
[1:43:20] all externals outer Court things
[1:43:23] right so let's move to the inside Gates
[1:43:27] now we have some really serious stuff
[1:43:29] because all those things that happen out
[1:43:31] here
[1:43:32] they affect these things in here
[1:43:35] reasoning memory affection conscience
[1:43:38] and imaginations
[1:43:41] oh boy that imagination's ones that's a
[1:43:45] killer
[1:43:46] that brother didn't look at me just
[1:43:48] right
[1:43:49] maybe he doesn't like me next Sunday he
[1:43:52] didn't look at me again
[1:43:53] right imaginations
[1:43:56] right
[1:43:59] you know I'm not from here so I I'm not
[1:44:02] speaking to anybody I have no idea
[1:44:05] right I'm just saying these are battles
[1:44:07] I have faced
[1:44:09] right you face these things why didn't
[1:44:11] they call me this week or you know
[1:44:14] yeah I'm just saying you know our
[1:44:17] imagination can get the better of us you
[1:44:19] can be preaching this is something we
[1:44:21] struggle with as ministers you know we
[1:44:23] can be preaching and you look across the
[1:44:25] congregation and and man that one
[1:44:26] brother he just he doesn't nod his head
[1:44:28] he doesn't he doesn't shake his head he
[1:44:31] and so you started this is something I'm
[1:44:33] saying is it imaginations maybe he's
[1:44:37] listening and he's praying God say
[1:44:38] something Lord please keep moving in
[1:44:41] this direction or you don't know but see
[1:44:43] our imagination
[1:44:45] right because of the eye gate right
[1:44:47] moves into our now the enemy's just
[1:44:49] pressing in right Spears first right why
[1:44:52] to do what to kill you right to destroy
[1:44:55] you right and then you build a complex
[1:44:57] and then it goes from there right and
[1:44:59] then next thing you know you never have
[1:45:00] victory in the services because you're
[1:45:02] letting all those things Define your
[1:45:04] services right
[1:45:06] yeah for musicians it can be really hard
[1:45:09] you know musicians we we tend to be I'm
[1:45:12] a drummer so I'm just putting myself
[1:45:13] right in there but you we tend to be
[1:45:15] emotional
[1:45:17] we tend to be affected by affection and
[1:45:19] things like that because we are
[1:45:21] sensitive to the moving of the Holy
[1:45:22] Spirit right those channels are there in
[1:45:24] our lives because we we're sensitive to
[1:45:26] the moving of the Holy Ghost but then if
[1:45:28] if somebody says something or you're not
[1:45:30] used
[1:45:31] right
[1:45:33] I used to be a very eager drummer I
[1:45:37] wanted to play every service man because
[1:45:39] I loved it and then you don't get used
[1:45:42] right maybe I'm not good enough right
[1:45:45] and you know it's a battle right I'm
[1:45:47] talking about some really simple things
[1:45:49] but these things can get real deep and
[1:45:52] you can get into some really serious
[1:45:54] stuff where you get roots of bitterness
[1:45:55] in our life
[1:45:57] really where people get bitter and angry
[1:46:00] and you start treating people uh from
[1:46:02] that from that angle of bitterness
[1:46:06] it can get very serious
[1:46:09] hmm
[1:46:11] I'm talking to just the young people
[1:46:12] tonight you know because us older ones
[1:46:13] we've beaten all these things right
[1:46:16] right we've overcome them amen
[1:46:19] and then right there in the soul realm
[1:46:20] is Faith and doubt
[1:46:22] and it's interesting how the prophet
[1:46:24] says that it's down there where the
[1:46:25] control tower is
[1:46:27] so you you either and I think it's
[1:46:29] interesting that it's not based on what
[1:46:31] you see in your soul realm it's based on
[1:46:33] faith
[1:46:34] is based on faith do you believe in God
[1:46:38] so every time and and I'm going to close
[1:46:40] because because I feel like
[1:46:43] um you know we're getting to a point
[1:46:44] here but if if you just look at the
[1:46:47] whole the overall picture right
[1:46:50] we can either we can either we can
[1:46:52] receive all those things with the
[1:46:54] attitude of doubt
[1:46:56] right so something happens and
[1:46:59] immediately you you go negative
[1:47:01] right you go negative you take a
[1:47:03] negative route
[1:47:04] or you can receive those things and take
[1:47:06] a positive route and say Lord You're
[1:47:08] greater than that situation
[1:47:10] Lord you understand what's happening in
[1:47:11] that person's life Lord you know my
[1:47:14] desire right so take a positive
[1:47:17] reaction have faith
[1:47:20] right doctor tells you I'll just tell
[1:47:22] you something simple right doctor tells
[1:47:24] you that you're sick
[1:47:25] okay you're sick
[1:47:27] well he's the doctor
[1:47:29] you know he's trained in this so that's
[1:47:31] your reasoning right he's trained he
[1:47:33] must know what he's talking about you
[1:47:35] know there's a story of a man that that
[1:47:37] was told he was he had cancer how many
[1:47:39] has heard the story he was told he had
[1:47:41] cancer he didn't actually have cancer
[1:47:43] but the doctor diagnosed him wrong said
[1:47:45] he has cancer
[1:47:48] and then as time went on this man got
[1:47:49] sicker and he got sicker and he got
[1:47:51] sicker and then one day they found out
[1:47:54] he doesn't have cancer and the doctor
[1:47:55] told him hey wait I might I made the
[1:47:57] wrong uh prognosis you don't actually
[1:47:59] have cancer I mixed the the documents up
[1:48:02] with somebody else
[1:48:03] but see because of his reasoning that's
[1:48:05] that's incredible because of his
[1:48:07] reasoning because of opening his ear
[1:48:09] gate and his reasoning and accepting
[1:48:11] what he was saying
[1:48:12] what happened
[1:48:14] he got sick
[1:48:17] wow
[1:48:19] you see how powerful our words are how
[1:48:21] powerful this battle is that we we fight
[1:48:24] I mean that's just sickness I mean what
[1:48:25] about everything else
[1:48:28] wow
[1:48:32] creating something out of nothing
[1:48:35] the power of this this mind reasoning or
[1:48:38] you could take that doctor's prognosis
[1:48:41] and he could say well thank you doctor I
[1:48:43] appreciate all your hard work
[1:48:45] but I know somebody else I have another
[1:48:47] prognosis amen and he said that I'm
[1:48:50] Healed
[1:48:51] right take that why not take that over
[1:48:54] what the doctor said
[1:48:55] right
[1:48:57] that's how we fight this battle but you
[1:48:59] see this is really where it comes down
[1:49:00] to his faith
[1:49:02] you know Abraham was was told
[1:49:05] you're gonna have a son you're gonna
[1:49:06] have a nation's going to come out of you
[1:49:08] and Sarah
[1:49:10] huh and he had to wait 25 years
[1:49:13] 25 years for that promise to come to
[1:49:15] pass don't tell me he didn't have a
[1:49:17] battle every day
[1:49:20] to the point where God had to make them
[1:49:22] both young again for that promise to
[1:49:23] live in their lives but the Bible tells
[1:49:26] us that Abraham staggered not at the
[1:49:28] promise of God
[1:49:30] you know there was times in his life
[1:49:32] where he didn't understand so he had
[1:49:34] Hagar and he had made all he made
[1:49:36] mistakes but you know God did not change
[1:49:38] his promise to Abraham
[1:49:41] so let us have faith
[1:49:42] let's have faith I want to encourage you
[1:49:44] young people have faith in God right all
[1:49:47] these outside things don't let them be
[1:49:49] governed by all the outside influence
[1:49:51] don't let your life be governed by those
[1:49:53] outside influences but let your life be
[1:49:54] governed from faith
[1:49:56] amen walk in faith we do not walk by
[1:49:58] side we don't walk after the flesh we
[1:50:00] walk after the spirit we walk in faith
[1:50:03] amen
[1:50:05] amen
[1:50:07] see those five senses were given to you
[1:50:10] to contact this Earth
[1:50:12] but it's not necessarily Who You Are
[1:50:17] you talking about all these things see
[1:50:19] that's where the free moral agency is in
[1:50:21] our mind reasonings all those things the
[1:50:23] Battleground the mind the intelligence
[1:50:25] the brain
[1:50:26] it's a great Battleground
[1:50:30] but the Bible tells us that God has not
[1:50:31] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[1:50:35] and of love
[1:50:36] and of a sound mind
[1:50:40] you say that sink in for a moment
[1:50:43] and of a sound mind
[1:50:46] the Bible tells us to fortify the mind
[1:50:48] to put on the helmet of salvation what
[1:50:51] is salvation it's a defense
[1:50:54] of Deliverance that is what salvation is
[1:50:57] it's a defense or a deliverance from
[1:50:59] something
[1:51:01] or restoration or preservation
[1:51:04] a restoration what does the helmet do it
[1:51:07] protects the mind but on the helmet of
[1:51:10] salvation
[1:51:12] so many beautiful things that God has
[1:51:14] done for us we're not going to have time
[1:51:15] tonight but I'm just going to close here
[1:51:19] you see just the underlying part there
[1:51:21] where the Prophet says what is your mind
[1:51:23] controlled by it's your spirit see your
[1:51:26] spirit catches the word of God and
[1:51:27] that's the thing that's got life in it
[1:51:29] it brings life into you
[1:51:32] that's powerful so even the spirit of
[1:51:35] reasoning of fears and of doubts and all
[1:51:37] those things what can this mind be
[1:51:39] controlled we've been given a sound mind
[1:51:41] amen so what do we do right we take the
[1:51:45] word of God faith cometh by hearing
[1:51:46] hearing the word of God what does he do
[1:51:48] he builds up our faith amen that word
[1:51:51] comes in by his stripes I'm Healed right
[1:51:53] so then the rest of the body becomes
[1:51:55] subject to that word see it's very
[1:51:58] simple
[1:51:58] right so we we actually decide let me
[1:52:01] put it like this and I respect each and
[1:52:03] every one of you and say this very
[1:52:04] sincerely but we actually decide to be
[1:52:07] depressed we actually decide okay if you
[1:52:11] if you look at it the whole picture you
[1:52:13] actually decide to be hurt you decide in
[1:52:16] in your mind in your conscience and your
[1:52:18] reasonings you decide to let those
[1:52:20] things affect you
[1:52:22] that's that is why this is a battle
[1:52:28] thank you you see something can happen
[1:52:30] in your life you can say man this was
[1:52:31] really cruel this was really bad
[1:52:34] but then you find that scripture that
[1:52:36] says all things work together for good
[1:52:38] to them that love God
[1:52:40] how do you reconcile that yes you just
[1:52:43] say Lord this was hard
[1:52:45] I don't understand it but I know you
[1:52:48] love me
[1:52:49] I know you love me and this happened to
[1:52:52] me because there's a greater purpose and
[1:52:54] maybe I don't see it Lord but Lord give
[1:52:56] me strength to face this Lord you said I
[1:52:59] can bring my cares to you and lay them
[1:53:01] at your feet because you care for me see
[1:53:03] it's all about how we re how we react or
[1:53:06] receive things in our lives
[1:53:08] it's a battle we are fighting a battle
[1:53:10] day in Day Out
[1:53:13] or we can say man God must be a cruel
[1:53:15] God or not love me
[1:53:18] because of what happened to me
[1:53:20] but you have a problem because you have
[1:53:22] a scripture that says that all things
[1:53:23] work together for your good
[1:53:25] that he wants to bring you to an
[1:53:27] expected end
[1:53:29] that he loves you that the footsteps of
[1:53:31] the righteous are ordered of the Lord so
[1:53:33] does that mean suddenly he didn't order
[1:53:34] your footsteps does that mean that he he
[1:53:36] wasn't there he said I would never leave
[1:53:38] you nor forsake you
[1:53:40] huh
[1:53:42] I don't know take it up with him I'm
[1:53:43] just telling you what the word tells us
[1:53:45] but see we get into a spot in our life
[1:53:47] my brother sister I want to encourage
[1:53:49] you we're in a battle then it's not
[1:53:50] going to get easier
[1:53:52] but we need to feed on the word
[1:53:55] and start taking what God Said over
[1:53:57] what's happening in our lives sometimes
[1:53:59] or all the time
[1:54:04] okay we don't have time for all this but
[1:54:06] here's really the thing right
[1:54:09] down there in the soul Realm like they
[1:54:11] like the prophet says in your heart is
[1:54:13] actually this little chamber a secret
[1:54:15] chamber right where the sea Gene of God
[1:54:17] is God planted a seed there in good
[1:54:19] ground right the seed of seed word of
[1:54:22] God of God
[1:54:23] that the prophet says is the control
[1:54:25] tower he says it's the real you the real
[1:54:28] you is right here so the real you is not
[1:54:32] my affections not my memories think
[1:54:35] about that
[1:54:36] right it's not all those things it's not
[1:54:38] what I touch feel smell here that's not
[1:54:41] the real me
[1:54:42] the real me is is in here
[1:54:45] right because the old you would smoke
[1:54:47] the old you would be attracted to the
[1:54:49] things of this world but see the real
[1:54:51] you doesn't have a desire for that you
[1:54:54] see what I'm saying tonight
[1:54:56] see that's where that predestinated seed
[1:54:58] dwells the Temple of the Holy Ghost the
[1:55:00] sixth sense as the prophet calls it
[1:55:01] which is Faith or Zoe life
[1:55:04] or the heart of God right here
[1:55:10] he says that's the guidepost that's the
[1:55:12] control tower the inside of the inside
[1:55:13] the soul controls the spirit the spirit
[1:55:16] controls the body
[1:55:18] right A New Life a new creature in
[1:55:21] Christ Jesus do we see why it's so
[1:55:23] important to be born again
[1:55:24] I mean I'm closing we can stand together
[1:55:26] tonight
[1:55:27] you see why it's so important to be born
[1:55:29] again
[1:55:33] because we need we need God to be in the
[1:55:36] control tower
[1:55:37] we need the Holy Ghost leading Our Lives
[1:55:39] because if he's leading what does it do
[1:55:42] he makes our decisions
[1:55:45] he's our affections amen he he rewrites
[1:55:48] everything I'll write my my laws on the
[1:55:50] fleshy tables of your heart he said amen
[1:55:52] he he it's a new and a living way you
[1:55:55] know someone said to me once you know
[1:55:56] about there was this young person came
[1:55:59] out of a meeting and he's and he said
[1:56:01] man we were just told you know
[1:56:03] that we inherit everything from our
[1:56:05] parents and all its traits and and anger
[1:56:08] and all these things and and and you
[1:56:10] know it was really distraught about this
[1:56:12] you know because he just heard this and
[1:56:13] and now he's thinking about you know
[1:56:15] what am I going to do because you know
[1:56:17] I've inherited I know how my father was
[1:56:18] and I've inherited some of these things
[1:56:20] and I said to him wait a second wait a
[1:56:22] second what does the Bible say right the
[1:56:25] Bible says that you're a new creature in
[1:56:27] Christ Jesus
[1:56:28] and life I now love is not my own but
[1:56:31] it's Christ that lives through me
[1:56:33] you see what I mean my brother sister
[1:56:35] that's the control tower we don't have
[1:56:36] to put up with those things everything
[1:56:38] stops when Jesus Christ comes into your
[1:56:40] heart everything is new you have a right
[1:56:43] to Joy you have a right to happen is you
[1:56:45] have a right to to uh guiltlessness amen
[1:56:48] you have a light a right to being
[1:56:50] innocent to being forgiven you have a
[1:56:52] right to to all those things to health
[1:56:54] and and having Victory and overcoming
[1:56:57] you have a right to those things because
[1:56:59] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:57:02] amen
[1:57:03] amen there's so many things we could
[1:57:05] talk about tonight but I just trust that
[1:57:07] that you feel in your hearts as I I even
[1:57:09] feel inspired this evening I just feel
[1:57:11] Lord I want I want to have victory in
[1:57:13] the battle yes you know I'm not planning
[1:57:15] on getting up tomorrow morning and being
[1:57:17] defeated

[1:57:19] showing up again on Sunday in the same
[1:57:21] routine no I want to I want to take
[1:57:23] possession
[1:57:24] you know
[1:57:26] I want to take possession
[1:57:28] I love that you know the the Roman
[1:57:30] Legions you know when they used to come
[1:57:32] together and they would do their battle
[1:57:34] formations they would just give a
[1:57:35] command and that whole unit you know
[1:57:37] would come into a box or make a circle
[1:57:40] or you know they would make all these
[1:57:41] different things or make a a an
[1:57:43] arrowhead you know and they had reasons
[1:57:45] for all that you know and everybody knew
[1:57:47] their place and position and then when
[1:57:49] they made contact with the Enemy you
[1:57:50] know they would just stand there and
[1:57:51] then they would and then the command
[1:57:53] would come to press forward and it would
[1:57:55] just take a step that whole unit would
[1:57:57] move forward one big step right and and
[1:57:59] push back on the enemy like that right
[1:58:01] what they're doing they're putting
[1:58:02] pressure on the enemy pressure on the
[1:58:04] enemy but they're not moving backwards

[1:58:13] everything's there they put on the whole
[1:58:15] armor of God they're battle ready yeah
[1:58:17] and then they get into position and they
[1:58:19] come together and and they sing songs of
[1:58:21] worship amen that's the Lord dwells in
[1:58:23] the Praises of his people right what
[1:58:25] does that do it opens up the channels
[1:58:27] that and everybody's in their position

[1:59:06] them down
