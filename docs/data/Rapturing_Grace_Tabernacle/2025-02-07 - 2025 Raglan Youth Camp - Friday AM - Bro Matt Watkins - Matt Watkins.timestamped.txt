[45:00] for being you I must say you look a lot
[45:03] brighter than you did last night when we

[45:15] mentally spiritually to receive

[45:24] about the word I mean we enjoy every
[45:26] part of camp we we encourage every part
[45:28] of camp we we want to enjoy the word but
[45:31] we also want to enjoy the fellowship and
[45:33] and I want to encourage you make friends
[45:36] with people that you know if the Lord
[45:38] should T that in future you you know
[45:41] you're going to interact all of your
[45:43] lives and these are good friends to
[45:47] have I I mean that I really thank the
[45:50] Lord for this opportunity for you know
[45:52] for young ones from different and
[45:54] forgive me if I call you young but you
[45:56] know it's all relative right but um for
[46:00] to have the opportunity to make
[46:02] friendships and and in some cases we
[46:04] have some International visitors also um
[46:07] and uh you know it's a cross cross
[46:09] country border borders and so on and
[46:12] it's just a really good opportunity so
[46:14] it's I will also encourage you get out
[46:16] of your little circle or your little
[46:19] click not that I'm saying there's clicks
[46:20] here but you know it's just natural for
[46:23] us to fellowship with the people that we
[46:25] used to but maybe maybe get out of our
[46:27] comfort zones a little bit and make
[46:30] friends with people that you know that
[46:32] that can be a blessing to us um in the
[46:36] long run also in other churches and
[46:38] things yeah I'm hesitant to say it but
[46:41] you know perhaps there's husbands and
[46:42] wives sitting there somewhere that you
[46:44] don't know about yet but I'm going to
[46:46] get in trouble with some of the pre
[46:48] parents so I won't say that too
[46:50] loud I'll repeat what I said here last
[46:53] year I think it was brother Freddy um he
[46:55] said he said to his youth there we go
[46:57] oh no
[46:58] grandpa he says he said to his youth you
[47:01] have to start thinking of one another as
[47:03] more than just brothers and
[47:06] sisters so praise the
[47:08] Lord um so firstly thank you very much
[47:11] for those song items really appreciated
[47:13] that um and I will encourage you all
[47:16] continue each one of those song items so
[47:18] far has just been wonderful and special
[47:21] and and anointed um and let the Lord use
[47:24] those gifts in your lives to to uh open
[47:27] the path for the service and open the
[47:29] path for the word to come and be a
[47:31] blessing you know sometimes you know
[47:33] sometimes people are reborn and filled
[47:35] with the Holy Ghost when someone sings a
[47:37] song item you know the Lord uses
[47:39] different ways to touch hearts and
[47:41] change change
[47:43] Hearts so I don't want to take a lot of
[47:45] time but there's just a few practical
[47:47] things I would just like to um to just
[47:49] mention so that we all kind of on the
[47:51] same page
[47:53] firstly um some of you would have
[47:55] noticed that the um some of
[47:59] the it's hard to say adults because most
[48:02] of you are adults too let's say the
[48:03] oldies and then I'll get in trouble on
[48:05] the other side um sitting with their
[48:08] phones during the service now it's not
[48:10] because we are bored with a service um
[48:13] after today's service and after tomorrow
[48:15] morning we have a quiz so what we're
[48:18] doing is we're listening for things that
[48:21] um that could be used in the quiz so we
[48:24] all send our our questions in
[48:27] um of course that brings me to the
[48:29] Practical side of it also so um I think
[48:31] it's at is it at 12:30 if I remember
[48:34] right yeah we we have a quiz year and
[48:37] the questions are going to come from
[48:39] yesterday's services and this morning's
[48:41] service um and obviously that's also
[48:44] part of the team competition so um
[48:47] so that should not be your motive for
[48:49] listening but if if you need a motive
[48:51] then
[48:53] listen praise the Lord um also um you
[48:57] would have seen on the program that um
[48:59] we have a testimony service tonight now
[49:02] that testimony is specifically brother
[49:04] Travis who's traveled with brother
[49:06] Matthew um he's going to share his
[49:08] testimony tonight so I'll I'll just um
[49:11] describe to you how that's going to work
[49:12] so we all going to go down those of you
[49:14] who were here last year will know down
[49:17] by the U the air rifles and and the um
[49:20] archery so we can have another bonfire
[49:23] tonight um and then down there um um
[49:26] brother Travis is going to share his
[49:28] testimony so um we were very thankful
[49:31] there's a fire ban in place here but we
[49:34] U by God's grace got got granted a fire
[49:36] permit so we'll be able to make the
[49:37] bonfire so we thank the Lord for that so
[49:40] that's exciting that was very special
[49:41] last
[49:43] year um also again a reminder I know
[49:46] Mana made this announcement yesterday um
[49:48] so by tomorrow morning um we don't have
[49:51] a normal service we we'll have the
[49:53] question and answer service to tomorrow
[49:55] morning um so I want to again encourage
[49:58] you all to hand me questions and if I'm
[50:01] too scary hand it to any of the any of
[50:03] the yellow jackets as I call them and um
[50:08] and then they will pass it on to me now
[50:11] there's a few things that I know some of
[50:12] you had questions about or were nervous
[50:14] about um so firstly I want your name on
[50:17] the question that's important for me um
[50:21] but I won't announce whose question it
[50:24] is so as far as everyone else is concern
[50:26] and it's an anonymous question um but
[50:29] it's just for me to know is asking the
[50:30] question and there's there's important
[50:32] reasons for that um so that's the first
[50:34] thing you're welcome to ask questions
[50:36] you ask can ask questions about
[50:37] absolutely anything um in your in your
[50:41] spiritual walk in the Bible in the
[50:42] message or anything like that of course
[50:44] I'm Not For a Moment claiming to know
[50:47] everything and if I don't know I will
[50:48] just tell you I don't know um but um I
[50:52] think it's a wonderful opportunity so I
[50:54] want to encourage you don't wait till
[50:55] tomorrow morning puts a lot of pressure
[50:57] on me it did last year right please give
[51:00] them to me now if you can directly after
[51:03] service and and if you want to just send
[51:05] it to me by text or write it on a piece
[51:07] of paper or whatever it is feel free to
[51:09] do that so last year we had a wonderful
[51:12] time it was one of the highlights of
[51:15] Camp um we had a really really special
[51:17] time with a Q&A and I trust that that
[51:19] the Lord will bless it again we we
[51:21] depend on him for everything um the
[51:24] other question that some had is is the
[51:26] question and answers going to be
[51:28] streamed um because that you know
[51:31] inhibits people a little bit if they
[51:32] know that Mom and Dad is is at home
[51:35] listening to what's being asked or or
[51:37] whatever it is um excuse me we're not
[51:40] going to stream it publicly we're going
[51:42] to put it on YouTube privately and I'll
[51:45] share the link with you afterwards um so
[51:47] you can go back and listen to it again
[51:50] but we're not going to make it publicly
[51:52] available so then everyone knows exactly
[51:55] where that is also
[51:58] praise the Lord so those are the the
[52:00] announcements um excuse me I also want
[52:04] to wish the most wonderful woman in the
[52:06] room a wonderful 27th anniversary

[1:01:42] to the word this morning now I just am
[1:01:44] going to take a little bit of a turn uh
[1:01:47] from where the direction we've been
[1:01:48] going and want to do just uh just the
[1:01:51] way the Lord led me just to do more um I
[1:01:54] guess I would call it maybe teaching
[1:01:56] gear uh for the morning services and
[1:01:59] then uh the Lord's got something real uh
[1:02:02] heavy upon my heart for this evening so
[1:02:04] you just be an expectation for that amen
[1:02:06] how many expect to meet the Lord to see
[1:02:08] the Lord to touch the Lord amen you know
[1:02:10] I just want to say that no matter what I
[1:02:12] do no matter what I say no matter what
[1:02:14] we do at this Camp there's only one
[1:02:16] thing that really matters out of all of
[1:02:19] it and that is that you touch the Lord
[1:02:22] Jesus that's all that really matters
[1:02:24] doesn't matter what happens uh who you
[1:02:27] see what takes place so long as you
[1:02:30] touch him amen and I believe that he can
[1:02:33] be touched how many believe that amen he
[1:02:36] can be touched we'll go as far as we can
[1:02:38] this morning I want to give this a title
[1:02:41] this morning being changed you'll see
[1:02:43] where that comes from here in a moment
[1:02:46] being changed uh Romans chapter 7 and
[1:02:50] I'm just going to read a few verses and
[1:02:52] then I'll have you be seated let me just
[1:02:54] uh find just a note here I wanted to
[1:02:57] make sure brother Joseph did you get
[1:02:59] that also the uh the power the slide the
[1:03:02] second slide that I sent if you have
[1:03:04] that you could just have that ready
[1:03:08] amen let's just begin reading here let
[1:03:10] me find my
[1:03:16] place let's start at verse 14 Romans 7
[1:03:20] I've started my timer so uh you guys can
[1:03:22] Rejoice I've got a little timer here and
[1:03:25] I usually do it at our home church and
[1:03:27] they really like it brother Al They I
[1:03:28] think they said it with me though so
[1:03:30] they know when I'm out of time so I keep
[1:03:32] it on silent so they don't know when it
[1:03:33] goes off and my kids accuse me of
[1:03:35] hitting the snooze button you know over
[1:03:37] and over and over but I just tell our
[1:03:39] church you know when my timer goes off
[1:03:41] that don't mean I'm done it just means
[1:03:42] we've stepped into
[1:03:44] [Laughter]
[1:03:46] eternity praise the Lord very funny
[1:03:49] brother
[1:03:51] Matt verse 14 let's just begin reading
[1:03:54] here Romans very familiar for we know
[1:03:58] that the law is spiritual but I how many
[1:04:02] can say I am carnal sold sold under sin
[1:04:08] I want you to pay careful attention to
[1:04:10] Paul's words when you read this it's
[1:04:13] almost as if you slipped into the
[1:04:15] Diaries of the Apostle Paul and he's
[1:04:17] trying to express something that's so
[1:04:19] hard to express yet so relatable to all
[1:04:23] those who serve the Lord yeah and he's
[1:04:26] expressing it something that we could
[1:04:28] all relate to very much but notice the
[1:04:30] way he words this for I am carnal sold
[1:04:34] under sin that means that I'm under the
[1:04:37] Dominion of sin when I'm born yeah so
[1:04:41] when you're born you didn't have a
[1:04:43] choice right you didn't you didn't get
[1:04:46] to choose but you were actually the
[1:04:48] Bible says the creature was made subject
[1:04:52] or slave to vanity that's actually in
[1:04:55] your carnal nature when you're born
[1:04:57] doesn't matter who your dad your mom
[1:04:58] your last name doesn't matter what
[1:05:00] brandom wouldn't matter you're sold
[1:05:03] under sin a sin desire is inside of you
[1:05:05] before you ever got to choose and so
[1:05:09] you're sold under the Dominion it's your
[1:05:11] master it's your slave you can you can
[1:05:14] take that that individual who's born in
[1:05:16] the world maybe never born in the
[1:05:18] Christian home and they could be moral
[1:05:20] they could be good moral people they
[1:05:23] could uh uh discipline their body in
[1:05:25] such a way that you'd think my it's a
[1:05:27] good person and they love animals and
[1:05:30] they give to the poor but yet if they
[1:05:32] never meet the Lord Jesus and they know
[1:05:35] him in the power of his resurrection and
[1:05:37] their soul all you're doing is reforming
[1:05:40] the outside but the inside is a slave to
[1:05:44] sin and so Paul says you're sold slave
[1:05:48] for I know know this Lotus here in verse
[1:05:50] 15 for that which I do allow not for
[1:05:53] what I would that do I not but what I
[1:05:55] hate that do I if I then I do that which
[1:05:58] I would not I can sit into the law that
[1:05:59] it is good now then it is no more I that
[1:06:02] do it notice but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:06:07] for I know now I want you to watch
[1:06:09] because this is going to help you I I
[1:06:11] believe with all my heart my brother and
[1:06:13] my sister if we could understand Romans
[1:06:16] 7 and the way that that it was taught
[1:06:18] correctly by God's Prophet it would not
[1:06:21] just help you it's one thing to know
[1:06:23] about the Lord and that's wonderful but
[1:06:25] sometimes we need to learn about ourself
[1:06:28] and how did God make me what what do I
[1:06:32] mean somebody say me me amen now what do
[1:06:35] we mean when we say me you see it's more
[1:06:39] simple than just giving your name
[1:06:42] because that's just an Earthly identity
[1:06:44] and brother brandham says that maybe
[1:06:45] there we won't be named John or maybe
[1:06:48] maybe maybe we we'll be named something
[1:06:50] else so that's just our Earthly identity
[1:06:52] in fact your last name doesn't really
[1:06:55] ident ify who you really are that's just
[1:06:58] brother brandham said I realized one day
[1:07:00] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:07:02] brandham I'm born of the spirit of God
[1:07:04] that's my true nature that's my true
[1:07:07] last
[1:07:08] name and so when we say me what do we
[1:07:11] really saying it's more complex because
[1:07:14] we we when we say me it's more
[1:07:17] dimensional it's not just the person you
[1:07:19] see in the mirror but it's actually much
[1:07:21] deeper than that so notice how the
[1:07:24] Apostle Paul begins to relate this and
[1:07:26] he says here in verse uh let me find it
[1:07:28] here Verse 18 for I know that is that in
[1:07:32] me notice the parentheses that is in my
[1:07:36] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[1:07:42] it's present with me but how to perform
[1:07:47] that which is good I find not how many
[1:07:51] feel that way I want to serve the Lord I
[1:07:54] want to always do what right but somehow
[1:07:57] I don't always do that for the good that
[1:08:01] I would do not but the he says for the
[1:08:03] good that I would I do not but the evil
[1:08:07] which I would not that I do now if I do
[1:08:10] that I would not it is no more I that do
[1:08:13] it but sin that dwelleth in me I find
[1:08:16] then a law like gravity it's a law I
[1:08:20] find then a law that when I would or
[1:08:23] want to do good or desire to do the
[1:08:26] right evil is present with me for I now
[1:08:31] who is he talking about this part for I
[1:08:35] Delight in the word the law of God after
[1:08:39] the inward man but I see another law in
[1:08:43] my members
[1:08:45] Waring let me just say this my brother
[1:08:47] my sister if you feel that there's a war
[1:08:50] to do right you don't always do right
[1:08:52] sometimes you do wrong and you're in a
[1:08:54] battle you should say say thank God that
[1:08:56] means I've made it because if there's
[1:08:59] not a war that tells you the devil's
[1:09:01] still got you for I see there's a war
[1:09:04] against the law of my mind bringing me
[1:09:06] into captivity the law of sin which is
[1:09:08] in my members oh Wretched Man that I am
[1:09:10] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:09:12] this death and I can say with my hands
[1:09:14] raised I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:09:17] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[1:09:19] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[1:09:22] the law of sin Jesus we just bow heads
[1:09:25] before you now Lord knowing that already
[1:09:29] just having read these words we've
[1:09:31] already received a blessing now God it
[1:09:34] would be even a greater thing and a
[1:09:36] Grace for you to take these words that
[1:09:38] you've given me Lord and may you just
[1:09:40] break the bread of life to your children
[1:09:42] may it may it bring strength to the weak
[1:09:45] Lord may it bring Deliverance to the
[1:09:47] captives May if we can accomplish one
[1:09:49] purpose May the enemy be defeated in
[1:09:52] these young people's lives we ask it in
[1:09:54] the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] and the church saiden you can be
[1:10:01] seated brother Bron be is ask this same
[1:10:04] question in questions and answers and
[1:10:06] I'm just going to list it here to just
[1:10:08] before you as you see the question that
[1:10:10] he asks and and this is uh not not
[1:10:13] clicking here so you can just Advance it
[1:10:15] that's okay brother Joseph you can go
[1:10:17] with me here notice here as brother bham
[1:10:20] has asked this question about Romans
[1:10:22] chapter 7 and he says here and if you
[1:10:24] notice the slide it's actually what you
[1:10:27] just now read in black but in blue on
[1:10:30] the bottom is the man's question such a
[1:10:32] big question so complicated this I
[1:10:37] cannot understand and it's brother
[1:10:40] bandam gives us Insight here and he says
[1:10:42] let me just kind of Polish it up so you
[1:10:44] can see he said in me is two persons
[1:10:50] right one wants me to do brother bam
[1:10:53] says wrong the other wants me to and
[1:10:55] he's going to say right and every time I
[1:10:58] start to do right then the wrong Kinders
[1:11:01] me how many of you people out in the a
[1:11:04] interviews this afternoon has run the
[1:11:06] same thing this morning the same thing
[1:11:08] so so Paul begins to list this here and
[1:11:11] I just want to just take a moment just
[1:11:13] to lay this Foundation can I will you
[1:11:16] give me the Liberty just to relax yes
[1:11:19] cuz I'm not relaxed I'm feeling
[1:11:20] pressured crunched by time so somebody
[1:11:23] say brother Matt relax relax
[1:11:25] thank you God bless you appreciate that
[1:11:28] so I want you to notice because when you
[1:11:30] read this you can see how that Paul is
[1:11:34] trying to express this thought and he's
[1:11:36] trying to he's trying to express but
[1:11:39] what we all can feel how could I be
[1:11:42] truly born of the spirit of God I know
[1:11:45] beyond a shadow of a doubt that I have
[1:11:47] met the Lord Jesus that I have passed
[1:11:50] from Death un life I've I've obeyed all
[1:11:52] of the instructions that Peter gave the
[1:11:54] church repent and be baptized in the
[1:11:57] name of the Lord Jesus Christ but I I
[1:11:59] know brother Matt that I've I've came
[1:12:01] into contact with with my Creator and I
[1:12:04] know that I've surrendered my whole life
[1:12:06] and I I know this that I love the Lord
[1:12:09] Jesus with all that's within me and I
[1:12:12] want only what he wants for my life and
[1:12:16] and I want to shun I don't want to do
[1:12:18] how many feel that way I don't want to
[1:12:19] do what's wrong I have a desire to serve
[1:12:22] the Lord I have a desire to to be like
[1:12:25] the Lord made me but somehow even
[1:12:27] knowing that I've experienced that
[1:12:30] somehow I feel sometimes I can fail the
[1:12:34] Lord in such a deep way I could I could
[1:12:38] make mistakes that just don't make even
[1:12:40] sense to me that how could I knowing
[1:12:43] that I love the Lord knowing that I
[1:12:45] passed from Death unto life yet somehow
[1:12:47] I still have this struggle within me and
[1:12:51] sometimes brother Matt if I'd be honest
[1:12:53] I wonder do I really have the
[1:12:56] goods sometimes I can fail the Lord in
[1:12:59] such a way I'm not speaking of
[1:13:01] habitually in a life of sin but
[1:13:04] sometimes I make mistakes and and I and
[1:13:06] I question how could I be filled with
[1:13:08] the spirit and yet have such a battle
[1:13:13] that rages inside of me how many ever
[1:13:15] felt that
[1:13:16] way how many have ever got to the place
[1:13:18] to where you start to even question do I
[1:13:21] even have the Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost have I ever really been born again
[1:13:26] and and sometimes we the devil he loves
[1:13:29] to shroud things that are simple with
[1:13:31] mystery
[1:13:33] yesen and he loves to complicate and
[1:13:35] over complicate something that really if
[1:13:38] you go back to the Bible which is what
[1:13:41] the message of the hour was to restore
[1:13:43] us back too to Paul's teaching it's not
[1:13:46] complicated it's very simple repent and
[1:13:50] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:13:53] Jesus Christ and you
[1:13:55] might
[1:13:57] maybe I might give it to you maybe if
[1:14:01] you got a good enough track record and I
[1:14:04] watch it for long enough you know no
[1:14:07] it's actually much more simple than that
[1:14:10] you see the problem never exists in the
[1:14:13] Lord Jesus giving it the problem always
[1:14:16] goes back to do we
[1:14:19] repent because repentance is not saying
[1:14:22] sorry repentance is actually an act
[1:14:25] action that you make in your heart many
[1:14:28] people don't like the effects of sin and
[1:14:31] so they repent of the consequence of sin
[1:14:34] they hate the alcoholic hates that it
[1:14:36] ruins his family he hates that he lost
[1:14:39] his job he hates that he has to now
[1:14:41] drive a moped because he lost his
[1:14:43] driver's license he hates that he hates
[1:14:45] the consequence of sin but there's a
[1:14:48] very big difference in hating the
[1:14:50] consequence of sin and hating the sin
[1:14:53] amen when Jesus comes to the man at the
[1:14:55] pool of Bethesda and he gives the sob
[1:14:57] story every time the angel comes to stir
[1:14:59] the waters I have no man to pick me up
[1:15:01] and Jesus just cuts to the Chase and
[1:15:03] says sir will you be made whole I'm not
[1:15:07] asking you does your back hurt I'm not
[1:15:09] asking you sick a laying here I'm not
[1:15:11] asking you because it was sin who put
[1:15:13] him here that's why Jesus says go and
[1:15:14] sin no more right but he says I want to
[1:15:17] know do you thirst for righteousness do
[1:15:20] you hunger for Holiness you see when a
[1:15:23] heart is not just hating the effects of
[1:15:26] sin but you can say Lord I don't want
[1:15:28] sin I hate sin I assum evil I want the
[1:15:32] word of God in my life I want the Lord
[1:15:34] Jesus to be king on my Throne I I Repent
[1:15:37] of all of myself that's true repentance
[1:15:40] and that is a vessel that God can fill
[1:15:42] with the
[1:15:44] spirit but you notice you say I know
[1:15:47] that I've came to that brother Matt but
[1:15:49] still yet how could I if I struggle so
[1:15:52] much what you need to realize is that
[1:15:55] there's more to you than what you see in
[1:15:57] the mirror in fact you're made up of a
[1:16:00] body a soul and a spirit and within that
[1:16:04] body we know from from very young age
[1:16:07] that we have five senses but the prophet
[1:16:09] then tells us in greatest battle ever
[1:16:11] fall and he draws it on the board that
[1:16:13] there's five senses also to the human
[1:16:15] Spirit there's your memory your
[1:16:17] conscience reasoning your imagination
[1:16:20] your affection and all those are part of
[1:16:22] what make up you but really the prophet
[1:16:25] says but the real you is that se Gene
[1:16:29] that Soul down on the inside of God that
[1:16:33] hungers and thirsts for
[1:16:37] righteousness and so the job of the
[1:16:39] devil is to get those and brother bam
[1:16:42] takes this in future home and he draws
[1:16:44] it on the board how many remember this
[1:16:46] and he draws it out on the board how
[1:16:48] many remember this come on young people
[1:16:51] tell me we we read the message don't we
[1:16:54] if you don't I'd encourage you too amen
[1:16:57] and so notice here it's it's drawn out
[1:16:59] on the board and and brother bandam
[1:17:00] draws that snake that that that snake
[1:17:03] inside of the human heart and he says
[1:17:04] notice when you're born in the world
[1:17:07] there's a there's a there's a snake
[1:17:10] nature there there's a there's a a an
[1:17:12] enemy that is in control he's the one
[1:17:15] pulling the levers and pushing the
[1:17:17] buttons and brother bham says when
[1:17:18] you're born in the world you're under
[1:17:21] the Dominion of sin you didn't you
[1:17:23] couldn't choose that you didn't say I
[1:17:25] don't want that you know let me just go
[1:17:27] ahead and and remind you here today
[1:17:29] young people when you were born you
[1:17:31] didn't before you were born get to
[1:17:33] create your own character and say this
[1:17:35] is what I'll look like and this is how
[1:17:37] tall I'll be and this is how how much
[1:17:39] I'll weigh and this will be my eye color
[1:17:41] anybody do y'all get to do that in New
[1:17:44] Zealand nobody nobody got to do that you
[1:17:47] didn't get to you know create your own
[1:17:49] character like they do in video games
[1:17:51] and you know I'll be this big and I'll
[1:17:52] put all my abilities at 99 99 99 some of
[1:17:56] y'all old people are looking at me weird
[1:17:57] but these young people know what I'm
[1:17:58] talking about I I I'll make I'll give
[1:18:01] myself all the abilities and out you
[1:18:03] know none of us got to do that you mean
[1:18:06] you didn't get to choose what complexes
[1:18:08] you would struggle with in your life you
[1:18:11] didn't get to choose the makeup and the
[1:18:13] personality and the nature but actually
[1:18:15] the way that you were formed brother bam
[1:18:17] says the great grab bag of life and you
[1:18:19] just reach in there and grab it and
[1:18:21] whatever you get is how God ordained you
[1:18:22] to be he made your temperance he made
[1:18:25] your mood he made your personality he
[1:18:27] put you in the home that he put you in
[1:18:29] he raised you in the with the kind of
[1:18:31] home you were in the family that you
[1:18:33] would be raised in your temperament the
[1:18:35] things you like the things you don't
[1:18:36] like the things you love and not all of
[1:18:39] us are created the same not one of us
[1:18:42] that's that's my God that's my kind of
[1:18:44] God he's a god of variety he doesn't
[1:18:46] want us all being in the same kind of
[1:18:48] person he has flowers that look
[1:18:50] different trees that look different
[1:18:52] people with different accents different
[1:18:54] come on somebody God didn't make us and
[1:18:57] nor does he want us to all be a match of
[1:18:59] each other he wants us to serve him and
[1:19:02] be who he made us to be and so long as
[1:19:05] you serve God in the way God made you
[1:19:08] then God can bless you and anoint your
[1:19:10] life but so long as you're trying to be
[1:19:12] somebody that you're not God can never
[1:19:14] bless you and so he made you that way
[1:19:17] you were born in a certain with a
[1:19:19] certain bent brother Brandon would deal
[1:19:20] with this we're going to deal with it
[1:19:21] here in a moment but when you're born
[1:19:23] you're born under sin's Dominion now
[1:19:26] this is not on tape so you can take it
[1:19:28] or leave it I mean that it's just what I
[1:19:31] personally I accept it uh because it it
[1:19:34] just fits with the rest of the teaching
[1:19:35] of the message but brother bham is
[1:19:37] telling I think it's brother Sydney
[1:19:38] Jackson testifies of this and he says
[1:19:41] that brother Brandon and and and and he
[1:19:44] gives this example and you you've ever
[1:19:46] seen I don't have it here but you ever
[1:19:47] seen that picture of brother Bram and
[1:19:50] he's behind the pull pit there and
[1:19:51] there's that orange uh fire that's uh
[1:19:54] mov moving behind him how many remember
[1:19:56] that picture and you could you can see
[1:19:58] that Indian face and that Chief and that
[1:20:01] signant and those feathers that are
[1:20:03] coming down and and brother Sydney I
[1:20:05] believe it's brother Sydney could stand
[1:20:06] correction but he's with brother bham
[1:20:08] and brother Bam's explaining that photo
[1:20:10] and he says you see brother Sydney says
[1:20:12] that Indian chief that he says that
[1:20:14] picture that you see that's my old
[1:20:17] nature and brother bham says you see
[1:20:20] when a man is Born Into the world that
[1:20:22] nature sits on the throne of his heart
[1:20:25] and you may dress him up you may polish
[1:20:27] him you may try to you know take out all
[1:20:29] the blemishes but truly that's who's
[1:20:31] pulling the but the levers and pushing
[1:20:33] the buttons and he says that old nature
[1:20:36] dominated me and it dominates because
[1:20:39] you're under the Dominion of sin and he
[1:20:42] says that he says I was under the
[1:20:43] control and he says you see brother
[1:20:45] Sydney and he says the reason why that
[1:20:48] that Indian is above me and he points to
[1:20:50] his own nature he says because when a
[1:20:52] man is born again he says the Holy Ghost
[1:20:56] comes in and brother bam he says takes
[1:20:58] his hands like this and he says the holy
[1:21:00] ghost that nature on his heart he says
[1:21:02] the Holy Ghost comes in and the fire of
[1:21:05] the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost pushes that old nature out and the
[1:21:11] dove the Holy Ghost takes the Throne of
[1:21:13] the heart and he says and then from that
[1:21:17] moment on he says the devil is removed
[1:21:20] from the position of dominion and he's
[1:21:23] moved to a position of
[1:21:26] influence and he's not on the throne but
[1:21:29] he'll always tell you that he is he
[1:21:32] can't control actually anything in your
[1:21:35] life he's completely sealed out but
[1:21:37] he'll get you to believe that you're not
[1:21:39] born again you never knew the Lord
[1:21:41] you'll never make it you'll never be
[1:21:43] enough yet he's just a bluff on the
[1:21:45] outside trying to deceive you of who you
[1:21:47] really are but the prophet of God says
[1:21:50] when you're born of the spirit of God
[1:21:52] that Dove sits on the throne and he's
[1:21:55] the one pushing the buttons Hallelujah
[1:21:57] and he's the one pulling the levers and
[1:22:00] now you've got to choose to come into
[1:22:02] the influence of your maker your new
[1:22:05] nature and resist the devil and he will
[1:22:08] flee from
[1:22:10] you and so the battle many times is not
[1:22:13] whether a person's been born of the
[1:22:14] spirit of God not saying that's not a
[1:22:16] battle you see it's the devil's job to
[1:22:18] take those who have never truly been
[1:22:19] born again and deceive them into
[1:22:21] thinking that they're okay because of
[1:22:22] their last name because of how long
[1:22:24] they've been in church because of they
[1:22:26] mentally agreed with the message or
[1:22:28] mentally agreed with the doctrine and
[1:22:29] you're and he rocks people to sleep with
[1:22:31] that and then you know all you got to do
[1:22:33] is just believe he his job is to take
[1:22:35] those people make them think as the
[1:22:37] brother Adam said the disappointment is
[1:22:38] at judgment brother Adam says the
[1:22:40] disappointment of judgment will not be
[1:22:42] the you know he says it he says it will
[1:22:44] not be the drunkard and the alcohol and
[1:22:46] the the drug addict he said the
[1:22:48] disappointment at judgment will be those
[1:22:50] who thought they were all right and they
[1:22:52] really weren't yeah right but then
[1:22:55] brother brandham says in another place
[1:22:56] he says but I believe on that day you'll
[1:22:58] see people who you thought would have
[1:23:00] never made it and they'll be there on
[1:23:02] that
[1:23:05] day and so notice this here because
[1:23:08] because let me just come back to my
[1:23:11] notes here because the struggle is
[1:23:13] really you're made up of Body Soul and
[1:23:16] Spirit and inside of you is a desire a
[1:23:20] the real you you say brother Matt who is
[1:23:22] the real me that seed Gene life life of
[1:23:25] God that that's who you were before the
[1:23:28] foundation of the
[1:23:30] world and so brother bandam says you
[1:23:32] bypassed that you bypass that that that
[1:23:36] that life and he says but you came into
[1:23:38] this world not like Jesus but you came
[1:23:39] into this world to be tested and tried
[1:23:41] your character molded and that's why the
[1:23:44] prophet of God says when you heard the
[1:23:46] word and you recognized that as Eagle
[1:23:49] food like the mother Eagle crying out
[1:23:51] and that that Chi that eagle that
[1:23:53] thought it was a chicken heard the voice
[1:23:54] of its of its mother brother brandom
[1:23:56] says when you recognize this message as
[1:23:58] Eagle food you heard from your
[1:24:05] theophany
[1:24:07] hallu praise God and so the struggle in
[1:24:11] people most of the time is that we think
[1:24:14] that somehow that when we're born again
[1:24:17] and we're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:19] then that's it there's no more battle
[1:24:21] that's all God wanted to do he just
[1:24:23] wanted to fill me with this Spirit but
[1:24:25] what I want to tell you today is that's
[1:24:28] just the start of your
[1:24:30] journey you see the Holy Ghost is not
[1:24:33] content when he takes the throne just to
[1:24:35] sit on the throne but he now wants to
[1:24:37] take Dominion of your entire vessel your
[1:24:40] memory your conscience your reasoning
[1:24:42] your imagination your affection he wants
[1:24:44] to change your personality if there's
[1:24:47] any part of you that doesn't match him
[1:24:50] his job is to hone you and and and and
[1:24:53] brother bam says that this way to shave
[1:24:55] you down you see my brother my sister
[1:24:57] can I just say to you and this is going
[1:24:59] to sound like a paradox but I believe
[1:25:01] with all of my heart what the Bible
[1:25:04] teaches that the Holy Ghost the true
[1:25:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost changes
[1:25:09] everything whoever is in Christ is
[1:25:13] a that's weak come on New Zealand you
[1:25:15] can do
[1:25:16] better is a new creation some things are
[1:25:21] passed
[1:25:23] away no no that's not what your Bible
[1:25:26] says all things are passed away behold
[1:25:30] all things are become new so the true
[1:25:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:25:35] talking about a Reformation I'm talking
[1:25:37] about a transformation it changes all of
[1:25:40] you it's a total change to your heart
[1:25:43] I'm preaching to you on being changed so
[1:25:45] can I say when the Holy Ghost by the
[1:25:46] baptism of the Holy Spirit comes in a
[1:25:49] person's soul it changes
[1:25:53] everything but hold on let me give you
[1:25:55] the Paradox it doesn't change
[1:26:01] everything let's all stand let's close
[1:26:04] we'll leave it
[1:26:06] there so the Holy Ghost brother Matt
[1:26:08] changes everything but it doesn't change
[1:26:13] everything you say how can you say that
[1:26:15] brother Matt you see I believe with all
[1:26:18] of my heart I've been born of the spirit
[1:26:19] of God but this morning when I woke up I
[1:26:22] had a headache I thought the holy GH has
[1:26:24] changed
[1:26:25] everything you know just a few weeks ago
[1:26:28] I I I got a little upset when I was
[1:26:29] driving in my car and someone cut me off
[1:26:32] I thought I got the Holy Ghost you see
[1:26:34] the Holy Ghost changes everything as far
[1:26:37] as the real you you've been translated
[1:26:39] into the kingdom translated out of the
[1:26:41] kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
[1:26:43] God's Dear Son yet there's a part of you
[1:26:45] that's still here and there's a part of
[1:26:48] you that has been changed there's a part
[1:26:50] of you that is being changed
[1:26:55] and when you recognize that the devil's
[1:26:57] lies are exposed in your life and let me
[1:27:01] just stop and say out of necessity you
[1:27:04] must be being
[1:27:07] changed you cannot stop you cannot pause
[1:27:11] you cannot say I've made it it's already
[1:27:13] over out of necessity the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:16] just want to stop and make sure you
[1:27:18] catch this the holy ghost's activity in
[1:27:21] the born again is to change every part
[1:27:25] of them in fact one day he will change
[1:27:30] your
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:35] body so you say brother Matt what does
[1:27:37] he want to change he wants to go into
[1:27:39] every Avenue every complex every fear
[1:27:45] every temperament about you that's
[1:27:47] unlike him in fact he wants the human
[1:27:50] nature of Jesus Christ to place your
[1:27:57] nature and I want that I don't know
[1:27:59] about you I just say Lord I want that in
[1:28:02] my
[1:28:03] life I I I believe with all of my heart
[1:28:06] in Miracles I believe that I want to see
[1:28:09] more you say brother M have you I've
[1:28:10] seen cancer healed I've seen blind eyes
[1:28:13] open I've seen deaf ears even in my own
[1:28:15] life was was lost my hearing completely
[1:28:17] when 100% deaf in my right ear told was
[1:28:20] told by doctors you would never hear
[1:28:22] again it's impossible no statistic for
[1:28:24] for recovery and God gave me back Mo a
[1:28:26] lot quite a bit of my hearing
[1:28:28] statistically it's impossible I've
[1:28:30] watched I've watched cancer brain cancer
[1:28:32] healed I've watched it over and over you
[1:28:34] say brother Matt do you believe in
[1:28:35] miracles I believe with all of my heart
[1:28:37] we serve a supernatural God who can heal
[1:28:40] the body the mind the soul the spirit
[1:28:42] the emotions the complexes God Is A
[1:28:45] Healer of all channels but can I just
[1:28:48] stop here for a moment and say to you
[1:28:49] that the greatest miracle that I'm
[1:28:51] looking for is not necessarily a
[1:28:53] physical IAL outward fleshly though I
[1:28:56] love that though I believe there's more
[1:28:57] of that but the greatest Miracle will be
[1:29:00] me God taking my nature that is carnal
[1:29:03] and has attitudes the wrong Spirits the
[1:29:05] wrong temperament sometimes and the
[1:29:07] greatest miracle that I say oh God if
[1:29:09] you could accomplish this one purpose
[1:29:11] let the nature of My Sacrifice come back
[1:29:15] on my human nature Lord
[1:29:19] beauti you love
[1:29:21] him notice how brother Brandon deals
[1:29:23] with with this and and just go on a
[1:29:25] little bit further he says in me is two
[1:29:27] persons one wants me to do right the
[1:29:30] other wants me to do he's going to say
[1:29:31] wrong and brother brandham goes on just
[1:29:34] go to the next slide we are carnal and
[1:29:37] that part must perish but then inside I
[1:29:40] love this inside and that's Fai he says
[1:29:43] in and that's faith in God's word then
[1:29:46] we bring our outside somebody say
[1:29:50] outside we bring our outside body under
[1:29:54] subjection to the word by Faith by
[1:29:58] accepting obeying believing and
[1:30:00] accepting and obeying what God Said how
[1:30:04] can I take a Cocker and make a grain of
[1:30:07] wheat out of it it's impossible for me
[1:30:09] to do it the only way go to the next
[1:30:12] Slide the only way it is because the
[1:30:15] inside of that Cocker bur has been
[1:30:17] transmitted from a Cocker wheat a Cocker
[1:30:20] to a germ called wheat life then you
[1:30:24] bury that Cocker and it will produce a
[1:30:27] grain of wheat that's right because
[1:30:29] there's been a life of wheat put in the
[1:30:32] Cocker the next slide and he says and
[1:30:34] the life of the Cocker has been taken
[1:30:37] out notice this but the nature somebody
[1:30:41] say nature but the nature of the Cocker
[1:30:45] is still sticky that's right until and
[1:30:51] he says and it will be until this new
[1:30:57] life has been fully
[1:31:01] developed you see that is such an
[1:31:04] important
[1:31:05] word until this new life has been fully
[1:31:10] developed you see brother Matt what are
[1:31:12] you saying what I'm saying to you is is
[1:31:14] that you are in the process of this new
[1:31:17] life being fully
[1:31:19] developed and don't give up on yourself
[1:31:22] when the development is still in
[1:31:24] complete yes Hallelujah when it comes
[1:31:27] forth then it's no more Cocker but wheat
[1:31:32] but wheat but while it's here on Earth
[1:31:37] how many are still here in this
[1:31:39] Dimension with me good that means you're
[1:31:42] not Angels nobody out there no Angels no
[1:31:44] Halos no wings over oh good you mean
[1:31:47] you're all still here with me we're all
[1:31:49] still in this earth as long as while
[1:31:52] it's on Earth out of the earth a Cocker
[1:31:55] it's still sticky but it's got the
[1:31:57] nature on the inside of it of Wheat and
[1:32:01] as long as go to the next one as long as
[1:32:04] you're in this life how many still here
[1:32:08] you're going to be sticky and have a
[1:32:11] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:32:15] and if it doesn't bother you that's the
[1:32:18] problem it's going to bother you as long
[1:32:21] as you live but the inside of you you're
[1:32:25] bornn again and when you're raised up
[1:32:29] you're in the likeness of Christ and all
[1:32:32] the sin is gone from you that's the
[1:32:34] thing that's the thing you say brother
[1:32:37] Matt when will the battle end when will
[1:32:41] I finally make it when will I can I
[1:32:43] finally say it's over I finally cross
[1:32:46] the line when is the battle and the
[1:32:47] struggle going to end when you turn
[1:32:51] 18 yeah that's right amen
[1:32:54] for the second
[1:32:57] time hallelujah oh give the Lord a hand
[1:33:00] clap of Praise I feel you want to do
[1:33:02] that
[1:33:04] amen when you turn 18 for the second
[1:33:07] time and your nature brother bam says
[1:33:10] then you come forth I love that when
[1:33:13] you're raised up you're in the likeness
[1:33:16] of Christ oh I'm looking forward how
[1:33:18] many's looking forward to that day when
[1:33:20] you can look around and you there's
[1:33:22] nothing in you that's like that old
[1:33:23] carnal nature that old sin nature but
[1:33:26] all of it is
[1:33:28] Christ brother Bron begins to deal with
[1:33:30] this and he says he talking about an
[1:33:32] Indian Chief and you know the story very
[1:33:34] well and he's he's in a prayer line
[1:33:36] brother Billy Paul's taking request and
[1:33:37] he comes and this Chief just keeps
[1:33:39] saying me sick me sick and and they get
[1:33:41] this man through and he comes through
[1:33:43] and God heals him and brother Ron begins
[1:33:45] to refer back to him and he says
[1:33:46] somebody told me one time he he was
[1:33:48] converted and received the Holy Ghost
[1:33:49] you can go to the next one and he says
[1:33:51] and he said how you getting along this
[1:33:52] is what he asked the Indian chief he was
[1:33:54] converted was born again and he says hey
[1:33:57] chief uh how you getting along and he
[1:34:00] said pretty
[1:34:02] good and pretty bad yeah you know if
[1:34:06] you'd be honest that's how you'd answer
[1:34:07] that question too how you doing serve
[1:34:10] the Lord oh praise God but not all the
[1:34:17] time and he said what do you mean pretty
[1:34:19] good and pretty bad he said well since
[1:34:22] me received the Holy Ghost this is the
[1:34:25] next slide he said there's been two dogs
[1:34:28] in me and one of them a black dog one of
[1:34:32] them a white dog and he said they argue
[1:34:35] all the time they growl and fight one
[1:34:39] another and he said the white dog wants
[1:34:42] me to do good and the black dog wants me
[1:34:44] to do bad said next slide well Chief
[1:34:47] which one of them wins the fight I love
[1:34:50] this answer brother Adam says well Chief
[1:34:52] which one of them wins the fight said
[1:34:54] that depends on which one Chief feeds
[1:34:57] the
[1:34:59] most so I think that's a good answer
[1:35:02] there just depends on the Waring of the
[1:35:06] body that's in you it depends on which
[1:35:11] one I know people love to you know to to
[1:35:14] put people out and make it so strict and
[1:35:16] legalistic and if you're born again you
[1:35:18] don't make mistakes if you're truly born
[1:35:20] and sealed by the Holy Ghost you never
[1:35:21] surely could never do that listen
[1:35:23] friends I'm just going to tell you I
[1:35:24] don't care what any preacher says what
[1:35:26] any man says I don't even care what I
[1:35:28] think this is what a Vindicated Prophet
[1:35:30] when he answers Romans 7 this is how he
[1:35:33] answers it amen and questions and
[1:35:35] answers that it all depends on the
[1:35:37] Waring of the body that's in you it
[1:35:40] depends on which one you cater to or the
[1:35:44] he says I he says you cater to the
[1:35:46] carnal nature after the things the word
[1:35:47] or the spiritual nature after the things
[1:35:49] of God that does
[1:35:52] it so no notice because there's still
[1:35:55] something in you called memory
[1:35:57] conscience reasoning imagination
[1:36:00] affection and what we realize when we
[1:36:03] have this the I'm so glad for the light
[1:36:05] of the message of the hour amen because
[1:36:07] it reveals to us that even after we're
[1:36:10] born of the spirit of God even after
[1:36:13] we're sealed with the Holy Ghost the
[1:36:15] Seal of promise and yet even still after
[1:36:19] that there's a part of you that can
[1:36:21] still grieve the whole Holy Ghost yes
[1:36:24] that's right exactly because there's
[1:36:27] memory conscience and inside of there
[1:36:30] what happens to a person is that they
[1:36:33] can ingest things in their human spirit
[1:36:37] that makes them a certain way that's not
[1:36:40] according to how God made them yeah you
[1:36:44] can from a child even a young boy a
[1:36:46] young girl can go through things that
[1:36:49] that that are terrible and and and even
[1:36:51] as a as as I could say this and just
[1:36:54] give you some principles of Life most of
[1:36:56] your adult life is simply a reaction of
[1:36:59] your childhood most of your entire you
[1:37:02] I'm going to be an adult one day and I'm
[1:37:04] going to have my own home I'm going to
[1:37:05] have a you know my own family but know
[1:37:07] this that even though you have a family
[1:37:09] you pack over within that family within
[1:37:13] that marriage oh we're one and I believe
[1:37:15] that with all my heart you you like that
[1:37:17] Unity candle and there's the man and
[1:37:19] there's the woman and there's the Holy
[1:37:20] Ghost and there there's the there's the
[1:37:22] you know the Lord Jesus but when you
[1:37:25] marry those two people together you're
[1:37:27] not just marrying your first name and
[1:37:29] she takes your last name and then you H
[1:37:32] you have your names but actually you're
[1:37:34] unifying all of the baggage all of the
[1:37:38] complexes all of the raising all of the
[1:37:41] issues all of the struggles and if you
[1:37:44] never clean those channels out they have
[1:37:47] the potential to be a ticking time bomb
[1:37:51] in your union and one day
[1:37:55] yeah you say I thought they were born
[1:37:56] again thought they were filled with the
[1:37:57] Holy Ghost they might have been but
[1:37:59] because they never cleaned out the
[1:38:01] channels of memory conscience reason and
[1:38:04] Imagination in fact God Satan can get
[1:38:06] you to such a place by using the way you
[1:38:09] were made see he has no approach to your
[1:38:11] soul he's sealed out so what he will do
[1:38:14] is he can listen friends I realized a
[1:38:16] long time ago that devil cannot change
[1:38:19] my eternal destination it's already been
[1:38:22] set sealed signed and delivered and one
[1:38:25] day my body will receive what my soul
[1:38:27] already got a long time
[1:38:29] ago and so because Satan cannot change
[1:38:32] my eternal destination he will do
[1:38:35] everything he can to roin my life here
[1:38:38] on this side of Eternity and rob me of
[1:38:41] my joy rob me of my smile rob me of my
[1:38:44] happiness rob me of my Hope come on
[1:38:46] preach with me somebody is is this not
[1:38:49] the enemy that you face too here he will
[1:38:51] do everything he can to compl Lex you to
[1:38:54] make you different than the way God made
[1:38:56] you make you angry temperamental toxic
[1:39:00] hateful bitterness malice Envy Strife
[1:39:03] jealousy the devil can't change your
[1:39:05] Eternal home so he'll make your home
[1:39:07] here hell on
[1:39:09] Earth but today we're here to expose
[1:39:16] him and so notice this here because
[1:39:19] within that the person can inest it's
[1:39:21] just like Co you know Corona virus and
[1:39:24] I'm just going to speak for our our
[1:39:26] country because I wasn't here and and
[1:39:28] every country dealt with it a little bit
[1:39:29] different and I'm not here to get on a a
[1:39:31] a p a soap box here about it but I just
[1:39:34] want to point something out because so
[1:39:35] many people you know that was a real
[1:39:38] thing that really affected a lot of
[1:39:39] people's lives there a lot of people
[1:39:41] even people in our assembly who passed
[1:39:43] away from it people even today in our
[1:39:44] assembly who are struggling with the
[1:39:46] effects years after in their lungs and
[1:39:48] respiratory things that was a very real
[1:39:50] so I'm not belittling that at all not
[1:39:52] not not not minimizing in that but you
[1:39:54] need to recognize something that the
[1:39:56] prophet of God told us that all sickness
[1:39:58] and all disease is just an outward
[1:40:00] external manifestation of a life a demon
[1:40:03] which is a life a being that exists and
[1:40:06] it's a spirit that comes upon
[1:40:09] people that's why when Jesus prayed for
[1:40:12] the deaf man in Mark chapter n he didn't
[1:40:14] say disease or name it what science
[1:40:17] named it he says Thou deaf Spirit come
[1:40:20] out of the man and don't enter him again
[1:40:23] it was a life living off the life of
[1:40:25] that person and so if we believe in
[1:40:29] physical sickness that a person can get
[1:40:30] a tumor and that tumor is just the body
[1:40:33] it's not the doctors can do all they can
[1:40:35] but brother bam says but you need to
[1:40:37] identify in demonology that's not tumor
[1:40:40] they give it a name tuberculosis and
[1:40:43] cancer but it's a spirit that's living
[1:40:45] on that person and so if there's
[1:40:48] physical disease how much more is there
[1:40:51] spiritual disease and many times we
[1:40:54] could have churches where everybody
[1:40:55] dress code looks good makeup no makeup
[1:40:58] hair is long boys aren't wearing shorts
[1:41:00] no smoker no cigarettes and everything
[1:41:02] on the outside looks healthy but on the
[1:41:05] inside there's spiritual disease
[1:41:08] everywhere CU we live in that kind of a
[1:41:10] culture to where everybody wants the
[1:41:12] image and as long as I look like a
[1:41:13] Believer then everything's all right but
[1:41:15] do you know God actually says you look
[1:41:18] on the outward but I don't I'll actually
[1:41:20] look at the heart I'm the one who looks
[1:41:22] on the ins side of the person doesn't
[1:41:24] matter Holiness outward Holiness is a
[1:41:26] good thing but it won't get you in the
[1:41:28] Rapture only inward Holiness of the
[1:41:30] heart the true nature will get you in
[1:41:33] the
[1:41:34] Rapture and so sometimes we live with
[1:41:36] spiritual diseases in our own self and
[1:41:39] we're healthy on the outside but on the
[1:41:41] inside we're a
[1:41:43] mess true and so so so that person can
[1:41:46] take a complex in their spirit and and
[1:41:49] let me just come back to close this loop
[1:41:50] on Co many people who never never got
[1:41:53] sick from the
[1:41:54] disease yet they ingested the fear and
[1:41:59] pandemonium in their human spirit and
[1:42:01] today they live with the effects of that
[1:42:06] spirit because it's a very real thing
[1:42:08] and you can be bound not in your soul
[1:42:11] but Satan can bind you with a yoke you
[1:42:14] say brother Matt how can you say that
[1:42:16] those that are born of the spirit of God
[1:42:17] can be bound why does the Apostle Paul
[1:42:20] say be not entangled again with the Yoke
[1:42:24] of bondage wherewith Christ has set you
[1:42:27] free beautiful brother brother Paul says
[1:42:30] in another place you forgotten who you
[1:42:32] were that you were purged you you you
[1:42:34] were you were freed of your sin you were
[1:42:36] you were you were made into the image of
[1:42:39] Christ you did run well what did hinder
[1:42:42] you so there's things we're preaching to
[1:42:44] you today on being changed you love
[1:42:46] him
[1:42:49] amen did you know you say brother Mattis
[1:42:52] if I'm born of the of God if I'm truly
[1:42:55] sealed then how much access does Satan
[1:42:59] have to me I'm going to give you a very
[1:43:01] simple answer as much as you give him
[1:43:05] that's right think about that for a
[1:43:08] moment brother Bon says did you know
[1:43:10] next slide a devil is almost almost not
[1:43:15] completely but he's almost harmless a
[1:43:19] devil demon big scary thing but a devil
[1:43:23] is actually almost harmless unless he
[1:43:26] can have something a medium some portal
[1:43:31] some way some access you say how did I
[1:43:34] give him access through a complex that
[1:43:36] you never took under the the that never
[1:43:38] surrendered that vain imagination to br
[1:43:41] br as Paul says bring every thought
[1:43:43] captive to the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:45] but because people don't bring those
[1:43:46] thoughts captive you know what a complex
[1:43:48] is brother Bram says just think the
[1:43:50] wrong way and then keep thinking that
[1:43:52] way and keep thinking that way and you
[1:43:54] feed that complex and you build that
[1:43:56] complex you're born again you're sealed
[1:43:58] by the Holy Ghost but you're seeing
[1:43:59] everything through yented glasses
[1:44:01] through that complex so he's almost
[1:44:04] powerless unless he has something to
[1:44:06] work and you remember those Devils that
[1:44:07] were cast out of Legion brother ROM says
[1:44:09] what they they wanted to do more
[1:44:11] mischievousness so they wanted to go
[1:44:13] into the hog so Devils must have
[1:44:15] something to work in notice this word
[1:44:19] somebody yeah somebody what we recognize
[1:44:24] is that sometimes Satan will use
[1:44:29] friends or relationships or boys or
[1:44:33] girls or social groups and he will use
[1:44:37] the things that are physical to give
[1:44:39] someone as brother bam says no devil is
[1:44:41] almost devil is almost harmless unless
[1:44:43] you have somebody to work in and he will
[1:44:45] begin to by well a second hand he would
[1:44:49] begin to afflict
[1:44:51] you and and destroy you and if he could
[1:44:54] he'd annihilate
[1:44:56] you let me just go ahead and tell you
[1:44:57] right now the devil doesn't just want to
[1:44:59] hurt you he wants to kill you amen know
[1:45:03] that about your enemy can I just wake
[1:45:04] you up to your enemy today he's not just
[1:45:06] interested in just hurting your
[1:45:08] feelings he wants to annihilate you true
[1:45:12] he wants to completely wipe you out
[1:45:16] amen and and brother ad is almost
[1:45:18] completely harmless and Satan can only
[1:45:20] his power he got the perverted power to
[1:45:21] think Satan has got is something that
[1:45:23] was perverted but it's a power and we
[1:45:25] are today we are today thank you brother
[1:45:27] sitting here one or the other power is
[1:45:29] going to control us one or the other so
[1:45:31] let's cast out the evil one let's take
[1:45:34] our position like the stars of the
[1:45:36] heavens that's our choice as we Pro
[1:45:38] preached on last night inside of the
[1:45:40] body is a soul and that soul is
[1:45:41] controlled by imagination conscious
[1:45:43] memory reason infection inection that's
[1:45:45] the thing that controls the soul so then
[1:45:47] what does that from the middle of the
[1:45:49] heart which is the soul from There Goes
[1:45:51] Forth notice these words feeding every
[1:45:54] channel the trouble of it is we're
[1:45:56] standing here with a lot of Doubt trying
[1:45:58] to accept what's out there you've got to
[1:46:00] stop that come down that Channel with
[1:46:02] the true word of God then it goes out
[1:46:04] itself automatically it's what's on the
[1:46:06] inside that's the thing that counts as
[1:46:08] the inside Satan's approach is from the
[1:46:11] friends God God's prophet's given you
[1:46:14] weapons he's giv you strategy how to
[1:46:16] fight your enemy and there's only one
[1:46:18] Avenue that can come down and that's by
[1:46:20] the way of free moral agency coming of
[1:46:21] the Soul by your
[1:46:23] thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:46:26] so is he if you say to this mountain
[1:46:27] move and don't doubt in your heart
[1:46:29] believe what you've said will come to
[1:46:30] pass you can have what you said you get
[1:46:32] it there you are there's the
[1:46:34] Battleground there's the
[1:46:37] Battleground I'm going to move through
[1:46:39] some of this because I believe you're I
[1:46:41] just want to get to somewhere before we
[1:46:43] just run ourselves out of time I got 15
[1:46:45] minutes left somebody say praise the
[1:46:47] Lord somebody say preach brother
[1:46:51] mat so notice this here brother Adam
[1:46:54] says here in in and just slide 18
[1:46:57] brother if you could display it did you
[1:46:58] ever see a good grain of corn planted in
[1:47:00] the ground did you ever see that and let
[1:47:03] a stick fall over it notice it'll grow
[1:47:08] crooked this is what happens to so many
[1:47:10] people when a complex comes over your
[1:47:14] life right it'll grow crooked any Vine
[1:47:17] anything that grows up well because
[1:47:19] something has hindered it now brother
[1:47:22] Brandon I'm going to take a turn here
[1:47:23] just for a moment with what little bit
[1:47:25] of time that we have left he says if you
[1:47:27] went into a doctor's office this is
[1:47:29] slide 19 and told him you were sick told
[1:47:31] him your symptoms he was and if he was
[1:47:33] in a hurry to probably give you a little
[1:47:34] prescription with some anesthetic some
[1:47:36] sort of aspirin the doctor is merely
[1:47:38] trying to get rid of you just at that
[1:47:40] time because he hasn't have time he
[1:47:42] doesn't have time but a real good doctor
[1:47:45] before he gives you the medicine would
[1:47:48] diagnose the case you see this is what
[1:47:50] we're doing when we just tell people
[1:47:52] just get the Holy Ghost yeah exactly
[1:47:54] right just get get born now I I'm not
[1:47:57] I'm not disparaging that because there's
[1:47:59] a truth in that like with everything I'm
[1:48:02] only saying that when we just think that
[1:48:04] all a person has to do is just get the
[1:48:06] Holy Ghost and now I do believe that the
[1:48:09] work of the Holy Ghost is all you need
[1:48:10] but you've got to let this mind which
[1:48:12] was in Christ Jesus also be in you
[1:48:15] you've got to add to your faith and The
[1:48:17] Virtue and the knowledge and The Temper
[1:48:19] you've got to do these things this is
[1:48:21] the work of the Holy Ghost after you're
[1:48:23] bornn of the spirit of God he is
[1:48:25] changing
[1:48:28] you and many times brother params notice
[1:48:31] how he says this he says many times and
[1:48:33] he says we find people slide the next
[1:48:35] slide 20 going through these prayer
[1:48:37] lines across the nation they just run up
[1:48:39] and think the Lord ought to heal them
[1:48:40] right then but there's something maybe
[1:48:42] down in there we set before the Lord
[1:48:44] until he reveals it that's what it is
[1:48:46] there is something notice I want you to
[1:48:48] remember this young people write this in
[1:48:50] bold in your mind put it in neon there's
[1:48:53] a reason for
[1:48:56] everything there's a reason for
[1:48:59] everything and you've got to find the
[1:49:03] reason first and then you can find what
[1:49:07] to work on now I want to be careful here
[1:49:10] here
[1:49:11] because unless I put you on some rabbit
[1:49:14] chase you know trying to find what's my
[1:49:17] problem what's I got to go to
[1:49:18] psychologist and I got to go to this and
[1:49:20] I got to get this now listen friends
[1:49:22] that's empty can I just tell you that
[1:49:24] it's empty it's empty It ultimately
[1:49:26] leads you to just more one question
[1:49:28] leads to another question there's only
[1:49:31] one Healer and that healer's name is
[1:49:34] Jesus and if you could just find him
[1:49:36] that's all that
[1:49:39] matters and we don't need to come up you
[1:49:41] know we don't you don't need to come and
[1:49:43] and let you know have some gift of
[1:49:45] discernment discern your heart and tell
[1:49:47] you everything's wrong with you you say
[1:49:49] brother the M what do I need all you
[1:49:51] need is for the whole ho ghost by the
[1:49:53] preaching of the word to expose the
[1:49:56] devil and once he's exposed say out of
[1:49:59] me Satan and you have no place in my
[1:50:02] mind you have no place in my spirit all
[1:50:05] he needs is to be exposed that's all
[1:50:07] you're going to find that here in a
[1:50:09] moment questions and answers brother
[1:50:11] Bram says I found someone no excuse me
[1:50:13] on the interview this morning and he
[1:50:14] says I guess there's still the absolute
[1:50:16] he says I guess they're still in the
[1:50:18] building and brother BR is referring to
[1:50:19] this person and he says about speaking
[1:50:22] with tongues
[1:50:23] now brother B if you go and study this
[1:50:26] he spends the whole morning this is
[1:50:27] questions and answers he spends the
[1:50:29] entire previous service the night before
[1:50:31] and he and he's and he's talking how
[1:50:33] preaching how that speaking in tongues
[1:50:35] is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost he
[1:50:37] teaches to entire sermon and then he
[1:50:39] comes to this person you could think
[1:50:41] it's it's what you know it's what is he
[1:50:43] doing here but notice a
[1:50:45] prophet and he says I I I suppose
[1:50:48] they're still in the building and he
[1:50:50] says about speaking with tongues
[1:50:53] that person is a genuine person a real
[1:50:57] person they've lived it right and I and
[1:51:00] they've heard me say the evidence of the
[1:51:03] Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues
[1:51:05] now hold on pause pause that for a
[1:51:07] minute look this way don't Don't cheat
[1:51:08] and read
[1:51:10] ahead this person has a question that so
[1:51:13] many of us can have in our own life she
[1:51:16] was asking have I truly been born
[1:51:21] again anybody ever asked that do I
[1:51:24] really have the Holy Ghost and and and
[1:51:27] and brother brandham the way he's going
[1:51:28] to answer this he takes that woman who's
[1:51:31] questioning that now brother brandom
[1:51:33] identifies and I believe what he's doing
[1:51:35] is identifying she has been born again
[1:51:37] she's truly has the good she's lived a
[1:51:39] right
[1:51:40] life and you say then what's brother
[1:51:42] bram's answer going to be because she's
[1:51:44] asking about I I I believe I've been
[1:51:47] born again but I've never spoken in
[1:51:49] tongues you know how brother bham and
[1:51:51] how you take this or leave it I happen
[1:51:53] to take it cuz I believe all that the
[1:51:55] prophets have spoken and in 1964 this is
[1:51:58] the way brother bandam answers this he
[1:52:00] talks to the woman about speaking in
[1:52:01] tongues and he doesn't say sister how
[1:52:03] carnal how immature are you come on
[1:52:06] aren't we past that just believe you
[1:52:09] accept the message just believe how dare
[1:52:11] you how immature how he never Bel us her
[1:52:14] at
[1:52:14] all in fact brother Bram tells this
[1:52:17] sister go ahead brother and he says
[1:52:19] about speaking a tongue the person is a
[1:52:21] genuine person real person they Liv
[1:52:22] right they've heard me say the evidence
[1:52:23] of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in
[1:52:24] Tong and it isn't but I advise that
[1:52:27] person here's the advice of a prophet to
[1:52:30] ask God to let them either speak in
[1:52:33] tongues or
[1:52:37] prophesy oh don't brother
[1:52:40] Matt you see what brother brandham
[1:52:42] looked at was he knew the
[1:52:45] nature of the person and one may be able
[1:52:50] to accept it by faith but the devil was
[1:52:52] using this to plague her in her mind and
[1:52:55] so brother brandham says I know that the
[1:52:57] nature she is she needs something she
[1:53:00] can put her faith upon right amen and he
[1:53:04] says I asked her told her to ask God to
[1:53:08] let her speak in tongues or prophesy
[1:53:11] because it's the nature the first thing
[1:53:14] I did I went and found their birthplace
[1:53:18] what sign they were born under and could
[1:53:21] tell what their birth was notice which
[1:53:24] way it set them in their natural you see
[1:53:28] my brother my sister we are all
[1:53:30] different none of us are the same so we
[1:53:33] can't make a one siiz spits all for
[1:53:36] everybody what worked for brother
[1:53:38] Brandon when he said I was born again by
[1:53:39] the spirit of God it felt like water was
[1:53:41] pouring down on my back that may not
[1:53:44] that doesn't mean for us to go look for
[1:53:46] that same sensation away with Sensations
[1:53:49] brother brand says experiences it
[1:53:51] doesn't mean to say we don't need an
[1:53:52] experience we don't need sometimes
[1:53:54] someone needs something they can put
[1:53:56] their faith upon and I'm here to tell
[1:53:58] you if that's what you want Jesus is
[1:54:00] willing to give it to
[1:54:02] you but for others can accept it by
[1:54:05] faith and just some cry some don't some
[1:54:08] shout some don't yeah none of us are the
[1:54:12] same yeah but here's one thing that you
[1:54:16] can base your faith upon whatever it is
[1:54:19] it will bring a change a total toal
[1:54:23] transformation to your
[1:54:25] life when brother BR is dealing with
[1:54:27] that man was questioning that plagued
[1:54:30] with that question and he and he he says
[1:54:32] have I have I not and brother brandham
[1:54:34] says he tells he comes to brother
[1:54:35] brandham and is just exhausted oh I've
[1:54:37] been trying to find you he says I've
[1:54:39] struggled with this question in my mind
[1:54:41] do I really have the Holy Ghost and he
[1:54:42] says brother Brandon says tell me your
[1:54:44] let me tell you my story and and you
[1:54:46] know the story very well is a car
[1:54:47] salesman and he says and and he says and
[1:54:50] one day a man came over dropped off a
[1:54:52] track back and it says where will you
[1:54:53] spend eternity and brother BR he says
[1:54:55] brother Bram I I read that and I begin
[1:54:57] to weep and weep and it just plagued me
[1:54:59] God in my mind he says ever since that
[1:55:01] day brother bandam you know the man just
[1:55:04] he begins to pray and talk to the Lord
[1:55:06] and begins and begins uh you know just
[1:55:09] really survey in his own life and he
[1:55:11] begins to seek the holy ghost from that
[1:55:13] moment and he says and he says brother
[1:55:16] Brandon he says from that time he says I
[1:55:18] went to the Nazarene and they told me
[1:55:19] just get happy enough and you'll begin
[1:55:21] to think it was the Nazarene and begin
[1:55:22] to laugh he says so I begin to laugh and
[1:55:24] he says now you got it but I didn't he
[1:55:26] says that question was still plaguing me
[1:55:27] so I went to the assembly the
[1:55:29] fundamental Baptist just recite this
[1:55:31] Creed and you know can say the sinner's
[1:55:33] prayer and it sounded good he says but I
[1:55:35] I still was bothered with this question
[1:55:37] do I have the Holy Ghost so I went to
[1:55:38] the Pentecostals they told me to speak
[1:55:40] in tongues going from group to group to
[1:55:42] group to group Camp to Camp lot of like
[1:55:43] like a lot of people camp to Camp to
[1:55:45] Camp to Camp to
[1:55:46] Camp looking for something that's
[1:55:48] already here
[1:55:50] yeah right and brother says and he says
[1:55:53] and now he says and I don't know what to
[1:55:54] do I'm going to lose my mind he says now
[1:55:56] I come to you I don't know what to do
[1:55:58] I'm still bothered by this question and
[1:56:02] brother bam says sir can I ask you a
[1:56:04] question and he says and he says you
[1:56:07] told me that when you picked up that
[1:56:09] piece of paper and looked at that track
[1:56:12] and the way brother brandom says it
[1:56:13] you'd have to go back to the tape to
[1:56:15] find I'm just paraphrasing and he says
[1:56:16] that your whole life changed from that
[1:56:18] moment he says yes that's right brother
[1:56:20] bandam and he says brother I'm here to
[1:56:22] tell you you received the Holy Ghost
[1:56:24] right there and all of this has been a
[1:56:26] work of the Holy Ghost in your life you
[1:56:29] know what that man did Brother B said he
[1:56:31] jumped and screamed and said do you mean
[1:56:33] I've had it this whole
[1:56:37] timej Hallelujah so so many times we
[1:56:40] look for something and the evidence of
[1:56:43] something we place on some emotion and
[1:56:45] if we don't do that then we place it on
[1:56:47] as long as we believe or I just believe
[1:56:49] God sent a prophet and friends it's
[1:56:50] neither one of those things you say what
[1:56:53] is the true evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:55] that brother bandam says you might speak
[1:56:57] in tongues you might not here's one
[1:56:59] thing you will do your life will come
[1:57:05] subject to the word of
[1:57:08] God are you
[1:57:10] here is this good you appreciate what
[1:57:13] the Lord has and he says I went to their
[1:57:16] nature certain line with they he says
[1:57:18] they were borned over and he says the
[1:57:20] and let's just go over this I'm just uh
[1:57:23] just look at my time now and he says
[1:57:25] it's been one of the most amazing things
[1:57:27] slide 23 that I have noticed along the
[1:57:29] lines of my Ministry for our lord Jesus
[1:57:31] is the peculiarity of people it is truly
[1:57:34] Brother brandom people are very
[1:57:37] peculiar it's been the most amazing
[1:57:39] thing and the study of human life is one
[1:57:42] of the greatest things that the person
[1:57:43] can study to watch the nature of people
[1:57:48] and the different parts of the Nations
[1:57:51] and worlds to where you go you'll notice
[1:57:56] there's a different there's a different
[1:58:00] attitude that people take towards
[1:58:04] Christ towards his service and towards
[1:58:08] his servants and towards I love that he
[1:58:12] included this
[1:58:15] worship and one of the things that has
[1:58:18] been one he says and one of the things
[1:58:20] that's been that one type of meeting
[1:58:23] will just be wonderful in one part of
[1:58:26] the country where it won't
[1:58:30] work in the other part of the country so
[1:58:33] you mean that we're not all to be the
[1:58:38] same you mean that when we see another
[1:58:41] country and another meeting and they're
[1:58:43] are they're rejoicing in a certain way
[1:58:46] and we criticize that that maybe that is
[1:58:49] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and
[1:58:51] the problem is is not with them but it's
[1:58:56] yeah's up I ain't got no pull pit to
[1:58:58] hide behind y'all can still hit me with
[1:59:00] stuff from down
[1:59:02] here you mean sometimes the critical
[1:59:04] spirits that we have the way that the
[1:59:06] Holy Ghost moves in each one sometimes
[1:59:08] friends I just I'm afraid we become so
[1:59:10] political we're no different than the
[1:59:12] you know you don't have it here but the
[1:59:14] Democrats and the Republicans we're no
[1:59:16] different are we the body of Christ or
[1:59:18] are we
[1:59:20] not listen my absolute is not your
[1:59:23] experience and you my experience better
[1:59:25] not be your absolute because the way God
[1:59:28] made me is maybe not how he made you yes
[1:59:31] amen and the way God natured you is not
[1:59:33] how he natured me and my struggles are
[1:59:36] not your struggles and your struggles
[1:59:38] you should thank God or not brother
[1:59:40] Matt's struggles and the your battles
[1:59:42] that you have to face I could never
[1:59:44] fight your battle cuz God didn't make me
[1:59:46] to fight your battle and I you can never
[1:59:48] fight mine cuz so don't criticize me I
[1:59:51] won't criticize besides you I just got
[1:59:52] one thing to say fight your enemy with
[1:59:55] your slingshot that God gave you and so
[1:59:58] long as you put faith in your promise
[2:00:00] and and the absolute that we have here
[2:00:02] is not a church it's not an example of a
[2:00:04] brother a certain Minister thank God for
[2:00:07] all of them thank God for all types of
[2:00:09] ministry I love them all you know me I'm
[2:00:11] not a I I'm more of a Preacher I love to
[2:00:14] shout and scream it's how God made me I
[2:00:16] love to dance and to shout that's how
[2:00:18] God made me that doesn't mean that's how
[2:00:20] God made you and that's can I just say
[2:00:22] that's okay just be who you are be who
[2:00:26] God Made You And as brother Ram says
[2:00:28] then we'll score the
[2:00:29] touchdown and then we can all go
[2:00:33] home but so long as we're trying one to
[2:00:36] match the other and match the other
[2:00:38] we've got one absolute I love how my
[2:00:40] good uh friend of mine uh said it in his
[2:00:42] sermon he says you know the powerful
[2:00:44] thing about a you know instruments he
[2:00:46] says what would happen if I tried to
[2:00:48] tune the base to the acoustic it may
[2:00:50] sound good at first but then you say now
[2:00:52] that you've tuned the base to the
[2:00:54] acoustic now tune the organ to the base
[2:00:57] and now that you tuned the organ to the
[2:00:58] base now tune the piano to the organ and
[2:01:01] then tune the violin to the you know and
[2:01:03] you just go on you say it's going to be
[2:01:05] it's going to be close but there's going
[2:01:06] to be variations in Pitch variations in
[2:01:10] harmony so you know how to fix that and
[2:01:12] that's the way a lot of people are they
[2:01:13] try to tune their experience to another

[2:02:33] trouble this is the condition of a lot
[2:02:35] of
[2:02:36] people you got a lot of trouble now he's
[2:02:39] not talking he's going to identify a
[2:02:42] physical heart problem but he's talking
[2:02:44] about a spiritual problem you got a lot
[2:02:49] of trouble on your heart
[2:02:53] I wonder if we got that
[2:02:55] today wonder if we've got some who look
[2:02:58] good talk good speak right say the right
[2:03:03] things but if the Holy Spirit was to
[2:03:05] discern us there's a lot of trouble yes
[2:03:09] that's true he says you got a lot of
[2:03:11] trouble and you got heart trouble to
[2:03:14] begin with is that right you could hear
[2:03:16] her 20th century Prophet you could watch
[2:03:19] it and she begins to weep
[2:03:22] and he says you got heart trouble to
[2:03:24] begin
[2:03:26] with there's a whole lot of Blackness
[2:03:29] now he's seeing something that's real
[2:03:33] but maybe she never seen
[2:03:35] it and he says you got a whole lot of
[2:03:39] Blackness I see a black
[2:03:42] sheet keep following
[2:03:45] you like that now this sister had no
[2:03:49] clue she's raising children maybe going
[2:03:53] to church she knows there's trouble but
[2:03:56] she doesn't see that in another
[2:03:57] dimension there's a black sheet that
[2:04:00] follows her to work follows her at home
[2:04:03] follows her to the grocery follows her
[2:04:05] to school follows her to church and
[2:04:09] every time she wants to get
[2:04:11] Victory then that black Sheet's
[2:04:14] following her influences her life and
[2:04:15] it's a lot of trouble and brother Rams
[2:04:18] looks at it that way he says it's
[2:04:19] following you
[2:04:22] oh it's a
[2:04:24] lie somebody told a lie on you now isn't
[2:04:28] it amazing the lie was not true it's a
[2:04:32] lie but somehow she ingested
[2:04:36] that and by ingesting that this sister
[2:04:39] now has a black sheet that's following
[2:04:41] her life that's so good and he says it's
[2:04:44] a lie somebody told a lie on you and
[2:04:48] that was a man professing Divine Healing
[2:04:52] is that right yes sir he said you was a
[2:04:55] witch yes is that true and you got a
[2:04:59] whole stir in your church or something
[2:05:02] another about it isn't that right your
[2:05:05] pastor sick right now has got polio
[2:05:06] isn't that right yes sir sister now this
[2:05:10] is what's so
[2:05:12] powerful he doesn't sit her down take
[2:05:15] hours with her pray some kind of a
[2:05:17] prayer lay his hands upon her shake her
[2:05:21] doesn't do anything that he doesn't open
[2:05:23] up a psychology book he doesn't send her
[2:05:25] for help to a
[2:05:28] doctor he simply exposes the
[2:05:33] devil and I want you young people to
[2:05:36] understand you don't need some super
[2:05:38] fantastic thing all you need is to
[2:05:42] expose the devil and believe the word by
[2:05:47] faith not saying that that that you
[2:05:50] can't have wonderful things I've been
[2:05:51] delivered of things and it was through a
[2:05:53] prayer line because I believe in prayer
[2:05:55] lines I believe that the Bible teaches
[2:05:56] that brother brandham taught that I
[2:05:58] believe in the laying of hands on the
[2:05:59] sick and they shall recover and I've
[2:06:03] watched God use Ministries and people
[2:06:05] can sometimes have faith as brother
[2:06:06] brandham says that Gentile Faith was to
[2:06:08] dis believe the word but brother mam
[2:06:10] says it this way he says God will meet
[2:06:12] you at any level of Faith you have he'll
[2:06:16] condense in aren't you glad for that
[2:06:17] kind of a God if you need hands laid
[2:06:19] upon you that's wonderful that's our
[2:06:21] right no one's here to criticize you for
[2:06:23] that nor is the Lord Jesus sometimes you
[2:06:25] need something physical to change
[2:06:27] something
[2:06:29] spiritual but brother vom says all he
[2:06:31] does here is just in a prayer line he
[2:06:33] exposes the devil and he says sister I
[2:06:36] love this and he says don't pay no
[2:06:40] attention to what them people tell you
[2:06:41] they're lying and the only thing wrong
[2:06:44] with your heart is that nervous
[2:06:46] condition got you worked up go home in
[2:06:48] ple peace and God bless you you're all
[2:06:51] right God bless you you're not a
[2:06:55] witch you can hear that sister as she
[2:06:57] set free from that dark shadow strangely
[2:07:00] brother bam says in the next slide he
[2:07:01] cares do you care I went to a place
[2:07:03] where I made an odd turn instead of
[2:07:05] turning around there I went to make a
[2:07:06] turn the lights flashed on a lovely
[2:07:08] couple two young fine ladies he says two
[2:07:11] young fine young ladies that I had just
[2:07:13] he's talking about two young a minister
[2:07:15] two brothers and two sisters and he says
[2:07:17] and Satan after he's seen that Minister
[2:07:20] one of them in his ministry being said
[2:07:21] he took a life's companion right here at
[2:07:23] this altar they went away happy on their
[2:07:24] honeymoon and the enemy jumped on this
[2:07:26] young man and I'm saying this to express
[2:07:30] what I'm saying does he care somehow
[2:07:32] with faith that wouldn't take no for an
[2:07:34] answer would a faith that would not take
[2:07:36] no they turned and return back knowing
[2:07:38] after they was all the way over way in
[2:07:40] the East here somewhere on their
[2:07:42] honeymoon returned back was sitting
[2:07:43] waiting I walked in find handsome young
[2:07:46] man wife sitting on the outside crying
[2:07:48] her little companion on the other man
[2:07:50] other man uh the other brother come
[2:07:52] running which is a friend of this young
[2:07:53] man saying oh brother brandom such and
[2:07:55] such happened and went there and seen
[2:07:57] this went there and seen this handsome
[2:07:58] young man sitting there just in the peak
[2:08:00] of his life a leader of young men
[2:08:02] sitting there and Satan bound him he
[2:08:05] never noticed but I took my left hand to
[2:08:07] shake with his right hand to see if some
[2:08:09] disease had plagued him but there was no
[2:08:11] sign of vibration coming right out of
[2:08:13] the room from praying and fasting
[2:08:15] waiting upon the Lord I love this the
[2:08:17] anointing of the Holy Spirit was there
[2:08:19] and that's why it led us and then seeing
[2:08:21] this there it is again Shadow this dark
[2:08:25] shadow of Darkness over him I never said
[2:08:30] what I was doing but in less than a
[2:08:32] couple minutes moments
[2:08:34] time it was all
[2:08:36] gone and the coldness of his hand had
[2:08:40] left he was shouting and praising God a
[2:08:44] few
[2:08:45] minutes to
[2:08:47] find himself hallelujah oh I wonder if
[2:08:51] there'd be anybody here at this Youth
[2:08:53] Camp that would say Lord give me just a
[2:08:55] few minutes in your presence to find
[2:08:58] myself to cut through all the voices of
[2:09:01] the lies of the enemy let me come back
[2:09:04] to who you really say that I am yes Lord
[2:09:07] and here they sit in the mo this morning
[2:09:09] sitting in the audience see how Satan
[2:09:11] was trying to upset that young man by
[2:09:15] referring himm of some complex to be
[2:09:19] built back which the Holy Spirit knew I
[2:09:22] seen it by Vision but God cared for that
[2:09:27] man God cared for that young
[2:09:32] boy he goes in another place just at as
[2:09:34] I close here coming a few moments I seen
[2:09:38] lady he says a lady I seen her sitting
[2:09:40] on the aisle with just got her seat some
[2:09:42] way and sat down she said nine years
[2:09:44] brother bandam I I I tried to get a hold
[2:09:46] of you I'm so desperate here late I
[2:09:49] couldn't even get a prayer card to be in
[2:09:51] the line the lady moved back said
[2:09:53] brother Bram just a word with you
[2:09:54] standing there a vision broke over this
[2:09:56] fine looking young woman and see that
[2:10:00] her heart was burdened she was trying to
[2:10:03] make a living a great a great notice a
[2:10:06] great thing happened way
[2:10:09] back remember your adult life is just a
[2:10:12] reaction of your childhood that's right
[2:10:15] something way back in the time of her
[2:10:17] parents that had caused this great thing
[2:10:20] to happen to her and the Lord Jesus
[2:10:24] revealed it and it showed what it was
[2:10:27] and there in a day in a month and 10
[2:10:30] years and five Services no there in a
[2:10:34] moment's time moment's time you don't
[2:10:38] need a long big buildup it can happen
[2:10:41] right
[2:10:42] now in a moment's time took it from the
[2:10:46] woman she went around rejoicing and now
[2:10:49] sitting here in the audience with us REO
[2:10:51] him with tears she's wiping her eyes now
[2:10:53] knowing the truth of the thing was made
[2:10:56] known and that what little poor little
[2:10:59] neurotic woman that was so nervous she
[2:11:01] didn't know what was do to do with
[2:11:02] herself thinking that she was gone and
[2:11:05] there was no Holy Spirit and this is her
[2:11:08] last
[2:11:12] day wonder if that's the LIE the devil
[2:11:15] has told
[2:11:17] you sitting here thinking you're gone
[2:11:21] this is the last
[2:11:23] time wonder if you'd bow your heads with
[2:11:25] me here today as we
[2:11:32] close thinking that she was God and
[2:11:35] there was no Holy
[2:11:37] Spirit and that this is her last
[2:11:41] day thought she had send her day of
[2:11:44] Grace away thought she had failed and
[2:11:46] her failure was Final and it was the
[2:11:49] end she she tried for n
[2:11:53] years and she was about at the end of
[2:11:55] Des
[2:11:57] spair but God cared for that little
[2:12:03] woman who no one else cared
[2:12:06] for oh he does
[2:12:10] care when he was on Earth he cared for
[2:12:14] people so much brother and sister don't
[2:12:18] ever let the devil tell you God doesn't
[2:12:20] care
[2:12:21] he cared so much for people he healed
[2:12:25] their sick he comforted their hearts
[2:12:28] told them about a place he was going to
[2:12:30] go and prepare for them and would come
[2:12:31] again to receive them unto himself he
[2:12:33] cared for them he cared so much and he
[2:12:37] knew he must leave in order to bring
[2:12:39] this great thing to us that he said I'll
[2:12:41] not leave you comfortless but I will
[2:12:44] send the Holy Ghost I will send the Holy
[2:12:46] Spirit and he shall continue my care for
[2:12:49] you until he returns oh there's no one
[2:12:55] cares like
[2:12:58] Jesus listen young lady there's no one
[2:13:01] care for you like the Lord Jesus young
[2:13:04] man there's no one that'll care for you
[2:13:09] like the Lord give him your problems
[2:13:11] today I wonder if you would under the
[2:13:13] preaching of this word even right now
[2:13:16] will just raise a hand and say Lord I
[2:13:18] release
[2:13:20] it I give it I release it right now if
[2:13:24] there's some spirit that I've taken and
[2:13:26] ingested in my human Spirit my memory
[2:13:28] conscience reasoning imagination
[2:13:30] affection and I've allowed it to build a
[2:13:32] stronghold in my life and given access
[2:13:34] to the devil maybe it's turned into a
[2:13:36] critical spirit maybe it's turning into
[2:13:38] jealousy maybe it's turning into malice
[2:13:40] maybe it's turning into lust doesn't
[2:13:42] really matter they're all just demon
[2:13:44] spirits but right now you just say God I
[2:13:47] want to be free I want to be free I want
[2:13:50] to be clean

[2:22:23] amen I wonder if the other musicians can
[2:22:25] also come up this is a fundamental
[2:22:28] fundamentally important uh service and I
[2:22:32] and I trust that each one took a real
[2:22:35] hold of that you know many times and and
[2:22:38] as a pastor I find that the question
[2:22:41] that's that is plaguing people is do I
[2:22:44] have the Holy Ghost and if I do why do I
[2:22:47] still
[2:22:49] struggle and and it is so important the
[2:22:52] things that our brothers share today
[2:22:53] amen that it is that that this flesh is
[2:22:58] is supposed to be subject to the Holy
[2:23:01] Spirit that's in our soul but it's a
[2:23:03] battle and the battle will continue
[2:23:05] until the day we die and when you when
[2:23:07] you in this battle like a brother said
[2:23:09] that's the best sign that the life
[2:23:12] that's in your heart the holy spirit is
[2:23:14] fighting the the weaknesses in this
[2:23:17] flesh so that's why you're in a battle
[2:23:19] and and and our brother said if if that
[2:23:21] battle is not happening then then you
[2:23:24] have reason to con to be concerned
[2:23:25] because then then there's still that
[2:23:27] serpent nature in the heart right but
[2:23:30] thank God for these things thank the
[2:23:32] Lord for this teaching we would highly
[2:23:35] recommend you to go back to Hebrews 7
[2:23:37] and read that again with the things that
[2:23:39] our brother has has shared and and may
[2:23:42] the Lord just give you that that
[2:23:44] something to hold on to this morning
[2:23:46] amen that that there's something that
[2:23:48] has changed
[2:23:50] amen i' just like to encourage you with
[2:23:52] that praise the Lord just a wonderful
[2:23:55] service and let's just continue to
