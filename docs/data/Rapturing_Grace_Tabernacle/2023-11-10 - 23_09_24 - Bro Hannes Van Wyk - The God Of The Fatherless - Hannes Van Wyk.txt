meeting Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God bless you you may take your seats this morning certainly wonderful to be here and this place is is always surprising to me the weather here is uh I don't know how to describe it but yeah you know it's uh it's cold and it's wet and it's on but we thank the Lord that we can come into a place that's warm and a nice atmosphere and we can just relax and say Lord give us Grace and help us this morning so the Bible is clear that you know and my title this morning I would say the god of the fatherless and the name of the Lord is a tower and the righteous run into it and they are safe because God comes and when every time when God comes to us he he comes into an expression when God comes and he starts to deal with these people and he talks to them you know he's got a very peculiar way to do things because he is God and he understands us he has created us and he knows what is our deepest needs sometimes we don't know our own needs you know you might think I have a need of this this year but in fact when God starts to deal with you you realize I've got the total wrong perspective the wrong conception of what I really did need because God knows better and when he gave me then at the end of the day I turn back and I say Lord thank you for not giving me what I thought I needed but you gave me what you knew I needed from the before the foundation of the world now you know let's go to Genesis 21 from verse 1 and here is a family of God Abram and Sarah and they are they are dwelling and they are doing the things of the Lord and you know God has blessed them and called them and many different things happen but at some point in time in their family life you know trouble sets in no family is excluded from trouble no family can say we never have any trouble because that's the path of life God allow things to happen to us for a very very specific reason there is nothing that happens to you that God has not engineered or allowed or some way then there must come some good out of it because you know if your life was just stagnant nothing happening you know it's so perfect in every way you know you're like in a glass house the temperature is perfect the conditions are always perfect you know you become a hot house plant and the moment that the door opens and the cold breeze coming you're gone but God is not in the business to create hot house plants he's in the business to create character people after his own character that can face any storm any trial any situation not by their own ability but being exposed and being grown over time gently you know allowing small things here and small things here because you know we grow when you came into the message when God saved your heart your soul and you become a child of the Living God you know you can remember how God and then starts to deal with you somebody will come and and somebody will say something against you and you will cry you you you will cry the whole week because somebody has said something against you but after some time when you when you've grown in maturity has taken hold of you then somebody says something about you you know your attitude changes you don't go home and cry anymore you actually have a different approach to life now because God has now taught you that everything around you there's a purpose there's a reason and there's a season behind everything so now your approach changes from being a child you become mature in the word and now you look at that and you say Lord thank you for allowing things to happen in my life because now I can take that as an opportunity and I can grow and I can become more mature that's what God wants from every one of us to look at life in that perspective to say you know what this is not a problem this is an opportunity this is not a something that is going to push me down this is an opportunity for me to see who I really am and to grow even further every step of this way because we will never stop growing until the Rapture comes doesn't matter how long you've served the Lord you're still growing because you you need Perfection and that Perfection comes over time and he says the day the bride know who she is he's go home because that Perfection has taken a hold of her that nothing can hold her back but as long as you're here I've been in the serving the lord for 30 years and I still learn every day of my life the moment you think I know everything that's the day you start to learn again because God then opens another door and you realize Lord I've been foolish no Lord let me start over Lord let me just just just just be humble before you Lord and learn me Lord teach me thy way so father God so that I can find peace and the Lord visited Sarah and she had as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken so when the Lord speaks something he will do it amen when he promised doesn't make time is no factor with the Lord with us we pray and we expected the the the the undertaking immediately but the Lord is not like that with him there's no time there is a season and appointed season where he delivers his promises for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham his son in his old age and at the set time of which God had spoken to him so there's a time there's a season and God delivers exactly on time and Abram called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah bore to him Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old and God had commanded him and Abram was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah said God have made me to love so that all that here will love with me and she said who would have said unto Abram that Sarah should have given children suck for I have borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and Abram made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which he had borne unto Abram mocking now here's a feast Abram is now there his son is being weaned and there's a dedication there's a wonderful wonderful celebration and as these things happen all of a sudden Ishmael start to look at Isaac and he starts to mock him and Sarah sees the very fact that this child is now acting differently mocking him wherefore she said unto Abram cast out this Bond woman and a son for the son of this Bond when moon shall not be a with my son even with Isaac now here is the first problem that steps into the family because now they are celebrating everybody is happy and all of a sudden you know Sarah steps on the scene and said to Abram she must go with the child because Sarah is now discerned has looked at something she saw something here which Abram didn't see amen Abram didn't see it as you see the scripture tells us so what did she see she saw him mocking her son she saw ishmael's attitude and what was he mocking him about the Bible doesn't say it but the next verse explains it explicitly because of the inheritance Ishmael said to Isaac I am the firstborn you're gonna inherit nothing I'll take control you are nothing so that that mocking continue that way and Sarah heard that verse 11 and the thing was very Grievous in Abram's side because of his son Abram didn't just believe it or just accept it Abram was there and the Bible says it became a grievous thing unto him that he his wife now telling him that you know the bonds woman and his son must go Grievous so it isn't something that he said no you know what let me embrace it let me just accept it you know this makes change to me but he says it was Grievous unto him up to the point where he decided I'm not going to do it that's what he did why because now God has to come from heaven and start to address the matter the next verse and God said unto Abram let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy Bond women in all that Sarah have said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall I see it be quote amen so God comes in he confirms he says he doesn't repeat What Sarah Said because many times we we as Believers look at the situation if God can just tell me to himself then I'll do it God has got many ways to speak to you and because we've got a preconceived idea if God doesn't do it this way I cannot believe it then we miss what God is trying to tell us and here God uses his wife to tell him many times we as brothers your wife is Anointed by God she tells you something that if God tells me I'll believe it but we have to learn and understand you know what each one of us has got the Holy Ghost and each one of us has got a role to play and God we are children of the Living God we are all saved by the same Grace and we all carry gifts it's not only brothers that carry gifts this this carries the same gifts the only thing they cannot do they cannot come and stand here and preach and take authority because that's when the fall came that situation changed completely and the man is giving that Authority and the man is then the ruler is the king the priest and he does all those wonderful wonderful things that God has given us to do but be happy beyond that we all carry wonderful anointed gifts sometimes your wife can do better with finances than you brother you are very quiet but don't worry we'll push through I can preach without amen so what should we do you know we we look at these things and we underestimate because if God then tells me if yeah yes honey I hear you but if God can just confirm it you must be so sensitive so full of the Holy Spirit to realize that we are a team we are both saved by the grace of God and he if there's a gift let's harness the gift let's use the gift let's let's stand together because God has put us has placed us together the church together the bride together if I look at the Lord Jesus Christ and I stand here this morning and you ask me how do I see God if I ask you how do you see God do you see God with a big stick do you see somebody that's going to punish me do you see somebody that's going to send me to hell if I don't serve him or how do you experience this this Lord this this God that has saved us and that's where the problem lies many people has been taught the wrong way to perceive this God and to look at him in a real way when I look at God I only I only experience one thing love he has never not loved me I have never one day in the last 30 years not felt loved not one day he has loved me unconditionally he has loved me so much that I stand and I say Lord I don't even deserve it I don't know why but Lord you love me because God has an appointed time he said time and a season for every one of you and we try and push the agenda we try and push the times and dates and seasons and this you cannot push a time and date with God he will not come earlier when I came into the message 30 years back I thought thank you Lord for weight from waiting for me let the Rapture go I said to sister who's a man we just made it I can feel the door slamming behind us because we were taught from the day we came in the Rapture is upon us which is true we were expecting the Rapture that very next week because I was convinced God just waited for me but 30 years later many came after me so God is still waiting for somebody to come and we should be gracious and patient to say Lord let the last one come Lord if I should if it should be another 100 years so be it but it can be today or tomorrow you should live as if it's today or tomorrow you should plant your potatoes as if he's coming now today but still keep on planting your potatoes and that's where the vision of a true Christian comes real in our lives when we become real where you realize I need to live a life and I need to be dedicated and I need to make a difference wherever God has placed me let me make a difference there because that's the principle now remember God has got a time and a season when we were growing up my father was a man of very intellectual man so he started to search the Bible he started to look at things and he was hunting the truth and he looked for the truth and we were children in the house uh four three two brothers and one sister were four siblings and we walk with them and we went to the church with them because we were young children and he went to every church he could find everyone and he hunted and he was sincere he was so sincere and he was looking at it and he ended up one day we ended up walking into a message Church we sat there in the pews the pastor preached we saw the pictures and the things and you know the books and the ego and all the things and we walked out he took some books home started to read it and his conclusion at the end of the week was this is not the truth files it finish and we carry on and we end up at home he says there's no truth out there now we stay at home and we were six seven years old and many years later 22 23 years old guess what the same God comes back again and he brings us all four children back into the word again and he saves our lives and he the time and season for him to be there he never accepted the message but they were four little children inside there with feet inside of them but the time and season was not right there and we forgot about it we didn't even knew but later on we've got the whole story and then you realize when the seat of God inside of you you can never go lost God cannot lose you he will find you at the right time and the right spot he will Quicken that seat and it comes to life and then it's forever it's permanent nobody can take you out of it because nobody placed you into it too many people in the message are spoken into it convinced that it's the truth you need a revelation that this is a Godly truth and nobody will take you from it you will never leave it nor forsake it because it's a revelation now in verse 13. and also the son of the bones woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed so before in Isaac that she shall be called and I will make him god-giving Abram the reason why he must put him out that is your seat I'll bless him because of that fact that he's a natural seed he's not that spiritual promise seed and Abram rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto heger putting it on her shoulder and the child sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba and the water was spent in the border and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child amen I don't want to see that let me not see the death of the child because and and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept and God heard the voice of the lad and the angel of God called to Hagar Out of Heaven and said unto her what ail of the heger fear not for God I've heard the voice of the lad where he is now the power of a natural seed yes yes Abram there's a natural seed he's in trouble he's busy dying and God hears the Cry of the lad because there's a natural seed of Abram God is interested now what how much more the spiritual seat the Royal Sea those that are born in Jesus Christ God is so interested in your life that it doesn't matter what happens he is fully aware every moment every second of your life he is fully aware and it speaks to him daily His Eyes Are Fixed upon you he says arrived lifts up the lad and hold him in thine hand for I will make him a great nation and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water now where was the world the world was forever there God understand I created the will God didn't say that he says and God opened her eyes and she saw the well that's why the Bible says with every trial and every Temptation God Supply a way of Escape everyone believes the problem is that we don't see it because we don't pray the right way to say Lord I'm in this situation Lord there is a way of escape a right way out of it open my eyes that I might find it Lord that I might see the right way father because your word can never lie your word can never never fail Lord let me find that way and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with the water and gave the lead drink so we as humans has got a problem in in that sense that when you see the outcome of the Lord you want the Lord also to bring the outcome to to supply to to take you the Bible didn't say and the angel went and filled the bottle and the angel went and took it and gave it to the lad and the angel did this and this God showed her the water and he says no go and fill up and take that water and give it to the child God will give you the solution but you must stand up by faith and act upon that conviction and say Lord I'm taking this Step By Faith Lord I'm moving forward Lord help me Lord to be able to act upon what I believe is your will for my life let me live and let me walk and let me be an example Lord and God was with the lad and he grew and dwelled in the Wilders and became an Archer so that is what God wants of us faith now the Lord then carries on in the Bible he starts to to give the Beatitudes where he starts to teach them on the mount and give a lot of things that people must do all the beautiful Expressions how we should live and everything and I believe I'm a firm believer of a Godly life amen I'm a firm believer that God didn't save you that your life can stay the same I'm a firm believer that when God comes in he changes you he quickens you he lifts you and he changes who you are where you come from and where you're going because remember you've you maybe at some point had plans for your own life big plans I remember myself I had big plans not small ones impressive plants I had really I was on a drive on a motive and I had plans I had my old future mapped out and I was going and I was achieving and I was moving and I was growing and I was I was just so so so so absorbed with it and then God came my way and he disrupted the plan he changed it completely it changed my direction he changed my thinking he changed my focus everything just just completely that I would never in my own mind I would never it was never never part of me to ever think I'll be a pastor I can still remember vividly I was with my friends and we were up to mischief and we were walking down the street looking what we can break you know young boys and all of a sudden a voice said to me one day you're going to work for me I didn't I wasn't even a believer I mean I was I was well it wasn't on my mind I was looking when I can break and God says one day you're going to work for me I just left it I never spoke about it I just left it I said my goodness what's that and I left it but today I look back and I knew God had a plan for my life from the day I was born and that time there comes a place and he starts to put it in position and today I say thank you Lord for your plan my plan was a total disaster my plan was making me an evil person with self-motive self objectives everything but God takes that out of you now you don't live for yourself anymore you live for him you live for your brothers your sisters it's a natural life that starts to come out that's what God wants from every one of us to have a life that we look a life of service and God starts to tell them in Matthew chapter 6 verse 5 and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrite are you with me as the hypocrite how does a hypocrite pray hypocrite also prays for they love to pray standing in a synagogue and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have the reward but when thou prayers enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which live in secret shall reward thee openly but when you pray use not vain repetitions God's not impressed by your word the the amount of words you use in your prayer no you can pray for one hour and God's not impressed is not the length of the prayer [Music] repetition of words that's got nothing to do with it some of the most powerful prayers in the Bible even a prophet is short directed anointed you know when you move into that zone you go and you go and you're anointed and and you start to speak to God it becomes a different thing but when you just Reign repetitions God doesn't want you to imagine you coming to your father you know he's the god of the fatherless you come to your father you start to speak vain repetitions your father will maybe do something to you [Music] you know when we grew up I knew what my father would do to me but I know today is wrong so let me not go there but you know you tell me boy get get behind yourself what's wrong with you oh you're right must I take you to the doctor you keep on repeating yourself what's your problem you know you haven't you ever you have a relationship with your natural father and if you don't have a natural father your heavenly father you should have a relationship with him because he wants to be that that one it's so natural action that you should look at it you know what when I speak to him I speak from my heart I don't have to do all this kind of things and find repetitions to impress him he just hears me and he understands me and I can speak to him with confidence and and just just open my heart and express how I feel that's what I want do not use vain repetitions as the heathens do for they think as they shall be heard for their much-speaking now remember Elijah when he was there and he says let us decide today who's God the one who calls fire from heaven The God Who answers your fire that's the God we're going to serve and everybody agreed they say yes let's join let's do it and uh let's let's start to worship and he gave them the first opportunity and they start in the morning the Bible says and they they started with their chantings first and you know as they go through their rituals calling on them the gods and telling their gods and doing all the things that they do and and nothing happens and midday Elijah says maybe your God is asleep I think you must put up the volume the the level of the the volume of the speakers has got nothing to do if God hears you or not you speak from the heart you know you can whisper you can't even have to come from your mouth but when you speak like that God hears you and they start to cut themselves and jump up and down and go really crazy and nothing happens and when it is time he takes he takes all the water pourses on the sacrifice on the altar it's so wet and what does he say father just do what you've already showed me no chanting no no repeating of words no impressing the people the problem is we want to impress one another you are not here to impress one another you are here to worship God you are here to tell him you love him you are here just to be natural and Lord I Thank you Lord for a gracious time in your presence be therefore not like them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask them now there comes the problem some people say so if God knows what I need I'm not going to pray you know people are clever they take quotes and scriptures and the future they say yeah God already knows I'm not even going to pray anymore because my God knows no that's not what he says no your father know what things you have need of before you ask them so why do we pray if God knows all things why do we pray Roman says the spirit help us our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make of intercession for us with groans which cannot be uttered for research if the hearts know if that what is in the mind of the spirit because he make of intercession for the sense according to the will of God When you pray that is as we will read that play prayer let's read it after this manner therefore you pray Matthew 6 9 Our Father this is where God teaches them to pray Our Father which is in heaven we who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread forgive us our depths and as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen it's not a long prayer not at all but it's a powerful prayer he captures everything he starts the you know with the principle the very first verse he starts to say Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name now God when he came to Moses God always are interested that we understand him that we know who he is when he came to Moses in the burning bush and Moses said to him who who must I say has send me says I am who I am I am who I am he wants to give Moses an expression that he is God it's a perfect description of God because in there you cannot limit God if I need healing he is the god I am who I am if I need salvation he is my God if I need Deliverance he is still that God there is nothing that he cannot do it doesn't matter what your situation is God is more than able to help you every time there is no need that God does not specialize in there is nothing that you can say but this is different there is nothing different I am who I am and I can do what I want to do and I can heal everybody I can deliver anybody because that delivering power is still there it's the same God if he has done it for one person he'll do it for you he's not a respecter of person he does not love one more than the other he loves his children all the same there is not one that he can say that one is my favorite no for the bride he loves us all unconditionally the same basis there's nobody that's higher or lower because his father and we are his children he's a real good father he loves them all the same he understands us in our uniqueness and he loves us so he said to Moses I am who I am then he also said to Moses I'll be gracious to him I will be gracious and I will have mercy upon who will I have mercy an expression I'm God almighty and so he continues to explain himself imagine when Moses went up the mountain God started to give him the law and God takes the tablets and he writes the law on it and then God comes to Moses he says you better go down those people of you your people a busy worshiping a golden cup the the evil so God just tell Moses straight go down and sort out your people what was God telling me I'm finished with them and Moses turns around and that's always to me so astounding that Moses said to God no it's not my people it's your people he brought the responsibility back to God and God loved that about Moses and that's why you know it's not my people it's God's people when there's a problem I turn to the Lord and say Lord you've got the best people Lord if my church gives me problems I turn to the Lord and say Lord the best they are yours I'm also one of them because you don't make mistakes you didn't choose the wrong ones you didn't place the wrong ones you know if I were if I had to choose you know I'll choose differently but God chooses the right people he places the right people in the right church so that they can grow in one another and work on one another and sometimes rub one another because you have got nothing if everybody agrees with you but when people start to disagree with you and rub you the wrong way then the true character of a true Son of God comes out because that's the person you should love the most in the church the one that hates you the one that doesn't greet you the one that rubs you the one that one that's the one you should appreciate the most because that's the one God plays there for you is the love of God when you see that brother or sister you should embrace them and say man I thank God for you every day of my life please come to church don't skip a service but we when the person is not here oh goodness today is going to be a good day today is going to be wonderful man I already feel a little bit I know you look at her and say Lord the one you gave me is not here I'm not complete today because Lord there's a purpose like like your boss he loves you and all of a sudden God changes your boss the one that hates you it's the love of God is the love of God for you because he cares for you he loves you the human mind cannot understand that but we're not here to understand with our mind we are here to get the mind of Christ and to say Lord you are in control so this ugly boss you gave me I love him I thank you for him every day when I walk in that's the first one I want to greet and he's going to scold me he's going to put me under pressure but Lord that's where I grow because nobody grows in a comfort zone is that right and God knows that because God's in the business to grow you to mature you to to mold you to help you because he's not in the business to just give you comfort zone he's there to grow you and God wants that for us now imagine he comes to Moses again when Moses comes back the second time up the mountain God now tells him you know what let me explain more he says I I'm a very gracious God I'll forgive thousands their iniquity he's telling Moses now that in me is Grace these people has disappointed me but they're in me there's Grace in me I can I can walk with them and he tells Moses you shall worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous he's a jealous God so can you imagine that somebody calls his own name jealous my name is jealous and I'm a jealous God that's what he says to Moses but it's not our jealous it's not human jealousy we've got a problem to we we redirectly move the translation you know from if God is a jealous God I'm also jealous it's not the same your jealousy is not God's jealousy because that jealousy means zealous I'm a zealous God I I've got a desire I look at you and God is is jealous about two things number one his name and number two you he protect his name it doesn't matter what it cost him and he will protect you he will help you but we have got a jealousy uh envy and things that we look at what what what does it mean when we say you are jealous or envious it means a feeling of displeasure over the blessings others are enjoying sometimes somebody's got a gift maybe a ministering gift a singing gift any gift and you look at that and you think Why Not Me Lord that's Envy yeah it's it's a small Envy but it's Envy Lord I think I deserve also the same kind of gift Lord I've been faithful Lord many that person came in yesterday Lord my and I've been sitting here for 10 years and now Lord look at that that the fruits the blessings that person is yielding Lord why not me that's a that's the start of envy that sister well our approach should always be Lord if anybody gets a gift if anybody is blessed in a certain way let me rally behind it let me lift up the hands that's become free let me just be a prayer what in me just be let me thank you Lord for anything you do because the whole church is going to benefit from any gift God sent we should always look at it from that perspective it's a blessing Lord if it's not me Lord I can at least appreciate it pray for it support it and do everything I can and be excited over it but many times we sit in our peace and say that should have been me yeah it should have been me so jealousy wants what others have but Envy wants to keep them from having it so where do we find that Joseph when his father gave him that coat of many colors instead of his brothers be getting excited because the blessings would flow from Joseph Joseph in fact was a blessing that God sent to them Joseph was there to preserve their lives if they had the full picture they would have had a different attitude towards that but they would have said Lord let me be careful let me walk carefully here but the Envy ate them up they hated him because of what God has was busy doing it and many times in the message Realms you know churches hate one another they look at this they look at that and they compare and people compare and Believers compare and it becomes a big competition we are not in a competition we are here to do what God wants us to do where he placed us let us just do that little bit that we can do it is so wonderful just to find your place and purpose when you find your place you're in competition with nobody when you find your place as a preacher you're in competition with nobody because nobody can preach like me with my faults of my feelings of my stutterings with all this I find comfort in that because I'm not in competition the prophet was not in competition remember when he walked and he visited oral Roberts's place and those big Avengers that came out from his ministry he visited their big palaces and he saw hundreds of people working there machines typewriters going let us going in and out and it and it had an effect upon him he was a human he walked out there and he felt bad he said Lord what have I done have I failed you why Lord why don't I they come from my Ministry I should have been greater than that and the Lord taking behind the the building then he said to him no no look up and he says what do you see I see Heavens he says your portion is in heaven larger than you can contain then you can imagine our blessings our portions are not here our portion is in heaven we should just be comfortable to say Lord whatever you've got for me I am I'm content soul and David when David was there David being sent as a blessing and they go to the battle he killed Goliath he starts to become a blessing to Saul's Army imagine if you were a Godly King man I'll thank God every day of my life if there's a battle where's David they are these generals there's other source but where's David because you know he's got a powerful impact you know he's anointed of God to do these things but when they come back into the city the women start to sing Saul has killed his thousands but David sees ten thousands but they didn't kill it for so many times we take it personally and we think it's my business it's God's business it's not my church it's God's Church you know it's not my people it's God's people when you have the plan of God it takes a lot of pressure of you if God finished with you he'll take you home and the church will still continue others will be added some will go home and he he knows what he's doing so that envy and jealousy has always been part of it and you even find it in the message ranks but we have to be careful we have to consider ourselves as a Lord let me be sincere let me be focused let me understand what you're busy with but God's jealousy is not our jealousy because God's love is never controlling amen just wanted to sink in a little bit God's love is never controlling God has never controlled me to make a decision he tells me what he wants and he wants me to make that decision because I'm a free moral agent and he invites me he pulls me he he encourages me he's got a way in effect upon me God's love was never insecure for me God's love was never selfish or irrational or all those things that we humans struggle with God's love is so pure so holy so wonderful The Love Is God for me there's enough for you as well the fact that he loves me so much doesn't mean he loves you less he has got so much love to give that the way he loves me he loves you imagine if we can just experience or believe that like Paul said to them I am jealous over you of a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband what is he saying he says it is not about me but with a Godly jealousy Paul never says you are my people he actually rebuked him some say you were from Paul some say we're from Apollo some say we from that he rebuked him and says you are from God and God alone you are God's children and we should always remember it amen because that Zeal that jealousy that zealousness you know people has done many evil things with with that Zeal for God the Romans have killed 68 million Christians for a Zeal of God they thought they were doing goddess service and so you can take many examples you have to be careful and ask yourself is my Zeal for God fleshly or spiritually a fleshly Zeal will do certain things but a spiritual Zeal will do other things and we have to be very careful in the time we live to be able to ask ourselves so the first thing is you have to conquer yourself to be able to be used of God if you don't conquer yourself God can never use you so the only Christian that really qualifies to to move and fight for God is a is a Christian that knows uh that that hates his own sins because Paul says who will deliver me of this wretched body when I want to do good evil is present but Paul had the right attitude he knew in my members he says there's another War fighting with me in my members you know I don't want to do these things but all of a sudden I find myself doing something wrong but I war against it and who will deliver me against this evil man now can you imagine an apostle a prophet speak like that and the prophet many times says my greatest problem is myself and so he refers to himself and that's what we mean to say if you need if you want God to use you conquer yourself understand that you've got your own problems that you battle and what is your real motive to fighting for the will of God what is the motive for your Zeal for God many people has got a wonderful Zeal but the motive is wrong some motives can be can be questioned that's why the prophet says if you want to do anything check your motive and objective what do you want to achieve by this what do you want to do how is it going to bring glory to God if that motive is pure and holy you can carry on because God will bless it amen God will certainly bless it now the prophet says in the message the unconditional Covenant he says the bride is the Covenant people unconditionally so you have got an Covenant which is unconditional God called you out of the world and he gave you the Holy Ghost you know how it felt when he called you when he saved you when he blessed you and he gave you the Holy Ghost the seed of Abram you are tonight with a blessed promise if you are then Abram's seat you have this promise in you you believe God regardless of what take place and I like this part the Holy Ghost makes you believe it anyhow man I'm so thankful for that so what I realized from that is it's not my faith it's not my little faith that sits here my faith comes from here and that's from the Holy Ghost and if I don't believe it he says no Holy Ghost makes you believe it you believe things which humanly you can never believe but all of a sudden from here you believe the word it becomes a different perspective he says because the Holy Ghost make you to believe because they see it inside of you you are hearing from your theophany it's a deep calling unto the deep and then you become an expression of such a wonderful wonderful Grace of the Lord so you come there and you understand your God's Grace has been kind unto me and he helps me to believe it he helps me my father could not believe it but I hear I come out of his loins and I can believe it so it's got nothing to do with the lineage you come from it's got nothing to do with your mother your father he's got nothing to do with your grandfather it's got something to do if he's that seed of God placed in you before the foundation of the world and when that has happened you can never never go lost that's why sometimes we baptize people at 80. I think the oldest person we baptized was plus 80 plus the other day we baptized a blind sister I think she's 75. I mean if you look at that you realize Lord our whole life blind this that and the other and at the end of her life you come in and you place that positionally there she looks at the word she's blind she can't see it but she sees it from here she the Revelation eats her heart and she comes and she gets baptized and she's a Believer and if she dies tomorrow she is secure she's a cure in the Lord Jesus Christ but when the Lord says Hallowed be thy name Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name what does he mean what does he mean when he says Hallowed be thy name because remember when you pray to the Lord as Jesus taught us there it is where you start Our Father what does it mean let your name be Sanctified hallow means sanctification hallow means to bring glory to the Lord hallow means Lord we are thanking you so God when you start that's where you start you should always bring glory to God's name When you pray that's where you'll start you don't say Lord I need this I need this I need this that's that's nothing to do with it When you pray you start to sell tell God how great he is how wonderful he is how you love him what he means for you you tell him how great his name is because not not just from lip service but meaning it from your heart because that's what God wants to hear then as you pray then for one another you know it becomes a different story then then it's no more important but you start to enter into a realm where you start to glorify God because he says before you ask he already knows what what you have in need of so you'll get to that he already knows it but prayer what is the purpose then so let's take an example from numbers 20 from verse 7. and this is for me one of the greatest examples of a man getting derailed a man of God you believe a man of God can get derailed yes of course he's human but God will always bring him back and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying take the rod gather down the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak he unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock so shall thou give the congregation and their Beast drink plain simple clear instruction a child can follow it Moses take the rod take the people go to the Rock take the rod and speak to the Rock and The Rock will give water so it's very plain very simple is that true now verse 9 and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him so Moses starts out well the Lord said take the road he takes the road but the problem comes when he comes in front of the people he he was he was as we would call it Fed Up is that the right word for you guys Fed Up is up to here so the the pot boiled over the camel's back was broken with all those statements so he takes the road he goes out and when he sees the people something happened he snaps amen because of pressure because he's a human he you know he can only take so much and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation Point number two well done together before the Rock and he said unto them that's where the problem comes in so he follows the first two steps very nicely God never said to him speak to the people so the moment where you start to go on your own on your own way that's where God that's where trouble sits him if you can follow God's instructions 100 trouble will not sit in but we follow the first two three four steps and at some point we want to inject our own thoughts own ideas because this is too simple or something happened or you were like Moses you are frustrated or or something like that that's why if you are frustrated and you don't have the right motive don't come and preach to the people if you need to talk and encourage somebody make sure that you feel in yourself you know what I can do it because if you are frustrated and and you don't come with the love of God you're gonna make a mess of it you're going to say things which you regret that's why he says You must control the tongue it's one of the most difficult things to control because the tongue can speak before you know it you know sometimes words just slip out of my mouth I wonder where does that come from I never wanted to say that but my tongue just whoa that's why he says keep your mouth close control it if you don't feel well don't say anything it will it will it will help you tremendously just go home and pray and get a better atmosphere and then come and start to speak that's why you never address the issue when you're angry you never solve a conflict in your house when you're angry and upset as the prophet teaches us first get calm down and relax because you're going to do things say things which you're gonna regret the rest of your life now and he said unto them you know you nibbles Yo God never said that sometimes pastors come to the pulpit and they start to speak like that God never said speak like that yeah now you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock that was never God's instructions it was never God's motive or it was never God's will but Moses now goes on and he does that and Moses lift up his hand and with his Rod he smote The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also so the water that Carl Moses was now completely on his own but because he's a prophet God begs him and that's where people miss the thing in our day when you are called The Prophet that plays a dispensational prophet God will always back you up it does not matter what happened but he will deal with you behind the scenes there's many things God dealt without Prophet which he never speaks about if the pattern of the Bible is true but he stays a prophet and he had desires he did things wonderfully did things wrong and God helped him and God guided him and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believe me not and that's why I want to dwell to sanctify me to hallow my name in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them so when God when you go in your own tantrum you are not hallowing honoring God's name to God is you are not believing him that's why don't try and get better plans than God many times we want to help God you know get a better way get an easier way no God's ways is perfect what you need to do is find rest in God's ways to say Lord let me rest in your way father God I'm not going to add to it or take away but let your world be done in all matters so God says because you believe me not the prophet says in greater than Solomon when God put a curse on somebody and I come around with a gift and took it off do you know I can get it will get you in trouble do you know you can get in trouble with gifts so he says God places something on somebody and you come and you remove it he says you're in trouble because God knows what he's doing he says look at Moses Moses was a prophet God trusted him he go down there and speak to that rock don't Smite it speak to it and Moses went down there and got angry and smote The Rock he brought the water whether it was the will of God or not is right right and he broke the scriptures one place in the scripture I found it broke he said there was no pattern for Jesus to be smitten twice so Moses broke every pattern but he stayed God's prophet and God begged him and God helped him and he paid the price for this so we need to understand that we need to sanctify hallow his name when we pray so when we say our father was remember I want you to notice that whole prayer there is no I or me the whole prayer that Jesus taught them there is nothing about me I nothing not one word and he says Our Father which means it is a group Our Father which is the father of the church Our Father Our Father it co includes everything you are not you are admitting that you don't pray alone that you belong to a family of God so the Lord's Prayer is not a private prayer I and me is nowhere to be found so when we say our prayer Our Father we admit that we are in community and fellowship of the Believers That We Are Family that we can pray together and stand together you are confessing that your problems is not your own but all our problems are combined we should look at one another's problems say our father so when we pray we should say our father help our problems because you don't have to look at yourself you have to pray for somebody else God wants you to look not selfishly but once you start to live a life that you live for other people then your own problems your own needs is not so high on the list anymore but your brother and sister's problem has escalated to a level that you can look at it and say Lord help me help me father to be an intercessor to pray for them to be able to stand there before them Lord and bless them our father we are saying a statement because we are making him family he is our father is an authoritative figure because and we don't need an appointment to address him my children never needs an appointment to see me they can just come and they can talk to me and that's the same you know we've got direct access you've got direct access to your father so when you pray you close your eyes and you start to pray you've got direct access you've got a direct appointment and it's days calendar is clear it doesn't say to you no come back next week Tuesday there's 50 in front of you imagine if that was the case but direct anytime any minute any time of the day it doesn't matter when you close your algebra and you say Our Father Who Art in Heaven There is an immediate appointment a direct actors and you speak to your father directly and he hears every word that you whisper it is so wonderful to understand that we have family rights there's strangers in this family when we're at table at our house the family they don't ask where can I sit or what must I do the families got family I walk up to the table they take a place they dish up they sit down they they they they don't ask and I dish can I do this visitors come and say where must I sit what can I do you know they're asking for leading and so they don't have family rights but as a family when you come in you've got certain rights and that's why we call him father and that gives us certain rights that when we come to him we come with that childish expression to say Lord I believe you to be my father I trust you explicitly and when I ask you something you're gonna help me I've got full confidence in you Lord that you can never fail me family rights you don't need an appointment so we speak about our father of our community our our Believers our family of the authority he cares for us so the word father means God is the source of all you have because you cannot be here without a father none of you came out of the air drop from moon or somewhere you came here because you had a mother and a father and so if you say our father it means he's the source of my life is the source of everything I am without him I'm nothing without him I cannot be anything but with him all things become possible amen I cannot do anything without him but with him all things are possible because I have an understanding like when when Paul came to them the people that were worshiping the Unseen God Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said you men of Athens I perceived that in all things you are too superstitious many times people become superstitious if there's no Pillar of Fire behind the pulpit you know we didn't have a good service there was no this or that it's not good enough if I take a photo now and there's a light behind me you know everybody will be happy superstitious he says you become too superstitious for as I pass by and be out your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship him I declare unto you that's what we want you know I want to know this God in the power of his resurrection I want to know him so intimately so personally that I understand him and he understands me you know sometimes you get disappointed from the day God Saves you the disappointments come here a little there little there but God has never disappointed me God has never failed me God cannot do that father speaks of authority he he's the father we are the children and the child cannot dictate to the father how things should be done so we should believe even trust him explicitly for our lives and father means that he's a God for tender love and care so he's a god a father that will never let his children go never he loves his children with an everlasting love that is faithful and loyal no matter what happens when we turn our back on him he still loved us many people has turned back on him but he brings them back when we were far away he loved us when we turned our back on him he still loved us when we broke his law he still loved us because remember every one of us broke the law every day of Our Lives the law can never save you the law puts you in prison there is nobody in this building including me that can keep the law we fail daily and let me shock you even as you sit in church you extend because since the service started how many thoughts in the devil place thinking about work maybe quickly or you know this or that you know you drift quickly in and out so you're in church but then you are in Auckland and then you're back here again or whatever happens but you can move in and out of the church building without you know even knowing the devil can be so quickly he can do me all these kinds of things so what am I saying I'm saying is that we live by grace if the Devil comes and he starts to pull you into another atmosphere bring yourself back to say no how do you do it just tell yourself what's happened now be conscious be conscious say no something happened now I drifted why did I drift let me come back and focus because Jesus says look upon me and live so the deeper you focus upon the word and what you receive the more he pulls you into it because remember he says we are sitting this morning in Heavenly places some people are still interested in what is this place called Stratford some are still in Stratford some are halfway up Jacob's leather and some are right in heaven already feeding and voicing and reading and some are still here in Stratford but God says when you come together you've got an opportunity every Sunday morning to sit in heaven to Feast upon the world and to leave your problems behind and to just walk Where Angels walk and feel the Praises of God and say Lord I am so thankful to be a child of God I'm so happy I'm in heaven Lord this is where I belong I don't want to leave it just the comfort the peace the joy you know that problem that that feeling that our father that that will protect me that will take care of me it brings peace it brings those things and that's what God promises us so when we broke his law he loves us we went our own way he loved us when we said leave us alone we don't want you around anymore he stays around anyway he says I'll never leave you nor forsake you when we ran he followed when we hide he found us that's the God I serve that's the God I love that's the one I can say Lord that's how I that's how I experience you Lord Jesus many times in my life I wanted to run and hide but Lord you never left me you never forsook me you never you protected me there's so many many things that you can take and understand and know because God is real God is real the word is real it's it's a life that you can live and I feel sorry for people that live it out of out of law out of fear you should never fear to live for God never you always I have the Liberty to be who you are because I believe the way you see me Sunday is the way you're going to find me Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Friday we don't have a church day or a church phase and a work phase under this no we are the same because our father is the same yesterday today and forever we should be the same yesterday today and forever we should never change that's why we can call him by the spirit saying Abba Father father it's a deep deep relationship that we can express ourselves to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that is what we want to say so if you look about your own life many times many things happen unexplainable things the problem we have is most of the things that happen to us we've got no reason for it why did this happen Lord why did this happen but there's no explanation and when you look at that and you start to look at it the only thing you can do is you should trust the Lord to say that all things that happen to me happens for good the good I cannot see the good I don't know how this can be good out of this but God cannot lie or rather take myself my own situation and say you know what I don't understand it but God cannot lie he is the same yesterday today and forever so I trust him explicitly and therefore whatever happens to me I lead to learn to trust him and many things that happens is difficult extremely difficult you know it's like it's like and God knows how you feel when you sorrowful and you want to cry you cry before the Lord it's better to speak to him the way you feel if you're angry and upset tell him Lord I feel this way I feel I feel you've disappointed any character of The Bible like Moses you know when I start to talk with God and they start to talk like that there becomes a real real relationship that they talk and God can answer him and they come God wants you to express how you feel because then God can do something for you don't come with a smile on your face and say you know all is well if all is not well it's better to say yes I know God is in control but today I am disappointed and you go before God and you tell him Lord I am disappointed because then he can deal with you he can work with you he can help you he can uplift you and he can he can help you in many many different ways I have been disappointed many times in my life even feeling that God disappointed me but that's naturally the very first time I can relate to you I got we went my sister got the word and she repented and she came and she visited us on one weekend and she told us about the message the word the baptism she showed us in the Bible and we argue started to argue say no ways never ever a prophet in this day nothing forget it complete this is so wrong and she continues just to testify and talk and we argued and we argued and I think two weeks later or so you know the thing started to make sense something started to move and you know you because What attracted me was I could see it in the Bible I could see acts 238 is written there and that's what I like because about a month before that our Germany or Reverend I don't know what you call it but our pasta which is from a denomination who just came and visit us they do house visits and he sits and he asks you just a few questions he says if you die tonight do you know where you're going because they want to make sure that your salvation is certain and I said to him yes I know I'm going straight to hell and he was shocked he looked at me he thought I was joking I said no I'm serious and he took the Bible he showed me scriptures if you accept Jesus Christ you are safe but he never helped me it never changed anything for me I knew I had enough in me to know that if I die now I am lost and I told him I'm lost and he had no ability to to bring me to a fountain of water but never knowing that God was already working in my life in my wife's life we were starting to hunger and thirst for God and we had no idea what was happening and then you know a few weeks later here comes my sister you have Acts 2 38. and we fought it and we this but we could read it and that was started to pull us and we said okay let's go and see the past and we're in the car we drove to this house we came in we sat in the lounge and he opens the Bible and he reads Acts 2 38. you should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when he read that my wife jumped up she said she said I want to get baptized I looked at her I was shocked but one scripture and she had it she took it she had a revelation of it nothing about the message nothing about anything further one scripture repent and be baptized and she says no I'm not going home today until I'm baptized so she went with her hair that was shorter than mine red red ear right here right here red everywhere into the pool but she came out she went in a center and she came out to Saint the moment she came out her hair was long not physically but by revelation your hair can be this long that long the moment you accept Jesus Christ and the Revelation hit you your hair is long because it's a revelation and we went home and she was happy and I just said no leave me alone you can do it but I'm not gonna do it because I was scared because of what I saw in all the churches I saw things in churches let me tell you as a boy I sat under the chair sometimes you had to hide there because of how the people were running in the church and then one day the drummer he was sitting by the drums and as the Pentecostal would say the spirit of the Lord fell and he jumped up he ran and he jumped on top of the pulpit and to me as a young boy that impressed me in a way to realize man what is this you know how does your mind cannot understand it but it happened in front of you and he jumps up in here and the people are running up and down and and it was so and that sort of gave me a fright so I was a bit wary I was a bit careful and I went home again and we sat there and she was now baptized and I was just there and I was studying I was exams and there was this and my life was complete chaos the absolute absolute wrong time to serve God the worst time of my life and I said I remember I sat by my desk like this and all of a sudden the Lord just says now is your time I just got up I walked in there and I said I want to get baptized we went I got to the pool and I was so so thankful I was so happy that when I got to the pool there and I came out I had a big problem in my life and that was smoking so happy because I knew that the moment I come out of that water the smoking would be gone I was excited I was above everything else that that was something that I was excited about because I got many years tried to get Deliverance and I got out of the pool I was happy I was psyched up I was a man and we got in the car we drove back it was about an hour's drive or maybe a little bit more and as I halfway through that smoking demon attacked me and I started to fight I started to resist and disappointment took a hold of me I tell you and the devil started to tell me you know what there's nothing in this God doesn't even delivered you what is your problem this is can never be true you know how he speaks and I had a mind battle and I had a mind battling and and I I was just in my mind and I was so confused I was really confused and I said Lord how does this work how What Can I Do Lord what I thought I'm gonna be delivered Lord I feel disappointed that's what I said to him and I said Lord if you don't deliver me I cannot deliver myself and I took that cigarettes and I smoked it but I kept it before the Lord I said Lord you know I tried I cannot do it you have to do it for me Lord you must do it for me Lord and I just left it there and I hated it but I couldn't deliver myself and I just stood there and I and I every time I stood there and I and I smoked that cigarette I hated it but I had no power in myself I tried I thought I chewed chappies I put stickers I did everything those times there was no vaping and stuff like that but it was terrible and then I sat in the home and I was busy like I said it was a time of great pressure for me studies final exams and I was studying studying studying and all of a sudden I was alone the Lord came to me and all he said to me is now is your time I jumped up I'm a Believer for two weeks I don't even know proper gospel songs so I walked down the passage I thought no I'm going to sing to the Lord and I made up my own song Lord I love you appreciate you Lord and I walked down the passage to the kitchen I remember I turned back and I walked down the passage not a big house and I came to the bedroom I nailed it to my bed and I knelt all I prayed was Lord deliver me amen and I got up and you know that feeling it just left me I had not a desire I had no desire I had nothing from there I walked away there and my wife got home I said the Lord just delivered me and after today 30 years later I have never ever desired a smoke or anything like that in my whole life that's the power and that's the relationship you have with the Lord just to express yourself and say Lord he wants you to be real with him don't don't be super spiritual don't be super high and mighty don't be you know what I'm walking on water no just be natural speak to him and tell him I have a problem Lord I need your deliverance Lord I need a God a father that can dry the tears from my eyes because many times that's why he's such a good father when you need a father you need a father that can embrace you that can lead you that can comfort you that can guide you and that can bless you in all these things that we have a need of so that's what God has done for me but that's the relationship you need with the Lord to go from them to say you know what let's go forward and let's go this way and that way and this way and that way the drinking was easy you know we love beer there where we come from and so on but now the January the school opens and here I come with all my friends now remember when I saw them last time we were still doing all the things we were studying together and January come we enrolled we go to the to the houses and so on and one of the friends pulls out a big bottle of of whiskey or something because that's a tradition after enrollment we sit down and relax and I said to him no I'm not drinking anymore I thought it was a joke I said no I'm serious the Lord saved me and they looked at me looked at one another and it became very awkward and I told them what the Lord has done for me and all of them all of a sudden yes I also went to church on Sunday and all of this and you know starting to relate their things and that was the end of it they finished their bottle I went my way and so you can just realize the Lord is doing wonderful things here wonderful things there and if you look at your life Journey it's a Miraculous Journey it's a journey of love it's a journey of Grace it's a journey that he can take your situation in the uniqueness that you have as an individual that's my story and you everyone has got a story and every day of your life there's a news story so if you battle with something there is a way if there is a trial a test there is an outcome the Lord and the way you approach him hallow his name means that I honor him I bless him and I see him as my father I don't see him as my judge I don't see him as he's going to condemn me that's why one of the profound statements that the prophet make is even if he sent me to hell I'll serve him which means he's not serving him to go to heaven I'm not serving God to go to heaven I'm saving God because I love him I'm serving him because I really love him I'm serving him because I know what he's done for me I know where I was on my way to and I know he turned my direction around I know I was lost but now I'm found I know I was full fee but today I'm clean by his righteousness so all those things become real so we are no more servants it's Galatians says because you are Sons God have set forth the spirit of his son into your heart's crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if I stand in an heir of God through Christ is that right an heir now let me close with this I'll profit you know you always save when you speak about the prophet you can look at me and disagree with me but when you read the prophet we all relax is that right nothing can go wrong so he says after God has taken his wife and his daughter now I want you to understand this is a man under pressure this is a man disappointed he and he will tell it he is disappointed in God so it's not a new thing but the fact is we don't understand and because we don't approach it the right way we walk away from there and we think we're going to leave God Alone we're going to reject the word because God has failed us but we should always understand that God is in control and he knows the best we should always have confidence in him to say Lord help me in my unique situation so now he's under pressure he feels neglected imagine how you would feel if God takes your husband your children your wife whatever around you and he just takes them and it's God that took them you know it's not easy and that's where real reality of Life comes in many many many things happen to us we are not isolated we are not exempt we are not saved from those things God allows it we're a very very very specific reason but he's in control so he says one day I went I was working for the public service I clumped up a poll early one morning to take off a pole meter and I was standing there and I was singing on a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross and I happen to look and as the sun came up me hanging there on that pole working on these cross arms looked out on the side and they looked like my figure a wiggling looked like a cross out there and I thought oh Christ of God so he sees himself as the shadow on the pole it looks like somebody hanging on a cross look brings back memories it brings back an emotion he gets stirred to a level which is dangerous and I thought oh Christ of God yes it was my sins that nailed you there I'm sorry for what I've done and I I said God how could you ever put up with a person like me How Could You Lord you broke my heart he's not talking to God he's telling God straight you broke my heart that's what I mean when you start to talk to God from the depths when you tell him tell him the Deep secrets you know things that bother you things that haunt you things that worries you things it doesn't matter what that's what God wants from every one of his children to open up and to tell him you don't have to tell a person you don't have to when you talk to God like that it becomes different and that's what I encourage people to do have a real relationship with Jesus Christ with your father like you would have with a natural father almost because our natural force my father had lots of mistakes he was a man but I loved him he could never see the truth but I loved him and he told me why he rejected the message I asked him one day after we all got saved I asked him why he says because your Prophet is a false prophet he said that Saul went to heaven and Saul killed himself so he had a reason and I went home and I prayed I said Lord and he gave me the scripture and I read it and I went home still knew in the Lord and I read it and I said Lord what is this about help me Lord I don't know how to answer him and the Lord said just reach further and I continue to read and up comes another version another relation of uh you know a reference to what happened so the first one says Saul fell on his thought and he died that's where my father got stuck and the next one said so felony Sword and the Philistine came past and he asked the Philistine cut off my head man I was so happy I picked up the phone I phoned my father I said I found your answer phone me back okay he never phoned me back because he could not believe it there was nothing in him to believe it and when you start to realize you cannot make somebody a Believer you cannot change somebody that's not a Believer you must be gracious and kind and big enough to know Lord your seed cannot but receive your word but if somebody is not a Believer let me also love them because you love the whole world the Bible says he died for every sin that was ever committed the fact that you don't accept it that's the problem he will not die again but he has already died you broke my heart you grant me down but what can I do he's telling the Lord I am helpless I'm not in control of the situation the moment you realize you are not in control of life that's the time that God can start to help you you might make your own plans and God will cut them all off your time release on the arm of Flesh and God will take the arm off because he wants you to be completely 100 depend upon him he wants you to understand that he is God and he is in control that you cannot do anything of yourself you cannot change the color of your hair you cannot change the statue that you are you cannot make yourself longer or shorter you cannot do anything like that that's the way God brought you and I got real nervous now that's where the problem comes in and I had a pair of rubber gloves many of your linemen know 2300 running right by me the primary line and I thought Lucia I can lay my hand on that primary and in one minute's time I'll be with Sharon so what is he saying he's seeing a way out he's seeing a way out of disappointment a way out of his heart Brokenness he's saying if I can just take off this love and touch the line I'm finished all over amen and I jerked my glove off and I said God I've lost my mind or something and I said Sherry honey I can't stand it no more Daddy is coming home and I look at that line that will break every bone in my body and I say it now this is the part where he starts to pray even in the point of complete disappointment of nervousness of a point where he has lost all hope he is feeling deserted he is you know that that the lowest of the low and he's now going to take his own life his land is off he's busy reaching out he starts to pray and what does he pray the best prayer he can ever pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name and the first thing you know I was sitting down on the ground I don't know Jazzy spraying reaching out the next moment he wakes up on the floor God stepped in I believe that that gift hadn't been foreordained that have been the end of brother Branham right there that's what he says but God had something else to do he had to grind that heart out and let him know let me know that he's the one who rules and Reigns he was grinding him to telling the prophet I am the ruler I reign trust me trust me look upon me I know it's difficult I know but trust me and now he gets off from there now imagine this happened to you now he goes home and in he walks into his home and what happens the whole process start over again he says I went into the house and the first letter I looked at When Miss Sharon Rose Brenham 80 cents Christmas saving oh my it was all over again so the what which means you know when you when you overcome something it's not the end of it tomorrow you'll have to overcome again and again and again overcoming has become a natural part of your life you must know every day of my life I need to overcome something because that's part of God's plan for me I remember one day brother came to me and and it was so strange to me he said brother Hunters please pray for me that the Lord just takes these tests and trials away from me you know it was a strange thing and it was it was very serious so I can't take it anymore and I can't remember if we prayed or not or so but afterwards looking back all of a sudden his test and trials were gone and he left the message he left the Lord and he's in the world and I looked at that and I said Lord please give me a test and a trial just let me always be know that I am I am dependent upon your grace Lord let it never be my own power or my own salvation or my own Holiness not I've got no Holiness but your holiness so it's dangerous when you ask those kind of things it can become very dangerous he says so I went and I knelt on the floor and I started crying and I said God please have mercy upon me I'll take my own life I'd been a warden in the room at a gun and I went into this gun and I put the shells in it and I pulled the hammer back on the gun and I said Lord I have gone wild I don't know I was out of my head I put it up beside my head like this now can you imagine he's just just just went through him through a supernatural deliverance and let's say a few hours later he's back in the same situation you know your life is a journey you'll be one day on top of the mountain but the next day you'll be in the valley and the next day you'll be a mountain and the next day of the valley when you're in the valley trust the Lord like you trust him on the mountain it is the same God it is a journey he is the god if the sun is shining he's God if there's cloudiness and storms he's still God trust him unconditionally but too many people want to say I can only trust him when the sun is shining we trust him does not matter what happens if he grinds you you trust him and let me tell you he is gonna grind you if you are seed of God he's gonna grind you he's not going to spare you because he loves you he loves you so much that he will allow these things to happen that is so difficult to Bear but he says I'll never leave you I'll carry it with you my son my daughter I'll never leave you I'll never give you something that you cannot bear those are scriptures that you must just take and say Lord when you grind when these things happen Lord I trust you somewhere there must be something for me and he puts the gun besides he says I put the gun beside my head like this and I said now he prays again Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name and I squeezed the hammer but it wouldn't fall and I said Lord I can't even take my own life I threw the gun down and it shot all through the room and I said God why I've gone crazy I've lost my mind amen and he stood up there and he starts to realize but when you look at it in closing when he says Hallowed be your name it means glorify your name bring honor to your name and the only people that can bring honor to God's name is the believer because nobody else is going to honor God's name so when you pray that prayer when the prophet prayed that prayer him taking his life could never honor God's name never him destroying the the gift of God could never bring glory to God's name so God is is dedicated he's committed that your life will bring glory to his name so if you're in trouble and you don't know what to do just pray and say Lord let my life be allowing be a glorification to Your Name Lord let my life be in a true expression and God will lift you up God will do it because your self cannot do it but your life should always bring glory to God and that is the Saving Grace that's why God keeps us because there is a group of people that has to honor him that has to bless him that has to worship Him in spirit and in truth does not mother unconditionally so when you're in trouble just pray so Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallowed Be Your Name let my life bring honor to Your Name Lord I can't do it I'm weak that's why Paul says when I'm weak he becomes strong when I can't do it he can do it through me when I don't know what to do he still knows what to do but our Prophet was desperate and he prayed the perfect prayer and when it every time he comes to that Hallowed be your name that's where God stepped in because God will not allow he cannot allow he would never allow so he's zealous over you he will protect you he will keep you that's not I don't care what what the economics does I don't care what happens I don't care what laws they pass I don't care how difficult it becomes it's got nothing to do with it I'm not looking to myself I'm not looking to a natural man-made heaven I'm looking to God and to say Lord if you tarry it's going to become more difficult and if you tarry longer Lord I don't know how many will be left but Lord you said Hallowed be your name and there must be people on the face of the Earth that fulfill that scripture Lord and Lord let it be me today Lord let it be me that my life can bring a glory and a testimony and an expression of love and grace to your name that's what God wants from us if we have that attitude and that approach and that commitment to say Lord that's why I'm here to glorify your name take my situation change it make it different I can't do it Lord I've tried many times but lord it's in your hands may you just look upon me Lord and I can promise you God will do it because it's not about you anymore then it's about his name you have linked yourself to his name and he steps on the scene and he changes the situation because of his name because of what he has promised this I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end of time imagine unconditional it's nothing to do with what you do don't do it's unconditional how he saved you how he kept you How He blesses you because of the Halloween the glorification of his name the blessing of his name God is zealous over his name and he's zealous over you he will take care of you in a beautiful way amen let's bow our heads if you have a need this morning you can raise your hand to the Lord say Lord remember me eye Lord maybe has been disappointed I have things upon my heart and I need to just speak to you about it Lord God knows your need father as we bow our heads in your presence we certainly are thankful that we can call you our heavenly father and that we can address you Lord in this way as family as the redeemed and when we look at these things a lot these scriptures and things that happen in our own lives and to our prophet father we understand that there's a plan there's a plan of life there's a Plan of Redemption there's a plan that you are perfecting us oh God and that you can make us perfect in all ways O Lord that we can stand up to thee and know father God you are a gracious God and we love and appreciate you this morning may you discern every needle father may you be the bomb of Gilead and may your father God you
