[40:33] before we take a seat um you can just
[40:35] turn in your bibles to
[40:37] romans eight i'm just going to read a
[40:38] few little scriptures from there
[40:40] um just they already just asked me last
[40:43] night if i
[40:43] wouldn't mind to share five minutes uh i
[40:46] don't know how 5 minutes is going to go
[40:48] it's going to be a bit rough to get it
[40:50] in five minutes but we'll
[40:52] we'll see what the lord does i'll try
[40:55] and keep it short
[40:56] and sweet and to the point romans 8 and
[40:58] verses
[40:59] 28 to 31 thank you musicians what a
[41:02] wonderful
[41:03] atmosphere here this morning and just
[41:05] appreciate
[41:06] the presence of the lord
[41:10] it goes on and says and we know that all
[41:12] things work together for good to them
[41:14] that love god to them who are called
[41:17] according to his purpose
[41:19] for whom he did fore know he did
[41:22] predestinate to be conformed to the
[41:25] image of his son
[41:26] that he might be the firstborn among
[41:28] many brethren moreover whom he did
[41:31] predestinate them he
[41:32] also called and whom he called then he
[41:34] also justified
[41:36] whom he justified them he also glorified
[41:40] focus on this last verse here what shall
[41:42] we say
[41:43] what shall we then say to these things
[41:46] if god before us
[41:48] who can be against us i have your seats
[41:51] this morning
[41:53] we've been having a wonderful time
[41:57] amongst all the youth this weekend each
[41:58] one of you have
[42:00] have a good time i made you maybe new
[42:02] friends and
[42:04] and rekindled old friendships and just
[42:06] strengthened
[42:07] your relationships with each other over
[42:09] this time and
[42:10] we know that the devil is not happy with
[42:12] that
[42:14] he's not going to keep trying to keep it
[42:16] that way he's going to want to try and
[42:17] destroy that he's going to want to try
[42:19] and break those friendships down by
[42:21] bringing in little
[42:22] isms or little things that maybe
[42:24] somebody says to
[42:25] to destroy a relationship the devil will
[42:29] try and twist any words that might be
[42:30] spoken amongst you
[42:32] to try and separate you again and let
[42:35] you go off on separate paths
[42:37] and isolate yourself and put yourself in
[42:39] a corner somewhere because he's
[42:41] that's what he wants to do it's like a
[42:43] coal that you take from a fire and you
[42:44] put it on the side
[42:46] it gets cold and it dies off and that's
[42:48] exactly what the enemy wants to do with
[42:50] each one of you
[42:50] your lives is to separate you put you in
[42:53] a little cocoon somewhere
[42:56] and die off and get cold
[43:00] but i encourage you to spend time
[43:03] together
[43:05] found a friend that you can pray with
[43:07] somebody that will encourage you in the
[43:08] word
[43:09] somebody that will lift you up not
[43:10] somebody that will draw you away from
[43:12] the things of the word
[43:14] rather just build friends that are one
[43:16] that's to draw you closer to god and
[43:17] that you can do things to support
[43:20] the cause of this gospel in this day and
[43:23] we can rest in what god has done in our
[43:24] lives
[43:25] we can have a peace in our lives we do
[43:27] not need to fear anymore
[43:29] about what the enemy will try and bring
[43:30] against us because our god is more than
[43:32] able
[43:33] to deliver us and to bring us through
[43:35] because our god is the one that is
[43:37] for us as that scripture says so who can
[43:40] be against us there is no one that can
[43:41] come against there is nothing that can
[43:43] come against you
[43:44] we have the greatest one that's on the
[43:46] inside of us
[43:48] it's not our own strength it's not our
[43:49] own energy that we can do this in
[43:51] it's nothing that we can achieve only by
[43:54] his grace
[43:55] that we can this morning and
[43:59] the great thing is that the lord has
[44:00] started a work in your life
[44:02] and he is the one that is going to
[44:04] finish that work
[44:05] we don't need to worry about that
[44:07] because god is not
[44:09] a haphazard project manager that comes
[44:12] on the scene to start a project and
[44:14] and start something and not realize how
[44:16] much it's going to cost
[44:17] we might do that we try and do
[44:19] renovations maybe at home or different
[44:20] things
[44:21] and we get halfway through and oh we
[44:22] haven't budgeted for this we haven't
[44:24] thought about this unforeseen thing but
[44:26] with god nothing is unforeseen
[44:28] he sees the end from the beginning he
[44:30] knows exactly what the cost is going to
[44:32] be
[44:32] to bring you to the end and he has
[44:35] already paid that full price
[44:37] god has got all the resources that he
[44:40] needs
[44:41] to do the work in your life there is no
[44:44] sin that you could have gone too far and
[44:46] that god cannot change that this morning
[44:48] that he cannot wash that clean the blood
[44:50] of jesus christ is so powerful
[44:53] the devil will try and tell you that
[44:55] you've gone too far that you've crossed
[44:57] the line that you
[44:58] you there's no more hope for you but i
[45:00] want to encourage you this morning that
[45:02] there is
[45:04] god is here this morning still to change
[45:06] our life he is still the same god
[45:08] yesterday today and forever he's never
[45:10] failed he never changes
[45:12] there is no plan b with god when he
[45:14] starts with you he knows the end result
[45:16] he's never going to throw you out
[45:19] and god can't fix any of your problems
[45:22] you don't need to listen to the enemy
[45:24] that tells us god can't fix me
[45:26] god has raised us up each one of us is
[45:28] different each one of us have a purpose
[45:29] that god has
[45:30] called us to be and i cannot be like you
[45:33] and you cannot be like me i cannot
[45:35] preach like brother tazewell
[45:37] or the other wonderful ministers i'm not
[45:39] them
[45:40] and they're not me so each one of us are
[45:42] a tool in god's toolbox this morning
[45:45] and god who pulls out a tool at
[45:46] different times to do different work
[45:48] he does not bring out a hammer to to
[45:50] screw a screw into the wall
[45:52] yes you might get a similar result but
[45:53] it's going to be a bit of a mess
[45:55] so we cannot use god does it you know
[45:58] god uses you
[45:59] individually for the situation that is
[46:01] that is a that is the need of the hour
[46:05] so don't feel bad if you don't get
[46:06] called on from the lord every single
[46:08] meeting
[46:08] to do something for him the lord knows
[46:12] an appointed time
[46:13] where you will pull out you could be a
[46:15] tool in a box for a year or ten years
[46:17] and god will reach us down and says
[46:19] today i have need of this
[46:21] and just maybe for that one time in your
[46:23] life
[46:24] that god has need of you to say
[46:26] something to change a soul
[46:28] to reach out to somebody and that could
[46:31] be your moment
[46:33] just keep humble before the lord keeps
[46:35] it sincere before him and trust him that
[46:37] he will bring
[46:38] you into that position rest in him
[46:42] this morning we can trust in god
[46:45] that he will bring those things out for
[46:47] us so we can stand firm in this battle
[46:50] knowing that god is before us
[46:55] so don't try and be somebody else
[46:57] because
[46:58] we're going to put a pressure on
[46:59] ourselves that's unnecessary
[47:01] try and be something that we are not
[47:04] we try and live this message in a
[47:06] legalistic approach and then it becomes
[47:08] so hard it becomes such a difficult walk
[47:10] because we're trying to attain maybe to
[47:12] a brother or sister that's sitting on
[47:13] the side of us
[47:14] i want to be so spiritual like them but
[47:16] you don't know what they're going
[47:18] through behind it might just be a front
[47:20] you don't know what goes on behind
[47:21] closed doors what they struggle with
[47:25] so just relax in his presence the lord
[47:27] is working on you
[47:30] i just encourage you just to take god at
[47:33] his word and stand on it
[47:34] trust him to see you through to the end
[47:38] because the theme of what i wanted to
[47:42] bring forth this morning is
[47:44] we are disruptors we're disruptors to
[47:48] satan's plan
[47:49] to satan's plan he had for you he will
[47:52] come to disrupt you
[47:53] disrupt his program and then i just
[47:56] googled this quickly last night to found
[47:57] out what the disrupter
[47:59] means and they say to be a disrupter is
[48:02] to create
[48:03] a product a service or a way of doing
[48:05] things which is
[48:06] which displaces the existing existence
[48:10] market leaders
[48:11] and eventually replaces them at the helm
[48:14] of the sector so that is what you are
[48:18] here today
[48:19] you're a disrupter this morning you're
[48:22] yet to disrupt the enemy's plans that he
[48:24] had for you
[48:25] god has come and intervened with you
[48:26] this morning he's coming and has just
[48:28] changed your life
[48:29] you're no longer needing to dance to
[48:31] this music sheets of satan anymore that
[48:33] great composer has come and taken over
[48:36] you can now dance with the lord here is
[48:38] now captivated your life
[48:39] he has changed your your direction that
[48:42] you are heading in
[48:43] here's a disruptor in your life you yet
[48:45] to change the course of where you were
[48:48] going
[48:49] that's what the that's what the lord has
[48:51] come to do this this weekend
[48:53] such a privilege that we've had to see
[48:55] young people
[48:56] blossom in the things of the lord and
[48:58] just being together and
[48:59] and just fellowshipping one to with
[49:01] another what a wonderful thing it is
[49:04] so go forth god has raised up this
[49:06] generation right in this dark age to be
[49:08] a disrupter
[49:10] we are dangerous to the enemy
[49:14] super dangerous to him as our brother
[49:17] says be on the most wanted list in hell
[49:19] we are dangerous to the work of the
[49:21] enemy
[49:23] that's what you are this morning you
[49:25] might be sitting there thinking i'm not
[49:27] much i'm just a little sister little
[49:28] brother
[49:29] sitting here on the outskirts no
[49:32] you're important to god you're a
[49:34] disrupter
[49:36] this morning you can change the course
[49:38] of life for those around you and for
[49:40] yourself
[49:41] that's what god has brought us just want
[49:44] to read
[49:45] a quote quickly out of the church age
[49:48] message
[49:49] and then i hopefully haven't gone too
[49:52] long yet
[49:53] but brother branham says now remember
[49:56] this
[49:56] christ in the church and christ in the
[49:59] true church
[50:00] is a continuation of the book of acts
[50:04] that's exactly what i have before us
[50:05] this morning a continuation of the book
[50:08] of acts
[50:09] it's not your parents religion anymore
[50:11] your parents believe writing a book
[50:12] it's your turn this morning to write the
[50:15] book of acts
[50:16] it's your turn to step up and take the
[50:19] lead
[50:20] and to take this message into a new
[50:22] generation
[50:24] but the book of revelation shows how
[50:26] that the antichrist spirit
[50:28] would come into the true come into the
[50:31] church and defile it
[50:32] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[50:36] he says it exposes satan revealing his
[50:39] works
[50:39] attempted destruction of god's people
[50:42] that's what the enemy has tried to do
[50:44] how to destruct your lives put you on a
[50:47] course
[50:48] that was heading to destruction but god
[50:50] has come and changed it today
[50:56] he goes on he says right right down to
[51:00] the tom
[51:00] he is cast into the lake of fire this is
[51:02] talking about where the end of
[51:04] where satan is going that's that's his
[51:05] destination so whenever he comes to to
[51:08] try and convince you that you're not
[51:09] born again and you've got this wrong
[51:11] that wrong you can remind him of his
[51:13] he's their destination this morning he's
[51:16] headed for lake of fire we're heading
[51:18] to the streets of gold with our heavenly
[51:20] heaven god
[51:22] this
[51:25] he fights that this is not a walk in the
[51:28] park the enemy hates that
[51:30] and he's going to fight you on every
[51:31] side he says he cannot stand it
[51:34] he knows that if the people get the true
[51:36] revelation of the true church
[51:38] and what she is what she stands for and
[51:41] that she
[51:41] can do the greater works she will be an
[51:44] invincible
[51:45] army if they get a true revelation of
[51:49] the two spirits
[51:50] within the framework of the christian
[51:51] church and by god's spirit discern and
[51:54] withstand
[51:55] the antichrist spirit that's what you're
[51:59] here to withstand that
[52:00] it's not something you can do on
[52:01] yourself it's taking on the christ
[52:03] spirit in you that withstands that
[52:04] antichrist spirit
[52:06] satan will be powerless before her
[52:10] once we have that spirit of god in us
[52:12] satan is powerless
[52:14] powerless before us he's a bluff and
[52:16] he's a good bluff
[52:18] but he is powerless he will be as
[52:22] definitely taught today as when christ
[52:25] withstood
[52:26] his every effort to gain power over him
[52:29] in the desert
[52:30] that's what power we have within us the
[52:32] same power it was in christ because
[52:34] christ is in you so what difference
[52:36] he is the one that is doing the work is
[52:37] not your energy your strength
[52:39] it is christ that is coming to you
[52:46] so with true revelation in our lives the
[52:49] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[52:52] but we will prevail over them
[52:55] so we are the ones of chosen generations
[52:58] today we are raised up as an
[53:00] invincible army we can the enemy cannot
[53:03] destroy us
[53:04] we have the life of christ in us and
[53:06] that can never be destroyed the enemy
[53:07] tried that on the cross 2000 years ago
[53:09] and he could not keep him in the grave
[53:11] he rose again and that same life is in
[53:13] each one of you this morning
[53:15] we are an invincible army the enemy
[53:17] trembles at us we are dangerous look at
[53:19] jericho's the walls
[53:20] that just fell down those people that
[53:22] were there how they feared
[53:24] the israelites of what the great lord
[53:26] had done through their lives
[53:29] so you young people this morning are
[53:31] able to
[53:33] slay the enemy that comes your way to
[53:35] christ that helps us
[53:38] in joshua two and not two and ten or
[53:41] nine
[53:42] i'm just going to read a few script
[53:43] scriptures there that's the account of
[53:45] when the two spies went to rahab he said
[53:49] and he said unto them i know that the
[53:52] lord has given you the land
[53:53] and that your terror is befallen upon us
[53:57] that's what satan is trembling in his
[53:58] boots this morning we have a group of
[54:00] young people here that are filled with
[54:02] the holy spirit
[54:03] and the enemy is trembling this is what
[54:05] his their report was they were trembling
[54:07] because they were coming towards him and
[54:09] so when the enemy sees you coming
[54:11] he is trembling but he'll try and put up
[54:13] a big wall a big front
[54:14] a big giant to try and scare you off
[54:18] but he can't they are fury he's fearing
[54:20] in his boots
[54:22] he says for we have heard how the lord
[54:25] dried up the water
[54:26] you can reference look what the lord had
[54:28] done throughout your parents look what
[54:30] the lord has done to us this weekend
[54:31] look at what he's done through the
[54:32] prophet we can refer the enemy back and
[54:34] say look this is what the lord has done
[54:35] for me
[54:36] we are almighty mighty army
[54:41] so for we have heard how the lord dried
[54:43] up the water of the red sea
[54:44] for you when you came out of egypt what
[54:47] he did unto
[54:51] yeah unto the two kings of the ammonites
[54:55] so the lord is here to deliver you from
[54:59] whatever
[55:00] we need there's many examples you can
[55:03] look at other
[55:04] young ones that have been delivered from
[55:05] from drugs and alcohol and lust and
[55:07] all those different things we can refer
[55:09] back to that and say lord as you heard
[55:11] brother adrian said last night
[55:12] look at what they've done for them you
[55:14] can do it from here he is here
[55:15] we are called to be overcomers this this
[55:18] day
[55:19] god has called you to be that you are
[55:22] that great
[55:23] salmon that flows up the stream you're
[55:24] not going with the big stream down the
[55:26] down to the waterfall and heading into
[55:28] destruction like the rest of the world
[55:29] god has raised you up
[55:31] to be a disrupter to go against the
[55:33] stream against the flow that is coming
[55:35] your way
[55:36] that is what god has raised you up for
[55:38] at the same time
[55:40] and the god's word is what defines who
[55:42] you are not what your friend might say
[55:44] or the enemy on your shoulder might say
[55:46] or or the mistakes that you make do not
[55:47] define you
[55:49] god's word is what defines you this
[55:51] morning and you can take confidence in
[55:53] that
[55:54] it's not your own report or the enemy's
[55:56] report we can believe the report of the
[55:58] lord this morning
[56:00] so i just want to encourage you this
[56:01] morning with those few thoughts
[56:03] just to spend time together fellowship
[56:07] around the things of
[56:08] the lord and if you do see one that is
[56:10] drifting off and getting cold
[56:11] reach out and love to them don't cut
[56:14] them off
[56:15] that's the worst thing you could ever do
[56:16] is they are they meddling in the things
[56:18] of the world i'm gonna push them aside
[56:20] no reach out and love don't go with the
[56:22] critical heart and the critical spirit
[56:23] and condemn
[56:25] but go with love and save our brothers
[56:27] there's something i can pray with i see
[56:28] you struggling
[56:30] because you guys know each other better
[56:31] than what we would ever know

[56:36] those that are strong on the things of
[56:37] the lord

[56:51] together and talk a fellowship about the
[56:54] things of the lord and just encourage
[56:55] one another
[56:56] yes we also played cricket and sports
[56:58] and different things we messed around
[57:00] and had fun
[57:01] but there's times where we needed to
[57:03] spend time around the things of the lord
[57:05] so i encourage you it's fun to have play
[57:07] games and do all those things that
[57:08] you've done this weekend
[57:09] but encourage one another too in the
[57:11] things of the
[57:12] lord and it is a joy to serve the lord
[57:15] it's not something that we have to be
[57:17] sad about
[57:20] so i just trusted this morning that we
[57:22] can go
[57:23] forth from this place and disrupt the
[57:25] plans of satan for your life
[57:27] and change the course that the enemy
[57:30] wanted you

[1:02:28] i was just going to read one verse from
[1:02:29] verse 18.
[1:02:36] and it says for i reckon that the
[1:02:38] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:02:40] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:02:42] which shall be revealed unto us
[1:02:44] amen you guys can take your seats
[1:02:48] i'm going to start off with a brother
[1:02:51] brenham quote

[1:02:56] um believers though this he says reminds
[1:03:00] me of paul raider
[1:03:01] how many of you ever remember heard of
[1:03:03] paul rayder well i guess
[1:03:04] you all have he he's probably preached
[1:03:06] here a few years ago
[1:03:08] one day him and his wife he was sitting
[1:03:10] at a table and know you know how
[1:03:12] families are
[1:03:13] something came up she wanted to go
[1:03:14] somewhere and he didn't wouldn't let her
[1:03:16] go
[1:03:17] so he said no i just can't do it
[1:03:20] i got something else to do and so he
[1:03:22] hurt her feelings
[1:03:24] he looked over and she was crying so he
[1:03:26] just thought wow cry
[1:03:28] and and he said he got his hat and
[1:03:31] started out
[1:03:32] and she'd always meet him at the door
[1:03:34] and kiss him goodbye when he left
[1:03:37] said brother branham when i came to the
[1:03:38] door said she was standing there with
[1:03:40] her head down
[1:03:41] she kissed me goodbye all right sid i
[1:03:44] went out to the gate and pulled the gate
[1:03:46] together and looked back
[1:03:47] she's always standing at the gate and
[1:03:48] waved and said she was standing or
[1:03:50] standing at the door and waved as he
[1:03:52] went
[1:03:52] out the gate said she was at the door
[1:03:56] she waved
[1:03:57] said i went down the street and said i
[1:03:59] began to think about it
[1:04:00] said my heart began to get bigger and
[1:04:02] bigger you know
[1:04:03] think about what what had happened what
[1:04:06] if something were to happen to me today
[1:04:08] she's my wife i love her i remember the
[1:04:11] vows
[1:04:12] said after a while he got or his heart
[1:04:15] got so big he couldn't stand it and he
[1:04:16] turned back
[1:04:17] around and back up and the way he went
[1:04:20] up the street
[1:04:21] opened the gate ran into the door
[1:04:24] real quick shoved the door open looked
[1:04:26] it looked around for her
[1:04:28] and said she was standing behind the
[1:04:29] door crying said
[1:04:31] he just grabbed her never said a word
[1:04:33] turned around kissed her
[1:04:34] turned around walked out the door said
[1:04:36] he walked down the gate and started out
[1:04:38] started out the gate said he turned
[1:04:41] around and she was standing at the gate
[1:04:42] said he waved goodbye and said she waved
[1:04:45] goodbye again
[1:04:47] um so many times recently
[1:04:50] and even you know often ministers say
[1:04:54] what they're preaching they're going
[1:04:56] through themselves
[1:05:00] and my sermon has been my testimony this
[1:05:02] morning
[1:05:06] and it's an interesting quote because
[1:05:09] um it's an odd quote from because you're
[1:05:11] all mostly single youth
[1:05:13] but it's the principle i want to focus
[1:05:16] on this morning
[1:05:17] um you know how many times have you been
[1:05:19] in situations where
[1:05:21] something happens between a brother or a
[1:05:23] sister or a friend a mum and a dad
[1:05:26] you know that kind of stuff can fester
[1:05:28] and your mind goes all sorts of places
[1:05:30] and what if the lord takes you tomorrow
[1:05:32] that person is left with that situation
[1:05:35] going on in their head and they there's
[1:05:37] no way to
[1:05:39] make peace with that because that person
[1:05:40] is there to no longer do it in romans
[1:05:44] chapter six oh sorry romans chapter
[1:05:46] eight verse six and seven it says
[1:05:49] to be carnally minded as death but to be
[1:05:52] spiritually minded as life and peace
[1:05:54] because the carnal mind is
[1:05:55] enmity against god for it is not subject
[1:05:58] to the law of god neither indeed
[1:06:00] can be so the mind the mind is always
[1:06:05] it's the one thing that is not under
[1:06:09] control of god because
[1:06:11] god can come into your mind or speak to
[1:06:13] you through your heart and your soul but
[1:06:14] the devil can also be putting thoughts
[1:06:16] into your minds all the times
[1:06:19] and what often happens and certainly in
[1:06:21] my own life anyway and i'm sure a lot of
[1:06:23] you guys are affected by this as well
[1:06:25] instead of addressing those issues and
[1:06:27] getting down on our knees and praying
[1:06:29] about it and asking the lord's guidance
[1:06:30] on that what do we do
[1:06:32] we go to social media we jump on youtube
[1:06:34] we watch tik tok
[1:06:35] you know rather than actually spending
[1:06:37] time with the lord and trying to resolve
[1:06:39] those things
[1:06:39] we mask it by watching youtube doing
[1:06:42] those things
[1:06:43] rather than actually trying to better
[1:06:46] ourselves and those things
[1:06:47] and i always looked it this way we're in
[1:06:49] a relationship with god
[1:06:51] where we are his bride he is the husband
[1:06:54] and when we
[1:06:56] turn to those things we are ignoring him
[1:06:59] he wants us to bring our problems our
[1:07:01] needs our issues that we've got
[1:07:03] and talk to him intimately and and for
[1:07:06] us to come to his bosom
[1:07:08] and feed um and all we do
[1:07:11] is we feed our flesh with short-term
[1:07:13] gratification the issue is still there
[1:07:15] after we finish
[1:07:20] and then in question answers
[1:07:25] there's a question that came across
[1:07:28] and the question was should evangelist
[1:07:30] continue in the field
[1:07:32] in this hour of course what they mean
[1:07:35] certainly by all means
[1:07:36] don't change a thing if jesus is coming
[1:07:38] in the morning preach like it was going
[1:07:40] to be 10 years from today
[1:07:42] but live like it's going to be at this
[1:07:44] hour
[1:07:45] don't get scrupled up about up now
[1:07:48] that's not what i'm trying to warn you
[1:07:49] about see
[1:07:50] just don't be odd peculiar don't change
[1:07:53] nothing if you're gonna do something
[1:07:54] wrong
[1:07:55] or doing evil repency come back to god
[1:07:58] continue on your evangelic service as
[1:08:01] you
[1:08:02] always did if you're building a house
[1:08:05] put it on up
[1:08:06] jesus comes tomorrow you be found
[1:08:08] faithful
[1:08:09] at your duty if you're building a church
[1:08:11] go on put it up i'd rather be putting
[1:08:14] my money in something like that than be
[1:08:15] found with it in my pocket see
[1:08:19] continue right on just go right as you
[1:08:22] were
[1:08:23] now just don't stop don't do nothing
[1:08:25] just go right as you were
[1:08:28] as you are keep on knowing it was 15
[1:08:31] minutes before quizzing
[1:08:33] yeah oh sorry now for instance instance
[1:08:36] if you was
[1:08:37] if you're working for a man and you know
[1:08:39] it was 15 minutes before quizzing time
[1:08:41] where i'd say ah just 15 more minutes
[1:08:43] well i might as well just go over and
[1:08:44] sit down
[1:08:45] you'd get docked for that 15 minutes if
[1:08:48] you're planting wheat plant your wheat
[1:08:50] if you're digging potatoes keep go on
[1:08:53] dig them out
[1:08:54] well nobody will eat them that don't
[1:08:56] make any difference dig them out anyhow
[1:08:58] see
[1:08:58] just continue on as you are and that's
[1:09:01] that's so difficult today
[1:09:03] as christians because we know that time
[1:09:05] is so near
[1:09:07] and sometimes we can get so caught up
[1:09:10] in our circumstances and
[1:09:18] and
[1:09:20] we get so caught up in our circumstances
[1:09:21] that
[1:09:24] we don't actually live the most that we
[1:09:26] can for god today
[1:09:28] rather than so we get caught up in our
[1:09:31] circumstances
[1:09:32] and we forget about the lord and then if
[1:09:35] the rep
[1:09:36] you know if the rapture was to come you
[1:09:37] know what state are you in to be ready
[1:09:39] you always need to be ready
[1:09:41] but also you need to plant your potatoes
[1:09:43] for tomorrow you want to make the most
[1:09:44] out of every day you've got
[1:09:46] um because you never know what the next
[1:09:48] day is going to hold in your life and
[1:09:49] the trials that you're going to have
[1:09:51] um so i guess my two final statements
[1:09:54] are plant your t potatoes but
[1:09:56] be ready if he comes today and cherish
[1:09:58] the moments you have because you never
[1:10:00] know how long you've got
[1:10:03] and to finish off i want to sing a quick
[1:10:06] song
[1:10:06] which ties into the title which i didn't
[1:10:08] tell you which is called living for
[1:10:09] today
[1:10:10] so i'll do that now
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:34] sitting at my room staring at the wall
[1:10:37] wondering about the meaning of it all
[1:10:40] why is it this thing called life has got
[1:10:42] me going crazy
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] so i open up your word and let it speak
[1:10:49] to me
[1:10:49] the purpose and the plan that you have
[1:10:51] designed is clear to see
[1:10:55] and i believe
[1:10:58] i'm gonna live for the day
[1:11:01] i'm gonna follow in your way
[1:11:05] i'm gonna let my little light shine like
[1:11:08] there's no tomorrow
[1:11:11] i won't worry about the past
[1:11:14] i know my future isn't taxed
[1:11:18] so i'll choose to live my life
[1:11:21] one way i'm gonna leave it for the day
[1:11:32] you told me not to worry about what lies
[1:11:34] ahead
[1:11:35] so i am gonna focus on today instead
[1:11:38] making every moment counting accounts on
[1:11:40] every single blessing
[1:11:44] i'm gonna set my mind on the here and
[1:11:47] now
[1:11:48] and this is what i want my life to be
[1:11:51] about
[1:11:53] and this is how
[1:11:56] i'm gonna live for the day
[1:12:00] i'm gonna follow in your way
[1:12:03] i'm gonna let my little light shine
[1:12:06] light is not tomorrow
[1:12:10] i won't worry about the past
[1:12:13] i know my future is intact
[1:12:16] so i'll choose to live my life
[1:12:19] one way
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] it's got me spinning around and around
[1:12:35] hanging
[1:12:36] upside down taking one step
[1:12:41] at a time
[1:12:44] holding your hand all the way
[1:12:48] and it'll be again
[1:12:51] i'm gonna live for the day
[1:12:54] i'm gonna follow in your way
[1:12:58] i'm gonna let my little light shine like
[1:13:01] there's no tomorrow
[1:13:04] i won't worry about the past
[1:13:07] i know my future is intact
[1:13:11] so i'll choose to live my life
[1:13:14] one way i'm gonna live it for
[1:13:19] [Music]

[1:15:52] everything i was gonna say
[1:15:54] so i'll just i'll just echo what he said
[1:15:57] um and i'm i'm just gonna
[1:16:01] say what was the highlight for me and um
[1:16:03] what i got out of this weekend and it's
[1:16:04] um
[1:16:05] you know as we go back to our everyday
[1:16:07] lives our lives in the flesh is by the
[1:16:09] food he said
[1:16:10] it's um you know it's out of this
[1:16:12] atmosphere it's out of
[1:16:14] out of the positive environment that we
[1:16:16] had here and we go back to everyday life
[1:16:18] and just face our own
[1:16:20] you know our the trials that we that
[1:16:22] that we do
[1:16:25] um you know what it's what it means for
[1:16:28] me is you know
[1:16:29] the lord has given us the key to live a
[1:16:32] victorious life
[1:16:33] in this life and you know um
[1:16:37] we don't have to live a mediocre life we
[1:16:39] can we we certainly can
[1:16:41] live a life of overcoming and
[1:16:45] and you know what the lord has done for
[1:16:47] us we don't have to bow down to
[1:16:49] you know things in our lives that we
[1:16:51] struggle with um
[1:16:53] you know those things that bug us the
[1:16:54] most the key is there for us it's um
[1:16:58] yeah it's a fight like it's always gonna
[1:16:59] be a fight
[1:17:01] but but yeah the lord has made the way
[1:17:03] for us
[1:17:05] and um i like what the brothers have
[1:17:08] said
[1:17:09] you know we have the key to tear down
[1:17:13] satan's kingdom
[1:17:14] in our lives he's got plans for our
[1:17:16] lives um
[1:17:18] but you know the devil's plans has been
[1:17:19] cancelled and and you know
[1:17:21] we we can mean something for someone
[1:17:24] else
[1:17:24] again you know and um allow the lord
[1:17:27] just
[1:17:28] to work through us um
[1:17:31] but what i've also realized is you know
[1:17:34] it cost something it cost it costs you
[1:17:36] everything
[1:17:37] um you know we've got ambitions and
[1:17:39] certain ideas for this life
[1:17:41] um i know i've got my ideal idea of what
[1:17:44] i want to do and
[1:17:45] well not necessarily what i want to do
[1:17:47] but i i've got my idea of fun and what
[1:17:49] i'd like out of this life
[1:17:51] and to be honest you know you can you
[1:17:53] can make certain things an idol
[1:17:55] and and and not really give the lord
[1:17:58] that first place in your life
[1:18:00] and um and and that's what he asked for
[1:18:02] it's like it says in matthew um
[1:18:05] where um you know it speaks about if
[1:18:07] you're not willing to take up your cross
[1:18:09] and follow him you're not worthy of him
[1:18:11] and that's um it's quite a direct
[1:18:13] statement
[1:18:14] so yeah may the lord just help us to lay
[1:18:16] down
[1:18:17] you know every facet of our lives and um
[1:18:20] you know as
[1:18:21] brother adam said if you if you've
[1:18:22] gained this whole world like you often
[1:18:24] look at
[1:18:25] maybe sports styles or whatever whatever
[1:18:27] you look at they
[1:18:29] you know they give their everything for
[1:18:31] for what they attain and what they
[1:18:33] become good at but
[1:18:34] the real reality is you know you look at
[1:18:37] them you think oh
[1:18:38] you know i'm missing out but if you've
[1:18:41] missed christ and you've gained that
[1:18:42] you've missed the mark you know at the
[1:18:44] end of their lives
[1:18:46] where are they going
[1:18:50] um and elizabeth adrian said last night
[1:18:52] you know we've we've got to
[1:18:54] lay down ourselves our own south wales
[1:18:56] so that his strength can be made perfect
[1:18:58] and now
[1:18:59] in our own weaknesses and
[1:19:00] insufficiencies
[1:19:03] i just want to can you put on that quote
[1:19:04] please um brother random captures it
[1:19:07] quite nicely
[1:19:09] right there so and why does god let
[1:19:12] troubles come
[1:19:13] god harnesses trouble and puts bits in
[1:19:16] its mouth and makes it obey him
[1:19:18] and those troubles bring us into a
[1:19:20] closer fellowship with god
[1:19:22] um yeah that just it just says it right
[1:19:24] there
[1:19:25] and so it's more valuable than than you
[1:19:29] know comfort and peace
[1:19:37] and uh actually brother and you said
[1:19:39] something last week that uh
[1:19:40] that sort of stuck with me a little bit
[1:19:42] and that was you know
[1:19:44] you know christ has won a complete
[1:19:45] victory for us is complete there's
[1:19:47] every you know every trial in your life
[1:19:50] has a due date
[1:19:51] and even maybe that thorn in the flesh
[1:19:53] that the lord's left there
[1:19:54] even that's got a due date like it might
[1:19:56] be like paul
[1:19:58] when you pass over but you know it's a
[1:20:00] total victory there's absolutely nothing
[1:20:01] that can actually
[1:20:03] stand you know
[1:20:07] um and brother just finished that quote
[1:20:10] um we ask for comfort and peace god
[1:20:13] gives us the best he could give us
[1:20:14] trials and tribulations that's better
[1:20:16] than comfort and peace
[1:20:18] our comfort is just beyond the river
[1:20:21] it's so easy to say but that is true
[1:20:27] and um and i was talking to a brother
[1:20:30] over the weekend and what we were
[1:20:33] talking about is you know
[1:20:34] this opportunity that we have on this
[1:20:36] side that's
[1:20:37] once in all eternity that we have really
[1:20:40] and
[1:20:41] we we can actually the struggles we go
[1:20:44] through the personal
[1:20:45] things that we have to push through
[1:20:48] it's an opportunity you know it can
[1:20:50] actually it can actually
[1:20:52] better us and and you know produce
[1:20:55] something good
[1:20:55] in our lives so rather than a dreary
[1:20:59] something that we walk through you know
[1:21:00] like the personal battles
[1:21:02] it's actually it can produce something
[1:21:04] good in our lives
[1:21:05] and and uh just to close off
[1:21:09] i just want to say um you know it's
[1:21:11] going to be worth it all
[1:21:12] you know you know every time you've got
[1:21:15] a
[1:21:16] yeah it's going to be worth it'll win
[1:21:18] i'm sure once we get to the other side
[1:21:20] it's um we'll be able to see things a
[1:21:21] bit more clearly and
[1:21:23] and yeah we'll be we'll be thankful that
[1:21:25] the lord took us through all of it so
[1:21:28] and um yeah i'll keep it short and sweet
[1:21:33] [Applause]
[1:21:40] simon
[1:21:43] amen should we sing that it will be
[1:21:45] worth it
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:55] it all
[1:21:58] when we see jesus
[1:22:06] life's triumphs we'll
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:36] so let us run the race it
[1:22:52] will be worth it all
[1:22:59] when we see jesus
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:09] will seem so small
[1:23:12] [Music]

[1:25:46] i will delight myself in thy statutes i
[1:25:48] will not forget thy word
[1:25:50] amen this is partially something that i
[1:25:54] spoke about a couple of weeks
[1:25:56] um you don't have to turn the isaiah
[1:25:57] chapter 26 verse 3 that will keep him
[1:25:59] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:26:02] thee because he trusteth in thee
[1:26:03] i mean you can take your seats
[1:26:07] now we are we're the most privileged
[1:26:10] people on the face of the earth
[1:26:12] we're gathered here in an atmosphere
[1:26:15] a special atmosphere that's why we see
[1:26:17] deliverance that's why we see victory
[1:26:19] while we see you know we come together
[1:26:21] and we're so happy
[1:26:22] is because we create an atmosphere and
[1:26:25] when you come you bring your lick of
[1:26:26] fire and all together
[1:26:28] it it produces a blazing fire you know
[1:26:30] the law just you know
[1:26:32] is able to work here because of the
[1:26:34] atmosphere that we produce
[1:26:36] and i want to i want to encourage you to
[1:26:39] stay
[1:26:39] in the right atmosphere this atmosphere
[1:26:42] that we have with us we can take it with
[1:26:44] us when we go back to our daily lives
[1:26:46] we don't have to let it go we don't have
[1:26:49] to slum back into what we were before
[1:26:51] and get it back into the same rut
[1:26:53] we can take that atmosphere with us and
[1:26:57] the way to do that is like david is
[1:26:58] saying here in this in the scripture
[1:27:01] keep him before your face when you go go
[1:27:03] back to your work go back to uni back to
[1:27:05] college to school
[1:27:06] wherever you go don't forget about the
[1:27:08] things you heard this weekend
[1:27:09] keep it before your face think about it
[1:27:12] meditate on the word
[1:27:13] stay in fellowship with jesus christ
[1:27:15] because when you stay in an atmosphere
[1:27:17] satan is powerless against you when you
[1:27:19] stay in that right atmosphere
[1:27:21] and uh excuse me david is saying here
[1:27:24] you know he delights himself
[1:27:26] in the lord is god you can you can just
[1:27:28] look at his life and you can see the
[1:27:29] stuff that he went through manny
[1:27:31] you know he comes back to ziklag one day
[1:27:33] and it's it's
[1:27:34] burnt to the ground you know his family
[1:27:37] and everything is stolen
[1:27:38] and the men want to kill david like how
[1:27:40] much worse can it get
[1:27:41] and what did they would do he didn't
[1:27:43] panic and say oh lord what am i going to
[1:27:45] do now
[1:27:46] he delighted himself and the lord is god
[1:27:48] and that's when the lord came on the
[1:27:49] scene
[1:27:50] like you know i believe it's paul and
[1:27:51] silas when they were stuck in their
[1:27:53] prison
[1:27:53] they delighted themselves in the lord
[1:27:55] they started singing they started
[1:27:57] worshiping
[1:27:58] and that atmosphere caused the whole
[1:28:00] prison to be shaken around them
[1:28:02] you can create an atmosphere in your
[1:28:04] life that can set people free
[1:28:06] around you the brothers and sisters in
[1:28:08] your life you young people if you go
[1:28:10] back to your churches and you create
[1:28:11] that atmosphere
[1:28:13] take that fire with you you can be the
[1:28:15] medium that god uses
[1:28:16] to deliver another person and i want to
[1:28:20] encourage you to
[1:28:21] relax and let the holy spirit have its
[1:28:23] way brother brahman speaks about
[1:28:25] you know that welsh revival that
[1:28:26] policeman that you know he was he was
[1:28:28] the revival
[1:28:30] and brother brahman says if you could
[1:28:31] ask him one thing what what what do you
[1:28:33] need to do
[1:28:34] to get into this revival he would say
[1:28:36] relax and let the holy spirit have its
[1:28:38] way
[1:28:38] relax and let the holy spirit have its
[1:28:40] way because when you can do that the
[1:28:42] lord will work through you the secret to
[1:28:44] the supernatural is to relax
[1:28:46] amen so we don't have to try and make
[1:28:49] everything up you know we don't have to
[1:28:50] try and strive and make the word come to
[1:28:53] pass that's not our job
[1:28:55] that's god's promise it's his job to
[1:28:57] bring his word to fulfillment in our
[1:28:58] lives
[1:28:59] amen and um something mother andy said
[1:29:02] last week as well it was a
[1:29:04] real blessing that service by andy um
[1:29:07] based on a tongue's interpretation was
[1:29:10] given to one of the messages is
[1:29:11] your victory lies between faith and joy
[1:29:15] and that is that is so powerful because
[1:29:18] the faith
[1:29:19] lying in your victory lying in faith
[1:29:21] that comes
[1:29:22] by resting in jesus christ you just
[1:29:25] believe
[1:29:26] god's promise you believe his word and
[1:29:28] he brings it to pass in your life
[1:29:30] and joy be happy like brother third he
[1:29:32] was saying you say
[1:29:33] be happy you know when you know when
[1:29:35] everything just comes against you know
[1:29:37] people
[1:29:38] your friends are you know angry at you
[1:29:39] or you know you go back to work and the
[1:29:41] boss says oh you've
[1:29:42] messed up you know just be happy be
[1:29:45] happy don't let that steal your joy
[1:29:46] because when the devil steals your joy
[1:29:48] you'll lose your victory because the
[1:29:51] bible says
[1:29:52] the joy of the lord is your strength so
[1:29:54] you just hang on to that joy
[1:29:56] be happy praise the lord i want to read
[1:29:59] a quote here i haven't got it up
[1:30:00] on the um on the powerpoint but uh
[1:30:04] it's a long long long-ish quote and uh
[1:30:06] in the message he swore by himself
[1:30:09] brother muhammad says listen i'm going
[1:30:10] to say something this is one of my
[1:30:12] favorite quotes this is so amazing
[1:30:14] look faith is unconscious amen you
[1:30:17] believe it
[1:30:18] i've learned that in the years of travel
[1:30:20] around the world and meeting the peoples
[1:30:22] of all different walks
[1:30:23] faith is unconscious you've got faith
[1:30:26] and you don't even know it that's right
[1:30:28] jesus christ no matter if he was in a
[1:30:30] storm and the gale is knocking the boat
[1:30:32] from one side to the other
[1:30:33] or he was standing in a face in a mess
[1:30:35] of demons if he was hanging anywhere
[1:30:37] it never moved him he walked right on
[1:30:40] just as calm and quiet as he could be
[1:30:42] why
[1:30:42] he was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:30:44] anything around him that's right
[1:30:46] whether it was going to happen or
[1:30:48] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[1:30:49] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:30:51] god said so
[1:30:52] he didn't say have i prayed through i
[1:30:54] wonder if i fasted long enough
[1:30:56] wonder if i did this he just walked
[1:30:58] right on unconscious that's right
[1:31:00] he believed what god said was truth the
[1:31:03] words
[1:31:04] must be fulfilled and he know that his
[1:31:06] life was to fulfill them
[1:31:08] amen and we've got a prophecy that's
[1:31:10] spoken over us
[1:31:11] and our part is to fulfill that that
[1:31:14] there's going to be a bride you know
[1:31:15] that's without spot or wrinkle
[1:31:17] and you're here to fulfill it too just
[1:31:19] walk unconscious of fear
[1:31:20] walk unconscious of criticism walk
[1:31:23] unconscious unto the world
[1:31:24] walk as you walk in christ walk with him
[1:31:28] not paying any attention the right or
[1:31:30] the left hand just keep moving on
[1:31:32] if something comes up in the church walk
[1:31:34] with god hallelujah if sickness strikes
[1:31:36] you
[1:31:36] walk with god if the neighbor doesn't
[1:31:38] like you walk with god
[1:31:40] just keep on walking with god just stay
[1:31:42] in that atmosphere amen
[1:31:44] enoch one day walked like that you know
[1:31:46] what he done he walked
[1:31:47] all the way home with god got so far up
[1:31:50] the road he didn't want to come back
[1:31:52] anymore
[1:31:52] amen walk with god doctor says you're
[1:31:55] going to die
[1:31:56] walk with god doctor says you can't well
[1:31:58] walk with god just walk with god that's
[1:32:00] all
[1:32:01] for god has promised you i'll never
[1:32:02] leave you or forsake you
[1:32:04] i'll never i'll be with you to the end
[1:32:06] of the world
[1:32:07] and he took an oath by that covenant
[1:32:09] that he give you that he would confirm
[1:32:11] it
[1:32:12] just walk with god then you'll have your
[1:32:14] ups and downs don't worry you got to go
[1:32:16] through briar patches over sharp rocks
[1:32:18] over bluffs down over hillsides up
[1:32:20] through the mountains over waters
[1:32:22] by walk with god yes sir there's so many
[1:32:25] hills to climb upward you've heard the
[1:32:27] old song but how little it'll seem
[1:32:29] when you get to the end of the way amen

[1:38:19] also i want to say
[1:38:20] thank you for the amazing attitude you
[1:38:23] had
[1:38:24] it was just absolutely precious from
[1:38:27] that first
[1:38:28] time we got together on saturday just a
[1:38:31] lovely atmosphere i mean even on the
[1:38:33] you know in the sports center there the
[1:38:35] way that you treated one another the way
[1:38:37] that you got involved in things
[1:38:39] i want to say i really salute you
[1:38:43] you wonderful wonderful young people
[1:38:46] and i want to and i want to encourage
[1:38:48] you and say
[1:38:49] continue like that we've had our theme
[1:38:52] scripture for the weekend behold
[1:38:54] our good and our pleasant it is for
[1:38:55] brethren to dwell together
[1:38:58] and and i've seen that happen this
[1:39:01] weekend and i thank god for that
[1:39:03] so i want to say as we go out different
[1:39:05] ways that you know you take that love
[1:39:08] back to your church homes but don't get
[1:39:11] in your own little silo
[1:39:13] you know don't get in your own little
[1:39:15] between four four walls and
[1:39:18] shut others out again you know you've
[1:39:21] made friendships hopefully
[1:39:23] and these friendships if the lord should
[1:39:25] tarry will go
[1:39:26] for years to come
[1:39:29] and it will be a blessing for years to
[1:39:31] come now there's something else brother
[1:39:34] apparently brother freddie said it
[1:39:35] recently i'm i'm told right so if i'm
[1:39:37] wrong please forgive me
[1:39:39] but you know you look at one another as
[1:39:43] brothers and sisters
[1:39:46] but there's going to be a point as we
[1:39:47] heard over the weekend it's okay
[1:39:49] to look at one another it's more than
[1:39:51] just brothers and sisters okay
[1:39:53] we need wives and husbands too
[1:39:58] so there's friendships that's
[1:40:00] established and out of friendships
[1:40:02] also the lord gets relationships and and
[1:40:05] marriages
[1:40:06] but also god raises up you know there
[1:40:09] might be a brother in this church and
[1:40:11] another brother in another church that's
[1:40:13] going to be
[1:40:13] both ministers one day and perhaps
[1:40:15] pastors one day and so forth
[1:40:17] and what we want is we want the walls
[1:40:19] broken down
[1:40:20] so that we can be one so that we can you
[1:40:22] know walk all in the same direction pull
[1:40:25] in the same direction encourage one
[1:40:26] another and so forth

[1:42:48] or four months we'll start seeing
[1:42:50] christmas
[1:42:50] advertisements coming again and
[1:42:54] you know one of the themes that people
[1:42:56] put on and and really it's a whole
[1:42:57] commercial trick but
[1:42:59] it's the season of giving but that's not
[1:43:01] what i want to speak about i want to
[1:43:02] speak about the season of giving
[1:43:04] for a christian and i want to read this
[1:43:07] opening scripture wherefore
[1:43:08] if meat make my brother to offend i will
[1:43:11] eat no flesh while the world stand at
[1:43:13] lest i make my brother too fiend
[1:43:15] so what paul is writing here is he's
[1:43:17] saying that there's
[1:43:19] that there's certain things that my
[1:43:21] brother is sensitive about you know in
[1:43:23] that
[1:43:23] in that specific chapter paul speaks
[1:43:26] about you know how
[1:43:27] some person is their conscience is is
[1:43:30] more
[1:43:30] uh sensitive on a specific thing and so
[1:43:33] forth and paul is saying
[1:43:34] for the sake of my brother i won't do
[1:43:37] certain things
[1:43:38] not to offend for the sake of my sister
[1:43:40] i won't do certain things
[1:43:41] not to offend and
[1:43:45] that is a sacrifice because
[1:43:48] you know we have liberty we are set free
[1:43:52] you know we are set free like like um
[1:43:55] even when you know in the old testament
[1:43:57] um god gave laws about you know what
[1:43:59] they were allowed to eat and what not
[1:44:01] and so forth but then
[1:44:02] in the new testament god showed that
[1:44:05] dream to peter
[1:44:06] and and said you know showed him that
[1:44:09] don't call uh unclean what god has made
[1:44:11] clean and so forth and
[1:44:13] and paul writes about you know even even
[1:44:15] meat that's been offered to idols
[1:44:18] now how many of us if someone gives you
[1:44:20] a plate of food and they tell you this
[1:44:22] meat has been offered to idols
[1:44:24] you would feel really awkward about
[1:44:25] eating it right
[1:44:28] but the reality is i mean what's the
[1:44:31] idol it's a dead thing
[1:44:32] it's nothing right but if the if your
[1:44:35] conscience bother you
[1:44:36] then don't do it because your conscience
[1:44:38] then makes it you can't eat it in faith
[1:44:40] right so so that's the principle is that
[1:44:44] when someone's conscience is weak about
[1:44:46] something
[1:44:47] then we accommodate them and we and we
[1:44:49] do certain things and we live in a
[1:44:51] specific way
[1:44:52] that we can be a blessing to them
[1:44:55] and that is what i'm speaking about
[1:44:57] giving
[1:44:59] now we're living in the low dc age where
[1:45:03] everything is about self what i can get
[1:45:05] what i can gather what i can
[1:45:07] you know what makes me feel good what
[1:45:09] and betters me and
[1:45:11] don't care about the next person it's
[1:45:13] all about human rights
[1:45:15] but really every person's problem is my
[1:45:18] rights i don't care about anyone else's
[1:45:20] rights i want my rights i want what's
[1:45:21] good for me i want what's going to
[1:45:22] benefit me
[1:45:25] but now let's just let's just take it to
[1:45:27] the christmas story and i hope this
[1:45:28] doesn't defend anyone
[1:45:30] you know i i find that in the message
[1:45:32] people get so afraid when you speak
[1:45:33] about christmas
[1:45:35] right and i was listening over the last
[1:45:37] few weeks two or three messages that
[1:45:39] brother branham
[1:45:40] preached at the end of 1958 around the
[1:45:42] time of christmas and he
[1:45:44] says the biggest present that this world
[1:45:46] ever got the biggest gift that this
[1:45:48] world ever got was christ
[1:45:52] and the problem with what we do
[1:45:53] commercially in christmas today we take
[1:45:55] all the focus away from it
[1:45:56] right and we know christmas you know the
[1:45:58] 25th of december wasn't the birth of
[1:46:00] christ and so forth we know those things
[1:46:02] but hey
[1:46:03] relax don't get uptight about this now
[1:46:06] the principle is god gave the biggest
[1:46:09] gift that he could ever give
[1:46:11] you personally
[1:46:14] the biggest gift he could give you was
[1:46:17] to give his life
[1:46:18] a ransom for yours and mine
[1:46:21] right when we could not do anything
[1:46:24] to come back to christ when man had
[1:46:27] fallen
[1:46:28] when there was a gap when there was a
[1:46:30] gulf where there was an incrossable
[1:46:32] big gulf god came and he crossed that
[1:46:36] gulf for us
[1:46:38] and he gave everything
[1:46:42] for you and for me and we love to be the
[1:46:46] recipients of that gift
[1:46:49] we love to be the recipients we love the
[1:46:52] freedom
[1:46:53] we love the the benefits
[1:46:56] we love the power that god has released
[1:46:59] to his bride to his church because of
[1:47:01] the gift that he gave us
[1:47:03] the price that he paid
[1:47:07] but there was a season in which
[1:47:11] each one of us received christ
[1:47:15] received the benefits and and we still
[1:47:17] permanently
[1:47:18] every day we depended on the benefits of
[1:47:21] what the cross paid for
[1:47:22] right but there's a season in which you
[1:47:26] and i
[1:47:26] must give out also
[1:47:30] we're so quick to receive we're so quick
[1:47:32] to gather everything we can to ourselves
[1:47:35] you know have you ever seen a bunch of
[1:47:36] kids and kids in a lolly scramble
[1:47:39] you know it's like oh these are mine
[1:47:41] these are mine stay away you know that
[1:47:43] kind of thing
[1:47:44] everything for me but what about the
[1:47:45] next person
[1:47:48] we're so quick to gather we're so quick
[1:47:49] to grab everything we can
[1:47:53] but if no one is going to give
[1:47:57] where is the world ever going to see
[1:47:58] christ
[1:48:01] if no one is going to give when is your
[1:48:03] friend sitting next to you in church
[1:48:04] today ever going to see christ
[1:48:09] the bible speaks about that story of the
[1:48:11] man that was forgiven so much and then
[1:48:13] he turned around and he's
[1:48:15] you know his fellow man owed him a
[1:48:18] little bit
[1:48:19] compared to what he had been you know he
[1:48:22] he's his big guilt that was taken away
[1:48:25] the little bit that that person owed him
[1:48:26] he didn't want to forgive him that
[1:48:29] and the result was the king said i think
[1:48:31] it was the king that said
[1:48:32] you know put him in prison and so forth
[1:48:34] until he pays all
[1:48:36] even in the lord's prayer it says help
[1:48:39] me to forgive others
[1:48:41] as i forgive my debtors sorry if you
[1:48:43] forgive my dad says i forgive as i
[1:48:46] forgive
[1:48:46] others you see the bible says
[1:48:50] we freely received but we should also
[1:48:53] freely give
[1:48:56] the gospel that we've received is not
[1:48:58] just for ourselves
[1:49:01] the reality is when we are filled with
[1:49:03] the holy spirit
[1:49:05] the whole purpose of god giving you and
[1:49:07] me the holy spirit
[1:49:09] is to be a blessing to others is to put
[1:49:12] you in use for his church
[1:49:14] is to use the gifts that if he's placed
[1:49:17] in your life
[1:49:18] for others and sometimes it means that
[1:49:22] you suffer
[1:49:24] sometimes it means that you go through
[1:49:26] hard times
[1:49:29] because people don't always want to
[1:49:30] receive what you have
[1:49:32] people sometimes people can really
[1:49:35] really hurt you when you're actually
[1:49:37] trying to do good to them
[1:49:40] and the more needful people are the more
[1:49:42] hurtful they become
[1:49:45] and it takes god's grace to look beyond
[1:49:48] that
[1:49:49] attitude and see the need in that
[1:49:51] person's heart
[1:49:54] you see we sing about god he looked
[1:49:56] beyond my faults and saw my knee but
[1:49:58] what about us
[1:50:00] now it's our season of giving can we
[1:50:02] look beyond
[1:50:03] the faults of the next person and see
[1:50:05] the need in their heart
[1:50:07] can we look beyond that can we try and
[1:50:10] pull others up instead of
[1:50:11] pushing them down so that we can be
[1:50:13] lifted higher
[1:50:15] you know you see that so often in the
[1:50:16] workplace in the corporate environment
[1:50:18] i've seen that heaps
[1:50:19] i've seen how people just back bite and
[1:50:21] cut one another i've seen i worked for a
[1:50:23] company
[1:50:24] where in the company there was like five
[1:50:26] or six different business units
[1:50:28] and they set it up deliberately that the
[1:50:30] business units competed with each other
[1:50:33] in order to get the biggest bonuses well
[1:50:36] what a mess because they were just
[1:50:39] they they would even like do things that
[1:50:42] that would
[1:50:43] um you know be negative to the company
[1:50:46] where they would talk bad to the
[1:50:47] customers against the other business
[1:50:49] units and stuff like that
[1:50:50] so that their business unit can look
[1:50:52] better and it
[1:50:54] in the end it doesn't benefit the
[1:50:55] company and it's the same we see among
[1:50:57] christians
[1:50:58] if you are honest with yourselves
[1:51:00] brothers and sisters how many times
[1:51:02] have you pointed out the the faults and
[1:51:05] the failures in others
[1:51:07] to take away the attention from the fact
[1:51:08] that you were battling
[1:51:10] how often but god's way is for us to
[1:51:14] reach out to others to help others
[1:51:18] god's way is for us to lift others up to
[1:51:21] the bible speaks about how we prefer one
[1:51:23] another
[1:51:24] in other words let the other one get the
[1:51:26] better deal
[1:51:27] it's the other one sometimes you can do
[1:51:30] something and someone else walks away
[1:51:31] with the glory
[1:51:32] and then we can blow up like a big
[1:51:34] bullfrog eight buckshot as brother
[1:51:36] branham said
[1:51:36] you know but but so what
[1:51:40] god sees it i know it's humanly speaking
[1:51:43] it's not easy and emotionally speaking
[1:51:45] you know it can be tough for those
[1:51:46] things
[1:51:47] people can be unfair and so on
[1:51:50] but i want to say give the best to
[1:51:52] others give the benefit to others
[1:51:56] something else i want to say is god
[1:51:58] doesn't waste
[1:52:00] pain now write this in your hearts as
[1:52:04] deep as you can god never wastes pain
[1:52:09] if god allows pain through you know
[1:52:12] several of the brothers even this
[1:52:14] morning has spoken about how god
[1:52:16] allows trials and testings and things
[1:52:18] like that brother marion
[1:52:20] are finished with that so beautifully
[1:52:22] when we ask for peace god sends trials
[1:52:24] and tribulations
[1:52:26] why well there's two purposes
[1:52:29] one is god forms your character with it
[1:52:32] god changes your life god shows you how
[1:52:35] much you need him and so forth and you
[1:52:38] you draw closer to him but the second
[1:52:41] thing is when god allows you and me to
[1:52:43] go through
[1:52:44] things what happens is when the next
[1:52:46] person goes through it next time
[1:52:48] then you can be a blessing to them then
[1:52:50] you can really put yourself in their
[1:52:52] shoes
[1:52:55] i want to make the statement though and
[1:52:58] that is that most people
[1:52:59] are not willing to actually put
[1:53:00] themselves in other people's shoes
[1:53:03] most people are just not interested in
[1:53:06] seeing the other person's side of things
[1:53:08] they just want what's good for them what
[1:53:11] they can get out of it
[1:53:13] but it's the season of giving
[1:53:16] and i i i want to nearly say it this way
[1:53:20] that when you are baptized with the holy
[1:53:22] ghost
[1:53:23] when you are filled with the holy ghost
[1:53:25] that's your season of giving
[1:53:28] that's when god wants to take the gifts
[1:53:30] in your life
[1:53:32] and not lift you up but be a blessing to
[1:53:35] the next person
[1:53:37] if you've got a gift of singing if
[1:53:38] you've got a gift of cooking if you've
[1:53:40] got a gift of loving if you've got a
[1:53:42] gift of
[1:53:43] being friendly if you've got a gift of
[1:53:46] preaching whatever it is
[1:53:48] god wants to use the gift in your life
[1:53:51] to be a blessing to others
[1:53:53] not to lift you up it's clear the
[1:53:56] biblical principle is
[1:53:58] if we want to be going up we're going to
[1:54:01] need to go down
[1:54:03] humble yourselves before the lord be as
[1:54:06] little as you can brother braham says it
[1:54:08] over and over be as little as you can
[1:54:09] that literally you can get god will lift
[1:54:11] you up in his time
[1:54:14] amen but give the best to others render
[1:54:16] your gifts for others to benefit from it
[1:54:20] so i want to make these things just a
[1:54:21] little more practical so you can kind of
[1:54:23] relate to it and and
[1:54:24] and i'm sure you've all seen this stuff
[1:54:27] right
[1:54:28] you get one one person they finish
[1:54:31] primary school i don't know what you
[1:54:32] call them here
[1:54:33] is primary school primary school finish
[1:54:36] primary school
[1:54:37] and they go to intermediate right so
[1:54:40] they are intermediate now
[1:54:41] now their best friend is still in
[1:54:44] primary school
[1:54:46] three months older than them but they
[1:54:47] just you know fell in the next year
[1:54:50] and now suddenly they say i can't be a
[1:54:53] friend anymore because i'm in the
[1:54:54] intermediate school
[1:54:56] right have you ever experienced that
[1:54:58] kind of stuff i mean you get it in
[1:55:00] different
[1:55:00] in all sorts of walks of life right
[1:55:04] and then suddenly i am the big one now
[1:55:06] i'm better than you no
[1:55:07] that's the time to draw that one up to
[1:55:10] encourage
[1:55:11] that one and say just hang on just one
[1:55:13] year and you're with me
[1:55:14] and then we can continue let's stay
[1:55:16] friends and let's make that person feel
[1:55:18] like they're important
[1:55:20] living for others a season of giving
[1:55:23] because we so want to feel that we're
[1:55:26] the big one and the thing is the reality
[1:55:28] is
[1:55:29] i found out in life and i'll give you
[1:55:30] that from my own perspective
[1:55:32] you get to in south africa we had
[1:55:35] standard five which is the you know the
[1:55:37] last year of primary school and you the
[1:55:39] guy
[1:55:40] you know you think you've arrived and
[1:55:42] all these little baby you know
[1:55:44] little ones and then the next year you
[1:55:46] go to high school
[1:55:47] he doesn't have intermediate schools and
[1:55:49] then you the baby again
[1:55:51] and all you want to be is the matric the
[1:55:53] you know the standard 10 guy the oldest
[1:55:55] ones in high school you want
[1:55:57] you want to be like them because you
[1:55:58] know that's the place you want to arrive
[1:56:00] at
[1:56:01] and when you get there then you kind of
[1:56:03] think you you're the business and the
[1:56:05] next year you go to college or varsity
[1:56:07] or
[1:56:07] or apprenticeship or whatever it is and
[1:56:09] again you nothing
[1:56:12] and then you go and study and then you
[1:56:14] know by your you finish your studies and
[1:56:16] you think
[1:56:17] i have arrived i'm going to conquer the
[1:56:20] world
[1:56:20] i know it all and you walk into the
[1:56:23] workplace
[1:56:24] and you're the rookie you're the nothing
[1:56:27] again
[1:56:28] right and then you think oh my if i can
[1:56:31] just have that position you know
[1:56:33] and the reality is we never arrive
[1:56:36] okay but we can make the walk for each
[1:56:40] other so much
[1:56:41] easier by pulling each other up
[1:56:47] by reaching out to others but is it easy
[1:56:50] to say it but can you do that
[1:56:54] instead of saying i have this you don't
[1:56:56] have it yet so i'm better than you
[1:56:58] rather encourage that person draw them
[1:57:01] in with you
[1:57:02] pull them up with you take them on board
[1:57:07] right i'm going to say something that
[1:57:10] brother steve brisson is
[1:57:11] has made this comment and it's stuck
[1:57:13] with me
[1:57:15] he says the christian army
[1:57:18] is the only army that kills the wounded
[1:57:22] soldiers because they are embarrassed of
[1:57:25] them
[1:57:27] now listen to this someone is struggling
[1:57:31] spiritually
[1:57:32] we cut them off because it makes the
[1:57:35] church look bad or it makes the family
[1:57:37] look bad or
[1:57:38] come on that's a soldier that's a
[1:57:42] brother
[1:57:43] that's a sister right let's reach out to
[1:57:47] each other let's encourage let's take
[1:57:49] hands
[1:57:50] write our theme scripture for the
[1:57:51] weekend was how good and pleasant it is
[1:57:53] for brethren to dwell together and of
[1:57:55] course it goes for sister in too
[1:57:57] okay right but the thing is
[1:58:01] before we even look outside our own
[1:58:03] church boundaries
[1:58:04] if if i want to use that term look at
[1:58:07] your closest friend
[1:58:10] are you really encouraging them are you
[1:58:13] really helping them or you're just
[1:58:14] cutting them down and
[1:58:15] undermining them and making life as hard
[1:58:17] as possible for them and
[1:58:19] you know jealous of each other and all
[1:58:21] sorts of rubbish like that
[1:58:22] who's that helping it's not helping you
[1:58:24] and it's not helping them
[1:58:26] and it's actually working against the
[1:58:28] kingdom of god
[1:58:30] but let's enter by god's grace a season
[1:58:33] of giving
[1:58:35] will you sacrifice yourself will you
[1:58:37] humble yourself
[1:58:39] and i'm going to say this to you
[1:58:40] brothers and sisters and i want you to
[1:58:43] listen to this
[1:58:44] and remember it because human beings are
[1:58:47] wired this way
[1:58:50] the more insecure you are in yourself
[1:58:53] the more you want to feel important and
[1:58:55] you want to lift yourself
[1:58:56] up but the more confident and secure
[1:58:59] someone is in their position in god
[1:59:02] the more you can humble yourself and you
[1:59:04] don't need to try to be nothing
[1:59:07] so when someone is trying to put you
[1:59:08] down realize
[1:59:10] they've got the problem not you
[1:59:14] they are the one that's insecure and
[1:59:17] pray for them
[1:59:18] don't get angry at them when they put
[1:59:20] you down pray for them because they are
[1:59:23] the needy one
[1:59:25] amen i trust something was said that
[1:59:27] that you can take with you but let's as
[1:59:30] we go away from you let's look at
[1:59:32] others knees before our own
[1:59:35] i can't remember which of the brothers
[1:59:36] said it over the weekend as soon as we
[1:59:38] start fig
[1:59:39] focusing on other people's needs our own
[1:59:42] needs just
[1:59:44] you know smooth out so much easier
[1:59:46] because we're not staring at our need
[1:59:48] all the time
[1:59:50] amen god bless you richly and
[1:59:53] let's stay in touch i think i sent a
[1:59:56] notification out this morning
[1:59:58] please load up some photos on that on
[2:00:00] that google photo thing
[2:00:02] and um keep on sharing but remember we
[2:00:05] won the bride is one
[2:00:07] okay let's not just go each one to our
[2:00:10] own corner and then
[2:00:12] you know the auckland church is better
[2:00:14] than the stratfor church or the wanganui
[2:00:17] church is better than the wellington
[2:00:18] church or
[2:00:19] i mean come on what rubbish is that it's
[2:00:21] not a competition we body
[2:00:23] okay we won we want to draw closer we
[2:00:27] want to lift each other up
[2:00:29] let's rather say if we're in the stretch
[2:00:30] for church yeah the auckland church is
[2:00:32] way better
[2:00:33] praise god but we want to be like them
[2:00:36] my dream is to be able to song lead like
[2:00:38] brother tazewell
[2:00:40] amen praise god
[2:00:43] but let the lord like brother stephen
[2:00:45] said this morning let god use each one
[2:00:47] of us how he's made us we're all
[2:00:49] different
[2:00:51] last thought um i just was
[2:00:54] thinking of that when i think it was
[2:00:56] when brother joseph was ministering this
[2:00:57] morning
[2:00:58] brother greg alford he uh he coined the
[2:01:00] phrase that i really enjoyed
[2:01:02] and each one of us have a unique
[2:01:04] thumbprint
[2:01:06] okay and with god each one of us
[2:01:11] is someone special so
[2:01:14] brother greg he he coined this this
[2:01:17] phrase
[2:01:18] he said you're a thumb body with god
[2:01:21] right
[2:01:21] each one of you are a somebody with god
[2:01:24] so as you go away this weekend remember
[2:01:26] i am a thumb body with god
[2:01:28] like that song they sang this morning
[2:01:30] you know god ran to you
[2:01:33] you know all of us reach a point in our
[2:01:35] lives where we're a prodigal son
[2:01:37] we're a prodigal daughter but god loves
[2:01:40] you
[2:01:41] whether you feel his love right now or
[2:01:43] not he loves you
[2:01:46] whether you whether you want to believe
[2:01:48] that or now or not whether you're going
[2:01:50] through hard trials
[2:01:51] god loves you and you're a somebody with
[2:01:53] god
[2:01:55] i wonder if we can stand together
[2:02:00] wow look at that 2 minutes to 12.
