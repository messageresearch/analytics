the throne [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] the throne [Music] so [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah it just seems that the lord has a theme this morning on his heart because things have been just aligning in a specific way and just trust that we my god's grace can end in what he has for us this morning i'd like to welcome each and every one back in the house of the lord this morning it's been a week and a half since we've been here in the building together i mean we've had a wonderful weekend last weekend and i trust that that he's still on a high from that but we we certainly missed wednesday night and i want to say welcome back i wonder if i could just ask you to take your seats just for a moment um i just don't want to keep you standing but i won't be long um firstly i would like to do also welcome our visitors brother dazzle and sister laverne and the young ones it's a privilege to have you real special privilege that you uh that you come down i always always marvel that we had to come to new zealand to meet you here but you know the lord has his ways and the lord has his plans and lord has every one of those things under his control so we just thank the lord for that um also thank you very much for that song item it's always always special to have you do a song item and you would let us down if you didn't do it amen god bless you and then just a reminder that god willing will have a general prayer meeting again on friday for those who can make it over lunchtime so 12 o'clock here on on friday so anyone interested to come you're welcome to do that then you would you would probably notice and and if you haven't i'll tell you now that brother brother joseph has spent a good portion of the week here and uh brother jonathan also um quite a few hours here to support them and got some late nights and probably robbed the families in their sleep patterns a little bit but they've put in a lot of effort to redo the sound in the church and just clean things up in in so many ways and just um i'm really excited about the changes and although they will be slightly marginal they'll they um you know in some ways if you're you've got to train yeah you'll probably appreciate it more than i do but certainly the sound is a lot crisper and and cleaner than it was and that's exciting and also the brother joseph has set it up that it's that it's got stereo sound now and just for that little bit more complete sound and so on so but the reason why i'm saying that is so if there's a few hiccups here and there please just be with us and and you know if it's if it's um hurting your ears or anything just let joseph know i'm sure he's gonna he's gonna appreciate that right um you know and the reason i'm saying that is that that the system is generally a little more towards the treble side now than it was um and and in order to get the sound a lot cleaner so maybe our ears are just not used to the treble so we'll see how that goes and then also these um we we had the working be a couple weeks ago and got a ton of things done um but there's still quite a few things that needs to be done around the church and we're running out of good weather season very soon so i want to say if there's any brothers that that has time during the day during the week to to help with a few things i would really appreciate that if you can just make contact with me if you if you are willing and have the time to help so it's not not all fun jobs but it's jobs that need to be done nonetheless and it would be nice if we can get those things sorted out so i appreciate that yes i think that's what we have for this morning so now it's my privilege to uh to introduce brother dazzle we'll we won't get him upright yet but really excited to have her brother here this morning and and just just looking forward we had a lovely youth meeting on friday night and i made a bunch of notes and and really got inspired to perhaps use the some of the principles in a service in the next week or two we'll see how the lord leads but really enjoyed it and i can really highly highly recommend some of those thoughts so let's stand together and take your needs to the lord this morning amen if you have a need on your heart you can express it to the lord our most wonderful savior lord we just was reminded of that miracle father the miracle that you're doing in hearts lord o god we will be eternally thankful to you father hallelujah father for your for your plan for your eternal purpose lord for for predestination lord jesus her father and for the price that you paid to make make it all possible father oh lord jesus just hearing this week again how your prophet says that who's who's greater the sickness or the healer who's greater the sin or the savior and you allowed sin to be there to show your attribute of savior father you allowed sickness to be there so that you can show your attributes of healer father lord jesus and we we are in need in many of your attributes this morning and this morning father we want to ask you lord that you will express yourself lord exactly according to our needs father lord jesus to each individual father if we need peace i pray for peace lord i lord jesus if we need wisdom i pray for wisdom father if whatever we need lord i pray that you will provide it lord father you see every heart well jesus you see the battle that each one has been through this week father lord jesus you know the mountaintops that we're on you know the valleys we're in father you know all those things father so we just want to lay it at your feet this morning father i pray that you will answer lord i also now ask father that you'll give us grace to put all the things of the weak aside father that we can focus on your word and that we can hear from you what you want to say to us father lord jesus give us open hearts lord father i pray that you will forgive us all our weaknesses and faults and failures father and that every channel will be opened lord jesus so that we can get the maximum benefit out of this morning lord jesus i pray for each one of us from from the youngest to the oldest lord i pray that you will have your way lord i also lift brother tazowa before you again pray that you will use that vessel for your glory father lord jesus let the trumpet sound forth lord father we thank you we ask it in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen i mean let's sing one more song as we call our brother up um this is listing number 61 but let's just sing the first and the last verse there is a fountain there is [Music] is [Music] lose all their guilty [Music] is [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] let's just pray this morning father we thank you for the song lord jesus not just empty words but father we can identify with the reality of god of such a song loving father father we are just so appreciative for that reality to know father that we are recipients and that we have and we are experiencing your amazing grace forgiveness of sin law and lord that you come our way and you know sometimes we just human like i think it's david that says in the book of psalms lord that we are but flesh but oh father that you come away and you help us you forgive us you strengthen us so god you build us up we're just so thankful for that warning that you would hide me behind that old rugged cross father all we want to see this morning is jesus christ so have your way lord as nervous as i am father i just pray that you just use me this morning in the mighty way father you know the burden that you've placed on my heart i prayed this morning that you would release the burden over us your people lord god i'm always so conscious of the fact that lord when i stand here lord god it's not me speaking to the people or god i'm looking at but father it's you speaking to all of us so help us in jesus name we pray amen my name and god bless you this morning if you just may take your seats just for a few moments and then we'll go into the scriptures um i just want to say thank you musicians god richly bless you i just want to get a bit settled this morning but god richly bless one and all for those that don't know me i know you god bless you for the press for those that don't know me i'm my name is stazwell and i live out in cambridge and my father-in-law freddie um he's the pastor of the local assembly that i go to i just want to say thank you pastor already for allowing me to be here this morning i don't see myself much of a a minister or a preacher but i have a burden for the people of god and i know where the lord has brought me from and i just especially young people and i just want to see how you know i want to if i could press this word into all of us you know i would do that but i believe that you know we each have to have our own personal experience with god but brother already thank you so much for the opportunity and sister pillar thank you for the hospitality i really enjoyed myself for the past few days my family myself and to the young people i want to say thank you for being gracious to me and to listen to my illustration of a stick the young people all know what i'm talking about i um i just spoke to them on on friday and my title was a stick i mean it was so beautiful that i could meet i mean some young people that i've never i mean i probably would have seen them but never so close and uh um i actually wrote the name down here i think it's judah harvey where is he chew the harvey you know i was really so touched when you came with your ukulele and just started playing there god which bless you continue playing for jesus amen and then we went over to brother elder's home and we just started singing and uh man that song that esther and amy that they sang i believe they sang it at the camp man it's just so beautiful and uh i just want you to know you've got a wonderful group of young people you do and young people just continue to serve god give him your everything he is how everything he is our all in all just you know give yourself over to him and uh but mana and bethany uh joseph and ben you know you don't realize sometimes just the simple conversations and it does so much to us i mean i had the opportunity to ride in the tesla and you know what scared me was when mother was driving and then he went around the bed and he took his hands off the steering wheel i said whoa my goodness yeah thank you for that and then it was it was really scary and then he still asked me if i wanted to drive and i said absolutely not and then phil and rachel it was so nice sitting there in the entertainment area um just you know i just love i love just having friends and believers of like precious faith and which is so wonderful i believe you know we encourage each other and uh so yeah god richly bless you and as i looked around yeah you you see there are people sitting here this morning ministers of the gospel that obviously would be able to preach much better or even present whatever the lord has laid in my heart in a much better way than i can but i just trust that the lord will just lead the service this morning so god richly bless you and as we just stand to our feet i've got the three uh portions of scripture that i'd like to read and it's um it's very well known scriptures and uh i will see how the lord will just lead it and it's just a burden that's within me and i trust that i want to release that this morning malachi 4 chapter 5 chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 in its uh majority of us um should be able to just quote it off by heart i remember growing up back in south africa and my mom and dad asked me what is malachi 4 5 and 6 i would be able to just you know quote it off by a heart because this pertains to you and to me i'll just read it it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse as i read that i said lord thank you for this message of grace of perfection of adoption there's another scripture i'd like to just read it's found in the book of philippians um philippians chapter three i think philippians chapter four just a few verses there um i'll read 13 14 and i love verse 15 verse 13 if you have it it says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus and i like verse 15 it says let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded but i like the second part it says and if in anything you be otherwise minded maybe you don't see it the way the word has presented it to you the scripture says that god shall reveal even this unto you i when i read that portion of scripture i see the grace of god extended to me i i read the scripture i don't see any judgmental stuff there i say paul say you know what if you don't see things my way it's okay god will come your way and he will reveal it to you i love that and then the lost scripture is a very well-known scripture uh first thessalonians chapter 4 and then we can pray and take our seeds this morning first thessalonians verse 4 um i'll read from verse 15 it says for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words lord jesus your word has been read this morning and father we are totally dependent upon you lord so we just pray that you lead and we want to follow you this morning meet every need i don't know the needs of god in the house this morning in the sanctuary father but you know the need i pray father that you would meet the individual need this morning is my prayer in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you may be seated this morning in the presence of almighty god i've i've let me just read quotations i'd like to read before i go into the thought this morning and i like i like brother brandon when i when i as i listen to sermons of brother branham i love the practicalities of things that i see and it makes me realize that you know this this walk that we're walking is this this message that we're following it's it's it's not a complicated message um and i say that because i grew up uh and maybe a few many of you might know my my testimony but i i grew up thinking that this is a complicated message i grew up you know wanting to sound complicated because the more complicated i sounded the more you know uh intelligent i thought i was that the more you know uh spiritual um i thought i was but um i've come to realize you know as you i believe as we mature in christ and this message is a message that is maturing us thank you brother already and i realize as you mature that it's a it's a god in simplicity and i think you know if you look at brother brandon when he when he went to preach the seals he started out with god in simplicity and i believe i think it was late on in albuquerque new mexico he preached god in simplicity so it is god in simplicity so young people i want you to grasp the fact that this is not a complicated message it's a message that can come down to your seat all you have to do is you need to say lord i receive you i want you and i want more of you so i just want to read some real practical things this morning and then we'll we'll go into into the thought in the the message presuming brother branham he's reached the end of the service and he says while we have our heads bound he says i want to ask a real honest question to be answered and then he goes on a bit further and he starts talking to the church and he says i want you to be honest and then he says if but sean's you haven't been following the word of god maybe you just rejecting this and not doing that or not what whatever the word says you you disobedient but the brandon says i want you to be honest and then further on down he he says god bless you and he's talking to the church god bless you he says god bless you and you and you and you and you he says god bless you that's fine and then he says be honest and then he says god bless you lady so he he says god bless you god but then he starts zeroing in on somebody and he says god bless you lady god bless you and he says praise god i see you i seen a woman healed he says right then sick sitting right there and then brother branham says cause she raised the hand he says she was honest and he says she got healed now this woman came into the meeting and she allowed the word of god not the person standing here and saying things but she allowed the word of god to have an impact on her and she heard the prophet say be honest if maybe you've done things you've said things you've hurt somebody be honest raise your hands seek forgiveness and brother branham then identified this woman came in sick she was honest with herself she was honest with god and god respected the honesty that he came her way and brother branham says she was honest she got healed so simple things but god sees it and it can have major impacts in our lives another practicality in the message led by the spirited brother branham says i believe it was a few nights ago here somewhere else that he says it was a crippled woman i believe that was in jamaica that she was sitting there and she gave a place respects to a woman that had heart trouble now brother branham says he was in jamaica ministering and there was probably a prayer line and there was probably uh you know how brother brangham ordered the line and he says there was this human in the meeting and she was a crippled woman and she was standing in her position in the prayer line but brother branham says this woman she seen someone else now i don't know whether she knew that this other woman had uh brother branham says a heart condition or heart trouble but what she did brother branham says she would probably went to the human and said you come and take my place brother brandon said the woman that was crippled she had respects to someone else and the woman came where the heart trouble came and took her place but brother branham says this she gave her place respects to a woman that had heart trouble her place to stand at the line brother branham says and because she did that the holy spirit came back around and healed her and she was outside of the line but because she showed something as simple as respect god seen that simple practical application and he was so pleased with it that he came by and he healed that crippled woman but the branham says that's it he says love and show respects to one another i know this is very simple but i believe it's in these simple things that god can do wonderful and amazing things in our lives because we have to grow and we want to grow in grace just the last script uh quote what was the holy ghost given for can i take off my jacket further please thank you what was the holy ghost given for um brother branham says here um david said he would come into the congregation of the saints and make his request known so brother branham is praying a prayer and he says and tonight there has been many hands perhaps maybe i would say 80 percent of those that are sitting in this building tonight raise their hands for requests and he says lord it shows that we just can't go without you i believe this meeting here this morning it's it's it will be a waste of time if he wasn't leading guiding and directing and that is why as i stand here this morning i said lord i am so totally dependent upon you lord brother branham says lord we just can't go without you we've got to have you day by day you are our life our joy our health our sustaining strength i'll shield from the enemies and believers the you can identify i don't have to tell you this you know the enemy is off to you you know you see it you experience it he wants to destroy you because you you've got something great you've got something special and brother branham says oh god you are a shield i'll shield my shield from the enemy i teach my family i say we don't take a step outside our door without praying whether we're going to school in the morning we pray when we come back and my wife and myself maybe we decide we gonna go to the store we stand together and we pray when i go fetch my kids in the afternoon we stand and we pray because we realize the importance of prayer we realize the importance of having jesus christ always before us he says and we could not fight this battle of life this is a battle for life he says and we just could not fight this battle of life without you it would be totally impossible for us to do it now if there's anybody here this morning and especially the young people if you struggling as a christian as a message believer and you're sitting in this meeting and you realizing the reason i am struggling is because i want to do things on my own i am not asking god i am not praying i am not committing my studies i am not committing my life i am not committing things to god i want to do it on my own and that's why i'm struggling i want to encourage you this morning please the lord always before you this is a battle for life and it is not a struggle this work that we're walking it's not not a struggle and i want you if you if you ever thought that walking this this walk of perfection is a struggle i want you to know it is not a struggle yes it might be hard but when i look at i see it as a battle and in this battle i know who is the victor and it's like i think it's i think it's the book of nehemiah and ezra where they building the and the bible who talk how they uh stone in one hand balding sword in the other hand ready to fight and that should be our attitude if you look and if you take note of things that's happening around us there are so much things and it's so subtle there are many things happening but i want to encourage you invest in jesus christ therein is your strength bearing is my strength this morning i i've got a little thought and i don't always know if i'll be able because i've got a problem sometimes i give a title and i never really align myself to the title but we'll see how the lord lives but this morning i i want to impress upon your hearts this morning this is my title the title is that this message is urgent when you leave this place i want you to walk with an attitude of this message is an urgent message it's an urgent message for me and i must take notes of what god is telling me in the message um and i'm gonna sort of just glide over some quotes this morning if you will allow me the message of the second coming brother branham says he reads a scripture out of saint luke 15 1518 which talks about um the woman that had lost a coin piece of silver and she did a house cleaning and when she founded she called to others and said come and rejoice with me for i have found this lost coin but brother brandon picks up on that and he says in the message the second coming of the lord he says now that may seem like a very odd scripture for the coming of christ he says but it's speaking of the second coming of christ and this great subject that we have here before us now he says one of the most vital subjects in the entire holy writ he says there's nothing so important as the coming of the lord and the lord impressed this on my heart a couple of weeks ago i was actually um listening i've got a friend in south africa and i was just listening to one of his sermons and and as he was preaching it really hit home to me that this the coming of the lord is so important and i had to come and do a self-examination and i had to ask myself as in this walk that you are walking you are facing so many challenges there's so many things that's happening in your life and you are fighting the devil this way and you fighting the devil that way and you getting victory over this and you getting victory over that but says is your focus store the catching away is your focus stole on the coming of the lord it was a question that i had to ask myself because we find many times we get so we get so caught up with the things of life we get so caught up with the challenges that we face on a daily basis and we thank almighty god for what he's doing in our lives we see what he's doing we we see how he's lifting us up and we see how he's giving us victory over this devil and over that devil but is our main focus on the coming of the lord he says there's nothing so important as the coming of the lord jesus christ for if he does not come we have been found false witnesses our dead that's in the grave are perished and there is no hope left for us if jesus doesn't come visibly the second time it must be a very important subject and i i read that and i said yes brother branham but i want to take that further and say lord it's not just a very important subject it's an event that i am excited about and i am contending for in things that ought to be but the brandon talks about the coming of the lord he says he says i look daily for him like to ask myself tess is that your attitude is that your approach i look daily for him keeping myself prepared for that hour you see we need to be prepared we need to be in a specific condition and brother brandon in god's provided day he says we should know how to tell the people to prepare for this great event that's coming he says if the coming of the lord is so great it's the most essential thing that we can do is to get the people prepared for it it is so important that we need to be prepared and i am grateful and i am thankful to almighty god that i know what is preparing me and i'll read it to you brother branham says now we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture so young people brothers and sisters when we talk about being in the message it's not just a buzzword not just some another organized religion but this message has come my way and has come your way with a purpose and it's come to get us ready i see it in my life the more i submit myself to god i see it and then when i sing that song the things i used to do i do them no more it's because i see how he's taken me and he's maturing me maturing me and helping me to get rid of this and get rid of that and get rid of pride and get rid of arrogance and all those sorts of things he's getting me and you ready and in the right condition because we need to be in the right condition it's important brother brennan talks he gives a testimony um in the messenger testimony upon the sea he says i want to ask you do you believe see that picture over there that that pillar of fire that's on the picture you've seen it now he says now i've seen that since i was a little boy it's all down through the records the first time that was ever taken the canadian newspaper packed it 31 years ago across the whole province of canada it said a mystic light appears over a minister while baptizing in the river now the branham talks he says and as i was baptizing my 17th person he said i said heavenly father and i was a young baptist preacher and i said heavenly father i can only baptize him with water unto the fellowship of this church but i pray that you baptize him with the holy spirit and i said that and something said look up so brother branham is baptizing his 17th person and he's praying and he hears someone tell him look up he says i heard it a third time look up and i turned and looked and a great raw shook around over the crowd and here come that light mulling itself down and stood right over me where i was standing and the voice came from it and said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second coming of christ believers how we should appreciate this message i read things like this and i say lord thank you lord there are so many christians out there and i mix with them on a daily basis but father you've come my way you've sent a prophet a vindicated prophet regardless of what people say i told the church now the other day i am totally sold out to this message totally sold out amen and it's not because of some intellectual thing it's because this message is a life to me amen it's personal it's doing things and i am seeing it doing things in my life and if you're sitting here this morning and you haven't experienced the life of this message you can experience it i want to encourage you don't give up seek the lord say lord i've been in this message for so long but i don't really see the things happening oh i'm critical say lord i need you and he will come this message i was telling you i think he was told the church if it wasn't for the grace of god today i would be sitting in a nazarene church not knowing and experiencing this depth of the word that i am experiencing our being brother mathen my mom comes out of a nazarene church in my under the testimony of how the message came our way is that my my son of my family was religious some were not but i had an uncle that was searching for truth and brother harold beckett had put an ad in the paper in cape town with regards to spoken words and god allowed my uncle to pick up the paper and to read and to be attracted to this advertisement and he wrote in to this people and a couple of days later but i have a becket came to knock on his door and he received life and with the life that he received he could pass it on to his brother my other uncle and then from my other uncle it went to my mom and to the rest of the siblings and then it went to my dad infiltrated our home and yeah i stand today a product of this precious message of grace don't i tell people this don't underestimate don't don't don't this message is serious this message is urgent and this message has been sent the scripture says by the bruce behold i send you elijah the prophet it's personal to me and i'm thankful i'm so sorry i just can't help but i just get so enthused i it's because it's so real to me it's i want to read something and i hope it's okay it's out of soldier or in prison um sort of just in line with with what brother branham's testimony of your message will forerun the second coming of christ young people get into the message dig into it read read the spoken words my brother-in-law right now is a associate minister in in london he came he came to our my my father-in-law's home a michael jackson fanatic and he came each into that home with all his michael jackson cds and all those sort of things and then one day he says he picked up this book as the eagle stir of her nest and he says he read this brother paul and he couldn't stop crying and he started seeing himself in what he was reading because he realized that he was an eagle and then god transformed his life today he's a minister out in the uk and a very very good friend of mine sold it on prison now somewhere close to the end of the meeting it says here a brother speaks in another tongue and another brother gives an interpretation so i'm going to read it and i hope it's okay it says so somebody in the meeting of brother branham he had just preached souls that are in prison now and he's coming to the end of the meeting and somebody rises up and speaks in an unknown tongue and then another person rises up and gives an interpretation and they noted down the interpretation in this message souls that are in prison a brother speaks in another tongue another brother gives an interpretation my children today i say unto thee yea even i the almighty god has looked upon the earth today i have seen the evil that this creation has been brought to yea i see the sin that man this day is walling within yea dost thou not know that i have done a great thing for thee yea i have sent forth a man in this last day yea that he might be a mouthpiece unto this generation but i say unto thee this day my my people many have scoffed at this name yea they have turned their backs upon the things that he has spoke but i say unto thee those that shall hear these words i shall cause great blessings to fall upon them i am the almighty god i shall reward this day for those that shall sincerely receive these words and i say lord i shall surely receive the word of god with all of my heart you know i i find out many times we especially i i've come across message believers but a lot of times young people that's walking under the confines under the banner of the message but they walk at times like someone that is totally bound not realizing that there is greatness within them wanting to push out brother branham talks in this message he says i remember one time when i was at the zoo in cincinnati you know the quotes i'm reading a lot of you know about this already he says that i was looking at an eagle that had just been captured it was one of the most pitiful sights i have ever seen this great heavenly bird had been knitted and captured by someone and thrown into a cage that poor fellow was so out of place this eagle born to be free born to fly and to saw the heights of the world brother branham says that poor fellow was so out of place and many times i look at some believers and you can see that they feel so out of place when they're walking around with an attitude of despair because they know that there is something within and they are hey they should be able to break out brothers is that poor fellow was so out of place that he would jump with all his might against the big bars flapping his wings only to find himself back on his back as i continued watching him you'd walk proudly back and forth because he's an eagle and then with all his might throw himself against the bars only to fall back again the branham says he is a heavenly bird his whole makeup is to love in the blue not down yeah in the barnyard scratching with chickens he says then to see a bird like that that's made to soar in the blue just laying there brother branham says what a beautiful sight it is and then he takes it and he brings it down to you and me he says man was not made to be bound man is made to be free so i want to talk to the eagles that's here this morning you are not bound don't listen to the enemy trying to tell you that you are nothing that you not in the message that you can't really uphold the standards of this word the grace of god is available to you you are an ego and you can fly and you can saw the heights of this word you can walk as an overcomer when you're walking down the streets of stratford after today maybe yesterday or this morning you came to church and you walked the streets of stratford all depressed and all bound with this cage all around you after today you can walk out of here free because brother branham taught us he said house of hell give way to the name of jesus and each one of us we have access to the name of jesus it is a name that sets the captive free if you're struggling with your children or struggling with this or struggling with that just try it use the name of jesus christ i remember one time i was about to minister and i fell asleep uh just like the night before uh i was i was under the atmosphere and uh i went to sleep and uh i i felt demons coming to attack me in my sleep and it just it was just so eerie all around me in my dream and uh i remember standing there and i'm feeling this evil and this tearing all these things around me but i remember in my dream i screamed out i said get away in the name of jesus christ and then i i watched and it looked like nothing was happening but i stood firm and i believed and after a while that darkness and that gloom it just moved away because there is power in the name of jesus this message is urgent this message has been sent your way and this word of god it provides you and me with opportunities opportunities of growth opportunities for deliverance opportunities where you as a parent in your home can speak life over your son and over your daughter you can speak deliverance this message it provides opportunities and i want to read you just two quotations from the messaging i want to close off shortly from the message the presence of god unrecognized now brother branham says when he is not recognized his power is not always revealed when he is not recognized now i believe this morning but the brandon makes a statement he says the spirit follows the word i believe the word of god is being preached this morning and i believe with all my heart that right now we are in the presence of the great king of kings and lord of lords father branham says no matter how much god is standing present you've got to believe so as you're sitting here this morning and maybe you cannot really master the faith sit here this morning and say lord help me i want to be conscious of your presence lord i i don't want to walk out here and say that i am guilty of the presence of god unrecognized lord i want to know that you are here and it's not about feelings but you just know that he's here it's more than just an emotional thing right i've been through all of those things i've been through all of the emotional work-ups and you know you you come and you come and work up the people and they get all emotionally stirred but empty so don't get emotionally brother branham does say emotion gets you to the altar so i'm not pushing the motion aside but don't let that be the deciding factor you've got to know by faith that he's here and he's willing to meet with you you've got to believe it brother branham says like the woman with a blood issue he says all them people passing by and all of them standing up saying there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a prophet this is the fanatic and all such is that but brother branham says what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was recognize him this morning and she said if i can only touch his garment and when that genuine faith in god became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her so she needed to touch him by faith so that his power of healing could be released to her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her others standing there might have been sicker than she but you see she recognized his presence and she knowed that this was her opportunity so she seen that there was an opportunity for her and she grabbed it with both hands before i go to the next quote i hope it's okay i want to just give a testimony about my wife in 2018 or just before that my wife was going she had some sickness some thing that was bothering her and she had gone to the doctors and then the doctors had told us he needed surgery for certain things and they had booked the surgery for january sometime in january in december i think it was december mid-december just before christmas we had some meetings and there was a prayer line and my wife normally would be working in the kitchen but this night the kitchen just closed because there was so there was so much food they didn't need to work in the kitchen that night so my wife could come and be in the meeting and the prayer line was called and the brothers we stood one side this side was like a line where people would walk through and my wife says she came into the prayer line and she says lord you know what i'm facing lord i'm here for my healing and she said she came through the prayer line and she felt a wholeness just flow through her was standing here at the end of the prayer line as she came through and she passed me she collapsed on the floor and then the sisters were helping her after the meetings we went home my wife believed we went home the condition was still there a couple of weeks just before the operation my wife just felt in the heart that the lord had told her that she needs to cancel the operation date and she went by faith and she cancelled the operation date and life went on she the date of the operation came she still had the condition life went on from january to february to march april still the condition may june july still the condition august september september my wife's life changed after a while she realized hey something's different and when she went to examine and realize the condition that had been plaguing her was gone that was 2019. we're in 2021 and my wife sits here a testimony of what god is able to do now i'm not telling you that you must go and throw your medicine away or you must go cancel your appointments god spoke to her i didn't even tell her to do it all i did was i encouraged her and said lord laven you believe and you have faith but she had to do because she knew that god had told her what to do and she's sitting here this morning a living she used the opportunity i'm gonna read one two more quotes in there we're done the musicians you can come and you can just play something beautiful i don't know if you know that song touching jesus is all that matters or whatever song the lord lays on your heart um in the message the presence of god and recognized again brother branham talks about the woman that came to wash his feet he says talking about her he says i can just imagine seeing her standing there and her big pretty eyes all stained up now as i'm reading this i want you to receive the fact that our lord jesus christ is able to meet your need now with its sickness or whether you need to grow in grace because remember i said this message is urgent and there is a rapture and we have to get out of this place and this message is getting us into condition but the venom says and she had greece and dust of the road on her face she thinks now have i done wrong have i done wrong and he said unto her your sins which are many are all forgiven go in peace some of the very identifies what happened there he says what was it [Music] she recognized her opportunity now your opportunity might be presented to you right now [Music] and you can recognize it and you can be like that lady that i opened the service with that all she did she didn't come to the front and i'm not advocating that you come to the front if you want to come but i believe it's according to your faith and this lady that we read earlier all she did she raised her hands and she was honest with god and he healed her he met her need now you might not have a need for healing this morning you might have a need for deliverance for something whatever that is and there's a diverse range of things that we need deliverance from he can be that he can help you just use the opportunity [Music] she recognized the opportunity she did him a service the pharisees didn't do it she saw it she recognized his presence and what did he do she recognized his presence now what is so beautiful about it's more than just recognizing his presence because there are benefits that comes with [Music] recognizing father branham says and what did it do [Music] brother branham says it washed what did it release to her brother branham says forgiveness that was what she needed released to her forgiveness of her sins it also released the power of god to show to them unbelievers that he was a prophet he knowed who she was and to her it released joy and power and eternal life and all she did was she recognized him she did him a service she washed his feet [Music] closer for this and the branham says i believe he screams out hurry hurry the message [Music] is urgent i believe this morning i've i just felt i feel the presence of god and i know that the lord has

wrong direction brother branham says harry this message is calling you up it's calling you higher he says hurry escape run for your life get out of it he says can't you feel something tugging at your heart so as is if he wants you to raise your hands raise your hands and say lord i need you i need you father i need you in my life lord i'm so sick and tired of of the things that i find myself doing
