[1:03:01] speaking to you tonight here in your
[1:03:02] assembly in your church first time we've
[1:03:04] been here in the church with you all we
[1:03:06] were with you a few years ago there in
[1:03:08] the Family Camp before Co hit and
[1:03:10] changed the world Amen so we thank the
[1:03:12] Lord for allowing our path to cross
[1:03:14] again and to be here with you all
[1:03:15] tonight amen in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:03:19] 15 and verse number one Paul here
[1:03:22] writing he says moreover brethren I
[1:03:25] declare unto you the gospel which I
[1:03:28] preached unto you which also you have
[1:03:31] received and wherein you stand by which
[1:03:34] also ye are saved if you keep in memory
[1:03:37] what I preached unto you unless you have
[1:03:40] believed in vain now watch this for I
[1:03:43] delivered unto you first of all that
[1:03:45] which I also received how that Christ
[1:03:48] died for our sins and I want you to
[1:03:50] watch how he died according to the
[1:03:53] scriptures verse number four
[1:03:56] and that he was buried and that he rose
[1:03:58] again the third day again there it is
[1:04:01] according to the scripture so he was
[1:04:05] born he lived he died he was buried and
[1:04:08] he raised and it was all according to
[1:04:11] the scripture now in the book of St Luke
[1:04:14] the 24th chapter it's a very very
[1:04:16] familiar reading uh brother Bram will
[1:04:19] use this many times in the sermons of
[1:04:21] the Resurrection or he'll take a thought
[1:04:23] when their eyes were open they knew him
[1:04:25] in St Luke 24 and verse
[1:04:28] 32 amen St Luke 24 uh rather verse 29
[1:04:34] let's begin at verse
[1:04:35] 29 but they constrained him saying abide
[1:04:39] with us for it is toward evening and the
[1:04:41] day is far spent and he went in to Terry
[1:04:44] with him and it came to pass as he sat
[1:04:47] at meat with him he took bread and
[1:04:49] blessed it and break it and gave it to
[1:04:52] them and their eyes were opened and they
[1:04:55] knew him and he vanished now notice this
[1:04:59] he vanished out of their sight and they
[1:05:01] said one to another did not our hearts
[1:05:04] burn within us while he talked with us
[1:05:07] by the way and while he opened to us the
[1:05:11] scriptures brother BR says whenever
[1:05:13] Jesus appears the first thing he does is
[1:05:16] he goes straight to the scripture so
[1:05:19] here he took the time to identify
[1:05:21] himself in his resurrection but he did
[1:05:23] it according to the scripture now we
[1:05:26] believe that he is our bridegroom right
[1:05:29] so we believe that he lived according to
[1:05:31] the scripture he rose according to the
[1:05:32] scripture now if the scripture speaks of
[1:05:35] the bridegroom it must also speak of the
[1:05:37] Bride so in St John chapter 14 St John
[1:05:40] chapter 14 and verse number
[1:05:44] 19 Jesus here speaking brother Bram
[1:05:47] again will pick this up and it is the
[1:05:48] rising of the sun he says now yet a
[1:05:51] little while and the world will seeth me
[1:05:54] no more but ye see me because I live ye
[1:05:59] shall live also we ask the Lord this
[1:06:03] evening to add the blessing to the
[1:06:04] reading of his word as you can have your
[1:06:05] seats here uh this evening I want to by
[1:06:08] the help of the Lord for just a few
[1:06:09] moments if I could to take a a thought
[1:06:12] out of those passages of scripture if I
[1:06:14] would title this tonight I want to talk
[1:06:16] to you for a few moments on walking in
[1:06:18] the precious light of his resurrection
[1:06:21] amen walking in the precious light of
[1:06:23] his resurrection 1958 brother B preaches
[1:06:26] a very powerful sermon he calls it I
[1:06:28] know my redeemer liveth and I just want
[1:06:30] to read here a portion of the prayer
[1:06:33] from that sermon he said now dear God we
[1:06:35] are grateful this morning to be the
[1:06:37] people that is called by thy name how
[1:06:39] many is grateful to be called by his
[1:06:41] name he said we're so glad that we do
[1:06:43] not have to just imagine any more of a
[1:06:46] great resurrection that is to come see
[1:06:48] because it's become a reality to us as
[1:06:52] we read it in thy word see thou Hast
[1:06:55] promised this and filled it within our
[1:06:57] souls That Jesus Lives oh we are
[1:07:00] thinking this morning of the many
[1:07:02] heartaches that's been in life and the
[1:07:04] many sadnesses that we went through the
[1:07:06] experience that has torn us and thrown
[1:07:08] us to The Winds of the Earth how we
[1:07:10] buried our loved ones how we mourned at
[1:07:12] the grave he said our souls seem to
[1:07:14] almost perish within us he said but then
[1:07:17] we can think of today he said oh what it
[1:07:20] means that Jesus raised from the dead he
[1:07:23] spoiled every Power of the enemy enemy
[1:07:25] when he rose up triumphant he took all
[1:07:28] the Shadows away I want you to catch
[1:07:30] this and now we walk in the precious
[1:07:33] light of his resurrection now I find it
[1:07:36] amazing that brother bradam is not
[1:07:38] putting these things in the future amen
[1:07:40] that someday we're going to walk in the
[1:07:43] light of his resurrection he said but as
[1:07:45] we're reading the word of God he said
[1:07:47] the resurrection is becoming a reality
[1:07:50] to us and we are now walking in the
[1:07:53] precious light of his resurrection again
[1:07:56] he says I know my redeemer liveth and at
[1:07:58] the last day he will stand upon on the
[1:08:00] earth and though after the skin worms
[1:08:01] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:08:04] I see God he said now job seen the
[1:08:07] resurrection would be brought about by a
[1:08:09] man someday and the sin question would
[1:08:12] be settled when that righteous one the
[1:08:13] Son of God came to die for Sinners he
[1:08:17] said now there was no man on Earth at
[1:08:19] that time or no man sense that could
[1:08:21] ever Bridge the way between a holy God
[1:08:25] and a sinful man he said but job here
[1:08:27] 4,000 years before his coming he saw his
[1:08:31] death his burial and his resurrection
[1:08:34] and his justification that come by the
[1:08:36] resurrection now I love this and the
[1:08:39] absolute guarantee of the resurrection
[1:08:41] of the believer what a comfort it is to
[1:08:44] know that those things are not are true
[1:08:46] amen it's not a fiction story now think
[1:08:49] about that that job actually saw amen
[1:08:52] that there was a resurrection that would
[1:08:54] come by a man but he also saw that that
[1:08:57] Resurrection would have an influence
[1:08:59] upon the Believers amen who would
[1:09:01] believe in the one who brought the power
[1:09:03] of Resurrection among the church now you
[1:09:05] all know that the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:09:08] amen it is the birth it is the life the
[1:09:10] death amen and the burial and
[1:09:13] resurrection of our Lord and Savior
[1:09:15] Jesus Christ I want to say tonight that
[1:09:17] there is no other gospel amen the
[1:09:20] prophet of God said if there is another
[1:09:22] gospel Paul spoke to one of the groups
[1:09:24] he said I'm so surprised rised amen that
[1:09:26] you would turn to another gospel he said
[1:09:29] which there is no other but a make
[1:09:31] belief gospel Amen to a denominational
[1:09:34] fiction amen a turning from the good
[1:09:37] news but then Jesus says because I live
[1:09:40] ye live also amen and I live in you and
[1:09:43] the works that I do amen the works I do
[1:09:46] will identify myself in you what a
[1:09:48] message see no wonder we've had a dark
[1:09:51] world of theology amen but in the
[1:09:53] evening time there shall come light
[1:09:56] again see now watch a prophet there will
[1:09:58] be a resurrection in the evening time so
[1:10:01] there was not just a resurrection
[1:10:04] prophesied amen or promised to come in
[1:10:06] the morning amen but there was
[1:10:08] prophesied to be a resurrection in the
[1:10:10] evening time he said see what a
[1:10:12] resurrection that that was amen but what
[1:10:16] a resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:10:19] from the
[1:10:20] dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus
[1:10:24] amen by God God's quickening power see
[1:10:27] he was waved to them the word which he
[1:10:29] was amen was waved back to them on the
[1:10:32] day of Pentecost what was it it was the
[1:10:35] word made manifest now I'll say this the
[1:10:38] word of God that is being waved in this
[1:10:40] generation amen it is not a fiction amen
[1:10:43] but it is a reality and the reason we
[1:10:46] can declare it's a reality is by the
[1:10:48] fruit amen that it bears in the life of
[1:10:51] those who believe it he said now this is
[1:10:53] not a fiction this is the B
[1:10:55] it's God's truth it's his promise he
[1:10:58] said I have tried it I have tested it
[1:11:00] and I know amen that you can take God's
[1:11:02] word and he will make it right with you
[1:11:05] amen he will bring it to pass amen so
[1:11:08] the word of God is the absolute to the
[1:11:10] life of every believer brother B tell us
[1:11:13] what an absolute is he says it is
[1:11:15] perfect in itself amen it is Unlimited
[1:11:18] in its power it is primarily an ultimate
[1:11:21] see it's Unlimited in its power it is
[1:11:24] perfect
[1:11:25] in itself he says and it really is an
[1:11:29] ultimate now another place therefore I
[1:11:31] think everybody amen should have an
[1:11:33] ultimate how many believes every life
[1:11:35] has got to have an absolute he said see
[1:11:37] you cannot go through life amen without
[1:11:40] having an absolute now when brother B
[1:11:42] uses that word the absolute guarantee of
[1:11:44] the believer we know what an absolute is
[1:11:47] but I took the time Amen to look up what
[1:11:49] a guarantee is in the in the in the
[1:11:52] definition the word guarantee it is a
[1:11:54] formal promise or Assurance amen that is
[1:11:57] typically in writing amen that certain
[1:12:00] conditions will be fulfilled it is
[1:12:03] something amen that gives a certainty of
[1:12:06] an outcome so when you have a guarantee
[1:12:09] you have something in writing amen that
[1:12:12] is giving you an assurance in your soul
[1:12:15] amen that there's going to be an outcome
[1:12:17] to the situation now amen sometimes I
[1:12:20] amen I just have to I'm just a simple
[1:12:22] country boy okay so sometimes I have to
[1:12:24] break things down in ways that I can
[1:12:27] understand it I was preaching one time
[1:12:28] on this word outcome you know and I just
[1:12:30] got to thinking and you can look up the
[1:12:32] definition of the word outcome and
[1:12:34] there's a lot of there's a lot of
[1:12:35] different meanings of it amen but if you
[1:12:37] really want to know a simple definition
[1:12:39] of what outcome means amen just
[1:12:42] rearrange the way it's spelled amen from
[1:12:44] outcome and change it and it says come
[1:12:47] out so what it's saying is whatever that
[1:12:49] you're in you're coming out of see amen
[1:12:53] if you're in Le OA you're coming out of
[1:12:56] it here we find that there is an
[1:12:58] absolute guarantee to the believer and
[1:13:00] I'll say the only one that I know of is
[1:13:02] the revealed word of God Amen that has
[1:13:05] been brought to us through a Vindicated
[1:13:07] Prophet that was written in the Bible
[1:13:09] and has been interpreted to us Amen in
[1:13:12] the message of the hour let me say this
[1:13:15] what was written in the word has now
[1:13:17] been quickened in the flesh amen of the
[1:13:20] Believers of the hour of the age that
[1:13:22] we're living in I love what Paul says he
[1:13:24] says it's as much as you are manifestly
[1:13:26] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[1:13:28] ministered by us amen written not with
[1:13:31] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:13:34] God Amen not in tables of stone amen but
[1:13:37] in fleshly tables of the heart he said
[1:13:40] another place I will put my laws into
[1:13:42] their mind amen and I will write them
[1:13:45] into their hearts brother comes along
[1:13:48] and picks that up he said therefore the
[1:13:50] man's spirit is Blended out amen and God
[1:13:53] comes in and takes all over he said then
[1:13:56] they got Fellowship one with another
[1:13:58] listen and the Very God that created the
[1:14:01] heavens and the Earth amen that wrote
[1:14:04] his word amen is dwelling in you and you
[1:14:08] will believe it for everything that God
[1:14:10] wrote it to be The Truth Listen friends
[1:14:12] we are not reading Grandma's Almanac
[1:14:15] amen we're not reading a history book
[1:14:17] amen but the word of God has been wrote
[1:14:19] in this age amen it's been not wrote by
[1:14:22] education it's not been wrote by science
[1:14:25] or by by philosophy or theology amen but
[1:14:28] the word of God has been wrote by
[1:14:30] inspiration and the prophet of God said
[1:14:32] therefore the Bible is the word of
[1:14:35] God it is wrote by God himself amen
[1:14:39] through lips and instrumentality of man
[1:14:41] now listen God can write himself God can
[1:14:44] speak himself God can do what he wants
[1:14:46] to amen but he chose man to do it amen
[1:14:50] because that man that wrote it is a part
[1:14:52] of God listen when God chose zachar arah
[1:14:55] to write the word amen Zachariah was a
[1:14:58] part of God he said the man didn't even
[1:15:01] know what they were writing in their own
[1:15:03] human thinking see amen they might
[1:15:05] disagree with it amen but they wrote it
[1:15:08] anyhow see because men of old as they
[1:15:10] was moved by the Holy Ghost see God
[1:15:13] moved their hands God moved their eyes
[1:15:15] in Vision they could say nothing amen
[1:15:17] but what they were looking at see they
[1:15:19] could speak nothing because he had full
[1:15:22] control of their tongue their finger
[1:15:24] every organ their body was in full Sway
[1:15:27] With God no wonder the Bible said they
[1:15:29] were Gods amen because they were a part
[1:15:32] of God Amen he was the fullness of God
[1:15:35] let me just say this when those prophets
[1:15:37] were writing amen they were not writing
[1:15:40] about things they wanted to write about
[1:15:42] necessarily amen but they were writing
[1:15:44] prophecy amen of the coming of the
[1:15:46] Messiah which was our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:49] I love in St John 5:46 Jesus speaking he
[1:15:53] said for had you believe Moses
[1:15:55] amen ye would have believed me now watch
[1:15:57] what Jesus says he says see for Moses
[1:16:00] wrote of me look at this word write it
[1:16:03] means to describe to commit to writing
[1:16:06] it is used to things which stand written
[1:16:08] in the sacred books of the Old Testament
[1:16:11] amen by writing in a written epistle
[1:16:13] Amen to give information to give
[1:16:15] direction to make things so clear that
[1:16:18] when it comes to pass it will not be
[1:16:20] overlooked now think about this Jesus
[1:16:23] stands there and he said if in verse 47
[1:16:26] he said but if you believe not his
[1:16:28] writings amen then how shall you believe
[1:16:31] me so Moes Moses wrote about him coming
[1:16:34] amen but now Jesus stands there in the
[1:16:37] flesh of what Moses was writing and he
[1:16:39] said listen if you will not believe me
[1:16:42] you will not believe Moses amen because
[1:16:44] what Moses wrote is who I am listen
[1:16:47] Jesus was the
[1:16:49] manifestation amen of the prophet's
[1:16:51] prophecy he was the manifestation of the
[1:16:54] word of God listen the prophet of God
[1:16:56] said the baby born down there
[1:16:57] illegitimate birth in a cow stable how
[1:17:00] could that be this guy didn't go to any
[1:17:02] school he had no credentials he had no
[1:17:04] Fellowship card he didn't belong to any
[1:17:06] organization they didn't know what
[1:17:08] school he went to amen how could this be
[1:17:11] anything he said but it was amen they
[1:17:14] failed to see he said the works I do
[1:17:17] they testify me amen so search the
[1:17:20] scripture for in them you think you have
[1:17:22] eternal life and they are they that
[1:17:25] testify amen they tell you who I am I
[1:17:28] love what brother B says he said that
[1:17:30] Jesus looks at him and says the
[1:17:33] testimony of my life are the
[1:17:36] scriptures now think about that if you
[1:17:38] don't believe me amen then you won't
[1:17:40] believe the works I do now watch if you
[1:17:42] don't believe me amen rather believe the
[1:17:44] works I do for they tell you who I am
[1:17:47] they said now we have Moses we're just
[1:17:48] going to believe Moses he said well if
[1:17:50] you believe Moses amen you would believe
[1:17:53] me because he wrote of me I want you to
[1:17:56] catch what a prophet says he said they
[1:17:58] were so dark and still they couldn't see
[1:18:01] it now catch this he doesn't say Amen
[1:18:04] that it was so dark he said they was so
[1:18:07] dark that still they couldn't see it he
[1:18:10] said I wonder if that couldn't repeat
[1:18:13] amen it's prophesied to you know amen
[1:18:15] you say yes in this day oh yes so what
[1:18:18] Jesus was amen was he was the scriptural
[1:18:21] lot of the age in other words the
[1:18:24] prophets proph prophesied amen and the
[1:18:26] prophecy was brought to light in his age
[1:18:29] amen that had been prophesied for his
[1:18:31] age I love this quote he lit up every
[1:18:34] candle of word that was in the Bible and
[1:18:37] was prophesied of him listen a virgin
[1:18:39] shall conceive and she did amen his name
[1:18:43] Shall be Called counselor Prince of
[1:18:45] Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:18:47] father and he was amen and the eyes of
[1:18:50] the blind shall see he said and they did
[1:18:54] oh my so everything that was prophesied
[1:18:56] of him amen it happened when he come on
[1:19:00] the earth listen friends when he came on
[1:19:02] the earth he did not come as a book or
[1:19:05] as the writings Amen in in in script
[1:19:08] form he came as the flesh amen of the
[1:19:11] writings that was described in his
[1:19:13] arrival into the Earth let me just go
[1:19:15] ahead and say it amen there is a Bible
[1:19:17] that speaks of him but the same Bible
[1:19:20] that speaks of him amen also speaks of a
[1:19:22] bride who would come into this AG but
[1:19:25] she would not come by tradition she
[1:19:27] would not come by education she would
[1:19:29] not come by denomination she would come
[1:19:32] by the prophet's prophecy let me say
[1:19:34] this that bride is not coming that bride
[1:19:37] is here tonight and she's before me what
[1:19:40] the Bible spoke of an end time bride is
[1:19:43] before me tonight in
[1:19:46] flesh now I think that's a very powerful
[1:19:49] thing when you realize the scriptures
[1:19:51] cannot be broken amen but they must be
[1:19:53] fulfilled you know the the Bible says
[1:19:55] that heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:19:57] amen but Jesus said that my words amen
[1:20:00] shall not pass away brother said see
[1:20:03] God's word is so real he said now that's
[1:20:05] enough scripture right there to take all
[1:20:08] the communism out of the world and
[1:20:10] convert the entire world he said it's an
[1:20:13] invitation to Salvation he said it's
[1:20:16] also an invitation to Healing it's the
[1:20:19] guarantee of eternal life he said oh it
[1:20:22] means so much if it be received in the
[1:20:26] light that it's wrote in so when they
[1:20:28] were riding when Moses was writing of
[1:20:30] Jesus he was not writing in darkness he
[1:20:34] was riding in light and the light he was
[1:20:36] riding in was none other than the pillar
[1:20:38] of fire amen that is the original True
[1:20:41] Light let me just say it friends these
[1:20:43] lights we have here tonight they're very
[1:20:45] beautiful and we're very thankful for
[1:20:47] them amen but don't get in your mind
[1:20:49] that that's the kind of light amen that
[1:20:51] the Bible was wrote by amen that is
[1:20:53] artificial light amen but the kind of
[1:20:56] light the Bible was wrote by amen was by
[1:20:59] the pillar of fire which is the original
[1:21:01] light then the pro of God will say like
[1:21:03] this we are so thankful to be alive and
[1:21:06] to have this great revelation of eternal
[1:21:09] life that is dwelling within us he said
[1:21:12] we've come tonight father to study Thy
[1:21:14] word together these great Hidden
[1:21:16] Mysteries that's been hid since the
[1:21:18] foundation of the world and the lamb is
[1:21:21] the only one amen that can reveal it to
[1:21:23] us he said I pray he will come among us
[1:21:26] tonight and will take of his word and
[1:21:29] will reveal it to us that we might know
[1:21:31] how to be better servant to him Amen in
[1:21:34] this end time so when the lamb returns
[1:21:37] to the church he is not coming Amen to
[1:21:40] dark in the church the church was
[1:21:42] already dark he was coming to bring
[1:21:45] light upon the scripture that there
[1:21:47] might be an authority and a power in the
[1:21:49] flesh of every believer listen the Bible
[1:21:51] is full of promises amen we don't have
[1:21:53] time to preach on all the promises that
[1:21:56] are recorded in God's holy word but
[1:21:58] there are one of those formal promises
[1:22:00] or written guarantees however you want
[1:22:02] to say it amen that I'm very thankful
[1:22:05] for amen and that is the promise of
[1:22:08] light you know Zachariah said it shall
[1:22:11] come to pass in that day amen that the
[1:22:13] light shall not be clear nor dark amen
[1:22:15] but it shall be one day which shall be
[1:22:18] known to the Lord not day nor night
[1:22:21] listen but it shall come to pass amen
[1:22:23] that at the evening time it shall be
[1:22:26] light modern events are made clear by
[1:22:28] prophecy he said the evening light
[1:22:30] promised by the prophet of God so this
[1:22:33] is not any kind of
[1:22:35] light it was promised by the prophet of
[1:22:38] God in Zechariah 14:7 that it may again
[1:22:41] open the true believer's eyes Amen to
[1:22:44] the events that's taking place today
[1:22:46] amen that's proved by the prophecies
[1:22:49] that we are at the end time he said
[1:22:51] Jesus is coming another place but the
[1:22:54] proph said it shall be light again about
[1:22:56] the evening time the Sun s so n will
[1:22:58] peep out again it shall be light he said
[1:23:02] what the same s o n that was revealed in
[1:23:06] flesh at the morning time back there
[1:23:09] will be revealed again in the evening
[1:23:12] time listen the light does not change
[1:23:15] the only thing that changes is the flesh
[1:23:17] that is being revealed in in the morning
[1:23:20] time it was revealed in the flesh of
[1:23:23] Jesus Christ but in the evening time it
[1:23:25] has been prophesied to be revealed in
[1:23:28] the flesh of the redeemed blessing oh
[1:23:31] God to be revealed in the redeemed
[1:23:33] vessels of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:35] what is this evening light amen it is
[1:23:38] Revealing Light can I say this it is
[1:23:41] prophetic light now in Isaiah chapter 60
[1:23:44] verse1 you know these scriptures by
[1:23:46] heart he says arise and shine amen for
[1:23:49] thy light is come and the glory of the
[1:23:52] Lord is risen upon thee he said now for
[1:23:55] Behold The Darkness amen it shall cover
[1:23:57] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[1:24:00] amen but the Lord shall arise upon thee
[1:24:04] and His glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:24:07] brother B comes along in Shalom he says
[1:24:09] now good morning which means peace he
[1:24:12] said the darkness is gathering amen
[1:24:15] what's it gathering for to show the
[1:24:17] light see Isaiah 60:1 Rise and Shine the
[1:24:21] Light is come that's the reason I can
[1:24:23] say shalom
[1:24:24] amen the light has come to you God's
[1:24:27] peace to the elected woman to the
[1:24:29] elected lady those who God before the
[1:24:32] foundation of the world Amen called out
[1:24:35] and ordained to that listen look what
[1:24:38] Isaiah goes on to say he says and the
[1:24:40] Gentiles amen shall come to thy light
[1:24:44] now listen thy light has come and the
[1:24:47] Gentiles shall come to thy light and the
[1:24:50] Kings Amen to the brightness of thy
[1:24:53] Rising now I'll just say this I I
[1:24:55] remember a few years ago back home amen
[1:24:57] some people got to doing their DNA you
[1:24:59] know and they got to searching and and
[1:25:01] and and ancestry.com and all kinds of
[1:25:03] all kinds of DNA searches and if you're
[1:25:05] into that God bless you I have no
[1:25:07] problem with it but I I found some
[1:25:08] people that got into it and man they got
[1:25:10] so deep you know amen they found maybe
[1:25:13] maybe a percentage of a percentage of a
[1:25:15] percentage amen of Jewish or Israelite
[1:25:17] blood and all of a sudden brother all
[1:25:19] they were Moses or Elijah and they was
[1:25:22] Revelations 11 fulfillment they were
[1:25:24] going to go lay in the street you know
[1:25:26] amen but let me just let me don't don't
[1:25:28] get mad at me okay but let me just get
[1:25:30] it out there in the open we are
[1:25:34] Gentiles okay now listen if we try to be
[1:25:37] something else we're going to miss what
[1:25:39] God has promised to send us in the hour
[1:25:42] that we're living in and this Bible says
[1:25:44] that this light that was prophesied to
[1:25:46] come amen would come to the Gentiles
[1:25:49] first you say the Gentiles it went to
[1:25:51] the Jews and they rejected it God blind
[1:25:54] their eyes so that the Gentiles eyes
[1:25:56] could come open amen but when the
[1:25:58] Gentiles dispensation is over it will
[1:26:01] return to the Jews he said but right now
[1:26:04] the light is Vindicated again it's God's
[1:26:07] word amen so you can see God manifested
[1:26:10] in his promise of the light of the day
[1:26:13] or the word given to this age amen see
[1:26:15] the promises that's been made for this
[1:26:17] day these promises that was said by the
[1:26:20] prophets and by Jesus himself in this
[1:26:23] day Hebrews 1 in this last day through
[1:26:26] his son Jesus Christ so when Jesus
[1:26:29] Christ came on the earth he was neither
[1:26:32] Israel or or Jewish blood or Gentile
[1:26:34] blood
[1:26:35] right it was creative blood now watch
[1:26:39] what a prophet of God said he said Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ testified amen that he was the
[1:26:44] light that he was the True Light he said
[1:26:47] I am the light of the world he that
[1:26:49] followeth me amen shall not walk in
[1:26:52] darkness amen but shall have the light
[1:26:55] of life let me say this without light
[1:26:58] amen nothing can live he said see now no
[1:27:00] one could deny that Israel had light
[1:27:02] they were the only people who had light
[1:27:05] as a nation it was in when Egypt was so
[1:27:07] dark that one could feel it but in the
[1:27:09] homes of the Israelites amen there was
[1:27:12] light he said but now True light has
[1:27:14] come amen the light of the world is
[1:27:17] Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the
[1:27:19] light by means of the scripture amen
[1:27:21] relevant to the Messiah thus Israel had
[1:27:24] light amen but now somebody say now but
[1:27:28] now the Fulfillment of the light has
[1:27:30] come and what was but glowing word has
[1:27:33] now broken forth into the brightness of
[1:27:35] God Amen manifested among his people as
[1:27:39] the pillar of fire gave light at night
[1:27:41] that was wonderful he said but now light
[1:27:44] and life were manifested in the fullness
[1:27:47] of the godhead bodly let me say this
[1:27:49] friends the light of life is not coming
[1:27:52] it is here and it is shin in this age
[1:27:55] that we're living in he said the Bible
[1:27:56] in his word in the hour that we're
[1:27:58] living amen is shining upon those Amen
[1:28:01] to catch the eternal life amen those who
[1:28:04] are predestinated to see it so listen
[1:28:07] there's going to be Darkness upon the
[1:28:08] Earth there's going to be gross Darkness
[1:28:10] upon the people but there's a prophetic
[1:28:13] light that would come among the church
[1:28:15] and that light would cause a
[1:28:16] resurrection in the end time Jesus said
[1:28:19] the people which sat in darkness amen
[1:28:22] they saw great light and to them them
[1:28:24] which sat in the region and the shadow
[1:28:27] of death amen light is sprung up now
[1:28:30] Matthew 4:16 says that but if you go
[1:28:32] back to Isaiah 9 and2 the Bible says the
[1:28:35] people amen that walked in darkness have
[1:28:38] seen a great light listen to this they
[1:28:41] that dwell in the land of the shadow of
[1:28:44] death upon
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:47] them upon them hath the light shined let
[1:28:51] me say this there is a Darkness upon the
[1:28:53] Earth but there's a greater Darkness
[1:28:55] upon the people that is living upon the
[1:28:57] Earth and here the Bible says that the
[1:29:00] shadow of death amen would cover the
[1:29:02] entire land let me say this friends we
[1:29:04] are living in the hour where the shadow
[1:29:06] of death is covering everything it's
[1:29:09] covering the political world it's
[1:29:11] covering the religious world it's
[1:29:13] covering science and education listen
[1:29:15] everything in this land amen is covered
[1:29:18] by the shadow amen of death but in
[1:29:21] Matthew chapter 4 it was prophesied that
[1:29:24] light amen would come to the Gentiles
[1:29:26] who were possessed and were condemned by
[1:29:29] God and their Idols amen but he came as
[1:29:32] a light he said and today the light of
[1:29:34] God Amen is the word of God made
[1:29:37] manifest he said that's the light made
[1:29:39] manifested the light is the works of God
[1:29:42] spoken by the word of God Amen brought
[1:29:45] to life and it's a greater light than it
[1:29:48] was amen at the dawn of creation oh
[1:29:51] Church of the Living God Amen if anybody
[1:29:54] has got to R to rejoice and thank God is
[1:29:56] the Bride of Jesus Christ she is living
[1:29:59] in the land that is covered by the
[1:30:02] shadow of death but unto her there was a
[1:30:05] seed on the inside of her soul and by
[1:30:08] that seed she would be the recipient
[1:30:10] amen of the light of life that would
[1:30:12] condemn amen the shadow of death and
[1:30:15] will cause her to raise oh I can get on
[1:30:17] the page with brother brandham tonight
[1:30:19] what a resurrection that was but what a
[1:30:22] resurrection this is listen that I'm not
[1:30:25] reading the Bible amen under the
[1:30:27] darkness of Leota or the influence of
[1:30:29] denomination L but God has sent a
[1:30:32] prophet in this age and he's opened my
[1:30:34] eyes to see who I am to see where I come
[1:30:37] from and to see where we're
[1:30:39] going he said though I walk through the
[1:30:42] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:30:45] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:30:48] rod and thy staff they comfort me he
[1:30:51] said listen there's a man here that can
[1:30:54] turn on the light y'all believe that
[1:30:56] there's a man here who can turn on the
[1:30:58] light he said those who sat in the
[1:31:01] regions of the shadow of death amen some
[1:31:03] of them under cancer some of them under
[1:31:06] the death of denomination some of them
[1:31:07] under Creed's death some of them under
[1:31:09] traditional death my all kinds of death
[1:31:13] but they have seen a great
[1:31:16] light the man that flashed the lights
[1:31:19] then is the same one who said in the
[1:31:22] beginning let there be lights see the
[1:31:24] same God yesterday today and forever he
[1:31:27] is present today right here now amen
[1:31:30] don't get scared he can turn on the
[1:31:34] light yes sir don't reject it receive it
[1:31:37] in the name of the Lord B again says in
[1:31:39] that day of gross Darkness amen the
[1:31:41] light will return amen by the pure word
[1:31:45] and we will return to the power of
[1:31:48] Pentecost Amen to welcome back our Lord
[1:31:51] Jesus Christ let me say this the Sun the
[1:31:54] Su n it is the king amen of all livs
[1:31:58] that's on this Earth in the natural L he
[1:32:00] said no matter how much artificial light
[1:32:02] we can have how many great electric ravs
[1:32:04] we can produce when that sun rises all
[1:32:07] the rest of them dim out he said that's
[1:32:09] the same thing it is with the word of
[1:32:11] God when the word of God Rises all
[1:32:14] superstitions denominational fanaticisms
[1:32:17] and things spread away and it shows
[1:32:20] exactly what it is he said the word of
[1:32:23] God made manifest it always separates
[1:32:26] the light from the darkness listen and
[1:32:29] his word amen is superior over all man's
[1:32:32] words over all anything his word is
[1:32:35] light let me just go ahead and say what
[1:32:37] a prophet said he said light is so much
[1:32:40] more powerful amen it just puts the
[1:32:42] darkness out I love these prophetic
[1:32:45] instructions 1958 the mighty conquer
[1:32:48] amen don't set in darkness no more the
[1:32:51] light has come the great conqueror is
[1:32:54] here let me just say this it don't
[1:32:56] matter what shadow that the devil's
[1:32:58] trying to kill you under there is a
[1:33:01] prophetic light that is come in this
[1:33:03] generation and it is a voice of
[1:33:05] Resurrection that is saying come out of
[1:33:07] her my people listen There Ain't No
[1:33:10] Grave going to hold this bride down
[1:33:12] there ain't no traditional death or
[1:33:13] denominational death or Creed death or
[1:33:16] cancer listen we are Invincible by the
[1:33:19] power of the Holy Ghost you say well the
[1:33:21] flesh is weak the flesh may be weak amen
[1:33:24] but I'm not talking about your flesh I'm
[1:33:26] talking about your
[1:33:29] soul what is this evening light it's the
[1:33:32] manifestation of the Resurrection he
[1:33:35] said now what does the light come to do
[1:33:37] he said we see the evening lights are
[1:33:39] here he said what does it do to have
[1:33:41] light if you don't have eyes to see how
[1:33:43] to get around in it what is the evening
[1:33:46] light he said the light comes on to
[1:33:49] reveal something so when light comes on
[1:33:52] it doesn't come on to change something
[1:33:54] it comes on to reveal something like if
[1:33:57] you walk in a dark room and there's no
[1:33:59] light in there at all and you're walking
[1:34:01] through there and you're tripping over
[1:34:02] things and you're stumbling over objects
[1:34:05] amen you have no ability to identify
[1:34:08] amen what you're tripping over or what

[1:43:37] night he said when the light was on the
[1:43:39] Statue of Liberty the little old birds
[1:43:40] caught out there in the storm and
[1:43:42] darkness he said now instead of trying
[1:43:44] to use the light to fly to safety he
[1:43:47] said they flew against it amen trying to
[1:43:50] beat it out he said now the very same
[1:43:53] light that caused them to die amen could
[1:43:56] cause them to live if they would have
[1:43:58] used it right he said they're laying
[1:44:00] there because their brain just beat out
[1:44:02] they're trying to beat the light out he
[1:44:04] said accept the light and say thank you
[1:44:08] and let it leave them they tried to beat
[1:44:10] it out I said oh praise God he said
[1:44:13] infidels will
[1:44:14] rise Creeds will rise people say the
[1:44:17] Bible's not right it's not inspired
[1:44:20] they're only beating their brains out
[1:44:22] where they could take it to Glory come
[1:44:25] on church amen they're beating their
[1:44:27] brains out when the light that could
[1:44:29] have saved them is a light that ended up
[1:44:31] killing them he said it's a light it's a
[1:44:34] lamp to the path and to the people oh
[1:44:36] we'll walk in the light sure not try to
[1:44:39] beat it out amen not to try to say this
[1:44:41] is not right this is wrong that's not
[1:44:43] right that's not right oh God don't let
[1:44:45] me beat against your light Amen Let Me
[1:44:48] accept it in my heart and say it's right
[1:44:51] Lord amen I will walk in the light come
[1:44:54] on friends this message is light what
[1:44:57] the prophet taught is light what he said
[1:44:59] on those tapes is more than suggestions
[1:45:02] it's more than just understandings of a
[1:45:04] man what he's saying is scriptural light
[1:45:07] that was prophesied to come in this age
[1:45:10] he said the great storm of formality the
[1:45:12] great storm of indifference the great
[1:45:13] storm of denial of God oh God don't let
[1:45:15] me try to beef that light out let me use
[1:45:17] it to walk in I believe it Lord there
[1:45:20] you are amen walk in the light and as I
[1:45:23] see it in the scripture that's light
[1:45:26] it's God's word let me walk in it Lord
[1:45:29] let me walk in it never never try to
[1:45:31] deny it think about that friends brother
[1:45:35] said they could have used the light to
[1:45:36] carry him to safety but they used it to
[1:45:39] beat their brains out now yall know this
[1:45:41] just amen let me just say something to
[1:45:42] you amen there there are people who will
[1:45:45] take quotes and they will they will use
[1:45:47] the quotes with the wrong
[1:45:49] motive the quotes are lighted now come
[1:45:52] come on y'all know what y'all y'all been
[1:45:54] around long enough you know what I'm
[1:45:55] talking about amen amen let let let let
[1:45:58] somebody okay I won't get in trouble but
[1:46:00] I'm going to preach anyhow Amen brother
[1:46:02] said there's a great storm of formality
[1:46:03] coming right it's what he said so you
[1:46:05] get somebody who wants to fight the
[1:46:07] storm of formality we don't need
[1:46:09] formality we don't need formality so
[1:46:10] what they do is they go study the
[1:46:12] message and they get a big complacent of
[1:46:14] cloes where brother said I'd rather have
[1:46:16] a little Wildfire than no fire at all
[1:46:17] you know and then say something like
[1:46:19] amen if I got to get drunk and cow and
[1:46:21] amen what they're doing is are compiling
[1:46:23] light amen then they come to pit and
[1:46:26] they just stand there and beat and beat
[1:46:28] and beat and we don't need no formality
[1:46:30] there's a great storm coming and
[1:46:32] honestly that's a good quote but they're
[1:46:34] not using the quote right okay then you
[1:46:36] get somebody on the other side and they
[1:46:38] see a fanatical a fanatical move coming
[1:46:41] you know amen so what they get up is
[1:46:42] they get up say well we don't need none
[1:46:44] of this teaching well brother B said we
[1:46:46] did need teaching he said because
[1:46:48] teaching will positionally place the
[1:46:49] believer and he said that's the only way
[1:46:51] you can rightfully have faith is when
[1:46:53] positionally you know who you are in the
[1:46:55] word let me say this can we just quit
[1:46:57] using the message to find and just
[1:46:59] preach the word until it brings a
[1:47:01] liberty in the house of God and Eagles
[1:47:03] can begin to walk in that light and that
[1:47:06] light can carry them amen from this
[1:47:08] Dimension into that Dimension where all
[1:47:10] things are perfect you say preacher why
[1:47:12] are you saying that amen because our
[1:47:14] young people amen need to know this
[1:47:16] message is more than legalism it's more
[1:47:19] than just a bunch of quoes about what
[1:47:20] you don't do and what you don't wear and
[1:47:22] where you don't go and what you don't
[1:47:23] listen to they need to know that this
[1:47:25] message is rapturing Faith yes there is
[1:47:27] a clothline religion yes there is a call
[1:47:30] to Holiness yes there is a stone amen
[1:47:32] yes there is a stone in the hand of a
[1:47:35] prophet Amen to he you out of Le out to
[1:47:37] se it but at the same time it's the
[1:47:39] message of
[1:47:41] Grace it's not the message of legalism
[1:47:44] it's the message of Grace now before you
[1:47:47] can ever walk in this line you've got to
[1:47:49] step in the line remember said oh if we
[1:47:51] could ever come in the presence of God
[1:47:52] like Moses did he said why it was a
[1:47:55] revolutionary to him it would
[1:47:56] revolutionize in the light of what that
[1:47:59] angel of God stand there on the mountain
[1:48:00] that day everything that he once had or
[1:48:03] thought would never happen it come to be
[1:48:05] a reality I think if a man and woman
[1:48:08] today would it ever step into the light
[1:48:10] of the Holy Spirit listen to this under
[1:48:13] the unction of God's
[1:48:15] spirit and the light of God's word
[1:48:18] everything God has promised will
[1:48:20] illuminate to you and be real again so
[1:48:25] at one time the promise of Deliverance
[1:48:27] to Israel was real to
[1:48:30] Moses but when he stepped out of the
[1:48:32] light that promise become dmed to him
[1:48:36] but when the light come he steep back in
[1:48:38] the light and it become a reality he
[1:48:41] said oh that's the reason Moses faed in
[1:48:42] the first place it was the lack of
[1:48:44] having what the burning bush had that's
[1:48:47] what our failure today is is the lack of
[1:48:49] having what the Holy Spirit has see the
[1:48:52] Holy Spirit has all good things for us
[1:48:54] and if we receive the Holy Spirit then
[1:48:57] all things are possible they're not only
[1:48:59] possible but they're promised to us
[1:49:01] because Jesus said it he said ask the
[1:49:03] father anything in my name I will do it
[1:49:06] if he abide in me and my word and you
[1:49:08] ask what you will it'll be given to you
[1:49:10] see when we step into the light of God's
[1:49:13] word with the unction of the Holy Spirit
[1:49:16] to shine the light on it brother The
[1:49:18] Impossible becomes little things then
[1:49:21] yes sir see when God's word his promise
[1:49:23] becomes enlightened by the presence of
[1:49:26] the Angel of the Lord Stop Moses now
[1:49:29] amen he is on his Road listen as long as
[1:49:33] he was standing in his human ability
[1:49:35] amen he slew one Egyptian and ran but
[1:49:38] when he stepped over into the light of
[1:49:40] the reality of God it put a courage in
[1:49:43] him to move into action you know what I
[1:49:45] say tonight friends I say it's time Amen
[1:49:48] to step out of man's ideas it's time to
[1:49:51] step out of traditions it's time to step
[1:49:53] out of what this man taugh and what this
[1:49:55] man thinks and what this devil told you
[1:49:57] about your future it's time to step out
[1:49:59] of all of that and step back over into
[1:50:02] the light of the word of God and then
[1:50:04] the promise of healing and the promise
[1:50:06] of Deliverance and the promise of the
[1:50:08] Rapture every promise that God Made You
[1:50:11] will become real again and will be
[1:50:13] illuminated when you stand underneath a
[1:50:16] precious light of his
[1:50:19] resurrection glory to God he say
[1:50:21] preacher you're awful excited
[1:50:23] I am because I stepped into the light
[1:50:26] and when I got in the light I realized
[1:50:28] there was time to put my walking shoes
[1:50:31] on come on it's time to put your walking
[1:50:34] shoes on you say really yes sir amen if
[1:50:36] you have stepped in the light amen
[1:50:38] listen the Bible says amen if we walk in
[1:50:41] the light as he is in the light then we
[1:50:44] have Fellowship one with another and the
[1:50:46] blood of Jesus Christ his son amen
[1:50:49] cleanseth us from all sin you say
[1:50:51] brother Andrew it's it's been a long
[1:50:53] time since I walked you know why it's
[1:50:55] been a long time since you walked it's
[1:50:56] cuz you've been standing in the glare of
[1:50:59] what some devil has said amen about your
[1:51:02] salvation you've been standing in the
[1:51:04] glare of what a doctor has said about
[1:51:06] your condition but all tonight if you
[1:51:09] could step over into the light of Isaiah
[1:51:11] 53 if you could step over into the light
[1:51:14] of Isaiah 53 concerning the healing and
[1:51:17] the atonement then all the promises of
[1:51:19] God would be illuminated and they would
[1:51:22] be again and you'd begin to put your
[1:51:24] walking shoes on you'd begin to walk
[1:51:27] again oh my amen y'all just forgive me
[1:51:30] but I just love sometimes to to step
[1:51:32] over and look at something in the
[1:51:33] Amplified Bible in 1 John chap 1: 7
[1:51:36] listen to this the Amplified Bible says
[1:51:38] this but if we really walk in the light
[1:51:41] that is live each and every day in the
[1:51:43] Conformity with the precepts of God as
[1:51:46] he himself is in the light then we have
[1:51:49] true unbroken fellowship with one
[1:51:51] another he with us and we with him and
[1:51:55] the blood are y'all ready for
[1:51:57] this and the blood of Jesus his son
[1:52:01] cleanses us from all sin Ready For This
[1:52:04] by erasing the stain of sin and is
[1:52:07] keeping us cleans from sin in all its
[1:52:10] forms and its
[1:52:14] manifestations church can I say it there
[1:52:16] is a blood and it's a powerful blood
[1:52:20] it's an atoning blood it's a cleansing
[1:52:22] blood blood it's a Soul Saving blood
[1:52:24] listen this blood has the power Amen to
[1:52:27] not only remove the sin but it has the
[1:52:29] power to erase the stain that the sin
[1:52:33] amen put upon you in the first place you
[1:52:35] say preacher I can't walk you're right
[1:52:37] you can't walk without the blood but if
[1:52:39] you've been covered in the blood you can
[1:52:41] walk in the power of Deliverance and
[1:52:44] salvation and healing oh my the power of
[1:52:48] the blood has the ability to erase the
[1:52:51] sins look at this word walk it means to
[1:52:53] make one's way it means to progress I
[1:52:56] love this one it means to make do use of
[1:53:01] opportunities when you're walking you're
[1:53:04] making do use of opportunities look at
[1:53:07] this word opportunity it is a set of
[1:53:10] circumstances that makes it possible to
[1:53:12] do
[1:53:14] something some of y'all have been
[1:53:16] praying for circumstances to go away go
[1:53:18] ahead and praise God for them right now
[1:53:23] go ahead and praise God for
[1:53:24] circumstances because if you didn't have
[1:53:26] circumstances there would not be an
[1:53:28] ability to know that something good
[1:53:30] Could Happen out of these circumstances
[1:53:32] you know what an opportunity is it is a
[1:53:35] chance for success or advancement that
[1:53:38] occurs if you didn't have the
[1:53:40] circumstances David if you didn't have
[1:53:42] Goliath you would know that God could
[1:53:44] bring down a champion Philistine but if
[1:53:47] you have the circumstances but if you
[1:53:49] got God in your soul it don't matter
[1:53:52] what circumstances lay before you they
[1:53:54] are only put together to give you a
[1:53:56] chance to overcome them circumstances

[1:57:38] of the Gospel now this thing today says
[1:57:41] the church grain don't want to mature
[1:57:43] there we go you know why people don't
[1:57:45] want to go forward is they don't want to
[1:57:48] mature it's a lot easier to be a baby
[1:57:54] come on it's a lot easier to be a baby
[1:57:56] it's a lot easier to just say well the
[1:57:58] pastor didn't call me and he didn't
[1:57:59] visit
[1:58:02] me I don't live
[1:58:05] here it's a lot easier to say well the
[1:58:08] Deacon didn't shake my hand and he got
[1:58:09] my favorite parking spot and she got my
[1:58:11] favorite
[1:58:13] seat you're going to church ain't no
[1:58:15] need nobody loves me up there it's a lot
[1:58:16] easier
[1:58:18] yeah well let me just hit on that Spirit
[1:58:20] while I'm at it people say I'm not going
[1:58:23] back to church ain't nobody in that
[1:58:24] church Loves Me Do You Realize unless
[1:58:27] you've asked everybody from the oldest
[1:58:28] to the
[1:58:30] baby do you love
[1:58:34] me if you hadn't you're
[1:58:38] lying come on Church come on if you say
[1:58:42] well nobody in the church loves me okay
[1:58:44] have you asked from the eldest of
[1:58:45] Believers in the church have you been to
[1:58:47] them and said do you love
[1:58:48] me and then if you I guess brother r i
[1:58:52] guess your baby would be the youngest
[1:58:53] member of the church go back to the baby
[1:58:55] and ask the baby do you love
[1:58:57] me if not you're lying but what's
[1:59:00] happened is you've accumulated offenses
[1:59:03] and now those offenses are controlling
[1:59:04] your church attendance those offenses
[1:59:07] begin to control your praise you know
[1:59:09] what I say I say it's time to mature he
[1:59:12] said he said we want to stay like it was
[1:59:14] back in Moody's time or sank your F or
[1:59:16] oxer Calvin he said they were all right
[1:59:18] they were the light of the hour but this
[1:59:21] is another hour
[1:59:22] hour this is another day this is the
[1:59:25] advancement of the Gospel it's coming to
[1:59:28] its maturity so we can't live in what
[1:59:30] Luther said or what Wesley said or some
[1:59:33] of the rest of them we are living in the
[1:59:34] lot that's predicted for this day we are
[1:59:36] in the seventh Church age not the third
[1:59:39] or the fourth Church age listen the
[1:59:42] grain should be able to receive it if it
[1:59:46] doesn't it falls off and it means
[1:59:48] nothing to it the grain is matured with
[1:59:51] the life
[1:59:52] if it goes ahead with the light so the
[1:59:56] grain only matures as it advances with
[1:59:59] the light that has the ability to mature
[2:00:01] it listen friends that's why you need to
[2:00:03] stay underneath the light of the word of
[2:00:06] God and let the presence of the sun bake
[2:00:09] all the greenness out of us the hour has
[2:00:12] come to lay in the presence of the
[2:00:17] sun knowing this time that now is high
[2:00:20] time to wake out of sleep for now is our
[2:00:21] salvation nearer than when we believed
[2:00:24] the night is far spent the day is at
[2:00:26] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[2:00:28] of darkness let us put on the armor of
[2:00:30] light I pray this is okay Redeeming the
[2:00:33] time because the days are evil look at
[2:00:36] this Redeeming the time you know what
[2:00:38] that means it means to buy up every and
[2:00:41] each
[2:00:42] opportunity you know what that word time
[2:00:44] means it means the Supreme moment or the
[2:00:47] golden opportunity I love this one in
[2:00:50] other words Paul is saying
[2:00:52] redeem our golden opportunity in the
[2:00:55] presence of God
[2:00:58] himself redeem our golden opportunity in
[2:01:02] the presence of God himself said see
[2:01:05] don't never fail your opportunity Easter
[2:01:08] C 65 oh Christian what an opportunity we
[2:01:11] have we have opportunities that St Paul
[2:01:13] never dreamed of having we have
[2:01:15] opportunities Enoch and Elijah all them
[2:01:17] never had the opportunities we have now
[2:01:22] listen friends the conditions and
[2:01:24] circumstances are creating situations to
[2:01:27] give us Victory like has never been seen
[2:01:30] before Hallelujah the word has come in
[2:01:33] such power and such Revelation listen
[2:01:36] friends amen can I just close on this
[2:01:38] can I can I say something to you you are
[2:01:41] Enoch amen Enoch is a type of the Bride
[2:01:44] the believer now let me just say this
[2:01:46] Amen Let me just drop this to you okay
[2:01:48] Enoch done a lot of great things you
[2:01:50] know that you know Enoch built a
[2:01:52] pyramid he put the entire revelation of
[2:01:55] the Bible in a pyramid you know Enoch
[2:01:58] amen done that without any science or
[2:02:00] any
[2:02:01] education but simply following the
[2:02:03] leadership of the Holy Ghost or the
[2:02:04] spirit of God he built a pyramid but
[2:02:07] when we mention Enoch what's the first
[2:02:09] thing we think of his building of the
[2:02:12] pyramid or his
[2:02:14] walk Come On Church do we say do we do
[2:02:17] we commonly say Enoch built a pyramid
[2:02:20] Hallelujah no we say Enoch walked with
[2:02:23] God and he was not so out of all that
[2:02:26] Enoch done the most important and
[2:02:28] outstanding and remarkable thing about
[2:02:30] Enoch was his walk Hallelujah the most
[2:02:34] remarkable thing that Enoch is noted for
[2:02:37] is this that Enoch lived 6 and5 years
[2:02:41] and begat methusa listen and Enoch
[2:02:43] walked with God after he begat methusa
[2:02:46] 300 years he begat sons and daughters
[2:02:49] and all the days of Enoch were 300 60
[2:02:52] and5 years listen and Enoch walked with
[2:02:55] god listen amen and he was not amen for
[2:02:59] God took him can I just I don't have
[2:03:01] time to go into Enoch's pyramid but let
[2:03:03] me just say this what was in the pyramid
[2:03:06] was more than just in the pyramid it was
[2:03:08] in Enoch's Place Hallelujah the
[2:03:12] Revelation that was sealed in the
[2:03:14] Pyramid of Enoch had become flesh in
[2:03:17] Enoch's body and it caused him to walk
[2:03:19] with God whatever God revealed to him
[2:03:23] about the future it put such a
[2:03:25] revelation in his soul that it caused
[2:03:27] him to walk with God can I just say
[2:03:29] something Enoch was not a single
[2:03:33] man oh God I'm getting on marriage right

[2:03:38] man he was
[2:03:41] married

[2:03:50] Brothers get in the morning and this is
[2:03:52] going wrong and that's going wrong he
[2:03:54] was a man he had a wife I remember oh
[2:03:58] God I'm going get in trouble sure as the
[2:04:01] world I guess it's okay to tell
[2:04:04] it brother you can correct it when I fly
[2:04:07] back

[2:05:34] Fellowship not trying to be funny but
[2:05:36] I'm trying to say something Enoch was
[2:05:38] like you Brothers but he still walked
[2:05:41] with God come on Church the Bible says
[2:05:45] this oh the church which is brother is
[2:05:47] the typ of Enoch 500 years how many days

[2:05:51] walked with
[2:05:53] God how many days did things not go the
[2:05:56] plan but he still walked with
[2:05:59] God how many days did he go without
[2:06:02] without come on without Sunshine
[2:06:05] maybe you know what I mean without maybe
[2:06:07] feeling like everything was right but he
[2:06:09] still walked with
[2:06:11] God can I tell you this tonight and
[2:06:14] leave it with you it's time to put on
[2:06:15] your
[2:06:17] shoes Enoch did that under the blood of
[2:06:20] bulls and goats yes
[2:06:22] yeah and the only thing the blood of a
[2:06:25] bull and goat could do it could remove
[2:06:27] the conscience of sin it couldn't remove
[2:06:29] the stain of the annihilation it could
[2:06:31] not remove it could not remove the
[2:06:33] desire to do it but under the blood of
[2:06:36] bulls and goats Enoch still Walks With
[2:06:38] God can I say this to you tonight if we
[2:06:40] walk in the light as he is in the light
[2:06:44] we have fellowship with him and his
[2:06:47] blood cleanses us from all sins listen

[2:06:51] like walking but walk anyhow there's
[2:06:54] going to be days that there's going to
[2:06:55] be misunderstandings in the house
[2:06:57] there's going to be ill feelings the
[2:06:58] devil's going to try to bring in he said
[2:07:00] but everything God said he did it he
[2:07:03] said why he walked with God walking in
[2:07:06] the light with a testimony so Enoch just
[2:07:08] kept walking the line and one day he
[2:07:10] felt his feet getting off the ground he
[2:07:12] just kept on walking and he walked on
[2:07:14] into Glory without even dying that's
[2:07:16] right amen God took him away because he
[2:07:18] was walking in the light with a
[2:07:20] testimony he walked walked in the light
[2:07:23] of God listen to The Prophet just keep
[2:07:26] on walking I love this one he says let's
[2:07:28] get on our walking shoes Church light
[2:07:31] has come and now is the time to walk in
[2:07:35] it you say how are we going to walk in
[2:07:37] it Walk Like Jesus one step at a time

[2:07:48] else says stay right in that
[2:07:52] and just keep
[2:07:55] walking if you walk in this light
[2:07:57] brother said this he said it's walking
[2:07:59] into a light that you've never witnessed
[2:08:01] before it's an anchor of a Divine faith
[2:08:02] that calls anything contrary to the word
[2:08:05] of God as though it was it I love this
[2:08:08] he says it puts New Life speaking of
[2:08:11] light it puts new life it gives hope to
[2:08:14] the dying it gives curage to the weak it
[2:08:16] gives healing to the sick it gives
[2:08:18] blessings to the unfavored how wonderful
[2:08:20] it is to step into the light of his
[2:08:23] presence not a myth neither is it
[2:08:26] something that somebody is just fleshly
[2:08:27] in their minds drawn up but it's coming
[2:08:30] directly into the presence of the king
[2:08:32] of glory that Eternal Light of the
[2:08:35] Living God oh may we live such a Holy
[2:08:38] Communion 1963 such a holy consecrated
[2:08:41] life after this that men will see the
[2:08:43] reflection of Jesus Christ in us and
[2:08:46] that our walk in life would be worthy of
[2:08:49] the Gospel that we believe
[2:08:54] Enoch walked with God when he felt like
[2:08:58] it and when he
[2:09:00] didn't when he was on the mountain and
[2:09:02] when he was in the valley when things
[2:09:04] were good and things were bad he walked
[2:09:07] with
[2:09:08] God he stayed in that light oh church

[2:09:19] musicians come tonight I want to walk in
[2:09:20] this life
[2:09:22] I want this light to
[2:09:24] become my
[2:09:26] direction see we've come out of
[2:09:28] different walks of life maybe some have
[2:09:30] come from a denominational walk some
[2:09:32] from strength from the world some grown
[2:09:34] born and raised in the message we all
[2:09:36] come from different walks of life but
[2:09:38] we've all been called into the Walk of
[2:09:42] eternal life I love what the prophet of
[2:09:44] God says he said oh Father you who took
[2:09:48] the alcoholics and the prostitutes
[2:09:50] you've taken the fends you've brought
[2:09:53] them out of every Walk of Life and made
[2:09:56] ladies and gentlemen out of them another
[2:09:59] place he said The Exodus means the
[2:10:00] called out called out means the church
[2:10:02] and now God is calling his people out of
[2:10:05] every Walk of Life to come and receive
[2:10:09] him and to believe on him he says how
[2:10:12] Dreadful does the Walk of the modern
[2:10:14] Christian must be before God how we
[2:10:16] ought to alter ourselves alter our ways
[2:10:21] I want Wonder tonight how many could say
[2:10:22] Lord don't let me ever step out of this
[2:10:25] light if I ever step out of this light
[2:10:27] the promises of God will become dim and
[2:10:30] dull the offenses and things will fill
[2:10:33] my
[2:10:34] spirit Lord let me stay in this
[2:10:37] light maybe you're here tonight you
[2:10:39] stepped out of the light and all the
[2:10:40] promises of God had become dull to you
[2:10:43] can I say something to you tonight that
[2:10:45] lights in this building
[2:10:48] amen you know sometimes I think we get
[2:10:50] in our mind
[2:10:52] that we got to do
[2:10:53] something sometimes I think we get in
[2:10:55] our minds that we're the one that does
[2:10:56] the
[2:10:57] work but can I just let you in on a
[2:11:00] little secret the light does the
[2:11:05] work the light does the work it just
[2:11:08] needs to be turned
[2:11:11] on just needs to be turned on you know
[2:11:14] you go in a room brother B said he said
[2:11:15] you go in that room and it's real dark
[2:11:17] he said there's roaches and mice and all
[2:11:19] kinds of he said Critters and all kinds
[2:11:21] of things combined right there he said
[2:11:24] you go in there he said and it's dark
[2:11:26] because that's their habitation right
[2:11:27] they love dark you go in there and flip
[2:11:30] the light on the light automatically
[2:11:31] changes the
[2:11:34] atmosphere just by flipping the switch
[2:11:37] the light changes the atmosphere the
[2:11:39] light already takes away their comfort
[2:11:42] zone then you know what he said he said
[2:11:45] they'll
[2:11:46] scatter he said they'll scatter like
[2:11:48] roaches when the light comes on that's
[2:11:52] come on church if you walked into a room
[2:11:53] and it was completely full of roaches
[2:11:55] you flipped the light on they're going
[2:11:56] to scatter you know what you don't have
[2:11:58] to do you don't have to run around 10
[2:11:59] get out of here go get out of here go
[2:12:02] get out of
[2:12:03] here the light done the
[2:12:06] work the light changed the atmosphere
[2:12:09] and it was more powerful and it drove
[2:12:11] them to the darkness where they belong
[2:12:13] can I just say to you tonight go home
[2:12:15] and turn on the
[2:12:17] tape turn on the light change the
[2:12:21] atmosphere in that home you ain't got to

[2:12:24] turn on the light and let the light
[2:12:26] drive those Spirits out of the
[2:12:29] home the message of the hour is light

[2:12:36] tonight won't you stand to your feet
[2:12:38] with us you say this walk you're talking
[2:12:41] about it sounds like the Walk of Enoch
[2:12:43] it is sounds like the Walk of Jesus it
[2:12:46] is you say what kind of walk did they
[2:12:48] have a walk to fulfill the word that was
[2:12:51] spoken concerning
[2:12:53] them you've heard this quote many times
[2:12:56] I know but I just want to leave it with
[2:12:57] you just walk in conscience of fear walk

[2:13:45] be with you to the end of the world and
[2:13:47] he took an oath by the Covenant that he
[2:13:49] gives you that he confirmed it just walk
[2:13:51] with God then you'll have your ups and
[2:13:53] downs but don't worry you'll got to go
[2:13:56] through your Brier patches over the
[2:13:57] sharp rocks over the Bluffs down on the
[2:13:59] hillsides up through the mountains over
[2:14:01] Waters but walk with God yes sir there's
[2:14:05] so many Hills to climb upward you've
[2:14:06] heard the old song but how little it
[2:14:08] seem when you get to the end of the way

[2:14:12] look back at your Footprints it won't be
[2:14:15] very
[2:14:16] much are you hearing me brother BR comes
[2:14:19] in the Rapture and says this Paul said
[2:14:21] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[2:14:22] thought as a child he said see you act
[2:14:25] as a child but we're speaking of
[2:14:26] maturity right the grain matures with
[2:14:29] the light as it moves on with the light
[2:14:31] he said but as you grow older then you
[2:14:33] begin from making your first couple of
[2:14:35] steps and you toddle and you fall and
[2:14:37] you get up and try it again then after
[2:14:39] you while you get so you can walk a
[2:14:42] straight line that's what we have to do
[2:14:43] as soldiers of the Cross listen now it's
[2:14:46] time to walk a straight line right down
[2:14:49] that highway to glory
[2:14:51] walk with God I me tonight say Lord I
[2:14:54] want to put on my walking
[2:14:55] shoes put on your walking shoes Church

[2:15:26] Enoch did too but I still want to walk
[2:15:28] with you cuz he did Lord Enoch wasn't
[2:15:31] always on the mountain but he still
[2:15:32] walked with you maybe you're here
[2:15:34] tonight and you hadn't walked in a long
[2:15:36] time because of fear the reason you've
[2:15:39] quit walking is because you've become
[2:15:40] conscience of fear and unconscious of
[2:15:42] the light but if you'll become
[2:15:44] unconscious of the fear and conscience
[2:15:46] of the light you'll walk hallelujah
[2:15:49] hallelujah if you'll become conscious of
[2:15:51] the criticism and become conscious of
[2:15:53] the
[2:15:54] light you'll walk
[2:15:57] again if you'll become unconscience of
[2:15:59] the doubt and become conscience of faith
[2:16:01] you'll walk
[2:16:03] again listen friends tonight it's time
[2:16:05] to put on your walking shoes it's time
[2:16:07] to walk again it's time to step back in

[2:16:32] we thank you for sending us a prophet in
[2:16:34] this generation who didn't change the
[2:16:36] written word but he yielded himself to
[2:16:39] the author of that word and he
[2:16:41] interpreted underneath the
[2:16:42] administration the pillar of Fire Lord
[2:16:46] this message has come to do more than
[2:16:47] just puff us up it's come to do more
[2:16:50] than just make
[2:16:51] intellectual father if we ever could
[2:16:53] just sit down sometime and take time and
[2:16:55] comb through Enoch's pyramid all the
[2:16:58] things that he put in that pyramid Lord
[2:17:00] all the things that he put in there
[2:17:01] without without anything but you Lord
[2:17:04] and and all he needed was you but Lord
[2:17:06] he put so much Revelation in there but
[2:17:09] Lord all that Revelation that was in the
[2:17:10] pyramid moved into Hallelujah it moved
[2:17:13] into Enoch's flesh and it changed his
[2:17:15] body Lord you sent a message in this
[2:17:18] hour father you sent a prophet to tear
[2:17:20] off the top and Lord all those
[2:17:22] Revelations those rocks that were laying
[2:17:24] in there father they've come out and
[2:17:26] they're now accessible to the children
[2:17:28] and Lord the Revelation that was written
[2:17:30] is now made flesh in the lives of these
[2:17:32] Believers Lord we're walking according
[2:17:34] to the scriptures we're overcoming
[2:17:36] according to the scriptures Lord father
