My I thought after that special that the sisters sang, I thought we we could all go home already. I was so blessed. I thought from now on everything is just icing on the cake. Hallelujah. Thank you sisters for this amazing special. And uh let us not waste time tonight and turn to our Bibles in Joshua chapter 1. Joshua chapter 1 from verse 1 to verse 3. If you got it, say amen. After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' assistant, saying, "Moses, my servant, is dead. Now, therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, I have given you as I said to Moses. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for your presence among us tonight. We can already feel your presence in this place. But but I pray this presence will anoint the ear of our understanding tonight and and would you come and anoint my lips, Lord, that we may all receive a portion that you have in store. Come, I ask and break once more the bread of life for us tonight that we may eat and be filled. I commit this service into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. I'm glad to be back. I just want to tell in case you know I I know sometimes the midweek services uh there are less people in the house and I just want to take the opportunity to tell you how much uh a great bunch of people you are and I appreciate it getting to know more a lot of you guys this uh this past week and especially this afternoon on the fellowship. you and um I hope we can see each other on this side of heaven, but if not, we'll see each other on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. This morning, we spoke about the fact that many Christians haven't experienced the Exodus yet. Maybe they ran out of Egypt, but they ran to a church, not the promised land. And uh so we have mostly focused this morning on the exile instead of the exodus and how a lot of Christians instead of you know walking this exodus in their lives they walk the exile down to a little church a little formal church in med mighty Midian we say it different in French so it's uh and so let's just do do a quick recap of uh what we spoke about this morning. And uh this is what I call the authentic or true uh journey of the Christian. This is what most of us have experienced or will experience. And it's a little bit more complicated than what it could be. Uh because a lot of us left Egypt for exile. Um and then we have we have to realize that from exile we have to go back to Egypt to take what belongs to us because we cannot leave anybody behind. And Exodus is bringing everybody and everything with us. And then we go through the desert and into the promised land. And so tonight my title will be three exoduses and one promised land. Three exodus and one promised land. And um there are three. We've touched on that this morning. We all know that. But uh the first two we tend to look at them as history &gt;&gt; and focus on the third &gt;&gt; because you know the third is our exodus and and we just focus on this one. Uh but that is wrong. We cannot walk the third exodus before we have walked the first two. We have to walk all three exodus. And so let's go back to that quote from this morning where brother Brandham says, "God is in that message of repentance to the church nomino. He has to because it's an exodus. &gt;&gt; And God is in that message of divine healing to the church Pentecostal. He has to because it's an exodus. And God is in the message to the bride. See, so we find out that all of them calling one to this, this to that, and that to that. God calling the church out of the world, first Exodus. Calling the church in the denominational church into Pentecost, second Exodus, and calling the bride out of Pentecost. Third Exodus. And so tonight we want to take some time to look at every exodus and hopefully reach the promised land tonight. Amen. And so the first exodus really is is us coming out of the slavery of the world. It's really our conversion or what we could u call our justification. And really by the help of God, I hope to be able to tie the exodus with justification, sanctification, and baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it'll in a way that will make so much sense into our Christian walks. And and really uh I found out in in most churches, you know, these words, justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost are almost buzzwords &gt;&gt; really. And if even if you take a look on the table and you write justification, you know, out of the maybe 130 times it appears 125 times it says by Luther or by faith, which basically means that the prophet doesn't come to restore the truth about justification. It has already been restored by Luther. Um therefore we never really hear about it in our churches. It's just a buzz word, you know, justification by faith and we move forward. But it's just so much goodness and so much truth um in this just Luther spent his whole life talking about justification only &gt;&gt; his whole life. My there's so much there but really tonight for the sake of time it's going to be in a nutshell but but really the reason this first exodus I type with justification is because when God picks you up of this mess this Egypt of the world truly you are chosen he picks you up from the ground and and that is justification really is being chosen redeemed washed by the water of the word. Um God said about the first exodus, I have remembered my people. &gt;&gt; That is justification or part of it at least. Just like a car owner, let's say you have an old car that is in the back of the field, you know, and and grass growing around it, but but all of a sudden you remember that you have this old car in the field and and and you go out and you take it out of the field and you pressure wash the thing and you put a new motor in it. You know, you get it going again. You've just redeemed this car. You've just justified it. You've chosen it and you you you've given it a purpose yet or a new purpose, let's say. And uh that is that first exodus. Justification is is a divine exchange where God uh Ezekiel 36 where God puts in you a new heart. It takes away your heart of stone &gt;&gt; and gives you a heart of flesh. &gt;&gt; A heart transplant. It's a new motor in the car. It changes your old desires. It changes I mean before justification you wanted to live a life of your own. Go about your own desires and instinct. But when your heart is changed, now you have a desire to please God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you, if you have a new heart, then you have new desires. &gt;&gt; And we'll get to that a little later. And and now you want to please God, but it seems you cannot. And Paul talks about it, and we'll get to that later, but um just, you know, laying a foundation again. The second exodus is an exodus out of the slavery of the law. And that exodus is sanctification. And sanctification, my friends, is so misunderstood. You know, I've been preaching in my church on justification for like 13 weeks straight. There is so much to dig in justification and and I mean the church is loving it and everybody's saying amen but but you know justification by faith it's great but when are we going to get to the real stuff sanctification because we don't want people to do any anything you know and just we need sanctification Right? But my friends, sanctification is not adding law to faith. &gt;&gt; It's not. But if you preach justification too long, the people are sit in the pews and they're like, "Okay, good. But when do you come up with the laws? We need the church to run real straight." But just sanctification is not adding law to faith. In fact, law is what you need when you are not sanctified. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. &gt;&gt; Law is what you need when you are not sanctified. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, they missed his visitation. All the religious people missed who he was. Have you ever wondered why? I mean, they were studying the book. They knew the prophecies. They were waiting for a Messiah. Why did they miss who he was? You see, the reason they missed who he was is because the Jewish people were slaves to two things when Jesus came. They were slaves to the Romans, meaning slave to the world. And they were slave to Judaism, slave to the law. But the people wanted out of Rome. They were fine with the law. &gt;&gt; In fact, they love the law. &gt;&gt; They wanted a Messiah. Yes. But they wanted a Messiah to deliver them from the Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; But none of them were hoping to be freed from the law. So when Jesus came, they couldn't receive him because he wasn't fitting their idea of a Messiah. Amen. But Paul says in Colossians chapter 2, he says, "And you being dead in your trespasses, in the circumcision of your flesh, he has made alive together with him, having forgiven all your trespasses, having wiped, having wiped out, he got rid of &gt;&gt; the handwriting of requirements that was against us &gt;&gt; which was contrary to us and he has taken it out of the way having nailed it to the cross. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. What Paul is saying here is that Jesus came, we've been saying it all all since this morning, but Jesus came to nail the law to the cross to take it out of the way for us so that we can be sanctified not by the law but by the Holy Ghost. But the guy writing this letter to the Colossians, it's Paul, formerly Saul. This guy was the most fervent practitioner of Judaism in the whole country. He has studied with the greatest teacher of Judaism, Nealiel. And he believed he was pleasing God as he was literally opposed to what God was doing now. And we should always be careful, brothers, sisters, when we oppose something, &gt;&gt; believing we are pleasing God because we might as well be opposing what God is doing now as we are defending what God did yesterday. &gt;&gt; But here, Paul is doing a 180 degrees from Judaism and saying that Jesus nailed the law to the cross. He says earlier in that chapter that circumcision is no longer required. That's almost blasphemy. &gt;&gt; He says that Christ circumcises hearts by his grace. And he also says all things are lawful. &gt;&gt; I mean not some things. All things are lawful. That's quite a change of belief. It happened when he met God face to face. &gt;&gt; And it is a very sad picture for me to realize most Christians are still slave to the law. Most Christians haven't walked the second exodus yet out of the law and into grace. Now you say, "Brother Joel, are you insinuating that there is no more law?" That is quite frightening, isn't it? No more laws. There will be quite a party in the church if there's no more law. Pastor, we at least need to keep some laws going. You know, it's just for the benefit of the church. Let's at least try to keep some. Here's what I say. Tell me by what law Abraham lived, and I will tell you by what law I live. &gt;&gt; Me, a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; I'm not a son of Moses. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm a son of Abraham. You see, before Mount Si, there was no law &gt;&gt; or was it? &gt;&gt; Was there a law before Mount Si? Did Abraham live by the law of Moses? There was not even a Bible in the days of Abraham. No laws were written. Okay. Not one, not one law was written. &gt;&gt; Tell me then, why did Abraham pay tithing to &gt;&gt; Melisedc? &gt;&gt; The laws about tithing. They came only in Leviticus &gt;&gt; hundreds and hundreds of years later. Why did he pay tithing to MelkiseDC if there was no law about tithing? &gt;&gt; I'm interested. &gt;&gt; Let's see the account that God gives of Abraham. The account that God gives of Abraham. Genesis 26, the Lord says, "I will give to your descendants all these lands, and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed." Why? Because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. Which law? You see, Abraham lived in the days of the personal relationship with God where God would speak to him directly &gt;&gt; in his heart and let him know his will. Abraham wanted to please God, not himself. But the people out of Egypt, they didn't want that relationship. &gt;&gt; They wanted to be told what to do. They asked for a law. &gt;&gt; Moses told them, "Go to go to mount the mount. Go and hear God speak." But they didn't want to go. &gt;&gt; They said, "Go yourself, hear God, and tell us what it is." Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was too costly. It was too costly for them to have a personal relationship with God. Ten Commandments was much easier. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this. with all these laws and commandments. Were God's people a holy people? Did it work? Did the law make them holy? Come on. Is anyone reading the Bibles? &gt;&gt; Was God Was God's people sanctified people with all these commandments? Samson sleeps, you know, with a prostitute before going to his mistress. That's pretty much what the Old Testament looks like. They had the laws and commandments, yet they were unsanctified nor holy. &gt;&gt; Then tell me, why would you why would you want to keep going in that direction? When twothirds of your Bible, like twothirds of your Bible is written to let you know it doesn't work. It doesn't work. And this is why sanctification is not adding law to your faith. It's not &gt;&gt; sanctification is grace &gt;&gt; and it happens when you walk the second exodus from law to grace. And I would encourage you know any anyone tonight as you go back home to read Colossians chapter 2 the whole chapter if you can or this week just meditating on this sermon. Go back to Colossians chapter 2 and read the whole thing. You see, sanctification is the renewing of our minds. Here's what Paul says. And do not be conformed to this world by having a set of rules and a dress code and a church book. No. But be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God, that he may be like Abraham, discerning what which is good and and doing the perfect will of God in your life. That is what sanctification is. Because you see, when you are truly justified, your desires are changed &gt;&gt; because you have a new heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the problem with justification alone and a lot of churches out there, they they speak about justification alone and we see the results. You've seen the results. In modern churches talking only about justification and that's why you want to add some laws to it. We all want we all tend to because we don't want to look that like these modern worldly churches. So we think adding a few laws will help us. But that is not true. &gt;&gt; The problem with justification alone is that after a while you get miserable. &gt;&gt; Yes. At first, you're you have a revival because you've been picked out of the field and you've been washed and you've been given a new motor, a new heart, you know, and you're all excited about it. And now you want to please your master and and if you're if you are a car that's being restored, let's keep this analogy. Now, you want to drive around. I mean, you want to please your master. So, you're trying to drive around, but you can't move forward. You have no transmission and you can't break. You have no brakes and you can't steer. You have no steering wheel. And so you have a desire to please but you don't have the capacity. &gt;&gt; And uh just a little bit earlier in his letters to Romans, Paul speaks of how you feel being justified after a while. You feel miserable and wretched. It's in Romans chapter 7. You know this this uh chapter, but I've just taken a small part of it. For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. Paul's saying here, I have a new heart. I delight in the law of God. With your whole heart of stone, you couldn't delight in it. But I see another law in my members, wearing against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity of the law of sin, which is in my members, oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death? Who will do it? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. He's the one who's going to do it. what Paul is explaining here. And some people get stuck here and they think they have to live their own lives miserable and wretched loving the law of God in their heart. But but just as Paul mentions in Romans 7, when I try to do the good that I want, I do the bad that I want not. And Christians, many Christians think that's the state they they have to live in for the rest of their lives, wanting to please God in their hearts, but being unable to. But this is just a state of the Christian walk. It's the state you live in when you have walked only the first exodus. &gt;&gt; Now your heart is changed. You're justified. You want to do what is good, but you can't. You can't or you have to force yourself, right? And that's why sanctification is the renewing of the mind. Paul says just a couple chapters later, he says, "Be transformed by the renewing of the mind." which which means now that you have the desire to please God but are not able to let Christ let the Holy Ghost renew your mind. Let the teacher come and teach you how to submit your body to the desires of your heart and live accordingly. But the problem with law as means of sanctification is people cross the door of the church and we don't even want to know if their hearts were changed. We want them to comply and so they end up you know doing things that their heart desire not. &gt;&gt; Therefore they're stuck in a religion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I haven't asked your pastor for permission to say this, but uh I'll say it anyways. Sisters, if you feel like wearing pants, you should. If your heart's desire change, &gt;&gt; your deeds are filthy rags. It all starts from the first exodus. You need a heart change. You need your desires to be changed. Then from there you can move into grace, not into law. Move into grace where the Holy Ghost starts renewing your mind &gt;&gt; and teaching you how to submit your body to the desires of your heart. I have to move away from this. But I want you to consider how here in Romans 7, it's not called the law of Moses. It's called the law of God. &gt;&gt; And and up to Romans chapter 7, really, it's called the law of Moses. You know the Pharisees, they go around and they have the law of Moses uh be be respected amongst their people, Judaism. But here Paul is talking is speaking about something different. He's speaking about the law of God. How can you delight in the law of God? It's because you are justified. You have a new heart and new desires, but you are not sanctified yet. You have not been made capable of doing in your body what your heart longs for. This is the state Paul speaks about here. Now, sanctification is a work of grace by the spirit. The teacher is the renewing of your mind so you can walk in this flesh according to the desires of your new heart. That is the second exodus, my friends. My brother, it will do something for you. It'll change your life. You'll turn a corner in your Christian walk away from law and into grace that transforms your life and renews your mind. &gt;&gt; This capacity to know God's will and to live by it. This is what the Holy Ghost will give you. &gt;&gt; This understanding of what which is good and acceptable and perfect. Amen. I don't have much time tonight to speak further on the law of God but and the difference between the law of God and the law of Moses but let me just point you in the right direction as we move towards the third exodus. Search in your Bibles for the law of love &gt;&gt; or the perfect law and you will notice that as one law is nailed to the cross, &gt;&gt; the previous law returns back in effect. Not a new law, the original law really. This is why I I told you, tell me what law Abraham lived by and I will tell you what law I abide by. The perfect law, the law of love written in the hearts. I will put my law and my commandments in their hearts. Amen. Let's see the third exodus now. And so, oh, it says second. Sorry, I got that done ready quickly this afternoon. Uh the the third exodus is out of the slavery of organized religion, out of Pentecostalism. Out of organized religion and into Christ, our promised land. This is the last exodus. This is it. Leave organized religion. Leave the first and the second pull to enter in the third pole. My this is it. And uh it's not talking about changing building. You say ah I left my former church and got to this new church. But you might still be in a denomination of one man. A lot of Christians are in a denomination of one man. They have their idea and uh they advocate for their idea and really you have to believe it like them to be a true Christian and that is just as well a denomination. There's no difference. And I want you to notice that our title was three exotices and one promised land. And and there's not one promised land for us each time we go through an exodus. The promised land is on the other side of the three. Justification, sanctification, and baptism of the Holy Ghost. And really the the reason you cannot put the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Pentecostalism is because they they've uh messed up what the baptism really is. and and they've proposed an experience, emotions, sensationalisms, speaking in tongue. They they have substituted the real baptism of the Holy Ghost for some experience. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and it seems we want to go back to this sadly. Three Exodus, one promised land. And we're coming close to the promised land now. Oh, there you go. Third Exodus. Thank you. Let me summarize our three Egypts because yes, we have to walk out of three Egypts. We have to walk out of the world. We have to walk out of the law. And as I was having a fellowship this afternoon with some brothers and sisters at the table, we were talking about the fact that we see a move now of many message churches out of the law and into grace. In the past 10 years or so, some it's it's been two years, five years, 10 years, but let's call it the past 10 years or so, we see just a move of a lot of these churches out of the loss. A lot of are still in the law but a lot of them are also coming out of the law and into grace. And uh we were talking about this and and I mentioned this we we cannot act a as if it's something new as if it's a new revelation or something very special that's happening to us. Really that's 2,000 years old. Yeah, we're we're 2,000 years old late. &gt;&gt; Um, God is never late. But &gt;&gt; but really, you know, the the the corner was turned by Paul and stayed turned until they've created the Catholic Church, &gt;&gt; until the denominated again. And then it was again about controlling the people and the deeds and the laws became in effect again. And now in in in the 1500s Luther got out of the Catholic Church. We call ourselves Protestants because of him. But the truth is we all carry a Catholic heritage. We all do. It seems like we still come from there. &gt;&gt; It's it's almost like it's in our DNA &gt;&gt; to work according to laws and to try to do some deeds and some works to make it but it's not how it's supposed to be. That is why it's called the work of restoration &gt;&gt; and because we need to go back to the original. Not only we need to get out of cat Catholicism or any denomination as a matter of fact, but this catalyst needs to get out of us as well. &gt;&gt; You can't take a man out of the river, but it's about taking the river out of the man. Amen. And so I know we all know the third exodus because you know this is the one we've heard about the most. And so tonight I just want to first thing I want to make clear is that we all need to walk these three exodus before we can even think of our promised land. That is why we cannot skip the first two ones. They also have to be real for us. Not just history. They have to be real for us because before we can even walk the third one, we have to walk the first two ones. But let's assume that we have all been walking the third exodus. Let's assume just for a minute that everybody here has walked out of religion into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which is what the third exodus is about. It's not about a group of people anymore. It's about a personal relationship &gt;&gt; out of religion into a personal relationship with Christ. Let's assume for a minute that we've all done that. We still have a lot of questions to ask. And the first one is where are we at? Are we in the desert? Are we in the promised land yet? It's funny how the church gets silence when we ask these questions. to help us define where we're at. I'd like to set pointers like checkpoints for us because you know all three Exodus has to be exactly the same because God never changes. And the first checkpoint I have to make is the fact that Moses died in the desert. &gt;&gt; So did everyone of those who followed him out of Egypt. And a lot of preachers make it look like only two people made it to the promised land. Have you ever feel like that? Like they make it sound like everybody died in the desert. So therefore, a very, very little flock. Only two people made it to the promised land. Joshua and Caleb. &gt;&gt; Is that true? Did only two people make it? &gt;&gt; No. Millions made it. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb are simply the ones who led them in. &gt;&gt; And Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; empowering us to go in, telling us that we are more than able. &gt;&gt; I came here tonight to tell you that you are more than able. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus led us up to the promise, but the Holy Spirit came as Joshua to take us over and lead and direct and possess the land or possess the church. You see, Moses didn't bring the children into the promised land. He was the lawgiver, but he didn't bring the children into the promised land. Joshua took them over. See, and the Holy Spirit is the one that's taking them over now, &gt;&gt; not later. Now, Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost telling us, you were more than able and empowering us to take the promised land when now. Now. And Caleb is a type of the real minister of the gospel, I believe, following the leadership of the Holy Ghost and helping the people in the promised land. But we've stood there on the shores of the Jordan for so many years. I stood on the shores of the Jordan from where I from when I was born. I am one of the children of Israel that were born in the desert. &gt;&gt; I am one of them. &gt;&gt; I was born on the shores of the Jordan. &gt;&gt; And we've looked at countless people dying. &gt;&gt; One brother told me once, he said, "It's not normal that our people die. We should have the miracles that the Pentecostals have." He was advocating for return in Egypt. He didn't even know it. &gt;&gt; I told him in the desert people die. &gt;&gt; True. In the desert people die. The reason people die, the reason the children of God, the children of Israel died in the desert is because they walked around in the desert and refused to cross Jordan. They refused to enter the promised land. Three days, three days is all it was supposed to take to get there. 3 days walk and 40 years is how much time they lost in the desert. Now let's go back to our opening scripture. Joshua chapter 1. After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun. Moses' assistant, saying, "Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, the children of Israel, every place that the soul of your foot will thread upon, I have given you. As I said to Moses, as I said to Moses, God is not all of a sudden opening the doors of the promised land to Joshua. God is not the one who kept the children of Israel for 40 years in the desert. In Deuteronomy about 40 years earlier, he told Moses, "Go to the promised land, and every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, I have given you." &gt;&gt; And now we're 40 years later. Moses dead. Most of the people are dead, the ones that got out of Egypt. And now God has to come again to his people and repeat himself. &gt;&gt; He just repeats the exact same thing he said to Moses 40 years ago. He says, "Go in." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's yours &gt;&gt; as I said to Moses 40 years ago. &gt;&gt; Why did they stay 40 years in the desert or on the shore of the Jordan? Anyways, it's because they listened to false report about the promised land. &gt;&gt; They listened to ministers that said, "We can't make it. &gt;&gt; We can't cross the Jordan. We can't get the seven seals. You we can't we can't have the third pole. We we can't &gt;&gt; false reports &gt;&gt; for 40 years. No, no, we can't talk about this. No, we can't get to the promised land. No, we can't cross Jordan. 40 years listening to false reports on the shores of the Jordan and people dying and people dying and now the result is we're building a camp to go back to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Come on. These same ministers now they want to go back to Egypt. Come on, brother. They're tired of people dying in the wilderness. So they want to go back to the first and second pool when they're on the shore of the Jordan. It's time to cross the Jordan. &gt;&gt; The Jordan is a very special river. &gt;&gt; Throughout the Bible, every time someone came to the river with faith, the river opened &gt;&gt; to let them cross. Amen. The Jordan River is a type of the seventh seal, my friend. They've told us not to get close to it. Don't preach about it. Don't get close to it. You cannot understand it. They brought false report. But I'm here to tell you tonight that the river will open if you come at it with faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is revelation. &gt;&gt; And the beautiful thing is when the river runs dry and you start crossing it, you see memorials on the bottom of the river. &gt;&gt; They were left there. So you know someone crossed before you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They let you know, hey, you're not the first one to cross to the J cross the Jordan to promised land. &gt;&gt; You're not the first one. &gt;&gt; You can come at the river with faith. &gt;&gt; Hit it with the mantle and it opens. &gt;&gt; Every time someone did it, the river opened. The Holy Spirit is the one taking them over. Now, we've just read it. The Holy Spirit, Joshua, is the one taking them over. Now, brothers, sisters, our promised land is available now. Every day someone crosses Jordan to the promised land. Every day if you come to the river with faith and hit it with your coat, it will open. The seal will open and you will cross the river and get into the land of milk and honey and it'll change your life, brother. &gt;&gt; You'll never be the same. You will never thirst the message of divine healing again. You will be about conquering the land. You will feed on the promises of God. You will manifest God's power in your own life. You will speak to your storms. You will speak to the son. Son, stop. I have a battle to win. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You will bear children to Christ. You will bear fruits of the land. For years, for years there was a fight. Is the seven seal open? Is it not open? Everybody's fighting. But the truth has been revealed. And the truth says it's not something public. &gt;&gt; It's private. It's a secret. Is the river flowing or is the river open? The river is flowing. But now we know it can open and let us in. &gt;&gt; Yes. To the outside world, the river is flowing. To the carnal believer, the river is flowing. They come to you and say, "Oh, this seventh seal is not open. They can fight about about whatever they want." But if you come at it with faith, which is revelation, you know now it can open and let you in. &gt;&gt; It's personal. But as you cross in, you will see memorials of the ones who crossed before you. &gt;&gt; Knowing you're not alone on the other side of the Jordan. &gt;&gt; It's uniting time. &gt;&gt; It's uniting time, friends. Our promised land is Christ. It's marriage time. It's about time we get into Christ, our promised land. &gt;&gt; Out of religion, yes. But where too? To Christ. Get into Christ. To get pregnantated with the word, &gt;&gt; a marriage. &gt;&gt; Pregnated. It's it's a sexual term. This is a term that the prophet used. Get pregnantated. intimacy in the secret place in the secret chamber like we've talked this morning and Caleb just a worthy minister of the gospel he stands there he doesn't have a second pull or a first pull or second pull to show he doesn't have nothing to show except his faith &gt;&gt; in the word he's there as a help to take you by the hand and help you cross Jordan, bring you to the secret place where you can meet God face to face for yourself &gt;&gt; and be pregnantated with the word where you can bear the fruits of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; The third pull. Hallelujah. Most Christian I've heard talking about the promised land, they they talk about something, you know, on the other side of heaven or something far away. Most Christian I've heard talking about the kingdom of God. They talk about something in heaven or far away. &gt;&gt; My friends, the kingdom of God is now in here. &gt;&gt; The promised land is now in here. And if you stand on the shores of the Jordan tonight, do me a favor. Hit the river with your coat &gt;&gt; and cross to the promised land tonight. You can cross to the promised land, to the land of milk and honey &gt;&gt; where you will have no need or no thirst for the message of divine healing because you will now have the spoken word inside of you. Having been pregnantated with the word, you will bear the spoken word inside of you. And that spoken word will bear fruits in your life. And when you need the son to stop, you will tell the son to stop. &gt;&gt; And you won't even be excited about it. &gt;&gt; It will not be for sure. &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't ask the son to stop so that everybody thinks he has a great gift. &gt;&gt; It was about conquering the land. Every soul, every place where the soul of your feet thread, &gt;&gt; it's yours. &gt;&gt; It's about time the people of God starts conquering the land. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is here and now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, maybe many of us stand on the shores of the Jordan tonight. Maybe we have stood there for so many years looking to the promised land, hearing about the promised land, being preached about the promised land. hearing about the third pole, hearing about these things, but never really experiencing these things and wondering are these things for me or not? Am I a Christian? Do I have what it takes? Am I holy enough? Am I good enough? Father, may all these reproach of the enemy and all these false reports &gt;&gt; be cast away tonight. And may your people realize that by faith they can cross tonight, &gt;&gt; cross the river and enter the promised land. and that it'll change their lives forever. Lord, empower your people. May your Joshua be in this room tonight and lead people through the promised land as I have been pointing them faithfully to you. Lord, take them by the hand and help him cross to the land where flows milk and honey, where they'll be pregnantated by your word and bear fruits of the spoken word. I pray you make it happen tonight, Lord. Hallelujah. Do it for someone tonight. May your spirit roam over every heart as we go into worship. Lord, may you touch one more heart tonight. Strengthen the faith of someone. deliver someone from their oppression and their negative thoughts about themselves, thinking they are not enough, &gt;&gt; they are not worthy enough, they're not Christian enough. Help some help someone realize it's all by grace. I ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. musicians. &gt;&gt; Are you blessed tonight? &gt;&gt; Now you understand why I was so blessed by the song that sister sang. Do do we know the song? We've been made more than conquerors. Overcomers in this life. No. Sad. Very sad. Amen. You can sing it. &gt;&gt; I could. If I could get a guitar, I could sing it. Yeah. Does the guitar come up to here? Can it? I will. Somebody asked for a special earlier today. So, God knows all things. Eh. Oh, wow. needs to go down quite a bit. Thank you. Okay. We've been made more than coner overcomeers in this life. We've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. We've been made more than coner overcomeers in this life. We've been made victorious through the power of the lamb. We've been made more than coner, overcomers in this life. We've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. We've been made more than coner overcomeers in this life. We've been made victorious through the power of the lamb. Hallelujah. Amen. It's good to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just I just love how the statement that the brother made just now, how how um Joshua when he said, "Son, stand still," he did not even get excited about it. He just went on about his daily business. I believe that's the place we we coming to. just so much was spoken today that I'm just really happy and excited about. I was also thinking about the the principle and I'm sure it occurred to everyone. Um but those those 12 stones that were put in the Jordan River as the as the uh symbol there that someone has crossed there before and then when Elijah crossed that river and when Elisha remember now Elijah is a type of brother Brandham and Elisha the type of the bride following and and the the Elisha today can come to the river again in faith and say open river. Amen. We it's our land. I mean it's ours. It's been promised to us. Let's not look at all the the scarecrows and all the negative testimonies. Amen. The word is ours. The third pool is ours. The seventh seal is ours. Amen. Your relationship with your heavenly husband is ours. &gt;&gt; God has paid for it. Amen. But not only that, he's taken the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now we've taken the book. Amen. Praise God. The book is no longer in his hand. The book is now in our hand. Amen. Let's stand together.
