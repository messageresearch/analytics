out of my life I mean he did indeed praise God I am sad it's last service and you know brother Branham speaks about the campground cramps you know how we can sometimes just live from revival to revival I mean every day should be revival but yet when we've had a weekend like we've just had you know there's just something in us that feel so revived and so excited that in a way we don't want to go back to the mundane everyday after this but like our brother Jason specifically spoke over the weekend I mean it's in that every day we will live the Christian life it's in that every day I mean we our relationship with Christ draws us closer to him I'm so thankful for the services that we've had so far and I just thank the Lord for undertaking in so many ways and tonight we want to once again just come at the service into the Lord's hands and again before we go to brother a B I just want to ask if there's anyone with a need on your heart let's take those things to the Lord now precious father well Jesus you are our banner you are our provider you are a piece you are a redeemer well Jesus you're a Savior you are everything we may even need Lord Father but yet the one for mysteries

appreciate brother I be we know each other for for many years but it's been a real blessing over the last year or so in the Lord allowed us to share our testimonies and get reacquainted I just really appreciate my brother's ministry and just want to say I I god bless you my brother and I trust that it will be a blessing to us tonight Amen praise the Lord amen greet you again in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ happy to be with you another occasion just to fellowship around the word and we know as we behold it we've become it so we're glad this evening that there's a Revelator here there's a Holy spirt to bring us into higher ground into a deeper anchored life with him that's what we trust him for not just to pass the time or learn something new but there's actually something taking place it's transformation and we want the inside to match the outside we assume the outside will be all liberated we'll be all in a new glorified state and we certainly want nothing to lag behind in the Soul realm so we're glad that the Word of God applies to every part and every facet of our lives where there's a soul or the body or the mind or the spirit wherever we find ourselves to God the Word of God has power in it to transform and to bring us into subjection to his will which is our great desire so I'd like if you want to read with me we'll turn to Romans chapter 7 for this topic another law within me and I guess you can already know which scripture I'm referring to Romans 7 towards the end of the chapter we're gonna read from verse 21 and verse 20 up to verse 25 the end of the chapter before we read let's just bow our heads again we thank you Lord Jesus for your marvelous grace for your goodness O Lord we are so happy to know you to know you in sins forgiven Lourdes Oh God we can confess Lord in song in in worship Lord with there's a melody in our hearts because of the grace of God and the free gift of God and the compassion of God and the election of God and and and here we are Lord in your presence one more time asking you to anoint us anoint our understanding open our eyes Lord reveal yourself unveil yourself in us and through us Lord in the power of demonstration and the Holy Ghost for we we love you Lord and we wait on you in Jesus precious name Amen hallelujah we're gonna read Romans 7 as I mentioned if you have your Bible ready there verse 21 well-known chapter this is kind of the in-between chapter between 6 and 8 in 8 it starts so there's no more condemnation in chapter 6 it starts with that with baptism and regeneration and chapter 7 you seem to be trapped in between but let's read verse 21 onwards it says Paul speaking I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with a mind I myself served the law of God with a flesh the law of sin with the flesh the law of sin what a statement to make Paul saying that there's two laws working within him one law he's serving and the other law is subject to as well so how can you be subject to two laws that are so contrary to each other it seems to me we kind of tear you apart and that's why sometimes we find a whole lot of neurotics and the Christian circles because we have this desire to please God we have the desire to live for God we have the desire to manifest these word and we find ourselves so often coming short of that desire and falling short of what we want to achieve for him I want to start this little service you think I'm just going to talk about the law of spurtin life really we're not too worried about the law of sin and death we were familiar with that one it works in our bodies every day it makes us tired makes us weary drags us down sometimes even oppresses us and we have to realize that that is sometimes allowed by God as Paul said there's a messenger of Satan for each one of us buffeting that has to take place in order to keep us in the right shape so we understand those things but we never have to make peace with anything for me if I can find a verse in the Bible if I find a quote in the message where it declares my Liberty that I'm willing to stand with that you know even if I can't see it straight away I'm still gonna believe it and confess it anyhow there's one little thing I want to start off with it's kind of set the theme for the service and that is found in the message called Abraham 1955 the Prophet says and if you ever go in the rapture you're going to have to have the same spirit in you that was in Jesus Christ that's God's covenant with his church remember the Covenant is all about coming together the Covenant when they made the covenant they tore it apart and when that covenant is too fulfilled it has to come together and dovetail fit perfectly one with the other so when God made the covenant the Covenant the the part that has to fit with his covenant the spirit that was in Jesus Christ sometimes we even as Christians we think sort of of the Holy Ghost is another spirit another spirit oh it's the feminine part of God we kind of want to divorce the tooth you can't this feminine part was in Jesus Christ it only came out of him at Calvary so the masculine the feminine both in Christ you were in Christ your spirit was in Christ so the Spirit was in Christ has to be in the believer that's why Jesus made those statements the works that I do shall you do and so forth you do also we are facing the final deliverance the final chapter from the law of sin and death after this the law of sin death will have no more hold on us it will not influence us and we can't discourage us it can hurt us in any way shape or form that's why it's so marvelous even to get older in life because you realize the hold even as your body gets more frail and more subject to things you realize the hold of death slipping it's slipping because for you that day when you cross over is your liberation day it's not death doesn't have a sting there's there's no nothing there to scare you death is just a servant to bring you into the presence of God so it's it's not really something to be afraid of but we're facing that final deliverance and of course also for younger people we're talking about a rapture we're talking about the body change for me the achievement of Easter is what Jesus said in the this little line he said because I live you live also because he rose who we rise also because he died we died also so everything that he went through that spirit is in him is in us and there's actually no room for another spirit there we contend with that other law we contend with the carnal nature but that is a temporary thing a temporary thing like an irritation to form and shape the pearl in the oyster just something is here for now but their real life your real life your real substance we know is the same life that was in Jesus Christ that walked on this earth already so we obey the law of sin and death as Paul says there he wasn't talking about unbelievers that's under the law of son death he was talking about Christians that still have that law of sin and death you still get sick you still get discouraged you still sometimes lose your temper your body is getting older there's nothing you can do about that he said well that's not according to the Word of God it says we are eternal creatures but your body doesn't agree with that it's subject to another law and you can maxfactor as much as you want you can nip and tuck and squeeze as much as you want this whole body is going to get older you're just trying to fool yourself so you're subject to the law of sin and death but it is involuntary it's involuntary I'm sure nobody wants to get old nobody wants to go into that frail state nobody wants to do something wrong once you've received the Holy Ghost and that's why the Bible speaks about sinning willfully and remember sin is unbelief disbelieving willfully Hebrews 10 verse 26 says for if we sin willfully if we disbelieve willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth and take care brother Brennan said there you haven't received the truth you've just received the knowledge of the truth the truth is a spirit jesus said I am the truth he called the Holy Ghost the Spirit of Truth I will lead you into all truth so if you've received that spirit you can't lose it again but this is not receiving this spur just receiving the knowledge of the truth others if you're presented with the truth and you decide willfully to disbelieve it he says there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins now that sounds like you can only hear the gospel once but that's not what it's saying it's not what it's saying yeah you actually have to receive the knowledge of the truth in other words you have to be you have to realize this is the truth you have to realize this is the truth but you're turning it down that is that is disbelieving it willfully remember also the Prophet illustrated to us there's something just involuntary like if you are frying bacon in the pan and the grease would jump up on your hand and you would not fear it you wouldn't get burnt it's the fear that burns you but you say I can't help but fear there's no time there to debate and say oh well I just believe there's a promise for me I'm gonna buy that time it's too late right the grease jumps pretty quickly and there's no time for you to walk around with some iron and steel we'll nerves to say I'm not gonna be scared when that grease jumps out it's just something that happens automatically so that's why I say involuntarily we are subject to the law of sin and death but if there was no fear there you say how can there be no fear that's when God anoints a person like Daniel in the lion's den why couldn't those Lions get at him because there was no fear the Bible tells us perfect love drives out all fear so the perfect love is what it's the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost in you God can press it so strong that there's no fear and we remember Paul and the sand a snake on the island that bit him he had no fear at all why because he already had a Holy Ghost revelation that he was going to appear in Rome so that snake could not harm Paul and he could shake it off into the fire shows you that it's the fear that hurts you but that fear you can't suppress with your willpower so it takes God to anoint a person to be fearless so therefore we are subject to that law of sin and death that law that of fear that will hurt us and it's an automatic thing and we can't help that now brother Brennan says this is a beautiful message one of my absolute favorites called the fundamental foundation for faith if you want a real revival just gonna listen to the whole thing he talks in there and it says about this is now Satan Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything makes everything that sin and death bought operate to Satan sends a cancer now remember a cancer is a demon life it's a foreign life that comes into your body say but I didn't even notice it exactly that's why I say it is mostly involuntary with cancer all right so Satan sends a cancer the man recognized it receives it Satan sends heart aches heart aches so a way I can't help you mean I'm not supposed to feel sad no actually the Bible speaks about joy and the swapping your sadness and your garment of heaviness for a garment of praise and so forth the Bible doesn't make room and say now you need to be sad that's not one of the fruits is for I look at Galatians 5:22 there's no sadness there you know so what is that a fruit obviously but I can't help being sad like if you lose a loved one or you go through a traumatic experience or something happens and you feel sad exactly but that is the devil that's the devil sends heartaches he says we recognize it and receive it maybe you never thought about it that way maybe you never thought about that depression that comes on you that way but that's something that the devil sends and you recognize it and receive it and he makes it work he says and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man now you say well we ought to be at a place where we can resist that and Paul is speaking about deliverance here yeah he speaks about deliverance but we do not operate that law of spirit and life God operates that law as much as Satan operates the law of sin and death but it needs a bedding ground we receive negative input from the devil and we just put up with it naturally because that just seems to be the course of life and everybody goes through that and we're supposed to go through that so we had we don't receive an automatic immunization against the cares of this life we don't otherwise we would not need comfort otherwise we would not need faith otherwise we would not operate half the gifts that God has given us we wouldn't need them in fact we wouldn't be any there wouldn't be any reason for us to stay in earth and we might as well walk home but we have those weaknesses we have those flaws in order for a deeper revelation of God because how can he comfort you if you're never sorrow hmm how can he soothe you if you never have pain how can he heal you if you're never sick how can he save you how can he forgive you so all those things are necessary and is allowed by God that law of sin and death but that's not where the story ends praise God as if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more ought God with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and us recognize it right how much more Oh God to his children to make his laws be recognized among his people of divine healing a revelation power gifts manifestations of the Spirit the laws the gifts fruits from God the manifestations from God there are they are more real than these things that so naturally beset us now the law of sin and death works in the people he says and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things to set us free from those things hmm so sure there's a war going on but it's not a losing battle it's not a retreat in fact we are invited onto the battlefield with the assurance of victory because he is the mighty Conqueror and he's word declares that we are more than conquerors so I believe this with all my heart I believe and we're nearing the age praise God I believe we're here that when people are going to recognize these things what God preached in the message in 1955 is being recognized now in 2020 that's the Marvel of it there are still hearts that have not grown weary there are still people who are not thinking the Lord as the ladies coming they're not thinking like that there are still young people there are still children that God is calling into this message they not of the opinion that it's past and this old hat and it's over there and it was it was it is a run out of steam Minh and so forth it is stronger now than ever because we are closer to the goal now it says where people are going to recognize these things that we've had so much vain philosophy home brother and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until it is set the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the Word of God hmm said as I've said faith doesn't come by fasting faith doesn't come by praying reading a book all of that's good fasting praying and reading a book but faith comes by a settled something that's in the human heart that tells you that tells you faith has a voice faith has a testimony faith has a has a power the Bible calls it a still small voice but let me tell you there's nothing more powerful than that still small voice it might just be an impression sometimes and a little dim something as brother Branham calls it but I believe that faith has power in it to accomplish the impossible as he said to bring things when there are no things to be brought faith creates faith make something from nothing that's what faith can do it's a settled something in the human heart just as sure as you can come to this church and I says when you come home you told your wife you'd be home after the service was over you do that unconsciously you just go out and get in your car and go on home just now you could not do it unless you have faith you could do it I wonder if we grasp that principle we just take it for granted we just don't even think about it I'm going to do this I'm going to the store quickly you wouldn't be able to go to the store unless you believed you could I wonder if we grasp that I wonder since you'd never move from where you're sitting if you didn't have faith that you could raise up isn't that marvelous you know I thought about this a little bit and you realize no baby is born walking but the moment from when they can't walk the wind they can walk you can't tell the difference in their muscle strength in their legs or their ability to balance or whatever it might be there's just confidence see because they were made to walk and now they believe they can because they've been encouraged so much they walk with the same little wobbly legs they had a 5 seconds before this couldn't walk so there's a whole lot of faith involved in things we just do they also say that there are cases where people who have brain damaged and they were paralyzed or have a arm that can't move and they get brain damage and all of a sudden they can walk because they're not thinking about it anymore they're not convinced that they can't walk and it's did the nerve suddenly turn on there was just a blockage removed in the brain now look what he says here says you'd never move from where you're sitting if you didn't have faith you could raise up but you've done it so much and you just become so accustomed to those laws till it's a natural thing a natural thing hmm just now if we could throw if we could throw ourselves completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in us then same operations of the Spirit would work through us just as the natural thing does oh my goodness this is like radical radical just like the natural things we don't even think about it and we ought not even to think about healing right just the natural thing because we've do it we've done it so many times lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover don't think twice about it just walk on you're expecting it to happen because it's happened so many times hmm why you think God sends those things into our families sicknesses and so forth and you have to pray for your own kids and cast the devil out when they when he's trying to suffocate them in some asthma or something try and take their life and you get your righteous indignation up like Shamgar did and you stand in the gap for that kid and you see what happens and you think that God that did that over there is the same God in the situation I'm in right now you see you become practiced in the supernatural we're talking about a law see for me a law is a certainty and as sure as we have laws in this world in the natural and we have laws in the in the natural world that that limit or or regulate the way things work in this world was as sure as we have those laws there are laws in the spiritual just the same and there is within you if you are a Christian if you have the Holy Spirit there is within you a law of spirit and life and there are somebody to enforce that law if the devil can enforce his law you think God can't enforce his law sure and he's law he spelled out for us in his word and it's not thou shalt not kill it's they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover these signs shall follow them to belief that's the kind of law we're talking about every word of God every promise he made that's part of his expression part of his law and the Holy Ghost is there to make that real to enforce it that's exactly what the kingdom of God is the word of God made power so till it's the natural thing or I said we can throw ourselves completely to God then same operations of the Spirit would work through us just as the natural things do just the same thing because we were first created before the fall for the purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God how about that huh you want a commission you want to pay degree you want to know where you come from where your roots are where they're those are your roots you were created for the purpose to control to rule and to praise and live for God that's your purpose and if there's anything standing in your way well that's what Easter means to me we can say we can take up that sword of the Spirit we can take up every promise of God's Word and we're gonna hack our way through to get to what we ought to be God's law in nature makes the springtime every year season of spring right now a restoration that's what it is his law is inevitable inevitable it creates the conditions for the change of the renewal in other words because God ordained those flowers to grow he is obligated to create the conditions for those flowers to grow God cannot create something and then it just goes to waste then he's not God there's no what he's doing but he's on mission knows all things therefore if there's any expression in him he has to make a provision for that expression oh my goodness I wonder if we understand that principle his law other words is inevitable you cannot stop the law of God God's law of the Spirit brings forth renewal in our time right now picking off exactly on schedule there's nothing holding it back the world is going one way and the bride's going the other way and that's God's law working God's law working it's not because we're a better bunch than the Lutheran's we're a better bunch than the Wesleyan no sir I think we're a worse Bunch than all of them put together but God's law can't be defeated God's law is marching towards that rapture can't be stopped and the whole world will be brought into the chaos is supposed to be in just to allow God's law to be fulfilled exactly unschedule just let that law operate in you said oh my see there's nothing for us to work up or press into I'm gonna move on to the next quote here says brother Brennan says there was a law in Christ that law is in men he's talking about regenerated many Christians says you can bury him in the deepest grave or the deepest sea or the lowest lowest hell there's a law of the Spirit of God that will raise him up again see because a bird has a law now its body is material its earthbound in other words heavier than air right sits on the earth here but it has a law within it that the way it spreads its wings it can fly plumb out of sight that's against science they claim its earthbound gravitation has to hold it here but it can defy gravitation lift itself right off of it and go ride on out there's a law in it oh my this is because because it has to put that law that's in it to work and it's built to possess that law oh my a Christian every son or daughter of God is built to possess that law of spirit in life you're built for it made for it that bird doesn't have to go to school it just has to eat and grow that's all it has to do and that law of the bird life inside of it will eventually make it take off the earth what about the son and daughter of God all you have to do is feed grow strong or believe move on with the Lord Fellowship and what happens you are you are ordained to own that law of a son and daughter of God it will go in a rapture he says now I'm beginning to feel religious now we have a law the law of the life in us the only thing you have to do you are made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as sons and daughters of God you don't have to knuckle down to the devil there it is you don't have to knuckle down to the devil and sure as that law of the devil is working in your members is another law working in your heart and in your soul that supersedes anything that that law can put on you because when you let go and let God that's all see oh huh let go and let God yep he says if the fish said oh did I skip that one yes so sorry if the fish said I just read it to you anyway hope we were listening if the fish said wait I'll catch my breath real good I'll breathe up a little oxygen in me now see if I can go down no if he does that he'll burst open see in other words the interference of intellect the interference of reasoning or trying to understand how things work now as much as we appreciate that principle he Illustrated when he said you come to church by faith and go home by faith and so forth you can't you can't imprint that enough on a person with the supernatural because the supernatural comes from God so we're not going to go around and commit all sorts of witchcraft and so forth because we want to manipulate the supernatural that's not how it works Jesus said the son can do nothing in himself what he sees the father doing in other words he spirit-led to do miracles he didn't go around randomly doing stuff to prove anything so the bird says I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how to control how that law can control him see the difference there not him controlling the law but the laws in him is bigger than him and it controls him that means yielding he said let go and let God have his wonderful way she's in the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this and I don't get that that's not it is to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing huh how about that not you fighting your way to your healing and I know we got quotes and so forth says you have to fight or or your way with the fight is to let go let your little hands off so God can lead you remember what the Holy Ghost was given for Jesus and brother Brennan said the only scriptural evidence of the Holy Ghost is what that he will lead you into all truth now that doesn't mean he makes you intellectual and clever and so you can explain all the mysteries truth is the manifestation of God's Word in flesh that's truth yes sir jesus said I am the truth I am the truth of what God said way back and even when he said thy seed shall bruise the head of the serpent I am the truth of that I'm the manifestation of that so what does the Holy Spirit do it manifests the promises of God and the Word of God in you or body that's what it does that's truth and that's the only evidence there is that you have the Holy Ghost because you will be led into all truth not some not most but all in other words simple terms in Noah's day you would have walked into the ark that's it that was the truth in Noah's day so if Noah didn't have to study to get a degree and the elephant didn't have to study to get a degree in order to pass into the ark with an exam we don't have to either just that's just on the side there's no message degrees anyway so let me finish what he said there that you know the law of life's right and letting go of God we did finish it letting go letting God take control he leads you to your healing he leads you he takes you through the baptism of the Spirit there he says it or anything that he's promised any promise of God he needs to lead you to it which means you have to let go just say Lord I know it's there I receive it because I met your requirements therefore you said I'll get the Spirit of Truth in me now leave me Lord which is the higher law simple question the law of sin and death or the law of Spurlin life and all everybody will shout the spirit of life or the law of spurtin life the higher law sure it is but sometimes it feels like where's more subject to the spirit of the law of death and sin and we are to the law of spirit in life it seems that way brother Branham says in questions and answers 59 says Paul said my flesh wants to yield to that in other words to the wrong your flesh does to see but the law of the Spirit of God in the heart overcomes the flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do I can't overemphasize that it what it's that spirit of life in you that Spirit of God in you that overcomes this body and takes it to church whether you feel like it or not well in this case I guess takes you to fellowship whether you feel like it or not you say well I don't always feel like fellowshipping with God that's true your carnal mind cannot even contact God it's got a little imagination Department it sort of conjures up a good old father sitting up in the chair somewhere there in the heavens it's about the best you can do you cannot contact God with your intellect cannot touch God with your intellect at all it's the soul is only the sixth sense that can contact God so your mind can easily get bored in a service and suddenly you feel very unspiritual huh why is my mind wandering okay because there's another law operating in your mind but there's a law operating in your soul you see in what your heart says do that's the one that dominates your life yes sir that's a real Christian you say Lord let that heart dominate my life not this old little intellect it's gonna pass anyway just look then if it'll do that if it'll do that for a sinner in other words it'll save him then won't that work for sickness too you got to think about it if God saved you you are entitled to healing just as much the law of the Spirit of God in the heart that knows that by His stripes we were healed look at that not doesn't have to quote it and pip itself up and try and work itself up into an emotional standpoint it knows it knows by stripes I'm healed I don't have to fuss about it I don't have to shout about it I know it it's mine it's part of my makeups is they stand with their power and make that sickness in that body obey them because it's a devil that sickness is a devil one of the best ways for the devil to hide is to tell you it's just a natural thing there are no natural things okay newsflash there are no natural things there are two powers at work in this world one is God ones the devil there's no in-between ground there's no neutral ground nothing is neutral the law of sin and death is working in this all of creation right now any tree out there can't live forever any blade of grass will fail why because there's a law that limits its time on this earth and that's not right that's not right they say well what is stronger well certainly the law of God is stronger because all these things will pass away but there is brother Brennan said whenever you see his tree struggling down here it shows you there's one there that doesn't have to struggle because this is just a reflection of what's eternal anyhow now that law of life here's the good news you can't lose it just as the same as the law of sin and death you are born with it actually it shapes you before you even born you're born with it you live your whole little carnal life with it till you die and drop in the grave and then that law is still working to decompose you into ashes and dust but the good news is that law of spirit and life doesn't leave you either it's permanent and here's from a true Easter seal brother Brennan says oh the memorial of Easter those that are sealed away by the Holy Spirit now at even gate man was sealed away from God at Pentecost he was eternally sealed into God Pentecost he goes in or out no more he's there for good he's there for good you are sealed into that place for good says look one spirt were baptized into one body by the Holy Ghost that right then we are sealed until how long through the day of your Redemption if they have your redemption of course the changing in the body now he is coming back for his own spirit nothing else he is not going to rapture anything that's good or almost there or he's coming back for his spirit there's no attachments to the body of Christ it's a whole complete unit every cell there is accounted for and had purpose and is unique and can't be replaced and forced part of that body and that's what he's coming for the life in that body let me just get for you where I'm quoting from the message faith he says a brother the only way in the world that the Covenant will ever be kept is when you and I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God tore Christ apart and sent the Holy Ghost down for you and I the same spirt the only way we will be able to go up in the rapture is when that body comes to receive the spirit again the raptured people that's in the Covenant I hope you realize you see what's going on there the dovetailing they're coming together because where is your body right now well beyond the curtain of time you see sure that word body you see now the body of Christ on a larger scale is a body also and that spirit was in that body is where right now in you so that body comes down to meet the spirt that is the dovetailing there's the going together so we need to recognize that the spirit in you is not a secondary spirit it's not a weaker spirit it is the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead it is the spirit of said peace be still it is the spirit that said Lazarus come forth the same spurred Wells in you and me in every believer and the only way will go in a rapture is because that's burden that body has to come together because god toward that spirit out of Christ and put it into the church the Covenant is the circumcision by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's Abraham's seed this one wishes faith effort from that time he said he's got to be the same Holy Spirit that dwelt in Christ and when the rapture comes when that body comes he's bride that was tore from him or the Holy Ghost will bring that bride just exactly dovetail right into the body of Jesus Christ remember the man or God is a male and a female in one body because when he made Adam that's how he made him was a male and a female in one body so that body that bride that was torn from him in other words the spirit the feminine spirit part of God it was torn from him and placed in the church has to dovetail and come back and make one you can see why Satan loves divorce why he loves to split up a husband and a wife because Paul even said it's a mystery I show you a mystery is Christ in the church is when a husband and a wife get married and become one and Satan loves a high divorce rate I'm sure he's having a ball right now with a high divorce rate because people can't live with each other but it just shows you there's a fault there's a fake Union a false Union there but we leave that for another time so the covenant the agreement made when Abraham was put asleep remember when God confirmed this covenant and the Old Testament way of confirming the Covenant they had the true the car the contract they toured the piece to 2 pieces and they had to dovetail when they got back together again and of course the carcasses that were slain they're dividing of the sacrifices all showed Christ it's actually four shadows so what he made there with Abraham he actually did on Calvary God making a covenant with all of mankind on Calvary where he tore the sacrifice in two and to me you know the natural laws that we find are so fixed that we can't avoid them when God said let there be light guess what they're still light we can't turn it off and when God said let every seed bring forth of its kind etc all those things of God and what did he do he just spoke them but when he made his covenant on the law of the Spirit he took an oath he didn't just speak it to Abraham he actually made a contract he made it sure he took an oath that he was going or he was already did actually perform it before there was a world God making a covenant brother Brown says showing or pre showing that's just the animals I swore that I'll do it in your seat I'll bless all the nations the world's is read it but I'll bless the Gentiles our best a black man yellow man white man I'll bless everyone through your seat for out of you will come kings and princes how are you going to do it Lord I'll show you how and when he showed him how he put him to sleep to make sure he was not gonna interfere because this is a law this is the law of God is going to operate it's going to express itself and Abraham being a good man no doubt he could not express that law he was just subject to the law of sin and death so here God was going to do it all himself he said he shown him on the hillside where those pieces represented in any Bible scholar here knows that each one of those were clean animals it represented the sacrifice of Jesus Christ he was the RAM he was the heifer that made the waters of separation when you had the waters of separation through now we have the washing by the water by the word of the separation from sin through the word through believing and the pigeon and the turtle dove was divine healing that all in Christ isn't there God showed Abraham what he was going to do that through the seed of Isaac he would bring forth his only begotten son Christ and was slain yonder does all those sacrifices each one pointed to Calvary so I say that was a foreshadow of the Covenant the real covenant was confirmed on Golgotha on Calvary's Hill now watch watch what he's going to say says he would bring forth his only begotten Son Christ was slain yonder between the heavens and the earth when the Sun went down and blackness over the earth and he's there he tore him apart God pulled his soul out of him God that's pretty vivid image for me God pulled his soul out of him hmm and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth when that precious unadulterated blood of Almighty God dripping from Emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out of him he said my God my God why is how forsaken me in other words this is gone from me now what the god part can you imagine now you can try and work it out and make the calculations and put the spot spurt here in the body there in the soul there and try and work it out that way I don't think I just take it the way it said he toured that soul out of him says he's face full of mockery spit a crown of cruel mockery pulled down over his brow his nails drove was Romans spikes back Riven till his ribs showed through swinging on the cross screaming dying as sinners death the sin of the world upon him and their God Riven decides tor he's sold out of him and when he said into thy hands I commend my spirit and he dropped his head and the earth shook and belched out its rocks since there he is there's God's covenant see there's the fulfilling of it what he showed Abraham back there with a heifer and the Turtledove and so forth that was just the shadow that was just the type this was the fulfillment of that Old Testament confirming the Covenant God taking it so seriously that he tore the body of Christ tore the soul out of him and what did he do he gave us the half of the contract he gave us that soul he gave us that spirit of Christ that's in the church that's why I say it's not another spirit it's not a second very little spirit it is the Spirit of Christ the same spirit it was in Jesus and if it's the same spirit I was in Jesus guess what it's gonna act the same way it did in him yes sir sure it will she's old Calvary Oh Calvary Jesus bled and died for me then he tore the soul of his own son separated the Covenant and he threw the body into the ground he laid there for three days and nights says it rose up for it was not possible with my holy one shall see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he soul was his spirit just I like the way for other Branham puts things this is just mind-boggling okay but have a look his soul was he spurred that ascend ascended into hell how do you ascend into hell I thought it was descended but now look what a negative what he says next he says and he rose down he rose down God did and picked up his body and gave him life oh that just throws me God rose down what did they do on the day of pentecost didn't he rise down what did they do when he stretched his hand out to your little life didn't he rise down to your level God can't descend he just arises he ascends to hell and he ascended to hell sure brother that's something else now so I said don't try and make mathematical sense of this just take it the way it is and took the body of Jesus and said that his right hand in glory and sent back the Holy Ghost as a covenant you see when we meet him in the air it's the holy holy ghost in you that inhabited that body that's on the mercy seat that comes together the same spirit that inhabited that body the feminine part of it goes back to meet it and becomes one there now as a many membered expressed bride many little bodies making up the big body of Christ it's just a beautiful picture God and his family Christ and his bride every way you want to look at it since there you are says don't fall short of that brother see don't sit with a church experience don't sit with a little religion you know don't sit with what you think is revelation and some knowledge and some criticism when you got the wrong spirit around you be careful be careful it's just religion it's just a covering it's not going to rapture it's not going to go back there because it never came from that body right don't fall short of that brother without the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're lost that's the only you won't have to worry about getting to heaven if there's nothing in here supernatural The Doors can't unlock you could walk there and bump your head against it but if the Spirit of God is in there and the Spirit of God inside will unhinge the doors why it's got a unite it's the Spirit of God it has to come together God's not complete without you because you have a part of him inside of you she's got to have the thing in here to unlock it yonder that's right so you've already judged just and what you think about Jesus Christ is now here he comes torn driven tore to pieces he's so into God God blessed him and then he soul returned his soul returned in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see there one soul not many souls one soul what does that mean what is the soul the nature of the Spirit the nature one nature God's nature returned on the day of Pentecost now how can the bride be divided how can you have criticisms here and you know little attitudes over there not possible not possible at all right it says Baptists all egos right every believer and there his soul singular return back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes into every believer uh-huh not just some special set apart little clergy to sanctify clean up the mind clean up the heart leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there sitting when the Holy Ghost is given out now there's your covenant you're holding the Covenant in your soul in your heart that little pulsation of faith that little desire in you to love God and serve God is the half of the contract that he's coming for Wow here he says it now cousin when the Holy Ghost is given out that same Holy spirt that brought the body of Jesus out of the grave will rapture mm-hmm and that covenant has to dovetail as he tore their and gave the body went back to God the spirit came back to the earth then your spirit will have to be the same kind of spirit or it'll miss that place going together yes sir not because you make yourself but because something the love of God has swept into your soul and tore every earthly idol out thank you lord that's God's work God's work you might try and give this up and give that up it's not gonna help you much it takes the Holy Ghost of God to tear out idols in your heart sis and look at this and there's something in us every believer I've talked to every real Christian has the same testimony there's something in me I don't know what it is I can't put my finger on it that screams and calls to God mmm it's your soul in here calling out to the heavenly Father since there you are that gives you a faith and you become the seed of Abraham you believe God's promise like Abraham did and he had enough faith for what yes a body change though it lingered and hasn't it lingered who would have imagined we'll be sitting in this year but it has lingered yet you believe it faithful Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God hmm we can praise him tonight - there's even a desire in our hearts to serve Him even if there's a little pull there a little tug to believe that message that he's sent to - to hang your soul on it now without the dovetailing of love and love is what it really is God so loved the world that He gave that love covenant without that love the dovetailing of love with love all the form all the power all the demonstrations all the so-called revelation won't matter that's why Paul wrote a whole chapter on it first Corinthians 13 and speaks about if I knew all the mysteries oh I'm so revel a 'td and I have no love clanging cymbal just the noise nothing - God faith to move mountains give my body as a sacrifice have all these things manifestations and I don't have love it's meaningless when that which is perfect is come what is that which is perfect the motives of God the life of God the attitudes of God the expression of God how doesn't come by the same spirit that expressed him in Jesus Christ expresses him in your life brother Brown talks many-faced about Elijah about that double portion a double portion you think about it the double portion that Elijah Elijah and Elijah types Christ in the bride a double portion not a sparing portion not a little bit but the anointing only on youth brother Branham quotes in the message god commissioning Moses and he talks about that time where the woman kind of came to Jesus and talked about the places and the right and the left and so forth and Jesus asked her some questions and said can you be baptized with the same baptism and they said yes and he didn't dispute it the same baptism we're not talking about a water the spirit and then he goes on to say this it says notice talking about Elijah and Elijah now he watched him after a while a chariot of fire came down sorry did I oh I didn't put that on for you so terribly sorry you'd have to well you heard it anyway the chariot of fire came down and ported their part of them and the old prophet jumped on the chariot and went up in the rapture as Jesus went up in the resurrection and when he went up then as he was going up he pulled off his coat threw it down and he'll I shaft picked up his coat and put it over his own shoulders and walked down to the Jordan a very beautiful type of Christ being taken up baptized with the Holy Ghost and when he went up in glory he sent back the Holy Ghost for us to where the church is baptized with a mantle of Christ said these right you see quotes these things that I do a double portion right more shall you do greater than this will you do for I go to my father is that right a double portion says pulled off his mantle fought folded it let it drop back down on the disciples at Pentecost and brother sister says if we've got the Pentecostal blessing then in the name of the Lord Jesus let's walk down there and strike her that's the River Jordan now where is the god that was on Jesus Christ where is the power of his resurrection I think that's a good thought for Easter where is the power that raised him from the grave if that power is in your body brother sister it'll make you act like Jesus I believe it will not just when you're dead you need a resurrection but while you are alive in this world it will speak his words it will touch with his hands it will heal it will soothe it will comfort it will express love it will it will cover a multitude of sin it will be a peacemaker it will be everything that he was his old brother what's in your hand why it's got right in you it's in your heart it's all over you the Holy Ghost says do something about it just throw it out there and trust God and say certainly God promised it to me and I believe it certainly God promised it to me there's a safe place today amidst the howling storms out there and how bad it's gonna get nobody can imagine they want to predict they have models and so forth but if this strain just takes a little turn just takes a little turn they won't have a vaccine for a year or two and what they're gonna do about that it might just become a little bit more contagious maybe it will target younger people what's gonna happen then how are we gonna panic how are we gonna provide how we're gonna keep the thing going all of that worry all of that fear there's a safe place today sure it's not a bank account it's not an underground bunker with supplies so you know the the tribulation is over that's not a safe place the safe place is he's word for this hour he's Ark today it was a safe place in Noah's day it's a safe place today and Noah's Ark was made out of the Word of God because God sent those words in the blueprint down to him and he followed it exactly and it took him through the storm God knew just exactly how many days you would rain how many liters of water would fall how strong the gales would be well how strong the waves now large the waves would be and that's why he sent a blueprint do you think he didn't know what was gonna happen in our day do you think it didn't make give us a message to prepare against the eventualities of the day I believe he has he's Ark today's the word for the hour pitched within pitched without where the Holy Spirit see you cannot just have that word it has to be it has to be sealed it has to be anchored by the Holy spirt quickened what stands between you and judgment this day is the Word of God that he sent in this hour sure he's own spirit what does that spirit bring a higher law there's another law in you the law of spurtin life as we read sets you free from the law of sin and death sets you free from the grave sets you free from condemnation sets you free from judgment you're sealed into safety the safety of his promises for today not just quoting it off a page but divinely revealed that you are part of the picture brother Branham says nothing to worry about nothing to worry about no harm can be done you're just as safe as you can be let the storms come let oh everything take place let's sickness strike let anything take place that Satan desires to sin God will rock you right through every bit of it yes sir don't go to jumping out stay right in Christ say Lord God upon this rock you said I'll build my church on the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it I believe thee Lord Jesus I now anchor my soul in the haven of rest I believe this is time for us to anchor our souls that haven of rest that Holy Ghost unknown tada spell of the our just Christ the chief captain of our salvation there he stands the great conqueror he rained the veiling - took down all the middle walls of partition this is invited here it is whosoever will whosoever will - come and partake of his life his life be covered with His divine blessings that there will be no judgment strike you now this is thus saith the Lord I believe it and if judgment strikes it can't hurt you it can't hurt you you can take that to the bank ya not the banks that are failing and will fail soon but the heavenly bank it'll never fail cuz you may be sick for a little while huh how about it you may be sick say oh I missed the blessings of God I'm sick you may be sick for a little while so you may have to go through something for a little while but remember Christ is at the end what doesn't matter what doesn't matter he never said this Ark will sit in a little whirlpool like that really it would calm just as calm as it can be no sir he never carried a flowery bed of ez never promised things easy but he promised grace to sustain you in that time it says let sickness come let troubles come let disheartening or heart aches and everything come that has nothing to do we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved this thing can be jumping back and so forth but God will land you as safely as you can be in his kingdom one of these days you stay right in his ark hmm yes we don't have to build a big boat somewhere these are kazi's words stay in his promises staying the truth of the day you're living in if it can save you it will heal you and rapture you says I like little little David out there what he was talking about he knew what he was talking about he had a witness he had a testimony said your servant was hurting sheep out yonder one day in lion came and grabbed a kid and run off with it and I went and caught him by the beard took it out of his mouth he said a bear caught a lamb started away with not slew him he said in the same God he delivered me out of the paws of the bearing out of the mouth of the lion of the liver me from that uncircumcised philistine hallelujah he knew what he was talking about his brother that same Holy Ghost that give me eternal life will heal me when I'm sick it'll take me in the rapture yes sir just as sure as David was with those animals God had slain those animals by his hand and he had no fear for Goliath what doesn't matter if God has a saved me if he will heal me and if he has healed me he certainly will take me in a rapture it might look like a bigger obstacle but it's all the same because there's a law working on the inside of me called the law of spirit and life and then that law has already swallowed up death in victory yes to me that's what Easter is all about that's why I sing and I shout that's why this is a liberation day for me the Easter weekend is just you know one over on the devil you come over here and read what we know oh I don't think he's happy about that he still remembers that day sure you remember it till he drops into that lake of fire remembers nothing more it'll take me in the rapture you believe that God is just as much in his word on divine healing he is on salvation if the world's mocking divine healing what do you care they mock at the Holy Ghost when you know you've got it God is in his words sure he is in his word now what you've received the dividends of Easter the soul of Christ remember what's in you it's the soul of Christ the nature of God the other half of his covenant doing the same things he did back there hmm here in a message I'm not gonna be much longer hear the message who is this there's a tremendous message because really it comes down to what Jesus asked Peter but you know God is asking the same question of every one of us today who is this what is this he gives a testimony of a woman with a tumor and who would be operated on the next day in the Holy Spirit called her out in the meeting and and then she went for the operation and Monday and they couldn't find a trace of the tumor and brother Brennan said who is this who did that he says Oh God be merciful who is this that's doing this could you dare to say it was your pastor never could you dare to say men had anything to do into it never it's the Holy spirt the same spirit was on our Lord Jesus and he's coming he's coming to unite himself with his church the closing of the Covenant the bringing together of the two halves that's why we saw what we saw in our day that's what it means that's what it signifies this is so close that coming together is so close that is spreading forth his great holy light to redeem and to bring into fellowship a Church of the Living God for the rapture that's near at hand that's why all these manifestations and all these great things are happening why that's his goal to achieve a fellowship with you and why a fellowship to bring you to the rapture which is near at hand what is the point of longing for a rapture if you don't even have fellowship with the one you're going to meet in the air how do you become rapture ready just quickly before we close he quotes in God's power to transform there's another tremendous message this one is 911 65 Enoch was translated from death he says by God's transforming power what did God do that for for a type of the rapture in church that's coming since yes Elijah was the same Jesus body was quickened after it was dead says and in the grave Jesus body was quickened what by the Word of God and transformed from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God by what he said because the prophet in the Psalm 16:10 if you want to put it down 16:10 said I will not leave he soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption he says Oh God now look at that see the Holy Spirit is to randomly float around doing things it acts according to the blueprint of program of God what did the program of God say about Jesus it said he won't stay in the grave he won't rot and therefore he was transformed by the Word of God that pertained to him now you have to know which words pertain to you and you will be transformed by the same thing yes sir since that word has to come to pass it's God's word plant it in your heart Oh planted in your heart by stripes I'm healed planted in your ward here Hart he was wounded for my transgressions planted in your heart so if you want to go in a rapture if you want to be Christians genuine place this word as I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll and eat it up that the prophet and the word would come the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed don't you let some educated theologian out here try to pump it out of you don't you let him spray you with that carnal science and knowledge and education believe God believe God I'm just hope when you read that scripture when you read that Bible you take the verse you plant it in your heart you say Lord I believe you with every fiber of my being Lord flood my mind with your Holy Spirit flood my heart let I let me become just so enlightened and so full of your truth and your power that this will become everyday living to me it won't take me by surprise when the rapture happens it'll just be the next step just the next step yield to that law of the Spirit because I have a law in me what is I'm gonna quote you part of the articles of that law now before we pray a part of the articles of that laws first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 it says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep this is not maybe this is true this is fixed this is real this is the law of spirt and life we shall not all sleep we shall all be changed there it is you try and alter that there's not a devil out of hell there's not a circumstance it's not a bit of backsliding or unbelief there's not a bit of negative testimony there's nothing you can stop that law from coming to pass yes sir in a moment he says in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed now you can say that is part of my pedigree that's part of me right there that's what the law of the spirit of long life tells me witnesses to me on this Easter weekend this time of the celebration of that that resurrecting power of God and raised Christ from the dead that same spirit that same soul that same nature lives on the inside of me in the form of a law of Spurlin life for this in this corruptible must not might must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality I think Paul is pretty emphatic there I believe God is pretty emphatic there to tell us these things must be this is the law of the spirit and life how are you going to miss the rapture how are you gonna do it how are you going to avoid that not even a sidestep the law of spurting life I'd like to see you try mmm you guard we got a whole lineup of people through the Bible who tried look where they ended up right in the center of his perfect will yes sir by his law by his covenant by his oath by his sacrifice by his power you have a confirmation this day that God in you is the very same God that raised Jesus from the grave that dovetailing has to come together there's another law working in here getting old getting tired getting weary have some sorrow have some heartaches have some oh you know not so much of the material blessings of life what is that what is that compared to that law of life that's on the inside of you mm-hmm makes the birds fly and the fish swim and everything tick off just right but you got a supernatural law on the inside it ticks off according to God's timepiece in God's Bible and God's quickening spirit and there's no way you'll miss it no way the Holy Ghost in you he said will rapture let's close our eyes Heavenly Father Oh God the riches of your word of your promises of your truth Lord the lengths you went to to confirm it and to make it sure and stedfast and to deliver it to our hearts O God to write it there as a law as a new commandment as the truth in the nature of God that is forever true while heavens and earth will pass away we recognize Lord that that law will always be true you said O God we will free from the judgment present and future it can come but it cannot harm us Lord because we're seal in to your pavilion and in your presence we dwell in safety oh god I pray you reach out to every wavering heart to every fearful person Lord who those are on the borderline haven't made a decision or not sure of this of that God in a supernatural way may your call may your cry find those hearts tonight and bring them into the ark Lord into the place of safety like you did the animals in Noah's time bring them Lord into the message of the hour Lord God not the letter only but the spirit Oh Lord in the attitude and the way you expressed it in the enormous love Oh God that you poured out upon our generation bless your name forever we love you we trust you Oh God we keep keep us through this darkness and bring us out into your glorious life it's like I commit every person Lord they're there reaching out in their homes Lord Oh father from me other side of the world but Lord God we know we're in one body and there's no time or distance our gonna separate us so I pray you're rich blessing upon them in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise God I've been happy to do these services with you have some fellowship around the Word of God and I thank you for your kind attention and I hope there's been a benefit to you that some stakes have been driven down and that you are anchored in that haven of rest tonight may God bless you a man hallelujah isn't God wonderful isn't it absolutely wonderful how this word just links in so beautifully with this morning and how this weekend services have just all come together in an amazing way praise God the same thoughts of this morning we are the other part of God I just love how God just uses different gifts to put things in slightly different ways but the same thought the same Channel praise God I'm so thankful and even the things that we've been ministering here at home at our home church how these this weekend services just been sewing lying with those things hallelujah I loved so many other thoughts of their brother used and and that thought I mean that that that law of life that operates in us it's not us operating the law God is operating the law he's the one that's in control of that loan the reason why this law happens to take it back to the service of brother Jason this morning I mean when God moves on one side something in us moves because we are connected I mean those two parts are connected hallelujah that's so special I mean and what about a carnal nature I loved what I brother said the carnal nature is the grain of sand that irritates the oyster to make a poo isn't that a beautiful thought hallelujah to make a pole hallelujah to form your character to get us ready to reign with him we stuck with us carnal nature on the side I mean God knows what he's doing we don't know how much faith we've got but us trying to manufacture faith or not us trying to do to scrape together faith that we think we have I mean just God bringing it to pass as we walk with him as we grow in relationship with him I thank brother I be thank you my brother for for you you'll love thank you for your willingness to take part in these services it was a tremendous blessing to us my god bless you I trust that that your eyes are feeling better and that that the Lord is strengthening you just keep on committing you into the hands of the Lord and we pray that the Lord will use you
