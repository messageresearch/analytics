Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
June 26, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

going and doing things that they need a real Supernatural in intervention from God just to move on the scene whether it be for sickness or family members or marriages or decisions let's just go before a God who knows every need in here Heavenly Father [Music] we're thankful that when we don't know what to do or where to go that we can come to you Lord You're the creator of heavens and earth and the prophet said you drew the blueprints before the foundation of the world that when we would come into situations and feel trapped that you would lead us through and it was an opportunity that you could show your love Lord we heard many great needs that were read over this desk tonight Lord when you said that when we're done acting and doing all that we can do it's your turn Lord we want to take all of these needs there's cancer and sickness in the body even a a loved one that they don't know what's happened because of an accident Lord there's people in who are in life crisises and they need an

oh God we would not be able to use words to glorify you to lift you up enough Lord we see your tender hand in our life father when we did not know you you looked out after us and you drew us to an appointed time father you've always been merciful when we didn't deserve Mercy Lord you've been longsuffering to us and Lord we're here to praise you each heart as we've gathered here tonight I pray is opened up completely to you father Lord now if there's n a part of us that hasn't been surrendered Lord we surrender it all to you now Lord have our whole heart have our whole being have our whole mind oh God lord all of us every part of it we give it to you the whole Lord that you could use it to your glory father we're nothing without you lord there's not even at our best could we do anything that would have eternal value Lord but through man you could do great things you could tear down those things that are temporal prove that they are to be destroyed and you can raise up the things of God that we can rise in Faith Lord may we be your hand extended may we be your voice to your people Lord we ask these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ by the purchase price of Calvary in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you turn with me in your Bibles we had a thought come upon our heart and we'll give the title up front I was studying and identity was a prevailing theme in my heart and so was restoration and I'd written down identity restoration that was hyphenated was two words i' two separate thoughts and it was today that actually came together as identity restoration and so by God's grace we're going to just Minister a little bit on identity restoration and I pray that the Lord would just Inspire the thought to you as it just inspired to me as it gave it to me I I was blessed in Hebrews 138 we know the scripture very well Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's right God bless you just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word you could be seated this this scripture is one that in our day we've come to know as the very signification of of Jesus Christ proving himself in our day as he did when he was here on Earth this scripture is is packed full of more than we could ever unpack because it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it would be at it at that proclamation of the scripture there's probably uh one other person that knows that better than message Believers and that's the devil because he was reminded of it that he's defeated when that scripture was taken by a prophet in our day he would stand with such Authority that Jesus Christ was there present with him doing the same works that he did when he was here in his Corporal body that Jesus Christ was alive the same yesterday today and forever that his identity has not changed that if he did something then he has to do it the exact same way now if there was a reproach for Jesus Christ then there has to be a reproach for him him now he lifted him up out of history and it it was put on display Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it' be in 1950 at the Houston Coliseum where uh brother Bosworth would would come to the podium and he would present a challenge that Jehovah Gyra of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the new that there was no difference in Jehovah of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ the identity that who Jehovah was was Jesus Christ and I this was a challenge that was actually intended to give to brother brandham as being that there is no Divine healer uh that Divine Healing was not something for our day that it had expired that it was something for the apostolic age but it wasn't today that was the past and the wisdom of brother bosor being a a steward of the word in one question he challenged is Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus Christ of the new and that was the challenge that was given and at that time that's when brother Brandon would go to the platform under an invitation and the pillar of fire would be made manifest at brother brother bram's head I believe we have a photograph of that just a put it up I know we have the photo on the wall but if you put it up on the screen I believe they'll be able to also see that online but this is the picture that was taken brother Brandon would testify that that pillar of light was the same one that came to him when he was born he was born of a peculiar birth there was a a demonstration that God was present in our day that's right the same Pillar of Fire that met Saul on the road was the same Pillar of Fire that declared itself in our our day and we while that photo was taken by eyes of Fe faith we now Proclaim that that same Pillar of Fire is here because where the word is it's anointed word Jesus Christ is the anointed word so if he was then the anointed word Pillar of Fire present then Jesus Christ is now the same Pillar of Fire present where the word is the anointing is there's not there's not a separation in True Word and the anointing letter is dead without The Spirit Well my Christ my Jesus Christ is not dead so he's alive the same yesterday today and forever and when that scripture is read our hearts should Rejoice if you could just catch that if that was the only thing we left here tonight with that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it would be enough it was enough for healing campaigns it was enough for unbelievers to receive something from God because God was proving his word and he still proves his word to be the same the devil's defeated by this by this scripture this one scripture Satan's defeated amen so what are the seven Redemptive names of Jesus Christ Jehovah Gyra my provider he's the same Jehovah shama you are present with me Hallelujah pres now present with me he has not changed he's still Jehovah shama I don't feel him he's present with me where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst he is here we can we can Proclaim that on the authority of God's word he's here he's Jehovah shama Jehovah Shalom you are my peace oh my when I should be distressed this is the one that could sleep in the boat he he proclaimed we're going to the other side you're going to the other side if they could have rested on the word of who was in it the Prince of Peace was in the boat they could have if he was resting they should have known we can rest and he's the Prince of Peace there's no reason we could be dis we we should not be dismayed we could be confounded by things but we can't be dismayed his peace is with us amen Jehovah Nissi you are my victory this isn't something we've done by ourselves by The Works of our hands or or of man but it's his victory our boast is in the Lord Jehovah Roy you are my shepherd he's the one who's leading us Jehovah siku you are my righteousness I'm thankful for that one he's your righteousness it's not your righteousness it's not your works there's nothing you can do our our Merit even though he may wash us and make us righteous and separate us from the things of the world it's not our righteousness he's our righteousness I I Proclaim that he's my righteousness the reason I could stand behind this Pulpit is not because David McGary has any Merit in him it's because he's my righteousness Jehovah Rafa you are my healer who can who can testify Jehovah Rafa I was sick and you healed me I I I had a broken bone the doctor could said it but you're the Healer you're the only healer amen yes we see that in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us so Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever as the word is present here with us doing the same thing and that word if you catch the anoint in of the word even as the earth was formed there's one way that God works he's a Bruder he he the Holy Spirit brooded out over the word the Earth to Quicken to life the seeds that were already in it okay so Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God that word is not changed it was the same word that formed the world and if it required the Holy Spirit to Quicken and anointed to bring it to pass we don't just set in word only but we need the the inspiration and the power of it to come and Quicken The Word Alive to us in our lives Jesus Christ was the anointed word there's there's just not there's no separating the two there there's not for the True Believer um we while the word can be carried in unrighteousness that is not something we're capable of that's right you you have to be aware that yes people can take a word uninspired and that's why it's not effectual but with faith fath see the word of God profited them nothing not being mixed with faith in them that Hur it but faith is a gift of God so you've been given Faith to receive the word there's something in you that cries amen with you can't help it that's a gift of God in you and recognize that that is something that he's doing in you declaring back a mirror of the word in you reflecting back saying amen that's a fellowship that's a commun Union we have with him now as much as the word is there to declare itself there's always something that rises up and tries to take the identity away from the word oh that's for another day that's you know we can go through there's things given to us in as examples and this one came to me as we were looking it's in Luke uh 2 chapter verse 48 and that when they saw him they were amazed his mother said unto his son why hast thou dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing and he said unto them how is it ye sought me which not that I must be about my father's business so right then there was an identity theft trying to take place okay the the the identity theft alert went off the Holy Spirit quickened a response the word corrected the eror and he said wait a second I'm not the identity you're saying I am know ye not that I must be about my father's business I'm not the son of Joseph right that was identity theft right I'm the son of Jehovah I'm the Son of God I'm Jehova made manifest I must be about my father's business and you have to recognize that the Earthly identity Now by all means that was his Earthly identity everybody who he grew up with I mean the parents that raised him that was his Earthly identity it and think of this he wasn't raised by his father in that way a natural father so I I believe that is the calling that we all have is we all have a Heavenly Father you could say Jesus Christ in some ways was deprived of a natural Earthly father I mean it wasn't his blood father it wasn't yet he could know his heavenly father and that all of us can know I it reminded me just now of Matthew uh dealt with somebody who hadn't met their father one time and uh he had received a phone call out of the blue and and his response to him you know they were kind of bitter they they I think they asked him are you my father and he's like no I I I don't believe I am and they hung up the phone and and uh and I believe Matthew said well Jesus Christ knew his father and it was the answer to that but what we want to recognize is our identity is not an Earthly identity is the point okay it doesn't matter if you know who your father is or not of this Earth it doesn't matter that your home situation the the the the new birth establishes your identity you're not not the product any longer of a fleshly union that that's not your identity your your identity is a Son of God and all things have passed away and all things have become new that's right amen amen we're thankful for that yes your your Earthly identity is not your identity that is identity theft thank you Lord that's someone trying to tell you you're defined by something you're not and put something else on you that's not you now what is the proof of our identity let's look at Luke 4 verse 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord hallelujah Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that is still being done that gospel that's opening blinded eyes is still being preached today the blinded eyes of our understanding of who we are is still being open and it was a word identity we want to be able to take the word and recognize our position in the word just as Christ could take the word and it could be an anointed word to him in its hour in its season this is your identity this word if anybody ask you who you are it's right here there's not another place that you find who you are besides this right here anything that tells you who you are besides this Bible's a lie right let every man's word be alive you know they'll testify to you you know it's the Deep fake the Deep fake is this the Deep fake was this being born in sin scenario that we were put in that's trying to proclaim a different identity and it's fake you know how you know it's fake it doesn't last it's not Eternal it's done away with and there's going to be no record of it only the name that was written in the Lamb's Book of Life we're thankful for that you know there's something when the word of God identifies you as a son it it positions you and it's I'm with him you know you it's no longer uh your boast you know all of a sudden what's important to you is that he's identified himself with you and that becomes very real to you and nothing can take that away Jesus Christ revealed himself to me Lord no one could stop it and he just you you didn't put me in you can't take me out he didn't come to you and say should I reveal myself to David McGary Jr I think he did you wrong is that okay no but in his Sovereign elective love he provided a a a channel through Calvary the price that Calvary paid that his presence could come and and and Open the eyes Sir of a of a blind kid to the reality of the love of Jesus Christ and now what's my identity I'm a Son of God I I I remember you know there's and that becomes a that's our only boast that's our only boast is Jesus Christ there was a footage I seen of one time it was George Bush when he was president he was in a in a foreign country and he was being surrounded by Bodyguards of the foreign uh country he was in and he was being ushered into a back room and there was one of his lead bodyguards his chief bodyguard is trying to get to him he's fighting his way to him and the other bodyguards cut him off they don't number one they're probably doing their job they don't know who this guy is but there came a point where George sees what's going on he sees the commotion and he walks back and he puts his hand on that bodyguard shoulder and says he's with me andall that settled it he went behind the closed door with George and there comes a point in your life where it has to become very real to you who's with you and that experience of him putting his hand in your life and touching it is the only way there's not another way you have to know Jesus Christ for yourself personally and it is it it's a lie of the devil that tries to substitute that experience with anything else I I don't care how it is there's not a formula we're not saying you jump you shout you speak in tongues but knowing that you met Jesus Christ is the must and and what happens when you meet him I don't care I don't care if you roll on the ground I don't care if you cry I don't care if you dance I don't care if you run but you'll do something I mean I blinded eyes don't come open and you go and no one knows around you that your eyes came open I mean really I that ain't a joke so if he's Jesus Jus Christ and he's opening blinded eyes it's our spiritual eyesight that becomes open and the effect of that passing from from Darkness to light is what the new birth is it's to know Jesus Christ for yourself it's not some denominational Pentecostal understanding of you must speak in tongues it's you must know him the same yesterday today and forever amen so Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God and the the hearing of the word of God accomplishes exactly what it always has accomplished it will prick the heart okay it's in our day it was the word of God that came to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so this is an accomplishment of Jesus Christ the anointed word the same yesterday today and forever turning the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers no different it's the same word performing the same thing what was it that on the road to emus did not our hearts burn within in us as he spoke with us along the way so the way that God operates is the same that the way he's always operated your identity is made known by the word of God by by the effect that it has on the seed Gene of God in you that's right it it doesn't have the same effect they can't receive the word amen yeah so the word declares who we are in 1 Corinthians 13:12 it says for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I know even as I am known for now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim or a blurred reflection this is a an amplified I'm reading it but you could have it up there but when Perfection comes we shall see in reality and face to face so a perfect word has come it there was a time where reformers and people grasp at what the image of man of God must be and what his calling was for us but now there's a perfect word that comes that declares us to be the Spotless bride of Jesus Christ we're no longer grasping at something Darkly this this word was a mirror people looked at it and they said and they probed at it and they said could this be me could this be me is this for me is this for my day and we had in our day day a Vindicated word that came and said it's all ours we are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are the benefactors of a completed work at Calvary there was an identity theft that took place throughout the ages there was and this is where the restoration comes in the the identity of the church had been broken down it had been taken from the church the church didn't even know who it was there was a church nominal that was carrying the name of Christ wanting to have the identity of Christ going by his name and it wasn't Christ it was in name only and it was dead it was dead it was the brother Brandon one place refers to it as a dead corpse without the Life of Christ in it it was just in it was just a body dead body without the Life of Christ in it in 1 John 3: 9-12 who whoever is born of God do not commit sin for the seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doth not righteous is not of God neither is he that loveth not his brother that's an original identification of the Life of Christ right there the very Love Of Christ if it's not in you you're already defeated loveth not for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother and whereof wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous but what's the identity of a True Believer and anything that you want to establish they do it I think and in title research if you're going to go buy a piece of property identity is always established in going back to the beginning all right I think if you're going to do dog breeding they want to see you know how far can we go back to see the the parents if you want to know what something's identity is you go back to its origin to where it's from from the beginning and from the beginning the gospel is love one another amen I just uh see if I could find it amen this is uh I will restore in 57039 Jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other Pentecost had that I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of the Apostles and the disciples they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy they sold everything that they had for the furthering of the church there they was so together till even when one heard the other died they said let us go and die with him such a feeling and and that's when Lazareth died and he was they heard he died they literally were of the compassion in the mind if he if it's time to die let's go die that's the the love that was there was not manufactured it wasn't contrived they were their hearts were knit together and that brother brandom says now Jesus spoke of this and said Paul did rather and said let Brotherly Love continue that was the first church but something taken place and there was a fellow come in by the name of the Palmer worm and when he began to eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very sap line of it because it don't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know how much we want to be different from somebody else and as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle that's right we can't win there's no way for us to win that's because by their love one for another is how we're known your identity and who we are is by the love of Christ being a shed abroad in our lives if that isn't there you've lost your identity there's been a there's been something come in and Rob you of your identity and God is a restor the the gospel is that we have identity restoration services available to us g i i had a notification from the IRS that says someone is using your identity so I had to look into is someone following taxes under and what what do they do prove to me who you are where do you live what's your name what's your social and and you can look it up if someone steals your identity there's services that that's available to you called identity restoration they're going to help you prove who you are and they're going to help you I guess have the other guy lose his fake identity who's trying to use you but the the gospel provides you the only true identification that you have there and I believe especially when I was a teenager I remember for myself wondering who I was that was a very real question I was going through changes I didn't know who I was I was in travail there was a real desire to know who am I and there's no other place you could find that outside of this present truth this gospel but the fruits of it there has to be love and there there's things that happen in our lives I think that decare that that fake identity okay you have an enemy you have an adversary it's yourself and it does things that we know are not becoming of a Son of God and it's important to recognize that's not who we are and there's a there's a program that God uses to cut away those things let's read it together in Hebrews 12: 5-13 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father CH chasteneth not but if you were without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of the flesh which corrected us and we gave them re reverence shall we for not much more be subjection to our father of the spirit and live for there verily few days of chastening us after his own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised therein wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is laying be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed I want to look at verse 13 in the Amplified I had to do this just to take in the the breath of that and cut through and make firm and plain and smooth straight paths for your feet yes make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction so that the lame and halting limbs may not be put out of joint but rather may be cured so that scripture saying hey there may be something that's not in place but there's a formula that God uses to correct it it's by the pruning it's by the chastening it's by the taking the word and cutting away those things and the word of God to a Son of God causes change a Son of God when presented with the word of God and he's found in in outside of the the proper place of of a son it corrects his path it it's that is the genos of God in you as a Son of God you're the only one who can take that correction because that's the one thing Cain couldn't do is repent he was presented with the opportunity the very beginning of the work of Salvation is repentance and it takes a revelation to repent God has to reveal to you your frame otherwise it repent is not this dry work make a list but when God reveals to you your air and your way that is the the only way to bring forth the repentance is so repentance as a as the first work of Salvation is a revelation of God but let's look at what causes this identity restoration to take place in Romans the 2 chapter verse 14 through6 16 for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing else excusing one another in the day when God shall shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel this is the the Fulfillment of Joel where he said that he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh and that he would take out the Stony heart and give them a new heart and that now you have a gentile people I could just go ahead and ask if there's any Jews in here but there's no one here that I don't believe is trying to use the ticket of being a a lineage of a Jew to get in I'm a gentile I believe we all are Gentiles after the flesh okay but this is the gospel Romans 2 verse 29 but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart and in the spirit and not of the letter whose praise is not of men but of God so what does the word do it causes a separation what is the circumcision the word is the same yesterday today and forever and it's still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart where's the work of God taking place by the word in the heart if there's not a piercing of the word that that that goes all the way into the very core of who you are and says this is who you are as a Son of God and declares everything else to not be your identity so it's regardless of what the Gentile flesh identity is I'm not going to argue with that I'm going to agree I'm going to say you know what what you're right I can't prove to you my lineage as a Jew I actually have no claim but by the blood of Jesus Christ and by Calvary I've been made a partaker of his righteousness when the Devil comes to to you with an accusation of who you are as a sinner you say that's right I'm a sinner but by the blood of Jesus Christ I've been redeemed I'm now identified with Jesus Christ you can't lay charge to God's elect you but you can condemn this flesh you know what psychology does and what man does and don't be drawn off sides a good soldier does not entangle himself with the Affairs of the world the world will agree upon the problems of sin and sin's condition they're very good at giving it names articulating it they'll they'll give you a psychological disorder they'll do all sorts of things and they're pretty astute at recognizing the symptoms of sin and we don't have to adhere to their uh way of dep in things but often it's foolishness to disagree with the with the fall but what we have is we have the formula for Redemption repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what makes you a new creation in Christ Jesus it's no longer anything of our worthiness of this flesh of the of the symptoms of this flesh but when you've passed from Death unto life the reality of that is so much greater than any temp temporal carnal hindrance that we we have a new identity I could not make myself a Jew if I wanted to but by the blood of Jesus Christ I have an identity now of His True Image Romans 8:29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so the promise of the word is that it will conform you to his image that you're predes destinated to be the manifestation of Jesus Christ and we're living now in the fullness of that there's not a partial image being declared but we are to be the very image of Christ declared in this day The Same Spirit of Jesus Christ inside of you will do the same works that he did Luke 24:30 and it came to pass as he sat at meat and this is something that I strikes me this is the effect of the breaking of the bread of the word to us as it came to pass he sat with meat with them he took bread and he blessed it and he break it and gave it to them and then in Luke 36 so he's breaking the bread and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst but with just backing up I'm going to just labor on that just a moment I I jumped ahead bear with me but it was in that breaking of bread and how he broke the bread that their eyes were opened and they knew okay and and that is the same way that God's worked in this day it was by a a prophet's message we we spoke at the beginning that he would come and you would start to to through the church ages start to say what the false Vine was and what the true vine was and it was so we could recognize our day who we are in our position there there was things that had uh claims and false claims that had been made upon the name of Jesus Christ then those things had to be stricken off and it's only by the breaking of that bread and that word that your eyes become opened and you know him there there was a there's a present truth that you have to receive that opens your eyes so you can recognize your day in its message there is an end time way of Salvation and and it's very important to understand that there's not another program because if you think there's another way of Salvation then you're not convinced and concerned you think that there's other ways in there's a white Throne judgment and no one wants to be there that's right that that's when that you know we that's something yet to be revealed we there's no pre- knowledge of how that transpires you're you're you're at that time allowed to enter in and there's no guarantee the Judgment that could be be pronounced even you know our hope and what my desire is is in that day as we stand as the Bride of Jesus Christ there's those that we say this one has done good to me when I was in need they said a kind word they did this I believe in myself this is just Dave McGary Jr speaking not having a a full understanding but I believe is as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're representing his attributes and just as he and his ction and his Sovereign Grace has called you and and manifested salvation to you that's a time when the bride stands in that position of authority and imparts of Grace and a Salvation to those that didn't deserve it and we get to reflect the very attributes of Jesus Christ and that's to be revealed we don't know that hour but I wouldn't want anybody to think that's a way to go the the only way of Salvation is in this day's God's provided place and that's Jesus Christ and we haven't received another gospel we've received Jesus Christ that's right over in Luke 24: 36 and this is I think is another level of Grace and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you but they that were but they were terrified and AF fright and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts the word was still Discerning the very thoughts and Tents of the heart behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones but as ye see me have and God's intent is to reveal himself in flesh that's right your flesh that people can see and know and inquire what is the Hope Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you have that calling to say look and see isn't this not what the scripture said would would take place and Faith declares that you know when their eyes became opened they knew them and I believe it has effect it reminded me of John Ryan and how he proclaimed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed but the faith that we have is the Royal Seed of Abraham this is in the end time signed seed that's the faith that's the Royal Seed of Abraham that's the kind of seed that takes God's word that's the thing that'll bring the that'll bring the bride that is the thing that'll meet Christ he is the word and if the church is swed with something else besides the word it can't go to meet him he hasn't got a freak body with a fungus on it he's got a perfect body and he is the perfect word and the church will be sewed and believed in the perfect word the perfect word and the perfect word will unite together as one flesh and be one body as the husband and the wife is amen I'm not amening myself but amen means so be it I believe it amen you know that's the type in an identity to me that becomes real is the identity that a wife has with her husband and that's the identity of a that reflects who the husband is is in the in the bride and young men that you you have to recognize that those things when you go to seek a life it's declaring you who you are and that's what Christ has done is he's made a way the moon reflects the sun in his absence as his Heavenly bride you are his reputation what you're adorning yourself with the way you conduct yourself you're reflecting who your husband is and now we've been made a partaker of his grace it's it's it's not that we're anything without him we're only anything by him so this isn't like our boast is that we're walking around with a hotty attitude that I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ but we recognize that as he was so I am we've been made a partaker of his righteousness and the the same way he was on this Earth we've been made a partaker of it maybe in suffering maybe in a lot of things but the the thing I'm thankful for of his righteousness I don't have to accept anything less than his righteousness being born out in my life and if there's something being reflected I know that the love of Christ in me the love I have for him is enough to put that under my foot and to win the victory there's victory in the love of Jesus Christ there's victory in that relationship that that is still where the victory is is in the Divine love of Jesus Christ and when you recognize that while you were yet a sinner he loved you and he died for you and he was willing to identify himself with you when you're in the mud you take a look at the woman at the well they even marveled that he would be talking to that woman of ill repute now imagine as the word comes and discerns her heart and her life and it's speaking to her this could have been written a different way and it could have been and he told her the one you're with now is not your husband straight away she ran away and said how dare you tell me that I'm not living right no there's some that have that response to the word it tells them to clean up it tells them not to put on earrings yet they'll wear their earrings it tells them not to cut their hair but they'll cut their hair I don't wear shorts I honestly think they're stupid I got the worst sunburn in my life in shorts I I'll never wear them again I found I could swim just as good in a pair of pants that's right but the gospel told me that that's a woman's undergarment and that's for a if you go look for it just go look up BSS the big sister Society you'll find a quote for it that's right and there's probably some brothers running around in shorts who think they've got a right to to tell a sister that her shirt's too short and you're wearing her panties sorry that's a little hard but the point is when the words corrective and it's hard as a Son of God it causes a correction doesn't cause an attitude and and we're we're not reformers but by the nature of Christ you know how the word responds right so when the word comes and it challenges you the right response is Lord forgive me as iron sharpen at iron maybe I could do better now in the word of God we're not sitting under Lords who trying to represent their influence on our lives and we're not under a ministry that's putting on Upon Us Grievous things and the Commandments of men that are too Grievous to Bear but this is the law of the Gentile where there's something written upon the heart and it's being put on display a testimony that Jesus Christ is alive of well of my life that's right and that is an intimate personal relationship with you and Christ and and rejoice that when the word comes and it corrects you it's able to make an effectual change because in in the life of an unbeliever they don't don't repent and so by the word things are discerned and we should pray for one another for people to have a true Revelation but this gospel has a mark and it's a mark of righteousness not of a not of an adhering to works because I don't care how much you think you're subscribing to the letter of the law it has to be by the spirit of it and then it's really put on display and the gospels to have that born out let's just have the musicians come look for a time to stop what I hope we understand is that our identity is in Christ that we don't have another place for us to to be restored we don't have another place that we want to seek after to find Comfort but the only place that we have is in Jesus Christ we're positionally placed in him let's just go ahead and stand together I want the only identity that I'm declaring to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I want to give him my whole heart all my being all my mind I don't want none of me if I if I want him to be able to declare himself alive he's the only hope this world's got there's places that I can go that maybe none of you will people come across my path and I may be the only chance they have to see Jesus Christ okay and if I allow this David McGary to live can't offer him any hope but if he's dead and Jesus Christ is alive in me then he could prove himself the same yesterday today and forever and I know you can go with me and before our father and ask him to do only what he can do to identify himself with us the same that his love for us hasn't changed same love that drove him to Calvary is the same love that's here [Music] tonight that he can still open blinded eyes we still break the bread of life and that he's present with us let's just pray Heavenly Father we know you're here because your word declared you to be Lord and in faith we say that's the truth regardless of whether we feel you or not you're here Lord and where you are you're the light Darkness has to flee where you are blinded eyes are open and where you are good things happen father we believe you're here because we have a present truth you sent by a prophet Lord and that's what we've gathered around is that body word Jesus Christ Lord I ask you'd meet each person's desire according to your word Lord that they would give you their whole heart their whole mind all that they are be nothing held back lord in possessing all things it's because our identity is in Jesus Christ you're the only reason we can possess the gates of our enemy Lord so may you be so real to us now we pray in Jesus name things that are to be brother Brandon would say now then if it was Jesus was the fullness of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth and was manifested in flesh you were here in him then because he was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him you were in him when he was on the Earth birth you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh that means so much nowadays that means so much to us to see yourself positionally placed in Jesus Christ now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we cannot live by the world we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is that word word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living article of God a living attribute of God displayed to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living amen let's sing this together [Music] I [Music] conf all because I [Music] he the [Music] living sing that oh God [Music] they in J oh he came [Music] to he land for GL live and [Music] to my and is I sa oh [Music] I [Music] can all is [Music] God I know yes I I know he holds my future and is worth the living just because it is oh and one day oh oh I cross that how my life far [Music] nowu oh and I oh his way to Victory oh I see the light of glory and out [Music] heing [Music] oh oh and I [Music] oh all fear [Music] is [Music] Holy I know yes I know he my [Music] f and is wor the living because hallelujah what a wonderful word amen every day you work up the word of God tells you something different it tells you your mind belong to me you're not what your job calls you you're not what people call you you are mine you belong to me amen I like that brother renham says the only book that tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going everything else tries to figure it out and you know they try to paint it in a different picture and you know they'll tell you they'll make you understand why you're depressed and why you're supposed to be depressed but this takes the depression away you know everything else will try to make sense of whatever you're going through no this tells you like it is you are a sinner it saves you from sin into righteousness of God oh my I like that quote in the formation of the Bride in the end time the Lord Jesus himself making himself known you know it's amazing because you go through I don't know who I was talking to we have so much education about this religious world and and we get so full of the way things are supposed to be and then you hear the message it just breaks all of those principle away everything you've been told is a lie I was born a sinner I'm trying to please God the more good I do then I'll get to heaven I'm forgiven for my sin then I need to make sure I don't sin no more those that the father have given me will come didn't die for the sin of the whole world only those that the father had given me and he says the the World Hears when they speak but they don't hear when I speak because they're not mine but you when the word speaks something within your heart receives the word the children of disobedient they cannot receive it because there's nothing to do with them but the children of obedience when they hear it something within the heart basically said father I want to obey that word I want to leave that word I I want to everything that that word says I want to be your very identification you have not chosen me but I have chosen you you didn't make yourself Christian I made you a Christian you didn't choose what family you were born in and how you were going to come in all of Dad if you didn't choose that how are you going to choose God you didn't choose the natural you didn't choose the spiritual he makes all of that happen that's right and all we are as the children is we love the father's word as Jesus said don't you know I must be about my father's business what is the father's business the word of God whatever he says is what we believe Amen to walk by it amen that's the desires of our heart that regardless of what we're going through what situation we find ourselves in when we hear it let's just the heartbeat of God begin to beat in you let it overcome all that's around you let and that you may Surrender Your Life to that word and become one with that word that's what we desire above all things not that we can have some position somewhere or be known someplace no but we may be exactly what the identification is at the end time the word of God manifested for the age that we are living in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he hasn't changed is the same yesterday today and forever let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful Lord and Lord your word is true Lord your word is our righteousness father father father when it speaks there's so so much peace that it brings in our hearts and father it doesn't matter what's going on and every time we hear that word it just brings the calmness and the peace in our heart and to know that everything will be okay Lord because we believe as our brother spoke that your word has the power of transformation Lord and father we know that when you spoke it within it was the very power that created the world in existence Lord that when we hear it even tonight Lord it that same power is in existence to bring us in line with the very very things that you have spoken about us Lord no doubt when we look into the mirror Lord we see the shortcomings and inability it is Lord but father your Prophet came in this evening time and he said that we were tricked into that marriage but father even before we were shown down here before we came down here Lord and your Prophet said that you put the wedding ring of predestination on us that we would come already married Lord that the second wedding was not if the second marriage was not even to be counted it was a lie of the devil and the word of God in this end time came to break that cloud of lies and expose all the lies that the devil caused and to make us realize who we are father there's not another word that would bring us that reality except this message Lord It's the only thing that brings the reality of the Living God in the end time father if there be one here that's still living under the life father we pray that you give us that Revelation oh God that would cause us to walk like a son to walk like a daughter to act like the way you would like us to act oh father that would break the cloud away and expose the lives of the devil and bring us into that image of that perfect son oh God lead us to the way of righteousness Lord and forgive our unbeliev fill us with your Revelation Lord and that we may walk by it we ask that you bless our brother Lord everything that is poured out and even the very word that you spoke in his mouth Lord may you just multiply it in our midst tonight Lord that any the word that we heard tonight father help us that the devil may not cause us to reason it but let it drop into our hearts and and produce the purpose which you have spoken it because your scripture says father you don't speak in vain and you don't speak V in void Lord this says that the word that goes out it will bring forth that which you have spoken it for father we remember those that are sick and Afflicted and as we go out of here Lord we pray that you go with each and every one of us Lord and be with us until we meet again if you will and remember our pastor and sister as we commit them to your hands we lift you up tonight for all that you do Lord help us Lord and we love you and we ask those things in the very name of the Lord Jesus Christ pra amen hallelujah amen K amen in Christ alone my hope is found it's my life my strength my song all this cor snow all
