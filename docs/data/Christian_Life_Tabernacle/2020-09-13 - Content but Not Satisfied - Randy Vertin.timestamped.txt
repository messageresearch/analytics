[27:07] so well with kind of the
[27:10] feeling on my heart this evening you
[27:12] know i feel like
[27:14] we can take even a deeper meaning to
[27:15] that we've heard the voice of the lord
[27:17] for our day
[27:18] and it told of his love to us amen he
[27:21] opened a word to us
[27:22] to show us just how much he loved us
[27:26] we know brother branham said god showed
[27:28] proved his love to us by his election
[27:31] by choosing you before the foundation of
[27:33] the world he
[27:34] proved his love to you amen and we've
[27:36] all heard that
[27:37] that voice in this hour and what is our
[27:40] desire is to rise up in faith
[27:43] to be drawn so close to him that we draw
[27:46] him out of heaven unto ourselves amen
[27:48] amen let's uh thank you musicians we're
[27:50] just going to go right into the word
[27:53] i said maybe we'll sing a song at the
[27:55] end of the
[27:56] the service lord will and we'll see what
[27:58] the lord would have
[28:00] let's turn uh if we could into
[28:04] the book of philippians
[28:09] i was really blessed this morning by the
[28:10] word that was that was preached
[28:14] you know i i appreciate brother billy
[28:17] for yielding himself but
[28:18] i thank the lord most of all because we
[28:20] know that was straight from the
[28:22] the throne of heaven amen you know we're
[28:25] we're not here to hear from a man you
[28:28] know you'll be sorely disappointed if
[28:29] you're here to hear from me because i
[28:30] don't have anything for you
[28:32] but if you come an expectation to hear
[28:34] from god you'll get exactly what you
[28:36] have need of
[28:37] amen the lord never disappoints amen
[28:39] he's
[28:41] i like that song he's an on-time god he
[28:43] may not come when you want him but he'll
[28:44] be there right on time
[28:45] amen so we we don't want our own will
[28:48] but we want his amen so let's start
[28:50] at uh chapter four and we'll read uh
[28:54] verses 10 through 13 these are familiar
[28:56] scriptures and then
[28:57] if you just want to keep it in your mind
[28:58] we're going to go to the the book of
[29:00] first timothy
[29:02] chapter 6 after that he said but i
[29:06] rejoiced in the lord greatly
[29:08] that now at the last your care of me
[29:10] hath flourished again
[29:11] wherein you were also careful but you
[29:13] lacked opportunity
[29:15] not that i speak in respect of want for
[29:17] i have learned in whatsoever state i am
[29:19] therewith to be content
[29:21] i know both how to be a based and i know
[29:23] how to abound
[29:24] everywhere and in all things i am
[29:26] instructed both to be full and to be
[29:28] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[29:31] i can do all things through christ with
[29:32] strengtheneth me amen
[29:34] now let's turn to the book of first
[29:36] timothy chapter 6.
[29:42] some familiar scriptures here and we're
[29:45] going to do a little bit of reading uh
[29:46] just verses 1 through 11.
[29:50] it says let let as many servants as are
[29:53] under the yoke
[29:54] count their own masters worthy of all
[29:56] honor that the name of god and his
[29:58] doctrine be not blasphemed
[30:00] and they that have believing masters let
[30:02] them not despise them because they are
[30:04] brethren
[30:04] but rather do them service because they
[30:06] are faithful and beloved partakers of
[30:08] the benefit
[30:09] these things teach and exhort if any man
[30:12] teach otherwise and consent not to
[30:13] wholesome words even the words of our
[30:15] lord jesus christ
[30:17] and to the doctrine which is according
[30:18] to godliness he is proud knowing nothing
[30:22] but doting about questions and stripes
[30:24] of words whereof cometh envy strife
[30:26] railings evil surmisings perverse
[30:29] disputings of men of corrupt minds
[30:31] and destitute of the truth supposing
[30:34] that gain
[30:34] is godliness from such withdraw thyself
[30:38] but godliness with contentment is great
[30:40] gain
[30:42] for we brought nothing into this world
[30:43] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[30:45] out
[30:46] and having food and raiment let us be
[30:48] there with content
[30:50] but they that will be rich fall into
[30:52] temptation to the snare
[30:53] into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[30:55] which drown men
[30:57] in destruction and perdition for the
[30:59] love of money is the root of all evil
[31:01] which while some coveted after they have
[31:03] erred from the faith that have pierced
[31:04] themselves through with many sorrows
[31:07] but thou will man of god flee these
[31:09] things and follow after righteousness
[31:11] godliness faith love patience
[31:15] meekness amen let's just bow our heads
[31:17] and word of prayer
[31:18] heavenly father lord we've as we sang
[31:21] the song
[31:23] lord we've come to we want to draw
[31:25] nearer unto you this evening oh god we
[31:27] haven't come
[31:28] lord as we heard our brother even speak
[31:30] during the song service not because of a
[31:32] ritual
[31:33] lord not just because we feel some just
[31:36] obligation lord to be here but we've
[31:38] come come lord because
[31:39] we desire to draw nearer unto you lord
[31:42] and we know that your word says as we
[31:44] see that day approaching to come
[31:45] together
[31:46] even the more lord and we see the hour
[31:49] is so dark lord and
[31:50] gross darkness lord covering even the
[31:53] people
[31:54] darkness that could be felt lord but we
[31:57] we've come under the light of your
[31:58] glorious gospel for this
[32:00] hour lord lord where you said lord jesus
[32:03] that
[32:03] if we would walk in the light as you
[32:05] were in the light lord we could have
[32:06] fellowship with you lord jesus and we've
[32:08] come lord to
[32:09] strengthen that fellowship lord to have
[32:11] a deeper walk with you a deeper
[32:12] understanding
[32:14] more sincere hearts lord more lord
[32:18] minds that are more pure than they were
[32:19] before hearts that are more cleansed
[32:21] than they were before lord we want
[32:23] to distance ourselves from anything
[32:24] that's not like you lord jesus
[32:26] lord we come to hear from you this
[32:29] evening we pray that
[32:30] every distraction everything of the
[32:32] outside world that would try to
[32:34] worm its way into the minds or the
[32:36] people lord to distract us we just bind
[32:38] every spirit that would be contrary to
[32:40] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[32:42] lord for your word said that whatever we
[32:43] bind on earth will be found in heaven
[32:45] lord when we bind anything contrary to
[32:47] you lord that you would
[32:48] lord have your preeminence in the
[32:50] service and amongst your people lord may
[32:51] you just get me out of the way
[32:53] lord may the people have their hearts
[32:54] open to receive your word lord not the
[32:56] words of a man
[32:57] and we ask that in all things you would
[32:59] be glorified and you would have the
[33:00] preeminence in the name of the lord
[33:01] jesus christ we pray
[33:02] amen amen you may have your seats
[33:10] i was just so blessed this morning and
[33:13] i'm always
[33:14] appreciative of the how the lord works
[33:16] because
[33:17] you know you you know i hear i hear
[33:21] brother his brother
[33:22] billy was ministering this morning i
[33:23] just heard a few things that just struck
[33:25] me
[33:25] and said lord that's that's just exactly
[33:27] the thought that the lord have kind of
[33:28] been putting on my heart
[33:30] to minister and even talking with
[33:31] brother matthew in the back there before
[33:32] the service of how
[33:33] it's just so powerful how the lord will
[33:35] just he always dovetails the things
[33:36] together
[33:38] and you know we we understand as
[33:39] believers that we don't have none of
[33:41] these things happen by accident
[33:42] we don't believe in coincidences just
[33:45] things to happen just to happen
[33:47] you know we i believe in a god that's
[33:49] purposeful
[33:50] you know we're whereas man we we are
[33:52] certainly
[33:53] prone to just whims of our own desires
[33:56] that maybe don't
[33:57] don't profit anything oh today i want to
[33:59] do this or do that why just because i
[34:00] feel like doing it
[34:01] maybe you don't have a purpose behind it
[34:03] other than that you just like to do that
[34:05] thing whatever
[34:06] it might be but god we understand
[34:08] doesn't do anything without a purpose
[34:10] so and i i just say that as a maybe just
[34:12] even before we get fully into it
[34:13] in your own life when you see these
[34:15] things happen take note of those things
[34:17] we ought to we ought to take hold of
[34:19] those things and understand that god is
[34:21] ordering the footsteps of his chosen
[34:24] people
[34:25] amen these things don't happen by
[34:27] accident amen
[34:28] so we want to i just maybe want to
[34:31] if i could say it in a way i know
[34:33] sometimes things that are preached and
[34:35] in the in the hour that we live in it
[34:37] people you know we
[34:38] we have uh we have that saying you know
[34:41] you probably heard of people get
[34:42] triggered
[34:43] that's kind of the saying that they have
[34:44] now is people say something and they
[34:46] kind of pull back and oh my you're just
[34:48] trying to say something to hit something
[34:50] and you know and someone to get them
[34:52] upset or something that
[34:53] and if anything's said i just pray that
[34:56] the lord
[34:56] would allow you to take it not as a
[34:58] condemnation
[35:00] you know i was even hearing this morning
[35:02] about you know uh brother
[35:03] brother billy just talking about these
[35:05] things it's not we're not talking about
[35:06] a condemnation
[35:08] but as a believer we take conviction
[35:10] amen we don't we're not taking
[35:12] we're not under condemnation but the
[35:14] lord will the holy ghost will bring us
[35:16] to conviction
[35:17] of the things in our lives that we need
[35:19] to work on or things that
[35:20] we need to put before the lord and maybe
[35:22] put on the altar sometimes
[35:24] amen but and maybe not take things as a
[35:27] condemnation but as
[35:28] a challenge is what i want to do so
[35:30] maybe to this evening
[35:32] i would like to to maybe lay a challenge
[35:34] before the people of god
[35:36] and maybe you know maybe some things
[35:37] that come across as harsh and things and
[35:39] i don't know
[35:40] however the lord would bring it out i
[35:41] know sometimes maybe i yell a little bit
[35:43] and
[35:43] i don't want to seem like i'm just
[35:44] screaming at you but you know we're not
[35:46] wrestling against flesh and blood
[35:48] and and you know each one of us is
[35:50] different i just speak loudly if you
[35:52] knew my family i'm probably one of the
[35:53] quietest out of all of them
[35:55] so if you knew my mom and dad my mom and
[35:57] dad their conversations are like a shout
[35:59] out when i was growing up so i just just
[36:02] pray you take it in the spirit that that
[36:04] it's meant to be given
[36:06] so tonight we want to speak on just
[36:08] because we like to give titles to things
[36:10] and
[36:10] and just i feel like it was confirmed by
[36:13] even
[36:14] some of the things that were spoken this
[36:15] morning but the message we want to speak
[36:17] on this evening is
[36:18] content but not satisfied
[36:22] so if i just want to hold that in your
[36:23] heart as we're ministering this evening
[36:25] as being content but not satisfied
[36:29] and i want to take that in a positive
[36:30] light you know not as a condemnation but
[36:33] as a
[36:33] as a challenge to us as believers in
[36:35] this hour
[36:37] so we understand in the book of
[36:38] philippians here paul is speaking of the
[36:40] the carnal things and then he brings it
[36:42] up he's like he's saying how
[36:45] you've desired to minister these things
[36:47] unto me and all these wonderful things
[36:48] and he's speaking of the believers
[36:49] trying to help him out even naturally
[36:51] he said you've desired to bestow these
[36:53] things upon me and i appreciate that
[36:55] he says but not that i speak in respect
[36:57] of want physical desires
[37:00] he says but i've found that whatever
[37:02] situation
[37:03] that i'm in i find i have to be content
[37:07] with it
[37:08] and now we're talking about a physical
[37:10] situation
[37:11] because in this hour the lord is trying
[37:14] to bring his bride
[37:16] his his people have to come to a place
[37:20] where we are divorced from the physical
[37:23] things of this world
[37:25] and i'm speaking not just and understand
[37:27] we have to there are things we have to
[37:28] eat we have to drink we sleep these
[37:30] things
[37:31] but i'm speaking of the carnal things
[37:33] see we often times
[37:35] we're so we're so i thought
[37:39] physically lazy and when i say again i'm
[37:42] going to say some things that may sound
[37:43] harsh but i want you to
[37:44] take it we're believers this evening see
[37:46] we're i'm not here we're not here to
[37:48] condemn anybody
[37:49] or put you out but it's a challenge to
[37:51] us to bring us higher okay
[37:53] and so when i'm talking about laziness
[37:55] i'm speaking about
[37:57] the attitude of this h that we have to
[38:00] contend with
[38:02] see we're in the world but not of the
[38:04] world and because
[38:06] we're in the world we contend with the
[38:09] spirits of this world
[38:11] and we understand we're actually not
[38:13] even just dealing with this age
[38:15] but the culmination of all the ages and
[38:18] spirits that came before
[38:21] we see it beginning to manifest itself
[38:24] by the insanity of the age
[38:27] amen we see if you have just this little
[38:30] bit of a spiritual discernment
[38:32] you can see that spirit of persecution
[38:36] of the dark ages
[38:37] right at the door ready to pounce just
[38:40] an absolute
[38:41] hatred and almost a foaming at the mouth
[38:44] a desire what if the scripture says as
[38:46] it was in the days of noah
[38:48] what does it say it says he said the
[38:50] earth was filled with violence
[38:53] it says the the imagination of man's
[38:56] heart was only evil continually
[38:58] they're devising these evil devices
[39:01] against the people of god
[39:02] and make no mistake we're seeing the
[39:04] political climate
[39:07] but what is it it's only a physical
[39:09] manifestation
[39:11] of the spiritual battle that's taking
[39:13] place right now
[39:15] that's all it is see we look we look at
[39:18] politics and you can get so caught up in
[39:20] it
[39:20] but all it is is a microcosm
[39:23] it is it is merely just a glimpse
[39:26] physically
[39:28] because we understand that hell is hath
[39:30] enlarged herself
[39:32] hell our prophet told us hell is
[39:34] literally pressing its way
[39:36] into this world it is manifesting itself
[39:40] have you ever seen is there ever been an
[39:43] age
[39:44] where the people could just wickedness
[39:46] it's just tolerated
[39:48] it's just it's just expected the
[39:51] wickedness of the people
[39:53] paul even i believe it was paul he said
[39:55] he said it's even a shame
[39:56] to speak of the things that they do in
[39:58] secret
[40:00] see but it's just accepted by the world
[40:03] and as we're coming down this line we
[40:06] understand
[40:06] that as hell is pressing its way so is
[40:10] heaven
[40:11] pressing its way into a bride
[40:14] now it may be smaller in number we're
[40:17] coming up to that tip of that pyramid
[40:19] brothers and sisters
[40:20] it's getting smaller and smaller it's
[40:23] getting more and more fine
[40:24] it's sifting out that word
[40:28] is we call it the thinking man's filter
[40:30] but it is literally
[40:31] filtering out all the things of the
[40:34] world
[40:37] see and what i'm talking about is this
[40:40] world is putting such an emphasis on the
[40:42] carnal things
[40:44] that in so many ways we find it's
[40:47] infiltrated the churches
[40:49] we find it's infiltrated the people of
[40:51] god why because
[40:53] we don't see we do not see the fervency
[40:58] that we ought to see we don't see the
[41:01] burning we just heard our pastor preach
[41:03] on it and we had other services
[41:05] that were kind of coming in the same
[41:06] vein and i'm kind of going in that same
[41:08] line
[41:09] we don't see the manifestation of that
[41:12] thirst
[41:13] that that painful desire
[41:17] to see the word of god manifested now
[41:20] now i'm not to say that it's not there
[41:22] again see the devil's going to be right
[41:24] there in your ear to say oh that you're
[41:26] just not even a bride you're not even
[41:27] believer no that's not the case
[41:29] but we got to become clear in our vision
[41:33] to understand that in this age
[41:36] the only way is to remain
[41:39] in that place in the shekinah glory
[41:42] it's the only way outside of that is
[41:44] going to be death
[41:46] because as that thing is narrowing down
[41:48] and narrowing down and narrowing down
[41:51] all outside of that is getting filtered
[41:53] out why because
[41:54] the shock isn't air with the seed the
[41:57] seed is not here with the shock
[41:58] so it's even coming down to the point
[42:01] that the shock
[42:02] is pulling itself away completely pulls
[42:05] itself away
[42:07] and we understand that as these things
[42:09] come that the pools are still there on
[42:11] the flesh
[42:14] and if we're not careful this this world
[42:17] has exalted education it's exalted
[42:21] prosperity look at our nation
[42:24] i mean if you think about that the
[42:26] obsession that they have with wealth
[42:29] that they're just people are just
[42:31] completely completely glossed over
[42:34] and if we're not careful he said
[42:36] supposing even the christians have fault
[42:38] we see the prosperity preachers out
[42:40] there
[42:41] we see that we say oh there's no way it
[42:43] could affect us but how
[42:44] see it doesn't have to be the big boogie
[42:47] man
[42:48] but it's that it's that little fox that
[42:50] spoils the vine
[42:52] it's that little thing getting out of
[42:54] the will of god
[42:55] that one little thing here and there one
[42:58] decision made for the wrong reason
[43:00] that piles one on top of the other on
[43:02] top of the other
[43:03] why because we've got to have
[43:05] discernment brothers and sisters
[43:07] there's got to be a time where we are
[43:10] content
[43:11] with the things of this world that god's
[43:13] given us
[43:15] you know but the world is trying to tell
[43:17] you got to have a better house
[43:19] you got to have a better car you got to
[43:20] have the best food
[43:22] you got to have the best clothes you got
[43:24] to have the best friends
[43:25] you got to have the best church you got
[43:27] to have the best school you got to have
[43:28] the best grades
[43:29] you got to have this and you got to have
[43:31] that but all that stuff
[43:33] is going to perish and even now it is
[43:38] perishing
[43:41] he said it's certain we took nothing
[43:43] into this world and we're taking nothing
[43:45] out
[43:46] but we're building kingdoms on this side
[43:49] for what just so there's more to destroy
[43:53] in the in the tribulation in the
[43:54] in the fiery judgments what does it
[43:58] profit
[43:58] us to build upon the foundation that
[44:02] we've received
[44:04] we've received the foundation of perfect
[44:06] faith in this hour
[44:08] we've received a perfect word that's
[44:10] building us up into a statue of a
[44:12] perfect man
[44:13] but paul said well he said be careful
[44:16] how every man builds thereon
[44:18] one's gonna build with stubble one's
[44:20] gonna build with straw and don't worry
[44:22] one's gonna build with stones and
[44:24] precious stones and these things
[44:26] but the day will declare what you've
[44:29] been building
[44:31] and it's time that we brought ourselves
[44:34] into a place
[44:35] where we have separated ourselves and
[44:37] have taught you know what devil
[44:39] i've got enough of this world i got
[44:42] enough
[44:42] you know what i love i love what paul
[44:44] said he says
[44:46] he said therefore having food in
[44:49] let us be content he never even said
[44:52] anything about houses
[44:54] he didn't even say why that goes with
[44:56] the word doesn't it because
[44:57] he said jesus said foxes have holes and
[44:59] bird have nests but the son of man has
[45:01] no place to lay his head
[45:02] see paul was right in line he said i got
[45:04] food and clothing
[45:06] that's enough other than that give me
[45:08] jesus
[45:10] but see we got to have the best
[45:11] everything why because we're the united
[45:13] states
[45:14] we're the richest country supposedly
[45:18] at least it looks like it for now don't
[45:19] worry it's going to crumble
[45:21] don't you worry about it your stocks
[45:23] that you're building up for your
[45:24] retirement's going to crumble
[45:26] don't worry your 401k is going to reach
[45:28] zero one day
[45:29] don't you worry about it because it's it
[45:32] can't do anything else but fail
[45:34] because those things are built upon
[45:36] man's ideas
[45:40] and here's the thing are we content with
[45:43] what god has given us
[45:45] are we content with our place in the
[45:48] body
[45:50] or are we
[45:53] or are we looking to fulfill someone
[45:55] else's place
[45:56] are we looking to like has i believe it
[45:59] was hezekiah
[46:01] or i'm sorry uzziah looking to fulfill
[46:03] the place of a priest when it wasn't his
[46:05] place
[46:07] are we looking why because what happens
[46:09] it's it's the
[46:10] it's that the covetousness of the age
[46:13] look at the age that we live in
[46:14] all the people around they fought their
[46:16] money
[46:18] they thought their beauty what they
[46:19] consider beauty they flaunt this and
[46:21] they thought that what is it
[46:23] their desire that it's breeding a spirit
[46:26] of lust and covetousness because
[46:29] everybody
[46:30] the only reason brother branham he spoke
[46:32] about it he called it keeping up with
[46:33] the joneses
[46:34] that's exactly what it is it's what is
[46:37] it it's you see
[46:38] something someone else has you say i
[46:40] want to have that
[46:41] so what is it your motivation's wrong to
[46:43] begin with
[46:44] why because you're you're motivated not
[46:47] by a need of your family
[46:49] not by your need to live not by
[46:52] something the lord has told you to do
[46:54] but it's literally he said you have not
[46:56] because you asked not
[46:58] and why do you have that he said because
[47:00] you asked upon your love that you may
[47:02] devour it upon your lusts
[47:06] and many times we're just not honest
[47:07] with ourselves about why we want
[47:10] something
[47:13] i want to be content if the lord
[47:15] stripped me down and i had nothing
[47:17] i say lord i will be content with what
[47:19] you give me
[47:20] see but but the devil's reversed it
[47:23] he's made us content with where we're at
[47:26] in christ
[47:28] but not satisfied with what we have of
[47:31] worldly goods
[47:34] when the lord tells us to be the
[47:35] opposite content with the things that we
[47:38] have of this world
[47:40] but we cannot be satisfied with where we
[47:43] are in jesus christ
[47:47] now don't make no mistake that doesn't
[47:49] mean i'm looking for something new
[47:51] no i'm content with the word that's been
[47:53] given to me but i cannot be satisfied
[47:56] until that word that came forth is
[47:59] showing
[48:00] forth in my life i can't be satisfied
[48:04] with a mediocre christian existence
[48:07] i can't be satisfied with the halfway
[48:10] overcoming
[48:12] i've got to see a perfect overcoming in
[48:15] my life
[48:16] we can't be satisfied we've been
[48:18] satisfied far
[48:20] too long with limping along
[48:24] we've been satisfied with with
[48:27] sin in our families we've been satisfied
[48:31] we've been content to sit there and
[48:33] watch satan
[48:34] ravage families we've been content
[48:37] to sit there and watch satan put
[48:40] sicknesses through our families
[48:41] when those things were put under our
[48:46] feet we're expected
[48:49] to overcome this flesh to a point that
[48:51] we can have a body change
[48:56] where are we at again it's not
[49:00] condemnation it's a challenge
[49:02] because we are the children of god we've
[49:05] received this word
[49:08] but now it's time to take it off the
[49:10] shelf
[49:13] we often james said he said show me your
[49:16] faith without works
[49:17] i'll show you my faith by my works that
[49:20] doesn't just mean the miracles
[49:22] that means even your everyday living
[49:25] that i i'll give you a testimony that's
[49:27] the read that's the scripture the lord
[49:28] gave me when i came up here and played
[49:30] guitar with a busted up looking hand
[49:32] because i said lord i'm tired of sitting
[49:36] here
[49:36] and it's easy to give the lord glory
[49:39] after the miracle is over
[49:42] it's easy but when you can be like job
[49:46] in the middle of the trial when you
[49:48] could be like jonah
[49:50] in the belly of the whale and said yet
[49:52] again when i turned to your holy temple
[49:54] of god
[49:55] in the middle of the trial when you
[49:58] could do that's where he's glorified
[50:01] it's easy to give glory after the
[50:03] victory
[50:04] but try being abraham and gathered up a
[50:07] few servants
[50:08] and going after kings just to get a
[50:10] bachelor nephew
[50:13] but that's the lot for the bride and now
[50:15] that's not no pun intended
[50:17] that is the portion for the bride of
[50:20] jesus christ
[50:22] against all odds can take up arms and go
[50:26] slay the devil
[50:28] and bring back your loved ones that's
[50:31] for you
[50:33] that's your portion
[50:34] [Music]
[50:36] but we've gotten satisfied we're just
[50:38] letting the devil have his part of the
[50:40] land
[50:41] you know when when the children of
[50:42] israel went over jordan and started to
[50:45] conquer
[50:46] what was one of the first things that
[50:47] the devil did he tricked them into
[50:50] making peace
[50:50] with the gibeonites we've made peace
[50:54] with way too many devils
[50:57] we've made peace with them and you know
[50:59] what the excuse was
[51:01] after the fact they said oh we'll just
[51:03] make them huge of wood
[51:04] and drawers of water oh we'll make the
[51:07] best of the situation
[51:08] we'll just turn it around for our
[51:10] benefit you can't turn the devil around
[51:12] but for you can't use no demon for your
[51:15] benefit
[51:20] it's time that we started busting up
[51:23] some of the so-called covenants
[51:25] that we've made with those demons in the
[51:27] land
[51:28] because they didn't say nothing about
[51:29] making covenants and even though they
[51:31] thought they had to keep that covenant
[51:34] there was a greater what he said you
[51:35] slay and take care of that land
[51:38] [Music]
[51:39] amen but the devil's got us all tricked
[51:42] we totally reversed where we ought to be
[51:48] i see a word that was preached in our
[51:50] day
[51:52] that's talking about overcoming power
[51:54] that's talking about bringing us back to
[51:56] an
[51:56] eden condition and it was
[51:59] proofed i had
[52:02] you probably all had this revelation a
[52:04] long time ago but i had that brother i
[52:06] i was thinking about this i was thinking
[52:08] about brother bran i'm up in the
[52:09] mountain with the storm
[52:10] and i've never seen it in such a perfect
[52:12] way before but that was literally the
[52:14] garden of eden
[52:16] literally the garden of eden a
[52:18] manifested son of god
[52:20] established his dominion over nature
[52:25] and immediately after just like abraham
[52:27] had communion
[52:28] with melchizedek walked with them in the
[52:31] garden
[52:33] in the forest i think it was in the
[52:36] morning
[52:36] it wasn't anything cool but what is it
[52:38] even that showing the type
[52:40] we're bringing the rising of the sun
[52:41] back the sun was setting on adam and eve
[52:44] he came in the cool evening now it's at
[52:46] the breaking of the day
[52:48] amen but what was it that is our
[52:51] inheritance
[52:52] dominion over these things and yet we
[52:55] slug along
[52:57] why because the devil has got our focus
[53:00] on other things
[53:01] he's he's got us worried subconsciously
[53:06] consciously whatever it may be we go to
[53:08] work
[53:09] we slave away just to put a little food
[53:12] on the table
[53:13] or fix up the house a little bit or do
[53:15] this or do that
[53:17] then we go here and we go there and and
[53:20] where is god in all of it
[53:23] are we and i'm not again it's not
[53:25] condemnation but we're ne i i've spoken
[53:28] this a lot lately but we need to walk
[53:29] circumspectly
[53:31] we need to be honest with ourselves and
[53:33] we need to start looking to see what is
[53:35] our motivation
[53:36] in everything that we do what's our
[53:39] motivation
[53:40] because in order for the lord to come on
[53:41] the scene we got to have the right
[53:43] motive and objective first
[53:44] that's got to be the foundation
[53:48] you know we don't just walk around you
[53:50] know just fulfilling
[53:52] our own desires that's not what we're
[53:54] called to do
[53:55] we're called to be content with the
[53:57] things of this world
[53:58] but there's see there's a thirst in you
[54:01] that can't be satisfied see you were
[54:03] born
[54:04] for this age you you are born for this
[54:07] age why
[54:08] because there is a thirst and a hunger
[54:10] in you that
[54:11] cannot be satisfied until we see
[54:15] a rapture take place there's no other
[54:18] goal
[54:19] for the bride of christ
[54:23] when it comes to seeing the fulfillment
[54:25] of the word she's got to see it come to
[54:27] pass
[54:28] she's got to see that the only thing she
[54:31] can look forward to
[54:32] is a complete preeminence of jesus
[54:34] christ in her
[54:36] that's what she's looking for she can't
[54:38] be satisfied with anything else
[54:40] there's nothing else to be satisfied
[54:42] with in this age because that's what
[54:44] we're called to fulfill
[54:47] amen you know i think
[54:50] look at look at david you could go all
[54:52] through the scriptures and see how this
[54:53] goes
[54:54] in sam in uh in first samuel chapter 16
[54:57] we know these scriptures
[54:58] and i'm not going to be long tonight
[55:00] since then sabbath took a horn of oil
[55:01] and anointed him in the midst of his
[55:03] brethren
[55:03] and the spirit of the lord came upon
[55:04] david from that day forward so samuel
[55:07] rose up and went to rama
[55:08] so what do we understand david was given
[55:10] a promise right there
[55:12] anointed king now what happened
[55:16] did he immediately ascend to the throne
[55:17] no sir he went back and forth and back
[55:20] and forth and had trouble
[55:22] after trouble after trouble but see
[55:24] there was something in him
[55:27] he could remain see isn't it apparent
[55:29] the people of god are a paradox to this
[55:31] world
[55:32] you will be a paradox unto yourself when
[55:35] the lord starts doing when the lord
[55:37] really starts revealing these things
[55:39] because how could a man
[55:41] like david obviously zealous for the
[55:44] things of god
[55:46] yet knowing that he was anointed king
[55:50] and yet could be content to sleep in the
[55:52] wilderness in the caves
[55:53] to be amongst the heathens to be chased
[55:56] by saul
[55:58] to have all these things happen to him
[56:00] to be spat on
[56:02] to be kicked around all these different
[56:04] things why because
[56:05] he could be content knowing that there
[56:08] was something that lay ahead for him
[56:11] and that's the way the people of god is
[56:14] we can be content
[56:15] it's a paradox to the world how could
[56:18] you be dirt poor
[56:19] and so happy how could you be going
[56:23] through the trials
[56:24] that you're going through and yet you're
[56:26] just seeing like it's all okay
[56:28] why it's because i've got a promise
[56:31] i've got a word and even though
[56:35] even though i'm content with where i'm
[56:36] at there's something in me that won't be
[56:39] satisfied
[56:40] until i see it fulfilled it's a paradox
[56:44] because it would seem to see won't be
[56:46] content but not satisfied well those are
[56:47] two
[56:48] those are opposing things but see it's a
[56:51] paradox to the world
[56:52] it as the world see as they try to feel
[56:55] their lusts and lusts and all these
[56:57] different things
[56:58] they try to fill it with all the drugs
[57:00] they can they try to fill it with all
[57:03] the
[57:03] the the other alcohol or whatever it may
[57:05] be the entertainment all these things
[57:08] it it doesn't feel anything
[57:11] it just leaves a hole behind
[57:15] but when you get a hold of christ when
[57:18] you get a hold of christ one time
[57:21] there's a satisfying portion that comes
[57:26] there's a satisfying portion that just i
[57:30] caught a glimpse of the divine
[57:33] just he comes across your path just one
[57:36] time
[57:37] and that seed is quickened and there's a
[57:40] satisfaction
[57:41] that nothing else can do but there's
[57:44] also a knowing
[57:46] there's a groaning in and of ourselves
[57:48] to see the manifestation of the sons of
[57:49] god
[57:50] but there's a it's a paradox how can you
[57:54] be satisfied
[57:55] and you're not satisfied it's because i
[57:58] can hold a promise
[58:00] just like abraham know that i've got the
[58:03] promise
[58:04] but i will press towards the mark of the
[58:06] high calling
[58:07] until i see it manifested
[58:11] the theme's already there i got some
[58:14] quotes
[58:15] i actually you know i'm just feel to
[58:16] read this now it's a long one so bear
[58:18] with me
[58:19] but i really like this when i was i was
[58:21] reading this and it's in wisdom versus
[58:23] faith
[58:27] he says
[58:31] he says i got a scripture here you might
[58:32] if i read it let's take hebrews the
[58:34] fourth chapter right quick just a minute
[58:35] i want to read this
[58:37] it just looks so good to me right here
[58:38] hebrews 4 and let's get hebrews 4 and
[58:40] start from 1 to 2.
[58:42] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[58:44] being left of us
[58:45] to enter into his rest as of you should
[58:48] seem to come short of it
[58:49] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[58:51] well as unto them
[58:52] but the word preached did not profit
[58:55] them not being mixed with
[58:56] and he says knowledge wisdom faith
[58:59] in them that heard it faith in them that
[59:02] what heard it
[59:04] says you can have all the word you can
[59:06] know the word from a to z
[59:08] and it will never work for you have you
[59:11] seen
[59:12] man take that word and try to make it
[59:14] work say brother glory to god it just
[59:16] won't work
[59:17] you can't fool the word with it no no no
[59:20] no no matter what you profess
[59:22] the word testifies of itself
[59:25] no matter what you claim the word gives
[59:27] the testimony that's right
[59:28] now satan knowed the word he noted from
[59:30] a to z
[59:31] well you know what i imagine if he'd
[59:33] have a degree he'd have enough titles to
[59:35] stretch across four or five pages of
[59:36] paper
[59:37] dr reverend elder p h l l q d all the
[59:40] alphabet in every way
[59:41] his degree would be in that bible he
[59:43] knows every word of it sure he does see
[59:45] so satan said now i know the word i know
[59:48] that he knowed the word when he come to
[59:49] eve
[59:50] so he had to he had it by head knowledge
[59:53] but it wouldn't work
[59:54] jesus noted by faith in the revelation
[59:57] of god's word
[59:59] and his own predestinated life i'll read
[1:00:02] that again
[1:00:04] jesus knowed it by faith in the
[1:00:07] revelation of god's word
[1:00:09] in his own predestinated life amen when
[1:00:12] you see that you've been predestinated
[1:00:15] then you can have faith because until
[1:00:18] then
[1:00:19] you don't know what your relationship is
[1:00:22] you're just groping and hoping and
[1:00:24] wondering
[1:00:25] but when the lord reveals to you what
[1:00:28] you
[1:00:28] are where you stand who you are in
[1:00:32] relation to him
[1:00:34] oh my he says gloria i hope that soaks
[1:00:37] plum
[1:00:37] to your heart jesus knew who he was
[1:00:40] satan was wondering
[1:00:42] he knowed that he was a predestinated
[1:00:44] creature of god
[1:00:46] that god himself was manifested in him
[1:00:50] it wasn't him doing the works it was the
[1:00:52] father that dwelt in him amen
[1:00:54] let the devil fly with all his theology
[1:00:56] hey amen
[1:00:58] i'm going to skip down here just a
[1:00:59] little bit he says now take that back to
[1:01:02] some of these big organizations think of
[1:01:03] it a minute cell
[1:01:04] well we got the word let me see it work
[1:01:08] you catholics you say you're the
[1:01:10] original let's see it
[1:01:11] show me your works without or show me
[1:01:14] your works by or without your faith and
[1:01:15] i'll show you mine by my faith
[1:01:17] see see what the word said can you plant
[1:01:20] now this is where i just was so blessed
[1:01:22] because this
[1:01:23] just seemed to dovetail with this
[1:01:24] morning he says can you plant a seed
[1:01:26] without it manifesting what it is if
[1:01:28] it's growing
[1:01:30] you can't it must manifest itself
[1:01:34] it is a law from the very beginning god
[1:01:37] established that law that every seed
[1:01:40] would bring forth of its kind
[1:01:42] amen he says he says can you plant a
[1:01:46] seed without it manifesting what it is
[1:01:48] if it's growing now that's the big
[1:01:50] question is it growing
[1:01:52] can you plant a grain of corn without
[1:01:54] making corn if it grows
[1:01:57] can you plant a potato unless it raises
[1:01:59] a potato
[1:02:01] can you plant a flower without being
[1:02:03] that kind of flower
[1:02:05] then if you're sowed and the seed of god
[1:02:07] in your heart
[1:02:09] it's got to produce that jesus said
[1:02:12] he shall do my works if he believes me
[1:02:15] if he says he believes it and these
[1:02:17] don't follow him
[1:02:19] he's a liar he that believeth on me
[1:02:22] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:02:25] even more than this for i go to my
[1:02:27] father why it's strong
[1:02:30] but just don't hit the skinning place
[1:02:31] and slide off over on some rocks
[1:02:33] somewhere
[1:02:34] it'll just fall down in the valley so
[1:02:36] that the winds can't blow it away
[1:02:38] and the fowls can't get it it'll grow
[1:02:40] hide it down in your heart
[1:02:42] amen and then just down a little bit
[1:02:44] farther he says then
[1:02:45] if jesus defeated satan upon the faith
[1:02:48] knowing who he was
[1:02:49] he was a predestinated creature see
[1:02:52] that's where he defeated satan
[1:02:55] he knew who he was and by knowing who he
[1:02:59] was in the word
[1:03:00] he knew what he was predestinated to
[1:03:04] manifest
[1:03:06] does that do does that make sense can i
[1:03:08] say that again
[1:03:09] by knowing he was predestinated
[1:03:13] and knowing he was predestined in the
[1:03:15] word
[1:03:17] that showed him what he was going to
[1:03:20] manifest
[1:03:23] so is it with the bride it's been
[1:03:26] revealed in our day
[1:03:28] to show us what we're to manifest
[1:03:32] we're to manifest a garden of eating
[1:03:35] again
[1:03:36] oh it may not be the natural eating but
[1:03:39] that spiritual eating
[1:03:41] as a prophet upon a mountain say speak
[1:03:44] to the storm
[1:03:45] and said it will you go back to where
[1:03:48] you came from and you won't go you won't
[1:03:50] snow or nothing for four days or
[1:03:51] whatever it was until we're done
[1:03:53] and nature obeyed him and then god comes
[1:03:57] down and says well give me just walk
[1:03:58] together a while
[1:03:59] what is that that was just a foretaste
[1:04:03] just a little piece of what he's got for
[1:04:05] you
[1:04:07] i don't know about you i can't be
[1:04:09] satisfied
[1:04:11] until i see that in my life i there's i
[1:04:14] have
[1:04:15] i have to see it why because
[1:04:18] i've been i don't know again i can't i
[1:04:21] can't preach a revelation to you
[1:04:23] can't give it to you i can't give you a
[1:04:25] revelation i can only tell you what the
[1:04:27] lord's given to me
[1:04:28] and i know he called me i know he
[1:04:30] elected me
[1:04:31] i know he filled me with his spirit why
[1:04:34] because i've seen him manifest
[1:04:36] and he puts something in my heart that i
[1:04:39] you can't explain it
[1:04:41] but all i know is that once you've
[1:04:43] received it
[1:04:44] you can't be satisfied with anything
[1:04:47] less
[1:04:47] than the fulfillment of the promise that
[1:04:50] he gave to you
[1:04:52] that's why abraham couldn't do anything
[1:04:56] other than to continue walking and to
[1:04:58] believe
[1:04:59] why because it ain't he couldn't it said
[1:05:02] he hoped against hope
[1:05:05] he he called he looked crazy it's about
[1:05:08] time we started looking crazy
[1:05:10] he called those things that were not as
[1:05:13] though they were
[1:05:14] abraham you're dead yeah so what i'm
[1:05:16] still going to have it
[1:05:19] yeah look at look at sarah she's her
[1:05:21] womb's dead yeah so what i'm still going
[1:05:23] to have it
[1:05:25] craziness what but it forces you to a
[1:05:28] place
[1:05:30] just like the children of israel in the
[1:05:32] desert it
[1:05:33] forced them to a place see joshua and
[1:05:36] caleb
[1:05:37] could not be satisfied until they saw
[1:05:41] the fulfillment of that promised land
[1:05:44] that's why god had to keep them alive
[1:05:46] because there was something in them that
[1:05:48] could not be satisfied
[1:05:50] there was a revelation that caleb added
[1:05:53] so much he said give me my mount
[1:05:57] that promise was promised to me way back
[1:05:58] then it's about time i got it
[1:06:01] and that's where we're at those promises
[1:06:04] have been promised to us
[1:06:05] it's about time we got it give me my
[1:06:08] mountain
[1:06:13] but you got to know who you are you've
[1:06:16] got to have faith in that
[1:06:19] why because once you have faith in that
[1:06:21] and then you start to see
[1:06:23] well if that's who i am this is what i
[1:06:26] this is what i will be this is what i am
[1:06:29] becoming
[1:06:31] this is what i am now well
[1:06:34] we heard this morning the seed's already
[1:06:36] there
[1:06:38] everything for little reverend lily that
[1:06:41] he needed
[1:06:43] he didn't have anything added unto him
[1:06:45] when he was in the muck
[1:06:47] it was already there the only thing he
[1:06:50] needed
[1:06:51] was that sun just kept shining and he
[1:06:54] just kept taking it in
[1:06:56] he was in the he was in the muck in the
[1:06:58] mire but he's pulling the water he's
[1:07:00] pulling the sunshine
[1:07:01] and he just keeps growing he it was
[1:07:04] already there
[1:07:05] it has no choice the life has to live
[1:07:08] it has to because it is what it is it's
[1:07:11] life
[1:07:13] and if that life being you that it has
[1:07:16] to live
[1:07:17] and there's something in you that can't
[1:07:19] be satisfied
[1:07:21] with worldly things oh yeah we've tried
[1:07:24] we've all been there we tried to satisfy
[1:07:27] it you couldn't do it
[1:07:31] you couldn't you know you couldn't do
[1:07:32] enough drugs
[1:07:34] you couldn't you couldn't watch enough
[1:07:36] movies you know you could you couldn't
[1:07:39] listen to enough gossip why
[1:07:42] because there's something in you the
[1:07:45] seed
[1:07:45] can only i see the world has a perverted
[1:07:48] saying of
[1:07:48] opposites attract that may be true
[1:07:51] according to the flesh
[1:07:52] but let me tell you what brothers and
[1:07:53] sisters in god's economy
[1:07:55] like attracts like that's why
[1:07:58] when eve came out he said this is bone
[1:08:00] of my bone this is flesh of my flesh
[1:08:03] jesus says to his bride this is spirit
[1:08:05] of my spirit
[1:08:07] see this is like attracts like it's not
[1:08:09] we're not looking for the opposite but
[1:08:11] we're looking for the same
[1:08:13] the lord is not coming back to a bride
[1:08:15] that looks different from him
[1:08:19] god to be the same and we're going to
[1:08:21] read this here in just a little bit i'm
[1:08:22] going to keep reading here
[1:08:25] he said then if jesus defeated satan
[1:08:27] upon the faith knowing who he was
[1:08:29] he was a predestinated creature are you
[1:08:30] ready what about the predestinated bride
[1:08:33] of jesus christ now
[1:08:35] do you believe the bride's predestinated
[1:08:37] the predestinated bride of christ now
[1:08:40] the church the word seed
[1:08:42] with everything that god promised to put
[1:08:44] in the church
[1:08:45] in it right now
[1:08:50] let me read that again he says he says
[1:08:53] the predestinated bride of christ now
[1:08:55] the church the word seed
[1:08:57] how many of you are part of that amen
[1:09:00] with everything that god promised to put
[1:09:03] in the church
[1:09:04] what are all these things he promised to
[1:09:05] put in the church we're looking for we
[1:09:07] see a five-fold ministry
[1:09:09] we see we just see nine spiritual gifts
[1:09:11] operating within the framework
[1:09:12] of the local assembly we see we see a
[1:09:16] spoken word power manifested in this day
[1:09:18] to show us
[1:09:19] we're going even beyond those things
[1:09:23] he says where is it it's in it right now
[1:09:27] it's in it now everything's in order
[1:09:30] the holy spirit's been given the seed's
[1:09:33] been sowed
[1:09:34] the evening lights has been shining the
[1:09:36] sign of sodom that jesus promised is
[1:09:39] here
[1:09:40] if it was true back then where are we at
[1:09:43] now
[1:09:45] hallelujah oh my all the people
[1:09:49] followed away left and right from the
[1:09:50] message oh we didn't see this and we
[1:09:52] didn't see that
[1:09:53] are you kidding me they they
[1:09:57] they didn't have an excuse back then
[1:09:58] because they got to see the signs for
[1:10:00] themselves
[1:10:01] they got to see the discernment in
[1:10:02] person anybody can sit there and say oh
[1:10:04] just hear it on a tape
[1:10:06] oh that doesn't prove it happened you
[1:10:07] weren't there yeah that's right i wasn't
[1:10:09] there but you listen to those tapes and
[1:10:10] tell me what he preached isn't happening
[1:10:12] right now
[1:10:14] you're under greater condemnation
[1:10:16] because that was something he wasn't
[1:10:18] even seeing
[1:10:19] and we're seeing it fulfilled right now
[1:10:22] and people want to walk away in this
[1:10:23] hour
[1:10:25] lord have mercy but we're seeing it
[1:10:28] fulfilled
[1:10:30] the sign of sodom that jesus promised is
[1:10:32] here in malachi 4 a predestinated church
[1:10:34] he says oh devil church of the living
[1:10:37] god hearing on tape 2
[1:10:38] do you know where you stand do you know
[1:10:41] that you are called of god that the holy
[1:10:44] ghost range in your heart
[1:10:46] and every word of god is real to you oh
[1:10:49] brother
[1:10:50] how's satan going to stand against that
[1:10:52] oh my
[1:10:53] how could he stand against that but you
[1:10:56] have to answer the first part of that
[1:10:57] question to get to that point
[1:11:00] holy ghost range in your heart i believe
[1:11:02] we got a lot of us with the holy ghost
[1:11:04] but maybe we aren't letting them reign
[1:11:06] in our lives the way we ought to let him
[1:11:08] reign
[1:11:09] have we truly made him lord of all
[1:11:15] you go listen to uh the message with
[1:11:17] brother branham
[1:11:18] door to the heart he's talking about all
[1:11:20] these little doors
[1:11:22] we like to lock them off and keep them
[1:11:23] closed they got to barricade it up lord
[1:11:25] says i gotta go in there and clean that
[1:11:26] out
[1:11:28] i gotta go that's what the holy ghost is
[1:11:29] here for is to clean us out
[1:11:33] that's why you know i'm not even gonna
[1:11:35] say that i don't i don't wanna go there
[1:11:37] i'm not trying to defend any i don't
[1:11:38] wanna offend anybody but that's what the
[1:11:40] holy ghost is here for it is to clean us
[1:11:42] up
[1:11:42] the holy ghost is here to straighten
[1:11:45] this bride out
[1:11:47] straighten us out because we need
[1:11:49] straightened out because i tell you what
[1:11:51] brothers and sisters
[1:11:52] you can't tell me we are manifesting
[1:11:55] what our prophet told us this bride
[1:11:57] would manifest right now
[1:11:58] in its fullness we we're not seeing all
[1:12:00] of we're seeing pieces
[1:12:02] remember it's not condemnation it's a
[1:12:04] challenge
[1:12:05] because i'm content with the things that
[1:12:07] i've got i am so grateful
[1:12:10] to see even the spiritual thing i'm
[1:12:11] content with this word
[1:12:13] you can't tell me that this isn't that
[1:12:15] true that this message isn't right
[1:12:17] we know it's true we see it manifested
[1:12:20] in in little pieces i feel like i said
[1:12:22] it's glimpses here and there but there's
[1:12:25] more
[1:12:26] for the bride the the world may get
[1:12:29] their little glimpses
[1:12:29] yeah it may not be an open show whatever
[1:12:31] all those things but i can't be
[1:12:33] satisfied
[1:12:35] until i see perfection in me
[1:12:39] i'm not talking perfection to the flesh
[1:12:42] i'm talking about a perfect
[1:12:43] manifestation of christ's life in me
[1:12:46] perfect love divine love
[1:12:49] the only thing that'll enter there has
[1:12:52] got to be manifested
[1:12:55] we can't that's the bar for this hour
[1:12:59] we're at the capping time it's the
[1:13:01] capstone time
[1:13:03] and remember like has to attract like
[1:13:07] i'm going to read that we're going to
[1:13:08] get to it in just a second but you're
[1:13:09] going to see
[1:13:10] it has to match the character
[1:13:14] has to be the same for the capstone to
[1:13:17] come down
[1:13:19] it's got to be the same for that uniting
[1:13:21] time
[1:13:23] because christ can only unite with with
[1:13:25] with himself
[1:13:27] why because we're bone of his bone flesh
[1:13:29] of his flesh spirit of the spirit word
[1:13:31] of his word life of his life
[1:13:33] you can't join to anything else
[1:13:36] amen so let's let's just continue
[1:13:38] reading here
[1:13:40] he says he says how is he going to stop
[1:13:43] that from growing house
[1:13:44] i'll say oh brother how's satan going to
[1:13:45] stand against that how is he going to
[1:13:47] stop that from growing
[1:13:49] how is he going to keep them signs from
[1:13:51] following
[1:13:52] why you could throw them in jail they if
[1:13:54] you could i don't care what you do they
[1:13:55] don't tried it
[1:13:57] they rotted in the jails they was fed to
[1:13:59] lions they were sought asunder they were
[1:14:00] burnt to pieces
[1:14:02] you can't kill it right a church that's
[1:14:04] predestinated
[1:14:06] those who he foreknew like he did jesus
[1:14:08] he has called
[1:14:10] those who he has called he is justified
[1:14:12] though he is justified he is already
[1:14:13] glorified predestinated
[1:14:15] and now in the last days with every seed
[1:14:18] sowed
[1:14:19] everything in order the world in its
[1:14:21] order
[1:14:22] the time shaped up the church in its
[1:14:24] order
[1:14:25] the seed the evening lights the signs of
[1:14:28] like he said as it was in the days of
[1:14:30] sodom
[1:14:32] brother brothers and sisters if you knew
[1:14:34] some of the things that are going on in
[1:14:35] this world
[1:14:36] and what politics is pushing through it
[1:14:38] would chill you to your bone
[1:14:40] we are in sodom
[1:14:43] we are in sodom
[1:14:47] and it it's only going to be the grace
[1:14:48] of god
[1:14:50] because if if you think it's bad now
[1:14:54] when you can't even speak of anything of
[1:14:55] morality without people wanting to throw
[1:14:57] you out or get you fired from your job
[1:14:59] we haven't even seen the manifestation
[1:15:01] of it yet brothers and sisters this is
[1:15:03] this this is just uh uh uh adolescent
[1:15:06] version
[1:15:08] brother branham saw the baby seed we're
[1:15:11] seeing an adolescent version but
[1:15:12] brothers and sisters let me
[1:15:13] tell you believe you me it's growing up
[1:15:15] quick
[1:15:17] you've got to know who you are you got
[1:15:19] to know where you stand
[1:15:21] and if you and if if there's any part of
[1:15:23] you that is longing
[1:15:25] for worldly things you want a better
[1:15:27] career you want a better school
[1:15:29] you want to have all these things you
[1:15:30] better watch yourself
[1:15:32] because it's all going to perish anyway
[1:15:35] they're already
[1:15:36] there i've got i got a story on the
[1:15:38] thing i've got a uh uh
[1:15:40] like an article that i read they're
[1:15:42] already starting to make it where
[1:15:44] certain people can't buy or sell
[1:15:47] there's certain people out there already
[1:15:48] that get blacklisted from like visa and
[1:15:50] mastercard
[1:15:51] they won't let them process payments for
[1:15:52] their businesses because they don't
[1:15:54] agree
[1:15:55] with what they believe in that's just
[1:15:58] just a little
[1:15:59] that's coming down the pipe where are we
[1:16:03] where we where are where are we to be in
[1:16:06] christ
[1:16:08] it ought to give us a desperation and
[1:16:09] i'll give us that painful thirst
[1:16:12] oh my he said those are his call he's
[1:16:15] justified everything in order
[1:16:16] the evening lights the signs like he
[1:16:18] said it says last things he promised and
[1:16:19] we see
[1:16:20] that we are right here where okay i'm
[1:16:22] going to go down just a little bit
[1:16:23] farther
[1:16:25] he says he says what did
[1:16:28] what did satan do when he met jesus he
[1:16:30] flew into him with all the
[1:16:31] ecclesiastical force he had
[1:16:33] i know the word also flew into him that
[1:16:36] denominational dust he had we'd throwed
[1:16:38] it right onto him but didn't have any
[1:16:40] life did he ever fly off did he he come
[1:16:42] off a lot quicker than he flew on
[1:16:44] why he hit that 100 billion volt wire
[1:16:47] there he singed his feathers
[1:16:49] he come off of him he come out of him
[1:16:51] because that wire
[1:16:52] had volt in it remember satan had a wire
[1:16:55] too
[1:16:56] but no matter how nice copper the wire
[1:16:58] is if it hasn't got no life in it it's
[1:17:00] dead
[1:17:01] she won't act the same wire one's got
[1:17:03] energized from the dynamo
[1:17:05] and the other one has no connection at
[1:17:07] all that's right that's the reason it'll
[1:17:09] work in a predestinated vessel
[1:17:11] that's the reason the word will work
[1:17:14] where it's connected connected where
[1:17:15] with the denomination no sir
[1:17:17] that's a dead socket having a form of
[1:17:19] godliness denying the power but
[1:17:21] connected with the word
[1:17:23] which never shall pass away and could
[1:17:25] produce the same power at
[1:17:26] every time that's where it's at glory
[1:17:29] amen amen do you love him will you serve
[1:17:30] him amen
[1:17:32] sure not hooked into some organization
[1:17:34] but hooked into the dynamo here brother
[1:17:36] i'm telling you it works there
[1:17:38] because it's hooked up the same word now
[1:17:40] i want you to listen here
[1:17:42] just a little bit farther i know i'm
[1:17:43] reading a lot but i just i felt there's
[1:17:44] so much here
[1:17:45] it's rich moab was hooked in two
[1:17:49] and israel was also now i want you to
[1:17:51] want you to see the distinction here
[1:17:54] okay we under we've heard these before
[1:17:56] but i really want you to understand
[1:17:58] where we're at moab was hooked in two
[1:18:01] and israel was also moab had nothing but
[1:18:04] dead
[1:18:05] bunch of creeds and a false prophet but
[1:18:08] israel had a smitten rock
[1:18:10] a brass serpent a pillar of fire
[1:18:12] hallelujah
[1:18:13] signs of a living god that's exactly it
[1:18:17] worked
[1:18:18] why it was on faith yes sir not on
[1:18:21] knowledge
[1:18:22] not man-made creed but on faith in the
[1:18:24] word the word itself
[1:18:26] life comes from the word so knowing that
[1:18:29] if we are there where israel was
[1:18:32] we've had a pillar of fire we've had a
[1:18:35] prophet
[1:18:36] we've had a ministry that came and
[1:18:38] vindicated itself
[1:18:40] so if that's the case then then it has
[1:18:43] to produce
[1:18:44] the same thing now because it did then
[1:18:48] we know the denominations are the moab
[1:18:51] they're out there serving dead creeds
[1:18:53] they can't produce anything it's void of
[1:18:56] life
[1:18:57] sure they'll have their janice and
[1:18:58] jamborses maybe they'll have their
[1:19:00] different things happen over there but
[1:19:02] there will be no life in it why
[1:19:04] it can't reproduce itself amen
[1:19:08] is it that current he says life comes
[1:19:10] from the word my word is life
[1:19:12] that current comes through the word
[1:19:15] satan got off there right quick
[1:19:17] his theological dust didn't do very good
[1:19:19] right there
[1:19:20] satan's wire had no current in it it was
[1:19:22] dead creeds
[1:19:23] it won't it won't current now see it's
[1:19:25] the same wire
[1:19:27] jesus used the father's word satan used
[1:19:29] the father's word
[1:19:31] satan was satan jesus was god that's the
[1:19:34] difference
[1:19:34] i like that amen
[1:19:38] it would say like this satan is satan
[1:19:41] but the bride is him she becomes him
[1:19:45] so it's got to have the same result
[1:19:48] we heard brother billy preach this
[1:19:50] morning it's got to be the same
[1:19:53] we're not looking for a watered down
[1:19:55] experience here
[1:19:57] that nicholaten spirit that that our
[1:20:00] pastor just mentioned a little bit here
[1:20:02] and there
[1:20:03] that's that's the spirit that gets the
[1:20:06] people
[1:20:07] out of expectation to see god in their
[1:20:10] lives
[1:20:11] why because it puts everything on the
[1:20:14] ministry
[1:20:15] it puts everything out of the preachers
[1:20:18] they turn them into priests
[1:20:21] and then what happens then the priests
[1:20:23] see you go back to the church age book
[1:20:24] brother man talks about it that
[1:20:26] decollete and spirit comes
[1:20:27] and then what happens the preachers
[1:20:29] start to rank one another
[1:20:31] who's who's the greatest one over here
[1:20:33] who's this why that's the gentile way
[1:20:36] is comparing one with another
[1:20:39] always trying to get dominion over one
[1:20:40] or the other and see we see that
[1:20:44] where are we at and a lot of times it's
[1:20:46] not even the preachers
[1:20:47] but the people long for it we see it in
[1:20:50] the word
[1:20:51] with israel god desired to rule over
[1:20:54] them
[1:20:54] and it was them who came to samuel and
[1:20:56] said we would have a king
[1:21:00] forcing their hand and so lord says i'll
[1:21:03] give them one i'll show them what kind
[1:21:04] they'll have
[1:21:05] and that's exactly what happened but we
[1:21:08] are going the opposite way but we've got
[1:21:11] to be so careful
[1:21:13] because going back to that laziness
[1:21:15] thing
[1:21:16] why because it because it's easy
[1:21:19] to sit back and put all the work
[1:21:23] on the clergy or whatever you want to
[1:21:24] call it it's easy oh
[1:21:26] the pastor will take care of it you got
[1:21:29] a part
[1:21:30] you you have a part the pastor can't
[1:21:33] even do his part
[1:21:34] without you doing your part we can't be
[1:21:37] effective
[1:21:38] as a body but we've got to stop being
[1:21:42] contented with worldly things we've got
[1:21:45] to stop being satisfied spiritually with
[1:21:47] worldly things
[1:21:48] and thinking oh we're just okay in this
[1:21:49] state no there ought to be something
[1:21:52] there's got to be a crying out there's
[1:21:55] got to be a crying out
[1:21:56] there's got to be a desperation when the
[1:21:58] time of the promise drew near for the
[1:22:00] children of israel
[1:22:01] in the land of egypt they started crying
[1:22:04] out to god
[1:22:05] why because they can see this is the
[1:22:08] time
[1:22:09] where is this deliverance that we've
[1:22:12] been promised
[1:22:14] it's for the bride right now we ought to
[1:22:17] be looking at this message
[1:22:18] and crying with everything in our hearts
[1:22:21] where is this rapture
[1:22:23] where is this perfect life
[1:22:26] lord we're getting the answer it's in
[1:22:28] you already
[1:22:30] and say lord if that's the case reveal
[1:22:33] to me
[1:22:34] what's blocking the channel what's the
[1:22:37] thing
[1:22:38] that we're what's the what's called a
[1:22:40] glass ceiling what's that glass ceiling
[1:22:43] what is it we've got when the time
[1:22:47] came near and they're getting ready to
[1:22:48] leave in the first exodus what was it
[1:22:50] they had to go through that house with
[1:22:53] and look for every little bit of leaven
[1:22:56] every little piece they i think they
[1:22:58] dramatized they'd go through with a
[1:22:59] candle into every nook and cranny
[1:23:01] looking for that leaven when's the last
[1:23:03] time we really went down
[1:23:07] you know the description you can go
[1:23:08] legalistic with it if you're not careful
[1:23:10] but i tell you i often think about david
[1:23:13] said i shall set no wicked thing before
[1:23:15] mine eyes
[1:23:16] you ever thought about that evil phone
[1:23:18] you're carrying around
[1:23:20] just imagine whenever a little pop-up i
[1:23:22] had showed up on your phone that showed
[1:23:24] you something wicked
[1:23:25] just think about putting it down for an
[1:23:26] hour do you think you'd ever pick up
[1:23:28] that phone more than
[1:23:29] maybe an hour a day unless it's always
[1:23:31] on the bible app
[1:23:32] or on the message or the table or
[1:23:34] whatever it might be no
[1:23:36] but what do we do we're he that those
[1:23:39] things they just
[1:23:40] they weasel their way in but the the
[1:23:42] lord
[1:23:43] if the dove is leading the lamb
[1:23:47] and the holy spirit remember he's timid
[1:23:50] how often by our attitudes the things we
[1:23:54] set before our eyes brother we've been
[1:23:56] called brothers and sisters we've been
[1:23:57] called to be holy
[1:23:59] it's not we're not righteous we're
[1:24:02] called to be
[1:24:02] holy
[1:24:06] yeah he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:24:08] still
[1:24:09] he that is filthy let him be filthy
[1:24:10] still he that is righteous let him be
[1:24:12] righteous still
[1:24:13] he that is holy we've been called to
[1:24:16] that
[1:24:16] higher calling we've been called to
[1:24:19] holiness
[1:24:21] he said godliness with contentment is
[1:24:23] great gain
[1:24:25] i think we just let so many things slip
[1:24:27] into our lives
[1:24:29] they look innocent they oh i tell you
[1:24:32] and this is going to
[1:24:33] make you think i'm crazy that's okay i'm
[1:24:35] just going to tell you
[1:24:36] i was i go i run a lot i like to run i
[1:24:38] like to get out there and run
[1:24:40] and and try to get myself into a little
[1:24:42] bit of shape because
[1:24:43] i you know i i like to eat too much and
[1:24:45] the lord gave me some victory over that
[1:24:47] by the grace of god
[1:24:48] but i like to get out there and run and
[1:24:49] get out in nature and just enjoy like
[1:24:51] the sky and everything and and i tell
[1:24:54] you what i was running
[1:24:56] this was yesterday and i was running to
[1:24:58] do running
[1:24:59] and i looked down and i see this little
[1:25:00] green looking stick looked like a stick
[1:25:04] and it was a snake it was just a little
[1:25:06] like little baby probably a little
[1:25:07] garter snake or something like that it
[1:25:08] wasn't very big it was probably
[1:25:09] probably not even thicker than a pencil
[1:25:12] and i've seen different snakes before
[1:25:14] and i usually
[1:25:14] just kind of sidestep them a little bit
[1:25:16] i'm not i'm even though i like nature i
[1:25:18] don't know a lot about it
[1:25:19] so i wouldn't be other than a
[1:25:21] rattlesnake because it's got the little
[1:25:22] rattle i wouldn't be able to probably
[1:25:23] tell you about anything else
[1:25:24] but i don't i tell you you may think i'm
[1:25:27] crazy maybe think i'm cruel that's okay
[1:25:29] i ran past that snake about 10 yards and
[1:25:32] something in my head said go back and
[1:25:33] kill that snake
[1:25:36] i i was like you know what and i i will
[1:25:39] be honest i've had that
[1:25:41] i've had that unction before when i've
[1:25:42] seen little ones in there and some of
[1:25:44] them were too big i was like nah i can't
[1:25:45] do nothing with that
[1:25:46] i don't know and this one i said you
[1:25:48] know what i'm going to go do it
[1:25:50] you know you call me it's fine you call
[1:25:52] me crazy if you want maybe you say oh
[1:25:54] you're carnal but i went back
[1:25:55] i said you know what i said i said devil
[1:25:58] i'm putting my
[1:25:58] i'm putting my heel on your head right
[1:26:00] now and i stopped that thing like fi
[1:26:01] i think i stomped it five times
[1:26:05] that thing wouldn't die i'm telling you
[1:26:07] i think it was because my you know your
[1:26:09] shoes are rubberized cushioning so it
[1:26:10] was kind of bouncing on them a little
[1:26:12] bit
[1:26:14] i i know it sounds silly but i i just
[1:26:17] something in me
[1:26:18] but you know what i thought i said you
[1:26:19] know what that little snake looks so
[1:26:21] innocent
[1:26:23] but you give that thing time and it's
[1:26:24] going to grow up
[1:26:26] it's going to be a big snake just like
[1:26:28] oh
[1:26:29] in the old testament they were so cruel
[1:26:30] killing all those little baby amalekites
[1:26:32] yeah but that baby amalekite was going
[1:26:33] to grow up to be
[1:26:34] a big amalekite the little baby anik
[1:26:38] was going to grow up to be a goliath
[1:26:41] yeah that's what they were they're the
[1:26:43] sons of anak giants
[1:26:45] that little he was maybe just maybe even
[1:26:46] a big baby maybe a 12 pound baby for all
[1:26:48] i know
[1:26:49] but he was still a baby he was good and
[1:26:51] gone and looking really innocent
[1:26:56] but the devil that's how he comes in and
[1:26:59] it's about time we recognize that
[1:27:00] brothers and sisters
[1:27:02] i don't know what it is i i don't know i
[1:27:04] don't know
[1:27:05] i'm not gonna call one specific thing
[1:27:07] out of what it is i don't know
[1:27:09] but we better be so careful
[1:27:12] because the things that look innocent
[1:27:14] there's a spirit
[1:27:15] behind everything
[1:27:19] i don't care if it's the cutest looking
[1:27:21] little cartoon character
[1:27:22] you better watch out i got brothers
[1:27:26] now up in ohio they told me back when
[1:27:28] they were children they
[1:27:30] seen the visions of the demons just look
[1:27:33] just like scooby-doo
[1:27:35] look like he-man tempting them trying to
[1:27:37] call them over
[1:27:39] why because they're from the pit of hell
[1:27:42] and all the things that look innocent
[1:27:43] you better pray over it bro if you've
[1:27:45] got children
[1:27:46] you better pray over those things before
[1:27:48] you just let anything into your house
[1:27:50] yeah you and you brothers that have
[1:27:53] children and all these things you better
[1:27:54] rule your house
[1:27:56] because you'll be responsible when
[1:27:59] things go wrong
[1:28:00] it's like oh lord why is it because you
[1:28:02] weren't there to toe the line
[1:28:04] we let down the bars i'm preaching to
[1:28:08] myself i got to be circumspect
[1:28:10] paul said paul said i got to be careful
[1:28:12] lest i become a castaway
[1:28:15] this isn't just limited to just me or
[1:28:18] just one person or just the
[1:28:19] preachers or the song the song leaders
[1:28:22] or the
[1:28:22] musicians and different things no every
[1:28:26] one of us
[1:28:28] and i think we got a lot of maybe
[1:28:31] babylonious garments
[1:28:33] maybe bad maybe gold wedges hidden in
[1:28:35] the tents
[1:28:38] and i'll be perfectly honest sometimes
[1:28:40] it's become so common we may not even
[1:28:42] know it's there anymore
[1:28:44] and he's just just like a snake could be
[1:28:47] there
[1:28:47] he worms its way in there you never even
[1:28:49] know it was there anymore because he's
[1:28:50] underground he's hiding
[1:28:52] but what is it it's tainting your life
[1:28:55] and you don't even know it
[1:28:58] you know i i i don't know i just feel to
[1:29:00] leave
[1:29:01] to give give you some of these things
[1:29:02] and i'm not trying to say you have to go
[1:29:04] you go by whatever revelation the lord
[1:29:06] gives you
[1:29:07] because i i don't know what easter with
[1:29:08] i just know what i've been through
[1:29:10] but when the lord brought me out of a
[1:29:12] really dark period of my life
[1:29:14] i just i i got before the lord i started
[1:29:16] praying i was crying out the lord i said
[1:29:18] lord
[1:29:18] i said i need i need to know what do i
[1:29:22] need to get rid of what what is if there
[1:29:25] are
[1:29:25] are there things here that i don't even
[1:29:26] know and i remember it's crazy to sound
[1:29:29] the first thing that the lord popped in
[1:29:30] my head was you got a whole thing full
[1:29:31] of basketball cards
[1:29:33] you need to get rid of that i had i
[1:29:35] brought i had michael jordan cards i had
[1:29:37] all kinds of things that might have been
[1:29:38] worth some money
[1:29:39] i said lord i'm just gonna get rid of it
[1:29:41] i toss that thing out
[1:29:43] i tell you i tell you what brothers and
[1:29:44] sisters you call it what you will
[1:29:47] but i hadn't had so many spiritual
[1:29:48] dreams and things that the lord brought
[1:29:50] to pass in my life
[1:29:51] when i did that sincerely before god
[1:29:54] but but within a couple weeks the lord
[1:29:56] had manifested things through a couple
[1:29:58] dreams
[1:29:59] and brought things to pass in my life
[1:30:02] that i know were supernatural that led
[1:30:05] me
[1:30:06] to completely dropping everything i had
[1:30:07] and moving from colorado to iowa and all
[1:30:09] these different things
[1:30:11] why because we i was obedient to god and
[1:30:14] and i think we've come to a point if
[1:30:16] we're looking for an exodus brothers and
[1:30:17] sisters
[1:30:18] if we're looking and i know i've been
[1:30:20] probably going a lot longer than i
[1:30:21] planned
[1:30:21] if we're looking for an exodus then it's
[1:30:23] time to prepare to meet your god
[1:30:27] it's time to sanctify yourselves it's
[1:30:29] time to look
[1:30:30] you know what i would i tell you what i
[1:30:32] would rather be a fanatic
[1:30:35] going too far into holiness
[1:30:39] i'm telling i'm not talking about
[1:30:41] legalism
[1:30:42] because you got to be so careful there's
[1:30:44] a balance
[1:30:46] and and that stuff ain't gonna save you
[1:30:49] but i i tell you what that dove
[1:30:53] he's he's tender-hearted he he's he's
[1:30:56] meek he's lowly
[1:30:58] he said he says take my yoke upon you
[1:31:01] and learn of me he said for i am meek
[1:31:02] and lowly in heart
[1:31:04] see we and we we always think of it oh
[1:31:06] it's just better all over but
[1:31:08] the holy ghost is a gentleman he's not
[1:31:10] looking
[1:31:11] for this bullish attitude of just oh
[1:31:13] we're just doing this
[1:31:14] in spirit we have a boldness we know who
[1:31:17] our enemy is
[1:31:18] but when it comes to the things of god
[1:31:20] we ought to be so we ought to be so
[1:31:22] sensitive we ought to be just so
[1:31:25] sensitive to the things of god
[1:31:27] if if it would be oh that
[1:31:30] that thing is just the wrong color but
[1:31:32] the lord doesn't want me to have it
[1:31:33] why because maybe the lord's just
[1:31:35] testing you
[1:31:36] have you ever thought about that so so
[1:31:39] many times
[1:31:40] when lord why would you have me do that
[1:31:41] well maybe he just wants to see if
[1:31:42] you're willing to obey
[1:31:46] are you are you willing to give that up
[1:31:49] or are you going to elevate it above
[1:31:50] above
[1:31:51] god's revelation for you i don't know
[1:31:53] what that is
[1:31:54] all i'm saying is we've got to come to a
[1:31:56] place where these worldly things are
[1:31:58] just meaningless to us because we can't
[1:32:01] take it with us
[1:32:02] we will take nothing with us but this
[1:32:04] character that he's giving us now
[1:32:06] the holy ghost that seed that he placed
[1:32:08] within us
[1:32:09] all right i'm just going to finish
[1:32:10] reading and then we'll close here he
[1:32:12] says this is the last little thing here
[1:32:14] he says you know what i believe the
[1:32:16] seed's been sowed
[1:32:18] would you believe that for that great
[1:32:20] church
[1:32:21] just like the wires has been laid
[1:32:23] through the building
[1:32:24] every socket been tested by the word oh
[1:32:26] my every outlet tested by the word
[1:32:29] they get not strange when fiery trials
[1:32:31] come
[1:32:32] it's to test you see that's the thing
[1:32:36] and so many times isn't that that what
[1:32:39] the devil does to us
[1:32:40] we the lord puts us into a test
[1:32:44] and we fail fall flat on your face how
[1:32:46] many ever failed test
[1:32:47] i mean let's just be real we're humans
[1:32:49] we fail the test
[1:32:51] but i i we fall flat on our face and the
[1:32:54] devil
[1:32:54] he's the accuser so he's right there to
[1:32:57] accuse you
[1:32:59] oh you're nothing you were never a
[1:33:00] believer anyway when
[1:33:02] and instead we just get on our we get on
[1:33:04] our little ash heap and say oh it must
[1:33:06] be true i couldn't be a believer if i
[1:33:08] failed this test no
[1:33:10] the lord the reason you test
[1:33:13] is so that as we're we're going to talk
[1:33:15] about here the reason he's testing
[1:33:18] is so he can get everything wired up
[1:33:20] just right
[1:33:22] so when he flips the switch the power
[1:33:25] can flow
[1:33:27] so don't take it see it's not a
[1:33:29] condemnation
[1:33:31] it's a conviction and it's a challenge
[1:33:33] to the believer
[1:33:35] to draw unto him closer
[1:33:38] get these things out that we're not
[1:33:40] supposed to have
[1:33:42] knowing why because we're not going to
[1:33:43] be satisfied until he flips that switch
[1:33:46] we can't be i can't be satisfied until
[1:33:49] we see that holy ghost power
[1:33:51] and it's coming i tell you what it's
[1:33:54] coming it's here now
[1:33:56] but it's also coming amen
[1:33:59] he said every outlet tested by the word
[1:34:01] he said if there's a little short there
[1:34:02] it ground blow the whole switch
[1:34:04] god don't want them in his church there
[1:34:07] ain't going to be no switch
[1:34:09] blowing in this no fuse blown in this
[1:34:11] last days no sir
[1:34:13] he comes back and he welds her in there
[1:34:18] i like that he comes back and he welds
[1:34:21] there in their right
[1:34:22] yes sir all right every light's hanging
[1:34:25] in its place
[1:34:26] amen that's me i'm a light i want to be
[1:34:28] hanging in my place
[1:34:30] amen the only thing waiting for the
[1:34:32] master back there
[1:34:33] to turn on the switch yes sir in the
[1:34:36] word
[1:34:36] sure it could be right now brother if
[1:34:39] you need healing
[1:34:40] just touch the switch that's all you
[1:34:42] have to do
[1:34:43] if you got a real wire if you're
[1:34:45] grounded if your line is grounded the
[1:34:47] connections
[1:34:48] to have been lost in jesus tell you what
[1:34:50] to do amen that's right
[1:34:52] so what is it these trials coming out we
[1:34:54] fuse blow
[1:34:56] say praise the lord for the test let me
[1:34:59] go fix it
[1:35:00] lord weld it in there right get that
[1:35:03] thing fixed up
[1:35:04] in me so then everything clear out the
[1:35:06] channels so you can flow
[1:35:08] don't how many do we want to see the
[1:35:10] spirit of god amongst the people
[1:35:13] i see it in our people i see it
[1:35:17] just like our pastor says we're
[1:35:18] believers
[1:35:20] but don't we want to see
[1:35:23] an ananias and sapphire gospel
[1:35:26] oh that scares people but that's what we
[1:35:29] have to have
[1:35:31] when sin couldn't even walk through that
[1:35:33] door without being called out by the
[1:35:34] holy ghost
[1:35:36] why when the shekinah glory would be so
[1:35:39] thick in here people could see it with
[1:35:40] their eyes
[1:35:42] till till the prophecies tongues and
[1:35:44] interpretation would go forth
[1:35:46] not not just like what we call pentecost
[1:35:48] now where
[1:35:49] they just repeat scriptures our brother
[1:35:51] rayon talked about what say
[1:35:53] oh brother you brother over here go here
[1:35:55] on this day to do this and you shall
[1:35:57] have what you ask
[1:35:58] that's the god that i serve that's
[1:36:01] what's promised for us why because
[1:36:02] that's the book of acts
[1:36:04] that's going to be written behind this
[1:36:06] word
[1:36:07] you say oh brother we don't need that
[1:36:08] anymore i'll tell you what the last
[1:36:10] sermon brother branham preached
[1:36:11] communion
[1:36:12] he said that's what's coming
[1:36:16] in the in the in the in the sermon
[1:36:18] communion
[1:36:20] i had to write it down because i forgot
[1:36:21] to print it but i wrote it down in the
[1:36:23] back real fast
[1:36:24] and this paragraph i said he says you
[1:36:25] know the hour will soon arise
[1:36:28] when right among us will be the holy
[1:36:31] spirit
[1:36:32] will speak out like it did in ananias
[1:36:34] and sapphira
[1:36:36] remember see that hour is arriving see
[1:36:39] and we are now you just remember that
[1:36:41] see god is going to dwell
[1:36:44] among his people that's what he wants to
[1:36:47] do
[1:36:48] now and he is dwelling among his people
[1:36:52] he's here we've had it vindicated
[1:36:55] amen we know the words right
[1:36:59] we know he's never left us he's
[1:37:02] manifesting himself
[1:37:03] in different ways amongst us but they're
[1:37:06] but we're
[1:37:07] but i can't i can't be i'm not satisfied
[1:37:10] with where i'm at now why because i've
[1:37:12] got a promise
[1:37:14] of more to come i
[1:37:17] i'm not looking for something different
[1:37:19] i'm looking for this word in his
[1:37:21] fullness
[1:37:23] i'm not looking see oh oh you're just
[1:37:25] trying to look to go here and go here no
[1:37:26] sir
[1:37:27] i want to see what i was promised come
[1:37:29] to full manifestation
[1:37:31] abraham wasn't satisfied
[1:37:34] with a hagar experience when god said
[1:37:38] you'll have it by sarah
[1:37:40] he wasn't satisfied just with
[1:37:43] can i say it this way without sounding
[1:37:45] sacrilegious
[1:37:47] he wasn't satisfied with just the
[1:37:49] promise
[1:37:51] i want to go beyond revelation to a
[1:37:54] manifestation
[1:37:58] i'm grateful for the revelation i see it
[1:38:00] in the word we see it in the world
[1:38:03] i want to see a full manifestation
[1:38:08] i'm talking about myself it's not see it
[1:38:10] all goes
[1:38:11] individuals and as a body
[1:38:16] we're all part of each other and i hope
[1:38:18] this is okay
[1:38:19] i know maybe i take it as a challenge
[1:38:22] it's not to condemn the people of god
[1:38:24] but let's let's reach
[1:38:26] higher it's already in you to do it
[1:38:30] say and say lord what is it what must i
[1:38:34] do because we got a part to play it's
[1:38:37] not just about my works
[1:38:38] bringing me righteousness or any such
[1:38:40] thing but lord we preached about it
[1:38:42] before by stepping into the vision
[1:38:44] where what part am i to play what part
[1:38:47] of the vision do i need to be
[1:38:49] in what what part of the vision do i
[1:38:52] need to step into
[1:38:53] to see that manifestation come to pass
[1:38:56] to see your power manifested more
[1:38:59] he'll reveal it to you he will he's
[1:39:02] revealing it to us
[1:39:03] each and every one as we're growing and
[1:39:05] growing and growing that seed remember
[1:39:07] it has to produce
[1:39:09] that seed's in you it's been quickened
[1:39:11] it's growing
[1:39:13] but as we sing that song at the end of
[1:39:15] this morning servants it's manifesting
[1:39:16] time
[1:39:18] the fruits are on the vine amen and the
[1:39:20] lovely ones coming into plain view
[1:39:22] amen let's stand
[1:39:28] i'm just excited for what god's doing
[1:39:31] so don't take it as just a balling out
[1:39:34] or anything like that
[1:39:36] i'm ex i'm an expectation
[1:39:39] because i i've seen just a little
[1:39:41] glimpse of what god's got for us
[1:39:44] oh my i'm tasting i've seen that the
[1:39:47] lord is good
[1:39:49] i've seen it but i want more and i can't
[1:39:53] be satisfied
[1:39:54] with anything less than him
[1:39:58] maybe just as the last little thing
[1:39:59] especially the young people
[1:40:01] you are bombarded every second of every
[1:40:04] day
[1:40:06] with just thing after thing trying to
[1:40:09] tell you you got to have this
[1:40:10] you got to have that you got to get this
[1:40:13] job you got to get this education
[1:40:15] you got to have this boyfriend or
[1:40:16] girlfriend you got to have this
[1:40:17] popularity
[1:40:19] all these different things the world is
[1:40:20] trying to tell you you get christ
[1:40:23] the only thing that matters i don't it
[1:40:26] doesn't matter
[1:40:27] it doesn't matter if you're the poorest
[1:40:29] most uneducated person on the planet
[1:40:31] doesn't i don't care if you don't have
[1:40:32] any degrees
[1:40:34] don't go to college whatever that stuff
[1:40:36] you know that's not that it's bad
[1:40:38] but if you're put to a choice you choose
[1:40:40] jesus christ
[1:40:43] because they may have been ignorant and
[1:40:44] unlearned but one thing they took note
[1:40:46] of is they had been with jesus
[1:40:49] this that science is the god
[1:40:52] that they try to exalt now and they
[1:40:54] can't even agree on that
[1:40:58] and they contradict themselves every day
[1:41:00] 20 years ago eggs were going to kill you
[1:41:03] now if you don't eat eggs you're going
[1:41:04] to die
[1:41:07] they can't decide why because it's
[1:41:09] shifting sands
[1:41:11] but we're on the solid rock but so i
[1:41:14] just
[1:41:14] i just i don't know i just had this
[1:41:16] burden for the young people
[1:41:18] because i remember even when i was
[1:41:20] younger you know i'm 36 now so i've been
[1:41:23] out of school as long as i was in school
[1:41:25] 18 years past 18.
[1:41:27] you know and i think wow i'm getting old
[1:41:29] you know it just time flies
[1:41:31] it really does it goes by really quick
[1:41:33] life is about a vapor
[1:41:35] but i can't even imagine the pressures
[1:41:38] right now
[1:41:39] internet was just coming into existence
[1:41:42] like in the full
[1:41:43] fledge i i was still doing dial up when
[1:41:45] i was just coming out of high school
[1:41:47] you know and there were a lot of
[1:41:49] struggles then
[1:41:51] i can't imagine when the devils put
[1:41:53] everything in their fingertips with
[1:41:54] these phones
[1:41:57] tell you we better pray long and hard
[1:41:59] that's the only thing
[1:42:00] you parents pray a hedge of protection
[1:42:03] about your children
[1:42:05] it's only the grace of god in this age
[1:42:09] amen amen
[1:42:12] how many are just going to be content
[1:42:14] with the things that you have
[1:42:16] how many how many are contented with
[1:42:18] what god's made you and what he's
[1:42:20] brought you to
[1:42:21] amen let's not be satisfied just staying
[1:42:24] in one spot
[1:42:25] but like paul i didn't even get to the
[1:42:27] scripture but paul said he said now that
[1:42:28] job attained he said but i
[1:42:30] press it's not it's not that i will
[1:42:32] press or i have
[1:42:33] press it's a present tense pressing
[1:42:37] i press continually towards the mark of
[1:42:41] the high calling in christ jesus
[1:42:43] that's where we're at right now we're at
[1:42:45] the pressing
[1:42:46] just keep pressing my only thing is just
[1:42:50] don't be discouraged
[1:42:52] don't be satisfied with
[1:42:55] anything else other than the fullness of
[1:42:58] this word in your life
[1:42:59] why because he's promised it for you
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:03] that's the promise for this age that
[1:43:05] he's given to us
[1:43:06] is is to see a bride in his very image
[1:43:10] i gotta read that i gotta find this
[1:43:12] quote i meant to read this forgive me if
[1:43:13] i have you stand just for a second but i
[1:43:15] believe we'll be okay
[1:43:19] let me see if i can find this real quick
[1:43:20] by the grace of god
[1:43:26] i'll just read this last i had a bit of
[1:43:28] it here but i'm just going to read this
[1:43:30] last little thing
[1:43:32] it's from the statue of a perfect man he
[1:43:34] says
[1:43:35] he says you get it these people who died
[1:43:38] in here are depending and waiting on
[1:43:40] us so this church has got to come to
[1:43:43] perfection
[1:43:44] in order to bring the resurrection and
[1:43:47] their under
[1:43:48] souls into the altar waiting for this
[1:43:50] church to come to its perfection
[1:43:53] but when christ does come and this
[1:43:55] church you see
[1:43:56] is coming smaller in the minority it's a
[1:43:59] whole lot sharper than that
[1:44:00] i want you to think about that he said
[1:44:01] it's coming smaller than the minority
[1:44:03] then he says it's actually a whole lot
[1:44:04] sharper than that
[1:44:06] but just so i write that cross there see
[1:44:09] it's come up to a needlepoint
[1:44:12] until the church of the minority has got
[1:44:14] to get into a place
[1:44:16] until it's the same kind of ministry
[1:44:19] that this left
[1:44:21] because when this headstone comes back
[1:44:23] he said it's got a pocket like here
[1:44:25] where it's going to set right in there
[1:44:28] on a regular pyramid
[1:44:29] it isn't a cap that just sits across the
[1:44:32] top it's a little flange
[1:44:34] and it's got to set on there because it
[1:44:35] sheds the water and when it comes
[1:44:37] this church has got to be honed all
[1:44:40] these rest the stones in the pyramid are
[1:44:42] laying so perfect
[1:44:43] to you can't run a razor blade between
[1:44:44] them weighing tons laying in there
[1:44:46] how they got them up they don't know but
[1:44:48] they were built
[1:44:50] now i want you to just listen to this
[1:44:51] this last little bit
[1:44:53] and up here when the pyramid cap does
[1:44:55] come the pyramid itself
[1:44:57] the body of christ will have to be honed
[1:45:00] not only just some creed or doctrine or
[1:45:02] something we've come through
[1:45:04] i want you to listen it'll have to be so
[1:45:07] perfectly like christ
[1:45:09] to when he comes he and that ministry
[1:45:12] what's ministry the ministry of the
[1:45:14] bride he
[1:45:16] and that ministry will fit right smack
[1:45:19] together he said it'll have to be
[1:45:22] so perfectly like christ so that
[1:45:25] ministry
[1:45:26] will be just like his then we'll come
[1:45:30] the rapture
[1:45:31] the going home that's what we're looking
[1:45:33] for that seed is already there
[1:45:35] it's already there for you lord help us
[1:45:38] to grow
[1:45:39] as our brother really preached this
[1:45:41] morning lord
[1:45:42] lord the seed you put in me has to
[1:45:44] manifest you
[1:45:46] lord just let me feed it more lord let
[1:45:49] me fertilize it with more word
[1:45:52] lord let me fertilize it with more
[1:45:53] prayer oh lord let me water it with
[1:45:56] tears
[1:45:59] we ought to be we ought to be a prayer
[1:46:01] prayer is where we need to be brothers
[1:46:02] and sisters
[1:46:04] prayers read your bible every day and
[1:46:06] pray
[1:46:08] so simple but pray without ceasing
[1:46:12] we ought to just that's where we get
[1:46:13] into the spirit that's where we cast
[1:46:15] aside everything get in the closet and
[1:46:16] pray
[1:46:18] when you go to work pray when you're in
[1:46:20] your car
[1:46:21] pray oh my i'd say read your bible in
[1:46:24] your car but we don't want to do that
[1:46:28] but pray without ceasing why that's the
[1:46:30] communion
[1:46:32] that's where we come into the presence
[1:46:34] of god that's what
[1:46:35] i believe that's what we're lacking
[1:46:38] that's where we're lacking
[1:46:39] we're we're trying to get ourselves
[1:46:41] contented with all these worldly things
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] we're we're putting so much to outfit
[1:46:47] thought and this will be my last thing i
[1:46:49] promise
[1:46:50] i know i said that a lot and i can't say
[1:46:53] we only have one service because this is
[1:46:54] the second service so forgive me
[1:46:57] but i often thought about i said lord
[1:46:58] and this is just my own thing and i'm
[1:47:00] and i'm far from fulfilling my own
[1:47:02] desire in this but i often thought i
[1:47:04] said lord
[1:47:05] if i could tithe of my money the things
[1:47:08] that you give me lord how much more
[1:47:09] should i tithe of my time
[1:47:12] and how how much do we give the lord of
[1:47:14] our time truly
[1:47:16] where it's just him
[1:47:19] just him and you in the secret place
[1:47:23] in the inner chamber in in the holiest
[1:47:24] the holies in the in the prayer closet
[1:47:28] by yourself you face to face with the
[1:47:30] shekinah
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:32] oh i'm not talking about just feeling
[1:47:34] anything you won't always feel something
[1:47:35] but i'm talking about
[1:47:37] taking the time in this age time is the
[1:47:40] commodity
[1:47:41] because man that devil's got us running
[1:47:43] around doing every little thing
[1:47:45] we got so many business things to do so
[1:47:47] many
[1:47:48] things i think about just even trying to
[1:47:50] clean my house up or
[1:47:51] do a little project here and there it
[1:47:53] feels like it takes forever when it
[1:47:54] should be more simple
[1:47:56] but that's the the evil of this date
[1:47:57] with the time and what is it doing
[1:47:59] the devil's trying to steal it away give
[1:48:02] it unto the lord and watch him multiply
[1:48:05] it for good
[1:48:06] i believe wasn't it i think it was it
[1:48:08] was one of the the ones from back then
[1:48:10] in the reformation
[1:48:12] might have been john wesley or martin
[1:48:13] luther talked about how
[1:48:15] he realized that the more he needed to
[1:48:17] do
[1:48:18] the more things he had on his plate i'm
[1:48:20] just paraphrasing the more he had to
[1:48:22] pray
[1:48:24] because if he would pray when he went to
[1:48:26] do the things he had need of
[1:48:28] the lord would give him the result he
[1:48:30] needed instead of having to beat his
[1:48:32] head against the wall
[1:48:33] trying to do something and oftentimes
[1:48:36] isn't that what we do we try to we're
[1:48:37] just oh we got to do it we got to do it
[1:48:39] we got to do it we just
[1:48:40] maybe we should just settle down let off
[1:48:42] the pressure
[1:48:43] go pray say lord maybe i gotta take care
[1:48:47] of this thing but lord
[1:48:48] i'm gonna put you first i'm gonna i'm
[1:48:51] gonna i'm gonna make sure the things
[1:48:52] that are done are the things that matter
[1:48:56] my my relationship with the lord jesus
[1:49:00] amen that's where we ought to be that's
[1:49:02] part of it i know it is
[1:49:03] because i know that's where the devil
[1:49:05] that's one of the places the devil
[1:49:06] fights me and i know he fights all of us
[1:49:09] amen let's just bow our heads heavenly
[1:49:12] father
[1:49:17] lord you're so merciful to us oh god
[1:49:21] your mercies are renewed every morning
[1:49:23] lord
[1:49:26] lord you came down in this age with the
[1:49:28] capstone crying grace grace
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:31] lord and we have need of that grace lord
[1:49:34] we need that double portion of grace
[1:49:35] that you've given lord you you even
[1:49:37] called your bride misgrace
[1:49:40] lord we want to just give all of
[1:49:44] ourselves to you lord
[1:49:45] lord we don't want to hold anything back
[1:49:47] we don't want to be satisfied with any
[1:49:49] worldly thing lord
[1:49:51] lord let us what you've made us let us
[1:49:53] be content with
[1:49:54] where you've placed us lord let us be
[1:49:57] content with the worldly things
[1:49:59] you know food and clothing and and
[1:50:01] transportation the things that you've
[1:50:03] given us lord
[1:50:04] but lord let us seek after the things
[1:50:06] that matter
[1:50:07] lord let us put you in the rightful
[1:50:10] place oh god it's number one in our
[1:50:11] lives
[1:50:13] lord before we would go out to do
[1:50:15] anything let's go before the throne lord
[1:50:18] to seek after your face every single day
[1:50:20] oh god
[1:50:22] lord let us give more of ourselves o
[1:50:24] lord jesus
[1:50:25] lord take away every selfish desire that
[1:50:27] i have in my life
[1:50:29] everything that i have that i do just to
[1:50:32] to please my own flesh or i feel like
[1:50:34] doing it lord but
[1:50:36] lord may we look to you before we would
[1:50:38] do anything oh god
[1:50:40] lord how your prophet would even tell us
[1:50:42] that the bride she would have thus saith
[1:50:44] the lord if she would stand still
[1:50:47] lord it looks so contrary to the age
[1:50:50] that we live in that tells us we've
[1:50:51] always got to be going we've got to be
[1:50:52] running and we've got to be moving
[1:50:54] we've got to be going here and there and
[1:50:56] every which way but lord so many times
[1:50:58] you've just called us to be still
[1:51:00] and know that you are god lord to be
[1:51:03] still in the quiet place of your
[1:51:05] presence o lord
[1:51:06] where we can hear from you lord we could
[1:51:09] receive instruction lord
[1:51:11] where we could receive your your desire
[1:51:13] for our lives
[1:51:15] and see what you would have for us oh
[1:51:16] god lord we've seen the message
[1:51:20] lord in the words that have been spoken
[1:51:22] in the words revealed in this age what
[1:51:24] you've called us to be
[1:51:25] an overcoming bride filled with power
[1:51:30] filled with overcoming power life of
[1:51:32] your life oh god expressing you as you
[1:51:34] were on this earth lord even as we just
[1:51:36] read
[1:51:37] that capstone coming down having a
[1:51:39] ministry lord that would just match up
[1:51:41] perfectly with you lord
[1:51:42] lord that's what we we can't be
[1:51:44] satisfied until we see it
[1:51:47] lord just like abraham we're looking for
[1:51:49] a city whose builder and maker is god
[1:51:52] lord we want to see it manifested lord
[1:51:55] forgive us of our shortcomings lord
[1:51:56] jesus
[1:51:57] lord let us not put any evil things
[1:51:59] before our eyes lord
[1:52:00] let us not have any wickedness come off
[1:52:02] of our lips oh god lord let us speak
[1:52:04] positive all the time lord rejoicing and
[1:52:07] thinking upon the good things of the
[1:52:08] word o lord
[1:52:10] lord the world may call us fanatics lord
[1:52:13] oh god i often think about the phrase
[1:52:15] we've heard of
[1:52:16] people talking about being so heavenly
[1:52:19] minded they're no earthly good but lord
[1:52:21] how could it be any earthly good except
[1:52:23] we be heavenly minded lord
[1:52:26] lord let us be heavenly minded caught up
[1:52:29] into your spirit oh god every day
[1:52:32] lord just filled over and over again
[1:52:34] with your spirit in us lord living and
[1:52:36] seeing your word and acting the things
[1:52:39] that we ought to lord not just
[1:52:41] not just satisfied with just a
[1:52:43] revelation lord but
[1:52:44] desiring that manifestation in this hour
[1:52:47] lord we're seeing it coming to pass
[1:52:49] we know it's happening even now lord
[1:52:51] we're not as those that are only looking
[1:52:53] to what you're going to do we see it
[1:52:55] manifesting even now even
[1:52:56] talking with the brother in the back
[1:52:58] before the service how lord the rapture
[1:53:00] is even happening now
[1:53:02] we know it's coming to pass but oh lord
[1:53:04] we also see a greater awakening for your
[1:53:06] people

[1:53:09] lord
[1:53:11] lord that's what we want we want more of
[1:53:13] you lord
[1:53:15] lord may you grant it to us oh god get
[1:53:17] us out of the way lord to manifest you
[1:53:20] lord the way you would have us lord put
[1:53:22] us in our rightful place lord jesus

[1:53:25] people grow out and just be abundantly
[1:53:28] fruitful o lord
[1:53:29] let us feed it with the word fertilize
[1:53:32] it with prayer oh god water it with
[1:53:34] tears lord
[1:53:35] give us that desire to be in the prayer

[2:10:00] appreciate that brother randy
[2:10:02] as i as he i as he preached that i
[2:10:05] thought of
[2:10:05] i thought of it you ever go to like ikea
[2:10:08] or something if you find the dresser you
[2:10:10] want
[2:10:10] or you find the right bed you want and
[2:10:13] you you select
[2:10:14] it you make the selection and you're
[2:10:15] content with what you chose
[2:10:17] but when you get home you're not
[2:10:19] satisfied yeah
[2:10:22] you got all the contents you need
[2:10:25] you got everything you need and it's not
[2:10:28] until you get it inside
[2:10:30] and you get it into the room you want
[2:10:32] you start unboxing it and you start
[2:10:33] putting it together
[2:10:34] and it starts to come into that image
[2:10:36] that was on the box
[2:10:38] and i thank god he gave us an image in
[2:10:40] this day we
[2:10:42] we've seen a first fruit come to
[2:10:43] maturity with the power of the spoken
[2:10:45] word and
[2:10:46] we've seen the first church with the
[2:10:47] power and the manifestation
[2:10:49] that's the picture on the box and
[2:10:51] sometimes like our brother was saying
[2:10:52] well
[2:10:53] you put something together and you
[2:10:54] realize you got to pull it out and
[2:10:55] reweld it again because you it wasn't
[2:10:57] quite right
[2:10:58] but you know we're coming into that
[2:10:59] image praise god
[2:11:01] amen as they just play something softly
[2:11:03] we'll say a a prayer of dismissal
[2:11:05] amen heavenly father how we just rejoice
[2:11:09] in the word that we've
[2:11:10] heard lord content but not satisfied
[2:11:13] lord
[2:11:14] oh god maybe just in using our simple
[2:11:16] vocabulary of being content lord what
[2:11:19] you've done for us lord
[2:11:20] oh we're so thankful for it lord we're
[2:11:22] so thankful where you've brought us
[2:11:24] to we're so thankful for our families
[2:11:26] our church our loved ones our brothers
[2:11:28] our sisters lord
[2:11:29] and maybe uh uh there might be one among
[2:11:32] us who feels that they don't
[2:11:33] maybe have much family and they don't
[2:11:35] feel like they have many things but all
[2:11:37] they have you lord they have everything
[2:11:39] and we're content with your word or
[2:11:41] we're content with the call upon our
[2:11:43] lives or
[2:11:44] we're content with the message we're
[2:11:45] content with the gospel but oh there's
[2:11:47] something
[2:11:48] inside of us lord that's crying out for
[2:11:51] the manifestation
[2:11:52] of the sons and daughters of god lord we
[2:11:54] want to come into that image that
[2:11:56] stature of a perfect man we want to be

[2:12:01] to see the realities moving and working
[2:12:03] in our lives lord jesus
[2:12:05] we want to have control and dominion
[2:12:07] over this earth lord because that's what
[2:12:08] you've created us for
[2:12:10] may we just die out to all of our own
[2:12:12] thinking all of our own ideas lord jesus
[2:12:15] that we would see this word come into
[2:12:17] full power and maturity lord
[2:12:19] where we could speak the word and see it
[2:12:21] come into action
[2:12:22] we know the squeeze is coming down we we
[2:12:24] see the cup of the iniquity is full all
[2:12:27] around us horse we know
