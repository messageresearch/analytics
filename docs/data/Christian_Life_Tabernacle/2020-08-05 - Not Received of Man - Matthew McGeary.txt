Description:
Not Received of Man
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Service: August 5,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

to say lord i'm expecting the supernatural well forgive me if we're being so busy today lord but i've made it to the house of god and here i am more i'm laying myself at your feet i'm believing that you're going to pass by my way lord i have needs speak to my heart lord father will be careful to give you all the praise and all the honor and glory that's due to your lord we just surrender ourselves to you myself and the people lord that you would come that you would just take this vessel lord and you take the ears of the hearer lord and you'd break the bread of life as only you can we ask all these things in the most precious name the name that's above all names the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord my it's just good to be in his presence amen we'll be reading out of uh mark 11. i think i saw lily back there well she's just visiting but it's good to have you with us amen mark 11 24. just be reading a few scriptures here maybe we'll back up a few maybe we'll just back up to verse 22 and jesus answered and saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whatsoever shall say who shall ever say say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them let's just read john 15 7. maybe we'll just read verse 6 as well if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and has withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you may we just ask a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated we also just want to read out of galatians chapter 1. be reading verse 11. but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jewish religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals and my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood amen i just want to pull from this scripture read it might be an odd text but just something the lord placed on my heart not received of man i just want to speak to you a little bit about that because here pulling from that verse 12 it says for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ so this gospel that paul is preaching he's he's writing to the galatians there and he's telling him look this this message that i've i've received you know i didn't i didn't receive a message and then run up to jerusalem and and have a little conference with the the disciples that had went before me i didn't run back to my my pastor or or my old church and tell them uh uh look what happened to me on the road to damascus but but paul starts to testify look uh you know i i was zealous for for the traditions of my fathers and and i was going about my own way i had received the traditions of my father but but on my road i was going about to do these things i was even going to persecute the church and i'd i had letters to bind them and put them in the prison but oh something happened to me along the way i was going on and all of a sudden a bright light a pillar of fire struck me down on the road to damascus and oh i wondered what it what it was and he and something spoke to me and said uh paul it's hard to kick against the pricks and and i said lord who art thou he said i am jesus who now and oh i think of paul when he's given this testimony to king of grip he says i wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision and as he testifies of the message of what he had received from god even king of grip says oh paul thou almost myself persuades me to be a christian why there was such a conviction paul had received something from god he didn't have to confer with man he said i didn't i didn't i didn't go confer with flesh and blood but he had received something from god he didn't receive something from man and that's just something we want to speak on our hearts tonight to you about receiving something from god what you have received if you've received it of man it can be taken away from you but when you receive a revelation from god nothing can take that away just think of paul running there just on that religion and that education and i wonder if some of us maybe fit that mold maybe we're kind of running on intellect and we're kind of running on education kind of running by things that we've heard and and the way we can kind of add it all up but here paul said i didn't get it from seminary i i didn't read the bible and call up a brother and then go over there and then have have him give me his revelation now i'm not taking away the importance of iron sharpening iron and it's good to fellowship amongst the brothers and it's it's good to listen to the word it's it's good to come to church and hear the preachers preach but there has to come a time where the word is revealed to you personally and when that happens i don't care if the very men that introduced you to the message fall away you won't fall away with them but so many times men get caught up with a man's uh a personality they get caught up with a man's charisma and this man came with great ability to explain the message and oh you go down the line and maybe they've been going to church with them for several years but all of a sudden some type of seed of discrepancy pops up and he starts to weave the message this way and that way and all of a sudden you find the people just following right after them when the prophet taught look if your pastor leaves the message leave your pastor and i know our pastor would stand to say that the first time first thing we've heard him say many times oh if he ever left this mess you stay with the message but the problem is if you don't have a revelation how can you stay with something that hasn't been revealed to you so when the man the man behind the pulpit starts deviating or some person comes over to to the house and tries to start giving you their little doctrine and their little way of seeing things all of a sudden you start gravitating over to why because it's been explained to you in such an intellectual way but i believe there's a place that the believer can come to just like paul that can say look what i've received i haven't received it of man where a brother could come and try to talk you off the word of god and say look brother i'm sorry to disagree with you but i'm standing upon the solid rock of revelation i know this is the truth oh we get we get too much of the time start to lean on what we've perceived in our minds i imagine if we were to pass out a message exam tonight oh my maybe we all could pass it we've all been raised a lot of us have been raised right in the church we've all been around it might we can just answer answer all the questions just right but let's talk about a life let's talk about the power let's talk about the example that was set before us let's talk about living it i think about moses you know he he had heard the message he had heard there was a deliverer he heard he was a proper child he was believing these things were true but moses had received it intellectually and so what happened when moses went to execute the message intellectually he got intellectual results but there had to come a time because moses was predestinated for the job where moses met god on the backside of the desert then he had a conference with god then he had a revelation you know he didn't he didn't come down he didn't come back down to pharaoh and say well you know pharaoh just to let you know i'm very aware of all your army and and i've studied it really well and i've developed counter-attacks because you know i was i've studied all this and you know all those little tactics that y'all use out there in warfare i actually designed most of those so i came up with an alternate plan to it didn't come to him intellectually he didn't come with some man's program but he came back with a message he came back with thus saith the lord he came to pharaoh with the message that thus saith the lord let my people go and we have received a message of thus saith the lord we've received a word from god and we should be able to stand just like moses stood there with a message if you've had a conference with god if you know where you're standing the prophet of god says and no man has a right to claim to be a christian no woman no child no preacher especially until he himself has come upon the sacred sands where he's met god all the theologians in the world all the infidels in the world can't explain that away from him he was there it happened it happened to him he knows where he stands if man didn't if if man didn't give it man can't take it away but if man gave it a rob you of it they'll be able to come in and try to try to talk you out of it or talk you this way or that way amen look at that though we start talking about your joy and your peace and your salvation this message who gave that to you who gave that to you god gave that to you so when satan tries to come in and starts to war against you and tries to start take away the promises of god no sir you don't have to back down you say devil it's my it's my joy it's my peace it's my family it's my message i have thus saith the lord oh sure we know he's an accuser of the brethren we know he's always trying to point to your faults and try to point to your failures but oh my one moment in his presence you look at moses oh my he seems so defeated he seems so far away from the call of god there 40 years there in egypt now 40 years on the back side of the desert be like moses you missed it you totally missed the will of god for your life you're 80 years old you're washed up you've been in this man you're telling me you've been in the message for 15 20 years and this is only so how far you've gotten you're telling me that you're the bride of christ and you're still struggling with all these things all you have to tell that devil devil whatever you're trying to say look i just know one moment in the presence of god will change everything and i've come to the house of god tonight and i believe where two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst and i tell you whatever you have need of tonight just one moment in his presence everything can change i don't care how far sin has dragged you out there in the world i don't care how bad your family situation looks i don't care how discouraged you feel right now one moment in his presence it changed everything for moses moses looked defeated he looked like he didn't have a chance he looked like he was weak he looked like he was incapable how could an old man with a stick ever march down to egypt and and perform a deliverance to the people of god but what happened he was one time in the presence of the pillar of fire and everything changed i believe the same thing is available tonight for the people of god his presence is here he'll give you a revelation where you're no longer standing upon man's ideas or man's creeds but you're standing upon the solid revelation of jesus christ oh that's what we have brothers and sisters we have a message from god then moses he was no longer operating by the ways of the flesh he was operating by thus saith the lord we have thus saith the lord look you're going to fulfill every promise that's been spoken of you you're the predestinated you're the cult you're placed here to do it matter of fact i believe i believe god come i believe god came himself and he spoke a bride into existence i believe god himself according to a divine promise has come in the end time and he him own self has spoke a word concerning a people and there was a predestinated people to receive that word and here they are oh the bride of jesus christ ones that believe every single word that are believing they're going in a rapture believing they're going in a body change not because something they can do in themselves but because he said so i'm not standing upon my ability to perform it i'm not standing upon some way that i can figure it out in my mind i'm standing upon the fact that he said it and i believe it so i want to tell you stay with it stay with him keep believing if he said it you believe it what did jesus tell the disciples he said but go terry terry in the city of jerusalem and until you be endued with power from on high so what did they do they believed they went and tarried there but i'm sure you could imagine in their minds could you imagine i wouldn't doubt they sang songs and they told stories and i i i bet they got emotional i bet they got excited i bet they were feeling some stimulation maybe i'll but they're like oh yeah you remember that time we went down there he braided the whip he started beating everybody out of the temple oh my and then and then we we remember remember how when we saw that all of a sudden with the words of the prophet came upon us is like oh the zeal of thy house has eaten them up that's it we're watching the fulfillment we're watching the very manifestation of what the prophets have spoken oh and there they go they could just start telling testimony a testimony you remember that one time uh the woman there that touched touch the hymn of his garments and we told him the master what do you mean who touches you hundreds of people are touching you and there all of a sudden out of the whole bunch he picked out one of them that had touched his garment because virtue went from him oh i imagine maybe they they started getting getting worked up and getting enthusiastic and maybe they started feeling like hey maybe we can go maybe we can go tell somebody about this i think you think we got it i don't know man i think those roman soldiers are out there yeah yeah well you know they did they did crucify him yeah maybe i don't know i don't know about testifying just yet you know maybe we ought to stay here a little longer you know he didn't say terry until all of a sudden there they were sitting around there according to a divine promise and also all of a sudden a pillar of fire dropped in there little licks of fire started coming upon the believers and all of a sudden they started to get endued with power on high oh and when that happened nothing could hold them nothing could contain them all of a sudden they started coming out the windows they kicked out the door oh and they come out in the streets they were testifying and what did they start saying oh who are these guys these are drunk guys what are they doing to peter stood they say men and brethren oh this is no we are not drunk as you suppose but this is what the prophet joel has prophesied oh we shall i'll see visions and dream dreams and talk in tongues this is the manifestation this is the fulfillment of it why because they stayed there and they carried believing in the promised word they had received something that didn't come from man it came from god that's what malachi 4 has been promised to do is to restore us back to that same faith malachi 4 has promised to restore us back to that same faith and power that was delivered at pentecost the prophet of god says in christ the mystery of god revealed he says then when we are born of him we are filled with him see your life his life is in you then all our actions should declare him it's like taking life out of it out of one tree and putting it into another taking life out of a pear tree and put it in an apple tree it'll bear pears it got to because the sap the life in it the germ is pear tree all right then all of our actions should declare him we have his name is that right we should bear his name and remember we are now as his bride pregnated with his spirit oh my the church bearing children pregnanted by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminences evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and vindicates to the world that we are alive in him how do you know because you're a church member because christ is living through you so pregnanted with his spirit that you're a prisoner to anything you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you bring forth is that because you're a prisoner you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated glory he can't take a hold the womb of life is closed to anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no the world can't get in oh how we'd like to stay on that for about an hour i'm sure you understand christ and his alone already finished the seed was there when was it put there before the foundation of the world he has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as the life-giving flow that seed lay in there other seeds just couldn't come in it wouldn't take hold oh my friends do you realize what he's saying if it wasn't for that predestinated seed oh i'd probably be dead i'd probably be locked up i'd probably be in some institution or maybe i'd i'd have gravitated to some uh when i started wanting to look for god maybe i'd have latched on to the pentecostal religion maybe i latched on to some charismatic movement oh but there was something else there that would only be satisfied hallelujah by one thing and that was him that was his word it was his life and it was predestinated there laying there waiting until that word come and sought me out came and sought you out come and spoke to your heart you wonder why you weren't happy anywhere else you wonder why you weren't happy there in the world why because there was a deep calling to a deep and there was a deep to respond and that was the message of the hour it was christ coming and revealing himself to you other seeds that just would come couldn't take hold just couldn't do it but when that seed come in quickly it stopped up the womb all the rest of the seeds was drove out and you become a prisoner surrounded in christ christ in you his life bringing forth his evidences his signs oh my my my look bringing his signs of life as evidence of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that we're alive in him well that's a packed quote but we're talking about what this message is producing in you talking about receiving something from him and think of it alive with god our redeemer who created us for the very same purpose the church and his creative life is in us oh my brother matthew that sounds really good you sure picked a good quote there you know it sounds really good but i really don't see all these evidences and i don't see all these preeminences and i don't see all these signs and wonders in my life oh my it's quiet oh my if we do we we get out who's keeping score who's who's tracking their works i'm glad there's not a tally book the question is is do you believe it do you believe what he said i believe these signs shall follow them that belief i believe i believe i shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i believe i believe i have the ability through the shed blood of jesus christ and by the power of the holy ghost to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover to cast out demons why because his word said so oh the devil will get you in a corner and he'll start to corner you out and try to try to beat you down but i just want to reassure you brothers and sisters if you got that faith there on the inside you keep holding to that word you keep believing that word don't make excuses don't start to chalk it up well maybe he meant something else we've seen a sheath wave we've seen one come and manifest this word with power and demonstration with the spoken word with the third pull on display with that token life showed us how to live it proved it god proving his word such a transparent life all the way down to where if he would have told his wife oh just tell him just just tell him i'm not here and it would go out god captured that for us for a purpose to show us what kind of life it takes to show us what kind of life it produces you can't get by with little white lies i was telling the brother something happened to me the other day i called a customer and and i called him i didn't i can't remember their names i'll just see bob and sharon and the phone answered and and bob answers phone hello i'm like hey bob it's like oh oh no this is sherry oh sorry i can't hear you uh hello hello oh sherry well i got done with the call and something come on my heart and was like that wasn't right well it wasn't right i you told her you could you couldn't hear you could hear her just fine you mean i got to make that right yeah that wasn't right so i had to make it right so i looked for the opportunity and god gave me the opportunity and and i told her i said sherry i just i just wanted to let you know that uh i wanted to make it right the other day when i told you i i'm mistaking you for for bob i i said i couldn't hear you uh because i was embarrassed that i thought i thought you were bob and she was like oh it happens to me all the time you don't worry about it i tell you what god bless you it's good to have christians that care or something like that and all of a sudden it turned into a little exchange where she was appreciative that there was people with character and i thought praise god that i didn't shriek from my responsibility but look god's interested in everything we do and say we must be portraying the very life and the very essence of jesus christ that's what the preeminence is that's what the message is producing is where the very zoe life of god has come into your tabernacle and he is taking complete control of your thoughts of your actions of your hands of your feet of your mouth of your eyes to where you can speak the word and we saw a sheaf wave among us that was so surrendered out to god that when god would speak to him he would walk straight in the face of death knowing it would cause him his life but oh he had been molded he had been shaped he had suffered i don't know why this saying comes to my mind now it's maybe not a good one but they say a smart man learns from his mistakes but a wise man learns from others mistakes i pray oh god thank you for for the prophet's life thank you for your life that you lived out in the prophet's life so i could see an example so i can see what your word is asking of me and not in myself that i have to produce it but it's showing me what this word can produce therefore as a believer look we don't shrink from that it's something to look forward to i think that's the problem many of us are shying away from the challenge oh you mean that's what the word requires you and i go i got you know i got to lay hands on the sick and they recover and you mean i i i got to be perfect well you know i kind of comfortable over here in my little zone you know i got my good job i'm in ladies everything's just right i got i got the message everything i got church three times a week everything everything's good even kovit didn't get me i got my mask and i'm working from home and i think i'm making it i'm doing pretty good i'm in my comfort zone we should be embracing the challenge they should be testifying you might as well turn some people's head sideways here and there because it's going to happen but hey did you know i'm going to go in a rapture did you know this body's going to be changed you might just find out somebody's hungry for what you got i i you look brother branham had countless converts just out in his normal daily life countless converts i who knows who knows and i think we should have that same heart today i was just in in my office studying i looked out and this this guy was walking down the street and you know if he showed up and you're in the back praise god but he he looked rugged i mean he done a lot of time and he had a lot of ink on him and he passed this guy running and and i presume that the guy that passed him wasn't trying to be rude he just probably is trying to analyze what he just saw and kept looking back like did i really just see that well the other guy was looking back at him too and also when he turns around he's back peddling and i've seen this before right so i'm like oh man all right so so i walk out i walk out the house i'm like what's going on man you about to throw hands or something and he's like oh this guy was looking at me man he was looking at me crazy and i was almost like well yeah but we we just got we just got to talking and uh rugged but i just told him he needed god and goes you know what i believe that's the truth i should be dead you never know look we can't count anybody out but we could we can do our best to just be a light in everything if even if look i tell you what you know who you got to be a witness the most to is yourself you you need to be a witness to yours young people you need to grab this little flesh bag of bones here and tell this little flesh bag of bones here hey we're going to serve god i know you want to do all these other things i know you got these big ideas and i know you got all these games and i know you've got all these programs and i know you've got all these careers i'm speaking to everybody now i know you got all your happy places and all these things you do to burn time i know you ought to just say you know what self come here we're serving god it's time to go to church it's time to pray it's time to go on the rapture it's time to go in the body church i'm sick and tired of you flesh man keeping me from the promises of god where's the greatest battle ever fought who's your greatest enemy ought yourself the devil's already defeated he's just playing and catering to your mind to try to make you think things are real that aren't even real there's only one thing that's real and that's what he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and when you've received that word on the inside of your soul and you've got that revelation not something from man but something from god oh now you got something that has power now you got something that's real now you got something to witness about now you got something to testify now you can go down to egypt like moses did now you can stand there in the face of all the sadducees and pharisees and all them leaders of the day like paul and why because it's not paul's life it's not moses life it's the very life of god and it's the very life of god that's living on the inside of the bride of jesus christ oh hallelujah the same life that was in our prophet will produce the same works the same signs the same wonders the same humility the same sincerity in you do you believe it you cannot see the kingdom of god unless you've been born again we always want to invite you be born again things ain't adding up maybe that's where you need to start you have nothing to lose and everything to gain i can promise you that first corinthians 2 9. but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but just keep reading but god hath revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god so what a person perceives what he knows and what he's understanding is by the spirit that's within him look you filter everything through your life experiences you filter what you're what you go through and and you know i mean there's people that are afraid of dogs why are they afraid of dogs well they probably had a bad experience with a dog before you find out the reason why people are like certain things and dislike certain things you know or maybe certain cultures wide because it's something that's been taught to them or it's been something that they've learned it's something they've grown up with life experiences and and you can only me what the things you're dealing with and the things that you're experiencing you can only identify with that by the spirit that's within you you can only interact and react with it by that spirit that's within you and that's the very thing where where the devil tries to take all these uh things of your past or things of your uh your your childhood or things that you've grown up with and that's what the devil tries to use against you he tries to tap into those those memories he tries to tap into that past he tries to tap into that life of sin he tries to draw back into your memory back into your mind oh i say pray pray god give me a mind like your mind lord let me start forgetting those things lord may you just wash my mind and purify my mind oh because you'll be going along and all of a sudden uh something will remind you and also you'll be back in that spot you'll be back in that place and satan will pull something back up in your mind and we got to be careful we got to be guarded we got to realize we don't want to identify with those things we don't want to resurrect that dead man this might be an odd way of saying this but when a man receives something then it's man doing something when a man receives something then it's man doing something and maybe for a poor example you know if you if you hire if you hire a carpenter or you hire a plumber to do your tree work you've hired a plumber to do tree work you're probably not going to get the right results right so when man when you when man by the spirit of man and by the intellect of man takes the word of god and tries to manifest it you're going to get the wrong picture so when man receives something then it's man doing something that's exactly what moses did moses had received what he had heard he knew where he had come from he knew that his people were in bondage and moses knew that they would be delivered so what did moses do moses thought all right let me try to let me try to jump in here and see if i can help but it was man trying to fulfill the word of god so when the word of god comes if the word of god comes when if it's just man receiving it and then man trying to do it it's man doing it but we want to move past we want to move past the spirit of man we want to move past the intellectual thought we want to move to where that word that you received oh that's fine if you know the the mind is the womb to the spirit we have to allow the word of god to come into these gates oh but we don't want it to stop there we we want to listen to the word and i think so many times where we might get ourselves in trouble and i've had to to to learn and to wait on the lord well i'll read something and i'll get all of excited and i want to share it share it with a brother why don't you share with your lord jesus christ a little while why don't you wait on the lord and see what he's trying to show you and what he's trying to reveal but oh we get so excited and also we want to run this way just want to just wait upon the lord a little while and i found out sometimes while i waited upon the lord that it was just my mind getting all excited i started to run it out a little bit and wait on the lord and realize oh okay lord i see now i that was my intellect trying to plug things two things together that didn't come together oh i i've been inspired i'm like oh man this is great let's see what the prophet said about it like where did i get that inspiration oh we need to pray church we need to listen with sincerity with earnestness and pray and say god reveal yourself to me because that's what we want we want that word now to drop down into the soul oh when it drops down there brother then it's no longer man receiving something it's the god inside of you receiving his own word oh hallelujah that that's that's when phase final resting place is in the word of god now something's quickened now something comes to life we just need to surrender and be humble be sincere look god will bring his word to pass those that wait upon the lord they shall mount up with wings like an eagle they shall run they shall not faint look god has given the promise we believe it keep believing it keep staying with it keep waiting upon the lord oh like eagles you're going to mount up brother branham tells a story about one time he was out hunting on the mountainside and i believe a little little rain came by and he kind of tried to find a little cover as for some trees and it it had gone on by and i believe the sun was starting to come back out and shine a little bit and oh brother brandon was just looking around and he started to look down there and all of a sudden he he saw a rainbow come out across the valley there and he started just thinking of revelations four he's to look upon like sardis and jasper and he had a rainbow above his head he said austin he heard the coyote holler up from the canyon there and oh he just started seeing god and everything he just started to get so excited brother brandon just started running around the tree oh he'd stop and look at how he started running around the tree running around the tree he was just so excited out there and in god's nature just seeing god everywhere and all of a sudden he hears a chatter chatter chat chatter he's out there enjoying himself and he turns around he says he saw some little uh pine squirrel just making all the noise in the world trying to try to try to try to chatter he's like what what what in the world this is a noisy guy why why is this guy so noisy and he started to really go he i was he he was chattering at me because i got so excited and i was running around the tree and then he noticed he said oh no he wasn't excited about me there was a little eagle that got come down out of the storm there and he said he was kind of finding some shelter under some blow down trees that had blown down in a storm as that eagle had just come out from amongst those trees and he was starting to make his way out there out of the cover and there boy that that pine squirrel just wasn't happening haven't it cha cha cha cha just just going off on him and the prophet goes well huh well this is interesting you know lord why did you bring my attention for i was just praising you i was just having a good time praising the lord and looking at nature oh why why did you bring my attention over to this eagle and he started to look at the eagle and he goes oh yeah okay maybe because it's it's brave yeah the eagle's brave and god god wants christians that are brave that'll that'll stand for his word that that that won't fear that won't be afraid they don't wish you washy he says that that's what it is he goes huh he's brave though i wonder why he's so brave and he's like thinking you know what i could shoot him i believe he kind of maybe put his hand on his gun but say you know i'd never do that i hear that squirrel keeps going chatter chatter chatter chatter and brother branham says you know i noticed something though every little bit he'd step he kind of he kind of flutter his wings a little bit and he said that's it that's it before i could even get my gun up and shoot that eagle he would just set his wings and fly and brother branham starts to dramatize how old he just he got sick of listening to all the chatter of that squirrel he got sick of listening to all the chatter of the world he got sick to listen all the chatter of covet 19. he got sick of listening all the chatter of the economy he got sick of listening all the chatter of trump and biden he got tired and sick and tired of listening to everything and all the confusion in the world that all of a sudden that little pine squirrel chatted for the last time and that eagle just jumped and flopped his wings just a couple of times and the prophet says oh he just set his wings and mary lifted higher and higher above all the confusion above all the nonsense above all the noise all and you know god's prophets are likened on the eagles but you the bride are liking on the eagles also we just need to set our wings to the winds of faith and just keep rising higher and higher into heavenly places in jesus christ oh just wait upon the lord keep trusting keep believing it's continuing on in that scripture now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god you we could spend forever right there that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god everything that you have need of freely given your joy your peace your salvation gentleness kindness meekness godliness temperance patience love faith everything everything he's freely giving it to us which things also we speak not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ look we have the mind of christ not just a portion of the word we have the fullness of the word no man is telling us what we can believe we don't have some religion or some denomination telling us we can only go so far we don't have some organization or some man to answer to we have the word of god to answer to and it's in the word where everything is freely given to us that we're more than conquerors in jesus christ all we got to do is take him at his word look we have been resurrected from dead unbelief in his word that's what the denominational ages have had before us they've been able to only go so far but jesus christ has come again by divine promise look and as i say this as we've been speaking about not received a man we don't want to miss the program of god because the scripture says in amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets so you got to receive the word the manifested word which it was the word coming through the mouthpiece of the prophet so if you don't read if you don't accept or receive that word the way it was manifested you're not receiving him you're not receiving the word from god but we've got to get in line with god's program we have received the promise of the hour look at this message has been vindicated just as paul was struck down by a pillar of fire just as moses uh met a pillar fire in a burning bush and there they were led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire but i this message has been vindicated by a pillar of fire none other for 2 000 years the church had been gone without a prophet but according to divine promise in malachi 4 luke 17 30 the very things that we're familiar with god has once again come amongst his people and he has been resurrected among us so we can live that same very life yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you live also look church you can do the greater works you are placed here to do the greater works look don't shrink away from it don't we don't have to make excuses like well um this happened over here and that happened over here and and try to add it up well we're doing the greater works look god brings his god reveals his word by bringing it to pass just continue to believe it know that you're walking in it and he will manifest it just like our prophet our pastor was talking about how god will allow circumstances god will allow situations to arise in your life where that word that's in you will come into manifestation we don't have to go out looking for it you just keep playing your part you can just keep doing what you know to do you just continue to be faithful you just continue to be sincere you just continue to believe and these things will start to unfold in your life look abraham was not weak in faith the scripture says abraham was not weak in faith and i was thinking about that you want to know why he wasn't weak in faith he didn't receive a weak promise it wasn't weak in faith because he didn't receive a weak promise there's some people if they tell you they're going to do something it's kind of a weak promise hey i'll be over there at five well there's some people that tell you they'll be there five you know they'll be there at 4 50. maybe we'll just get on church church starts at 5. there's some people you know that'll be here at church at 4 30 or 4 40. there's some people that'll be walking in or they won't even come back because we're talking about five that would be a sunday evening and right now we're not even having that so let's change days but you see the point there's just some people you know if they say they're going to be somewhere yet you kind of see their their track record oh but but abraham he was strong in faith because he knew who made the promise was able to perform it so there abraham didn't consider by intellectual knowledge his condition his age it says he didn't consider his own body dead and the deadness of sarah's womb he didn't even consider those things the only thing he considered was who made the promise and i believe that's the same thing for the bride of jesus christ who was it that appeared in this generation who was it that spoke the word who was it that made the promise who's the one that said you're going to body change who's the one that said you're going a rapture that wasn't a man that was more than a man that was god himself or what did the prophet say i'm just a mute the microphone's just a mute it has no ability to speak for itself but i have to have a voice come we got to listen to the voice of the sign it was god speaking and we've received a message from god oh i love what our pastor said he said if you possess the promise you possess the results if you possess the promise you present whole glory to god i possess the promise i received the promise that means i got the results you're looking at rapture results you're looking at body change results you're looking at healed results glory to god i'm healed why because i received the promise we read what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them all things are possible to him that believe look when you've received it from god i don't care how long it takes i don't care how long it takes you think of the story of daniel daniel there in the chapter 10 he was praying he was he was wanting to hear from god and finally after three weeks i believe the angel shows up and says hey daniel i would have been here sooner but i had some trouble getting here i ran into some adversaries along the way see the prophet takes that scripture and says look sometimes it might take a little while for the results but you just need to keep standing upon the word look i i love what our pastor preached to put yourself in the story put yourself okay if daniel was praying for something and believing for something and if you can see the transparency here the angel's on his way and yet it took a little while for him to get there oh put yourself with us or maybe you're praying for something maybe you're believing for something put yourself in the story i was just thinking about that all one time brother branham was leaving dallas and he was flying over and a storm came up and his plane got grounded in memphis and there he is he he's in his room he he says oh i could have i could have i could have never stayed in that i would have never stayed in that nice hotel a peabody hotel there in memphis i'd have never stayed in that but you know the airlines it got grounded and they were the ones putting us up in the room and so so i was put up in the room and and while i was there i thought i'd send out i'd pray over some prayer cloths and it's a prayer request and i'd go put them in the mail the next morning so he comes out of the hotel he's going to walk over the post office and he's going there and he's walking along and something tells him to turn and go back and he's like uh you know maybe that's just my own thinking oh my you mean that happened to the prophet too you mean all those times you felt that little holy unction to testify to this person or to wait a little bit longer at the house or to do this or that you mean that that could be the holy ghost he as many as are the sons of god they're led by the spirit of god god wants to lead you just like he let us profit oh we don't have a no we don't have the office of a prophet but you take to heart to what we're saying and he started to go along and all of a sudden hear the and the prophet says he stopped and he started to pray and say lord what would you have your servant do and then he stood there for 60 seconds and went back to his room no he says he stayed there and he says he stood there for about 15 20 minutes just staying right there and the lord told him turn back and go this way the prophet start turns around he's he passes the hotel and he comes up over a ridge and i believe he starts walking down he starts getting down into just some some of the older neighborhoods and he calls them shanties or i can't remember the word he used for those homes he starts coming down towards the river and he starts coming down to this neighbor he's like lord i wonder where you're leading me lord where am i going and he comes on down the way there and the prophet he said is i there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame with the fire that fell at pentecost he's just singing some little song you know just some little tune just going down he's he's coming in this whole neighborhood there and he he looks up and and uh he sees down the way there's he calls it calls it like an aunt jemima just an auntie sees that t you know over there just leaning over about 100 yards away leaning over a white picket fence and he says he just said i just stopped i just stopped to i just stopped singing but i just kept walking along and i got a little bit closer and tears were rolling off of her big fat cheeks he says and she looked up with a smile and she goes good morning parsons and he goes oh morning he goes well uh say how did you know i was a parsons well you ever read that story in the bible about the shunamite woman oh hallelujah yes yes i'm familiar with it think well i'm like the shooter my woman i couldn't have any children and i told the lord lord if you give me a child i'll raise that child and i'll give that child to you but you know my my child didn't live right it ran out in the world and got to running around and my child got sick and now he's laying on the inside of there dying i was thinking of that shooting that woman and i thought you know that shooting my woman couldn't have a child and god gave me a child and now he's dying and there was an elijah there for that shoot of my woman he said where is my elijah oh hallelujah how does she put herself in the story and when she put herself in the story guess what here come elijah walking on down the road oh glory to god she'd put herself in the story and i love how the prophet goes on with this door and he says well and she goes and proceeds to tell me you know last night i was praying and i had a dream of you coming down the road wearing your hat in a brown suit she said i only got one question where's your briefcase oh that was god was working on both ends put yourself in the story he proceeds to say oh he walked in the door there and he said god bless our home and he come in and she started to explain the condition there and say oh oh oh parcel i just can't stand to see my baby die like this not saved so will you pray for and he proceeds to tell the story he says well auntie why don't why don't you go ahead and pray first he says oh my if you ever heard somebody that knew how to pray she started to pray and plead her case before god i want to read something in daniel in daniel 12 at daniel chapter 10 verse 12 says then saith said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten myself before god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words how god hears your words he hears your prayer he heard the prayer of that little aunty that said i was like that shooting my woman and there she was receiving the very fulfillment of her prayer finished praying the prophet god said lord this must be it i don't even know i don't even know why why you sit me down i don't even know what's going to happen i just know i'm here and he starts praying lord would you heal him and all of a sudden he started going it's getting light in here and within five minutes time he was sitting up there hugging his mother oh my god god was coming for her words god's coming for your words you keep believing you keep standing upon that promise i'm reminded of of the prophet talks about these neighbors ladies who come through the prayer line and one of them had an ulcer in her stomach and she come through the prayer line and as she come through the angel of the lord pronounced or healed and said go home and eat and then a few a few people down the line i believe it was it happened to be her neighbor and she also came through the line and she had a a a growth on her neck a couple inches of a sizable growth that was that was visible on her neck and the angel lord pronounced that she was healed said go on your way and believe well that lady who who had that ulcer in her stomach you know the angel lord told her go on home and eat so she went home you know what she did she ate but she couldn't quite she couldn't keep it down she would eat it and she would vomit it back up oh and she was believing god but there was no sign of her healing one week went by two weeks went by and three weeks went by one morning her husband said honey i think you're becoming a reproach to jesus christ oh that poor little lady there just believing what god had told her the prophet says if you're professing if you're confessing the word of god you can never be a reproach you say i'm healed i don't care how bad it looks that's a promise from almighty god and if you've received it from god and if you've prayed and you've asked him he's coming for your words [Applause] and all of a sudden here she was a couple more days went by she was standing there washing the dishes she was just crying lord i i know you said it lord i believe it she's not getting any better she's getting worse she's crying there and all of a sudden a little funny feeling come over her a little cool feeling come over her you know she was kids have already got up and went to school and there was kind of some rolled oats there laying there like well i'm kind of hungry a little bit she grabbed one of them and ate it oh she didn't think nothing of it she ended up finishing up what they had left she kind of hungry and realized she ate a whole meal all sudden she was like you know what i'm gonna eat a little bit more she ate a little bit more and it all stayed down and she realized oh i'm healed so she thought of her mind i'm gonna go tell my neighbor so she ran on down the hill and was going to tell her neighbor and all of a sudden she gets to her neighbor's house she's like oh my goodness what's going on over here and she kind of peeks in on her neighbors everything all right she's flailing her sheets around everywhere and they're like what's wrong with her he's like i can't find i can't buy you can't find what the growth the growth it was here it's gone and all sudden these two neighbors oh they just started rejoicing and praising god and what did the prophet say the prophet of god said the angel of the lord passed through the neighborhood that morning [Applause] he had made a promise and they kept believing in the prophet goes to say he goes what happens if she would have given up what happened if daniel would give it up what happened if you would give up oh don't give up church he promised it he said it he'll perform it he'll do it if you prayed it the angel the lord is on his way for your words he's coming for your words oh hallelujah you shall have a body change you shall be healed you shall have quickening power you shall do the greater words oh you just stand and you believe it he's coming for you oh let's stand i say that jesus christ is here i say if he can pass through a neighborhood and heal two ladies who are standing upon a promise how much more can he pass through here tonight and speak to your heart speak to your need oh you're talking we're talking about not receiving something from man we have received something from god we've received a message from god we've received a divine promise from god we've received faith from god we received a revelation and nothing can take that away just to come back to our text as they play something softly [Music] verse 12 says for neither i received it of man you know as i was just in the back you're about to come out i was reading my text and i started to think about that explosion and by root lebanon if any of y'all have seen it it just was on my heart i was been praying for the people there everybody just living a normal daily life coping with the signs of the times but just going through the routine and just like that a whole city completely obliterated changed why because the things of man are temporary if you're trusted in your job temporary you're trusting in your health the lord tarries look we get healed and get sick again we're waiting for the redemption of these bodies but i praise god he's allowed opportunity for us to experience his power to experience his grace to experience his healing power because that's what he wants to do is have fellowship neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ you have heard of my conversation and time passed in the jewish religion [Music] i pray god we come to a place where we say you know i remember in times past when i thought i had it all figured out i thought i had the message figured out kind of thought i knew what it was all about i kind of thought i had it all put together and i was zealous for it i left beyond measure i persecuted the church god and i wasted and profited in the jewish religion above my equals my own nation being more extremely zealous of traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood why he had a conference with god he had met god and he had had a revelation he didn't need to talk it over and see what other people's opinion was he didn't have to go to other people but paul was willing to die for the message and i say this message is worth dying for but you know what it's worth living for [Music] leave me lord i will fall [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] oh i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] fears [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh i am [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] i am [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] uh [Applause] is [Music] you it just breaks away all confusion amen all the things that the devil tries to confuse and and put it at the different place where we seem to look like we're defeated and all of that god blinks clarity and it just comes and amen i love that that healing angel is on his way amen he's coming to touch each and every one that believes the promise amen are we thankful for his word amen i believe as we hear the word our faith increases because that's where our faith comes from in his word as our brother we don't need something from man we're not looking for an explanation for man we want the word we want what he said because we know if we stand on it he's going to come and do according to his word amen brother chris harris if we could just come and dismiss us tonight amen certainly enjoy that amen god bless our brother amen you know brother mike parks made a comment one time that said there's really only one way to pray and that's to talk god's word back to us amen so every one of us has a need on our heart maybe we could just speak those needs to god this evening lord know that his word follows heavenly father lord we just thank you this evening for your love
