[32:28] [Music]
[32:29] just go before Him Father we want to
[32:32] thank you for drawing us here tonight
[32:35] Lord we know your grace Upon Our Lives
[32:38] as what has made this moment possible
[32:41] father and you as a faith faithful
[32:43] husbandman is rooted out over us and
[32:46] have cultivated us that we would desire
[32:49] to be in your house and to be amongst
[32:52] Believers and to draw nigh un you father
[32:55] it's truly a work of your hands and we
[32:57] thank you for for it thank you for
[32:59] bringing our brother Joseph and family
[33:01] back to us father and Lord the gift he
[33:04] has it's always been special to us
[33:07] father we just now want to commit this
[33:10] service to you each portion of it each
[33:13] ourselves and the hearer The Listener
[33:15] Lord by your grace would you come and
[33:17] minister to your people not that we
[33:19] would have ability not even if we could
[33:22] discern the need would we be able to
[33:24] meet it father but you're the only one
[33:26] who desires to have the preeminence with
[33:28] your people so we pray in all things
[33:31] that would be done that you'd receive
[33:32] the glory and our hearts would be drawn
[33:34] closer to you in the precious name of
[33:36] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[33:40] amen if you have your Bibles and you'll
[33:42] turn with me I'm going to do a couple of
[33:44] scripture
[33:46] readings and uh I just want to thank the
[33:49] Lord for even how he just confirms his
[33:52] word to us and lets us know that uh we
[33:55] we're in the the right way there is a
[33:56] scripture that was on our hearts and we
[33:59] didn't even um understand its its
[34:02] positioning and then the Lord just in in
[34:05] the context of it brought it all
[34:07] together and it's little things like
[34:09] that that uh can give us a confidence
[34:11] because we don't have any ability of
[34:13] ourselves but if you would turn with me
[34:16] um we're going to read in Matthew
[34:18] Chapter 13 starting at verse
[34:21] 16 says blessed are your eyes for they
[34:25] see and your ears for they hear for
[34:28] verily I say unto you that many prophets
[34:31] and righteous men have desired to see
[34:34] those things which you see and have not
[34:36] seen them and to hear those things which
[34:39] you hear and have not heard them and in
[34:42] Revelations chapter 1 and verse three
[34:45] would also Alo also Echo this blessed is
[34:48] he that readeth and they that hear the
[34:50] words of this prophecy and keep those
[34:52] things which are written therein for the
[34:54] time is at hand Revelations 22 and 7
[34:58] Jesus Christ Christ speaking said behold
[35:01] I come quickly blessed is he that
[35:03] keepeth the Saints of the prophecy of
[35:05] this
[35:07] book and for a final reading we'll just
[35:09] turn to Galatians chapter 3 and verse
[35:13] 13 through 14 says Christ hath redeemed
[35:17] us from the curse of the law being made
[35:20] a curse for us for it is written cursed
[35:22] is every man that hangeth on a tree that
[35:25] The Blessing of Abraham might come on
[35:28] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that
[35:31] we might receive the promise of the
[35:33] spirit through faith God bless you I ask
[35:36] the Lord to ask the blessing upon his
[35:38] word and you just have your
[35:40] seats we
[35:43] uh want to just turn back to Matthew 13
[35:46] and 16 and
[35:48] 20 as what we would be fellowshipping on
[35:51] would seem uh maybe a little disjointed
[35:54] the way the Lord laid it on our heart
[35:56] but it really has to do with the
[35:57] blessing that's on the seed but for a
[36:01] title um I want us to just to capture
[36:04] the theme of it even though it may not
[36:06] be apparent there but I want that your
[36:07] thought process to be influenced by this
[36:10] influenced into action okay so
[36:13] everything that we're kind of
[36:14] fellowshipping on the the thing that
[36:17] impressed one of the things that from
[36:19] the weekend that really affected me was
[36:21] just even in one sentence it was placed
[36:24] it said to receive the word for your day
[36:26] is to be able to put it into action so
[36:29] we're not just sympathizers with
[36:31] something we don't just you know say I
[36:33] believe and and then that's somehow
[36:35] ascribed to us but it to truly receive a
[36:38] revelation to truly receive something it
[36:40] will uh put you into action so we're
[36:44] just hopefully you'll you'll find uh
[36:46] that that through what we're
[36:48] fellowshipping on but what we were
[36:52] looking at is what are the things that
[36:55] influence the seed so you as a child of
[36:58] God and what you would bring forth in
[37:00] your life and ultimately what is being
[37:01] influenced is going to be based on what
[37:03] the seed that's in you because from the
[37:06] very beginning one of the when the
[37:08] scripture tells me blessed are your ears
[37:09] for they hear I think blessed are ears
[37:12] because you understand that spoken word
[37:13] is the Original Seed you understand from
[37:16] a prophet's view how God could
[37:19] predestinate a seed and a vessel to
[37:21] receive it and you be the recipient of
[37:24] that and how there could be an amen even
[37:26] in you to to Echo back to the word of
[37:29] God it's because the word of God has to
[37:32] produce of its kind in your life so in
[37:35] that principle we just started to
[37:37] research and what are the things that
[37:39] influence a seed and and now even if you
[37:43] Google things you know AI does the the
[37:45] assist and it's really amazing you're
[37:47] not just stuck with web page hits but
[37:49] it's going to formulate this
[37:50] intelligence where you get this you know
[37:53] awesome answer so we just started to
[37:55] research a little bit on what are the
[37:57] things that influence a seed so the
[37:59] invisible things of God are clearly made
[38:01] manifest in the visible things around us
[38:03] we know that God in nature has declared
[38:06] laws and things and principles that you
[38:08] can better understand what it is that
[38:11] can make you be more fruitful in the
[38:14] seed of God in your life because it's I
[38:16] believe it's swn there and what are the
[38:18] things that are going to impact it so
[38:20] you would find that several
[38:21] environmental factors influence a seed
[38:25] they're going to be temperature light
[38:28] water oxygen soil PH salinity and the
[38:32] depth that the seed is buried and I can
[38:35] understand right now the spiritual minds
[38:36] and just thinking wow this is amazing
[38:39] because God has an appointed time and he
[38:42] he he has constructed your life and all
[38:45] of those things are going to map to
[38:47] certain things that you could say well
[38:49] you know what I I I'm in a hostile
[38:52] environment you know some of us maybe be
[38:54] in a in a in a baby environment you know
[38:57] the the salinity the alkalinity all
[39:00] those things but certain seeds are are
[39:03] conditioned for the soil that they're
[39:05] going to find themselves in God has
[39:06] prepared those seeds for the ground that
[39:09] they're swn in because he has an
[39:11] appointed time for them to come to life
[39:13] and I was just really uh excited and
[39:15] fellow in looking at this so uh there's
[39:18] other things that could influence it and
[39:21] they called them disturbance events so
[39:24] disturbance events could be uh flooding
[39:27] and tillage so something disturbs the
[39:31] ground maybe it's a maybe it's a a a a
[39:35] uh when a bunch of cattle take off and
[39:37] they do a stampede or or you know just
[39:39] natural things that somehow churn the
[39:41] soul and disturb the soul give the right
[39:44] condition for the seed to be quickened
[39:46] and one of the things that I thought of
[39:47] in that and brother brandom even in the
[39:49] in the in the one of the uh sermons
[39:53] influence or God's power to transform he
[39:55] talks about the seed in World War I and
[39:58] how the the field had been completely
[40:01] destroyed the bombs it was all burnt out
[40:03] and they looked and they rolled one
[40:05] stone back and yet there was a flower
[40:07] that was protected but it brought my
[40:09] mind back I remember being up in Canada
[40:11] and they were a poppy a red poppy and if
[40:14] if many have ever seen that it's not a
[40:17] tradition we have it here in the States
[40:18] but they have it amongst our allies I
[40:20] think in Australia and it was made uh
[40:23] popular up in Canada because during
[40:26] World War I as that you know the the
[40:29] type of warfare it was and the the
[40:32] shelling and just the death it was it it
[40:35] literally turned the soil in these
[40:38] European fields and places where they
[40:42] were not used to seeing flowers bloom in
[40:45] those fields but as the War was
[40:48] happening red flowers started to come up
[40:51] and it was even perceived that I would
[40:53] say men were even more spiritual then
[40:56] but those seeds had been sewn there over
[40:58] the years and were setting in that fi
[41:00] dormant and when the war came they
[41:03] started to see a foliage they had never
[41:05] seen really in that intensity spread out
[41:08] amongst those fields and they marked it
[41:10] as a as a symbol of blood they said
[41:14] those flowers those red flowers were
[41:16] upon the graves of men and it was
[41:18] symbolic God declaring their blood was
[41:21] crying from the earth and the and just
[41:23] that condition of War caused a seed that
[41:26] was laying there to come forward and the
[41:28] most if if you will barbaric of
[41:31] situations somehow there's this
[41:34] declaring of a life and a beauty and
[41:36] there's always that contrast with things
[41:39] but the that
[41:41] uh
[41:43] poppy today is still worn as a
[41:46] remembrance to those
[41:51] soldiers and you may think even in your
[41:53] life that you're going through something
[41:56] that doesn't look good but I I I believe
[42:00] that because the seed of God is there
[42:02] even the most traumatic of situations
[42:04] and circumstances God's going to bring
[42:06] forth a beauty out of it that you don't
[42:09] even understand is
[42:12] there there's other things that
[42:14] influence a
[42:15] seed and one of them is the intrinsic
[42:18] factors now that's just the that's
[42:21] that's a scientific word of saying uh
[42:24] the natural ability of the seed or the
[42:27] just the inate uh the inherent
[42:30] characteristics of the seed they're just
[42:32] belong to it naturally they those things
[42:35] uh could be how much food it has built
[42:38] up and in its store those intrinsic
[42:40] factors of a seed are going to allow it
[42:42] to uh come to life in a situation and I
[42:46] just you know to me I look at it and
[42:49] when brother brandham speaks God's power
[42:51] to transform he talks about the power to
[42:53] transform is in the seed itself so one
[42:56] of the things you have to have
[42:57] confidence in is what God has placed in
[43:00] you it inherently has the ability to be
[43:05] German it has the life in it he didn't
[43:07] put in you a seed that cannot be
[43:09] quickened he put in you a seed that the
[43:12] the only thing that can be quickened is
[43:15] the SE germ of God by the word of God
[43:17] it's built in it inherently and God's
[43:19] power to transform starting in paragraph
[43:22] 64 says and everything's under control
[43:25] to bring forth of it kind now remember
[43:28] to bring when he put the seed in the
[43:31] Earth the seed can only come forth with
[43:33] the power of life within it to transform
[43:36] it from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[43:39] was his transforming power now God put
[43:42] the seed in there with the potentials
[43:45] that it would be what he said it would
[43:46] be and as long as it stayed in the right
[43:50] category it could it could be just
[43:52] exactly what God said it would be it had
[43:55] to be that way because had made it that
[43:58] way and he made a channel that's that if
[44:03] if anything that stays in its channel in
[44:05] the line of the word it will have to
[44:07] bring forth exactly like the word said
[44:10] it would it cannot move from there it's
[44:12] Channel just exactly right so with
[44:15] everything in the trust in his own son
[44:17] that it would be that way then God said
[44:20] it's all good so just rest and each one
[44:25] of those seeds has power in itself to
[44:28] transform itself into the species that I
[44:31] desire it to be that's what it must be
[44:35] because I have given every seed
[44:37] transforming power to make out of itself
[44:41] in its potentials now to make out of
[44:43] itself exactly what I want it to be God
[44:47] has never changed just the same today as
[44:51] he always was then God is determined to
[44:54] do something he'll do it nothing is
[44:56] going to to stop them he'll do it
[45:00] Hallelujah the work that he started in
[45:03] you was was a determined work and
[45:07] nothing is going to stop it sometimes
[45:09] you just have to sit back and recognize
[45:11] the seed of God that's in you and
[45:13] glorify God for it because it's not that
[45:16] notice that this is now an inherent
[45:18] quality it's not dependent on anything
[45:20] else it it is standing alone saying the
[45:23] power to transform is within the seed
[45:25] itself amen so God is going to look out
[45:28] over that seed and make sure that it
[45:30] come it's
[45:32] quickened now because the seed is so and
[45:36] Satan understands these principles the
[45:38] guy's been around a while he understands
[45:40] that he cannot do anything about the
[45:43] seed the predestinated nature of the
[45:45] seed and that the seed's going to bring
[45:46] forth of it its kind he can't stop that
[45:50] but what he what he what he does even
[45:53] what he did with Eve his pattern is to
[45:55] try to get there first and do something
[45:57] one of the things they say that that
[46:00] impacts seeds is
[46:03] pre-treatment I know myself I ordered
[46:05] some centipede grass and it came purple
[46:08] I mean I was like what's going on here
[46:10] well that's pre-treated seed they they'
[46:13] uh put a coating on it that kind of
[46:15] would give some fertilizer that would
[46:16] break down so as I sewed it it would uh
[46:19] have a chance to embed in the earth and
[46:21] and they pre-treated this seed so it
[46:23] would increase its rate of germination
[46:25] and allow for a better product well uh
[46:29] you know that there's also other
[46:31] preconditions and pre-treatments that
[46:33] are done but one of the things I think
[46:35] of is as God put your name on the Lamb's
[46:37] Book of Life before the foundation of
[46:39] the world you've been pre-treated to
[46:41] germinate okay he he he he wanted to
[46:44] make sure of it so much that he coated
[46:46] you with the blood of Jesus Christ with
[46:47] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[46:49] the world and he said nothing can pluck
[46:51] them out of my hand you are pre-treated
[46:54] seed of God you I would say it's 100%
[46:58] germination
[46:59] rate with this pre-treatment there's
[47:02] never been a seed that hasn't
[47:04] germinated that's right they're still
[47:07] trying to duplicate that in the world
[47:09] right they want they want 100%
[47:11] germination rate so they they pre-treat
[47:13] now Satan's got his counterfeit one
[47:15] thing he wants to try to do is do
[47:17] something that'll
[47:18] stunt your growth he wants to pre-treat
[47:22] you put a poison on you he wants to do
[47:24] something that's going to precondition
[47:26] your mind so that when the word of God
[47:28] is coming forward to Quicken you you've
[47:30] got a preconceived idea there's been
[47:32] something that stunned it and you know
[47:35] there's a lot of things that in this day
[47:37] and age that really that gateway to your
[47:40] heart to your mind to to make the word
[47:42] of God effectual he is vying for that
[47:44] more now than ever
[47:46] before and the way he does that is he'll
[47:48] do that by presenting you moral causes
[47:51] and he tries to make things more uh uh
[47:54] absolute than the very word of God why
[47:56] it's true because I've seen it on Tik
[47:58] Tok right so he presents you an
[48:00] alternate truth an alternate something
[48:02] that that tells you this is the way
[48:04] things are and you become preconditioned
[48:07] so that when the word of God comes
[48:09] you're already weighing
[48:13] it against other data points that you
[48:17] know I mean they're they're important by
[48:21] the way and that's just because the
[48:23] Satan understands that the betting
[48:25] ground of your mind he's got to
[48:27] precondition it the best he can to try
[48:29] to keep that seed from coming to life so
[48:31] guard your heart with all diligence
[48:34] guard your mind with all diligence in it
[48:36] are the issues of Life those that's the
[48:38] very place where the seed can be
[48:40] quickened and and the only thing the
[48:42] devil can do is try to stunt it deform
[48:45] it and prevent it from being germinated
[48:47] and preconditioning is a is his tactic
[48:50] so so recognize when he in you know many
[48:53] times people would come up in the line
[48:55] with in in brother bram's Ministry and
[48:57] he would recognize the condition they
[48:59] were in was because something that
[49:00] transformed in their life sometimes as
[49:03] simple as a dog scaring them and he
[49:06] would say the reason this happened is is
[49:08] because this offense happened and don't
[49:11] think that Satan isn't trying to do
[49:13] things to bring hurt to bring harm
[49:16] because he wants to unsettle you he
[49:18] wants to make you nervous he doesn't
[49:20] want you to have confidence in the seed
[49:22] that's in you and that's all tactics
[49:25] that he has so when something
[49:27] happens sometimes the greatest thing you
[49:29] could do is recognize where it came from
[49:31] that's the devil it doesn't have to be
[49:35] I'm going to deny its its effect on me
[49:37] I'm and now that I recognize the source
[49:40] I can deny it I don't have to let it go
[49:42] any further I don't have to let it go to
[49:43] seed Satan what you meant for evil I'm
[49:47] I'm blocking you you're
[49:53] done now another pre-treatment they do
[49:56] they do with seeds is is they they
[49:58] pre-wash it with water they'll soak it
[50:02] soaking allows for the germination to be
[50:05] uh accelerate the germination so you'll
[50:07] find and many gardeners they say you
[50:09] know soak the seeds before you plant it
[50:12] that's going to help it and how we want
[50:14] to be Washed by the Water of the word
[50:16] just as much as as the world would taint
[50:18] us there's a word that can wash and
[50:20] cleans us and and and allow us to be
[50:23] germinated by the cleansing by the
[50:25] washing of the water of the world word
[50:27] amen another thing that impacts and
[50:30] influences a seed is
[50:32] timing and brother Brandon and one place
[50:34] would talk about he I believe he was in
[50:36] Finland and he talked about uh people
[50:39] being out with lamps and lanterns during
[50:41] the night tilling the field because you
[50:43] know they didn't maybe have natural
[50:45] means of irrigation they knew the rain
[50:47] was coming they knew the season was
[50:48] right and if they didn't sew the seed in
[50:51] its time in its season they wouldn't
[50:52] have a harvest so there was there's an
[50:54] urgency to timing okay that and that's
[50:57] another thing that you have to realize
[50:59] young people there is an urgency to
[51:01] timing the longer you go on the harder
[51:04] things brother Brandon would talk about
[51:05] your while your heart's tender you give
[51:08] your heart to the Lord you give it to
[51:10] the things of God you incline your heart
[51:12] to the things of God because as the
[51:13] season goes on the ground gets harder
[51:16] there's going to have to be a little
[51:17] more tealing there's going to have to be
[51:19] more work there's going to have to be
[51:20] things done to make that seed it be
[51:23] right and we know God will do it but
[51:25] timing is
[51:27] important and and and I yeah brother
[51:31] Billy a time appointed of the father
[51:33] timing is
[51:34] important um and that is we we God
[51:38] operates in Seasons just the same way he
[51:41] deals with the church he deals with the
[51:42] individual we would recognize that there
[51:45] is a there's a growth that we have and
[51:48] there's a season to things and timing is
[51:51] important
[51:54] um as we mentioned Galatians 4 1 timing
[51:57] appointed of the
[51:58] father I I found this Psalm to be
[52:02] encouraging it's Psalm 31:14 and 15 but
[52:05] I trusted in thee oh Lord I said Thou
[52:08] Art my God my times are in thy hand
[52:12] deliver me from the hand of my enemy and
[52:14] from them that persecute me and I like
[52:16] that because he says my times it was not
[52:20] just it was he understood that there was
[52:22] times of life there's times of season
[52:24] but all of his times we
[52:27] the thing that we understand that man
[52:28] has an appointed time an appointed time
[52:30] to die we understand that there's times
[52:32] for thing and the most solemn one we say
[52:34] well God can't take me before my time
[52:37] but I also want you to understand that
[52:38] God has an appointed time with you there
[52:41] has to be a time where you and him have
[52:43] an appointment that you know God for
[52:45] yourself and and and he becomes real to
[52:48] you that is an appointed time and if you
[52:51] haven't had that time it's an appointed
[52:53] time because he doesn't have another way
[52:56] of qu in the
[52:58] seed there's not another way than having
[53:01] an appointment with Jesus
[53:04] Christ and it doesn't we're not putting
[53:06] a definition on what that appointment is
[53:08] but there comes a time where that he
[53:10] becomes real to you and you know him
[53:13] personally and that it's not your mom's
[53:16] religion it's not your dad's religion
[53:18] everybody else could lose their religion
[53:20] but you can't be
[53:22] lost because he spoke to you and if for
[53:25] some reason every body else sto to know
[53:27] him you can't fail but know him because
[53:29] he's revealed himself to you that's
[53:32] that's what I'm talking about that's an
[53:35] appointed
[53:39] time now the growing conditions affect
[53:43] germinations and that brought me back as
[53:47] in I really felt impressed the
[53:49] scriptures we read you say what did what
[53:52] did it where did we go how did we get to
[53:54] sewing how did we get to seed but when
[53:56] when you look at Matthew
[53:58] 13:
[54:00] 16 this is what precedes the parable of
[54:03] the
[54:05] swer and we won't necessarily go through
[54:09] it but that's where the same chapter is
[54:13] where Jesus talks about the the mustard
[54:15] seed and what it would
[54:18] produce but in verse 18 He says hear ye
[54:21] therefore the parable of the
[54:23] swer and we know that the word of God
[54:26] that is sown in your life there's I
[54:28] would say go back and read it but what I
[54:31] want to tell you is is blessed are your
[54:34] ears because they could hear and the
[54:38] word of God has been
[54:41] sown and that the conditions of your
[54:44] heart are described when he talks about
[54:47] the
[54:48] field so you know it tend you you know
[54:52] as Adam was given we spoke on this
[54:54] before Adam was given a commandment to
[54:56] to uh in even after the curse but to
[54:59] till the field to manage the field to
[55:01] have dominion over it us as daugh Sons
[55:03] and Daughters of God we've been given
[55:05] dominion over this flesh you've been
[55:08] given dominion over your
[55:11] heart to keep it and when you see the
[55:15] cares of Life come
[55:17] in I that you have a an
[55:20] obligation to lean on the Lord I I found
[55:24] myself even on Monday you know a lot of
[55:26] times after after meetings I usually
[55:29] have never come but I just maybe it was
[55:31] the weather it was rainy but I just felt
[55:33] low I just felt like a depression almost
[55:35] came and moved in and and I I had to
[55:38] recognize encourage myself and you know
[55:40] what this is like that Revival effect C
[55:42] things have been washed out now there's
[55:45] now I could feel like maybe a little
[55:46] emptiness now's my time instead of
[55:50] satisfying myself or satiating my you
[55:52] know I'm going to go play a game I'm
[55:53] going to do something to make myself
[55:55] happy I'm going to go read the news I'm
[55:56] going to go watch the replays of the
[55:58] Rangers coming back and beating the
[55:59] Yankees yay um I'm going to go you know
[56:03] I found that that saw that in the barber
[56:04] chair today um but uh but so I didn't do
[56:09] that but uh you what I did is I went
[56:12] back and I started listening to what I
[56:13] heard over the weekend because I knew I
[56:15] knew then when I was listening my heart
[56:17] was rejoicing it was encouraging me but
[56:19] what was it about all of a sudden
[56:21] finding myself in a condition where I
[56:25] had to guard my heart and incline it to
[56:27] the things of God because I was
[56:30] susceptible as a person to to needing a
[56:33] comfort to needing something and that is
[56:36] the place instead of going to
[56:38] your default
[56:41] Behavior which we all do I mean I'm not
[56:43] you know I'm not throwing stones here
[56:45] that it's not going to break my glass
[56:47] house but it's very easy to go look and
[56:50] and just find something because it's
[56:52] become this
[56:54] easy and it's I just had the to pause
[56:56] and say Lord I don't want to neglect
[56:58] what you did for me this weekend I want
[57:01] to go back and look and and go back over
[57:03] it and and allow that seed to be fertile
[57:06] in my life I don't want the the temporal
[57:09] Pleasures all of a sudden to pluck it
[57:10] away I don't want the cares of this life
[57:13] that's a daily thing where you have to
[57:15] end the ground that's in your life that
[57:17] that
[57:19] influences the seed in your life
[57:26] in the also in the power of
[57:29] transformation this is in paragraph
[57:32] 237 it says and we talked about the word
[57:34] of the the word of predestinated you see
[57:38] that stumbles so many of them it's God's
[57:41] word and he used it for We Are
[57:43] predestinated by the word of God and it
[57:46] is in that we when we were in your
[57:49] predestinated why it has to happen
[57:53] because it's that God chose you because
[57:56] he knowed what you would do from the
[57:59] beginning and don't let the devil spray
[58:02] you with education and poison and stuff
[58:04] like that you have to be modern you have
[58:08] to be this you don't have to be nothing
[58:10] but Sons and Daughters of God and if
[58:13] you're born by the word you do notice
[58:16] that spray if you take a seed a good
[58:19] seed and you spray it it'll kill it and
[58:22] when you spray the denominational stuff
[58:24] over the top of you it'll ruin the
[58:26] influence of the original word if they
[58:31] tell you you have to do this why the
[58:34] other girls do it and the other men do
[58:36] it don't you believe that it'll ruin
[58:38] God's influence of the word upon you you
[58:41] know
[58:42] that our text says don't be conformed
[58:46] sprayed but be transformed the seed
[58:49] that's in you people of today act like
[58:52] they don't even believe that there's a
[58:54] God did you know that
[58:57] it it you know that's that's becoming
[59:00] more and more you're scoffed at for
[59:01] believing in God it's mocked it's mocked
[59:04] openly it it's it's something that is
[59:07] becoming more and more real just having
[59:09] the stand and the decency that you
[59:11] believe
[59:12] God is is a principle that is is mocked
[59:19] openly brother brandom addresses it
[59:22] people of today act like they don't even
[59:24] believe there is a God did you know that
[59:25] they act like that now I don't want to
[59:27] call them fools but they act like it
[59:29] because Psalms 14:1 said the fool hath
[59:32] said in his heart there is no God you
[59:34] shouldn't call a person a fool but they
[59:36] certainly act like they are because they
[59:38] don't they don't act like there is no
[59:40] God the word is just
[59:44] ignored I don't want to ignore the
[59:47] word that that's the the it's always
[59:51] that taking heed to yourself that you
[59:53] always have to pause you know Jesus
[59:55] Christ taught us the principle behold
[59:57] the moat in your own eye before you
[59:58] behold the sliver in the other anything
[1:00:01] that is applicable outwardly is
[1:00:02] applicable inwardly and there has to be
[1:00:05] a place where you find you know
[1:00:08] application to yourself and say Lord
[1:00:10] there's probably times I've ignored the
[1:00:12] word and the effect that the word has
[1:00:13] had David even prayed for the iniquity
[1:00:15] he knew not what we want is revelation
[1:00:18] we want isab that we can see there's
[1:00:21] places that the word has to be more
[1:00:23] effective in my life and
[1:00:27] I have to understand that maybe it's by
[1:00:29] a lack of knowledge that the word is not
[1:00:32] being applied because I'm ignoring where
[1:00:35] it can
[1:00:38] be got a lot of text here don't want to
[1:00:41] get lost and may skip ahead
[1:00:46] here but brother brandom goes on go back
[1:00:49] and if you could even just read and on
[1:00:52] in that the power of transformation
[1:00:54] brother brandom addresses several things
[1:00:56] he talks about being in the rental house
[1:00:57] and turning on the television and seeing
[1:01:00] what has become an influence in the
[1:01:02] churches with modern Ricky and rietta
[1:01:04] singing a song and and you recognize the
[1:01:06] admonishment is to take heed to the
[1:01:09] influences that can creep in in the name
[1:01:12] of
[1:01:13] Christianity and
[1:01:16] influence you and and change you from
[1:01:19] declaring the seed that's in you
[1:01:27] he goes on and talks about how Cain
[1:01:30] could
[1:01:31] not down in paragraph 245 just skipping
[1:01:34] ahead says Cain was such a person
[1:01:36] religious indeed certainly but he had
[1:01:38] the wrong seed in him and therefore it
[1:01:40] brought forth the serpent seed Satan had
[1:01:42] hissed out this seed of Eden and this
[1:01:45] brought forth a Cain he put his poison
[1:01:48] on it Cain knew the perfect will of God
[1:01:51] just this week and that really struck me
[1:01:53] it I always looked at uh ishmail and how
[1:01:56] he was put underneath the tree and how
[1:01:57] he cried and God heard the cries of the
[1:01:59] lad I I tell you there there is an if
[1:02:03] you can look how God is so good to those
[1:02:05] who are even from without the promise we
[1:02:08] we should have our eyes of understanding
[1:02:10] open there's this all things have been
[1:02:13] made new if God in his grace could show
[1:02:16] Cain the right way how much more a Son
[1:02:18] of God inclining his heart and saying
[1:02:20] God show me the way show me the truth
[1:02:23] open my eyes give me Revelation of this
[1:02:26] day what you've done in in God on the
[1:02:29] premise of being
[1:02:32] just will open your eyes to the truth
[1:02:35] and then seed of God humbles himself
[1:02:38] where I I tell you what there isn't a
[1:02:40] time where the word of God is not going
[1:02:42] to be open to you and it not bring
[1:02:45] correction not bring a calling not bring
[1:02:48] something that says woes me I'm a man of
[1:02:50] unclean lips and I dwell amongst the
[1:02:52] people who are unclean you don't you
[1:02:54] can't have a revelation from God God and
[1:02:56] and it not condemned the flesh but it
[1:03:01] but it's going to tell you who you are
[1:03:02] as a son and the SE Gene of God that's
[1:03:04] in you and that's the life churn that
[1:03:07] that's the travail of the
[1:03:09] seed but pray God that he opens your
[1:03:12] eyes of
[1:03:15] understanding paragraph
[1:03:17] 248 don't you all when you're talking
[1:03:21] you women you girls you wearing long
[1:03:22] hair and they say why you got long hair
[1:03:24] see why do you wear your skirts how long
[1:03:27] they do you you go talk to them they
[1:03:29] kind of give you the shoulder isn't that
[1:03:32] right see they know they know that's
[1:03:34] right if there if there isn't a lady in
[1:03:37] them see they know that's right but you
[1:03:39] see they can't humble themselves to it
[1:03:41] you're preaching a
[1:03:43] gospel and just as a brother may be able
[1:03:45] to give words of exhortation I tell you
[1:03:48] what when they when the when modesty is
[1:03:49] put on display when righteousness and
[1:03:51] Holiness is put on display it is a
[1:03:53] testimony and they know better
[1:03:57] there's something in them that knows
[1:03:58] better they look at it it preached life
[1:04:00] to them and instead of humbling
[1:04:02] themselves to it there's an the the re
[1:04:06] the reaction is the same that Cain had
[1:04:08] he slew his brother what do they want to
[1:04:09] do they want to kill the influence
[1:04:11] instead of being brought into the
[1:04:12] influence and having that affect them in
[1:04:15] a good way they're they're going to try
[1:04:17] to kill the
[1:04:18] influence old fogy you know even though
[1:04:21] they recognize there's a true virtue in
[1:04:23] it that they're going to stigma ize it
[1:04:26] they're going to put something on it to
[1:04:28] put a reproach and there's many thing I
[1:04:30] even think of you know that the that
[1:04:32] that story of the train and the and the
[1:04:34] girl coming back from college and there
[1:04:36] her mother is she's was scarred because
[1:04:38] she she ran in and she saved that
[1:04:40] child's life and she was scarred and
[1:04:43] marred that that girl could be beautiful
[1:04:45] but because of the friends she was with
[1:04:48] stigmatized wow her own mother it
[1:04:51] influenced her reaction so instead of
[1:04:54] receiving the very person who loved
[1:04:56] her and gave herself for that she could
[1:04:58] live she would turn a cold shoulder to
[1:05:01] it that's the effect and the influence
[1:05:04] that Satan can have in your life if you
[1:05:06] allow influences to come in the very
[1:05:08] thing that can save you the very thing
[1:05:10] that can help you you'll Harden your
[1:05:12] heart to it when it's the very grace of
[1:05:15] God beating out and crying for
[1:05:17] you and how much heartache it could save
[1:05:20] them
[1:05:21] from and they don't even recognize it
[1:05:26] so one of the things that can Quicken
[1:05:28] and affect a seed is
[1:05:32] fire thank God for the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:35] Fire now fire the reason you say what is
[1:05:38] it about fire that is that's needful for
[1:05:41] C certain kinds of seed well heat can
[1:05:45] crack the seed coat and allow for water
[1:05:49] to come in and Trigger
[1:05:51] germination this is needed where there's
[1:05:53] hard seeds
[1:05:56] so you know what sometimes the fire's
[1:05:57] got to be turned up a little hot
[1:06:00] sometimes there just has to be a little
[1:06:01] bit of cracking sometimes everything
[1:06:04] just needs to go wrong sometimes you
[1:06:06] need to be found on your back saying God
[1:06:09] help me I don't know what's going on but
[1:06:11] there's some heat going on because God's
[1:06:14] germinating a
[1:06:16] seed Hallelujah sometimes the heat is a
[1:06:20] good oldfashioned Revival service where
[1:06:22] the Holy Ghost is being poured out and
[1:06:24] someone gets a little con ition that's
[1:06:26] another kind of heat you know but
[1:06:29] there's there's a heat that can crack
[1:06:31] the hardest of shells and I pray I'm
[1:06:34] thankful that God knows how to apply the
[1:06:37] heat he'll he'll he'll crack the hardest
[1:06:42] shell heat and fire causes smoke and
[1:06:47] they have found that chemical compounds
[1:06:49] of a smoke can surround and help a seed
[1:06:54] germinate well you get a couple of
[1:06:56] people on fire for God you get a couple
[1:06:59] of people with a little bit of Holy
[1:07:01] Ghost smoke around them that can cause
[1:07:04] an effect a chemical reaction on an
[1:07:07] atmosphere around some seeds around them
[1:07:09] that can cause those seeds to go
[1:07:11] germinating so
[1:07:15] smoke you know if all smoke no fire well
[1:07:19] you know what praise God for smoke smoke
[1:07:23] can help a seed germinate
[1:07:28] sometimes a little emotion a little
[1:07:29] smoke can help us he germinate it's just
[1:07:33] the way the Lord
[1:07:35] works and he'll get heat
[1:07:39] shock so the rapid so they the seeds
[1:07:43] have a way of germinating sometimes they
[1:07:46] freeze them sometimes they but there's
[1:07:48] something that that tells the seed that
[1:07:50] it's time to germinate and they could
[1:07:53] you could rapidly apply heat eat and it
[1:07:57] will shock the seed into recognizing
[1:08:00] that it's time to germinate and
[1:08:02] sometimes you have to recognize when
[1:08:04] God's knocking on the
[1:08:07] door it's a
[1:08:09] shock there's something going on was
[1:08:11] that you know whose voice am I hearing
[1:08:15] but the that temperament and that
[1:08:17] ability to be shocked the world prays on
[1:08:19] it but that's actually supposed to cause
[1:08:21] a
[1:08:23] reaction spiritually where you look to
[1:08:26] God and I I've seen this and you know I
[1:08:30] I love it when something shocks somebody
[1:08:33] and usually the very first thing they do
[1:08:34] is they look to the authority figure in
[1:08:36] the room and how they're going to react
[1:08:39] because that's where their confidence is
[1:08:42] that's what they look to but shock
[1:08:45] causes somebody to go to something that
[1:08:46] they have confidence in when you're when
[1:08:49] you're shocked what are you run
[1:08:52] to just evaluate your life and what is
[1:08:56] it that your your tendency is to go to
[1:08:58] when you're shocked and I pray that
[1:09:00] you're running to the arms of Jehovah
[1:09:02] that there hasn't been anything that's
[1:09:04] influenced you and the seed of God in
[1:09:06] you to have you be going to places that
[1:09:09] are just keeping that seed
[1:09:12] dormant because the the power and the
[1:09:15] seed's there to tra be
[1:09:17] transformed but if you
[1:09:19] don't allow God to Quicken
[1:09:22] it then they'll just lay dormant in the
[1:09:24] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:09:27] brother Brandon would say it is not that
[1:09:29] the person that comes predestinated
[1:09:31] eternally from God it's the word or the
[1:09:34] seed that is it way back too far back
[1:09:39] for the human mind to grasp the Eternal
[1:09:42] god with eternal thoughts thought and
[1:09:44] decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[1:09:47] I hated Romans 913 and neither was born
[1:09:51] and neither had done good or evil see
[1:09:55] it was thought and that thought became
[1:09:59] expressed and God brought back
[1:10:02] Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob
[1:10:07] alone had the seed that is why he had
[1:10:10] respect to the birthright and the
[1:10:12] Covenant of God if you are true seed you
[1:10:16] will hear that word the spirit will
[1:10:18] baptize you in the body of Christ
[1:10:21] filling you and empowering you and you
[1:10:23] will receive the word for your day and
[1:10:29] age when God determines to do something
[1:10:33] he will do
[1:10:36] it this
[1:10:38] this we're not now dealing with a petty
[1:10:42] God God's a good
[1:10:46] God that's
[1:10:49] destroyed if you look at the very
[1:10:51] beginning each seed must bring forth of
[1:10:54] its kind
[1:10:56] and there's a day and age and a
[1:10:58] manifestation for the word for its day
[1:11:00] that declares what the seed was we
[1:11:03] cannot in our day declare the fruit for
[1:11:05] another day and then claim to be
[1:11:07] predestinated seed for our
[1:11:09] day right you can't you have to receive
[1:11:13] the it's for your age for your day it's
[1:11:17] it's time
[1:11:18] specific that if you take that
[1:11:21] out then you cannot be convinced and
[1:11:24] concerned about what you got everybody
[1:11:27] else could build their own boat and it's
[1:11:29] going to weather the
[1:11:30] storm there's a lot of good churches and
[1:11:33] orphanages out there they're doing a lot
[1:11:35] of good works they believe in Jesus
[1:11:37] Christ and they've they've got a form of
[1:11:40] godliness and they're okay because
[1:11:44] they're going to
[1:11:45] float they'll withstand the test of this
[1:11:47] age have any of
[1:11:51] them I I every single one of them the
[1:11:54] ones that you thought thought had a
[1:11:55] standard don't have a
[1:11:57] standard and you can tell me you're
[1:11:59] going to be a Son of God and stomach
[1:12:01] that that you're going to sit and join
[1:12:03] yourself to something places that tell
[1:12:05] you to put your name on their book to be
[1:12:07] a member you're going you they've got
[1:12:10] you know you got a fellowship card and
[1:12:12] and brother brandom cried out so much
[1:12:15] against it but that denominational
[1:12:16] thinking we can't join ourselves to it I
[1:12:19] know that there's good people in there
[1:12:21] but the we have to have confidence in
[1:12:23] the seat of God that'll call them out
[1:12:24] and if you don't believe you have any
[1:12:26] part in that then you won't be
[1:12:31] calling and and they in any true seat of
[1:12:34] God is is looking for a way of escape
[1:12:37] from those those pest
[1:12:40] houses they they they have no truth in
[1:12:44] them they're
[1:12:46] Antichrist they're false ways of an
[1:12:48] antichrist is a false way of
[1:12:51] Salvation And when you understand that
[1:12:53] they're presenting a false way of
[1:12:54] salvation you should be convinced and
[1:12:56] concerned you should know that we've
[1:12:58] received a word that has set us free
[1:13:01] that's called us out it's the eagle cry
[1:13:03] it's something that's called us with the
[1:13:05] heavenly vision to know recognize our
[1:13:07] day and its
[1:13:14] message in back in the power of
[1:13:17] transformation
[1:13:20] 275 that's what the church call is today
[1:13:23] is I counsel thee to come to buy me Sav
[1:13:27] for your eyes that you might be Anointed
[1:13:29] with my Sav and that you'll see let the
[1:13:32] Holy Spirit come upon any person that's
[1:13:34] truly got something down there a healing
[1:13:37] comes from
[1:13:43] inside you know if you just recognize
[1:13:46] how blessed you
[1:13:48] are that that all of this is because God
[1:13:51] deposited something in you that when the
[1:13:54] Holy Spirit does call when the word does
[1:13:56] call it causes an effect in you that we
[1:14:00] should be so thankful for not not a not
[1:14:03] a piousness but just really thankful
[1:14:06] that God's done that for you let the
[1:14:08] Holy Spirit come come upon a person
[1:14:10] that's truly something down there a
[1:14:12] healing comes from inside let that
[1:14:14] healing come from the spirit that's in
[1:14:15] you it is a genuine Spirit anointing the
[1:14:18] genuine seed it can't do nothing but
[1:14:20] bear a son and daughter of
[1:14:22] God but the genuine Spirit can come upon
[1:14:25] a CLE bird seed and the rain can fall
[1:14:28] Upon A CLE bird and that will make it
[1:14:30] live just the same as it falls upon a
[1:14:32] weak wheat and makes it live but by
[1:14:34] their fruits you know them see where a
[1:14:37] fruit we are a fruit tree of God bearing
[1:14:43] his word
[1:14:46] hallelujah the word of God is bore out
[1:14:48] in your life it is just manifested
[1:14:52] inherently it is there it is planted
[1:14:54] what God God's determined to manifest we
[1:14:56] don't have to enter into his rest I'm
[1:15:00] telling you all you have to do if that
[1:15:02] whatever the condition of the seed is in
[1:15:04] your life he has the ability to
[1:15:06] transform to Quicken and to bring that
[1:15:08] seed to manifestation and I love when
[1:15:09] the spirit's poured out and it brings
[1:15:11] that seed to maturity but there could be
[1:15:14] other conditions that we can that the
[1:15:16] Lord can use but I pray that we we are
[1:15:18] seeking the
[1:15:20] rain we're letting the spirit saturate
[1:15:22] Our Lives we're letting it become
[1:15:24] quickened CU it will bring out what's
[1:15:26] already in there that he's placed in
[1:15:33] there and just looking at the influence
[1:15:36] upon the seed you can't uh help but you
[1:15:39] know when brother Brandon preaches
[1:15:41] influence he talks about Uriah and z in
[1:15:44] in
[1:15:46] Zachariah and one of the things that
[1:15:49] struck me about Uriah is he was and I
[1:15:54] you know I could get names wrong but uh
[1:15:56] Uzziah thank you
[1:15:59] um but one of the things that he was
[1:16:02] influenced by was
[1:16:05] Zachariah so early on in in in in his
[1:16:08] Reign he was really a great king you
[1:16:10] look at him in the things he
[1:16:11] accomplished uh in being in Israel
[1:16:13] ourselves we we we went down to El lot
[1:16:16] what down in the in the coast and he
[1:16:17] rebuilt that City and the in the books
[1:16:20] would go through and and really speak in
[1:16:22] in in Chronicles of the things that that
[1:16:25] he had done what Uzziah had done and if
[1:16:27] you want to turn there I think we got a
[1:16:30] little time we'll try to we'll try to
[1:16:31] hurry but 2 Chronicles 26 says then all
[1:16:34] the people of Judah took uzzi who was 16
[1:16:37] years old and made him King in the room
[1:16:39] of his father amesia and built and he
[1:16:43] built eloth eloth is it sets down on the
[1:16:47] tip of Israel right there in the where
[1:16:50] the I believe it might be the Red Sea
[1:16:51] that comes up beautiful place it it's
[1:16:54] contrast there's Jordan over here and it
[1:16:56] it was a Oasis just an oasis so he
[1:17:00] rebuilds a great City and He restored it
[1:17:03] to Judah and after the King slept with
[1:17:05] his father 16 years old he began to
[1:17:07] Reign and reigned 50 and2 years in
[1:17:09] Jerusalem his mother's name was jeulia
[1:17:12] of Jerusalem and he did that which was
[1:17:14] right in the sight of the Lord according
[1:17:18] to all his father uh amesia did and he
[1:17:22] sought God in the days of Zariah who had
[1:17:26] understanding in visions of
[1:17:29] God I would say we have the privilege of
[1:17:32] being in the day of a prophet who had
[1:17:35] visions and understandings from God and
[1:17:38] with that instruction and and leaning to
[1:17:40] that understanding we can do that which
[1:17:43] is which is pleasing to
[1:17:45] God we have the ability we know the
[1:17:49] things which are how what you know what
[1:17:51] how precious it really is to understand
[1:17:54] that certain things are an Abomination
[1:17:56] to God to have this word restored in its
[1:17:59] tress to to be able to walk in a way of
[1:18:01] Holiness that is pleasing to him when
[1:18:03] others are are crawling on their knees
[1:18:06] whipping their backs doing all sorts of
[1:18:09] things because they believe in somehow
[1:18:11] it's pleasing to God and we've been
[1:18:13] given things that we know are a great
[1:18:15] value to him and things that are an
[1:18:17] Abomination to him and it's because
[1:18:18] we've had a prophet who was able to see
[1:18:21] a vision and even a vision that could
[1:18:23] even say get back in line
[1:18:26] these are not Mysteries to us they're
[1:18:28] not in in the vision of the preview of
[1:18:31] the Bride it's very astounding the
[1:18:33] things that he sees in that those are
[1:18:35] things that we all should be seeking the
[1:18:37] Lord and knowing for our day and
[1:18:40] understanding this is the if you seek
[1:18:42] the prophet's advice those are things
[1:18:45] you should all
[1:18:46] know and and are given to you to know
[1:18:50] because he sought
[1:18:53] God in the days of Zechariah but what
[1:18:56] what
[1:18:57] happened
[1:18:59] is he he got lifted up he tried to
[1:19:02] assume a role that were not was not his
[1:19:04] and this is after many mighty Deeds
[1:19:06] there was things accomplishments Tower
[1:19:08] rebuilding towers of Jerusalem there's a
[1:19:10] lot of things that he could look at and
[1:19:12] if you will he could encourage himself
[1:19:15] but you have to recognize that pride is
[1:19:17] a very evil thing the one thing that
[1:19:19] should always be happening is as the
[1:19:21] word comes as we identify who we are
[1:19:23] it's not to make ourselves great but it
[1:19:25] makes us less and it makes him greater
[1:19:27] it's all be it's not about the bride the
[1:19:30] church it's us it's us it's us but there
[1:19:32] should be something in us that's saying
[1:19:34] ABA father it should be something that's
[1:19:36] looking up in great it's we can only as
[1:19:39] the moon reflect his light there's
[1:19:41] nothing that we're ascribing to
[1:19:42] ourselves that gives us Glory or stature
[1:19:45] or status but the more we see of him the
[1:19:48] Lesser we
[1:19:50] become and and that's just a that's one
[1:19:53] way that Satan's going to try to
[1:19:54] influence the seed right is going he'll
[1:19:56] get you lifted up we're not seeking
[1:19:58] after a supernatural offer you come out
[1:20:01] of meetings you come out of things and
[1:20:02] you you feel like you want to see
[1:20:04] something Supernatural but the very most
[1:20:06] important thing that you could see is
[1:20:08] that your heart is now inclined to the
[1:20:10] things of God and the word of God and
[1:20:12] you're wanting to see the word of God
[1:20:14] minister to your life and become more
[1:20:15] effective but if you want to do
[1:20:17] something Supernatural if you're wanting
[1:20:19] to do something that can give you more
[1:20:22] status
[1:20:25] as a super chis super
[1:20:27] duper I came out of the weekend feeling
[1:20:30] pretty super
[1:20:31] duper and then I fa myself on
[1:20:34] Monday I wasn't so super duper matter of
[1:20:37] fact the devil's buffeted me in my flesh
[1:20:38] he's a liar you know I that's but
[1:20:43] where's my confidence it's in the seed
[1:20:45] of God that he's placed in me that what
[1:20:48] God has started in me he's going to
[1:20:50] finish I'm not resting on the any super
[1:20:52] duper I'm not resting on anything my
[1:20:54] works I'm not resting in my ability to
[1:20:58] go spread some incense and get lifted up
[1:21:02] but I am content with the word of God
[1:21:04] that's been provided to me by a prophet
[1:21:06] and and go read 2 Chronicles chapter 26
[1:21:09] if if you're just catching little pieces
[1:21:11] and don't know what I'm talking about
[1:21:13] you can read a school book you can read
[1:21:15] that chapter of the
[1:21:16] Bible um but he he becomes in a fall and
[1:21:21] he's smitten with Leprosy and the other
[1:21:23] thing that that is astounding to me is
[1:21:25] so here's a prophet he could receive
[1:21:27] instruction from a prophet but then when
[1:21:29] the ministry comes and tells him don't
[1:21:31] do this he doesn't listen to the
[1:21:35] ministry now I would have to assume that
[1:21:38] if if if if if the prophet was there and
[1:21:42] him having the confidence in the prophet
[1:21:44] and the prophet could have actually
[1:21:46] apprehended him and stopped him I
[1:21:47] believe he would have listened to the
[1:21:49] prophet but for some reason there was an
[1:21:52] an idea that he had that the ministry
[1:21:55] could not correct him and he would not
[1:21:58] receive the correction from the ministry
[1:22:01] when they tried to tell him don't do
[1:22:04] this even though the they were preaching
[1:22:06] the exact same thing this was an
[1:22:08] ordinance they had received it wasn't
[1:22:10] contrary to the prophets it was
[1:22:12] absolutely according to the prophets but
[1:22:14] he could not receive the instruction
[1:22:16] from the priest from the ministry from
[1:22:18] the Levites and we should never think
[1:22:22] that God has stopped his work if we're
[1:22:24] not not perfect there's a perfecting of
[1:22:26] the saints that God is still doing
[1:22:27] through a five-fold Ministry and that is
[1:22:30] something that is still in operation
[1:22:32] that is still working and we want to be
[1:22:34] sensitive to the way the Lord would use
[1:22:35] it because it's all Jesus Christ and if
[1:22:38] it's not Jesus Christ we don't want
[1:22:42] it but one of the things that was that
[1:22:47] you could say was an influence and
[1:22:48] brother brandham and in just closing
[1:22:50] just finding a place to close seeing
[1:22:53] someone else's fault
[1:22:55] was actually impactful upon one of the
[1:22:57] greatest prophets Isaiah brother brandom
[1:22:59] said that caused him to recognize that
[1:23:01] he could not rest his confidence in
[1:23:04] man that he he be he all of a sudden
[1:23:09] realized a
[1:23:10] shock something happened and sometimes
[1:23:14] that happens where we recognize that we
[1:23:16] can't have confidence in man and I I
[1:23:19] tell you it can have the same benefit
[1:23:22] for us that it had for Isaiah it can ca
[1:23:24] us to to seek God and recognize that we
[1:23:28] need to have a holy ghost experience for
[1:23:30] ourselves that'll keep us that'll purify
[1:23:32] us to cleanse us to let us to and the
[1:23:35] experience you must have is one that you
[1:23:37] recognize that you need cleansing that
[1:23:40] you need sanctification that you need
[1:23:42] the filling of the holy spirit so that
[1:23:44] you could say Lord send me there's
[1:23:46] there's there's a result of a true
[1:23:50] experience with the Lord and it can
[1:23:52] transpire all at one time but at the end
[1:23:54] of it you're going to be Sanctified and
[1:23:55] set aside for service you're going to be
[1:23:57] cleansed out burned out you're going to
[1:23:59] have your mind settled and you're going
[1:24:01] to be able to say Lord touch my lips
[1:24:04] with your holy coal Purify Me So there
[1:24:07] could be something of real virtue that
[1:24:09] could come from my life no longer David
[1:24:12] McGary but the
[1:24:14] very effect of a touched life in my life
[1:24:33] brother Brandon would say an influence
[1:24:35] of
[1:24:36] another just the effect
[1:24:44] of in ver uh chapter paragraph
[1:24:49] 190 remember it was when Isaiah made his
[1:24:52] confession that he was wrong
[1:24:55] he had been altogether wrong he had been
[1:24:57] leaning upon his Creed see leaning upon
[1:25:00] the man a manmade aair he' saw a king
[1:25:03] that was a great man he was a religious
[1:25:06] man but he saw that all men will fail
[1:25:09] see but when he changed that and he
[1:25:12] looked up and he saw a vision who God
[1:25:15] was and then he said I want to confess
[1:25:18] I'm wrong them old Creeds won't work no
[1:25:20] more because they're all dead and filed
[1:25:23] see
[1:25:24] there's Le they're leprosy stricken but
[1:25:27] I've seen the glory of God made manifest
[1:25:30] a Creed can't manifest that a Creed
[1:25:33] can't see say it that way a Creed can't
[1:25:36] do it that way it takes Christ to do it
[1:25:38] that way and as soon as he saw that he
[1:25:41] saw he said now I've been altogether
[1:25:45] wrong Lord and then come the
[1:25:48] cleansing then come the commissioning oh
[1:25:51] my it was then that he would he cleansed
[1:25:54] Isaiah
[1:25:56] and that is when I look at this message
[1:26:01] this was Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ there's nothing else could
[1:26:05] declare it this way could vindicate it
[1:26:07] this way and there's a standard and a
[1:26:09] calling that this message has called us
[1:26:12] to that we can no longer say I'm
[1:26:15] satisfied with anything less than
[1:26:16] Perfection I want to be a fully
[1:26:18] manifested Son of God I want to have
[1:26:21] complete Dominion I cannot wait till the
[1:26:23] translation this body when we finally as
[1:26:26] Sons and Daughters of God step out and
[1:26:28] and take our flight where death itself
[1:26:30] is is placed under our foot and we take
[1:26:32] a body change that is the message that
[1:26:36] was delivered to us in power in
[1:26:40] demonstration with what no man can do
[1:26:44] nothing else out there declares
[1:26:48] it that's
[1:26:50] the effect that it should have on us
[1:26:55] if the musicians can come we'll just
[1:26:56] find a place to to
[1:27:09] stop if you are true seed if you are
[1:27:13] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you
[1:27:16] will esteem his word above your
[1:27:18] necessary
[1:27:22] meat seed of discrepancy God planted his
[1:27:25] seed and his seed is Christ where God
[1:27:29] decided to put his name look he is the
[1:27:32] only way of Escape he's the only true
[1:27:35] potentate he's the only true God none
[1:27:38] besides him I am God and God Alone he
[1:27:41] said Jesus said this is the Commandment
[1:27:43] hear ye oh Israel I am the Lord your God
[1:27:46] just one God I am he why do you look to
[1:27:48] another another will come I come in my
[1:27:51] father's name and you receive me not but
[1:27:54] another will come in his own name and
[1:27:57] you will receive him and they do and
[1:28:00] they did it at NAA are you a Christian
[1:28:02] I'm a Baptist are you a Christian I'm a
[1:28:04] Pentecostal are you a Christian I'm a
[1:28:06] Methodist another name let's not be
[1:28:09] guilty but when it comes to the name of
[1:28:11] Jesus Christ they walk just as far from
[1:28:15] it as they can they don't want nothing
[1:28:17] to do with it for he is the word and the
[1:28:20] word declares itself notice the only way
[1:28:23] of Escape he is the rose of Sharon the
[1:28:25] Bible said he was every title in the
[1:28:28] Bible of God belongs to Jesus Christ he
[1:28:30] was the alpha the Omega the beginning
[1:28:32] the end he was that which is and shall
[1:28:34] come the root The Offspring of David
[1:28:37] both root and offspring of David the
[1:28:39] Morning Star the rose of Sharon the lily
[1:28:41] of the valley the alpha the Omega the
[1:28:43] father son Holy Ghost all in Jesus
[1:28:46] Christ he was the full manifestation of
[1:28:48] Jehovah God made flesh to dwell amongst
[1:28:50] us exactly what he was he was the Rose
[1:28:53] of Sharon what what they did do to the
[1:28:56] Rose of Sharon they squeeze it out mash
[1:28:58] it out and get the perfume out of it
[1:29:00] it's a beautiful rose has to be squeezed
[1:29:03] down to get the perfume from the rose
[1:29:05] that was a beautiful life there's never
[1:29:07] been a life like it but it had to be
[1:29:09] squeezed out on Calvary sea they took
[1:29:12] the anointing of the Rose of Sharon they
[1:29:14] put it upon Aaron and he had the
[1:29:15] anointing with that to go in before the
[1:29:19] Lord in the Holy place in the Holy Veil
[1:29:22] he had to be Anointed with the of Sharon
[1:29:24] to go sprinkle The Mercy Seat each year
[1:29:27] and that anointing must be upon him a
[1:29:30] sweet smelling savior unto the Lord
[1:29:33] packing the blood of the lamb before him
[1:29:35] after he had also sprinkled the lamb
[1:29:38] preganat and the Bells around his
[1:29:40] garments he'd walk a certain step plain
[1:29:43] holy holy holy unto the Lord notice he's
[1:29:46] the rose of Sharon the sweet smelling
[1:29:48] savior the anointing upon his people the
[1:29:51] anointing upon his people that's you
[1:29:54] you've been sprinkled with the rose of
[1:29:55] Sharon with the life of Calvary that's
[1:29:58] been meshed out it's a sweet selling
[1:30:00] smelling Savor under the Lord that's the
[1:30:03] perfume that should be in your life an
[1:30:05] identity with the crush smitten life of
[1:30:09] Calvary not another
[1:30:12] identity not another
[1:30:15] influence notice he's the Rosa sharing
[1:30:17] the sweet smelling savior the anointing
[1:30:19] upon his people you cannot come before
[1:30:22] him with any Creed
[1:30:24] with any other thing but the anointing
[1:30:27] with the rose of Sharon the word he is
[1:30:30] the lily of the
[1:30:35] valley the lily of the valley means
[1:30:37] something to
[1:30:38] me when I was in high school I'd lost
[1:30:42] friends acquaintances to Opium to
[1:30:45] overdose to
[1:30:47] addiction and I'd often tell them about
[1:30:50] the real lily of the
[1:30:52] valley I knew what it was was because a
[1:30:54] prophet told
[1:31:01] me now you know how they get the
[1:31:05] opium you get opium you take a Lily and
[1:31:08] squeeze it out you get the opium doctors
[1:31:11] use it in their Laboratories take a man
[1:31:14] that's nervous and flustered a woman she
[1:31:17] feels she's going to go crazy she's
[1:31:20] walking the floor and screaming she's in
[1:31:23] hysterics
[1:31:24] a doctor will take a little of this Lily
[1:31:26] opium and push it into her arm or vein
[1:31:29] somewhere or his and they'll quiet down
[1:31:33] it's all over for a
[1:31:39] while but as soon as that opium dies out
[1:31:44] here they come again worse than there
[1:31:48] was but I tell you
[1:31:51] friends that's only a type of the Gen
[1:31:54] one opium from the lily of the
[1:31:57] valley that I know
[1:32:00] of he is the lily of the valley he was
[1:32:03] squeezed out on Calvary he was wounded
[1:32:06] for our
[1:32:07] transgressions with his stripes we were
[1:32:10] healed and in that that squeezing out of
[1:32:13] the flowers he was a flower he was the
[1:32:16] greatest flower that ever growed was the
[1:32:19] lily of the valley the great Rose of
[1:32:22] Sharon now he hanst night spanning
[1:32:24] between Heaven and Earth I
[1:32:27] believe he was that time rather to take
[1:32:31] away the sin of the world and bring
[1:32:33] healing back to the world and the Bible
[1:32:36] said that he's the same yesterday today
[1:32:39] and
[1:32:40] forever God bless you let's just
[1:32:45] stand the
[1:32:47] same seed that produced Jesus Christ at
[1:32:51] Calvary they would look at that final
[1:32:54] result which was a life being squeezed
[1:32:56] out and they would deem it
[1:32:58] failure and I tell you the world may not
[1:33:02] esteem the testimony of Christ in your
[1:33:04] life very much but to God it could be
[1:33:07] the very sweet smelling Rose of
[1:33:10] Sharon and to others and what you go
[1:33:14] through it could be the very
[1:33:16] comfort and the Very balm that could
[1:33:18] take someone that would have been
[1:33:22] lost and bring life let's just go before
[1:33:26] him and pray Heavenly Father we thank
[1:33:29] you for the seed that you've deposited
[1:33:30] in US Lord as you've given us to be
[1:33:35] husbandmen and stewards of our hearts
[1:33:37] and the ground that you've planted the
[1:33:39] seed ask that you'd give us wisdom Lord
[1:33:42] to know how to cultivate it to keep the
[1:33:44] things away from it that shouldn't be
[1:33:46] there Lord and we want to thank you for
[1:33:48] the things you do in our life to Quicken
[1:33:50] that seed Lord maybe there Hard Times

[1:33:57] father but we know you're working all
[1:33:59] things to the good to manifest that
[1:34:01] which you've

[1:34:05] what you've planted Lord we have
[1:34:07] confidence in you and your word we're
[1:34:09] not resting in the confidence of the
[1:34:11] things we could show outwardly or do
[1:34:13] with our hands but our very confidence
[1:34:16] is in the seed that you've planted in US
[1:34:18] Lord and truly only you can glory in
[1:34:20] that because we didn't plan it you you
[1:34:23] planted
[1:34:24] it Lord we've just come to recognize

[1:34:29] us so allow us to do our part
[1:34:33] father I just pray that your bride that
[1:34:37] sits here Lord that each one would be
[1:34:38] blessed for having been in your house

[1:34:47] precious name of our Lord and Savior

[1:38:56] through
[1:38:58] me
[1:39:00] Hallelujah blessed are your eyes for
[1:39:04] they can see blessed are your ears
[1:39:07] because they can hear what is it the
[1:39:09] Master's seed in you you know I was
[1:39:12] thinking about it as our brother was
[1:39:13] speaking often time we think oh it's the
[1:39:16] seed of God in us and don't forget the
[1:39:19] seed was there before the body could be
[1:39:21] that's right but before this body can
[1:39:24] come into flesh the seed existed before
[1:39:27] so it's not necessarily that the body
[1:39:29] owns the seed it's the SE that owns the
[1:39:32] body it's the seed that will take the
[1:39:34] body under
[1:39:36] subjection oh my it's how did you come
[1:39:39] to church the seed brought you here it's
[1:39:41] not your body that said well I have a
[1:39:43] seed I got to go to church no the seed
[1:39:46] said we're not going to stay home we're
[1:39:47] going to church whatever the seed has
[1:39:50] need of God drags it whatever wherever
[1:39:54] you are if it's time that the sun is G
[1:39:56] now remember it's the Sun that brings
[1:39:59] the seed into maturity it's the drawing
[1:40:02] power of the word of God when the word
[1:40:05] begins to draw it says it doesn't matter
[1:40:08] if the seed is under a rock it doesn't
[1:40:11] matter if you P concrete on top of it it
[1:40:14] doesn't matter it it will find the crack
[1:40:17] somewhere it's going to show
[1:40:19] up and I'm thankful because this
[1:40:22] Christianity
[1:40:24] it's not something that you produce on
[1:40:26] yourself oh I got to be a Christian I
[1:40:28] got to be no somehow something inside of
[1:40:31] you is saying you're going to live a
[1:40:33] Christian
[1:40:34] Life you're like I did this I fell here
[1:40:37] I done this I went don't worry about it
[1:40:40] you're going to live a Christian Life
[1:40:42] why because there there's a seed inside
[1:40:44] of you it's made to only be drawn by the
[1:40:48] power of the word it's made to only be
[1:40:50] anointed by the spirit of God so it
[1:40:53] could produce what God wanted it in the
[1:40:56] beginning it's his work like our brother
[1:40:58] was saying I love it the that if you
[1:41:00] take a seed it has the ability to to get
[1:41:03] water in it the fire every the nutrients
[1:41:06] and everything now the rock doesn't have
[1:41:09] the same ability or rock you can only
[1:41:12] hit it up and cool it down it will hear
[1:41:14] the same word and get hard and then
[1:41:16] after word it gets cooler but a seed
[1:41:19] will take it and it will drink the word
[1:41:21] and it will drink the word and and
[1:41:24] sometimes it doesn't look like you're
[1:41:25] like all this water we've been pulling
[1:41:28] we we're pouring we don't see anything
[1:41:30] but just give it a little while just be
[1:41:32] patient just wait a little while all of
[1:41:35] the sudden you'll see the ground
[1:41:36] cracking up and something begin to show
[1:41:39] up and then a Shute will put up here a
[1:41:42] little leaf over here why the seed is
[1:41:44] coming into maturity it's being drawn by
[1:41:47] the power of the word it's drinking of
[1:41:50] the word and they will produce it and
[1:41:53] and I want to say this I I love what our
[1:41:55] brother said our confidence is in that
[1:41:58] seed without that seed we are nothing
[1:42:01] without that seed we are wasting our
[1:42:03] time but with that seed we are
[1:42:06] everything we we read it over there it
[1:42:08] says he put the power in that seed to
[1:42:12] bring forth everything that God
[1:42:15] predestinated for that seed to bring so
[1:42:18] the desire of my heart tonight is God
[1:42:20] just let me drink of the word let let me
[1:42:23] drink like the prophet will say the
[1:42:25] farmer all he has to do is just pour
[1:42:27] water and it says the street seed has to
[1:42:30] drink more than its own portion and then
[1:42:32] it burst open so for this flesh to to go
[1:42:36] away it will take you drinking and
[1:42:39] drinking and drinking gallons and
[1:42:42] gallons of the word not by your phone
[1:42:45] but the word our brother said we have
[1:42:48] tendency to you know we spend eight
[1:42:51] hours and we go where did my time go by
[1:42:54] what did I do with my time no put the
[1:42:56] phone aside drink the word take your
[1:43:00] Bible drink the word put on a message
[1:43:02] drink the word drink today drink
[1:43:04] tomorrow before you even know it it will
[1:43:08] start
[1:43:11] showing and I thought it was so in line
[1:43:13] with even what our pastor was saying
[1:43:15] when when when he was talking to your
[1:43:17] young people here the problem we don't
[1:43:19] keep hold of what we have is the lack of
[1:43:23] of drinking is the lack of reading the
[1:43:25] lack of listening the lack of praying if
[1:43:29] you listen to the word every day you add
[1:43:31] prayer to it you add the reading and the
[1:43:34] listening it will produce the Christian
[1:43:37] because it's made to only do that that's
[1:43:39] the nature of the seed it has in it the
[1:43:42] power of
[1:43:44] transformation amen if it's your heart
[1:43:46] desire tonight to do that just lift your
[1:43:47] hand up to him and let's ask him that
[1:43:50] father we we want to produce this word
[1:43:53] and we hear it what a Believer is
[1:43:55] supposed to be and all of that and we
[1:43:57] know we can't produce in it our own self
[1:44:00] all we know is is the power of the sun
[1:44:03] that's calling forth for that to come
[1:44:05] and all we know is to take that word and
[1:44:07] to drink it the prophet said that the
[1:44:10] Sheep he says he cannot produce Wool by
[1:44:12] itself but all it does is by the eating
[1:44:15] of the herbs and the eating and
[1:44:17] everything that he eats the the grass
[1:44:19] the more grass he eats and eats he said
[1:44:22] all of the sudden that wool will come
[1:44:24] out Lord let us just drink of your word
[1:44:27] let us be just be comfortable coming to
[1:44:29] church and drinking and drinking and not
[1:44:32] worried about tomorrow not worried about
[1:44:34] how am I going to get rid of this
[1:44:36] problem that problem how am I going to
[1:44:37] overcome this and overcome that let me
[1:44:40] just focus on one thing and that is to
[1:44:42] drink of your word let me just worry
[1:44:44] about one thing I can't change
[1:44:46] everything but one thing I can do is to
[1:44:49] drink of the word Lord I will just drink
[1:44:51] of your word and you will take care of
[1:44:53] the rest I'll just take your word and
[1:44:55] you will take care of my battles I'll
[1:44:57] just take of your word and you will take
[1:44:59] care of everything else that's our
[1:45:01] heart's desire tonight Lord we come to
[1:45:03] you Lord we so enjoy the word and father
[1:45:06] God this is the word of
[1:45:08] transformation this is the word that
[1:45:11] called the world into existence in the
[1:45:13] beginning and we believe that that same
[1:45:15] power is the same that everywhere the
[1:45:18] word of God is preached that same power
[1:45:20] is being propagated into the people
[1:45:23] those that have receiv received it has
[1:45:25] received the power of God within them to
[1:45:27] bring about the change that we are
[1:45:29] looking for we pray father that even as
[1:45:32] we heard tonight let not one live out of
[1:45:35] here just think oh I went to church and
[1:45:37] I listened to Brother David Jr and I
[1:45:39] went home no let us have confidence
[1:45:42] tonight that we have heard from the
[1:45:44] Living God that God has used our brother
[1:45:47] and he deposit a word in him and he
[1:45:50] spoke it we read it we listen to it and
[1:45:53] that word that we heard tonight will
[1:45:55] have a product it will have a product it
[1:45:59] will produce something out of us why
[1:46:01] because we have listened to it and it's
[1:46:03] not going to return void it will produce
[1:46:06] what you want it to produce in our
[1:46:08] life that's what we desire Lord not by
[1:46:12] power not by might but by your spirit
[1:46:15] Lord you walking straight narrow way and
[1:46:19] making a word a reality in your people

[1:46:31] us if anyone Desiring anything from you
