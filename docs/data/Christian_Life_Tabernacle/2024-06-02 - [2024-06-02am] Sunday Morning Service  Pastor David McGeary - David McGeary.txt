were at and you pulled us out where we came oh thank you Lord Jesus father you're so wonderful Lord Jesus father when the world counted us out Lord Jesus you never counted us out Lord Jesus we were always yours to begin with Lord Jesus there's nothing that devil can do to pluck us out of your Mighty hand Lord Jesus father sure we can sing it Is Well with My Soul Lord Jesus it surely is well with our soul father not by anything that we did Lord but because of your love Lord because you placed our name in your book before the foundation of the world Lord we're so thank thankful for that father and we have the opportunity to gather before your throne this morning Lord Jesus seeking and asking for you to come down and speak to us Lord Jesus not to hear from a man father but to hear from you Lord Jesus words that would pierce the very life of each individual Lord Jesus go down to where each one is Living Lord and say something that might be able to bless the person Lord Jesus that not a single person walks out of this building the same Lord Jesus father we heard the requests that we're given over Heavenly Father you know them each one by Name Lord Jesus before it was ever spoken Lord you knew Lord Jesus but thanks be to God that we have a word that meets the challenge of the day Lord it doesn't matter how great the request it doesn't matter how small the request the answer stays the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever father if you did it then you'll do it now and you continue to do it always father we don't trust in a happen chance God we don't trust in

salvation in your name amen amen Lord bless you this morning I guess uh many have you have heard that uh the passing of uh brother barudi the Lord has chosen to take him home and uh you know through life people might have disagreements with one another but when somebody loses somebody in their family it's sorrowful you know and we pray for his family and he had many followers people that uh looked to him for their spiritual guidance and now there's a void in their lives so we just pray for all of them that the Lord might find a place that they can find peace and rest and and uh he identified with this me message and I consider that to be a brother when I went to Congo the very first time I had two interpreters one was brother dooka and one was brother barudi and so uh I go kind of far back with a lot of people so we just want to keep them in prayer today and at this time so let us bow our heads together this morning our gracious Heavenly Father Lord one of the great curses of sin was death that the day you eat thereof is the day you die and father all down Through the Ages no matter how great the ministry of men were one by one father the time that was allotted to them came to an end and they went home Paul Peter St Martin Wesley Luther the messenger of our age father they all played their part and father we know there's a Time time that there will be people here that will not taste of that death but will be translated and transformed father and caught up to meet you in the air that's the goal of each of Our Lives father if we are part of that we Rejoice but if we're not we're going to have a life worthy of the Gospel we ask you to bless us this morning as we Fellowship around your word may it bless Us in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated we have a baby dedication this morning and from uh what I understand it's going to be one of many I think we've had seven or eight uh babies born here in the last few months and and that's what we uh that's what we want we want to grow and and be blessed in the name of the Lord Lord want our Quivers filled and our tables full and the fellowship in so we ask uh uh brother Cosman and and uh sister Holly where are you and Grandpa if you're here we want you to come too bring the whole family up praise the Lord I see John you're welcome too if you can come up too we hallelujah oh Christina I didn't know you were here God bless you nice to have you Stephan family we love them see this is the effect that one boy can have right here uh you know and so uh I I look at Gideon and and you notice he's got like four sisters well he got the perfect name because Gideon means F or Rua which means Grappler or wrestler because uh he tore down the altars of baale and uh we know the great story of Faith how that he went in the battle outnumbered but by obeying the word of the Lord he won a great victory so he had to go Beyond Reason Gideon did it wasn't reasonable and it wasn't a a militarily sound but he had one thing he had the word of the Lord and so that's what we're going to pray is that that the word of the Lord is always gide and sword and his might amen so brother hman if you would come so Grandpa come over here too and and we got these three uh Generations here and I think that's wonderful don't you and if the Lord carries we hope it continues on so girls you take care of them because he'll remember you know what I mean and so you be sweet sister Holly congratulations you know what I mean it's wonderful so if you dedicate your son then we'll ask Grandpa to pray and then we'll all pray together precious Lord Jesus we're just so thankful Lord for the gift that you provided in our family Lord we know that the life comes from you and so Lord all we can do is just offer it right back to you Lord knowing that you are The Giver of Life and it's eternal life that you provided for us Lord and so I pray that you take this time Lord that just to dedicate baby did Gideon Lord just like Brother David had mentioned Lord I pray that you make a a warrior Lord I pray that you give him the sword the word of the lord lord so he can take it Lord and just to follow your lead and just to know that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord I pray that you guide his footsteps I pray Lord that you would just continue to grow him and lead him may may you bless us as parents Lord to be the Holy Ghost for him Lord until he receives it and that we would show him the way that he should go and he wouldn't depart from it Lord and that he would keep you close to his heart and worship you and serve you Lord Lord and give all that he can to do what he what your will is in his life for you Lord and for your glory Lord I pray that you bless Lord just our family to be an example for him Lord that he would be able to grow in an atmosphere of love and kindness and meekness and Lord Lord just to know you and in our atmosphere that we would have as a family we thank you once again we just worship you and we offer this gift right back into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Grandpa you want a prayer for your grandson yes absolutely

let's all pray together and welcome him into the family of the Lord amen now he's a part of you and you're a part of him amen because we're all a part of our father our gracious father Lord we're thankful for the shiny light of this family father the faith that you've displayed in Gideon's grandparents Heavenly Father we just ask that you would bless him and guide him and keep him and father whatever part he plays in the great plan of God May Lord may he find it and be a shining light that he might bless those that are around him forever father to live is to live for others father as Gideon of old gave his whole heart to keep the children of Israel in the word of the Lord father we ask that Gideon have the same desire to serve the people and to serve you for we ask it in jesus' name amen amen God bless you good to see you good to see you Deborah have a birthday coming up God bless you girls Lord bless you all thank you so much amen thank you musicians this morning you know I I meet the challenge uh almost every time that I come to the pulpit that I read something and and or I I listen to something that the prophet of God said and it inspires me and and and uh I want to share that with you and so then I I I I go through the Battle of uh well should I try to share it and go through it or should I play it and I just came to the point that I couldn't I just couldn't come come up with the ability to express it any uh better than the way he did it and so I I just felt in my heart it's 30 minutes but it's a tremendous 30 minutes that I would like to play for you and I know that we have several different languages and and uh some people can read English some can't um and we have interpreters and sometimes tapes are harder to interpret and others depending on how fast the prophet goes but this message was given to be our guide through this hour yes and and you we can't make it without this word of life and and I want you to hear it what he he was trying to tell us and then I'll go back and read a few statements and and share with you what's on my heart but I I want us to always know where the source is and someone said to me here a while back he said to me he says well you know if you preach he said aren't you afraid that the people are going to find out that you were just copying brother brandom I said that'd be a great honor that'd be the greatest compliment that they could give me is to say brother mcgui you said exactly what brother brandham said I I heard that on tape just the other day many times that I'll Minister something and the brothers will come back the next day with quotes after quote uh just backing up uh where brother brandham said the same thing and and and that's what I Rejoice cuz uh he was built to get us through he was built to meet the challenge of the hour and to give us the word that would meet that challenge we wouldn't be here this morning gathered together from so many different places so many different countries if all of us hadn't heard that eagle scream if we hadn't heard that voice and and I know sometimes as children or teenagers your parents make you go to church and and I made my kids go go to church and many times I saw him uh sitting on the back row you know uh sleeping and doing all those things but I had a promise that if you'd raise them up in the way that they should go that God would bring them back and they would return you know so now I'm I'm thankful um you know that all three of my sons preach the the gospel and they believe it for themselves and I believe if something would have happened to me that they would continue on and and that's that's a blessing in my heart so let us stand this morning and we're going to read a scripture and then we're going to uh turn to the message called uh identification and we're going to try to stay with uh some of the things that we've been talking about and uh so we're going to uh uh uh start on paragraph 24 I know some of you now can uh have your uh devices or phones or whatever and you can make sure your ringer turned off but maybe you could pull it up in Spanish or French kind of read along and follow with the paragraph numbers or however it is but to read our scripture this morning we want to turn to Philippians of the second chapter and we want to start with the fifth verse and uh this is a a greater a a greater scripture to me every day as I go along life's journey it says in the fourth verse says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Amen Let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my brethren as ye have also obeyed not as in my presence only but how would more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do his good pleasure amen God bless you you may be seated I like the very first part of this message going to listen to and I I'd like to read it uh to you so when you hear it it sinks deep he's telling the story about the little boy that stood in front of the mirror and he said and he waved at him and he waved back at him and he kept getting closer and closer watching the little fella first thing he reached out his hand and looked around his parents was watching him cuz he had never seen a mirror before and he said well that's me so I just wonder today if we could look in the Bible and say that's me amen that's what we want to discover this morning we want to discover our identity we want to discover so let's listen very carefully for thir 30 minutes and uh we have communion tonight so our service might be a little if it's a little long this morning don't worry it'll be a little shorter tonight and everything will work together for the good amen anybody want rather be some place else this morning no I'd want to be in the house of the Lord amen God bless you this morning as we listen to the portion of tape out of identification God bless you so out of this story comes this that these uh people never could afford a Looking Glass they didn't have one and the father had just a piece of a a Mara attacked on the tree to shave by on the outside they had a little boy and he this little piece of maror while he had never been able to to get up to where it was at to see himself so he come to visit in the city with uh one of his uh mother's sisters who had married a man that had come to Indiana and then they lived out there so they had a home that all oldfashioned home used to be they had a full miror on the door sometime when you would go in in in the bedrooms I don't know where any of you remember them old doors or not it had a f length mirror up and down the door so the little boy he got to his Auntie's house and he was running around like any little boy would and and then noticing he he started um to walk up the steps and as he did at the head of the steps when he's getting close to the head of the steps he begin to see another little boy appearing and he stopped and looked at the little boy of course it was he waved at him and he waved back at him and he kept getting closer and closer watching the little fell first thing he reached out his hand he looked around his parents is watching him because he' never seen a maror before he said well that that's me I just wonder today if we could look in the Bible and say that's me as we wonder which one is it um which character in The Bible would we look like and let's just take that for a little text out and stay with it for a while and as we look into God's word let's identify ourself for he give others in there for a examples of what we are now remember that God takes his Spirit or takes his man but never his Spirit Satan takes his man but never his spirit so let's see if we can identify our present State now with Bible characters now they the Bible said all those things happened back in those days for examples for us they are our examples our character molds us to the in of what we are our character of life that's in us now you take a little germ of life and when if it's a if it's a germ of U of A bird it'll produce a bird and if a germ of a of a wheat it'll produce wheat The Germ of corn it'll produce corn see the life that's in it molds a character of it then we' find the same thing like a life of a cancer see a germ cancer germ it molds a cancer it's an evil life uh life of a tumor would mold a tumor so forth you see we our characters is molded but what's on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what's on the inside what we are how we walk no matter what we say our life speaks louder than our words does if we might say I am a believer in God and I'd say well do you believe all the Bible Well I don't know then you see your your your lips your very if your life is speaking louder than than what your words would be if you say I am a Christian I do not believe in doing and I believe all that God said is true then live any kind of a life after that see your your life speaks louder than what your testimony does and you know that's one of the greatest hindrance that the Church of God has The Bootlegger The Gambler the that people we we all know which way they're headed and they know themselves but the fellow that professes to be a Christian the woman that professes to be a Christian and then lives something different it's the greatest stumbling block that the outside world has got if there is in the outside world any words worse than anything the world can produce is a person that's supposed to be a Christian and then live something else different from that lying stealing cheating and doing things that he ought not to do it's a discredit to his testimony when you take people that do those things there and they are there our character is molded uh in there by the life that is in us now we' say uh Jesus came to save that which was lost that's what he did and now they had had to be something to save this lost so it had to be a different character than that which was lost so we find then when God looked down upon this creation of his that he had made upon the his the characters of this Earth his loving character his self was molded into the person of Jesus Christ to be the savior of the world this was done so he could pay the penalty for death for us and redeem us it certainly fulfilled John 3:16 see that God no other person could do it Jesus could been no one else there was no other character anywhere could have produced such a person as Jesus Christ but God himself now there was nothing in the heaven that could have done it you know John looked in the the book there the Bible we find that he saw uh there was no one upon the Earth that was worthy to take the book The Book of redemption and there was nobody in heaven worthy nobody that was beneath the Earth or nowhere was able or worthy to take the book to loose the seals or to even look on it and he wept because in this book was a book of redemption his own name was in there and nobody was worthy and then one of the elders said fear not for the line of the tri of Judah has prevailed and he's worthy John looked then to see a a lion and he saw a lamb and it must have been a slaying lamb it was a bloody lamb he said it was full of blood because it was a lamb that had been slay and a slaying lamb is bloody of course had been slain from the foundation of the world he came and tucked the book there was nobody else could do it because if you plant any like a c Cur in the ground any of you Arkansas your know what a cleur is and put that in the ground you can't expect a harvest a crop of horn out of it no you can't so if you took a cleur and put it with a and crossed it up with a gyss and weed you still wouldn't have nothing see and see there's no character in there but what would produce the same character evil to evil so it taken something that was not evil that could produce a character like Jesus Christ and it was God looking upon his creation and his own loving character seeing that lost yet In His Image made for his glory and see that lost his own love projected Jesus Christ God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that was God manifesting himself not some other person but himself in a body form to redeem what had been lost I wonder how sad that must have been when God looked upon the Earth and it grieved him that he ever made man one time I I had my little girl over the hand and we was up in Cincinnati at the zoo and we were going down along watching the animals and I heard a great noise down below the the the cages where the the animals such as wolves and tigers and so forth forth I walk down there there's a huge big cage all as high as a ceiling perhaps and they just got an eagle a little all a few weeks before that out of U and put him in captivity I never felt so sorry for that poor fell and he would get back he's a big bird and here he was all caged up with some something that man had done it trapped him into something and put him in a cage and that big fell he was bleeding over the head his great bald eagle that big white head and and his wings all the feathers is beat off of him like that and the poor old Fell's laying on his back his eyes weary looking around you get up walk back over the other side of the cage and look up towards the heavens that's where he come from he's a Heavenly bird there's nothing can follow him a HW could disintegrate to try to follow him nothing can follow that eagle and he goes so high his eyes is comparative with his height he can see what he's doing when he's up there what good does you get up there if you don't know what you're doing so God like in His prophets the Eagles the foresees things before they happen now I notice him bleeding he lay on his back and look up like that that's where he belonged but man had caged him I thought what a pitiful sight he get back and he'd fly flop those big wings and just Bud his head against those bars and fall back and the Flor again lay there weary look around like that looking that Heavens where he was free up there at one time and now in a cage I stood there and cried I wish they had sold me the thing I turned him loose there see anything caged up if that would make a man who loves outdoors as I love Outdoors if I would make a man cry to look at that that was a pitiful sight but all let me give you a more pitiful sight is to see men and women who were made in the image of God to bear his character yet housed into things and housed in by the traps of the world see a beautiful young lady coming down the street such a a a real U her her such a pretty woman and her pretty hair all cut off see her face with with a a pretty shaped face with so much paint on she can't tell what she looks like look like she's cankered with blue under her eyes and eyes like a lizard or a wolf or something like that and to see her with clothes on it she shouldn't be even caught into the the bedroom herself with the doors locked with them on and out on the street displaying herself like that and to see sons of God which ought to recognize that to be their sister out on the street whistling and trying to pick her up take her out for bad purposes that's a pitiful sight to see that Satan has caged in the human race there's nothing could save it but a character that could come over the top of all of that yes that there was nothing in it that had to come from that pure Fountain of almighty God that pretty little lady who could be a a real little Queen to some little tired preacher come in and take him up on her laps and put her arms around him and and quieten him down there's nothing will take that place that's part of a man there's no hand can touch you when you're tired more out but a real kind gentle wife who understands man knows that and to see her out like that she's in a cage that Hollywood has put her in and many times them women claim to be Christians and singing choirs but all caged up with a spirit that they can't see there's no need for you try to point it out to them seem like it gets get worse and worse see there they are a modern jell walking on the streets and she I give you to understand I belong to this I see still that that thing she belong to has has cut her off from the resource of life amen amen when she was born to be a little Queen for some man or some man that was born to be a a a son of God and to think what has happened to them oh it's a terrible thing then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God's an object of worship only he was was eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was Express the words and word was made manifest what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are part of God and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem amen and them as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there but if the life isn't in there then what can they do they don't see it they'll never see it see in the whole thing is Jesus said at that day you'll know I'm the father father me I and you and you and me the whole thing is God becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one together God and his church becoming one now now it taken something to redeem this Fallen woman which was typified in Eve when she fell Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression Adam know that he was doing wrong she didn't that's the reason I'm not hurt your feelings but you know I've always stood part I don't agree with women ministers because it's not supposed to be that way see she's the weaker vessel now we find that this woman was deceived by um someone quoting her the word and just missed it a little bit that's what caused all the trouble reason Paul said let her keep silent the church is not permitted or speak so forth now notice but see all that is it's displaying showing by type like the whole Bible God coming together with a redeemed wife a bride that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world that was the attributes of God being displayed and now to make a character that could redeem this woman it had to be something greater in her to redeem her and did you ever noticed I I this may be now if some of my Armenian brothers are uh of doctrine that is legalist would disagree just let me just pardon me for a minute I might project this if he is the Redeemer I don't say this to hurt now it be different I Don't Preach Doctrine but let me ask you something if he is a redeem rer he come a redeem is to pick up that which has fallen to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning so none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning amen he come to redeem not this Canon father that we see around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that was in God's thinking at the beginning Hallelujah this other is just something mies around the show the statue see it is it's a it's a guard and a flower guard it plays its part but the statue is what you want to see the statue of Christ which was God projected to the Earth in the form of a man amen amen that's a statue you want to see that's the one this other is just makeup part you see now this reflected his loving noble character God reflected in a man called Christ he was only one that could do this there was no other character in heaven could do it see was God he was a sinless nature he was the word sinless nature of God he was the word expressed which the word was the beginning and if you are in the Lamb's Book of Life you was God's expression from he stopped he's seen you and seen your desire before there even was a an Adam or anything else and you are his thought made word and expressed in what you are now amen that's God in you reflecting [Music] Christ you know what I mean I I hope that don't interfere with nothing you see and I wouldn't want to say nothing contrary to what you've been taught but just so that you to understand what I'm trying to get to here a reflection you've got to be identified and if you are and you were in God's thinking at the beginning see and was his reflection here on Earth you'll bear record of the Heavenly and as he bore record of the Heavenly also and when he raised up from the grave and was given a body we when we raise up will have a body like his own amen glory body the resurrection is sure it's a guarantee and we have the earnest of it now as the Holy Spirit comes in and identifies us as God's redeemed person the Lord amen when you receive the Holy Ghost you're sealed till the journey is over that is your token that you hold it shows that your your fair has been paid you are a redeemed character Satan has no business with you none whatever this pick up your token and show him my healing is paid for my trip the glories a token is what you use to ride on a bus line or an airplane your ticket is your token see take your token your redeemed the blessing the Holy Spirit and if Satan tries to push something on you just show this that's your identification amen you are identified in the resurrection of Christ you're identified in his death when you die you're identified in his resurrection and by that it identifies you that you were with him before the foundation of the world because you are redeemed that's brought back all the father has given me will come and no man can come unless he the father has given see in the beginning now notice he was sinful sinless to take a place out the sinful the antidote he was with without sin so that he might redeem Sinners God was expressed in him and properly identified himself in him now notice you say brother Brandon did you say God identified himself he did uh in the beginning said St John 1 was the word and the Word was with God now a word has to be a thought before it's a word because a word is a thought expr rest in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God see was God and the word the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us identified how now Hebrews 4 see the word of God is sharper more powerful than a two-age sword cutting aund go coming and going cut aund and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and when he did that that's how the prophets was identified because they God would speak and tell them just what was wrong and what was going on see that is the identification of the word of the hour being made manifest that he was a fullness of God's word for he was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen he was God in human form and took God to express such a character as this and then that lovely life had to be taken from him so that he could save these that God's for knowledge saw in the beginning which was his thoughts of you and me Jesus came to do that his perfect life had to be sacrificed to redeem that person then if they do and you were with God in his thoughts at the beginning how can you deny his word being true yes when you are part of his word amen certainly Vindicated properly they could be no mistake about it he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me now we find out that in the great turmoil of the day the people about understanding God God and three persons God is three attributes of God like three offices God above us in the Holy Spirit up there in a pillar of fire god made flesh and dwelt Among Us a man that we could touch and handle now God in the church God above you God with you God in you see the same God in three different manifestations but the same God all the time notice there be no mistakes his sinless nature expressed God's word and the only way that you'll ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you you'll have to have that sinless nature that come from God before the foundation of the world you was recognized with him before the word can ever express itself through you it takes a sinless nature to do that so much so he was the word in full the word of God flowed through him so freely that even he could speak a word it would create that showed who he was who can create but God God's the only Creator there is and he was so perfect in harmony him and the Word was so perfectly together until he created even he had he and the word being one no other nature could do this no father nature could no character nothing in the heavens nothing else could do that but him for he was the beginning of that character savior the angel wasn't born to savior he was created a being to worship God not a savior but in God was a savior an ordinary man born of an ordinary woman couldn't be a savior because his nature is carnal but it taken God himself amen I hope you see it look that was the expression to manifest such a character as that for others it was a fallen character nothing could save Angels wasn't created for such man was a falling character look how could this man look to show it's the ones that he thought of but his thoughts is the Christian out today the thoughts before the foundation of the world now remember man when he was bned in sin shaped in iniquity comes to the world speaking lies yes is that right right there's nothing in him at all amen so you see if he was in God's thoughts when he come to the world he's come in God's thoughts at the beginning to display his attribute you follow me amen then Jesus J came to break the clouds back so that attribute could display itself Hallelujah he is God's expressed word now nothing else could be manifested other characters are all Fallen then you see what did Jesus come to bring back those characters no no they were borned in sin shaped in iniquity he came as a redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring it back yes amen bring it back it was God's thought you think little you little me no one in the world could take my place nobody can take yours you being a Christian and filled with the spirit got him before the foundation World seen you in not every feature that you got and Jesus come to bring you back that's what Jesus was here for the Redeemer the human body to bring you back that had to come to be a human as a redeemer to display his attributes as Savior come to redeem you and bring you back from where you come from you are when you receive eternal life is only one form of eternal life that's the Greek word Zoe is that right brother Zoe God's own life so you being a son you become part of that life so the life that's in you never did begin that it never can End Amen right Hallelujah think of it it can't end because anything it's Eternal never began the life that's in you never did begin that is if you've got eternal life and that's God for you as in thought on the Eternal and now it's expressed here in a human being for his glory amen Jesus came to redeem that being the son the fullness of God had to come and become that the sinless character God did that he might redeem these other thoughts that to come to him to make a wife see what I mean oh it's a glorious story we ain't AR to get on that anyhow let's go on all right there's more there than we could ever cover here gra gra me my little note did you enjoy that now the the message is identification amen and and he's telling us what it is that we need to identify with is that right so uh and so uh I I just think that there's enough there that you heard to uh certainly uh raise a a thirst in you yes that you would go pursue that a little farther and and listen to what's just been spoke to you that uh and I love the way that he unfolds this he says that in the scripture he said that we should be able to find our identification in the scripture to be able to read the scripture and say that's me that I see myself alive in God's word uh living and uh uh uh and there a character he said in the Bible find some character in the Bible that you identify with that you say that's me I'm like that and that was all planned that way it was all put that way because we are a part of him in the beginning so he makes a statement when he starts out he says the character of something is developed by what's in them so we we we recognize that if the seed of something's in there that that seed has the power within it to transform so he said if it was bird life in the beginning it'll be a bird if it's uh some other life uh in it an animal life or some other life uh it's a bird many times you would refer to like Beethoven or um Michelangelo or or if you had that spirit in you then that Spirit would produce what that it is you'd be a painter you would be this so there's got to be a a a a spirit in you and uh something that is molding and making the character uh that you are and so that's kind of what I begin to if I could say it that way that begin to uh I begin to realize what he he said he said that you have to be identified and I I walking through the uh uh the TSA you know where you go in to get on a plane the guy took my card and he looked at me and he said oh that looks like you and I thought looks like me that is me you you understand now we we're so much right now still in the thinking of it looks like me it looks like me or I'm trying to be you know I didn't look at him and says yeah that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to look like him that that's my goal you know is that eventually I could I could uh have all the features that I look like myself no I'm not trying to look like myself that is me all that picture was was a reflection of me so that's what I am that's me know it don't look like me it don't uh it it it it doesn't uh resemble me it is me it is a picture of me and that's what he wanted to begin to get us to look at the scriptures that way this is a picture of me I'm not reading about somebody else I'm reading about me I I I'm seeing myself in here this is I'm finding my identification I I'm finding I'm I'm discovering who that I really am by the word of God now the world will let me discover the the person that I was born into the world I was born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies The Whole World's identification is of that person that's right that's what they're trying to identify they're trying to identify you as the one that's got to be educated try to identify you as the one that's got to labor and work trying to identify you as this and identifying you that what they want you to do is to find your place in the world well we're not of the world we didn't come from the world we came from there there's another identification that we have there and there ought to be a way that we can uh identify ourselves and the prophet of God made a statement he says in the state that you're in can you identify yourself with the word so that we we find this great mind battle and and it it throws us into a very difficult uh battle if I could say it that or position because you have the word of God telling you that if you had eternal life you always had eternal [Applause] life right he said that God didn't come to redeem this Atomic F that's out there he came to redeem those that were in his thoughts amen amen now you're born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies but you were deceived into that by Eve that's right that that's why you were here and that's why that that that's the the thing that we had is we had a divorcement from that nature that we can become who that we really are I hope that this can move into us because the the thing that the prophet of God said he said this is the age of identification so it it's a time of choosing it's a time of how that you're going to how how that you're going to uh uh do yourself brother I love it when you clap but you got to hold it down just a little bit so everybody else can hear okay you do that for us all right cuz sometimes people can't hear and I want to hear this real good is that that if you get caught in between those two places you understand where you're dealing with what you think you are and what you see you are and what you're doing and what God says that you are it places you into a spot that you're going to have to choose and what you're going to identify with CU said now what am I going to identify with what is identifying me and that that's the groundwork because if you don't start with that nothing can follow that's and so for my little thought this morning and I'm I I I I think there's so much in there that I don't really need to speak very long at all but if if I've always had eternal life is that what he said that I I I I didn't get e eternal life if I have it I always had it you said how how did you always have it you weren't here I I just came here a as an expression of a thought so I was in God's thinking before the foundation of the world can you identify with that this morning can you look at yourself and say I was in God's thinking before the foundation of the world I identify with that and why do I identify that because he said so and he and so I I I'm sitting here and if I had eternal life and I always had eternal life then the question Rises up is what if I've always had eternal life then what was I saved from uh that's right I mean was I I uh we say I I'm saved from sin what is sin it's unbelief it's unbelief that that's what that's what I'm saved from I I I'm saved from I'm saved from sin I'm saved from unbelief now I'm not saved to salvation as as man has always taught it or expressed it but if I could sum it up this way to to uh may maybe help it sink in because if we're going to express our identity we've got to realize what is it that I'm identifying with and what is my char characteristics to prove that's me that's me I'm that seed I'm that person whose name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life that's me I identify with that that's absolutely the the the truth he said so I believe it he he that's what he came to do he came to redeem it back now let's just read this to you in just for a moment and to read it slow and and just go through it so you can kind of see what it is that uh we're we're trying to express here so we're going to drop back in paragraph 72 and just go back through this just for a second because he said you are identified in the resurrection of Christ you are identified in his death when you died you're identified in his resurrection and by that it identifies you that you were with him before the foundation of the world cuz you are redeemed that's brought back so remember redemp is not the Redemption it's redeem means to bring back to be lifted up so he came here to lift you up he came here to bring you back to the characteristics that you had in his thinking before the foundation of the world he came to bring you back now remember how he said the saddest thing that he sees is that man is in the cage of the world so Satan gave certain things to CAG men he gave education he gave science right he gave religion all those things that Satan came out of the garden of the tree of knowledge were all designed to cage you to keep you in bondage to hold you back from manifesting and coming to the character that he had of you in his mind you understand that so we just want to go through that simply he says and we'll pick up here at paragraph 71 let's read identified how Hebrews 4 see the word of God is sharper more powerful than a two-edged sword cutting aunder cutting both coming and going cutting aunder and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and when he did that that's how the prophet was identified because God would speak and tell them just what was wrong and what was was going on see that is the identification of the word of the hour being made manifest so we understand that was the identification but what was that word doing it was cutting a sun cutting to the marrow of the bone try to discern your heart and your thoughts that's right that's what he wants to get you because the battles in the mind he wants to get you to what is your pure thoughts what is your pure desire what are you identifying with because he who loves the world and the things of the world the love of God's Not in them that's not where their heart is that's not where their thoughts are you can't serve two masters either you're stayed on the world word of God you're believing what the word of God says you're feeding on the word of God you understand that this message isn't something to study it's a living guide that comes to you each day and leads you through every situation day by day you've got to live on it you've got to feed on it you got to Feast on it in other words it's that which you find your a in because what's it doing it's cutting away it's cutting away it's carving away it's hewing out trying to bring you into the character of what that God had in his mind of you it's transforming you now is that the desire of your heart that's right is that what you identify with make me mold me turn me into what you have me to be I'm not trying to fulfill anybody else's spot I can't take nobody else's spot I want to be what you made me to be and I I believe you made me to be something not a multiple choice it's not like see sitting in know I went to a uh in my high school they gave these aptitude tests you know and I hat his school I never did graduate from high school I'm not proud of that but it's nevertheless the fact so when I went in there and they did all their stuff on me they sat me down they said you know uh you could possibly be an airline pilot well they didn't know I was called to be an astronaut I was going I want to soar Way Beyond any plane could soar I thought can you imagine me pursuing that career I had to join the military which that wouldn't have worked and or I had to go to college which that wouldn't have worked it just wouldn't have worked but that's what happens when man tries to place you is trying to get you back to the place that you identify without Reserve without doubt that I am a part of him I was in his thoughts now don't look at don't look at your life don't look at your flesh don't look at the man that you were born in the sinful nature that you had because he existed and you existed it before that so now he's trying to come with the word of God and cut that aunder and separate you from that let's just follow a little further he was the fullness of God's word for he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God in human form and it took God to express such a character as this and then that lovely life had to be taken from him so that he could save these that God that God's forn knowledge saw in the beginning which was his thoughts of you and me so now he uses the word save so we're just going to talk just get to the the point of what it is that we're saved from he said Jesus came to do that his perfect life had to be sacrificed to redeem that person then if they do and and you were with God in his thoughts at the beginning how how can you deny his word being being true when you are part of his word you can't do it so there's got to be something else that's bringing that doubt and bringing that struggle and bringing that confusion there's got to to be something else that's doing it remember because it's not him every perfect and good thing comes from the father above but if you had eternal life and he came to restore you back or to bring you back to that then there's got to be something that's trying to resist that right it in you it's something else and we can find its original origin he said B he says his perfect life to be sacrificed he says your perver I mean certainly of Vindicated properly there could be no mistake about it it's not me that doth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me oh I hope we can roll that to ourselves now we find out that the greater turmoil of the day the people about understanding God God in three persons God it's three attributes of God like three offices God above us the Holy Spirit up there in the pillar of fire God made flesh dwelt Among Us and a man that could touch handle now God in the church God above you God with you God in you the same God in three different manifestations the same God all the time right so that's the that's the turmoil and that had to be settled yes it's the turmoil of the church that thinking that separates you from God they first then they had to separate God because if they could separate God then they could get your mind in a mind of separating you're separating this into this category separating that into that just like you're separating your life you try to separate your spiritual life from your carnal life and you're always schizophrenic you're always two people we know the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary one to another but I know that I bring that flesh under subjection because I know that that's not my identity this flesh doesn't identify me the word identifies me and if I believe that word that will follow me and show up in my life notice to be no mistakes his sinless nature expresses God's word and the only way that you'll ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you and you will have to have that sinless nature that comes from God that's my portion hallelu I got to believe the word and watch that word transform me into a sinless nature because it's what's in me that's going to produce the character I can't make it up I've got to believe it you see how what are you going to believe it he said so he said you had eternal life if you've got eternal life you've always had he said you were in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world he said that you now you got to identify with that you got to believe that oh but there's an accuser so I'm just going to drop down cuz this is where my my thought is now look to show its the ones this is paragraph 77 look to show it's the ones that he thought of to show it's the ones that he thought of he's talking about redeemed he comes to bring back the ones that he thought of he comes to bring back the ones that were with him in the beginning he come it's not a multiple choice he didn't hang on the cross and say whoever has pity on me and whoever has sympathy on me and whoever believes on me will be saved that is not salvation if you can do one thing for your salvation Jesus Christ died in vain the Salvation is not based upon your choice he already made that choice for you you were already with them all he forne he predestinated then he justified them then he cleansed them then he filled them with the spirit there's so there's so much confusion out there so many people trying to explain what the spirit is trying to explain what this is trying to explain that way do you want to know where all the answers to all the questions are it's in the word of God that God brought in this generation that's where your answers are yes and it's not by Secondhand Revelation right it's by faith in his word now he he he goes through this great labor to talk to you about you were in the thoughts of God you were a part of God you were in his thinking who did he come to redeem he came to redeem those that were in his thoughts and you keep looking at yourself in this time instead of looking at yourself in that time and he come me too this is what my my battle he said to show that it's the ones he thought of his thoughts is the Christian of today the thoughts before the foundation of the world now remember a man he was born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies is that right there is nothing in him at all so so so you see if he was in God's thoughts when he come into the world he's he comes in God's thoughts at the beginning to display his attributes do you follow me in other words you were born in sin shaped in iniquity right you come into the world speaking lies now if there wasn't something else above that remember he said that to to have someone save you would have to be a greater character that's right than that the one you've got a sinner can't save a sinner that's why they looked at him and say oh save yourself that's what saint's trying to get us to do save ourselves but there's got to be a greater power than the character that I possess no matter how I try to develop that character no matter what it's got to be a greater power than that which I possess so he says it's got to be something bigger it's got to be something greater where was it where is it how do I find it what's going to make it real to me to show you was was those that were in his thoughts we came into the world we spoke lies then Jesus came he said do you follow me then Jesus came to break the clouds back so that attribute could display itself that's it so what are we saved from We're saved from the LIE Hallelujah that's what we're saved from the LIE the lie that Satan told you the lie that says you're a sinner the lie that that of the your flesh warn against you that's what he's come to save us from he's come to save us from the lie that you're stuck with this nature you got you were born in sin shaped in iniquity what did he come to do he come to break that cloud back so you can see the attributes that you are the attribute so that you can see that you're in his thinking that's the trouble with the world today he God ordained a prophet to be the one that opened the seals and revealed the mystery of God and rolled back the cloud that you could see that's what we're saved from We're saved from the lie and we're still believing if we're not careful we start believing his lies he's the father of Lies there's no truth in him that's all he can do is lie and he's lied to us and lied to us lied to us about religion lied to us about the Trinity lied to us about the the what baptisms are lied to us about this lied to us about that and there's only one thing that sets us free and that's the truth the truth is what set us free that's what we're safe from We're Sav from the LIE now what am I going to identify with am I going to identify with what he said or how I feel am I going to look and say see my failures and I'm going to say well that's really what I am or can when I can I get to the place where I start standing back and saying wait a minute uhuh get behind me Satan I have the seed of God in Me I'm the thoughts of God and I'm here to manifest that thoughts of God that word's here to manifest itself in me that's what I am now I might be in this chain of this habit you got me in but once I can identify that that habit is a lie hallelujah hallelujah it's a cage it's a it it's a it it's a a a deception and that I can that I can rise way up above that and I'm more than that I like what he said here he says he come to redeem listen to this this is a if you can grab this you understand and and and identify with it not only is it identifying you're identifying yourself with it but it's identifying you this message came to identify you as the thoughts of God he says he is a redeemer he come to redeem is to pick up paragraph 60 that which has fallen to redeem back to to a place where it was at at the beginning so none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning so if I it don't matter if I'm down I got a power greater than me right that will pick me up and Redeem Me back to where I am so what do I have to do I've got to not I've got to be saved from the lie that put me there whether it's a complex whether it's what what you grew up under whether it's the complexes Satan put on you whether it's the trials that formed you none of that matters if he said I was in his thinking before the world and he came to redeem the thought am I'm that thought then I know that he will pick me up Hallelujah and what I need to be saved from is the LIE amen amen amen amen you brought it upon yourself you deserved it you made this decision true but I'm that prodal son in my father's house are many mansions I've got a place there see that's what he's come to save us from is the lie and he goes on to say he come to redeem not this Canon fodder that we see around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that was in God's thinking at the beginning this mother is just something that's mixed around to show the statue Church what are we going to identify with right it's just like it's like it's like all of a sudden you've got nothing like we talked about that man that with that blanket you remember the story I just told it that he was sitting watching his television and there and somebody held up a blanket and they looked at the blanket and the guy said this Blanket's worth 250,000 or I think the guy in the television said this blanket is worth 50 $60,000 at auction this guy turned around and there's a a blanket laying over the back of his couch that he's leaning against that his grandmother had given him and him and his wife grab it and they hold it up and they say these look the same and he tells the story he he had just lost a limb and he was broke and he didn't have nothing and he went and he took that blanket to auction and they started he didn't know what he had somebody had to come and roll P back the cloud now what if somebody said oh that's just an old cheap blanket my my aunt makes those all day long huh what if they would have believe that what everybody said but something rolled back his eyes yes so he took the blanket to auction and the blanket came up from auction and the first bid 50,000 and the minute that guy said 60,000 somebody offered 25,000 more 75,000 think of it then someone yelled out a 100,000 his wife were grabbing tears was running down their face the bids just kept going up and up now it was 700,000 800,000 $900,000 $1 million they're sitting there shaking they had it all the time but somebody had to roll back the cloud that the attribute might be put on display what did they have they had an original novel whole blanket woven by some famous with all the original dyes from the plants and flowers nothing fake about it 100% genuine original don't you understand there's nothing fake about you you're the genuine original thoughts of God sent here to be the Bride of God Hu it's the lie that you're something else it's the lie that you're a sinner it's a lie that you're a failure it's a lie that you'll never make it we got to be safe from the lie and it's the truth that set you free and this message is the truth it's not wrapped in Trinity confusion amen he said to redeem that was the thinking beginning this other is just something around in his P he says and if you are in the Lamb's Book of Life of God's expression from his thoughts he seen you and seen your desire before there even was an adom or anything else and you are his thoughts made word the expression in what you are now that's a mouthful but I look at myself do I see that you know why I don't see it I'm believing the lie but if I believe what he said then I'm his work word and he'll lift me up he's my redeemer to bring me back to where I was in the beginning the LI say you're the LI say you're here you're stuck you're a sinner but that's not what he said he said I was in his thoughts at the beginning I've already had eternal life so what am I looking for there's a greater power that's going to lift me up and bring me to what that he thought of me do you believe it he'll do it for you if is that your heart's desire that's why the word of God goes out it's trying to keep getting to you and cutting you till you get to the place I don't desire the world or the things of the world I desire life and life more abundant and when you identify with that the redeemer's there yes with a greater power than you have to bring you up and lift you up oh I love it it's not it's what you are now so you would understand that I'm trying to get here a reflection you've got to be identified amen he's trying to identify you he's rolling the cloud back he's diminishing the lie that Satan said about you about your nature about your personality all of it's a lie you say why do you why there's a blood there that paid that price that separated ated you from that marriage you had when you were born in sin shaped in iniquity and he's restoring us back and bringing us back and I like to read this last thing the musicians can come he came as Redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring it back bring it back it was God's thought you think little you little me no one in the world can take my place nobody can take your place you're being a Christian and filled with the spirit God became before the foundation of the world seen you and knew every feature that you got see and Jesus come to bring you back where did we get the idea that we already had to be there that's the lie you're always short you you've always got this problem you've always got that problem you've always got this failure oh you'll never make it wait a minute it's not what he said Hallelujah we say brother M you you're you're you you get a little hot tempered sometimes that may be true but guess what he's going to bring me he's going to redeem me from that he's going to bring me from that he's got a thought that was before the foundation of the world that's what he come for is to roll the cloud back so I don't have to believe the lie that makes me mad that makes me angry that makes me fear for my finances that makes me look after my own well-being that that let Satan put burdens on me that I I'm not even capable of carrying oh praise God that he's come to deliver me from the lie he's saving me from the LIE when you received eternal life there is only one form of eternal life that's the Greek word Zoey is that right brother brother says yes Zoe God's own life so you being a son you became part of that life so the life that's in you never did begin and it never can end when did you get it did you get it the day you got down that's part of the lie you kneel down and you say oh I give my life to Christ and you wake up and you've got the same nature but it's the seed that's in you that produces the nature and God Waters it by his word we keep putting ourselves under the challenge I've got to do this I've got to overcome this way wait a minute he's my Overcomer He's My Redeemer he's the one that's going to lift me up quit looking back leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling maybe you had your marriage is messed up maybe you're you've done sin in your life maybe you've went out and done things you can't undo but that don't stop God don't let the LIE continue to stop letting him bring you and redeem you and save you from the LIE oh he's a liar he says God's own life so you being a Son of God become part of that life so the life that's in you never did begin and it never could end think of it it can can't end because anything that's Eternal never began the life that's in you never did begin that is if you've got eternal life and that's God for you was in his thought from the Eternal and now it's expressed here in a human being for his glory Jesus came to redeem that being a son the fullness of God had to come and become that the the sinless character of God did that that he might redeem these other thoughts that was to come to him to make a wife what are you brother I'm the other thought amen I'm the other thoughts oh my goodness I'm a thought of God you might not believe it but I believe it you say well I don't see it well sit back and watch my redeemer will lift me up he'll transform me but I'm not going to believe the lie that says I can never get there when he said I could I'm not going to believe the lie I'm going to hell when I always had eternal life do you say oh well if you believe that you can sin and do er no if you're sinning it's unbelief it's because you don't believe that but if you did believe that and you've got a problem or you've got a habit or you've got a burden you know you've got a redeemer that'll lift you up and you can look up and say my Redeemer liveth though the skin worms eat my bones yet I'll see God it's like a slave he's he's being whipped on his back he's in slavery and he toils every day he's hardly ever fed and then one day he finds out he's the king he owns the the plantation they were lying to him saying that he was the slave when he was the [Music] owner you think he'd look down at the whoop marks and say oh I've got scars I'm must mean I'm a slave I've got all the scars from my past from all the years I was in bondage does that mean I'm a slave no I've come to realize I'm the king I'm the owner of this world I have power over every demon every Spirit you say I don't feel that way look up your Redemption draws I turn your eyes to him say I believe I'm Yours Lord quit listening to the guy that says you're not he said you were yes who do you believe I choose to believe God's Prophet messenger for the age I choose to believe what he said he got me to it so I could hear it and he didn't bring me to hear it so I could deny it but he brought me here to say that I could say Amen to every word of God God saved me from the LIE save me from the lie I'm telling myself I'm a king I'm a daughter son and daughter of God and no matter what this flesh this cursed flesh that was born in sin and shaped in iniquity it doesn't have any Hold On Me it's not what I identify with that's not what's going to rule my life I'm going to change my identity and I'm going to identify with my redeemer the one that can lift me above my flesh can lift me above my complexes the one that's got eternal life and he put that eternal life that the other thoughts when he said other thoughts I got out of my chair and said the other thought I'm that other thought I'm that other thought I'm the other thought oh I looked around and compared myself to everybody people that live better talk better act better I never could line up with them but one day I found my own identity I'm the other thought I may not be your thought but I'm the other thought amen I'm to be saved from the lie and the complex that he's put on me all my life and I'm going to believe what he said I'm a Believer and he'll lift me up you might say you got a long ways to go praise God he can go a long ways that's right you say well you're pretty bad shape well he went into the pits of hell that's where he found me oh FK don't identify with the world don't even identify with the lie don't identify with what you see in the mirror identify with his Eternal Word let's stand together this morning oh are you the other thoughts hallelujah amen isn't he wonderful just think of it we'll sing This Little Chorus just in your heart say I'm the thoughts of God he said it I have eternal life there's a lot of lies even my own flesh lies against me but I have a redeemer yes a power that's greater than me a character that's greater than me that will lift me up I'm here this morning Lord to put my hands up and say I identify with you I'm going to be lifted up into the character that you said that I would be I'm not going to believe what is said about me I'm not going to believe the accuser that's always pointing out my mistakes I'm going to believe what you said and you said that you come to roll back the shadow to roll back the darkness that I could see and be identified you unravel me with a [Music] Melo to round me with the song of deliver all my [Applause] enemies till all my are I'm no longer SL to [Music] fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave I am [Applause] God from eternity you have chosen me you [Music] identifi oh Hallelujah i' been born again to a family your life CL my I'm no longer as SL I am a child of God I'm no longer as slave I ever [Music] God you sp the sea so I could walk right through it my fears will drown in perfect love you rescued me and I will [Applause] stand I am child [Music] God you sp the [Music] seaf love you res me and I will [Music] stand I am a child of God amen I'd like to read one more statement to you cuz I I if there's someone here that is in doubt of who you are and what your heart's desire is and you think prayer would help you then we want to pray for you he said but he that is in you is Christ and if Christ is in you the works of Christ you will do if Christ lives in you he said so St John 14:12 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do [Music] also he didn't say the works that I do he is doing right now it says he shall do and if Christ is in you or if Christ lives in you then Christ is the word is that right and the word Come To His prophets see and if you Christ lived in you the works of Christ would be done through you and the life of Christ would be live through you The Works he did the life he lived and everything it would live in you just like Shakespeare or Beethoven or whatever it was lived in you if his life but if you're still living your own life then your own works you'll do but if you're living the life of Christ if Christ is in you he that's in you is greater than he that is in the world if your doubts and frustrations about God's promise is in you then Christ isn't there see you're only worked up but if the Life of Christ is living in you his word will recognize and his promise us he'll do it so he'll do it it doesn't mean that you're not a Christian do you understand what he says if you're all frustrated about the promise of God if you're if if if you're if your if if if your doubts and frustrations about God's promise is in you then it isn't Christ there doesn't say you're not a Christian he said if that frustration is there and that Doubt's there then that's not Christ that's not him and if you can say that that's not him if you if you if you're worried about your healing or whether you're going to get healed or whether you're forgiven and you have all that doubt and frustration that's not him and that's when you've got to say wait a minute that's not him I'm not going to accept that he that is in me is greater than my doubt and my frustration and this morning if you're living below your privilege he says when thou prayest believe that you receive what you ask for and it shall be given you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but leave that what you say will come to pass you can have what you say the father worketh and I worketh hither too verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing himself only what he sees the father doing and and doth the son likewise and when the father showed him what to do he walked out there without a failure of anything and said let it be and it was and the same Christ lives in you it lives in us then his Works will do because Christ is the word the promise of the word brings healing to you do you believe that it's the promise of the word that brings to Healing it's acting on the the promise is coming up and saying I've got doubt and confusion Lord I Want to Be Free I've got sickness I'm going to act on the promise it's what brings healing he said I will not leave you comfortless as I pray asked a while ago there in Matthew 24 Matthew 282 see he says I will come to you and be in you I the person of Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost will come and live in you then you won't be you won't be yourself anymore I'll be in you and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world see Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever if you if you have a need this morning we'd be happy to pray for you there not any power I have but it's what he said and if you need something from the Lord this morning and you'd like to come if there's a lie that he's told on you and I thought of that woman he looking at her and all of a sudden he stops and he says it's a lie it's a lie amen I don't want to believe the lie I want to be saved from the LIE amen could you play that song There is a blood [Music] there is a blood that cost the life that paid
