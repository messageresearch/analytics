[37:42] prayer gracious Heavenly
[37:45] Father truly Lord you are the great
[37:47] emancipator Lord
[37:49] [Music]
[37:50] Jesus for we can look back at a time
[37:52] when we were bound
[37:54] Lord and that trumpet sounded and said
[37:56] you could go free Lord
[37:59] Jesus and father that's what you did for
[38:01] us Lord You've set us free from the
[38:04] things of this world you set us free
[38:06] from the trials Lord you set us free
[38:08] from the heartache Lord you set us free
[38:11] from all these things Lord
[38:13] Jesus father you didn't spare us from it
[38:16] cuz it still happens Lord Jesus but the
[38:18] freedom in which you gave us is that we
[38:19] have an assurance regardless of it they
[38:21] come or not we know in whom we believe
[38:24] in he is more than able to give the
[38:26] answer Lord Jesus
[38:28] father bless your people who've made the
[38:29] sacrifice to come out tonight once more
[38:32] Lord to hear something from you Lord
[38:34] Jesus they didn't come to hear from me
[38:36] I've got nothing to tell them Lord Jesus
[38:39] but if you could but help me Lord to
[38:40] just put myself aside Lord that you
[38:43] might speak to the individual Lord Jesus
[38:45] tell them something that may be a help
[38:47] to them Lord Jesus that's my prayer
[38:50] father anoint my lips Lord I ask this in
[38:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:56] amen thank you
[39:03] musicians let's open our Bibles to
[39:05] Matthew
[39:12] 16 verse
[39:18] 24 before I forget uh brother Manas told
[39:21] me to greet you all in the name of the
[39:23] Lord Jesus
[39:26] Christ
[39:37] it reads verse 24 of Matthew
[39:40] 16 then said Jesus unto his disciples If
[39:44] any man will come after me let him deny
[39:47] himself and take up his cross and follow
[39:50] me for whosoever will save his life
[39:53] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[39:56] his life for my sake
[39:57] shall find it for what is a man profited
[40:01] if he shall gain the whole world and
[40:03] lose his own soul or what shall a man
[40:05] give in exchange for his soul let's turn
[40:09] again quickly to Romans chapter
[40:23] 8 starting in verse one there is there
[40:27] therefore now no condemnation to them
[40:29] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[40:32] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[40:35] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[40:37] Jesus had made me free from the law of
[40:41] sin and death for what the law could not
[40:44] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[40:46] God sending his own son in likeness of
[40:49] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[40:52] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[40:54] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[40:57] walk walk not after the flesh but after
[40:59] the spirit for they that are after The
[41:02] Flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[41:04] but they that are after the spirit the
[41:07] things of the spirit for to be carnally
[41:09] minded is death but to be spiritually
[41:12] minded is life and peace because the
[41:14] carnal mind is enmity with God for it is
[41:18] not subject to the law of God neither
[41:20] indeed can be so then they that are in
[41:23] the flesh cannot please God I want I
[41:26] want us to really pay attention to that
[41:29] verse so then they that are in the flesh
[41:32] cannot please God but ye are not in the
[41:35] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[41:39] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[41:42] any man have have not the spirit of
[41:44] Christ he is none of his and if Christ
[41:47] be in you the body is dead because of
[41:50] sin but the spirit is life because of
[41:52] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[41:55] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[41:56] dwelleth in you he that raiseth Christ
[41:59] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[42:01] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[42:04] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[42:06] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[42:09] after the flesh for if you live after
[42:11] the flesh ye shall die but if ye through
[42:13] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[42:16] body ye shall live gracious Heavenly
[42:19] Father we ask a blessing on the reading
[42:21] of your
[42:22] word amen you may be
[42:26] seated
[42:42] so uh a a while back ago a thought had
[42:47] entered into my mind listening to
[42:50] brother Brandon preaching teaching on
[42:53] Moses
[42:55] and it's it's it's it's amazing how it
[42:58] ties into what Brother David was
[43:00] preaching on this morning about that
[43:02] seed coming to that maturity of you
[43:06] being known as you were known right and
[43:08] it's it's really important to realize
[43:11] something something Brother David said
[43:12] this morning that really sank in you
[43:14] know God's a god of variety right he's
[43:16] made you one way he's made me one way
[43:19] we're all different we may we may some
[43:21] may come from Africa some may come from
[43:23] here and so forth but in essence each
[43:26] individual person is is not like
[43:27] somebody else so God wants to see his
[43:30] life in you in the manner in which he's
[43:32] made you right not mimicking who's to
[43:35] the right or to the left of you but
[43:37] being Christ in your life in the walk
[43:39] he's given you yes sir right so we we
[43:42] find out in this day and age at times
[43:44] that the thought that came to mind was
[43:46] save it lose it lose it save it because
[43:49] brother Brandon would describe a
[43:50] situation he'd get into the well I guess
[43:52] you could say drama of of what happened
[43:55] in the time of Moses right when you read
[43:57] your Bible there's not much detail in
[43:59] the beginnings of the life of Moses but
[44:01] brother Brandon would say he he used
[44:03] examples from a brother he knew and then
[44:05] his historian books and so forth to kind
[44:08] of paint a picture to help the the the
[44:10] people that were listening brother B
[44:12] would describe it as such he'd say that
[44:14] Moses was a Moses was a while he was a
[44:17] baby and was
[44:18] born amram was coming in and he was
[44:21] weary from work like oh man Yosh you
[44:24] don't understand what's going on at work
[44:26] that man got I'm hearing this I'm
[44:28] hearing that they're whipping kids
[44:30] they're putting ropes around their neck
[44:33] they're choking the life out of them and
[44:34] man it's it's it's terrible and he's
[44:36] coming home and he feels defeated and
[44:39] he's like man like we've been crying and
[44:40] sighing and praying but is is God going
[44:43] to help us out of this
[44:44] situation right and Y better said no
[44:46] Abraham You' just got to pray you just
[44:48] got to keep praying because that's how
[44:49] we were made we just put get on our
[44:51] knees and we pray and the Lord comes to
[44:53] our Aid so he went and he prayed but
[44:55] would dramatized that he would get up
[44:57] there and he would pray and pray time
[44:59] and time and time again till the angel
[45:00] met him and said amram I'm here to give
[45:03] you a message there will be a deliverer
[45:06] born amongst you right and in this time
[45:09] the Pharaoh he was having a problem
[45:11] there was too much Israelites in that
[45:14] day and in his mind he was thinking if
[45:15] they unite under one Authority they'll
[45:19] be able to overpower us right there was
[45:21] more with them than there was that were
[45:24] putting them in bondage yet they didn't
[45:26] realize I how much they were in number
[45:29] to do anything about the situation that
[45:31] they were in right often times sometimes
[45:33] that's us right we we think because we
[45:36] live in this world there's everywhere
[45:37] you look to the left and to the right of
[45:38] you there's chaos everywhere you think
[45:41] you're surrounded you think you're the
[45:42] minority when in reality greater is he
[45:45] that is with you than he that's in the
[45:46] world there's more with you than there
[45:48] is against you right so it's just
[45:49] looking at the right lens of
[45:51] things in this day and age that we live
[45:54] in we have a lot of people that try
[45:56] their best effort to work out their own
[45:58] salvation right you you hear that
[46:00] there's this I would like I would say uh
[46:04] immature mindset I I had it myself where
[46:06] it's like you know this Christian Life
[46:08] is Like an egg you give to a child and
[46:10] you say keep it for a week right you
[46:12] imagine giving a precious egg to a
[46:14] 2-year-old and saying don't crack it
[46:16] don't drop it don't let no harm come to
[46:19] it and bring it back to me after a week
[46:22] now who has the kid that's going to keep
[46:23] that
[46:25] egg if you if you thrw a kids like I was
[46:28] I'm throwing it as far as I can throw
[46:30] it there's no point of keeping it it's
[46:32] to a kid he can't quite comprehend what
[46:34] it's like to hold something precious
[46:37] like that that's like you in your life
[46:39] why would God trust you with your own
[46:41] salvation you you couldn't keep it right
[46:45] you couldn't protect it you couldn't
[46:47] help it you couldn't redeem your own
[46:49] life so he had to put it in the hands of
[46:51] somebody that could so he put in the
[46:53] hands of the one that made
[46:55] you
[46:58] brother Brandon would would speak as
[46:59] I've been listening to the series of the
[47:01] book of the book of Hebrews brother
[47:04] Brandon is really taking his time to try
[47:06] to get the people to an understanding of
[47:08] something and he man if you ever get the
[47:11] chance to dive into that series because
[47:13] it's really been a blessing to me
[47:15] brother Brandon would would describe the
[47:17] situation that men find themselves in at
[47:20] times he would say in Hebrews chapter
[47:22] 6 number
[47:24] two uh paragraph 366
[47:28] so with the spirit in there which is
[47:29] promised I give unto him everlasting
[47:32] life and they shall never perish did he
[47:35] lie or did he tell the truth he told the
[47:38] truth so you see how this interprets the
[47:41] impossibility is for a man to fall after
[47:45] he's once in Grace he can't he can fall
[47:49] sure but not back to
[47:51] repentance right and we sometimes have
[47:53] this idea right we brother brother David
[47:57] has been preaching about the law of the
[47:58] seed right but we we really have to
[48:00] understand in order for us to get to
[48:02] that place of maturity that that's been
[48:05] the picture's been painted perfectly for
[48:07] us in order to get there we have to deal
[48:09] with this side of us that constantly
[48:12] questions God the side of us that
[48:14] constantly questions if we've made it
[48:16] that constantly questions our Salvation
[48:18] that constantly questions how perfect we
[48:20] are you can't work on these things as
[48:23] long as you're in this question side
[48:25] brother Brandon would say in the Ser of
[48:27] Hebrews he would speak and talk about
[48:29] Paul writing the letters to the churches
[48:31] and so forth and he said he had his
[48:33] greatest trouble with the Pentecostal
[48:34] church right he said because they always
[48:36] had to feel something they always had to
[48:38] see something they always had they
[48:40] needed some type of sensation he
[48:42] couldn't preach to them predestination
[48:44] and for and for know an election he
[48:46] couldn't preach to them those things
[48:48] right and I I wonder for us sometimes if
[48:50] if we've got the if what we're looking
[48:52] for is trying to feel like a Christian
[48:54] like you know you know I go to church I
[48:57] get I get excited when I'm in church
[48:59] because I've done this cuz I've done
[49:00] that well that means I'm a Christian
[49:02] it's beyond that it's a it's a
[49:04] revelation that regardless of how you
[49:05] feel there's an assurance that something
[49:08] took place in my heart something took
[49:10] place in my life the desire is not the
[49:12] same I've
[49:14] changed when once you get that well now
[49:17] you've started something but if it's
[49:19] just a sensation if it's just an emotion
[49:21] if it's just something that will fade
[49:23] but you need something real and and
[49:25] brother benam would take his time into
[49:27] that and he said all I can give them is
[49:30] is milk because that's where they're at
[49:32] I can't give them this this hard food I
[49:34] can't give them this mature food so I
[49:37] wonder sometimes for us if we get in
[49:39] that trap sometimes we we may not
[49:40] necessarily be looking for a sensation
[49:43] you're not looking for a dance for a
[49:44] shout and so forth but I wonder if every
[49:47] time you fall or a mistake happens you
[49:50] get back and you question what it is
[49:51] God's done in your life and you say well
[49:53] was the blood enough did it did it
[49:55] really cover everything
[49:57] that it's it's not that the blood
[49:59] covered everything and you'd never make
[50:00] no wrong again it's that the blood
[50:02] covered everything even the ones you
[50:04] would make regardless of how bad you
[50:07] think they are the blood's
[50:09] sufficient you denying what Christ did
[50:11] at Calvary it's hard for you to go
[50:13] anywhere further in Christ's economy so
[50:15] long as you keep denying the power in
[50:18] which he bestowed upon you through his
[50:20] blood right and I I I I I begin to I
[50:23] begin to think about this and and I
[50:25] realize a lot of times that's
[50:27] that's that's young people you know some
[50:29] of some of you older ones not that
[50:30] you're that old but you might be but
[50:32] some of you older ones may maybe going
[50:34] to the same thing and you're not spared
[50:36] from this idea that man I I I thought I
[50:41] was saved and then you know I I done
[50:42] wrong and now I got to restart I got to
[50:44] go back to beginning and and I got to
[50:47] re-baptize and I got to redo this I got
[50:49] to redo that and so forth that's that's
[50:52] not the kind of mature life Christ is
[50:54] looking for he doesn't he doesn't want
[50:57] kids that aren't firm on anything that
[51:00] they're constantly shaking constantly
[51:02] moving you need to know where you stand
[51:04] according to the word brother Brandon
[51:06] would say is it's the way you you you
[51:08] see yourself through the word that's who
[51:10] you are it's not what you see through
[51:12] your flesh see we read in the scriptures
[51:15] here
[51:16] that there is no condemnation to them
[51:19] that are in Christ Jesus so if you're in
[51:22] Christ Jesus then you're you're out of
[51:25] the desires of this flesh
[51:27] you're you're no longer a part of the
[51:28] things that goes that this flesh wants
[51:30] to do you don't have that desire you
[51:33] don't you don't want to do those things
[51:35] right you're in Christ but I I wonder if
[51:39] sometimes we try to find our Perfection
[51:41] through the flesh which is why every
[51:43] time something happens you go back and
[51:45] say oh woe is me look what I've done
[51:47] I've done this I've done that get past
[51:51] that Christ did a finished work there's
[51:54] there's there's there's no repeat Hees
[51:56] doesn't have to go and die again for you
[51:58] no when he died the first time that was
[52:00] enough that was it he completely
[52:03] redeemed you so all the complexes and
[52:05] ideas that you might have of of of your
[52:08] trials of of where you see yourself of
[52:10] your shortcomings how where you fall put
[52:12] those aside they're they're not
[52:14] attributed to you in fact when Christ
[52:17] looks at you all he sees is his blood so
[52:20] it doesn't matter if you if you sinned
[52:22] 10 minutes ago if that blood was there
[52:25] for you if your name was there before
[52:27] the foundation of the world what you
[52:29] just did 10 minutes ago has got nothing
[52:31] to do with that blood it doesn't even
[52:34] exist right all he's asking for you to
[52:37] do is when you've done wrong recognize
[52:39] the wrong ask for forgiveness and
[52:42] continue on don't dwell there there's
[52:44] there there's this idea sometimes that
[52:46] we get that oh if if we sin you the
[52:49] devil gets in your ear and says well you
[52:50] know what don't pray cuz you know God's
[52:53] not going to hear you you've done wrong
[52:54] well you know oh I've I've I've made a
[52:56] mistake and there's no point of reading
[52:58] your Bible what are you going to read it
[52:59] for oh don't put on the table and do it
[53:00] for but I I'm sorry Christ died for
[53:03] Sinners he died for bad people that
[53:05] weren't good if there was righteousness
[53:08] found in you there'd be no need for him
[53:09] to die but you were nothing you were
[53:12] filthy you needed him in every facet of
[53:15] your life we were hungering for
[53:18] life so Christ come now and he's given
[53:22] you that life right and now he's asking
[53:25] you to walk in the
[53:28] Life brother brand brother Brandon would
[53:30] say it's goingon to go to go through
[53:33] some some quotes here that really really
[53:35] hit home for me in the it's going to
[53:37] we're going to be in this series of
[53:40] Hebrews let's go
[53:42] to give me one
[53:54] second brother Brandon would say so in
[54:04] paragraph one second
[54:10] here yes he
[54:12] says paragraph 444 and that's the way in
[54:16] Hebrews chapter 6 number two and that's
[54:18] the way this doesn't say that it's
[54:20] impossible for a man to ever get back
[54:23] then when he backslide it doesn't say
[54:25] that it doesn't say that it says it's
[54:27] impossible for a man to ever come back
[54:29] to renew himself after he's once been
[54:33] there he cannot do it the Bible said he
[54:36] that's born of God does not commit sin
[54:39] for he I die when death has been paid
[54:41] for how can I die when I got eternal
[54:43] life how can I do it you can't do it how
[54:47] can I have a written permit from the
[54:48] mayor for this city to run 60 M an hour
[54:51] through this city and any officer
[54:53] arresting me for any for running 60 M an
[54:55] hour how can can you do it I've got a
[54:57] permit from the mayor that says I can do
[54:59] it he can arrest me his arrest he would
[55:02] blow the whistle and everything else and
[55:04] I could just ignore it don't mean a
[55:06] thing I've got a permit and how can I
[55:09] then as after Christ has died for me and
[55:12] I become his righteousness become of his
[55:15] grace and love to me how can I sin when
[55:18] there is something laying there between
[55:20] me in God a sacrifice I can't sin can't
[55:24] do it God never sees me he sees Christ
[55:27] he stands in my place and when I do
[55:29] anything wrong Christ takes my place I
[55:32] made my confession I'm wrong he's right
[55:35] Lord you know my heart you know whether
[55:37] I mean it or not and I'm wrong forgive
[55:40] me God never sees it the blood of Jesus
[55:43] got me covered all the time then how can
[55:45] God ever see me how can sin be counted
[55:48] to me when he can't do it just as soon
[55:52] as I do it it's forgiven that's right
[55:54] just like taking a little droper like
[55:56] this eye dropper and take a full black
[55:58] ink and hold it up over a tub of bleach
[56:00] and just drop it in there and then try
[56:02] to find it again it just turns to the
[56:04] bleach the ink becomes bleach and that's
[56:07] what you confess sins if you're in
[56:08] Christ between you and God is a whole
[56:11] tub of bleach and your sin becomes
[56:14] righteous because a righteous sacrifice
[56:16] is waiting there for
[56:18] you how can you
[56:21] stumble either like brother B was said
[56:24] in the earlier quote either he Li lied
[56:26] or he told the
[56:28] truth where where do we now have the
[56:31] disconnect at where are we having the
[56:33] trouble at do we believe what he said or
[56:36] do we not believe what he said God
[56:38] called me to be a believer I don't have
[56:41] to understand it I promise you I don't
[56:44] understand it but I believe it
[56:46] wholeheartedly and it's because I
[56:48] believe it he brings that belief into
[56:50] manifestation into a life you seen the
[56:53] life is only proof of the belief if I I
[56:56] didn't believe it you there' be no life
[56:57] for you to
[56:59] see he would said when I come to the
[57:01] river at the ending of day and the last
[57:02] winds of Sorrow have blown there is one
[57:04] thought that cheers me and makes my
[57:05] heart glad I won't have to Cross Jordan
[57:08] Alone that's one good thing that's one
[57:10] good thing I won't have to cross it one
[57:12] of these days we coming down to the end
[57:14] of the road the sun will refuse to shine
[57:16] then God will call Adam will reach over
[57:18] and Shake Eve and say honey here it is
[57:20] it's time to wake up eveil reach over
[57:22] and get a hold of Abel say come forth
[57:24] darling it's time to wake up Abel will
[57:26] get a hold of Seth and Seth will get a
[57:28] hold of Noah Noah will get a hold on
[57:30] down to Abraham and down as they come
[57:32] there will be a great shaking and
[57:33] Awakening when the Son of God comes will
[57:35] stand in his likeness at that day now if
[57:38] you commit sin here you're going to pay
[57:40] for it and brother bam goes into a story
[57:43] here of a man that a man that was
[57:47] sealed he he had the Holy Ghost he was a
[57:50] genuine
[57:51] believer but he went away it didn't it
[57:55] didn't do away with what God had done
[57:57] for him because he was genuinely called
[58:00] God called him home said I can't let you
[58:02] mess this up see I I want you to
[58:05] understand just how rigged this case is
[58:07] for you you can't mess it up with your
[58:10] best effort you couldn't do it you could
[58:13] be knocking at the doors of hell open up
[58:15] Satan I'm here for a room you can't stay
[58:19] wherever you go as long as his name's
[58:21] with you you can't never mess this up
[58:25] see our problem is we here's this little
[58:27] life you know Ben Ben's been trying to
[58:29] live right since 2019 and so forth and
[58:31] Ben's Fallen oh I got to get another
[58:34] egg Ben's been living right since
[58:38] 201901 oh fall I got get another one and
[58:41] you it's not a cycle it's not a
[58:43] repetition of you continuing to fold and
[58:44] restarting and restarting and restarting
[58:47] no you come into that place where one of
[58:49] these days you'll drop it and you'll
[58:51] realize hold on this isn't in my hands
[58:54] you say Lord I don't want to pick that
[58:56] up you're the one that's in control of
[58:58] it not me let me just surrender it all
[59:01] and say Lord you take it you're in
[59:02] charge of taking the seed from this
[59:04] destination to the other destination
[59:06] it's got nothing to do with
[59:09] me right and and this this this thought
[59:11] had came into my mind and of this race
[59:14] called life everyone starting at a
[59:17] different
[59:19] point some some in a believing household
[59:22] some not in believing household but
[59:24] regardless of where you started the race
[59:26] began right but this is the only race
[59:28] that first place doesn't matter this is
[59:32] the race where finishing matters it's
[59:35] not about how when you get there how
[59:38] long it took you and so no getting there
[59:40] is what matters right and it's it's
[59:43] amazing because you're not in charge of
[59:45] doing it see you you realize that you
[59:47] started this race you said you know what
[59:49] how do I finish this race fast you know
[59:51] what I let me I know what to do let me
[59:54] go where the fire is at I'll get where
[59:56] the fire's at and then I'll get excited
[59:58] like everybody that's got the fire and
[1:00:00] then that'll mean that I've made it and
[1:00:02] you realize no that's that's that's not
[1:00:04] it that's not oh no no no maybe that's
[1:00:06] wrong let me go where the good singing
[1:00:08] is at I'm going to find those singers
[1:00:10] the ones that can really hit those keys
[1:00:12] and then I'm going to sing with them and
[1:00:13] learn to sing and then oh now I've made
[1:00:15] it no it's got nothing to do with that
[1:00:18] everything to do with do you have the
[1:00:19] Revelation that what Christ has done for
[1:00:22] you is a finished work if you receive
[1:00:24] that revelation then you have him in you
[1:00:27] and if he's in you how can you
[1:00:30] fail it's impossible to fail it doesn't
[1:00:33] matter where you're at a lot of the a
[1:00:35] lot of the young people especially you
[1:00:37] you you get this this idea this it's
[1:00:41] it's I don't want to
[1:00:42] say I'm trying to find the right word
[1:00:44] for it but you you get this idea that
[1:00:47] you're in charge of your salvation that
[1:00:50] it's it's something that you do that's
[1:00:53] going to Grant you eternal life
[1:00:55] something that you Merit because of your
[1:00:58] work or your deeds and so forth it's got
[1:01:01] nothing to do with
[1:01:04] you I sometimes I say man if Ben could
[1:01:08] just die enough that when I wake up in
[1:01:10] the morning I don't even think my name
[1:01:13] but I think Christ nothing else but him
[1:01:16] if if I could just get there to that
[1:01:18] place that I keep him on my lips at
[1:01:21] every moment in everything that I do
[1:01:24] that it's him that's seen it's him him
[1:01:26] that's
[1:01:27] speaking I would be content with that my
[1:01:30] problem is I'm in this flesh you're in
[1:01:32] this flesh but we have to learn to go in
[1:01:36] this flesh get out of the Flesh and in
[1:01:39] the spirit dwell in the
[1:01:42] spirit you can't perfect yourself in
[1:01:45] your Works brother bam would describe in
[1:01:47] the series of of Hebrews he was talk
[1:01:49] about laying on of hands praying for the
[1:01:53] sick doing this and doing that he said
[1:01:55] it's all dead works it's something
[1:01:57] you're doing you go and you lay on hands
[1:02:00] you baptize you do this all those things
[1:02:04] you you're supposed to do them great if
[1:02:06] you do great if you don't what's
[1:02:08] important is you receiving Christ you
[1:02:11] can't enter into a rest until you've
[1:02:14] received
[1:02:17] Christ brother brandham would say let me
[1:02:20] find it real
[1:02:24] quick
[1:02:41] says it depends on in paragraph Hebrews
[1:02:44] chapter 6 number two paragraph
[1:02:47] 355 let's start in
[1:02:49] 354 what does the Perfection do it's the
[1:02:52] wheat the wheat is God's word he uses it
[1:02:57] as his word it's his seed it brings
[1:03:00] forth it depends on what seed is sown in
[1:03:03] your heart if you come to church just
[1:03:06] because you're afraid of hell if you
[1:03:08] join church because you don't want to go
[1:03:09] to hell you're still a Cocker if you
[1:03:12] join church just to be popular you're
[1:03:14] still a Cocker if you done all these
[1:03:17] formal things that's to be done and
[1:03:19] that's all you got you're still a Cocker
[1:03:22] birg notice he said and that's all you
[1:03:24] got see there's nothing wrong with it so
[1:03:28] long as there's more if that's where
[1:03:31] you're resting you haven't made it yet
[1:03:34] he
[1:03:35] says excuse me but a real genuine
[1:03:38] Christian presses towards Perfection
[1:03:41] until the world is dead and you become a
[1:03:45] new creature in Christ Jesus then it's
[1:03:48] possible for that man then it's
[1:03:50] impossible for that man to ever fail
[1:03:54] what the Bible said see how he Compares
[1:03:57] with the rest of the scripture see how
[1:03:59] it lays right there in its place how can
[1:04:02] it say here a man that's once saved can
[1:04:05] never be lost and come over here and say
[1:04:07] but if you are lost or blasphemed it's
[1:04:10] impossible sure if you're a blasphemer
[1:04:12] you're not a Christian no man speaking
[1:04:14] by the spirit of God call it the cursed
[1:04:16] St John 4 or 1 John 4 no man speaking by
[1:04:19] the spirit of Christ calls Jesus a
[1:04:21] cursed every spirit of God that's in
[1:04:23] Christian Church agrees with with
[1:04:26] everything God
[1:04:27] said we read here and say he was wounded
[1:04:30] for our transgressions with this trap
[1:04:32] we're healed the old Cardinal mind say
[1:04:34] days of Miracles has passed I'm Dr Jones
[1:04:36] see there's no such thing as Divine
[1:04:38] Healing no such thing as heartfelt
[1:04:39] religion you're just a bunch of work up
[1:04:41] your emotional seed that's all there is
[1:04:43] to it there's nothing to it we are
[1:04:45] Presbyterians we're lutherans or
[1:04:46] whatever it is we know where we're
[1:04:48] standing but what does the spirit of God
[1:04:50] say Jesus Christ the same here amen says
[1:04:53] the spirit of God it agrees quickly with
[1:04:57] the word yes sir it's right there see
[1:04:59] what I mean these carnal forms Works
[1:05:02] death said Paul but where life is come
[1:05:06] this Perfection he that heareth my words
[1:05:09] believeth on him that sent me hey has
[1:05:11] everlasting life and shall never come to
[1:05:14] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:05:16] unto life I'll give him everlasting life
[1:05:19] raise him up the last days all the
[1:05:22] father have given me will come unto me
[1:05:24] none of them is lost can't
[1:05:27] be
[1:05:29] see as we reading you're seeing this is
[1:05:32] Christ describing what he's doing I'm
[1:05:35] not seeing your part in this I don't see
[1:05:38] where no you you got to be the one to
[1:05:41] you you choose a church you write your
[1:05:42] name on the letter of the church and say
[1:05:43] I belong to this church I belong to that
[1:05:45] and so forth no it's dwelling in Christ
[1:05:48] finding your rest
[1:05:51] there in the scripture we read it says
[1:05:54] for they are after after the flesh do
[1:05:57] mind the things of the flesh how how can
[1:06:00] we say we're of the spirit but we still
[1:06:03] mind the things of the
[1:06:05] flesh it's it's real hard A House
[1:06:07] Divided can't stand you can't serve two
[1:06:10] masters you got to pick one so either
[1:06:13] you're going to believe and and dwell in
[1:06:14] the flesh or you'll dwell in The Spirit
[1:06:17] Well if you dwell in the spirit that
[1:06:18] means you have to deny the flesh deny
[1:06:20] yourself deny your thoughts deny
[1:06:23] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:06:25] God put it aside and accept only those
[1:06:28] things which are of Christ that's where
[1:06:31] God's trying to take us but it's real
[1:06:33] hard for us to walk in our maturity for
[1:06:35] us to walk in Perfection so long as
[1:06:38] every small mistake that happens every
[1:06:40] small hiccup that takes place in life we
[1:06:42] we feel the need that we've got to now
[1:06:44] re restart again do Penance again and so
[1:06:47] forth and whatnot this this we're not
[1:06:50] babies we are mature people right a a
[1:06:54] baby when he's born and he falls and he
[1:06:56] cries you got to shake him arm and say
[1:06:58] no get up it's okay it's okay to fall
[1:07:00] get up try again but you as an adult
[1:07:02] when you fall you laugh you get up and
[1:07:04] you keep
[1:07:05] going that's how it should be in our
[1:07:08] spiritual life when we fall you said
[1:07:11] that that's not me I I'm not this sin I
[1:07:16] I'm I'm not this person that I'm seeing
[1:07:17] in the mirror this this isn't me the me
[1:07:20] that I know is perfection in Christ
[1:07:24] that's the me that I I know not not not
[1:07:26] this me that makes mistakes not this me
[1:07:29] that falls no Christ you said that I
[1:07:31] would be perfect sinless spotless
[1:07:34] without wrinkle if that's what he said
[1:07:37] Do you believe it or do you not did he
[1:07:41] tell the truth or did he lie right work
[1:07:44] work it out only after you've done that
[1:07:48] that you can now say you know I'm
[1:07:49] walking towards Perfection and brother
[1:07:51] Brandon would say I think towards the
[1:07:52] end of this sermon he would speak and
[1:07:54] talk about now we're entering into
[1:07:57] Perfection and he would say that the
[1:07:59] Perfection we're entering into if the
[1:08:01] doctor said oh you've got this sickness
[1:08:03] and so forth you pay him no mind and you
[1:08:06] keep going you keep going oh the Devil
[1:08:08] comes in your ear and says hey man you
[1:08:10] you you fell yesterday it's under the
[1:08:12] blood you keep going whatever happens to
[1:08:14] it's under the blood you keep going but
[1:08:17] so long as you keep dwelling on the
[1:08:18] mistaken it it's funny you you'll spend
[1:08:21] weeks on weeks on weeks dwelling on a
[1:08:23] mistake you made and Christ is like I
[1:08:25] want to bring you up higher than this I
[1:08:27] want to get you past this and and you
[1:08:29] dwell on it for so long it eats away at
[1:08:32] you like you have to feel remorse for
[1:08:37] it's it's funny how the mind works
[1:08:38] because you make a mistake you got to
[1:08:39] feel remorse for a long time for it to
[1:08:42] count as you really being sorry for it
[1:08:44] no what does the word
[1:08:47] say say what the word says and move on
[1:08:50] you don't have to dwell there for two
[1:08:52] weeks and say okay two weeks is a long
[1:08:53] time to dwell on this sin I think God
[1:08:55] forgave me now no that's not how that
[1:08:57] works the blood covered it the blood
[1:09:01] took care of it so we're moving on to a
[1:09:03] Perfection but we we can't get there if
[1:09:06] we're still back here we need to get
[1:09:09] into Christ and when you're in Christ
[1:09:11] it's not you living it's Christ doing
[1:09:14] the living for you but how can he live
[1:09:18] for you if you don't feed on his word
[1:09:20] because Christ is his
[1:09:23] word brother Brandon would say
[1:09:27] he's given he gives an example
[1:09:29] of 371 look at Elvis Presley in 1947
[1:09:33] version of judias SC scariot joins
[1:09:35] Assemblies of God Pentecostal speaking
[1:09:36] in tongues for the Holy Ghost and set
[1:09:38] more souls to torment than all the
[1:09:40] bootleg joints there's been in the last
[1:09:41] 50 years perverted the mind of little
[1:09:43] teenage children all over the world till
[1:09:45] little girls would grab off their
[1:09:47] underclothes and throw it on the
[1:09:48] platform and him to autograph so vulgar
[1:09:51] that they won't show him in television
[1:09:53] from his waist down the way his body the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost speaking in tongues for
[1:09:56] evidence oh brother if the Holy Ghost
[1:09:59] was there it wouldn't act like that you
[1:10:00] know better than that certainly not God
[1:10:02] loves cleanness and Purity and holy I
[1:10:06] don't act clean and pure and holy to
[1:10:08] make myself a Christian but Christ in me
[1:10:11] lives that in me and I love him and if I
[1:10:14] do anything wrong it condemns me right
[1:10:17] there I'll say God forgive me every day
[1:10:19] I got to ask for forgiveness every day
[1:10:22] and you do too certainly you do but now
[1:10:25] if if you're carnal you just wait on
[1:10:27] back and say oh well that's all right I
[1:10:28] belong to church see then when you
[1:10:30] blaspheme is when you don't have the
[1:10:32] faith that was that was once delivered
[1:10:35] to the Saints then you make fun of that
[1:10:37] and call it an evil spirit so that's a
[1:10:39] bunch of holy roles then you separate
[1:10:40] yourself between grace and judgment then
[1:10:42] you're finished forever Jesus said one
[1:10:45] word against it will never be forgiven
[1:10:47] in this world or the world to come and
[1:10:49] the Christian born of the spirit can't
[1:10:51] say evil about that because it can't it
[1:10:53] agrees with it that's right that's the
[1:10:55] reason people try to tell me that Pillar
[1:10:58] of Fire there that appears with us they
[1:11:00] try to say that was the devil that it
[1:11:02] was just fiction all this but the camera
[1:11:05] proved that it wasn't and The Works lay
[1:11:07] right exactly on the Bible same Pillar
[1:11:10] of Fire that met Paul has wrote to
[1:11:12] Damascus all these things that he done
[1:11:14] back there is doing it just exactly the
[1:11:17] same way by the Bible it's Christ the
[1:11:20] son of God and when we are born again we
[1:11:23] have everlasting life and and cannot
[1:11:26] perish it would be impossible for man to
[1:11:29] fall that's what the Bible said time and
[1:11:33] time again you brother brandom in this
[1:11:35] sermon is speaking of how impossible it
[1:11:37] is for somebody who's been saved to fall
[1:11:41] back fall off from Grace it's imp he's
[1:11:45] speaking to you not not those that that
[1:11:48] receive God in the mind no but you
[1:11:50] that's received them in your heart he
[1:11:52] wants you to get past you
[1:11:56] so long as you're here you always have
[1:11:59] you to deal with but get past you he
[1:12:03] wants you to focus on him you keep your
[1:12:05] eyes stayed on him and when something
[1:12:07] comes that doesn't match up with him you
[1:12:09] put it aside Lord forgive me and you
[1:12:11] keep going and you keep
[1:12:14] pressing we we can't save this life this
[1:12:16] life is too
[1:12:18] precious you we didn't choose to be here
[1:12:21] we didn't choose to be born in this
[1:12:23] world we were just here
[1:12:27] so why are we dwelling on the things
[1:12:29] that are here this is not the life God
[1:12:32] wanted for
[1:12:34] us though he knew we had to come this
[1:12:36] way but this is not the life he wanted
[1:12:39] where life is death can't
[1:12:41] be we saw that in the life of Jesus
[1:12:44] Christ he was life and everywhere he
[1:12:46] went if death was there it had to leave
[1:12:49] so now he's put that life in you now how
[1:12:51] can where life is the things of this
[1:12:54] world which are death be
[1:12:56] present we we something's something's
[1:12:59] changed something's different we need to
[1:13:01] get back to what was given to us that
[1:13:04] pure word that said a Son of God a child
[1:13:08] of God there is no condemnation to them
[1:13:11] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:13:14] after the flesh but after the spirit so
[1:13:17] continue to press towards the spirit
[1:13:19] continue to press in that direction
[1:13:21] sooner than later the pull this flesh
[1:13:24] has gets weaker and we weaker it no
[1:13:26] longer has the pull it once had and
[1:13:28] you'll realize one day you'll be
[1:13:30] somewhere and you'll say hold on this
[1:13:31] thing used to affect me it doesn't
[1:13:33] affect me no more you didn't do that God
[1:13:36] did that you take you somewhere else man
[1:13:38] I thought this thing man I thought I was
[1:13:40] I thought this thing really was a bother
[1:13:41] to me man I I I fought this for three
[1:13:43] years now I could care less about it
[1:13:46] that's God Christ does that but H how
[1:13:49] does that happen how do you see that
[1:13:50] manifested in your life you dwell on the
[1:13:52] word you stay in the word and over time
[1:13:54] you watch he takes those things out of
[1:13:56] your life himself they don't really have
[1:13:59] a hold on you you're the one holding on
[1:14:01] to them the moment you decide you know
[1:14:04] what I've had enough then something can
[1:14:07] happen but if you keep holding on to
[1:14:09] these things because you enjoy it and so
[1:14:12] forth you you you might feel sorry when
[1:14:13] you're in service but then when you get
[1:14:15] home that's the first thing you're doing
[1:14:17] well you don't really feel sorry about
[1:14:19] it get out the spirit of of church and
[1:14:22] and and take what church is supposed to
[1:14:24] be cuz you are the church bring that
[1:14:27] back with you home and say you know you
[1:14:29] know I I don't like this sin I don't I I
[1:14:31] despise this thing it keeps battling me
[1:14:35] it makes me feel bad I don't like the
[1:14:37] the where it puts my mind at you got to
[1:14:40] get sick and tired of being sick and
[1:14:42] tired then God does something for you
[1:14:45] but so long as it's just when I'm in
[1:14:46] church I feel sorry about it when I get
[1:14:48] home it's h it's too strong I can't get
[1:14:50] past it I don't know I don't have the
[1:14:52] strength to stop it's not your strength
[1:14:54] that does does it it's his strength that
[1:14:56] does it your strength is made perfect
[1:14:59] when you're weak because then you really
[1:15:01] can't do anything and Christ says okay
[1:15:03] that's a man I can use see and and
[1:15:06] that's the situation that happened with
[1:15:07] Moses just getting down I jumped around
[1:15:11] working towards a close cuz I'm here now
[1:15:13] but that's where my inspiration came
[1:15:15] from because you look at the life of
[1:15:16] Moses right Moses with brother bam would
[1:15:20] say when uh when they put the baby in
[1:15:23] the water and he was going on Miriam was
[1:15:25] watching it and so forth then it got to
[1:15:27] Pharaoh's house and his and his daughter
[1:15:29] took the
[1:15:30] baby and said and Miriam said would you
[1:15:33] like me to find a Hebrew mother to take
[1:15:36] care of the baby and she went and got
[1:15:39] her mother the mother of the child M
[1:15:43] josed knew Miriam knew as well who Moses
[1:15:46] was and what he would be so imagine
[1:15:50] Moses is in his Egypt surrounded by the
[1:15:53] things of this world surrounded by the
[1:15:55] trial surrounded by just he what could
[1:15:58] he have
[1:15:59] had he probably could have been been the
[1:16:03] Pharaoh General strong Mighty and so
[1:16:06] forth knowledge intelligence wealth
[1:16:08] everything's around
[1:16:10] him and you you you want him to identify
[1:16:13] with the
[1:16:15] slaves the ones that are beaten that are
[1:16:17] stricken that are despised you want him
[1:16:19] to identify there reject his lavish
[1:16:22] lifestyle to accept
[1:16:25] these people but that's who he was and
[1:16:29] since his birth his mother was telling
[1:16:31] him Moses Moses Moses you're the
[1:16:35] deliverer Moses Moses you're you're
[1:16:38] promised son Moses Moses it wasn't until
[1:16:42] and Moses was hearing all this stuff
[1:16:44] then finally he came to a moment where
[1:16:46] he saw a Hebrew man getting beat by a
[1:16:50] Taskmaster and he took it into his own
[1:16:52] hand and said you know what I think it's
[1:16:54] the time now I've listened to 300 tapes
[1:16:57] I've read all the chapters in the Bible
[1:17:00] you know I pray 50 times a day I I think
[1:17:03] I'm strong enough now to go and take to
[1:17:05] handle this I I can live God you can
[1:17:07] relax I got this I I I'll take care of
[1:17:09] this
[1:17:11] battle granted Moses was nurtured in
[1:17:13] this knowing this and he was genuinely
[1:17:16] called for this purpose but God called
[1:17:19] them so God could do it through him not
[1:17:21] so Moses could do it and it wasn't until
[1:17:24] Moses realized my strength is nothing
[1:17:27] and he failed and he got old and tired
[1:17:30] and weary cuz he couldn't save it on his
[1:17:33] own then God said now I can use you he
[1:17:37] said no but I don't I don't have
[1:17:38] strength I don't have he said don't
[1:17:39] worry about that I'm in control I'm the
[1:17:42] one doing it cuz the promise said the
[1:17:45] promise was that I will deliver you God
[1:17:47] spoke of he said I will deliver you he
[1:17:49] never said he would send a man to
[1:17:51] deliver he said I would deliver you yet
[1:17:53] he used a man
[1:17:55] and here you are you're supposed to be
[1:17:58] the
[1:17:59] continuation of the book of Acts you're
[1:18:02] supposed to be the one to finish this
[1:18:04] this race take the message that was
[1:18:06] given and go and live it now God's not
[1:18:09] sending you out without coming with
[1:18:11] you he's sending you out and saying I'm
[1:18:14] coming with you can't do this on your
[1:18:16] own you can't make this stand by
[1:18:18] yourself you cannot live this life by
[1:18:21] yourself you need to give it over to me
[1:18:23] let me be the one that leads let me be
[1:18:26] the one that lives the life let me be
[1:18:28] the one not you me Paul would show us I
[1:18:32] Die daily so that Christ might live less
[1:18:35] of me more of him we need to get the me
[1:18:38] out of you and put Christ in you and
[1:18:42] more of him brother bam would say the
[1:18:44] more you empty the more God fills so
[1:18:47] empty the you that's in there that gets
[1:18:49] in the way the you that wants to have
[1:18:51] something to do with it right it's hard
[1:18:54] you terminology in sports where I hated
[1:18:57] participation trophies personally I
[1:19:01] don't want to be rewarded because I
[1:19:03] participated I want to be rewarded
[1:19:05] because I
[1:19:06] won
[1:19:07] so I I I wonder sometimes if that's us
[1:19:11] where it's like oh you get this what
[1:19:12] they call impostor impostor syndrome
[1:19:15] where you feel like you don't belong
[1:19:17] where God's called you to this standard
[1:19:19] he's called you to be this person and he

[1:19:50] be mine your thoughts shall be mine he's
[1:19:53] using every member of your body in order
[1:19:57] to live out the life that's a testimony
[1:20:01] that I want that regardless of the Mind
[1:20:04] battles and things that I get into that
[1:20:07] I can look and say you know what Christ
[1:20:09] you use me in this scenario you used me
[1:20:11] here you keep using me here and then
[1:20:14] surrender to a point that it's not me no
[1:20:16] more and I can I Ben's done Ben's done
[1:20:19] the best he can he's ran the race to his
[1:20:22] best he can't finish this race Lord You
[1:20:25] Take Control you lead you get there and
[1:20:28] you won't stop somewhere you'll keep
[1:20:30] going you'll keep pressing if Christ is
[1:20:32] in you he'll keep pressing until he
[1:20:34] achieves the goal the end goal whereas
[1:20:37] me and you will stop at something that
[1:20:40] excites us we'll stop where we're happy
[1:20:43] we're stop where we feel good but the
[1:20:46] Christian walk is not a Feelgood
[1:20:49] walk I I I really wish it was but the
[1:20:52] trials they're a part of it it you've
[1:20:56] got to be he's he's got to get the
[1:20:57] character out of you how he does it he
[1:20:59] never told you how he do it but he said
[1:21:01] he do it so in the trial Praise Him in
[1:21:05] the hard times Praise Him in the good
[1:21:08] times continue to praise him because
[1:21:10] he's working all those things to get the
[1:21:12] perfect character out of you desired for
[1:21:15] you so that you can finally be when
[1:21:18] you've completely surrendered and he's
[1:21:19] gotten that character in
[1:21:21] you knowing you as you were known and be
[1:21:25] that Perfect Image that he had in
[1:21:27] mind brother bam would say Satan raised

[1:22:15] for helping me Lord because I I didn't I
[1:22:18] didn't feel good Lord Jesus

[1:22:27] Jesus father I pray that you've said
[1:22:29] something to your people Lord

[1:22:34] my mind Lord
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:37] Jesus Lord I pray it was a blessing to
[1:22:39] somebody Lord
[1:22:42] Jesus but father I all I can do is just
[1:22:45] look at my personal life I don't know
[1:22:46] the Walk of the individual I don't know
[1:22:48] the Walk of all of all those that are
[1:22:50] listening Lord Jesus but I know that in
[1:22:53] my own life
[1:22:55] there's too much of me going
[1:22:57] on Lord we we we want to die out to me
[1:23:01] Lord Jesus we want it to be you father
[1:23:04] for how can we be perfect if it's
[1:23:09] us the name that was given to us was
[1:23:11] attached to this flesh so that anytime
[1:23:14] somebody saw this flesh they would
[1:23:15] mention it by name but father the name
[1:23:18] you gave us man can't see by the flesh
[1:23:22] they have to see it by a life
[1:23:25] that was the original life that the
[1:23:27] disciples had after people saw how they
[1:23:30] lived they called them Christians
[1:23:32] because of the life they lived they no
[1:23:35] longer had the memory of who they were
[1:23:36] in the flesh but they said no this this
[1:23:38] Behavior this character that they've now
[1:23:40] have it matches that of that man called
[1:23:43] Christ Lord let that be our testimony
[1:23:46] father that we so die out that you live
[1:23:49] that they don't see us Lord Jesus but
[1:23:51] they see you Lord that's the only way
[1:23:53] we'll be able to help somebody body

[1:35:17] one that's not caught up in the natural
[1:35:19] and the things that's happening around
[1:35:21] them but one that's focused in what the
[1:35:23] word is constantly saying this word is
[1:35:26] the unfolding of a believer of the true
[1:35:29] son and the more we eat it the more we
[1:35:32] unfold in that Perfect Image it's not by

[1:36:02] your heart was led up it came to life
[1:36:05] when you believed it it brought you to
[1:36:07] what you are today and the only way to
[1:36:10] get out of here is to believe the part
[1:36:12] of the word that says that you came from
[1:36:13] eternity and that's how you're going to
