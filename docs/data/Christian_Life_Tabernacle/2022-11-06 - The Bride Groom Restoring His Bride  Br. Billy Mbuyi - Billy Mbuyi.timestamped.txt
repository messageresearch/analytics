[15:33] amen I'm looking forward to
[15:36] what God has laid upon brother Billy's
[15:38] heart and just
[15:40] wanting to invite the Lord just to come
[15:42] in our midst and to have his will and to
[15:45] have his way amen and just to prepare
[15:47] our hearts for the communion table
[15:48] Heavenly Father
[15:50] we love you we're so thankful for your
[15:53] grace and your mercy that you have shown
[15:55] to us
[15:57] Lord to be forgiven for our sins
[16:00] Lord You Paid a Debt that you did not
[16:02] owe
[16:04] and we owed a debt we couldn't pay but
[16:06] you bared you bore our sins to Calvary
[16:08] Lord and
[16:10] you shed your blood that we might be
[16:12] able to identify with the sacrifice
[16:14] and come before you this evening Lord
[16:16] and ask as our pastor labored this
[16:19] morning Lord that we could ask
[16:21] [Music]
[16:23] and Lord if we could see it in your word
[16:25] we know it's your will
[16:27] so father we ask that
[16:29] you forgive us for our trespasses and
[16:31] our sins Lord
[16:34] that we could come to you with a
[16:36] boldness Lord knowing that you've cast
[16:39] our sea in our sins into the sea of your
[16:42] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[16:44] more Lord what a confidence that gives
[16:46] your children to know that we can come
[16:48] to you now
[16:49] with no baggage hanging on to us not
[16:51] worried about the past or things that
[16:54] have happened even yesterday but we can
[16:56] come with a confidence to know that your
[16:57] love and the blood that you shed is
[16:59] sufficient tonight Lord so Lord we're
[17:02] asking now that you would just move on
[17:04] behalf of each heart that's represented
[17:06] Lord even the prodigal sons and
[17:08] daughters that are away and ones that
[17:10] have backslid the Lord we're claiming
[17:11] them right now in the name of Jesus
[17:13] Christ Lord that they would find
[17:15] themselves in the Household of Faith
[17:16] Lord we send the Holy Ghost after them
[17:18] Lord I'm reminded of how the prophet
[17:20] knelt down with Believers and prayed the
[17:22] Holy Ghost would go after a stolen car
[17:25] and recover it how much more than a
[17:27] stolen car for our sons and our
[17:28] daughters and our wayward loved ones
[17:30] Lord so we ask these things in your name
[17:32] where we commit the service to you ask a
[17:35] blessing upon the tithes and the
[17:36] offerings Lord upon the preaching of the
[17:38] word and the communion that we'll take
[17:40] tonight Lord just asking that you would
[17:41] have your will away in all things we

[30:31] let's open our Bibles first in Joel
[30:36] chapter 2
[30:39] The Book of Joel chapter 2.
[30:45] let's read from
[30:49] there's a buzzing sound back here so if
[30:52] you could just help
[30:53] he says and I will wish Joel chapter 2
[30:57] let's read from verse 25 it says and I
[31:00] will restore unto you the years that the
[31:02] locusts had eaten that the canker worm
[31:05] and the caterpillar and the Palma worm
[31:07] my great Army which I have sent among
[31:10] you and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[31:13] satisfied and praise the name of the
[31:16] Lord your God that it dealt wondrously
[31:19] with you and my people shall never be
[31:22] ashamed and ye shall know that I am in
[31:25] the midst of Israel and that I am the
[31:27] Lord your God and none else it says in
[31:30] my people shall never be ashamed I like
[31:33] that reassurance is wanting you to know
[31:35] you're never going to be ashamed you're
[31:36] never going to be ashamed he says and I
[31:38] will come and and he shall and he shall
[31:42] come to pass that afterwards that I will
[31:44] poured out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[31:47] my sons and and your those sons and your
[31:50] daughters shall prophesy and your old
[31:52] men shall dream dreams and your young
[31:54] men shall see visions and also upon your
[31:57] servant upon the servants and upon the
[31:59] handmaids in those days I will pour out
[32:02] my spirit and I will show wonders in in
[32:05] the heavens and in the earth it says
[32:09] blood and fire and pillow of smoke Also
[32:14] let's turn in Psalms chapter one a very
[32:16] familiar scripture reading
[32:19] um
[32:22] Psalm chapter 1 it says
[32:25] blessed is a man that walketh not in the
[32:28] counsel of the ungodly no standeth in
[32:31] the way of Sinners no sitteth in the
[32:34] seat of scornful it says but his Delight
[32:37] is in the law of the Lord and in his law
[32:41] doeth he dwell meditate day and night
[32:44] and it shall be like a tree planted by
[32:47] the river of rivers of water and that
[32:50] bringeth forth his fruits in his season
[32:52] his life also shall not wither and
[32:56] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the
[32:59] ungodly are not so but but are like the
[33:03] the shaft which the winds drives away
[33:05] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[33:09] in judgment nor The Sinner in the
[33:12] congregation of the righteous for the
[33:14] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[33:16] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[33:19] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[33:21] reading of his word you may be seated
[33:22] man just for a few minutes
[33:26] I believe perhaps just trying to see if
[33:30] it could tie it in with what was spoken
[33:33] in this morning because remember we were
[33:35] told that we want to ask and be able to
[33:38] receive and I thought that perhaps this
[33:41] is something I've been looking at it
[33:43] could probably just help us understand
[33:46] to what extent God is wanting and
[33:48] Desiring to bless us as we read in Psalm
[33:52] it says blessed is a man that walketh
[33:53] not in the Council of the ungodly uh in
[33:57] in other words this man it doesn't pay
[33:59] any mind to what the unbeliever is
[34:01] saying he's not paying any mind to what
[34:04] the devil is saying his mind is all
[34:06] focused in what God wants to give him
[34:09] he's not interested in anything else
[34:12] except what God is in store for him he
[34:15] doesn't stand nor in in the way of
[34:18] Sinners nor city with the with in the
[34:20] state of the scornful but his Delight is
[34:23] in the law of the Lord his heart desire
[34:26] Burns for God and and he looks at and
[34:29] brother tells us that the word of God is
[34:31] the law of God he's he's always
[34:34] constantly in the word of God in the in
[34:37] the word of God and then he says and in
[34:39] his law he does meditate day and night
[34:41] in other words he's constantly looking
[34:44] at it and his desire is to see the
[34:47] manifestation of what God has spoken for
[34:50] the time and the age that they are
[34:52] living in and they are not interested
[34:54] like our pastor was saying this morning
[34:56] being interested in in in amassing
[34:59] wealth here on Earth they're not
[35:01] interested in oh I got to get a good job
[35:03] I got to get that all of that is fine
[35:06] but the focus of the life is in the law
[35:08] of God what is God wants me to do how
[35:11] can I be a better servant how can I do a
[35:13] good job his Delight is in the law of
[35:16] God and he shall be like a tree that's
[35:18] planted by the rivers of water and but
[35:21] when I'm says one place he says the
[35:23] rivers the many rivers but one water and
[35:26] then he says that signify I believe it
[35:28] says nine gifts of the Spirit but all of
[35:31] him the same Spirit nine different gifts
[35:33] but the Same Spirit The Same Spirit
[35:36] that's giving all of that and he
[35:38] bringeth forth his fruits in his season
[35:40] his leaves shall not shall not wither
[35:43] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now I
[35:47] want you to see how he's talking and
[35:49] he's talking about the setting of this
[35:51] tree he's planted by the river of water
[35:53] and is giving his fruits in his season
[35:56] in other words the the very source of
[36:00] worry is he's planted in the water he's
[36:03] not planted out somewhere where someone
[36:05] needs to go get a bucket of water and
[36:07] every once in a while water this tree so
[36:09] they can keep it alive no his very feet
[36:12] his very Roots is in the water and in
[36:15] there he brings forth the water and he
[36:18] transforms the water into fruits and his
[36:21] fruit is eaten up by others his fruits
[36:24] is for the the blessing of the people
[36:26] they can come and get a fruit from him
[36:29] and eat of this tree and this tree also
[36:33] have leaves that people can come in and
[36:35] stay under the shade for fellowshipping
[36:38] they're coming it's a tree that stands
[36:40] there people can come and they shade and
[36:42] they will will hide and they will come
[36:44] and they will come and help fellowship
[36:46] and they said and everything and Brahman
[36:48] says it is fruit as you can see it comes
[36:51] from the fact that it's connected to the
[36:53] roots and The Roots signify
[36:56] predestination so in other words the
[36:58] fruits that is bringing forth is just
[37:00] not any kind of fruits it's just not any
[37:03] kind of fruit so I want this fruit I
[37:05] want a shout I want to do this no the
[37:07] fruits is well it was predestinated for
[37:10] him to bring in the age that he was
[37:12] living in in the season that this tree
[37:15] was in so if it was time for it to bring
[37:17] a type of fruit it will bring it and it
[37:20] will be the best fruit it will be a
[37:23] fruit that you can take and taste it has
[37:25] all the sweets in it it has it produces
[37:27] and you can tell it's a real fruit it's
[37:30] amazing because I was talking about a
[37:32] while ago and we were talking how
[37:35] he said I went to Walmart and I got me
[37:37] some fruit some oranges he says but I
[37:39] took him and I eat him it tasted so
[37:41] different and it tasted so bitter it
[37:44] seems like he didn't have any much sweet
[37:46] in it and everything I said well because
[37:48] you got him out of season because you
[37:51] got him if you don't get something in
[37:53] the season of it it doesn't taste the
[37:55] way it's supposed to taste it doesn't
[37:57] really bring what he's supposed to bring
[37:59] but when you get it in the season that
[38:01] it's supposed to bring it it comes from
[38:03] with the full maturity and the fruits of
[38:06] it can be enjoyed and those fruits are
[38:09] permanent fruits they're not temporary
[38:11] fruits they're permanent fruits so he
[38:13] says his leaves creates a shade under
[38:16] which the people can come and rest they
[38:18] provide a place for Fellowship it
[38:21] produces the fruits which comes down
[38:23] from predestination this tree has life
[38:26] as long as it's in the water
[38:30] in other words Barbarian says this tree
[38:32] can never die
[38:35] this tree can never die and you look at
[38:38] it why because it's planted in the water
[38:40] as long as there's life flowing as long
[38:43] as there's water flowing this tree shall
[38:45] live forever why because it's planted in
[38:48] the water all he needs to do is continue
[38:50] to drink out of that water continue to
[38:53] take out of that water and then from
[38:55] then on it can produce the leaf that
[38:57] people can come and stay under he can
[38:59] come and produce the fruits that people
[39:01] can come and stay here and this is not
[39:03] just a treat this is the type of a True
[39:05] Believer who's in Jesus Christ and
[39:08] that's why we Rejoice because we're not
[39:10] just talking about some random tree
[39:11] somewhere we're talking about a Believer
[39:13] who's planted in Christ who knows the
[39:16] position who know that they have been
[39:18] planted here in this generation in this
[39:21] time for a purpose
[39:23] yeah
[39:24] they just don't run out to anything to
[39:27] hear oh behold this year to run over
[39:29] here no where he's planted he knows that
[39:32] God did the planting God did the
[39:35] watering and God is only expecting me to
[39:37] bring the fruits under which I'm planted
[39:40] where he has planted me this tree
[39:42] represent the elected of God he
[39:45] represented those that are in Christ and
[39:48] and the outside doesn't bother this tree
[39:52] oh it's not well you know I didn't have
[39:54] that so that's happening over there it
[39:57] cannot move it's planted in Christ it's
[39:59] sealed in Christ it's protected by
[40:02] Christ it will bring forth his spirit in
[40:04] his season if he doesn't bring for fruit
[40:06] it doesn't get all wrong that poor I
[40:09] can't believe I'm not breathing as long
[40:10] as he knows it's in Christ that's its
[40:13] security
[40:16] I
[40:17] this is not just a man
[40:20] this is more than a man this is a man
[40:23] who's planted in Christ when you are
[40:26] planted in Christ you're not just a
[40:28] natural man you become a supernatural
[40:30] person because it's no longer your life
[40:33] that's coming out it's his life being
[40:34] lived through you
[40:36] oftentimes we get caught up because we
[40:38] look so much our Humanity we're trying
[40:40] to perfect the humanity always Humanity
[40:43] Humanity but you be planted in Christ
[40:45] you will forget about Humanity what
[40:48] matters to you is where you are planted
[40:50] and who planted you
[40:54] yeah man but what I will say and it says
[40:57] David saw it and he speaks about this
[40:59] tree it says David saw it and he
[41:01] speaking he said blessed is a man he
[41:04] says notice he said he could not die his
[41:07] leaves his leaves would not weather he
[41:10] says no no no matter what they do that
[41:13] it says they will never kill it that
[41:15] tree why he says it's that's where he's
[41:18] planted that's it says that's what he
[41:21] does that's where he's planted is
[41:23] planted by the rivers of water he says
[41:26] now notice he says his roots won't die
[41:29] he says it says when strong wind and it
[41:34] says and then he says and then he says
[41:36] and then when the way of the markers and
[41:39] knows the last come and make fun of a
[41:42] Christian he says what it does it just
[41:45] pers it says is is persecution check the
[41:48] Christian it says it makes him pray more
[41:51] dig down get better hold so so that he
[41:55] can stand the storm
[41:58] oh my I would like to be this tree this
[42:02] is a representation of what we are being
[42:04] brought into this is the representation
[42:06] now remember I guess I didn't give a
[42:09] title so I I want to speak on the
[42:12] bridegroom restoring his bride the
[42:15] bridegroom restoring his bride so when
[42:18] he's talking about this tree and what
[42:19] this tree is able to do and what is able
[42:21] to endure he's telling you the
[42:23] representation of what you are called to
[42:25] be in the end time and is wanting you to
[42:28] know that this is what I'm bringing you
[42:30] to so you can be one that's planted by
[42:33] me so you can be one that's pointed in
[42:36] me that will not move he says when the
[42:38] storm comes when he moves the tree it
[42:41] only helps it to have a better hold
[42:47] he says
[42:48] he says now this is in the message
[42:52] restoration of the Bright Tree paragraph
[42:54] 156 of 156. it says now what if what
[42:59] what if what if a man is planted in such
[43:01] a thing by the river he says where the
[43:04] Springs of nine different Springs feed
[43:07] unto him oh my what an established uh he
[43:12] has he says he says and the man that's
[43:15] planted by the river it says the river
[43:17] of water one water it says of one water
[43:21] one Spirit there are Gifts of healing
[43:24] the same Gift gifts of Prophecy it says
[43:28] send gift uh Same Spirit and all Same
[43:31] Spirit many gifts one Giver he says now
[43:36] David saw him and it was planted by by
[43:39] the by this tree now he couldn't die now
[43:42] notice why he had the Life in The Roots
[43:46] his life didn't come from the the all
[43:49] because it was happening he was
[43:51] receiving sunlight that was receiving no
[43:53] the very life was being drawn out from
[43:56] the roots the sun was calling but the
[43:59] very life was being drawn from the root
[44:01] and I was everything would project when
[44:04] he would project the life was coming
[44:06] from the very roots and coming into the
[44:08] manifestation it says all he says or the
[44:11] life of the tree he says staying in The
[44:14] Roots certainly come up and bears its
[44:17] fruits all right he says watch his root
[44:20] had life in them
[44:23] to bring forth his fruits in his season
[44:26] now remember this tree will not cast its
[44:31] fruit it says now you take a tree that's
[44:34] put away from the water he says the
[44:37] first thing you know your fruit your
[44:39] your little old Apple uh your old apples
[44:43] it says they are all tardy and and warm
[44:45] eaten and casted out a cup
[44:50] that's how sometimes we become you know
[44:54] you get and then you know the the the
[44:56] fruits withered and they become small
[44:58] and they don't taste like they're
[45:00] supposed to taste and they don't look
[45:02] like they're supposed to look the leaves
[45:04] are all yellow and everything in life is
[45:06] being drawn out of it why because you
[45:08] have been taken away from the very water
[45:11] that you're supposed to drink and let me
[45:13] say this the the answer to every problem
[45:16] that a Believer has is in the word in
[45:19] the water that you're supposed to drink
[45:26] said oh I need this so I need this to
[45:29] either or I need money to pay my rent I
[45:32] need this you go you drink the water God
[45:34] will provide it for you you grow you
[45:37] drink the water God will provide
[45:38] whatever means he will call who he will
[45:41] touch and whatever he will do you just
[45:43] drink the water God will do the
[45:45] producing of the fruits you just stay in
[45:48] The Roots You just continue to bring off
[45:50] that water and God will produce the rest
[45:53] oftentimes we don't drink the water and
[45:56] then we try to solve the problem
[45:57] ourselves we run here we run here we run
[46:00] here and then we don't have a solution
[46:02] we take this problem to solve that
[46:04] problem and then we take that problem
[46:06] too so you can't solve one problem with
[46:08] another problem
[46:09] you need to forget it all and go back to
[46:12] the roots and sort of fresh that's why
[46:15] the prophet told us he says if this tree
[46:17] will bring forth another Branch an
[46:19] original Branch not a grafted Branch but
[46:22] it'll reach it off Branch it will
[46:24] produce the same act that he had the
[46:27] branch produced
[46:31] he says
[46:33] that's paragraph 1 6 it says that's
[46:35] what's the matter with the church today
[46:37] you done you've done gone away by the
[46:40] river you've done gone away from the
[46:42] river
[46:43] got away from them gifts of the Spirit
[46:46] they've just gotten Church natural
[46:48] they've gotten away from the spirit the
[46:51] spiritual gift and spiritual gift and
[46:53] they cast They cast their fruit
[46:56] it says do you do they do that it says
[46:59] what do they do they believe they
[47:02] Believers live in the world act like the
[47:06] world still cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble
[47:10] have uh a Banco party is in the church
[47:14] to pay to pay the preachers and
[47:17] everything else soup suppers dance see
[47:21] they cast their fruits it's just like
[47:24] the world and now it says in the next
[47:27] paragraph and the unbeliever who can say
[47:29] there's no difference in that person and
[47:33] me
[47:35] the scripture says by their future shall
[47:37] know them you shall see them by the
[47:40] fruit and the only way you can get the
[47:42] real fruits is to be rooted and grounded
[47:44] in this water that God has provided in
[47:47] the same time water that we are put into
[47:49] so we can bring forth the fruits that he
[47:51] wants us to do it says that's a man
[47:54] that's planted he says there's no stuck
[47:57] out
[47:58] by the man that's planted is not stuck
[48:00] out but planted by the river of water he
[48:04] shall bring forth his fruit
[48:06] watch is fruit
[48:09] his fruit in his season are you reading
[48:12] it he says someone it says blessed is a
[48:15] man that said it not in the seed of the
[48:17] sconeful sitting not in the way of
[48:19] Sinners he says he shall he shall be
[48:22] like a tree that's planted by the river
[48:23] of water and they shall bring forth his
[48:26] fruit in his season whatsoever he doeth
[48:29] shall prosper why because it's not doing
[48:32] his own idea it's not going about his
[48:35] own business just trying to get rich or
[48:37] do whatever everything that he does is
[48:40] connected to what's in the root
[48:42] every time he wants to do something
[48:45] is this going to reflect what's in the
[48:47] root no I'm not going to do it it's just
[48:49] going to is this going to show forth the
[48:52] predestinated life no then I don't need
[48:54] it
[48:55] whatever he does will prosper because
[48:58] it's the same thing and let me just jump
[48:59] and say that's why the prophet will say
[49:02] even you know in regards to the
[49:04] restoration it says oh that the harmony
[49:07] that existed between the Father and Son
[49:09] it says that same Harmony must exist
[49:12] between Christ and the bride why it's
[49:15] the harmony of the tree knowing I have
[49:18] no business looking for anything outside
[49:20] except what's coming from the root
[49:27] it says
[49:30] let me just skip something for this it
[49:33] says now it says he shall bring forth
[49:35] his fruit in his season watch he's he's
[49:37] he says the person the this personal uh
[49:41] this it says he is personal pronoun it
[49:44] says there his fruits God's fruits in
[49:48] the season that the prophet is bringing
[49:50] it
[49:51] God's fruits in the season that the
[49:54] prophet is bringing in not not just any
[49:56] other kind of fruit but the fruit that
[49:59] the prophet has told us that we shall
[50:01] bring forth the fruits that have been
[50:03] prophesied that we shall bring forth
[50:05] that's the fruit I'm looking for if if
[50:07] the word says in this age the bride
[50:09] shall be like the bridegroom that's the
[50:12] fruit I want to see it's not the fruit
[50:14] of just oh rejoicing rejoicing is part
[50:17] of it it's not just the bread of
[50:18] shouting it's part of it but the fruit
[50:21] is to identify the life and say this is
[50:24] the life that was promised for this
[50:25] moment
[50:27] it says it's in that prophet's season
[50:32] God's fruit God it says In God's Time by
[50:37] The Prophet's season see it shall bring
[50:41] forth his fruits in his season see if
[50:44] there isn't two it says is there it says
[50:48] bring forth his God's fruit see in the
[50:52] season that the messenger is ordained to
[50:55] come
[50:59] he will bring forth those now remember
[51:01] that the messenger that brings the fruit
[51:04] of God will bring in God's season in the
[51:09] season of the bringer see he will bring
[51:12] forth his fruits in his season and he
[51:15] cannot wither he says why his God
[51:18] predestinated fruit in there
[51:22] it can destroy it because it's
[51:24] predestinated
[51:28] we can't be destroyed
[51:30] we we can't be turned aside we can go
[51:33] this way or that way we are
[51:35] predestinated to be here for this hour
[51:38] and now let me say this before I can
[51:40] move on and I know I'm running against
[51:42] time I'm just trying to lay a foundation
[51:43] we'll probably pick it up next time
[51:47] um
[51:48] when I'm
[51:50] situation of the bright tree is
[51:56] we know he talks about what restoration
[51:58] is to bring back to the original owner
[52:00] and all those things and I just want to
[52:02] say this statement before I can move on
[52:04] so we can kind of establish what my mind
[52:06] is tonight now I just want to say now
[52:09] restoration was only for the end time
[52:13] everything else that was me on it was it
[52:15] was a build up to it but it wasn't the
[52:18] proper Restoration in other words for
[52:20] you to say something is restored it's
[52:23] not until it produced the same
[52:25] properties the same everything like the
[52:28] original now it can produce some and
[52:30] Will Rejoice about it because God is in
[52:32] the middle of working his program but
[52:34] it's not until it comes in it's a full
[52:36] maturity that you can say uh this is it
[52:40] this is what was promised in other words
[52:42] we could say we could sit here but when
[52:44] it says restoration is not replacement
[52:47] respiration is not taking one and
[52:49] replacing it with another restoration is
[52:51] to bring forth the same one that went in
[52:54] the ground the same one that went Wicked
[52:56] Christ came he was the word of God in
[52:59] fullness but it was not until he took
[53:02] his life and replaced it into his bride
[53:05] it's not until he took that life and
[53:07] press it into the bride that we could
[53:09] see another man come back and do the
[53:12] same work that Christ head that's why we
[53:14] can call restoration
[53:17] now now it's just not a restoration it's
[53:21] just not one thing it's a restoration of
[53:24] the full word because partial word bring
[53:27] partial restoration that's why we can
[53:29] say there was in three stages as the
[53:32] prophet will say it it came there was
[53:34] the first part where he came and says
[53:36] Luther came and Wesley came in those
[53:38] messages came so he was in the build up
[53:41] that God was doing but full restoration
[53:43] is not until the end time so restoration
[53:46] is to bring forth like I said the
[53:49] harmony that existed before the fall
[53:53] and I want to say this in the end time
[53:55] this message is the message of
[53:58] restoration
[53:59] when you come in contact with this
[54:02] message it restores you right back into
[54:05] the original Christian that God desires
[54:08] to see in this generation there is not
[54:11] another message under the face of the
[54:13] Earth that will do this for you another
[54:15] message will give you partial
[54:17] restoration it will make you just a
[54:19] church member it will cause you to be an
[54:22] intellect but this message tells you
[54:24] what was in God's mind and what God
[54:27] desires to say in the end time
[54:32] now let me say this when we Barbara is
[54:35] when he preaches there he talks about
[54:37] this comes with the process of of of of
[54:42] of enforcing the rightful condition of
[54:45] something so we understand by saying
[54:48] that that if we were if we were to say
[54:50] we are being restored it means we are
[54:53] being restored to something that existed
[54:55] before we could be what we are today so
[54:57] when we speak about the Bright Tree
[54:59] there had to be somewhere somehow that
[55:03] we were the bright tree that we read in
[55:05] Psalm chapter one we were that kind of
[55:07] tree we had all those attributes within
[55:09] us and somehow we had fallen and God is
[55:13] trying to get back with us to that place
[55:15] that he had in the original mind so we
[55:17] let me say this it's not by chance that
[55:20] we are in the flesh that we are in
[55:23] it's not by any chance it was all part
[55:26] of God's plan that we may come into this
[55:29] world but before we can come there had
[55:32] to be some predestination somewhere that
[55:34] can say that you even though you came
[55:37] this way I've made you with the ability
[55:39] that you could be returned back to this
[55:45] and and that's God's law that's God's
[55:48] word that's him doing it that's him
[55:51] promising it that's him uh proclaiming
[55:55] but no greater than himself that this is
[55:57] gonna happen and there's nothing that
[55:59] can stop it
[56:02] so he barabbana speaks now and I thought
[56:05] this was so amazing this is the and I
[56:09] heard about a master prayer and I
[56:10] thought it was stepping on my Note
[56:11] already
[56:12] it's in the same message that brother
[56:15] Branham talks about I believe it was
[56:17] brother Evan's car
[56:19] that was stolen
[56:21] it's in the same message before he can
[56:24] actually start preaching now oh that's
[56:27] that's why I love this message so much
[56:29] but one of them is giving you a preview
[56:32] of what actually happened before he can
[56:35] preach the word to you to let you know
[56:38] I'm just not giving you some stories
[56:40] that you can go like that you can go and
[56:42] tell your friends and tell others no
[56:44] what I'm about to preach right now has
[56:47] just happened and I know about what I'm
[56:49] talking about what I'm preaching right
[56:51] now is a result of something that God
[56:54] just did
[56:58] so we can sit here and know if I take
[57:01] the same word if I come back with the
[57:03] same attitude if I come back with the
[57:06] same way the same God will restore the
[57:08] car the same God will restore me why
[57:11] because he didn't just give the word he
[57:13] proved it so that I know that his word
[57:16] is true
[57:19] so now he speaks here he says uh if if
[57:23] something was to be stolen like you were
[57:25] to lose your property or something that
[57:28] you would have to have something that
[57:30] proves or some laws that that would stay
[57:34] that would support that this particular
[57:36] property belonged to you and if it was
[57:39] yours if you could prove it then then uh
[57:43] the laws of the land will support you so
[57:46] I'll just read quickly so we can move on
[57:48] paragraph 88 it says enforcing
[57:51] it says then we have the privilege to
[57:54] enforce
[57:56] let me just go up a little bit paragraph
[57:59] 85 it says like if someone stole some
[58:01] properties if they are holding the
[58:03] property captive then you can take the
[58:06] law and go to this person and the law in
[58:09] law the love and the law of forces
[58:13] enforces this person to restore the
[58:16] property back to its natural owner
[58:19] it goes to someone that it doesn't
[58:22] belong to the law of the land whatever
[58:25] that situation is will force so that the
[58:28] person can return it back to the
[58:30] original owner it says the first estate
[58:33] enforcement oh it says what attacks I'd
[58:36] like to have two days on this enforcing
[58:38] it says now but now let me skip that so
[58:42] it says enforcing then it says we have
[58:46] the privilege listen to this to enforce
[58:48] upon Satan they claim that God gives us
[58:54] now let me just profess this the word of
[58:58] God is the law of God the word of God is
[59:02] the law that governs everything and the
[59:05] law is God's word being enforced
[59:08] now it says God God has a law
[59:12] and his word is a law
[59:14] God in his word made a certain claim to
[59:19] the church
[59:20] are you in the Church of God tonight
[59:22] tell you we can identify and say I'm the
[59:25] church why are you in the church I've
[59:27] been born by the spirit of God I didn't
[59:30] get to this by myself I didn't just wake
[59:33] up and say I desire God I want God no
[59:35] I've been birthing to this Kingdom and
[59:38] someone something within me connected
[59:40] with this word and I'm sure I am God's
[59:43] word I'm God's Church
[59:46] now that there's so many other things
[59:50] that's still out there I still have this
[59:52] I still have that I still have so many
[59:54] other things hanging off of me but he's
[59:56] wanting you to know what is your your
[59:58] personal identification yo you as you're
[1:00:02] sitting here how can you identify
[1:00:04] yourself
[1:00:06] therefore we have the right to force
[1:00:10] those claim upon Satan
[1:00:12] give me back and he has to do it because
[1:00:17] we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit
[1:00:21] I love that because I you know so much
[1:00:25] we stop about the Holy Spirit what is
[1:00:27] the Holy Spirit and and what is job you
[1:00:30] know again I thought Brother David just
[1:00:32] touched on and maybe you didn't pay
[1:00:33] attention the reason I I was sitting
[1:00:36] back there I knew I was going to say
[1:00:37] something tonight so these things were
[1:00:39] just constantly on my mind as you were
[1:00:41] saying it so in other words when the
[1:00:44] word is given the holy spirit is the
[1:00:48] agent who takes the word and brings it
[1:00:51] to pass
[1:00:53] not another Spirit from somewhere else
[1:00:55] not some other something falling off of
[1:00:58] the sky and coming upon you no when the
[1:01:01] world is spoken there is a spirit
[1:01:04] attached to it that would come and take
[1:01:06] that word and make it a reality to you
[1:01:12] when you believe the word you activate
[1:01:15] the agent to come to you and show you
[1:01:18] that what you believe is the reality of
[1:01:20] God
[1:01:22] oh I love how he places it so the agent
[1:01:26] is always there around the world all you
[1:01:28] need is the word all you need is to hear
[1:01:31] the word all you need is to come in
[1:01:33] contact with the word the agent will
[1:01:35] come back and will prove to you but that
[1:01:38] what you heard is the word if that's why
[1:01:41] well I just spoke to you now if what I
[1:01:44] said is the truth Hallelujah if what I
[1:01:47] just spoke to you is God's word then
[1:01:50] he's ancient he's he's bound to come
[1:01:53] around and show you that this is God's
[1:01:56] word
[1:01:57] don't go look for the edge and look for
[1:02:00] the word because where the word is the
[1:02:02] ancient is also there
[1:02:09] no word people are just oh what are you
[1:02:11] screaming about
[1:02:13] for the year look for the word
[1:02:15] for the world because the agent is not
[1:02:18] far near
[1:02:20] because his job is to make the world a
[1:02:22] reality to your heart
[1:02:25] like I said
[1:02:30] we're not going to go anywhere tonight
[1:02:34] foreign
[1:02:37] the Holy Spirit go right down on our
[1:02:40] knees and say
[1:02:43] that saith the Lord
[1:02:45] he he says he's got to give it up
[1:02:48] that's all because the holy spirit is
[1:02:52] there to make him do it
[1:02:55] he didn't say you go make the devil do
[1:02:57] it he didn't say you scream till the
[1:02:59] devil does it he didn't say you have to
[1:03:02] do nothing you believe the word
[1:03:05] what's the agent
[1:03:07] San Diego with the word say God I
[1:03:10] believe your word I believe what I just
[1:03:13] heard where is the agent I need the
[1:03:15] agent to make this a reality to my heart
[1:03:18] the ancient will come and we will make
[1:03:20] it a reality to you
[1:03:24] now he says the law of the land
[1:03:27] enforced to enforce it says by the law
[1:03:32] by the land and the land he says but the
[1:03:35] law of the spirit paragraph 89 but the
[1:03:38] law of the spirit of God is to enforce
[1:03:41] Satan to give up that which he has
[1:03:46] unwhitefully deceitfully taken from God
[1:03:50] he says Souls of man he took from God
[1:03:54] Souls of women children sicknesses on
[1:03:58] them on their body he says he placed
[1:04:01] them upon people where God made him in
[1:04:05] his image but like to be like to be like
[1:04:09] him and the church is given the rightful
[1:04:13] legal right by the Bible to take the
[1:04:16] Holy Spirit and to enforce upon them
[1:04:20] now
[1:04:22] I just want to give you the order I said
[1:04:25] I wasn't going to do this but
[1:04:31] Branham talks about the stolen car
[1:04:34] and I'm not going to go through all of
[1:04:36] it
[1:04:37] but there's a prayer that he makes that
[1:04:39] he says that I just started so wonderful
[1:04:44] it's important when we come to God
[1:04:47] we put his words on our lips like we
[1:04:50] heard it this morning the idea is not to
[1:04:53] come and to cry and to ball and to turn
[1:04:55] around on the on the platform it says oh
[1:04:58] God oh God oh God no what God wants to
[1:05:01] hear is his word coming back to him
[1:05:04] what God wants to know is what law are
[1:05:07] you bringing in front of me why did I
[1:05:10] promise you I was going to do when did I
[1:05:13] promise it and how did I say I was going
[1:05:15] to do it if you're looking for something
[1:05:18] beautiful Cain offered Something
[1:05:20] Beautiful he offered the great exceeding
[1:05:23] great worship that anybody will look and
[1:05:25] say I will take that but that's not what
[1:05:28] God took why because the agent could not
[1:05:31] come near that what God was looking for
[1:05:33] was a representation of something that
[1:05:37] he did
[1:05:41] it's always the word my brother my
[1:05:44] sister we can never talk enough about
[1:05:46] the word of God
[1:05:50] so now hear this prayer he says
[1:05:52] paragraph 95 it says now we got on our
[1:05:55] knees about five men it says brother
[1:05:58] Fred softman and many of the others that
[1:06:02] were there uh four or five men he says
[1:06:04] we went down on our knees now listen to
[1:06:07] this paragraph 8 95 it says I pleaded
[1:06:10] this case before God
[1:06:13] and then I took the word
[1:06:16] or the promise and send it forth
[1:06:20] it says the great Holy Spirit
[1:06:24] as he took the word to serve the summon
[1:06:29] it says a vision broke and I saw the man
[1:06:33] going down towards bowling alley
[1:06:36] it's not complicated we complicate stuff

[1:08:38] right now's the time to ask
[1:08:42] right you've got everything laid down
[1:08:44] you know how to ask you know who you are
[1:08:47] you don't have amnesia
[1:08:50] all things are possible
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] what hindereth you
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:59] we've got water we have everything we
[1:09:01] have need of that just it just wonderful
[1:09:05] I believe that our Sunday school kids
[1:09:08] are in we think we're grateful for that
[1:09:10] and we're grateful for everything let's
[1:09:14] be in anticipation and uh
[1:09:17] and uh really have faith uh for all the
[1:09:23] things that God can do for us and and uh
[1:09:26] you know buy these great and exceeding
[1:09:30] precious promises
[1:09:32] amen we're partakers of divine nature
[1:09:36] but don't you just love the enforcement
[1:09:38] part
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:43] you've got your part to play
[1:09:46] amen it's just you know you've got your
[1:09:49] part
[1:09:50] the believing the taking the word the
[1:09:54] applying of the word the same issue is
[1:09:58] no good having a tool bag
[1:10:00] if you don't
[1:10:01] use it
[1:10:03] right and so I just love that I just
[1:10:07] don't want to stay in here
[1:10:09] for a while I just can't preach I tell
[1:10:12] Billy all the time Billy I'm just going
[1:10:15] to give you the idea you go preach it
[1:10:18] you know what I mean
[1:10:22] um
[1:10:22] you know age does a lot of things to you
[1:10:27] but one of the things I think it does
[1:10:29] for you is it gives you wisdom and part
[1:10:32] of the wisdom is as you know that if you
[1:10:35] follow the law it'll work
[1:10:38] amen and so uh let's go ahead and find
[1:10:43] our our communion
[1:10:45] scripture and
[1:10:48] I I got to get over in First Corinthians
[1:10:57] he was the 11th chapter
[1:11:01] of Corinthians and
[1:11:04] and I believe our communions prepared
[1:11:07] but you know one of the things that
[1:11:12] we
[1:11:14] have to realize is that Satan
[1:11:18] never wants you
[1:11:21] to
[1:11:22] ever come to the realization of who that
[1:11:26] you really are
[1:11:28] and remember he said when we can
[1:11:30] recognize Who We Are
[1:11:32] and our position that's when you become
[1:11:35] an invincible Army
[1:11:37] because it's not you it's the acceptance
[1:11:42] that God gave you his word
[1:11:46] and when you know he's giving you his
[1:11:48] word he didn't give you
[1:11:51] his word so you could put an
[1:11:54] intellectual stamp on it
[1:11:56] that it's true
[1:11:58] you know what I mean because his word
[1:12:01] isn't just the pages of this book his
[1:12:05] words Living Word
[1:12:08] and then you know and I I thought that
[1:12:11] when he said if you're living the word
[1:12:16] then everything you do is the will of
[1:12:19] God
[1:12:21] you know you don't have to fall into
[1:12:23] that great battle is this the will is
[1:12:26] that the will light brother Billy said
[1:12:29] he is his will and the mind of God is
[1:12:34] the will of God and God's Will and of
[1:12:37] his word so if you're in that Living
[1:12:39] Water
[1:12:41] you know what I mean and your trees are
[1:12:43] alive and your fruits are being
[1:12:47] expressed then that is the will of God
[1:12:51] and then anything that takes you from
[1:12:54] that that's what you cut off
[1:12:57] you don't burden yourself do I go here
[1:13:01] do I go here do I do this do I do that
[1:13:04] that's somebody who's not sure of
[1:13:06] themselves but amen you know you're not
[1:13:09] a snob
[1:13:10] but you got confidence
[1:13:12] amen and there's one thing you know if I
[1:13:16] do it in the right spirit
[1:13:18] that God will make it right amen if I
[1:13:21] get in the permissive will he'll lead me
[1:13:24] to the perfect will you can't live you
[1:13:27] can't live being afraid
[1:13:29] Jesus Takes the fear away the spirit
[1:13:33] takes the fear away the life in the love
[1:13:36] of God being shed abroad in your heart
[1:13:39] with the Holy Spirit if I could sum up
[1:13:43] in kind of an understanding of
[1:13:46] everything that Billy said it's the
[1:13:48] Capstone
[1:13:51] is that perfect love of his word it's
[1:13:54] applying the word in perfect love and
[1:13:57] the believer takes control of every
[1:14:00] circumstances amen you get a
[1:14:03] circumstances you know you can take
[1:14:05] control of it if you're in him
[1:14:08] sickness death family members everything
[1:14:11] there's nothing that we can't climb to
[1:14:14] in the heights of the Lord amen I love
[1:14:19] how brother Bram said just keep coming
[1:14:21] up just keep coming up we're coming up
[1:14:24] Church don't you love them amen we don't
[1:14:27] want partial restoration do we we want
[1:14:30] full restoration
[1:14:31] amen amen so let's stand together we'll
[1:14:35] have communion at this time
[1:14:39] and that's what communion is it's you
[1:14:42] and him getting together brother Branham
[1:14:45] said there's healing in communion
[1:14:48] so you can come with your petition this
[1:14:51] evening you can come knowing that you're
[1:14:55] doing the word of God and communion
[1:14:58] itself becomes enforcement
[1:15:01] amen you can come and say I'm partaking
[1:15:04] of the word I'm coming and doing what
[1:15:07] I'm told to do I'm keeping his
[1:15:09] commandment so Satan by doing this I'm
[1:15:12] going to lay my petition and I'm going
[1:15:15] to claim what my promise is and you can
[1:15:18] have what you ask for
[1:15:21] tonight
[1:15:23] amen so let's read he said
[1:15:28] in the 23rd chapter verse of the 11th
[1:15:32] chapter of Corinthians
[1:15:34] he speaks these words
[1:15:37] he says I have
[1:15:39] for I have received of the Lord
[1:15:42] that which
[1:15:44] also I deliver unto you
[1:15:48] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:15:52] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:15:56] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:15:59] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:16:03] which is broken for you this do ye in
[1:16:09] remembrance of me
[1:16:11] and after the same manner also he took
[1:16:15] the cup
[1:16:16] when he had sucked saying this cup is
[1:16:20] the New Testament in my blood
[1:16:23] this Duty as often as she drink it
[1:16:28] in remembrance of me
[1:16:31] for for as often as ye eat
[1:16:36] this bread
[1:16:38] and drink this cup
[1:16:40] ye do show the Lord's death till he
[1:16:43] comes
[1:16:44] wherefore wherever who shall
[1:16:47] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:16:51] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:16:54] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:16:58] and the blood of the Lord
[1:17:00] but let a man examine himself
[1:17:03] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:17:07] drink of that cup
[1:17:09] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:17:12] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:17:14] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:17:17] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:17:21] sickly among you and many
[1:17:23] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:17:27] should not be judged but when we are
[1:17:31] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:17:34] we should not be condemned with the
[1:17:36] world wherefore my brethren when ye come
[1:17:39] together
[1:17:41] to eat Terry one for another and if any
[1:17:44] man hunger let him eat at home till you
[1:17:47] come not together unto come the nation
[1:17:50] and the rest while I set in order
[1:17:54] when I come amen aren't those beautiful
[1:17:57] words
[1:17:58] a wonderful
[1:17:59] things I can just imagine how it was
[1:18:02] when Paul was established in communion
[1:18:06] and the wonderful spirit of the Lord I
[1:18:09] feel such a wonderful spirit here
[1:18:11] amen I believe that you could have
[1:18:14] whatever you asked for
[1:18:16] tonight believe had Faith let your
[1:18:19] petitions rise before the Lord tonight

[1:18:25] authority
[1:18:27] that we can go forth and claim all that
[1:18:30] we have need of I bless you
[1:18:40] let us all
[1:18:43] pray together and you joined and you
