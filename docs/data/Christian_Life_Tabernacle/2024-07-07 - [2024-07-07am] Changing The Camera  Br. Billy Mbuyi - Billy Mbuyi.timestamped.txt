[41:00] just thank the Lord for healing me from
[41:02] an allergy
[41:04] reaction and so you know an allergy

[41:15] those things could be overcome amen and
[41:17] so we're thankful for that that's that's
[41:20] not a small thing I believe in healing
[41:23] it doesn't limit what it is a reaction's
[41:26] not I mean an allergy is not common it's
[41:30] it's something that your body reacts to
[41:31] and I believe in healing and that's
[41:33] healing amen and so if you have a need
[41:36] upon your heart this
[41:38] morning if you know somebody there's a
[41:40] need if you know somebody that may have

[53:46] world and come and do according to your
[53:49] promise in the end time Lord that we may
[53:51] be satisfied to be in your house this
[53:53] morning that we can go out of here and
[53:55] say which good to be in the presence of
[53:58] God we love you Lord this morning Lord
[54:00] and we commit everything that we are we
[54:03] commit what we are to you Lord because
[54:05] we know that in your hands you will
[54:06] prosper it oh Father Prosper us
[54:09] according to your word we love you and
[54:11] we ask this things in the name of the
[54:13] Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[54:16] amen
[54:18] amen amen God bless you this morning
[54:20] want to welcome all our visitors and
[54:23] we're certainly glad to be GA in his
[54:24] presence amen with believe that
[54:27] something could be said this morning
[54:29] amen that will be of a uh help to you
[54:32] amen um before we get started certainly
[54:36] want to continue to remember our pastor
[54:38] he'll certainly be back next week and we
[54:40] pray that the Lord will give them
[54:41] traveling mercies and bring back to us
[54:44] um the our youth meetings are going to
[54:47] be a couple of months from now so in
[54:49] August 30th is our youth meeting so it's
[54:52] the Labor Day weekend um so the first
[54:55] service is on the 30th so usually when
[54:57] you say Labor Day weekend people think
[54:59] forward but so it's it starts from the
[55:02] 30th to the 1st um it's going to be
[55:04] brother Danny stean ministering and so
[55:07] um it's going to start on August uh the
[55:09] 30th and wer until September 1st uh what
[55:13] we would like to do and the reason for
[55:15] the early notification is so that um we
[55:18] can uh perhaps try to get back in the
[55:21] same way that we did it before uh which
[55:23] was we we won the church part
[55:26] participation we want everybody to to be
[55:29] part of the meeting it's not something
[55:31] that we just do where we say it's youth
[55:33] meeting and then no we want uh those
[55:36] that could that have the ability to host
[55:39] um we've always I believe that's with
[55:41] the leadership of our pastor that's how
[55:43] we've always been led to do it not to
[55:45] have kids stay at the hotel and other
[55:47] places but have our own church family be
[55:50] able to host them and and have kids
[55:53] staying at your places and and and
[55:54] different so if you could do that uh
[55:57] we'll have uh certainly we'll put some
[55:59] uh uh pages in the library so we can
[56:02] fill it up and have it all filled up and
[56:04] you can uh and if you're able to
[56:06] continue uh bring a meal to those that
[56:08] are hosting and all those things so
[56:10] we'll just try to organize it the same
[56:12] way we've done it before and I believe
[56:14] it'll be a blessing for the whole body
[56:16] not just for the Youth but all of us
[56:18] together working together
[56:20] amen let's open our Bibles this morning
[56:24] um and we'll continue to announce it and
[56:26] make U uh make it more uh uh give more
[56:30] details as we move uh forward uh Luke
[56:33] Chapter 5 are you happy to be in the
[56:35] house of God this morning amen my my
[56:37] heart desires for God to speak to me I
[56:40] came to church to hear from God and yet
[56:43] I'm the one standing here so we'll see
[56:45] that uh Luke Chapter
[56:49] 5 uh verse one a very familiar scripture
[56:53] reading it says I just wait a until you
[56:56] get to the
[57:01] page and also don't forget tonight is
[57:03] our communion service so I believe the
[57:06] church will be just as full as it is
[57:08] this morning so I pray and I have a hope
[57:12] and I believe and I put my faith in
[57:14] there that we be just as full amen and
[57:16] brother Matthew will be ministering for
[57:18] us Luke Chapter 5 it says and it came to
[57:21] pass that as people pressed upon him to
[57:25] hear the word of of God he stood by the
[57:28] lake of greenstone I I just love it I I
[57:31] trust as Believers we learn to press
[57:34] upon the word to hear the word of God we
[57:37] learn to put everything aside and Our
[57:40] obligation when it's time for the word
[57:41] let's press into the word of God and I
[57:44] believe when you do that you'll get r
[57:46] word
[57:47] results but R makes a
[57:50] statement it's too
[57:53] early that that there's there's never
[57:55] been
[57:56] anybody that that that has borrowed
[57:59] something that God has borrowed
[58:01] something from them and never returned
[58:03] 100 fold and and it's very important if
[58:06] you can borrow him your time this
[58:08] morning say Lord I have given you my
[58:10] time now I know his his time he gave you
[58:13] but let's just look at it from this
[58:15] other angle so if you give him your time
[58:17] this morning you will go out of here
[58:22] blessed so he stood by the lake Green
[58:26] starred and he said and he saw two ships
[58:28] standing by the lake uh but the
[58:31] fishermen were gone out of them and were
[58:34] washing the Nets so they had gone try to
[58:36] fish and they couldn't get anything so
[58:38] they came back and they were washing the
[58:39] Nets and it was the end of the day and
[58:42] everything was done and and and and that
[58:44] was the case and he entered into one of
[58:47] the ships and it said which was Simon's
[58:49] and prayed him that he that he would uh
[58:52] uh Thrust out uh uh little from the land
[58:56] and he sat down and he taught the people
[58:58] out of the ship and he says now when he
[59:01] had left when he had had left speaking
[59:04] he said unto Simon launch out into the
[59:07] deep and and let uh draw your net for
[59:11] the dra and Simon answered and said unto
[59:14] him and said Master we have toiled all
[59:17] night and have taken nothing
[59:20] nevertheless at Thy word I will draw
[59:23] down the net
[59:26] let's continue and when they had done it
[59:29] they said and they enclosed a great
[59:32] multitude of fish and the net break and
[59:36] they bacon unto their Partners uh which
[59:40] were uh in the other ship and that they
[59:43] should come and help them and they came
[59:46] and fill both ships and they and they
[59:49] began to sink it says when Simon Peter
[59:52] saw so when s when Simon Peter saw this
[59:54] he fell down at Jesus feet saying depart
[59:57] from me for I am I am a sinful man oh
[1:00:00] Lord for he had he was astonished and
[1:00:04] all and all that they were that were
[1:00:07] with him and the droughts of the fish
[1:00:10] which they had which they had taken and
[1:00:13] so was also James and John and and Sons
[1:00:17] of zebede which were partners with Simon
[1:00:21] and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from
[1:00:25] hence forth
[1:00:26] Thou shalt catch man and when they had
[1:00:29] brought their ship to the land they
[1:00:32] forsook all and followed him our father
[1:00:35] we ask that you bless your word to us in
[1:00:37] the name of Jesus we ask this amen you
[1:00:39] may have your seats this morning this
[1:00:42] morning uh we I I just want to start out
[1:00:46] and say that just come to an
[1:00:50] understanding and and say this morning
[1:00:54] the the the it's it's the word of God
[1:00:56] that brings faith in the hearts of
[1:00:59] Believers but will say one place that
[1:01:02] some people worship trees and they have
[1:01:04] faith in in the Sun and the Moon and all
[1:01:07] of those things but he said that when
[1:01:09] you do that the only problem is those
[1:01:12] things they don't they have no ability
[1:01:14] to speak back to you because they are
[1:01:16] dead and they will speak about how they
[1:01:18] will draw it says a men will say well
[1:01:20] I'll touch the tree and this is going to
[1:01:22] happen but if you do that the tree has
[1:01:24] no virtue that it would Minister back to
[1:01:26] you so you could get but real faith
[1:01:29] comes from God and it only comes from
[1:01:31] the word of God we we can get excited we
[1:01:34] can say all that we want but only when
[1:01:37] you hear the word of God that's when you
[1:01:39] can receive real Faith you can receive
[1:01:41] enthusiasm from somebody you can receive
[1:01:44] motivation from a speaker you can
[1:01:46] receive all of that but you can never
[1:01:48] really receive true Faith because Faith
[1:01:51] only comes by the word of God and as
[1:01:54] sons of daughters of God we live by the
[1:01:57] word of God by every word that proceeded
[1:02:00] out of the mouth of God the word of God
[1:02:02] is our Lifeline is what gives us life
[1:02:06] the word is the blood that flows through
[1:02:08] our vein it's a heartbeat so if you take
[1:02:11] the word away from us we are dead the
[1:02:14] word is what gives us life and that's
[1:02:16] the understanding I want us to have this
[1:02:18] morning the word of God is God himself
[1:02:21] giving himself to the believer so if you
[1:02:24] have the word of God you have God
[1:02:26] himself you don't have a men's
[1:02:28] interpretation if you say I'm standing
[1:02:30] on the word of God in other word God is
[1:02:33] with you it means what you are doing you
[1:02:35] are standing on him you are he's the one
[1:02:38] holding you up so if you ever want to
[1:02:41] know whether you are wrong or you are
[1:02:43] right just find out what the word said
[1:02:45] if you stand by the word God will
[1:02:47] vindicate his own word and I want to say
[1:02:50] this but makes a statement he says when
[1:02:52] we eat the word we become the word so if
[1:02:56] God can stand upon his own word if God
[1:02:58] is obligated to his own word if God will
[1:03:01] protect his own word when you eat the
[1:03:03] word you become the word then God is
[1:03:05] obligated to protect
[1:03:08] you that's not difficult the scripture
[1:03:11] says we are the word of God we are his
[1:03:14] thoughts Express so God is obligated to
[1:03:16] protect us to guide us to lead us in all
[1:03:19] things so the word of God to the
[1:03:21] believer is the complete absolute so
[1:03:24] when the word speaks you might as well
[1:03:26] close your windows close your doors
[1:03:29] close everything and just say God has
[1:03:31] already spoken I'm moving forward with
[1:03:33] that you don't need to hear another
[1:03:36] opinion you don't need to hear what
[1:03:37] another man says you don't need to hear
[1:03:40] another explanation when God has spoken
[1:03:42] you can move forward and know that God
[1:03:44] will bring his word to come to pass and
[1:03:47] that's what we need to have in our
[1:03:48] hearts today I come to church because I
[1:03:51] heard the word of God I come because
[1:03:53] I've been touched by the word of God
[1:03:55] don't be enticed by men's word men's
[1:03:58] word will only lead you AAR but God's
[1:04:00] word will bring you to his eternal
[1:04:02] salvation he will bring you the promise
[1:04:04] of God into your life so when we stand
[1:04:07] We Stand upon the word of God oh I enjoy
[1:04:10] what brother Ben was Beno was speaking
[1:04:12] about last Wednesday how that it's our
[1:04:15] own culture and and it's our own uh
[1:04:18] tradition that comes into the way of God
[1:04:21] why because we take the word of God we
[1:04:23] mix it with our tradition
[1:04:26] we mix it with our own understanding we
[1:04:29] we cause it to say something that God
[1:04:31] didn't say we cause it we in other word
[1:04:34] we make the word of God a non effect and
[1:04:36] why is that because man has no ability
[1:04:40] man is trying to produce something where
[1:04:43] God is wanting us to wait upon him what
[1:04:46] what is what is denomination is men that
[1:04:49] fails to wait upon God they've come up
[1:04:52] with their own explanation about things
[1:04:54] and they've filled up the buckets and
[1:04:56] they'll fill up all things and and God
[1:04:58] has no room every scripture has a
[1:05:00] meaning they know about it everything
[1:05:03] has a so there's no room for God to move
[1:05:05] no this is the Living Word of God this
[1:05:08] is the Eternal Word of God God is his
[1:05:11] own interpreter and he interprets it
[1:05:14] into your life daily let me say that
[1:05:17] daily the interpretation of yesterday
[1:05:20] may not be relevant for today it's
[1:05:22] according to what he wants to do today
[1:05:25] that's why the prophet will look at them
[1:05:27] Jesus looked at them and he says you
[1:05:29] claim to read the scripture in them you
[1:05:31] think you have you have eternal life if
[1:05:33] you really believe your Bible you would
[1:05:35] know who I am why because I am that
[1:05:38] which Moses spoke about I am that which
[1:05:41] Abraham spoke about when Abraham saw the
[1:05:44] same word when Abraham saw the word
[1:05:47] manifested in his day he believed it but
[1:05:49] you claim to be sons of Abraham yet the
[1:05:52] same word the same person of the word
[1:05:55] that stood before Abraham you are
[1:05:57] rejecting
[1:05:59] him so it's not what we claim to say is
[1:06:02] what the word says it's what we believe
[1:06:04] to know that the same word is being
[1:06:06] manifested so the word of God when he
[1:06:09] speaks all of the other opinions don't
[1:06:12] matter
[1:06:15] that's you you all you need is to hear
[1:06:18] what is God said what is really what is
[1:06:21] the Bible says I can come here and give
[1:06:24] you a bunch of explanation and that will
[1:06:26] do you no good that's why I love the
[1:06:28] leadership of our pastor we play tapes
[1:06:31] in our church why do we do that because
[1:06:33] we want everybody to know what's been
[1:06:35] spoken here is not a man's
[1:06:37] interpretation it's exactly what the
[1:06:40] prophet
[1:06:42] said so the word of God is a seed and we
[1:06:46] know the scripture tells us when a seed
[1:06:49] when God plant his seed is bound to
[1:06:51] produce exactly what God wants it to
[1:06:54] produce yes
[1:06:56] amen he said my word will not go out
[1:06:59] void and return void it will not go out
[1:07:02] and return void but it will bring that
[1:07:04] which I have purpos it to bring
[1:07:06] forth so I want to just for a moment
[1:07:09] this morning I'll try not to be
[1:07:12] long I I I just want to perhaps a
[1:07:15] strange subject and as you could tell my
[1:07:18] my inspiration came out of this message
[1:07:21] at Thy word I want to uh uh preach on
[1:07:24] changing the
[1:07:28] camera A View From Another
[1:07:32] camera and you don't understand but you
[1:07:35] will see where that came from as as we
[1:07:38] continue so the the prophet will will
[1:07:41] take out the scripture as we read in
[1:07:43] Luke and and it will say it must have
[1:07:47] been a a Monday because they had just
[1:07:50] gone people had gone to church and and
[1:07:53] usually Jesus will try to hold his
[1:07:55] meetings so he doesn't interfere with
[1:07:58] all the church services and and people
[1:08:01] he didn't want people to miss church he
[1:08:03] wanted them to go to their synagogue and
[1:08:05] go and and he he held his meetings in
[1:08:08] the all days and and so he would have
[1:08:10] them come on the Monday and he said he
[1:08:12] went down by by the the seashore and he
[1:08:16] this young preacher and there was just
[1:08:18] something about him as you preach as you
[1:08:20] begin to speak about the word of God and
[1:08:23] you can look at it when you really look
[1:08:25] at the ible you will understand he went
[1:08:27] by the seashore it wasn't a place where
[1:08:29] you'll find rich people and those that
[1:08:32] were well-doing and everything because
[1:08:34] the word of God never really came to
[1:08:36] them the word of God CES to those that
[1:08:38] are needy and those that are lacking and
[1:08:41] those that are hungry because those are
[1:08:43] the ones that really came to draw he
[1:08:46] wasn't looking for uh the great people
[1:08:49] but he came to the lordship of Israel
[1:08:51] we'll understand even as you read the
[1:08:53] prophet will tell us his own Ministry
[1:08:56] when he came he didn't come to those
[1:08:58] that were well and in fact the
[1:09:00] description is there was the uneducated
[1:09:02] people it was the cast down people it
[1:09:05] was those that with the stretchers and
[1:09:07] all with all kinds of ways and really
[1:09:10] the needy people that's whom the word of
[1:09:12] God came to so this young Minister will
[1:09:15] come and he will go by the seashore and
[1:09:18] he came and some will recognize him and
[1:09:21] he began to stand by the seashore and to
[1:09:23] to talk and and all of the sudden uh uh
[1:09:26] people begin to gather to hear what he
[1:09:28] had to say they will gather up and they
[1:09:31] will hear him speak and and they will
[1:09:33] gather up men and women like some that
[1:09:35] came from work some that were working
[1:09:37] they left what they were doing and they
[1:09:39] came they gather around and they begin
[1:09:41] to hear much of what he was to say and
[1:09:44] this gospel precious gospel began to
[1:09:47] come out of his mouth there was just
[1:09:48] something drawing about what he was
[1:09:50] saying just how he said a precious word
[1:09:54] was coming out of him and he would begin
[1:09:56] to preach and they will come and they
[1:09:58] will live what they were doing they
[1:09:59] begin to draw closer to him and he will
[1:10:02] come and he will begin to say the word
[1:10:04] of God in such a way that they never
[1:10:07] even heard it it will pierce their
[1:10:09] hearts the word of God will begin to do
[1:10:11] something into their hearts and they
[1:10:13] begin to hear it and something within
[1:10:15] their heart begin to leap and they
[1:10:17] wanted to hear more about what it was
[1:10:19] talking about he said you have been you
[1:10:21] have heard of this but yet I say unto
[1:10:24] you and you will began to preach the
[1:10:26] beatitude and all of those things and he
[1:10:28] began to to preach to to to the people
[1:10:31] that were gathered and all of the sudden
[1:10:33] the scripture will tell us that many
[1:10:35] more began to gather
[1:10:38] together many came and woman and
[1:10:41] children and all of them they begin to
[1:10:43] gather and as they were gathering the
[1:10:45] multitude he realized that at the shore
[1:10:48] he didn't have a place to stand anymore
[1:10:50] so what he will do is he saw this
[1:10:53] fishermen that came and they didn't have
[1:10:55] anything and they stood there and B will
[1:10:58] say uh perhaps they looked at him they
[1:11:00] said well we went and we tried to cut
[1:11:02] fish we didn't get
[1:11:04] anything but there's this young Rabbi
[1:11:06] over there preaching let's just go
[1:11:08] listen to him for a moment and as they
[1:11:10] came and said the word be to draw them
[1:11:14] it began to pull upon them let me say
[1:11:17] this every son and the daughter of God
[1:11:19] is pulled is draw by the word of God
[1:11:22] when we hear the word of God there is
[1:11:25] connection that happens there's
[1:11:27] something within our hearts that wants
[1:11:30] us for us to become what we are hearing
[1:11:32] there's something about what's been
[1:11:34] spoken that answers to the needs of our
[1:11:36] heart you're here perhaps you came here
[1:11:39] this morning I don't know what your
[1:11:41] situation is but I want to say this this
[1:11:43] morning if you hear the word of God this
[1:11:45] morning the word of God has the answer
[1:11:47] of what you are looking for so he came
[1:11:50] and and and he he he took the the the
[1:11:53] boat and he took the Sheep and and he he
[1:11:56] he he pushed it a little bit so he can
[1:11:59] stand on a little bit away from the
[1:12:01] shore and he began to preach and he
[1:12:03] began to preach and and they were there
[1:12:06] the children believing and wanting to
[1:12:08] hear they were pressing to hear his
[1:12:10] voice and pressing to hear what he that
[1:12:12] he had to say they were looking for that
[1:12:15] what he was what what was it that what
[1:12:17] message did he bring it to them and what
[1:12:20] good was that message to
[1:12:22] them they didn't were not just
[1:12:24] interested oh because it was a man
[1:12:26] speaking but what he was saying had
[1:12:29] something to do with what they were
[1:12:31] going through into their lives what he
[1:12:33] was saying has an answer had an answer
[1:12:36] to what challenge they were facing what
[1:12:38] he came to do when he was preaching his
[1:12:41] way of preaching his style of preaching
[1:12:44] for some reason had the answer for the
[1:12:46] problems of man he knew just how to
[1:12:49] tackle every need that every person had
[1:12:51] he just knew how to position his word
[1:12:53] perfectly he just knew how to say
[1:12:56] something and and it will be the end of
[1:12:58] it and it will take away the questions
[1:13:00] that was filled into the hearts of
[1:13:02] people and B will say this and he said
[1:13:06] uh this is in the message at TI word
[1:13:09] preaching 0608 paragraph 15 it says and
[1:13:14] and then it says now let's change the
[1:13:17] camera just a
[1:13:21] moment if you can put it up let's change
[1:13:24] the camera for just a moment in our
[1:13:27] minds it says look sitting down sitting
[1:13:31] there on the stump and old chunk hold
[1:13:35] the side of the seashore see Peter
[1:13:38] sitting up there and James and and John
[1:13:41] and Sons of zebede sitting up there it
[1:13:44] says had fish all night discouraged and
[1:13:48] any and any and any of you fishermen
[1:13:51] knows that there were that uh what it
[1:13:54] was to fish all night and don't catch
[1:13:56] nothing that's really discouraging so
[1:13:59] they washed out the Nets and and hang
[1:14:02] them up to dry and and it says and there
[1:14:06] were and and there there was sitting on
[1:14:09] the stump and some of them said well
[1:14:12] here comes this guy that preaches he
[1:14:14] says let's see what he has what's going
[1:14:17] on what he's going to say it says I can
[1:14:19] see the old
[1:14:21] Apostle get the chunk and and sit down
[1:14:24] and and and he says and after a while he
[1:14:27] began to listen and said there's
[1:14:30] something a little different about this
[1:14:32] that fellow he says moving his chunk it
[1:14:35] saids just a little bit closer and after
[1:14:38] a while he's standing right up against
[1:14:41] him oh I love that he will call you just
[1:14:45] little by little it's it's never a one
[1:14:48] time where you just come and out no he's
[1:14:50] pulling you in fact let me say this you
[1:14:53] will get so close you wouldn't even know
[1:14:55] know that you got so close he will draw
[1:14:57] you in a manner that's unbelievable to
[1:15:00] your own thinking he will draw you to
[1:15:02] where you don't know how how did I get
[1:15:05] here why how did I believe this message
[1:15:08] how did I come to believe him I don't
[1:15:10] understand it but what he's the one
[1:15:12] doing the
[1:15:13] drawing let me say this when we come our
[1:15:16] own way that's how we fail because what
[1:15:19] happens is we build our own reputation
[1:15:21] and we got this expose that we talked
[1:15:24] about ourselves and how we looked at the
[1:15:26] message and everything but if it's him
[1:15:28] doing the drawing you will always be
[1:15:30] grateful you'll always say Lord I don't
[1:15:33] know how I got here I don't know what
[1:15:35] but you draw me to this
[1:15:39] message so he said right up against him
[1:15:42] it says there's something about him that
[1:15:44] draws men to him it it says he still got
[1:15:48] the the same power and if you'll be
[1:15:50] lifted up he'll draw man unto him let me
[1:15:53] say this this morning you perhaps came
[1:15:56] to church just like Peter all
[1:15:59] discouraged up and all you know you know
[1:16:03] now remember this is what they made the
[1:16:05] living out of they they were fishermen
[1:16:08] so they they were paid by what they
[1:16:11] would take and go sell out and and go
[1:16:13] sell to the people and perhaps they were
[1:16:15] in debt and they had things that they
[1:16:17] had to do and they had families to feed
[1:16:19] and all of those things so they were
[1:16:21] counting on the fact that they will go
[1:16:23] and catch fish and go sell it so they
[1:16:25] can make it living so yeah they are
[1:16:28] discouraged perhaps sitting there when
[1:16:30] they came into service that morning
[1:16:32] perhaps on their mind that were thinking
[1:16:34] how am I going to take care of that bill
[1:16:36] how am I going to pay the rent tonight
[1:16:38] how am I going to do this and they had
[1:16:40] all those question let me say this the
[1:16:42] questions and the problems of men are
[1:16:45] the same and that hasn't changed and let
[1:16:47] me say this God also has not changed
[1:16:50] it's the same every time if God took the
[1:16:54] the cares and the needs of men in the
[1:16:56] past he the same God here today this
[1:16:58] morning taking care of the needs of
[1:17:01] people let's not kid ourselves let's not
[1:17:05] think that your problem is greater than
[1:17:07] anybody in the history in fact we can
[1:17:09] bring out problems that you never heard
[1:17:11] of and then and then they sit there and
[1:17:13] they heard the word it was by the
[1:17:16] hearing of the word of God that they got
[1:17:18] the solution to what they were looking
[1:17:20] for and this morning whatever problem
[1:17:23] you have let me say this let not Satan
[1:17:25] lie to you that you can go work harder
[1:17:28] so you can get a solution that you can
[1:17:30] go do more so you can get a solution
[1:17:32] come to the master this morning hear the
[1:17:35] word of the master this morning and let
[1:17:37] him bring you a solution to your
[1:17:41] problem and so it says regardless of
[1:17:45] what was going on it never stopped them
[1:17:47] from listening to the word of God they
[1:17:50] came anyhow to hear the word of God and
[1:17:53] so oh I love love this and after he's
[1:17:56] done preaching now it's time he looks at
[1:18:00] them and the scripture says he just come
[1:18:03] and after he done and he took Peter's
[1:18:06] boat the in four verse four it says when
[1:18:09] he had left speaking he said unto his
[1:18:12] Simon Peter said launch out in the
[1:18:16] deep and let down your net for the
[1:18:20] drop and Simon answered unto him and he
[1:18:22] said said unto him it said Master we
[1:18:27] have toiled all night and have taken
[1:18:31] nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will
[1:18:36] let down the net but my sister that's
[1:18:39] the answer to all men's problem this
[1:18:42] morning the let and let me just set it
[1:18:45] up for you these people were fishermen
[1:18:48] from when they were kids these people
[1:18:51] they that's what they they grew up on
[1:18:52] the F on the shore and they grew up
[1:18:55] their lifestyle that that's what they
[1:18:57] did day in and day out they knew but
[1:18:59] what I'm says they knew just how to look
[1:19:01] at the Moon and no when it's time to
[1:19:03] fish or not time to fish in other words
[1:19:06] when it was time to fish they knew this
[1:19:08] is the time to go they knew everything
[1:19:11] about all that there is about fishing
[1:19:13] what kind of nature use what kind of
[1:19:15] boat what direction should I be coming
[1:19:17] they were experting what they were doing
[1:19:20] and as Peter is speaking let me say this
[1:19:22] to the world it looks like it could have
[1:19:24] been been an
[1:19:25] embarrassment it looks like something
[1:19:27] was about to go terribly wrong for this
[1:19:30] young Master always preaching and it
[1:19:32] says perhaps some looked in in their
[1:19:34] heart they said well we just looked at
[1:19:36] we we we went we just came back and we
[1:19:39] are washing our Nets this is going to be
[1:19:40] such an embarrassment but he says
[1:19:42] nevertheless a tie word we will do what
[1:19:45] you want us to do and what did he do he
[1:19:47] launched out he went out to do according
[1:19:50] to the word of God what was the
[1:19:52] difference when they went out before
[1:19:54] they went by themselves but when they
[1:19:56] went the second time they went with the
[1:19:59] word of
[1:20:01] God the word of God will make the
[1:20:04] difference the word of God will defeat
[1:20:06] the Devil any place any time under any
[1:20:11] circumstances the word of God will bring
[1:20:13] fish where there's no fish the word of
[1:20:15] God will create when there's nothing the
[1:20:18] word of God will bring into existence
[1:20:20] where doesn't exist
[1:20:25] what made the difference at Thy word I
[1:20:28] will stand here at Thy word I will come
[1:20:31] to church at Thy word I will worship you
[1:20:34] at Thy word I will do just because you
[1:20:37] said I'll do that I will give myself
[1:20:40] just because you said to do that and
[1:20:42] when you stand upon his word let me say
[1:20:45] this when you stand upon God's word you
[1:20:48] are shifting the
[1:20:50] responsibility from you to God yes
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:21:01] when you are taking God as his word you
[1:21:04] are saying I'm no longer responsible for
[1:21:08] the outcome come on I no longer
[1:21:10] responsible for the shame I'm no longer
[1:21:13] responsible for what's about to happen
[1:21:16] right now I'm standing on God's word and
[1:21:18] he is responsible for his own word
[1:21:25] we we are scared of the shame we are
[1:21:28] scared of the exposure letting me expose
[1:21:32] let it be exposed let me say this for
[1:21:35] the one says this there's one thing that
[1:21:37] God cannot do and that is to
[1:21:40] [Applause]
[1:21:42] fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[1:21:45] my word will never pass away when you
[1:21:47] stand upon God's word you are standing
[1:21:50] on the Eternal yes sir whatever will
[1:21:53] never pass away you are standing on God
[1:22:01] himself he says this in paragraph 18 and
[1:22:04] it says in other word I can hear Peter
[1:22:07] say oh I love this I love how the
[1:22:10] prophet just goes and get into all the
[1:22:13] minds and and he Paints the scenery for
[1:22:15] you in a manner that's never seen before
[1:22:19] and said I could hear Peter say well
[1:22:21] Lord it says why I'm a fisherman it says
[1:22:26] we was born and raised by the Sea my
[1:22:30] goodness that's his reputation I was
[1:22:32] born and raised by the sea I know the
[1:22:35] sea well and it says why it says we know
[1:22:38] when there's a moon when the moon is
[1:22:41] Right excuse me we know when the moon is
[1:22:45] is right and then it says when all the
[1:22:47] signs are right there's not even a fish
[1:22:50] in the water it says well we told all
[1:22:53] night it says we all all night long and
[1:22:56] we know when when the signs are right it
[1:23:00] says and we never even took one fish
[1:23:03] this is when the signs were right we
[1:23:05] took nothing and then you come around
[1:23:08] and tell me to go back in in some water
[1:23:12] where there's been when when we've been
[1:23:15] uh see uh uh sinning it says and let
[1:23:18] down to get the whole boat full of them
[1:23:21] it says why it couldn't be now now
[1:23:24] listen to what he says if we had had
[1:23:26] said that then he wouldn't have got
[1:23:31] them but he said Lord I toil all night I
[1:23:36] have taken nothing but nevertheless at
[1:23:39] Thy word I'm going to let down the net
[1:23:43] it says there you are there's the secret
[1:23:47] there's the secret to Christian Living
[1:23:50] there is the secret to your overcoming
[1:23:52] there is the secret to your vict ictory
[1:23:55] there's the secret to overcoming the
[1:23:57] things of the world there's the secret
[1:23:59] to everything that you have need of it
[1:24:02] says take God at his
[1:24:04] word now listen to this if there's no
[1:24:08] fish there God is able to put fish in
[1:24:12] there I like that I love that kind of
[1:24:16] God I love that kind of God I can serve
[1:24:19] that kind of God he's a creator of all
[1:24:22] things and then it says if if he did not
[1:24:25] if if he did not do it the same net that
[1:24:28] went through the water that went through
[1:24:31] that water all night on caught nothing
[1:24:34] but when God said put down there there
[1:24:38] was fish in there and let me say this
[1:24:40] it's the same net it's the same people
[1:24:44] it was the same condition it was the
[1:24:46] same everything science said it wouldn't
[1:24:48] happen but the difference is they went

[1:28:47] sea open up I don't care what the
[1:28:49] challenge is it's the same God today if
[1:28:53] it's not the same God then we are
[1:28:55] wasting our time but he promise you'll
[1:28:57] be the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:00] if he doesn't do what he did yesterday
[1:29:02] then we are here for nothing but I know
[1:29:04] about the scripture and by the word of
[1:29:06] God that is here to do the same
[1:29:12] thing ask a whole
[1:29:16] lot you have not because you ask not and
[1:29:20] you have not you have and you you ask
[1:29:22] not because you believe not
[1:29:24] that's right it says ask when you and it
[1:29:28] says you shall receive seek you shall it
[1:29:31] shall you shall find knock and it it'll
[1:29:34] be open and it'll be open it says that's
[1:29:38] God's word it says now let's we'll we'll
[1:29:42] we'll go down for the drought it says
[1:29:45] and I can see the old
[1:29:47] Apostle I love this I can see the old
[1:29:50] Apostle running the big scene out there
[1:29:54] in the water getting ready and then it
[1:29:57] says when he began to pull on the net it
[1:30:02] says Made couple of pulls and there was
[1:30:06] nothing he pulled his said well yeah
[1:30:09] there you go I I told you it was nothing
[1:30:11] but then it says but after sometime
[1:30:14] began after a while something began to
[1:30:17] tug it says begin to take a hold let it
[1:30:21] says just let let it it says just let
[1:30:24] down one time he says just let down one
[1:30:27] time and try the little effort that you
[1:30:29] might not feel much he says the second
[1:30:32] little effort that you might not that
[1:30:34] you might you might not it says may go
[1:30:37] several effort but after a while you
[1:30:40] feel a tug something caught a hold
[1:30:44] something has got something something is
[1:30:47] on the other end of the line let me say
[1:30:49] this people don't believe God exists
[1:30:52] because they haven't pulled long enough
[1:30:54] people don't believe this message is
[1:30:56] true because they haven't been around
[1:30:58] long enough if you come in with a doubt
[1:31:01] at the end only your doubt is going to
[1:31:03] be manifested God is looking for people
[1:31:06] that are ready to just keep going they
[1:31:09] have given their lives and they know
[1:31:11] it's God or nothing they they will stand
[1:31:14] there until it happens don't keep
[1:31:16] pulling If Abraham had to pull for 25
[1:31:19] years how much longer do we have to pull
[1:31:21] we'll pull until it happens yes you want
[1:31:25] to know the reality of this message you
[1:31:28] stay in it you eat it you drink it God
[1:31:31] will make it a reality to
[1:31:33] [Applause]
[1:31:38] you we read one or two books and all of
[1:31:41] the sudden oh I you know I don't really
[1:31:44] see how this is going to happen well you
[1:31:47] looking from the wrong camera that's
[1:31:50] your own camera how about this other
[1:31:52] camera what is it saying on the other
[1:31:54] camera this camera is a Heavenly camera
[1:31:58] this camera is there to give you
[1:32:00] heavenly vision about your life this
[1:32:03] camera tells you you continue to pull
[1:32:05] you may pull one time you got nothing
[1:32:08] you may pull two times you got nothing
[1:32:10] you may come and be prayed for you feel
[1:32:12] nothing but you keep pulling you keep
[1:32:15] pulling God will make his word come true
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:27] he said this oh I love this it said he
[1:32:32] launched
[1:32:34] out
[1:32:35] and this is where it really I have to
[1:32:39] just speak to my own self and say let's
[1:32:42] not be afraid to cast down to cast out
[1:32:45] at the word of God to launch out because
[1:32:48] Faith what the faith in the word of God
[1:32:52] requires you to go with no support of
[1:32:55] any
[1:32:57] man faith in the word of God requires
[1:33:01] that you testify for something before
[1:33:04] you can even receive
[1:33:06] it faith in the word of God requires
[1:33:09] that you claim The Possession while it's
[1:33:12] yet coming along the way faith in the
[1:33:15] word of God is the requirement that we
[1:33:18] have to stand upon what he said
[1:33:20] regardless of all the symptoms that's
[1:33:22] piling up
[1:33:25] so he's saying we got to launch out
[1:33:28] whatever you have need of let's get into
[1:33:30] the habit of launching out let's get
[1:33:33] into the habit of claiming it let's get
[1:33:35] into the habit of going let me say this
[1:33:38] perhaps this morning in your camera all
[1:33:42] you see is failings oh I did this wrong
[1:33:45] and I failed again and man I I I woke up
[1:33:50] again I did the same thing I don't know
[1:33:52] how long this business of the word it
[1:33:55] seems like it's just not producing what
[1:33:56] it says it will
[1:33:58] produce that's your
[1:34:00] camera maybe your camera this morning is
[1:34:03] I've been struggling with this forever I
[1:34:06] don't know how I'm ever going to
[1:34:08] overcome this that's your camera so the
[1:34:11] difference between God's camera and your
[1:34:13] camera is you're doing all the viewing
[1:34:16] come on you're doing all the Talking you
[1:34:19] doing all the examination but the
[1:34:22] difference is in G's camera he does all
[1:34:24] the Talking let me say this if you will
[1:34:27] stay long enough to hear what he has to
[1:34:29] say not what you have to say not what
[1:34:32] you understand about the circumstance
[1:34:35] your your circumstance is your own
[1:34:37] that's wonderful but let's hear what he
[1:34:39] has to say ask him what are you seeing
[1:34:42] from your side of the camera from the
[1:34:44] camera that you're seeing how what are
[1:34:45] you seeing about my life let him bring
[1:34:48] his vision to become your
[1:34:51] vision Wonder but about I'm say
[1:34:54] oh I like I would speak of that for a
[1:34:58] while launch out that's the trouble with
[1:35:01] people face tonight they are afraid to
[1:35:03] turn loose there are many of that's got
[1:35:06] faith but they are afraid to turn it
[1:35:08] loose it says faith without works is
[1:35:15] dead now we can go in a whole new
[1:35:19] Direction right now faith without works
[1:35:22] is dead
[1:35:24] God doesn't want us to be a people that
[1:35:27] just says we believe but there's no
[1:35:30] actions attached to it we know but one
[1:35:32] him Express he explained what that means
[1:35:36] it says uh speaking of a Paul and it
[1:35:39] speaks about them speaking about Abraham
[1:35:41] how that one was God's view and the
[1:35:43] other was man's view that the one has to
[1:35:46] be seen it was the faith that was seen
[1:35:48] in Abraham by God but yet when uh when
[1:35:51] when the other was talking about it was
[1:35:52] what men saw from from Abraham so what
[1:35:54] we are trying to do with our life is to
[1:35:57] line up what God sees with what man sees
[1:36:01] together so the and and the expression
[1:36:05] is not us claiming something that we are
[1:36:08] not it's us standing on the promise of
[1:36:11] what God Said and expect him to come to
[1:36:14] bring the promise to come to pass so
[1:36:17] when we are speaking about faith without
[1:36:19] expression in other word if I believe
[1:36:21] I'm Healed then I have to act doubt that
[1:36:24] I'm Healed then I have to confess that
[1:36:26] I'm Healed then I have to testify that
[1:36:28] I'm Healed then it's my business to make
[1:36:30] sure that I don't have a negative
[1:36:32] testimony regardless of the symptoms
[1:36:34] that's presenting before me it's my
[1:36:36] obligation to keep reciting the word of
[1:36:39] God to keep reciting the promise of God
[1:36:42] oh but it's God's obligation to come to
[1:36:45] his word and say that you have believed
[1:36:48] long enough you have stood upon my word
[1:36:50] long enough now it's my business to make
[1:36:53] it a reality to
[1:36:56] you he says without faith uh faith
[1:36:59] without works is dead it says that's the
[1:37:02] all that's it says just the body without
[1:37:05] the spirit is De if you've got faith it
[1:37:08] says if you've got faith show me your
[1:37:11] faith by your Works a little bit further
[1:37:14] down he goes in he says that's what's
[1:37:16] the matter with people today in the
[1:37:18] world many of them have faith it says
[1:37:21] they are afraid to launch out
[1:37:24] with it it says they're just afraid to
[1:37:27] venture a little
[1:37:32] bit they want the
[1:37:34] action they want to see God move before
[1:37:37] they can
[1:37:39] move they want to
[1:37:41] see they want to
[1:37:43] move until they get the
[1:37:46] feeling until they get some tingling no
[1:37:50] God didn't say that in fact is the high
[1:37:53] priest of your confession he wants you
[1:37:55] to confess first so he can have
[1:37:58] something he can go with the formula is
[1:38:01] I will stand here I'm going to testify
[1:38:04] to the whole world I'm a Christian I'm
[1:38:06] going to testify that God saved me I'm
[1:38:09] going to testify that God heals me he's
[1:38:11] going to bring it to come to
[1:38:15] pass just a little bit just to say well
[1:38:19] it says I can do all things through
[1:38:21] Christ that strengthen me it says look
[1:38:23] at me says launch out into the deep let
[1:38:26] down it says let down for the Dr and I
[1:38:29] want to say this God wants us to live by
[1:38:32] his word God wants us to stand by his
[1:38:35] word he says in the message the
[1:38:37] testimony of the raised dead boy he says
[1:38:40] paragraph 22 he says I like this it says
[1:38:43] oh I tell you this it says the most
[1:38:46] marvelous things that I've ever seen in
[1:38:48] my life is the greatest hour of my life
[1:38:52] is it says when when I get up against
[1:38:55] the wall it says I can't it says and I
[1:38:58] can't go over it under it or around it
[1:39:01] it says that's right I trust it says
[1:39:04] then I trust in God and he opens the way
[1:39:09] he opens the way and I go through the
[1:39:12] thing God takes you through it it says
[1:39:15] that's when when you come out on the
[1:39:18] other side it says it's like Samson when
[1:39:22] he killed the L lion it says when he got
[1:39:25] out on the other side when he killed the
[1:39:27] lion he got the sweetest honey that he's
[1:39:30] ever gotten that he ever eaten out of
[1:39:32] the old carcass of the lion and when
[1:39:34] something it says and the same time at
[1:39:37] the some time if you if you will
[1:39:39] overcome something by the grace of God
[1:39:41] it'll be one of the sweetest thing that
[1:39:44] you will ever taste in your
[1:39:50] life it's
[1:39:52] sweetness to walk with God the the I I
[1:39:56] was telling young people one time and I
[1:39:58] was telling them and and all of the
[1:40:00] sudden I asked the testimony I was
[1:40:01] telling him was 20 years old I believe
[1:40:03] and I looked at him and I said how many
[1:40:05] are 20 years old and you know over 20 so
[1:40:07] you like and and when God does something
[1:40:10] for you it lasts forever it's it's as as
[1:40:13] though it happened just today or the day
[1:40:15] before you you never go across it and it
[1:40:18] becomes old no it's always new every
[1:40:21] morning why because you know the same
[1:40:23] God who did yesterday he's here to do
[1:40:25] today the same God who did the other
[1:40:27] time he's here to do today oh I like
[1:40:29] this and B makes this statement it says
[1:40:32] it says when man extremity when man gets
[1:40:37] to his extremity it's an opportunity for
[1:40:41] God man's extremity is God's opportunity
[1:40:47] when you come to your width ends when
[1:40:49] you've done all that you can and it
[1:40:51] doesn't work when you've done all you
[1:40:54] tried and you try this you try this but
[1:40:57] says that's an opportunity for God to
[1:40:59] come and work it
[1:41:01] out the question is are we taking use of
[1:41:05] the
[1:41:08] opportunity are we actually making use
[1:41:11] of the opportunity you say I'm weak this
[1:41:14] morning wonderful that's God's
[1:41:17] opportunity to make you
[1:41:20] stronger you said I like the Holy Ghost
[1:41:22] this morning wonderful don't look at it
[1:41:25] as and oh I'm being despised and I'm
[1:41:27] lacking and everybody's got it let me
[1:41:30] tell you you'll find out most people
[1:41:32] don't got what they're talking
[1:41:36] about what we need is to to remove this
[1:41:40] myth about oh I I'm I'm this I'm that no
[1:41:43] it's you and God yes the relationship is
[1:41:46] not you and the church and God no it's
[1:41:49] you and God we are gathered here as
[1:41:52] Believers with each one with a
[1:41:54] relationship directly with
[1:41:57] God and the way God deals with you it's
[1:41:59] not necessarily how he deals with the
[1:42:01] other so what we want to do is to make
[1:42:04] our relationship personal and not let it
[1:42:06] go through somebody
[1:42:08] else if somebody else is on fire and I'm
[1:42:11] not made to be that way that's wonderful
[1:42:14] you just be what God made
[1:42:17] you you don't try to do whatever oh
[1:42:20] because over there they do this and they
[1:42:22] jump we got to jump we got to do no then
[1:42:25] you lost you don't know who's leading
[1:42:27] you when he's leading you let him do the
[1:42:29] leading let him do the showing let him
[1:42:32] do the revealing let him do the guiding
[1:42:35] let him do
[1:42:36] everything let me say this your weakness
[1:42:39] or your lacking is his
[1:42:46] opportunity if you sick this morning I
[1:42:49] couldn't tell you how much God wants to
[1:42:51] heal you this morning we can speak about
[1:42:53] it today till the end of time and it
[1:42:55] will still not be
[1:42:58] enough he's made it such that when we
[1:43:02] are lacking it's his business to feel
[1:43:05] the lacking we said last Sunday night
[1:43:08] that God wants us to depend on him I and
[1:43:12] I want to say this if you want to repeat
[1:43:14] that scripture for yourself every day do
[1:43:16] it because it's going to be very helpful
[1:43:19] because it's going to help you when you
[1:43:20] go and you hit the wall it's going to
[1:43:22] help you you when you fail yourself all
[1:43:24] you have to know is God wants to help me
[1:43:27] more than I want to help myself he wants
[1:43:30] me to walk by him he wants me to live by
[1:43:32] him he wants to challenge my achievement
[1:43:36] he wants me to do it with
[1:43:50] him so now
[1:43:58] I'm running out of
[1:44:01] time we could turn again the
[1:44:07] camera in one of this meetings that
[1:44:10] Jesus was
[1:44:16] having and we
[1:44:19] see a little boy
[1:44:23] come around the meeting with Five Loaves
[1:44:26] and two little of
[1:44:30] fish how it came about
[1:44:32] and and forgive me I don't mean to
[1:44:35] offend anybody but perhaps Jesus was
[1:44:38] preaching and and they realized time
[1:44:41] went out and people didn't eat and
[1:44:44] perhaps even as our messenger we realize
[1:44:47] oh he's gone over time you know they
[1:44:49] were renting a place and realized it
[1:44:51] says we'll just take the money and pay
[1:44:53] for the overtime and and just take care
[1:44:55] of that business because he didn't
[1:44:57] preach the gospel for money so here's
[1:44:59] Jesus is preaching and he realizes that
[1:45:02] people are hungry the the real disciple
[1:45:04] comes and say what are we going to do
[1:45:05] they're hungry and everything and so
[1:45:07] they said well can we go buy and this is
[1:45:10] one angle One camera can we go buy who
[1:45:13] can we go well there's a market over
[1:45:15] there there's another one over there but
[1:45:17] the time they already closed at this
[1:45:19] time we wouldn't be able to do but even
[1:45:21] if we go we'll need a lot of people to
[1:45:23] carry enough to feed all of these
[1:45:27] people from this side of camera where he
[1:45:29] was preaching he realized that there was
[1:45:31] a
[1:45:32] need so he asked they said is there
[1:45:35] anything at all that we have in here
[1:45:36] they said they looked around and
[1:45:38] everything and they find this boy with
[1:45:40] five love and two little fish and it
[1:45:43] says okay bring it they bring it he
[1:45:47] takes it and He blesses it and all of
[1:45:51] the sudden they able to feed 5,000
[1:45:56] so over on one side it's completely
[1:46:00] impossible it's completely unscientific
[1:46:04] as the prophet will say it doesn't match
[1:46:06] any record there's nothing that you
[1:46:09] could say this is possible
[1:46:12] science-based but on the other side it's
[1:46:16] possible all things are possible and let
[1:46:18] me just read the statement how bham says
[1:46:20] it he says I can imagine he says this
[1:46:23] it says it says the drama this is
[1:46:26] paragraph 27 and I can imagine see the
[1:46:28] drama how they draw the mind and
[1:46:30] everything
[1:46:36] um and the little boy he said he wasn't
[1:46:39] it wasn't very much he could hardly fit
[1:46:41] himself with that he says but
[1:46:44] once paragraph 27 but once what was in
[1:46:49] his what what what he had had given had
[1:46:53] gave to Jesus Jesus fed
[1:46:56] 5,000 it says you may not have much but
[1:47:01] turn it loose once yes sir let him have
[1:47:05] it what you got sir you if you have if
[1:47:09] you've got if you haven't if you got
[1:47:11] much Faith put it in him turn it loose
[1:47:15] see what he will do as long as it's in
[1:47:18] is it in your it's it is in his hand as
[1:47:22] long as it it it's in his hand it wasn't
[1:47:26] much but when it got in in here Jesus
[1:47:31] hands it meant something so when it's in
[1:47:35] your hand it doesn't mean much it can't
[1:47:37] do much but when it comes to Jesus hands
[1:47:39] it means something it says it would only
[1:47:44] f it only feed him here but it's it's
[1:47:48] hardly could do that but he fed F he fed
[1:47:51] 5,000 taken up the basket full
[1:47:54] afterwards Hallelujah he says why when I
[1:47:57] think of that my soul shakes and
[1:48:00] trembles that God in God at his word he
[1:48:04] says he said he said cause them all that
[1:48:07] sat down and I can see him look down the
[1:48:11] little boy and said Do you believe I can
[1:48:13] do it he says that's what I'm that
[1:48:15] that's what he's trying to find tonight
[1:48:17] somebody with a childlike Faith who
[1:48:21] would stand by and say Jesus I believe
[1:48:24] you can do
[1:48:27] this is not wanting us to grow up to
[1:48:30] where we understand everything no with
[1:48:33] to childlike friend said father I my my
[1:48:35] faith is very small right
[1:48:40] now and he said okay father in fact I
[1:48:44] don't even have anything right now if
[1:48:47] you don't have anything just hear the
[1:48:48] word the word creates faith and God
[1:48:52] comes and moves upon Faith because we
[1:48:54] understand without faith it's impossible
[1:48:56] to please God he says he says this he
[1:49:01] says and then he says Jesus I Believe I
[1:49:04] Can Do I can do it it says if he can get
[1:49:08] somebody to do that he will do it but if
[1:49:12] you are back off and say I don't know
[1:49:15] I'm just afraid it says I know I know I
[1:49:19] I I know I believe you it says he can't
[1:49:21] use it
[1:49:23] if anything is helpless it says a
[1:49:26] spineless person who claims to be a
[1:49:29] Christian and afraid to stand to stand
[1:49:32] on conviction God don't want cowards
[1:49:34] like that he can't use them it says like
[1:49:38] all body Robinson I says I used to like
[1:49:42] was re I used to like was reading his
[1:49:45] book and he says he was quite a man he
[1:49:48] says Lord give me the backbone the size
[1:49:51] of a solo
[1:49:53] and give me plenty of knowledge in in
[1:49:55] the
[1:49:56] gble plenty of knowledge in the gble and
[1:50:00] of my soul and let me fight the devil as
[1:50:03] long as I got a tooth in my mouth he
[1:50:05] says then G him till I
[1:50:10] die hallu G him till I die that's the
[1:50:14] kind of faith and determination we need
[1:50:16] somebody who will do something at TH
[1:50:19] word Lord at TH word at TH word word
[1:50:23] Lord whatever things you are asking ask
[1:50:26] in my name and I will do it oh God is
[1:50:29] not looking for us to back up he wants
[1:50:31] us to move forward God's Army that's in
[1:50:34] Retreat he move forward God's army goes
[1:50:37] and take Victory God's Army knows that
[1:50:40] whatever weapon we have in our hands
[1:50:42] it's given for us to overcome
[1:50:48] with he talks about en closing
[1:50:55] about the Hebrews
[1:50:57] children oh I like
[1:51:01] this yeah they are the king gives an
[1:51:04] order whoever that's un B to the Statue
[1:51:08] will be
[1:51:09] executed will
[1:51:11] die now they come and they consulted
[1:51:15] with one another and they came and they
[1:51:18] said what are we going to do f it and
[1:51:21] then this said our God is able to
[1:51:25] Deliver Us from this Fierce furnace but
[1:51:30] nevertheless if he doesn't do it will
[1:51:33] not bow to
[1:51:35] you I like that
[1:51:40] determination but what says the
[1:51:42] Christian has to be the most determined
[1:51:44] person that they ever was the most
[1:51:46] persevering person there has to be on
[1:51:49] this planet is a believer
[1:51:52] I don't care how Satan will turn it
[1:51:55] around I don't care how much it will hit
[1:51:57] it up if we are believers We Believe
[1:52:00] till we die if we are believers we know
[1:52:03] that our God is greater than Satan Our
[1:52:06] God will change the circumstance at any
[1:52:09] time if God wants us to die we'll die by
[1:52:12] the word but when our God has spoken we
[1:52:15] can never go against it we will stand
[1:52:17] there till we
[1:52:19] die oh he began to speak and oh I like
[1:52:23] this I said oh perhaps when they say
[1:52:26] that in Heaven There was a
[1:52:28] commotion I love it he said I want you
[1:52:32] to have a view paragraph 32 he said it
[1:52:36] said when they said that they stood
[1:52:39] there they stood there and then it says
[1:52:42] uh paragraph 32 on that same message at
[1:52:44] that word it said right up and then it
[1:52:47] says they began to stagger the intense
[1:52:50] heat coming forth and and and coming
[1:52:52] close and then it says and one more step
[1:52:56] they were going into there it says look
[1:52:58] like the black picture of for a Believer
[1:53:01] doesn't it it says let's turn our camera

[1:53:10] something going on down there it says
[1:53:12] there's something going on up there too

[1:53:17] something going on into your life

[1:53:22] the Earth is only a reflection of what's
[1:53:25] happening in heaven if you ever want
[1:53:28] heaven to come for you if you ever want

[1:53:38] God at his word whatever is happening

[1:57:39] reality oh my brother my sister let's
[1:57:42] not cast down the things let's not fail
[1:57:45] to realize in whose presence we are
[1:57:47] standing let's not let's not forget
[1:57:50] whose words have we believed this is not
[1:57:52] the words of man this is the words of
[1:57:57] God let's all stand this
[1:58:05] morning he will do a mansiz job this
[1:58:10] morning he's ready to do it all that
[1:58:13] he's asking for
[1:58:15] us what are you standing
[1:58:18] upon what are you acting upon are you
[1:58:21] act acting upon his word or are you
[1:58:24] acting upon your own understanding
[1:58:27] remember I said if we ever want this
[1:58:30] message to become a
[1:58:32] reality we just need to stand upon his
[1:58:35] word the problem the trouble is we have
[1:58:38] so many other Escape Route that the
[1:58:41] devil is offering well if it doesn't
[1:58:43] work you can do this if this doesn't
[1:58:45] work you can do this I don't want to do
[1:58:48] anything if it requires death I'm ready
[1:58:51] to die
[1:58:52] that's what those boys said if it
[1:58:55] requires death because I stood upon
[1:58:57] God's word let it be if it doesn't come
[1:59:00] that's wonderful but I'm standing on
[1:59:02] God's word and then because they did
[1:59:05] that they caused a maniz job to come out
[1:59:10] of the Heaven's camera something begin
[1:59:13] to transpire they begin to look God said
[1:59:16] no I'm not going to you know God wants
[1:59:20] us to put him to work right
[1:59:23] he he wants to see his children call

[2:00:01] God if we will stand upon his word how
[2:00:05] much more are we invoking out of him

[2:00:11] to the ground the scripture says God
[2:00:13] will make every word the truth God will
[2:00:16] take the least amount of word the most
[2:00:19] amount of word and make it the truth
