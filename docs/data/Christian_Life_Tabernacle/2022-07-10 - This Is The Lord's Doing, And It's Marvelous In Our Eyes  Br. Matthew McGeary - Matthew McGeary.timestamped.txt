[11:51] of divine nature and be changed from day
[11:54] to day in the image of the perfect son

[12:00] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[12:02] pray amen
[12:04] amen god bless you may have your seats
[12:06] this morning
[12:07] amen
[12:09] amen
[12:10] amen as you well know but
[12:12] jackson and sister laura will be moving
[12:15] away so certainly
[12:18] we're gonna miss him
[12:19] you know
[12:20] but jackson has been
[12:23] such a pillar of this church you know i
[12:26] refer to him as the
[12:28] face of the franchise you know it's like
[12:30] when you see jackson you see dallas it's
[12:32] always been
[12:35] my goodness words will fail me to
[12:37] describe everything
[12:39] such a honest upstanding person and
[12:42] you know he
[12:43] he when he does something he does it
[12:45] with everything within him and not
[12:47] halfway and i certainly appreciate all
[12:50] that it's done for the body a man who
[12:53] may never be
[12:54] forgotten or certainly pray that the
[12:56] lord will lead him in the path that is
[12:58] going and this morning we'll invite him
[13:00] to just come and say a few words to the
[13:01] church
[13:02] amen but certainly
[13:05] i you know i was woke up this morning
[13:07] trying to think i said you know just how
[13:10] much could be said of him and certainly
[13:12] appreciate him god bless you brother
[13:14] jackson man
[13:17] well as billy said you know
[13:20] we've decided to move the lord is
[13:22] leading us in another direction for
[13:24] another season
[13:26] brother davis said it so well on
[13:28] wednesday night he read a quote about a
[13:30] season of time and we know that god has
[13:32] all things ordained and all things are
[13:33] perfect um a lot of times i'll say that
[13:36] we can't ever tell exactly what he's
[13:38] doing
[13:40] time will tell the story
[13:41] um i look back at maybe the way that god
[13:44] was leading us and you see maybe a
[13:47] natural church body you see your friends
[13:49] you see your family maybe your home
[13:51] maybe your job and things like that you
[13:52] think well
[13:53] this is what people sign up for this is
[13:56] you know the god has granted you
[13:57] everything and then he's doing something
[13:59] and making a stirring and you got to
[14:01] consider that
[14:02] and one of the things that's on my heart
[14:03] and it may sound like a cliche but in
[14:06] matthew 6 33 he says but seek ye first
[14:09] the kingdom and his righteousness and
[14:11] all these things will be added and
[14:13] that's something that we've always
[14:14] wanted to portray in our life
[14:16] and even when it seems like it's tough
[14:18] or you're going through some things
[14:20] you want to make sure that that you're
[14:22] seeking his face first
[14:23] even as i told brother david i know that
[14:25] he given me the opportunity and not many
[14:27] not everybody has that type of
[14:29] opportunity but
[14:30] and i know he wanted to be here but due
[14:32] to timing and circumstances he had to be
[14:34] away this weekend at a funeral but i
[14:36] wanted to thank him and the mcgarry
[14:38] family as a whole they've always taken
[14:40] me in
[14:41] i told him i said i felt like the fourth
[14:42] son of the family
[14:44] he baptized me and laura
[14:46] he married us he dedicated our children
[14:49] he's baptized both of our children
[14:51] he even did my dad's funeral when he
[14:52] passed away several years ago
[14:54] and i would say the thing about brother
[14:56] david is he has a uh he has a heart for
[14:58] the people uh he knows that
[15:01] sometimes that he says and does things
[15:03] and then
[15:05] you know but then you see the heart of
[15:06] him and what he does for people and he's
[15:08] just done so much for me behind the
[15:10] scenes and
[15:11] just throughout my whole life it's just
[15:13] really taking care of me and then i
[15:15] would say here's a local church body um
[15:17] god has just raised up amazing men uh
[15:20] we're
[15:20] been in our first i was part of the the
[15:22] old building and then we built this
[15:24] building and now we're transitioning to
[15:26] another building so you see that god is
[15:27] adding to the flock here and he's just
[15:29] doing so many wonderful things so i say
[15:32] that hopefully i've served you guys well
[15:34] and the capacity as a deacon
[15:36] many of you have opened up your home
[15:38] over the years where we would come up
[15:39] and we lived an hour and 15 minutes away
[15:42] and people would just open up their home
[15:44] and let us stay and
[15:46] feed us and have just really played
[15:48] their part as the body here locally so
[15:50] we say thank you
[15:52] we haven't been able to meet all the
[15:53] obligations because of the timing with
[15:55] folks who want to want to get together
[15:57] but this will be our last service so
[15:59] we'll be heading out after this
[16:02] and i just want to say that that we love
[16:04] you we know that god's blessings will be
[16:06] upon you and just ask that you would
[16:08] pray for us and our family and whatever
[16:10] the lord has for us next so we just say
[16:12] god bless you
[16:14] [Applause]
[16:20] amen
[16:23] amen we that are remaining will continue
[16:25] to fight amen that's what we're here to
[16:28] do it's uh we're in the
[16:30] lord's battle and we'll fight wherever
[16:32] he wants us to be fighting amen god
[16:34] bless you this morning we'll invite
[16:35] brother tim salah for assam reading this
[16:37] morning if you could stand amen
[16:53] welcome to the house of the lord amen
[16:55] what a blessing it is to be here uh
[16:59] that's tough news you hear
[17:02] this morning uh
[17:05] but the jackson sister laura have been a
[17:07] part of us for so long they certainly
[17:09] feel like family we'll miss them dearly
[17:16] appreciate brother jackson all he stood
[17:18] for
[17:20] i think it's uh
[17:22] clearly evident what a true conversion
[17:25] will do for you
[17:28] man
[17:30] we don't want to take too much time this
[17:32] morning but
[17:33] you get the opportunity to
[17:34] come up here and if you're able you can
[17:37] speak
[17:38] um
[17:40] we just want to edify the body of christ
[17:43] and exhort
[17:45] the one that we're living for
[17:47] we're going to read from psalm 71
[17:50] my bible says
[17:52] david prayeth for perseverance
[17:55] and truly
[17:57] that's what we need in this hour
[18:00] i've been reflecting for some time when
[18:05] book of galatians paul said
[18:08] that we're the children of promise
[18:14] i'm so thankful this morning
[18:18] account of the great privilege to be
[18:20] considered a child of promise
[18:22] we know that
[18:23] abraham had two sons ishmael and isaac
[18:27] and the bible says
[18:29] that the bondwoman would not be heir
[18:30] with a free woman
[18:33] and brother branham i just
[18:35] noticed this morning in searching that
[18:37] he uses this scripture
[18:39] and the message c does not ever the
[18:41] shock
[18:44] and he preached that
[18:45] in late spring of 65
[18:49] and he started drawing the difference
[18:51] between organized religion and the bride
[18:53] of christ
[18:56] and he drew it a lot finer than that
[18:58] right before the last services he had at
[19:01] the tabernacle
[19:03] he really laid it out there
[19:05] satan's eden god of this evil age
[19:07] and realizing
[19:09] that
[19:10] the domination world is serving the
[19:12] devil worshiping the devil and doesn't
[19:14] even know it
[19:19] and you realize how he talked about the
[19:21] life that was in the tassel the stalk
[19:25] the husk even
[19:27] for a season for a time god winked at
[19:29] that and that was the life could make to
[19:31] the seed once it got in the seed
[19:34] you better get out of the husk
[19:36] you know there's
[19:37] we like to think of progressive
[19:38] revelation sometimes in the in the
[19:40] message where
[19:42] we get a little insight on what the
[19:43] prophet is talking about and then we
[19:45] search and we think oh it gets a little
[19:46] deeper a little deeper a few years later
[19:48] maybe god reveals the whole thing for
[19:50] you and i and i do believe that
[19:54] but there's not going to be error and
[19:56] then truth and then error than truth
[19:58] once you see the truth let's stick with
[20:00] the truth
[20:01] amen
[20:03] amen
[20:07] and that's how we are
[20:08] children of the promise
[20:10] is because of our faith in the lord
[20:11] jesus he said not the abraham and his
[20:14] seed were the promises made seed
[20:16] singular not plural as in seeds of many
[20:19] but one which was jesus christ and by
[20:21] faith in jesus christ that's how we
[20:23] become children of the promise
[20:25] amen let's read this
[20:28] psalm 71
[20:30] and i want to add this i appreciate that
[20:32] this body here this assembly
[20:34] and all that you've done for my wife and
[20:35] i the
[20:37] you know and obviously there's empty
[20:38] seats over here it's uh
[20:42] it's kind of like jackson largo you know
[20:44] it's just it leaves a hole
[20:45] uh we're thankful that we have a church
[20:47] family that's done so much for us
[20:49] in service and blessings financial
[20:52] everything else
[20:53] and what we've just been through but
[20:55] thank you for that
[20:57] psalm 71
[20:59] in thee oh lord do i put my trust let me
[21:02] never be put to confusion
[21:04] deliver me in thy righteousness and
[21:07] cause me to escape incline thine ear
[21:09] unto me and save me be thou my strong
[21:13] habitation whereunto i may continually
[21:16] resort thou has given commandment to
[21:18] save me for thou art my rock and my
[21:21] fortress deliver me o my god out of the
[21:24] hand of the wicked out of the hand of
[21:26] the unrighteous and cruel man for thou
[21:29] art my hope o lord god thou art my trust
[21:32] from my youth by thee have i been
[21:35] holding up from the womb thou art he
[21:38] that took me out of my mother's bowels
[21:40] my praise shall be continually of thee i
[21:43] am as a wonder unto many but thou art my
[21:46] strong refuge let my mouth be filled
[21:49] with i praise and with thy honor all the
[21:52] day
[21:53] cast me off
[21:56] forsake me not when my strength faileth
[21:59] for mine enemies speak against me and
[22:02] they that lay wait for my soul take
[22:04] counsel together
[22:05] saying god hath forsaken him persecute
[22:09] and take him for there is none to
[22:11] deliver him
[22:12] oh god be not far from me o my god make
[22:16] haste for my health let them be
[22:18] confounded and consumed that are
[22:20] adversaries to my soul
[22:22] let them be recovered with reproach and
[22:24] dishonor that seek my hurt
[22:27] but i will hope continually and yet
[22:29] praise thee more and more
[22:32] my shall fold forth thy righteousness
[22:34] and thy salvation all the day for i know
[22:37] not the numbers thereof
[22:39] i will go in the strength of the lord
[22:41] god i will make mention of thy
[22:43] righteousness even of thine only o god
[22:46] thou hast taught me from my youth and
[22:49] hitherto have i declared thy wondrous
[22:51] works
[22:52] now also when i am old and grey-headed
[22:55] oh god forsake me not until i have
[22:58] showed thy strength unto this generation
[23:01] and thy power to everyone that is to
[23:03] come thy righteousness also o god is
[23:06] very high who has done great things o
[23:09] god who is like unto thee
[23:12] thou which has shown me great and sore
[23:14] troubles shall quicken me again and
[23:17] shall bring up again from the depths of
[23:20] the earth
[23:21] thou shalt increase my greatness and
[23:23] comfort me on every side
[23:25] i will also praise thee with the sultry
[23:28] even thy truth o my god unto thee will i
[23:31] sing with the heart oh thou mighty one
[23:34] of israel my lips shall greatly rejoice
[23:37] when i sing unto thee and my soul which
[23:40] thou hast redeemed my tongue also shall
[23:43] talk of thy righteousness all the day
[23:45] long for they are confounded for they
[23:48] are brought unto shame that seek my hurt

[34:28] amen aren't you glad for the grace i was
[34:30] extended amen
[34:32] amen we have unspoken requests and
[34:36] um sister rebecca writes in the biblical
[34:38] request asking for god
[34:41] guidance
[34:42] and also another one that says one
[34:44] one of our customers has asked
[34:47] to please pray for his son-in-law
[34:49] he's 28 years old and
[34:52] he's been diagnosed with prostate cancer
[34:54] and
[34:55] and liver cancer and
[34:58] she said that she knows that our god is
[35:00] a real god amen
[35:02] and i ask that we have faith for her
[35:05] and her family i mean i believe that's
[35:07] what the gospel is for a man that he may
[35:10] be extended to those that needs it that
[35:12] that same god may manifest that same
[35:15] power that he manifested in us through
[35:17] other people amen
[35:18] amen and amen i believe there's nothing
[35:21] that makes a believer more happy than to
[35:22] see god
[35:24] move and extend that same grace and
[35:26] mercy to somebody else so if you have a
[35:28] knee upon your heart just leave your
[35:29] hand up to him when i remember our

[50:01] great word that you've sent and the
[50:02] mighty men that you have
[50:04] raised up in the last days lord
[50:08] many times we can shrink back
[50:12] lord we want to look with eyes of faith
[50:14] this morning to know that this is
[50:16] something that
[50:17] man has not done but this is something
[50:19] that you're doing
[50:21] in each one of us lord that you are
[50:23] building
[50:24] a house with lively stones
[50:27] of revelations that have struck the
[50:29] hearts of men and women across the world
[50:32] with this great revelation that you have
[50:34] unfolded in the last days
[50:37] and father we're here
[50:39] standing in position
[50:41] asking that you would come now lord that
[50:43] you would anoint
[50:44] your servant that you'd anoint your
[50:47] people
[50:48] anoint our eyes with i sat
[50:50] father break the bread of life as only
[50:52] you can lord we look for the
[50:54] supernatural this morning we're looking
[50:56] for you to move in a mighty way lord it
[50:59] is not by chance that we have gathered
[51:01] together this morning but this has been
[51:03] a predestinated this has been ordained
[51:07] by you so we come with a confidence lord
[51:10] knowing that the needs that we have the
[51:11] questions upon our heart lord we serve a
[51:14] god that is the same yesterday today and
[51:16] forever and now lord we're looking at
[51:18] the unseen father that you come now
[51:22] have vine wade in this service we pray
[51:24] in jesus christ's name
[51:26] amen praise the lord
[51:28] and if you have your bibles let's just
[51:29] turn in psalms 118.
[51:32] amen i just want to get right to the
[51:34] word we want to remember our pastor and
[51:36] sister leslie has their way um at the
[51:39] funeral for for joe dalton just dear
[51:41] friends going back to the flagstaff
[51:43] years and
[51:44] i certainly had to spend time with them
[51:49] when i lived in the area and just over
[51:50] the years so just remember them
[51:52] and also um
[51:55] i i i would comment or say more
[51:58] about um
[52:02] brother jackson and the burns but i'm
[52:04] going to move right to the word i
[52:06] couldn't
[52:07] say anything greater than what the word
[52:10] would say
[52:11] and so this will be my heart to them
[52:15] let's read psalms 118.
[52:18] verse 21 reads
[52:25] i will praise thee
[52:28] for thou hast heard me
[52:30] and art become my salvation
[52:33] the stone which the builders refused has
[52:35] become the headstone of the corner
[52:38] this is the lord's doing
[52:40] and it's marvelous
[52:42] in our eyes let's also return to romans
[52:45] 9 33.
[52:49] i don't know if we'll have maybe time to
[52:51] get into it but i want to read this
[52:53] portion here because romans 9 33 it says
[52:58] as you turn there this is the scripture
[53:00] uh that uh brother branham came out of
[53:03] the vision that he had on december 22nd
[53:05] 1962
[53:07] as he was that vision uh being uh caught
[53:10] there in that constellation of angels he
[53:12] would come out of that vision and he'd
[53:14] be reading this romans 9 33 and then it
[53:17] also would say that it would seem
[53:19] juvenile but i said lord if that be you
[53:21] let me turn in my bible again to read
[53:24] this and so i believe that this
[53:27] scripture is linked to the fulfillment
[53:29] of the vision of the constellation of
[53:32] angels it says as it was written behold
[53:34] i lay in zion a stumbling stone and a
[53:37] rock of offense and whosoever believeth
[53:40] on him shall not be ashamed you may have
[53:42] your seats this morning
[53:44] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[53:46] be ashamed as we even heard wednesday
[53:49] night you know blessed is he who is not
[53:51] offended in me
[53:53] and i just want to encourage you this
[53:56] morning to have faith in what god is
[53:58] doing
[53:59] if there's anything that i can convey to
[54:01] the bride of jesus christ something that
[54:03] is in my heart that i want to speak to
[54:05] you i want you to have faith in what god
[54:08] is doing
[54:10] i just want to encourage you that and if
[54:12] maybe for a title i would like to title
[54:14] this this is the lord's doing
[54:17] and it's marvelous in our eyes
[54:20] this is the lord's doing
[54:23] and it's marvelous in our eyes uh the
[54:25] prophet of god would say this and
[54:27] expectancy if i can get a little bit
[54:28] more on the on the monitors he would say
[54:30] now no matter what the opposition looks
[54:33] like
[54:35] christ is the answer
[54:38] faith brings christ
[54:40] thank you
[54:41] notice could you remember 80 years old a
[54:44] white beard now he's speaking of simeon
[54:46] who was 80 years old it looked like his
[54:48] life
[54:49] was coming to an end but this crazy old
[54:51] man
[54:52] was going around and telling people that
[54:54] i'm not going to die until i see the
[54:56] lord's christ
[54:58] now and i'll think of that testimony
[55:00] there uh now that he's saying but but
[55:02] watch what the prophet says he says no
[55:05] matter what the opposition looks like
[55:07] christ is the answer
[55:09] faith brings christ
[55:11] notice could you remember 80 years old
[55:13] white beard white hair and yet an old
[55:15] man went around telling people that he
[55:17] wasn't going to die until he's seen the
[55:19] lord's christ what a beautiful picture
[55:22] of faith remember that what a beautiful
[55:25] picture of faith faith knows no defeat
[55:30] oh glory to god
[55:32] look i'm wanting to encourage you this
[55:33] morning
[55:34] look god got it all in control now
[55:37] faith knows no defeat faith is perfect
[55:40] faith brings things when there is
[55:43] nothing to be brought
[55:46] oh my you might feel a little hopeless
[55:49] this morning you might feel like you
[55:51] don't know what to do you might feel
[55:52] like there's nothing for you but look
[55:54] faith brings things when there is
[55:57] nothing to be brought faith creates
[56:00] faith takes doubt away faith takes a
[56:03] negative and makes it a positive oh
[56:05] hallelujah think of that now faith takes
[56:08] a negative and makes it a positive i
[56:10] just want to say if we could only see
[56:13] what the master is doing this morning i
[56:15] want to say that revelation helps
[56:17] develop the picture
[56:21] faith helps develop the picture you know
[56:24] many times it's it's our lack of
[56:26] understanding it's our lack of
[56:28] perception that causes us to look at a
[56:30] situation
[56:32] the wrong way
[56:34] you know i think of this story maybe
[56:36] you've heard it of this man he was on
[56:38] the subway and he was taking his daily
[56:40] commute and and no doubt there early in
[56:43] the morning people are riding the subway
[56:46] and you got some that are that are uh
[56:48] reading the newspapers some are now now
[56:51] i've told you how old the story is
[56:52] because nobody reads a newspaper anymore
[56:55] they were reading the newspaper and and
[56:58] people some were just dozing off to
[57:00] sleep and it was kind of just a quiet uh
[57:02] morning on the subway and people were
[57:04] going their way and this man he just
[57:06] kind of cozy down into his seat and and
[57:08] he was just maybe looking at the people
[57:10] and there was a stop and this man got on
[57:12] the train with two kids and he just
[57:14] nestled down beside him and he looked at
[57:17] him and the man just seemed to just
[57:18] close his eyes immediately
[57:20] and he looked over at the kids and the
[57:22] train took off and and all of a sudden
[57:24] these kids were kind of uh running and
[57:26] causing a little scene
[57:28] on the on the subway and he thought my
[57:32] and he looked over at the uh perceived
[57:34] to be the father and thought well why is
[57:36] this man allowing these kids you know
[57:38] this it was kind of was peaceful on this
[57:40] train and all of a sudden they're
[57:41] causing nonsense and they're running by
[57:43] and they they stepped on that one
[57:45] person's shoe and made them flinch and
[57:47] they spilled their coffin he ran by and
[57:48] hit that other people's
[57:50] paper this this little cozy atmosphere
[57:53] that we were in has all sudden been
[57:55] disre
[57:56] disrupted uh how uh
[57:59] this man is so uh inconsiderate
[58:02] you're so inconsiderate of everybody
[58:04] else why are you so oblivious to
[58:07] everything that's going on and you're
[58:08] just going to let these little kids run
[58:10] wild
[58:12] and so you know he finally mustered up a
[58:13] little courage and thought you know what
[58:15] i got to say something
[58:16] i i i got to do something you know many
[58:19] times
[58:20] we do that
[58:21] we think we got the answer and we're
[58:23] going to be the one to say something and
[58:24] we come and approach the individual like
[58:26] you know what i'm going to set you
[58:27] straight
[58:30] and he looks over at the man and he he
[58:32] he kind of nudges him and says hey
[58:35] you know your kids you know everything
[58:37] was okay and uh on here but now your
[58:39] kids are running through in there
[58:40] they're wreaking havoc
[58:42] why don't you get a handle of your kids
[58:45] and the man just said oh
[58:48] i'm so sorry i i don't know what to do
[58:51] we just
[58:53] we just come from the hospital they just
[58:55] lost their mother she died of a brain
[58:56] aneurysm
[58:58] i don't know what i'm gonna do
[59:00] and all of a sudden this man who once
[59:03] was filled with anger
[59:05] this man that was irritated this man
[59:08] that was going to set him straight he he
[59:11] was he was going to really read this guy
[59:12] the rights act but when he got more of
[59:15] the story when he received a little bit
[59:17] more information all of a sudden there
[59:19] was a paradigm shift
[59:21] all of a sudden the the perspective if i
[59:24] could say it this way the angle that he
[59:26] was looking at the story changed
[59:33] and when the angle of the story changed
[59:35] all of a sudden the irritation was
[59:38] replaced with compassion
[59:40] the anger was replaced with concern and
[59:43] all of a sudden there was this paradigm
[59:45] shift where all of these emotions that
[59:48] he was feeling once about what was
[59:50] unfolding in front of him now he's
[59:52] totally switched the way he was looking
[59:55] at the story and he's looking at it now
[59:57] with what can i do to help i want to
[1:00:00] support you i want to help you oh what
[1:00:02] happened what is wrong or what can i do
[1:00:05] for you and immediately when when when
[1:00:08] that story kind of was conveyed and the
[1:00:10] people that were sitting around and
[1:00:12] heard the story all of a sudden all the
[1:00:14] attitudes
[1:00:16] come on somebody
[1:00:17] a lot of time we get attitudes
[1:00:20] well a lot of times we think we know
[1:00:21] what we should do well i tell you what i
[1:00:23] mean that person they're late to church
[1:00:26] every sunday and they don't come on
[1:00:27] wednesday what's the matter with i'm
[1:00:28] just gonna well why don't you take that
[1:00:30] brother out for a meal why don't you
[1:00:32] take them out or why don't you reach out
[1:00:34] to them why don't you get to down to
[1:00:36] where they're living and see what you
[1:00:37] can do to help them
[1:00:40] many times we got the solution and we
[1:00:42] haven't spent one hour in prayer we
[1:00:44] haven't spent one minute in prayer we
[1:00:46] haven't even tried to think it out oh
[1:00:48] god what can i do to help my brother and
[1:00:51] sister we just want to sit there in the
[1:00:53] judgment seat and the scripture says be
[1:00:56] careful with what judgment you judge
[1:00:58] lest you be judged
[1:01:03] be careful now
[1:01:05] you look out on your brothers and
[1:01:06] sisters and you judge them
[1:01:09] when you haven't had to walk one step in
[1:01:11] their shoes
[1:01:13] you don't know what they're going
[1:01:14] through you don't know what it took for
[1:01:16] them to get to the house of god on
[1:01:18] sunday morning you don't know what it
[1:01:19] took for them to get to the house of god
[1:01:21] on wednesday you don't know what it took
[1:01:23] oh but if we can just look past the veil
[1:01:26] if we look past our own carnal thinking
[1:01:28] if we can look past our ideas if there
[1:01:30] could be something that can anchor in
[1:01:32] your heart this morning that something
[1:01:34] could stand there and you can say this
[1:01:36] is the large doing and it's marvelous in
[1:01:39] our eyes
[1:01:42] see many times it's the lack of
[1:01:44] information
[1:01:45] the lack of understanding where we lose
[1:01:47] hope
[1:01:49] where where we get angry and we get
[1:01:51] upset and we get confused
[1:01:54] but i just want to say there is
[1:01:56] something beyond what you can see
[1:01:59] this morning
[1:02:01] there's something beyond your feelings
[1:02:04] there's something beyond your emotions
[1:02:07] there's something beyond your trials
[1:02:09] there's something beyond everything that
[1:02:12] you are feeling in the natural i want to
[1:02:14] say uh there's something beyond that
[1:02:17] that is taking place
[1:02:21] i think of gaza
[1:02:24] coming out there in the morning
[1:02:27] and the syrian army had surrounded them
[1:02:31] and what did he do said oh master
[1:02:35] what are we going to do
[1:02:38] because all
[1:02:39] hazel could do was he could just see
[1:02:42] that he was outnumbered in the natural
[1:02:45] come on somebody
[1:02:48] all gazer could do was see the
[1:02:50] circumstance
[1:02:51] he could only see the symptoms that he
[1:02:53] was surrounded by but he couldn't see
[1:02:56] the supernatural
[1:02:59] and so when he came to the man of god he
[1:03:01] said oh master what are we going to do
[1:03:04] see the prophet
[1:03:06] he he had he had eagle vision
[1:03:10] the prophet can see
[1:03:12] something that you cannot see
[1:03:14] and so the prophet could tell geheza i
[1:03:17] uh look guys there is more
[1:03:21] that is with us
[1:03:23] then that is with them
[1:03:25] not so much that even the prophet had
[1:03:27] seen it
[1:03:28] but
[1:03:28] the prophet knew by divine promise
[1:03:31] that the angel was with him and he knew
[1:03:34] that the
[1:03:35] the angels would camp around about the
[1:03:37] saints oh don't you realize there is
[1:03:39] more with us than there is against us if
[1:03:42] your eyes could just be open this
[1:03:44] morning to see the host of heaven that
[1:03:46] is sitting around the house of god this
[1:03:48] morning and what did the prophet say he
[1:03:51] prayed and said o lord open his eyes you
[1:03:55] see it takes a prophet to open the eyes
[1:03:58] it god god's word always comes to a
[1:04:01] prophet and it's through the prophet
[1:04:04] that the eyes come open and when the
[1:04:06] prophet spoke and said oh god open his
[1:04:09] eyes all of a sudden the angle or the
[1:04:11] perspective that he was looking at the
[1:04:14] picture from it was developed by a
[1:04:16] revelation that there is more with us
[1:04:19] than is or against us and all of a
[1:04:21] sudden the scene changed completely
[1:04:24] and i'm wanting to encourage you this
[1:04:26] morning
[1:04:28] you're you're you you're feeling
[1:04:30] attacked you're feeling pinned down
[1:04:33] you're feeling helpless you're feeling
[1:04:35] hurt you're feeling wounded you don't
[1:04:37] understand what's going on you don't
[1:04:39] understand why these things are
[1:04:41] happening why are we going through this
[1:04:43] i don't understand why it has to be this
[1:04:45] way this is wrong it shouldn't go this
[1:04:47] way i don't understand it but i believe
[1:04:50] there's a revelation that can strike
[1:04:52] your heart today where you can step back
[1:04:55] in the face of all the circumstance in
[1:04:57] the face of all the disappointment in
[1:04:59] the face of everything you're going
[1:05:01] through and in the face of the enemy you
[1:05:03] can say this is the lord's doing and
[1:05:06] it's marvelous in ours oh what a victory
[1:05:08] to be able to stand in the face of your
[1:05:11] adversary what a victory to be able to
[1:05:13] stand in a dark and evil day what a
[1:05:15] victory to be able to stand when hell is
[1:05:18] raging against you what a victory to be
[1:05:19] able to say come on am i preaching to
[1:05:21] somebody let's get loose in the house of
[1:05:23] god what's the matter with us oh what is
[1:05:26] it like
[1:05:27] to be able to stand with a revelation
[1:05:35] and say this is the lord's doing
[1:05:40] and it's marvelous
[1:05:43] in our eyes
[1:05:45] that's a victory church
[1:05:48] see the prophet
[1:05:50] could bring something that was unseen
[1:05:55] into view
[1:05:57] the prophet was able to say oh god
[1:06:00] open his eyes
[1:06:03] this message takes the negative
[1:06:06] and makes it positive
[1:06:09] without this word
[1:06:11] lest you walk in the light as he is in
[1:06:14] the light
[1:06:15] and the blood of jesus christ oh we have
[1:06:17] fellowship one with another and the
[1:06:19] blood of jesus christ cleanses us from
[1:06:22] all of our sins you realize that god has
[1:06:25] sent a vindicated message god has sent a
[1:06:28] prophet god has by by divine a
[1:06:31] revelation and vindication at the
[1:06:33] revealing of the son of man what is it
[1:06:36] doing it's taking a negative
[1:06:38] oh glory to god in the darkest hour
[1:06:41] that the world has ever seen when there
[1:06:44] is no light but in the evening time it
[1:06:48] shall be light he takes the negative he
[1:06:51] takes the darkness and he makes it a
[1:06:54] positive oh that's the god we serve he
[1:06:57] can take whatever negative situation
[1:06:59] whatever negative symptom whatever
[1:07:01] you're going through he will take it and
[1:07:03] he can make it a positive
[1:07:07] for hebrews says hebrews 11 1 says now
[1:07:10] faith is the evidence of things hoped
[1:07:12] for
[1:07:16] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:07:18] for the evidence
[1:07:20] of things not seen and by faith right
[1:07:23] it's by faith we understand that god
[1:07:24] created the heavens and earth it's by
[1:07:26] faith we understand that he framed the
[1:07:28] world
[1:07:30] and galatians 3 6 would say even as
[1:07:32] abraham believed god
[1:07:34] and it was accounted unto him for
[1:07:35] righteousness know ye not that they
[1:07:38] which are of faith the same are the
[1:07:40] children of abraham
[1:07:45] is this just a story
[1:07:48] know ye not that ye are the seed of
[1:07:50] abraham
[1:07:52] the royal seed of abraham
[1:07:54] not the seed of the flesh but the royal
[1:07:56] seed through jesus christ that which you
[1:07:59] are heir to
[1:08:01] all things
[1:08:04] it's for you
[1:08:06] god gave abraham a promise
[1:08:12] why because he wanted to
[1:08:18] god gave abraham a land why
[1:08:21] because he wanted to
[1:08:23] god gave you a promise
[1:08:25] why because he wanted to god sanctified
[1:08:28] you why because he wanted to god filled
[1:08:30] you with the holy ghost why because he
[1:08:32] wanted to god sent nine spiritual gifts
[1:08:34] into the church why because he wanted to
[1:08:37] i wonder if you want what god wants for
[1:08:39] you if we can just get out of our
[1:08:41] thinking and out of our ideas and out of
[1:08:43] what we think we want and not what god
[1:08:46] wants for you coming to manifestation
[1:08:48] there'll be a power sweep through this
[1:08:50] building there'll be a power to set you
[1:08:52] free
[1:08:53] oh
[1:08:54] hallelujah i'm preaching to somebody
[1:08:56] this is for you church
[1:09:00] there's a power here
[1:09:04] there's something here to set you free
[1:09:06] you ain't got to live in bondage anymore
[1:09:09] i'm coming for something watch out devil
[1:09:13] oh brother matthew you can't talk like
[1:09:14] that well the prophet talked like that
[1:09:16] well why don't we just get into it can
[1:09:18] you can you receive it from a prophet
[1:09:20] i wonder if we can we say we can receive
[1:09:22] it from a prophet but when a preacher
[1:09:23] says what the prophet said we can't
[1:09:25] receive it
[1:09:26] watch out somebody when a man of god
[1:09:28] stands and preaches a vindicated message
[1:09:32] sometimes we don't want to receive it
[1:09:34] because we don't like the veil
[1:09:36] we say we believe what's on the tapes
[1:09:38] and then we preach it and you don't even
[1:09:40] respond but i'm wondering if there's a
[1:09:42] people in the house of god this morning
[1:09:45] with faith in their heart that will
[1:09:46] respond to the call of god
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:52] god could have called everybody on the
[1:09:54] planet earth
[1:09:57] but there was only one person
[1:10:00] with the ability to respond
[1:10:03] that was abraham
[1:10:05] well matthew where do you get that well
[1:10:08] god put something in abraham
[1:10:11] why are you sitting here this morning
[1:10:14] is it because of something you did
[1:10:17] your ability
[1:10:19] you were able to do two plus two equals
[1:10:21] revelations 10 7 luke 17 30 and that's
[1:10:25] why i'm here come on somebody
[1:10:27] no this is this is the lord's doing
[1:10:31] oh something's moving in my heart now
[1:10:33] this is the lord that's why you're
[1:10:34] sitting here this is the lord's story
[1:10:37] because god called you god placed
[1:10:39] something in you that could receive the
[1:10:41] message of the hour where other people
[1:10:43] walked away there's something in your
[1:10:45] heart that i can't walk away i can't
[1:10:48] leave this message why because god has
[1:10:50] placed something inside you that can't
[1:10:52] walk away
[1:10:54] that's like me trying to walk away from
[1:10:56] being a mcgeary i'm no longer going to
[1:10:59] be a mcgeary i'm just fed up with with
[1:11:01] all the complexes and the big nose and
[1:11:04] i'm just fed up with my mannerisms and
[1:11:06] every time i preach people accuse me of
[1:11:08] acting like my daddy and acting like my
[1:11:10] brother and looking like them i'm just
[1:11:12] i'm just going to throw in the towel i'm
[1:11:14] done well you know what's going to
[1:11:15] happen every day i wake up i'm going to
[1:11:17] realize i'm a mcgeary and there's
[1:11:18] nothing i can do to change that i can
[1:11:21] even have plastic surgery i can rip my
[1:11:23] face off it doesn't matter what i do i
[1:11:26] was born on a dairy and there's a people
[1:11:28] in the house of god that were born sons
[1:11:31] and daughters of god and there ain't
[1:11:33] nothing you can do to change that when
[1:11:35] did you become an eagle
[1:11:37] when you heard the message no you always
[1:11:40] were an eagle and the reason you can be
[1:11:42] reborn is because you're a son of god
[1:11:47] oh glory to god
[1:11:49] this is the lord's doing
[1:11:52] see the devil wants to try to stop what
[1:11:54] the lord is doing but he can't
[1:11:56] whoo somebody come to the house of god
[1:11:58] to get delivered and satan wants to stop
[1:12:01] it but he can't
[1:12:03] as long as there's believing children
[1:12:05] believing sons and daughters of god with
[1:12:07] the call of god upon their heart that
[1:12:09] will receive the word
[1:12:12] watch out devils
[1:12:14] oh glory to god
[1:12:17] hallelujah
[1:12:18] abraham could possess the land
[1:12:23] and what was on it
[1:12:25] look you can possess all things
[1:12:30] possessing all things 1962
[1:12:33] abraham could possess the land of what
[1:12:35] was on it god gave it to him
[1:12:37] and lot was part of that land so abraham
[1:12:39] had a right to it
[1:12:43] he could call or lay hold of it he said
[1:12:45] now
[1:12:46] god you made me the promise
[1:12:49] somebody i just start swirling that in
[1:12:50] your heart
[1:12:51] god you made me a promise
[1:12:54] that this land and all that was in it is
[1:12:56] mine
[1:12:57] you made the promise
[1:12:59] now my kinsmen has been taken
[1:13:02] and all he's got is gone
[1:13:04] in other words if i would apply it today
[1:13:06] i would say the church could say lord
[1:13:08] god here's my brother he's laying here
[1:13:10] stricken with cancer he's stricken with
[1:13:12] tuberculosis he got sown so i lay hold
[1:13:15] of the promise it's my possession you
[1:13:18] told me so amen there you are then then
[1:13:21] then you can go after that enemy
[1:13:26] well somebody ought to start getting
[1:13:27] encouraged
[1:13:28] you can go after that enemy what enemy
[1:13:31] are you fighting
[1:13:32] what are you up against
[1:13:36] you can go after that enemy
[1:13:40] the devil and slaughter it
[1:13:42] just the same as abraham slaughtered the
[1:13:44] kings and brought back his possession
[1:13:46] amen i like that it's two believers it's
[1:13:49] not to the make believer it's not to the
[1:13:51] unbeliever it's not to the impersonators
[1:13:54] look i'm not so much looking for
[1:13:55] something that i could work up
[1:14:00] i'm looking at a promise
[1:14:02] and if you're looking at a promise
[1:14:05] that's the thing that gets you moving
[1:14:07] the prophet of god said the real
[1:14:08] believer is looking for the
[1:14:09] manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:14:12] something in their heart moving i'm not
[1:14:14] looking for something that's dead
[1:14:16] i'm not looking for some formal cold
[1:14:19] dead religion where i just sit in the
[1:14:21] pew and i say oh bless god amen god sent
[1:14:24] a prophet no so i'm looking for the
[1:14:26] manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:14:29] something in my heart that's moving oh i
[1:14:32] want a fire shut up in my bones the holy
[1:14:35] spirit and manifestation paul said i
[1:14:38] come not with enticing words of men's
[1:14:40] wisdom but i come in the power and
[1:14:42] demonstration of the holy ghost there is
[1:14:44] a holy ghost here with power and
[1:14:46] demonstration if you can receive the
[1:14:48] manifestation
[1:14:50] oh hallelujah
[1:14:53] glory
[1:14:56] the real believers looking
[1:14:59] for the manifestation
[1:15:01] are you looking
[1:15:03] what you looking for this morning
[1:15:06] what did you come to see
[1:15:08] you come to fulfill a religious idea
[1:15:11] is there parameters on your faith
[1:15:14] when i go to church this this is the way
[1:15:17] we do it here
[1:15:20] and there's limits
[1:15:21] there's limits on on how i believe
[1:15:25] there's limits on how i conduct myself
[1:15:27] there's limits on how the holy ghost
[1:15:29] decides to move
[1:15:34] i'm going to guard my heart because boy
[1:15:37] if the holy ghost gets a hold of me i
[1:15:39] don't know what would happen
[1:15:40] i might act a fool well
[1:15:43] well
[1:15:44] if it's the holy ghost
[1:15:48] what are you looking for
[1:15:50] when jesus was passing by you know the
[1:15:52] throng of people were were all around
[1:15:54] him but there was a believer there that
[1:15:56] said oh if i could only touch the m of
[1:15:58] his garment
[1:16:00] that's who this message is to is to that
[1:16:03] real believer oh if i could only uh
[1:16:05] touch the hem of his garment
[1:16:08] is there somebody here that come to the
[1:16:09] service this morning that says oh if i
[1:16:12] could only touch the hymn of his garment
[1:16:17] anything's possible
[1:16:19] the promise is to you
[1:16:21] god gave it to you why because he wanted
[1:16:23] to
[1:16:25] god wants to set you free
[1:16:28] god wants to give you your heart's
[1:16:29] desire god wants to speak to you god
[1:16:32] wants to give you revelation god god
[1:16:35] wants to to sanctify you and fill with
[1:16:37] the holy ghost
[1:16:38] god wants to pour his gifts into the
[1:16:40] church do you want them
[1:16:43] oh brother matthew those days are gone
[1:16:46] the uh i'm sorry i've heard a vindicated
[1:16:49] prophet say too many times when people
[1:16:52] brought that argument and say the
[1:16:53] apostle times are over
[1:16:56] he said i'll show you where they started
[1:16:58] you show me where they ended
[1:17:00] and perceived to prove that jesus christ
[1:17:02] was the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:04] that same god is here this morning
[1:17:08] that same god is here tomorrow will you
[1:17:10] open up your heart and receive the word
[1:17:13] will you welcome the word this morning
[1:17:15] are you willing to let the holy ghost
[1:17:17] and the word minister to your heart are
[1:17:19] you ready to get rid of your ideas and
[1:17:21] your thinking and your ways and how i
[1:17:25] think about it and my judgment and the
[1:17:27] way i thought it all should be and are
[1:17:29] you willing to allow the word wash you
[1:17:32] and cleanse you and set you up upon the
[1:17:35] strong rock of revelation where you can
[1:17:37] stand there and say this is the lord's
[1:17:39] doing and it's marvelous in our eyes i'm
[1:17:41] tired of being a critic i'm tired of
[1:17:44] criticizing i just want to jump all the
[1:17:47] way into the holy ghost and say lord
[1:17:49] whatever you have for me here i am
[1:17:52] yet abraham had a right to the promise
[1:17:54] and the promise was his yet he had to
[1:17:56] fight to possess it see that's the
[1:17:58] problem some of us don't want to fight
[1:18:02] did you come to do battle this morning
[1:18:05] i hope somebody's here fighting with me
[1:18:09] hey if we're gonna have deliverance in
[1:18:10] the house of god we gotta fight for it
[1:18:12] if demon spirits gonna be cast out we
[1:18:14] gotta fight for it if our children are
[1:18:15] gonna be filled with the holy ghost we
[1:18:16] gotta fight for it if people are gonna
[1:18:18] be healed we gotta fight for it is there
[1:18:20] people that have gathered together this
[1:18:22] morning that are gonna fight for the
[1:18:24] manifestation of the promise that god
[1:18:26] has given you
[1:18:29] well draw your sword let's get ready
[1:18:31] let's go to battle
[1:18:36] he had to fight to possess it there you
[1:18:38] are the believer today yet we are heir
[1:18:40] to all things
[1:18:42] yet we are heir to every spiritual
[1:18:43] blessing every physical blessing every
[1:18:45] blessing the bible promised but yet you
[1:18:47] have to fight for every inch of it
[1:18:49] that's the way god's got it set up it's
[1:18:51] always been that way you have to fight
[1:18:53] to possess what you know is your own
[1:18:57] maybe that's the problem we need a
[1:18:59] paradigm shift
[1:19:01] because maybe the devil's been lying to
[1:19:03] you so long that you don't think what is
[1:19:06] yours is not yours anymore
[1:19:08] some of you have been robbed from your
[1:19:09] joy
[1:19:10] some of you have been robbed from your
[1:19:12] shout some of you have been robbed from
[1:19:14] your victory where is that victory you
[1:19:15] had a youth camp oh brother matthew
[1:19:17] you're going all the way back to april
[1:19:19] yeah i'm going all the way back to april
[1:19:21] why not because something real happened
[1:19:22] to you where is that real something that
[1:19:24] happened to you i think it's time for a
[1:19:26] revival what is a revival it's not
[1:19:28] getting something new it's stirring up
[1:19:30] something that's already there why don't
[1:19:32] you just start thinking about the joy of
[1:19:33] the lord why don't you start thinking
[1:19:35] about what god did for you some of us
[1:19:36] that have been doing it for a little
[1:19:38] while why don't you think back 20 years
[1:19:39] ago figure out 30 years ago when that
[1:19:41] burden of sin was upon you you didn't
[1:19:43] know what you were doing you were
[1:19:45] battling thoughts of suicide you were
[1:19:47] laying in your bed ready to die but god
[1:19:49] had thoughts concerning you not thoughts
[1:19:51] of evil but he hadn't expected him he
[1:19:53] had given you a word he had given you
[1:19:55] promise he wasn't going to let you die
[1:19:57] laying there oh come on somebody and
[1:19:59] then when you heard that voice when you
[1:20:01] heard the love of god to you and
[1:20:02] something broke loose oh there was a joy
[1:20:05] there was a shout there was a victory
[1:20:07] there was something you wanted to talk
[1:20:08] about does somebody know what i'm
[1:20:11] talking about is there somebody that's
[1:20:12] been set free is there somebody that's
[1:20:14] been filled with the holy ghost is there
[1:20:16] somebody that's been delivered have you
[1:20:17] been delivered a pornography have you
[1:20:19] been delivered of suicidal thoughts and
[1:20:21] tendencies have you been delivered from
[1:20:23] the the constant bombardment of evil
[1:20:26] thoughts on your mind has god ever
[1:20:27] delivered you then there ought to be a

[1:20:48] hallelujah there wasn't no drugs there
[1:20:51] wasn't no alcohol there was nothing the
[1:20:53] world could offer me that could ever
[1:20:55] take the place of the love of god even
[1:20:58] though i went looking out there
[1:21:00] i ran way out there
[1:21:02] i looked far
[1:21:04] i looked wide i looked deep i looked all
[1:21:07] around and all i found was misery
[1:21:11] nothing
[1:21:12] could satisfy that hunger
[1:21:15] nothing could satisfy that crave oh but
[1:21:18] when i met the lord
[1:21:19] on the backside of a desert on those
[1:21:21] sacred stands when i met that pillar of
[1:21:24] fire and i was changed oh there was a
[1:21:26] joy there was a love there was a peace
[1:21:29] that set me free and set my soul on fire
[1:21:33] and there are people in the house of god
[1:21:36] that is on fire
[1:21:39] well you might as well get on fire
[1:21:45] i wish your soul would catch on fire
[1:21:49] well
[1:21:51] you know how to get set on fire

[1:22:14] are you afraid of the holy ghost brother
[1:22:16] matthew you're preaching like a
[1:22:17] pentecostal well i don't think i'm
[1:22:19] preaching like pentecostalism i'm
[1:22:21] preaching like the original pentecost
[1:22:23] that the message came to restore us back
[1:22:25] to
[1:22:26] they were gathered in the upper room all
[1:22:29] praying in his name and the baptism of
[1:22:31] the holy ghost came in jesus name what
[1:22:34] did it do it changed their language it
[1:22:36] changed their thinking it changed their
[1:22:38] perspective they were in that upper room
[1:22:40] a bunch of cowards backed up and scared
[1:22:43] from the roman soldiers and all the
[1:22:45] sadducees and pharisees but when that
[1:22:47] life that was in our lord was poured out
[1:22:50] into the church all of a sudden they
[1:22:52] come busting out the doors they come
[1:22:54] diving out the windows that's that men
[1:22:55] and brethren these are not drunk as you
[1:22:57] suppose but this is that which was
[1:22:59] promised by the prophet oh hallelujah
[1:23:02] and there is a people that is here in
[1:23:04] bedford texas this morning that have
[1:23:06] been filled with the same power i think
[1:23:09] we ought to act like it i think we ought
[1:23:10] to talk like it i think we ought to
[1:23:12] shout like it i think we ought to live
[1:23:14] like it i think we ought to amen like it
[1:23:18] oh hallelujah
[1:23:20] well glory to god this is where i like
[1:23:23] to live
[1:23:24] i like to live in this presence
[1:23:28] i like to live where all things are
[1:23:30] possible
[1:23:31] i ain't talking about the church house
[1:23:34] i'm talking about in the word
[1:23:35] there's power in the word there's power
[1:23:38] in the message
[1:23:39] there's power in this message
[1:23:43] the word is navy
[1:23:47] even in my mouth
[1:23:49] and in thy heart
[1:23:52] well what did the message come to do
[1:23:53] everyone's going to preach a little bit
[1:23:56] what did the message come to do it come
[1:23:58] to return
[1:23:59] to restore the heart back
[1:24:01] to the original faith then that word
[1:24:04] that you have been restored to
[1:24:06] is in your heart
[1:24:09] but it's also supposed to be where
[1:24:12] in your mouth
[1:24:15] this word look take the book oh
[1:24:17] hallelujah
[1:24:18] eat it up
[1:24:22] thou must prophesy again
[1:24:24] that word that you're feeding on come on
[1:24:26] somebody
[1:24:29] that heart that's been restored
[1:24:31] let's put that word on our lips
[1:24:36] look power and of death and life is in
[1:24:38] the tongue
[1:24:40] and this message
[1:24:41] is a power to take the negative and make
[1:24:44] it a positive
[1:24:46] but go what is god wanting to do he
[1:24:47] wants to hear you talk
[1:24:49] well i don't know where we're going now
[1:24:52] when the children of israel entered into
[1:24:54] the promised land
[1:24:57] they come to jericho
[1:25:00] yeah they marched around seven days and
[1:25:01] seven times on the last days
[1:25:04] but what was the final act that brought
[1:25:06] the walls down
[1:25:10] what was the final thing the prophet
[1:25:12] told him that joshua told him to do
[1:25:16] he said after you fulfilled all the word
[1:25:20] after you've repented of your sins
[1:25:23] after you've been baptized in the name
[1:25:25] of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:27] after you've done all that i've
[1:25:29] commanded you to do i want you to shout
[1:25:33] and watch the walls come down oh i don't
[1:25:36] know what walls you're facing this
[1:25:37] morning i don't know what problems
[1:25:39] you're going through but god wants to
[1:25:41] hear you put that word on your mouth and
[1:25:44] say satan give way in the name of jesus
[1:25:46] christ
[1:25:47] oh well let me just say it for the
[1:25:49] prophet since i'm a little too fanatical
[1:25:51] for you
[1:25:53] since i'm just a little little too much
[1:25:55] and it's little old matthew but since we
[1:25:57] all believe the prophet we all press
[1:25:58] play and obey let's just read it from
[1:26:00] him
[1:26:02] the promise is yours but if you ever get
[1:26:04] it it ain't going to be easy i'm going
[1:26:06] to tell you that you're going to have to
[1:26:08] take it away from satan satan captures
[1:26:10] your health
[1:26:15] help me now
[1:26:17] satan captures real you got a right to
[1:26:19] say satan
[1:26:21] you got a right to say
[1:26:25] see that wasn't my words you thought
[1:26:27] those were my words you thought i was
[1:26:29] taking some some historical uh story and
[1:26:32] trying to make something no no this is
[1:26:34] this is something that we have received
[1:26:36] by a vindicated prophet he's the one
[1:26:39] that changes your thinking he's the one
[1:26:41] that takes the negative and makes it a
[1:26:42] positive the vision that comes to the
[1:26:44] prophet becomes your reality
[1:26:47] oh
[1:26:48] oh i feel good about that one
[1:26:51] the vision that came to the prophet
[1:26:53] becomes your reality
[1:26:57] oh oh my
[1:26:59] thank you congress congressman upshaw
[1:27:07] he was sitting there up in the balcony
[1:27:09] christian man who had been believing who
[1:27:11] said never give up
[1:27:15] and i believe another thing he would
[1:27:16] always say is i'm going to get healed
[1:27:18] but it's not time yet
[1:27:20] and it took a profit
[1:27:22] to stand there and that could go into
[1:27:24] congressman upshaw's past
[1:27:27] that could come to his present but he
[1:27:29] could also go into his future

[1:27:34] message a vindicated prophet that could
[1:27:37] go into your past that could go into the
[1:27:39] present but he also went into your
[1:27:44] future he told you where you come from
[1:27:48] oh i think that went over you
[1:27:50] he told you where you come from
[1:27:53] he told you where you're living
[1:27:56] and he told you where you're going the
[1:27:59] prophet's vision is your reality that's
[1:28:02] why you can stand in the face of hell
[1:28:05] raging on this planet in every demonic
[1:28:08] way and you can stand there and say this

[1:34:13] as there are people in the house of god
[1:34:15] that are free
[1:34:17] well i can just imagine on that day you
[1:34:20] know they had what they called a jubilee
[1:34:21] year
[1:34:23] and some of the young ones that were
[1:34:24] stronger you know they would climb up to
[1:34:26] the top of the mountain and what were
[1:34:28] they doing they were looking for the
[1:34:29] rising of the sun
[1:34:32] and when they would give up on the very
[1:34:33] top of the mountain they were looking
[1:34:36] for the rising of the sun and just as
[1:34:39] soon as they got a glimpse of the
[1:34:42] sunlight what was it it was their
[1:34:45] jubilee
[1:34:46] and god has sent us a prophet an eagle
[1:34:49] anointing that swore into the heavenlies
[1:34:51] and he looked out on there and he said
[1:34:54] it is the rising of the sun this is the
[1:34:58] year of jubilee throw down your hoe you
[1:35:01] don't have to be a task master anymore
[1:35:04] you don't have to be in bondage to that
[1:35:06] anymore come on i'm talking about
[1:35:08] freedom you think they all drop their
[1:35:10] hole in me like this
[1:35:12] we're free man it was a it was a tough
[1:35:15] few years in bondage
[1:35:17] oh my oh
[1:35:19] that's not what i did
[1:35:22] does somebody know what i'm talking
[1:35:23] about how did you act when you got
[1:35:25] delivered i don't care if if you were at
[1:35:27] a camp or in a church look i know where
[1:35:30] i was i was in my car i started active
[1:35:33] full i started breaking things i started
[1:35:35] getting rid of things all the peace of
[1:35:36] god come over my heart i couldn't stand
[1:35:38] still i had to tell everybody about it
[1:35:41] but one thing i knew i was three and who
[1:35:44] the son of god has made free is free
[1:35:48] indeed are you free this morning well
[1:35:50] then why don't you talk like it why
[1:35:52] don't you shout like it why don't you
[1:35:54] act like it i'm talking about
[1:35:56] stimulation we might be here a little
[1:35:58] bit a while
[1:35:59] i'm talking about stimulation of
[1:36:01] revelation
[1:36:03] trying to get a drunk man a man drunk
[1:36:05] and see what he does
[1:36:06] yeah and the prophet of god said
[1:36:08] revelation does you the same way
[1:36:10] the stimulation of revelation will make
[1:36:13] you act the same way as a drunk man a
[1:36:15] drunk man just gets so lost he don't
[1:36:18] even care who's around him he don't care
[1:36:20] what else is going on i wonder if
[1:36:22] there's somebody else in the house of
[1:36:24] god that'll just stop and forget about
[1:36:27] who's around you and what everything
[1:36:28] else is going on and you'd open up your
[1:36:30] heart and you would receive the word and
[1:36:32] realize that you don't have to sit under
[1:36:34] that oppression anymore that you can be
[1:36:37] set free with a joy in your heart to
[1:36:40] serve god every single day
[1:36:43] i'm talking about free
[1:36:45] i'm talking about freedom
[1:36:48] is there a people that have gathered in
[1:36:50] the house of god that are free
[1:36:53] well that sounds a little more like it
[1:36:55] now we can move on
[1:36:57] you pass that test
[1:37:01] oh glory to god
[1:37:03] look friends there's a power here this
[1:37:05] morning
[1:37:09] to turn your heart
[1:37:10] to change your body
[1:37:12] but it don't do no good on the outside
[1:37:15] don't do good no good to feel it in
[1:37:16] church don't do no good just to feel it
[1:37:19] at camp doesn't do no good to fill it at
[1:37:21] special services but you want that holy
[1:37:23] ghost
[1:37:25] that can lift you up into a heavenly
[1:37:27] sphere
[1:37:28] and you feel so free and you feel so
[1:37:30] clean and you go back home and you
[1:37:32] wonder why you falter and fail look
[1:37:35] let me tell that old devil to shut up
[1:37:38] it's for you
[1:37:40] that's in the name of the lord the holy
[1:37:42] ghost is for you
[1:37:44] god is showing you that there's more of
[1:37:46] the holy ghost for you to receive
[1:37:52] look i i'm just preaching what a
[1:37:53] vindicated prophet gave me
[1:37:56] this ain't my ideas
[1:37:58] this ain't my thoughts
[1:38:00] this is the message of the hour
[1:38:02] jesus will say if thou can't believe all
[1:38:05] things are possible
[1:38:07] to him that believeth
[1:38:08] look with men it's impossible
[1:38:11] but with god

[1:38:25] tape brother branham's discerning the
[1:38:27] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:38:30] and while he's discerning the heart
[1:38:31] while the word is going forth
[1:38:35] while the word is discerning your very
[1:38:37] thought of your heart and where you're
[1:38:39] living at
[1:38:42] you have to respond to that and say amen
[1:38:46] because while the prophet was preaching
[1:38:48] while he was discerning the thoughts of
[1:38:50] the
[1:38:50] of ours he says you missed it

[1:39:34] the prophecy of the brown bear
[1:39:38] unfolded just the way
[1:39:41] the prophet received the vision
[1:39:46] but the prophet wasn't in position
[1:39:50] for the manifestation of it he failed to
[1:39:54] be in position
[1:39:56] see and we need to get and what what did
[1:39:58] he say and the vision
[1:40:00] passed him by and he was left standing
[1:40:03] there

[1:40:06] get right
[1:40:07] or we're going to get left standing

[1:40:23] we want to respond to the word and say
[1:40:26] yea and amen that is for me because i
[1:40:30] don't want to miss it i want to hear
[1:40:32] god's call and i want to respond to it
[1:40:38] what did you pass up look here's the
[1:40:40] good thing about the word of god
[1:40:41] that wasn't your only chance to serve
[1:40:43] notice on the devil
[1:40:45] brother matthew you got worked up and
[1:40:46] you were just running and screaming and
[1:40:47] shouting
[1:40:49] this is your chance
[1:40:51] this is your opportunity
[1:40:54] this is the word
[1:40:56] you can serve notice on the devil
[1:41:01] the word's coming to you
[1:41:03] why don't you respond to it
[1:41:06] claim them speak it
[1:41:09] look those walls will come down
[1:41:12] what do you have need of
[1:41:16] satan i come to serve notice on you
[1:41:22] you got something welling up in your
[1:41:23] heart you got something you're believing
[1:41:24] for
[1:41:25] come on
[1:41:28] well let faith go to work
[1:41:30] let faith go into action
[1:41:33] express it the word is naive in my mouth
[1:41:36] and even on your heart look the
[1:41:37] scripture says and while peter yet spake
[1:41:40] these words the holy ghost fell on them
[1:41:42] look jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:41:46] today and forever he said this promises
[1:41:48] unto you and unto your children and them
[1:41:51] that are afar off i want to tell you you
[1:41:53] must respond to god's call
[1:41:59] look in genesis 12 that god called
[1:42:02] abraham
[1:42:03] he called abraham because god wanted to
[1:42:05] call abraham god has called you because
[1:42:07] he wanted to call you it wasn't about
[1:42:09] what abraham done it wasn't about what
[1:42:11] you can do but this is god's choosing
[1:42:13] what do you say i have chosen you
[1:42:15] according as he has chosen you before
[1:42:18] the foundation of the world that you
[1:42:20] should be holy and blameless
[1:42:23] who did that
[1:42:25] now i'm trying to to increase your faith
[1:42:28] i'm trying to to bring you to a place
[1:42:30] that god is doing something uh first
[1:42:33] peter 4 12 says beloved thinking not
[1:42:35] strange concerning the fiery trials
[1:42:36] which is to try you as though some
[1:42:38] strange things happen to you now we're
[1:42:40] going to try to
[1:42:41] focus down here for a little bit along
[1:42:43] these lines
[1:42:46] he says beloved thinking not strange
[1:42:48] concerning the fiery trials the the the
[1:42:50] fiery trials which is to try you
[1:42:52] as though some strange thing happened
[1:42:54] unto you
[1:42:55] see that's that's where we get ourselves
[1:42:57] in trouble
[1:42:58] we think it's so strange
[1:43:01] we're so confounded and dumbfounded god
[1:43:04] why would this ever have to happen
[1:43:09] and we just can't fathom it in our brain
[1:43:13] well god has it all in control
[1:43:16] he says
[1:43:18] but rejoice
[1:43:22] well there's a key but rejoice in so
[1:43:26] much as ye are partakers of christ's
[1:43:28] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[1:43:30] revealed you may be glad also with
[1:43:33] exceeding joy
[1:43:36] now i'd like to think about job for a
[1:43:38] little bit you know job did not have a
[1:43:40] clue of what was going on
[1:43:43] the fiery trials came at joe i tell you
[1:43:45] did they ever come at him
[1:43:48] none of us have ever faced what job had
[1:43:50] to face
[1:43:52] job didn't know what was going on
[1:43:54] job didn't know that there was a
[1:43:56] conversation in heaven between him and
[1:43:58] and the devil concerning him
[1:44:00] he didn't know that that god was up
[1:44:02] there saying hey have you considered my
[1:44:04] servant job that there is none like him
[1:44:06] in all the earth an upright man and
[1:44:08] perfect in his generation that issue of
[1:44:10] evil
[1:44:12] he didn't realize that there was words
[1:44:14] spoken of job and i just want to go on
[1:44:16] record to say this
[1:44:18] that if god had spoke that of job then
[1:44:20] there was nothing that job could do
[1:44:23] to change what god had spoken
[1:44:27] don't you realize that god got it all
[1:44:29] wrapped up
[1:44:30] with a pretty little bow on it god has
[1:44:32] already spoken on your behalf that you
[1:44:35] can't fail that you're predestinated not
[1:44:37] to miss it that you were chosen before
[1:44:39] the foundation of the world that your
[1:44:41] name was put in the lands book of life
[1:44:43] god was speaking the very victory
[1:44:45] concerning job and the devil took the
[1:44:47] bait
[1:44:50] glory to god because god had placed a
[1:44:53] mystery on the inside of job that the
[1:44:57] devil didn't know about even job didn't
[1:45:00] know about that there was something that
[1:45:02] had been deposited inside a job that no
[1:45:05] matter how bad the trial got
[1:45:08] no matter how much he lost
[1:45:11] no matter how much he wanted to give up
[1:45:14] there was an anchor there was something
[1:45:17] inside of job that before job could
[1:45:19] speak he would speak
[1:45:22] oh he lost all of his family he had lost
[1:45:25] all of his children all of his loved
[1:45:27] ones and everything was taken away and
[1:45:31] when it seemed like the devil had him
[1:45:33] right where if i could get a little more
[1:45:34] on the monitors it seemed like the devil
[1:45:36] had him right where he wanted him
[1:45:40] i got him now
[1:45:42] i got you right where i want you
[1:45:47] you're discouraged
[1:45:50] you don't know what's going to happen
[1:45:52] you're all you're all in turmoil and
[1:45:55] you're sad and you don't know what the
[1:45:57] future's going to hold and the devil's
[1:45:59] saying i got you you turn it down just a
[1:46:01] little i got you right where i want you
[1:46:05] and just when it seemed like the devil
[1:46:07] would have been telling all of his ips
[1:46:09] look at him i got him right where i want
[1:46:11] him he's on the ash heap he's about to
[1:46:13] throw in the towel he's about to wave
[1:46:16] wave the flag and there he was sitting
[1:46:19] down there on the ash sheep and all of a
[1:46:20] sudden he got up
[1:46:25] and the devil said look at him boys
[1:46:27] he's throwing in the white towel
[1:46:30] and he lift his head up his head oh
[1:46:32] blessed be
[1:46:34] the name of the lord the lord giveth and
[1:46:38] the lord taketh away
[1:46:40] though he slay me yet i'll trust him oh
[1:46:45] i wonder if the praise of job didn't
[1:46:48] shake the foundations of hell because it
[1:46:51] was a revelation that god had placed
[1:46:53] there that in the face of the trial in
[1:46:56] the face of the storm it come pouring
[1:46:58] out in praise unto god
[1:47:01] oh
[1:47:03] is there a praise
[1:47:06] in the bride of jesus christ
[1:47:08] that you can pour out to god that could
[1:47:10] say this is the lord's doing
[1:47:15] this is the lord's to it
[1:47:18] and it's marvelous in our eyes
[1:47:23] oh hallelujah
[1:47:25] well i'ma preach a little longer
[1:47:30] god wants to encourage you this morning
[1:47:34] look there was something in job
[1:47:37] that job didn't even know about joe
[1:47:39] didn't even know it was going to happen
[1:47:41] you know i was thinking on this and i
[1:47:42] got to thinking about brother brother
[1:47:43] biscuit
[1:47:46] you know brother biscuit was on that
[1:47:47] hunt they had been hearing the vision
[1:47:49] told the whole trip
[1:47:51] they were excited about the vision they
[1:47:52] were excited about the word of god
[1:47:55] typically when you're excited about
[1:47:56] something you talk about it
[1:48:02] so when the word of the lord had come to
[1:48:03] the prophet and he said because the
[1:48:05] vision is what it's thus saith the lord
[1:48:07] cannot fail
[1:48:10] so they were excited about thus saith
[1:48:12] the lord
[1:48:13] so you don't have to worry church
[1:48:16] we have thus saith the lord
[1:48:19] so they could be excited about the
[1:48:21] promises of god
[1:48:23] so they would pick up somebody to go on
[1:48:24] the trip like hey brother brandon tell
[1:48:25] them the vision yeah we were up there
[1:48:27] you know and there's there's there's a
[1:48:28] we shot a caribou and and you know we we
[1:48:31] shot it was laying on the ground i saw
[1:48:32] some of these young's hands going like
[1:48:33] this and it measured i believe 72 what
[1:48:35] was it 42 42 inches santa just measured
[1:48:38] it and his hand went up like this and
[1:48:40] they were like well you know we don't
[1:48:41] see anybody
[1:48:43] young on the trip yet but as they went
[1:48:45] along somebody couldn't make it somebody
[1:48:47] got back on and they get up and now
[1:48:49] they're in the hunt now they're in the
[1:48:50] battle
[1:48:51] now they're in the fulfillment of the
[1:48:53] vision but many times when you're
[1:48:54] walking in the vision you you become uh
[1:48:57] surrounded by by the the difficulties of
[1:49:00] the of the high you become surrounded by
[1:49:03] the difficulties of the journey and you
[1:49:05] start to lose sight of thus saith the
[1:49:06] lord and you forget why you're even
[1:49:08] there
[1:49:09] many times we forget why we're even here
[1:49:12] we forget why god has placed us in this
[1:49:15] hour for this purpose because there is a
[1:49:18] mystery inside of you that god wants to
[1:49:21] bring in the manifestation look god
[1:49:23] wants to use you to whoop the devil
[1:49:26] that's the way god ordained it he wants
[1:49:29] to use you to whoop the devil to take
[1:49:32] him at his word and say devil i come to
[1:49:35] serve notice on you
[1:49:38] we ain't no push down backing up
[1:49:41] skimpy bride that doesn't know where she
[1:49:43] stands we got thus saith the lord
[1:49:48] brother biscuit's walking in the vision
[1:49:50] and he's trying to keep up i can't
[1:49:52] remember forgive me you know you know
[1:49:53] better than me but he's gone he's coming
[1:49:54] over log
[1:49:55] and he trips and gets in the water
[1:49:58] and he's oh my goodness
[1:49:59] i got to catch up i'm cold i'm going to
[1:50:01] go change and he's opening up the back
[1:50:03] and there in that back it's like why did
[1:50:06] my wife
[1:50:07] put that old tattered green and uh
[1:50:09] yellow checkered shirt back and i can't
[1:50:11] believe it oh well that's what i got i
[1:50:13] told her to throw that away and she
[1:50:14] patches it up oh well she throws it on
[1:50:17] and he starts to go
[1:50:19] and he catches up and there's all of a
[1:50:21] sudden they're looking
[1:50:23] at the caribou laying there and all of a
[1:50:25] sudden their hands go up and brother ant
[1:50:28] says oh i have great empathy for the
[1:50:30] disciples to think that you're walking
[1:50:32] in the fulfillment you're walking in the
[1:50:34] manifestation of the vision and you've
[1:50:37] totally lost sight of what you're doing
[1:50:40] and he said but when that hand went all
[1:50:42] of a sudden all of a sudden he
[1:50:43] remembered the vision and realized the
[1:50:46] vision is now in manifestation and there
[1:50:49] he was standing in the vision wearing
[1:50:52] the green and yellow checkered shirt
[1:50:54] that was prophesied to be there
[1:50:57] see what he hallelujah
[1:51:00] it'll make you look at a green and
[1:51:01] yellow chuckled shirt differently it'll
[1:51:04] make you look at your trial differently
[1:51:06] you think you fell off the log you think
[1:51:08] you got wet you think you just got to
[1:51:10] change your clothes you're all
[1:51:11] disgruntled and you're all flustered
[1:51:13] because of the trial you're going
[1:51:15] through but it's god bringing his vision
[1:51:18] into manifestation oh what a victory to
[1:51:21] the bride of jesus christ if you could

[1:58:56] my flesh
[1:58:58] those are skin worms eat my flesh though

[1:59:06] i will stand and see my redeemer and all
[1:59:10] of the trial
[1:59:11] and all of the temptation and all of the
[1:59:14] storm there was a revelation
[1:59:16] that sprung forth and said this is the
[1:59:18] lord's doing and it's marvelous oh let's
[1:59:22] stand
[1:59:24] in our eyes
[1:59:27] it might look dark
[1:59:31] you might feel like job

[1:59:45] look if you didn't come from come for
[1:59:47] something this morning
[1:59:48] that don't mean you can't get nothing
[1:59:56] maybe your vision maybe your angle has
[1:59:57] been changed
[2:00:00] maybe you've been in the journey
[2:00:02] and you've lost sight
[2:00:04] of what you're doing but you didn't even
[2:00:05] realize
[2:00:07] that you're walking right in the
[2:00:08] manifestation of the vision for your
[2:00:10] life
[2:00:11] yeah god knew you'd be sitting there in
[2:00:12] that shirt
[2:00:14] he knew you'd be wearing that color
[2:00:16] he'd be sitting on that side
[2:00:18] he knew this would be the moment he knew
[2:00:20] you'd respond to the call
[2:00:23] see it's in the midst of the trial and
[2:00:25] in the storm
[2:00:26] we have thus saith the lord that good's
[2:00:28] coming all things work together for the
[2:00:29] good there's none good but god and god
[2:00:31] is in his word and the word is naive
[2:00:33] even in my mouth and in my heart
[2:00:36] bring it from your heart put it on your
[2:00:37] lips
[2:00:39] look the prophet said we look at things
[2:00:42] that we do not see
[2:00:43] for abraham called those things which
[2:00:45] were not as though they were because he
[2:00:47] believed in god
[2:00:53] he called those things that were not
[2:00:56] as though they were
[2:00:58] if there is anybody
[2:01:01] on the face of this earth that can call
[2:01:03] things
[2:01:04] that are not
[2:01:06] as though they are it's you and this
[2:01:09] moment and this atmosphere where all
[2:01:12] things are possible you can put that
[2:01:14] word on your lips and start speaking
[2:01:17] things that are not in existence as
[2:01:20] though they are right now speak the word
[2:01:25] why cry brad speak
[2:01:28] you could play something softly
[2:01:32] see it just takes a little change of
[2:01:34] perspective
[2:01:38] faith
[2:01:40] has long-range vision
[2:01:43] faith
[2:01:44] is the master
[2:01:46] of all circumstances
[2:01:48] faith is a divine revelation
[2:01:54] jesus had perfect faith
[2:01:56] and it come because he was the word
[2:01:59] and you become the word
[2:02:02] you become the word as you receive the
[2:02:04] word if you abide in me and my words in
[2:02:07] you
[2:02:08] this word abides in you that you will
[2:02:10] ask and it will be done for you if you
[2:02:13] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[2:02:14] doubt but believe what you've said
[2:02:19] what you've said the reason it hasn't
[2:02:21] happened maybe it's because you haven't
[2:02:22] spoken how can you believe what when you
[2:02:26] haven't even spoken it but why don't you
[2:02:28] speak it and let faith lay hold of it
[2:02:31] faith cometh by hearing the word i
[2:02:33] wonder if faith needs to hear it out of
[2:02:35] your own mouth well we're on shouting
[2:02:37] grounds now
[2:02:39] the lord like that
[2:02:42] faith wants to hear it out of your own
[2:02:44] mouth
[2:02:46] thou
[2:02:47] must prophesy again abraham where is the
[2:02:51] seeds of abraham that call things that
[2:02:54] are not as though they are start
[2:02:55] speaking church watch those walls come
[2:02:58] down watch the very desires of your
[2:03:00] heart coming to manifestation
[2:03:05] god has it all in control
[2:03:09] look it's hard to understand the pain
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] it's hard to understand the hurt
[2:03:15] it's hard to understand the suffering
[2:03:22] it's hard the lord knows it's hard
[2:03:26] when that great sculpture takes out the
[2:03:28] hammer and he starts to
[2:03:30] chisel away that character
[2:03:33] starts to bring you into the vision he
[2:03:35] had for your life
[2:03:37] to bring you into that perfect image
[2:03:40] doesn't feel good
[2:03:43] but there's a revelation that's coming
[2:03:44] into your heart now to realize that this
[2:03:46] is the lord's doing
[2:03:51] it's the tender hand of jehovah
[2:03:55] it's the tender hand of jehovah
[2:03:57] see brother matthew how can you say that
[2:04:01] a prophet would say
[2:04:03] that some slaughter of six million jews
[2:04:07] and the holocaust
[2:04:09] the mailing of women and children
[2:04:13] by the millions
[2:04:16] was the tender hand
[2:04:18] of jehovah
[2:04:20] leading them back
[2:04:22] to the promised land
[2:04:25] don't you realize that same god can take
[2:04:27] your trial
[2:04:29] he can take your hurt
[2:04:31] he could take your pain
[2:04:33] he could take what you're going through
[2:04:35] see revelation takes the negative
[2:04:39] i know you were hurt when you were a
[2:04:40] child

[2:04:51] that's ready to grab a hold of the
[2:04:53] negative
