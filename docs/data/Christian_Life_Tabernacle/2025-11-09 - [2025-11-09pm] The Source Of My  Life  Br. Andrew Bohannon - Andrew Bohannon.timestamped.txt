[8:54] Let's
[8:57] bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly
[8:59] father, Lord, we're so thankful and
[9:02] grateful to be gathered in your house
[9:03] once more, Lord Jesus.
[9:06] We want to give this time that we'll

[9:11] Jesus, that it may be a time of
[9:13] blessing, Lord, deliverance, Lord,
[9:16] healing, that your word may just have
[9:18] full preeminence, Lord Jesus, to do as
[9:21] you see fit. Father, we're a needy

[9:26] storehouse, to this house, Father, to
[9:29] hear from you, Lord Jesus. speak to each
[9:32] and every single person that's made the
[9:34] sacrifice to be in the house today. And
[9:36] for ones that weren't able to and are at

[9:41] Father, that you may drop down and visit
[9:42] them, Lord Jesus. Give them a special
[9:45] blessing, Father, and the opportunity to
[9:47] be in your house, Father. We leave the

[10:03] their midst you'll be. Father, we know
[10:05] who's here, Lord Jesus. And when you're
[10:08] here, Father,
[10:10] what can stand against, Lord Jesus? What
[10:13] problems or situation could we have that
[10:15] we couldn't answer, Lord? The King of
[10:17] Kings is here, Lord. All our problems

[22:26] remember our pastor, brother David,
[22:27] sister Leslie in Arizona. Pray that
[22:30] they'll be back tomorrow. So we pray
[22:32] that the Lord will give them traveling
[22:33] mercy. Uh but I think brother [music]
[22:36] Paul is with them.

[22:40] want to remember him, that the Lord will

[22:55] pray for the over the request the
[22:57] brothers that are taking the request uh
[22:59] the offerings if you can come. [music]
[23:00] Amen.
[23:18] I guess the scripture says, "Let others
[23:21] speak well of you." But I think you
[23:23] could remember when brother David was
[23:25] given his testimony about the car. And
[23:29] uh how he had pulled over on the side of
[23:32] the road and the best I would say, I'm
[23:34] pretty sure the Lord did the miraculous.
[23:36] He probably was running a car without
[23:38] oil and it sounded like your engine was
[23:41] probably froze up, not the transmission,
[23:43] but you were testifying to what the Lord
[23:45] did and a brother Timothy Miller was
[23:47] watching that and they were in the
[23:50] middle of their own trials with their
[23:52] car and it wasn't they they're having
[23:55] car trouble and they wanted me to just
[23:56] pass on at that time and I even shared
[23:58] it how much they appreciated the
[24:01] testimony
[24:03] and uh and I could even just kind of
[24:05] read that But he uh
[24:09] and I might as well said, you know, this
[24:11] is the confidentiality of text messages
[24:14] nowadays. They end up on the internet.
[24:17] Brother David, yesterday morning at your
[24:19] church, a young brother gave his
[24:20] testimony about his car. While I was
[24:24] shampooing carpets, I had been listening
[24:26] to Revelations chapter 4, part three
[24:29] after turning on yesterday's morning
[24:31] service and heard his testimony. We've
[24:33] been going around and around with
[24:35] vehicle issues. Please tell him what a
[24:37] blessing his testimony was to me.
[24:40] Absolutely. We passed that on. And last
[24:43] night, he sends this yesterday morning.
[24:46] He said, "Last night, my boss wanted
[24:49] Ashley and I to come over to talk with
[24:53] him and his wife. When we got there,
[24:56] this was in his driveway." And he said,
[24:58] "Merry Christmas." And he shared a
[24:59] picture of a minivan.
[25:02] And uh you know, you just trust God,
[25:05] he's got the answer. You give him the
[25:07] glory. And you know, he he's mighty on
[25:09] our behalfs. And I think just with that
[25:12] and these needs that have been spoken,
[25:14] we can just go to the Lord and bring him
[25:16] in prayer. And the testimony is is I
[25:19] know a provider.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; He knows what we have need of and he'll
[25:23] supply above what we can ask or think.
[25:25] And inside of you is the power to ask
[25:28] and to testify and and uh receive what
[25:31] you have need of. And let's just go
[25:33] before him. Gracious heavenly father,
[25:36] how thankful we are to come to a
[25:38] heavenly father. Lord, who knows what we
[25:41] have need of before we could ask. Lord,
[25:44] and we don't come with merit. We have
[25:47] nothing to bring.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. We're simply recipients
[25:53] of unmmerited favor and grace. Lord, a
[25:56] price that's been paid that's complete.
[25:58] [music]
[25:59] Calvary accomplished it all. It's
[26:02] accomplished redemption in our body,
[26:04] Lord, [music] in in our spirit that we
[26:06] could sit in heavenly places in Christ
[26:08] Jesus. We've simply been made
[26:10] participants [music] of something you've
[26:12] purchased,
[26:14] Lord. And we want to come with
[26:15] confidence in that, Lord. The price
[26:18] wasn't paid in vain, Lord, but you told
[26:21] us to come boldly before the throne of
[26:23] grace and bring our petitions that we
[26:25] could receive, Lord. And we're asking
[26:27] for great things, Lord. That those who
[26:29] sit in darkness and bound in darkness,
[26:31] their eyes would become open, Lord, to
[26:34] see you in the power of your
[26:35] resurrection, Lord. The needs in the
[26:38] body, Lord, that they healing would be
[26:40] manifested, Lord. We thank you for your
[26:42] contining [music] continued healing
[26:44] touch on Lucas, Lord. Father, to see us
[26:48] smile, to see him up and moving, Lord,
[26:50] we ask you to just continue to heal him,
[26:53] Father. Lord, the needs that were
[26:55] spoken, the tests that are to come,
[26:56] Lord, we're looking to you and your
[26:58] promises, Father. Even now, tonight,
[27:01] Lord, may each one just become aware of
[27:03] your presence. [music] Lord, as you
[27:05] would come, soften the hardest of
[27:06] hearts, Lord. May your presence just
[27:09] prepare the ground, Lord. thankful
[27:11] hearts giving you grace, praise and
[27:14] thanksgiving, Lord, just to even be here
[27:16] in your house tonight.
[27:19] May our worship be pleasing to you,
[27:20] Father, Lord. And as your word comes,
[27:25] it'll accomplish that which you've sent
[27:27] it. We give you the praise, Lord,
[27:29] committing it to you. Thank you for this
[27:31] privilege once again to bring our
[27:33] request before you. [music] We love you,
[27:36] Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[27:38] pray. Amen.

[30:02] Oh,

[30:08] done.
[30:13] Oh, and it's already [singing and music]
[30:15] done.
[30:20] Oh, [music]
[30:20] and the battle is over.
[30:25] Victory. [music and singing]
[30:33] Hallelujah.
[30:34] Amen. Sister Jun has a special voice.
[30:37] Amen.
[31:06] God bless you.
[31:09] Just singing my favorite song again. So
[31:11] sing it with me.
[31:24] There is a blood
[31:28] that cost a life [singing]
[31:32] that paid my way.
[31:37] death its price.
[31:42] When it flowed
[31:45] down [singing and music] from the cross,
[31:49] my sins were gone.
[31:54] My sin [singing]
[31:55] [music] forgot.
[31:58] There is a grave
[32:02] that tried [music and singing]
[32:03] to hide
[32:06] this precious blood
[32:10] that gave me life.
[32:15] But [singing] in three days
[32:19] he breathed [music] again
[32:23] and rose to stand
[32:27] in my [singing] defense. [music]
[32:32] So I come
[32:35] to tell you he's alive.
[32:37] [music and singing]
[32:39] to tell you that he dries
[32:43] every [singing] tear that falls.
[32:48] So I come
[32:51] to tell you that he saves,
[32:55] to [music] shout, and [singing] to
[32:57] proclaim
[32:58] that he's coming back for you.
[33:04] There is a blood
[33:08] that [singing] sightes the blind.
[33:12] It heals the sick, [singing and music]
[33:16] the lonely find.
[33:19] [music]
[33:20] It has the power
[33:24] to [music] free the bound
[33:28] as chains they fall [singing]
[33:32] upon [music] the ground.
[33:36] So pour it out
[33:40] to cleanse [music and singing] my soul
[33:44] and let his liquid
[33:49] [music] glory [singing]
[33:50] flow
[33:53] because it lives
[33:57] to make me [music] whole.
[34:01] I [singing] owe my life.
[34:05] I owe my all. [singing]
[34:09] [music] So I come
[34:12] to tell you he's alive.
[34:14] [music and singing]
[34:16] To tell you that he dries
[34:21] every tear [music and singing] that
[34:22] falls.
[34:25] So I come
[34:28] to tell [singing] you that he [music]
[34:30] saves,
[34:32] to shout and to proclaim
[34:36] that he's [music and singing] coming
[34:37] back for you.
[34:42] This life,
[34:46] [music] this price,
[34:48] [singing]
[34:50] this blood,
[34:54] this one,
[34:58] this [singing and music] life.
[35:02] He paid.
[35:05] He paid the price
[35:09] with precious blood. [music]
[35:13] There is a grave
[35:17] that tried [singing] to hide
[35:20] [music]
[35:21] this precious blood
[35:25] that [music] gave [singing] me life.
[35:30] God in three days.
[35:33] [music]
[35:33] He [singing] breathed again
[35:38] and rose to stand
[35:41] [music] in my defense. [singing]
[35:46] [music] So I come
[35:49] to tell you he's alive.
[35:53] to tell you that he dries [singing]
[35:57] [music] every tear that falls.
[36:02] So [singing and music] I come
[36:05] to tell you that he saves
[36:09] to shout and to [music] proclaim
[36:12] [singing] that he's coming back for you.
[36:27] Hallelujah.
[36:30] Hallelujah.
[36:31] That blood will never lose his power.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; A man who forgives past, present, and
[36:37] future sins. It's taken care of all of
[36:40] it. There's no sin question anymore.
[36:42] He's completely taken care of it. Oh my.
[36:45] If we can only believe what he promised
[36:47] and stand by what he said, amen, it will
[36:50] come to pass. Amen. Let's all stand at
[36:53] this time. Let's sing that song, Our God
[36:55] Reigns. As we get ready to invite
[36:58] Brother Andrew at this time, I believe
[37:00] it's a Amen.
[37:04] A lonely [singing] arber
[37:14] [singing]
[37:15] [music]
[37:21] [music]
[37:22] good news.
[37:27] Oh,
[37:34] oh, [singing]
[37:35] I now sing peace.
[37:41] Oh, [music] and proclaiming
[37:44] news
[37:45] of happiness. [music and singing]
[37:50] Oh, and I got grace. [music]
[37:58] Oh, I [singing] got [music]
[38:06] Oh, [music and singing] I got
[38:22] Father God, [music]
[38:29] I got
[38:32] you [music] sing it as your father this
[38:34] time. Oh, and I
[38:38] [music] got you.
[38:41] Oh, [singing] and he came
[38:44] with [music] grace
[38:46] and majesty.
[38:50] Oh
[38:52] Jesus.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:58] Oh [music]
[38:59] Jesus.
[39:05] [music]
[39:06] God loves us.
[39:10] [music]
[39:12] He
[39:14] is.
[39:22] Yes. [music]
[39:28] [music]
[39:29] He's
[39:37] [music]
[39:45] [music]
[39:46] the
[39:52] Jesus.
[39:54] [music]
[39:59] Jesus.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful he's alive? [music]
[40:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to be here tonight and be in
[40:10] fellowship with you once again and to
[40:13] think about this morning's service. So
[40:15] my what a refreshing moments in time
[40:18] that God can come by our way and
[40:21] strengthen us to give us that
[40:23] understanding that we have a resource.
[40:26] We have a source of life. Amen. We just
[40:30] want to follow right behind our brother
[40:32] and maybe just have a few minutes uh
[40:35] fellowship. It probably won't be long,
[40:37] but we just want the Lord to have his
[40:39] way and we want the Lord to be able to
[40:42] deal with our hearts where we're at in
[40:44] our season. He's the only one that can
[40:46] do that. Amen. God is the only one that
[40:49] can know exactly what your need is.
[40:52] Amen. I believe I need more of him. How
[40:54] many would agree with me tonight and
[40:56] say, "God, speak to me because it's you
[40:59] that I need." Amen. [music]
[41:01] Let's go to the Lord together in prayer.
[41:04] Our precious heavenly father.
[41:06] Lord, here we are, Lord.
[41:09] Testimonies and songs have gone forth,
[41:12] Lord. And it's our earnest desire, the
[41:16] Father, that you would once again come.
[41:18] And Lord, you'd make yourself known, oh
[41:21] God, and you've chose this way by the
[41:25] foolishness of preaching, Lord, that we
[41:28] can, oh God, receive from you. [music]
[41:31] And so, Father, you see the needs and
[41:33] the desire upon your children. Father,
[41:36] we just we ask that you would meet it.
[41:39] Lord, meet the need, Lord, that when we
[41:41] leave here, Lord, they can have a
[41:44] greater assurance of what they have in
[41:46] you, Father. Lord, I need you, Lord. You
[41:49] see my heart, Lord, how I, oh God, long,
[41:52] oh God, to just give this time to you
[41:55] and that you would, oh God, magnify it
[41:58] and let it be food in season for your
[42:00] people. as we humbly ask oh God that you
[42:04] would take control from beginning to end
[42:07] for the upbuilding of [music] your
[42:08] kingdom. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[42:13] Amen. While you're standing, if you want
[42:15] to turn with me in the book of Romans,
[42:17] we'll read um chapter 8.
[42:22] Just wanted to share this thought about
[42:25] the source of my life. And by the end of
[42:28] the service, I want it to be the source
[42:30] of our life.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; We have a source of life. Amen.
[42:36] In Romans chapter 8 and verse 5, it says
[42:40] [snorts]
[42:41] [clears throat] and I'll wait you until
[42:42] you get there. And you can say amen if
[42:44] you get there.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:47] The scripture says, "For they that are
[42:50] after the flesh do mind the things of
[42:53] the flesh, but they that are after the
[42:57] spirit the things of the spirit. For to
[43:00] be carnally minded is death, but to be
[43:03] spiritually minded is life and peace.
[43:07] Because the carnal mind is at immity
[43:09] against God, for it is not subject to
[43:12] the law of God, neither indeed can be."
[43:15] So they that are in the flesh cannot
[43:19] please God. Oh my. Just to think tonight
[43:22] we want to be here and please God. Amen.
[43:25] And it has to be by revelation. Amen.
[43:28] That's what we're looking to to God to
[43:30] give us revelation.
[43:33] But ye are not in the flesh but in the
[43:36] spirit.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; If so be that the spirit of God dwelleth
[43:41] in you. Now if any man have not the
[43:44] spirit of Christ, he is none of his. But
[43:47] if Christ be in you, oh my, tell me a
[43:51] little bit more. If Christ be in you,
[43:55] now this is you. You put yourself here.
[43:59] If Christ be in you, the body is dead
[44:02] because of sin. But the spirit is life
[44:05] because of righteousness. But if the
[44:07] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[44:10] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[44:13] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[44:16] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[44:18] dwelleth in you.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there you are again.
[44:24] That's you.
[44:27] My Therefore, brethren, we are debtors
[44:30] not of the flesh to live after the
[44:32] flesh. For if we live after the flesh,
[44:35] you shall die. But if through the spirit
[44:38] do mortify the deeds of the body, you
[44:40] shall live. For as many as are led by
[44:44] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[44:47] God. Amen. Ain't that wonderful? You may
[44:50] have your seeds.
[44:52] My just to think that, you know, in the
[44:55] word of God, it has made known the plan
[44:58] of God. It's made known redemption. It's
[45:01] made known that God had a predestinated
[45:04] plan and you were in his mind. You were
[45:06] in his thinking. And he so rigged the
[45:10] plan of God that he would place a part
[45:12] of himself in you.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think that's wonderful to think
[45:16] that you went in your life. I went in my
[45:19] life. I had a course in which I was led
[45:22] by my flesh and it always led me into
[45:25] death, which is separation from God. My
[45:28] flesh always got me in trouble. Whenever
[45:31] I let my flesh and my own carnal
[45:33] desires, they led me astray. They led me
[45:36] into prisons. They led me into sickness.
[45:38] They led me into heartaches. They led me
[45:40] into sorrows. But oh my, thank God that
[45:43] there's something on the inside that's
[45:45] leading me to another source. It's a
[45:48] source of real life.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] Oh, just to think that God wanted to
[45:54] have a contrast in our lives to know
[45:56] that we know that the life that I now
[45:59] live. It's not because only the the
[46:02] power that I have. You have a power.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It's the power of your decision.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; If you're going to let your mind just
[46:10] continue to rule your life, it's a
[46:11] decision every day.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Every day. Are we going to look to God
[46:15] and say, "God, I want your will to be
[46:17] done. Not my will, but thine be done."
[46:20] There's a power inside of the seed that
[46:23] can mortify the deeds of the flesh.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[46:27] &gt;&gt; It's something to get excited about
[46:30] because not everybody in this world will
[46:32] give their self over to it. There's a
[46:34] conviction. There's a desire. Oh, I want
[46:37] to know what truth is. But the moment
[46:39] that God starts opening up truth to
[46:41] them, they say, "I don't want that.
[46:44] That's not for me." But oh my, just to
[46:47] think that God planted something in you
[46:50] that you wanted God.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; You wanted to serve God. You wanted to
[46:54] do what's right.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But there's that great contrast.
[46:59] My And I got to thinking as a brother
[47:01] said, "Oh, you know, when you look back
[47:04] in your life and you see where you come
[47:06] from, you see what God brought you out
[47:09] of." Oh, it made my heart start
[47:12] beginning to weep. I'm like, if I start
[47:14] getting tore up like that, I'm not going
[47:15] to be able to say anything to you. I'm
[47:17] just going to be rejoicing and weeping
[47:19] cuz what God has done for me. Oh, well,
[47:22] he took me from the bondage of self. Oh,
[47:25] I thank God for the the deliverance from
[47:28] self.
[47:30] And every day I have grace to put him to
[47:32] bed. Put it not just to bed, but put him
[47:34] to death. I can crucify this old flesh
[47:38] and say, "It's not me that liveth. I can
[47:41] preach this gospel to my flesh.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love that. You know, the
[47:48] scripture says there, as many as are led
[47:51] by the spirit, they are the sons of God.
[47:55] Thank God that he put something on the
[47:57] inside that thirst for the righteousness
[47:59] of Christ.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the power to yield our
[48:04] members to righteousness. It's just as
[48:07] simple as what we did when we yielded
[48:10] oursel over to go to school and try to
[48:13] have good success and all of the sudden
[48:15] we're making decisions and it's keeping
[48:17] us out of church. I know what it's like
[48:19] when God first healed my body. I
[48:20] thought, "Oh, you know what? I missed
[48:22] all of my high school years." Well, two
[48:25] of them. And um I thought, "God, you
[48:28] supernaturally healed me. They need to
[48:30] know the, you know, I need to be a
[48:32] witness for those in the professional
[48:35] world. I'm going to be an athlete. I'm
[48:37] going to go out there and I'm going to
[48:38] let them know, you know, uh, you know,
[48:42] this is a a talent that can't go
[48:45] unnoticed and unrecognized. I can be
[48:47] there for the world.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And you know, the thing is is God heals
[48:51] us and he gives us of his his power
[48:55] &gt;&gt; and we become a partaker of the fruit of
[48:58] God. Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; But oh my, I didn't realize inside of me
[49:02] it was going to be like a stuffed shirt.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, but thank God for conviction because
[49:08] I tell you, I was missing church and you
[49:11] know, I was putting a lot of pressure on
[49:12] my wife and things like, oh, it's just
[49:14] going to be a little bit longer. Don't
[49:16] worry, there's a payoff and all this
[49:18] kind of stuff. But oh my, thank God for
[49:20] conviction because God spoke to my heart
[49:23] and he said, you're doing that for you,
[49:25] not for me. Oh my. How many times do we
[49:28] do things for us
[49:30] &gt;&gt; and we try to put a religious spin on
[49:32] it? We're all guilty. But thank God that
[49:35] there's a desire to serve God in truth
[49:38] and righteousness.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Not my will be done but thine. Oh, I
[49:43] think it's a good time to continually
[49:45] search our heart and say, "God, try me.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Search me. See if there be any wicked
[49:50] way in me. Show me what's leading me."
[49:54] That's right.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; My, you know, there's a lot of times
[49:57] that we want to do right, but we can't
[50:00] be divided trying to serve mammon and
[50:03] trying to serve God. We need to make a
[50:04] clear-cut decision for God.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We really want to run to that
[50:10] source of life. Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; My
[50:15] Oh, I think about it. You know, Jesus
[50:18] gave us the example.
[50:22] You know, he showed us the way of life.
[50:25] He says, "I can do nothing in myself.
[50:27] I'm going to show you that I have a
[50:29] source. My father is my source." The
[50:32] word of God, the eternal plan of God,
[50:35] you know, he put that in the seed that's
[50:37] in each and every one of us. The plan of
[50:40] redemption, the plan of God, he
[50:42] actually, you are the very
[50:44] manifestations of the thoughts of God.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. in your world,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; the very situations and seasons that
[50:52] we're in.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; It's to declare the same God, the same
[50:57] power to heal, to save, to redeem, to
[51:00] give comfort.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's so much to be said when
[51:05] you're in a trial, when you're in a
[51:06] difficulty, and someone would say
[51:08] something, it was a sweet as honey,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; you know, uh it's like a food in due
[51:14] season.
[51:16] I was thinking on the way to church this
[51:18] morning, I was driving. My wife and I
[51:21] drove separate and I was like, you know,
[51:23] that's all right. We I was going and I
[51:26] witnessed a little fender bender.
[51:28] Normally, I would just keep going. I
[51:31] would just keep going. But sons of God
[51:34] are led by the spirit of God. Every
[51:36] single day, we have an opportunity to
[51:39] make a difference in someone else's
[51:41] life,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; you know. And I could have just said,
[51:43] "Well, I'm going to be late for church."
[51:46] Who wants to be late for church? I don't
[51:48] I hate being late for church. I'd rather
[51:51] be there 20 minutes early, sit there by
[51:53] myself, but I want to enter in. Amen.
[51:57] But so I I witnessed this thing and I
[51:59] was going to just keep going on and
[52:01] something in me just said, you know, go
[52:03] ahead and pull over. And well, I'm so
[52:06] thankful that I did because I met a
[52:08] couple, an elderly couple, and another
[52:10] woman. She was an exchange student and
[52:14] you know it wasn't that big of a deal to
[52:15] me so much but this mean everything.
[52:19] Come to turn out that the man it wasn't
[52:22] his fault. Someone pulled out and kind
[52:24] of rolled in and uh this woman she she's
[52:28] an exchange student and uh I don't know
[52:32] what she was thinking but she was at
[52:33] fault and she was just driving on like
[52:35] nothing was going on. just like just
[52:38] kept driving. And I pulled up to the
[52:40] light and I looked over at her and she
[52:42] was looking at me and I said, "You need
[52:43] to pull over." And normally I wouldn't
[52:46] get into that business. That's not my
[52:48] deal. I'm not a policeman, you know? I'm
[52:51] not, you know, I'm not trying to get
[52:52] somebody on the hook, right? So I'm uh
[52:56] she pulls over and then the guy he had
[52:58] this badge on his on his chest, the guy
[53:01] that got ran into and he was he said he
[53:04] was 76 years old. And I got to thinking,
[53:07] you know, that could be my dad or it
[53:09] could be our pastor. And all of a
[53:12] sudden, this man, he had a badge and it
[53:14] said chaplain. And I was like, oh my
[53:18] boy. And he was wound tight.
[53:22] He was I mean, he was talking so fast
[53:25] his dentures were flying out back and
[53:27] forth. I was like, "Wow."
[53:30] I'm not trying to be funny, but I was
[53:32] looking at him going, "Wow, slow down."
[53:37] He had this bag that had a bunch of
[53:40] cords on it, and I didn't notice it at
[53:42] first, but I was just like, "Hey, calm
[53:44] down. Calm down." And he was giving her
[53:46] the what for and telling her everything.
[53:49] And I was like, "Hold on a minute." And
[53:51] this poor girl, you know, she's an
[53:54] exchange student and here she is. I'm
[53:56] like, "Hey, you know, let's let's just
[53:58] let's just deal with this. You know,
[54:00] it's an accident. It's a fender bender.
[54:01] Are you hurt? Nobody's hurt. You know,
[54:03] let's calm down." And so, all of the
[54:05] sudden, we just kind of let them know,
[54:07] hey, this is all going to work out. Look
[54:10] at your car, see the car, just get, you
[54:12] know, do the exchange, get your phone
[54:14] numbers and different things. To make a
[54:15] long story short, you know, I feel like
[54:18] the outcome would have been a whole lot
[54:20] different if I didn't stop.
[54:23] Seriously. and it gave me the
[54:25] opportunity to witness to him.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I told the chaplain after a while, you
[54:30] know, he he began to realize his
[54:33] condition.
[54:35] They were like, "Whoa, I'm sorry. I'm
[54:37] wrong." You know, but this took about 15
[54:40] minutes and but the Lord provided such a
[54:43] sweet opportunity,
[54:45] you know, to to pray for them and just
[54:47] to, you know, I asked the young lady,
[54:49] she looked like she was from India. I
[54:50] said, you know, I said, do you know that
[54:53] uh you know God loves you? You know, and
[54:57] uh you know, you you know that God
[55:00] allows difficulties and challenges
[55:03] because he's he's pursuing you. You
[55:05] know, he wants to come into your heart.
[55:07] He wants to come into your life. Do you
[55:09] know that's the truth? She looked at me.
[55:12] She's like, I didn't know that's the
[55:14] truth. She wanted to know truth. And
[55:18] sometimes in difficulties and struggles
[55:20] and hardships and things like that,
[55:23] that's when we come to know the Lord.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; And God has witnesses and ambassadors on
[55:29] earth today.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to be so mindful that
[55:33] I'm just looking ahead at
[55:35] [clears throat] my next success or my
[55:37] next business venture or my next
[55:40] accumulation of something that's
[55:41] perishable.
[55:43] But I want my name to be identified with
[55:46] somebody that has repented,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; that has come into the kingdom of God.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to have a little
[55:53] sensitivity now of what's leading me.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just to think that, oh, this this
[55:59] dear child has no idea that there is a
[56:04] blood that has been shed for all mankind
[56:08] that if she would just accept it by
[56:10] faith, she can become a new creature.
[56:13] She doesn't have to wear those pins in
[56:15] her ears. She doesn't have to dress the
[56:17] way she does. She doesn't have to
[56:18] believe in an idolatrous deify
[56:22] God and all this kind of stuff like some
[56:25] works is going to save her. My we have a
[56:29] treasure. We have a resource. The blood
[56:32] has cleansed the vilest of sinners when
[56:34] it cleansed us.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Do you love that? You know, to think
[56:39] that we've been invited to shape and
[56:41] mold our character to Christ every
[56:44] single day. We've been given opportunity
[56:47] to shine forth the light in this hour.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a privileged people we are.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; To think that by the power of our
[56:56] decision, we don't just we're not just
[56:59] the average Joe going to work. We're not
[57:01] just the average Joe going to school
[57:04] because there's a source on the inside.
[57:06] If we can ever take our eyes off our
[57:08] faults and failures and realize inside
[57:11] of us is a well of living water. Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; It's a fountain of joy that can spring
[57:16] forth at any time. What has God done for
[57:19] you?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I want to tell somebody what's God's
[57:23] done for me.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; My Well, I'm aiming really hard not to
[57:33] look at my notes, but there's the
[57:35] scriptures I wrote down.
[57:38] But praise God. You know, you think
[57:40] about how that one of the keys to the
[57:45] believer is to look at our leader, to
[57:49] look at our guide. We're not the leader.
[57:52] We're followers. We have a shepherd. We
[57:55] have a source of life. Amen. And so many
[57:59] times we we want to revisit and say,
[58:03] "What kind of character did our Lord
[58:05] have?" you know, the great creator.
[58:09] My when I think about it, when brother
[58:11] Brenn was uh ministering on Wednesday,
[58:14] oh my heart was so touched. You know, I
[58:18] I believe this with all of my heart that
[58:20] when God gives you revelation like fresh
[58:23] revelation, brother Billy said, it
[58:26] actually produces the work the greater
[58:29] works. my and to think that when God
[58:32] gives us revelation, we become a new
[58:35] creature in that moment.
[58:37] Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I I I just feel like as brother Ben was
[58:41] ministering and reading down on that
[58:43] quote and I I got to thinking about
[58:46] blind Barnameus and how blind Barmus,
[58:49] you know, he had a a service that he did
[58:52] for God and it wasn't just a works
[58:55] program. It was real faith. You know, he
[58:58] had those turtle doves. Brother Brandham
[59:01] talked about those turtle doves was his
[59:03] only way of actually income,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; right? But he began to feel there was
[59:08] something on the inside that wanted just
[59:11] more than that.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; I just believe that with all my heart
[59:15] that God put a thirst in brother blind
[59:18] barus
[59:20] and all of the sudden he said, "You know
[59:21] what? [clears throat]
[59:23] I believe I got a source that's greater
[59:26] than this natural provision and I'm
[59:29] going to go ahead and sacrifice those
[59:31] turtle doves to Jehovah.
[59:36] My Barnamesh, you can't do that. That's
[59:39] your only way of income other than
[59:40] begging.
[59:42] Like my God is a provider.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And God loves to see our faith go
[59:49] into action. Like you got a source on
[59:52] the inside. Well, you let your decisions
[59:55] do the talking. I like it because we
[59:58] need to make a confession, but we need
[1:00:00] to get to putting footsteps to those
[1:00:03] confessions.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And blind Barnameus, he had what was
[1:00:07] known as a a seeing eye dog, but it was
[1:00:09] a lamb, and that was his eyes. And one
[1:00:13] day, it just come upon him that he was
[1:00:16] going to go ahead and sacrifice that
[1:00:17] unto Jehovah. Wait a minute, Barnameus.
[1:00:21] You can't you can't sacrifice your only
[1:00:23] lamb. That's your sight.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; But there was something on the inside
[1:00:28] that believed for more.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; There was a source on the inside said,
[1:00:32] you know what? I want to do this for my
[1:00:35] God.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I want to sacrifice for my God. And oh
[1:00:39] my, as brother Ben reading that quote,
[1:00:42] my heart just broke thinking about my
[1:00:46] sin. how Jesus Christ had already been
[1:00:50] beaten and whooped and he was on the way
[1:00:53] to Calvary
[1:00:55] and that blind Bardmas's cry of his
[1:00:58] heart and how he labored by faith to do
[1:01:03] those things and on the road to bear
[1:01:06] your sin and my sin the sins of the
[1:01:11] world something stopped him in his
[1:01:14] tracks
[1:01:15] it was the faith of Our brother blind
[1:01:19] Barnameus.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; He's frozen in his tracks.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; One of the most important jobs a man
[1:01:27] would ever have. There was only one that
[1:01:29] can do it. That there was only one that
[1:01:31] was worthy.
[1:01:33] But oh my, as I was sitting in my seat
[1:01:37] and brother Ben's reading that quote got
[1:01:40] me to realize
[1:01:43] God's feeling about divine healing.
[1:01:47] And God wanted to heal his sight so that
[1:01:50] he can see the Christ.
[1:01:53] How much more your eyesight to heal you
[1:01:57] to see the revealed word of the hour is
[1:01:59] the resource for life.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; This is the only thing that's going to
[1:02:03] change us.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; The very words of life. Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; to think that the scripture says,
[1:02:12] "Behold, what manner of love
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; that is bestowed upon us that we should
[1:02:19] be called the sons of God."
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Not later. Right now,
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; God is giving you power
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; to become the sons and daughters of God.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself. Look at the
[1:02:36] word. The word said you are now sons and
[1:02:40] daughters of God. Well, I just feel to
[1:02:43] read this quote to you
[1:02:45] while uh a brother a couple weeks back
[1:02:48] was preaching. He was preaching out of
[1:02:50] the message why I'm a holy roller. And I
[1:02:52] went and listened to that and I got
[1:02:53] stirred up. I was feeling pretty good.
[1:02:57] But he said this in why I am a holy
[1:02:59] roller in paragraph 33 says, "Why I tell
[1:03:02] you it means something when a man's
[1:03:04] really born again of the spirit of God.
[1:03:06] He's acquainted. He becomes acquainted
[1:03:08] and a personality of God is in him. And
[1:03:11] he knows that he's only going from the
[1:03:14] ridiculous to the sublime.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Well, that sums up my life. That sums up
[1:03:20] my life. I It was ridiculous to think
[1:03:22] the things that I led myself into, the
[1:03:24] prisons, the hell. Oh my, the
[1:03:27] sicknesses. But oh, when I come into
[1:03:30] know him
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; and the personality of God be to dwell
[1:03:34] in me to bring deliverance, to bring
[1:03:37] salvation, to bring healing. Oh, it was
[1:03:40] so sublime.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; I went from the ridiculous to the
[1:03:44] sublime.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful that we have a
[1:03:48] source of life
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; that you can be a a partaker of divine
[1:03:52] fellowship by promise?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my, what a privileged people we are.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. And to think as Psalms 10
[1:04:00] 100
[1:04:02] paragraph 1-5, he says, "Now make a
[1:04:04] joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye
[1:04:06] lands. Serve the Lord with gladness.
[1:04:09] Come before his presence with singing.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Know ye that the Lord, he is God.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; It is he that hath made us, and not we
[1:04:18] ourselves. We are his people, the sheep
[1:04:22] of his pasture. Enter into his gates
[1:04:25] with thanksgiving and enter into his
[1:04:28] courts with praise. Be ye thankful unto
[1:04:31] him and bless his name.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, I'm a thankful person. I
[1:04:36] believe that we're the people of God,
[1:04:38] chosen by God to bring the light in this
[1:04:41] day. Behold, in the evening time,
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; there shall be representatives
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; of the light. There shall be light in
[1:04:50] the evening time.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The path to glory you will surely
[1:04:54] find leadership. Praise God for
[1:04:57] leadership. You know it was one of the
[1:04:59] last messages brother Brandon preached
[1:05:02] and that in communion
[1:05:04] my and to think that you know it it
[1:05:07] matters so much leadership
[1:05:10] you know we're going somewhere.
[1:05:14] He's leading us somewhere,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; you know, by by feeding on the word, you
[1:05:20] know, drinking in what revelations God's
[1:05:24] giving us, we become the word. Amen. As
[1:05:27] you hear it, you receive it, you believe
[1:05:30] it, you become it.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You walk in it.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful, simple formula.
[1:05:40] Ain't that wonderful
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; to know that, you know, we've been given
[1:05:44] the the key to the door and and and
[1:05:48] there's only one way to please God.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; There's only one way provided by God and
[1:05:54] that's by faith. And faith is a
[1:05:56] revelation. And faith cometh by hearing
[1:05:58] and hearing by the word of God. So, if
[1:06:01] we've been empowered to go into the
[1:06:04] storehouse and listen and God can
[1:06:06] minister to us spiritual food in due
[1:06:09] season, well, let's just put everything
[1:06:12] else to the side and recognize the value
[1:06:15] of it. Amen. I I I'm personally
[1:06:18] testifying there's many times the enemy
[1:06:20] will say, "Well, this and that is is,
[1:06:22] you know, you got to have house, you got
[1:06:24] to have car, you got I mean, my
[1:06:26] goodness, there's all these pressures.
[1:06:28] you know, we're not really fit to live
[1:06:30] in this day. There's so many things
[1:06:32] demanding your affection, demanding your
[1:06:35] attention. Give an answer. Hey, do you
[1:06:36] mind taking a survey and giving us uh
[1:06:39] you know what? My goodness, how many
[1:06:41] things is going to be pulling on us?
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of pressure.
[1:06:45] Brother Brandham talked about it. I
[1:06:47] believe it was in the thotin age. He was
[1:06:50] saying like in that age, the believer,
[1:06:52] it was bender or bow. You were going to
[1:06:54] be killed if you didn't uh renounce your
[1:06:57] faith in Christ. But this age is those
[1:06:59] three pressures. Brother Brandham warned
[1:07:01] us. He prophesied. He said, he said,
[1:07:03] "Now the pressure of riches,
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; you know, soft living, you know, these
[1:07:08] are things that try to keep us from
[1:07:10] going into the storehouse because it's
[1:07:13] in that source of life." Amen. When
[1:07:16] faith strikes our heart, it changes us
[1:07:19] from glory to glory.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I have a source. We have a source
[1:07:24] of life.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith changes the situation. Faith
[1:07:29] masters circumstances.
[1:07:31] Amen. Faith changes our attitudes
[1:07:34] towards the lost. Faith changes our
[1:07:36] attitudes towards the sick.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank the Lord.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; You know, I wanted to go through uh
[1:07:52] something in the book of Luke, chapter
[1:07:54] 22. there in um verse 7 gospel of Luke
[1:08:00] verse or chapter 22 and verse 7. How
[1:08:04] many love the Lord?
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Luke 22 and verse 7 thinking
[1:08:13] about that
[1:08:15] you know time you know was about to be
[1:08:18] the Passover and this was preparation of
[1:08:21] the Passover. It says, "Then came the
[1:08:23] day of unleavened bread when the
[1:08:26] Passover must be killed. And he sent
[1:08:29] Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare
[1:08:32] us the Passover that we might eat." And
[1:08:37] they said unto him, "Wil thou,
[1:08:39] where wil thou that we prepare?" And he
[1:08:43] said unto them, "Behold,
[1:08:45] when ye enter into the city, there shall
[1:08:48] be a man that meet you bearing a picture
[1:08:50] of water. Follow him into the house
[1:08:54] where he enter in it. And you shall say
[1:08:58] unto the good man of the house, the
[1:09:00] master saith unto thee, where is the
[1:09:03] guest chamber where I shall eat the
[1:09:06] Passover with my disciples?
[1:09:09] And he showed
[1:09:11] and he shall show you a large upper room
[1:09:13] furnished
[1:09:16] there. Make ready. Well, I thank God
[1:09:19] that he's furnished a place. He's He's
[1:09:22] provided the material for preparation in
[1:09:25] this hour.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a a seven course meal. We
[1:09:30] have a table set in the presence of our
[1:09:32] enemy. Oh my, just to think of the
[1:09:35] parallel.
[1:09:36] And they went and found as he had said,
[1:09:40] and they made ready the Passover. And
[1:09:43] when the hour had come, and he sat down,
[1:09:45] and the twel apostles with him, and he
[1:09:47] said unto them, with desire, I have
[1:09:50] desired to eat the this Passover with
[1:09:52] you before I suffer. For I say unto you,
[1:09:56] I will not anymore eat thereof until it
[1:09:59] be fulfilled in the kingdom of God." And
[1:10:02] he took the cup and gave thanks, and
[1:10:03] said, Take this and divide it among
[1:10:06] yourselves. And he said unto you, "And I
[1:10:09] say unto you that I will not drink of
[1:10:11] the fruit of the vine until the kingdom
[1:10:14] of God shall come." And he took the
[1:10:16] bread and gave thanks and break it and
[1:10:19] gave them saying, "This is my body and
[1:10:21] given for you. Do this in remembrance of
[1:10:24] me. Oh my my."
[1:10:28] Likewise also the cup after s saying
[1:10:32] this is the cup of my new in the new
[1:10:34] testament in my blood which was shed for
[1:10:37] you. He says but behold the hand of him
[1:10:41] that betrayeth me is with me at the
[1:10:43] table and truly the son of man goeth as
[1:10:47] it is determined but woe unto the man by
[1:10:50] whom he is betrayed.
[1:10:54] And they began to inquire amongst
[1:10:55] themselves which of them it was that
[1:10:59] should do this. And there was strife
[1:11:01] among them,
[1:11:04] which
[1:11:05] they should be accounted the greatest.
[1:11:08] And he said unto them, "The kings of the
[1:11:10] Gentiles exercise lordship over them,
[1:11:14] and they that exercise authority upon
[1:11:16] them are called benefactors,
[1:11:19] but ye shall not be so. But he that is
[1:11:22] the greatest among you, let him be as
[1:11:24] the younger, he that is a chief is chief
[1:11:30] as he that doeth serve. For whether is
[1:11:33] greater, he that siteth at meat, or he
[1:11:36] that serveth? It is not him that siteth.
[1:11:41] Is not he that siteth at meat? But I am
[1:11:44] among you as that I serveth.
[1:11:48] Amen. You know, just a super I mean just
[1:11:51] to think that the God of glory came and
[1:11:54] showed us the example and gave us a
[1:11:57] witness of character. It's not, you
[1:12:00] know, sitting at the high places. Like
[1:12:03] if someone really is spiritual and
[1:12:07] they're a servant, they take the lower
[1:12:09] seat, right? They serve. And that's why
[1:12:12] I thank God that we have many people who
[1:12:15] are serving. My, we don't want to just
[1:12:17] serve in church, though. There's there's
[1:12:20] people who are unsaved.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; My, there's people that are lost and in
[1:12:25] darkness.
[1:12:27] You know, we want to have that attitude.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You know, like our brother was preaching
[1:12:32] the other night about mercy. You know,
[1:12:35] it's it's God's really it's his heart.
[1:12:38] He he delights in mercy.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just to think if it wasn't the
[1:12:44] mercy of God, every single one of us
[1:12:47] would be perished.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; We would burn in the fire of God.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But God who's rich in mercy.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for the mercies of God.
[1:12:58] But I I just oh my just when I started
[1:13:02] looking at this paragraph 28.
[1:13:05] Oh, I mean just ye were they which have
[1:13:11] continued with me in my temptation,
[1:13:14] and I have appointed unto you a kingdom,
[1:13:17] as my Father has appointed unto me, that
[1:13:21] you may eat and drink at my table, in my
[1:13:25] kingdom, and sit on my thrones, and sit
[1:13:29] on thrones, judging the 12 tribes of
[1:13:33] Israel. Oh my, just to think about an
[1:13:37] appointing.
[1:13:38] He said, I have appointed you to sit on
[1:13:41] thrones.
[1:13:43] Oh my, just to think about what the word
[1:13:46] appointed means. It means to be chosen.
[1:13:49] It means to be ordained for a specific
[1:13:52] purpose, a specific time, a specific
[1:13:55] role. It's also referred to as God's
[1:13:58] sovereign decision to establish a time
[1:14:03] or an event.
[1:14:07] My the designated individuals
[1:14:11] have a special service
[1:14:14] such as a leader like a king or a
[1:14:17] priest. Doesn't this sound familiar? He
[1:14:21] has made you kings and priests unto our
[1:14:23] God. Just to think that you by
[1:14:26] predestination
[1:14:28] have been given the power of a new birth
[1:14:33] to believe the word and to be converted
[1:14:35] to be quickened by the word to quicken
[1:14:38] by the spirit of life.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And then you become a what what
[1:14:43] does it a priest supposed to make
[1:14:45] intercessions? You we're advocating
[1:14:47] because we know a God that's rich in
[1:14:49] mercy. We know a God that the blood has
[1:14:51] not lose its power. And to think as a
[1:14:54] king, well, King David, you know, he was
[1:14:58] to lead the nation.
[1:15:00] My Well, we don't want to go down all
[1:15:03] those examples, huh? My mind's starting
[1:15:05] to race a little bit. I don't know how
[1:15:08] long I've been. I forgot to set my
[1:15:09] timer. Forgive me. Sunday nights are
[1:15:12] wonderful. Praise God.
[1:15:15] But I just got to thinking about, you
[1:15:17] know, the power of the leadership of God
[1:15:20] to lead us to lost souls. You know, I
[1:15:23] don't want to ever lose sight of souls.
[1:15:26] Amen. I believe that if we lose sight as
[1:15:29] a church of lost souls, we we're
[1:15:31] backslid. We need to get to the altar.
[1:15:33] You know, if we get so busy or so
[1:15:35] burdened and the cares of this life just
[1:15:38] start choking the vision out that we're
[1:15:41] here, we're we're being tested. But to
[1:15:44] know what it's like to know the
[1:15:46] difference, to know what it's like to be
[1:15:48] in bondage to yourself or you know,
[1:15:51] that's what the fall man did is it put
[1:15:54] such a a crush on our our our God
[1:15:58] nature. You know, all of a sudden now we
[1:16:00] wanted to take all the blessings of God
[1:16:02] and consume it for ourselves.
[1:16:04] Oh my. But when you look at Christ when
[1:16:06] he come, he didn't even have a pillow to
[1:16:08] lay his head. He was homeless so that
[1:16:12] you can have a home that I can have a
[1:16:13] home. He and many times after services
[1:16:16] he would, you know, have a headache or,
[1:16:19] you know, he would be hungry or
[1:16:21] different things.
[1:16:23] My but he did it because eternal life is
[1:16:26] living for others. Amen. He took the
[1:16:29] back seat. That's what we do when we're
[1:16:31] driving down the road and the guys are
[1:16:33] blowing by doing a 100 miles an hour
[1:16:35] weaving in and out of the We were on the
[1:16:37] way to church today
[1:16:39] motor. You know what? Go ahead and have
[1:16:41] the first place. I used to be crazy and
[1:16:44] doing crazy stuff, but I'm led by the
[1:16:47] spirit of God now. Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a different reward to
[1:16:52] leadership.
[1:16:54] Boy, I' I've seen those guys going and
[1:16:57] the reward, my goodness, is death.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; The end of that road is destruction.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Which you and I were on that road. But
[1:17:07] God, because he promised and there was
[1:17:10] something on the inside that said, I I
[1:17:12] don't want to remain in this condition.
[1:17:15] Praise God. We have a source on the
[1:17:17] inside.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; We're not praying to a God from 2,000
[1:17:21] years ago, not even yesterday. We're
[1:17:24] praying to the God of now. Right now.
[1:17:26] Today is the day of salvation. Whatever
[1:17:28] we have need of, we can cry out to the
[1:17:31] God that's in us.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; What's your need tonight?
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; You have needs. I have needs.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a source.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:17:49] this is a meeting place for God. God has
[1:17:52] set a table for us. This is a tent of
[1:17:55] meeting. This is provided by God. Amen.
[1:17:59] If you knew, and I know many of you do,
[1:18:02] but I'm here to remind you, you have a
[1:18:04] place that God wants to meet you. That's
[1:18:06] in his word. Amen. He wants to reveal
[1:18:10] himself to us day by day. As we go into
[1:18:14] the word of God, that's where our
[1:18:16] strength lies.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without it, we cannot bring forth
[1:18:20] life.
[1:18:21] We can't live off of yesterday's
[1:18:24] mana. You couldn't store it over. We
[1:18:28] need fresh mana. And oh, just became
[1:18:31] such a reality as brother Billy was
[1:18:33] saying, it the the the fresh revelation
[1:18:37] gives it empowers us to the greater
[1:18:39] works. You might be looking at your life
[1:18:41] and say, "I have never laid my hands on
[1:18:43] any sick person and they've never gotten
[1:18:46] well." Well, that's okay because we have
[1:18:49] a source. If you'll just put your faith
[1:18:52] in the word of God and when the
[1:18:54] opportunity comes knocking, you just go
[1:18:56] acting. You say, "You know what? It
[1:18:58] might have not never happened, but t
[1:19:00] today might be my day. Today, you're
[1:19:02] sick. I have a God. I have a source. And
[1:19:06] I'm going to pray to the God that's in
[1:19:07] me. The same God that created the
[1:19:09] heavens and the earth. He's living in
[1:19:11] me. In you? Yeah. You want to triumph?
[1:19:14] He promised. I'll show you his promise.
[1:19:17] It's unfailing.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; There's two things that are immutable.
[1:19:22] God can't change. He can't lie.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; He's the same in essence, in power. He
[1:19:27] He can still save.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; His blood is still dripping wet on
[1:19:33] Calvary.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; It's fresh.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Well, we thank God for that.
[1:19:44] You know, I just here to remind you. I
[1:19:46] know we've heard these things over and
[1:19:48] over and over again, but my I just can't
[1:19:51] get enough of it because, you know, I
[1:19:54] don't want to be a forgetful hearer. You
[1:19:56] know, I I know these things, but life
[1:19:59] gets in the way. This natural life, you
[1:20:01] know, we make plans and we get busy and
[1:20:04] things just take us away. But if we're
[1:20:06] not careful, we'll let one day go and
[1:20:08] then two days and then it's been a week
[1:20:10] and different things. But I want to
[1:20:12] remind you that our prophet taught this
[1:20:14] in the revelation of Jesus Christ. He
[1:20:16] says it's by the the spirit of God that
[1:20:19] we if we can discern and withstand the
[1:20:21] antichrist spirit, Satan will be
[1:20:24] powerless before us.
[1:20:27] My to think that there's something that
[1:20:29] would make the devil powerless over your
[1:20:32] life. You have strongholds. You have
[1:20:34] difficulties in your life. We all do.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the greatest power that God
[1:20:39] has placed in the hands of man is
[1:20:41] prayer. God, he he told the prophet, he
[1:20:44] says, "Pray for revelation."
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; We need revelation every day.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're praying for it. We want to
[1:20:51] pray for more of it.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by hearing. Amen. We
[1:20:56] want to activate. We want to awaken the
[1:20:58] Christ in us. Amen. That's when the
[1:21:00] glory comes. When the supernatural Amen.
[1:21:05] He said, "With true revelation in our
[1:21:09] lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:21:11] against us, but we will prevail against
[1:21:14] them."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I need that. You need
[1:21:19] that. You Sometimes the trial and the
[1:21:23] test, the sickness, the financial, the
[1:21:26] the relational troubles, they're too big
[1:21:29] for me. They're too big for us. But we
[1:21:32] got a big brother. We got a God. We got
[1:21:35] a source of life. Amen. And if we if God
[1:21:40] will, we just have to be faithful to go
[1:21:42] into prayer and listen to the services.
[1:21:45] Listen, let God lead us. He's going to
[1:21:47] lead us right to the very food. Amen. I
[1:21:50] think that's wonderful.
[1:21:53] It is the revelation of God that gives
[1:21:54] you authority over the devil.
[1:21:57] And you can see why they would they who
[1:22:01] would add or take away will be cursed.
[1:22:06] It would it would have to be so. For who
[1:22:09] can add to or take away from the perfect
[1:22:11] revelation of God and overcome the
[1:22:13] enemy? It is that simple. There is
[1:22:17] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[1:22:20] revelation of the word. My
[1:22:24] I mean we're not talking about Dr.
[1:22:26] Dobson. I mean I I tell you that's okay
[1:22:30] for them. I mean there was a time I I
[1:22:32] used to listen to that. But then when I
[1:22:34] heard the voice of God, it gave me power
[1:22:36] over the sin in my life.
[1:22:39] It gave me victory where I couldn't get
[1:22:41] the victory just hearing about uh you
[1:22:44] know psychology
[1:22:46] because God didn't back that up. He
[1:22:48] backed his word up.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] Well, praise the Lord. I've been longer
[1:22:54] than I thought to be. So we'll try to
[1:22:56] find a place to close.
[1:22:59] Everybody feeling happy?
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Our meetings are coming up and you know
[1:23:03] I just wanted to remind you one of the
[1:23:05] things that was just spurring on my
[1:23:08] heart you know brother Michael and
[1:23:09] brother Tom you know that they've been
[1:23:11] such a blessing to me personally you
[1:23:13] know and I think the last time brother
[1:23:15] Michael was here he was talking about
[1:23:16] untapped resources
[1:23:19] you know and I'm looking forward to the
[1:23:20] meetings. I'm looking forward because
[1:23:22] under that expectation things happen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we get all together and we
[1:23:29] have these needs and something about the
[1:23:32] expectation is lifted and and I can
[1:23:35] point back me personally back in 2007 in
[1:23:38] the old church. It was a it was our
[1:23:40] annual meetings and I testified to the
[1:23:42] youth about this but I'll say it again.
[1:23:45] 2007 I remember brother Tom was
[1:23:47] preaching show us the father and it
[1:23:49] would suffice us and he's like Phillip
[1:23:52] you know haven't we been with you so
[1:23:53] long and you're saying show us the
[1:23:55] father and that message did so much good
[1:23:58] to me because I was facing a lot of
[1:24:00] struggle I was I had years and years of
[1:24:04] complex physical dysfunction doctors
[1:24:07] saying there's no cure for this and no
[1:24:09] you know I I had the remedies medicines
[1:24:12] which okay but there was something on
[1:24:14] the inside saying, "I just don't want to
[1:24:17] settle for that."
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; But when he was preaching, it brought
[1:24:21] Christ alive. And then I realized
[1:24:24] there's another source of life.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And God made that a reality to me that
[1:24:30] he was my healer. And from that day till
[1:24:33] today,
[1:24:34] they can't explain it, nor can I. But
[1:24:37] God was faithful to his word.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I had years and years. They
[1:24:42] said there's no cure for what I had in
[1:24:44] my back. It was degenerative.
[1:24:47] But praise God, I wasn't going to lift
[1:24:49] up that disease. I wasn't going to lift
[1:24:51] up my struggle and all of the years of
[1:24:54] heartache and hardship. But now I can
[1:24:56] point and say, I got a source of life. I
[1:24:59] got a resource. Now I know my God. I've
[1:25:03] heard of him before that he did it for
[1:25:04] others, but now I seen it. It's a
[1:25:07] reality to me. And when the hard time
[1:25:09] comes, when the struggle comes, I don't
[1:25:12] come running, racing out for
[1:25:14] entertainment to soothe me.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I go to the source.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the rock. Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just get to thinking about the
[1:25:26] rock, Christ Jesus.
[1:25:29] You know, it was the time that I don't
[1:25:32] know why, but just God wanted to express
[1:25:34] himself, you know, in in a rock. You
[1:25:37] know, he told Moses, he said, "Speak to
[1:25:39] the rock and it'll bring forth its
[1:25:41] waters." Amen. Amen. And you know, all
[1:25:44] the pressure started accumulating. You
[1:25:46] know, the waters gave forth when he
[1:25:48] spoke, but you know, just like human
[1:25:51] nature, the pressure gets on and he went
[1:25:53] over there and smoked it. But there's
[1:25:54] consequences to our actions. Amen. Just
[1:25:58] because you got saved and God's dealt
[1:26:00] with you and you've got the victory and
[1:26:02] God quickened it in you, you know, uh
[1:26:06] just like that old chaplain, you know,
[1:26:08] it's like, hey, he started acting crazy
[1:26:11] like, you know, all that stuff. He But
[1:26:14] he made it right right there in that
[1:26:15] moment when the Lord started dealing
[1:26:17] with him. He said, you know what? I'm
[1:26:18] sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry. I was wrong.
[1:26:21] Praise God. We don't have to let wrongs
[1:26:26] carry out to where all of a sudden we're
[1:26:28] beating ourselves up and we're like,
[1:26:29] "Oh, I'm no good." No. If we're wrong,
[1:26:32] let's just make it right.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We could just confess our wrongs
[1:26:36] one to another. And the blood of Jesus
[1:26:38] cleanses us. Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And I got to thinking about that. You
[1:26:43] know, if if you know there's storms in
[1:26:46] our lives, just like when Jesus was
[1:26:48] asleep in the ship and brother Brandon
[1:26:50] preached that great message, go wake
[1:26:52] Jesus. You know, there's someone on the
[1:26:55] inside waiting to be called on the
[1:26:58] scene. Amen. What's your need?
[1:27:01] You know, what's your desire?
[1:27:04] You know, we can call Jesus on the
[1:27:06] scene. Amen. I got to thinking also,
[1:27:10] you know, and maybe we can invite the
[1:27:12] musicians to come.
[1:27:17] Amen. We just uh you know, we're in the
[1:27:21] hour of the adoption of the children of
[1:27:24] God. And you know, God has told us and
[1:27:29] spoke over us that the word is in the
[1:27:31] bride. She has the mind of Christ and
[1:27:34] she'll stay still.
[1:27:36] She'll stay still until she has thus
[1:27:38] sayeth the Lord. Amen. So you can know
[1:27:41] when God starts moving on your heart and
[1:27:43] it's according to his word, you can
[1:27:45] speak the word and it'll bring forth.
[1:27:49] And I believe brother Brandon was asked,
[1:27:51] he said, "How many squirrels do you
[1:27:53] need?"
[1:27:56] Like, hey, he's the first one that come
[1:27:59] to maturity. So every day we have needs
[1:28:03] every day. If you think a a squirrel or
[1:28:06] a little fish or a possum, you know,
[1:28:09] God's mindful of what we would think is
[1:28:12] insignificant.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; The moment that you have a need, it
[1:28:16] matters to God.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "What do you need?"
[1:28:20] Well, the limit is
[1:28:23] he challenged brother Brandham to ask.
[1:28:27] You know, God is going to challenge you.
[1:28:31] Say what you want
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and I'll give it to you.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; We got to have that character that knows
[1:28:39] the mind of God. We've been battler
[1:28:41] trained. We've been battles scarred.
[1:28:43] We've been tested. We know we have a
[1:28:47] leader that will lead us astray, but
[1:28:49] we're not we're not uh ignorant of his
[1:28:54] devices.
[1:28:55] You know, if if you're running out and
[1:28:58] your flesh has got you pinned down, you
[1:29:00] just start denying yourself. Start
[1:29:02] starving that thing out. Feed on the
[1:29:04] word of God. Watch how God will
[1:29:07] resurrect his life in you. It's been my
[1:29:11] testimony. Has it been yours? Someone
[1:29:13] want to testify that maybe they don't
[1:29:15] know this God? Maybe they don't know the
[1:29:17] God of resurrection to resurrect you
[1:29:22] out of the [music] dead traditions of
[1:29:23] man, out of the dead works of man, but
[1:29:27] just to trust the true and living God.
[1:29:30] Amen. Why don't [music] we stand
[1:29:31] together tonight?
[1:29:36] Let's sing this together.
[1:29:38] Oh dear,
[1:29:43] in time of the need
[1:29:48] [music]
[1:29:58] [music]

[1:32:41] how he made peace, oh my. To think that
