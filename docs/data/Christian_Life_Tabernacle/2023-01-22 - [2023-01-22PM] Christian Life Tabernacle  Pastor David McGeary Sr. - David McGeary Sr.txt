Lord I just Lord I only wish you gave us a vocabulary that could sing your praise adequately and we'd have words in our speech that could describe you oh one day father we're going to lie in your presence we're going to throw our crowns at our feet we're going to cry holy holy holy Lord increase us father in you we ask it in Jesus precious and wonderful name amen amen let's open our Bible so I I like it tonight I like preaching to small groups amen I like being assembled with the Believers amen don't you it's wonderful praise God let's turn in Genesis I'd just like to continue in the thought line that we've been in and our brother was on that this morning we know we've been preaching out a spoken word as the Original Seed and tying that in with the Capstone and we're just going to continue just a short service this evening we'd like to read it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning God and then we always like to read along with that we we like to always read in Saint John also and the first uh verse of Saint John The Gospel of Saint John it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God Amen and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth it not Heavenly Father we ask you to add your blessings to your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated halleluia and uh um we just want to um just continue uh on that thought just for a little bit this evening just that uh to have a greater understanding I believe of the expectation of of the bride and uh we call ourselves the bride and we call ourselves the uh elect lady in other words the and we preach and we teach of an invisible Union between this heavenly bridegroom and this Earthly bride and it's so beautifully ties together with creation and so we know that God had to be outside of his creation in order to create it and a lot of times that's what uh you know there's people that believe that for some reason or somehow something bumped together up in the sky or something came and and caused it to happen but what they don't understand if it was created or came into existence there had to be something outside of it in order for it to come into existence so God had to be outside of his creation but yet his creation had to be in them so we we know that creation that that the world's were not made by hand they weren't fashioned so to speak you take something and you fashion it you you build that you make it you you do things through it you take steel and iron and you make uh something from it so those are things that are fashioned something that's fashion means that there was something that was taken that in one form and fashioned into another form that's why we call Fashions we call it Fashions people take clothing and they form it into something it's sad isn't it that people pay more money for Less it just shows you that uh that the the thinking of man is has really moved from anything that's real you know uh I I saw a pair of flip-flops for 225 dollars flip-flops that's a flop for sure and it must have surely flipped the mental capacity of the person that paid for him so I got good name but anyway so we understand that so God did not create by hands or by fashioning he created by his word so he said let there be and so if it's so when it was created uh God uh he he did it by his word God in the beginning he created by his spoken word God's method of doing things is to speak it that's what he does that's why even in your faith the prophet of God taught us that if you ever want to accomplish something by faith it can't just remain in you as a thought because the process of God has got to be confessed God can do nothing for you until you confess it first until you're able to put your thought and and what's in your heart in the form of an expression and speak it out that it could be witnessed that God can't do nothing for you so it's got to just remember that that God works upon the confession of your faith and that's because he put a law the law in the beginning is what created that uh to be by speaking so it comes to pass by speaking so if we're in the image of his likeness then we've got to begin to understand we've got to do things the way that he's done them so that by faith God had faith yes he believed what he would speak would be there so much so he could eternally stand behind it and say that I can do anything but lie that's the one thing God can't do if anybody says is there one thing God can't do yes God can't lie he's the Fountain of all truth he's the Fountain of all goodness he's the Fountain of all mercy and that's the one thing he can't he can't do so he's got the he he he he he does it by by speaking it and confessing it and and and saying this is what will be or he would say Let There Be and we know that being the Creator which means that he is the beginning in the beginning God created so that means that God was the beginning of it he was the source of it he was the fruit of it and he's the source and fruit of all his word so in other words there's a life behind the word there's a person behind the word there there's somebody that stands behind his word and there's and there's a me meaning behind his word no word of God was spoken in vain no word of God was spoken without an intention of accomplishment that's why you don't want to come under the judgments of God and and thank God for mercy you know what I mean that he that he can forgive and that he's got those attributes because we as brother Tim said we were the benefits of those attributes the benefits of what that he done so so we understand that it's God's word is still being spoken amen I think you know there's still a person behind it there's still a person that a living being with all the greatness that we try to describe him by and it's how do you describe them you know how do you even measure his love it's it's so vast we've made God too little we've made them too weak we've made them too far away but he's not far away he's close because he said he would be close how close would he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you for that fact I'll even be with you and in you and that's what Paul said the one God you know one baptism One Faith one Lord and Savior one God above us and the one God within us all the part of God in us that's how close he wanted to be to us can we've just made him we've made them too little and we've allowed Satan to get too big we've given them way more credit than he deserves I like whether how the prophet of God described the one thing he says he's nothing but a big hairy alley-oop anybody old enough to marry out remember alley-oop there's a few alley-oopers left he said just a big old caveman you know I remember when he got those Faith muscles it came off that Faith began to grow in him and he began to think of the promises of God the word of God what God Said and he finally got up and he said boo and he dissolved he's nothing he's a bluff that's right you know they call it Poker Face I believe somebody that can lie to you you write straight to their teeth you know what I mean and just keep a straight face I don't like straight-faced liars I I don't mind a liar you can tell he's lying because he knows he's lying and you know he's lying and therefore he don't think it's a lie but I don't like those Liars and Satan's a liar and I don't think we ought to like Satan at all I got no affinity for Satan I like what uh they ask uh brother Billy Paul gave us the testimony how that they quit asking to ask him he says what's brother brosler saying up there what's brother brother boss was saying there he said brother Rob was up there saying poor devil board devil Here Comes The Devil he's going to be exposed poor devil you don't have no affinity for the devil well that's not what it's all about so we understand that God still speaking his word he's still speaking his word he's still bringing his word to pass he's still standing behind everything he says he still speaks if God was dead then he'd be quit speaking he's not done creating he's still moving he's still a real God and so when he spoke his word another so God's still speaking so it's not laying dead on paper so man can make out of it what they want to make out of it heard them all okay do you understand so he just didn't leave it here and say okay now make out of it what you make out of it and that's the problem people are taking the word making out of it what he made out of it but God's word is still the same it's still the same it's still the the very word that it's always been and as our brother touched on it this morning and because we we've been reading this we know that it said that every seed would come forth of its kind so in other words when we say that that God had an intention for every seed that he spoke and he was Lord over that seed he was Lord over all the things that crept on the earth he was Lord he's Lord of all things it built everything that he spoke had had an intention and and as we have been gone through and as our brother touched on all those things uh were part of the attribute of God being expressed so Paul summed it up this way he said the invisible things of God are clearly seen in the visible things around us in creation the first Bible was creation that's what he we're being admonished to if you don't want to think just look you know I mean I love architecture I do but some of the best buildings in the world to me are old buildings I like watching old buildings and walking down old Cobble Stone streets and and going back to the uh cities that have towns that are from the 16th century I love that my heart beats inside of me I've always wanted to go to China and go through some of the ancient things there and I love history and I love geography but let me tell you something there is nothing like standing on the top of the peaks of the Bob Marshall Wilderness and looking out over that creation you can't imagine when you just begin to see the life in the uh could I bend down those Rivers where I can see the trout in them and and eating the berries and at the wild raspberries and wild blueberries oh my goodness uh man can't touch that they'll never be able to touch it artificial never matches up yeah I went to uh IHOP the other day and I ordered sausage oh I get this stuff and I said I want I'd like two eggs over easy some sausage patties I've cut the potatoes give me fruit and I got these two things back and I was eating breakfast with Richard and I tasted that thing and I said what's this I I thought I was being poisoned and I said ma'am I'm sorry I ordered sausage oh she said this is plant-based there's no such thing as plant-based sausage sausage comes from pigs it don't come from plants you understand that you see what they did they didn't use the original attention of a pig the original tension of a pig is bacon you understand and the originals thing of a plant ink sausage I'm sorry it's just the way I feel about it leave things alone leave it the way God made it that's right don't need our help it can soak every seed supposed to to come forth of its kind so in other words the the the the life of the seed came from the Creator you understand the life of it came for the from the Creator and and the life of it was it and I I hope that you can understand this the life of the fruit another the life of the Apple the life of the Corn the life of the seed is not the fruit it produces right that's not the life of it the life of it is its ability to reproduce because that's the life of it now let me tell you something a lot of Christianity has been preached fruit fruit fruit fruit fruit fruit fruit and the message a lot of times is all produced fruit you won't cut your hair you'll wear dresses you'll fruit you'll pay your tithes you'll go to church fruit fruit fruit but the life of the seed is not the fruit of the seed it's the ability to reproduce itself because if that's what hybrid something is it can't reproduce itself therefore it becomes extinct now hybrid Corn's got beautiful fruit hybrid apples whatever they they can make now it has beautiful fruit but it doesn't have the ability to reproduce now we know that if it's got to come forth from its kind in the beginning so when God created it he placed it as we realized in seed form and then when that seed found it we're talking in the natural and then we'll switch to the spiritual but when that seed found its right condition and it's right timing and that by every seed and Grain and everything brought forth it brought forth as the Earth warmed up and it was planted to whatever level it comes to and it meant the conditions of that seed you know a lot of times we get frustrated in it and witnessing to somebody and and sharing the gospel with them but we got to remember we've got to wait on the conditions and that life will come into a condition and a place if that seed is there that it'll come forth alcoholism is big uh in our family my family uh if I could say that in our gene or or whatever uh we're there's a susceptibility to alcoholism my grandparents drank and and that's one thing my dad never did he didn't drink or smoke he he was around it too much and he's seen it too much and he despised it and he he saw what it did to families I had a brother that was an alcoholic and and uh and a sister that is battling the same but you know what they always say to them he says they haven't got low enough yet to give it up they haven't gotten down enough they're not broke enough they haven't suffered enough they're they're still not ready yet because they realize they're never going to quit you know my my brother didn't even think of quitting until he saw his his wife ran over in the street and he couldn't handle it he was finally broke so low but praise God it put him in the condition that now he was ready to grab a hold of it and defeat it Echo things have got to come to their condition they've got to come to their place and maybe sometimes that even if you want to overcome something or you're Desiring for something that's why patience is part of what it means it means to wait on God doesn't mean to put up with the person that's in the lane next to you or the guy going too straight you know too slow in front of you you know I I could I have the power to control traffic did you know that yes sir will you ride with me sometime I change lanes that lane will slow down and the next Lane will go faster and sure enough I can move back to the Lane in just the opposite will happen that ain't patience patience is known you've got a promise and knowing when it's time for that promise to come to pass it'll come to pass right on God's schedule right on God's time because remember the life of it is came from its creator so I don't want to produce a hybrid life I don't want to produce my own thing I don't want to do it I want it to come when he speaks it and brings it to pass because he still speaks so we we understand then that that if if it's if it's hybrid it it won't it won't produce life it won't exist so if he's the creator of that life he put the life in it is that right you know if you if you understand the the the whole understanding if you can understand the law of the seed and the law of him putting the life in it and every seed uh has every fruit in it when that apple seed that once God gave it the life now remember the life isn't the fruit I'll if I could just lay that down and you could grab me hold of it the life was given by the Creator and when he gave that tree life he gave it the ability to reproduce itself and not become extinct so it had to be able to to go and whiten it and why was it going to just keep going and reproduce in everything so it could live on that that was the life of it that it could live on that that it wasn't going to extinct that that the conditions that it would be able to live on and live on and live on and live on and not become extinct so it it had to have it it had to have uh that ability to live on and of course we know that a seed has to go into the ground that's what Jesus said unless a seed go into the ground it will not live oh there's more to these things that then that so he made it that that seed would come it would produce fruits and the fruits was the identity of it but not the life of it right the life of it was that that seed could go into the ground and then reproduce itself and that in that seed that went in the ground was the created life of the life that was given to it by the Creator which shows that that that life was outside of the creation right put in The Creation The Creator was outside of the creation and the Creator put the life in the creation that that life might continue on and then what does the seed have to do it has to go into the ground and if it doesn't go on the ground that seed doesn't what it doesn't live so a seed outside of the ground doesn't have life you make it extinct by not planning it you make it extinct you have a bag of apple seeds you don't got nothing there it's got to be planted you understand that it's got to be planted and that's what he said and I how am I gonna I've got to go under the ground I'm the seed of life I'm the seed of eternal life amen it got hybrid in the beginning at its rate without creative life man would go what extinct don't think man is living on by their own great scientist and they're by education the only reason they're living on is because their spoken word that's got to be manifested you are the nuts holding this together you are the oddballs that keeps this world going leave it so there's that law it's got to go into the ground in order to live and every Apple that came in that seed every Apple that's ever in that tree is in the life of that seed that's God's power to transform oh I hope I can I have the I don't have the education but I hope I have the grace of God to just say something that this could plan in your heart it's in there so you take that little thing it's going to produce a lot of apples but it was all in the seed every fruit that ever came from that tree was in that seed and unless the continuation of planting goes on it'll die you understand that in the natural now if you understand that you understand the law of the Great Commission he did all these great works right he did all these signs and wonders and then he says ye are my Witnesses you understand if it wasn't planted it would have died right there now we knew it wasn't going to die basically we're not talking about that we're talking about the law of it so that's why he said in Mark he said he says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents they shall drink deadly things and it shall not hurt them it can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover okay why the explanation because that was the fruit of the seed you understand the works that I do you shall do also because the seed that he planted the word seed had to have the life but the life wasn't the fruits of it the life was going into the world and planting the seed amen right because the life of the seed is to be able to reproduce and therefore you you the Great Commission was to plant the seed in the ground right it didn't matter by by Witness right by witnessing or what we call testifying saying this is what God did for me this is what God did for me you testify what God did for me no man lights a candle and hides it under a bushel basket God didn't do something for you so you could keep it on your shelf would you like to come over to my house I'll take you in my closet and show you all the things that God's done for me it ain't like collecting where you keep it under lock and key ah it's he's still alive Dr Quick Care witness is he still speaks he spoke to my sickness he spoke to my finances he spoke to this it isn't about teaching and it's not about education and it's not about science it's about proving the life of reproduction is still alive he's still doing it right look it didn't die healing didn't die salvation didn't start casting out of devils didn't die Deliverance didn't die it's still here it's still alive it's still reproducing there's still a witness to it that that life is still here but if it's in Fruit only you don't know it's life until it reproduces it's one thing I like about a potato you leave it in a sack long enough it'll start reproducing right there it'll start growing things on it I pull the potato out there and I wonder how long it looked it looked like a bush it's got the desire to reproduce because the Creator put it there now you're going to see the identity of the true church we think the identity is the fruit um but we're to witness by whatever way by light you are the light of the world by by what you're living how you're handling what you're going through how you deal with it people can read you you know a lot of times we think that oh people can see me for what I really am and they can see all my struggles and and they can see all the fear and doubt I have in my mind no perfect love covers all fear perfect love hides the multitude of sin you always think it's your sin that he's hiding and no or you're hiding other people saying no that's God keeping your witness alive that's God putting up a shield so people you think you made a big tractory mistake you think you're walking around you feel like Doom and Gloom you know you feel like the world's coming you feel like you're packing the whole load in God's love just hides that when they look at you they see their silk guy looking at him he's still going his love hides a multitude it's like a bunker if it's like a a fortress he just takes you under his wing and and just brings you close in him and he hide all the things that people could accuse you of he hides all the things that you think you made a mistake and you get frustrated and everything he just hides it you might pull out in front of somebody and and they're going to take all that thing and all of a sudden that person says oh go ahead he makes a way he's he's just so marvelous so there's so many ways that plant the ground that they're witnessed by light by the word by works so so the life of anything is to have children spiritually speaking I know in the natural flesh because we know in the beginning that God's children would have been brought forth by word so we don't need to go into all how we dropped out of time and everything but we're still talking but the law of life still came and and that life was given by the Creator so in the Life each of us he's been giving he gave us that life and we testify to that life and then we sit back and we we strive to look at the natural natural types of spiritual right so we understand the church age we understand the pride tree right so that seed goes into the ground and now from the beginning it's striving to reproduce itself is that right it it comes up as a sapling what's he doing it hasn't reached its goal is still struggling so it we comes up through it and we know the church history of it it comes up as in the form of a a little Tweed and a little weed as it Springs forth and then it reached a place that is up like a branch or whatever it is and we call that well that's the Justified stage in other words it's justifying its existence I know we always look at it as just being washed nope it's justifying why that he put you here you're going somewhere out not you'd just lay into the ground but you're coming up right because the Creator created and then you come up and you Branch into another stage and you're looking more like what that you're supposed to be and everybody calls that and we call that sanctification he's trying to draw a parallel he's trying to get us to catch something he's speaking to us whatever level he can wherever place he can and then it comes up farther right and it grows and finally it puts forth fruit it's got goodness and kindness It's got all those things but that's not the evidence of it right right there it's not the final to show that it has life it's got to go back to the ground can never could show that you have life you've got to plant what's in your heart somewhere that will reproduce amen now he brought this whole thing up right because the first Adam was a living soul but the second Adam was a quickening spirit and what did he want to do he wanted to have Eve was supposed to be the producing Place Adam and Eve of the first word seed but that he failed but this Eve this lady she's not going to fail because he's going to have a union with her not a union of fruit he's having the union so she can produce word children oh Hallelujah that's what shows he has the life right oh you know what Satan's stopping the church from doing putting it in the ground don't want it witnessed and placed into the word world seed first of all he gets Christians that condemn everybody who's a sinner we're looking for worthy ground oh give me somebody that's Pentecostal give me somebody that wears skirts and I'm gonna sow the word they feel they already got it give me that guy that's lost as a Goose you know what I mean I like what the prophet said the other day he said you pluck uh you pluck the right eye out of him they can't see where they're going and what do they end up they end up with a beatnik in the pulpit go look now every Big Church the guy comes out in a T-shirt and blue jeans at the cooler the better someone took a picture the other day a painting of Elvis Presley and it looked like he had a duck on his head I'm telling you the things that he spoke to us are true you're saying we haven't come this far not to have children spiritually speaking because the evidence of our life is not that we've got all these good attributes and all these wonderful blessings that people can partake of and never get the life themselves but the proof of the life is not the fruit it's the ability to produce reproduce itself so he's brought this church up to the agents he's taken the messenger shown us where we come from showing us our identity the identity of a tree is its fruits so we see the statue of a perfect man is the identity that that is the tree it is the fruit it possesses these things you understand but the union of love between the Heavenly bridegroom in the Earthly bride it produces word children so it's got to follow the same pattern the life that you have yes sir has to be placed in some ground somewhere here in order for it to produce life amen now remember you didn't produce the life as bad as you are the Creator put it there and I acknowledge it all the trouble all the mental things everything that goes wrong you we had no control over it he is the creator he makes one vessel into honor and dishonor right but if it won't sow and grow it has no life you can't take a hybrid Church seed and plant it and produce original life it's got to come forth from its original source and and no wonder the whole theme of the of our messenger was back to the word to restore back the Faith of Our Fathers what was their faith the ability to take the word and go out and produce children by it Hallelujah never dawned on me at cool I had a question that's just working on my mind I walked around that slab out there and I looked at the parking lot and I looked at everything and all I could hear was I ain't building a church for a Sunday crowd Sunday morning crowd and I thought God is that what I'm doing building a church for a Sunday morning crowd then my neighbor God will talk to a donkey don't you get so self-righteous that you won't listen to somebody give you a piece of their mind they just might be telling you something you need to hear I think we're getting way too stuck up in this message until it I couldn't believe it I'm it's like all of a sudden this guy turned into an angel he took off his hat he'd grab this shovel and he leaned on his shovel and he cut he says you know and I looked over at him and Leonia says I want you to know something I say what you're not building this church for people you know who am I building this church for you know who I'm building the church for word children whose children the bride's children I don't we're not trying to gather bushel baskets of fruit all we become is the biggest fruit farm we might as well add nuts too that's not the life of us the life of us is what he's proved it by what you freely have been given freely give go into all the world preach the gospel to them that believe they shall be saved they shall be birthed they shall receive the same life that you have you'll be able to pass this life on go listen to that day of Calvary he said the church will be given the ability to impart eternal life because as he is so is she in this world what I have Peter walked up on that day and he says Silver and Gold Have I None I don't have fruit like that but what I do have I give you rise up and walk because he knew he produced the life that would produce life he had something that was shareable he had something that he could give something he believed in do you believe in what you possessed you keep investing in something that you don't know it's going to yield great businessmen come to the place that they say this isn't going to yield you cut your losses and you run anybody heard of a money pit the minute you see your appraised value and you've put more money in that then you praise value you've got a pit and every dime you put in there's lost sorry dream all you want we got a bunch of dreamers that think that they can have enough fruit to prove they have life and when they came to him they came to him with their fruits we did this we did that we did this he said I never knew you I never had a union with you you never had children you can have one child five children ten whatever you have in the natural but spiritually and I'm not chewing anybody out I'm not talking about the past I'm talking about the maturity that the church has got to come in because the in the natural foreign these two become one and now we're at the time were these two the bride that's raised up the tree that's come to maturity comes to the maturity now God comes in that great Capstone and he unites that love that caused it to come forth in the first place the love that caused that seed to go into the ground in the first place that this bride tree might come back up and and come back and come to the same place that it could identify the life that's in it by taking its seed and sowing it in the highways in the byways in the back places and seeing life come from it we're not building to compete we're not building for so we can put a a picture on the internet of our church packed out from a meeting we ought to put communion night of course that's getting pretty good now let's go to some Wednesday night or Sunday night we're not interested I want to have children spiritual speaking a lot of reasons people can't have natural children but they can still have spiritual children said life and life more abundant you know you don't choose where they plant the seed but if it's seed it'll produce life I like this statement I I don't want to get it too complicated I just want us close right here he said I'm so glad that God is mindful of us again that he can still move on the face of the condition he promised he would do it and call a little flock which would be his bride notice here again how perfect this church types this church types of these Edens God through a seed of his word and there is only one thing that can Quicken the word and that's the spirit the life do you understand there's only one thing that can Quicken a seed so we cut we know that we always say well the seeds in us the seed's in US yes we know that just like it's but it it's it's the seed is laying there but the only thing that can Quicken that seed is the life the ability to reproduce because if you bring something that's not the original life it's not going to Quicken Original Seed because it can only be quickened by original to original it can only bring forth of its kind if you're bringing forth intellect you'll produce an intellectual believer but if you're bringing life amen then you'll Quicken life if you're not bringing what you know but you're bringing what he did for you you're not bringing theology you're bringing what changed you I want to share with you what changed me I want to share with you what made me different I want to talk to you about a God that's real a God that healed me let me tell you about something I know let me tell you about something I have anybody can preach the fruits of brother branham's message I can give any man in here four books and turn him into a preacher right anybody want to be a preacher I can make women preachers nobody can produce the life but him nobody can produce the life but him it's created life from the Creator in the beginning he produced his bride to bring forth Pride and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that's the spirit for it's the spirit is for it is the life-giver to the word well the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed whatever the seed is now notice what happened in the Garden of Eden that was God's economy innocent that was not one uh that was one of the dispensations and he can go on about Adam and Eve and what they would have been but I want you to understand that church we've got to know where we are a good horticulturist knows when to dig the treat at the roots he knows when to prune it he knows the season that the tree is in and I I've been trying to tell you we're in the season of the Capstone we've explained the Capstone we've had teaching on the Capstone but we are now in that time where that invisible Union takes place him and his bride become one and there is a predestinated seed out there that represents the children of this Union amen payment and the spirit has got to be brought to them the spirit and the bride say come understand your season understand your identity understand what God's made you for he didn't live for himself we don't live for ourselves we have life we have life more abundant it was freely given freely give God bless you let's do our job let's stand together this evening musicians can come I certainly know the mental battle of Satan always telling us that were not worthy even a Bad Apple if it's really got life it'll reproduce itself don't look at the outside look at all that he's done for you it will Quicken you have that quickening power a lot of times you say who am I going to testify too [Music] how many believe God works on both ends the Bible tells us be ready to give every man an answer you might just be a little housewife pushing your cart down the aisle and someone stops and say are you Pentecostal or are you religious don't be ashamed tell them tell them what's on your heart tell them what you know no I I I live the way I live because it's in the Bible it may not be in the church world but it's in his world I I I'm really this is not my country it's not where I live I'm I'm from someplace else oh they're gonna think I'm Looney not if your spirit is quickening their seed oh it'll be the best day of their life it'll be the happiest day they ever talk to you what led them to you there's a deep call into a deep if you don't got something you can give I'm telling you he's here every service to grow you stronger to grow you up let's don't devour one another with religion and man-made expectations let's lift our hearts and say oh God it's time your bride has children [Music] maybe with our hearts found [Music] maybe you've always wanted to be be able to share or Witness then maybe you've been muddled down that you've got to have some theology to share you
