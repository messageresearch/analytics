[23:32] amen why don't you have your seats for
[23:34] just a moment
[23:37] that'll be it thank you very much just
[23:40] wanted to
[23:41] share a few things on my heart before we
[23:44] went to the word
[23:47] you know we're living in a day where
[23:48] there's so much pressing you
[23:51] you know there's there's pressures on
[23:52] every side
[23:54] and something that
[23:57] um it became like a vision in front of
[24:01] me
[24:01] we you know we we fellowship once a
[24:04] month at the brother's breakfast
[24:06] and uh brother had something on his
[24:08] heart and
[24:10] um the the message that we fellowshipped
[24:13] around was
[24:14] the unity of one god in in one church
[24:17] and
[24:17] there was so much that spoke to my heart
[24:20] in that message
[24:20] and something that um kind of came out
[24:24] of it
[24:25] one brother that was passing through
[24:27] testified because he's a nurse and
[24:29] he said something to the effect that you
[24:31] know when there's when there's sickness
[24:33] in the body
[24:34] there's different parts of the body that
[24:36] respond
[24:38] to to the need and and you know
[24:41] you know god is so real you know he
[24:43] allows the natural
[24:45] to declare something in the spiritual
[24:47] and so as i
[24:49] as i saw something there you know and i
[24:52] identify
[24:53] in you know because it's not about
[24:55] religion you know we don't come here to
[24:58] get knowledge to you know thump people
[25:00] with truth
[25:01] you know but it's about the the very
[25:04] christ
[25:05] coming into our hearts and actually
[25:06] making what he said
[25:08] live amen we're just surrendered vessels
[25:12] and getting glory giving glory unto god
[25:14] and
[25:15] and something that he had said you know
[25:18] and and just
[25:19] because he's a nurse and just speaking
[25:21] from the heart something
[25:22] quickened in me and then to think that
[25:25] you know just feeling you know about
[25:28] eight months ago we were thinking about
[25:30] selling our house and we started looking
[25:32] and
[25:32] um you know it just it came on us to go
[25:35] ahead and put the house on the market in
[25:37] december
[25:38] and uh we were pressed um you know the
[25:41] house sold quickly and
[25:43] and you know buying and selling a house
[25:45] is no joke
[25:46] you know i don't know i could really
[25:48] feel for um
[25:50] anybody with sympathy now if they've
[25:52] ever experienced
[25:54] even just moving let alone uh buying and
[25:56] selling and
[25:57] um i just i really thank the lord
[26:01] for him just making it so plain about
[26:04] the response of the body and
[26:06] and i really wanted to thank you from my
[26:08] heart and
[26:09] and the help that we received from the
[26:11] body our family
[26:12] i just i don't know what i'd have been
[26:15] able to do without you all
[26:17] each one of your prayers and you know we
[26:19] just feel pressed but
[26:20] you know i just something that's on my
[26:22] heart i just wanted to share
[26:24] that with you and and just wanted to
[26:27] give glory to the lord for
[26:28] his body working and operating in love
[26:31] amen
[26:32] the the the prophet of god said that the
[26:34] the
[26:35] divine love would only be in operation
[26:37] with the redeemed with the chosen and
[26:40] and i am a witness that god is alive and
[26:42] well
[26:43] amen praise the lord why don't we stand
[26:46] we'll just um
[26:48] i have a a a request uh
[26:52] my step-brother miko he's going to visit
[26:55] um my uh
[26:58] my aunt rosemary they'd pretty much
[27:00] given her up she's
[27:02] had multiple strokes she's you know um
[27:04] she's been good to me
[27:06] my brother my my stepbrother he's a
[27:08] younger brother his name's mikko
[27:10] he's he he's looking at the the bible
[27:13] as some fiction novel and and some
[27:16] childhood story that
[27:18] couldn't be trusted and and of course he
[27:20] went to college and he's part of a
[27:21] fraternity and things like that
[27:23] but i just believe that in times of
[27:26] stress
[27:26] in times of duress and times of
[27:28] emergency
[27:29] in times when someone's going to meet
[27:31] the lord
[27:32] that's when things can dig down and
[27:35] that's what i'm i'm praying tonight and
[27:37] if if you have a request on your heart
[27:41] why don't you just make it known and
[27:43] let's pray together
[27:46] precious heavenly father lord no doubt
[27:48] many
[27:50] prayers have gone up to you already lord
[27:52] and
[27:53] and surely we've heard the prophet say
[27:54] we could sing too much
[27:56] lord we can talk too much
[28:00] but we can never pray too much and
[28:01] father right now
[28:03] you know the needs of our heart before
[28:05] we even ask
[28:06] lord we pray that you use circumstances
[28:08] pressures of life and
[28:10] when someone would pass lord you even
[28:13] use
[28:14] situations like that lord to draw us to
[28:17] something that's eternal lord we pray
[28:20] god that
[28:20] you would bless each heart here lord the
[28:23] the word that goes forth tonight lord we
[28:25] pray that
[28:26] you would minister to the body that it
[28:28] would be an encouragement
[28:30] as we commit this service to you we
[28:32] thank you and we praise you
[28:34] and we commit it all to you in jesus
[28:35] christ's name amen
[28:38] amen if you have your bibles i invite
[28:40] you to turn to john chapter 16.
[28:45] i remember it was
[28:50] it was in march 3rd
[28:53] 19 years ago
[29:01] i i was working at exhibit group and
[29:06] i wasn't seeking the lord and uh
[29:10] matter of fact i was running from the
[29:13] lord and
[29:14] i was at work and instead of eating
[29:17] lunch i was
[29:18] doing some no good with brother tommy
[29:21] and i was going back to work and uh
[29:24] i got a phone call from my mom and my
[29:26] mom said that my grandma was actually
[29:28] going to go into the hospital
[29:30] she was having shortness of breath and
[29:32] this was in
[29:34] 2002.
[29:37] and you know we left the truck
[29:40] instead of eating lunch we you know we
[29:43] just
[29:44] did other things and even in that
[29:47] intoxication
[29:49] something happened after i got off the
[29:51] phone with my mom
[29:52] there was another voice that spoke and
[29:54] said that my grandmother wouldn't leave
[29:55] that hospital alive
[29:58] and you know that that voice put me in
[30:02] action
[30:03] wasn't a praying person you know
[30:07] and but there's something about the
[30:09] voice of the lord that moves
[30:11] a person it gets you into action
[30:15] amen and and tonight being 19 years from
[30:19] that time
[30:20] you know it's the lord speaking to our
[30:23] hearts
[30:23] doing for us what he promised amen and
[30:26] i'm just
[30:27] i'm encouraged because you know after
[30:30] the lord
[30:31] spoke to my heart i was able to
[30:33] experience some things where
[30:35] i don't have a regret about her passing
[30:37] i was able to
[30:38] you know share with her my heart and let
[30:40] her know how much i loved her and
[30:42] appreciate
[30:42] her life and how much it meant to me and
[30:45] you know and
[30:46] and and i asked her if she had ever
[30:48] placed her confidence in the lord jesus
[30:50] christ death for her soul
[30:51] because she's catholic but her you know
[30:53] her testimony was
[30:55] is that she's catholic because she
[30:57] watched notre dame football on saturday
[30:59] you know and she watched the parade on
[31:01] whatever day they
[31:03] make the parade down there or whatever
[31:04] so you know it's just one of those
[31:07] things that gives you
[31:08] a great consolation amen
[31:12] so we just trust that god will bring
[31:14] life out of death
[31:16] amen in john chapter 16
[31:20] we'll start in verse 1. he says these
[31:23] things have i spoken unto you
[31:25] that you should not be offended they
[31:28] shall put you out of the synagogues
[31:30] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[31:34] killeth you will think that he is doing
[31:36] god a service
[31:38] and these things will they do unto you
[31:40] because they have not
[31:41] known the father nor me but these things
[31:44] have i told you that
[31:46] when the time shall come you may
[31:48] remember that i have told you of them
[31:50] and that these things that i said not
[31:53] unto you at the beginning because
[31:55] i was with you but now i go away for him
[31:59] that sent me and none of you shall ask
[32:01] me whether goest thou
[32:03] but because i have said unto these
[32:05] things
[32:06] these things unto you sorrow hath filled
[32:08] your heart
[32:10] nevertheless i tell you the truth
[32:13] it is expedient for you that i go away
[32:16] for if i go not away
[32:17] the comforter will not come unto you but
[32:20] if i depart i will send him
[32:22] unto you that he is and when he is
[32:26] come he will repeat reprove the world of
[32:29] sin
[32:30] and of righteousness and of judgment
[32:33] of sin because they believe not on me
[32:37] of righteousness because i go unto my
[32:40] father
[32:40] and you see me no more of judgment
[32:43] because the prince
[32:44] of this world is judged i have yet many
[32:47] things to say unto you
[32:49] but you cannot bear them now how be it
[32:52] when he
[32:53] the spirit of truth is come he will lead
[32:56] you
[32:57] into all truth and he shall not speak of
[32:59] himself but whatsoever
[33:01] he shall hear that shall he speak and he
[33:05] will show you things to come
[33:07] he shall glorify me for he shall
[33:11] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[33:14] you
[33:15] all things that are of the father hath
[33:17] are
[33:18] have are mine therefore
[33:21] said i that he shall take of mine and
[33:25] shall show it unto you
[33:27] a little while and ye shall not see me
[33:30] again
[33:30] a little while and ye shall see me
[33:33] because i go unto the father
[33:35] then said some of the disciples among
[33:38] them
[33:38] what is this that he said unto us a
[33:41] little while
[33:42] and ye shall not see me and again a
[33:45] little while
[33:46] and you shall not see me and because i
[33:48] go
[33:49] to the father they said therefore
[33:52] what is this that he saith a little
[33:54] while we cannot tell what he saith
[33:57] now jesus knew that they were desirous
[34:00] to ask him
[34:02] and said unto him do you inquire among
[34:05] yourselves
[34:06] of that i had said a little while and
[34:08] you did not see me
[34:09] and again a little while you shall see
[34:12] me verily i say unto you
[34:14] that ye shall weep and lament but the
[34:17] world shall rejoice
[34:18] and ye shall be sorrowful but your
[34:22] sorrow shall turn into joy amen a woman
[34:26] when she is in travail has sorrow but
[34:29] her
[34:29] hours come but as soon as she is
[34:33] delivered
[34:34] of child she remember no more
[34:37] the anguish for the joy of the man that
[34:40] is born into the world
[34:42] and ye now therefore have sorrow but i
[34:45] will see you again
[34:47] in your heart shall rejoice in your joy
[34:49] no man taketh away
[34:51] from you and in that day you shall ask
[34:55] nothing verily i say unto you verily
[34:57] verily i say unto you
[34:58] whatsoever you ask in the father in my
[35:01] name
[35:02] i will give it unto you amen
[35:05] and then right there in verse 24
[35:07] hitherto
[35:09] have ye asked nothing in my name ask and
[35:13] you shall receive
[35:14] that your joy may be full amen
[35:17] trust the lord will add a blessing to
[35:19] the reading of his word you may have
[35:20] your seeds
[35:28] amen
[35:30] so as we were going through the um
[35:34] the the brothers breakfast and and even
[35:37] the different sermons that have been
[35:38] preached
[35:40] it's been a number of months since i've
[35:42] stood before you and so we feel a little
[35:44] nervous we just want to try to
[35:46] somehow relax ourselves and just trust
[35:49] the lord will
[35:50] have his way
[35:57] you know there's there is a uh
[36:00] a phrase that that came across as
[36:03] as brother david was uh ministering this
[36:07] last weekend about
[36:08] being a a one-man denomination and
[36:12] and and pulling out of the sermon about
[36:15] the two
[36:15] evils you know how that they had made
[36:18] things that
[36:18] weren't god's and then they started
[36:20] taking from a broken cistern
[36:22] and it made me think about you know
[36:23] because of the natural parallel and the
[36:25] spiritual
[36:26] you know we're in a battle okay
[36:29] we didn't we're not here in a picnic and
[36:32] so
[36:33] you know the the the warfare that we
[36:35] fight
[36:36] it's real and it's between life and
[36:39] death
[36:40] amen so if tonight if if there is
[36:43] somebody here tonight
[36:45] that is unaware that the devil's
[36:48] he's chasing after you you know it's
[36:51] it's one of those things that
[36:53] um you know because so many things press
[36:57] us
[36:58] you know we have to find a way to
[37:00] encourage ourselves
[37:02] you know there's so much pressing it
[37:04] there's so much
[37:05] against you you have to find something
[37:08] that becomes a theme something you
[37:10] pattern your everyday experience
[37:12] something you go to to draw strength
[37:14] from
[37:16] amen and so the the thought came to me
[37:19] what is your rally cry you know what
[37:22] what people have
[37:23] is they have what's called like a slogan
[37:27] if they're going to go for politics or
[37:28] if they're going to put some kind of uh
[37:31] gathering together what they want you to
[37:34] know is that you know this is the thing
[37:35] that will
[37:37] cause you to to motivate or to take
[37:39] action
[37:40] something that you put before you that
[37:43] gets you moving
[37:44] you know something that's like a vision
[37:46] that you put before you that you're
[37:47] walking towards
[37:49] and something that people can rally
[37:50] around
[37:52] and so whenever they they put this
[37:55] forward it's to cause a response in you
[37:59] amen so you know it's like this uh
[38:03] if if there's if there's some kind of
[38:06] disease that's
[38:07] bombarding the masses as a whole
[38:10] and they're saying well uh we can
[38:13] prevent the spread of this by
[38:15] you know you know somehow quarantining
[38:18] or restricting it but all the while if
[38:21] that causes
[38:22] your battle crying to not be heard amen
[38:25] we're we're facing a battle where an
[38:28] enemy is
[38:29] so deceiving that he'll take some things
[38:31] that seem good
[38:33] that actually are are not good for the
[38:36] kingdom
[38:37] i mean how how are we going to actually
[38:40] share the gospel with somebody when
[38:44] you see i mean the enemy he's he's done
[38:47] his best
[38:49] to try to to to try to naturally cool us
[38:52] off
[38:53] you know like where we feel like we
[38:55] can't even talk without
[38:56] did i get some germs on you you know and
[39:00] then then you kind of feel like oh am i
[39:02] a spreader or am i
[39:03] you know these kind of different things
[39:05] but
[39:07] you know it's like um
[39:16] praise the lord you know
[39:20] there's there's a a natural goal that
[39:23] the
[39:23] enemy and and the world has
[39:27] and then there's a goal that god has
[39:30] amen there's two kingdoms there's two
[39:32] powers
[39:33] and they're they're in conflict with one
[39:36] another
[39:37] amen and so whenever you think about
[39:40] you know the battle cry and and
[39:43] you know what is your rally cry i just
[39:47] think about how that
[39:49] you know an experience that i had you
[39:52] know i said
[39:52] you know coming up you know i
[39:56] i realized that christ died for me
[40:00] and that and that all of my sins was on
[40:03] me but when i realized and heard the
[40:05] gospel then i received the gospel
[40:07] amen and then i realized you know christ
[40:11] did it all
[40:12] amen and so it brought my soul to a
[40:15] resting place
[40:16] and you know then then you know you you
[40:20] you can you can camp out on that yes
[40:24] you know what i mean you so so what
[40:26] happens is now god wants to guide you
[40:28] and teach you
[40:29] into all truth and righteousness you see
[40:32] sometimes we get to where
[40:34] we get the doctrine and then it changes
[40:37] us and the burden of sin is gone
[40:38] but now god wants to send us to further
[40:41] truth but we're still camping out
[40:43] you see we're just kind of holding serve
[40:45] right just you know i'm good
[40:47] you know and yet god's nudging on your
[40:49] heart he's
[40:51] tugging on you and saying i got more for
[40:53] you there's there's more in the word
[40:55] i've got
[40:56] higher heights to come to amen and so i
[40:59] just
[40:59] share this experience with you to
[41:01] encourage you you know i accepted the
[41:03] lord
[41:04] for my my sin and and and to be my
[41:07] savior and
[41:08] and one day you know about three years
[41:11] you know into learning how to die out to
[41:13] myself
[41:15] the lord quickened the scripture
[41:19] i think i wrote it down here i just want
[41:21] to share it with you because
[41:22] you know there's there's a process you
[41:24] know that we're going through and it's
[41:26] an adoption process amen
[41:28] but the scripture says this i believe
[41:30] it's in matthew he says
[41:32] now um it's matthew
[41:36] 6 i believe it is he says now
[41:40] and it's the lord's prayer let's just go
[41:41] to it that way i can just
[41:43] pull right down on it in matthew 6
[41:49] everybody feeling good amen god is good
[41:54] she says it says take heed that you do
[41:58] not your arms
[42:00] before men to be seen of them otherwise
[42:03] you have no reward
[42:04] of your father which is in heaven he
[42:07] says
[42:08] therefore when you do with thy noms do
[42:11] not sound a trumpet before thee
[42:13] as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
[42:15] and in the streets
[42:18] that they may have glory of man
[42:22] barely i say unto you they have their
[42:25] reward
[42:27] but when thou doest thy names let not
[42:29] thy left hand know what the right hand
[42:31] doeth
[42:32] thine oh that thine all may be
[42:35] in secret and thy father which seeth in
[42:38] secret himself
[42:39] shall reward thee openly and when thou
[42:42] prayed
[42:43] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[42:45] that
[42:46] for they they love to pray standing in
[42:48] the synagogues and in the corners of the
[42:50] street
[42:51] that they may be seen of men verily i
[42:53] say unto you they have the reward
[42:56] but thou when thy prayers enter into thy
[42:58] closet and when thou has shut the door
[43:00] pray to the father which is in secret
[43:03] and thy father which seeth in secret
[43:05] shall reward thee openly
[43:07] but when ye pray use not vain repetition
[43:11] as the heathen do
[43:13] for they think that they shall be heard
[43:15] by their much speaking
[43:17] amen and this is just a wonderful prayer
[43:20] he says
[43:21] be not therefore like and unto them
[43:24] for the father knoweth what you have
[43:26] need of before you even ask
[43:28] after this manner therefore pray ye
[43:31] our father which is art in heaven
[43:33] hallowed be thy
[43:34] name thy kingdom come thy will be done
[43:37] as it is in heaven
[43:39] amen and then it says down in verse 15
[43:42] he says but if you forgive
[43:43] not the trespasses neither will your
[43:46] father forgive
[43:47] you your trespasses amen and so that
[43:51] that as as i had had felt the burden of
[43:54] sin
[43:54] lift i was walking daily in the grace of
[43:57] god
[43:58] feeling good you know how the lord does
[44:00] he you know
[44:01] when the burden of sin leaves and oh
[44:04] everything's new
[44:05] i mean the birds are singing you know i
[44:08] mean
[44:09] you could hear i mean the ocean crashing
[44:11] and you're
[44:12] 100 000 miles away or whatever but it's
[44:14] just everything's good
[44:16] you know and then this comes around
[44:20] and and i realized you know maybe i had
[44:24] put a period on the end of my experience
[44:27] you know and and there's a thing you
[44:29] know i had things
[44:31] unforgiveness in my heart and i said
[44:33] wait a minute how is it
[44:35] i know the lord forgave me because the
[44:37] burden of sin is gone
[44:39] but wait a minute there
[44:43] there's a voice now this is what i want
[44:45] to so the thought that i have is what is
[44:47] your rally cry
[44:48] but now as a sub thought now a voice
[44:52] that matters
[44:53] see i want to hear the voice because his
[44:55] voice matters
[44:57] amen and so as he spoke to my heart he
[45:01] said now if you don't forgive
[45:03] others their trespasses your sins are
[45:07] i said whoa well this is a serious
[45:09] matter
[45:11] oh my but i have a right i have a right
[45:15] to be
[45:16] mad at this person because they did me
[45:18] wrong
[45:20] this was in direct uh response to
[45:24] an injustice that had for years all my
[45:27] life
[45:29] a disservice and abandonment
[45:32] not caring for responsibility
[45:36] but now the scripture says that when he
[45:39] comes he was going to reprove the world
[45:41] of sin
[45:43] amen so now god is wanting to take you
[45:46] and he's wanting to take me and he first
[45:49] wants
[45:50] the the christ in me to reprove this
[45:53] world of sin
[45:55] so that the very christ the hope of
[45:58] glory
[45:58] can now be expressed out for others amen
[46:02] so so my dad who i had unforgiveness in
[46:06] my heart
[46:07] i had never met my dad him and my mom
[46:09] separated when i was one
[46:12] so i thought i had the right but little
[46:15] did i know
[46:16] as a little lamb i had to shear off my
[46:19] rights
[46:21] and here he comes with his pruning
[46:22] shears and he started quickening the
[46:24] word
[46:26] how important and that voice that really
[46:29] matters
[46:30] amen the spirit of truth now is walking
[46:33] through
[46:33] every heart every situation and he's
[46:36] wanting to quicken this word
[46:37] to you right now amen that's the way he
[46:40] does we're coming up higher he said he
[46:42] wants to show us greater things
[46:44] amen praise the lord
[46:56] praise the lord the scripture says in
[46:59] john 18
[47:02] we'll just turn there
[47:18] the encounter was with pilate in in
[47:20] verse
[47:22] 37
[47:29] chapter 18 verse 37
[47:36] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[47:38] the king then
[47:39] jesus answered thou says that i am the
[47:42] king and to this
[47:43] end was i born and for this cause came i
[47:45] into the world
[47:47] that i should bear witness unto the
[47:49] truth
[47:50] and everyone that is of truth heareth my
[47:53] voice
[47:54] amen i thank the lord for that yes
[47:57] amen i thank the lord for that everyone
[48:01] that is of truth
[48:02] heareth my voice amen if there's a rally
[48:05] cry
[48:06] that's going to rise up in the camp of
[48:08] the lord jesus christ redeemed
[48:10] amen i hear his voice amen
[48:14] that voice matters amen when the world's
[48:17] going on and they have their purposes
[48:19] and they have their causes and different
[48:21] things there's a people that says
[48:23] there's a voice that matters
[48:26] amen this voice actually transforms
[48:29] people who are lost and destitute
[48:32] but then they realize there's a fountain
[48:36] of living water there's a bank of heaven
[48:38] that they go draw dividends from
[48:41] and there's mercy he's rich in mercy
[48:44] amen
[48:45] thank the lord that i'm not what i ought
[48:48] to be
[48:49] but i'm definitely not what i used to be
[48:52] amen
[48:56] praise the lord we're fighting for truth
[48:59] in the midst of chaos
[49:00] and deception you see the things that
[49:04] are going on in the land today
[49:05] you know i was i was thinking about uh
[49:08] something that brother branham said in a
[49:10] message forgive me for getting my phone
[49:12] but this is the
[49:15] this is where i'm getting the message
[49:16] out of it's uh
[49:19] the unity of one god he says now
[49:23] and this struck me he says now in in
[49:25] paragraph
[49:26] 27 of the unity of one god in one church
[49:29] it was preached in
[49:32] december 21st 1958 he says now
[49:36] they built a tower which i doubt the
[49:39] modern science
[49:41] could to build today with all their
[49:44] machinery
[49:45] and things because they were united
[49:48] together
[49:49] they had one mind one soul one purpose
[49:53] one motive one objective that's
[49:56] build a tower so high
[49:59] that if god ever took a notion to
[50:01] destroy them again
[50:03] they would run them right up into the
[50:05] heaven with him
[50:07] and there'd be no way that they could
[50:09] keep him from doing it
[50:12] or he could keep them
[50:16] from doing it as they thought and we
[50:19] find out then
[50:20] that they organize themselves together
[50:23] and we find them
[50:25] again completely out of the will of god
[50:28] amen and just think about how that you
[50:31] know that same
[50:33] you know system it's it's it's a repeat
[50:37] it's a perfect repeat if you can see the
[50:39] pattern and the parallel
[50:41] i was digging through the church age
[50:42] book there's so much
[50:44] there's just no i might have to
[50:45] paraphrase but you think about the
[50:47] nimrod and how they satan wanted to be
[50:51] worshipped
[50:52] and and see he wasn't satisfied with
[50:55] just being worshipped
[50:57] in forms and and and and ceremony
[51:01] he he wanted he actually when when they
[51:04] raised up the the tower
[51:06] of babel then they begin to
[51:10] offer up idols and and
[51:13] you know worshipping uh the cree
[51:16] the creation the sun so then they
[51:19] started typing out
[51:20] father son and holy ghost
[51:24] and then they got to a place where even
[51:28] you know they they worked out to where
[51:32] it was the reincarnation
[51:34] through a through
[51:37] through a woman and so much so that
[51:40] they put the serpent around the sun
[51:44] and and now they actually started
[51:46] worshiping satan
[51:48] and didn't even know it and the the
[51:51] devil and deception so slickly
[51:54] he had he had coupled the the the child
[51:57] and the woman
[51:58] but eventually the woman now began the
[52:01] one
[52:02] that they was the adoration in worship
[52:06] so so the king supposedly was
[52:08] reincarnated
[52:10] in a son an immaculate conception
[52:14] wha what you know the devil he saw he
[52:16] saw what was going on he heard
[52:18] he heard the devil i mean he he heard uh
[52:20] the prophecy in the garden
[52:22] i'll put enmity between her seed and the
[52:24] woman's seed
[52:25] he heard it he's trying to always be in
[52:28] front
[52:29] but you know the devil the spirit of air
[52:31] by the word of god
[52:33] you can know and he's working in
[52:35] deception
[52:37] so you think about how that now they're
[52:39] raising up they're unifying
[52:42] and and it was the first time that they
[52:45] had because before there was only one
[52:47] god
[52:48] you know and they all worshiped the one
[52:50] god but now as they were rising up
[52:52] nimrod
[52:53] confusion he was the interpreter of the
[52:56] gods
[52:57] and then he began to share all his
[53:00] doctrine and teaching that there's more
[53:02] than one god there's more than one way
[53:05] my and then they began to make
[53:10] like the priest became like the military
[53:12] force
[53:14] their doctrine my
[53:17] and you think about how it is today you
[53:19] know you know
[53:20] we're looking i mean the rally cry for
[53:24] us
[53:25] you know is is the faith of our father
[53:28] is being restored
[53:29] you see the the enemy he he all
[53:33] he has you know if you look at their
[53:36] rally cry
[53:37] it's science civilization and education
[53:41] they're they're gonna unite all together
[53:45] and and in the numbers oh we'll
[53:48] we'll make stuff happen you know in a
[53:51] parallel
[53:52] look think about in that day how they
[53:55] through their science which brother
[53:56] brown said we couldn't even duplicate
[53:58] they had access to some kind of power
[54:01] and you think you look you can see it in
[54:03] the news article
[54:04] nasa the spacex they know a fire is
[54:08] coming
[54:11] but god has a provided fire and holy
[54:13] ghost
[54:14] see we're not trying to make the world a
[54:16] better place to live
[54:18] it's got to be renovated and a new
[54:21] heavens and a new earth
[54:24] where christ will come and reign in
[54:26] righteousness
[54:28] so you think about how that
[54:32] through their science now they're
[54:35] you know that that tree of knowledge is
[54:39] is now resulting in death again
[54:42] you know many people are falling into
[54:45] the trap of
[54:46] believing that lie that somehow
[54:50] the fire is not going to fall they they
[54:53] just
[54:53] begin to sit back and rest
[54:57] and relax you know and i just thank god
[55:00] for the pressure
[55:01] you know there's there's situations in
[55:03] life that you
[55:04] if you chose it if i chose it i would
[55:07] say i do not want that
[55:09] pressure i do not want that test i do
[55:12] not
[55:12] but it's through the various trials and
[55:15] temptations that we experience
[55:17] that the christ in us could manifest
[55:21] amen it's it's the the squeezing out
[55:25] that brought christ out amen
[55:28] he was bruised for us amen and so that
[55:31] we can be healed that we can be saved
[55:34] we can be delivered amen and now it's
[55:36] your time
[55:37] the rally cry is it's your time jesus
[55:40] christ is the same
[55:41] yesterday today and forever amen he
[55:44] wants to use your redeemed flesh
[55:46] amen he wants to squeeze the christ out
[55:48] of you so whatever situation whatever
[55:51] circumstance that you're falling in you
[55:52] can't seem to take it
[55:54] praise god there's something in you that
[55:57] you can depend on
[55:59] there's a fountain flowing from within
[56:02] amen
[56:03] now the the thing is is to learn how to
[56:06] walk in the spirit
[56:08] to hear his voice now there's so many
[56:11] voices
[56:12] i mean this thing's like a constant
[56:15] it'll keep you up at night
[56:22] but there's a voice that matters amen
[56:26] makes the difference and it's typically
[56:28] an unseen difference
[56:31] amen
[56:40] you know there's there's a slogan that
[56:42] brother branham
[56:44] had said and i had put it up
[56:47] at my desk for a number of years and
[56:49] after we were packing it up i kind of
[56:51] revisited it
[56:53] and it's a real simple slogan
[56:56] and i think it's it's it's edifying
[56:58] because there's times
[56:59] where you're pressed and you need to
[57:02] encourage yourself in the lord
[57:04] he said this he says now he says
[57:07] do right act right and you'll turn out
[57:10] right
[57:12] simple you do right
[57:16] act right you'll turn out right amen
[57:19] and it's just simple i like it i like it
[57:22] because it's so simple
[57:24] amen now there's another slow slogan
[57:27] that brother branham spoke of and
[57:29] you know whenever i refer to uh
[57:33] china you know that's that's the bamboo
[57:35] curtain
[57:36] right and when you think about russia
[57:38] they're the iron curtain
[57:40] and now there's a purple curtain and now
[57:42] and i said watch that one
[57:44] because there's deception in that one
[57:46] and you see about the recent
[57:47] manifestations in the natural there was
[57:49] a woman in purple
[57:50] you see she was standing there and and
[57:53] you know
[57:54] there there's got to be flares and
[57:56] fireworks going off in the the heart of
[57:58] the believer that says
[57:59] now i realize there's a union going on
[58:03] and it's going on behind the scenes i am
[58:06] not deceived by the wicked ways
[58:08] of the enemy i have another voice that's
[58:12] making a difference amen
[58:18] that ecclesiastical power
[58:22] that military power now they're uniting
[58:25] and they will cause a forcing but praise
[58:29] god there's a people
[58:30] that has heard the voice of the
[58:32] resurrection
[58:33] they won't have to go to the great
[58:35] tribulations amen
[58:37] praise the lord
[58:41] brother brahm made this statement in
[58:43] this message called
[58:45] god keeps his word you know now
[58:49] now watch just a minute
[58:52] no not to be prejudiced just sit still
[58:56] and listen let the holy spirit bring it
[58:58] to you now
[58:59] today we got in the condition like it
[59:02] was in
[59:02] ahab's time well whatever the woman said
[59:06] that's what ahab did now even
[59:10] in the church they worship women
[59:13] not long ago my righteous ignatian was
[59:16] brought up in mexico when i seen a
[59:18] little
[59:19] poor no note of her rather
[59:23] coming down crawling for miles on hot
[59:26] rocks
[59:27] and as the father walked along with baby
[59:29] in
[59:30] his arms and two of them and one of them
[59:32] following along
[59:33] the mama and her crying and
[59:37] hiding off the height off of her knees
[59:40] pulling her hands
[59:41] through the rocks and crying and
[59:44] everybody looking at her
[59:46] she had went up to some statue
[59:49] of some dead woman that supposed to be a
[59:52] saint
[59:53] and they didn't i didn't say this
[59:55] critically
[59:57] i say this in light of god's word it's
[1:00:00] absolutely unadulterated
[1:00:02] spiritualism the bible says there is no
[1:00:05] intercessor
[1:00:06] there is no other mediator between god
[1:00:08] and man but the man
[1:00:10] christ jesus if the early church was
[1:00:12] catholic
[1:00:14] then why had they changed when the early
[1:00:17] catholic
[1:00:18] condemned it and this catholic accepts
[1:00:21] it
[1:00:22] it's a woman's world the spirit and the
[1:00:25] slogan is today and that's true
[1:00:27] that's exactly right amen so you think
[1:00:30] about how that
[1:00:31] even then i mean now
[1:00:34] think about the deception you know if
[1:00:36] we're going to be effectual witnesses
[1:00:38] for other people
[1:00:39] that are in denominational
[1:00:42] i mean these are this is shackles i mean
[1:00:45] can you imagine
[1:00:46] as you know if i told you you had to
[1:00:48] walk this
[1:00:49] on your knees in your hands to be right
[1:00:52] with god
[1:00:53] i mean there's people that are carrying
[1:00:55] this practices out
[1:00:57] and they're even offering indulgences
[1:01:00] for future sins you can go and pay money
[1:01:04] and and you can just indulge
[1:01:12] and you can just go and pray some our
[1:01:14] father and hail mary
[1:01:17] and your conscience will be sued my
[1:01:20] goodness
[1:01:21] we there's got to be a rally cry for
[1:01:23] truth there's brothers and sisters in
[1:01:26] those
[1:01:26] denominational ranks we must go
[1:01:29] and share the truth with them that that
[1:01:32] will set the
[1:01:34] captive free amen i know we're not all
[1:01:38] preachers in the sense of behind the
[1:01:41] pulpit but we're all preachers we have a
[1:01:43] message
[1:01:45] you see sometimes where we get caught up
[1:01:48] though is when we're
[1:01:50] just sharing doctrine you see it's just
[1:01:53] a theology or a religion
[1:01:56] but let it be a life first amen
[1:01:59] let it be the witness of the spirit
[1:02:02] there's something about that man that i
[1:02:05] just get around him
[1:02:07] and i just start feeling good when i
[1:02:09] feel bad you know
[1:02:10] there's something like it's shedding off
[1:02:13] of me
[1:02:14] there's a pressure that i feel from the
[1:02:16] world but then i start fellowshipping
[1:02:18] with that brother
[1:02:19] and all of a sudden there's a refreshing
[1:02:21] that comes what is it about this person
[1:02:25] there is like there's like an aura
[1:02:27] around you what's going on
[1:02:40] oh my oh my thinking about
[1:02:46] you know certain doctrines and
[1:02:49] i heard about this thing and speaking of
[1:02:53] the worship you know i i said like this
[1:02:57] you know true worship is to
[1:03:01] to emulate yourself after so so there is
[1:03:04] a true worship
[1:03:07] that the bride of jesus christ gives to
[1:03:09] christ
[1:03:10] amen so when i speak of
[1:03:13] the worship of a woman don't take your
[1:03:16] mind just to the negative there's there
[1:03:18] is a pollution and a filth
[1:03:19] i i heard of this milk grotta
[1:03:23] oh my goodness people
[1:03:26] actually there's cases in the catholic
[1:03:29] church and
[1:03:30] people they try to point to it and say
[1:03:32] this is vindication
[1:03:34] vindication that they're right and so
[1:03:37] like over a thousand people who had
[1:03:41] incurable diseases supposedly
[1:03:44] the virgin mary had
[1:03:51] oh my goodness that
[1:03:54] there's like powdered milk on the ground
[1:03:57] that people if they can go and touch the
[1:04:00] the powdered milk then they can be well
[1:04:04] because it comes from the virgin mary
[1:04:09] that that just you know
[1:04:12] thank god we're not deceived you know
[1:04:16] the the questions and answers brother
[1:04:18] branham he was questioned they tried to
[1:04:20] pin him down he said
[1:04:21] you know there's people that go to the
[1:04:23] witch doctor and they say
[1:04:25] why is it that a third of 30 of the
[1:04:27] people that go to the witch doctor get
[1:04:29] healed
[1:04:30] why it's simple god honors faith
[1:04:34] they had the right approach they took
[1:04:36] the approach and their faith made it
[1:04:38] move
[1:04:39] god honors faith even if it's not in his
[1:04:42] word
[1:04:44] my but think about those who do honor
[1:04:47] his word
[1:04:47] and take his word they're going to take
[1:04:49] a body change hallelujah
[1:04:53] they hear his voice and that voice is
[1:04:55] going to bring him to a resurrection
[1:04:59] amen anything that serves god's purpose
[1:05:05] will receive a resurrection let's let's
[1:05:09] press
[1:05:10] to make that our rally cry i'm serving
[1:05:13] his purposes
[1:05:14] i have come into the world to serve his
[1:05:16] purposes
[1:05:17] and to put just like my lord did
[1:05:21] you know he he fought deception with
[1:05:24] truth
[1:05:25] and it it broke the shackles
[1:05:28] to the to those who needed deliverance
[1:05:31] the redeemable
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] praise the lord you know i just
[1:05:45] one of satan's ambitions
[1:05:49] was to try to let's say muddy the waters
[1:05:53] so he'll he'll make polytheistic gods
[1:05:57] make confusion and then it tries to
[1:06:01] smear who god is and try to
[1:06:05] put a cloud over mysteries
[1:06:08] so that people will not inquire because
[1:06:12] it's just
[1:06:13] it's too muddy my but that's
[1:06:17] there's a voice a final voice
[1:06:20] to a final age amen take courage
[1:06:23] take courage
[1:06:33] yeah i just
[1:06:36] think about something that i've heard
[1:06:39] and
[1:06:41] you know that that bamboo curtain
[1:06:44] recently they made a a renewed
[1:06:47] deal it was last last
[1:06:51] last year and
[1:06:54] just trust the lord will help me share
[1:06:56] this next part it
[1:06:58] you know we got some brothers that are
[1:07:00] doing mission work in china and
[1:07:02] you know that that's very dangerous
[1:07:06] dangerous work and
[1:07:09] you know it's it's the enemy's job
[1:07:13] to bring deception
[1:07:16] and to try to make people afraid to
[1:07:19] stand for truth
[1:07:24] and now they have
[1:07:27] made agreements to
[1:07:31] to with the with the purple curtain with
[1:07:34] rome
[1:07:35] they've made an agreement and now um
[1:07:39] you know it's they're they frown on
[1:07:42] religious liberties because
[1:07:44] as a dictatorship they have to have
[1:07:46] control
[1:07:48] and so now they have agreed
[1:07:51] to allow the catholics in
[1:07:56] but now this gospel that they're sharing
[1:08:00] is actually stating that jesus christ
[1:08:04] was guilty of a murder and a sinner
[1:08:08] think about this think about how they
[1:08:11] turned
[1:08:12] things in into a lie
[1:08:16] so now i mean you think about the
[1:08:19] persecution
[1:08:21] for christians before i mean they're
[1:08:24] they're going to drag you in
[1:08:26] and think they're doing god a service
[1:08:29] and you know
[1:08:33] that's knocking on america's door
[1:08:36] so so you know we're not we're not
[1:08:40] afraid
[1:08:41] what man can do to us you know we
[1:08:44] we know without a doubt god's promised
[1:08:48] a body change and he's gonna declare the
[1:08:52] power of the resurrection in a body in
[1:08:54] the face of his enemy
[1:08:56] we have a table spread hallelujah
[1:09:04] i just think about you know i just
[1:09:06] wanted to encourage you you know they
[1:09:07] they even call it the reconciliation
[1:09:10] deal
[1:09:11] i mean the this missionary was sharing
[1:09:15] this and i just thought
[1:09:17] you know what a devil
[1:09:21] what a devil to car lord a murderer and
[1:09:23] a sinner
[1:09:24] you know that
[1:09:28] you know it's just one of those things
[1:09:30] that you know we just want to take
[1:09:32] courage
[1:09:34] just going to share a few more things
[1:09:35] with you just to encourage you you know
[1:09:37] we're
[1:09:37] we're pressed on every hand and yet the
[1:09:40] enemy he's going to come in
[1:09:41] like a flood but god promised to raise
[1:09:44] up a standard against it
[1:09:46] there's a voice that's going to come
[1:09:48] from within
[1:09:49] that's going to lead us and guide us
[1:09:51] he's going to in that very hour he's
[1:09:53] going to give you the word
[1:09:54] and you're going to just repeat it as he
[1:09:56] gives unction
[1:09:58] you're just going to move forward in
[1:10:00] faith believing lord as i have need of
[1:10:02] it
[1:10:02] here it is unction
[1:10:10] this is a wonderful statement brother
[1:10:12] branham made in
[1:10:14] a message called looking away to jesus
[1:10:20] he said in revelation
[1:10:24] 13 plainly explains the lamb come up
[1:10:27] out of the earth and the other beasts
[1:10:29] come out of
[1:10:30] water thickness and multitude of people
[1:10:34] this lamb come up where there is no
[1:10:36] people a lamb represents a religion
[1:10:39] the lamb of god and remember it spoke
[1:10:42] like a lamb it was a lamb
[1:10:45] and then after a while it received power
[1:10:48] and spoke like the dragon and exercised
[1:10:51] all the
[1:10:52] the power of the dragon that before him
[1:10:55] the dragon is
[1:10:56] rome always so don't you
[1:10:59] see rome denominations a mark protestant
[1:11:03] denominations image unto the beast
[1:11:06] making power that'll force all
[1:11:09] protestants
[1:11:10] like a union they'll have to be in the
[1:11:13] council of churches
[1:11:15] or you won't be able to have fellowship
[1:11:17] well
[1:11:18] it's practically that way now you can't
[1:11:21] go to church and preach unless you have
[1:11:23] a fellowship card or some identification
[1:11:26] now on persons
[1:11:29] like ourselves we're going to be cut out
[1:11:32] of all of that
[1:11:33] all together that's exactly because they
[1:11:36] won't be able to do it
[1:11:37] it's it's tightening and when the time
[1:11:41] comes
[1:11:42] when the time comes and the press comes
[1:11:45] to a place where you'll press out
[1:11:48] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[1:11:51] in a few minutes
[1:11:52] watch the third pull when you see an
[1:11:55] absolutely a total loss
[1:11:57] to the total loss but it will be for the
[1:11:59] bride
[1:12:00] and the church amen so when the
[1:12:02] persecution comes
[1:12:04] watch that third pool amen there's going
[1:12:07] to be a slogan
[1:12:08] you know when you have needs and you're
[1:12:10] going you're sick
[1:12:11] or if you need a job ask god's here to
[1:12:15] hear you
[1:12:16] he's here to encourage your faith he's
[1:12:19] here to perform his good word towards
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:21] we have to grow up and learn how to
[1:12:24] accept the word of god
[1:12:25] because what we're coming to we're going
[1:12:27] to stand in the face of our adversary
[1:12:29] and put him under our feet
[1:12:36] watch i'm fixing to tell you in a few
[1:12:40] minutes
[1:12:41] watch that third pull watch that third
[1:12:48] pull
[1:12:51] his unfailing words of promise brother
[1:12:53] branham said this
[1:12:55] in 1964 on january 20th
[1:12:59] he says now
[1:13:02] i might encourage you to believe now
[1:13:05] that
[1:13:05] great gift others have tried to explain
[1:13:08] it and say how it's done
[1:13:10] that it can't be explained just wait it
[1:13:13] will not be in operation so perfectly
[1:13:15] now
[1:13:16] wait until the council of churches begin
[1:13:19] the persecution on
[1:13:21] then when it happens praise the lord
[1:13:25] praise the lord he's dropping in i mean
[1:13:28] the the faith
[1:13:29] that is in you is going to live to put
[1:13:35] you're going to see some things
[1:13:36] persecution don't fear it
[1:13:39] don't fear it the never failing
[1:13:42] presence of jesus christ is with you
[1:13:45] wherever you go
[1:13:46] he is the one performing his good word
[1:13:49] in you you just don't be ashamed and
[1:13:53] stand there in the face of it
[1:13:55] just like moses he came to the place
[1:13:57] where he says now
[1:13:59] i can't do anything and god spoke
[1:14:03] and he acted that's the same for you
[1:14:05] god's going to speak
[1:14:06] in your hour of need he's he's the same
[1:14:08] he's faithful
[1:14:10] amen that's a rally cry he's faithful
[1:14:13] he's never
[1:14:14] changed he's always been there for me
[1:14:17] he's always been there for you
[1:14:20] he's never failed you once
[1:14:24] he can't fail and he can't lie
[1:14:32] praise the lord
[1:14:38] we're going to go ahead and try to close
[1:14:41] i got
[1:14:42] just one last thing i wanted to share
[1:14:43] with you we can invite the musicians to
[1:14:46] come
[1:14:50] this is uh you know it's like
[1:14:54] people have all these causes and things
[1:14:56] that they
[1:14:58] they encourage themselves every day it
[1:15:00] becomes a slogan or a theme or a rally
[1:15:02] cry of their lives
[1:15:03] and you know it motivates them
[1:15:07] you know and and so
[1:15:13] i say this brother branham made this
[1:15:16] statement in
[1:15:18] revelation chapter four number three
[1:15:21] preached in 1961 on january 8th
[1:15:25] he said this he says now
[1:15:34] god speaking to the church reflecting
[1:15:36] himself
[1:15:37] through seven spirits when the true
[1:15:40] anointed of god
[1:15:41] speaks it's the voice of god amen take
[1:15:45] courage
[1:15:46] tonight there's a voice that matters
[1:15:48] it's when you're in tune
[1:15:50] with the spirit of god when you speak
