[23:34] amen
[23:40] [Music]
[23:48] oh
[23:53] [Applause]
[23:54] [Music]
[24:01] we might not understand everything
[24:02] that's happening right now but
[24:05] we're just trusting in his word amen
[24:08] i mean if they can just play something
[24:09] softly we'll use this time to
[24:13] bring some prayer requests before the
[24:14] lord
[24:16] and just ask to pray over the tithes and
[24:19] offerings not sure they'll be collecting
[24:21] it
[24:21] physically through the congregation but
[24:23] we do have some buckets placed out back
[24:25] if
[24:26] if you're able to give or feel led to
[24:28] that you have that opportunity
[24:30] they're also in the back
[24:35] he was i brought to my attention a
[24:37] sister piece had
[24:38] sent in an email for a prayer request
[24:40] just as i was walking out so i don't
[24:41] have
[24:42] uh it printed out but i know she was
[24:44] asking for prayer for
[24:46] for herself and a personal need and also
[24:48] asking for prayer
[24:51] for her daughter and her son so let's
[24:53] just remember sister peace and her
[24:55] family
[24:56] in prayer we also want to remember
[24:59] brother david and
[25:00] sister leslie as i believe they left
[25:02] today for
[25:03] san diego and we'll be spending time
[25:06] with
[25:08] his mother so my grandma just prayed
[25:10] that
[25:11] god would keep him and give them rest we
[25:14] just
[25:14] are anxious to get our pastor back amen
[25:18] you know we know there's there's been
[25:20] the devil's on a rampage
[25:22] my if there's if there was ever a time
[25:24] that sickness was in the land
[25:26] it's this time but you know the earth
[25:29] has seen plagues before
[25:31] and it's always the same remedy the same
[25:33] solution
[25:34] god's a healer and
[25:38] the bible says by his stripes we are
[25:41] healed
[25:42] you know and sometimes we don't
[25:44] understand all the ways of god because
[25:46] we pray for things and it doesn't seem
[25:47] like
[25:49] it ended up the way we thought but we'll
[25:52] understand it
[25:52] better by and by amen we just had a
[25:56] prayer request placed up here give me
[25:59] one moment
[26:03] sister sandra asked for the prayer for
[26:10] her sister patricia in colombia
[26:14] so that god could heal her from a
[26:16] stomach
[26:17] and colon problems
[26:22] i believe maybe sister sister sanja is
[26:24] the one asking for prayer
[26:27] we just want to remember them in prayer
[26:29] if maybe we could
[26:31] clear that up after the service but is
[26:33] the last name duarte is that correct
[26:36] i believe that's right i apologize there
[26:38] but god knows
[26:40] god knows the need that's on each heart
[26:42] and if you just
[26:43] want to make a request known by an
[26:45] uplifted hand god sees that hand
[26:46] just the very fact of you defying
[26:49] gravity and reaching out to touch the
[26:50] lord
[26:51] amen he sees that let's just say a
[26:53] prayer over the tithes and offers
[26:54] heavenly father how we love you
[26:58] we thank you lord we just take this
[27:01] opportunity to ask

[35:59] [Music]
[36:12] [Music]
[36:20] in the name of jesus christ amen
[36:33] we're going to read the two scriptures
[36:36] the word
[36:38] the first one in amos chapter eight
[36:41] versi on that place
[36:42] uh verse 11 to 13.
[36:50] and then we'll move to a very familiar
[36:52] scripture reading in malachi
[36:54] 4.
[37:00] amos chapter 8
[37:04] verse 11 it says behold the day
[37:08] the days come sayeth the lord that i
[37:11] will send a famine
[37:13] in the land nor not a famine of bread
[37:18] nor of thirst for water but the hearing
[37:22] of the word of the lord and they shall
[37:25] wander from sea
[37:26] to sea and from north even to the east
[37:31] they shall run to and fro
[37:34] and seek the word of the lord
[37:37] and shall not find it in that day
[37:40] shall the fair virgins
[37:43] and the young men faint for thirst
[37:48] also let's turn to malachi chapter four
[38:00] so from verse one it says behold for
[38:03] behold
[38:04] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[38:07] oven
[38:08] and all and all the proud yea
[38:12] and all that do wicket wickedly
[38:15] shall be shall be stubble
[38:18] and on the day that cometh shall burn
[38:21] them
[38:21] up saith the lord of hosts that it shall
[38:25] leave them neither root nor branch
[38:29] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[38:32] sign of righteousness arise with healing
[38:34] in its wings
[38:36] and ye shall go forth and grow up
[38:40] as calves of their style
[38:44] and ye shall thread down the wicked
[38:47] for they shall be ashes under the soul
[38:51] of you
[38:52] of your feet in the day that that i
[38:55] shall do this
[38:56] say with the lord of hosts remember ye
[38:59] the law of
[39:00] moses my servant which i commanded unto
[39:02] him
[39:03] in horeb for all israel
[39:06] with the statute of judgment behold
[39:10] i will send you elijah the prophet
[39:13] before the coming of the great and
[39:15] dreadful day of the lord
[39:17] and he shall turn the hearts the heart
[39:20] of the fathers
[39:21] to the children and the heart of the
[39:23] children
[39:24] to their fathers lest i come and smite
[39:27] the earth
[39:28] with a curse thinner jesus
[39:32] lord jesus
[39:36] like people that have learned to read it
[39:39] we write your word mr
[39:42] but only you can give the context
[39:46] and you can give the life that comes
[39:48] with it
[39:49] because the light will kill us but it's
[39:52] the spirit that giveth life important
[39:55] force speak
[39:56] to us once more in the name of jesus
[39:59] christ
[39:59] amen amen i have your seats
[40:07] i'm not yet able to preach in english
[40:10] in super prayer oppression and english
[40:12] so i'm obliged to preach in french
[40:17] if i try to preach in english she should
[40:20] say the question
[40:22] maybe some words you will not able to
[40:26] understand what i want to say
[40:31] so i'm glad to preach in french
[40:35] if you see don't
[40:49] to have me to speak again tonight
[40:56] and tonight uh based on the scriptures
[40:58] that we read
[41:05] i'm going to speak a little bit on the
[41:08] message
[41:09] that i titled why the message of the
[41:12] hour why the message of the end time
[41:31] we know that we are at the end time
[41:35] when we see in the bible
[41:39] everything that was described based on
[41:41] the end times
[41:43] we are leaving those things
[41:46] [Music]
[41:48] the bible tells us in second timothy
[41:50] chapter 3
[41:52] that in the end
[41:59] cruel people there will be lovers of
[42:01] pleasures more than god
[42:02] and all the riches breakers uh
[42:05] non-religious people
[42:08] and this scripture speaks also in
[42:10] matthew 24.
[42:12] that in the end time they're not
[42:14] supposed to leave
[42:27] and all of us we know we are at the end
[42:29] time
[42:33] everything that we are living right now
[42:40] what was in the time of noah what was it
[42:42] the time of lord
[42:44] natural when we look at it on the
[42:47] natural aspect of it
[42:51] are complete with a complete menthol we
[42:53] can see that those things have happened
[42:55] or they are happening right now
[42:59] and as we are at the end time
[43:04] and we know all of us that are gathering
[43:06] here
[43:08] that god has given us grace
[43:38] that god will send a famine on the land
[43:41] let's just say
[43:43] people will go to and fro
[43:47] they will go from the the north onto the
[43:49] east
[43:52] they will try to seek for the word of
[43:54] the lord
[43:56] but they will not find it the jerky
[43:59] power
[44:00] because it's god who's speaking the
[44:02] jerky prophetess
[44:04] it's god prophesying through amos
[44:21] with this prophecy of amos
[44:25] we can say all of us lose yourself
[44:29] i will condemn to seek for the word of
[44:31] god
[44:34] and not to find it a conjunction
[44:38] and when god sends the thirst
[44:42] it's like in the natural when you have
[44:45] when you are thirsting
[44:48] when you've crushed the wilderness on
[44:51] board when you've gone two weeks without
[44:52] drinking
[44:55] if you find a source of water
[44:59] even if it's dirty you're gonna drink of
[45:02] it
[45:20] here it's difficult to go a mile without
[45:22] finding a church building
[45:27] because people are thirsty
[45:30] because people
[45:36] and they are obligated to go anywhere to
[45:38] go find it
[45:41] just so they can appease their thirst it
[45:44] comes with
[45:45] like i was saying
[45:48] if we were to stay with this prophecy of
[45:50] amos
[45:53] every single one of us we were lost
[45:57] but when god thought of you and me
[46:01] god open a breach
[46:04] god called malachite
[46:07] to say that to you just for you
[46:12] that are fearing
[46:27] had decided to give this promise to it
[46:30] says for you
[46:34] behold i will send you elijah the
[46:35] prophet
[46:38] that's why i have the habit of saying if
[46:41] god has given you grace
[46:44] to sit in the church to message church
[46:47] you hear this message it's already a
[46:50] true grace
[46:52] it's the love of god it means god loves
[46:56] you
[46:56] you know otherwise
[47:00] you were going to find yourself in the
[47:01] prophecy of amos
[47:07] yeah and because of that
[47:21] we're gonna just try to see why the
[47:23] message of the end time
[47:26] what's your message why is god sending
[47:28] us this message of the end time
[47:32] we all know
[47:35] that this messenger of the end time
[47:42] uh many times i have the habit of saying
[47:46] that to those that have not believed the
[47:48] message of the hour yeah
[47:51] i'll tell them that god promised don't
[47:53] you leave the deputy
[47:55] in second peter chapter 3
[48:01] that the the heavens and the earth of
[48:04] the present
[48:04] is reserved for fire death
[48:08] that god will destroy this earth by fire
[48:11] mercury
[48:12] but just like in the time of noah the
[48:15] triloman
[48:16] god cannot destroy the earth
[48:21] without telling us which is the way of
[48:23] escape
[48:27] and today we cannot build the ark like
[48:29] noah major
[48:30] but god is obligated
[48:34] to do just like it did in the time of
[48:36] noah
[48:37] and love to send us a man
[48:40] to show us the way hey and
[48:43] malachite says
[48:59] [Music]
[49:02] according to the scriptures you will not
[49:04] receive that
[49:06] if you want to be sure to be saved
[49:10] find yourself in elijah
[49:14] be sure
[49:21] is fulfill what the scripture says that
[49:24] he's going to fulfill in this time
[49:26] why but mark is
[49:43] we're going to take first uh
[49:50] a little bit obviously it's talking
[49:51] about the transfiguration
[49:54] refills you
[50:27] and restoreth all things
[50:33] and how is it written of the son of man
[50:35] that he must suffer
[50:36] many things
[50:53] that they have done unto him what's
[50:56] whatsoever
[50:57] they listed as it is written
[51:00] description when you take the same
[51:03] description in matthew chapter 17
[51:13] that the disciple understood that he was
[51:15] talking about john the baptist
[51:18] but when we read of this scripture
[51:23] we see clearly that jesus bowed
[51:26] [Music]
[51:27] he's speaking about two separate elijahs
[51:31] he says elias must come
[51:36] [Music]
[51:40] in other words jesus is giving the
[51:42] definition to what elijah
[51:44] elias was going to do
[51:46] [Music]
[51:47] jesus is saying what elias must do any
[51:50] gender elias must come
[51:53] and he will restore all things and we
[51:57] know
[51:59] that that john the baptist didn't
[52:01] restore all things
[52:16] we know that in the book of acts
[52:21] john the baptist had already come he was
[52:24] killed it was
[52:25] here's the evidence and jesus came he
[52:28] was crucified
[52:57] when the time of the refreshing shall
[52:59] come from the presence of the lord
[53:05] and they shall send jesus christ which
[53:08] before was preached unto you
[53:12] whom the heaven must receive
[53:20] until the time of the restitution of all
[53:23] things
[53:23] don't you are paralyzed
[53:27] which god has spoke by the mouth
[53:30] of all the holy prophets since the world
[53:33] began
[53:33] since john baptists are there if john
[53:36] the baptist had
[53:38] accomplished or established everything
[53:45] jesus was not going to be received in
[53:47] heaven until the restitution of all
[53:49] things
[53:52] it means that the time of the
[53:54] restitution of all things
[53:58] something that was to be coming in the
[54:01] future when the book of acts was being
[54:02] written
[54:04] and jesus said because son that only
[54:08] elias
[54:22] anything it's talking about bringing
[54:25] something back to its original statement
[54:29] it means something was me it was
[54:31] displaced
[54:34] something lost this nature
[54:39] and that thing had to be brought back in
[54:41] the original state
[54:44] why the message of the hour the end time
[54:49] to restore all things
[55:29] but this title did has to be given back
[55:32] to us
[55:36] god had to give us a tarot deal back
[55:41] so we can come back to the original
[55:43] position
[55:45] and that's the purpose for the message
[55:47] of the hour
[55:50] it's the restitution of all things
[55:53] by the prophet elias
[55:58] it's gonna do two things you
[56:14] set
[56:18] he's saying now the messenger of malachi
[56:21] 4 in revelation 10 7
[56:25] is going to do two things
[56:44] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[56:46] seven thunders of revelation
[56:48] 10.
[56:52] which are the revelation containing the
[56:54] seven seals
[56:58] it will be this divinely revealed
[57:01] mystery truth
[57:04] divinely revealed mystery truth
[57:13] that will literally turn the hearts of
[57:15] the children to the pentecostal father
[57:18] exactly so the message of the
[57:21] end time
[57:24] for the restitution of all things
[57:28] and this restitution of all things
[57:32] according to malachi chapter four
[57:35] the hearts they don't form of children
[57:40] has to be brought back to the hearts of
[57:42] the apostles
[57:44] to the father the apostolic fathers
[57:48] we know that throughout the ages
[57:51] that they uh the gospel lost his meaning
[57:58] people didn't know what kind of god they
[58:00] were worshiping
[58:03] they were worshiping god the father the
[58:05] son and the holy spirit
[58:08] they didn't know who they were sending
[58:09] their prayers to
[58:11] let's not but you do not repair it if
[58:12] you think people were baptizing in the
[58:14] name of the father the the
[58:16] the holy spirit and the lord
[58:19] people had gone away from the gospel
[58:24] but in order for us to have the real
[58:26] phrase we focus on messaging
[58:29] that this messenger had to bring us back
[58:32] first
[58:32] from the mother that put to the
[58:34] foundation of the apostles
[58:39] to the faith that the father had allah
[58:43] to the word that was preached by the
[58:45] fathers
[58:48] to the worship that the apostles had
[58:53] and you have to know who we are
[58:54] worshiping
[59:00] i had the habit of telling my friends
[59:02] jehovah witnesses
[59:06] do you know
[59:10] it could come like as
[59:13] the dad went out
[59:16] that he changed his clothing that he
[59:19] changed the form
[59:23] he comes back and you're wondering is it
[59:24] him or is it not him
[59:26] yeah you still should give me the free
[59:27] fair but it's the only one thing that
[59:29] you need to do it's to ask to his wife
[59:33] that's good
[59:34] because to the wife he will reveal
[59:37] himself
[59:38] he never hides himself
[59:42] instead of just saying you are jehovah
[59:44] witness
[59:46] jehovah changed the forms
[59:52] and his bride he can assure you
[59:56] that your jehovah of the old testament
[59:59] it's jesus christ of the new
[1:00:01] year
[1:00:04] and that's why university in the
[1:00:07] classroom
[1:00:08] comes and one time i said i made a
[1:00:11] declaration before
[1:00:13] a friend who was a jehovah's witness
[1:00:17] i told them do you know that jehovah
[1:00:19] witnessed they don't have the holy
[1:00:20] spirit
[1:00:22] he was he was shocked he may point a
[1:00:25] bible i said take your bible
[1:00:27] jesus said that you wait in jerusalem
[1:00:32] that you will receive a power it will
[1:00:35] come upon you
[1:00:37] the holy spirit
[1:00:40] you will
[1:00:53] because the bible says
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:21] he made it in such a way that the bible
[1:01:23] has become a new book to us
[1:01:26] when we read this bible
[1:01:30] we find marvelous things in it
[1:01:34] the things that the wise and the prudent
[1:01:36] they just go over.
[1:01:39] the question about the the deity of
[1:01:42] jesus christ
[1:01:45] it can be solved by one scripture
[1:01:49] there's a lot of scripture to talk about
[1:01:50] it
[1:02:04] fifth uh verse
[1:02:08] the bible says
[1:02:12] one law it says one one lord
[1:02:16] insult for one faith
[1:02:20] one baptism as a jew
[1:02:23] one god and father of all
[1:02:30] who is above all
[1:02:45] and through all in that we will call god
[1:02:48] the son
[1:02:51] and in all of us that we would call god
[1:02:54] the holy spirit
[1:02:56] just one lord remember the same kill
[1:02:59] this to the tooth is above all
[1:03:01] barney tooth is in all truth it's in all
[1:03:04] of us
[1:03:04] all addiction and this messenger
[1:03:09] allah had to bring us back to the
[1:03:13] the faith of the apostles allah
[1:03:42] that when they will pray god that god
[1:03:45] was able to take our episode
[1:03:47] to enter into prison ascendant to break
[1:03:51] off the chains that appear
[1:03:53] to open the prison bar and to tell to
[1:03:56] peter
[1:03:58] exactly where they were exactly praying
[1:04:02] for him
[1:04:06] the faith that the father the apostles
[1:04:10] when peter and john develop when they
[1:04:13] were to get caught
[1:04:15] when they were before this uh
[1:04:18] they were looking at the man he
[1:04:21] said we have no money no silver
[1:04:24] power they didn't
[1:04:36] they need that they had this power
[1:04:52] rise up and walk paralytic
[1:04:56] and the crippled man was able to walk
[1:05:01] that's what the message is taking us
[1:05:03] back to
[1:05:06] i wanted a memphis to have that same
[1:05:08] kind of faith as the consulate said to
[1:05:10] prisons
[1:05:11] to be conscious of the power that god
[1:05:13] has given us
[1:05:16] you know many times the devil tries to
[1:05:18] lie to us
[1:05:19] to tell us we don't have that
[1:05:25] it doesn't you don't it doesn't neces
[1:05:27] you don't need to have strength
[1:05:29] that's the one man it doesn't even need
[1:05:32] for you to shake
[1:05:34] used to quiet
[1:05:49] predicate sometimes as preachers
[1:05:52] we think that the anointing
[1:05:58] when we're about to break the glass
[1:06:02] but just look
[1:06:25] that the most the most powerful
[1:06:28] anointing was upon him
[1:06:42] he's fulfilled
[1:07:12] sometimes we don't even need to pray for
[1:07:13] somebody
[1:07:15] when you have need of something who
[1:07:17] comes with that when you are sick
[1:07:21] just the preaching of the word itself
[1:07:26] the blessing that you have need off
[1:07:30] the message of the end times according
[1:07:33] to malachi
[1:07:34] how many allah bring us back to the
[1:07:37] faith of the apostles
[1:07:54] is
[1:07:57] it says there must rise a message that
[1:08:00] will shake the hearts of the people
[1:08:05] right back to the apostolic uh the
[1:08:07] apostolic fathers again
[1:08:21] a wilderness man
[1:08:27] that will come out and you will have a
[1:08:29] message that will run
[1:08:30] right straight back to the word again
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:35] that's the hour we are living in allah
[1:08:38] considerably

[1:10:11] person

[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] a light came down from heaven
[1:10:31] shining down above there community
[1:10:35] like a falling like a star falling from
[1:10:38] the heaven
[1:10:38] in what a voice said come back
[1:10:45] as john the baptist was sent to be the
[1:10:47] forerunner of the first coming of christ
[1:10:55] your message shall for run his second
[1:10:57] coming
[1:10:58] in the world
[1:11:03] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:11:08] this day je la ve pumi
[1:11:24] that god has confirmed that to whom god
[1:11:28] said
[1:11:28] grace that his message
[1:11:33] will for run the second coming of christ
[1:11:36] and that's why it's the only man
[1:11:41] to whom god has asked the magazine to
[1:11:44] to to to to to save up to store up
[1:11:48] land with you food predication
[1:11:51] all is preaching all his messages
[1:11:56] so that he could go around the world
[1:11:59] when god said that this good news
[1:12:06] has to go to the automotive parts of the
[1:12:08] earth
[1:12:10] and then the end will come
[1:12:14] he's talking about this message to go to
[1:12:16] the ends of the earth
[1:12:18] but because it's this message
[1:12:23] showing us the plane of salvation
[1:12:27] and it's this messenger
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:32] had to bring the heart of the the
[1:12:34] children back to the father the
[1:12:36] apostolic father
[1:12:39] and according to uh uh revelation 10.
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:46] it has to reveal all the mysteries that
[1:12:49] we left
[1:12:50] danielle when you take the book of
[1:12:52] daniel that is
[1:12:54] daniel chapter 12 i believe
[1:12:58] the bible said that god showed to daniel
[1:13:01] things that that's the one who said
[1:13:03] you'll ask god what will happen to these
[1:13:07] things
[1:13:08] daniel god said oh daniel it says go
[1:13:11] go in peace it says go lay in peace that
[1:13:14] shows this thing
[1:13:16] these things will remain secret
[1:13:20] until the time of the end i love please
[1:13:24] and then manny will read it
[1:13:27] and then their understanding will grow
[1:13:44] thunder illa killer he said that he
[1:13:47] wanted to write of it
[1:13:48] julia didn't know god said no
[1:13:51] don't write sell seal guard
[1:13:54] keep it second what the thunders have
[1:13:58] spoken i love what you said that at the
[1:14:01] voice of the seventh angels
[1:14:04] when it began to sound good
[1:14:07] when you proclaim his message let me
[1:14:10] tell you
[1:14:10] the mystery of god
[1:14:23] so we can have the restoration of all
[1:14:26] things
[1:14:38] so god has to send us a messenger to
[1:14:40] whom
[1:14:41] he has revealed these things to him
[1:14:45] if you don't have access as a prophetic
[1:14:49] to this prophet who brings back to the
[1:14:51] apostolic
[1:14:54] to whom that abdomen gave them the
[1:14:56] revelation of the mysteries of god
[1:15:00] you are on the side
[1:15:04] and that's the reason for the message of
[1:15:06] god
[1:15:08] that's why god sent the message of the
[1:15:10] end time
[1:15:14] today
[1:15:17] there's many preachers
[1:15:21] which by their own knowledge
[1:15:26] they are just causing uh
[1:15:31] misunderstanding chaos
[1:15:36] people think today that the revelation
[1:15:38] of the seven seals
[1:15:40] that's the revelation of the seven
[1:15:42] thunders
[1:15:46] it's to always every time when you
[1:15:49] preach just scream seven thunders seven
[1:15:51] seals seven thousand seven seals
[1:15:56] even barbara who preached the seven
[1:15:58] seals a president said
[1:15:59] so after the seven sails
[1:16:03] he preached a lot of other messages with
[1:16:06] different titles
[1:16:09] in which he didn't even mention the
[1:16:11] seven thunders or seven sails
[1:16:24] today i believe that there are preachers
[1:16:27] if brother branham was still alive
[1:16:29] that there were preachers that were
[1:16:30] going to explain brother branham's
[1:16:31] message to himself to brother branham
[1:16:35] before but but branham says i want to
[1:16:38] appreciate
[1:16:39] you know before you preach the seals
[1:16:42] god doesn't do nothing for nothing
[1:16:44] before one of my appreciation
[1:16:45] but i preached
[1:17:05] when god is just about to do something
[1:17:07] to deliver his people
[1:17:10] god sends a message to the people it's a
[1:17:13] terrible sample
[1:17:14] and it's so simple
[1:17:19] as we will see it in the breaking of the
[1:17:21] of these seals
[1:17:26] that was the purpose that was the my
[1:17:29] purpose of
[1:17:30] bringing this first second
[1:17:33] that what we'll find out so
[1:17:36] that the breaking of those seals
[1:17:39] is so simple that the smart
[1:17:43] remote then million demands we'll miss
[1:17:45] it
[1:17:47] you see it's expected you see i hope
[1:17:51] that god will anoint me for that
[1:17:52] why where is the passport this year it
[1:17:55] just goes over the top
[1:18:03] and that's the reason i thought the
[1:18:05] message of this morning
[1:18:06] will be appropriate to lay the
[1:18:08] foundation
[1:18:10] on the simplicity of god you see
[1:18:15] don't use your cash dollars how god
[1:18:18] hides himself in simplicity
[1:18:25] people are complicating things that they
[1:18:27] just causing confusion
[1:18:30] god is in the simplicity
[1:18:35] and it's not because
[1:18:41] it's not because somebody screams every
[1:18:43] day seven thunders seven seals seven
[1:18:45] thunder seven seals
[1:18:49] that he does have the revelation for
[1:18:51] seven thunders or seven sails
[1:18:56] let's take the book of second king
[1:19:02] last they called elite only that's when
[1:19:06] uh
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:20] we're gonna read and then i'm going to
[1:19:21] skip a little bit
[1:19:26] second king chapter second king chapter
[1:19:28] no second see chapter two

[1:19:36] and it came to pass that when the lord

[1:21:38] and they came to meet him and bow
[1:21:42] themselves

[1:22:11] upon some mountain unto some valley
[1:22:15] and he said ye shall not send.
[1:22:20] and when when they urged him to
[1:22:24] wender herjim when they urged
[1:22:27] when and when they urged him
[1:22:30] till he was ashamed he said send them
[1:22:34] therefore fifty men and they shot there
[1:22:37] for
[1:22:38] 50 men and they sought three days
[1:22:41] and found him not for it you see
[1:22:45] it's here the bible was telling us
[1:22:48] the prophet that they were sons of the
[1:22:50] prophet at bethel
[1:22:53] they were sons of prophets at jericho
[1:22:58] they were basically trying to preach to
[1:22:59] elisha the the
[1:23:01] the the rapture of elijah elijah if
[1:23:04] pressure is
[1:23:06] they were preaching to elisha the the
[1:23:09] the rapture of elisha
[1:23:12] in other words
[1:23:16] that they were to understand what they
[1:23:18] uh the rapture of
[1:23:20] elijah was
[1:23:24] look closely that when elijah was taken
[1:23:31] when elijah was coming back and he met
[1:23:33] the same sons of the prophet that were
[1:23:35] preaching
[1:23:35] rapture
[1:23:39] listen for hallelujah they were trying
[1:23:42] to preach to him and say well perhaps
[1:23:44] the spirit of god took him and he threw
[1:23:46] him somewhere on some mountain let's go
[1:23:48] try to find him
[1:23:51] in other words they were preaching
[1:23:52] something that they had no revelation
[1:23:54] about
[1:23:54] please don't push it they preach
[1:23:57] he's offered the demonstration they did
[1:24:00] demonstrations
[1:24:28] what
[1:24:43] just circulation these two to sort the
[1:24:45] shoes i know people say all kinds of
[1:24:47] things
[1:24:50] and we know that a lot of it is not
[1:24:52] right
[1:24:54] upon this you can not the secret import
[1:24:58] i cannot answer for what others any any
[1:25:01] man says
[1:25:04] i got to answer for what i say
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:10] i can only say what it whether it's the
[1:25:13] truth or not
[1:25:17] and i'm i'm one that has to be
[1:25:19] responsible for it
[1:25:21] another circle not whatever somebody
[1:25:24] else says
[1:25:26] i can't judge no man
[1:25:30] i wasn't sent to judge me but to preach
[1:25:33] the message
[1:25:38] it's not going to
[1:25:44] all the demonstration that people are
[1:25:46] doing
[1:25:48] around the seven sales and the seventh
[1:25:50] time
[1:25:51] it's so fun
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:26:34] today the message is not just something
[1:26:36] that's accessible to the preacher the
[1:26:38] message is that the message is
[1:26:41] accessible to all the believers
[1:26:47] and and and all the uh believers
[1:26:50] all the all believers have to be able to
[1:26:53] be
[1:26:54] uh christians
[1:27:04] the believers who would go and verify
[1:27:06] everything that the preachers will say
[1:27:12] to see what if what they were saying was
[1:27:14] conformed to the scriptures
[1:27:19] to see if what they were saying was it
[1:27:22] was was confirmed to what brother
[1:27:24] branham said
[1:27:24] they see the paper confirmed and if it
[1:27:27] wasn't so
[1:27:28] they would not receive it
[1:27:49] the preachers are given they they they
[1:27:52] are given the gift to go and take the
[1:27:54] scriptures and put scriptures together
[1:27:56] so they can bring the image to the
[1:27:58] people
[1:28:13] and revelation 10 7
[1:28:19] in order for god to confirm him at the
[1:28:21] same time
[1:28:26] and he wanted to accomplish something
[1:28:28] else in this ministry
[1:28:34] according to luke 17 8 uh 18 to
[1:28:38] uh 28 to 30. second
[1:28:55] god wanted to manifest the sign of the
[1:28:58] the signs of the son of man
[1:29:02] through the ministry of elijah we know
[1:29:07] in the time of abraham justice
[1:29:10] god made a body
[1:29:14] god entered into the body
[1:29:17] with two angels he visited abraham
[1:29:22] he manifested the sign of the son of man
[1:29:26] in the time of jesus do you remember god
[1:29:29] himself
[1:29:29] the fabric he made a body in the womb of
[1:29:33] mary
[1:29:34] manifested to sin defeat the lord and he
[1:29:36] manifested the son of
[1:29:38] the sign the son of man to the jews
[1:29:42] and to the samaritans and we know
[1:29:46] according to scriptures that there's
[1:29:49] three races of people
[1:29:51] the jews
[1:29:55] samaritans who are half jew have
[1:29:57] gentiles
[1:29:59] and the gentiles
[1:30:03] and god promised according to the this
[1:30:05] scripture of luke 17.
[1:30:10] that it will manifest the same thing for
[1:30:12] the gentiles
[1:30:17] but contrary to what god did in the time
[1:30:19] of abraham
[1:30:21] and even in the time of jesus in our
[1:30:24] generation
[1:30:27] god didn't make another body
[1:30:32] god took immortal man and i'm not done
[1:30:34] lupita
[1:30:35] a man born of sin conceit dominicity
[1:30:38] it's someone who was
[1:30:39] born in iniquity to whom god
[1:30:43] had made just given grace
[1:30:48] for god to take him and express himself
[1:30:50] to his people
[1:30:53] but that didn't make that person refit
[1:30:56] the lord
[1:30:56] remember the son of man himself
[1:31:00] says
[1:31:14] three one two seven read it when you go
[1:31:18] home when you get home

[1:31:37] but the messenger is revealing the son
[1:31:40] of man
[1:31:41] fell a distance no can you get it
[1:31:43] separated now
[1:31:49] difficult that's where it seems to be so
[1:31:52] hard for you
[1:31:55] it's very difficult today question
[1:32:11] that was in the time of jesus that in
[1:32:14] this time is also god
[1:32:16] the messenger says it was
[1:32:19] that the messenger the messenger
[1:32:23] is not the son of man
[1:32:26] that is revealing the son of man it is a
[1:32:29] sackiest song with the tell me this
[1:32:31] he says that's where it seems so hard
[1:32:33] for you
[1:32:34] lovely man not the son of man melo
[1:32:37] but the seventh angel the section the
[1:32:40] seventh
[1:32:41] messenger of the lord
[1:32:44] is revealing to the public the son of
[1:32:46] man
[1:32:49] because it left a left shark in the
[1:32:52] paper unfair
[1:33:06] here there's one anointed ones the sword
[1:33:09] is on choi
[1:33:10] they're so-called believers and the
[1:33:13] unbelievers
[1:33:15] the formal and the pentecostal church
[1:33:19] stand up against the true grain
[1:33:22] fully syrup manifested
[1:33:26] but let them alone their foley will be
[1:33:28] made manifest
[1:33:29] bless their heirs you see i understand
[1:33:32] you now

[1:33:56] luke 17 30 the manifestation of the son
[1:33:59] of man
[1:34:00] and all those things
[1:34:14] to the position of the sons and
[1:34:16] daughters of god
[1:34:21] the position of the sons and daughters
[1:34:23] of god who can manifest christ
[1:34:28] who can show that he's the same
[1:34:30] yesterday today
[1:34:56] so we're going to start from first
[1:35:12] but in the day of the voice of the
[1:35:14] seventh angel contest

[1:35:19] mysterious

[1:35:22] mysteries of god should be finished

[1:40:17] and he had a book that john that john
[1:40:20] had to eat a conjunct

[1:40:47] everybody is against
[1:41:05] you see who's that all the women you are
[1:41:08] out of yourself
[1:41:11] it's hard to digest it

[1:42:21] to our original position let me see if
[1:42:24] the musicians could come
[1:42:26] to mr

[1:42:41] faith the apocalypse with this is set
[1:42:43] and revelation 10 7. foreign
[1:42:57] revelation 10 7 is going to add upon the
[1:42:59] faith that the

[1:43:04] another faith for the rapture
