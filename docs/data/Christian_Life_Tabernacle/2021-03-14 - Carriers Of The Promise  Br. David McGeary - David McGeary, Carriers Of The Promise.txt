that your children may be blessed this morning thank you dear heavenly father for what you've done for us we commit our life and everything to thy hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen [Music] amen want to welcome everyone in the house of god all our visitors amen i'm pretty sure we're feeling the effect of daylight saving it's never fun when you lose amen amen god bless you money fight for the mike for some reading this morning god bless you today you know it's always amazing to me when you read the scripture even though it was written thousands of years ago it still feels often very much like it's pulled out of today's headlines you know psalm 14 we'll be reading that this morning and it opens with this verse it says the fool hath said in his heart there is no god you know if you read psalm 14 and psalm 53 these chapters are virtually identical they're mirrors of each other and both of them begin with this same sobering statement you know i got to thinking about how significant that statement was but at the end of the day it sums up what a foolish person is it's someone that in their heart there is no god you know proverbs 23 7 says this for as he thinketh in his heart so is he you know in everything that these people do everything they say everything they think how they conduct themselves the decisions they make all arises out of the fact that in them there's a declaration that there's there's no absolute there's no divine plan you know everything is random nothing really matters there's no right or wrong you know they're basically free to chart their own course jesus said in matthew 12 for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh you know as we'll read in in psalm 14 here there is an effect a result of that kind of a heart you know and where we're watching both in the psalm and in the society around us as an entire civilization built around the fact that there is no god in their heart you know and the fact is is that their heart is speaking the truth because if there is no god in their heart how can they witness anything different right you know sooner or later you know the heart of a fool will manifest itself in a walk of iniquity a walk of iniquity is doing your own thing walking according to your own heart just doing what feels is right proverbs 28 26 says this he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool proverbs 18 2 says a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart may discover itself how many times have you heard about people going to find themselves that's the journey of a fool that's right proverbs 16 25 says this there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is destruction is death you know so as we read psalm 14 it's hard to miss the fact that the entire chapter almost and in the entire society we live in is constructed of people fulfilling the scripture you know it makes an interesting statement about these people in verse 5 it says there were they in great fear in psalm 53 its mirror scripture says there were they in great fear where no fear was you know so the result of this is not just a life of iniquity but an entire life an entire society an entire civilization of constant fear fear of harm fear of man fear of finance fear of safety and death and all these things you know it's a sad condition but buried in the scripture although the whole thing may talk about the heart of a fool and the effect thereof and the fact that there is no god there buried in the scripture is a little verse where there is god you know it's hidden away is this little verse one little statement where he may be found it says in verse 5 but god is in the generation of the righteous while he may not be found in the heart of the fool he can be found in the generation of the righteous you know that's an interesting statement the generation of the righteous and just every once in a while i'll just look up the word in webster's dictionary just to say just to see what it would say this is the very first definition of generation a body of living beings constituting a single step in the line of descent from an ancestor all i could say is amen when i read that you know hidden away in this chapter when everything seems to be built around foolishness there's just this little place where there's a generation of the righteous one a line that is a part of the lineage of their ancestor you know we certainly see foolish hearts on every side but i just wonder if there isn't those that are part of the generation of the righteous here this morning i think we can all testify the fact that once we were among those that had a foolish heart now can we be found part of the generation of the righteous a final witness a final testimony in this final age right so as we read psalm 14 this morning again it's just a really short chapter and while this civilization of foolishness around us may dominate the headlines you know i'm grateful that in verse 3 when it says when god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god he found in verse 5 that god is in the generation of the righteous so let's just read that together psalm 14 is just really short starting in verse 1 it says the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat of my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the righteous ye have shamed the council of the poor because the lord is his refuge oh that the salvation of israel will come out of zion when the lord bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad [Music] amen oh my heavenly homies yes i feel [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] shall be mine i feel like traveling [Music] oh one and another oh [Music] oh yes i feel like [Music] oh and the lord has been so good to me [Applause] oh jesus oh [Applause] oh [Applause] what you want woah oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] oh oh hallelujah we'll tell you is [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] oh church [Music] oh as i look [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] hands is oh [Music] [Music] our spirit more and more oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] what is

life is easy when you're up on the mountain you've got peace of mind like you've never known then things change when you're done [Music] for the god on the mountain is still god in the valley when things go wrong he'll make them right for the god of the good times is [Music] for the god on the mountain is the god in the valley [Music] when things go wrong he'll make them right for the god of

[Music] is the god in the night god bless you amen aren't you glad it's the same god all the time amen it hasn't changed amen we have some requests you want to bring me for the church sister your senior rights god bless you brothers and sisters please pray for a co-worker who is suffering from the illness that is causing paralysis in half of his body his name is francisco said they want to bring francisco before the lord this morning but as joelle writes uh prospero arenas please pray for her healing for healing for his healing as he's on the respiratory as he's suffering with covert amen certainly when i touch him amen i know the lord has healed covert many times i mean in fact there's no disease that can stand before him amen we could bring it before the lord also us it's the sorry words husband they texted me last night that his brother wise passed away and certainly want to be remembered in prayer so we pray that god will comfort them and be with them at this time if you have a need upon your heart just leave to end up to him amen aren't you glad we're standing his presence this morning that we can come to him and he will speak to us the brothers that are taking the offering is sick if they could come amen orlando if we could just come and take this needs before the lord [Music] [Music] let us buy our heads requests before the table here [Music] questing my heart those that with uplifting hands i want you to know that god sees that hand and that he's no respected person the same god that brought many of us even our brother billy here from covet he's the same god today that can do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we can ask or think of not according to some doctor or some knowledge or some power but he says that it's according to the power that worketh in you and we just pray lord god that if the hearing of your word today that faith will arise that we can speak those things that be not as though they were father we thank you lord god for the move today lord god [Music] and i just pray father today lord god not by power not by might but by thy spirit lord god that something of work will be done lord god father in the healing lord god

all glory honor and praises into thy name and is unto thy name alone lord jesus day we pray it is in thy name the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray today in jesus name amen sister melinda has a testimony this morning and then if she can come and right after that brother isaac he could bring me special amen yes thank you god bless you i gotta be able to hold my security blanket so um i just wanted to start off so i'm dealing with some allergies um i just wanted to start off with saying how much i've appreciated the testimonies that have been given here lately brother mary's testimony on wednesday night which is phenomenal my brother kyle's testimony last sunday morning and then brother joel testimony sunday night for such faith builders to me because it just builds on what i'm about to tell you that god has done for me um over many years i've had issues with headaches and um i usually get them when i'm really overly tired or the weather changes and um considering migraines i guess and i've never really been to the doctor about them um and a week ago thursday i ended up getting one of those headaches in the afternoon and started taking medication and just laid down on the couch and took some more medicine later and it just wasn't going away and so i just started praying and of course it eated up later that evening and i was like okay you know thank you lord it's going away and um woke up friday morning and my head was hurting again just still lingering a little bit i said no i'm going to fight through this i've got some errands i got to do today and i've just got to get some things done so um i went on to the store and things and tim calls me while i'm at the store and asked me how i was feeling and i said well i thought i was going to be okay but i'm really not feeling well i didn't really i don't know if i was wearing a mask and i said i don't know if this was adding to it i said i can't breathe and i said my head's really starting to hurt so i think i'm just going to try to go home and try to eat a little something and go to bed lay down so um i went back home and i ate a little a little bit and i laid down the couch again and i fell asleep for a little while and i woke up and my head was hurting so bad so much pain and pressure on my right side then i could hardly even open my eyes and i said well i'm just going to get i'm just going to go to bed and um i was like you know well should i call tim or you know um i was really getting scared to my blood pressure my blood pressure was kind of up and um so i just got my phone and i laid down on the bed as i'll keep beside me because my brother joel said you know case i need to call 9-1-1 or something you know or call tim in the middle of all this but um i was like you know i think i'm just going to turn on the tape well i couldn't see well enough to pull up the table to pull up you know try to search for a tape or whatever so i just knew where the lifeline app is on my phone and i didn't i knew where it was so i clicked on it and i think voice radio it just plays continuous messages so i just pushed pushed it and um just laid down and it was at the end of the tape i think it was perseverant that that's what it said it was in the prayer line and um i finished that one off and it started the next tape and i heard brother branham say he started off just as numbers and then he goes in and he speaks a little bit and i fell asleep and um it was probably about an hour or so and i woke up to brother branham saying pretty forcefully speak to the rock it'll bring forth this water so i thought you know well i must be listening to speak to the rock um and my head was still really hurting um it was pounding and i was just like you know lord your prophet said speak to the rock and you're my rock and i need a healing touch from you and i'm i was kind of delirious and just kind of in and out of sleep and just i just continued to pray i could still hear brother ran him in the background by not really comprehending what he was saying but i heard him talking about the story of blonde bartimaeus and um sorry and um i was kind of fell back asleep for just a few minutes and my back up my head was just pounding and i could hear brother brandon was in the prayer line or he was praying and um i said lord please help me and i felt this strange feeling come over me and from the top of my head to my feet this tingling three times it happened and i wasn't sure what was happening it really kind of scared me because it was pretty overwhelming and so i just like there and i was kind of like i said kind of delirious type and here's still here brother branham and he was praying and then the tape ended and i woke up like wide awake my headache was gone and i was like and i stood up and i was just like okay did that just really just happen to me and i just got up into us just praying praising god for what he had done and tim called about about then and he asked checking on me and i said i told him i said i don't know what just happened and i just proceeded to tell him and he said well i don't know but on he said i do know that god's a healer and you know the next couple of days i was thinking okay well you know this is god just really touched me like that i really feel his presence that strong and the devil was just fighting me on it oh no you know it's just all in your mind you know you're just you know you tell somebody that they're gonna think you're crazy and um then come church sunday morning and brother kyle gave his testimony and tim just kind of looked over at me and i just kind of grinned and went on throughout the day and then come to church sunday night brother joel against his testimony and i was like you know what i really need to go back and listen to that message and really listen to what god said in it and uh so i pulled up on the table speak to the rock and there's three messages that came up and i was like okay well i remember brother brown started out with numbers and so i listened to the beginning of each one and um it was november 15th 1953 in owensboro kentucky and i just prayed i said god i need some confirmation because i'm listening to this so if you'll allow me i'm just going to read just a little bit of what came from that message and he's um brother brandon was reading from numbers chapter 20 verse 7. and it said and lord spake unto moses saying take thy rock and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak to the rock before their eyes and it now i want you to notice it shall bring forth his his is a personal pronoun now now see it shall bring forth his water and thou shalt bring forth water before them and out of the rock and he went on and listened to the you know more the message and it came to the part where i woke up where he said speak to the rock he said it'll bring forth its water and they went everywhere and they couldn't find water nowhere god told them god speak to the rock go speak to the rock ridiculous the carnal mind would have said well that's the driest place in the desert the rock was the oldest driest looking place and yet where they sang through every old little old place where there ought to be water no water went to this oasis no water went down here where the spring was no water and then god tells them to do the ridiculous go speak to the driest thing there is an old rock setting up there on the hill go speak to that it'll bring forth water well where's the water at well if any water would be down here in the valley not up there on the hill not in that dry rock but that's where it is today when the god is done when the doctor has done everything he can do for you he's saying through every doctor's office every hospital yet god said speak to the rock and it goes on it's um it says that the doctor can't do anything for me how in the world is anything else going to do well just speak to the rock and find out moses went out there spoke to the rock and when he spoke to the rock the waters began to flow and people began to drink now are you on speaking terms with the rock today listen brother i believe it's time we spoke to the rock don't you believe so and then he goes on and talks about um why bartimaeus gives that little story and then it comes down to the part when he was praying and it's at the end of the message and he says strange as it seems with your head bowed the angel of the lord is here at the platform i know he wants to bless you strange how he jerked me out of that wasn't it i never had anything like this happen right here is that light standing right in the room right now god of heaven be merciful he says see hang over that little girl just now back here over on my left hand side she's got kidney trouble mother next to her with liver trouble the little boy sitting there he's got low blood pressure here he comes up here to this road right here in front of me hanging right over here there's something wrong with that lady sitting there she's got something wrong with her head she's got head trouble and the one sitting next to you has the same thing and lady next to you here and the man sitting there also the same thing three of you and that's the truth isn't it there you are all three of you with your hands up you can go home and get well it leaves you and it's light all around you i just want to give god all the glory he's still the same he's really today forever and he's still a healer thank you god bless you church just a closer walk with me [Music]

lord that's the god we serve we worship you for that this morning lord we give you praise we just ask you to be with each of our hearts this morning as we endeavor to serve you encourage us this morning father enlighten our understanding father that we might know your ways that we might recognize the enemy father in his every trick that he pulls we need you this morning father and we come before you as a needy people we ask these things today in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless if you have your bibles let's turn over into saint luke this morning and the fourth chapter and i i really really appreciated that testimony this morning you know i was i don't have a video in my uh my room back there so that's why i keep having to step out every service because i i can't see back there at all but um and i don't hear very good anymore so but you know when she held those three fingers up i knew there was some significance did i didn't know what it was you know what i mean but it was like a big question mark you know why three why three and then when he said that spirit come down on those three people oh don't taste the same yesterday today amen you know if he could do that for our sister he can do that for you today you know and uh you know and and i just thought it was so beautiful because you don't think like those things will happen to you you believe they're for everybody else but they're not for everybody else they're for you every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and every line amen amen so i'm not going to be long this morning because you've all lost an hour of sleep i certainly did in fact i wake up almost the same time every sunday morning it's just i just do that it's just kind of been i guess so many years while i woke up at the same time i always woke up but the clock it left you know it ran it ran ahead so i'm still trying to catch up this morning but do you love him this morning if you just bear with me this morning as we just speak our heart to you i am leaving this wednesday to go see my mother i haven't been able to see her and and my my sister lives out there and my sister is kind of protective so she didn't want me to see my mother and so i've been really wanting to go out there and see her she's 98 years old this july she'll be 99 she still cooks she still walks she doesn't hear as good as she used to but she can still carry on a conversation she she's really a marvelous uh person to be so full of joy and happy and still a tremendous wit and to carry on a great uh conversation and and so i'm really thrilled to go out and then i'm gonna try to get back out there for a 99th birthday if the lord will grant that so i'm excited about going to see her and of course we have wonderful brothers here that'll take care of the services for you but if god keeps us moving you know we need him amen we're not built on a man we're not built on a personality we're built on revelations because that's what the church is built on it's built on revelation and and that's what you you have is you have that great revelation in your heart let's read this scripture m and uh this message that we're speaking on is the message that follows birth pains so this is the next message brother branham preached after birth pains and we'll try see if lord will help us tied it together a little bit and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive and recover this sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the lord isn't that wonderful i mean what a what a wonderful and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in this synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen father bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning you know the background to this and i'm not going to preach to you this morning the message this day this scripture is fulfilled uh i really recommend to sit down and to listen to this but there was a little something that came out of it that struck my heart and if i could say that a message within a message uh one of those little things that the lord whispers to you and uh uh it he kind of hid in there maybe just for me personally but it's still one of those great little things if i could call it that an understanding and that's one thing that we always desire is to have our understanding enlightened uh the you know the scriptures isn't always did you hear it anybody can hear but did you understand it you know and uh you know the story behind this brother branham preached the message called birth pain and when he went to at the businessmen's meeting to preach that sunday afternoon he went to read a scripture and he had a brand new bible and the two pages in the bible stuck together so he would look at the 16th chapter and then when he turned it over he ended up in the 17th chapter and he didn't realize those books were stuck together those pages were stuck together well they had a visitor visiting him and he was the archbishop of a catholic priest he was the archbishop of one of the eastern groups of the church and he got up with all his robes on and everything and he walked over to brother branham and and and told him here read it from my book and and so brother brahm took his bible and he read the scripture about the church being in travail like a woman being in a travail you know a woman represents the church and how to be in trouble and he turned around and he thanked the brother and later on you know his wife was telling him how bad she felt how nervous she was because she gave him that bible for his birthday and and and so he was driving down the road and all of a sudden a voice spoke to him and said the priest handed him the book and and and then he realized how beautiful all that was transpiring he was preaching the birth of the church and that's what was taking place amen that the church was being birthed and it wasn't the church of ages gone by that were being birthed it's a church for this age that being that is coming to pass so you're we're not part of the church of uh the message of uh luther and that church we're a part of that church but that life has moved on and that life has moved on and we noticed that we read in the scriptures in in revelations chapter 13 that we saw that the beast was wounded but then he came back and he could begin to prevail and he began to conquer and denominate every time the spirit moved he came with his spirit and tried to conquer it and denominate it and bring it under his system and that's what satan always tries to do he's the prince of the air and he wants to try to bring everybody under his system he exalted himself above the angels and all the sons of god and he wanted to sit on the throne as god and so we actually know the purpose of the enemy the purpose of the enemy is to rule over you that's what he wants to do he'll use any means he can to rule you and control you he'll use the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life he'll do whatever that he can do to be able to somehow take control of your life and if in in doing so without realizing it we become his servants and we labor under his rule to build his kingdom because i honestly think that guy is such a liar and satan is so deceived that you know the worst liar is someone that believes his own lie you know that's when you know you're hurting because when you believe your own lie you know so uh you know that's like looking in the mirror and saying man that's a good looking mirror you know you better pray through a little while but and so in in in in trying to just captivate and rule that every time god makes a move he cannot duplicate god he's not a creator god creates god created this bride church by his spoken word by the message that he sent and the word that he preached he created or brought into existence he said let there be and so as satan came up and so in conquered he once again was there in the pentecostal at the end of the pentecostal or church age he once again had captivated it he had turned them away from its purpose he had turned them away from their goal and and in in doing so uh the the messenger of the age was preaching out that that if there's got to be a birth there's got to be a church born and he expressed how that they've gone through all these pains and so we talked about it uh last week that we we we weren't preaching that maybe the gospel to the age or re preaching birth pains but what we spoke about was that that that's the way that it is he prophet of god says birth pains are to be so we each go through our our birth pains everything where there's a process that you have to go through you go through the mental battle you go through the physical battle you go to try to place it in your life you go through the struggle of trying to figure things out and all this is transpiring in you and many times you don't even realize where you are or what's going on and you don't you don't realize the the the struggle and that you're going through but that's part of the process because god's taking you to something and every time you come out of one environment into another environment there's a transition that takes place there's a birth pain that takes place as you grow up and and as as you are birthed yes and so in going into this uh um he was preaching out of the birth pains and he was beginning to speak that uh to the the the church and so the lord spoke to him and and gave this scripture to him this day this scripture was fulfilled and so brother van went back when he preached this message he preached uh about the hour that we live in so it's really a wonderful message it to me is one of the the best um places to get a real good revelation on the ministry of the son of man and and the messengers of oral roberts and billy graham and how that god went out to the church the different things that transpired in his ministry to bring it to pass but there's a little something different that came out of this message for me uh personally and i'd just like to share that with you because i know in my own personal life i'm going through a great uh uh birth pain of you know trying to come out of the way that i've lived my life for so long and trying to move into a different uh to just a different aspect and i don't know what it holds and and that's the hardest thing is we we like to step if we know where the step is you know what i mean and we like to step there if it's firm and it's solid but the step of faith is is the unknown step that's right you know i we used to tell a little story and you heard about it the man that fell off a cliff and he was holding on to a limb and and he kept yelling lord save me lord save me and the lord said i'll save you my son. and he said well lord save me lord save me and finally the lord said let go you know and it's it that's that birth pain and it we talked about that earlier in the service before that like we have catches we have things that we cling to and and we find we have those little safe spots that we cling to the understanding we cling to and we do that you know we cling to people sometimes and we we cling to little groups and the way that people are doing things we're not sure of the steps we take so we attach ourselves to the things that are around us and and we have little way places that we catch things but god really wants to birth a church into places that they've never walked before because he wants us to walk by faith he wants us to come up to a higher ground he wants the things that transpired with our sister and and listening to that tape going back and seeing the word of god and seeing that the very spirit that was working on that tape from that tape as she listened to it that spirit worked again i've experienced that a time or two in my life where the very thing that was wrong with me was the very thing that brother branham called out and it really made a great difference one of those experiences was the extreme extreme terrible stomach condition i had and on the wings of a snow white dove when brother bran was spoke at i i was made i was made whole and and so he's just living this morning i just and and that's our desire is that each of us can personally find that spot that we come in contact with that living god and know that he is real to us and so this little message that i want to share or a fellowship that i want to share with you before we baptize sister hannah this morning is is called carriers of the promise carriers of the promise and and it ties back to a little bit about birth pains but just to let it settle in our our thing so jesus is standing here he says we stand here tonight and say that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that is a wonderful statement that certainly that we make that he is the same yesterday today and forever and excuse me a moment and and so he makes that statement that he's the same yesterday and forever now when god god is the interpreter of his word that is how god god is the interpreter of his word is when he vindicates and proves it to be so right so god is the interpreter of the word when he vindicates it and proves it to be sold so he says that's his interpretation by making it come to pass there's where god's interpretation is when he makes his word come to pass he is interpreting it to you so when god makes his word come to pass that's the interpreter to you so you could hear many testimonies and those testimonies are god interpreting the word to them and bringing it to past but it comes back to that great spot in to where that were carriers of that word and so we stand here tonight and say that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now god is the interpreter of that right in other words god has got to interpret what does it mean that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so let me just emphasize that point everything that spoken comes to pass by interpretation everything that's spoken god interprets by bringing it to pass therefore everything that's spoken must come to pass so yeah that's something that we can look for that we're anchored in that we can be sure of the things that god spoke will come to pass god does not speak philosophy he doesn't speak dogma he doesn't speak catechism when he speaks it comes to pass if he says let there be there will be he says let there be light though it took thousands of years whatever it took one day that light came to pass and we knew what the interpretation of let there be light because there was light and we could say this is light yes so we could stand back and say that scripture has come to pass and that is fulfilled so that that's how that we know it and and these are principles that we've got to anchor in our hearts if we're going to march forward and be that church that's prophesied if we're going to march forward and fulfill those things that are going to transpire in our day then we've got to understand the principles of battle right we've got to understand this is how the general works this is how this is his battle plan to this is this how the great the great warriors of the day the great things that george patton they said that the reason george patton was able to defeat rummel was because he read rumble's book he said i read your book i know that i know what you're going to do here he studied those great generals studied what the thinking was what the thinking was to behind the strategy and i don't like to use that word because god doesn't need a strategy but god's got a strategy we call that a plan god has a plan because that's what his desire is he's got a plan and the sooner that we understand his plan then the more comfortable that we can rest in it and then that's what god does he keeps bringing he interprets it by bringing it to pass so we if we know that then we don't try to create right anything in the meantime we actually see it transpire by revelation if then it becomes real to us so he said he's standing here at tonight and says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god is obligated to prove that to be so because it's his word amen he's obligated to bring it to pass he's obligated to interpret that to us now don't take that as a group don't take that as a doctrine if he spoke that to you i'm the same yesterday today and forever then he's obligated to you to interpret that to you and bring that to pass to you i can stand here today and say i want to know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now sister saturn says spoke here today and they showed and spoke how that he's the same yesterday today and forever praise god she's had that experience but i want it okay we don't even want to even think that we want to use the word obligate but obligate just another word of faith that's good correct faith says i believe god's going to bring this to past i believe this is going to happen i believe that it's it's true and i'm looking for the interpretation i'm looking for it he's obligated okay and that's what he does he says because it's his word now what does it do it takes faith in believing it it takes faith in believing his word that it is the truth so just think really what faith is faith is just simply believing his word is the truth what he said is true i believe what he said is true i don't need an explanation i don't need to philosophical meaning behind it i don't need to know how it fits in the theology of our doctrine or our church i just need to know that god is going to take that word and interpret it to me personally by bringing it to pass and i'm looking for that because i believe it's true i'm looking for it because i believe it's true and so that what we're talking about carriers of the promise carriers of the promise people men that looked at it and believed it was true i think though one of the greatest examples that we go to is noah god told noah it was going to rain that there was going to be a flood and so this was spoken to noah so these great carriers of the promise is what god spoke of them and to them so god spoke it and now when god spoke it of them and to them they now became a carrier of the promise they were a carrier therefore they looked for it to come to pass because that that's what they did they had they believed it was true noah believed that it was going to rain and there was no scientific evidence it was going to rain there was no proof that it was going to rain there was no structure on the earth or no history that supported rain there was only one thing that supported rain is that god said so that it was his word and if god spoke it he's obligated to bring it to pass and he's obligated to know what the interpretation was so if i was in the days of noah can i believe i would be on the ark i might have been on the ark as a horse or something but i was gonna be there you know if noah came up and said it's going to rain what's what would be your first question what's rain yeah what you talking about right that's just like when you tell somebody what's the holy spirit that's what a lot of people should ask what's the holy ghost we'll get there gloria so what's rain so now you go so here's noah god spoke to noah now noah is a carrier of the promise amen he's got the promise he if i could say it this way he stuck with it amen and it stuck to him so he he's now a carrier of the promise he's got this in his heart he's got it in his soul he's got it in his being he hasn't seen it come to pass yet but he believes it's true so now he's a carrier of it he's carrying the load of it he's carrying the joy of it that he's becomes a carrier of the promise now the promise has rested in him and is set within his heart in seed form he's now a carrier of that promise he's a carrier of that word it's going to reign god's going to destroy this place that's right now this this is now beca becomes him because he's a carrier of that promise it it's sitting in his heart because he he believes it's true amen that that's what he believes he believes it's true so if he believes it's true he knows that god is obligated to bring it to path keep you can't have faith if you don't believe that god's obligated but you understand he had to carry that for a long time he had to carry that for for a very long time in his heart and you know can just think of that and may i say this the hour that we're living in this day this scripture is fulfilled to this day the evening lights have come and we failed to see it so we understand that we're carrying a promise yes sir it might seem to people that it's been a while come on preacher but not to god [Music] because god if you go back to every place in the scripture every believer had a season of carrying the promise that was that's part of the obligation that's part of the birth experience that's part of what god looks for is carriers of the promise i'm carrying this promise i believe it's true i'm now a part of the plan of god the part of the plan of god was for his believers to carry the promise for a season it just it it it's beautiful because uh when you you go to see it so if you see that they're carriers they become carriers of the promise the product hasn't manifested yet the promise hasn't been interpreted yet but the first step in it coming to pass the first step in the transition of the interpretation there has to be a carrier of the promise to the fulfillment thereof somebody has to carry the promise to the fulfillment amen like you have a potluck somebody's got to carry the food to the potluck before the potluck comes to pass you know what a potluck is right i know i say things and then people say what's a potluck a pot looked when you have a you can have a meal and everybody brings a dish and you just hope there's some lucky good tasting food in it so if that's why it got the terminology potluck you know and you hope that not everybody being bring beans and cornbread so if you understand somebody's got to carry the promise to its fulfillment that's the plan of god if i could say that that was the strategy of god to end it may be that way because that's the first thing that separates unbelief because their faith was only based on a man-made timetable it should come to pass by this day that's why men have always continually been trying to predict the time in the hour of this it'll be in this year it'll be on this date they'll go to this place they'll do this they'll get all these it you know okay and then on the other hand people are saying oh it's just another doomsday it's just another end of the world thing well the world today don't believe they're going to end they're jumping up and down because they think that future generations are going to go live on mars does anybody in here want to go live on mars no i'm looking for a new heaven and a new earth i'm looking for a great pyramid city i want to live in the city where the lamb is the light amen that's where i want to go that's what it's all about i believe it's true and i'm a carrier of the promise till it comes to pass we're carriers of the promise that's been the plan of god to be a carrier of the promise the holy ghost is the word of god in you [Music] the holy ghost is what god has spoken of you and to you the word so in essence the word and the holy ghost are the same thing that's why satan wanted to bust them up into three parts the father the son the holy ghost why that'll confuse you to no end but when you know that jesus said i will not leave you nor first take you but i will come again i will send the comforter i the personal program is the same word [Music] in you you know people misunderstand that you know the prophet of uh john the baptist he introduced jesus christ but he introduced the flesh you understand that's why he said behold the lamb of god that's what he introduced he introduced the word in flesh form because he was going to be a sacrifice for our sins the elijah in our day didn't introduce jesus christ in the flesh form he introduced them in the word form the same one that was here in the flesh is the same one that's here in his words or in his promises and if he promised you and he spoke to you and you're a carrier of that promise then you have the holy spirit the promise in you don't look at it from the standpoint of how moral you are because there's a lot of people who are more moral than you are and yet they'll believe that the pillar of fire and this vindicated messengers a bunch of nothing but it's a whole lot more i think than we realize it says the holy ghost is a word of god in you that identifies itself by accepting that word the spirit itself identifies itself in you by accepting the promise in other words you say i accept that i believe it's true now i am going to become a carrier of that not for a season we've had those that have ran out and have come to great fame anyway but they they didn't continue with us because they weren't of us they couldn't carry it to their reproach they couldn't carry it through the calendar as the years clipped off they couldn't carry it when they were questioned but if the spirit was there the spirit would identify itself in you by believing it that it's true they can look at you and say you're still sick yeah but i still am carrying the promise [Applause] i am not the producer i am the carrier a sheep doesn't produce wool he bears wool i just carry the promise well when's it come to pass i don't know i'm not called to bring it the path i'm called to carry it i'm a carrier of it [Music] i'm packing the promise somebody's got a packet to its fulfillment somebody's got to carry it to the time to the hour that it comes to pass that's what i'm called to do i'm called to carry the promise [Applause] that's what noah did he carried the promise he did everything he was told to do and it still hadn't come to pass but one day he was in there and that door shut and he walked up there and sat on that top of that thing out there wherever he walked out the window and whatever how it was designed and then rain started coming he said oh this is rain god was obligated to show me rain i've carried the promise all these years and now today i can say this day this promise is fulfilled [Applause] i've carried it to its fulfillment thank you lord you've finally vindicated it you finally brought it to pass hallelujah this is rain this day amen this word this promise has been fulfilled in me moses the same thing carried the promise he said you bring these people back to the mountain i don't care what trouble he went through how much no pharaoh resisted him do you understand what what allowed him to go through the resistance was the fact that he was carrying a promise all pharaoh was trying to do was to separate him from what he was carrying i'll give you a way out you go over here in worship i'll give you a way out we'll do this we'll do that no he said no there's something that i'm carrying and the message that i'm carrying is let my people go [Applause] well let's cut a deal let me say this too many people and i don't want to say you or who but too many people got deals with the devil yes sir you don't got to make a deal with the devil you don't have to sit there and judge yourself you got to look at one thing inside of you the holy ghost is the word of god in you the holy ghost is the promise it that identifies itself by accepting that word it identifies itself by accepting the word and if i could say this way then that spirit becomes the carrier it's what's packing it in you it's the spirit of god in you what allows you to carry that word and carry that promise not sympathize with it but carry it not watch somebody else that's packing it and then say oh i agree with that brother what you're saying is true i agree with that i agree with that but i'll tell you it doesn't come personal until you are personally packing it and the holy spirit in you is identifying that you believe it's the truth and you're an expectation and anticipation and you are looking for the day of its interpretation because you know that god is obligated to you to bring it past to you personally to you moses the same way you look at joshua he was told that that walls of that city would come down and that they would possess the city and they would possess the land you know you can imagine i i've been to jericho there and to the river and wherever they come to pass and they say this is where this great city set and there's this great big line of mountains there that mossad and those places sit on and jericho sat right down there and you can look down the valley of that a long ways god told joshua that's coming down i don't care how many generals came to him and i'll guarantee you there was probably a hundred plans offered i'm sure one general says come let's use the cartel plan let's dig a tunnel underneath the wall you know i'm sure some guys said we could slingshot some guys over that and you know okay you look it seems ridiculous to you because you know the story but how would you like to just been in the spot of just being the carrier how would you like to been the guy that walked up there and said god spoke to me and told me this wall is coming down yeah how you better delete that off of youtube i'm sure i'll have a protest going how that wasn't in the plan i don't know how when i don't know when alls i know is when we go around that seven times and we blow the trumpets that that's coming down now i like the movie version of it you know but i don't know how many days it took that to come down it may have just started a little tremor you know what i mean but i know one thing i know god gave them a season to repent and he gives us a season to repent thank you lord and that's why when god tugs at your heart move quick don't wait accept it right then take it right then and start packing it start carrying it believe it's true and sure enough that's right around they went around they march i imagine about the third time around that big old city there's plenty of mumblers and grumblers saying this is ridiculous why don't we just go around it you know we go around a lot of things and they come back to bite us later if god wants you to confront something confront it you pack the promise of your deliverance right up into the face of that thing no matter how many times it badgers you how many times it gets you to fall how many times it stumbles you you say i'm packing the promise of my deliverance and one day this promise is going to be fulfilled in me because there's a spirit in me that identifies that's the truth and i'm holding on to that promise not by my flesh but by the spirit that's in me hallelujah [Applause] my flesh has failed me identifies that god's obligated as long as i pack that promise as long as i'm a carrier and i carry that promise to the hour and the day of its deliverance then i can say this day this promise is fulfilled in me john the baptist we could go on and on sure but every single one of them was a promise that had to be fulfilled that's the evidence of whether you believe or not if you're still packing it yes amen why would anybody want to lay down such a glorious promises because it's not meant to be fulfilled in their life but that's that's what a time-tested memorial is have you ever noticed nowadays that i get upset at my computer if it doesn't snap the answer right back and years ago i would run upstairs to encyclopedia and then i would call this person up and i'd call somebody up tell me about this and take me hours to research something right but now if it's not instant it's gone i'll just try something else i i don't like communicating with people through technology i'm kind of the guy likes to look you in the eye whether you're lying to me or not that's just the way i am i mean anybody can write lies i i you know i i had a prince call me from arabia the other day and and he's got millions of dollars in a trust fund he wants to get me some of it i just want to look that prince in the eye you know i mean you know i'd rather drive to a place to see if they have something then go online and see if it's in stock so everything's quick everything's instant everything's got to the place you understand satan is trying to create a society that nobody wants to carry anything you got a burden and your heart's heavy there might be a reason for your heart being heavy there might be a purpose that that you feel this weight that you feel this thing but people just want to run to a doctor and get a pill here take this and you won't have to carry anything that's what satan's saying that's right that's right take modern society take modern gospel you know let's just let down our barriers let's let's let down our bars let's let down our dress code let's let down our music code let me tell you something there's way too much rock and roll coming into church and you young musicians not magicians but musicians you might be magicians and putting out spirits that you don't know about but musicians you kind of watch the influence of of all this playing and and songs and where you're picking up your inspiration you know i sit back and i hear a song and i'm sitting back there wow didn't you know my mind's going back to some group that i heard in the 60s that played that tune just because you had the name jesus to it doesn't make it spiritual and let me tell you something just because you like the tune don't make it good satan is the author of beautiful music so there's so many things i call those catches remember what a one-man denomination is it's anybody that hews out their own place of the spirit and that what we've got to understand what we're called to do we're called to be carriers of the word of god not fulfillers but bringing it to its place that it's carried now let's look at what's spoken of us i i'm talking about other churches and other musicians don't want anybody mad at me this brother makes this statement and he's talking about we're talking about carriers of the promise do you understand that brother branham was a carrier of the promise yes right before it came to pass and before it identified itself he carried it he carried it when that angel appeared to him he carried it when that burning bush the pillar of fire came down in the burning bush that's really what that was it became a burning bush because it was exactly a type of an exodus yes so he meant that burning bush as john don't defile yourself in any way i have a work for you to do do you understand the minute that was spoken to him and of him he became a carrier wasn't fulfilled but he became a carrier so he he was living his life knowing that collecting bottles on the ohio river to give sell to his dad for bootleg all this time and all of them would say to him you come on bill have a drink be a man right but he's a carrier so he reaches out to get the bottle right but there's a spirit in him that's identifying itself that that word is true and all of a sudden he he breaks down balls and he don't know why he's out on a date i think brother branham uses the word date i'd like to know who the preachers were that got out here and preached against dating i don't know it's a it's a message dogma is all it is i'll save that for those who want to come just like all these guys who preach galleries are the word of god you want to give a dalerie that's fine but just make sure she loves you enough if you don't have one [Applause] i mean i'm saying it's time we move on but so you know we're we're we're looking so he has this burning bush experience and then he goes out and he wants to he and he's out on a date and and he says they're my sweetheart said bill this is a cigarette try one what did he say yeah i like to try one what was happening he was caring and the spirit was bringing it to pass all he was was a carrier so there's look at where we've moved up to now but in this day there is to come a super royal seed of abraham amen is anybody carrying that promise are you a carrier of that he said there's to be a super royal seed of abraham i looked in the mirror i don't see no super royal seed of abraham i see a man that's battling the flesh battling in the mind but i'm still a carrier of that promise amen yes sir i don't have to bring it to pass royal seed of abraham that's exactly what it be that's exactly what it would be or if you want to say will be that's exactly what it be would be a royal bride to the roiled promised son now that's the promise of our age you understand we're not called to pack pentecost we're not called to pack another promise of another age that's right he he gave a promise to you and something in you identified that promise to be true now now we become packers of that promise we carry that with us there's to be a royal seed of abraham there's to be a super church there's to be this great signs and wonders that follow this church we pack that to its fulfillment we're carriers we're carriers of that promise that's what that's what our existence is built on no matter how he tries to take it from us that's what proves we're the real children of god as i spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride rise up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son she's to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is promised that's given to her when i believe now who gave the promise the lord jesus how did he deliver the promise through a god-inspired spirit-filled american deity filled messenger according to malachi 4 a scripture there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again there is to rise one on the scene in the power of elijah that will rise on the scene a wilderness man that come out and will have a message that will run straight back to the word again that's the hour that we're living in this is what we're carrying amen praise the lord you understand it's got to be carried first he's got he gets the promise out now i gave all these men in the bible i could have went into great detail on all these different men in the bible but i think that you understand they all receive the promise and they carried it for years [Music] they were they had to be a carrier a proven carrier until that god could trust them amen that's good to prove them that they're true how do you believe it look at mary a virgin shall conceive look which she was asked to pack i don't know the days and the time and the month that went by you know the bible doesn't fill in all the years that it takes but there is a lot of time from the time that that angel spoke to brother branham when he packed that water to when it come to pass there's a lot of time to the ohio river there's a lot of story in between but no matter what the story was what they were carrying was held in them by the spirit of god amen wasn't held in by your mind it's held in you by the spirit that identifies itself by saying that's the word and so we're carrying that we've been carrying that we had to be carriers first it's got to be carried to the time it's fulfillment joshua carried that as i was with moses i'll be with you he carried that all those things through all those battles to that river to where they overcome to the departing of the inheritance joshua and caleb carried their inheritance the places that they were gonna live they carried it through all the testing through all the trial carrying the promise is part of the birth you don't got no mental reason to believe that's right because god don't ask you to believe anything you can conceive mentally wouldn't be faith we're just become great carriers we're packers abraham was waiting day by day for almost an impossible thing to happen sarah 90 in him a hundred according to the promise of god he was still waiting in the midst of all the criticism he was still waiting for that son what was he doing he was waiting because he was carrying if you get rid of the burden you get rid of the load you don't have to worry where it's taking you don't give up you know this old saying we had in our my coach in football he and even when the guys weren't physically capable of doing the assignment you know i i i think i've weighed a 155 pounds something in high school and we had an all-pro tackle on our high school team went on to be all pro and the coach would put me out there to block this guy his name was pete m's and and he'd come running across that line and he'd clean my cloth and coach would pick me up off the ground and say you're not a loser until you quit trying so i got my clock cleaned all season long but i wasn't a loser don't let satan unpack you that's right so is the true believer still waiting for the promise son let me read it in my context so is the true believer still carrying the promise son to return notice just before the son arrived there was a sign given him is not the sign of the coming son to be revealed to the royal seed of abraham that's carrying the promise for the royal son as brother abraham says it is not the sign of the coming sun to be revealed to the royal seed of abraham that's waiting for the royal son the same as it was to father abraham for a natural son that's right jesus said so there is in saint luke 17 30 before this time come that the son of man would be revealed like he did in the days of sodom before the destruction of sodom we're looking for that sign now we've seen that sign you understand so when he's preaching this he's trying to point out to him that's why i'm not preaching this day this scripture is fulfilled because it has been fulfilled but in the fulfilling of it i'm going to read a statement that maybe you could help see what i'm trying to say in the fulfillment of that scripture and the fulfillment of that promise there is a promise that's given to the royal seed of abraham that they carry it till its fulfillment because everybody's that's ever been in the scripture had to carry the promise then we'll try to close with these few statements so abraham is carrying this promise of the son is that right for years then one day elohim walks into the camp he's been carrying the promise but now elohim has to come god in flesh really what he was he reached out there grabbed some ash cosmic ash blew himself a body something that abraham could see it sat there and he'd give abraham a sign so now this is what he said he said now he had never seen her he's talking about sarah behind him he said why did sarah your wife laugh abraham said she's in the he says where's abraham where's is your wife sarah abraham said she's in the tent behind you now he had never seen her how did he know that his name was abraham how did he know her name was sarah abraham where is your wife sarah she's in the tent behind you he said i personal program pronoun i am going to visit you according to the promise in other words i am going to visit what you are carrying so if you're carrying a promise if you're carrying a word he has a time of visitation for that word that's right our sister i i just think that's just beautiful it inspired me but she she had the headache and and and you know you don't i imagine sister mary by the time you got done diagnosing that you had a brain tumor you were in the early stages of alzheimer's you felt for sure you were suffering dementia you were losing it the word was delirious but she had a time of visitation and she had to pack carry that promise for a season until the time of visitation brother branham taught that over and over and over and over and over again don't quit [Music] you don't have to go get another promise just carry the one you've got he said i personal program i'm going to visit you according to the promise your wife is going to have that baby you've trusted me in other words you carried this promise all this time just think of it a little lamborghini you just carry it you believe it you hold on to it amen you got a call in your life to preach you got to call in your life you want to do do the work of the lord you want to know what happens you start carrying that you carry the burden too many people just run out and do something [Music] and they think that satisfies it and then it goes away because they made their own man-made nomination on how to bring it to pass listen to what he says you trusted me now me now i'm going to make it come to pass now i am going to make it come to pass you trusted me you carried the promise through all kinds of criticism through all kinds of doubt through all kinds of hardship now i have come and i am going to make it come to pass your part is just to carry it to the time of fulfillment and then you can say this day this promise is fulfilled in me every time i take a pill every time i have to deal with a problem in my flesh my deliverance is coming there may be no evidence on the outside but there's a spirit on the inside that's carrying that promise that's holding on to that promise it won't let anybody take it from me it won't even let me take it from me oh i remember the time that me and leslie we were done we had been hurt so deep and so bad we just we just given it up and i was i had made plans and had it all set up i was gonna move to police my dad had a big generator thing going i was gonna go down there i was gonna take it over and i was gonna retire and i got up from the church and i think i said i just think i'll retire you know i can't do it and big daniel memphis came to me and said brother david don't retire please don't retire you know and that struck something on the side of me i wanted to be done with it and you know a lot of it's because nobody understands but you know he understands and and so you can't even get away from it he'll bring it to pass i've come to bring it to pass now if i could say this to you this morning in in closing that royal seed of abraham and hear that royal seed of abraham which come because of that identification of that man sitting there with abraham come to prove it was the same god promised in this day as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when he reveals himself as son of man this day this scripture is to be fulfilled now you understand abraham carried that promise but that promise came to pass because of the man that was sitting there with him do you understand because that man came in that ministry that's what proved to abraham that the time of his visitation was near and that the promise was going to come to pass i don't know how long it was until he had the baby from that time but because that ministry and that man sat in front of him and gave him the promise it was because of who was sitting there that brought it to pass [Music] now we've seen he's who sat in front of us we've seen him turn his back to the audience we see him lay out the church ages he used charles larkin's historic but he placed every messenger he placed every spirit i never he filled in the blanks that's what he said he was to do was to fill in the blanks tie the loose ends and everybody gets all oh that was he took that loose end yeah that's what he took he took a loose end things that people said that were left out there left people hanging out there on the things he said had to take what they said run it back through the word tie the knot so you can move on else you'd be sitting in front of all kinds of half statements three-quarter truths truths misplaced trying to put the puzzle together [Music] did he quote other men sure because other men said things that need to be straightened up letter ram did not invent this message he did not make up this message he was a carrier he carried the message and when he carried the message he said you know i'm waiting for something you know i'm waiting for someone to come and make it happen you know i'm waiting for someone i carried the message father if i've done anything wrong if i said anything that's not true you forgive me but you told me i believed it i'm carrying it i'm standing here in washington d.c i believe richard nixon was at that meeting congress metro's that meeting many great politicians were thing at that meeting washington d.c and he said he's here he's here to bring to pass what i've been carrying the one that sat in front of abraham they made it happen is here to bring it to pass he's here and i say this when he said that in washington d.c it's still the washington dc today he said i take every spirit in this place in my control in the name of jesus christ and he still got the control of all the spirits that are coming out of there it's fulfilled abraham was a carrier and then he came to bring it pass and i could say this in closing the inspiration that struck me he says the same gospel the same power and the same son of man that was yesterday is today and will be forever the promise was given we've been carrying carrying it but the same son of man that sat in front of abraham and said i've come to carry it to pass is the same son of man that's here to bring to pass what you've been carrying the same son of man that was yesterday in washington dc in 1965 in 1940 back at the woman at the well back at abraham that same son of man is today and will be forever hebrews 13 8 do you believe it are you carrying that yes then i ask you i cannot be him but he is here we are only a carrier so we're going to forward there's a church that's being birthed and god's given us little signs of it testimonies things there's things that you've got to realize that if you've been carrying a promise if you've been carrying a burden we know because of what has happened in our generation that the time of our visitation is near he will come to carry and bring to pass what you've been carrying now if you're not carrying a promise read the book because we are partakers of divine nature by these great and precious promises we are partakers of divine nature i think that's first peter 3 i'm not sure 4. chapter 1 partakers of divine nature they carried what was spoken to them and of them what's spoken to you what was spoken of you if you're here this morning and you're even associated with the gospel at all you know that jesus christ preached a church that would be overcomers that would stop the satan at every one of his tricks that they'd be an invincible army that they'd be a shining light that they would be a bride a royal bride for the royal son that's what's spoken of them and what's been spoken to them i can only speak for me and i can only testify i'm not testifying of its fulfillment because i know there's still a lot to be fulfilled but i can testify that i'm carrying in me a promise of deliverance a promise of meeting a son a promise of a new city a promise of victory a promise to lay hands on the sick and they'll recover amen and i believe that can be fulfilled over and over again in our lives there's something inside of me that holds that promise and i'm going to carry that to its fulfillment do you believe that this morning i'll just ask brother billy to come and we'll worship a moment this morning and if anybody here would like to be prayed for maybe in your you've been have a burden or you have a desire but along with that burden you've got to attach a promise to that burden and you've got to carry that burden to its fulfillment noah had to do it moses had to do it john the baptist had to sit there and preach the coming of the lord there's one walking in your midst and one day here he come he said behold the lamb of god this day what i've preached and what i've carried has come to pass are you carrying something in your heart are you rebelling within yourself against yourself you know a lot of times people don't understand teenagers you know god starts dealing with the teenager when about 13 14 years old he starts convicting him and now the rebellion isn't because of rebellion against you as parents against you the rebellions against themselves and what god's dealing with them on the inside and it's against all the people and all the things everybody else is doing and and all the carrying on and and because they don't know that it's still going on with them they don't understand it that's why they form these little clicks and they do these little things together and you know they get not guess brother brown calls nickel pricks or something like that i don't know how he uses the word but it's because something's happening on the inside and you think that's going to go away you watch people that don't get converted and then all that rebellion they've had they sit behind a jail cell someday and they can't run from it anymore and then they have to come face to face and they'll find out it was there all the time you ever hear that zone he was there all the time amen he's there all the time if you're carrying it and you've been faithful in carrying it that same son of man is going to come by your house someday and he says i'm here [Music] i'm here to make it come to pass you you'll say lord i tried to make it come to pass no all i wanted you to do is carry it all i wanted you to trust me no matter how long it took how long you wanted the holy ghost [Music] how long you're discouraged at yourself that you failed over and over again and you kept getting up [Music] but just something in you just said i i just still carry this burden [Music] one day the same man that sat in front of abraham will sit in front of you because he's the same yesterday today and forever and we just carried it and he'll say i'm here to bring it to pass let's just stand in the moment let's go ahead and start singing [Music] places thirsting for your life if i wonder far away from here [Music] my thirsty soul come and fall afresh on me fill my cup again kill my heart and [Music] eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my

care upon him for he careth for you [Music] maybe today is your hour of deliverance are you ashamed to associate that he's the only one that can help you lord i've tried and i've tried and i've tried i can't come up any higher i can't do any better it's not in me but it is in your promise it is in your word higher ground is in your word for me and i'm going to hold on to that i'm going to carry that promise till you come and bring it to pass and when i fail i'm gonna cry i'm gonna be full of anguish and sorrow and pain but lord i'm never gonna let go never going to let go of that promise i'm going to carry it lord if the rapture is my deliverance i don't care but i know you're the only one you're the only one that can heal me i'll do all i can do with every medicine every shot every pill

have to wait as long as if noah have to wait as long as moses 40 years packing it in the wilderness kelly stood in front of pharaoh and said this day this promise that i've been carrying for all these years is fulfilled don't put the blood on the post for the death angels gonna pass tonight and i'm putting the blood of the calvary father on my doorpost of my heart knowing that that death angel's gonna come and kill that devil let me hold on let me do my duty my parts to carry your parts to bring the path may i understand that my heart may i never let go of anything that you've ever said anything you've ever told me spoke to me or of me may i carry that till the hour of its fulfillment we ask it in jesus name amen if you want to be dismissed you can be dismissed at any time and then we'll have baptism after let's just worship the lord his presence is here you can reach out as he walks through the aisles this morning and touch the hem of his garment [Music] and virtue will leave

this morning to rescue hannah amen the lord's moved on her heart to give her heart to the lord step in position for the promise of the holy ghost that will lead her and guide her into all peace and comfort so wonderful today that have the alexanders with us and witnessing the baptism of this young sister in her heart and we're happy that the lord's moving this is the tender age that the holy spirit begins to move and if you give your heart to the lord early it saves you and god a lot of trouble hallelujah but believe me he will get you if you are his that's right he'll go to the farthest place you can run you'll go to the deepest depth you can dig to you can't avoid the mighty handle and i say thank you jesus amen let us read in the scriptures therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus ye have crucified both lord and christ and when when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do therefore peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as our lord our god shall call with many other words did they testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up towards generation amen you know what's up it's a humbling thing to be baptized it's something that when you get older it's harder and it's hard you have a tendency to resist but i'll tell you for every promised word the blessings that follow are worth all the birth pains and all the trouble and so i know that hannah put a lot of prayer into this she put a lot of thought in this she pondered it for a long time until she couldn't wait any longer and so we're here today to fulfill her heart's desire to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ sister hannah jesus spoke to his disciples and commissioned them to go into all the world and baptize them in one name the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and peter with the keys to the kingdom and a divine revelation of what that name was he baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and today hannah we fulfill the word of god and we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ oh standing on the promises of god my king through eternal age just let his praises free full and glory in the highest i will see standing on the [Music] the promises of god my savior standing [Music] standings are standing on [Music] standing on the promises of god [Applause] [Music] standing on the promises [Music] standing [Music] where christ makes free standing on the promises [Music] [Applause] [Music]

promises of god [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
