Description:
An Opportunity Of Manifestation
Br. Andrew Bohannon
Wednesday Evening Service: March 24,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

what you expected amen praise the lord i want to invite you thank you musicians i certainly appreciate all the musicians those that are in the sound booth everybody that has a part we certainly appreciate them and trust the lord will be their portion if you have your bibles i want to invite you to turn in the scripture to mark chapter 10. we're going to be reading familiar passage of scripture verse 13. it's an encounter with our lord and and the rich young ruler and just we had a brother's breakfast and you know i just thank god for spiritual food in due season amen what would we be if we didn't have a guide i mean what would he be we would have no vision if we didn't have something that's been presented us that we can walk into amen scripture says there in mark chapter 10 verse 13 it says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and he said unto them suffer the little ones to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took up he took them up in his arms and he put his hands upon them and blessed them and when he was gone forth into the way he came and there came one running and kneeled down and asked him good master what shall i do that i might inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why calleth thou me good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou's lack is go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt has treasures in heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me and he was sad at the same and went away greek for he had great possessions amen you may have your seed we trust the lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word we'll also be reading scripture found in genesis chapter 1 and verse 11. and god said let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and also if we'll skip over to verse 28 of chapter 1 in genesis it says and god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen you know i just something that stirred up in my heart i've been considering how the lord's been dealing with me and the messages that's been preached and how you know god's becoming so real and so personal it's it's uh you know this is not a church affair this is an individual affair with jesus christ god's dealing with hearts because he has a reason for doing that he has he has a purpose and an intention of an expression of your life in my life and i think about the story that's spoken of here you know the scripture says that it was given the scriptures are given for our admonition for correction and is also given for vision something that we can walk into and i think about the uh the the question that nicodemus had you know he had kept all the the ten commandments and yet he was presented with an opportunity and i think about you know you can look in the scriptures and you can look at his life and you can just you know cast it aside and say yeah that was for him yeah i don't have the riches that he has but i want us to somehow be able to identify with him in the opportunity so so something that just was bubbling on my heart is you know when we're presented with opportunity what is our attitude attitude attitudes towards the opportunity amen you know sometimes in life you'll be going along and you might face an opportunity that would be your last and we think about what nicodemus was presented with he was presented with an opportunity where something he was longing for something that he desired because his church experience wasn't satisfying enough he said good master there was something about him that was something that he wanted because yet he lacked it and so you see in their exchange you know there was something that withheld him from accepting his opportunity and and what was it what was the question i thought it was a great question what must i do to inherit eternal life the question is is about eternal life amen and now think about him he's coming what must i do you see he's expressing human nature and a religious human nature so so man's way is always to try to make a way for himself not understanding that god has a provided way he said what must i do to inherit eternal life and yet the very thing that was keeping him from his opportunity at eternal life he went away grieved because he had much possession we might not have riches but we might have other things that are trying to hinder us from expressing eternal life amen just as i was considering the the message leadership and and fellowshipping in the brothers breakfast you know i don't i don't do pitchfork gospel i said god what what is it in me that's keeping eternal life from being expressed in me amen ponder that there's things that are presented in our lives situations you know and and we have a a a seven course meal god has stored up spiritual food see nicodemus he had it right in one way because jesus christ today he's on the outside of the church trying to gain entrance back into the church he says i'm standing at the door knocking see that very knock is your opportunity what is the situation that you need eternal life in tonight what what is the situation well i need a revelation of my healing i need a revelation that jehovah jireh is still my provider amen what is your need that's the opportunity we want to grasp that's the very thing that we're longing for we're saying god i need this eternal life to be manifested in my life amen something that that was ringing in my heart and you know i just think about you know we are in a time we've come to a precious time where all the mysteries of god has been revealed amen we have at our disposal we have access to the very thoughts of god to know his will and how to perform it but dying is hard nicodemus he showed he couldn't do it he was holding to something that he couldn't let go of i think about the prophet saying a statement and it just i'll read it to you and this was spoken uh the spoken word is the original seed now he said if you can't you now if you can't explain it leave it alone but just say it so because god said so see that's it god said it now notice now it will not mix you must not tamper with it god will punish the one that does it and it will not hybrid to nothing else it's god's word alone god don't need the need your word and his we're supposed to speak his own word we're supposed to preach his word god's word now therefore true life can only come or reproduce itself by its original breeding see life now study that now i want you to study that on tapes now study it now life l-i-f-e can only come can only reproduce by its original breeding amen so we know we have the seed of god in us we know that the washing of the water by the word will water the seed so so if we have within our ability to go in and water the seed by feeding on the word amen and laying in the presence of the sun we can get all the mechanics right but we got to wait on the dynamics but in waiting we also want to know he said the way it started at the beginning then it reproduced itself see it doesn't it's it's a hybrid it runs out some of them run out the first generation it's gone right then it'll soon find itself back it can't bring correct life it's hybrid now he said let's coast let's try to hold now such a text i could preach he says i'm trying to now i'm trying to keep from doing it so he's trying to keep from preaching on it but he's talking about how that it's easy to try to mix the word of god with your own thinking it's so easy but he says now now he said like eve now thinking about the opportunity that's presented itself today he says now eve was presented or she brought forth a hybrid crop that wasn't god's purpose just have a hold back he says now talking about the hybrid crop he said that's a dead crop so it can't rebreed itself it won't rebreed itself because god said so he said now let every seed bring forth of its own kind you won't you're you've mixed it and then you can see the church right there and where they're going to wind up it's dead for it cannot bring forth of its kind why they mixed you can't do it nothing with it it's dead it's finished and that's why every generation has its own revival a chance at the word amen you know that's that's the answer that's the source of my inspiration you know if if you have a restored word now you have an opportunity presented to you because you have the seed of god in you the seed of god was put in you not to say look at me i have eternal life but it's to reproduce of its own kind amen it's it's the very same life of jesus christ this this gospel is not just to come and show up at church and show our good clothes and put our best foot forward but this gospel is a gospel that's rugged that's that's down home cooking it kicks out the trash you know it puts the tv out when the prophet says it's time to put the tv out when it says you can't walk that walk with those high heels it kicks those shoes out and cans them all those attitudes and such i accept it that's my inheritance the seed that's in me is is calling out for that kind of expression there's nothing else in the world that will satisfy the hunger that's in that seed that's why each generation has its own revival a chance at the word think of it your opportunity your chance at the word to declare eternal life think about the life of christ you can look back and see what he's done and look forward to what he will do and you can see what he's doing right now he's cleaning out your life he's i mean he's putting a boot to all that trash and you're saying i'm willing lord you see nicodemus said what must i do you see and now when he knocks see i love the the testimony and i was thinking about it this week how that you know there was a great painting of of the door that jesus was knocking on and they had criticized him and said well you know the the door is missing the latch and he said well that was on purpose because the latch is on the inside god put a man on freemore agency he's a perfect gentleman he's not going to go across your will but there's a people that have the same seed that's going to allow god to fulfill his word as it was spoken let it be amen there is a virgin womb that that seed is coming forth and gonna reproduce itself amen this gospel is being declared in human flesh now thinking about accepting our opportunity we want to accept our own opportunity to manifest that incorruptible seed i love how brother billy brought out how that there's a there's a natural kingdom and a heavenly kingdom and we're living within these two realms we have the opportunity to express natural carnal worldly expressions you have that opportunity and and many of those things are lawful but yet there's a people that's saying there's something in my heart that's calling for the expediency of christ this kind of leadership that leads me and guides me into all truth and righteousness i don't want just a little bit i want it all you have your opportunity at a revival your own revival your chance at the word i think about the testimonies how god is moving i mean i can go through them all but you see when that opportunity had presented itself i had been hearing for a long time that god is the same and i've heard testimonies in the church and on tape and i've heard that god is the same and and matter of fact i'm a part of that you know what and and i got a need and we've heard sisters stand here and testify in that moment it produced amen when faith to receive what's yours drops in your heart grab it don't wait another moment that's your possession the moment it's revealed to you this is my daughter i claim her for the glory of god you got a lost loved one you got somebody you've been praying for a sick mom you need a job this is our opportunity amen we want to accept the opportunity to watch our faith shine out praise the lord amen the seed is given for reproduction the seed is a word the word is a seed that a sower sowed and now we've come to a place where that seed word is taking on skin amen says now remember correctly that's why each generation has his chance his own revival gets a chance at the word then they hybrid instead of taking it and that's the way they do now brother brown says this he says my mission that i believe that god has called me for now i have to say some personal things today because that's what i told you i would do is to tell the world my mission i believe in the earth is to forerun that coming word see the coming word which is christ amen now that seed word see it wasn't until the restoration came that we can manifest what was in the in the seed amen because the the word that was there was hybrid god has to restore the altar and bring back the the seals to let us see the trail of the serpent to see all the deception and the hybriding of the word and now when the revival comes amen you know we're going through some hard tests we're going through some hard trials there's some things that we're going through that you know you figure how's this body be being kept well the word of god says that there is an inherent inheritance kept by the power of god amen that's your revival there's an inheritance that is kept by god and it's reserved for you in heaven well i just think about if if i was making reservations you know for for a trip or for a meal boy i would start preparing to receive some benefits from that reservation amen we have the opportunity to claim everything that eternal life provides oh what an opportunity what an opportunity what a privileged people we are and to think that god sent his word he vindicated it by i mean this is just so plain and now what are we looking for well we're looking for god to fulfill his word you know whenever god fulfills his word it brings the glory and presence of god amen you're a people that are privileged to live and walk where the glory and presence of god goes thank god he said he sent his mercies new every morning amen you know you can look back at yesterday and that old devil tried to drum up a song that tries to bring you down but i got another opportunity praise god his mercies are new every morning praise the lord scripture says in first peter chapter 2 he says but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him that have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past you were not a people but now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have attained mercy praise god you know i'm not what i used to be i'm not what i want to be but i'm definitely not where i want to be and and you know it's it's one of those things that if i have god's grace and mercy and i'm in his hands he'll finish his work amen you know what is the revival given for now we know we're promised that god's going to send his revival amen now you know the revival is to to clear out the trash you know and and i'll just say it plainly and i'll just testify many times you know the revival is to give you victory over your fleshly carnal lust i mean god's given you victory over this bag of bones you see because you're more than that house you're a living soul you're a seed germ seed of god there's got to be a character building that comes with with the power of god you wouldn't just give a child a shotgun or a straight razor or give them the keys to the car and say hey just take off see what happens no sir there's some child training coming we've been in this battle for a while we've learned that we try to go out and perform the word of god we'll fall flat on our face but that's a good place to be because then we can call upon the lord and rise back up and say your mercy is new every morning i'm not gonna be held down by my bad mistakes i'm not gonna be held down by my wrong choices i'm being lifted up into heavenly places because he said that there would be a revival that would revive me that i would wake up and rise like christ amen yeah i was thinking this personal testimony is you know back in 2008 you know seeing the light of the day and god being so kind and merciful and he touched my body healed me of a spinal disease that they said it was permanent and god he touched me my body i had never felt it touched like that before since the time that i had been broken and yet when that touch came i began to understand that i was going to need to accept eternal life like i had never accepted before because well that said in me something that touched a deep a hunger a craving to see more of the supernatural and so as we went out we went to mexico we had some special meetings brother david brother junior preached and it was powerful man i was hearing i had been feeding on the word of god hearing testimony that god's the same god he raises the dead he heals the sick he opens blind eyes he saves the lost oh my i was going through a revival amen and then i come home and whoo i was sick the day before we left and the travel was tough and well you know this to my shame but this is just where we're at we were a people like the scripture says he called you out of darkness into his marvelous light and i had been hearing and faith cometh by hearing and i had been hearing about a living god one that sets the captive free and i already experienced him in salvation i experienced him healing but yet god now he said he was gonna revive me and so i'm sitting there and i'm catching up on my cowboy game i had a dvr and i was sitting there and you know what i get a knock at the door henny grab the door got something important going on ain't got time we're just being honest folks the door came my wife said hey they need to talk to you and i realize at that moment something was very wrong but god all of a sudden a situation a circumstance god had a seed that was requiring a revival god had a seed that had to come to a manifestation and expression so god he performed his word that boy he made a bad choice he ended up hanging himself but i had heard while we were in mexico some brothers laid hands on somebody that had died and that person when they died was 10 years old now 17. and my eyes were beholding fulfillment i had heard on the tape and something happened in my heart when i seen i said that girl right there was raised from the dead by prayer praise god praise god i had only heard by the hearing but now i see there was something in my heart that accepted the opportunity even though i didn't know it was going to present itself within a few days even in my darkness you might have some darkness you're experiencing today you might have some things that you know trying to hold you back from accepting what god has for a faith to become what you've been called to there is something longing inside you've searched you've tried nothing has been able to quench that hunger yet i went out there offered a word of prayer and god came on the scene for a young man and that boy he lived and i seen the hand of god in such a way that something in me said enough with this foolishness i kicked the tv out amen god sending a revival because he's faithful to perform his good word amen you can think about your life and circumstances and situations you're dealing with it's an opportunity for god to come on the scene and for faith to rise up and claim your god-given right amen you will come here to express a son and daughter of god the same way that he did took god at his word declared the truth and watched the spirit of god come down amen and it become righteousness it become his life living out in a yielded vessel amen amen in that wonderful a little further down in in first peter in chapter 2 and 12 it says having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you evildoers they may be that they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation amen you know there's people that you know we received our visitation we it's been made known to us the full manifestation of malachi 4. we've seen the hand of god now there's going to be people that they like the scripture says they may behold your good works and then they'll shall behold and glorify god in the day of their visitation what an opportunity to pack the presence of god i'm encouraging you i want faith to rise what i'm speaking to you i've experienced and i want it more and you know what rejoices my heart is that god do it for you and i know he has i've seen it i've seen mothers burdened for their children i've seen brothers burdened for their moms and you know what they packed that burden as an opportunity to see the hand of god fulfill his good word amen hold to the promise it's a seed it'll bring forth in its time everybody feeling okay praise the lord you know we just think about so many things that we could testify of but you know over in romans chapter 2 there is a an account you know when you receive christ and you receive calvary and you receive what was done on that day something in the heart begins to think differently something begins to act differently your judgments change before the moment someone crossed you you would be oh i can't i can't stand a second without a retaliation but when you know where you come from and you know where you're going boy it just makes it a little bit easier to keep your mouth sealed and keep your fist in your pocket so it's that very life of christ now becoming that restrainer and we want more of that in romans it says now we'll just skip right there in between um it says despise thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering knowing not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance you know i i that that has just become such a reality you know i wasn't seeking god you think about the different places where you stumble twisted your ankle yeah you should have been doing other things and the lord give you opportunity to say you know what that's not the call of a son or daughter of god and in his mercy then the next day oh you know what that ankle doesn't feel so bad you know and you think about you know it's it's opportunity like i was saying i was sitting there doing the dvr thing but it was the goodness of god he didn't come and condemn me god's not condemning you for the condition you're at he's calling you up higher saying i have some things for you and that's why i want you to come despise thou the riches of his goodness forbearance and long-suffering you see when you've experienced his forbearance when you received and experienced his long-suffering and his goodness now you become a partaker of it it's also now that's christ in you doing it for those who did the same thing like you did to god and people need to see an expression of faith they need to see the life that is in you germinated and lived out that's what causes the attraction is this very end time message manifest in human beings it's the very gospel being preached amen it's foolishness to the world oh you don't wear makeup uh why don't you go out to the parties why aren't you coming to us with the to the football game well i got a different appetite god changed me amen he's declared his goodness to me and i want to share something with you god is a merciful god he's long suffering he's forbearing and his his goodness led my heart to repentance you see while i was yet a sinner he died for me let me tell you about a love that knows no bound amen and he's dwelling in you to perform his good word towards those that you love amen like the brother said let me be the clay on his will that he might perform his manifest his goodness you know i was fellowshipping you know with the brother and it just struck my heart you know opportunities of fulfillment opportunities of manifestation of god's word you know i think about the situation that brother branham found himself in and there's a message called the path of life and you know this brother he was um criticizing brother branham you know about divine healing and things and and saying that about the witch doctor or this you know performing a certain something and and uh you know he just he just he just he allowed the criticism i i just maybe i'll share it with you in some of the details but brother brahms said that the the a man that had been preaching 20 something years and he he wrote he wrote him this 22 page letter you know criticizing him about all this and that and the other and and brother branham's approach to him you know this this is what i want to anchor down is is how that brother branham's approach brought a preservative it brought a life that attracted this person and his spear of influence this man had criticized him and brother branham even said brother dear i sure appreciate the many years that you spent on all of this i appreciated a servant of christ i do appreciate the criticism now the man that can't take criticism there's something wrong with his experience pretty good because god sends criticism to correct us it makes us see our bad points i've been helped so much by criticism that's friendly criticism not getting nasty or angry just friendly criticism so i appreciate that sir i appreciate it and when he said there's just one thing that i i would like to express here as we're speaking of my grammar of course i'm not an educated and he said that's true but i said the thing what surprises me that a dean of a lutheran college would base his theology upon an experience instead of the word of god when you talk about the witch that could heal i said jesus said if satan can cast out satan then his kingdom is divided he cannot heal now you can jesus said that he he can't heal and said he says let every man's word be a lie and mind be true amen and jesus said now that just surprises me that a dean of a lutheran college was based his theology upon an experience and an emotion instead of god's word amen so i i just think about brother branham's approach and even the very things that that hindered people will come in contact with they would accept an experience or an emotion when eternal life your eternal life presented to this world and this man was presented with eternal life and right now there was something that he had based his destination on something that was going to lead him to a godless hell and yet there was a preservative there was a life on display he said now he was just pointing back to the word satan cast out satan he said let every man's word be a lion mind be true he said a dean or someone else any minister should base his theology upon the word of god and i said i'm certain i know you called me a soothsayer i said i presumed it was the discernment and i said did you know that the pharisees and sadducees made their remark themselves when they seen the same thing done by our lord they called him beelzebub now perhaps what if i'm right and jesus said when the holy ghost comes to do the same and speak against it we'll never be forgiven in this world or the world to come no matter how many 50 years of preaching a word against the holy spirit he said and i said i forgive you for that i will and i know god will for he sees that you didn't understand it and i wrote him the nicest letter i could and later i got an invitation to come to him amen i just love the savor of the life of christ it just sets in me an appetite for more of god there's just a deep hunger for this yes i want to manifest this and it's been promised you praise god you're promised a chance at the word glory amen you see it just happened to be there the devil had put it there at the wrong time you know when the people are really starting to rejoice and they got he got an opinion and went out see and he said i apologize for the letter that i wrote you said i built myself up with such a place that i was against it and i was pinned down in it right there and said i wasn't but a soothsayer he said i ask you to forgive me he said why certainly sir i never holded nothing i never did what i told you in the letter he said i wanted to hear it from your lips this man had seen a representation of the seed life and he said i wanted to hear it from your lips there was something in this man that was calling for fulfillment there's another scripture that says whatever you bind on earth will be bound whatever you loose on earth will be loosed is what you have forgiven it is forgiven he said now i wanted to hear it from your lips he said now brother branham to me and all the students we're hungering for the holy ghost what must we do he said so you know what i told him he said don't you he said now turn your backs your backs this way and your faces to the wall all around and make a purpose in your heart that you'll never leave your knees until you god give you the baptism of the holy ghost and i said now don't think about this or that or the other just stay there and say god i want the holy ghost and he went around and laid hands on them and 40 received the holy ghost right there and now there's about 500 of them strong going on signs and miracles and wonders and so forth brother brethren i believe that we have the thing that the world must have but we've got to approach it in the right way amen you have the ability within the seed to approach it the right way we have to accept this divine leadership this unction from above this wisdom this understanding it's available i'm accepting my opportunity think about that approach you know testifying witnessing it's out of the same message brother brown said if you approached a carpenter and you had some kind of new mechanism and the the carpenter's over there framing and slugging on his hammer or his thumb and ah and here you come you know you you got you got the advancement you've been advanced somehow in understanding and you have this thing and it you put a tag of nails in it and and you just look back at him he doesn't have nothing in it no i offended my brother no but there's an approach there's a provided way the life of christ reviving you let's get the trash out first praise the lord i don't know where i'm at in time um you know another experience where the opportunity was presented amen and i believe that we can live so close to god that god can warn us of a test that's coming where an enemy would try to lay a snare through a neighbor or through a co-worker but through meekness and humility receive a word from the lord and walk quietly and meek me before our brother even to be suffered to be defrauded because god will avenge his elect there there is a message called the reproach for the cause of the word brother branham said this he said in verse 7 he said god has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill his words god knows just exactly what he is doing we don't we just have to receive it as he gives it to us but he knows that there's nothing going to go wrong with what he has planned to do it's all has to come about and that has to be sometimes rugged hard things only bring out the real and true nature of an object so as we're facing challenges the the different tests that will come we know that it'll it's gonna bring out the real living christ it's an opportunity for the real living christ to be declared in your flesh now brother brown's saying in paragraph 81 he says god sets a time and has a purpose for everything there's nothing that happens accidentally to those who love the lord and are called according to his calling we are predestinated and everything works just right that's it because he cannot lie he said that it was that everything has its time its season it has its way and god is behind every move and sometimes you think everything's going wrong it's up to us those things are put on us trials and wonderings it's testings to see how we'll react on an action amen brother branham talks about um going into a when he went up to hurricane mountain in the time where the storm came and brother branham talks about how that god had said something and he said go go to the side to yourself and he said now get to yourself move out in the bushes a little while there's a trap set for you be careful but he didn't tell me how and what okay now he he ended up he said i went to the church that night in the auditorium and announced it to the people and the next day the next night it happened and there i was standing there when he told me upon some markers he said it's in your hands do with them whatever you say it'll happen now now god is giving us example how many times have we been given opportunities to accept the life that god is declaring and something else had attracted us and we missed the opportunity but god has a promise he's going to revive us to another opportunity if there's something in your heart that's wanting to express this word there's some opportunity that's going to present itself to manifest yes he says it's in your hands do with them whatever you say will happen right now there you are where there was somebody irreverent ungodly in making fun of and scoffing at the meeting a young man and a young woman and he was trying to make vulgar love with her in the building and everybody's attention while i was trying to preach he pulled her head back and climb up on her lap and throw her head back and try to kiss her and going on like that in a meeting drawing attention and the holy spirit says now they are in your hands what will you do with them well i tell you we're letting this old shell of a man lead wow better put the the burn button away i mean we need the very love of christ you know it's it's you know it's you know our faith is based on forgiveness you know god forgave us while we were out groping in darkness and sometimes our old flesh just wants to be quick oh oh did i forget where i come from did i did i am i absentee on the grace of god my my it's in your hands you have an opportunity to let the seed of god that's in you manifest he said now it's in your hands what will you do with them and there was a holy hush everybody said deathly quiet and i thought oh god what must i do then i remembered if he hadn't have warned of the holy spirit two days before he said i forgive you now that's what he wanted me to say he says because after all i had been guilty not only of that not maybe not of that but guilty of the least is guilty of the whole i i need this kind of faith i need this kind of revelation anchored in my heart i don't want to just have a religious experiment experience where i'm associated with the message and i got all this truth and doctrine and things like that but i wanted to be a living christ taking over me taking over my mind my heart my body i can long suffer i can forebear wrong we had a sheave wave tell us all about it not just tell us but these are examples just a few boys sets a heartbeat in me i mean i'm expecting now a revival to revive me to a situation i'm going to be facing opportunities you might have them just as you leave here but now i'm going to be looking for opportunities of manifestation the seed life that is within me can be even accused of wrong well if i did it's okay i deserve it but if it's for the gospel the life of christ the glory of god manifested praise god praise god guilty of the least guilty of the whole so i said i forgive you and there are witnesses sitting here now there was then and and then the holy spirit fell oh i love that part another fulfillment praise the lord i mean this is just wonderful now you see i believe that's all that these these things had a meaning what would you do with a power how would you see the reaction to an action sometimes some things that is come as an act then how do you react to that action do you understand what i mean what would you do what would you do and maybe all this has worked up to where i'm at now brother bannon would go on to preach about the reproach you know i think that's what we're coming to is to be able to stand in the face in the hall of critics and be accused of all manner of things and do like he did when they plucked his beard out when they mocked him spit in his face but yet there was a meat that he lived off of and that was to do the will of god amen i believe that same hunger is in the seed waiting for manifestation a hunger to do thy will that's the very thing that'll satisfy my soul the lord it's a matter of god's provided way and accepting it and then our approach to god and our approach to our brother amen we just want to be sensitive now brother brown says this in 94 he says you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to christ must first be tried child trained the purpose that god has ordained you for and remember you can just keep quiet you could just keep quiet remember if he's called you to this there is nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what god's word will be made manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place amen you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place right god's word will triumph it cannot fail there there is where every christian ought to stand knowing that that the trials will come seem every way to you but remember god has a purpose and it'll all work out right amen now let's just call back a few of the events god's word had been fulfilled in other ages and he goes on to speak about noah and and the different ones and you know you you might be facing different things that you know you're desiring to see god fulfill his word in you well just know god promised you a revival and that seed was given to reproduce after his own kind you've seen the life displayed now take god at his word feed the seed bask in the glory and presence of god when you have a need and you come to a place where you've done all that you can do you've prayed you read your bible you've testified you've held to the promise when all you can do is stand you stand wait for god to manifest the promise because in that moment of waiting that unction from above that pulsation of faith when it grabs you and it quickens grab it amen that spur of the moment when it's been revealed to you that's your opportunity for manifestation god bless you let's stand i'd like to invite the musicians you know you just think about in this time in this age where the church has put out christ from out of the the church and he's knocking he said now if any man hear my voice now he's speaking to individuals we're not going to get there as a group we're going to get there as individuals we're going to have opportunities that present themselves as individuals and it's opportunities that that seed life that you can sup with him he said now if i'm knocking any man open i will come into him and i will sup with him and he with me the very cry of the heart is i don't only want to experience his presence but i want his experi his presence to be experienced by others amen that is the longing of the seed is to declare eternal life and eternal life is perfectly living for others if there's something that's holding you back tonight if there's something that comes to mind or in your heart like nicodemus he realized he couldn't give it up he went a great grieved but i believe tonight there will be something in your heart that you can go rejoicing because you've accepted your opportunity amen why don't we bow our hearts pray together precious lord jesus lord you're so good to us lord your kindness your longsuffering your meekness father it overwhelms us lord and how that you're so wonderful to come and declare your truth and to give us these exceedingly great and precious promises lord that we can be partakers of your very

amen i certainly enjoy the word tonight amen i believe every day every moment of our life is an opportunity man for that supernatural to be manifested amen for for the word he said every every generation has to change to that revival for that word to come into play you know and i was thinking as our brother was preaching you know every time we we think about the even the manifestations of sons and and things like that our mind oftentimes jumps to even though the the the manifestation of the third pole and things like that what would it help for someone to create scroll into existence but to lack the love of god for one another what would it help for you to stop the storm and not have compassion for one another or to manifest the kindness and the fruits of the spirit like alberta said i believe we live in such a time where when we get these things done then god will expand our field he wants us to be a good and he wants us to be good stewardship in the little things and to pay attention and to to wait for that opportunity to open up for us to move into it amen let's just borrow heads tonight our gracious father we love the word tonight lord father i desire as true believers is always to to have our ears and our minds and our heart open and lord for the opportunity you would give us to speak a good word and father to to walk in that word that you've laid before us though then and father we we desire and we have need for that manifestation lord that we can come to a place where father when you speak we act lord and when you give instruction we move into it lord father i know the enemy tries to distract us every moment of the day our mind is full father oftentimes even you speak and we don't even hear what you have to say i pray tonight father you give us understanding lord and father you move us to a place where we can have that understanding that place where we can hear to to learn to hear your voice and to understand what it says lord lead us and
