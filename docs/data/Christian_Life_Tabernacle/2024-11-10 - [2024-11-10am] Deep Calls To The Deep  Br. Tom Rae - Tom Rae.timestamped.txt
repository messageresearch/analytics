[20:38] this morning as you invite our pastor
[20:40] this morning
[20:52] amen God bless you this morning you may
[20:55] be seated
[21:03] it's uh certainly wonderful to be in the
[21:06] house of the Lord this morning and and
[21:09] to uh come together
[21:13] and uh fellowship and it's probably
[21:17] never that you have a dedication that
[21:21] you don't go back in your mind to when
[21:24] the Great temple was dedicated and when
[21:28] the ark was traveling from tent to tent
[21:32] in place to place and David put it on
[21:36] his heart to build a
[21:38] building and U but he was a a a man of
[21:42] war and so God promised that he would
[21:46] have his son build
[21:48] it and in the building of that Temple it
[21:54] was very
[21:56] unique because they had a pattern to
[21:59] build it after they had a blueprint that
[22:02] was given uh to them to build but when
[22:07] they looked around their country and
[22:10] they looked around at
[22:13] uh uh the the the area that they were at
[22:17] there in Jerusalem where they were going
[22:20] to build this Great temple they found
[22:23] out that all the products and all the
[22:26] things necessary to build that Temple
[22:30] they didn't have and they had to go
[22:33] outside of their land to find the trees
[22:38] and the stones and the and and the uh
[22:42] skins and everything that they needed
[22:46] they had to go out and look for them and
[22:48] they came from many different places in
[22:51] many different lands there were many
[22:53] different products and many different uh
[22:57] items that came and I thought that
[23:00] reminds me so much of the temple that
[23:03] God's Building now we come from the East
[23:06] and West we come from the lands ofar we
[23:10] come from different countries and
[23:13] different languages we come from
[23:16] different skin colors different skin
[23:18] tones we have some with hair some with
[23:21] no hair and and he's reached out and
[23:24] he's taken all the parts from everything
[23:29] that he had that he might
[23:32] build a a
[23:35] temple and no part in that Temple could
[23:41] work without the part next to
[23:44] it no part stood
[23:47] alone uh by itself it became a part of
[23:52] the
[23:52] whole and the glory was shared from the
[23:56] hidden
[23:57] nail to to the ark that sat in the place
[24:02] that was prepared for it every item
[24:05] every portion of it added and gave to
[24:10] the glory of it and if you removed any
[24:14] part of it you would remove that portion
[24:18] of glory and then the glory of the
[24:23] whole wouldn't be there it would still
[24:26] be beautiful it would still be glorious
[24:29] but it wouldn't be as glorious if it had
[24:33] that peace added to it and you're the
[24:36] pieces that God has chose to build the
[24:40] ark that God is building in this day and
[24:45] my prayer is that each of you this
[24:48] morning would come to the
[24:51] realization of your importance to the
[24:55] body and that God is placed with within
[25:00] you something that all of us need and no
[25:05] we don't have any big guys or little you
[25:09] and it took all of you to make this
[25:11] meeting we thank all of our deacons that
[25:15] have labored our trustee board all of
[25:18] you that gave and gave gifts to the
[25:21] church and out out of your want and need
[25:25] you still gave offerings that we might
[25:29] have a place to come out of the rain and
[25:32] lift our hands and Worship the Lord it
[25:36] it takes uh a lot of work you know I I I
[25:41] thank all the people that put the lunch
[25:44] on for you and and you know they cleaned
[25:48] up and mopped the floors and swept and
[25:51] set up tables and all those things but
[25:54] you share in that Glory you share in
[25:57] that labor when you turn your heart to
[26:00] the Lord and you worship him and it
[26:03] becomes all of us together and we've all
[26:07] been called by a special
[26:11] voice we heard a
[26:13] scream we heard a cry and something in
[26:17] US was stirred and we knew that this was
[26:20] the voice of
[26:22] God this is a fulfillment of Malachi 4:5
[26:26] Luke 17:30
[26:28] Revelations 10:7 we saw that there was a
[26:31] calling out and a sweeping and a
[26:35] separation and a building of a temple
[26:39] and the building of a a body and it was
[26:43] calling from every land every country
[26:45] every church every
[26:47] denomination every idea and forming an
[26:51] invisible Union between our Heavenly
[26:54] bridegroom and our Earthly bride
[26:58] this morning before we start our
[27:01] service I would like to play for you 15
[27:06] minutes of our
[27:09] messenger speaking about what a
[27:13] dedication really
[27:15] is and where the
[27:18] dedication takes place if I was still in
[27:22] the Catholic church this morning I would
[27:25] be dressed in some sort of gown and I
[27:27] would have some incense and some water
[27:31] and I'd be walking around throwing the
[27:34] water on the walls and waving the
[27:38] incense as we dedicated the brick and
[27:42] mortar but that's not what we're
[27:44] dedicating this morning I want as we
[27:47] listen to our messenger speak to us and
[27:51] it's our
[27:53] messenger it's your message it was God's
[27:57] voice
[27:58] to
[28:00] you and it's the you that takes the
[28:04] voice to heart and then makes the
[28:09] US so I'd like to play this and this is
[28:13] if I could say that I if I missed
[28:16] anybody and thanking you all I thank you
[28:19] all from the bottom of my heart for
[28:21] being
[28:22] here and for blessing us with your pray
[28:28] prayers and with your
[28:31] presence it's my desire to go forward in
[28:34] a
[28:36] greater will and heart and mind to serve
[28:40] him more than I've ever served him
[28:42] before amen and musicians as we play
[28:46] this just remain
[28:48] comfortable so we're going to start if
[28:51] you some people I know have devices
[28:53] nowadays that they can read along but
[28:57] we're going to start in paragraph
[29:00] 74 of the message that brother brandham
[29:03] preached called
[29:07] dedication I would encourage each of you
[29:10] especially our members of our local
[29:14] assembly here our portion of the body
[29:17] that you go back and and listen to this
[29:21] and find your part but as we play this
[29:25] it's just 15 minutes long just listen
[29:28] listen as he unfolds to
[29:31] us
[29:34] really what needs to be dedicated in
[29:39] order to
[29:41] have a
[29:43] dedication so with always it's with
[29:47] great
[29:48] humility and
[29:51] appreciation that I play for you this
[29:56] morning The Voice
[29:59] of God to this
[30:01] generation you may remain seated as we
[30:04] listen to this portion of the tape and
[30:08] after this Burns within your heart we'll
[30:11] Worship the Lord in
[30:13] song and in word and in Thanksgiving God
[30:18] bless you our messenger William
[30:23] Brandon that is the real church not a
[30:27] Marty and brick and stone and so forth
[30:29] which is perishable but the real church
[30:32] is built upon the revelation of the word
[30:37] and will of God Amen and they've been
[30:41] placed in the body since the Ephesian
[30:44] Church age all the way to the lady OA
[30:47] now but what in the day that when
[30:52] Solomon had completed the
[30:55] temple and the Chief Cornerstone
[30:58] as soon as the
[31:01] builders accepted the
[31:05] rejected amen then the building started
[31:07] going
[31:09] up may I say this with all reverence and
[31:13] with all
[31:14] respects to every man in every church
[31:18] and every man's
[31:20] idea when our Builders today except the
[31:26] rejected and instead of push him off and
[31:29] call him a bunch of Holy
[31:31] Rollers the odd ones that's making
[31:35] confession that much sooner the building
[31:38] will be completed
[31:40] amen but did you notice after the
[31:44] building was completed it was still an
[31:47] empty
[31:49] building amen that was nothing in it but
[31:54] Furniture so Solomon had done all he
[31:57] could
[31:58] do now the great day of dedication
[32:03] come when they were going to dedicate
[32:06] this building for worshippers to worship
[32:11] something now without Something There To
[32:14] Worship the building would have been in
[32:15] vain
[32:18] amen but the building was now ready for
[32:23] dedication and when of the Levites and
[32:26] the priests
[32:28] with thousands of trumpets blasting the
[32:31] sky with lamb after lamb
[32:35] dying for sacrifice for
[32:39] sin and the Levites positionally tuck
[32:42] their
[32:43] place went into the corner and got their
[32:47] poles run them through the rings on the
[32:50] ark where the tables of
[32:53] stone was on the
[32:56] inside two t tables of stone same Stone
[33:00] amen these two are one thank you Lord
[33:03] same Commandments same Covenant when
[33:06] these two tables of stone with the
[33:09] cherabin in their wings pitched across
[33:12] one to another when these Levites only
[33:16] that consecrated group could bear the
[33:19] ark amen no man could touch it outside
[33:22] of them if he did he
[33:25] died and they took these poles KN that
[33:28] they were consecrated to the service for
[33:32] this particular thing and they run the
[33:34] poles to the Rings as been instructed
[33:38] Moses had been by God to build the
[33:40] construction of the Ark and they picked
[33:43] it up from its
[33:48] tents they started marching glory and
[33:51] the trumpet sounding the poies
[33:56] playing the going up from the dead
[33:59] animals that was being sacrificed before
[34:02] Jehovah down through the building of
[34:06] dedication they came thank you Lord till
[34:09] they brought it to its resting
[34:13] place or it fit down into the sockets of
[34:18] the great huge place that have been set
[34:22] part and when it fit down and finally
[34:26] come to its resting
[34:29] place the ark the Bible said that the
[34:35] Lord a des sented
[34:38] down upon the place till it fill the
[34:42] entire Temple
[34:44] amen the pillar of fire came in there
[34:47] with such great glory of God tell the
[34:50] ministers could not Minister anymore
[34:53] because of the glory of
[34:56] God that's when it found its final
[34:59] resting place the shakina of
[35:02] Glory that followed those capping
[35:07] Stone not the corner the capping Stone
[35:11] yes Lord the main
[35:12] thing all other Stones was of not effect
[35:17] until then but this
[35:21] mainstone came in The
[35:25] Headstone and took its place positioning
[35:28] for its resting place for that
[35:31] generation amen the glory of God fill
[35:34] the place where they were sitting and
[35:36] there was shakina Glory upon the whole
[35:39] building and the glory was so great till
[35:42] the priests couldn't even ministers
[35:44] because of the
[35:46] glory now we read now and take from the
[35:50] dedication of the temple let us go now
[35:53] to acts the 7th chapter again and the
[35:56] 44th
[35:57] verse and we start in quotation Stevens
[36:02] in his notable sermon as he preached he
[36:06] said
[36:08] Solomon built him a temple because it
[36:11] was promised through David that he would
[36:15] God promised David that he'd build the
[36:18] temple and God in a
[36:22] type which was to be taken away by an
[36:25] antiy
[36:27] just like the sacrifice of the Lambs at
[36:30] the dedication was a type of the real
[36:32] lamb coming for
[36:35] sacrifice all the natural type and the
[36:39] spiritual and we find out that when this
[36:45] taken place Stevens is speaking of it he
[36:49] said our fathers
[36:51] found a favor before God and Solomon
[36:56] built him a temple
[36:58] but how be it the most high dwelleth not
[37:03] in temples neighbor with
[37:05] hands as a prophet
[37:07] said Heaven is my throne and Earth is my
[37:10] foot stol and where is the house that
[37:12] you can build
[37:16] me Heaven's my
[37:18] Throne Earth is my foot stool and how
[37:21] could you build me a house
[37:24] amen dwell
[37:26] in then how beautiful Hebrews 10:5 but a
[37:31] body has th prepared
[37:33] me amen showing that God was going to
[37:37] dwell in a
[37:41] body prepared me
[37:45] oh and when this body had been made a
[37:50] sacrifice the correct lamb had been
[37:54] sacrificed there was coming forth then
[37:57] God came to his own body which was his
[38:02] bride and there had been
[38:04] 120
[38:06] temples that God had
[38:09] created was ready for dedication that I
[38:13] got all their unbelief beat out of them
[38:17] and they gathered in the upper room and
[38:19] waited for 10 days for dedicational
[38:23] service then when completely surrendered
[38:28] God came down again in the Shina
[38:31] glory and build out a house where they
[38:33] were
[38:36] setting what did God do like the ark
[38:39] dropping into its proper sockets for the
[38:43] message of that day God Dro back into
[38:46] his proper Channel not into a
[38:49] denomination or into a building made
[38:51] with hands but into the heart of man he
[38:55] dropped in his face for the last day
[38:58] which said the prophet Joel it shall
[39:01] come to pass in the last days I'll pour
[39:03] out my shakina upon All Flesh amen your
[39:07] sons and daughters shall prophesy your
[39:10] young man shall dream dreams the old man
[39:12] shall see
[39:14] Visions God came to his resting place
[39:19] where he finds rest not in a building
[39:23] but in the heart of his people amen he
[39:27] finds
[39:29] rest what a shame what a disgrace what a
[39:34] dispos that
[39:36] nimrod's manmade achievement was brought
[39:40] to then yes when Nimrod tried to build a
[39:43] a building or an
[39:45] organization that would reach up to the
[39:48] heavens God upset it amen it became a
[39:54] shame instead of helping man
[39:57] he confused the language of man the one
[40:00] couldn't speak to another it broke up
[40:03] Brotherhood amen but when
[40:06] God came to his own Temple the church
[40:11] the the people when he came to them he
[40:14] filled it the temples that were
[40:16] dedicated just like he did at Solomon's
[40:18] Temple he filled it not with Creeds not
[40:22] with denominations but with himself he
[40:25] filled the temple praise the Lord amen
[40:27] with his shakina glory so did he do on
[40:31] the day of Pentecost he filled them 120
[40:34] temples that was up there with
[40:37] his with the Holy Ghost itself the
[40:40] shakina of Glory broke through upon him
[40:43] and then what Nimrod failed to do build
[40:47] a temple where every man spoke contrary
[40:50] to what he could understand God came
[40:52] down and with one Galilean language made
[40:56] everything understand what he was
[41:00] saying there's God to his
[41:03] Temple God to his dedicated Temple not
[41:07] to a man-made achievement not to what
[41:09] man done but what God did himself oh
[41:12] it's silly to the people they don't get
[41:15] it they were born not to get it so they
[41:18] won't get it the Bible says so all right
[41:21] God always fills his Temple at the day
[41:24] of
[41:25] dedication he fills his Temple he fills
[41:28] it with his the same thing today God
[41:32] will fill every Temple that will
[41:35] thoroughly dedicate itself to him amen
[41:38] any persons that will the temple is not
[41:42] this little building here the temple is
[41:44] not the one in Salt Lake City the temple
[41:47] is not the one in Rome amen the temple
[41:52] is
[41:53] you you are the temple the god wants to
[41:57] dwell in and express himself through it
[42:02] that all nations might know him you are
[42:05] living images of God that God wants to
[42:09] work through praise the Lord and any
[42:11] time that any man or any woman will

[1:35:22] created heaven and Earth is in this
[1:35:26] place and then I heard that this God can
[1:35:29] do anything he's

[1:35:36] hold him down unbelief don't stop
[1:35:38] [Music]

[1:43:25] eldest his wife Rebecca Ken and Linda
[1:43:28] Marilyn and David have come to be with
[1:43:31] us it means so much thank you thank you
[1:43:34] all for for attending to make these
[1:43:37] meetings so special I'm
[1:43:39] overwhelmed as I said on Friday night
[1:43:42] overwhelmed by the love in your hearts
[1:43:45] and what you've done to make these
[1:43:48] meetings possible in this building
[1:43:50] complete and as brother Bram said so
[1:43:52] often it's not the building that we're
[1:43:54] enamored by we're enamored by the people
[1:43:57] that are in the building and I am a I'm
[1:44:02] enamored I
[1:44:04] am I'm enamored when I saw those sisters
[1:44:07] inside there and given what they were
[1:44:09] and sister Grace comes some came by my
[1:44:12] the hallway as I was reading my Bible
[1:44:14] last night after the service and still
[1:44:16] had her cleaning gloves on
[1:44:19] and that impresses me amen that really
[1:44:24] impresses
[1:44:26] me so I I thank God for each and every
[1:44:30] one of you for Brother David that has
[1:44:32] been a dear friend of
[1:44:34] mine and as I said the other night
[1:44:37] you'll never
[1:44:39] know you'll never know what he's done
[1:44:42] for
[1:44:45] us there's this special lady in this
[1:44:48] room of course my darling wife is here
[1:44:51] and but Mary
[1:44:55] when you were here you came at a tough
[1:45:00] time there was a man of God that reached
[1:45:03] out I'll never forget that David never
[1:45:08] and now Marilyn a part of VI's here your
[1:45:10] murals on the wall how special is that
[1:45:14] to have David with you it's so special
[1:45:17] God bless
[1:45:18] you God bless
[1:45:20] you well one of those people you know
[1:45:27] me I just uh I love the Lord a lot and I
[1:45:31] love this message with all my
[1:45:33] heart so I'd like to continue with a
[1:45:36] little bit of a thought change it up a
[1:45:38] little bit from Friday night a very
[1:45:41] present God that's amongst us tonight
[1:45:45] today and I have we have to uh change
[1:45:49] our mindset a little bit because we
[1:45:51] always think oh
[1:45:53] looking for a future or we're looking
[1:45:55] for the past and we think God's going to
[1:45:59] do such great things and he's had done
[1:46:02] great things but I want to say to you T
[1:46:05] today he is doing great
[1:46:08] things not he will do or has done he is
[1:46:13] doing and when we say I'm looking for a
[1:46:16] Rapture you might as well turn around
[1:46:18] and look at one another and say I am the
[1:46:20] part of that rapture
[1:46:23] people are looking for something the
[1:46:24] Plaines to fall out of the sky and cars
[1:46:26] to crash that's nonsense and crazy our
[1:46:29] God is a God that just can take us in a
[1:46:31] moment in the twinkling of an eye he'll
[1:46:34] come as a thief in the night we are in
[1:46:36] the Dark Hour we're living in right now
[1:46:38] and he's catching us away there will be
[1:46:41] a final complete moment when it all
[1:46:44] takes place but we're living in it right
[1:46:46] now and we're looking for his his glory
[1:46:49] is catching away the power of God has
[1:46:52] returned back back into the Bride of
[1:46:54] Jesus
[1:46:55] Christ we sing and I know you sing it I
[1:46:58] maybe you don't maybe I need to teach
[1:47:00] you and then that would be a
[1:47:03] disaster we have the power of
[1:47:07] God not you know I know I know we get it
[1:47:10] we get excited because somebody says it
[1:47:13] in the Pulpit or you know somebody jumps
[1:47:15] up say we got the power of God you walk
[1:47:19] out these doors and you can barely you
[1:47:21] know get to the car without even
[1:47:24] admitting you know we've got another
[1:47:26] thing to do today where's your power
[1:47:28] gone where's your confession it has to
[1:47:32] be a living
[1:47:34] life if it doesn't get down to that it's
[1:47:37] worthless you know people have rise up
[1:47:40] and thought they were somebody they're
[1:47:43] nothing you know how important you are
[1:47:45] brother Braham said you just put your
[1:47:46] finger in a little bucket of water pull
[1:47:49] it out and see how important you are
[1:47:52] we're nobody's outside of Christ Jesus
[1:47:55] himself who has called us his elected
[1:47:58] lady which makes us now somebody but as
[1:48:01] a pastor said already today there's no
[1:48:03] big eyes and there's no little use we're
[1:48:07] just one
[1:48:08] body we're one body and we need one
[1:48:11] another amen amen and I believe that the
[1:48:14] bride is coming to a position where she
[1:48:17] knows exactly brother brm said who she
[1:48:19] is and who she is called for and he said
[1:48:22] when that takes place the Rapture
[1:48:24] happens so I believe I'm living in that
[1:48:27] time in
[1:48:28] manifestation I am not looking for a
[1:48:31] super
[1:48:34] Church somebody
[1:48:37] scream I'm the super
[1:48:40] church
[1:48:42] hallu say what what are you looking for
[1:48:45] down the
[1:48:46] road brother Ram said there will be a a
[1:48:49] virtuous spotless sinless bride of Jesus
[1:48:52] Christ amen who is
[1:48:55] she come
[1:48:57] on I'm one of
[1:49:00] them one of them you know and and people
[1:49:04] get it all theological and they want to
[1:49:06] break it all down and then show them
[1:49:08] there's somebody you're nobody he made
[1:49:11] us somebody and I happen to be one of
[1:49:16] them amen
[1:49:20] amen the power of God's return turned
[1:49:22] back into the church it always has been
[1:49:25] in the church but now in this last days
[1:49:29] the full
[1:49:30] unveiling has now been revealed to a
[1:49:34] people and I I I'm going to preach a
[1:49:36] little subject on the Deep calls to the
[1:49:40] deep and you could not have been born in
[1:49:43] any other hour but this
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:49] hour I I want you to really get that
[1:49:52] your
[1:49:54] deep that God put in
[1:49:56] you could not have lived in
[1:49:59] Pentecost could not have lived at
[1:50:01] Luther's age because that deep would
[1:50:04] have
[1:50:06] exploded as brother Michael was talking
[1:50:08] about the temple and going into the
[1:50:10] shikina glory we couldn't have been
[1:50:12] birthed then because only one could go
[1:50:15] in once a
[1:50:16] year I would have to jump on his
[1:50:20] shoulders because I've been born to
[1:50:23] dwell in the shakina glory of almighty
[1:50:27] God I'm not looking saints of God for
[1:50:30] your amens and Hallelujah I'm in the
[1:50:33] amen and I've got the
[1:50:36] Hallelujah you know if you get quiet on
[1:50:39] me I'll get louder I get louder you
[1:50:41] might get louder I don't know what but
[1:50:43] it's not how loud that's right it's how
[1:50:47] you
[1:50:48] live and if this word isn't alive to you
[1:50:51] just pack up your bags
[1:50:53] go is that
[1:50:56] okay i' said at home I've got
[1:51:00] witnesses and don't let the door hit you
[1:51:02] on your way
[1:51:03] out but if we have been called to this
[1:51:06] Hallelujah this should be the greatest
[1:51:09] time and moment of your life right
[1:51:14] now my goodness we're the bride we're
[1:51:19] the elect we're the
[1:51:21] chosen I could be changed in a moment in
[1:51:24] a twinkling of an eye right
[1:51:28] now who's coming with
[1:51:30] me who's coming that's something we're
[1:51:34] shouting about you know I shout when
[1:51:36] that you know the fast music goes yeah
[1:51:39] glory to God when it's real
[1:51:42] soft where's the glory that
[1:51:45] changed Rock of
[1:51:48] Ages where's it
[1:51:50] Hallelujah no no no no see you weren't
[1:51:53] quiet you were quiet already Hallelujah
[1:51:56] so you're dictated by how how fast the
[1:51:58] beat
[1:52:01] is I'm not looking at
[1:52:04] anybody I don't hardly know any all of
[1:52:07] you but I know one thing Saints nothing
[1:52:11] as we said the other night nothing not
[1:52:15] tribulation nothing will separate us
[1:52:18] from the love of God
[1:52:23] all right
[1:52:25] deep oh you say brother Tom I've heard
[1:52:29] that
[1:52:31] deep calling to the deep is deeper than
[1:52:36] you
[1:52:39] think
[1:52:41] deep calling to the deep is not lucky
[1:52:44] the pastor took my
[1:52:49] watch and now we're in trouble
[1:52:53] he's even got me bound up and I haven't
[1:52:56] even
[1:52:58] started deep calling to the Deep let's
[1:53:02] turn to Psalms 42 please S I did all
[1:53:06] that to get as I said the other night to
[1:53:08] get my butterflies all flying in
[1:53:15] order one of the most
[1:53:19] incredible
[1:53:20] incredible scripture in
[1:53:25] Bible you know brother Bron Easter seal
[1:53:28] true Easter seal he says you couldn't
[1:53:31] even put that desire
[1:53:33] there you couldn't even have it unless
[1:53:35] God put that desire in you for
[1:53:42] him praise the
[1:53:45] Lord put a desire to seek out the king
[1:53:48] of kings and Lord Supreme that is a
[1:53:52] great great
[1:53:54] deep Psalms 42 verse
[1:54:02] 1 I'm
[1:54:07] sorry as the heart panteth after the
[1:54:11] water
[1:54:12] Brooks so
[1:54:14] panth my
[1:54:17] soul after thee Oh
[1:54:20] God my soul thirst
[1:54:23] for
[1:54:25] God for the Living
[1:54:28] God When shall I come and appear before
[1:54:32] God my
[1:54:40] tears I've been my
[1:54:43] meat day and
[1:54:47] night while they continually saying to
[1:54:50] me
[1:54:53] where is thy God verse
[1:54:57] seven
[1:54:59] deep calling unto the
[1:55:02] Deep at the noise of thy water
[1:55:06] spouts all thy
[1:55:08] ways and all thy
[1:55:11] bills are
[1:55:13] gone over me let's pray
[1:55:19] father maybe a little message this
[1:55:22] morning
[1:55:24] morning make it a realization to the
[1:55:27] hearts from the youngest to the
[1:55:30] oldest that this great deep was given by
[1:55:33] almighty God by the predestinated plan
[1:55:37] of your
[1:55:38] grace so this morning we have been
[1:55:41] assembled by the forn knowledge of God
[1:55:44] knowing where each one would be sitting
[1:55:47] what every heart is
[1:55:49] thinking and so father I'm praying now
[1:55:53] collectively Lord as they were in the
[1:55:56] upper room when the Holy Ghost did fall
[1:55:58] on those temples they were in one mind
[1:56:02] one heart and one Accord so would we be
[1:56:06] in that place this morning Lord maybe
[1:56:08] for just a little while as we Fellowship
[1:56:12] around your glorious word we ask in
[1:56:15] Jesus name amen amen you may have your
[1:56:18] seats
[1:56:30] you know life is
[1:56:31] a is a
[1:56:34] paradox here I am
[1:56:36] crying but those aren't tears of hurt or
[1:56:40] pain they're actually tears of
[1:56:46] joy but I'm going to read a quote where
[1:56:49] brother Bram said in why Christ speak
[1:56:55] why cry to
[1:56:57] me that cry was not the Cry of joy that
[1:57:00] was a different type of
[1:57:02] cry they were perplexed and they were
[1:57:06] pondering and they were
[1:57:09] wondering how can they get out of this
[1:57:13] situation God told them to go to a
[1:57:16] mountain and that mountain would be a
[1:57:18] token to them but there was obstacles in
[1:57:22] the
[1:57:23] way but those that are the seed of
[1:57:27] God have now looked back and seen the
[1:57:30] shadow
[1:57:31] type and we know the end of the
[1:57:35] story the Red Sea didn't stop
[1:57:40] them they still got to the
[1:57:43] mountain stay with me doesn't matter
[1:57:47] what you're going
[1:57:49] through nothing's going to stop you from
[1:57:52] obtaining what God promised you and he's
[1:57:56] promised you a Rapture change and
[1:57:58] there's no devil no Spirit no nothing is
[1:58:03] going to stop you from attaining what
[1:58:06] God's promised you this
[1:58:10] morning if you have to wash your face
[1:58:13] and stay awake don't do it I'll give you
[1:58:16] five
[1:58:19] minutes if you're tired wake up
[1:58:25] this is something that's
[1:58:27] better Pastor said better than a hockey
[1:58:33] game it's better than a Texas baseball
[1:58:38] game Dallas Stars hockey
[1:58:41] game don't get don't look at me like you
[1:58:44] don't know what I'm talking
[1:58:46] about uhhuh and I don't even know what
[1:58:50] your basketball
[1:58:52] somebody here
[1:58:53] know
[1:58:56] oh
[1:58:59] gotcha it's the
[1:59:01] Mavericks my goodness it's better than
[1:59:05] that you heard it already everything
[1:59:08] said songs were sung I just go the song
[1:59:10] sung the message was in dedication was
[1:59:13] done Pastor speaks why don't we just
[1:59:15] sing amen and go home it's all
[1:59:20] done but we find out saints of God that
[1:59:24] what the Lord has given
[1:59:26] us so
[1:59:29] surpasses your brand new Cadillac and a
[1:59:32] smelling leather
[1:59:33] car don't you just love that
[1:59:37] smell oh you know you love the smell of
[1:59:39] new
[1:59:41] leather do you know they sell more
[1:59:43] products by
[1:59:45] smell by the
[1:59:47] senses they did a study one time and
[1:59:50] they thought you know this card
[1:59:52] dealership needed to sell more cars so
[1:59:54] they put an ad in there where you
[1:59:56] scratched and it scratched and it
[1:59:58] smelled of new
[2:00:00] leather do you know they sold out all
[2:00:03] their
[2:00:04] cars because the sense of
[2:00:07] smell LED them to their
[2:00:11] C well I got a higher sense called six
[2:00:15] sense and it should raise us up a little
[2:00:17] bit
[2:00:18] higher and we should P be pulling a
[2:00:20] Little Bit Stronger
[2:00:22] and we're looking for a Rapture and it
[2:00:24] might be this message that you're going
[2:00:26] to hear this morning and we're going to
[2:00:28] be
[2:00:34] translated
[2:00:36] deep calling for the Deep brother Bram

[2:06:34] mothers let me give you
[2:06:36] courage stand up and say I claim my lost
[2:06:42] children
[2:06:45] hallu you say well brother Tom that's a
[2:06:49] very bold statement to make well we have
[2:06:52] Believers here from our church and I
[2:06:54] said on Mother's Day why don't you claim
[2:06:57] your children and stand to your
[2:06:59] feet and one sister stood to her feet
[2:07:02] who had no
[2:07:04] children had no children for years I
[2:07:07] think it's 16 years but she says I'm
[2:07:09] standing for my child and God gave her
[2:07:13] her
[2:07:15] [Applause]
[2:07:20] child says this is what we
[2:07:23] believe you say I got a Lost Child
[2:07:25] believe for your child your son believe
[2:07:28] for your son your wife your husband
[2:07:30] believe for them
[2:07:32] yes say well last night I heard if I
[2:07:35] don't have the Holy Ghost just ask for
[2:07:37] the Holy Ghost go home and pray for the
[2:07:38] Holy Ghost why not receive it right now
[2:07:41] receive ye the Holy
[2:07:45] Ghost we get mental thoughts and this is
[2:07:49] what's going to happen
[2:07:52] I you know we almost get Catholic in our
[2:07:54] thinking that's right I got to kneel to
[2:07:57] there and I got to go here you know
[2:07:59] there's been many miraculous people in
[2:08:01] our church that were saved not at
[2:08:04] church
[2:08:06] bedrooms at work behind the steering
[2:08:09] wheel of their
[2:08:11] car and a a lot at
[2:08:15] church it just doesn't matter if you're
[2:08:18] his you're going to get saved
[2:08:22] but the problem of it is we get an idea
[2:08:24] of what that is that's right because
[2:08:27] brother Ram said you're always worth
[2:08:28] saved that's right the only reason you
[2:08:32] gave your heart to the Lord was to prove
[2:08:34] that you always
[2:08:37] saved you were saved before the
[2:08:39] foundation of the world you never were
[2:08:46] lost well let's put it this way yeah I
[2:08:49] guess you were but you actually awoken
[2:08:53] come on you awoke to the
[2:08:56] realization that you were lost and you
[2:08:58] needed Jesus
[2:09:01] Christ and look what it's done for
[2:09:03] you look what it's done to you and look
[2:09:07] how much more it's going to do for
[2:09:10] you look how much more it's going to all
[2:09:13] of a
[2:09:14] sudden I'm
[2:09:16] blond and you say well that that's a
[2:09:19] cute little analogy no it's fact
[2:09:22] half of us are going to lose half our
[2:09:27] weight man I thought I'd get a little
[2:09:29] bit more than that a
[2:09:32] little and it'll take a revelation to
[2:09:35] know who I am as it will for me to know
[2:09:38] you and God will give us that
[2:09:41] Revelation but there's a
[2:09:43] deep calling to the
[2:09:48] Deep one thing about a deep the Deep
[2:09:51] never
[2:09:54] stops because once you get to where your
[2:09:57] deep is you want more of the
[2:10:04] deep brother
[2:10:07] Mike is that you back there with that
[2:10:09] all that white and gray
[2:10:11] hair man shocked me the other night I
[2:10:15] wonder who that old fellow was back
[2:10:17] there I knew him before he was married
[2:10:24] my goodness and here we are going on in
[2:10:28] time breaking into
[2:10:30] eternity living and loving this word and
[2:10:34] wanting more why are you still
[2:10:39] here I'm a prisoner I can't
[2:10:43] go people say I'm throwing the tow I
[2:10:45] said go ahead throw it in if you can you
[2:10:48] weren't his
[2:10:51] if you can walk away from this you never
[2:10:53] were
[2:10:54] Gods you can't walk away from
[2:10:57] this I'm a prisoner to
[2:11:00] Christ my Deep's been calling to the
[2:11:02] Deep for a long
[2:11:04] time and all I want is
[2:11:08] more you sing that little chorus all it
[2:11:11] was one of my favorite ones 50 years
[2:11:13] ago I want more of
[2:11:17] Jesus more and more and
[2:11:20] more I I want more of Jesus than I ever
[2:11:24] had
[2:11:25] before I want more of his great love so
[2:11:28] rich so full and
[2:11:30] free I want more of Jesus so I'll give
[2:11:35] him of who
[2:11:39] me I I don't know why I sing like
[2:11:44] that but there's a Time saints of God we
[2:11:47] come to
[2:11:49] maturity and we see our children we
[2:11:52] never thought that our children would

[2:14:01] realize by the word that has been
[2:14:04] unveiled to us you have power to
[2:14:09] bind and power to
[2:14:14] loose that has to become such a re a
[2:14:18] revelation or reality let's put it that
[2:14:20] way
[2:14:23] it's
[2:14:24] both you've been given the power to bind
[2:14:27] and the power to loose well you say no
[2:14:29] brother brandham was given that power
[2:14:32] well then you haven't read the church
[2:14:33] age book in the church age book he said
[2:14:36] under their messenger they get the same
[2:14:39] Privileges and
[2:14:45] benefits it's very important to stay in
[2:14:47] the
[2:14:49] word very important
[2:14:53] important God gave us a
[2:14:56] message to put us in our place in the
[2:15:03] body my thumb is not worried about my
[2:15:07] little
[2:15:09] toe but it's a complete
[2:15:13] body as I've said before did you wake up
[2:15:16] this morning and say praise the Lord for
[2:15:18] your spleen
[2:15:23] come
[2:15:23] on without your
[2:15:26] spleen what's going to
[2:15:28] happen Lord I Thank you for my brain
[2:15:30] this
[2:15:33] morning it's a part of the body it's
[2:15:37] functioning but when something gets hurt
[2:15:39] you know it's
[2:15:42] hurt and so that's why he's given us
[2:15:45] promises I'm the Lord God that Health
[2:15:48] all thy diseases cuz you're deep was
[2:15:51] going to call for a healing so then
[2:15:54] saints of God really if the word of God
[2:15:57] says it why would we
[2:15:59] cry why don't we just speak it and say
[2:16:03] Satan you can't have my
[2:16:11] body
[2:16:13] really do I is it is it the pitch or the
[2:16:18] deciple is it because I go
[2:16:22] Satan or
[2:16:25] devil
[2:16:29] Satan it's your faith in what you're
[2:16:34] saying and you watch Satan
[2:16:38] flee I've got a wife who ironed shirts
[2:16:42] said Satan you can't have my third son
[2:16:47] you can't have him I prayed for him he's
[2:16:51] a gift of
[2:16:52] God
[2:16:55] ironing and by the grace of God God gave
[2:16:58] us our third son
[2:17:04] salvation I I don't think she was
[2:17:06] yelling it I think she was ironing
[2:17:10] it devil I'm scorching
[2:17:15] you I think we need to put a little bit
[2:17:18] of heat on the devil
[2:17:21] stop letting him push you you push back
[2:17:25] and say Satan as a matter of fact you're
[2:17:28] an offense to me get behind
[2:17:32] me come on that's where we're at not
[2:17:37] your theology but in
[2:17:39] reality Satan is under your
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:46] feet oh we want the proper preacher now
[2:17:51] oh you say and it's a dead
[2:17:55] church or you get the OV
[2:17:58] excited horns
[2:18:02] blowing I just want
[2:18:05] Christ Give Me
[2:18:08] Jesus he'll do the
[2:18:16] work we'll get off the first
[2:18:19] line I have don't watch you
[2:18:24] know the brother should oh there's a
[2:18:26] clock is that a clock
[2:18:31] oh I got to find some way
[2:18:34] out you need me to get
[2:18:38] out it's
[2:18:40] impossible you might as well realize
[2:18:43] this you could never been born in any
[2:18:46] other age than this age because your
[2:18:49] deep would have been greater than any
[2:18:50] anything that they had back there but in
[2:18:52] this they God open the word of God to
[2:18:56] fill you
[2:18:57] up and fulfill the hunger and deep of
[2:19:01] your soul he loosed the seals he opened
[2:19:05] himself up to you to let you know you
[2:19:09] came out of
[2:19:10] [Music]
[2:19:16] him oh God he says in Psalm 631
[2:19:23] that's why I life about the scripture
[2:19:25] because it's
[2:19:28] personal oh God Thou
[2:19:31] Art brother David's
[2:19:35] God who's
[2:19:38] God who's God God my
[2:19:44] God Amen oh God Thou Art my God early
[2:19:49] will I seek thee
[2:19:51] my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[2:19:54] longth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[2:19:58] land where there is no water to see what
[2:20:03] just
[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:09] church huh that would be
[2:20:13] ridiculous to have a church where God is
[2:20:16] not
[2:20:17] moving and the moving isn't what you
[2:20:20] think the moving
[2:20:22] is cuz some people think it's the shout
[2:20:25] some people think it's the dance some
[2:20:27] people think it's just the
[2:20:30] world but the moving of God is his word
[2:20:33] in his
[2:20:34] people and you really know when he's
[2:20:36] moving when the people get transformed
[2:20:38] by the power of the
[2:20:41] word amen all of a sudden you're sitting
[2:20:44] there and go that's right that's me
[2:20:49] that's not David that's that's me God
[2:20:52] wrote that in the Bible for
[2:20:54] me David thirst I
[2:20:58] thirst has to be a
[2:21:01] reality but we still want
[2:21:04] an
[2:21:06] hierarchy of course God's got in his
[2:21:09] church Apostles prophets evangelists
[2:21:11] pastors preachers and teachers but you
[2:21:13] show me where the Prophet made himself
[2:21:15] somebody that's right amen show me one
[2:21:19] place where he said I'm the major
[2:21:21] prophet you listen to me God's with me
[2:21:24] if any man could have done it he could
[2:21:26] have done
[2:21:26] it raising the dead healing thousands
[2:21:30] upon hundreds of thousands did he have a
[2:21:33] stuffed
[2:21:34] shirt did
[2:21:36] he you I know I read an article I was
[2:21:39] doing some research on on South Africa
[2:21:42] when brother Brandon was was there in so
[2:21:44] Derman South Africa and they couldn't
[2:21:47] even get into the city to get to the
[2:21:50] meeting
[2:21:51] 20 miles outside of the city it was
[2:21:55] Chalker blocked the streets were loaded
[2:21:58] you couldn't ride they said hardly a
[2:22:00] bicycle because everybody was trying to
[2:22:03] maneuver and people were getting healed
[2:22:07] 20
[2:22:10] miles away from where the Prophet was so
[2:22:14] let me ask you something was it the
[2:22:16] prophet or was it the angel that was
[2:22:20] with the the prophet I say it was God in
[2:22:23] the
[2:22:25] prophet hallu and if we could get the
[2:22:27] reality and you need a healing when you
[2:22:30] walk through those doors you can lift up
[2:22:33] your hand and say praise be to God
[2:22:35] because God is not a god of yesterday
[2:22:39] he's a god of the
[2:22:43] [Music]
[2:22:49] present he's the god of the present
[2:22:53] amen thank you
[2:22:59] Lord oh anybody that wants to fact check
[2:23:02] you can put this up on the screen so
[2:23:04] that they can fact check me as I
[2:23:07] go it's door to the heart
[2:23:10] 1959 God wants to come
[2:23:14] in did you get that up there man you
[2:23:18] have it always up there when I want it
[2:23:19] it's not up there
[2:23:22] how does that
[2:23:24] work there you
[2:23:26] go God wants to come in
[2:23:30] and he doesn't want to come in
[2:23:37] and we can leave that up there a little
[2:23:41] while huh right I think we can leave
[2:23:44] that up there a little while let that
[2:23:46] one really soak in God wants to come
[2:23:49] into you
[2:23:51] to control you not come into you that
[2:23:55] you would control
[2:23:58] him Lord you do this you you do this you
[2:24:01] do this I'm commanding you to do this I
[2:24:04] tell you this who are
[2:24:07] you Lord would you if it's in your will
[2:24:11] and mind Lord I want to make myself
[2:24:16] available as Michael said there's
[2:24:19] approaches there's
[2:24:21] approaches you got to approach right all
[2:24:24] these guys are I think it was Brother
[2:24:26] David and I were talking I command God
[2:24:29] who are
[2:24:32] you how does that
[2:24:35] happen it
[2:24:38] impossible but let the god in you
[2:24:41] control
[2:24:44] you we just had a brother get
[2:24:47] saved a brother and a sister I'm
[2:24:50] what's their name the Rebecca David
[2:24:56] walner sammon Stephany just saved he's
[2:25:01] at work he says God tells me to leave
[2:25:05] work well all all of a sudden half of
[2:25:07] you already go yeah he's very spiritual
[2:25:09] God told him to leave
[2:25:12] work ah but the thing of it
[2:25:16] is if there's an
[2:25:18] eternal result
[2:25:21] it's
[2:25:22] God he left
[2:25:25] work and and the Lord told him turn left
[2:25:28] he turns left turn right turns right he
[2:25:30] why am I even doing this go to this
[2:25:33] store he says I was just at that store
[2:25:36] so he goes to the store he walks in the
[2:25:38] store and he was hearing this gentleman
[2:25:40] tell the person at the store his
[2:25:42] problems and David was saying I've had
[2:25:45] those same
[2:25:46] problems those are exactly the same
[2:25:48] problems high blood pressure this
[2:25:50] pressure whatever all the problems were
[2:25:53] and David thought hey I'm just going to
[2:25:55] wait outside and you know when he comes
[2:25:58] out I'm going to tell them whatever
[2:25:59] problems you got you don't have to have
[2:26:01] them cuz I used to have them Jesus took
[2:26:04] care of
[2:26:05] them they came to church he's got no
[2:26:18] problems that's made up story that's
[2:26:22] just happened in the last couple of
[2:26:23] months a wonderful couple baptized in
[2:26:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:26:29] accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their
[2:26:31] savior because one man was led by the
[2:26:35] spirit that's right come on it wasn't
[2:26:38] him controlling God it was God
[2:26:40] controlling him God let that deep start
[2:26:44] controlling us
[2:26:54] God wants to come in to control come in
[2:26:57] and control you he doesn't want to come
[2:27:00] in and be controlled by you he wants to
[2:27:03] come in for his own purpose of
[2:27:06] controlling you leading you to eternal
[2:27:09] life something good for you for when you
[2:27:12] accept Jesus you must say thou art my
[2:27:18] God Thou Art my God you want God to
[2:27:22] control you I'll give you a secret just
[2:27:25] from a prophet Thou Art my God you might
[2:27:30] as well say it Thou Art my god control
[2:27:34] me
[2:27:35] Lord control me thou art my God take me
[2:27:40] all that I am soul body and spirit I
[2:27:45] dedicate myself to you no intellectuals

[2:42:27] me make me more like you
[2:42:35] Lord see thing the thing of it is David
[2:42:39] he did something very special this
[2:42:41] morning he took my
[2:42:43] watch you know what it's
[2:42:45] worth huh you know what it's worth I
[2:42:48] don't even know what it's worth
[2:42:50] it's an Apple Watch everybody's got an
[2:42:51] Apple
[2:42:54] Watch but I had a brother come from
[2:42:57] India and I my wife had given me a for
[2:43:00] an anniversary very nice watch and I
[2:43:03] went moose
[2:43:04] hunting and when I got this mousse I
[2:43:07] gutted it out and I it was the most
[2:43:09] expensive mousse I ever
[2:43:11] had cuz my watch stayed in the
[2:43:15] guts if that's too gross for you forgive
[2:43:17] me that's hunting talk so we car got the
[2:43:21] carcass back home and I went to my watch
[2:43:24] is gone so Marilyn had moved
[2:43:28] to
[2:43:30] Florida and uh we went to New Orleans
[2:43:33] for a day and we're going through the
[2:43:35] old junk stores and I found a watch five
[2:43:40] bucks I said that's a nice Five Buck
[2:43:43] watch I love that watch I bought that
[2:43:46] watch five bucks so I put that watch
[2:43:49] watch on I'm proud of that little five
[2:43:50] buck watch and a brother comes from
[2:43:53] overseas and he he says you preachers
[2:43:55] here your big cars and fancy houses and
[2:43:59] Rich watches and things like that and he
[2:44:01] comes over to me and he grabs my arm he
[2:44:04] says how much was that
[2:44:08] worth I said five
[2:44:12] bucks his service went flat
[2:44:19] his point was
[2:44:22] lost but you know what saints of God if
[2:44:25] he would have asked me for my coat I
[2:44:27] wouldn't give it to
[2:44:30] him I thought can I go through that test
[2:44:34] this a nice
[2:44:36] suit but I do it but you only ask for my
[2:44:43] watch but you know what I'm happy about
[2:44:46] I was willing to do it
[2:44:49] wasn't
[2:44:51] begrudging wasn't taking a second
[2:44:54] thought I just say I I could do
[2:44:58] that I could do
[2:45:02] that I want to live in that
[2:45:06] land ask for your coat give him your
[2:45:11] cloak more than just
[2:45:14] scripture it's
[2:45:17] life it's just
[2:45:29] life are you looking for a
[2:45:33] city is your deep looking for a
[2:45:36] city can you
[2:45:38] imagine Abraham at
[2:45:41] 75 set in his lifestyle maybe had a nice
[2:45:45] house and
[2:45:46] acreage but a voice spoke
[2:45:50] said separate yourself
[2:45:52] Abraham from
[2:45:57] everything if I brought Abraham up on
[2:45:59] the platform this
[2:46:03] morning and I said
[2:46:05] Abraham was it worth giving everything
[2:46:10] up I don't believe that there would be a
[2:46:12] second
[2:46:13] thought no he said you know at first I
[2:46:17] thought M okay
[2:46:19] Lord is that you when you find out that
[2:46:21] it's him it's
[2:46:23] easy amen Lord is that
[2:46:26] you
[2:46:27] okay but then what did he give him
[2:46:31] brother Bram said in one place Abraham
[2:46:33] gave him an
[2:46:35] acre and God gave him the
[2:46:39] world so you think you're giving up
[2:46:43] something you're giving up
[2:46:45] nothing say I gave up a career you gave
[2:46:48] up
[2:46:49] nothing I got I got a I I'm going to a
[2:46:54] city that's paid with
[2:46:57] gold transparent gold I'm going to an
[2:47:02] Eden that is actually right
[2:47:05] here this church actually is going to be
[2:47:08] ashes you work so hard but he's giving
[2:47:11] he'll give you something
[2:47:14] better because when God takes something
[2:47:16] he always gives you something
[2:47:21] better if you get just get that
[2:47:24] principle if he takes anything he's
[2:47:27] going to he's he's a debor to no
[2:47:32] man so if something it seems to be
[2:47:36] taken he's going to give you something
[2:47:41] better we've all had things taken from
[2:47:44] us but then as we look back we say but
[2:47:47] Lord you gave me this
[2:47:51] this don't you love him this
[2:47:55] morning so Abraham seeking a city who
[2:47:59] Builder and maker was
[2:48:00] God it's just Abraham I mean brother
[2:48:03] Abraham says he was just a simple farmer
[2:48:06] man and he was just had all these 318
[2:48:10] trained
[2:48:11] Shepherds that trained with a
[2:48:14] hoe but they could fight kingdoms
[2:48:23] so it's not our
[2:48:26] fight it's not our
[2:48:29] battle can you imagine Mike you and me
[2:48:32] with a
[2:48:33] sickle fighting all ceder's army they
[2:48:36] got Spears brass
[2:48:39] plate
[2:48:41] swords and you and I got a
[2:48:43] sickle oh we'd get him would we we'd get
[2:48:47] him and there'd be a pile of them there
[2:48:50] and say this is
[2:48:52] amazing just like Samson that was
[2:48:55] amazing and how many spirits have you
[2:48:58] walked over in your 20 30
[2:49:00] years you just haven't seen what you've
[2:49:03] walked over brother Bram said in one
[2:49:06] place you walk a Victorious son and
[2:49:08] daughter of God walking down the street
[2:49:12] he said the dev devils are fainting and
[2:49:16] Howling but you don't know that
[2:49:21] but someone went to another
[2:49:23] land and told us those devils are
[2:49:28] trembling because you Brother Jay are
[2:49:30] going to go to work
[2:49:35] tomorrow
[2:49:38] deep
[2:49:42] calling to the
[2:49:45] Deep how much more is your deep calling
[2:49:49] for at this dedication service are we
[2:49:53] willing to really dedicate our
[2:49:56] lives and say
[2:49:58] Lord I want more of
[2:50:05] you I wish I could sing like
[2:50:09] Michael and then I'd break out in
[2:50:12] song more of
[2:50:16] you I get wrong key and everything else
[2:50:22] that's a Joyful
[2:50:25] Noise but I hope this is making a little
[2:50:27] sense to some of
[2:50:30] you that when you walk through the doors
[2:50:32] you go home and you open your Bible and
[2:50:34] you read the message you listen to
[2:50:39] it that it will become more than just a
[2:50:45] quote it will become life amen
[2:50:50] why

[2:51:13] care but our deep
[2:51:18] has conquered Satan's
[2:51:25] Eden you say well that's not strong meat
[2:51:29] it's pretty
[2:51:30] strong pretty strong because your deep
[2:51:34] is going to change you yes the deep is

[2:51:41] going to get you on the
[2:51:42] throne glory to God for the deep that
[2:51:45] calls to the Deep

[2:52:06] said
[2:52:08] that Tick Tock I somebody said it the
[2:52:12] other day Tick Tock I thought that was
[2:52:15] like Captain blly or something tick tock

[2:52:24] Tock is I don't
[2:52:29] like I don't I don't like anything that
[2:52:32] Satan
[2:52:33] does you know brother BR said about tape
[2:52:36] recorder that the tape recorder was
[2:52:38] invented for this
[2:52:43] message I'll take that
[2:52:46] technology yeah and now you can use it

[2:52:52] on you can put a a lot of wrong things
[2:52:53] on your phone you can put a lot wrong
[2:52:55] things on your iPads and computers but
[2:52:58] you also can put a lot of good things
[2:53:02] on so take off the Bad and put on the
[2:53:06] good let your
[2:53:08] deep start calling to the Deep because
[2:53:12] your deep conquers Satan's Eden amen
[2:53:19] amen it destroys the enemy in your
[2:53:25] lifeall you say well that's such a
[2:53:28] that's a pivotal pivotal
[2:53:31] message and if if if I'm wrong God
[2:53:35] forgive me and if I'm wrong May the
[2:53:37] pastor forgive me but God so had it that
[2:53:40] the only film ever made about William
[2:53:43] brandham outside of the Full Gospel
[2:53:45] businessman but I'm talking about a
[2:53:47] meeting what was the
[2:53:49] recording
[2:53:52] deep one
[2:53:57] message how important what do you think
[2:54:00] Satan's even trying to do take what your
[2:54:06] deep throw this at
[2:54:08] you catch you up hurts
[2:54:14] pains so that you dwell on it so you're
[2:54:18] not dwelling on
[2:54:21] him let's get rid of him and dwell on
[2:54:26] him yes you

[2:54:40] attentive and God bless
[2:54:43] you but I hope this is real back there
[2:54:46] say it's here it's not that there's any
[2:54:49] space or distance with
[2:54:54] God I like you a Ponder this in the days
[2:55:00] ahead a very simple
[2:55:03] phrase deep calls to the deep and that
[2:55:08] deep will destroy Satan in my
[2:55:14] life because that deep is God and God is
[2:55:18] coming and God is dealing and God is
[2:55:25] Conquering I see a picture
[2:55:28] here there's a picture on a wall many of

[2:56:32] down so that was a picture of Pillar of
[2:56:34] Fire that's a picture of Revelation

[2:57:29] message because your deep was calling to
[2:57:31] defeat Satan and Satan's
[2:57:42] Eden the picture of it hangs

[2:58:10] Israel amen
[2:58:13] amen the god that knocked Paul off his
[2:58:16] horse that's right
[2:58:19] amen is the same God that hung over our
[2:58:24] Prophet to let you know he's the same
[2:58:28] yesterday today and
[2:58:31] [Applause]

[2:58:57] you and keep you in the
[2:59:00] way you don't have to get get be worried
[2:59:03] about getting out of the way if you're
[2:59:04] his child you'll never get out of the
[2:59:07] way for he is the way the truth and the
[2:59:14] life and I am actually in him
[2:59:18] I am in the
[2:59:23] way
[2:59:26] Hallelujah but if you'll obey his
[2:59:30] voice then I will be an enemy
[2:59:36] hallu to thine
[2:59:40] enemy think about it how many obey the
[2:59:44] voice of Malachi 4 how many how many

[3:00:12] voice I will be an
[3:00:14] enemy to your enemy

[3:00:29] voice and I'm sending the angel
[3:00:35] after so whatever your situation in need
[3:00:37] is this morning if you've obeyed the
[3:00:40] voice of God in this last
[3:00:42] age then he will be an enemy to your
[3:00:46] enemy now you can tell Dev hey

[3:00:55] catching a revelation this morning I've
[3:00:58] obeyed God's voice my deep called for
[3:01:00] that voice and because I obeyed that
[3:01:03] voice my God is going to be an enemy to
[3:01:07] you
[3:01:20] I want to get to a certain point so that
[3:01:22] we could
[3:01:26] close when all Heaven opens
[3:01:29] up all hell opens up or can I say when
[3:01:33] all hell opens up all
[3:01:37] Heaven has come
[3:01:42] down notice again not only that when all
[3:01:45] hell turns loose all hell
[3:01:48] turns loose also that's a quotable
[3:01:53] quote Satan's Army brings
[3:01:56] diseases
[3:01:59] Hallelujah I want your deep to start
[3:02:04] responding Satan's Army brings
[3:02:06] diseases but God's Army's
[3:02:09] commission to cast them
[3:02:13] [Music]
[3:02:13] [Applause]
[3:02:14] out deep calling to the Deep
[3:02:18] we are not a defeated people we are a
[3:02:22] Victorious people because God is living
[3:02:26] in us and that is the
[3:02:39] Deep for the preaching of the Cross is
[3:02:41] to them that perish
[3:02:44] foolishness but unto us which are SA
[3:02:47] saved it's the power of
[3:02:52] God does everybody hear that did you
[3:02:55] hear that wait in the corner way in the
[3:02:57] back just wave your hand you heard that
[3:03:00] right okay scripture say First
[3:03:04] Corinthians 1:18 for the preaching of
[3:03:07] the
[3:03:08] Cross is to them that perish
[3:03:13] foolishness but unto us
[3:03:18] which are
[3:03:19] saved it is the power of
[3:03:25] God
[3:03:27] glory if you can't get excited over that
[3:03:29] I don't know what you're going to do to
[3:03:31] the world it's crazy you're having a
[3:03:33] great time at church but to us it's
[3:03:40] glorious that's why he writes in
[3:03:42] Philippians 4 and6 be careful I'm
[3:03:46] popping be careful for nothing but in
[3:03:49] everything by prayer and supplication
[3:03:51] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[3:03:53] known of God okay you want another
[3:03:56] interpretation of that don't be anxious
[3:03:59] or worried on

[3:20:08] is Satan did that to
[3:20:10] Jesus right and he takes a scripture
[3:20:14] misplaces it gives it to the word
[3:20:17] himself and the word says it's also
[3:20:21] written Hall so a lot of people get this
[3:20:24] quote in their
[3:20:25] mind and then finally they come to you
[3:20:27] say you know what the prophet said on
[3:20:29] this but it's also
[3:20:32] written uhhuh that's what you got to get
[3:20:34] in the
[3:20:35] message that's why you got to get into
[3:20:38] Christ cuz if you don't know it how will

[3:33:15] [Music]
[3:33:30] all through last
[3:33:35] journey
[3:33:36] father to
[3:33:42] Lord I
[3:33:44] only I
[3:33:45] [Music]
[3:33:49] to be
[3:33:52] like
[3:33:55] amen
[3:33:57] amen you know this
[3:34:00] great Revelation and wisdom
[3:34:04] spoken you know God leads you from your
[3:34:08] heart he works from the inside
[3:34:12] out and I wonder this morning
[3:34:18] if maybe we've lost contact with our
[3:34:21] [Music]
[3:34:23] deep we've lost contact with that Holy
[3:34:27] unction inside of us when it tries to
[3:34:31] speak to us and tries to deal with us
[3:34:36] and and and and we know maybe we're not
[3:34:41] in the right attitude we know we're not
[3:34:43] going down the right Road and
[3:34:46] God's trying to speak to you he doesn't
[3:34:49] use your intellect he uses your
[3:34:53] heart and that's what he said God wants
[3:34:55] to be in the Throne of your heart yes
[3:34:59] that's what he wants to make contact
[3:35:01] with maybe you can play that little song
[3:35:04] called stay you know that song Stay that
[3:35:07] I I
[3:35:11] love we're not going to be long
[3:35:17] but I think that's what we really need
[3:35:19] is to come back in contact with our deep
[3:35:22] we can all stand
[3:35:27] together you know what makes this an
[3:35:29] individual Affair is each one of us has
[3:35:32] a
[3:35:35] deep each one of us has a place that he
[3:35:38] talks to
[3:35:41] us and
[3:35:43] that's what Satan's trying to cover
[3:35:48] up each and everyone that's in
[3:35:51] here has a soft
[3:35:54] spot in their
[3:35:57] heart that he's been reaching out
[3:36:01] to to
[3:36:04] touch that he can lead
[3:36:06] you he leads you by the
[3:36:09] Deep you say I want to be led of the
[3:36:12] Lord he's not going to lead you to your
[3:36:15] mind you'll mess it
[3:36:17] up but he touches that
[3:36:20] spot that he put in your
[3:36:27] heart and he begins to tug on
[3:36:32] it and if you'll listen to it and you'll
[3:36:37] let it pull you it'll lead you into
[3:36:41] Glory Grace
[3:36:44] forgiveness the
[3:36:46] an hope and eventually one day it'll
[3:36:49] lead you home
[3:36:53] yes and this whole
[3:36:56] world is Satan trying to keep you from
[3:36:59] making contact with
[3:37:03] that no matter how proud you
[3:37:07] are what you think you are
[3:37:19] thought and one
[3:37:21] day I didn't want to live
[3:37:27] anymore drugs had tore my mind
[3:37:32] up but praise God there was a
[3:37:36] predestinated deep oh
[3:37:41] yes and he reached down and he grabbed a
[3:37:43] hold of it
[3:37:46] and I know by the word of God that every
[3:37:49] person in here has that little deep
[3:37:53] spot that God
[3:37:57] touches and maybe fear has caused you
[3:38:01] to cover it up or maybe
[3:38:05] sin has got it covered
[3:38:09] up but that's what he wants this
[3:38:12] morning he's looking at us and said
[3:38:14] would you open back up the
[3:38:17] Deep so I can touch you that's right
[3:38:20] will you open back your heart so I can
[3:38:24] lead
[3:38:27] you and if you ever know what it's
[3:38:32] like to have them touch that
[3:38:36] spot and know it doesn't belong to
[3:38:38] anybody
[3:38:40] else it belongs to
[3:38:43] you and you know that it's it's it's
[3:38:47] it's for you and it's you
[3:38:52] him doesn't it doesn't matter it's
[3:38:56] mine I don't know why he chose me but he
[3:39:02] did and alls I want this morning is I
[3:39:06] want him to touch that deep again
[3:39:10] yes I want to be led from the inside
[3:39:13] again I want him to come close to me
[3:39:16] again you say well what about yesterday
[3:39:19] yesterday don't
[3:39:21] matter it's this
[3:39:24] morning maybe as we sing this
[3:39:28] song you and your own life with all your
[3:39:33] failures and all your mistakes would
[3:39:36] just turn your heart to him and say
[3:39:40] Lord awaken my deep
[3:39:46] Lord one more
[3:39:48] time just call my
[3:39:52] heart and and speak to me and call me
[3:39:56] and draw
[3:39:59] me
[3:40:01] hallu that's what it's all about it's me
[3:40:04] and
[3:40:06] you and your Prophet told me there was a
[3:40:10] deep in
[3:40:11] there and that that word would guide me
[3:40:16] and Lead Me into all
[3:40:18] truth and all
[3:40:20] righteousness so I ask you this morning
[3:40:23] do you know what it's
[3:40:26] like to be in the presence of the
[3:40:31] Lord and not to know what time it
[3:40:35] is because time Stood

[3:40:41] Deep would you renew your deep this

[3:40:48] we had a great healing
[3:40:51] service you'll get sick
[3:40:54] again wouldn't it be wonderful if the
[3:40:57] spirit rolled down and we shouted glory
[3:40:59] and praises to
[3:41:03] God that feeling will
[3:41:06] end but if you ever make contact with
[3:41:09] that
[3:41:11] deep that never goes away that's right
[3:41:15] it'll never leave you it'll never
[3:41:18] forsake you and no matter how far away
