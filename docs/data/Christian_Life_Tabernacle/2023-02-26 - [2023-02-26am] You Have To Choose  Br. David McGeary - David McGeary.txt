Description:
You Have To Choose
Br. David McGeary
February 26, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

invite by the microphone reading this morning amen good morning it was uh watching some little Clips this week in the news about maybe you heard about it but it's uh you know a Revival that's been going on at Asbury University you know it's been happening out in Kentucky and earlier this month it was you know what started out as a chapel service you know you had all of these a group of students that you know just spontaneously began to Worship the Lord and began a praise and worship service that lasted for two weeks non-stop two weeks of of praise from these college students sometimes fifteen thousand at a time you know and I watched as these young people would step out of this service you know speaking of how they had experienced the presence of the Lord how they had become lost in the worship how their lives had been changed you know for two weeks this revival was all the buzz in the Christian Community you know and finally after two weeks the university shut it down so everybody could get back to their studies and I was thinking about that you know on the surface that sounds like such a wonderful thing you know as they said surely the presence of the Lord must have been there in some capacity right I heard them use the scripture Psalm 22 3 which says the Lord it habits the praise of his people you know young people spontaneously worshiping the Lord but you know it's completely taken out of context the way that they use the verse and you know the one thing that was missing from that entire Revival was the word in spite of all the powerful services you know in spite of all the endless hours of praise and worship emotional intensity that may have occurred in those meetings the evidence of the presence of the Lord is his word and it was the one thing that could not be found through that entire Revival you know as an experience certainly there was some kind of presence there certainly you know something moved on the people's hearts but the image that resulted did not reflect the word no no doubt the worship felt very good it doesn't necessarily mean he was present or even pleased with what was happening there you know Revival is one of those words that get thrown around basically to mean everything from powerful worship services to alter calls and prayer lines to special meetings with compelling preachers and stirring messages but you know you can have all of those things without any Reviving actually going on sometimes it can even distract people from having a real Revival and you can experience your Revival without having any of that and many do you know the word revive is used only in the Old Testament the New Testament word is to Quicken the word means and they looked it up in the dictionary to live to have life to remain alive to sustain life to live prosperously to live forever to be quickened to be alive to be restored to life or health it's not about praising it's not about preaching it's about living not the activity or of a praise or worship service though we certainly enjoy those but it's the result of one coming and quickening life in you his life not your natural life it's to be quickened to that Eternal self-sustaining life which itself can impart life it's not the state of being constantly jump started but it's the state of being plugged in constantly to a never-ending source of power you know I was reading about that we're going to turn to Psalm 146 this morning there's an interesting statement that the scripture makes there starts out in verse 1 it says praise ye the Lord praise the Lord O my soul not my lips not my words not my voice but my soul while I live will I praise the Lord I will sing praises to the Lord while I have any being you know first Peter 2 9 says it this way but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light you know you look at something like that Revival at Asbury University or really any movement you know that makes Revival the act of having a powerful church service we miss what it means to offer the kind of Praise he's looking for the kind of Praise that truly demonstrates the presence of the Lord you know it isn't Revival because we praise loud enough or long enough or powerful enough in a church service Revival is an Awakening of a certain kind of life in US his life that causes us to praise him with our soul with our life by living and expressing his life while I live will I praise thee we praise him you know it's says in Romans 12 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice that's Revival the kind of Praise that is living the kind of Praise that is shown forth by making him known in our lives that which comes from the soul on Tuesday not from the lips on Sunday you know certainly we enjoy those High these times of getting together and worshiping and praising the Lord for he is certainly worthy of our praise you know but Revival is Awakening of a life of praise not having a church service of praise as it says in First Peter 2 5 ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable by Jesus Christ that word Lively means alive living to have life Living Praise not just singing Praise you know as it says in second Corinthians 3 2 that each of us are an epistle a letter a message a song read of all men while I live work if I have been revived am I praising him you know as we read Psalm 146 this morning we can go ahead and stand you know the question is while we live do we praise him do we praise him by our living does our soul Praise Him is our life a song of Praise written of him you know there's a people somewhere yeah and I believe they're in this room who know what it means to have been revived who have encountered who have encountered an awakener someone who has created some life in them caused something to rise up that they may be a life of praise want to know what Revival looks like it looks something like that let's go ahead and read Psalm 146 this morning it's just a short psalm praise ye the Lord praise the Lord O My Soul while I live will I praise the Lord I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help his breath goeth forth he returneth to his Earth in that very day his thoughts perish happy is he that hath the god of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God which made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth forever which executeth judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the Lord luceth the Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind the Lord raised them that are bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous the Lord preserveth The Strangers he relieveth the fatherless and Widow but the Way of the Wicked he turneth upside down the Lord shall reign forever even thy God o Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord r and God bless you have your seats I believe we can praise him this morning amen oh once like a bird and praise and I dwell oh and no freedom from my sorrow I fail oh and then Jesus came and listen to me to God save me foreign [Music] [Music]

May the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit we ask you to bless us this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen amen what a beautiful special that was this morning I just I looked over there and I saw I thought my that's beautiful amen I just appreciated it so very much I also very much enjoyed what uh brother Mike said this morning about the great Revival and what it was lacking I thought that was extremely beautifully put and well done this morning do you love the Lord this morning let's open our Bibles and trust that we can get our little thought across this morning um to you and it'll encourage you and increase your your understanding of the Lord we're going to read out of Joshua the 24th chapter of the Book of Joshua and uh the 14th verse I love the Book of Joshua um in fact one of my uh favorite uh scriptures in the Bible is found in in uh Joshua 1 and 9 and I remember I had that uh where they put that little I think it's not are you kind of needlepoint I think they caught I had that needle pointed on a plaque for me it says have not I commanded thee to be strong and of good courage and Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest amen and that would be my blessing to us this morning also God's with us oh well you know that that God's with us men and uh and we've we're definitely going to have to know that and be confident of that as we Forge forward in what God has for us remember Satan is not going to let it be an easy Road but he stands to resist and we'll talk about that this morning now this is Joshua speaking after the he's come to the end the land's been divided up and he begins to say these great words he says now therefore fear the lord amen the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom I remember in all things you do fear the lord in other words how is what that I'm doing how does it stand and does it meet the approval of God in his eyes amen therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord amen I want to kind of lay emphas here I'm put away the Gods and he tells you he says um and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose ye this day whom ye will serve whether the gods of your fathers and we have the gods of our fathers in this day so we've been studying out of that message whether the gods of your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwelt but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord God bless you this morning you may be seated and and we are uh we've been studying out of the God of this evil age and I want you to notice here that we understand as Bible Believers and one of the things that I think becomes a a real rich uh Revelation for us is that God always continues using the same pattern because he's an infinite God and so that means if he makes a choice he can't make a wrong choice he can't choose to do something and then come up with a better way to do it he he doesn't have to think over his decisions and his choices because he's the Fountain of all knowledge and so just by his very essence of what that is when he does something since he's the author and finisher of all things and he knows the beginning from the end when he does a pattern or he does something then he can stay with that all the way through and everything else you find in the scriptures will follow the same pattern so we understand that this is the uh the Book of Joshua is at the end of the first Exodus there was an exodus and we know that in the Old Testament all these things have been given to us and shadows in in types that by these shadows and types we might be able to look back and see the hand of God With God you can look back and see what that he's done and then be able to look forward and know what he's going to do and you can also know what he's doing because he's the same yesterday today and forever so we can look back at Exodus and we can see in the book of Exodus the what transpired the children of Egypt came out of bondage right they were led by task Masters because they left the land where that they would prosper and they went into a land which uh invited him in and we know the story of Joseph and and they became prosperous there and they were well but their rose up somebody that didn't know that pharaoh and then soon it'll be brought into they were brought into bondage and we know that Egypt is a type of the world so many times I've seen it that a Christian it seems like the world will offer them an opportunity and to prosper and they'll they'll they'll move somewhere or they'll take something or they'll change their hours and pretty soon that they're there and they're blessed and it looks like a blessing and it's not long pretty soon they've come into captivity into that job they no longer can go to church they they no longer can have Fellowship they no matter what they're getting paid they find themselves in financial battles they they're trying to keep up the pace and the pressure starts to set in on them and all of a sudden because the they they took the job is a blessing but that job didn't know the god that they sure that's right and so they they fall into bondage so we understand in this Exodus that the children of Israel had fallen into bondage and and they but by and by the very reasons of their taskbasters they begin to cry out to God you know uh it it was fine they didn't really as long as there was food on the table and they were making money and doing business you know it seems like God gets puts on the Shelf it always is it's terrible isn't it that man's always got to get desperate to before they call out for the Lord and you know backsliding is is is not a one-day affair it's it's a slow tedious process and you know that's what uh in the manufacturing industry and things like that they have something that they call periodical maintenance that you've got to go maintain things so you know you go you go add the lube you go change the belt you go do all these little things you know whether it's almost like whether they need it or not because you know if you don't keep it up the fatigue will eventually break it down and in our life we've got to understand that we've got to have a spiritual maintenance program going on you've got to you've got to spend the time you've got to take the time you know they've got to take the time to shut the machine down and check it out and do it and all that and and spend some time on it well you got to spend time on your spiritual life too you've got to say take some time and and shut it down and and sit back and grab your bible and say Lord speak to me not just not just read your Bible but say Lord I'm reading the Bible this morning with the intention of you speaking to my spirit uh to correct me or to show me something to to give me some Enlightenment this morning I I need and then you need to spend time of getting into the presence of the Lord uh just just letting his presence inviting his presence you know there's nothing sweeter than the presence of the Lord you can go a lot of time on Willpower and you can go a lot of time on your knowledge but you've you pretty soon you you know what's truth but you don't feel the joy of the Lord and the presence of the Lord you got to take time to to set aside time just for the presence of the Lord just just stop and invite the presence of the Lord and and just tell you feel his presence and then you start thinking of what he's done for you and how good he has been to you all that you have and how he's preserved you and that's good but then you start thinking about where he's taking you oh my he's taken me to a land beyond the river he's taken to me where there's no death no sickness no pain he's taking me a place where I'll have life Everlasting and always we start looking through that gas glass darkening you know what you'll find out is is the things the light begins to shine things aren't dark anymore your spirit's lifted up you're refreshed and you you've got you've got to spend that time to do a spiritual uh a a maintenance or or you know things will break down and so we find out here that this Exodus was a natural Exodus from a natural land and so we we understand that in our day Egypt typed the world the coming out of the world and they left a land of bondage of sin and and of task Masters and a grueling uh uh just a grueling lifestyle and God sent them a deliverer and they were delivered out of the land and then they ended up in the land of promise and so they made that place but what I wanted to point out this morning it for our understanding this morning for to let us understand that where we are Joshua sat all the people down and said to him he said you are going to have to choose right look and and uh so that was a characteristic or a typed of of the people being brought out being brought out wasn't the final decision or the end of it what the broading bringing out did for them or what it did it placed them in the in the place of choice now you have going you are he's looking out at the children of Egypt and and Joshua being the great uh Prophet that he was he said no children of Israel here you are in this land but you are going to have to choose whom you're going to serve and if you follow the history of the children of Israel what do you find out there was many times that they they failed to choose the Lord and they chose something else if every time that they chose something else they found themselves in a very desperate Place God pressing them to get back to him and had calling to him repent and return to the god of your father so we can look back at that Exodus and we can truly see in the word of God that we are now in an exodus we understand the Exodus of coming out from law to Grace where the baptism of the Holy Spirit came in the spirit of the Lord now let the price for sin was paid now man could enter into fellowship and that Spirit could come dwell within man because there was a blood sacrifice paid for them that made them righteous now that's a beautiful thing about Calvary to me Calvary is a daily invitation to the believer to come have fellowship with God it's an open door for Fellowship there's a the blood that was was spilled at Calvary it it was typed in the first Exodus as being placed on the doorpost right the little post that if you came in through that door that had the blood on it on the other side there was safety and peace and it's the same thing if you find yourself on the outside of that door the angel of death it is going but that door is still there as an entrance into peace and safety you say how do you go through that door it's so simple you walk to that door you confess your sins and then you step through that blood into the door of the life and peace of the Lamb and what did they do in there they ate the lamb right a type of the word they got in there and they Fellowship around the evening meal oh what is this come unto you and behold thy stand at the door knock anyone opens I'll come in and sup with them and he with me and you'll sit down and we'll have the evening meal okay okay it's beautiful uh where it is that we set today in our hour so we we saw that this great Exodus and The Exodus from the law into Grace and into the leadership of the Holy Spirit and and in every age there was a choice so now we have come down to our Exodus all everyone I could go through many more types because you can look at the first Exodus and you'll see the pattern what did he do he gathered the children together is that right what did he do on this the next as he gathered them together in the upper room didn't he it's okay it's always that and what has he done this morning he's gathered his pride together we know that right it's a United time and sign he's Gathering his bride together he's gathered his bride together because he's preparing her for an exodus but also at the same time she has got to understand that she has to choose right it wouldn't it would be unfair to the children if he said choose this day whom you'll serve in the days of the Gospel going forward if those people had to make a choice just like Paul on the mountain of Mars he went up there and he said oh I see you got all these Gods you worship let me tell you about a God he said you calm the unknown God but I know him and this is the only true God whom you must serve see they had to choose they had to choose and we are also so now we've been studying this sermon the God of this evil age and we've watched our Prophet expressed to us and show us that there that he is the God of this evil age it's the only age that he was ever called the god of and he is a god of uh that he is uh he he's he's just a god of civilization and education we know that in the garden that what he offered Eve he offered her civilization and and education and knowledge and he he did all these things he's presenting now we are presented with all those things in this hour in a great maturity and so we understood as we study this and as we went through it we we begin to understand that uh if I can just I'd like to maybe just read a few things to us so we can get the picture is that Satan that all of us have in Avenues right and so we we understand that that that there's uh we're made up out of five outward census and and in inward censuses of emotions and and uh reasoning and thinking and all all these great elements that were made out of and we know that those are the Avenues by which Satan approaches people not just you all people out there today have not come to conclusions by themselves and that means so as I read this I just would like you to say to understand this he said he says but he said the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses or five senses rather the Inside Man is the spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience love and so forth these this outside man see taste here and smell so here you are right hear this being you've got these Insight senses you've got these outside senses and and and so that's uh that that's what it it it's con it's controlled by he says and you cannot he said you cannot accept what the devil says or accept what God says that's all determined by what spirit is in there and and so we we begin to see that what happens is is that there is a that in this inward man and this Spirit man that you are this man is placed in it in a a position where they going to have to make a choice whether or not you're going to listen to the outward census the emotional senses or you're going to listen to that Spirit word that's in you Malco I and so as we talk about this just for a moment he says he says uh because we want to place this in this understanding of choosing you've got to understand what's being presented what's the choice that's being presented to you because we know that there's there's two opposing spirits in the world today at work there's two opposing spirits at work there's the spirit of Satan and the spirit of God so let's understand that this morning let's just don't let that slip away you are in a battle there's a war going on there's two spirits two opposing spirits you have the spirit of the God of this evil age who is trying to build the kingdom that places him up upon the throne to be worshiped and we know that this is the age that he takes his place on that throne and he's worshiped by millions and billions of people and you say well I'm not worshiping saying they don't know it because they're worshiping him through what his kingdoms made out of Science Education knowledge and smart scientific so they're worshiping him by their choice of what it is that they choose there's two choices the word of God or the tree of knowledge the mixed tree of Good and Evil that's the choices that are they every day there's there there's a a decision so these two spirits that they're they and you got to remember these two Spirits are working and these two Spirits are up opposite they are opposing one another they're they're opposing one another Satan is fighting the word of God he and and look at us today and because I want you to understand this Satan is throwing everything he's got you never he's pulling out all the stops today everything he can come up with everything for the census everything for the emotions everything he can throw at you this it's come down to the wire the battle song he's fighting he he's fighting to take control there's two opposing Spirits fighting to take control now it looks like he's winning huh I like Satan he's so dumb he don't know the word of God he's not going to win amen because God's got a people here but come back we we don't want to be ignorant because if we understand that where where we are now we are actually in a time where these two opposing Spirits are at battle they're at War and we know where that battle is taking place don't we in other words we know that the the battle is taking place in the the the minds of the believer or in the minds of the people and we know what the battle is so he's throwing everything he's got the God of this evil age is throwing everything he's got at the believer everything scientific everything knowledge smart educated everything that he can throw against the believer to disprove God's word so if you if you're at a if you're opposing something and you're at battle with something then the the the the purpose of a war is to overcome and to take rule over I know we got a war going on in Europe or one country wants to take over the other country and the other country is resisting but this country wants to take care of it and they're battling and it's going on and you sit back well and you try to uh make sense out of it all which a Believer really can't except for by one thing there shall be wars and rumors of wars it's an Evidence to the believer that we are in an exodus and these two Spirits are opposing one another and we are placed in the place of making a choice thank you see you can't leave that part out if if if it sat still another if it was too uh I guess they call are these called inanimate objects or adamant objects they're in adamant and all right I didn't know that I thought they would be adamant right because something that in other words if you only had a choice of two set things that weren't moving in other words this remained the same all the time and this remained all the same and all you had to do was make a choice of drinking this or drinking that or using this or using that that choice would be simple and it could be made one time you understand I've already made the choice you know what I mean I know what kind of soap I use you know what I mean well you know I use what's ever on sale uh you know but some people they use dial and some people use Dove and some people use Ivory you know what I mean and some use Liquid and some use that you know uh if you go into some showers it's like a garden in there they got cucumber this and carrot that and all kinds of different flavors of soap but what I'm saying is if if it was just as simple of choosing an inanimate object that didn't change but you've got to understand Satan didn't come that way he came in the spirit of deception so he's always changing his face to present that his Spirit to you in a way he keeps making it look more beautiful and more beautiful and more reasonable and more understanding because that what he's he's after he's after that he can rule over you that was his whole purpose he exalted himself above the stars of God that he might sit on the throne as if he is God and to rule over the Sons and Daughters of God so it's not a one-time proposition from Satan he's continually appearing as an angel of Light he don't stop he's like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour so this opposing spirit because it is an opposing Spirit it is opposing you oh wouldn't it be simple if we could just say today I'm a Christian I accept Jesus Christ of my Lord and my savior I've made my choice wouldn't that be good but they're great writers call our forefathers two who have had the faith or the revelation of which that we are promised to once again obtain and have it restored us they looked at that and they said no church Satan will appear as an angel of Light he's not going to come as a devil remember we read that he said if he would have done that Eve would have never fell for it but the way that he works he keeps he he doesn't stop coming he doesn't he's still today this morning this afternoon tomorrow he's still going to present a choice that's why you'll hear me get on communion and try to encourage you to come to communion because after that's one of the ordinances that God requires of his church he doesn't require very many things as far as ordinances go but baptism communion in foot washing are the three physical ordinances that God requires of the believer Satan knows that ask me in the church why communion night is always the weakest night now you I don't know all your mind battles but I guarantee you at Communion times comes a lot of people are talked out of it not knowing what is transpiring Satan knows you've got to make a choice he knows you've got to say I gotta take communion it's an ordinance he says no I know if I I Bill I'm going to stop I'm going to do everything I can to stop them from doing it yeah I'll tell you he's good anything that can appear as an angel of Light is good good at what he does Satan is a good liar in fact I will give him credit for that he is a liar he's the father of all lies and there's no truth in them amen if you want to know what his placard is he's the president of lies he's the chief executive of Lies that's all he can do is lie he's a liar and there's no truth in him so you've got to understand every time that there comes an hour of decision he is there with a lie but it doesn't appear as a lie it appears as light it appears as understanding it appears as those things and like we we read before has God lost control or is he just permitting another agent to control I wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion there are two opposing spirits in the world at work two opposing spirits in the world today at work now there can't be no more than two two heads one of them is the holy spirit at work the other one is the spirit of the devil and in the last days in deception so Satan's Spirit at work today is deception so it it isn't just a a real obvious choice it's a deception on the outside it looks like an angel on the outside it looks good because remember it's a mixed tree of what good and evil in other words it's like an Eminem you know what I mean it's you know in it coded on the outside you know I I they used to have a saying it melts in your mouth not in your hand well that's fine as long as you take it out of the package and put your mouth but I kept them in my hand for a long time and all of my hands turned was yellow and blue and every eye you know just a it's just a deception like the dish soap it was a deception so if it's poison wrapped in a candy shell wrapper of religion you know what I mean and it it on the outside it appears good you know what I mean it appears what's the word reasonable see if that's what Kayden does he tries to get us to lean to our own understanding where do we derive our understanding from we derive our understanding from the information that's fed to us through our five senses in our five inward feelings we take that information and we draw a conclusion from that information and that gives us our understanding and we say I understand it to believe this way or this is what I understand look you understand that's what he's the the master of presenting facts to you to drawing a picture to you to making a a a an offer to you that looks good it looks religious it looks spiritual it looks like it's the right thing but down underneath it it's not the word like our brother said this morning it was a great emotional outpouring of worshiping look if you if you've seen the word and you understand the word I've I've watched Services of pagans where they worship and pretty soon they're jumping this high off of the ground they're almost in a trance they get caught up in the spirit that anointing falls on the just and the unjust it's the same reign as our brothers so beautifully Express if it falls on the just in the end just when the rain falls on the kuckleber the kuckleberry goes praise God and worships and thanks God for the rain because God will pour the rain out on everybody [Music] nobody's going to go up there and say Lord we didn't get the rain they're going to go up there and say Lord we did this and we did that and we did this and we did that and he's going to say depart from me you doers of iniquity because I never knew you that's a kind of deception that we're dealing with oh I I don't want you to get numb and come under spiritual amnesia and be anemic which are all descriptions that the prophet of God is for the church I don't want you to become lukewarm I don't want to become lukewarm God I don't want to sit back and think that this is over that's getting to be our attitude sometimes within the framework of the message we're the elect it's over you better not fall for that one second church I'm not responsible for the other churches I am responsible for what I say to this congregation Satan is still deceiving and he'll deceive the very elective it's possible and you can take the permissive will of God which you'll pay for and he'll bring you back around but I want to mature past that don't you I want to come to work that I'm built up in the Statue of a perfect man that I'm I'm able to have strong meat I'm able to look at this life situations and the decisions that are set before me uh through the word of God because it is chaos now he tries to offer you so many choices so many opinion options so many sides to take we got one side to take we take sides with Jesus we take sides with his word I don't care about the social injustice in Alabama the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is just the good for everybody that lives in Alabama as everybody that lives in Montana that's why I tell you all the time I know somebody told me one time they said well you don't know very much about Congolese I know more about Congolese than most Congolese know they were born in sin shaped into iniquity and came into the world speaking lies that's right and Jesus Christ is the way the truth the life and no man comes unto the father but by him and the story no culture gives any man the right not to follow the word of God [Music] and I've seen people from all Races all cultures all background come into subjections in this message and we have the same Spirit the same mind the same actions the same life the same power the same result the same Grace the same Mercy the same healings The Same Spirit for by one Spirit we are baptized into one body [Applause] that's just a big old lying Spirit of reasoning guys Jimmy we have our ways of doing things I said yeah and they're wrong take your way lean to your own understanding what he got Satan got him to do what he's trying to do today lean to your own understanding the scripture tells us Lee not to your own understanding away seemeth right unto a man but the end of that way is death remember what I'm trying to say this morning the choosing isn't over he's coming every day and that battle goes on in your mind God says his word Satan comes with his knowledge to disprove it his education to disprove it he comes with everything I've seen people with water baptism how are you been baptized well I was baptize the name of the father son Holy Ghost well let me show you in the Bible That's not that's not right and when now they have to choose whether they're going to be re-baptized or not oh here it comes my heart was right when I got baptized this way I had given my life to Christ and he came into me so what do you do you go over to the scripture and says these are believers they gave their life to Christ and Paul come and asked him he said have you received the Holy Ghost next question was how were you baptized what was Paul doing Paul was going back to the formula because God doesn't change there's no reasoning with God you don't have an understanding when it comes to God there's only two things you can do with God is obey it or disobey right so there's only two children the children of obedience and the children of disobedience you can only be one or the other either you're disobeying God's word or you're obeying what God's word what is lukewarm it's the mixture of hot and cold he said I would either you be hot or cold but if you're lukewarm I'll spill the out of my mouth he says no man can serve two masters you can't serve Disobedience and serve obedience at the same time can't do it you've got to choose these two opposing spirits are forcing a choice they'll be forced to take the mark of the beast you can't you you can't live in the middle the middle is disappearing the world is pulling away from you elect lady the world is heading up into a great Council of churches the world is heading up into a one-world government with the Antichrist spirit what does Antichrist mean anti-anointed word not anti-bible not anti-scriptures anti-anointed word Christ means anointing the anointed word for the hour let me just finish reading this too great opposing spirits the two Spirits one of them's God's holy spirit the other one is the devil Spirit working in deception the people of Earth are now making their choice so if if it wasn't an option you you don't have the option of whether you make a choice or not no choice is is the wrong choice no choice is a choice in itself that's right it's that simple if we don't catch what's going on if you don't see the God of this evil age heading up throwing everything he's got at you to deceive you everything he gets at you to get you off of The Exodus course everything he's got to get your mind some other place than stayed on him look up for your Redemption draws nigh and he can get your eyes out of the heavens and on this Earth he's trying to do that by offering you everything he's got out there everything you can to reason with everything you can do use your own understanding everything he can to disprove the word of God you say that's not true Peter was fighting it in his day where is the signs of his coming all things remain the same and you know Peter's response the days coming this place is going to burn up but let's just read a few statements and we'll close to this morning because my point is the people of the Earth are now making their choice you this morning you are making a choice he says the spirit of God is growed up into the full statue of God in the age that we're now living the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos so we see we've got two groups of people the children of obedience and the children of Disobedience right now listen what he says this is in the God of this evil age because what prophet of God's teaching he's showing us what the God of this evil age has presented to the people to choose he's given them religion in any taste they want it Baptist taste Methodist taste would you like to have a method of smoke would you like to have Methodist cancer or would you like to have Menthol cancer would you like to have Holy Ghost UPC cancer Assembly of God cancer what spiritual cancer do you want what denominational spiritual cancer flavor do you want oh I'll take this flavor God's so good he would never judge this person no he's not he's not going to judge anybody Jesus isn't going to judge anybody he said I'll not judge the world my word will judge what is the Judgment did you choose to be obedient to the word or did you choose Satan's reasoning or did you lean to your own understanding did you come up with your own moral code your own moral choice your own righteousness and that's what you take it's a choice and that's what he said he said this is choosing day either live for today or die choose God and live and God is the word and the word is and the word is the word manifested for the hour and the day oh I'm just going to choose Paul's gospel it's not the choice the choice isn't this Bible this Choice isn't man's interpretation of the Bible that's not the choice the choice is in Jesus Christ 2 000 years ago at Calvary that's not the choice that God's offered God's offered them one choice to believe the Vindicated word of God when the same pillar fire and the same Cloud appeared proving that they're leading a children in an exodus or a great big porridge pot with all kinds of flavors thrown in it isn't a choice our choice he gave this what to choose God provided away he provided his choice which is his Vindicated word for the hour God presented his message to the children of this Exodus the ones that he called he did he called we think oh I'm called diverted he's called you to make the choice that's what your calling is he called you and gave you and put you in a position and said you got to choose the word we go and bypass the fruits of it we claim to be elected and then live contrary to the word or I could give a Litany of things that are done that's contrary to the word you understand what's happening is Satan is branding his children you know how you brand the cattle to show that this is my cattle they they take a uh like it might be called 3K Ranch so they'll have three K's all in a row I probably shouldn't have said KKK right I'm sure somebody's going to misinterpret that and and and this this message won't be able to go on YouTube so you better hear it well it's here so it's triple V Ranch and they they brand that cattle they they say this is my cloud well Satan is branding hidden too you sisters I talk to you about these tight dresses they're the brand of Satan it don't matter if you walk into this shirt can you look at that like say that's the Hoffman's head of Christ that's the cloud that appeared at the Seven Seals that's the pillar of fire it don't care you're wearing his brand he's got his mark on you high heels I can preach at high heels I got so frustrated the other day I was gonna go get some shoes and put them in the foyer with the big sign says these are high heels now I would prefer that you pray about it and the Holy Spirit would convict you and you would get rid of them not by the law but by grace but sometimes the law has got to be applied in order for there to be an understanding of sin that's what the law was for you can't kill you can't steal you can't commit adultery you can't lust after their husband's wife I mean you can say it and I can preach it but this has ought to be the last place tight dresses and high heels come from you sisters you mothers the Bible tells you to teach the younger children I'm just going to start going up and saying TT too tight you see me look after over at you and go that's TT h too high if you look at me and I look at you and I go that means they're too high you know how particular the prophet of God was when they were building his house if they brought a radio on there he said turn that stuff off or get off the job now I'm sure he didn't say it like that I'm sure he walked up in the presence of God they are immediately under conviction and he probably just looked at him so sweet and said would you mind turning that music off and they ran to that dial as quick as they could and grab that thing and threw it in their truck because whatever he was packing they didn't want to mess with no but why play Church you let the Elder sisters teach the younger is that Timothy we follow the Bible here right within our object the revealed word of God for the hour start taking care of it you young sisters talk to one another don't let these things creep in I pulled up the other day to a stop sign and there was a a lady next to me and you know and I looking over the light and I caught her I thought she was trying to poke something in her mind and I I didn't know if I should jump up and help her and then pretty soon I realized she had this stick and she was going and then she I thought what are you doing foreign I just wish I was behind her I wanted to Hawk my hornet I mean it's crazy what is that a sign of it's a sign of Jezebel do you understand that lady unspin knowing to herself she's paying her face like Jezebel she's doing the best she can to present herself to somebody as beautiful the beauty of a Christian woman is her character I know that's ABC's but the God of this evil age is one of the basic ABC books you'll ever read and I recommend it so we understand that this is definitely choosing time that that it's it's come down to the time that that the proof of the seed is the choice that it makes and I thought you know how when the prophet of God preaches there's all these things he says that you can't believe he was saying them in the 50s what's he trying to tell us he wants us to know recognizing the day and its message you've got to recognize we've got to all of us have got to recognize what's going on and where we're at and what it is that God's watching us he's watching what are you doing what are you choosing what are you accepting Satan is always trying to deceive you he's always trying to trick you he's always trying to get you to receive him and take his knowledge take his wisdom he doesn't stop day in and day out he's after you he's trying to get you whether it's with some sweet talking lover boy or whether it's with job whether it's with a card doesn't matter what it is he is everywhere and we've got to be understand that we've got to get branded too our brand is the word of God our brand is the amen the word of God this is what God's looking for he's looking for a people that chooses word that's why Paul told Timothy study to show yourself approved that you might instruct I wish it wasn't the way it is I wish I could preach something else I could reach I could preach about the power of God and everybody being slayed in the spirit and and and great works being done which I believe will do those things if the Lord permit but let us move on to perfection and I believe that what's going to give the believer its power is its ability to make a conscious choice for the word the recognizing of the two spirits in the framework of the church with standing the one and the choosing of the other is what makes them an invincible Army where they can walk up and know they've chosen the word of God without any emotion because there's something inside of them that said this word is true amen not part of it not the part you like but all of it all of it every bit of it and not looking back leaving those things which are behind behind pressing for a higher calling every person in this building this morning has the right to put their sins under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ not look back again and start pressing for a higher calling to obey God's word you can't drive looking back but you can drive going forward that's what he said he says it's choosing time and then I'll this is beautiful and I'll read this in closing brother Mike if you want to put it up on the board it starts in a paragraph 158. so we we've been we've been watching this unfold how Satan built his kingdom how he's offered the world Science Education smart civilization technology he's offered him what he called a better world to live the prophet of God's he offered him a better world the sin in he's offered a medicine he's offered them hospitals he's offered him everything he can this great big beautiful Eden and that's what he's presenting now he's presenting his Eden this is my accomplishment this is my world we're sending people to the Moon okay you can you can just ask this ask my secretary sister Google whatever you want it she'll give you an answer does anybody believe that that thing lies you could ask it what's playing at Cinema Mark 21 now if she told the truth she'd say you don't want to go there there's nothing but a bunch of devil spirits that are going to possess your thinking let me be Google for a day what's this other lady's name Lexus that's the biggest gospel in the world you say something she listens and she passes it right on is it ever Dawn on you that that is a deception of Satan civilization is of the devil Prophet God said I'm going to get a lot of letters on that it's of the devil it's all meant to influence your choice it all meant to provide you reasoning and other ways of thinking and to try to draw conclusions the whole thing of Satan is to get you to lean to your own understanding the prophet God said they don't need faith because they have knowledge they make their choices based on knowledge not based on conviction not based on leadership of the Holy Spirit they make a way for themselves he provides it in any flavor you want and you're the cult you're the man follower you're the one that don't believe in Jesus you're the one that don't follow the Bible because you recognize the Vindicated fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7 you recognize Jesus Christ in this generation when he was veiled in flesh and you said that's the Lord hidden a man bringing us the true word of God to get us out of this chaos and that's a reproach we're going to have to bear our choice will bring reproach our choice will bring criticism if you don't think the world he doesn't try to bring you in fear people say you better be careful of what you say wait a minute my Bible said be careful for nothing you can't preach against homosexuality homosexuality is of the devil Lexus homosexuality is of the devil YouTube homosexuality is of the devil Romans tells us that it's the product of a reprobate mind not wishing to retain God in their knowledge working that which which is unseemingly man with man woman with women doing that which is not natural now let me play the other part of that Lexus it is a spirit that can be cast off let me pay the other part of that Google it is a demon that can be cast out let me say how Paul summed it up I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the power of God unto salvation [Applause] you got to choose he said if it seems evil to you now think of that think of that from I want the spirit I want if the Holy Spirit would help us he said if you think it's evil to serve the god and today people think it's evil that I'd preach the gospel in its fullness it's evil the Bible says come out from amongst them and be separate and what's their word inclusion include everybody oh you've got to let you've got to let them come and sit in your church no I don't I've asked a lot of people to leave the church repent or leave I didn't do it the way Peter did it you liar why do you try to deceive the Holy Spirit take this person out and bury him oh did you know the prophet God said the days of ananias and Sapphire we come to the church again they think it's evil they think by making a stand for the gospel you're evil and people are now looking at it they're listening to all Satan's reasoning all his lovey-dovey lies all his flavors he's got to offer all his religious Kingdom providing a better way to worship and a better way to do this and so sweet and skilled and knowledge and and just so tempered it won't hurt anybody's feelings and full of psychology and all that stuff which the end thereof is hell and and Satan's made it evil so that's what he said if you think it's evil to follow this message go back to the God of this evil age he will receive you with open arms but if you don't want to serve him and you want to serve the Living God Come As You Are he'll receive you in whatever state you're in whatever sins you have whatever mistakes you made he'll receive you come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest he's here here to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above whatever we could even ask or think or choose but choose ye this day whom you're going to serve you've got to choose you can't remain lukewarm you've got it's come to the time you've got to sell out to this message of the hour a hundred percent you can't keep listening to the deceptor and reasoning with them he'll just change the LIE [Music] he'll just change the deception he'll keep changing and changing and changing till you perceive him as an angel of Light and then you call that truth and that's an Abomination to God and that's what he's doing and we're not taking it serious and that's what he said worship God in sincerity and in truth amen what did Joshua speak these words at that Exodus because Satan didn't change and God didn't change and we're in an exodus and Satan is doing the same exact thing and the word of God's the same to us choose this day whom you will serve and I was going to read this now notice Christ's bride 158 is heading up also we see where the Antichrist is heading paragraph 158 God of this evil age where the Antichrist is heading bringing back there and now coming to a head the echamental council will put it to an ecclesiastic head and and you know what he said that religious and political world will join us on he said and the little church that's come along also Christ's word bride down Through the Ages is coming to a head because she's going to be United back to its mate always just like the church and everything else it's got to unite it's got to unite the middle ground is coming to an end lukewarmness is coming to the end they're Satan marks his Church and Satan marks his church is coming to an end the wheat everything else has come right back right back to its head where it started from like Cain and Abel word bride heading up in the person of the word of God made manifest in this evil age that we're living in see where it's heading up you see your Choi I want to go with the head up of the Bride and Satan will soon take his intellectual bride and exalt his great one which is the Antichrist the hierarchy and set him upon a throne and the whole world will wander after him and then Christ will come the two cannot exist in the same time and his kingdom will be taken and he'll be destroyed Hallelujah I like that part I want to read that again amen amen hey amen yeah and he'll be taken and he'll be destroyed yep the two can exist at the same time his kingdom will be taken and he'll be destroyed and Christ the word of God which the woman is part of the man's body they're not to they're one and the bride Church word a people called out from here and there for his namesake will unite into the body of Jesus Christ you understand what we're doing we're uniting into that body of Jesus Christ you've got to choose what body am I going to be a part of May I drop this in that's why the token is given as a house cleaner go start applying the token if they don't get their tokens approval throw it out and the kingdom of the Antichrist will be taken and destroyed and Christ shall take the throne and set upon the throne of his father David and Reign upon the earth a thousand years then the present then the present the Church of God without spot or blemish now notice her long hair Nazarite vow to the word it'll it'll picture the bride of Christ now we picture the Antichrist where is she religious in everything sincere now the humble little bride of Christ just simply believes the word whosoever she is it's individual by hope and trust that these many setting present many listening in and I hope that myself and every one of you all are part of that bride I hope many and it will be all that's been ordained to that will be that because it's their nature they see the word can only recognize the word it cannot recognize a denomination or a perversion it knows better it's the word it can't recognize nothing what is sin or iniquity to know better and not to do it and I believe this is a call to many of us to quit being lukewarm her long hair Nazarite vow shows that she is vowed to God her beautiful gown of his promised word for that age she is living in wrapped around her vindicating her with him of Hebrews 13 8 Jesus the same yesterday today and forever as she is a part of the word groom true to him in every point you see how he's marking his bride you see how Satan's marking this right and I'll just read it um in I'm going to read this because prophet of God said it and I don't need to make a lot of explanations you know he preached marriage and divorce we know there's forgiveness for sins we know marriages can be restored but this is what he says he says now look if a woman goes out here and is married to a man and she goes out and makes love with another man and has an affair with him and comes back to her husband he should kick her out is that right she must be true to him because she's vowed to him and the and the bride of Christ is vowed to Christ and he is the word not even wink at the other side a woman should not even wink at another man she should make no signs no emotions at all towards him for she is absolutely a bride to the one bridegroom see that's what happens when you get out of Christ you start winking at the world you start showing emotion to the world now we're sinners but we're saved by grace so I if you've been guilty of those things we're not throwing you out just like Jesus said in the beginning it wasn't so but we're Gentiles we came out of Gentile backgrounds many people were in church and in religion even following this message without the baptism of the Holy Spirit therefore they had nothing to keep them from following the flesh because intellectual knowledge will not keep you but if you let the spirit of God come into your heart the scripture says he cleanses you from all unrighteousness and we become new creatures in Christ Jesus Justified as we've never did it in the first place so don't leave that part out he said yeah she is absolutely a bride to one groom we don't want we don't want none of your mixed tree your denominations but true to Christ the word he'll vindicate it to be true no sir not even an emotion of anything towards making love to him not join his ranks or nothing else or let him get in you let him get you in his arms or in his care or talk to you over this way or that way don't even get in his care your job's not what's taking care of you your bank accounts not what's taking care of you if God don't watch the city The Watchman watches in vain you listen only to One Voice my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not what is his voice any man's voice is his word and that and this is it the Bible not one word to be added to it or taken from it just stay right with that voice a stranger they will not follow a denomination as she is part of the groom true to him in every point waiting the wedding United not at the economical Council but in the sky at the wedding supper she has been given this is for our own church she has been given and revealed to her the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible that's your wedding band that was your engagement isn't that beautiful she has been given and revealed to her the seven sealed Mysteries of the Bible she sees the folly of the deceiver so very close to the truth that almost deceived the elect she sees it see the two opposing Spirits at work in this evil age can you see it each very religious Cain and Abel Spirits again coming to their heads still the same as they started one worship by Beauty and by knowledge and by education and by science and by ethics and the other one by faith of the revelation of the word of God both of them standing right in this building this morning that's right Revelation or faith in his word makes no claims of the knowledge the real true Christian how many wants to be a real true Christian it's choosing time and I I hope I said that this morning with no condemnation in my heart towards anybody because I can say like Paul as the chiefest of sinners and there is no sin that is not covered by the blood of Jesus Christ but he also said go and sin no more [Music] and leave those things which are behind behind impress for a higher calling but let's don't fool ourselves that we're not in a battle it's individual if you have a problem maybe it may be temper is your problem maybe you have a short fuse I know what that's like God delivered me from temper to the point of insanity I I didn't realize how many things I needed Deliverance from but the scripture says he delivereth us out of them all so I encourage you this morning when you leave here that you become fully conscious that you've got to take control of the choices in your life and be conscious and I'll tell you when you choose him there's a fountain of joy that bubbles up inside of you when you know you've done the right thing it's so beautiful when you do the right thing I like this story I'll say it in closing at the musicians would come it's a story that came out of the town that I grew up in in San Diego um in downtown San Diego there's a church it was called Cathedral and there is a paper boy that had a paper route and if you've been to San Diego the airport sits at the bottom and then these Hills go up in town and the church sat up on one of the hills and the paper boy would do his route and as he'd come down the hill heal it throw his bike on the sidewalk and run into the chapel and he would kneel down and the priest would be in his little box saying confession and people are lighting candles and he would just run in and and you can play some Lori if you feel he would run in and kneel down and say Jesus this is Jimmy Jesus this is Jimmy Jesus this is Jimmy and he'd run out and get on his bike and finish his route and he did that every day and finally the priest just couldn't take it anymore for Jimmy he heard the bike slam up against the side of the church where it fell on the sidewalk with its paper bags across the back many of you may be too young to remember that and he ran into the Altar and said Jimmy this is Jesus and when he stood up the priest was standing there and he said Jimmy [Music] don't you have anything else to say or isn't there another place you can go and Jim he put his head down and kind of deflated and he got on his bike and started down the street and mined on what the priest said he didn't watch when he crossed the street and he was struck by a car they rushed him to the hospital [Music] and they were in the hospital and maybe not a religious family but they called the family together and they called the priest in and they called everybody there and they didn't give Jimmy much hope but in the midst of it all all of a sudden they felt something in the room and they felt the presence and they heard a voice and the voice said Jimmy this is Jesus Jimmy this is Jesus Jimmy this is Jesus this morning would you say Jesus this is me let us Stand Together [Music] if you'll say Jesus it's me just the way I am all my mistakes [Music] all my confusion all my history all my failures but I'm standing here this morning saying Lord I want to choose you [Music] I want to rededicate myself this morning to your word us I want to go back home and take the Bible and take the Vindicated message of this hour and go through my house and apply it I want to go to my closet and throw out
