nothing can pluck them out we trust that this evening in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God richly bless you just have your seeds for a moment and and uh the this evening we uh just have felt led to uh play an hour of the message called rejected King and uh you know there's some wonderful things but the theme of rejected King is they rejected the leadership that God provided and I think that's a great question that we need to always asking ourselves what's influencing us what's leading us what's causing us to make our decisions and uh and I like what the prophet of God and he made this statement he said in the day of Samuel the people were a great deal like they are in all the days they had come to the place that they wanted to be like other people and that's just the simple a nature with people people want to impersonate each other just think uh that's just our nature you know so we just want to be careful I'd like to read another statement he said we'll listen to it in a second and here comes somebody along saying Jesus is coming on a white cloud no he's coming on a white horse all right we'll just separate we'll get me a group and we're gonna get you a group there you are what difference does it make he's coming anyhow it don't matter how he comes the thing of it is are you ready to go with him when he comes that's the main thing doesn't matter how he comes what form he comes in let's just be ready to go but they'll split hairs on little bitty things and form other another organizations that's just the way the world did it and I remember the brothers they always talk when we have meetings especially amongst my trustee Brothers they'll always say let's keep the main thing the main thing you know let's don't get tracked off let's keep the main thing the main thing for us is we have a guide we have some the word of God that's come to guide us to get us to that coming of the Lord and that rapture and if we'll keep that the main thing and not stray from that so I just didn't want us to go too long without listening to our messenger because when we listen to our messenger we pick up just a lot more than the teachings we pick up the right attitude we pick up the spirit of the word of God there's lots of way the word of God influences us so tonight if we're going to listen to an hour of rejected Kings uh if you have one at your device devices I never like the word device you know because it just sounds divisive you know what I mean but uh so I know you can listen on your phone you can watch on the board uh there's different ways to go but uh we're gonna start by reading uh prophet of God's going to start by reading to us uh first Samuel the seventh chapter no no the eighth chapter and begin with the fourth verse first Samuel 8th chapter beginning with the fourth verse let us read so let us stand as we prepare to listen uh this is one of those messages that is full of little nuggets you know what the world might call one-liners or or just thoughts that are thrown out there but the it's it's to bring us back and and just remember if you're away tonight he wants to bring you back if you've got cold towards the message and the word of God he wants to bring you back and you all have a predestinated identity with the message of the hour you've been equipped to hear it my sheep hear my voice so let us enjoy tonight this portion as as we listen if you have your device we're starting in the 20th uh paragraph 20 and we're going to go through paragraph 85 I believe it's just one hour so let's rejoice in God's word enjoy yourself uh take notes and and listen tonight as we'll pray father bless your word to us tonight Lord we feel led so we know there's something tonight for each person in here may you catch their Spirit father may you catch their heart may they inclined their ear to your word father may go past every distraction father every care of this world and father take the voice of your messenger to speak to that predestinated seed we ask it tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you as you enjoy the voice of the seventh angel messenger your messenger the voice of God to you God bless you now let us turn tonight to for the text if I should call it that in first Samuel the seventh chapter the eighth chapter and begin with the fourth verse first Samuel the eighth chapter and the beginning with the fourth verse let us read then all the Elders of Israel gathered to themselves together and came to Samuel onto Rhema and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but this display this please Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day or with they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee if I was going to title this for a few moments and then we're going to take up our cards for prayer for the sick right where we left off last night and then tomorrow night tomorrow afternoon there will be prayer cards given out another prayer line tomorrow night and Sunday at two o'clock 2 30 prayer cards will be give out at 2 then Sunday afternoon for Sunday afternoon service having prayer for the sake I want to entitle this subject tonight the rejected King and I wish we had chairs to accommodate or seat somehow the ones that are standing all around tonight uh this a building but I will try to hurry so that you won't have to stand too long but if you'll just give me your undivided attention for a few moments in the day of Samuel the people were a greedy like they are in all days they had come to a place that they wanted to be like the other people and that is just simply a nature with people want to impersonate each other if you go out and buy a certain kind of clothing or certain automobile paint your steps a certain color in your house or on your steps porch steps watch the neighbor they just can't stand it they've got to be the same you go to church and wear a certain kind of a hat that's a little different next Sunday you'll have a lot of your sisters with that same kind of hat if they can find it somehow another they just want to act like one another and that's a good thing if it's used right if it is used in the right way now but these people in the days of Samuel the prophet they wanted to act like the Philistines and the amalekites and the unbelieving and they because that they've seen their people was a little more fancy and they were a nation of called out and chosen people and they are not supposed to act like the rest of the people God's people is never to act like the world or look like the world or be anything to do with the world you are a separated people the church are called out A peculiar people a royal priesthood a holy nation all together different and set aside and all your actions and habits and ways from the things of the world now may the Lord help us as we study now these people seen how the Philistines were doing how the amalekites and the different ones were acting and they came to samly and said we want to be like damn and it's about the same today uh you just let the world start a certain fashion or or some fad and you find all the people even to many other Christians want to do that same thing they want to act like it you let the boys start cutting their hair a certain way and all the boys want to do it and they got to a place down here let their hair grow out real big and looks like a duck or something sitting on top of their head and I tell you I believe that I I if I was a woman a girl and a boyfriend of mine did like that I'd set him down and shave his hair off it looks to me like that a woman would want a man I'll tell you maybe the woman is so masculine that she wants something feminished but that certainly looks like a woman to me I have all that big bush like a duck or a crow or something sitting on top of their head the big long thing sticking out in the back and I never seen such an outfit in my life now I've seen some preachers like that what in the world is this thing coming to after a while they'll have a beat-neck pastor if you don't watch out what they're doing that's the truth oh the church has to act just like the world it must be uh that was rude and I I don't mean it that way see but I'm just trying to make up I'm trying to drive a nail down so tight it won't come out till the clinch on the other side if it hurts maybe I'll back up just a little bit but it's got to be clinched to make it whole is that right brother Woods he's a contractor you got to make it whole by clenching it and I think a man ought to be a man and a woman ought to be a lady and I think that a Christian ought to act like a Christian and associate with Christians and the Church of the leading God ought to be together with one heart and one Accord and have nothing to do with the world when it comes to their ways and habits but we find it today just like it was then they come to Samuel and they said now you're getting old your hair is getting green and we we just don't know how much longer you're going to stay around and now we want you to make us a king just like the Philistines has got like all the rest of the world is God make us just like damn and displeases holy prophet of God any Prophet if he is a prophet he's for Holiness and righteousness and the things of God he can't stand still he's got to bring it out sometimes it costs his life but he he'll bring it anyhow because God is in the person and the pastor Prophet that really for God if it hurts it just he you don't mean to hurt the people he loves the people but he's trying to save them thing and while this uh Kylie upset the good old Prophet that they thought he was too old to go and we find out he lived for many many years later but he was uh he was a servant of the Lord and in doing that they rejected their real King which was God and that displeased the prophet and he didn't want him to do that now Samuel in our message represents the Holy Spirit now Samuel was the mouthpiece of God and today the holy spirit is the mouthpiece of God and today instead of having all of our different Fang dangles in church God wants us to let him rule not popes Bishops and gentle overseers and doctrines and denominations and everything he sent the Holy Spirit to rule the church but we like the people of old we say well let us be like the rest of them they've got a great organization that says build up our group because we believe this now the Holy Spirit never would have stood still for that no sir the Holy Spirit wants us to have no fancies no boundary lines he wants us to be one in him we are children Brothers God doesn't separate his children he said I'll give this in corn bread and beans and this and ice cream and Pie he doesn't do that let listen starve to death and the other thing he feeds them all at the same table and the Holy Spirit should lead the church but they didn't want it that way they they wanted a king they wanted to be like the rest of the world and when the Pentecostal Church the Holy Spirit first fell about 50 something years ago if they would have just let it alone and let God add to the church daily such as would be saved it would have been like it was an Apostolic age but we had to draw fences we had to be like the rest of we had to if the Methodist is a denomination we must be and here comes somebody long said Jesus is coming on a white cloud no he's coming on a white horse all right will you separate I'll get me a group you get you a group there you are what difference does it make he's coming anyhow and no matter how he's coming the thing of it is are you ready to go with him when he comes that's the main thing it doesn't matter how he comes what farm he comes in let's just be ready to go but they'll split hairs on little bitty things and form another organization and that's just the way the world did it and Good Old Samuel he took it to the Lord and he said Lord what can I do about these matters the people are determined that they must have it just that way and we we must we don't know just what to do about this and the Lord said go right ahead and give him their uh give them their King because they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me to be their judge see people don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them no no you don't want that they want they want some Creed to judge him but they want some church to judge them but they don't want the Holy Spirit and he said go ahead and make him a king so they searched out through the country and down in The Tribe of Benjamin they found a man by the name of Kish who had a son named Saul and they chose him great big handsome looking intellectual giant of a man head and shoulders above any other man wear up high intellectual educated smart shrewd nice looking oh that was just exactly what they wanted something they could show off with that's just about the way the churches is getting you want some great big organization something great big fine Church bigger than the little Mission Downtowner that's just the way it goes and many times they leave the little mission where the spirit is leading to go charm to that because you say I belong to the first church see the same old devil just exactly the same misleading other people the biggest church something to show something big all people like to say that they like to get to a place where they got the finest pasture while they got a pastor that's got four degrees out of uh a Princeton or some great University he's so smart and everything like that he might have all those degrees but in God's side he might not even be enough to make a hog collar that's exactly right but all alone God God chooses man and he is our King God the Holy Spirit was sent to govern the Pentecostal Believers the Holy Spirit Believers the king God was sent to do that now they chose him and he was a great man fine fellow just exactly what they wanted that was the God how they before they are anointed in King they made him Chief Captain just to give him a tryout he was a failure to start with to begin with it wasn't in God's program but however when they chose him find him it was going to make him King Samuel told him he said now go on first if you choose to be have a king and reject God you know what's going to take place here he says what's going to take place he'll call all your sons and daughters to be his servants you will pay a tenth of all you got to feed his army and your fine Vineyards and all your fine cattle to be taken over and everything and that's the way it'll be you'll have to have armor barriers you'll have to have soldiers your daughters will be cooks and confectionaries to feed the soldiers and that's the way it'll be oh that's all right but we want him anyhow we want him anyhow then he called him to a place before anointing Saul King he said I want to ask you something in other words let me put it like this have not I been with you since a child as a prophet have I ever took any of your money have I ever begged you for anything no have I ever spoke to you in the name of the Lord but what it come to pass no that's right Samuel all that you have done has been of the lord well then why don't you let God be your king oh we know that you're the prophet we know that you're the servant of God we know that you speak the truth and we know that you're right you've been the right kind of the judge and everything over us father through the Holy Spirit but still we want the king oh brother when people get their head set on something they're just going on anyhow there's just hardly anything you can do that just got your mind made up they're going to do it whether it's right or wrong well you can stand and preach to people that it's wrong for their women to dress immoral for a man to go and women to go to dances for this rock and roll stuff they'll take right out of there like a home to its wall and a dog to its vomit it's exactly right pay no more attention to it and nothing in the world because they are determined they're going to do it anyhow they say they want it anyhow all right so the after all the warnings have been given then finally they wanted a king any household Saul was anointed king the first thing taking place the enemy slipped in on one side and put the right eye out of a lot of the people of God you know the story it's found your Samuel 8 9-10 put the right eye out that's just what the enemy wants to do that's what the enemy's trying to do tonight put the right eye of God's people out the doors it was a right eye the one is spiritual if he can put the spiritual side out of your eye where you see the natural things and not the spiritual things he's got you whipped right there long as you can have churches and big places and find intellectual dress people and so forth as long as your eye looks like that and don't see the spirit side the enemies got you under his control cause you don't know where you're going Amen brother listen what we need today is an old time Backwoods sin killing Revival the Bible Holy Ghost back into the church again with a power of God over the audience and the people feeling the Holy Spirit that's what we need today and if that would take place every wall of denominational difference to be broke down the Oneness Tunis streness Church of God Pilgrim Holiness nazarenes all of them together would be shouting and eating off the same Apple well they would they would be so brotherly and sisterly there would be not even one thought of it but see we want to pattern after something of the world that same thing got into our nation our nation used to be governed by real true politics Christians that go together and pray and come out anointed and try to govern our nation now it's just this honeycombed as it can be with everything crooked they tell me that Communists is all over the country free thinkers and all them kind of the stuff of organizations rising up and it's just in such a state there's no stop to it and it only shows one thing that the true king the Son of God is coming to take over and reign just as certain as we're in this convention tonight oh if people could only remember no matter how long you stay here on Earth still you've got to meet God you take and make God your king your Supreme Lord many people likes to see receive Jesus a savior oh yes I don't want to go to hell so I I'll take him as my savior but not your lord when he's Lord he's got rulership he comes out in and governs you and controls you but you say Lord you can be my savior but don't go to meddling in my private business I don't go you know these things uh you don't want your private life you don't want to Shredder it all to God and that's true friends and whatever you do when you leave this convention you leave this meeting you go home with one determination that you're going to seek God day and night and live in his presence get away from the things of the world oh yes they wanted this King and when they got the king then the enemy began to put the Eyes of the people out and then they couldn't see where they were going that's the first thing the devil does when he can get a servant of God he blinds into the fact that he's lost that's the first thing the enemy done when they got Samson another judge they put his eyes out where he couldn't see where he was going as soon as the enemy of the Philistines coming upon Israel they put the right eye out so they couldn't see good where they were going the only enemy comes into a church he puts her eyes out to the real facts that the holy spirit is the one who rules and governs the church all discipline is brought by the holy spirit amen well I wish I could say the words that would make you go home to the right place see that it never would leave trench in there God gave the Holy Spirit to rule and govern the church the Holy Spirit now now when this taking place they put the right eye out did you notice that cunning little thing that sold on oh he was a slick article because what did he do he sent out all around over the country pieces of ox that he had killed and said let all the people follow me and Samuel oh my me and Samuel see he put Samuel use Samuel's good reputation to deceive the people and many times today and our leaders does the same thing they put in our churches they say why so and so I found her he believed he did this yes he was a good man but brother Something's Happened since then that's right what happened you methodists that used to lay over the power of God all night long when Asbury and and and John and Charles was here in the United States they were called holy rollers and put out of the of the real churches the big churches laid out there in the school houses and the people it preached under the power of God until the people who fall out in the fore and they throw water in their face and Phantom back and forth that's that's me I've seen them do it John Wesley preaching Divine Healing one of his little books a man from The Angler Church turned a fox into foxhounds a loose amongst his congregation and John pointed his finger in that man's face and said the son will not set on your head three times until you call for me to pray for you that evening the man died with cramps in his stomach calling for John to come pray for him and today you talk about a heating service amongst the Methodist people some Methodist man was writing a thesis on a book or I don't hear some time ago about Divine Healing he said there's only one false a message that can find with you brother Brown I said what's that he said one thing that all that come to your meeting nearly as Pentecostal I said all right well let's change it you Methodist sponsor me and I'll come to you I said will you start in your city well he said of course I I said that's what I thought see just exactly God will send his message to somewhere it will not return to me for what can't reset which I have purpose God is able these stones to rise children to Abraham but they refer back to some great fellow moody or Wesley or some great person like that where they sprung up from now that's the same trick that assault on who will not father Samuel and I who will not follow Samuel and I let it be well that's just a smooth trick they they try to pull but Samuel still he told the people not to do this but they did it anyhow because they they wanted to do it they said they would do it anyhow and I was just looking here on the scripture word said here that that Samuel when he almost persuaded the people that they were doing what was wrong and then they went ahead and wanted to do it then when they got this thing taken place then Saul won this Victory and he sent out and told all the Hebrews what they should look for what the Hebrews have done and it really wasn't Saul that won the battle it was his son Jonathan that won the battle then we find again that when this man Saul the first thing you know he got great then stuck out his chest shortly we built this big thing we'd done this and when he done it then he got to a place he didn't want Samuel's advice anymore he died the way he wanted to do it and that's what's happened today the people has got to a place that they don't want to do it the way that God wants to do it they want to do it the way they want to do it that's what's the matter today God wants Divine Healing among his people big high fellow says now wait a minute the days of Miracles has passed now what caused Saul to do that when he got to a place that he took over the leading of the people instead of letting the uh the Holy Spirit now Samuel told him he said now if you'll go ahead and have your king and you'll all live right and keep God's Commandments and do what the Lord says and follow the spirit Saul will be able to preach us some mighty good messages and he did they had no right to disbelieve Samuel because Samuel always prophesied the truth to him he told him what was the truth I said now if you just said uh Saul and all of you follow the leadings of the spirit keep the Commandments of the Lord everything will be all right if that taken place tonight in every Church in the United States there would be a Revival start in this nation I tell you whiskey joints to be broke up it would be it would be one of the most grandest thing that this nation's ever known if every preacher of all denominations would just follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and instead of some Creed of their denomination what some Bishop said or somebody else said or somebody else said what somebody else said has nothing to do with to it God sent the Holy Spirit and he's our God he's our leader but when they even see the Holy Spirit moving they get scared of it they don't know what it is it's a stranger to them because they're not taught in that line they're taught to stop on a certain thing if the church believes and they go on right like that and go through life call themselves Christians and go on with the things of the world and then when they come to God they say well my faith saves me I said to a man some time ago I said sir didn't the Lord ever continue for that smoking oh he said no and I said I have seen you drink myself he said but look at your preacher I'm going to tell you something I visited another man in the room he said my faith saves me I said but Mister let me tell you something now faith without works is dead and I said the Holy Spirit don't live a life like that see and I said you may be disappointed I said now the Faith's all right but if the works don't follow the faith and the Faith's no good and when you die it remember it doesn't change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place and whatever type of spirit you got in you that's a place it will go to and sin can never enter Heaven so if you you say well I confess mine every night we got a prayer book and when we go to church we confess all of our sins and turn right back around and do them again turn right back to the next day God forgive me for drinking forgive me for committing adultery forgive me for lying forgive me for stealing turn right back and do the same thing forgive me for getting drunk last week you didn't mean to drink that much turn right background drink it again well that's not that shows that something hasn't changed inside you're trying to paint the outside kind of whitewash it but what it needs to be done is put in the blood of Jesus Christ and washed white instead of white water that's that's what the world needs today but then we find out then that because it Saul took upon himself Samuel was a little late one day to offer the burnt offerings which is only legal for him to do on the inspiration of God and Saul said why do we have to wait on him he wasn't already to sell he started Leading the People himself instead of letting God lead the people that's where he made his mistake that's where every church that's ever been organized yet made their fatal mistake I've never seen an organization I've I've took history I've read all the way from the Preen I seen fathers and Josephus and all the early historians I've never seen one time or a church ever come into a great spiritual Revival and fell and got away from it it ever rose again I want you to show me where is that God if they won't follow the light God will lay it right up on the shelf and let somebody God's able these stones to rise children on Abraham Luther was a lot of his day but they got a group in there that Lutheran Church and twisted the scriptures around to make it fit their own Theology and the first thing you know the Lutheran Church was on the shelter Revival was over God raised up the Methodist the Methodist come out with sanctification had a great Revival World sweeping one of the greatest the world's ever had in the days of of John Wesley and a great Revival swept the land but time John and Charles and Asbury and all those died off we got a new group in there began to think a lot about well we ought to do this a blood religion and all this kind of stuff and the first thing you know they begin to bring in all kinds of Creeds and things and now of course that laying on the Shelf oh yes and the Pentecostal has done the very same thing that they did just exactly going away of All Flesh yes you want to be like the world don't be like the world we are different Servants of God are different they're born again they're new creatures in Christ you have no right to take the kings of the world and mix it with Christianity the Christian robes not made up of church made Theology of the Christian robes made up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and nothing less than that and our life to follow that baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you live right do right act right talk right live right that is true but then when Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no more Samuel turned right away from him remember as the first time not the second time but the first time that Saul took upon himself to take over the service of the Lord Samuel turned his back on him and walked away from him and the first time that the church lets their leaders take over to lead the people the Holy Spirit gets right away from them and the very first time that you go and being led by a man instead of God the holy spirit will get away from you too [Applause] let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we need his leadership and God gave us a leader and we don't get it you're not long ago I was reading in the brother Gene brought it to me I believe and one of the magazines about a geese leaving Canada and they have a leader and if this leader isn't a real good leader they haven't picked a good one he'll take them anywhere take them over the mountain way and they'll all die you're some time ago a bunch flew up an old Gander they didn't know where he was going didn't know his directions his Instinct wasn't just right he flew a bunch of geese all the way to England they've never been able to come back they their nature is the migrant every year and they just get together and squawk and holler and carry on over there in England and they don't know how to get back home put cinnamon is some of these cold formal borgs that we got today get so far away from God you don't know how to get back you'll never come back by Creeds you've got to have inspiration to lead your brother and that inspiration comes by the Holy Ghost [Applause] yes letter the spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God they love the spirit they don't try to say now wait a minute in my church so don't say Amen my church didn't ever raise their hands they're very quiet while we'd give our pastor chills and fever of somebody heart amen we are chilling up once in a while find out what would take place that's right what we need today is a good old heart felt religion let me tell you something if a baby is born and that baby don't cry it don't wind it don't open his little mouth and say a thing nothing happens what's the matter with that baby he's born dead I think we got too many still bursts today uh in a church father come up and say to you believe God the Father Almighty creator of heavens and earth Jesus Christ his son yes I do will you promise to do so and so for this church yet he's a little salt shaken a few little drops of water get in the right hand of Fellowship put him in the church that's stillborn babies yeah that's right what do you happen to a baby when he's born if you don't cry as soon as he drops into the Earth what's the first thing you do to him is pick him up turn him over your arm and give him a little um what did you call it the paddling that's right give him a few wraps like that and the first thing you know he'll go and you got a baby living and that's what it needs today in the church it's not somebody saying now I know it might not be all right to do that little sissified thing you need a man behind the pulpit that'll tell you that'll tell you the pieces tell you how to get to squall it up once in a while and let God come in here to let something take place then you're born as somebody a baby around your sins and say oh well that our our forefathers believe that our forefathers our Bible said it's right that's what's right's our Bible and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost which we all know that that was the birth of the new church if that same Holy Spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you've got a different Holy Spirit from what that was exactly we don't make you live a sacrificial life in a life full of joy and pleasure in the baptism of the spirit leading you into signs and wonders and miracles and things that something happened Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe look how they perverted it today when man leave here's a good church member oh I know he does this oh I know he does that but he's a deacon in the church and uh he does this and that the other but I'll tell you he's certainly when we come time for we us to have our missionary program never fails to put in a 500 check and if we got a repair to do oh he's a fine fella then stand there with your collar turn around and preach his funeral someday over a half-mast play say he's gone to heaven that's a simple thing let me tell you something what we need today is New Birth New Life what a difference a man just said that long ago a preacher told me that he had to take a memory in his church secretly said he's a good man but said he just couldn't stand out before that audience and be brought into church that I I had to take him into the prayer room in the back and take him into the church secretly so what do you think about that Billy I said I'd have turned him now straight George and kicked him as hard as I could that's the way I'll tuck him in trying I was going down to the river here some time ago to baptize a woman and there's a whole group going along with me and so the woman going along there she said brother Brandon I said yes she said well I finally decided for you go down and duck me so what's in she said you're going to fix me up and said induct me aren't you and I said no ma'am before I do that I said you got to get your heart right with God I wouldn't baptize you on no conditions you're still alive in the world yet you got to be dead we only buried dead people those who are dead in Christ and ready to rise to New Life again and a person make a remark like that against baptism is the fit candidate for water baptism right well that's where we go we find out the spirit Saul said I'll do it myself I know how to do it I know as much about as that Old fogy Samuel and Samuel had proved that he was a servant of God he proved that the Holy Spirit was with him for he said I'll take you to record this day have I ever spoke to you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass have I ever come begged and bummed money from you and all these great things no they said you haven't done that but still we want to have it the way we want it see and that's then to see what they were getting then now we find out then when a man rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit you know what God did for Saul he'd give him an evil spirit to lead him how about that he give him an evil spirit God gave him an evil spirit to lead him so when a man rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit or any person rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit you've got a devil on you to lead you exactly the Bible oh God I wish we could have a Revival I wish there could come a time that when the Holy Spirit could really get into the hearts of the American people again that they would see it's him hey you want to look say well now look I can cooperate this meeting because my church don't what difference does that make what's that got to do with it well I'll tell you uh they believe in this and we don't believe that as long as they're preaching the Bible and the whole Bible and the Full Gospel and nothing but the truth listen to it as long as you're led by the spirit believe in it and God will make himself known if a man is led by the spirit of God God will make himself known to that person yes sir God promised to so in doing that we know then that the Holy Spirit leads the people and God takes care of it amen you believe that with all your heart certainly we do all right then I'd like to say another thing that evil spirit begin to lead Saul and it led him and today when the holy spirit's rejected it once it what will it do you'll get an evil spirit to lead you now listen I don't want to hurt you but I want you to get this see just as it was in them days so is it today they don't want the Holy Spirit to lead him so they get an evil spirit what takes place with the evil spirit the evil spirit is won't still eat wants to lead them then and now what they don't want they didn't want God to be their judge and people today don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them that's the reason they turned Samuel down because his judgment was of God it was scriptural and he didn't want to be led by the spirit and they turned it down for an ecclesiastical man and what did he get an evil spirit to lead him now the people today don't want to be led by the Holy Spirit they don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them now that's true friends they don't want the Holy Spirit to judge you then people said to me a woman said to me not long ago I was preaching real hard and I was balling the sisters Opera cutting their hair and telling it the Bible said that she was a prostitute if she did so she is unfair to her husband and he had a right to put her away just exactly what the scripture says any woman that'll cut her hair off of her head she dishonors her husband the Bible said which is her hand and you can preach to him that lady met me outside and she said let me tell you something right now preacher you're sure going to ruin your ministry I said any Ministry that the word of God will ruin ought to be ruined that's exactly right he said well she said everybody walk away and leave you I said as long as he stays with me that's the main thing you see let him stay and uh sure they don't want the people you don't because they want to be like the world they don't want women don't want to dress like the people of God decent moral well here a few weeks ago I went to a Pentecostal meeting now you Baptists get ready to shouting Presbyterians I went to one of the leading Pentecostal churches of the United States and my associate and I was sitting there I was going to have a Sunday morning service I am one they know that I'm always against that kind of stuff and then when they let Sunday school out I was sitting out there in a parking lot here come the Sunday School teachers no no that is that ain't the Methodist that's Penny calls real shark Bob there and make up all of their Facebook like they've been eating red beef steak and got all over their fingernails and and all out like that all that paint manicure on them walking out there and here come man my age with that big pop hair cutting ducktaled in the back like that brother if I had a congregation like that I'd sure tear them to Pieces brother it sure would be yes sir oh they want to go stainless now the Holy Roller preached and then claimed to be Teddy talk [Applause] [Music] I got a friend a Sunday school teacher can I say good morning Reverend Brandon and all the that red stuff on the face and this Black Pencil over their eyes and and all the and dress so sexy like and they say well now wait a minute brother Brandon that's the only kind of clothes you can buy they still sell goods and sewing machines so they're they're not a bidding excuse for you that's right if you're led by the Holy Spirit straighten up they don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them I don't want there's no excuses God won't listen to your excuses he wouldn't listen to songs he won't listen to you you've got to compare with what the Bible said I think any woman ought to be clean she ought to look her best any man ought to to look pretty and clean but be decent you know if you dress yourself just that old clothes that people wearing them old shark since woman said to me sometimes said brother I don't wear them shorts that I wear slacks I said that's worse it's worse you know what God said it's an abomination in the sight of God for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man [Applause] God is God and never changes he's the infinite God if it once made a sickening stake and smell before him it still makes a stick and stink and smell they'll see a woman put on her garment pertains to a man he made man man and made women if he doesn't preach it that way that's what the Bible said Zachariah oh they don't want that one lady said to me said what do you think it's wrong for a woman to wear some this makeup I said yes sir I do I sort of face God never heated me what you want you to look like he's a barn he had a major Barn I said all painted up like that if he wants you to smoke it put a smoke stack on top maybe some flu so she could breathe it out but he he give you lungs to breathe good fresh air that's what he did it for but they don't know but they don't want nobody they want Holy Spirit to judge him now if you get the Holy Ghost and can still live that way you come to me and tell me you got the Holy Ghost living like that uh I can't be your judge but according to the word you misaligned somewhere brother that's exactly what the spirit says see that's right we need back Holiness again brother we need to come back to God yes they reject it certainly they do they don't want to know how that they don't want to uh come out of the jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit they don't want the spirit to guide them let me tell you something ladies I'm not making fun of you this is no place for that this is the place where judgment goes for and judgment has to go right and judgments by the word of God looking there was only one woman in the entire Bible that ever painted her face that's right one woman and she never painted her face to meet God she paint her face to meet a man to try to Vamp him that's right Jezebel you know what God did for her he fed her to the dogs that's right so when you see a woman wearing makeup you say that's Miss dog meat that's exactly what it is for God he fed her to the dogs so that's all she's fit for we're dogs he fed her to the dogs how many knows that's the truth Say Amen that's exactly right so you see how those Heathen traits get into the church is to call some lukewarm son of Kiss stands behind the pulpit and is afraid of his kneel ticket to preach the truth brother let me tell you we need man behind a Pulpit and not a bunch of theological sissies that's afraid of something to say to the people we need man of Courage good man filled with the Holy Ghost that stands there that will not preach sissified stuff in Creeds and denomination but will preach the gospel and shut the hide off of them it's exactly right right you little old kids in our Junior honey don't you do that get you a stick and skinny look what you raised up out of that Junior honey little Marth you know stomp her feet and tell her Manny you go shut up I ain't gonna do that oh boy good thing they didn't have my daddy I'm trying yes sir all this stuff see what you got a bunch of juvenile idiots just exactly what you got insane just said that for insane sound filling up with him beat next that's why I call it Junior deer the Bible said if you spare the rod you spoil your son that's right God knows what's truth and what's best Samuel tried to tell Saul that God knows what was best but Saul said well the people want me that's that's it as long as you get somebody to follow him that's all he wanted he used Samuel's name and get somebody to follow him that's all he wanted no they don't want that real true gospel they don't want that real truth don't want the Holy Spirit to um to guide them they'd rather have the intellectual pastor see now here's the kind of man they want somebody they don't what they want somebody that'll not tell them it's wrong to do this or wrong to do that to quit doing this and quit doing that no they don't want that but they want a man that's got a Theological Seminary experience that they can say he's got several degrees and he stands up very nicely and he dresses very Natalie which is perfectly all right but when he gets there he kind of does their own interpretation of the Bible uh not according to the Bible but according to some theological seminaries experience instead of a baptism of the Holy Ghost down to him to make him shut the hide off that's exactly right amen tell me a prophet in the Bible it was a true Prophet it didn't shut the high at all tell me whatever come to pass they didn't want to believe him then but God give them signs and wonders to follow him to make the people to vindicate that their Ministry was right it's always been that way the Holy Spirit today comes right down in the church and said these signs shall follow them at least in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents or drink do anything lay hands on the sick and they shall recover on the day of Pentecost is fully come there's all in one place in one Accord selling there came a sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind it filled all the house where they were setting cold and tongue set up on them like if far there was all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance out into the streets they went screaming and dancing and acting like drunk people Justice and remember you Catholic people the Blessed Virgin Mary was among them and if she couldn't go to heaven without getting that kind of experience how are you going to make it there she was all full of the Holy scratch your shorter Pentacles now what do they do today take you bring us some old war out later from four or five different churches that's had it placed it down there and sets in a church and called you a member their soul that's exactly what he did but Samuel wanted to be led of God these people go to church on Sunday morning a pastor could interpret the word they go right back out there and do what they want to through the week he tells them they go home after he's given the interpretation of a few things in the church and to say a few Creeds they go home kind of a half satisfied consoling themselves all my religion is done it's all right till next week I'll go down again take the communion on Sunday morning some bread and grape juice and so forth and whatever they do and let it go like that oh brother but now what did Saul do he certainly made a great Army he certainly did he brought Israel to a great Army he made them all with fine polished Spears he trained him with them Spears to fight just this right real Gallant man he bit him all big shields and everything they were real polishing trained all to the very minute well they were getting along fine the rest of the nation looked out and said you know Israel's coming along pretty good but one day one day God don't let it go too long yeah until one day there came a Challenger by the name of Goliath folded his arms and Israel shook to their shoes were trimming on the ground that old Head and Shoulder above all the rest of them shook with him too there he stood he never seen such a thing the spirit had to take over the god of Israel had to show its power oh yes there'll be a glass somewhere we've had one not long ago we've got some today I don't understand why we've got the greatest intellectual the best dressed crowds we've got the best theological seminaries some of the finest trained man that ever come out they've trained choir so they can sing How Great Thou Art to archangels couldn't compare with him Harley oh they're training the very best of schools and everything like that knowing all about it but when it comes to the time of the supernatural they know nothing of it baby dogs had a challenger out the show which was right to show that that thing was wrong brother I say this with Godly love and respect one of our sons of Kish Head and Shoulders above all the other evangelists was called by mohammer the other day and challenged to the word of God and trailer these shoes and left the ground oh my what's the matter it was something besides theology it had to bring this Supernatural power of God into it he know nothing about it same as it was in the days of Saul but listen you True Believers in Christ you true Christians that believe in God in the Supernatural all the time Saul was training this big army and all these intellectuals coming up God had a little David out there somewhere feeding his father's sheep on sheep food the word not on theological weeds he had to be standing by when that happened oh my they want to give him a seminary experience Saul said come here maybe my arm would fit you he said take the thing off on me well I'll make you a bachelor of Art and give you a doctor's degree he said I don't know nothing about it take the thing off of me but let me tell you something I've got this slingshot well that's no comparable but look here one day a lamb was out there feeding one of my father's sheep was out there feeding and a lion come in and got it and packed it off and I took this slingshot and I trusted in the god of Israel and I went at him and I knocked him down and slew him and brought that lamb back is that a bear come in and got a kid and started off with him one of my fathers and I put the rock in a sling shop that's a little bitty thing but uh I want to answer him I wasn't trusting this thing shot but I was trusting in the power of the god of the Israel amen what is that f-a-i-t-h-i-n-j-e-s-u-s that's right trusting in the power of the god of Israel and I'll knock that bear down took the line the little sheep out of his mouth and took it back he said how much more I'm a Deliverance Minister I know what I'm talking about listen he's got some little Davids in the world today they not be being recognized but Sauls that's true but there's some little Davids in the world that's pastoring and feeding God's sheep sheep food and one day a great big cancer coming and got one the doctor said well he's gone but the little David said I don't know ain't got very much just a prayer of faith but I'm coming after you because you're my father's sheep I got faith Hallelujah [Music] that was a paralytic stroke hit one he said I don't know how I'm going to get it but I'm coming after you you're one of my father's sheep Hallelujah don't reject the king of Israel [Applause] [Applause] thank you he didn't have very much but he had faith in the god of Israel I'll tell you they had rejected they had all their choirs and trained scholars in theology but when it come for the supernatural they were stunted they didn't know nothing about it why didn't David know the Scarlet man because he was feeding another Pastor that's right he was training under another atmosphere one day uh a sickness coming and he got one father's sheep was going to take it to a premature grave these little David said I don't know how I'm going to do it they said oh nonsense that little slingshot um I don't know how to do it but it's a promise and I got faith in it so I'm coming ahead to that lamb and he brought it back Hallelujah oh come on what we need tonight is to get away from all of this man-made Theology and bring the key back [Applause] yes sir don't you worry [Applause] they were afraid to publish the meeting in South Africa Joseph already did it when ten thousand muhammads sat there and seen a little twisted boy all twisted up like that Marvel up to the platform not even in his right mind on the scene the Holy Spirit tell him who he was what happened and what done it and when he got through praying he straightened up like a man like that 10 000 muhammads laid their trophies to the ground and accepted Jesus Christ as personal savior yes sir look at Tommy Osborne Oral Roberts men who feed the flock on sheep food the days of Miracles has not passed that says the theologians if the days of Miracles just passed the day of God has passed God is a miracle certainly they are sheep food oh my poor dejected friend the devil might have took you sister out down to a place where you never do desire to let your hair grow might get you to a place where you think that some Pastor is nonsense when he's preaching you pure Holiness the way you should dress some of you man out there it goes around and does these things that you ought not to do and you man that'll let your wife do a thing like that and smoke cigarettes I've got little respect for you even as a man that's exactly right you know a man's ahead of the house as long as he takes his place but we I I don't I like to see a man a man a man's not judged by how many muscles he's got that's Beast a man's not judged by the brawny muscles but he's judged by the begs and the knees of his pants where he's been praying that's what takes a man a man is character not beast but character I've seen man that weighed 200 pounds and have an ounce of man in them grab a baby out of her mother's arms and ravish her any man would give a woman a cigarette is little and low down and knowing that's one of the greatest fifth columnists breaking the backbone of our nation and these cigarette factories and everything out here putting out cigarettes and whisking and then they're taking right off all their income tax on these advertisements to put out more Tommy right on television and pattern needs went oh God what's the matter with our country it's rejected the leadership of the Holy Ghost that wouldn't stand on there for stuff like that no utter sickness and diseases is on the Rampage what we need today is a God the rejected king the king of Israel they're riding Among Us like this he might have took you like that there might be sick people here now he's going to stand in this prayer line they might stand your cancer might have took you the devil might have packed you out of the reach of a doctor your Beloved Physician and he's talking to a place where you can't come back that may be so but let me tell you something brother when I bring in this prayer on tonight I ain't got nothing but a little bit of slingshot called f-a-i-t-h I'm coming after you a shot I'm coming out of here I've seen anybody orders back he'll bring you back too listening God that could heal these people other people can heal you you believe that yes indeedy the same God still is and we're coming after United and with the power and faith in Jesus Christ will knock that devil down to the flat and bring him back why is it it's a father's sheep it's God's Little Lamb that Satan stole away and said ah he's got a lot of influence I'll take him away to the church I'll take her away the church come on David let's go yes sir God promised us the victory how so much more will this uncircumcised unbelieving Felicity never stand and defy the word of the Living God yes sir I'll be like the Hebrew children are God's able to deliver us but nevertheless we won't bow to any images of formal denominations or nothing else amen I'll come that's all I can do I can't say I can bring it back but I'm coming trying I'm going to meet him in the name of Jesus Christ with a commission of an Angel who come to me and said if you'll get the people you believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer it's done for tens of thousands times thousands you poor little sick sheep tonight I'm coming after you now in the name of Jesus Christ um I want to bring you back away from them old places to the Shady Green Pastures in the Stillwater or you can lay down and put a straw in your mouth and look up towards God oh I got peace lie at the river I got peace like the river yes that's what we ought to do oh there's more these pastors how many preachers in here that believe in Deliverance for for the sick and inflicted just look at here you're coming back little lamb and I cause we're coming after you yes sir that devil of a line called cancer that devil of a lion called anything he wants to be called in the medical name whatever he is he's a devil and we've got commission from Jesus Christ in my name they shall cast out devils [Music] he better get going cause this many year and we'll go to catch him tonight we're coming to bring you back [Applause] that ought to be the attitude of our mess the message that we're bringing that this message is to restore Amen to bring us back bring us back to the faith not just for ourselves but for those that are around us you know and if you want to bring somebody back you got to come back to yourself that's right you got to come back to the lady said to that praying to that dedication to that reading to that leadership of the Lord to that applying the token to that doing those things that that cut cleaning up and and getting right amen you know and if emotion it it you can have all the emotion in the world and you'll be drained by it you but you have faith because your faith is resting on the word of God then you have strength amen so I hope tonight I just hope that uh I I enjoy how many enjoyed the word amen just full of nuggets full of wonderful things full of things that that that take it and and and and make us strong and that's what we want we won't we don't want the Holy Spirit to lead us the Living God the spirit move and we want to be honest with one another and if we need a touch from the Lord we we want to take the time to provide the the presence of the Lord but maybe tonight uh I I if the musicians would come and and um and we just ask ourselves he said we've come to bring you back you know so you know we all of us in our lives go through times that we get we call it backslid or lukewarm or cold and indifferent and I I know for a fact I always think of what the messenger told us he said you know if you don't sit in that presence and you don't drink in that water he said you you're you're wind up just like a cactus and all that thorn on the cactus is he said it was a leaf that got so lack of water that it just turned up and got sticky and the only way to come to unwind is to get into the presence of the Lord and come back to the presence of the Lord come back to daily devotion come back come back to what's right come back to brotherly kindness thinking what the other ones go through so let's stand this evening but really if you'd pick a song to sing and and in the light of this message tonight you know a lot of times we say oh I want the church you are the church the church is made up of many membered body fitted and joined together if we want the church to be different then we've got to be different amen if we want the church to have a Revival we've got to have a Revival [Music] you just can't always wait for somebody else to do it that's what the prophet of God said that's everybody's
