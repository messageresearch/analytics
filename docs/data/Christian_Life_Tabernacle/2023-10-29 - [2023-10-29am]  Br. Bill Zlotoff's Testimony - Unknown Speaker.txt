here Lord another Divine appointment where you're bringing your people in contact with your presence and Lord we ask for you to have your perfect will in this place Lord that you would move according to your will and that your word would have preeminence Lord and that any spirit that would stand against it would be rebuked this morning Lord that every need that came in that door would be met Lord as you promised you are the meter of every need you're the satisfier of every desire you're the lifter of every burden the Healer of every sickness Lord the deliverer of every bondage and we just commit the service to you we look forward to your leading and we pray that we would glorify you in all that we do in Jesus name amen amen let's go ahead and be seated this morning I think we all woke up in Seattle this morning so welcome to Seattle you know I was just reading this week in Galatians 3 and you know there were just some verses that you know we all know that sort of stuck out to me and you verse 16 he says now to Abraham in his Seed where the promise is made he saith not Anto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ you know he goes on to say in verse 26 for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus amen for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and if ye be christs then are ye Abraham's seed amen and HS according to the promise you know there has always ever been one seed to who the promises that's right applied you know as Paul said in Romans it was not a biological seed it's not a specific nationality or culture or race or family and we see it spoken of throughout the scriptures from the earliest days in the garden in Genesis 3:15 where God spoke to that serpent he said I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed singular one and it singular one shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel you know reading Psalm 89 and we'll be reading that this morning if you want to go ahead and turn there and in verse three it says I have made a covenant with my children amen with my chosen rather I have sworn unto David my servant thy seed singular will I establish forever and build up thy Throne to all generations he spoke this by a prophet to David in 2 Samuel 7 he said and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever and then one day Solomon his son rose up became king he built a temple and as he was dedicating the house of the Lord he said this in First Kings 8:18 and the Lord said unto David my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou did well that it was in thine heart you know if you what's interesting is we often refer to David as a man after God's Own Heart and what was on his heart was that a house should be built that God could put his name on and that was what was in God's heart his his desire would that there would be a house established forever that he could put his name on their desires were the same you know and there are many throughout the years that thought this promise was fulfilled that when David's physical seed built a physical house but you know that was just a shadow and a tipe right you know Solomon died David's physical Dynasty and Throne passed away there's no more Thrones in Israel and the temple which he built was destroyed rebuilt by a Godless King destroyed again it's been dust and Ashes for 2,000 years and yet the scriptures spoke of a seed which would establish an everlasting Kingdom and throne and house that he could put his name on you know the same seed that is referred to in Genesis in 2 Samuel in Galatians in Romans one seed you as brother brandham showed us in the scripture his threefold purpose to perform the work where he could ultimately dwell with and in his people that reflected his identity you know throughout the years men have tried to mix that seed with different things whether that's been I be cast into the sea so let's just read uh Psalm 89 we're going to start in verse 18 and we're going to read from Verse 18 to verse 13 then thou spakest in Vision to thy Vision to thy Holy One and say I have laid help upon one that is mighty I have exalted one chosen out of the people I have found David my servant with whom holy oil have I anointed him with whom mine hand shall be established my arm also strengthen him the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness afflict him and I will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him but my faithfulness and my Mercy shall be with him and in my name shall his horn be exalted I will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers he shall cry unto me thou art my father my God and the rock of my salvation also I will make him my first born higher than the kings of the earth my Mercy will I keep for him forever more and my Covenant shall stand fast with him his seed also will I make to endure forever and his throne as the days of Heaven if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments if they break my statutes and keep not my Commandments then will I visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes nevertheless Le my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail my Covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips once have I sworn by my Holiness that I will not lie unto David his seed shall endure forever and his throne as the son before me it shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven seea amen God bless you may have your seats this morning amen God atributes were manifested through his bride in this last age we have called to

wife is Marcy when she's there I know I'm okay we've been married 51 years this last October 51 years and so she's she's me she's who I am and uh appreciate there's been people in my life I'm sorry tell you get in the presence of the Lord there's nothing like it I gave my heart to the Lord over 50 years ago and uh as you get older you know less but there's one thing you do know is that when you get in his presence just try to stay there as long as you can amen try to stay in his presence because it's not always like that you have to go back out into this world and back out in humanity and it's it's hard it's tough even pulling out on the street having it's a tough thing to to look both ways but if you give it all to him he's the one that's watching out after us amen amen you know I was thinking as the church has been going up out here and and uh I've watched it i' I've been a friend of David over 50 years and uh and the Bible says without a vision that people perish yes and I think that Brother David all these years has had a vision even when I first met him he had a vision and his vision was he wanted he wanted to get closer to God but he wanted whoever he was talking to to get closer to God and that's his purpose I think that's as a pastor that's what he wants he wants every one of us to have that walk with Jesus to know him better and better and better every day know him just as close as you can get with him he wants you to have that presence with the Lord and as I've watched the church go up and excuse me my nose runs a little bit when I'm when I talk and and I was watched the church and I watched the I was here last year about this time and all it was he was working on the parking lot and the light poles were going up and the church the foundation hadn't even been poured yet and and then I watched at the videos that he's had on you brothers and sisters have had online I've been able to watch the church go up and that's how God does it yes he starts with a solid ground you don't want to be built on a sanding ground you don't want to build on a Shifty ground that's going to move and it's going to come tumbling down the Bible teaches that but you want to be built on a solid ground Jesus is that Solid Ground amen and I've watched the church go up and and as it's come up I saw the you know the floor being poured and then the they so the uh framing being done and then the roof was put on and then the roofers were putting the roof on and and now to look at it came over the other night with Brother David and uh you walk in and just it's just beautiful when things work in harmony that's how our church is we work in harmony the deacons are doing their jobs brother Billy the song leader does his job everyone one of us the trustees do their job every one of us that comes we do a job we have a job to do you know without you there' just be someone standing up talking to the walls but you as people in the body of Christ bring Christ you bring him here and that alone is you're doing your job have you made yourself ready this morning did you prepare prepare your hearts this morning to hear that word did you get the foundation ready before the walls have gone up you know if you haven't made that this morning and you've not done that there's still time to do that time isn't as we know is not over yet it looks like it's getting close but all the things that are going on in this world but it hasn't I don't believe it's happen CU I'm still here cuz I'm going in the Rapture hallelujah amen I'm going to be one of those ones that will see my Lord Savior and I'm going to be walking with him one of these days hand in hand along that Creek like Billy Paul is right now with brother brandham walking hand in hand with Billy with brother brandham along that Creek I'm going to be walking with my savior one of these days you know and that's God's whole purpose as he you know when he before there was even God there was just time space there wasn't even time there was just God was God was just who he was and but he in his being wanted to have Fellowship wanted to have sons and daughters ones that he could fellowship with he wanted to be able to show his attributes his healing power his love his kindness his Joy he wanted to be able to share those with his people so in this greatness of God again before God in this greatness in the spirit a Halo went out this is how brother Ram says it a Halo went out the logos of God the same the same Pillar of Fire that's right there the lcus of God the same Pillar of Fire that led Moses out of Egypt the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel at night is the same logus of fire that leads us today amen there's no difference it's the same thing you look at the logos of God that's that's who we are that logos went out and that logos was Jesus Christ that logos was the word of God and that's what that was it was the word of God Jesus Christ God didn't have hands he didn't have a mouth he didn't have able to express himself through a body so he had to have one that he borne to himself Jesus Christ he born to himself so he could express himself to us isn't that one wonderful brothers and sisters that he thought of all us you know I was able to go on a river trip here in the Grand Canyon a couple years ago we spent 11 days on the river and I don't know if any of you ever had the chance to do a river trip or been in the Grand Canyon but it's a magnificent place you can just see God and everything I've I've had the opportunity to go down from one side to then up the other side and I've I've done over the years I've done a lot of running we actually ran the Grand Canyon and with a mountain you know you're you're going you're going up but you don't really see time but in the Grand Canyon you're going almost back in time because you're going down into the Earth crust and you so you get down into into the Grand Canyon and as we were floating down the river we we were in uh dories and there were some AR archeologists with us and there were some astronomers with us and as we would float down the river they would say yeah these rocks here are a billion and a half years old and they would say aren't they beautiful and I say w they're just they're just magnificent and then at night the Stars would come out and it's so dark down that you can just the stars are just like little crystals just bright and shiny and yeah amen and uh I was I would look at those and there was an archaeologist and he says yeah and that consolation is so and so and and that star is so and so aren't they beautiful and I said yeah they're beautiful and one night I was I had gotten up and something inside me says you know you know the maker I know the one that did all this these people never even mentioned about our God that's right but I personally as a Son of God could stand there I know the one that did that and I got up one morning and I got out of the tent it was about 2: in the morning and the moon had come up and the walls were glistening along the sides of the river and the ri you could hear the river the sound of the river and it was just beautiful and I got up and I said Lord thank you thank you that the greatest our Lord who so great so powerful so magnificent lives here and he says son you were with me when I did this amen that's right every one of us every one of us was with him when he created all this glory and magnificence we are in his thinking God knows what he's doing amen so if you would stand with me this morning and Brother David just kind of being Brother David I got a call this morning so I don't have a lot but I don't rely on this anyway amen we rely on the Lord Jesus Christ so I would like to read I'm going to read a couple scriptures and maybe a little something that brother brandom said but first of all let's let's turn to Timothy Chapter 2 second Timothy Timothy excuse me I better put my glasses on second Timothy the first chapter I was thinking when brother Mike was reading the psalm this morning I could have just stayed in there because he was preaching what I was going to talk about and I'm not a preacher I'm just going to give you a testimony this morning but he was talking about what I was I said I'm just going to stay in here and he can just keep on going that would have been just really nice so second Timothy one starting at the eth verse okay be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoners now this is Paul speaking nor of me his prisoner but be thou partakers of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life immortality to light through the gospel wherefore where unto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know know who I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed un him against that day amen there's not through your heart that takes us right out of it doesn't it we have nothing to do with it it's by his grace by his Mercy he keeps us we can't do anything he's going to take care of it all for us amen let's turn over to Psalm 37 uh 37 and uh verse 23 and these are all scriptures I'm sure every one of you have heard before but it's just it also puts me into remembrance and reminds me of what God is doing amen so 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord amen so he's going to keep us and he's also ordered our steps so what are we worried about that's right we' have no worries this morning right he is going to take care of everything and then the last scripture before you can be seated uh John 15 this is probably one of my favorite scriptures and I think if you Ponder on it and you think about about it it puts everything completely into perspective of where we are our lives the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day the mystery of God revealed which was Jesus Christ mystery it says here in the we'll go uh the 15 uh 16 verse 16 ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shall remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you I want to go back to the first there ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you let's just pray Lord Jesus we appreciate your word we could Lord we could go home now and we could Feast on these scriptures all day long Lord but Lord we ask that you would come maybe say something Lord that would help every one of us would help me and we appreciate your word this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated so I was just you know you you go back and you think about your life and maybe when I talk talk a little bit about my testimony and how I met Brother David because that's what I'm going to tell you he says be careful don't tell him everything and I and I've known him a long time uh but he's a precious brother and there's I've met a lot of a lot of good man a lot of wonderful people Christian man in my life but there's a couple that just stand out to me in my life that has been such a foundation in my life and that one of them is Brother David and I want to also say that my wife and she's part of my testimony and I'll tell you about her has been a main stay of my life and uh I was I I was raised in a Jewish Family and so I was never ever taught about Jesus Christ didn't know who he was didn't have any idea who he was because in the Jewish religion or the faith they don't teach you about Jesus Christ you learn about the Old Testament you learn about Moses and David and all the Patriarchs and Jacob and all the ones in the Old Testament but they don't ever talk about Jesus Christ because that they don't believe the Messiah has come yet and he said well brother Bill you were a true devout Jew no I was a renegade I I I didn't there's something about it I would go to Sabbath school they didn't have Sunday school but they would have Sabbath school and I would go to Sabbath school and I I would try to go sneak out and go hide somewhere because it just there was just some it just didn't do anything there was something that just you know the Deep call the deep but there was nothing calling there was nothing there that would just seemed like they were just talking and and the stories are wonderful we know that the Old Testament is a shadow of the new if you can't see Jesus Christ in every verse in the Old Testament you're missing something you should be able to read the Old Testament and see a shadow of the new amen he's in every verse brothers and sisters and I think as we get older we see that did I know that when I first became a Christian no because I didn't even know who Jesus was you know I was trying to learn who he was and so not being brought up in a Christian family I'll tell you what my thought of of Jesus was was when I would go over to F that Christmas time I would go over to friend's house and I would see a Christmas tree in the corner with lights on it to me that's what Jesus Christ was I mean that's how I I just didn't know and I would look at that tree I said well that must in my I would think well that must be Jesus in the corner there in that tree I just didn't know I wasn't brought up I had no idea who he was and so my wife and I I met her when she was 13 I don't think we started dating till we were 16 she was 16 I was a few years older than her and uh uh I was working as a carpenter for my uncle up on a mountain and right below the the mountain there there was the school where Marcy went to school and uh she used to walk up to the school or to where I was working about 3:30 her school was out and I'd get off at 3:30 and she would walk up the hill and and I had uh I would wait for her and then I would take her home and so excuse me she uh she came walking up one afternoon and and she was crying and I said I saidoh why you crying she goes oh you wouldn't understand and I said and I was I was 19 years old young people I was young one time I was your age God's real let me tell you God is real you just can't put words on as you get older you see him in your life doing more and more and more miracles in your life and things in your life and with your family and your kids and it's just he is so real anyway she came walking up she was crying and I said oh why are you crying she goes oh you wouldn't understand and I said well did someone hit you or did you have a problem at school she goes no no no and she was crying I'm saying well tell me why you're crying she goes well I went to a young life meeting at school and some of you might familiar with young life and it was at her school and I think I think she was a junior in high school at that time and uh she goes I gave my heart to the Lord I said you what gave your heart to who you know I thought I had her heart you know but I guess I wasn't the only one you know but she gave her heart she's I gave my heart to the Lord and I said well what's all that about she goes well you wouldn't understand I guess well I guess I don't so I took her home and I was at that time I we were kind of like hippies you know it's kind of like Brother David when he was before he had gotten saved and had long hair and that kind of stuff and I'm not glorifying any of that brother and sister I'm just telling you a testimony this is glorifying God that's who I want to glorify this morning Amen in our testimony each one of our testimony we each have a testimony on what has God has done in our Liv lives none greater than the other they're all great because of him it's his righteousness that's here I'm only saved because of him I'm only saved by grace by his Mercy by his kindness that's the only reason I'm here today if it hadn't been for that I would probably be dead now or who knows where I'd be in prison somewhere I don't know but so time went on and we were of course back then we were doing things you know and with the with the drugs and stuff and I'm not good I'm not glorifying that it's not good and uh she changed and I saw something in her life change and I didn't understand it I couldn't figure it out i' we'd I'd say well let's let's go we went to a lot of rock concerts back in San Diego and I probably passed I me I probably passed path with David when he was The Wizard I don't know if you know his testimony but uh but she just all of a sudden she didn't want to do the same things that I wanted to do she didn't want to go to the rock concerts and she didn't want to go out with the guys and the girls and do with things that we did you know and she just no I'm I'm not doing that and I said well what are you GNA do I'm going to a Bible study and I went Bible study what is a Bible study I can I had no idea she goes well she goes when we all get together and talk about the Bible and I said well okay well I'm going out with the guys you go to your Bible study but there was she had changed I saw that change in her and I know that it it started to affect me because I I'll be honest with you I loved her and after 51 years plus you I still love her and I hope she loves me she does and so I saw her her life change and then there was a friend of mine that uh and I used to Surf I surfed a lot I love the ocean used to spend a lot of time in the ocean and Surf and just loved it and uh there was a friend of mine that served us up but then he got saved and I'm I'm I'm I'm looking and he changed and I'm saying what what in the world is going on first my girlfriend and then my good friend and I said they're all making these changes and I don't know anything about it so he moved up up to a place in California called Ventura California and it's a Beachside community and he lived there and and uh he was you know and I I kept watching Marcy and again she wouldn't didn't want to do the things that we used to do and then he moved away and so he came down one time and he he says uh why don't you why don't you come up to Ventura the waves are real good I heard if I heard the waves were good I'm going because that was that's what it was all about back then for me anyway and uh he said the waves are supposed to be good this week and why don't you come up and we'll go surfing and I said that that's a plan so I did I I drove up to Ventura and I think I believe it was on a Friday and we surfed and then he says by the way he said we're going to go to a Bible study a house meeting and I thought well okay and I don't know if you ever heard of the Jesus people movement some of you might have heard that back in California I was part of that and uh say what you want about some of those things that's where God called me amen it doesn't sometimes God is we think we have it figured out we don't have it figured out brothers and sisters we just got to let God lead us we just have to let God direct us it's not what we think you know when we think we want to go this way all a sudden we're going this way why are we going this way because God taking us that way amen so okay I said okay I I'll go do the Bible study with you and uh and and so we went to it was a house meeting and there was a pretty good sized home but there was a big floor and I walked in there was all these young people sitting on the floor looked like me had you know had long hair and they were all singing and praising the Lord and I kind of stood back kind of back in the doorway and I was clean the doorway cuz I didn't I honestly didn't understand it I didn't know what was what it was all about and uh there was a man at the time I probably thought he was an old man but I'm sure he was only his 30s you know and he's talking about the Lord and had his Bible and he would he would say a few things and they'd all raise their hands and say amen and then they would sing a song and I'm just standing back there watching this and and uh at the end of the meeting he uh he goes and he knew I was standing back there he I'm sure he go was right there and he goes uh is there anybody that's never met this Jesus Christ and he was looking right at me so I mean he know he knows I'll standing there and I thought hm and I brothers and sisters this is the truth it felt like someone grabbed my collar and took me up there just like that I did not walk up there on my own God brought me up there he led me up there cuz there was something down in here that seed that he had placed all right before time like I told you before time he had placed that seed down in here and he drew me to him you know the Bible says like I said ye have not chosen me but I our Lord and savior have chosen you and that's what he was doing he was making that that pull in my heart and I walked up there and you know to say something before that I thought everything was good young people I thought everything was nice I had a car I had a job was making pretty good money I had a girlfriend who was beautiful you know I was surfing what I love to do things were good what do I I don't need anything else I didn't need anything else every I was happy as could I thought I was happy let's put it that way in myself I thought I was happy but when I went up there and knelt down and gave my heart to the Lord there was a happiness that I never ever ever felt in my life something came down into my heart I didn't at the time again I I didn't know who Jesus was I had no idea what it was all about I had never even read the Old Testament I hardly ever read the the old excuse me the New Testament I hardly ever read the old test Testament you know I'd go to Sabbath school and they would read the Torah what it's called in the Jewish religion the Torah I didn't really want anything to do with it you know so but I felt a happiness in my heart and I remember driving back to San Diego from Ventura I mean I was I was singing a song I was singing some of these songs I really didn't even know what I was singing about but it was just something I was glorifying God and I picked up a hitchhiker and I remember that whole way about 100 miles I was telling this man you know this Jesus this happy and he I I didn't know what I was talking about I had no idea but there was something coming out of me hallelujah amen and he uh I think I always wondered what happened to that man because he got out of the car and he goes well well thank you so I don't know I would have loved to see whatever you never know brother who you're going to touch what you're going to say to somebody you know we are an influence to somebody you know as a deacon I've I've many times I've walked into our church and I've had our brother Don Wilson who's been a deacon in that church for 50 years and he's in his 80s now but he still stands at his post of Duty many a time I've walking in and he's shaking my hand he says brother Lord bless you and that just alone changed my day you don't know what you can say to somebody or you can portray to somebody but you're an influence to somebody you think people aren't watching you they're watching you amen you know the one I want to say this the one sister I live at the one sister I believe she sits right over here and she plays the tambourine and uh last time I was here she was touring and she was going around the church and I thought man I want to get up with her and do that I want to have that freedom that I can do that sometimes I think we get so starchy and so like we we we don't let God move in our lives let him move brothers and sisters God's wanting to move he's wanting to talk to you he's wanting to guide you he's wanting to give you the desires of your heart let him do that let him have his way on your life so they they asked me the the group that I was my friend that was up there he asked me he says they asked me to come and move the uh Ventura excuse me and be a be a part of their Community you know live with them and start going to the Bible studies and stuff so I said yeah that sounds good I mean I I thought yeah so I I moved up there to Ventura and I stayed with them and we would they would I would go to the Bible studies and they would and they would go to the uh on Sundays they would uh go to their most of them were house meetings they didn't really have a a church to go to but it was house meetings and there was was a man that would preach and talk about the Lord and and so I had gone back I had come down to San Diego to see Marcy and she would come up once in a while and we were still you know we were still I was away but we were still we still loved each other how she can say it and so I had come down to San Diego and there was another friend of mine his name was Larry Holland and sister lesie knew Larry and Heidi Holland very well and he had gotten saved and again I was still trying still learning who Jesus Christ was I still didn't you know I I was just trying to the concept of the crucifixion and the blood of of God and how we were how we're Sinners born shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies you know you wonder I didn't do anything wrong no but we were born into Humanity that's right that's just the way it is and that's you know I I didn't I didn't do anything wrong but it was it was started in the Garden of Eden when that m one one lie was said Satan told him her got her to believe one lie and that's all it takes guard yourself brothers and sisters guard yourself from that lie stay in this word right here stay in this word say what our our messenger of the hour has talked about because everything he says is this and everything that's this is what he has said amen there is no difference amen I learned how to be a Christian because of our messenger amen amen I learned how to serve God because of our messenger am he was my great teacher that's right not not not this man right but the logos of God Jesus Christ in the man amen he was a man just like us he had to be saved he talks about when he went to California and he wanted to be a cowboy all right and then God got a hold of him he was born in sin shaped iniquity come in the world speaking lies that's right but he had a special place God was keeping him for a special thing God was going to be that was going to be mouth God's mouthpiece right there and I learned I've learned and I'm still learning every day I read this read this this these book or read the books and hear the tapes I learned stuff every day so I had gone down to San Diego and this friend of mine says I want you to meet somebody I said okay and so he introduced me to Brother David and David had given his heart to the Lord probably a year or two before and uh we know David's testimony how he was brought up in a Catholic uh his parents are very uh Stark Catholic people and that's how he was brought up he I know his testimony talks about his you know being in the church in the Catholic church and doing the things that he did as an altar boy and and those things and uh that that was brother David's testimony and so I met Brother David and uh he would they had a little house over it was on Adam Street I believe it was and uh that changed my life I talked sat down and talked to David you know gifts and callings are without repentance exactly right now this is a man that had just a few maybe a few a couple years before had given his heart to the Lord but there was a calling in his life there was a gift in this man's life this is your pastor talking about now I know David sometimes goes well don't I don't need anything no there was a gift there and that gift was being worked in his life that's right and and that was Jesus Christ working in his life Hallelujah talking through David that's right and I remember I sat there in that room in the in in the front room at Adam Street and David started to talk to me and that gift got to working and he got to tell me some things that nobody knew and I just I remember I went out of there he says you know brother Bill he says there's more to being a Christian than the weekends there's more to be a Christian than being a Sunday Christian there's more to be than being a Wednesday Christian it's an every day 247 affair with God every day should be your Sunday every day every day you get up in the morning should be the resurrection morning I need to thank God for that and he told me he says there's more to living just you there's more to it and he says it's a it's a daily Affair and I sat there and listened to this man I thought wow and again I'm 19 years old and brother David's probably was 22 but he's telling me things that I'm thinking oh my goodness you know there's more to it and so then he says you know would you like to come and move with move in with me move in with us down here in San Diego and something just went inide says yes I would like that I like it i' like to have more of what you got so I went back up to up to Ventura California and I told those folks I was moving of course they didn't like that you know there's someone was a proc slighting there one of their boys you know and but uh God was moving in my life and uh again still trying to figure out everything and trying to know who Jesus was and and I was I was learning more and more all the time the more I read and the and we hadn't heard the message yet hadn't even heard it it was just it was just the Bible and so we move I moved in with David and there was a there was quite a few of us I think there was 20 of us and we had three different houses and and I was in the in the main house and I'll tell you something funny is when I walked into that house and uh it was a two-story house and the and the uh uh the sound in there was uh really nice and all a sudden I David had incense going and uh con uh korian chant music and I walked in I went wow this is heaven and it was just it was it was pretty good it was pretty funny and then of course David you know was doing the best he could because this being a he was a young man too yeah and he was learning more about the Lord and about God we all were he wasn't a newbie like I was but he was still learning we learn every day every day we you know it's like my you know as you as you know as you're as as dads and as you get older you say you always you you know that you don't think you knew as much as you thought you knew you know when you're young you think you know it all and you think you have it all but put together but I know my dad now I look back at he was a pretty smart guy right you know he really knew and he was a real influence on my life and uh I loved my dad and and so I moved in with Brother David and we we uh we'd get together and have fellowship and then Marcy would uh she would course she'd come over and she was happy because now I've given my heart to the Lord and things had changed and and uh and David says you know he says uh give everything to the Lord give everything to God and God will add to you he knows your ways he knows who you are so we kind of broke off our our our boyfriend girlfriend situation because we were trying to to know more about Jesus and so we had a brother a man come by and I don't know some of the stuff with Brother David but this man had come by and he started telling us about the prophet of God and uh he say yeah there's this there's this man you got he's a preacher and you got to listen to him you got to hear what he has to say because he's it's marvelous so all of a sudden I'm still trying to learn who Jesus was now there's a prophet involved and I'm just going wow what is this what's this all about so we went up to we were we got together and we went up to a little place uh outside of San Diego a little ranch type home and and the first tape one of the first tapes that we heard was choosing of a bride which most of you have probably heard and here we are living in San Diego and we felt the ground shaking I mean literally I we thought I thought when we walked outside I was like we were like walking softly because we thought it was going to fall in you know and so I mean it was a couple months there it was and so all of a sudden Brother David you know we brother David would would would think of some of these things but we we he just didn't just do it we would talk about it as a group and he says we're moving we're going to move out of California well where we going we says well Montana we're thinking about going to Montana we all discuss it and the reason we picked Montana because it's one of the largest states in our in the nation but with less people so we just figured that was a good place to go so he called brother uh borders Roy borders who was very close to brother B most you've heard his name on the tapes and he says brother Roy he says we're we're some young people and we've heard the message of the hour and um we're going to move to Montana is there anybody up there in Montana that is is believes this message and he says well there is a brother up there brother Rodney of enoi he said he has a ranch up there and he I've been up there hunting with him before and good good man good brother he loves the the Lord he loves this message so if you can imagine we we had we had we purchased a bus and um my dad used to own a bus company in San Diego and he had a lot of school buses so we were going to buy a bus so I I went to my dad of course my my folks being Jewish they're kind of going what is going on on you know and so we went to uh but they he was they were good and uh went to my dad says Hey Dad we want to buy one of your school buses he says well how much you got and I said and so we've had $2,000 and this was back in 1971 I believe and he says well let me show you what you can get for $22,000 so we walked out to the line of buses and I ke I was looking at the shiny new ones you know I just kept getting du du that one he says that's about what you're going to get for $2,000 I said sold so we bought the bus and my dad goes uh my dad goes well let me let me just uh change the oil on it and get it ready for you to go and we were going to take the bus and take the seats out and make a uh kind of like a you know place where the sisters could have a little place and some some of the sisters had some their babies and and then we uh we had the school bus and we had a VW van and we had David's old Chevy truck with a camper shell on it um and we had my old truck pulling a trailer and there's about 20 of US 22 of us so we go to pick up the bus and and so I'm thinking okay and so I met my dad David I think David and Larry and I were down there we went down to get the school bus and and I knew which best it was remember the number you know so I walked over he says no no no no no no he says you're not taking that one I saidwell that's the one we bought he said no you're taking that one it was up the line it was better but he says well we can't afford that he says no he says I can't let you young people go out in a junk junker like that you know over he knows we were driving to Montana I don't mean a junker but you know what I'm saying not as nice and I said dad I he says no I just want you kids to be safe that was the hand of the Lord yes and I thank my dad for that and uh so we we got the bus and we fixed it all up and uh we sold everything we had we had used to take furniture antique furniture and strip furniture and we had a lot of nice antique furniture in the house and we' we'd buy a piece that was all painted but David David knew he'd take a little knife and scratch it goes that's Oak under there he says we're going to get that and we're going to strip down so we had a lot of nice pieces and we sold everything and and we're heading to Montana and so here we go but something had happened if I I believe this is something with the bank so a brother named Mark and David had to stay back and go to the bank on a Monday morning I believe I believe what happened but we left now can you imagine there's 22 and we weren't a commune we were Christians we were trying to live right you know people say well you were a hippie communion no we a commun we weren't that at all brothers and sisters we were Christians we were trying that the sisters would were dress nice and we were trying to live right we were trying to do the right thing and I you know I always look back on some of this my testimony as and again I told you I like I like to run I like to run mountains and I've done a lot of long 20 M and 30 m runs and you know up high 12,000 ft and 8,000 ft and 9,000 ft and across these ridges and I always look at my life and I'm sure every one of us can look back on our life you know as you're going this way you're not looking back and you're wondering where is this Trail going and I've been on trails that wind around and they go up and they go down and you just go but when you get to a high place and you look back and you go wow look at that trail and I've done that my life brothers and sisters and I've seen God in that my my walk with God I've seen him on that trail guiding me sometimes you just don't know you're just wondering where am I going what am I doing in this life where am I heading let God lead you we must be led by the Holy Spirit don't let some man lead you or some someone influence you that's not right young people every day you get up you should ask Lord where are we going today what are we doing today you know and it's just I I think as I get older I I I look more and more and more for God in my day daily walk you know is it someone at the store is it someone I've had people say things probably I don't know if they're Christians or not say something something and I hear it and it's just something that perks and I go oh that's you talking to me Lord pay attention be aware of what's around you be aware of where you're at be aware who's talking to you God will talk to you he talks to us he's a mysterious God but he's a wonderful God his ways are not our ways and we don't know his ways we're learning his ways but he's wonderful so we took off and and uh David and this brother Mark they stayed back you know I look back at that and we were talking about this the other day we didn't have basically any game plan you know we didn't have an itinerary well we're going to go two days and we'll meet you at this Campground and then we're going to go here we're going to meet you we left and you think you got you got David and he's leaving on a Monday so where we there was no I had no idea we just went we're going to Montana we knew kind of where we were going in Montana but as far as knowing a a game plan we really didn't have a game plan we were trying to do what the Lord want us to do of course David that gift in his life really made a difference because I know that he was listening to God so we got to Montana up there and uh uh we finally I don't even know how we all got together on the way I want to tell this real real quick in this on the way to Montana I was driving a truck and a trailer and it was like a 20 foot uh travel trailer and and uh I got in an accident and I flipped I flipped the truck on the freeway and it rolled several times I just I remember uh what happened and and I hit some soft dirt and I came back up on the up on it was in the desert and it was like 110 out out and hit some soft dirt came back up on the road and there's a big truck right here and I looked out the window and I turned the wheel and I there was myself another sister named sister Carla and Sarah Sarah gast and little girl she was probably five or six I think at that time and and I remember I brought the truck back up with the trailer there trailer I could feel a trailer on the back of that truck just whipping my truck around like this and I thought oh Lord and and I saw this truck I mean it looked like I could just put my hand out the window and there's a big semi truck I could touch it so I turned the wheel like this and the and all of a sudden it caught the tire and I just rolled I remember slow motion just and I could hear go everything break breaking and you know and we came to a stop and I'm like this in the truck and I and I was I was just I was scared to look I said you guys okay and they said yeah we're fine I said oh thank the Lord and so I the windshield in the truck was an old International and it it was kind of a flat windshield it was in you know those windshields back then when they they break and they shatter everywhere and there was a rubber around the windshield and the that was laying brothers and sisters it was laying next to the truck and it had him broken and it was laying in the rubber next to the truck there's no way that that thing didn't wouldn't not have shattered and that rolling I'm telling we rolled a couple times so we got out and it we're just we closed the freeway down this truck sitting there and the trailers opened up and everything spread across the freeway we had David's dog named Abram and the dog is big uh um I forget that kind of dog but a big dog and it was running around the freeway so we had to get the dog and we're standing there people are running up like this and so all of a sudden a higher patrolman comes and he he runs up and he goes where where's the people are they okay are they already gone where's the people and I said you know I'm again I'm 19 20 years old so I'm right here and he goes no no no no he says he says someone someone had to die in this accident' I said no I said there was myself and this lady and this girl and all she had was a little scratch on her shoulder that was it and he said that's a miracle God was watching after us God will take care of his seed I believe that if he calls you if he chose you he's going to keep you that's we that's the scriptures we read right he will keep you and your footsteps of are ordained of God so again what are we fearing don't fear praise the Lord thank the god that he's directing and guiding us so again we didn't have cell phones back then and we didn't have anything like that and so the harman told are you with anybody say oh we have a school bus but I think they're way up the highway somewhere and he says well let me call ahead and see if High patrolman can find them and they'll send I'll send them back for you so they were able to find the school bus way up the highway somewhere and they sent them back and so we we all got we we got gathered up what we could and we put it into the into the uh into the school bus and I think I started driving the VW van we left the truck was was mangled up and the the trailer was totally gone and we just left everything else there but we were we were going on God had us go move on brother sometimes we have to move on sometimes you got to some of those old things that are hanging on and I've had them you've got to ask the Lord please Lord let those things drop off you know that's those are things that sometimes will hinder the being in the presence of the Lord and so we went on and we met somehow we we came together and we were up in Montana and uh uh and we're going to brother Rodney's house I know and so but this man didn't know we were coming I mean that's the thing if you think about that I mean there's 22 young still kind of we we thought we had cut our hair short but it really wasn't short but it was from here to here so we cut I cut a couple inches off you know I thought I had gotten a good haircut and so we uh so Brother David and I think it was brother Larry uh one day they said okay we're going to go go over to brother Rodney's and or we didn't know we didn't know him as brother Rodney was Rodney vanoi and so they they show up at their show up at their front door and uh knock on the door and they're standing there and then I've I've talked to sister vanoi about this over the year last couple years or so and she's kind of said yeah I came to the door and this is again this is 50 years ago she said she came to the door and she kind of peaked out this is these are ranchers these are people that that all they do is they raise cattle they have a ranch so they're they don't live in a big city you know they're out in the middle of the Montana mountains and she said she came to the door and looked out and she goes well there was a couple hippies out at the front door and she says well can I help you she yeah we're here to see uh Rodney of inoi well okay can I tell them what it's about and he says well Roy borders brother Roy borders told us that that he was a man that believed this message and this is we we were coming we're moving to Montana and so he comes to the door and he looks out and he goes yes can I help and Brother David Goes we just come out of [Laughter] Sodom that's Brother David right amen thank you brother David we just came out of Sodom and he goes well brother sodom's just right down here so anyway we got to they took us in lovely people I don't know if any of you ever met them but just absolutely lovely people and they cooked for us and and gave us work and and different things and we worked there and we were living in the the campground and so um let me just so we uh uh I decided Well you know if we're going to move here I mean we got to go to work I I just I was I was raised up that way I said I just can't stand around and I don't mean you know kind of pull off somebody else but I figured well I got to go to work we got to go do something so I drove up to a little town called C Lake Montana and uh I was going to get a job I fig okay I'm going get a job that'll help the Cause right and so I I I went up there and again just the leading of God you know I talk about that trail you know as you look back you just see God's hand in it you see God's hand and moving you and uh you know have I always stayed on the trail no I don't think any of us can say that we've always stayed on that trail we've tried but uh there's a thing called I don't know if you know some of your brothers know about bushwacking and that's when you you get off the trail and you start cutting trying to cut your own trail and I've tried that brothers and sisters it's not good and I've gotten off the trail a few times and you can call it backsliding or whatever you want to call it I never did anything bad but you know you get away from God a little bit in the presence of the Lord and uh and you try to make your own way and I've done that but you know what I've gotten stuck so many times in thorns and stuff and I come out of that I got stickers all over me I said why and the world that I want to go on try to make my own trail and there's a perfectly good trail right here you know and uh done that a few times and I thank the Lord that he's always brought me back to that trail amen he's always he's kept that seed he's going to watch over that seed all right he's going to keep that seed and he's going to watch over it and he's going to nourish it he wants it to grow and we want it to grow and so I went up there to to Sea Lake Montana and uh I I went into the little store co-ops or a little teen town I think there was 500 people in the town it's a little Sawmill town and and uh I walked in the store and I I said again I had uh I think by then I had cut my hair uh I had Marcy had given me a haircut and I was short and and again we weren't boyfriend and girlfriend we had kind of separated our our our our our our relationship at that time time and we were just trying to serve the Lord do the right thing and uh I walked into the store and I said uh uh do you have any work and no we don't we don't have any work we're you know it's a small town and pretty much everybody does you know who lives here has to work in these store Little Stores there's only a couple stores I think two stores and one maybe two gas stations and there's no stop lights I mean if you go through there and blink you'll miss it and uh so I remember walking out on the and sitting down on the stool outside the co-op and uh I said Lord I said uh and I just you know again I just trusted the Lord enough I didn't know a whole lot I was still again I was trying to learn about Jesus and now I'm learning about the message of the hour and I'm trying to put see how the two come together didn't really have a revelation of who brother Brandon was at that time I just knew there was something different about that voice amen when I heard that voice there was just something that that did something down in my heart when I heard his voice when he said good evening friends it's just I don't know you can listen to a lot of televangelists and a lot of radio programs and you listen to those those those those preachers and stuff on TV radio wherever you listen to them but when you hear his voice doesn't it just stir your heart doesn't just make you feel okay everything's okay when you hear his voice you go okay everything's okay now and when he starts to talk and and and the Lord starts to talk through him and that word starts coming out I tell you there's nothing nothing in this world that can compare to that brothers and sisters that's life Everlasting right there that means more to me than anything when you can read or hear his voice and we have still have the opportunity to do that and so something said to me I was sitting there on that bench and something said said to me well just there's a gas station over just walk over to that gas station I mean it was like I heard the voice walk over to that gas station yes sir again this is a town that everybody pretty much what they do is you know they all work either in the woods because there was a lumber a lumber you know they cut Lumber there and they have a lumber mill there and that's this is what the town was and I remember going across the street and walking in that Co-Op gas station and there's a name a man there named red he had bright red hair ha and he was the owner of the station I walked in I looked at him I said sir I'm looking for a job he goes well he said you ever changed oil I said yes sir he says you ever changed tires I said yes sir he says when can you start God was looking out after us amen God was watching my path and so he gave me a job and I was I think the first one in the group that had gotten a job and and so anyway the the the word of God you know I could I could go on there's a lot to more to the story but uh um you know God is good amen and I'm going to read you something here brother brandom said I just read this the other day you know you need to be yourself don't try to be someone else don't try to be the preacher don't try to be Brother David don't try to be brother brother Billy you have a place in this body it's the whole body fitly jointed together right if we ever get to that place brothers and sisters where we really as individuals know our place no telling what God will do the Rapture will happen right that's what brother brandom said if we only get a couple to agree the Rapture would happen and that's what's happening now I think we're as as things we see you know time is coming to an end we've heard the seventh Church chur age messenger there's not another one to come except our Lord and savior there's not another Messenger to come this was the end time Messenger right here am seven Church age the lady was seean church age messenger we're moving on beyond that now we're moving into a Rapture State we're getting ourselves ready for the Rapture every one of us should be looking for that should be Lord what would you have me do what would my what what is my place you think well maybe I'm just a a janitor to be the my my dad told me he says son I don't care what you do in life but if you're a janitor You' be the best janitor there ever was if you're a housewife be the best housewife you've ever been if you're a school person or you go to school or whatever be the best person you know someone's watching you you're an influence on somebody someone's they have their eye on you you don't think so they do they're watching if you especially if you profess to be a Christian they're really watching you then because they want to see you slip if if they're not a Christian if they're a non-Christian they're looking they want to see you slip and they okay ahaha well we all make mistakes there's not a one of us in here that says that we don't make mistakes we make mistakes every day maybe say things we shouldn't say whatever it is God you know that's what the blood's all about amen God forgave us that there's that buffer there that blood in front of the Altar and it's a bumper brother Bram call it like a bumper those iniquities and those little sins and stuff we're not Sinners we've gone beyond that we're not Sinners anymore that's what the blood did it covered our sins we're not Sinners but we make mistakes and we go up against that and it just bounces off that's what we go up against it and it just bounces off aren't you happy about that amen amen I'm happy about that I make a lot of mistakes but brother Bram says here we notice we got so many Billy Grahams today but you see God never made but one Billy Graham that's all he and you're just as important as Billy Graham or Roberts or any of those famous men you're just as important until you get out of your place he's telling us stay in your place until you get out of your place and then you're no good at all you're you're you're a hindrance to to these men and you're a hindrance to yourself and to the kingdom of God stay in your position see stay what God made you see and then you'll operate right as Paul it's not nothing new Paul taught the same thing said if the hand shall say to the eye because I am not of the eye or the ear say to the nose I'll no no more be an ear because I'm not the nose or something you you can't do that see it's all fitly sets together and moves as one great unit and we mustn't try to impersonate anyone just be what you are amen see and that's the way God made you you never fashion yourself and remember as much as we're ministers would like to take Billy Graham's place we cannot do it neither can Billy Graham take our place see we each one has something to do a common little fell here that may be a janitor the little woman that may be a housewife the greatest Minister on the face of the Earth today could not take your place amen you God had a purpose in making you what you are and you just serve God in that way what he made you see and I think if we would just do that the wheels would RAR a little easier yes it would if we would do that not get lifted up amen and I believe that this morning brothers and sisters and I believe that we all have testimonies and I know it's not good to look in a re mirror but sometimes times to think about where you came from to look back on that trail and say man was God in every every event and all the years that I've been a Christian which now is 50 plus years I just I look back and I thank the Lord so God bless you this morning I hope you enjoyed that and I I truly love the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] amen amen praise God you know I was speaking as I was thinking as but Bill was speaking uh just looking at the whole testimony of it just came to my heart to realize these are people that heard the word of God and they were moved they sold what they had and why because God spoke amen why because they heard the voice of God and I can even take it to an extent the reason why we are here is because someone heard the voice of God and it was moved and God came and all of this transpired we live in a time where people are moved by jobs and money and they would move for any other reason except God you know the prophet will say God will speak in sign and things they will do all kinds of things and people are in such a state that all of those things don't move them anymore oh my if we can go back to that place where you hear you believe the word because God moved upon you and I want to say this God is not done moving he moves every day he wants to move so he can do something new he wants to move so he can continue his work they they sold what they had they moved to a new place all of that because they heard the voice of God I want to do the same thing I want God to move upon my heart so I could whatever I'm doing it be God moving and doing what he promised he will do in the end time let's all stand amen amen let's sing that song God it's so good I believe K of f amen oh God is so good God is so so good oh God is so good is so good to God is so good and God he is so good oh and God is so good oh and my my God is so good is so good to oh let he save my
