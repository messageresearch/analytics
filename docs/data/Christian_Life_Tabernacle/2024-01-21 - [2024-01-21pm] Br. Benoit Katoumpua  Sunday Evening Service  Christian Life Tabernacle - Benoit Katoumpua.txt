yield myself Lord Jesus let you take control father and truly we can be happy in your presence Lord Jesus thank you Father I leave the remainder of the service in your hands Lord Jesus asking you to be with your people father Lord granted I pray and ask this in your precious holy and wonderful name amen you want to turn with me real quick to Genesis 17 thank you musicians when you're there Let the church say Amen the scripture reads and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name and more anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for I for a father of many nations have I made thee you may be seated for a moment you know last time we got the chance to to speak to you spoke about which story will you choose and uh we talked about how in one story The Devil Wants to tie it down to your birth and how you came into this world and iniquities Lord came speaking lies and the condition in which you were born which wasn't the the correct condition and then you had the other side which is what God has said of thee and Abraham being the father of our faith you know it it it it struck me in this verse in verse 5 where he says I have made thee not I will make he's the he's 99 years old and the Lord's speaking to him of this of the seed he'll have and how it'll be through that seed that he'll bless the world and so forth and you realize the condition in which he's speaking to Abraham you look at it seriously in 90 something with a kid sums off but he the Lord says I have made thee this is a present tense being this isn't a far off no right now you are I have made thee so and what did he make him he said a father of many nations right and I started started to think on this and as I read the story of Abraham I was sitting in the clever speaking with John just fellowshipping a little bit and we came up start talking about Abraham and started to think about we here's this guy this idolator right he's knows nothing about God he's living the way he chooses to but then God interrupts him where he's at and says you know I'm I'm going to make a covenant with you and this it's not going to have nothing to do with you Abraham it's going to it's I'm making it with you because the last time I tried to have you do something with it you messed it all up so now it's me it's unconditional I'm making the Covenant so regardless of the condition you're in regardless of who how you see yourself regardless of what you see it's what I've said and what I said will be right and and it got it got me thinking a little bit and it brought me to the sermon where brother Brandon preached and Israel and the church number two if you just uh go to that real quick Israel and the church 53326 in [Music] paragraph It's paragraph 24 said notice three stages justification by faith sanctification through the blood baptism of the Holy Spirit then Perfection glorified the Bible said those who he justified this is to the spiritual mind he also glorified is that right he who he justified then if he justified us now we are already glorified in his State not he will he hath glorified say that's deep isn't it but that's what the scripture says God told Abraham I I have blessed you and I've made you a father not I will I have I have made you and you'll come to me in an old age you're going to be saved I've already done it I've already said so you haven't got nothing to do with it it's unconditional and that that it it really Sparks something because I sort of think just just of my life alone for myself often times when I'm reading the scriptures I'm I'm listening to tapes and I'm I'm I'm trying the best I can for what I see to try to make myself into what I'm seeing and there there's a problem in that because anytime it's me trying to do something to have a result it's this it's almost the same thing that that happened with Adam and Eve they were trying to do something and that didn't work and it it it brought a comfort to me to to think about this before I even came into this world God already spoke something over me and I'm I'm here now not not now understanding but beforehand I had no idea what was spoken of me born in the a family raised in the household of the message you listen to tapes you you hear your dad do devotionals your mom speak to you and so forth about the word and you can kind of get lost in that thinking that because you're hearing it and and it's being spoken to you that it's made you something but it's got to be personal it's it's it's got to be something that you receive for yourself right and and I I started to look I said man we we find ourselves sometimes in so many different conditions right you you you have one for for an example if there was a crippled man here with no legs and I told him I said sir in two weeks time we're racing on foot you you look and say well he's crippled he's got no legs see that's how that's how God speaks what you see and what he speaks don't always make sense so you see the crippled man with no legs but God says in two weeks the legs are going to come back and we're going to have that see so we have to start understanding that when we we look into the word when we start reading the Bible we listening to tapes you got to understand that separate yourself put yourself aside it's not about you it's not about your efforts it's in spite of the condition you're in he's going to have a bride it's in spite of the condition you're in he's going to have his way our problem is we want something to do with it we want to get in there and do something well you know I feel like if if if if I don't if I don't come to church every Sunday if if I don't come to church every Wednesday first service and second service then man I I I I I guess I'm not saved all those things are good if you do them but that's not what makes you a Believer right like brother Brandon would say sometimes uh people people claim to be Christians right they they you can put on Christianity you can try to like I look the I'm the best type of Christian I got my suit on I got my tie it looks right right I got everything lined up I look the part so if I look the part maybe I am the part but you know who if you're the part or not when it's just you alone in your room just you alone at the house at work at school wherever it is you know if you're the part right it's it's it's it's it started me thinking man you start reading in your understanding like for Abraham to even believe what he's being told in the condition he's in 99 years old and you're told you're going to have a kid to the carnal mind something's off but we know the caral mind is enmity with God so we don't we don't look to those things and and and often times even I begin to think about some of the conditions that you know people that are close to me find themselves in where whether you've been praying for the sick a loved one that you've had that hasn't you you you haven't seen the the miracle happened just yet you haven't seen the prayer you've been making come to the conditions just seem to get worse the conditions just seem to look like there's no way out they just seem to look like well man it just it keeps getting worse it keeps getting worse remember brother brandom says the scripture will show it that when he was 75 when Abram was 75 that's when the Lord met him and then it was 25 years from 75 until it happened the scripture says he will when when he came to him the LA with uh right before I think it was in mamry if I'm if I'm not mistaken that he told him he said according to the time of life see God made the promise and then the condition was according to the time of life now Abraham didn't know the time of Life all he knew was God said it and but he staggered not at the promise that he was given I wonder if often times when we hear things when we say you know I have a desire to be closer with God I have a desire to see more of God in my life I have a desire for this I have a desire for that I wonder if we murmur in our hearts I wonder if we question it because of what we see that God how can this be how is this possible I've got this this son I've got this daughter that I've been praying for that's not living the way they ought to live but Lord you said they will Lord you you said This Promise is unto me and unto the children and them who are far off but look how they're living I wonder if we start doubting God at times and start questioning but but God never told us the time of life but he's always in season he never fails the same way he interrupted Abraham he'll come where you're interrupt you amen and then I I started to to to think some often times we we we bring up U the fact that Sarah that she laughed when when given the promise and and told she laughed in her heart she said me this this old age that I am but she wasn't wasn't the first one that laughed it was Abraham when God told Abraham the first time he laughed in his heart and said me he said Lord but ishmail is there you know I've already got ishmail and but the Lord told him that's not the air right see sometimes God gives you a promise and you try to make it happen and then a portion of it you might think oh wait maybe it'll come through this path and then you come to realize that's not the way like those that was your effort it looked good at first but it's not the way in which God wanted it to come forth right and and it it it struck me like for I have made thee if we can only understand who it is and hands we are in we're not in just any type of man's hand we're not just in a a regular thing or no we're in Eternal God's hands who knew all things and the sermon who is this mzc brother bam said he numbered he knows each number of hair you got he knows the color there's nothing that eludes him that's the hand we're in so regardless of the condition we find ourselves in regardless of the condition you came into church tonight I really appreciate what brother Matthew preached this morning it it it it really struck me it really struck me because especially when he talked about the faith and the footsteps footsteps of faith and you start looking at it well this word if you're walking in the word then you'll start seeing the things of the word come alive in your life it's no different from what Enoch did the scripture says Enoch walked with God till he left so we have this word that's been given to us now how do we expect to leave if we don't walk in it we've got to feed we got to continue going and it will change us and we'll walk right out of here it it it it brought me to the thought of of Mary when when God and Gabriel is speaking to her and Gabriel says you shall conceive a child and the question she asks she says well how can this be and brother Brandon would say that the Holy Ghost will overshadow you the scripture says the holy ghost power brother Brandon comes behind and he he says it in a in a different way same same meaning he said the Holy Ghost will make it to pass not you will make it pass but the Holy Ghost will make it to pass and I the the way it struck me it was and this this is just how I speak to myself it's like well Ben you got a lot of good ideas so you think you want to do this you want to do that you think you ought to do this you think you ought to do that but really I ought to do nothing nothing but wait if I wait then I'm certain if I'm waiting on God the answer he's going to give me will always be perfect it never misses never misses brother Brandon would say you notice back in the in the same sermon of Israel in the church he says Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of Christ tonight every born again Christian is perfect I'm just as perfect in God as Christ was you are too to every other believer for it's not my Holiness it's his Holiness God can't accept mine I have none but I come in Christ by faith and by Christ I'm in him and perfect in the sight of God look by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and become members of this body in Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but the spirit and a man that's in Christ Jesus walks after spiritual things to the world it's carnal mind it's foolishness but to them that believe it's everlasting life amen there you are oh how marvelous then what can harm you you're in Christ and just as sure as God raised Jesus from the dead will come in Christ amen yes we got to God's done promised it for just as sure as that body goes up I'm in that body I have to go with it the power of a promise we we've got to understand what's been given to us this message was preached a bunch of promises spoken of you spoken about you but it just it remains in the book is so long as you just keep it there but it was never given to us to just stay in the book it was given to us for it to be manifested in our lives that every promise we see we have the right to say Lord you said it I want it give it to me he's Duty bound because he said it about you remember for I have made thee see Abraham didn't see all he couldn't really comprehend everything God was going to do through him but all he knew is Lord you said it and he staggered not and stuck with Lord because you said it I'm going to stay here until it comes to pass brother Brandon would dramatize it and say one week the Sarah are you are you do you have a child yet no okay the next month no the next month no the next month no well it's coming anyhow until it finally came he didn't waver brother B would brother B would go he Abraham probably went to the store and was trying to buy this was trying to get this for the baby and the neighbors and so forth were mocking and laughing at him you're 90s something years old how do you expect this to happen what power do you think is going to make you have this child it's no different from when the devil Whispers to you when you're stuck and you're bound in sin and he tells you how do you expect to get out of this hole how do you expect to for depression to leave you for anxiety to leave you how do you expect for you to get out of this condition this addiction you have you can't seem to get over you try two weeks it comes back how do you expect to get out of it see the devil wants you to forget all all his plan is if he can just make you forget that God already spoke it over you that's all he's looking for if he can get you to dwell on the fact that you know what it's my efforts man I I I can't do it man I've tried I've tried Ben you don't understand I've tried I've tried man I've been at the altar time and time again I've prayed I've prayed I've prayed I've talked to so and so I've talked to so and so but I can't seem to stop you know I I give my best effort you know like you know I deleted it I removed it off my phone I did this I did that but then I download it back two weeks later and it's like man I'm trying B you don't understand I don't know how to stop God never asked you to stop C can can you imagine it's always eluded me why brother Brandon with the man that had a cigarette problem would go and buy him cigarettes to give it to him I'm like in this day and age what but he knew what he was doing he knew that that brother got a True Deliverance one that you could tempt him with as many cigarettes as you wanted to he wouldn't waver that's the kind of Deliverance God does see when it's you trying to deliver yourself when it's you trying to get rid of something in your life your own efforts it it might hold you for a year it might hold you for a pretty good long time but over time you'll start to waver you'll start to fall and you'll see man I thought I got delivered but I don't think I really did well you never really surrendered if you truly surrendered and you left it in God's hand you would see a complete change it's just I I want us to focus on conditions and and bring it down to where you're at in your condition remember like I said the devil has one motive if he can get you to be stuck on your own efforts on something that you can do then as he's doing that what he's causing you to do is you become numb when the minister is up up here speaking to you telling you that this promise is yours you don't have to be bound by this you don't have to be bound by that you don't have to be bound by that time and time again I remember sitting in that seat Matthew Billy Brother David preaching about things that I was bound by and saying you don't have to be bound by that and I'm just hearing it but it's not really sinking in because you have that other voice in your head saying man when you get out of here all you got to do is just delete it just get rid of it just do this just do that just do this just do that when all I really had to do was just fall and say Lord have your way whatever it is have your way whatever you need to do if you've got to sheer me clean whatever it is that's got to happen Lord have your way but I can't see my own I don't want to see anything that I can do I don't want to see anything that I can muster up anything that I can do by My Own Strength my strength fails me but Lord your strength in my weakness your strength is made perfect and you you you start to read and and continue reading when when when when something strikes and just condition and it it got me thinking of some of the places that I've been I some of you could attested this when David made the cry though I make my bed in hell you're there like if he hadn't have spoken over over me if he hadn't have said for I have made you about me where would I be bring it down to yourself where would you be though you make your bed in hell he's there because he spoke it about you unconditionally which he removed you from the equation the moment he said I make this Covenant with you so regardless of how far you go I will pull you back amen now how you come back you can kick against the PRI but he's going to get you one way or another you can come by walking you come by crawling in a Stretcher whatever the case may be but he's going to get you if he spoke it over you he is Duty bound to get you he goes and I want to go to the uncertain sound preached in 19 if I'm not mist Aken 1960 128 and I I I really just want us to to really understand that regardless of the condition you see if God said it it has to happen brother Brandon would say Abraham I heard that you said you was going to have a baby paragraph 308 I heard that you're going to have a baby he he he he that's an uncertain sound see but Abraham had done heard another sound that downed all that out glory to God I don't care how long he waits going to have it anyhow how you know Abraham God said so now he did God come down and talk to you yes how you know let me hear him he talked to me not you oh my Hallelujah that that that's comforting that's comforting Oh my he talked to me not you well go on said go on you old unbeliever you don't believe anyhow I believe him see so just keep on going that's it going to have a baby anyhow 25 years passed but before that time come they was teing and laughing God said you know what I'm just going to make you take you away from them pack up all your clothes and things get ready get out you know often time when God gives you a vision of something or something that he wants you to come to right he he gives he gives you the end result which is what you know what brother B would preach and he said when God saw you in this day he saw you perfect see he gives you the end result but then then he starts ministering onto you how to get there and part of getting into that Perfection is separating right sometimes you you can't you can't receive what God has for you cuz you're in the wrong Company the company you're with is holding you back so when you're making all these efforts make you're trying to do this you're trying to do that and it keeps failing stop and look who am I around who's in my life what is it that I'm doing am I feeding the way that I ought to am I doing this your eyes and ears are to Gateway To Your Soul what are the things that you're doing and how is that going to affect the end result right he says pack them up separate yourself from that bunch of unbelievers I'm going to give you a little church over here some people will believe you get away from that Old cold formal denominations get out of here walk with me alone God never blessed him till he completely did that separated himself from all unbelief and he'll never bless you till you do the same take all them old superstitions away from you maybe it's so maybe it's not if you come to be prayed for this morning you come with the real faith God said so and that settles it that's it God said so that's all there is to it God said so he said it and that settles it don't have no more fuss about it think about it all right and and often times that's I can only speak of of myself often time this is this really what happens you hear it God said so and you start fussing about it you hear him say this is what you have to be this is what you will be I've made you thus and then you start thinking man how am I going to get there you know I'm fighting with this I'm struggling with this I'm man I just I just don't see how my path is going to align there but and all that's for not you're thinking incorrectly it's not how are you going to get there it's how when and how is he going to get you there it's his job to do that he is the one that made the promise with you so because he made the promise he has to take you from where you're at but you can't be taken from from where you're at lest you realize where you're at if you think you're good if you think you're living right you think you're acting right you're thinking you're in the condition that you should be in but you know you're not that's a dangerous place to be you no one can be helped in the state of believing I'm a Believer but still one the other foot out the door you think you're doing everything right when you come here you fit the part the moment you leave you're somebody completely different you don't know what condition you're in it's the condition of the age you're luk War the scripture says he spews you out of his mouth if you're lukewarm in order for you to understand I am in the wrong place I need to get out of here you have to think the place you're in is wrong but if you don't think it's wrong you'll dwell there you'll stay there well you know what I you know I you in times past the reason why you know I I couldn't have this happen is because you know I would look at this and I would do this and do that you know now I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to unfollow those people and then uh I'm going to start doing this instead dead but you still left that gate open you still allowed him to enter in somewhere as long as long as you give the devil just a small door soon you'll find out it's wider than you thought because it's just a little bit all he needs is a little bit God wants us to be fully surrendered fully surrendered and trusting in Him that's what he he's called us to in this day when the prophet of God would speak and say we're living beneath our means what does that mean we're not sold out the way that we we we used once was we have so many cares of this world so many things that bother us and take up real mental real estate in our mind that have absolutely nothing to do with us I think Time and Time what am I going to do when I'm 40 I'm not 40 what am I thinking about all all I need to be thinking about is right here and right now Lord what is it you have for me right now we'll cross 40 when I get there Lord willing but right now what is it that you have for me right now if we can get our mind to the right now then we can start attacking those issues that we face right now as long as we keep looking forward we drag and hold on to things because our eyesight's wrong but Brandon would say that people always know what God's going to do what God has done but fail to see what he's doing it's a true condition of the age we often look forward and back but we don't see right now how do I expect to get there if I'm not there now now they say the best image or the best example that you have of what you'll be 10 years from now is who you are now we ought to bring that down spiritually you want to be this spiritual person that that God just uses you that every time you speak that it's God speaking and so forth you understand in order to get there there's a sacrifice it's it's a die to S where lord it's not me but it's you you speak you have your way amen though I think of these things and so forth no it's not about that Lord what would you have me do could we live that way where we say Lord you know what before I go outside and get this gas is it your will no but I need gas no my car is empty I need gas but Lord is it your will would you have me go who knows where are the Miracles what if you prayed and your tank was filled up Lord so it be let it be let it be let it be see we we often just stick in this realm all we see is man you know I got to go get in my car I got to drive I got to go over there I got to pump the tank I got to do this I got to do that I got to do this and you realize all the devil's trying to get you to do here he wants you to glorify your own efforts but as long as you're glorifying your own efforts you will never see what it is God wants out of you because all you'll see is I've done this and this happened I've done this and that happened but put that aside put down that I've done this and said Lord by your grace what is it that you would have me to do Lord I've done this because you asked me to do this I've gone this path because you've asked me to do this I was listening to a sermon uh last week when brother brandham gives the example of the um the woman with the picket fence and how when he walked out of that plane he just started walking just not knowing where he's going but just being obedient and listening turn this way turn that way hello Parson how'd you know I was a Parson right you start seeing like wow man I wish some of that stuff happened to me well get out of the way and it will the problem is we're in the way wh why do I got to turn there this is the ghetto this is this there's so much stuff there man I don't want to be over there I want to be where the rich are at Let Me Be Where the money's at I want I want to be over on this side but the scripture tells us that it's hard for a rich man to enter into heaven than it is for a cam to enter into eye of a needle right so sometimes what the way in which God wants us to go categorically goes against what we think just just settle that now God maybe what you would have me to do goes against what I think but if it's your will I don't have to worry about how it'll happen you said it I believe it you'll bring it to pass he's Duty bound he has to let's go to uh sermon faith in 5685 starting in paragraph 24 he says why it's not what we are but what Christ is for us Christ become you and I that you and I might become him he taken our sins that we might take his righteousness so it's nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling nothing I could do nothing you could do it's the grace of God then God tried man one time and made a covenant with man upon a condition if you not touch this tree then you'll live forever and man broke his Covenant man just can't keep his promise to God oh man his adversary is too great and God knowing that he was determined to save man stop here for a moment he said then God tried one time made a covenant with man upon a condition if you'll not touch this tree then you'll live forever and man broke his Covenant man just can't keep his promise to God his adversaries too great and you realize the very condition the devil wants you to be in is a constant promising things to God lord I promise I'm going to do this when I leave here I promise I'm going to get to it I'm finally going to go I'm going to take that TV that I have I'm going to beat it up I'm going to kick it out I will and the moment you leave and you don't do it now you feel ashamed now you feel like Lord I've disappointed you man Lord you know I've done this Lord you know I should have just listened I should have just done that the devil's so good I remember times I would be on fire here but the time I got from here to that door everything changed I went from fire to lukewarm in an instant the devil's happy with that cuz while I was there I'm making all these promises I'm going to change I'm going to be better I'm going to do this but I forgot that my adversary was too great I'm not fighting a mere man I'm fighting somebody that's got got 2,000 years of experience he knows what he's doing he knows that so long as you're making the promise like brother Matthew said this morning you have a weapon in your hand you don't know how to use it see the weapon's the word right you don't have to make a promise when you remind god of what he said then you don't have to prom you don't have to promise anything he said it it's his promise he keeps his word we don't so when you find yourself in that state where you're thinking man Lord I I I how to do this how to do say no Lord you said your prophet spoke and said if there's more if I desire more of you there's more of you to be found because you said that and this is my desire Lord bring it to pass then he moves he does it but if it's your own righteousness your own thoughts your own ideas of what you think you need to do let's not be mistaken the Devil is a worthy adversary for this time but he does not stand compared to our champion when he said it is finished it doesn't matter what condition you're in it doesn't matter what you're fighting it doesn't matter the devil's in your life it doesn't matter where you see yourself it doesn't matter if you're knocking at the door of hell and saying give way let just let me in just let me in it don't matter how far you've gone there is nothing that's gone too far when he spoken I have made thee that word saying I have made thee it's it's it's promise going forth it gets a hold of you you can't let go you're not holding on to him he's holding on to you but the devil wants you to think that you're holding on to him so every time you fall you think oh no I let go of God I got to go and pick him up I let him go no you didn't let go of God you can't let go of him you never chose him in the first place he chose you because he chose you he's Duty bound to take you from where you're at to where he wants you to be all you got to do is surrender say Lord have your way whatever it may be have your way Lord take take control Glory let it be all to you Lord Jesus I I think we we we we really are to understand like like brother Brandon would say that in this day and age that we have to understand the devil and his tactics that's part of the reason the word came so you can see how the Devil comes to you brother B would say he doesn't come to you you know with horns and uh whatever you call that fork and so forth that's not how he comes he's not red that's that's not the devil but he comes to you in a nice suit it might be blue it may not be blue whatever color it is that he comes in you got to be honest the Devil comes to you in whatever manner he knows where you're weak at he knows so if you're a fenine Believer he might send you somebody that's a little bit over that fence and then they'll start putting certain ideas in your mind well you know brother brandham wasn't on Sunset mountain when you know all that stuff that he says happened happened he was actually over here hunting you know I was this is just my understanding you know the bridge where people fell you know there was no newspaper that showed where that many people fell so I don't know you know the word says that if what a prophet says if it comes to pass then know he's a prophet if it doesn't then qu well you know he said this but I don't see proof of it where is it at and if you're not anchored you will see these things and you'll step back you'll say you know what he's right that I I don't see those people that died I don't see any mention of him anywhere you know he's right Brothers they they said they they were hunting with him when the sunset Mountain situation happened you know he's right but I've I found it funny brother Brandon would describe to us how hard his life was and how reality and divisions for him were Blended so what's it to you if he's over there but he's over there so what's it to you oh no but he physically he was here yeah I'm telling you he was here but he was physically at home as well when he told you I saw you in a vision this morning checking the thermometer of your baby and it was at this how did he see it he wasn't in your living room so how did he see it God didn't tell me to explain away the things that he did did why they said he was here and yet he says he was here if he said he's here for me that's as good as done I don't got to worry about that he didn't tell me to worry about it he just said believe it it's it it's a real danger speaking you talk about the devil being a worthy adversary who really understands who really knows where and how to get you he knows sometimes when you go to camp when you go to these powerful meetings and you get so filled up it it it put oh man you know what I'm going to go out there I'm going to beat all them Devils man any of them come big horn or not I'm chopping him off oh he's gone he's not going to in my presence he's as good as done he's finished and the littlest devil peeps his head oh that's nothing but a little cat that's just a little dog I don't have to worry about him that's just a little puppy that's just like that puppy's not going to do no harm to me but then brother Bon would describe you of the chief that said well you know I've got two dogs in me I got a black dog and I got a white dog and they wore against each other and he says well which one wins well the one Chief feeds wins so yeah that devil might be a little puppy now but you keep feeding him he'll become a big dog and you think because you cut his head off that that's it you know brother Brandon would the the scripture would say that when God delivers you and gives you Deliverance the spirits leave the house is empty now you've got to fill it if you don't fill the house then you'll get more than what you bargain for on the other side so what we need to do when we have those Services where you're spoken to where you feel it like you know what God you're speaking to me it's gone to where I'm at you've came to my seat you know often times I hear Brother bam say the spirit's over there it went to that seat she Drew him there I remember you drew him to your seat when when you feel it's like man he's preaching about me everybody knows it's me if I stand up oh done they're going to know it's me they're going to think this they're going to criticize me they're going to do this they're going to do that well I'm just going to say this I'm sorry if they criticize you they got to check their own spirit because people really need help people are really crying for something and it's the spirit of criticism right you you might be hindering them you may be the reason they don't want to come to church well if I go there they're going to look at me this going to look at me that way going to do this and if you if you're on that side of doing those things you ought to make it it right because what was it that saved you not your own merits not your own efforts not your own strength not your own ideas the very one that saved you that person that you know that's struggling and fighting they have a right to be saved by that same person so in in in instead of criticizing instead of judging instead of making fun instead of pushing them aside why not like man I I love what Matthew preached this morning be Jesus to that person you go to them you say sister I want to pray with you brother I want to pray with you let's just get down and pray we can't make it on our own we need one another it goes it continues on he says adversary was too great and God knowing that he was determined to save man so he made the Covenant unconditionally oh brother the trouble of it is with the Full Gospel people tonight you're scared that how can anything happen to you how can those who he fornew he predestinated those who he he has predestinated or forne he called those who he called he has Justified and those who he justified he had already glorified so quit being scared God's the one that's driving the ship not you and I we're just to stay on it amen God made a promise God keeps his promise no matter how ridiculous it seems God keeps it oh Hallelujah my goodness that's wonderful no matter how ridiculous it seems like the example I gave you a crippled man with no legs racing in two weeks on foot that's ridiculous but it doesn't matter how it looks he made the promis amen because he made the promise it's his job to bring it to pass and I just when I started to think about Abraham and all all that he must have been thinking the the battles the devil must have brought to him like man you're 90 years old you're you're wrinkled you're like how are you gonna how you going to have this kid but brother bham said Abraham never looked at the his condition he never looked at where he was at he just believed because God said it that God was Duty bound to do it so tonight I I challenge each and every single one of us whatever our condition is whatever condition we find ourselves the accomplishes we have in our mind the trials I don't care if you've been praying for healing for five six years and you don't see it I don't care if you've been stuck in depression stuck in anxiety what whatever the spirit is Spirit of lust pornography whatever that spirit is that's got you bound it doesn't matter how long it's had you Bound for the scripture says in in the time of life when he comes right God works things his timing is perfect it never fails so you may think you know I've done too much I've went too far I've gone too far and I I I've been there where it's like Lord I I I made my stand for you Lord I I I said I want to live for you and then I looked at myself and I'm like man how could the stand you said the stand you made look at you look at how you're living and the de the devil wants to point out it's my effort it was in my immaturity of thinking because I had that experience that that that was all that I needed there was nothing more to be done on my part oh now you know now that I got this experience I can go out I can testify and do this and do that and the third and so forth but Christ knowing all things himself said I do nothing lest the father show with me first so it doesn't matter how supercharged you are with the word and inspiration and and and hunger to do something for God there's a season and a time for everything so what we need is to take that condition that we have place it in the word and said Lord you made an uncondition Covenant with me why are we scared why are we scared is does the condition seem too great do we think it's too impossible for God to do it's gone on too long we tried our best we gave our best effort Lord I've done all that I can Lord you know I've given it everything all my efforts father I've done it all that's good keep going no Lord you don't understand I've I've literally done all that I can do like there's nothing more I can do keep going you're not there yet Lord I I'm you I have no other effort to give keep going you're not there yet you see the thinking I've done all that I can do Moses had to learn that lesson he knew what was promised of him and he tried it on his own but God didn't use him until he really couldn't do nothing so maybe where God's trying to take you is he's got to break you so much to a point that you realize you know what Ben your effort are for not you can't do it when you get there then you say Lord my strength is done I have need of thee you be my strength you be the one that does it I yield myself have your way father whatever that way is Lord father I've tried it my way I've tried it the best I can it hasn't worked so Lord what's your will that's where God wants to get each and every single one of us to that point where we say Lord have your way when you get there that name change will happen you'll go from Abram to Abraham sinner bride he'll be the one that does it remember he gave him the promise when he was 75 I believe and 25 years he visited him periodically during that time just watching they probably had more faith that it would happen or you would think they had more faith that it would happen when they were 75 a little bit younger still old but a little bit younger but I I dare to believe that when Abraham got to 99 he had more faith that it would happen because as the condition got worse and worse and worse and it seemed so impossible God said this man here he's not wavering let it let if it was a 100 years wait he's not wavering his faith is just going to keep growing and growing and growing and growing and growing I wonder if we look at our trials that way come on man I've been fighting for 10 years I've been fighting for soul I'm fighting for this yeah you have but that miracle that Supernatural event that's about to take place it'll be more of a testimony the fact that you've waited so long for this than it would have been if it was given to you like that what's he teaching you patience wait wait wait Lord I don't understand I've I've I've waited long enough as long as I think I can wait no no no you're stronger than you think he wants to pull characteristics out of you and his way of doing that is by trials yes so your condition is nothing more than God showing you where you need him no matter the condition he's just trying to show you where you need him he he wants to get you to completely trust and surrender everything you've got to him there's really nothing that I can do I get the chance sometimes to see some of the stuff that Matthew Billy and Brother David go through when they have to get back here and preach you would think they had this great big servant but they had one word you talk about a surrender and letting God speak through you every single one of us you don't have to be here to have that same surrender God gave you one word bride in that word is all you need it's his job his job to Quicken that to you that you realize no it's it's not just the passing phrase bride no but I really am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am him though I can't see it now but he said it and I can rest assur knowing the fact that he said it he'll bring me to it where I can see it manifested if the musicians will come I want to read to you just in in closing scripture in Psalms I believe it's 139 and put put yourself in the scripture oh Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my downsitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou compassest my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it all together thou has beset me behind and for and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is too high I cannot attain unto it whether shall I go from thy Spirit or shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou are there if I take the wings of morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the dark shall come over even the night shall be light about me yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for though thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in the book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are they are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee so tonight I I challenge you especially what what you heard this morning and how the Lord's dealt with you in this service if you find yourself unsatisfied it's it's it's it's it doesn't have to be that you're in a sin condition but if it's just you feel like you're stagnant in your walk with God you're not really going anywhere you're not sinning but you also feel like you know there's there's more I feel like I got to break more ground whatever the condition is whatever the condition is understand that God promised that whatever you desire there is there for you if it's more of God it's there if it's healing it's there if it's Deliverance it's there amen whatever it is that you have need of and if you happen to be in that place I I've been there so I I can really sympathize where you you don't like what you see in the mirror you hate every part of it you say this man is going to send me to hell if I keep listening to this man he's going to send me to hell if you find yourself in that place and you don't know how to you know I try I I really do try my best but it's just not good enough if you find yourself there just in your seat you don't have to come to the altar in your seat be real with God show him yourself he knows your condition it's not a surprise to him he knows but he wants you to confess it and you ask him to come where you're at in your seat and you say Lord you spoke spoken over me and I don't know how you're going to do it I don't know when you'll do it but I just know I refuse to leave this building the same way I came if you truly have that desire in your heart and that's truly what you want I believe without a shadow of doubt before you leave that building you'll leave with something real but if you push it off and you say I know my condition's bad but I think I can manage to get out of it you can't you can't that's where the devil wants you he wants you to think you can get out of it but you you you can't I don't know if if if any of you have ever had an addiction to something I got a neighbor who's been like family to me addicted to smoking since I was in Middle School took me out all my practices took me to paid for so many different things helped my family a lot and she was always honest with me she would tell me all the time Ben I don't want to smoke I really don't I hate it but I can't [Music] stop that breaks my heart she wants it so bad so bad I pray for her give her words of encouragement you don't have to stop he'll stop it by all means keep going you just keep feeding and you watch he's going to take a hold of that and he'll remove it out of your life and now she's she's got cancer and and so forth and she she telling me says you know Ben I I deserve this I knew what I was doing and the consequences of it I wonder if we don't have spiritual cancers of our own that we know that we fed and it's gotten to the place that it's gotten to because we fed it and now we're at the physician's house saying oh great physician you see the condition I've put myself in you see what I've done this is you didn't do this Lord I I put myself here but Lord I need you to get me out you know I I I didn't I didn't get the chance to read it but brother brandham says in that sermon Israel in the church that God doesn't turn away anybody that comes to him so if you find yourself in that condition he won't turn you away he never has and he never will anybody that comes to him he doesn't turn away brother Billy if you could come just bow our heads in [Music] prayer Heavenly Father Lord in all honesty I preach to myself Lord [Music] Jesus but father if by your wonderful Grace Lord if somebody else happen to find themselves in in a condition that they don't like Lord Jesus they don't have to stay that way father you made a way Lord Jesus a provided way Lord you told us that if we would just surrender it to you father you would take control of it Lord Jesus the devil's a lie Lord he's nothing but a bluff that thing that's holding you and hold for so long it's not as strong as you think it's only strong because we're the ones fighting Lord but father if we just surrendered it to you Lord Jesus father what could stand before you Lord Jesus not even cancer can stand before you Lord Jesus whatever sickness whatever disease whatever bondage Lord whatever the condition if it's 25 years fighting that same condition it doesn't matter how long it's been fighting Lord in your presence all must cease Lord Jesus we know in whom we believe in Lord Jesus father we ask you tonight Lord Jesus you can change the atmosphere Lord change the condition Lord Jesus change the Mind truly the change of condition only happens when the mind's been renewed Lord father renew the minds of your people people Lord Jesus help them Lord Jesus help us father to Look to You Lord not to us father our righteousness are but filthy rags Lord Jesus but father the one that died for us You Paid It All Lord Jesus when you said it was finished father you meant everything every devil every demon every complex it was finished Lord Jesus all we've got to was believe on what you said Lord Jesus father you spoke it before we were ever here father I wasn't here when Genesis was written I wasn't here when Revelation was written I wasn't here when all these books was written but they were written about me Lord Jesus written about your people Lord Jesus father how mindful you are Lord Jesus even when this message was being preached father I wasn't there Lord but Lord you knew that I would have need of it Lord Jesus [Music] in fact you made it so personal you said behold I send you Elijah the prophet Lord Jesus father thank you for what you've sent me Lord Jesus father help us to be able to take the words that he spoke Lord Jesus not just for words of just aand father but it's you speaking to your bride Lord Jesus it's the very power that changes the believer Lord Jesus feeding on your word Lord help us Lord Jesus help your people tonight Lord Jesus father I know how bound a person can get Lord where they they think there's no way out no one understands they speak about how just letting go men that they don't understand how hard it is to let go I've tried I've tried I've tried I've tried all my efforts are for not Lord Jesus father give them the revelation of what it really means to let go Lord Jesus letting go is nothing more than saying be it unto me according to Thy word Lord Jesus Grant it to us Lord Jesus bless your people father I ask this in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen could you play it reaches to the highest [Music] mountains the [Music] blood the

of God Amen regardless of conditions Oh I thought it went so well with what was preached this morning regardless of condition you know the Devil comes and you're not good enough for the promise and you did this you did that the promise was made for all that would believe believe regardless I was thinking as our brother was speaking Yeah is Abraham given a pro a promise at 75 and not until a 100 what was that period of time what was it and if you go read your Bible you'll see that he tried all kinds of stuff he did this he lied over here did God was waiting until he's completely dead to his own ideas he let him try whatever he wanted he let him it's not until he was complete in fact I would even it was in the natural until he knew that even in the natural there was no chance right then God comes and he said I am here to give you life it's according to the time of life now remember when you read the text it said I have made the this is not Abraham's life this is the life of God in Abraham so he God didn't want the life of Abraham to be mix with God's life because he was going to say oh I have a part to play with it God don't want us to have a part to play with it he wants us to believe he wants us to die to ourselves he wants us to completely surrender as our bir was just emphasizing the promise is made when God made the promise he didn't take into consideration oh well what if this particular case comes up what am I going to [Music] do it was all taken care of it was all part of the promise whatever situation shows up my promise will remain true when God gives you his word is a complete product it's it's it's done it's sealed it's completed it's going to manifest itself in the time that he wants it to manifest we're the one that's fighting with ourselves we we have our ups and we have our down and today we think we have we are in we inherit the promise and tomorrow we think we lost it that's all part of the human nature of the human and what with what our brother was saying is we need to overcome that by by moving from just being a human and enter into this level into this atmosphere where God is calling us by his Spirit to understand that when he's giving you the promise the promise will remain forever he didn't say I'll give it to you and then I'll take it back no I have done this oh he talked about the power of the promise and and this is perhaps one of the very promise that you know when I every time I read the message I just never can help myself with but when I'm asked the question he said how did Jesus come he said it was by A Promise by the words of a prophet he said a son shall be born he will be given unto you he will come and he will save the people from their sin how is the bride going to come by the words of a prophet well if God spoke through the words of a prophet and Jesus came and he died and he resurrected and did all of those things the same God by the words of a prophet can't bring a brighter amen he'll do the same he the same yesterday today and forever I like that example of the woman in Memphis because I thought it just goes so well together with what was spoken this morning she saw the parallel in the Bible I was was Barren that's what the scripture says this woman was I had trouble having kids she was the same and she looked at it she followed she said this is the parallel now I need the Paradox she went and waited on the fence for the Paradox to come by away right isn't that what the prophet told us whatever your situation is go take the Bible find a matching characteristic you find it you say this is me yes I don't care if it's job I mean I'm talking extreme now this is me oh I can you know when everything is going well it's it's it's it's you want you can't understand the Book of Job absolutely not I mean you can read it as a story but it's when things are not going well that you start to see the parallels right oh wow oh wow now I can see this and then you take it you say God I I see the parallel in this now I'm waiting for you to come and take me from what I am and use the Paradox so you can bring the word out of me we don't we don't make ourselves believer he makes us Believers we don't save ourselves from our sins he saves us from our sins we don't heal ourselves he heals us and all he ask us to do is believe it's not to look it upon one another some small some big no we are all one people purchased by one blood when we see someone struggling we help them we go after them we do because we understand it was by the grace that was extended to us that's why it happened you want the same Grace to be extended to another oh I pray this tonight if we could just come in understand that the same God is here to make his promise true he's the one who make made the
