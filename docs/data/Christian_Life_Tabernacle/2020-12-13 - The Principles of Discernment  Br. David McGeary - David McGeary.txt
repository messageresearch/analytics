you to be with us this evening in Jesus precious and holy name we pray pray amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to a scripture and and uh we'll um kind of use this as a a TI poost or I think what they the world calls it as a a a segue right is that what it is where you where you go from one thing to the other you time them together anyway so uh let's just read this and and it says uh in Luke the uh uh 6th chapter and and the 42nd verse or let's start with the 41st verse and he said in Luke uh the 6th chapter and the 41st verse and why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but perceiveth not the beam that is in thine own eye that's a little bit there about self discernment okay neither how castest neither how canest thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the moat that is in thine eye when thou thyself self beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first The Beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to pull out the moat that is in thy brother's eye Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this to us this evening in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated we're just going to finish up the tape this evening and make a few uh comments but uh I I just would like to say this maybe I don't have a uh really have much of a title for today's message but I I think that that scripture uh kind of relates to the principles of discernment you know what the principles are of when you discern if anytime you have discernment the first place it always should start is with yourself you know to take an honest and hard look at yourself and as we uh went through this message we we noticed that brother brandham said uh several things in on paragraph 11 he made this statement he says now now we do have and I think it's a good thing for us as ministers to F to follow our order now he wasn't talking about an order like the order of the Knights of Columbus or the order of this he was talking about a order you know a command by God to do something he says I think it's important we should follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have an order from God is for the Discerning of spirit try the spirit I believe that's a very good lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of spirit so that's our order and that's a good order is to try the spirit of everything so now we have the principles of discernment in other words what are you looking for in something you know what is it good I I like to go to the store and when I walk down the store I like to see people reading labels and uh uh and I'm sure they read the label every time but you you wonder what are they looking for you know it's SpaghettiOs you know what do you look for in a can of Spaghetti House you know it just tastes good it's not good for you you know it's a filler but they're looking for the sodium content you know or they're looking to see if it has a glucose or or uh gluten or or something in it you know they're looking for something they're Discerning something because what they're Discerning is trying to figure out what effect it's going to have on them and and that's Discerning of can goods how much greater is the Discerning of spirits in other words what effect is this Spirit going to have on me what what is the purpose of the spirit and everything I always wonder what was the purpose I I I sit back and think of it because I know that God allows things you you understand that's the way God works God allows the law of contrast he allows things to come up to be in contrast he allows a test because a test is what tries you and shows what you're really made out of when you're put to the test you know in other words if everything goes long maybe you're a person that takes the easy way that's just your nature Well when things are easy you're just cruising along everything's good you have fellowship with everybody and all of a sudden things get tough and things get difficult if you take the easy way well we know the easy way the easy way is to listen to somebody on online you know or stream what we say and sit down have your coffee stay at home and stream the hard things to come to the house of the Lord but if you're you're an easy way and then if you have a preacher that might call you out for just sitting back and being afraid of the virus and stepping out of your position in the body and just falling off you know what you do you change the channel yeah one believer ask another believer he says he says have you streaming service and he says yeah streaming service I got streaming service I got Netflix and I've got a hola and and and I I've got something else I mean that that that was his streaming service you know you know are you streaming service yeah I got streaming service I got these things well that's what happens out there you see in other words the church is turned into a TV channel you just you turn this guy on you turn that guy on you turn that guy let me tell you something if you if this little virus that I could testify I got uh uh our brother uh Banks's wonderful testimony how God healed him Moses's wonderful testimony how God healed him uh Banks I got to sit Banks back down I didn't have time to hear his whole testimony so I read the back page and I got the front page and now I'm going to go back and listen to the rest of the book but if that has got you in this condition I say you think this come on is is strong it's going to get a lot worse than this it's going to get a lot worse than this everybody's asking me if I don't take the vaccine what's going to happen well I don't know they may have a guy standing at Walmart only letting people in with a vaccine card you won't be able to get on a plane without a vaccine card they're just conditioning people they're conditioning them get into the condition of compromise and and that's the spirit behind what is happening with this it's the spirit of compromise oh they might act like it's their life but the Lord told us don't be afraid of him that can destroy your life be afraid of him that can destroy your soul that can destroy your spirit that can take the fellowship out of the church and the character of the church a spirit that makes you think it's not important that you're there you're more more important is your job than being at a post of Duty where your prayer might be the difference to save a soul I mean that's that's discernment of spirit that that that's really you know what I mean when it IT crosses the gospel I say one thing about our governor thank God we've got the governor we've got cuz if we would be in Oregon the the governor in Oregon you know and God will deal with her accordingly but she tells everybody call the police on your neighbor right well when this first thing happened we had the police show up someone called the police on us you know what are they gonna do you know the contrast and the conflict is coming because the prophet of God said this is thus sayeth the Lord from the prophet of God anytime the spiritual and the carnal meet there is a clash go look it up that's what he said it it's not going to be avoided but but the the this spirit is already softening you to give you a a way out you know and and I know people are afraid you know I I I I haven't had it I thank God for it I've been around a lot of people that had it I've lived with people that have had it thank God the Lord's been good to me and I may get it if it's my time to go home I'm going to go home but God cannot not take you off the scene until he's done using you so the best safety that you have is to be about the father's business be in service for God and God will protect you because you're fulfilling his word get out of service for God and and I don't care The Watchman watches in vain if God doesn't watch the city if God's not going to save you and God's not going to keep you then you get it and if you do get sick he'll get you through it if he's done with you then what good is it do you to live but we're talking about Spirit and the discernment of spirit and and what the motive and a vector what's that Spirit doing what effect is it having stand back and look at it and and so we're talking about Jesus referred to it as the beam or the so like I would take this scripture and I would say now I I'm talking about the virus and the effect I've got to say what effect is it having on me before I go after you about the effect it's having on you I've got to remove the effect that it's having on me first you see so the beginning of discernment is self discernment and that that's the principle of discern discernment is discernment always starts with self because if you don't start Discerning yourself first You Can't See Clearly to discern somebody else until you understand the process of discernment before you understand the process of effect before you understand what's transpiring and what's going on and what's happening until you take it to yourself you can't See Clearly what effect it's having until you understand the effect it's having on you I'm just using that c19 because it's something that's on everybody's mind it could be a number of things but that's what he said so we see the principle of discernment and he he says it's a good thing for us to follow discernment he said we should never judge a man by the denomination he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has see the spirit and so if we would turn over to paragraph 113 he says he says the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying this that I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else see we must know what these things are for that's a that's a principle of discernment what is this for what's it for what what's what why is this what's it for what you know when we have a special what's this special for why is this person singing this song what words are in it for me you know you look for the you look for the real discernment in it not oh I like that tune I don't like that too and I like that voice I don't like that voice as you know when I grew up and I was a teenager and coming up before my conversion I I I I was a a a a Bob Dylan fan that's everybody knows that about me then knows me and I just liked his voice and I liked his music and and everything and and uh uh you know the other day we were visiting with some friends and so they thought they'd make joke with me and so they put on Bob Dylan singing uh it have a Merry Christmas or something like that some song and I thought you know I understood they were you know we were having fun and everything but when I look back What attracted me to that you know what was it it was the Rebellion it was the difference it was the spirit that it created in me it it allowed me to not to be a part and not conform and everything all that spirit dides is got me in a lot of trouble you know and it would have got me impr prison if the Lord didn't come in and and save me so it's a real it's a real uh important to understand the convers ations that you have with people the fellowship you're in what effect is it having on your spirit you know this is it edifying me do I want to serve God more do I want to read my Bible more and then you when you discern that then you take that back to yourself and you say is my life edifying their life do they want to read their Bible more when they're around me do they they want to serve God more when they're around me do they want to say good things do they want to have Fellowship do they want to have good works so everything that you discern this way has got to come back to yourself you've got to this is a beautiful principle of discernment you've got to take the beam out of your own eye else you will never see clearly to do any good for anybody else there's no need working on somebody if you've got the same problem it just don't help you know it just in fact it it the prophet of God said it's you're better off not having a gift that works the wrong way and then but we won't go there but so that's what it is that love one for another he says now if a man comes and has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination so in our case it would be our church or another church or our fellowship or another fellowship you know we so we've got to make it apply to our situation here and he says don't judge him by what denomination he comes from or how he dresses what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what's he trying try to do and then you look at yourself and you say what am I trying to do what am I trying to do do I have anything I'm trying to do and it and he says what he's trying to do with that gift what's the purpose what purpose he has what's his purpose what is it that he's trying to do and we'll get to this principle if if he's trying to take his influence and build no if he's trying to take his influence and he uses influence to build himself a great name out of it I would have discernment a spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great a teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how gifted how his gift op operates what is he trying to achieve so you know there's a lot of people that can really take the message and they can put it together and they can put it together and let you see things you've never seen before and and just present the argument like you just out out of bounds and everything but when you discern that you can't discern the gift you can't discern how it operates you can't discern how the enticing words are you've got to sit back and say what is the purpose of it what's he trying to build what's he trying to achieve what's it for what's it doing is it building himself is it building a a a this or is it building that uh is it Fame is uh uh what the purpose of it you know I was asked and I I thought it was a very good question someone asked he says are you more popular now now that you're on uh uh streaming and and I thought well I don't know we've got 300 views I said that that's really nothing I said My Testimony has over 20,000 views you know what I mean so you know we're not streaming because of that we're streaming to to try to reach out to the people in our church so they don't fall off the face of the Earth trying to get some word out to them so that they can sit there and they can realize really look at my what I'm doing you know examine ourselves make sure that we're removing the beam out of our eye and and and seeing clearly and and and examine Our Lives that's the purpose of it it it it's not to reach out or to share the gospel or or or to go any place else that's not what what we're trying to do we're not trying to build a worldwide following we don't care about that what we ought to care about is our body how's our body doing how's the people that we're concerned about that we have contact the needs that are in our framework you know we're trying to stay together you know I mean we we we took 90 seats out of our our Sanctuary that's from that's where we were before this happened to where we are now and that's because that's the purpose of it is to destroy fellowship and and and you just got to you just got to sit back back and say Lord I'm going to press through this I'm going to do all that I can to serve God I'm going to try to look in what the prophet of God said and do all that I can so we're not here to build things or how great a teacher he is how powerful he is or how intellectual is or how the gift offer it isn't if he's trying to achieve something how is if he isn't trying to achieve something something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment tell you that that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Christ now remember the spirit never comes to break things up it comes to unify right to bring people together so you you you You' just got to have that that discernment as got to be working in your heart and then we'll go on he says but if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ I don't care what he belongs to that's paragraph 16 you're not Discerning the man you're Discerning the spirit the life that's in the man can I just say a personal note there's just a very few of us here and I'm sure just a few online I personally have never been moved by a minister that will sit and study in his office and hasn't won one Soul hasn't sat down with a sinner somewhere and got down on his knees and prayed him through that's a person that's building on another man's Foundation but I like to see people you know I've never wanted our church to be a church that was just people that came from some other church that they weren't happy there or or or they they got they like the style of preaching well I don't got that problem with the style of preaching I just thank God that brother Ram's message carries us but but but if you don't if you watch the life that follows you know what I mean if if it's never it's if it's not introducing the message to people we not sitting down giving out a book to somebody introducing but you're always functioning with within the framework of the Believers that are around you and all you live for is that a boy then then you know when you discern that and you look it says what's the purpose of the ministry but I like somebody that's willing to counsel somebody sit there go out and talk to somebody meet somebody at the H shopping center meet somebody maybe in the park or I guess if you can meet anybody anymore Satan's surely trying to get rid of witnessing you know a guy ought to wear a sign if you come within six feet of me you might get saved or you might get healed you know Come a Little Closer you might feel you might be blessed you know let's muzzle the off o the scripture says don't muzzle the ox you know but we won't go there but that's what he's saying you know saying don't get caught up with the style of preaching don't get caught up with with how emotional and all these things look and say what is coming out of this what's the fruit of this is it is it going outside of the cup is the cup overflowing is it flowing out to others is there a light being shined are are we drawing the uh the world or are they seeing you and and inquiring what is the hope that's in you you know I told a brother and I he says there's really nothing more my Ministry can do for you you've got the Holy Ghost you've got complete access to everything that I have access to you're saved and you're filled with the spirit of God I says we can fellowship and I can bring to your remembrance things but our ministry has got to be able to turn out and bring what we have to those that don't have it you know how many people don't really realize that God's A Healer somebody's got to tell them let it be us he said down in 16 but if he has a gift of God he's trying to edify the body of Christ then I don't care what he belongs to you're not Discerning the man you're Discerning the spirit the life that's in the man that's what God told us to do not one time did he ever commission to discern the man's group but we are constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to you are commanded by God to look and say where is this ministry trying to take me what is the what is going to be the result you know I I asked that question I thought where what is brother brandom trying to bring me to and I can say this he's trying to bring me to an invisible Union with the with the bridegroom he's trying to restore the faith in me that the disciples had he's trying to to make me an effectual Ambassador for the kingdom he's trying to bring me to where that I don't present a man-made idea that I don't present a Creed I don't present a Doctrine but I present Christ Jesus in the spirit of the word of God that's what he's trying to do he's not he's not even here to try to build a message God took them so that he wouldn't increase but he would increase it it's so perfect when we we discern so we ought to know what is this message trying to produce it's not trying to produce followers it's trying to produce effectual workers for the kingdom of God men and women that are about God's business they have the confidence in his word that God will keep his word and they have a faith to testify to that word and share that word because they know they have a god that'll back them up not just keep telling you what you always want to hear I should never have to go over Malachi 4:5 unless there's young Christians in our midst the opening of the seals the ministry of the son of man the reason we do those things is so that people could haven't heard and their eyes haven't been open can come into the revelation of it but those who have been revelated those that have received the power and have the discernment should be a about our father's business I'm going to close real quick cuz I want to finish the tape he says and then over here he's he's talking he says paragraph 17 but what is he trying to do what's the purpose of his heart that he's trying to get then you can see what's in the man's life whether his motive is for his denomination whether it's for hisself whether it's for worldly things or whether it's for a big name he says what's in his heart what's he after now remember take that to yourself first that's the principle of discernment so you're Discerning you're Discerning events you're Discerning decisions you've got to have decisions discernment to make a proper decision but all the decision comes back and discerns back you know and then in paragraph 19 he says now if we'll notice the motive and objective of the Old Testament prophets then man had one objective and that was Jesus Christ they had one thing that their whole theme of the Old Testament was built to the coming Messiah that ought to be our whole theme that everything's built upon is he's coming soon we should get ready right Spirit right attitude right motive right objective that we should have and just this finishing up here in that paragraph I believe he says he doesn't care he's talking about he says but a real Minister a real Christian these things the things that are he's talking about ministers they're the principles of discernment that apply back to us he says just take a minister today paragraph 21 if he's has the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he knows that if he preaches the word it's going to cut his Fame down it's going to put him a little bitty church somewhere or maybe out on the street but he knows that something in his heart is a burning he sees the coming of the Lord there's an urgency and I hope that that urgency sets in us the Lord's coming we're convinced he's coming we've seen the signs of his coming we've seen the sign of Malachi 45 that tells us the great and Dreadful day of the Lord's upon us and we ought to be convinced and concerned and get about our business because our discernment is discerned by our concern in our actions so someone who has no discernment doesn't feel the coming of the Lord's at hand and there's no urgency to witness there's no urgency to do good works there's no urgency to do anything so the lack of discernment begins to show up in your actions you see it okay that's the beam that's in our eyes we miss it and we're going the world's terrible and the world world's crazy and everything's coming to pass but there's no urgency in US you see then then then we can tell that we don't have the principle of discernment working our discernment is really not working because true discernment produces the life I'm just saying that what he said there's something burnning in him he doesn't care whether he has today's food or not no food he doesn't care whether he has good clothes he doesn't have good clothes the only mindful he's only mindful of one thing and that's the very life within him crying out that's real discernment is the life in you you know what the life in us should be crying out even so come quickly Lord Jesus he's trying to achieve something for the glory of God and that man in doing so will act the very life of the spirit that's in him do you follow me he'll act it out okay so you see what he's saying if it if you've got the discernment and it's burning in you and you see the condition of the world and that spirit that discernment is in you the discernment that you have will act out in you oh Hallelujah there we go now we're getting down to it no wonder the prophet saying what the church needs is discernment they're missing it the world's falling apart it is like never before is it falling apart malls are becoming ghost towns people are locked in their houses with little trucks pulling to their door and dropping off boxes and thieves driving up and down the street stealing those boxes I me really he lacked it out you see he was a true prophet of God because he was trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God so he says here he says I'll say so and so and as with his prophecy oh oh he would have built he's talking about Moses he would have would have been world famous but that wasn't in his heart that couldn't be in his heart so if you see a person with a great grip trying to do something to glorify themselves your own discernment of the spirit tells you that's wrong but Moses was trying to achieve something for the the glory of God no matter how bad it was how evil it looked how much he was talked about the spirit in Moses directed him straight to the line of duty the spirit in him amen and so we'll stop there just reviewing the thing uh uh you know again when the this is paragraph 36 when a man is so Anointed with the spirit now let this go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side so that straight to the heart when a man's anointed of the spirit of God his habits his actions and everything is God moving in him sometimes he's misjudged but it's God moving in our lives well and this is the word where we left off and then we'll start the tape and it's just 30 minutes and then we'll be done but one who had discernment of spirit knew that that was the spirit of God in him crying out and when a man is Anointed of the spirit of God he's got the action of God and the action of God is never to break us up the action of God is to draw us together for We Are One in Christ Jesus and God's purpose is to bring us together love one another remember the spirit of God never breaks us up so you tell me what this spirit is out here in the world working it's got one motive and objective is to break us up to scatter the flock and like sheep they go astray and they scatter don't think that we don't got a devil that smart he let this old bug out for a reason let's have discernment let's pick it up now we'll close in I don't know what time it is I spoke longer than I wanted to but it it service was better I wasn't too long this morning morning right I did better I I told you i' promis I'd work on doing better I just got more need more discernment so so you pray for me let's finish up now as we listen to the rest of discerning of spirits God bless you then God's purpose is to bring us together love one another now that great prophets we see the spirit moving in them Jesus called them Gods he said they were Gods now when the spirit come to them by measure but when he come on the one Jesus which was the son of God it come to him without measure the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him for he was the perfect example he was God of Glory manifesting the glory of God to the people God in him going about watch his life all the Old Testament he was the theme of the Old Testament all the old prophets back in the Old Testament cried out not to themselves they cried out under the spirit of God making them act like God in so much that they were called gods and then the fullness of that Spirit was manifested in Jesus Christ look at David David when he was dethroned as the king of Israel rejected by his own people going up Mount olives north of Jerusalem and he looked back over the city and wept because he was rejected yes what was it it was the spirit of Christ 500 years later the son of David Jesus sat on the same Mount looking over the city as a rejected King and cried Jerusalem Jerusalem how of would I have gathered you your different denominations and everything as a h does are brood but you would not how off would I have did it now the same spirit that was in David that was manifested in fullness in Christ is in the church today crying to the peoples how off would I have gathered you and when you see separation and and differences and and Brotherhood broken up and Christian Life one against the other then it makes the spirit of God in your heart cry out you're trying to achieve something a true prophet of God a true teacher is trying to bring the church to a Unity of spirit a Unity of spirit that they might recognize God Amen trying to achieve it no matter what denomination they belong to or what about it we have discernment of spirit to discern the spirit that's in the man to see if it be the spirit of God or not now we noticed when he was here on Earth how he went about doing good I noticed another thing that come to my mind did you notice when David was rejected as king he went out of the city and a little Benjamin might benjamite which was supposed to have been a brother to him should have been sorry because he was rejected Ed but what he was a man and he drug along there with his condition throwing dirt on David and calling him all kinds of bad names and cursing him in the name of the Lord cursing King David in the name of the Lord this little old crippled up benjamite watch the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil working now if you notice he was crippled it represents the spiritual of the people today that would make fun of the true spirit of God in Christ manifesting itself that was a spirit of Christ and David being rejected as a king and today when the people make fun of the people who has received the Holy Spirit and trying to achieve something to draw methodists and Pentecostals and Baptists and Pentecostals and Presbyterians and all together as a Unity as a body of Christ and they see the spirit work you say well look that's a Pentecostal away with him I know one run off with another man's wife I know this and got drunk I know this and did this I know this and did that all that but they're big enough to hide their own things they can hide it but David was exposed why he had the spirit of Christ in him that guard said shall I take the head of that dog that would curse my king watch the spirit of Christ in David let him alone for the Lord has told him to curse meu do you catch that let him alone the Lord has told him to curse me inste today we don't get up our Fist and fight him chop his head off yeah get him out he don't belong to us let him on the Lord has told him to curse me that little running along there throwing dirt on David that's what they do today on the spirit of Christ they're a bunch of holy rollers but they're a bunch of this there's nothing to them there's nothing to Divine Healing there's no such a thing as Angels there's no such a thing as prophets all those things the days of Miracles has passed throw in dirt but let them on but when David David returned in power Hallelujah when he come back as full king of Israel don't worry this Jesus whose Spirit we have today acting his part out will return again in a physical body the second time in glory and power and Majesty Hallelujah that little dirt thrower fell on his face and beg for mercy so let him alone the spirit of Christ in US don't excommunicate him let's remember that all these things has got to come to pass we've got one thing to do move on God promised that he'd make everything work together for good to them at L him let's keep the deser of spirit keep the objective right we're here to serve God each one fellowshipping going along and serving God if the man's got the wrong kind of an objective then what will happen see now we find out that the spirit of God was in in him all the old prophets spoke of him all the spirits in potion every little potion wasn't glorifying itself true prophets all the true prophets was manifesting him speaking of him and everything they said was fulfilled in him showed it was the spirit of God in them it was fulfilled what was it God speaking of himself see God manifesting himself through these prophets not taking Glory who will be the next president who will be this and hit you on the head tell us who hit you and we'll believe you that isn't it it's something to manifest God it isn't something to make brother weather here or brother Shores or brother so and so out there a great man make him a greater than the rest of the man of his group make him the greatest man in Phoenix isn't to make William brandom something great but what is to do it isn't to make or Robert something great Billy Grim something great but it's a Hearts we're trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God it's manifesting God all gifts and things doesn't make one greater than the other it just makes us all working together for the Perfection of the body to bring us together as one people as a people of God but when you see them going contrary don't curse them just let them alone somebody has to do it but wait till Jesus comes in power now we see all those prophets speaking every one of them was glorifying God and the coming Messiah and when they got in the spirit they acted and spoke and lived the life out just like the Messiah did if it did that side the cross speaking of his coming how much more will it after his coming will put the spirit of the Messiah in the church to act do work and live like the Messiah amen it's a spirit of God God discern that Spirit see whether it is of god or not see whether it acts like him see if your emotions if somebody kicks up something against you and throws dirt upon your life when you know you're as innocent as you can be and you know that you got the spirit of God don't try to separate yourself don't try to act mean towards him don't curse him just walk on knowing god did that to give you a test to see how you take it you'll have to come to it anyhow as I said the other day I believe in brother Fuller's Church the bicycle Rider in Canada well all of them thought they could outride this boy this little old and he's the only one couldn't H ride without holding the handlebars I'm glad I like to be one of those handlebar Riders take a hold of both sides of the Cross and say nothing in my arms I bring let me hold to the Cross Lord I have no intellectuals I have nothing let me just hold here look way out down there and they had a 12in plank to ride for a city block to get a $100 swin bicycle all those boys you could ride without holding go downtown get their mother's groceries and come back without even touch the handlebars they everyone begin to look they wasn't used to holding to the handlebars and they fell off but this little old boy got on there and helped the handle bars and rolled it to the end they asked him how did you do it he says here's where you make your mistake fellas you're all better Riders than I am but you were looking here and said it made you nervous to see what you're trying to balance yourself and you fell off said I never looked here at all I watched the end and kept steady that's what we're to do don't look at these little things now did this one do this or that one do that watch the end and keep studying Christ is coming watch the end just keep study don't notice what's going on now watch what's going to go on out yonder at the end time when we're going to have to stand and give an account for our lives David wasn't watching that little old benjami throw dirt on him just crippled anyhow he never noticed him he wouldn't even let the guard cut his head off let him alone God told him to do that God told him to curse me let him alone for David knew that someday Hallelujah he was returning in power that Benjamine had have his time yes that's it the church will rise and Triumph is just sent to pray for his sick children anyhow that's all I can do wherever they are in what church they are it makes me no difference I'm trying to pray for his sick children trying to manifest the gift for his glory that's the reason I never did belong to anything now remember that's all right see I'm not I'm not saying that now I want you to get me clear I believe that God's got Christians in every Church his children he's never questioned me on that I just s to pray for the children and to do these things and to manifest him now you see Jesus and these prophets everything that they spoke of had to be true true for it was the power of God in them God himself speaking through them of his own self coming to his own Glory who's President who's going to is go to uh are we going to have enough rain this year I don't mean nothing something to the glory of God something to set the church in order something for the power of God not to make yourself a name but to make the glory of God manifested now we know no that all those prophets and all they said about him everything come to true because he was the theme of the Old Testament Jesus the Messiah coming Messiah was what every Prophet looked from from Adam to M Mali every Prophet spoke of the coming of the Lord each one put his part in because he was anointed of God that's all he could speak of now wish we had more time on it but watch everything that they said come to pass look at here let's just take some of the things the prophet said a virgin shall conceive and bear a child did it happen sure his name Shall be Called Emanuel uh Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father that's what he was exactly the Everlasting father no man should be called father on this Earth but God is your father all right now let's see again he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the Chast of our peace of up on him with his stripes we were healed Pilot's judgment Hall while the very man having his back laned like that with a cat and n Tail Whip didn't realize that the scripture said it would be that way they didn't have discernment of spirit those priests who said away away with him away with him and on the cross when they shot out their lips and things like that when he heard him crying my God why I forsaken me they didn't have discernment see they couldn't discern the spirit that's what David was speaking of and the 22nd Psalm they shot out their lip not knowing they were doing it just the same as that benjamite did to David see he thought David is all wrong because he didn't agree with him on his principles of running his kingdom he didn't understand that it was the spirit of God in David doing it that's where we must discern today the spirit of the man what's he trying to do what's he getting at not what group he belongs to or what this that or the other whether he's a white man black man yellow man or whatever he is let's see what he's trying to achieve and take that see what he's trying to do for the kingdom of God he's got Odd Ideas to ours that's perfectly all right if he's trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God discern that in him if he's wrong and true in heart God will bring him around to the truth of the thing after a while let him alone let him alone see what he's trying to do now we see here then we find out in his in his death when he died at the cross and crying all the things the prophets spoke of it they pierced my hands and my feet there it was fulfilled will the prophets is right they thought it was themselves or cried like it was themselves but it was manifested in the cross he uh he was uh numbered with the transgressors that's what he was done he was with the transgressors in his death he made his bu with the rich he did he was buried in a rich man's grave I will not leave his soul he will not leave my soul said David the spirit of God in David speaking out he will not leave my soul in hell neither will he suffer his holy one to see corruption like as if David would be the Holy One wasn't David it was the spirit of God in David crying out see the spirit of God in the man crying out some of them said listen that old hypocrite up there he wasn't it was the spirit of God in him crying out see the spirit of God manifest itself not leave his soul in Hell neither will suffer my Holy One to see corruption now brethren in closing may I say this our time gets away but look may I say this in closing with these scriptures here let's see if a man that all the Old Testament theme was about him all the holy prophets Anointed with God's spirit if all that and everything that they said was fulfilled to the letter exactly in him surely that great person called the Son of God ought to know how to set up the New Testament Church don't you believe that amen yes he ought to have a conception to know how to set up the New Testament Church the first thing I want to call your attention over here in Matthew 16th chapter that when he he is speaking there when he come down was talking to the disciples he said who does man say I the son of man am and they said some say you're Elias and some say you're so and so and some say you're so and so and like that different one he said but who do you say that I am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas for flesh and blood is not revealed this you my father which is in heaven has revealed this you and and I say unto thee th art Simon or art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it now there we're speaking of the church now watch closely and if I'm wrong God forgive me and you forgive me now the the Catholic Church says that that was a stone laying there Peter and upon Peter he built the church now we know that that's wrong we Protestants disagree with it but we Protestants says it was himself that he built himself a church up himself but if you'll notice I want to disagree with that friendly it wasn't that it was up on the spiritual revelation of himself Flesh and Blood you never learned this in a seminary as good as they are you never learned this by some church Creed as good as it is is it's all right but flesh and blood has not revealed this to you it's not an intellectual conception of how you make your speech how you must buy yourself how what great thing you must do here in Earth that isn't what it is it isn't build a great thing or do a great thing what it is is a revelation of the word of God he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made manifest and dwelt among us he was that was the revelation of the word of God the spirit in Peter revealing by spiritual Revelation that he was the son of God made manifest yes amen the god of Glory manifesting the glory of God Upon This Rock spiritual revelation of the word I'll build my church why if them prophets was under God speaking by the holy spirit that that was the Son of God the same Spirit on this side red feels right back the same thing you see it Flesh and Blood you can't learn it in a seminary you learn your get your DD and your PhD and LD that all right wish I had it that's right but still that's not it you don't have to have it yet it's good to have it you can be this plus but if you have to rub out the plus take this this is that if this ain't that let me have this anyhow how I want this this flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learn it through the educational line you never learn it through denominational lines they're fine education denomination is fine that's part of it but people are laying too much to that and they're leaving the spiritual discernment amen see flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it we'll never be able to Prevail show they would be against it now watch and see where the gates of hell is against Hallelujah it ain't against the denomination the government recognizes that it is the world recognizes our denominations all of them we have the rights each one of us as American citizens we have the rights of denomination which is fine we appreciate that but that's not what the gates of hell is against it's against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same Destiny today and forever that's right that's what it's against it the Gates of Hell shall be against it but it shall never Prevail hallu there you are spiritual discernment regardless of who it is is my brother as long as he's trying to achieve the same purpose that I'm working for let him be Prophet let him be Pastor let him be Deacon let him be so and so let God honor him this way that way whatever it is dis honor me whatever he wants to do but yet that's my brother hallelujah we're working for the same thing we're sending our our all of our works into the same Kingdom honor he's working for the same thing I am spiritual discernment spiritual revelation of God look here if you want Jesus I preached the other night somewhere maybe down there it wasn't so from the beginning we have to go back to the beginning to find our text now for just a moment at the beginning there was Cain intellectual build a fine church we would say made a fine altar offered up a sacrifice prayed sincere gave thanks paid his ties everything just as religious as Abel was but Abel there was no Bible in them days but by spiritual Revelation he seen that it wasn't fruits of the field that caused us to sin it wasn't apples that they eat see it wasn't apples Revelation told him that and it wasn't the fruits that caused him to come out of there it was life the separation of life so he went and got a lamb and offered it in his did by faith which is spiritual Revelation amen thank God Hallelujah the revelation of God spiritual Revelation it was revealed to him it isn't a fruit it isn't apples it isn't peaches plums and pears it was a separation of life so he went and got a life and offered it instead of fruits fruits is what you your works are your own hands what you do there I'll go and build this I'll go do this I'll support that that's good he had an alar just the same as the other did both of them had alers that was good but it was a re spiritual revealed truth of the thing where the spirit of God revealed it up upon that rock the rock that Christ died on the rock of agypt upon the rock that Abel's lamb died on Hallelujah that little Abel as he put his hands upon that little lamb and his little white wool being bathed as he took a a rock that didn't have a lan in that day and chopped his Little Neck like that and hammered it and the poor little thing dying the blood bathing his hands and his little wool all bathed with blood blading and crying what did it speak of the Lamb of God some 4,000 years later spiritually revealed the church turning him down and the people call him be elub and a devil because all the prophets that spoke out they denied the prophets oh he said you build their suppers and you put them in there you Whited walls he said to them without spiritual discernment not knowing that that was the Lamb of God that he was supposed to be that way and act that way because he was fulfilling the word of God and the Holy Ghost Church today acting the way they do doing the things they do they're fulfilling the word of God hallelujah you see Peter said on the day of Pentecost this is that and he said it's un to you and to your children and them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call them same inspired Prophet said the evening light would shine there' be a farmer and latter rain together as in the days of grace look here what is it the farmer rain's coming over and the latter rain is pass due then it's lapped over it's together the farmer and latter rain together the Holy Spirit made manifest by the power and the resurrection of Jesus Jesus Christ there you are coming together the farmer God's grace he said as it was in the days of Noah his grace was long suffering here it is today long suffering a lap over brings the cloud from the old days the cloud from this day together the farmer rain running first the first rain we've had now here comes the lad rain coming over the farmer rain coming over the lad rain East and West meeting together both rains falling together Divine Healing plus the angel of God revealing the secrets of the hearts and bringing everything to pass oh look like true born children of God would see that there you are the spirit revealing Revelation that's what Jesus said the church would be built upon well then somebody might raise up and say well sure we so and so we're built up on that let's take his word a little farther the last commission to his church he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature all the world how long is to last all the world to how many ever creature he that believeth and is baptized not the church he's a personal pronoun he that believeth the individual as David D plac said about the grandchildren there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of God it's children your father was Pentecostal and you're just coming here to this church because he come here to the leth and Garfield received the Holy Ghost this brought you in as a grandchild you're wrong amen God's got to reveal himself to you and no man can call Jesus the Christ by intellectual conceptions no man can call Jesus Christ because he feels sorry for his sins and comes and repent no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the re revelation of the Holy Ghost making it KN to him Upon This Rock build my church and the Gates of Hell will never against him there's the Revelation there it is what he's built his church upon who did it Peter no no no who did it Christ said the revelation of God the the Holy Spirit would bring it to you a little while and I'll leave you but I'll pray the father and he'll send you the comforter will bring these things to your remance is that right what he's doing this morning and will what show you things to come the holy spirit in the church in the last days now you say brother Hallelujah that's my church wait a minute Jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples in St John 13:35 this will all men know your my disciples when you have love one for the other the spirit revealed truth of the kingdom of God to come looking out to the end y seeing what the prophets cried about see what Jesus spoke about and you're the same Holy Spirit and you crying right back that's right that's right what is it is spiritual revealed truth I love my brother regardless of where they go to church or they're farmer ladder or no rain at all as long as they're in the body of Christ trying to achieve not something for a certain purpose to manifest yourself on Earth but the purpose for the kingdom of God and the glory of his coming to reveal and make known his soon appearing now in closing we want to think of this Upon This Rock I'll build my church correctly and then we find out over in John 14:7 he said this The Works that I do shall you do also the works that I do what kind of works did he do to make himself known you me Remember by Peter don't you what we've been talked by Phillip the woman at the well predicting it not to go to the Gentiles but would be in the last days as he said as it was the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there's a revelation written in Mysteries like this to the outside world to the world that knows about but you precious Brethren you precious sisters you are not children of the darkness you're not children of the night but you're Children of the light walking in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's son cleanses all our sins from all of us there you are the Servants of the Lord Jesus is I quote my scripture on here I got Mark 16 yes Mark 16 he said go ye into all the world here's what kind of a church he set up the last commission to the church go ye into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned now look here look at the spiritual Des he that believeth and is baptized you never exactly say which way but we want to fuss about that see the other thing see he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved whatever he wants to be baptized that's up to him if his achievements for the kingdom of God come on brother we're marching on with the same Spirit if I'm wrong then you'll tell it'll come out that way if you're wrong it'll be that but our hearts and our motives and our objectives is for the kingdom of God you you know we are we're pointing to Calvary me and my ideas why I got I ain't got a brother likes Cherry Pie as well as I do but we're brothers see none of them likes to hunt and fish like I do but we're brothers see what I mean I got my own ideas but that don't make him not my brother his father is my father his family is my family there you are the Patriarchs all different one from another but there was one father and they should work to one thing and they rejected the main one in there because he was spiritual don't you see it Brethren can't you you see what I'm speaking of now notice and in closing go ye into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he with it and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues what is it spiritual Revelation they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that was what the new church was that's the kind of church that Jesus Christ this great one that all the prophets cried out would do we find his Spirit comes over here and predicts that his spirit in the people come right back and do the things that he did May I close in saying this I got about a dozen more scriptures here but we haven't got the time see but listen to this may I close in saying this ever true borned again prophet of the Lord preacher Sunday school teacher Seer Apostle missionary whatever he might be his whole whole heart is set and he's so filled and Anointed with the spirit of God so anointed whatever his office is whatever it might be to preach or to teach or to evangelize or to see Visions whatever it is he'll do it for the kingdom of God yes and the spirit of God will speak right back through the man and manifest it's the kingdom of God then we me as a Baptist I see you Pentecostal you're my brother you don't belong to the Baptist Church I did that's the only church ever did belong to as a Baptist Church but that don't stand in my way I see what the spirit of God is with you I see what you're trying to do well if me a Baptist can feel that way surely the assemblies the Church of God the United Pentecostals the independence and all of us Brethren together ought to see that we're trying to work for one purpose let's have spiritual discernment now listen in closing I'll make this last remark many are sick and weakly among you and many are asleep spiritually dead because they don't have discernment of the body of Christ this sick body that we got God help us to have spiritual discernment of that revelation of the kingdom of God and of the love of God in our heart shed abroad by the Holy Ghost to try to put our arms way out say we are Brethren see what I mean and every little gift that you have don't use it to try to make it uh some great something for ourselves let's make it for the kingdom of God to work with everyone to try to uplift the cause of Jesus Christ for his coming is soon do you believe it I'm so sorry to keep you so long Brother David will be here tomorrow to teach you the scriptures but right now let's bow our heads just a moment y behold my hand
