Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service
February 9th, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

safe in you and that you just take care of all things we just ask that you bless our little time of fellowship tonight those that have come out to the house of the Lord we just ask you to bless them and be with us now father as we look at your word and long for your fellowship we ask these things in jesus' name amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to First John and just want to read a few scriptures uh out of First John a couple in the uh third chapter and a couple in the fourth chapter and and um just uh so if you have that those two chapters in there we want to read in First John 3 and 18 and he says little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him now you see that's a great scripture right there because this this is what we're pressing to a lot of people don't have confidence in their relationship they don't have confidence in in in in what God's done for them you know that he's really forgiv you ever told somebody they say well I'm sorry and you don't know whether they're sorry or not it's like saying I'm sorry but you're waiting for the vengeance you know what I mean yeah you know so uh but that you might be assured that you have this assurance I it's just such a beautiful thought John is showing he says hereby we know that we are of Truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we kept his Commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment oh uh uh isn't that good over in the fourth uh chapter ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are the CH we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us and he that is not of God heareth us not hereby know we we here hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not God for God is he that loveth not no knoweth not God for God is love and this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son unto the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no manath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US amen and and then the 17th verse herein is our love made perfect that we have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in the world Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated I just thought to uh read some of these scriptures because I I I just think that uh in my heart's desire is that we really come to that place that we know how important um love is and uh um you know Matthew uh shared a quote and uh Matthew that one that you shared with me today at lunch uh when love projects uh Sovereign Grace takes hold do you have that there when you find it let me know I just uh I'd like to have him read that for us and and so if if we can understand from whence our strength comes and uh so you know how can I say this just right because I I I'm trying to get away from negative ity and being critical you know what I mean because I don't think it produces any fruit just to blast this and blast that so it's it's it's not pointing out the air but sometimes uh uh an err is because there's a part of the truth left out of it you understand uh what do they say the best lie is 99% true truth and and so the importance of the uh love of God is is to the believer and the and where the power comes and so you know when man begin to preach they begin to preach that the power of God came from an outside force in other words you were you were there and then the power of God came down and anointed you and they they uh begin to preach that you needed this anointing and this anointing uh man Through the Ages begin to preach that this is what was important to the believer and so when the prophet of God came to the church if you listen to his messages when he started in the beginning he was he talked a lot about Union it didn't matter whether you are Baptist thepress it none of that mattered if you could just love one another but as they begin to proceed they begin to come to the place where uh they begin to inject uh their own ideas and when they begin to inject their own ideas then the prophet of God begin to speak out against the lie that that they were putting upon the people and he was trying to get them back back to the place that where it all started and that's why I believe when he came and preached that great message called uh uh God's provided place of worship and he brought us back to the experience of what it means to be born again amen and and what it really means to where that the where that it becomes generated and it becomes generated when your heart's changed because you've accepted the sacrifice that he's made for you and and then your heart doesn't condemn you because God so loved us so when John starts going through the scripture here he says now brother we have this fellowship with God because God so loved us that he gave his only begotten son and so when you begin to move to the place that that you feel that it's something that's generated from outside that comes down upon you and and then then that that was something that begin to happen and then people begin to have all kinds of experiences and all kinds of emotional outcomes and they begin to look for what was from the outside but but we understand from the word of God God works from the inside out and when a man's heart when he can come to the place that that he has that love and he can project that love did you ever did you find that Matthew I thought it was the one that was in uh uh God's word I'll just quote it uh but B says when when love projects Sovereign Grace takes hold you are saying when the love is there and the love projects we don't have the power to change things but love creates an atmosphere in which God can work and when he sees you you know when he sees that your heart's burdened for somebody or you're longing for somebody or you're praying for somebody and you project that love the prophet of God said that love is what obligates God to heal amen he don't heal just because he has to heal but but something's got to move him you understand something's got to call him on the scene and you can't sit there and try to call God on the scene you know I've been to meetings where they they say God I command you to do this and and and they they'll point and they'll say Lord go there and and do this and and they don't understand that don't move God but you get a cont right heart you get somebody's heart who's bleeding someone who's burdened for somebody and then when that love when they project that love Sovereign Grace another words Sovereign Grace means the grace that only God has and what does grace do Grace changes the inevitable outcome of a circumstance if you're standing right here and there's a truck coming 70 M an hour and and it the inevitable outcome of you getting hit by that truck going 70 miles an hour is you're going to be in pretty sad shape but Grace comes and he changes the outcome and then you hear a testimony that truck came and it struck me going 70 miles an hour and I cut out of it without a scratch what was that that was Sovereign Grace you know something happened to me and I should have been but Sovereign Grace in other words what should have been isn't the result of what happened because Grace took place Grace is called on to the scene when people love one another it's not a power that you pull out of the sky it's not something the music brings it's something that an experience brings because you've been there you've been through it you've felt it you know what it's like to be lost you know what it's like to be sick when the prophet of God that little blind man in Mexico come up he looked at him he had his little hat in his hand he said I looked at him I thought if my coat would fit him or if my shoes I looked at my foot and so all of a sudden he's looking at at the situation and and and his love starts to project he said this could be my daddy this is somebody's father you you understand he got himself in the condition he he he placed him self he's involved in self and to too many now we've got to the place we take whatever happens whatever comes by whatever blows through but that's not taking control of the circumstance that's not creating the atmosphere that's not creating the condition Sons and Daughters of God they create the condition they take control of the atmosphere love is what controls the atmosphere now they have power over those Spirits now they have power because power apart from character is satanic and there's only one character that God has that God is love when you want somebody well just because you want to see a miracle you know what you'll get you'll get a fake miracle but when you want somebody well you know the prophet of God said that you have to have a reason you want to be well I've seen mamas get healed from cancer because they wanted to raise those babies they didn't want to leave their husband raising those babies alone they didn't want to they they just they just couldn't they couldn't bear the thought and they went to the throne of God and it wasn't Lord I want to be healed it was Lord I I don't want to leave my husband to raise these children you gave me these kids I want to raise them I'm not going to let this cancer take me and love to hold love moves God there's nothing that moves God more than to have genuine love and I'll tell you you got to perfect love love Don't Come Easy you got to go through the Hall of critics before you go to the hall of name you know I I know what it's like to be criticized to think that you're not Spirit-filled to think that you don't you don't have God moving in you that the spirit don't God but I've seen God move Devils I've seen babies come to life in [Music] wombs God's got a history when love strikes the power of God comes but if it's not genuine from your your heart's desire because the love of God is beaten in you it's temporary but you get something that's Eternal I've seen lots of Miracles but there's only one thing that moves me more than anything I'd love to see a soul pass from Death un life I love to see someone at at the altar Hellbound and then come to know that him and his power and the glory of his Resurrection that's what moves you that's what life's about and you can impart that I love what we read earlier we have declared unto you what we've heard and seen that we might have Fellowship one with another and with the father so so this is not a a small matter that we're going down the road J John said here it's not love in the tongue and in word we're not preaching a message about love oh love Love's the Capstone we're talking about faith is a substance right so if faith is a substance and faith comes from love then love has to be a substance it has to be something that you can feel that you can know that is as real to you as something something that takes hold of you something you have and something you can recognize when it works how many's ever had the love of God just take over you and all of a sudden you got compassion you got love you know it's him you know he's there give me that kind of love and I'll show you power give me that kind of love and I'll show you Victory you can get on your pedestal and you can shout all you want but genuine love is what conquers that's the Conquering power that's where God's Vindicated and it ain't in four walls it's in your everyday morning you know when you want love you want love in the morning you want love when you wake up you want to approach your day with him on your mind your brother on your mind lost souls on your mind with the commission on your mind I've been called to go into all the world and spread the gospel Lord give me a heart for that we're tired of building churches we want to build the kingdom that's what we want to build we want to build the kingdom I'm for any brother that's wanting to build the kingdom you know you people say I want the I can you imagine if every Church in this town even the other message churches of this town all came here well you'd be in trouble if they got here early cuz You' have spent all your money building it and they would possess it can you imagine I don't want everybody else there I don't want everybody's believer everywhere let I want other brothers to have people being doing work they can reach people I can never reach I want everybody praying for the sick everybody telling them about Jesus I just like to run through a few of the statements that we listened to this morning and and I hope this morning by listening to what we listen to you understand why it's so important to play the tapes because the prophet of God said the trouble with the church is they got secondhand religion and here everything we believe everything we stand for came from a mouth of a prophet and then so many of us won't even play his voice in our church don't tell me you're feeding on it you're feeding on man's interpretation but when you can hear it from The Source then you can bind your spirit and that Spirit and the scripture tells us to try every Spirit what are you going to try it by I'll tell you what you try it by in this day you try it by the voice of Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4 that's the voice that judges this generation you know assuredly that this is what he said Paul said be followers of me as I am of Christ I believe they preach the same message don't you I love what this says and so we we talked to that he says now the Holy Spirit feeds on music what do you mean the Holy Spirit feeds on music the Holy Spirit feeds on personality the Holy Spirit feeds on Style no the Holy Spirit feeds on the word what attracts the Holy Spirit now there's a rain that falls on the just and there's a rain that falls on the unjust but that seed hungers for that word it that's what it feeds on the Holy Spirit feeds on the word it's looking for that word it's looking for something that they can grab that they knows real that they can stand on and it'll hold true in their life lives and they don't they don't have to be afraid right what's the biggest problem of the church we heard this morning fear they have confidence this is what we just read if you have confidence towards God and your heart condemns you not then you can ask what you will you don't have to worry about what you're asking your your motives are pure your objectives are pure you have confidence that he hears you because there's no sin in your life you know you I I we're we're here tonight the a lot of people are camped out and and got their their popcorn and they're hoping for a chief and or or the Eagles well the real eagles are here this is the winning Eagles right here he amen and in about in about three hours uh from now that that thing will be over with and and they'll have glory for a couple weeks and then everybody talks about next year oh who won it can anybody tell me who won number 14 what are they on now 56 or something like that it's ridiculous it's so temporary it's so carnal you know you you it we're we're missing it what we're missing is what God's given us just let's just I'm going to read just some he says the Holy Spirit feeds on the word and he said and they are listening to the radio they go to church and so forth because they are longing for that Fellowship around the word so in other words you can start to tell when God's done something for somebody you ever get around people now they don't want to talk about the word they don't want to sit in there and talk about the seals you sit down and talk about what God's doing everybody's out of the room you know what I mean they're not into that we got service we had a great time but they don't want to Fellowship around the word they don't want to talk about salvation they don't want to hear the quotes they don't want to talk about the Prophet The Prophet's not important anymore they're separating the message from the messenger they're trying to replace brother Brandon with the Holy Spirit you'll never replace the prophet of God with the holy spirit because that was the Holy Spirit that's right it was the spirit manifesting himself in our generation in flesh just like he did to the Gentiles so he'd have a pure path to judgment oh uhuh well I want to Fellowship about that have Bible studies and get around I love them little boys that were they'd get together and sit around there you walk in there eight nine 10 12 year olds all sitting in the circle having a Bible study Hallelujah I wanted to join it myself but I was afraid they too smart for me that's what I'm talking about what's happening to the church it's dying it's dropping dead right before your eyes it's leaving the voice of God it's leaving the leadership of the prophet of the hour and and now they're out there fussing and arguing one another won't go to one another's camps and all that stuff they're dying why are they dying we left Calvary we forgot what he paid for us we forgot what he did for us and I hope everybody in here has the experience of knowing the loving forgiving hand of the Lord because that's the only thing that changes your attitude I thank God I I I'm not I don't thank God for my sins but I thank God that he saved me from where he saved me because I there's not a man that I look on that I don't believe God can help I don't care how what shape they are in I always thought in my heart you know brother BR said he was scared of that bull he said I started out he says I was scared at first then something happened I always thought if I'd had to look at one of those MS13 guys you know you ever seen some of them guys all tattooed up and never been they look scary I was just wondering if I could come face to face with a couple of those scary guys and they're scary and then that love could hit me then I could say guys I I I I mean you guys look scary and maybe that's why you do it and you forgive me you know that I I'm kind of oldfashioned and and everything but if you guys would just hear me out I'd like to tell you about the love of God that can forgive you of your sins oh wouldn't that be lovely wouldn't that be without it burned in your heart people don't hardly testify anymore they don't go out to the lost they go to church after church trying to aost toite let's have converts I I'm happy for anybody who'd move here I'm not I'm not condemning that but I'd rather have converts that's what made our congregation was people getting converted off the street com un to the Lord that that's what that's the foundation of every church is not passed down from family to family it's birthing the Lost into existence and every single one of you has a testimony don't let your past keep you from testifying don't let your present moment failures keep you from telling the truth because the truth is what sets people free he says here it says may God help us tonight to realize how we can have a perfect Fellowship how we can realize we all need to come what is a realization what's our word for realization Revelation to have a revelation of how I can have fellowship with God you've got to have fellowship with them cuz if if you're in Fellowship you'll know when he's here you'll know when he's coming my friends know what I'm going to do I call you friends you know the hand of the Lord you know how he's moving you know the spirit of the Lord you know what direction it is I think the trouble with this message today is people don't know where they're going one person thinks this doctrine's going to get them there another person thinks this doctrine's going to get another person thinks this blessing's going to do it another person persons think this is anointing there's only one thing that's do that does it is if you've been and you've died you got to die and if you die and you rise up in the love that saved you and that's the love that you've taken in your heart it'll keep you forever and I I guarantee you I've done things that God's Got every bit of right to take me off the book but he made me a promise and God keeps his word he started the work and he'll finish it so we got it there's a realization and no matter where Storms Come whether you're right or wrong you can still have Fellowship that's right think of that whether you've done right or wrong can you imagine being in such love that you've done something wrong and you go to him and say Aba father I'm sorry I can't be without you I remember one time I had a close friend he was a buddy to me we did everything together we hunted we did everything and one day I said something and I did didn't mean to say it it I I understood how he took it I didn't CU he was in a circumstance and I made a comment and it broke that Fellowship you know what I mean and and I I didn't know what was going on years later I realized it and and all you can do is is go back and say you know I was wrong I'm sorry I didn't mean it I I want that Fellowship back I don't want nothing in between us I I love you you understand and that's the way it is with the lord it's no no good to run around in shame he already knows what you've done he knows what you've done he knows what you're going through he knows what your weakness is he died for you when you were yet a sinner why don't you talk it over with him Lord my mind's messed up I get all defeated I I got I'm hot as a a a Irish firecraft ER and that's pretty odd I know I'm Irish you know help me he won't turn you away Lord let let let this work out for me I've had so many failures please let this time let me do things right he won't he won't leave you or forsake you so this is what he says he says no matter of the storm you still have Fellowship the only way you can can have Fellowship is as your love perfects a amen and it isn't that uh what we we just LED no no man hath seen God at any time but if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us I I never thought of it Lord perfect your love in me how do you get how do you have to how does your love get perfected you have this trouble and you love through it this person offends you and you forgive them this situation Rises up and maybe somebody took something from you or or or or or stole from from you I just had a a riffer that I really liked the guy and I liked his family and he went and took a job from me and I was supposed to do and and and and and and just did it and you know and and and he called me back and I and I talked to him about it I said Jose man that wasn't right he said man David it says I like you I'm sorry I did that oh I hate it when somebody says they sorry cuz they got me then you know what I mean I mean I don't have a thing to say after that you can't even be mad I said okay all right I I I'll give you a chance we'll do something to make up for it sometimes things are worth more to you than the other thing I hope people mean more to you you know I just I just really do and I'll tell you something I don't care if people criticized because I know who loves me I know where I come from I know what he's done for me and I know the prayers that he's heard I have confidence CU I'll guarantee you I didn't save myself I did not come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ knocked me down and then when I was dying in suicidal he showed up to tell me he loved me and you can just rest assured so we so Love's perfected and he said and he said don't never forget me if I don't see you no more remember this that my theme is love covers it all I believe in the redeeming love of Jesus Christ amen don't you don't you don't you just believe that a amen and then we we heard what he said listen just a moment I'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there are gifts they'll bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect you can't question love when somebody loves you you just can't question it you know it that's what happens to marriages they get doub in one another they get questioning they don't talk it out they something comes in and pretty soon they they don't understand why they're not connected got to get back to perfect love perfect love cast out all fear he said but where there love is perfect is that right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts that's what happened to the church they didn't get the love first they didn't get the Capstone you want gifts every single gift's in you the gifts are in the church God can move on those gifts any time it don't prove nothing every gift's operating in every other church out here but a perfect gift is run by perfect love so we just want to go over some of these things and and I I like what he said here he said that the only hope an alcoholic a drug addict has is the blood of Jesus Christ is that right am now in in the beginning man had Fellowship first we realize if we can have fellowship with God we've got to realize we can have fellowship with God do you realize that God will talk to every single one of you he will have a personal appointment with you just like if you came into my office and sat down and we had a chat you know just like I I I my buddy uh uh you know JJ we he he come up and and and I said what are you doing now oh he says I'm doing body work you know and I my mind goes body work yeah good I wreck my truck all the time and he showed me pictures we're fellowshipping we're talking about what he's doing how he wants to be a body man and everything there goes your helper and uh so you know and I I think well praise God just think you can have that with god with the creator of Heaven and Earth how good is that anybody tell me how good that is that's good don't you like to have God said so God told me bam said was common that men used to talk to God it was common for men to see God it was common for them their lives to be instructed by God that's where we need to get back to it all stems from having a born again experience at Calvary many of people have had hands laid on them and had a experience and had the Holy Spirit touch them but you tell me how the prophet God said you could have the Holy Spirit every day of your life and still go to hell what's missing you know what's missing the blood the Forgiveness the experience of his Divine forgiveness he said he said if we realize we can have fellowship with God then don't worry God will take care of the rest of it but fellowship with God the first and original Fellowship that human beings ever had was with God he say every Christian Longs for Fellowship but after all you don't have to go anywhere but to Calvary he said I read a story of a man who spent a lifetime nearly going high into the hills going it by lakes and hunting for a spot for Fellowship but after all you don't have to go anywhere but to Calvary that's the only way there is a way and there's only one way that you can go to Fellowship he he says there's a way there's only one way that you can go to Fellowship he said and he talking about job he says but think he's closer to you than his door his door is your heart and he so close tonight he's closer to you than your right arm is he's a part of you anybody look for the glasses on their face anybody ever look for the glasses on their head I remember I had a pair of glasses on my head and I had a pair of glasses es in my hand and I reached in my pocket and put a pair of glasses on my face of course the people was thinking there was something spiritual going on but it was just that I couldn't tell the beginning from the end you know what I mean but I appreciate the love and everybody covering for me you you know what I mean but he he's part of you he's right in there he put he put a part of himself in you the seed of God all he wants to do is germinate it and and and so I just I think I'll just close with this this evening because this is so he says he says he he can he's a a part of you and if we can only realize that he's here and how he wants to have fellowship with us his heart is greater for Fellowship than ours are and the reason he makes us that way is because we're offspring of his and that's what makes us long for Fellowship don't you understand what the beauty of that is there's the Redeemer and the redeemed and when the Redeemer and the redeemed come together and they become one it's the beautiful picture remember he was a Healer but until he healed somebody healing and the Healer had to come together the deliverer and the one that needed Deliverance so the deliverance and the deliverer come together the sick and the Healer come together the the the lost and the Savior come together that's the love story that's the love story is when God all that he is and what you are and they come together and and that's what he prayed father may they be one as we are one when they come together and now once you've been healed you pack healing you got healing you pack it with you once you've been saved you pack salvation once you've been delivered you pack Deliverance you never forget I have two boys that are healed by cancer they won't they won't they'll testify of it but the doctor said this is the way it is get you know you know how the doctors are you you think they're writing you a prescription to get better uh-uh like that that's a Doom's message here take this until you get worse and then I'll give you something else to make you worse oh they got healed Hallelujah you think you'll ever tell them God ain't a Healer no because now they're one they're packing it you ever had the love of God you'll pack it amen if you've ever been to Calvary you'll have what caused Calvary you ever been there you'll get why he did it in the first place you'll have it you'll possess it it'll be a part of you and we could go on because I got pages of of underlying things and and and statements that just came out of that 30 minutes I don't know if you're listening on live stream or where you are but I would encourage you to talk to your pastor about playing The Voice the Divine voice the voice of God to the flock it's life and it's life more abundant and the prophet of God said he said I love the holy spirit because it was the spirit that healed me it was the spirit that saved me it's it's what it is you say what is the spirit the spirit is God and what is God love you cannot have the Holy Spirit without having Divine love that was the motive God so loved his people he said I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun will come again and I'll be with you even in you till the end I will not forsake you but I'll send you another comfort and he shall lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness oh what is it brother McGary what is the Holy Spirit what was he given for it's the love of God that the love of God his love for you will be with you every day and you'll know I don't have to fear I don't have to be afraid cuz if God be for me who can be against me you can talk about anything but without love without Divine love it profiteth nothing though I speak with the men the tongues of men and angels though I have all gifts though I have all things and I have not charity it profiteth me nothing I remember one time when and and and we know that brother Billy Paul has gone on to be with the Lord I'm sure sure that shocked a lot of people because they thought California had to sink first no everything in God's word is eternal it was thought in the beginning it's a thought in the end we don't put the calendar together God interprets his word by what bringing it to pass but we were talking about the time that brother Brandon was behind the curtain and he was waiting to come onto the platform and and I said Billy I said he I said remember when your daddy was uh the guy got up and said that uh brother Brandon was gone you know and course he told me he says you know who that was don't you he told me about it and everything he I said why didn't he come out there he said he would never kill that man's influence and and when you see people killing one another's influence it's murder I don't care it's murder it's [Music] murderous and it's contagious and you know why he didn't go out because if he went out that wouldn't have just affected that man it would have affected everybody in that place it would have affected the purity of his message it would affected he made preparation remember those two kids that were in the audience that he could have smoted but what what happened he said I forgive you could you imagine if he would have smoted him it would have rewrote the whole story love is my theme the redeeming blood of Jesus Christ covers all just think of it I thought why didn't he go out he said he'd never do that he'd never hurt people he said you couldn't tell who his enemies were and who his friends were I thought Lord you got to be kidding me I knew exactly what I would have done I would have flown out from behind that curtain said liar you know liar liar pants on fire nose is longer than a telephone wire then they would say look who's talking you don't have to worry he's got it he's in control let's get love back into the church let's pray for everybody I'm glad there's different churches I'm glad there's different doctrines but I I just I it doesn't matter you know let me take care of let the love of God be shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Spirit and maybe uh we'll we can we can just go through so many of these quotes how he talks about preparation and I wanted to talk about that tonight prepping you know being prepared for every circumstance but we we don't have time so anyway Lord bless you tonight for coming out and I know it's getting cold and and it's it's hard to believe we still have a little bit of winter ahead of us huh we might have an ice storm or something but as soon as we have a beautiful day we're going to have the Pavilion uh dedication service our nice new Pavilion and and have uh set up some tables outside and have a it's a beautiful thing and and uh we have some nice lights to shine on the grass but the lights are so powerful the neighbor called me and said somebody left the lights on last night he said you got anything going on over there he said my so I I I run over here and his house was lit up like a football field I'm so thankful he called me first instead of the police but we we'll have fellowship and then we're we're having a dinner old people so uh so someone said that they wanted to know if you had to be married 40 years before you could come to the dinner well that would be maybe me and lesle anybody else in here been married 40 years oh well we got so there'll be three of us there we might as well just go over to uh Bobs and have dinner right but if you so it's it's not it's not for uh uh uh being married over 40 years is nowadays you probably couldn't find anybody in a nominal church that stuck it out that long you know especially because they have divorce programs and divorce Wednesday night and remarried singles you know what I mean and and then they got books you can read and check it off and then you put your stuff in the computer and they they match you I'd rather be matched by God wouldn't you I know what it's like to be matched by God Amen God got mine to me and just she dialed the wrong number and and uh I opened my mouth and I told her if I ever meet you I'll change your life to ever you know God held me at my word and so every day her life's brand new I'll guarantee you so she don't know what to expect but praise God you know what I mean that the way you want it isn't it isn't it huh yeah I I I can look back at different couples you know and I'm just grinning Madden Heidi I mean I'm just gonna say it that if you get mad at me that's okay but you know Matt come to the message and and that's not who Heidi married you know what I mean she wanted to know who's this guy you know all all of a sudden Matt went from just being a good old guy you know she used to bail him out of jail and all that stuff you know what I mean and and and and now he's uh he's just turned religious on her you know what I mean and she's wondering what's going on you know he just stuck with it you know what she done one day she he went and got one of them books he was reading and she started reading it amen I still have it as Vivid in my mind as it can be she finally stood up and said you know I can't fight it anymore this is the truth God knew what he was doing he had it all planned out from the beginning there's nothing going to break that he just knew it and that's how he is amen I like it when God does something do you believe you still can move amen I don't want him to move for power sake I want God to move for love sake I want our love call the power of God on the scene I don't have to prove God created the heavens and earth I don't have to prove God's A Healer I want to have a heart that wants healing and Jesus looked upon him and he had compassion he said get me a fish get me a loaf of bread I I want to have that when he come a pass and and those demons were there and he had compassion on them he didn't have to cast those demons out but he did and they didn't even want him in their country anymore but that's what we want church so you want to say brother McGary what are you talking about after the seven Church ages a statue of a perfect man you'll see a little line that says holy spirit a lot of them got that far and they went into gifts they went into discernments they went into everything but there's one step above it and that's Divine love and without perfect love you will not be there and that's the word of the Lord so let's press for the higher calling the higher Mark let's let the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit God bless you would you pray for me Tuesday I go in for my eye surgery as many of you know I went blind in my uh right eye and uh I remember just uh in fact I was standing right on this Pulpit about a year ago when I went blind in my left eye and I all of a sudden I went blind and I we called the doctor and he thought I had a stroke in my eye and we went to the doctor and he looked in there and blood had I broke a vessel and and it filled my eye with blood Well's happened on this side so they're going to go there and they stick three needles in my eye and I told them put me in never Neverland amen I want to experience the Rapture I want him to give me enough juice that I'm in the Millennium you know what I mean cuz I I I want to wake up in a you know next Thursday anyway and so they they stick a camera in your eye they stick a laser in your eye and they stick a suction tube in your I just want you to experience misery and Joy Company you know what I mean so I really want you to know what I'm going to be going through you know what I mean so uh it might cause you to fast in the morning but so then they they draw all the blood out and all the fluid in your eye they draw it all out then they take the laser and they find the little places is bleeding and then they they burn all those and then they pump new fluid in your eye and then eventually that fluid goes into your body and is replaced with natural fluid and you can see again so when I can finally really see then I can really start preaching but until then you're just going to have to take me the way that I am so I know you'll be with me in in prayer and and and everything and and it'll be all right and I I I I I I'm confident this is the way that God wants me to go if I was afraid I I would ask God to do something else but I I just feel good about it so I hope you feel good about it God uses doctors you believe that he uses music he uses everything so Lord love you love one another church and then let us go forward so we've been preaching the path forward you know where we want to go you know what we want to be I hope you join with us and and serving this message with Divine love letting the Holy Spirit which is EXC excuse me which is the love of God be manifested in our hearts and may everybody taste it because it's real God bless you brother Billy

loves us enough and he's shown you his love and and there's a Salvation that you possess there's a healing that you possess and what a precious audience that's been gathered here tonight and as we pray think of those who are not here that Grace would interject they wrote their testimony tonight they're not here there was testimonies being spoken but when Sovereign Grace projects that's right it rewrites the testimony let's just go before gracious Heavenly Father we're not relying on any any other testimony than that of Calvary father for the blood that rewrote our lives and Lord those who were once Sinners and doomed father Your Love projected and it apprehended us and now we can claim you as our savior the one who touched Our Lives father and when we were going one way you changed us father and that Grace has met us every morning Lord there's things that we do that would destroy our confidence father but renew our hearts in you and the power of Calvary and Lord You're un immutable you have not changed and your love for us has not changed father that's right so Lord we're speaking Lord that your grace would apprehend those that have yet to know you father Lord that you'd brood out over that seed father that you'd Quicken it to life and Lord that their desire and their heart's desire would be gathered in your presence to testify of the goodness that touched their lives Lord that healing would be manifested even now father for those who need your healing touch Lord that those who have gone astray that you as the seeking savior that leaves the 99 and goes to the one would go and seek that which is lost father Lord that your Holy Spirit could touch them where they're at right now father for Lord in your light father Darkness has to flee Lord this is our confidence father that your love has conquered all lord it's not even in our ability Lord but our trust in you Lord and your love for us is what has raised our faith up father to ask these things Lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise the honor and the glory Lord as we go from here father may you the be the meditation of our heart yes Lord the very heartbeat that we have may it be to you Lord continue to brood over this word that we've heard be with our pastor we ask that you keep them in the surgery father you'd guide the hand of the doctor Lord that where there would be the need of uh Sovereign Grace father we ask for it Lord we're dependent upon you Lord and we ask these things in the mighty name of our savior Jesus Christ [Music] amen above all [Music] power above all King above
