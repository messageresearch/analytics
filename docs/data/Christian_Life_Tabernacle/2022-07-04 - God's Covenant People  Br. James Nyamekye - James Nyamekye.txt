God's Covenant People
Br. James Nyamekye
July 3rd, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

visited Egypt that night it wasn't how big your head was hearing it but I trust that the Lord will help you to catch my accent amen us Brother David was saying uh I was born and uh some bizarre circumstances in a village where I was raised up in that part of Ghana uh at that time there was this some of you may have heard that testimony before if you have forgive me for that it so happened that there was inter-tribal war they tell me that during that war um uh my ancestors were hiding away in a cave and this Hunter who was a knife of his father's children he was sent to hunt for food or handful deer or something for for the Warriors instead he betrayed them to their enemies I don't know how he did it and so from that time when they succeeded in defeating the enemies they decided that the knife child should not live so they started killing them and giving them away and different things and happened to be my parents ninth child at that time so I should have been killed but there was a concession if you gave your child as a gift to God in the church then they will not kill that child so my mother took advantage of it and donated me as a gift to God in the Roman Catholic Church and children that were given to God as a gift were called Miami is a local name for God and she is a gift so that's how I came by that name yummy given to God so I thought that the Catholic church was my savior and I was a very devoted Catholic and in those days we did everything in Latin and if I went to church and the holy water they sprinkled if I didn't get any drops of holy water on me that day will be fasting and crying out so devoted but I thank God I was to be a Catholic priest I was waiting for this country priest to come take me from the village and then begin their training he never came I thank God he didn't but along the line I heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and I gave my heart to him that was 23rd December 1967. and I've never regretted doing that praise be to God uh so uh how did I get into the message I was the leader of a Christian Fellowship called scripture Union in my country it was a Christian a kind of society where people from different churches will meet and study the Bible together and I was a leader and I was choosing to represent my school during a conference and I had this man from Switzerland he he used a flanner graph and had a cross Red Cross and then he read Galatians chapter 5 and then he would take a the scenes listed over there these things crucified Jesus he was take one day it was like like piercing my heart each time he stuck one day it was like piercing my heart so when he was through with the sermon and in through the invitation I was right there I cried my way to Calvary cried my way to glory and then after that I wasn't feeling comfortable in the Catholic church I had not heard anything about the prophet or anything and so I I wasn't feeling comfortable we started witnessing in the Catholic Church so the categies the Catholic categies came an arrest and told me if you want to bring a chain go and start from Rome you can bring a change in the Catholic church start from Rome so they kicked us out I had a friend of mine so we didn't know which church to attend so I started waiting on the Lord fasting and praying then we had two missionaries from America that attended an all-night prayer meeting we had organized they came over I don't know whoever had invited them but they came over and testified of of God sending a prophet and uh but we had been warned in that society that a prophet a so-called Prophet arose in America and claimed to be Jesus Christ but God let him have an accident so that you know he had his bones broken so that is you will know he's not Jesus Christ so when they testified of this Prophet I I I couldn't go they were giving away books and tapes but I never went because I thought that that was the first prophet or something a friend of mine might have gone and he got a hold of some of the emergency books but when a teacher training school and like I guess the grammar was so horrible they threw the book Away and I happened to pick one of them on the ground and the title was very intriguing it's doing God a service not according to his will I had just been re-baptized in a in a Pentecostal Church the titles of fathers and Holy Ghost uh it so happened that I used to wake people up so that we could pray together and I was praying with this brother and the Holy Ghost fell on him he started speaking in tongues and the interpretation said go and be re-baptized for the Catholic baptism infant baptism is false so we come through the city of Kumasi looking for somebody to baptize me or what I knew at that time was immersion not the name I didn't know about the name but the immersion so we got this Pentecostal Pastor he said the only way he will uh he would be able to baptize me is to write my name in their Church book I said I don't care what you do with my name just so that I get the baptism so you take care of the name and now on my baptism so he did that and then I got my baptism but that was the same week that we had this uh all night and this man came and testified and then uh um I picked this book on the ground I read through it said I missed it I called the Revelation it should have been in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said I missed it again and for two solid years I was looking for somebody that could baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I couldn't find any so I wrote a letter dear brother Branham I had just have just been re-baptized in a Pentecostal Church in the titles of father son Holy Ghost I got a hold of your book titled doing got a service not according to Israel and I found out that it should have been in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I missed it again so how do I get somebody to baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I didn't know brother I might pass on you know so I waited waited and then after a while Billy Paul wrote back and he said brother Brown I'm mistaken away to be with the Lord but the message he brought is still true I hope that some way God will make a way for you to be baptized so he started sending me tips and books tips and books and I lived on the tips and books for so long and then there was this brother called Tommy Dillard who used to be from Fort Wayne Indiana he came over to our country as a missionary so Brad Billy Paul wrote to tell me get over to him and that was over a long distance a lot and the rules terrible but I took my mom and my nephew and my mother are just uh the night before the baptism the Lord opened their eyes and she she saw Visions a whole lot of things so we got down and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that was 1970 and uh I I kept I started preaching the the message of the hour right away and after teaching uh or at the middle level in my country for 10 years I felt the need to resign and be committed to the uh Ministry only and that's what I did it was a very difficult decision you had just a handful of people but I will tell you friends God is faithful he is provided and then he's been able he blessed me I got married and got five sons and and two daughters and Susie is here and I thank God for his Amazing Grace just uh before the lockdown I got to a point I started feeling terrible uh uh dizziness or vertigo very terrible case and it was increasing day by day no treatment nothing was helping so on November 21st last about two years ago I think it was 2020 yeah 2020 November 21st I also rushed the emergency and they did uh CT scan and found out it was subdural Hema tumor that's aneurysm blood flowing into your brain filling up every day so they did uh they ran all kinds of tests and they found out that the the rate of blood coagulation was bad so they couldn't do the surgery immediately meanwhile the blood was still filling up they won they couldn't do it my veins had collapsed they were not getting a sample blood samples and the the next day the same thing the third day and it was increasing and getting worse and I realized I was just passing out they will come to the uh special world where I was admitted to raise your right hand I will raise it up raise your left hand I'll raise it up they were expecting that with that rate of inflow of blood uh should be paralyzed or something but I had no outward symptom and the uh they felt that if they took me to the theater and I came back west of it means they have done it so somehow they they didn't want to do the surgery and then I told them I I told them hey take me to the theater God will take care nothing will happen they had to give me uh 12 pints of blood and uh one of them uh uh they took I'm all negative and it was hard to get O negative uh that quantity of blood and so one of the uh one brother in our church made a donation a blood donation not knowing that he was cancerous but he didn't know at that time so the Lord was so gracious that when they they tried to uh use that blood because of the pressing nature of the situation the I don't know whether they would have found out that out or not but they were working on it and then somehow one way or the other the Lord made sure that that blood was not added to the rest and by the grace of God they did a surgery they had what they call Bear holes they drilled holes through the cranium why here and uh 600 mules of blood oozed out there was so much pressure built in the heart one here and they drilled another hole there and it was terrible but here are my Believers all over the world who are praying for me and by the grace of God here I stand don't tell me that God is not the same yesterday today and forever you are too late Hallelujah I know I have I've met him as a savior and I've met him as a Healer not just these ones but a few other times and I've seen him do my two Works amongst his children who would dare to believe him and I realized that it's all because Jesus came to establish a new covenant with his children and being a very faithful creator he will always keep his part of the Covenant and tonight I would like to exalt exalt a little on God's covenant people amen the idea of a covenant did not begin in the New Testament it began in the old we all know that don't we and God calling people here and there and then we want to begin with Abraham to cut it short the Lord called Abraham out of uh cardia out of Babylon amen confusion and was going to begin a new race of people with Abraham his first name we know was Abram hi Father up father but he didn't have children and then we know the story of how God promised that he was going to have children with his wife Sarah but it took 25 solid years for that promise to be fulfilled he had called him in Genesis chapter 12. and he had said before him terms of the Covenant that he was going to establish between him and Abraham and Abraham's seed amen not just Abraham but Abraham and his seed amen so we finally Genesis chapter 12 and verse 3 down God spelling out the blessings that he was going to give Abraham if he obeyed his word shall we stand on our feet so I want to read Genesis 3. Genesis 12 3 very quickly and then we'll run through a few scriptures and to come to my climax so that we have time for the Lord's Supper and who you lay in the background for the reason why I believe Jesus Took the bread and he said this is my body broken for you and he took the cup he gave thanks they took the bread he blessed it but I took the cup and he gave thanks amen difference blessed but here he gave thanks that's Victory you give thanks after Victory okay so now the Lord has said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country from that Kindred from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show thee I will make of thee a great nation one a great nation I Will Bless thee amen and make thy name great you are a brown but I'm going to make that name great if I make it April him I add a portion of my hello him and I elevate your name from Abraham to Abraham him a great name amen so I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing so it's not enough to be blessed but bless them oh hallelujah what a promise and I will bless them that bless thee amen encourage him The Curse Of Thee and indeed shall all families of the earth be blessed so God was going to do a very special something that will reverse the curse that came to humanity fall in the Garden of Eden and was going to do it through Abraham and his seed after him the Lord bless you as you take your seats and I keep standing foreign and the purpose was to restore men to the original beginning of relationship and fellowship and then he works with him in Chapter 13 when he had called him he did not call Lord but Lord had followed him and we all know brother Branham pray for us God's word calls for total separation from unbelief so Lord had to be separated from Abraham in order for the blessing to materialize and then we find Genesis chapter 14 Abraham meeting Melchizedek Hallelujah who was without father without mother without beginning of days and without ending of time he still what he is I met a man that named his child Melchizedek I said hey man you don't want any more children do you he said he said I want more children you couldn't have anymore I said change that boy's name you will not do it only one child how do you expect to have more children why you name your child no she said it why he did it in a way and then in Genesis 15 we find God doing something and it's so important to understand why what a covenant entails so that if you become God's covenant child you understand what that means then you can take your position of authority because you are God's covenant child there are many kinds of covenants spelled out in the Bible their Covenant of friendship we all know Jonathan and David they are the Covenant of friendship amen there is also a Malachi chapter 2 there is a covenant marriage covenant that's why you know when marriages have been blessed oftentimes the preacher can say I'll propose to you the marriage covenant amen I propose to you the marriage what Covenant there's an agreement a covenant and we will find out what the Covenant entailed Jeremiah 34 Verse 18 we'll come to it later on but let's look at Genesis 15 Jehovah now is narrowing the relationship down with Abram so we Genesis 50 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in addition brother Branham in the message says is this the time he explains that if a vision is of god it will be scriptural or a continuation of the same amen if a vision is of the Lord it will be scriptural and it all it will be a continuation of the word of the Living God hallelujah what makes a person a true Prophet is the way they stay with this written word of the Living God too many preachers some scriptures don't really matter one thing I find about William Mary and Branham is that even though God used Supernatural vindications every word of God mattered to him the answer to Matthew 24 24 that brother George was preaching about is Matthew 4 4. false prophets false teachers performing science and wonders in so much that if possible they will deceive the very elect what is the answer to that Matthew 4 4 men shall not live by bread alone bye-bye not some of the words but by every word and this is the only message amen that emphasizes every word every word you know some of these people they might be Mighty workers or Supernatural science might follow them but they don't care about everywhere hop step and jump they they will hop step and jump over some stitches and when the Lord Jesus came the Old Testament how many know that but Matthew 4 4 was also in in Deuteronomy 8 4. let's look check it out Deuteronomy 8 4 Jesus was a word prophet he was the way Deuteronomy chapter 8 I like you to read the whole chapter when you have time I I enjoy reading that chapter so much Deuteronomy chapter 8 it was let me just read a little part of it all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and I shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God let thee these 40 years in the wilderness that shall what remember God doesn't want us to forget he wants us to be observant he wants us to remember the things that he does for us amen do you remember has God ever done any good thing in your life how many will raise their right they are left hand up and say amen God if somebody is sleeping they will raise up their right hand they'll find everybody raising up their hands and then they jump up because they were sleeping how many raise their left hand up and say yeah the law has done a lot for me left not sleeping thank God amen an evangelist went to a church and he said how many of you don't pay tithes their hands were up and they passed he turns to the past the pastor look at the thieves in your church oh my someone evangelists are really you know their cases thou shall remember Hallelujah thou shall remember all the way which the Lord that God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thy Hut whether thou wolves keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and Freddie with Manna which thou knew was not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that men that have not lived by Bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord that man lived does that scriptures believe by bread alone but by how many ways every word praise the Lord that is quite amazing so we go back to our our Genesis story and quickly we are building this solid foundation concerning God's covenant people so we are with Abraham excuse me kind of Genesis 15 still after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I'm thy Shield and by exceeding great reward how will you feel if Jehovah told you that this evening fear not 365 times in the Bible it is written be not afraid [Music] 365 times the Bible says Be not Afraid Satan's strategy is to inject fear as soon as you fear you are whipped fear of death fear of this fear of that fear of disappointment all kinds of phobias phobia fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what would that give me sin I go childless and the steward of my house is this elieza of Damascus Abraham said behold to me that has given me no seed and lo one born in my house is my name and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel shall be thy name and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be who put the stars in the sky what are the stars hanging on if I can put stars here I can put babies in your womb amen praise the Lord and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness these are very deep things and Paul takes them in the Book of Romans and he breaks them down God counts it as righteousness if we can take him at his word without any feeling Jesus never asked anybody do you feel it no he asks do you believe it so you've got to take him at his word Heaven and Earth will pass away you know some people have permutations that one of the best permutations in the Bible is Mark 13 and 31. Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away 13 31. another one of them numbers 32 23 behold your sin will find you out permutation turning it around so this shall not be done by he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel shall be thy name he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him what was Jehovah doing to Abraham why would he bring him out to look at nature to observe nature he is telling Abraham look I am the creator of all these things if I can do these things there's nothing I cannot do for you the god of nature is the God of this Bible amen so Abraham believed God and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness when the Lord Jesus was alive you are now we're not here we we have had faith by hearing okay if we accept what the word of God has said without being present or feeling anything God counts it as righteousness unto us as well take time and study Romans chapter 4. he said that God counted it as righteousness is waiting for our sake as well not just for Abraham he will count it as righteousness if you can take him at his word without any feeling so it went on on the Lord now establishes a covenant with Abraham and if you look at the rest of it how that it was to bring three years this animal Dynamo and some pigeons and turtle doves and then God establishes a covenant with Abraham praise the Lord now what does that Covenant entail the prophet of God has shown us that different countries have different ways of covenanting entering into agreements some handshake some they throw salt on each other and so on and so forth different ways of having covenants but Bible Covenant let's look at Jeremiah 30 34. and verse 18 that word covenant has a connotation or etymology of cutting amen cutting so in Jeremiah chapter 34 Jehovah is talking about children of Israel not keeping the outside of the Covenant he had made with them as a nation through their father Abraham Verse 18 says and I will give the men that have transgressed my Covenant which have not performed the words of the Covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in two when they did what cut the calf into and and pass between the past thereof see people don't realize brother Branham was a scriptural prophet he will illustrate something and you might think is he took it from the moon or the group of Jupiter or Mars no no praise the Lord this guy should stop making noise so I'll put it and put him away then to help him to keep quiet okay so I will give the man that have transgressed my Covenant which have not performed the words of the Covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf into and passed between the past thereof the princess of Judah and the princess of Jerusalem the eunuchs the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the past of the calf so this is showing us a picture of how the covenants the covenants were enacted they will cut split the animal into two and and stand in between them and vow to each other and the conclusion was this if I don't keep my side of the governor let me be like this anywhere all right so it was always something had to be cut into and then the two parties of that Covenant stood in between the pieces and they took vows are you following me okay so this is a clear picture of how covenants were made in the Bible and the thought began from the Old Testament and continued on on on on on Amen so God had a people with whom he had covenanted and those people Abraham's children had become slaves in Egypt through their jealousy of Joseph's brothers and because they were God's covenant people is a reason why he had their cry and then he sent Moses to deliver them why because they were God's covenant people God was obligated to take care of his own his Covenant people people that he had covalented to protect to secure to provide to lead there became his portion amongst men those Covenant people were God's special portion amongst men they were so special to him he was under obligation to take care of them his Covenant people remember there would be war in heaven the devil and his angels fought if you ever name your children Michael pray for them because Michael led the Army and defeated the devil and threw him down here and his demons on Earth the name Michael spells doomed to the devil he doesn't like that name that name Michael means there is none like God Hallelujah he doesn't like that name he wants to be a challenger of Jehovah so they were Michael pray hard if I Michelle pray hard all right anyway I know what I'm talking about praise the Lord so now Jehovah has established a covenant with Abraham any seat in Genesis 17 he came to ratify the Covenant Genesis 17 he produced this a seal unto that Covenant and it was called a seal of circumcision you remember if Moses the great Moses he had refused to circumcise his child and God was going to kill Moses Exodus chapter 4. God was going to kill Moses because he was not keeping the seal or the sign of the Covenant amen so it became so imperative that people observed God's covenant they should keep their part of the Covenant they are part of the agreement and God it will draw Jehovah's protection and everything he is a faithful God he will never break his Covenants Psalm 89 verse 34 let's look at that put your finger in the Genesis story and let's turn to Psalm 89 and verse 34 and then you can read the entire chapter the entire psalm 89. eight nine verse 34 the almighty God is talking about how he does not break his covenants he says my Covenant will I not break amen so if you are dealing with somebody who is so faithful and he's assuring you that if he ever brings you into a covenant he will never break that Covenant that should bring you Assurance under no circumstantial whoever fear once you are God's covenant child because he's saying I will never break my covenants nor alter the word the thing that is gone out of my mouth even though the soothsayer melam knew numbers 23 19. even melam could say God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that they should change his mind or repent as he said and will he not do it has he spoken and will he not make it good I receive commandment to bless and he has blessed and I cannot reverse it oh Hallelujah Jehovah says I have blessed and I cannot reverse it so if God ever blesses you no man can reverse it and if he curses you nobody can reverse it he will not bless what he has cares and you will not kiss what he has blessed amen that is Jehovah God praise be to God so that is why he says about his covenants and in the Old Testament Jehovah God begins to guide his children the hour of Deliverance had come at that drawn line Exodus quickly now we find Jehovah having Abraham's seed Deliverance how that they will be in bondage for 400 years and after the 400 years you bring them out of a mighty hand people are offended that God used William Branham maybe they wanted to be used and unfortunately God chose William Branham he didn't choose them amen so God chose Moses to be his hand people were expecting a huge hand to drop from the sky God says I'll deliver them with a mighty hand so everybody was looking into the sky for a huge hand to drop down and deliver them instead of a hand dropping from the sky here comes a man a stamina that Moses couldn't even speak freely kind of what kind of a person is this he couldn't even talk properly you know God will always chose somebody that is weak so that the glory will be unto their lord he will not share his glory with no man that's right praise the Lord so Jehovah God in Exodus look at what he's saying the people of God had multiplied in Egypt and the Egyptians were afraid that they were getting too many and they might take over the nation and so they instruct the midwives to commit abortion huh they instructed a midwives to kill the babies especially the baby boys kill them and they are doing the same thing today abortions six million abortions committed within a short period in this country and the world over Somebody went to see a doctor with a little it's a doctor you see I have just a two-year-old boy and my my wife is expecting that we can't we want to space out so I want you to abort the baby the doctor said oh don't worry about the one in the womb I will kill this one this one so that one can have the chance say doctor you are my address I'm a murderer how about you telling me to kill the one in the womb why you tell me I'm a murderer if you are not a murderer you ask me to kill that child in the womb amen Jeremiah 1 4 Jehovah said of Jeremiah before you became fetus in your mother's womb I had ordained you a prophet he was not even yet in the womb let alone when he started life and you tell me that that's not life it's just what is it Okay so we find because they were God's covenant people they Cried unto the Lord for deliverance from the task masters of Egypt and what happened and Moses God had zipporah and jokibet God had uh uh uh uh uh uh Miriam to give birth to this boy and the decree had come that they should kill them but because the soil was a proper boy boy a proper child they were not afraid of the king's commandment this they kept him the spies the fbis and CIS and kgbs were all over the places but the Holy Ghost could preserve that child can you keep a baby from crying and yet God kept that little boy for three months and they could not get him and then he gave instructions and we know how that God had pharaohs daughter to pick him up from the water take care of him and then uh Miriam suggested that you could bring somebody to take care of the boy for him for her and Moses Moses Moses's mother took care of her own child and was paid for it yeah don't tell me that God is Not hasn't got a sense of humor the very person that was going to destroy Egypt was raised up in the house of pharaoh and they paid the mother for doing it oh wow the Lord will fool the devil all the time so he came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God had their groaning verse 24 and God remembered what what did he remember his Covenant and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham Isaac and with Jacob the only reason why God sent a deliverer was there had been a covenant between him and the children of Israel and they were in one day she was watching his timepiece not that he didn't know that they needed Deliverance but he was waiting for the right time God has set times and seasons for doing whatever he has to do just because it hasn't happened you know we are in a society where everybody has to have it fast fast fast fast food fast track fast forward and everything fast fast so if you pray you don't get a fast answer it's like God didn't hear you by Israel Abraham's seed you have to have patience you have to wait on the Lord 24 25 years Abraham started not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God is going to be God says so and it's going to be Hallelujah he held on did God disappoint him neither will he disappoint you keep on keeping on keep on holding on Amen so God remember this the groanings of his children he remembered his Covenant to Abram with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and got her respect unto them and that was the reason why he delivered them with a mighty hand and they went on on the night of the Deliverance we know the Exodus story he told Moses go and tell the children of Iraqi can't you see why the devil wants us to lose confidence in the spiritual leadership God has given us everything Moses told the children of Israel and Joshua continued sound as stupid Go and Kill a lamb and put the blood on the door maybe you just go to a new house and then go and kill the lamb and put the blood on the door post outside there and blood all over my new burden God didn't say paint red paint he said blood and he specified the type of animal they were to kill an alarm without blemish and they had to watch it for four days and the hour came and he showed them how they were to apply they took it he saw David is that plant is such is such a simple thing a very common everybody can apply it amen it's not complicated everybody can exercise Faith you don't have to have a PhD put him down you don't have to have a pad to believe God anybody can can believe God it's simple he's so amen no Bulls and then lentil and just sleep behind the blood and he comes over and he's not really stressed whether you are toothless or you've got plenty of teeth whether you are green yellow black that's not what he's looking at he's looking at the black that's how he's looking at so if you have applied the blood you are safe Hallelujah the Covenant is in the blood why Blood tonight we are approaching the Lost supper please get it real get it why Blood turn with me to Leviticus chapter 17. why Blood all the time blood blah blah why why Blood Leviticus 17 Reading from verse 10. and whatsoever whatsoever man there be of the House of Israel all of the strangers that surgeon among you that eateth any manner of blood I will even shut my face against that soul that eat their blood and will cut him off from among his people for the life of the flesh is in the blood thereof are you listening amen how many are listening Say Amen oh good if you're not listening Say Amen oh nobody said they mean so everybody is listening now Jehovah says for the life of the flesh shall we all say that in the blood so where do we find the the life of any flesh in the blood thereof so if God is to transfer his life to his children he has to come in blood his life has to be wrapped in his blood amen that's why Jehovah became man that he might get blood and then transfer his life through that blood amen so Jehovah continues and he says uh for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makeeth an atonement for the soul so it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul Hallelujah the life of Jehovah is in his blood that's why Acts 20 and verse 20 Paul wrote to the Ephesians he called the Elders of the church in Ephesus and he said take heed to yourselves let's look at that acts 20 and verse 20. and see that Paul refers to it and he says it's the blood of God Ephesians sorry Acts chapter 20 and verse 20. Acts 20 20. I want us to read it together all right okay here Paul speaking how I cut back nothing that was profitable unto you but I've shown you and I've taught you publicly and from house to house keep on please testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greece repentance towards God and Faith to us our Lord Jesus Christ verse 28 let's jump over to verse 28 because I want to save the time thank you therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost had made you overseas to feed the Church of God which he have purchased with his own blood what did God use to purchase the church whose blood God's own blood why Blood because the life of every flesh is in the blood thereof so in order for that life to be transferred or imported to his own children Jehovah had to be made flesh and blood and because the children are Flesh and Blood he took on the same Abraham's seed Flesh and Blood he took on the same so now we see why Blood and blood is always involved in a covenant making when Jehovah is making a covenant blood is always involved so the Bible the Old Testament is actually old Covenant when you say the Old Testament to actually say in the old word covenant and based on what blood animal blood if the Covenant of animal blood has so much power and glory to when Moses went for the law his face was shining how much more power of God in the New Testament Hallelujah in the Old Testament Covenant produced so much Mighty works so much Supernatural people depended on the blood Covenant animal blood Covenant they have such a such power with the Living God how should we Children of the most high God in the New Covenant the blood of Jehovah it should produce Greater Works amen so that was Leviticus 17 explaining to us why Blood and then God instituted the Passover and I see the blood I will pass over you so that Passover Festival went on and on and on I was reading this from I Googled it up I felt like checking on how the Jews in the Old Testament observed they are they are passovers festival and I had this interesting thing that I discovered during the Jewish Passover ceremony three laws of unleavened bread called matzo are presented three laws are presented they are placed in a bag called uh Matt zoha Matt zo Tosh the bag called mazzo torch each loaf being in his own compartment during this Festival Cedar the masotosh is opened and the middle love called bread of affliction is removed and broken into the bigger portion is wrapped in the linen bag called an africoman which means it comes later the official man is taken out of the room and hidden symbolically buried somewhere in the house by the leader of the celebration and hidden so three loaves of bread each in its own compartment the middle one is taken and broken and the bigger part is wrapped up and is hidden somewhere in the house and the people are commanded to look for it and it is brought at the end of the ceremony and broken up and distributed amongst the people and that middle one is called the blood the bread of affliction and that was the Passover ceremony the unleavened bread past seven days they ate unleavened bread why the middle one look at the thieves on the cross why here why here by it was Jesus the one that was Our Redeemer and and you can they can have father son Holy Ghost but in the middle one so Jesus I'm sure during that Passover he was the Master of Ceremonies he takes the middle one and he lifts it up and he said this is my body that is broken for you do this in remembrance of me if there's anything that the people of God ought to remember is that Supreme sacrifice I'm a pastor I've been pasted now I wonder how how that people can neglect the Lord's Supper brother Branham said I love to take the Lord's Supper every time that is the Supreme sacrifice that you don't have to miss it no matter what the cause you don't have to miss the Lord's Supper Jesus said do this in remembrance of me there are all kinds of memorials some are negative remember Lord's wife Memorial of rebellion but this is memorial of Amazing Grace and you me you mean to tell me you're a Christian and you don't want to remember what he did for you that day at Calvary that was Jehovah God establishing the New Covenant so in Matthew 26 look at what Jesus that same ceremony that passed over he is the Master of Ceremonies the one is there the bread is there and then look at what he says Matthew 20 says 26. Luke 22 29 but Matthew 26 26 I want to take that one down Matthew 26 26 that I will soon wrap up because I know uh we must have time for the Last Supper so Matthew 26 20 says down um here the Lord Jesus himself he's facing Calvary and then this is what he did Matthew 26 I'm sorry yeah and 26 okay and as they were eating eating what a Passover Jesus Took bread you so what bread do you think you would take there are three of them to the same ceremony so he took bread the middle one I'm sure and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take it this is my body and he took the cup remember the bread what did he do to the bread and what did he do to the cup he gave thanks so he gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it drinky all of it let's read the next together four this is my blood of the New Covenant new testament which is shared for the for the for many for the remission of sins Hallelujah and Paul picked it up in First Corinthians 11 and he says as often as he do this he drink that cup do it what he remembrance of me if there's anything that you and I ought to remember and and should remember it is this and also in John 6 he said except you eat my body and drink my blood you have no what no life why because the life is in the blood so actually you drink that blood next time you eat my body and drink that blood you have no life in you the life is in the blood so when we come to the Lost table we are coming not communion communion is actually a two-way Affair talking to him and he talking back to you that's the real communion but this is called the Lord supper it's so unfortunate that people is supper in the morning people eat supper in the morning it's the Lord's Supper in the morning as language lost its meaning foreign it has to run the Bible must go run in continuity so that we don't break the rhythm of the word it has to run in continuity it is a continuity of the past over ceremony he was the lamb that was crucified that night he gave his blood he gave his life it the token is a sign that somebody has given his life and if I accept it I have received the life of The Giver into me and as long as he lives I will live also what a wonderful privilege to come and to partake of this uh the elements of the New Covenant then you have become God's covenant child even though one third of the Heavenly Angels fell to the devil to tests are on our side hey did you hear that one third of heavenly Angels fight to the devil but two things are on our side we are in the majority we are more than conquests so as tonight to come to the table remember you are being invited to renew your Covenant with Jehovah and I thank God that he sent this Prophet to establish this and to make it so strong so that we don't do these things ritualistically but we do these things with Revelation and understanding of what we are doing so you come to this table and you remember what would have happened to you if Jesus had not gone to Calvary Revelations chapter 5 when the cry was made for a king's My Redeemer one that will take our place that we might take his place there was silence in heaven and John wept why would he weep if there was no Kingsman Redeemer it means whatever we lost through Adam is lost forever but if we find a worthy one then there is the restoration of everything that we lost Hallelujah if we find a worthy one then it means the restoration of everything that was lost in the Garden of Eden did we find out where they were John was crying and then one of the elders said don't withdraw the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he has taken the book ing the Seven Seals there are no sexy Seven Seas thereof and he tends to look for a lion and he sees what a bleeding lamb shed for the Holy Blood so that the life of God in him can come upon the believer so our Prophet says if anybody I don't care how sinful you are God is rich in Mercy you come lay your hands on the Islam and confess your sins he's already shared that Holy Blood for you the life in that blood will replace that sin loving nature that came through sexual reproduction to replace that and then become God loving automatically you love the Lord you are you were born an automatic sinner you don't have to learn to sin I have never seen any parent calling their children I've never seen any parent calling their chair and say say stupid stop it full full no children just grow up and they can get angry little babies get angry where does it come from the natural birth if you are born once only you are going to hell Jesus said you must be born again so the problem is with wrong birth born again because the first bad is wrong but we have to be born again to receive that new nature that goes with a new birth I'm born again automatically I get the nature of my birth I don't have to learn patience I don't have to learn anything I just have to be born human why do you behave like a human being you were not born a goat why would you call the son of a goat say God it's born by a goat right if I'm born by God I'm a son of God so you take the nature of your father oh blessed be the name of the Lord so tonight don't just come to the Lord's table and as a ritual like the children of Israel the Passover Festival became a ritual at the time and God didn't like it we should never never allow what Jesus did for us to become a ritual don't just come to church and warm the pew come because Christ has done so much for you and you are showing your appreciation for him by giving off your best and you don't know when you are called to be called and that will be your last time last opportunity tonight might be your last opportunity I left my own biological brother just when I flew out of my country my father we had my mother had 10 children I'm the last one the next one before whom I I came after whom I came excuse me he died just when I left he I talked to him and he was okay but he's gone four church members have died since I left my country it's not long ago you don't know when your car to be called so whatever you think of doing for God we better do it now don't postpone anything that you ought to do for the Lord whatever you want to do for the Lord please do it right quick for time is our time and as brother George preached this morning the time is now the signs are all over the places you ever see that if you really believe this message one of the things that are being fulfilled so rapidly around us to shut such desperation in every soul to check up your life to make sure you have applied a token the last Angel was coming you want to make sure you have applied the token and you are standing you are staying behind the blood that was the only provided place of safety that night and God has sent a message to provide the only position and place of safety to stay with the word of the Living God and all these things that Jehovah God has given us don't you don't you think that God knows the antidote to the power of the devil he's raised a standard against Satan when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Living God raises standard against him they don't like this message and the reason is one time I was going to wash down I'm closing I was going to watch that the word came to me who was the most hated person that ever lived can you tell me who was the most hated person that ever lived anybody the Lord Jesus Christ and who was the only one that was born right who the only one that was born right and lived sinless who how come how do you put them together brother Billy president David how do we put this together that the only man that lived a sin life sinless life also was the most hated person that ever lived can you put can you reconcile this so is it a new one and any surprise that the most hated person and the most hated message is our message why because it's the only message designed by Jehovah to defeat the Devil in our day so hold to God's unchanging everybody oh build your own some things eternal [Music] God bless you Brother David I'm sorry for [Music] oh sweethearts I'm changing amen I enjoyed that that's my kind of preaching right there I love feasting on the word I love seeing it put together I love seeing Jesus Christ revealed in every scripture and what a blessing what a great opportunity you have tonight to renew your Covenant to rededicate yourself to come back under the blood amen that was shed for you and accept the forgiveness you've got to accept it he already knows well you're a yet sinner he died for you he knows all your mistakes and and he knows all your failures but what he looks to is is that heart that cries out Lord I want to be delivered I don't want to do this I want to enter into the Covenant I want to renew my Covenant you know communion is one of the ordinances that the prophet of God said if you don't take it you will not be there that's that's pretty tough you think you're going to get in on your revelation no you get an in on the obedience to all the word of God Amen you get in because you accept the sacrifice he provided just like Abraham accepted the promise that God gave him amen and that's the faith that we have so there's healing and communion there's forgiveness in communion because you're going to enter back into a fellowship back into a covenant if you've been away this evening you've been backslid you haven't been on fire to the Lord I I'm going through a rededication process in my life where I want to get rid of the negative thoughts I want to put more confidence in the Lord I want to be patiently and wait for him and I want to see him appear that's what I'm looking for every day is to wait and see him appear because he promised he would show up this is the day of his appearing where he appears in the life of his Saints and comes on the scene how can he appear he appears in his Covenant which is his word so let's stand if the brothers we go get together who's ever doing the communion with us let's turn over to the 11th chapter of the book of Corinthians in the first book that Paul wrote to the Corinthians and he said I receive this from the Lord and I'm delivering it to you and so he's now transferring the Covenant he's transferring that Covenant to the Gentiles that now they have a covenant not of blood and not of of goats and the blood of beasts but the blood of the Lamb of God amen so let us read for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take Eid this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do as often as ye drink it in remember he do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup that's the key is the examination of yourself and when you see those short spots renew the Covenant when you see that you've sinned renew the Covenant except the pardon accept what he's done for you and renew yourself in his spirit he says for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world Amen what a wonderful opportunity that's presented to it wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together under judgment or condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come amen as the Brothers prepare you just take a moment in your heart to tarry one for another put somebody in the your heart today that maybe has a request our brother that lost his father Lord we ask that you bless him father those that have been sick in body we ask you to touch them father many sisters across the land are Desiring father that you would grant them a child Lord

as we rededicate our lives and we father Purge our days of foolishness and idleness and father we return back to the labor of your kingdom father that we would do what is our rightful Duty to do that we would resume our reasonable service Lord and that our covenant which is such a blessing to us it's so one-sided Lord that we're the recipient of everything father may we just re-enter and rededicate ourselves as we partake of this breadth which represents your word amen for the kingdom of God is Not bread only but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God in Heavenly Father this wine here father that represents the shed blood the life that was given that we may have life he gave his life that that life might return on us and that life is eternal Lord no one took his life he laid it down and if he laid it down he can give it freely to whomever he will father May tonight in this communion may we come forth and take this bread and this white and may we also take your life into our heart may we also take a renewed commitment into our hearts may we ask for more of you this evening that we can be more like you we can be the true Shining Light and the true representation father we do this in remembrance that people can look at our lives and remember you and we ask that you would grant that to us this evening in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen God bless

[Music] foreign [Music] world will give him I will praise him oh praise [Music] oh his blood has washed away [Music] Oh Praise [Applause] [Music] oh his blood has taught you know why we sing and we lift our hands to the Lord because each of Our Lives has lots of complications and lots of mental battles but what you've got to do is you've got to open that channel up you've got to open the window you've got to open the door you've got to open the channel and you start to feel that presence come by because it's like if you put all the water of all the oceans and you put all that pressure in one small tube that's how much God wants to bless you that's how much he wants to break into your life come fill you but you've got to open the hatch you've got to open the door and when the spirit moves and you you start to sense this presence you've got to open it up you've got to let them come past your your mind past your thoughts past everything just let them come deep down on the inside and start you can just start to feel his it's not always the great Shout [Music] most of the time is just such a sweet reverence in such a sweet presence let's just turn ourselves to him [Music] foreign [Music] you can think of all his goodness let's read in the 13th chapter of the Gospel of John what love knowing whom would betray him he girded himself and watched their feet what a love story now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he raises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girdeth himself after that he poureth water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord thus thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do without knoweth not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet you know a lot of people say that to the Lord every day he wants to bless them he wants to forgive him he wants to cleanse him and they just don't let him do what he loves to do most and that's take care of us wipe away our past and give us new breath every day so make that personal because we all have a little Peter in us don't we Peter said unto betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and at
