Description:
The Clearing Of The Deed
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Service: July 14,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

make a quick announcement there's going to be a brother's breakfast uh this saturday and uh we're going to be fellowshipping around um possessing the gate of the enemy after a trial brother brandon preached that in 1964 in march so we'll be meeting here at the church in between nine and 11 a.m this saturday so we hope you brothers can make it out amen let's just go ahead and maybe they can just play something as we approach the lord lord jesus thank you for calvary lord there's many songs that have been written and penned about the blood that you shed lord truly lord we're just doing our best to express in this mortal tongue the power the grace the cleansing power the love that you showed to us lord but oh god something in our heart is longing to cross over jordan something in us is longing for sweet beulah land something in his lungs to see you lord face to face and then and only then lord maybe we can really truly start to understand the depths as we believe lord it'll take eternity for us to search out all your riches lord something in our heart longs for that day but we just trust that tonight would just be another step in that direction lord that you could just come by and break the bread of life lord and minister to the needs of your brine lord we're a needy people as long as we're on this side lord we have afflictions in our body we have questions lord we have needs and we're so thankful to know that you're still the same yesterday today and forever that you are our healer that you are the dissolver of doubts lord that you're still breaking the bread of life and distributing it to your people so we just commit the service now to you and ask all these things in your name the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord if you have your bibles let's be reading a few places we'll just start in genesis chapter 2. thank you musicians genesis chapter 2 will read verse 16 and 17. maybe we'll just start with 15 there it says in the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die amen you may have your seats we just pray a blessing on the reading of the word and we just also want to read out of romans 8 11. says but if the spirit of him that raised jesus christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by the spirit that dwelleth in you and let's just also read out of revelations chapter one verse 17 and 18 says and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death i think maybe we could just stop right there and we could have us a little jubilee amen to think that god had given his word there in genesis and he told adam he said the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die and you look over here into revelations and you'll find that here is one standing because now the penalty of sin upon man was the day you eat thereof that day you shall die but we look over here into the book of revelations and it's now saying that i am he that liveth and was dead that's a very crucial part of that statement because it took one that could have power to lay his life down but also power to take his life up again so here is the very one the very kinsman redeemer standing there and saying oh yes that penalty of sin that was given back there when it said in the day that you eat thereof that day you shall surely die well he's standing there and say yes i am alive and i was dead i paid the penalty of sin but i am alive forevermore and we just want to read a quote here out of the easter seal just to maybe glean a little out of this here we don't think we'll be long tonight but uh just reading out of the easter seal paragraph 101 might be a little lengthy reading but it says now they go up to the day of pentecost to receive their abstract do you know what an abstract is is when a deed has been cleared they went up there to receive their abstract and they become quickened oh what a thrill they had bit they had they had bought the land been bought for them they had received it is that true or not we see him raised up but now what about us we are witnesses we stood and seen the man crucified we seen the clouds come over the earth and the darkened skies and the earthquake it shook and had nervous prostrations and they put him in the grave they speared him in the heart with the spear and they took his body down and laid it in the grave of joseph armathea and then they find out that on the third day he raised up again and as the disciple said we are witnesses of this we've seen him raise up we know he is alive now what did that do that took all the fear out no wonder jesus said fear not i am he that was dead and is alive forevermore see it taken all the fear out when they did that now but when they went up to pentecost there they received the quickening power the power that made them alive now there's where i think that you presbyterian and methodist brethren you do receive potentially on believing on the lord jesus christ but the abstract hasn't come yet that's the clearing of the deed god gave abraham a promise abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the covenant by the seal of circumcision and god gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to get clearance on that deed so maybe that's what i'm just uh something that was illuminated to me uh brother branham was saying to those presbyterian and those methodists he said you're potentially believing on the lord jesus christ but the abstract hasn't come yet he said that's the clearing of the deed so he's saying here that you have to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance is when everything against him maybe i could say it like this is when everything against you has been stricken off and you got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours and everything that is on it belongs to you oh my i just in reading that i say well whatever it is i want the abstract oh i want everything to be stricken off i want all the promise of god everything that's in the word of god oh i want it it's mine i say it's for you but see we have to have the clearing of the deed well maybe there's there's those of us that are sitting here and you're like well brother matthew what does that even mean hearing the abstract title deed and the clearing of the deed and he sent down the abstract and and or the title deed of redemption well that's a good question maybe we'll just take a few moments and and walk through the scriptures and maybe walk through a few things and we'll try to just uh uh by god's grace be illuminated here as we find out in genesis as we would read uh our text is uh now here in genesis 1 27 it would say so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him now now that was a holy image now when you look in the mirror that is not the image that the scripture is speaking of right now uh don't don't think that when god created man in his image no but this is just a shadow of that that was a holy image that god had created him into male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so you you see here that this dominion over the earth this eternal life this image of god that that adam was made in this was perfection this was god's doing and it was good that god would create man in in he would um adam was was like a god upon the earth he he had the power of the spoken word and you know if he maybe wanted to move something this way or that way adam had full control for adam had dominion over the earth he was a god of the earth and that was that was what god had created him to be but something is going to happen where adam is going to lose this position and this image and position that he had with god there in the beginning so as we just move through our scripture we look into first timothy 2 14 as we're just trying to to catch a little grasp of adam here uh timothy would write there in verse 14. he'd say and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression and the prophet of god would say it like this out of the church age book he would say that adam sold the human race into sin that he might have eve for he loved her so adam was not in the transgression adam was not deceived but adam was now mirroring the very heart purpose of god to be a redeemer that by love the very one that he loved he would take on sinful flesh knowing that he would have to suffer the penalty of death and die so in doing that we know that adam had lost his dominion and his position that god had given to him and what had happened there now is what it did is it allowed for satan to come in now satan's going to start to come into the earth and he's going to start to pervert he's going to start to destroy he's going to bring death upon the earth and now this holy image this holy veil that was upon man now as lost adam and eve walked out of the garden of eden they no longer have that fellowship with god and now all of a sudden there's stickers and there's briars and there's things starting to pop up that was never intended to be there but lucifer that that angel that had fallen that wanted to exalt himself above god he wanted to be like god he wanted to be worshipped as god and now that great perverter now he he's bringing death and destruction upon mankind uh uh recently i was at a customer's house and and we were just looking at some trees to do a bit and this little puppy was trying to follow us along and and i i couldn't help but notice this this little uh puppy was just you know kind of a it was a little odd guy he he you know he was just kind of uh twisted to the side and his head was looked back and and we got to talking and the puppy was born with some type of disease his body was all i twisted up he couldn't uh really i used his back back legs but he but he was a little uh a miniature um sheepdog i'm trying to remember the the the name of those type of dogs uh uh oh help me out no it was haley just sold a couple of them yeah it's a mini australian shepherd oh and it had the gray little hair on it and the blue eyes and everything and it just oh it just had a smile on its face and it was all happy and everything and i just looked at it and something in my heart i just was vexed because here this puppy was it was just so bright but yet it was in a crippled condition and i just i just looked at that dog and i just thought to myself oh my don't worry it won't be it won't be very long it won't be very long that that you're going to have to suffer in these conditions it's not going to be very long that mankind has to continue uh to have to put up with this perversion and this sickness and this death that has has been thrown down upon man because of the burden and curse of sin and we find out that god had told adam there in genesis 1 28 he said multiply and replenish the earth now the prophet of god would point this out in marriage and divorce he would say that was to be fulfilled by spirit spiritual multiplication it was not to be by sex or by sexual desire that this commission or this this word that god had given to adam would be fulfilled but it was to be by a spiritual multiplication by the word so now that adam when he had come to wife and and and she had she had uh uh uh uh been impregnated by the serpent we find out that eve had swapped the word of god for personal knowledge and what it did is it now left this promise or this commission of god here in genesis 1 28 it left it unfulfilled he said be be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth but the replenishing of the earth that adam had done was not in a holy image it was not in the image of god because even when you pick it up in genesis 5 you'll find out that that that the scriptures would say that adam bore seth and he born bore a son in his own image it was in in his likeness and what image and likeness was adam in adam was in a fallen nature he was in a fallen condition he no longer had dominion over the earth that was not the the multiplication that god had had in mind but when he had given the commission to adam he wanted to bring forth many sons of god into manifestation in the same very image of god with the power of the spoken word that's what he wanted to do but he lost this he lost uh uh that holy image and so now this genesis 1 28 it's just left laying there it's left there uh unfulfilled because eve had swapped the word for personal knowledge you say well brother matthew what do you mean that even swapped the word for personal knowledge well i'm just quoting the prophet but i want to maybe make an emphasis here as the prophet many times would i want to i want you to know that the womb of your spirit is your mind this is very poor important for us to to maybe uh uh uh dwell upon for a few moments here the womb of your spirit is your mind and the prophet of god said your mind is a channel and so we know that what had happened is the serpent or the most subtle beast in the field was able to beguile eve and and start to give her reason and reason her away from the word of god and where did eve first conceive before the physical act was ever committed eve first conceived in her mind then it was in the conception of her mind which is the womb of the spirit that she re received that lie of the devil and then upon believing that lie of the devil and allowing that seed to come into the womb of her mind now that it had taken root there that it brought forth the physical act now this isn't just a history lesson this isn't just a story for us to understand uh uh uh uh just in one facet of what happened back out there in eden but it's very important for each one of us to understand that satan is trying to attack you the very same way today the very same way tonight he's trying to attack your mind you wonder why you you're not getting the victory you want you wonder why you're not getting total deliverance because you're allowing the womb of your spirit to take on seed that when lust or sin is conceived that it bringeth forth death and you're seeing the very manifestation of the seeds of lady asea or satan's eating as you continue to feed on those things you're starting to see those weeds and those things popping up in your life and you wonder how it got there that's because you're allowing these seeds to be sown into the womb of your mind which is your spirit we have a responsibility to possess these vessels in sanctification and honor the scripture would say along these lines don't you know that whatever you yield your members to right that's to whatever you yield to that's whose servant you are so if you're going to continue to yield yourself as a servant unto unrighteousness if you're going to continue to yield yourself look i i we don't have to go down all the channels but i can say this as a a son and daughter of god you know that the things that you're doing and the things that you're feeding on if it's not promoting and propagating a spiritual life and a spiritual atmosphere where you're in one heart and one accord and you're just walking in the spirit and you're walking in the channel with the lord like adam would have been walking there in the garden of eden when the god would come down in the cool of the eden oh if you're not feeding on things that would nurture that relationship i wonder what are you feeding on what are you yielding your members to and you wonder what happens because you've allowed seed to come into your mind and that is the womb of your spirit and all of a sudden you wonder why your spirit is defiled it's because you've yielded your members to unrighteousness oh so we we we we want to yield ourselves to the word that's as we're reading here in the easter seal the prophet would say oh oh that the word he wants to quicken your mind i say oh god quickened my mind are quickened me away from the things of the world quicken me away from the knowledge of the world quicken me away from the education of the world quicken me away from the entertainment of the world quicken me away from all those things lord may i have a single eye for you and you alone oh may we be like rebecca may we be able to look at our houses and our lands and everything that we ever thought oh that would be ours maybe as an inheritance or maybe we looked out on the land we thought we would go here or go to this school or go to that job or have this career but when something came beckoning oh and that eleazar call came something inside of rebecca oh it was a time of decision she said oh i will make my decision i will go i have a single heart that i will go be united with my bridegroom oh i pray o god that is the bride of jesus christ we'll come and touch us such a singleness of heart that we'll be so uh uh uh fetch by lady osea will be so vexed by the atmospheres that satan's eden is producing i wonder when the last time you went into a restaurant with the last time that you went into a maybe a public venue where's the last time you got around with those ungodly people and you felt nervous in your spirit oh i wonder the reason why we don't feel nervous in our spirit is because we're getting lulled to sleep we're just getting a little comfortable hearing ladies say it it just ain't too bad to rub shoulders with the people the people of the world oh but i tell you if you've ever gotten an atmosphere of prayer if you've ever come into the presence of god and you're walking and you're in communion with him and you've been fellowshipping with him and the word of god is breaking to you oh and you've been such a surrender to prayer and all of a sudden you go out into a restaurant you're going to feel a little awkward yes sir you're going to feel like i really don't belong here very good i say oh god help us to to strive to live in that atmosphere and in that presence where we're not yielding our mind and our members to unrighteousness so as we're moving through here we find out that adam was willing to take on sin to redeem his wife and now this right to eternal life this right to dominion this title deed what happened to it we're trying to answer the question you say oh brother matthew you keep saying the clearing of the deed what was this title d well you see man was made in the image of god he was made to have dominion over the earth he was made to have eternal life and to live forever and that possession that mankind was given by god that adam had possession of he lost that possession because of sin so he no longer was in possession of that title deed and that deed now had a lien or a debt on it because the word said the day you eat thereof that day you die and so now adam has lost his holy image he has lost his dominion he has lost his position in god and now we find him uh in this place of a fallen state and picking up out of the breach we'll read here the title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith it went back in the hands of the almighty god what a thing all right waiting what's it doing it's in the hands of god waiting for redemption claims now if we can pick up in our bibles and we'll look here in revelations chapter 5 as the prophet is pointing out here what is this book doing now it is in the hands of god waiting for redemption claims and as we read out of revelations 5 1 here it will say and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and as the prophet would go on he'd say in john in the spirit standing up here in heaven he's just been lifted up now from the church ages see i saw the church ages and then he was taken up in the fourth chapter he said come up higher i'm going to show you things that will come and he saw one sitting upon the throne with this book in his hand in his right hand think of it now and then in this book was the title deed to redemption and it was sealed with seven seals this is a book of redemption now what does redeem mean redeem means to be brought back or to buy back or to bring back to the original owner so then god has a plan that now that adam man that was made in his image had lost that holy image he had lost that title deed so god now is going to redeem it back to the original owner look when god had given it to adam he intended for adam to keep it but adam lost it so now god by his oh by his wonderful plan of redemption was going to make a way that he would redeem it back to man again oh we find ourselves looking into this scripture here as this book now is in the hand of him that sat upon the throne but adam couldn't redeem it adam needed him he needed redemption himself the day you eat thereof that day you die and ever since that day every man or woman that's ever come on the face of the earth would be borne by sexual desire and so now there's going to be an angel proclaiming who is worthy to open the book who is worthy to to look thereon or loose the seals and the prophet of god would dramatize this any breach he'd say well there was moses standing there there was elijah standing there there was all of the prophets that standing there there was the apostles standing there and oh he looked into heaven he looked under the earth and there was nobody found worthy to open the book well that's why we'll find in romans 3 23 paul would write for all have sinned and all come short of the glory of god no man had possessed the glory of god and was righteous enough or could escape that penalty and that curse of sin that they would be a thoughtless sin sacrifice that would be able to pay the penalty of sin and would even have the power to lay their life down and power to take it up again oh there was no one in heaven there was no one in earth david would say in psalms 51 5 you say behold i was shaping and iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me oh because of this original sin act every man and every woman that was ever born by sexual desire is subject to the law of sin and death subject to the curse of sin subject to bondage so i will find paul writing here in romans 7 24 it's all wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death i wonder if anybody's ever felt like paul what i would do good evil is present with me oh what i would i would i try to do good i can't do it and when i go to do good i make a mistake oh you feel so beat up and you just feel so cash down you feel like i'm i'm never good enough and and i've been trying over and over and over again it just seems like i can never get it right oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death first john 2 16 would write for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world oh my i that starts to make me feel guilty that makes me start to question who i am and where i came from and to know my faults and my failures and my past and it says for all that is in the world well that's the only this is our you know that's the we've been given five senses to contact our earthly ole miss the only thing we've ever known oh my you just could you could try to think back to your earliest earliest memory maybe some can think back further than others maybe you can think back to two years old maybe you can think back to three years old maybe you could think back to four years old but but that's as far as you can go and so when you you look at your your memory and you look at your life and you look at your senses that have been given to you to contact your earthly home and your mind and your memory you say oh you look at the scripture it says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but as of the world and something in you says well i'm pretty worldly i've done a lot of bad things but i i i just want to maybe share some good news tonight i i want to maybe preach the gospel the good news but i want to say this yes by your first birth naturally you are of the world but i want to tell you tonight that is not where you originated you did not originate by sin you did not originate by a natural birth that might be the only ability in your mind and in this body to contact your earthly home but i want to point you to the prophet of god out of the easter seal in chapter in in paragraph 62 if they can maybe pull that up but remember the stature that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now for you for there's some part that's in you i'll just read it again they'll get there eventually if anybody's back there there they are all right we're there paragraph 62 but remember the stature that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now oh well yeah that devil's trying to whisper in your ear tell the devil to shut up just go on and tell him he's the father of lies and the very reason why he keeps trying to highlight these parts to you because he's afraid that when you catch the revelation you're going to be like a house on fire on a windy day and doom devils are going to be on the run you might as well just accept who you are you might as well just finally give in quit feeding on the things of the world and give in to who you really are quit being a hypocrite quit living and digging around in the things of the world quit going over to your friends quit doing those things that's not who you are you're a son of god you belong in his presence you belong in the house of god you belong filled with the holy ghost you belong living a victorious life he's just trying to keep you from your full potential but remember the statue that you're in this morning if you wasn't in this thinking then you're not now for you there's some part that's in you that's eternal and eternal only belongs to god there there's some part that's in you that's eternal and eternal only belongs to god look you don't belong to sin you don't belong to the world you don't belong to the devil you don't belong to unrighteousness your job don't own you your career don't own you your school doesn't juristic your life there is an eternal part of you that belongs to god you were in his thinking from the very beginning and eternal only belongs to god that means you belong to god you're god's property i say devil take your hands off of god's property that's my brother that's my sister that's my children you belong to god you don't belong to the devil you don't belong to the world quit living for your job quit living for your education quit living for your family live for god and he'll live for all of those other things through you you want to be a provider of your home sell out lock stuck in barrel and give your heart to god and you watch god come on the scene oh the reason why you continue to struggle the reason why you continue to battle the reason why you can't figure out what you want to do with your life because you haven't fully surrendered to him you want to look at fully surrendered oh my there were some apostles when they got that quickening power they weren't out there trying to get educated they weren't out there trying to build a bigger house they were dropping out of their school they were selling their house they had all things in common look up your redemption josh nine quickening power it took all the fear out of their life you're so afraid of how you're gonna make ends meet you're so afraid if you can pay for your college tuition you're so afraid if you're gonna be able to pay the bills oh get that quickening power it'll take all the fear out of you oh hallelujah i'm not talking about a beat down a spineless church i'm talking about the church of the living god that's filled with that same zoe life the same one that stood there and said i am he i am alive i was dead but i'm alive forever more i would ask you where is he tonight in you in you and you what are you afraid of oh hallelujah let hell rage unless satan didn't come you're going to put every single one of them devils under your feet that's what you're here for glory hallelujah you don't belong to the world you belong to god you're god's property oh you just bypassed your theophany you become a flesh man to be tempted of sin that's what the prophet said out of who is this melchizedek you just showed up in a fallen nature here oh and a debt you couldn't pay that's why jesus would say in john 3 6 he would say that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit of spirit my will not that i said unto you ye must be born again i want to say the same calls going out tonight you must be born again young children you've been baptized you've done well you must be born again you're not too young to start craving and hungering and thirsting for righteousness to be fulfilled in your life parents you wonder why things have been so difficult around the house lately that's because yes your children have been baptized and the devil knows that there's a soldier that's arising in the ranks that is called to tear his kingdom down called to go in a rapture called to go on a body change and now he's fighting against your home he's fighting against your children he's fighting against the unity in your home i say as a word of the lord bind closer together than you've ever been bound before that little division in the home make it right children get along with your siblings parents don't grieve your children let's let that love of god dominate the atmosphere in our home for paul would say well just fellowshipping on that just a little bit longer you must be born again but i want to make this statement that it's only the seed of god that can be reborn for the prophet would say out of the church age book he'd say we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn now we don't need to try to get out onto a lot of doctrine many times we accept people's definitions we accept their profession but we have been properly taught we know the word a lot of people profess that they've been saved or they've been born again but they have no quickening power they have not the life of our lord on display to prove that they got the goods and i say not as conviction or to condemn anybody but being that you are a seed of god you are his elect there is greater potential and manifestation for the spirit of god in your life and what we want to do church is we we want to spread out a little bit we don't want to get complacent but we we want to start to have dominion over the things that god has given us we can't be wishy-washy we can't be wishy-washy with our time we can't be wishy-washy with our family we can't be wishy-washy with our job we can't be wishy washy was jesus christ ever wishy-washy then we're called to make a stand in this hour to redeem the time romans 9 15 would read for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that showeth mercy i want to ask you this question and maybe it doesn't require an answer but just for thought when did god show you mercy when did god show you mercy as i uh pondered that question as it came to my heart when did god show you mercy and that scripture came to my heart there in revelations 13 it says he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world oh god's mercy was enduring for you even then way back there before every one speck of stardust was ever spoken to existence he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world god was already expressing his love and his mercy towards his bride his elect the very thoughts that he had in his mind and he placed your name on the lamb's book of life that you could never be lost oh my talk about grace talk about mercy for romans 5 8 would say but god commendeth his love towards us and that while we were yet sinners christ died for us oh the prophet would say it like this that god wrapped himself in a blood cell he took on sinful flesh that he could pay the penalty of sin that it could fulfill the law of redemption well brother matthew what are you talking about you're talking about title deeds you're talking about law of redemption well let's just try to cook it down and make it real simple we can understand that adam had a right to or adam had possession of eternal life and dominion over the earth and he was made in the image of god and he had a holy image the word said the day you eat thereof that day you die so adam transgressed the word of god so he lost that position that was given to him so he no longer has possession of that and because god had given it to him it's gone back into god's hands and now he's holding that title deed in his hand all right are you with me but now god in his great plan leviticus 25 25 would say this that if my brother be wax and poor and have sold away some of his possession now now adam sold the human race into sin so if he had sold away some of his possession and if any of his can come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold oh my that song just comes to me he paid a debt he did not owe i owed a debt i couldn't pay i needed someone to wash my sins away i now can sing a brand new song amazing grace all day long christ jesus paid a debt that you or i could never pay john 1 32 would say this just moving along try to tie this together it would say and then john bare records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him out of the lamb and the dove the prophet this is just so beautiful i wanted to share this he says oh what a confirmation to see a lamb and a dove come together heaven and earth united god and man united until this time man was not united there was that great chasm that had separated god from man but now that that promised word that was spoken way back there in genesis what did it do it found a betting place in the virgin mary who said be it unto me according to thy word and it brought forth the messiah and he says oh what a confirmation to see the lamb and the dove come together heaven and earth united god and man united and why the sins of the world was kissed away and all the roughness and all death and all sorrow and all sickness was kissed away when the lamb and the dove become united together oh what a kinsman god now coming and taking on sinful flesh that he might pay that penalty of sin what was he doing he was accomplishing the work of a kinsmen redeemer he was paying the debt that adam couldn't pay he was paying the debt that moses couldn't pay that elijah couldn't pay none of them could have the power to lay their life down and take it up again oh what was he coming to do he was coming to clear the deed for every son and daughter of god he was coming to claim back everything that adam had lost eternal life and dominion over the earth and that holy image now the kinsmen redeemer god now condensating and taking on sinful flesh has come to fulfill the kinsmen redeemer and redeem us back just picking back up in the breach all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of god waiting for redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the redeemer is to take it back you see where we're getting to now we'll watch this fellow sitting upon the throne all right waiting for redemption claims it's redemption now let's turn into our bibles to revelations chapter 5. we already read verse 1. and i saw a strong angel proclaim me with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no man in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not i think this is one of the most sublime i believe even brother branham says it that way the most sublime portion of scripture he says weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof paragraph 118 out of the breach what is this book of redemption this title deed abstract title d you say abstract what does abstract mean it means it searched all the way back to its beginning like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of jesus christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the creator again you've become a son of god abstract title deed is held in the hands of almighty oh my its redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by adam and eve oh my brother branham claps his hands together once it says what are that dude to a born-again christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve lost what about it brother the possession of that deed oh what is the abstract it's that quickening power it's that holy ghost it's that potential it's that earnest that if you have that quickening power you have that eternal life you have that dominion you have everything that adam and eve lost has been restored back again oh revelations 5 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i say blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever i wonder if we've truly got a revelation oh i see god illuminate oh open up our mind let us understand your words give me the revelation oh when you catch the revelation of this message that that sealed book that the the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed the kinsmen demon has come and taken the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne he was worthy to take the book and open the seals and loose them thereof thank you lord hallelujah but he just didn't stop there what did he say take the book take the book eat it up thou must prophesy again take the book we've seen it dramatized many times oh we we have spiritual food and due season store it up take the book eat it eat it up take the book but you know what we're doing we're too busy running around everywhere here he is here here's the message there take the book brother here take it take it take it oh no where you going take it take the oh hey you take the book oh you got to run to work oh you got to run oh you oh you got you gotta pick up the kid oh you gotta take the book take it eat it up i'm sorry i'm too busy i gotta go to this i'm too busy fitting in the lady i'll see you i'm too busy uh hanging out and satan's eating oh i got so much to do i don't got time to eat the book take the book let it quick in your mind to the word oh that you can be that spiritual multiplication oh hallelujah that you can be the fulfillment of genesis 1 27 fulfilling the original covenant oh take the book eat it up the clearance of that deed means everything against you has been stricken off we just got to accept this saints quit reasoning out quit trying to figure it out it's for you you don't belong to the world you belong to god you're eternal just down the home stretch a few more minutes romans 8 1 would read like this see we're having a problem accepting the word we're having a problem eating in the book oh if no one was found in the earth and in heaven that was worthy to all but the clearance of the deed means everything has been struck off all your sins all your faults all your failures the fact that adam sold the human race in the sin the clearance of that deed means everything against you i think i want somebody in your heart i want you to say everything against me satan keeps holding you under bondage because of past failures right now you are saying everything against me no not but well not that no that said they said that and that would do that and so it's there for no say what he said in your heart you profess everything if you've repented of your sins and you've accepted that shed blood of that innocent lamb of that kinsman redeemer who bore that reproach to calvary i was i was witnessing to a man one day and he he just was of the opinion nope i can't i can't accept an innocent substitute basically he's he was too much of me i'm not saying in a negative way towards them because he's a good guy but he just felt like i can't i can't i didn't pay for it i can't accept it if that's what i deserve that's what i get and i saw his daughter uh pull up the house and i said i want to ask you a question then i said just for four point you loved your daughter yeah i was like would you give your life for he said i wouldn't think twice about it i was like imagine you've given your life for your daughter and they're saying nope no nope i i deserve to die and he just started to weep because he caught something that he could relate to let it go let it go you're forgiven everything against you has been struck enough accept that and i'll take this word into your heart as we read romans 8 verse 1. there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit all condemnation means that damnatory sentence that curse of sin that day you eat thereof that day you die there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus when were you in christ jesus you were in him before the world was ever formed that eternal part with you was back there all the way in the beginning oh i want to say you are free for the law of the spirit of the life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death oh you're free jesus christ is here you're free you you don't have to live in condemnation anymore you don't have to live in guilt you don't have to live in sin anymore whom the son has made free is free indeed [Applause] oh my what are you saying brother matthew i'm saying you're free from guilt you're free from lust you're free from depression you're free from bondage you're free from pornography you're free from having to feel like you have to wear tight clothes you're free oh why don't you let the word of the lord pronounce your liberty and why doesn't something inside of you amen back the word and say i'm free i'm free i believe it i accept it thank you lord there is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in christ jesus oh for the law of the spirit of life of jesus christ has made me free from the law of sin and death oh thank you lord romans 8 11 says but if that spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you you realize that jesus christ is fulfilling the commission of spiritual multiplication in the bride by being quickened by being quickened by this quickening power quickening the word which you are is bringing forth that many membered bride of jesus christ oh my oh my how beautiful it is that quickening power oh he said there in that first quarter he says you have the abstract you've got the seal the title deed is yours everything belongs to you oh my i just want you to start to think about something i desire of your heart that's according to the word hold it there oh yeah i ain't trying to act like i know something but i know there's i know people are are are thinking right now like i said i just know that because you're my brother and sister i know you're thinking about your son you're thinking about your daughter you're thinking about your husband you're thinking about your children they belong to you you're healing your peace your health go ahead hold it in your heart we're not here for man please we didn't come here to i mean we we we didn't come here for show but no i believe god is here right now to quicken his word to you and he's wanting to tell you something that you have the abstract you're my elected predestinated sons and daughters of god you were with me in the very beginning when my word said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god you were there oh you are in that logos you have to be if you're part of him you oh my goodness we could run without identification but my goodness you're part of him oh praise god just in closing let's read this quote oh my healing's yours your children are yours the holy ghost is yours you can have it you don't have to wait any longer you don't need some tarian meeting but by divine promise repent of your sins be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the musicians would come and when we believe this is easter seal paragraph 409 and when we believe on jesus christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him god recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the assurance it's the guarantee that everything was ever held against you oh thank you jesus some of you ain't gone as far as others have gone but i think old prostitute girl there was a meeting down the road simon had called a meeting and there were sadducees there and people that had invited him just to make fun of him but all this ill-famed woman she she knew that that was her only chance she even thought he'll know where i got the money from she said that's that's my only chance if i could just get testy and there she washed his feet with her tears oh my imagine the suspense what will he say well he rejected me and jesus said simon i came here i came to christian life tabernacle tonight you didn't greet me you didn't worship me you didn't even lift your hand you didn't even open your heart i was pleading with you i was crying out to you i was giving you the very words to set you free but you let the presence of god go unrecognized but this woman by the time she's got here she hasn't stopped washing my feet with her tears and he looked at her and said your sins which are many i forgive you you are forgiven oh if you've never experienced that saints i don't care if you've grown up in the church i don't care if you've ever gone out in the world you meet that kinsman redeemer there's a charge laid against your life you were born in sin there's a claim held against the deed for in that book of life everything you ever thought of is recorded prophet said your thoughts ring louder in heaven i have much to be forgiven of maybe we should just all stand to our feet maybe we ought to just start right there where this woman was washing jesus feet with her tears i say lord forgive me i plead the blood of jesus christ that was shed at calvary i realized lord i'm guilty i'm guilty as charged i was born and sin shaped in iniquity i come into the world speaking lies and i still ain't got a handle on my life lord i need your blood i plead the blood of jesus christ that you forgive me lord oh he says it's the guarantee that everything that was ever held against you you thoroughly repented hallelujah and the property is boughten and you hold the abstract for the assurance let somebody try to put you off the land say he belongs in and you with the abstract in your hand let them try to do it there ain't a law on the land that can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of god's proof and abstract that the baptism of the holy ghost has recognized us in jesus christ we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him amen the old things what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinions changes our notions it sets our affections on things above the smoking the drinking the gambling and the things you used to do is dead it's beneath you you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already because you were seed the reason you can be quickened that's why your redeemable church that's what the prophet said non-seed is not redeemable he's redeeming you back to where there never was no sin he's redeeming you back to eternity what was the threefold mystery purpose of god to express himself in jesus christ the kinsmen redeemer second to have preeminence in his bride and third where are we going we're going back to eden what a plan of redemption amen the clearing of the deed i say we ought to just rejoice a little bit say lord everything's been stricken off the title deed has been cleared i don't have to fear death i don't have to fear hell i don't have to fear my faults my failures my past my condition i belong to you lord or maybe in your own way why don't you just lift your hands to him oh we had a wonderful prayer service last night why don't you just lift your hands and tell him you appreciate him tell him that you love him tell them that you thank them lord jesus we just bow our heads before you lord father we're crying out to you and just thanking you lord for your mercy and for your grace lord when we were unlovable you loved us lord when we were dead in sin and trespasses lord you loved us lord jesus you're so rich in mercy you're so rich in grace lord to think we live in an hour that you've called us lord to rise above all the nonsense of the world to rise above lady ocean come out of her you my people and not be a partaker of her fornication oh god you've you've called to us like you called to john come up hither and lord we're just wanting to lift our heart to you say lord we we we bid you come lord we're laying everything down at your feet lord we thank you that you paid the penalty for sin we thank you for the clearing of the deep that everything has been stricken off that we can have the abstract and know that every promise to god belongs to us oh we worship you lord we thank you
