[18:02] how gracious heavenly father
[18:05] we're here to express the love that we
[18:07] have for you

[18:11] loved us

[18:14] life to us
[18:16] you told us there's no greater love
[18:18] than to give your life for your friends
[18:21] your heavenly father we're so grateful
[18:23] for that love

[18:35] more abundant on us for us dear heavenly
[18:38] father we've come here this morning

[18:43] where two or three are gathered together
[18:45] you'll be in your mid you meet the miss
[18:47] and we believe that you will now miss
[18:49] this morning we pray that you may come
[18:52] by and touch heavy heart
[18:54] you may come by and speak to every
[18:56] single heart that you may heal us jesus
[18:59] we pray for the
[19:01] vessel that you use to speak to us we
[19:03] pray that you may sanctify his lips and
[19:05] that our worship may be pleasing to you
[19:08] this morning thank you jesus for
[19:10] everything you've done for us we commit
[19:13] this service and our lives into the
[19:14] hands in the name of jesus christ we
[19:17] pray amen
[19:20] amen
[19:21] amen we're happy to be gathering his
[19:23] presence this morning i want to welcome
[19:25] everyone both that are online and here
[19:28] present man as you invite foreign god
[19:31] bless you
[19:48] good morning
[19:50] we're going to look in psalm 66 this
[19:52] morning
[19:56] i was reading that yesterday and uh
[20:01] verse stuck out to me in verse four
[20:03] go ahead and read that real quick it
[20:05] says all the earth
[20:07] all the earth shall worship thee
[20:10] and shall sing unto thee
[20:12] they shall sing to thy name
[20:15] selah
[20:17] any time you see that word
[20:19] sila
[20:20] it's an instruction to pause it's a
[20:22] musical term just to pause have the
[20:25] music stop but
[20:26] you know more than anything it's an
[20:28] instruction to stop
[20:30] and to consider
[20:33] to reflect on the significance of what
[20:35] was just said
[20:38] and so it caught my attention that that
[20:39] verse says all the earth
[20:42] shall worship thee
[20:45] and it occurred
[20:46] it occurred to me that that's that's a
[20:48] promise that hasn't been fulfilled yet
[20:52] you know it's a promise
[20:54] a reminder
[20:56] of where things are headed
[20:59] all this that's going on around us is
[21:01] coming to the point
[21:03] that all the earth shall worship thee
[21:07] isaiah 45 23 says this
[21:10] is the lord speaking it says i have
[21:11] sworn by myself
[21:14] the word is gone out of my mouth and
[21:16] righteousness
[21:17] and shall not return
[21:20] that unto me every knee shall bow
[21:23] and every tongue shall swear
[21:26] philippians 2 verse 9 we know this well
[21:28] it says wherefore
[21:30] god also hath highly exalted him
[21:34] and given him a name which is above
[21:37] every name
[21:38] remember in verse 4 of psalm 66 it says
[21:41] they shall sing to thy name
[21:44] it says that at the name of jesus every
[21:46] knee should bow of things in heaven and
[21:48] things in earth and things under the
[21:50] earth and that every tongue
[21:52] should confess that jesus christ is lord
[21:55] to the glory of god the father finally
[21:57] in revelation 15 4 it says who shall
[21:59] fear thee o lord and glorify thy name
[22:01] for thou art holy for all nations shall
[22:04] come
[22:05] and worship before thee
[22:08] you know we know that's not where we at
[22:10] where we're at today
[22:12] is we look at all the
[22:13] the voices the trouble
[22:16] the pestilence
[22:18] the pressure
[22:19] the perversion it's all around us
[22:23] remember there's a day coming
[22:26] this is all under his control this is
[22:28] his mighty hand positioning all things
[22:30] so that one day all the earth will
[22:33] worship him
[22:35] but it's interesting here in psalm 66 as
[22:38] he spends some time speaking of that day
[22:40] there's another pause
[22:43] and it changes its focus
[22:45] in verse 8.
[22:46] now instead of all the earth
[22:50] now it's bless our god ye people
[22:54] it says in verse 8 oh bless our god ye
[22:57] people and make the voice of his praise
[22:59] to be heard
[23:01] which holdeth our soul and life
[23:03] and suffereth not our feet to be moved
[23:07] you know while there may be a day coming
[23:09] when all flesh will worship him there's
[23:10] a people on the earth right now
[23:13] that are worshiping him
[23:16] so how do we worship him
[23:19] you know certainly with
[23:20] singing and with prayer
[23:23] praise
[23:24] absolutely that's a part of worship but
[23:26] there's more
[23:27] to worship than that
[23:30] you know there's an old saying that goes
[23:31] the highest form of flattery is
[23:33] imitation
[23:35] you know while that may just be
[23:36] something that men say
[23:38] there's an element of truth in that
[23:41] real worship true worship is when
[23:44] someone absolutely surrenders their own
[23:46] identity
[23:47] to take on the identity of someone else
[23:50] happens in the world all the time you
[23:52] have celebrities you have sports figures
[23:53] and people will absolutely lose
[23:55] themselves trying to dress the same way
[23:58] and talk the same way and live the same
[24:00] way and look the same way
[24:01] they're worshiping that individual
[24:04] well it's no different than when a
[24:06] people lays down their identity
[24:09] and takes up his identity
[24:11] that's the highest form of worship there
[24:13] is
[24:14] it says in john 4 4 john 15 it says
[24:17] greater love hath no man than this
[24:20] but that he lay down his life through a
[24:22] friend
[24:24] so there's a people on the earth right
[24:27] now while we're waiting for that day
[24:30] true
[24:30] worshipers who do so by laying down
[24:33] their life that he might live amen
[24:36] they bear his image
[24:38] they declare him
[24:40] not their own message not their own
[24:42] image not their own will not their own
[24:45] anything
[24:46] that when they see us they see him
[24:49] that's the highest form of worship that
[24:51] there is
[24:53] finally it says in verse 18 of psalm 66
[24:56] he says if i regard iniquity in my heart
[24:59] if i'm pursuing my identity
[25:01] my message
[25:02] my image
[25:03] the lord will not hear me
[25:06] but i like what it says in verse 19
[25:08] but verily god hath heard me
[25:12] you know and why is that because there
[25:14] was someone on the earth that was a true
[25:16] worshiper
[25:18] do we have some
[25:20] true worshipers in the house today
[25:22] maybe yeah
[25:24] those who lay down their own image
[25:26] their own life that his
[25:28] might live
[25:30] there's a day coming
[25:32] where the whole earth will worship him
[25:33] but in the meantime let us
[25:35] worship him
[25:37] with with all of our heart let's go
[25:38] ahead and read that together psalm 66.
[25:42] make a joyful noise unto god all ye
[25:45] lands
[25:46] sing forth the honor of his name
[25:49] make his praise glorious
[25:51] say unto god how terrible art thou in
[25:54] thy works through the greatness of thy
[25:57] power shalt thine enemies submit thy
[25:59] souls unto them
[26:01] all the earth shall worship thee and
[26:04] shall sing unto thee they shall sing to
[26:06] thy name selah
[26:08] come and see the works of god he is
[26:11] terrible in his doing toward the
[26:13] children of men
[26:15] he turned the sea into dry land they
[26:17] went through the flood on foot
[26:20] there did we rejoice in him
[26:22] he ruleth by his power forever his eyes
[26:25] behold the nations let not the
[26:27] rebellious exalt themselves say
[26:31] oh bless our god ye people and make the
[26:34] voice of his praise to be heard which
[26:36] holdeth our soul and life and suffereth
[26:39] not our feet to be moved for thou o god
[26:42] has proved us thou hast tried us as
[26:45] silver has tried
[26:47] thou brought us us into the net thou
[26:49] ladest affliction upon our loins
[26:52] thou has cast men to rise over our heads
[26:55] we went through fire and through water
[26:58] but thou brought us us out into a
[27:00] wealthy place
[27:02] i will go into thy house with burnt
[27:04] offerings i will pay thee my vows which
[27:07] my lips have uttered and my mouth had
[27:10] spoken when i was in trouble
[27:12] i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices
[27:15] of fatlings with the incense of rams i
[27:18] will offer bullocks with goats selah
[27:21] come in here all ye that fear god and i
[27:24] will declare what he hath done my soul
[27:27] i cried unto him with my mouth and he
[27:30] was extolled with my tongue
[27:32] if i regard iniquity in my heart the
[27:35] lord will not hear me but verily god
[27:38] hath heard me he hath attended to the
[27:40] voice of my prayer
[27:42] blessed be god which hath not turned
[27:44] away my prayer nor his mercy from me
[27:52] amen god bless you have your seats
[27:57] let's see
[27:58] he brought me out of the maori clay
[28:00] amen

[57:34] and he with me god bless you may be
[57:37] seated
[57:44] it's nice to be in the house this
[57:46] morning uh lord this morning the few of
[57:48] us that are able to uh
[57:52] gather out together and
[57:56] fellowship around
[57:58] the things
[58:00] of the lord we just trust that the lord
[58:03] will certainly
[58:05] be your
[58:06] portion this morning
[58:11] you know
[58:14] last week i just addressed a little bit
[58:17] of
[58:19] the thing
[58:20] that's going on that has been brought to
[58:22] my attention and
[58:24] as you know um
[58:28] there's been videos sent out and things
[58:31] sent out about
[58:33] uh you know about the message of the
[58:35] hour
[58:36] and uh
[58:38] one set of videos as you know
[58:40] uh
[58:41] claims to
[58:43] basically be
[58:46] be called a trial
[58:48] and uh and you know and i i thought
[58:51] about it and i prayed about it and i
[58:54] i'm not gonna spend much time on it
[58:58] because uh i've come to
[59:02] the
[59:03] conclusion
[59:05] of the jury
[59:07] i know what the jury is going to
[59:11] what the verdict
[59:13] is going to be
[59:16] and
[59:17] i think a lot of times in a trial
[59:21] that
[59:22] both sides
[59:24] that are putting someone on trial
[59:28] they go through great lengths
[59:30] of the makeup
[59:33] of the jury
[59:34] they find out if people think this way
[59:38] and think about that way
[59:40] and so when i stood back i said i i
[59:43] looked at
[59:44] who is the
[59:47] jury
[59:48] right what's the jury made up out of
[59:52] and the jury's made up out of believers
[59:57] make believers
[59:59] and unbelievers
[1:00:02] that's
[1:00:02] who is
[1:00:04] there
[1:00:05] and
[1:00:06] we
[1:00:07] saw that in the
[1:00:10] the trial that you have
[1:00:13] is that each side presents their
[1:00:16] evidence
[1:00:19] now
[1:00:20] evidence is
[1:00:21] a very
[1:00:23] uh
[1:00:24] different type of understanding
[1:00:28] he said
[1:00:32] on the other hand evidence is something
[1:00:35] that is told by someone
[1:00:38] that has to be accepted
[1:00:40] only on belief
[1:00:44] the evidence
[1:00:45] and you present the evidence
[1:00:48] and the reason i'm coming to such a
[1:00:50] quick
[1:00:52] conclusion
[1:00:54] of
[1:00:55] the verdict
[1:00:56] in all of this
[1:00:59] it's called you look at the evidences
[1:01:03] and there's different types of evidences
[1:01:06] there's 12 different types
[1:01:08] of evidence and there's anadolical
[1:01:11] evidence that's where you compare things
[1:01:14] there's just all these different words
[1:01:16] for example there's counter evidence and
[1:01:19] all these things for example if i was to
[1:01:22] say
[1:01:25] everybody's favorite food is pizza
[1:01:29] and then someone would say my favorite
[1:01:32] food
[1:01:33] isn't pizza
[1:01:35] my favorite food is hamburger
[1:01:38] so that
[1:01:40] says that that's not everybody's
[1:01:42] favorite food because this person's food
[1:01:46] that evidence goes back and forth
[1:01:50] that evidence is uh
[1:01:53] and then there's comparative evidence
[1:01:55] and there's character evidence
[1:01:58] and if you consider the character of the
[1:02:01] person
[1:02:02] that's presenting the evidence
[1:02:05] in other words did they tell one story
[1:02:08] one time and now are they telling
[1:02:10] another story this time what's the basis
[1:02:14] of the credibility
[1:02:17] of
[1:02:18] the evidence
[1:02:19] i mean it comes down if the person's not
[1:02:22] credible
[1:02:23] is their evidence credible
[1:02:25] and and so that's one type of evidence
[1:02:29] and then there's hearsay evidence
[1:02:32] and hearsay is what you've heard
[1:02:35] somebody else say evidence you've
[1:02:37] received from
[1:02:39] somebody else
[1:02:40] and then there's direct evidence
[1:02:44] direct evidence that's the evidence that
[1:02:47] a person has experienced themselves
[1:02:50] and the direct evidence
[1:02:54] and
[1:02:55] so you know
[1:02:58] when it's all said and done
[1:03:01] there's something that's called the
[1:03:02] preponderance
[1:03:04] of evidence
[1:03:07] and that is the quality
[1:03:11] the quantity
[1:03:13] or
[1:03:14] facts greater in number
[1:03:17] quality
[1:03:18] or importance
[1:03:21] so when you weigh it all you look at
[1:03:23] what facts are important
[1:03:26] and what facts
[1:03:28] aren't important
[1:03:30] and can you draw your conclusion based
[1:03:33] on the preponderance of evidence
[1:03:36] and when someone's presenting something
[1:03:38] they both sides have their evidence
[1:03:42] and
[1:03:43] you we know that one side might come and
[1:03:46] say
[1:03:47] uh
[1:03:48] uh
[1:03:49] this is this and
[1:03:51] and this is the evidence and then the
[1:03:53] other side presents their evidence
[1:03:57] and we know the side of uh
[1:04:00] an argument is this facts didn't add up
[1:04:03] and this dates didn't match and we can't
[1:04:07] make this happen and this doesn't reason
[1:04:09] out
[1:04:10] now the other side has their evidence
[1:04:13] too
[1:04:15] the angel of the lord the pillar of fire
[1:04:18] uh
[1:04:19] how that you could go down all the
[1:04:21] testimonies the miracles the signs the
[1:04:25] wonders the prophecies and all those
[1:04:28] things and and the greater value and to
[1:04:31] the believer
[1:04:33] the
[1:04:34] the thing that finally catches them is
[1:04:36] the direct evidence
[1:04:40] what
[1:04:41] they have personally
[1:04:43] experienced
[1:04:45] from
[1:04:46] the
[1:04:47] uh
[1:04:49] of what is on trial
[1:04:52] and so when it's all said and done it's
[1:04:54] going to be a hung jury
[1:04:56] you're going to have believers
[1:04:59] make believers
[1:05:01] and unbelievers
[1:05:03] there will not be a conclusion drawn so
[1:05:06] it'll go one day to the judge
[1:05:11] amen and that's the final showdown
[1:05:14] the final showdowns the catching away
[1:05:17] of the church
[1:05:19] and so there there's no need
[1:05:22] pursuing a a
[1:05:25] a trial that's going to have a hung jury
[1:05:28] yeah
[1:05:30] there's going to be believers
[1:05:32] make believers
[1:05:34] and unbelievers
[1:05:36] but let's move on
[1:05:38] from that
[1:05:41] because i think the important thing
[1:05:44] is that about
[1:05:48] the message about
[1:05:50] trying to put the message
[1:05:53] on trial
[1:05:55] is that
[1:05:56] it becomes a distraction
[1:05:59] to what this real message is
[1:06:03] really what
[1:06:05] was
[1:06:06] the message
[1:06:08] and
[1:06:09] and i would like to refer a little bit
[1:06:11] this morning to a sermon called the way
[1:06:14] of a true prophet
[1:06:17] and what a prophet's
[1:06:19] message really is
[1:06:22] and we find out that if when
[1:06:26] god ever wants to deal with people he's
[1:06:29] always had a way of dealing with people
[1:06:33] god has never left his people without
[1:06:37] the spirit of god to call them and
[1:06:40] direct them
[1:06:42] and to reach out to them
[1:06:44] and to help them
[1:06:46] god is concerned about his sheep and
[1:06:49] he's concerned about his children
[1:06:53] and
[1:06:54] oftentimes uh
[1:06:56] as we um
[1:07:00] look into
[1:07:02] uh
[1:07:03] the word of god
[1:07:05] i think it's important not to be
[1:07:07] distracted away
[1:07:10] from really what it was that was being
[1:07:13] brought to us
[1:07:15] we get so caught up so much and
[1:07:19] does
[1:07:20] you know does this date work this date
[1:07:22] and when was this done and when was that
[1:07:24] done
[1:07:26] and that never was the purpose
[1:07:29] of what that god was trying to bring to
[1:07:33] us
[1:07:34] in others if i could say it like this
[1:07:36] that within all the confines of the
[1:07:39] message
[1:07:40] all the healing campaigns
[1:07:43] all the miraculous things that are such
[1:07:46] proof of evidence that god was with
[1:07:50] this man that if you can't believe me
[1:07:52] for my words look at my works i i've
[1:07:57] heard it testify and like i would say i
[1:08:00] would bring all these things up one of
[1:08:02] the the one person that's claiming this
[1:08:05] this isn't right and this isn't right
[1:08:07] the other side comes up and they're very
[1:08:10] testimonies and and you we can list them
[1:08:14] i mean
[1:08:14] like congressman upshaw's testimony
[1:08:19] if you could read it he talks about how
[1:08:21] he was in the meeting and health in
[1:08:24] washington the works in los angeles and
[1:08:26] the works of the lord were being done
[1:08:29] and now his heart was just on on fire
[1:08:32] and after any any
[1:08:35] how the word of god was being preached
[1:08:37] and how he was moved on and all of a
[1:08:40] sudden you know okay they say brother
[1:08:42] branham became weak as we know and they
[1:08:44] took them off the thing
[1:08:46] and then he sent back and sent a message
[1:08:48] and says tell the congressman
[1:08:51] that he's healed
[1:08:53] and he said i threw down my
[1:08:56] crutches and i ran towards the pastor i
[1:08:59] mean
[1:09:00] the the preponderance of evidence is it
[1:09:04] is you can't even begin to touch a
[1:09:08] testimonies that have come forth a man
[1:09:11] sitting in the tabernacle
[1:09:14] uh i heard
[1:09:15] the very testimony
[1:09:18] out of the mouth of the very
[1:09:21] one of the witnesses that said he sat
[1:09:24] there and he saw communion wine just be
[1:09:27] created in the cups their own testimony
[1:09:34] legs being made whole couldn't get the
[1:09:37] braces off uh
[1:09:39] on and on and on if you could the
[1:09:42] volumes of the books can't contain the
[1:09:45] whole
[1:09:46] of what the lord jesus did
[1:09:51] and
[1:09:52] we could go on for hours and hours and
[1:09:56] and
[1:09:57] the list of people that have testified
[1:10:01] what god has done for him and how the
[1:10:04] great works florence nightingale and act
[1:10:07] and oh just all the things that could
[1:10:11] come up
[1:10:12] but
[1:10:13] in
[1:10:14] getting caught up
[1:10:18] in the argument
[1:10:23] of
[1:10:26] this is right and this is wrong and
[1:10:30] he did this and he did that and no he
[1:10:33] missed this and he missed that
[1:10:35] and
[1:10:36] when you get caught up in that argument
[1:10:39] you begin to understand
[1:10:43] that the how the reasoning begins to
[1:10:45] work and
[1:10:47] and and and how that the two sides fall
[1:10:51] and we covered last week we covered that
[1:10:55] what we felt was the most substantial
[1:10:59] evidence of all
[1:11:00] was the direct evidence the personal
[1:11:04] effect
[1:11:06] of what that the lord jesus christ has
[1:11:09] done for you
[1:11:10] personally and that is the evidence that
[1:11:15] finally is the
[1:11:16] most determining factor
[1:11:20] and
[1:11:21] so but in doing this
[1:11:24] i i thought back and i said you know
[1:11:28] i don't need to defend
[1:11:31] this message
[1:11:33] i want to defend this method
[1:11:38] you know what i mean i want to bring up
[1:11:40] all the evidence
[1:11:43] all the miracles all the mighty things
[1:11:46] a command asks his father he says why
[1:11:50] why did you stay with brother branham
[1:11:52] when jack cole was your friend why did
[1:11:54] you stay with brother branham
[1:11:56] when you were in a.a allen's meetings
[1:11:59] why did you stay with brother branham
[1:12:01] why did you stay with him
[1:12:03] and the the man's answer was because he
[1:12:06] says there was
[1:12:08] nobody in all these meetings everywhere
[1:12:12] that had the presence of the angel of
[1:12:15] the lord
[1:12:17] when that angel of the lord would come
[1:12:20] into the the meetings he said the
[1:12:23] atmosphere would change
[1:12:25] everything would change you knew that
[1:12:27] that presence of the lord came you felt
[1:12:30] that presence of the lord you felt that
[1:12:33] power of the lord and a divine angel
[1:12:36] from heaven came into the room and he
[1:12:39] knew the secrets and intents of the
[1:12:41] heart
[1:12:44] and even people that disagreed with his
[1:12:47] doctrine said he never missed it
[1:12:52] and
[1:12:53] so
[1:12:54] i thought
[1:12:55] yeah that's i want to stand up
[1:12:58] for that evidence
[1:13:00] but i don't want to get caught in the
[1:13:03] battle of evidence
[1:13:06] and miss the message
[1:13:13] to miss what it was
[1:13:18] that he was trying to bring
[1:13:21] to the believer
[1:13:24] i don't want to get caught up in the
[1:13:27] argument
[1:13:28] of
[1:13:29] vindication
[1:13:31] and under vindication vindication versus
[1:13:34] air
[1:13:35] that's what takes place one side
[1:13:38] presents all what they feel is their
[1:13:40] evidence to get you to
[1:13:43] believe
[1:13:46] and the other side presents their
[1:13:48] evidence to get you to believe
[1:13:52] and
[1:13:54] that trial will always end
[1:13:58] in a hung jury
[1:14:01] people that believe the preponderance of
[1:14:04] the evidence
[1:14:05] and people that don't believe
[1:14:08] the evidence
[1:14:10] that'll start but within the framework
[1:14:13] of that
[1:14:15] there was something that was trying to
[1:14:18] be told to the church
[1:14:22] and
[1:14:23] that's
[1:14:26] what really makes
[1:14:29] a prophet
[1:14:30] a prophet
[1:14:32] in other words it's the way of a true
[1:14:35] prophet
[1:14:37] the way of a true prophet is to lay out
[1:14:42] that word
[1:14:44] and the final vindication
[1:14:47] and the final resting place of anybody's
[1:14:52] decision should be the scriptures
[1:14:56] should be the word of god
[1:14:58] amen
[1:15:00] and so i'd like to
[1:15:02] just use as used in this message and
[1:15:06] this is found on paragraph 92
[1:15:10] in the message of a way of a true
[1:15:11] prophet in 62
[1:15:15] and
[1:15:17] we read lady osea
[1:15:19] because
[1:15:22] i think it's evident
[1:15:25] that we can look around us and see that
[1:15:28] the conditions of lady osea are very
[1:15:33] prevalent
[1:15:36] i believe we can also look around and
[1:15:38] see
[1:15:40] that
[1:15:41] the conditions of sodom and gomorrah are
[1:15:44] very
[1:15:45] prevalent
[1:15:47] and the conditions of the day of noah
[1:15:51] are
[1:15:52] very
[1:15:53] prevalent
[1:15:55] it's it's it
[1:15:57] beyond measure
[1:16:01] and we don't want to get distracted away
[1:16:04] from
[1:16:07] the
[1:16:09] circumstances
[1:16:11] and the situation that we find ourselves
[1:16:14] in
[1:16:16] he says but those god anointed eyes of
[1:16:19] that prophet
[1:16:21] didn't narrow because of the glamour
[1:16:25] like some tourists
[1:16:27] and there's he didn't look at the great
[1:16:30] city and
[1:16:31] and
[1:16:32] look down there and see all the
[1:16:34] buildings and see all that and say wow
[1:16:37] this is something
[1:16:39] he wasn't attracted to it like a tourist
[1:16:42] might be attracted to it
[1:16:45] i i love going into old
[1:16:48] uh
[1:16:49] countries and
[1:16:50] and
[1:16:51] walking down the streets that are
[1:16:54] from the 16th century and
[1:16:56] the old alleyways and the narrow bricks
[1:17:00] and the narrower the city streets and
[1:17:02] the more windy they are and the older
[1:17:05] they are the more i'm attracted to it
[1:17:07] it's it but that's the glamour of that
[1:17:10] but that's not what caught the prophet's
[1:17:13] attention
[1:17:14] because you can understand so a
[1:17:16] prophet's made a prophet
[1:17:18] he's made a certain way and and and
[1:17:21] god's able to raise up out of stones
[1:17:26] out of nothing
[1:17:29] a prophet he doesn't have to come from
[1:17:31] an educational background he doesn't
[1:17:34] have to come from an
[1:17:35] organization he doesn't have to come
[1:17:37] from a school he doesn't have to come
[1:17:40] from a system in other words god can
[1:17:43] take nothing
[1:17:44] and move upon it
[1:17:46] raise him up and give him a message
[1:17:52] and of course we know that he has ways
[1:17:56] of attracting people
[1:17:58] to that message those are the ways of
[1:18:01] his choosing and in all those things we
[1:18:04] could get caught up on the way of
[1:18:06] attraction
[1:18:08] of how that god used
[1:18:11] uh the gifts to attract the people
[1:18:16] and to catch the attention of the people
[1:18:19] but the idea of catching their attention
[1:18:22] wasn't to catch them to
[1:18:24] the the attention drawer
[1:18:30] what drew their attention
[1:18:33] which would be the signs and the wonders
[1:18:35] that drew their attention but along with
[1:18:39] that
[1:18:40] the the signs there was a voice that
[1:18:43] came with the sign or there's a message
[1:18:46] that comes with it something that was
[1:18:48] being said
[1:18:52] and
[1:18:52] delivered
[1:18:54] and
[1:18:55] that's what we don't want to get
[1:18:58] distracted from
[1:19:02] it's like
[1:19:04] police cars racing down the road
[1:19:07] because
[1:19:08] the bridge is falling out
[1:19:12] and they're flashing their lights and
[1:19:13] everything and and you get so enamored
[1:19:16] with the flashing lights and you get so
[1:19:19] enamored with it that you forget the
[1:19:21] message was the bridge is out
[1:19:26] so you just keep driving
[1:19:29] you keep going your way
[1:19:33] and then you start arguing about the
[1:19:34] color of the lights and the
[1:19:37] and the
[1:19:39] what signs are on the side of the car
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:42] you lose
[1:19:44] you lose the whole purpose
[1:19:48] behind the ministry
[1:19:52] and there's no doubt
[1:19:54] that
[1:19:55] brethren have probably described
[1:19:59] by
[1:20:01] every
[1:20:03] radio commentator every talk show host
[1:20:07] every even the critics
[1:20:10] they testify there's never been a
[1:20:12] ministry like this
[1:20:16] not since the days of the lord have they
[1:20:18] ever seen or felt
[1:20:21] the divinity
[1:20:23] that
[1:20:25] was present
[1:20:27] they the
[1:20:28] they testify to
[1:20:31] the humility
[1:20:34] and the nature and the character
[1:20:37] now they may disagree doctrinally and
[1:20:40] that's not what i'm saying here
[1:20:43] but
[1:20:46] it's
[1:20:47] you can't forget
[1:20:50] or miss
[1:20:52] what
[1:20:53] was delivered
[1:20:58] that's like being
[1:21:00] describing the mailman and how great the
[1:21:03] mailman was and how he carried his bag
[1:21:05] and and and how his suit was impeccable
[1:21:09] and his shoes were so polished and he
[1:21:12] was always on time wind rain
[1:21:15] snow
[1:21:16] you know the mail was delivered and
[1:21:19] and uh and never opening the letter
[1:21:26] or saying i got this letter look at the
[1:21:28] letter i've got
[1:21:30] look at this letter i received this
[1:21:32] letter personally
[1:21:34] from from
[1:21:36] the
[1:21:37] from
[1:21:38] whomever
[1:21:39] and and i've got this letter and and
[1:21:41] these are all the vindications that
[1:21:44] brought this letter to me and this
[1:21:46] letter came across the ocean and and the
[1:21:49] boat was turned upside down and the bag
[1:21:53] swept to an island and somebody found
[1:21:55] the bag and go all the history of all
[1:21:59] the great
[1:22:00] magnificent miracles that delivered that
[1:22:04] message to you and never
[1:22:07] read it
[1:22:12] or never receive it
[1:22:17] and
[1:22:18] until you read it
[1:22:21] you will never know the authenticity
[1:22:25] of it
[1:22:28] you could tell me it was a letter
[1:22:32] from my wife
[1:22:35] and you could tell me all that god did
[1:22:38] and all the miracles that he wrote
[1:22:41] in order to get this to me
[1:22:45] but i'll never know it's from her
[1:22:49] until i open up and read it
[1:22:53] because i would know
[1:22:56] just by the words
[1:22:58] by the sense of feeling
[1:23:00] from the unity
[1:23:02] and the experiences and everything about
[1:23:06] it i would know if it was from her or
[1:23:08] not
[1:23:10] amen and i'm the only one
[1:23:13] that can verify its authenticity
[1:23:20] right you can say the postage date don't
[1:23:22] match
[1:23:25] uh you know
[1:23:26] they said it came this way but it was
[1:23:28] stamped over here i don't know about
[1:23:30] that
[1:23:31] i i don't know it by
[1:23:35] by its journey
[1:23:37] i know it by its content
[1:23:43] and
[1:23:45] if we don't receive the message
[1:23:49] if we don't read the letter if we don't
[1:23:52] understand its purpose
[1:23:54] then it dies
[1:23:58] in argument
[1:24:01] in other words the jury is hung
[1:24:06] it's come
[1:24:08] the unbelievers are going to disbelieve
[1:24:12] the make-believers are going to play
[1:24:14] both sides of the fence
[1:24:17] and the believers they're sold out
[1:24:22] so i think it's it's important that we
[1:24:25] focus now let's listen to this what he
[1:24:27] said he said but those anointed eyes of
[1:24:30] that prophet didn't narrow because of
[1:24:32] the glamour
[1:24:34] like some tourists
[1:24:36] but on the moral corruption
[1:24:43] to a people
[1:24:45] who was called
[1:24:47] to be blessed
[1:24:50] of god
[1:24:53] now
[1:24:54] so
[1:24:56] we we begin to the the purpose of the
[1:24:59] message begins to unfold of us what the
[1:25:03] way of a true prophet is a way of the
[1:25:05] true prophet
[1:25:07] is when he looks out he sees that the
[1:25:10] moral corruption
[1:25:14] that is on a people who have been called
[1:25:18] to be blessed of god
[1:25:21] in other words you're called to be
[1:25:23] blessed of god
[1:25:25] but you're caught up
[1:25:28] in everything else
[1:25:33] that's being offered
[1:25:37] his eyes didn't look at the glamour
[1:25:41] they didn't narrow because of the
[1:25:43] glamour
[1:25:45] it was because
[1:25:47] the indecency
[1:25:50] and the corruption of the people
[1:25:53] that had been called to be chosen
[1:25:58] of god
[1:26:02] now
[1:26:04] this is the motive
[1:26:06] this is the objective
[1:26:10] that these people were called
[1:26:13] they they were
[1:26:15] called to be the chosen of god
[1:26:19] and would act in such a way
[1:26:22] as that
[1:26:25] they're saying you're called to be the
[1:26:28] children of god
[1:26:29] you're called to something higher you're
[1:26:31] called to something greater
[1:26:34] you're called to a blessing
[1:26:36] and look what you are
[1:26:39] caught up in
[1:26:43] now
[1:26:46] why get over into all this other stuff
[1:26:48] and miss
[1:26:51] that
[1:26:52] important part
[1:26:54] of god's word
[1:27:03] wonder he said the lion roareth
[1:27:07] and who will not fear
[1:27:10] god spoke and who
[1:27:12] can keep from prophesying
[1:27:17] he's seen the corruption
[1:27:19] the decay
[1:27:21] that's what he was looking at
[1:27:25] that's when he seen all of that
[1:27:28] it didn't attract him it sickened him at
[1:27:32] his soul
[1:27:33] why he was a prophet
[1:27:36] he knowed what god
[1:27:38] had promised to bless
[1:27:43] and what a blessing was
[1:27:48] and how
[1:27:49] people acted with
[1:27:52] the blessing
[1:27:56] if
[1:27:57] if i could just hold there
[1:27:59] i think that's probably
[1:28:03] a wonderful
[1:28:05] description
[1:28:08] of what took place
[1:28:11] he's made that way
[1:28:14] he's made that corruption sickens him
[1:28:18] he's made that it hurts him in his soul
[1:28:22] when he sees a people that's blessed
[1:28:26] and blessed of god and called to be
[1:28:29] blessed of god
[1:28:33] and have
[1:28:34] turned
[1:28:37] and been drawn off
[1:28:40] to something
[1:28:43] totally
[1:28:46] perverse
[1:28:49] and the devil has perverted
[1:28:52] the devil has perverted in his day
[1:28:55] from what a real blessing was
[1:28:59] a moral declare
[1:29:01] decay
[1:29:03] a blessing to tickle the eyes and
[1:29:06] appetites of unconverted people
[1:29:10] to the
[1:29:11] will
[1:29:12] and way of god
[1:29:14] and god's
[1:29:15] way
[1:29:16] of life
[1:29:18] this was the
[1:29:20] the
[1:29:21] the substance
[1:29:24] of the purpose
[1:29:27] that god sent the message
[1:29:29] even in lady elsia he says you're blind
[1:29:33] miserable poor wretched and naked you're
[1:29:35] decayed
[1:29:37] the condition of the world you've turned
[1:29:39] into sodomites you you've left the ways
[1:29:42] of god you've left the word of god you
[1:29:45] left everything let's go back and look
[1:29:47] at the condition
[1:29:52] look at where people were
[1:29:54] the country was starting to move away
[1:29:57] from the things of god from the spirit
[1:30:00] of god the blessings of god the baptism
[1:30:03] of the holy ghost holiness begin to
[1:30:06] leave
[1:30:08] women begin to move from dresses to
[1:30:11] pants from long hair
[1:30:13] to bobbing their hair from clean face to
[1:30:17] makeup and glamour and lips and poking
[1:30:21] drugs in their lips and
[1:30:23] everywhere doing all kinds of stuff in
[1:30:26] other words the whole thing
[1:30:30] is adrift
[1:30:35] away from god
[1:30:39] you know that that's easy to
[1:30:42] all of a sudden
[1:30:44] lay aside
[1:30:51] the consciousness
[1:30:53] of our own
[1:30:54] morality
[1:30:57] this is what a prophet sees
[1:31:02] he says
[1:31:04] he had the word of the lord for the
[1:31:06] nation
[1:31:08] this is paragraph 1 1 1.
[1:31:11] he had the word of the lord for the
[1:31:12] nation
[1:31:14] but the true word of the lord was
[1:31:17] foreign to those people
[1:31:21] yet they thought they had
[1:31:24] it
[1:31:26] i hope this gets down deep they thought
[1:31:29] that they were so pious and religious
[1:31:33] that the real word of god was a foreign
[1:31:37] thing to them
[1:31:40] now we're talking about
[1:31:44] what the message was
[1:31:48] the message doesn't change
[1:31:50] and the message is scriptural
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:57] the message the word the scripture said
[1:32:00] is an abomination for a woman to put on
[1:32:02] a garment pertaineth to the man that is
[1:32:05] the scripture
[1:32:07] that is the word of god
[1:32:10] the word of god says there's one god i
[1:32:14] am the lord thy god that's the word of
[1:32:17] god the message comes from the
[1:32:20] scriptures
[1:32:24] that's
[1:32:24] right where it is i'm amazed that
[1:32:28] someone would say oh
[1:32:30] i i saw this mistake or this thing that
[1:32:33] dad didn't add up so i went
[1:32:37] and started studying the scriptures
[1:32:40] wait a minute
[1:32:43] you never heard the message
[1:32:45] the message was read your bible pray
[1:32:49] study the scriptures look and see what
[1:32:51] the word said back to the word back to
[1:32:54] the bible back to the scriptures
[1:33:01] if you'd have stayed in the word of god
[1:33:03] and studied the scripture you may
[1:33:06] but it's because you missed the message
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:15] you didn't read the love letter
[1:33:19] what was written to you
[1:33:27] that's the way it is today
[1:33:30] the true
[1:33:32] word of god made
[1:33:34] manifest is a foreign thing to lots of
[1:33:38] pentecostal people
[1:33:42] the real interpretation of the word
[1:33:46] the real
[1:33:48] woes and curses
[1:33:52] the real blessings of god
[1:33:55] is a foreign thing to many people
[1:33:58] who call themselves holiness
[1:34:01] church members
[1:34:03] christians
[1:34:04] it's a foreign thing to them
[1:34:06] they don't know it
[1:34:09] mention it to them they never heard of
[1:34:12] such a thing
[1:34:13] and yet their organizations grow and
[1:34:16] prosper getting bigger and bigger
[1:34:19] members all the time
[1:34:21] and more
[1:34:23] organizations added
[1:34:26] every year
[1:34:28] what
[1:34:30] what's the message
[1:34:33] the message is you're not
[1:34:35] you're not looking at the word
[1:34:38] the message if you're not
[1:34:40] you don't see the woes
[1:34:42] and the curses
[1:34:45] the wages of sin is death
[1:34:48] they don't see the woes that are coming
[1:34:51] the curse is we're in a woe
[1:34:58] the things that are happening that they
[1:35:01] didn't see the the the
[1:35:04] delinquency
[1:35:05] and the drugs
[1:35:07] and the addictions that were coming
[1:35:11] to a people that left the lord
[1:35:15] who quit praying in schools who quit
[1:35:18] praying at the dinner table who quit
[1:35:21] going to church who substituted football
[1:35:25] and cowboy games for going to church
[1:35:28] they're so addicted to the those losers
[1:35:31] with the star on their head to that they
[1:35:34] will stay out of the house of god and
[1:35:36] they wonder why they're full of woes
[1:35:46] people wonder why
[1:35:49] they don't realize the woes and the
[1:35:51] curses
[1:35:54] that come
[1:35:56] with
[1:35:58] and the fruits of a life
[1:36:01] that separated from the word of god and
[1:36:04] from the scriptures
[1:36:07] away seemeth right unto the man but the
[1:36:09] end that way of death and the weak
[1:36:12] pulpits
[1:36:14] who are lying to the people
[1:36:17] telling me they're fine telling the
[1:36:19] sisters it don't matter you dress this
[1:36:21] way that don't really matter that's not
[1:36:24] really matter god god doesn't really
[1:36:26] love you in other words they forget what
[1:36:29] the message was what it was he was
[1:36:32] telling us what it was that was
[1:36:34] screaming out of his heart what it was
[1:36:37] he was trying to get the people to see
[1:36:44] they
[1:36:46] it became foreign
[1:36:49] the power of the resurrection
[1:36:53] the power of faith
[1:36:56] the power of a dedicated life to christ
[1:37:00] a life of as matthew priests of
[1:37:02] self-denial a life that
[1:37:05] that is set aside for his whole
[1:37:08] purpose of knowing the scriptures
[1:37:11] reading the scriptures serving the
[1:37:14] scriptures going to the word of god for
[1:37:16] directions opening and reading every
[1:37:20] line it can tell the revelation of god's
[1:37:23] word pours into your heart the
[1:37:25] victorious life that that produces
[1:37:29] and the life of death
[1:37:31] that living that way not living that way
[1:37:36] of a surrendered life what the results
[1:37:39] were
[1:37:41] if we're not careful it's not soon
[1:37:44] that
[1:37:46] the message is no longer
[1:37:50] even
[1:37:55] heard
[1:37:58] he said then if i do not the works this
[1:38:00] paragraph 1 16 if i do not the works of
[1:38:03] god
[1:38:04] don't believe me
[1:38:06] but if the works speak
[1:38:08] themselves
[1:38:10] believe the works if you don't want to
[1:38:12] believe me
[1:38:15] look at he was doing this we dropped
[1:38:16] down to paragraph 120
[1:38:20] but god raised up god takes what he
[1:38:22] wants to take
[1:38:24] he takes nothing usually
[1:38:27] to do his
[1:38:28] work show that it's god
[1:38:31] a man is all puffed up and thinks he's
[1:38:34] something then god can't use him
[1:38:37] because there's too much of himself
[1:38:40] that's what's a matter with christians
[1:38:45] christian church today
[1:38:47] they think they know something
[1:38:50] the bible says when a man thinks he
[1:38:52] knows something he knows nothing
[1:38:55] that he ought to know
[1:38:57] that's the trouble of today
[1:38:59] we've got so much self
[1:39:02] so much hypocrisy
[1:39:04] so much education so much religion and
[1:39:08] know nothing about the salvation of the
[1:39:12] word of god that's the pitiful part of
[1:39:16] it
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:21] now we're starting to
[1:39:23] see
[1:39:24] the message
[1:39:27] what what he's telling us what what
[1:39:30] what the what the way of a true prophet
[1:39:35] is
[1:39:37] believe it or not with all the signs and
[1:39:40] wonders
[1:39:41] and all the miracles
[1:39:45] and all the healings
[1:39:48] it wouldn't be
[1:39:50] a true prophet
[1:39:52] until he screamed out
[1:39:55] against the sin
[1:40:00] because that's a way of a true prophet
[1:40:02] is back to the word
[1:40:09] he could have done signs of wonder signs
[1:40:11] and wonders and then never stood
[1:40:15] and preached the baptism
[1:40:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:20] because that's the only biblical
[1:40:24] scriptural baptism there is
[1:40:29] that's right
[1:40:30] see the real evidence
[1:40:33] is in the word
[1:40:37] the real evidence is in the message he
[1:40:40] delivered amen that's right
[1:40:43] that's the real evidence
[1:40:45] because that's the way of a true prophet
[1:40:49] now they want to argue about this and
[1:40:51] they want to argue about that but my
[1:40:53] question is is the message the word of
[1:40:56] god
[1:41:02] that's the real determination
[1:41:08] did this age get in the ladylc and
[1:41:10] condition
[1:41:11] did this age get in this sodom condition
[1:41:15] did this age be as it was in the days of
[1:41:18] noah
[1:41:21] amen
[1:41:22] that's the question
[1:41:27] is the evidence
[1:41:30] of the holy spirit speaking in tongues
[1:41:35] or is the evidence of seed
[1:41:38] that says amen
[1:41:40] to every word of god
[1:41:45] see you can't be
[1:41:47] drifted
[1:41:50] and that's what struck me
[1:41:53] there's a lot there was a lot of
[1:41:54] fanaticism
[1:41:56] that followed
[1:41:58] that's right people say oh you believe
[1:42:01] brother abraham's infallible brother
[1:42:03] brown never
[1:42:04] laid anything on himself
[1:42:11] it wasn't he was infallible
[1:42:13] the message is
[1:42:15] this is infallible
[1:42:18] this word is what's infallible
[1:42:24] i i don't know did the word of god
[1:42:26] promised before the great and dreadful
[1:42:28] day of the lord that i'll send a prophet
[1:42:32] that's scriptural
[1:42:34] did it profit before the ministry of the
[1:42:36] son of man
[1:42:37] there there there's there's many things
[1:42:40] that are are laid down but the basis and
[1:42:43] the root of them is the scriptures
[1:42:49] and that was part of what this message
[1:42:52] was is go back and anchor yourself in a
[1:42:57] personal relationship with the lord
[1:43:00] jesus christ and the word of god
[1:43:06] but it's easy to miss the message
[1:43:11] it's easy to get caught up
[1:43:16] in all the signs
[1:43:19] and wonders
[1:43:23] that prove
[1:43:25] that it's right
[1:43:29] just like you can get caught up in all
[1:43:32] the questionable reasonable things that
[1:43:35] man's mind can't put together
[1:43:39] but don't you realize the carnal mind is
[1:43:42] at enni with god and spiritual things
[1:43:45] are only discerned by the spirit
[1:43:50] that's not what we're based on
[1:43:55] it doesn't do us any good
[1:43:58] if we could prove tell
[1:44:01] with everything that we're convinced
[1:44:04] you'll never convince an unbeliever
[1:44:09] never
[1:44:13] a make believer you'll never know
[1:44:14] whether he's convinced or not
[1:44:19] but a real believer
[1:44:22] reads
[1:44:24] and hears
[1:44:26] the message
[1:44:28] what the message was
[1:44:33] and that's what he do he says
[1:44:43] that
[1:44:45] let me see if if
[1:44:48] paragraph 131 he says but you think
[1:44:53] you could keep him there
[1:44:55] he says you can't cage the word of god
[1:44:59] no no
[1:45:00] it'll come forth anyhow
[1:45:03] prison bars opened one night when they
[1:45:06] tried to cage it the light come in and
[1:45:10] delivered him out
[1:45:13] and and so when you become to come to
[1:45:15] find out you begin to find out that what
[1:45:18] the church did is it left the foundation
[1:45:21] of the word of god it left what it was
[1:45:24] built on
[1:45:28] look that's where to come back he says
[1:45:30] you're building on the wrong foundation
[1:45:34] paul even said watch what every man
[1:45:36] builds on they begin to build on things
[1:45:39] that weren't
[1:45:41] buildable on
[1:45:44] they begin to build on numbers they
[1:45:47] begin to build on
[1:45:49] systems they begin to build
[1:45:51] organizations they begin to
[1:45:54] they begin to attract people by their
[1:45:57] programs and by their gems and and and
[1:46:01] by their social experience this is the
[1:46:04] message
[1:46:07] this is what's being said you're leaving
[1:46:09] god
[1:46:12] you're leaving the real baptism being
[1:46:16] born again
[1:46:17] nature change of the gospel and the
[1:46:20] product of the scriptures
[1:46:27] why get caught up in the argument
[1:46:33] when the best thing for me to do is read
[1:46:35] the message
[1:46:37] hear the message
[1:46:39] and i'm not talking about
[1:46:41] the books
[1:46:46] because if the letter killeth it killeth
[1:46:49] i'm talking about the life
[1:46:53] that was being described
[1:46:57] and
[1:46:58] the the life
[1:47:01] that
[1:47:04] was
[1:47:06] being presented to the people
[1:47:09] that they were missing
[1:47:13] what what
[1:47:15] they were lacking
[1:47:17] in the power
[1:47:20] of the presence of god of the fellowship
[1:47:24] and the union
[1:47:27] and that's all he put on display
[1:47:30] he put on display the power of the
[1:47:33] resurrection the love of god god's power
[1:47:36] to deliver god's power to heal god's
[1:47:39] power to save a presentation
[1:47:43] of the life of christ in this generation
[1:47:47] so a people could look and receive that
[1:47:50] life
[1:47:55] it never was
[1:47:58] about the postman
[1:48:02] amen it was always about what was the
[1:48:05] lord telling us through that ministry
[1:48:08] and what he was telling to me through
[1:48:11] that ministry was in this book
[1:48:15] now don't argue with me about the
[1:48:18] mailman
[1:48:21] is
[1:48:22] the message he delivered the scriptures
[1:48:25] or not
[1:48:35] is it true
[1:48:36] that we live in ladies
[1:48:39] is it true the moral corruption
[1:48:42] of
[1:48:43] the our society
[1:48:46] has decayed almost to
[1:48:48] an unreckonable state
[1:48:53] because he's talking about a way of a
[1:48:55] true prophet he's paragraph 1v2 he
[1:48:58] condemned
[1:48:59] immoral act of the churches
[1:49:06] these bunkel parties
[1:49:08] and all these things that they're having
[1:49:12] card parties soup suppers he'd condemn
[1:49:15] every one of them he blast them to hell
[1:49:19] where they come from
[1:49:22] now i'm talking about something that's
[1:49:23] looking back
[1:49:26] he's seen the blessings
[1:49:29] of people that's supposed to be blessed
[1:49:32] of people that's supposed to be living
[1:49:34] above the world
[1:49:36] okay looking at people how are people
[1:49:39] act in those blessings and instead of
[1:49:42] taking those blessings
[1:49:45] taking the scriptures
[1:49:48] they're now participating
[1:49:51] in an ungodly society
[1:49:55] and losing the very joy of their
[1:49:58] salvation the very peace of god
[1:50:02] all kinds of things are starting to
[1:50:04] flood into their ranks
[1:50:09] they're allowing women preachers
[1:50:13] they've got all kinds of hokey
[1:50:15] oils and and gimmicks
[1:50:22] they care more about how they dance and
[1:50:25] shout
[1:50:27] then they do the word of god
[1:50:29] let's don't forget the message
[1:50:34] i think that's a distraction
[1:50:39] that the enemy
[1:50:40] wants to get us caught in
[1:50:44] come to the trial
[1:50:48] let's argue the
[1:50:50] evidence and forget the message
[1:51:00] get
[1:51:01] forget what's being said
[1:51:09] what a trick
[1:51:13] and i think it's so important
[1:51:19] so amos looks out over adam he sees what
[1:51:22] how they're starting to live
[1:51:25] they see they don't pray no more
[1:51:28] they don't fast no more
[1:51:30] they don't purge themselves anymore
[1:51:33] i think people really starting to
[1:51:35] believe in purgatory
[1:51:39] yeah someplace later
[1:51:42] that god will purge them no you purge
[1:51:44] yourself now
[1:51:48] you dedicate your lives now
[1:51:52] you you put this book
[1:51:54] to your bosom
[1:51:56] okay and you read when paul says it's a
[1:51:58] shame for a woman to cut her hair
[1:52:01] or wear a garment or could be be not
[1:52:04] braiding hair and me and painted faces
[1:52:08] and and and
[1:52:09] adorned with jewelry and all these
[1:52:12] things they read it
[1:52:14] they read the scripture
[1:52:19] and they take all of the word of god
[1:52:23] i can i didn't even count the number of
[1:52:26] the times the the word of god said back
[1:52:29] to the scriptures back to the bible this
[1:52:33] is what it says
[1:52:36] and you're watching people with taking
[1:52:40] every other kind of stuff i know people
[1:52:42] went overboard
[1:52:45] with our messenger
[1:52:50] i think they're still closer to the
[1:52:52] truth than some people that just take it
[1:52:54] so lukewarm
[1:52:58] and okay and yes there was such a
[1:53:00] presence of of god in that man's life
[1:53:04] testified by people who don't even
[1:53:06] accept his doctrine
[1:53:09] and i can see somebody saying that was
[1:53:12] god
[1:53:14] it was god without the man himself being
[1:53:17] god
[1:53:18] he was a vessel in which god veiled
[1:53:21] himself in and it's a very fine line
[1:53:24] but you can't let perversion
[1:53:29] mar your judgment
[1:53:40] so if
[1:53:41] it because
[1:53:43] the vindication
[1:53:45] is in
[1:53:47] the word
[1:53:48] itself
[1:53:51] that's where the vindication lies
[1:53:54] people can argue the facts
[1:53:57] but the truth of the word of god
[1:54:01] that was in the message the
[1:54:03] message was this word
[1:54:06] brought back to us
[1:54:14] so job looks at the condition
[1:54:17] and he says the very god you serve is
[1:54:21] going to destroy you
[1:54:26] now here's ladies
[1:54:29] they're blind miserable they increase
[1:54:31] with goods he's looking at the church
[1:54:34] he's looking at the condition he's
[1:54:36] seeing the women he's seeing the deacon
[1:54:38] starting to smoke outside he's seen the
[1:54:40] pastors living the way they live he sees
[1:54:43] the choir
[1:54:44] all caught up in all kinds of things he
[1:54:47] sees different married people here
[1:54:49] different married people there he sees
[1:54:51] the the the uh uh
[1:54:55] women starting to take control of the
[1:54:57] church and be in the pulpit
[1:55:00] the bible says i suffer a woman not to
[1:55:03] preach nor to serve authority over men
[1:55:05] that's the word
[1:55:09] period
[1:55:11] that was the message
[1:55:14] no just because the fact that they don't
[1:55:16] want it doesn't mean it's not a message
[1:55:20] from god the message was the scriptures
[1:55:24] brought to the people
[1:55:28] so amos says the very god you
[1:55:30] you service going to destroy you and if
[1:55:32] i pick up here in paragraph
[1:55:36] 246
[1:55:39] he says and brother brahm you mean god
[1:55:42] is going to destroy this
[1:55:44] yes every one of them
[1:55:48] how
[1:55:48] you know
[1:55:50] amos how did you know
[1:55:53] it's just like a doctor
[1:55:56] diagnosing a case
[1:55:59] when he finds the disease
[1:56:02] that's on the patient
[1:56:04] he knows what to do
[1:56:07] he knows
[1:56:08] what the patient has got
[1:56:11] and he knows how it
[1:56:14] how far it's advanced
[1:56:17] and he knows what's going to happen
[1:56:21] that's the way with a prophet
[1:56:23] a true prophet when he sees
[1:56:26] i don't care what you're doing
[1:56:28] when he sees sin advancing it's an
[1:56:32] eating cancer
[1:56:34] and it's in such an advance
[1:56:37] in the pentecostals and the rest of them
[1:56:40] it can't come back
[1:56:42] that's all an advanced stage it's going
[1:56:47] to
[1:56:48] perish
[1:56:52] how do you know what's going to happen
[1:56:55] i've seen people leave the message
[1:57:01] first thing
[1:57:05] they'll take off their skirts
[1:57:09] usually the first thing is their little
[1:57:11] pumps start coming up
[1:57:13] a little higher
[1:57:15] i don't know how high's high
[1:57:18] a real man of god he's just not going to
[1:57:20] want his wife put in such a position
[1:57:26] but
[1:57:28] that's where it sneaks in first you know
[1:57:30] way down at the foundation
[1:57:36] you know
[1:57:36] they they get that slipped in
[1:57:40] you know
[1:57:41] and then i don't know
[1:57:43] maybe a little polish and
[1:57:46] comes in a little bit you know
[1:57:49] and then a few more necklaces and then
[1:57:52] maybe a few more wristbands and
[1:57:54] you know see but the decay
[1:57:58] has started
[1:58:00] how do you know
[1:58:03] how do you know that's the way they're
[1:58:04] going to go how do you know that's the
[1:58:06] way of the world
[1:58:08] because that's the way of the spirit of
[1:58:10] the world
[1:58:12] that's the way of people that don't have
[1:58:14] the word of god to anchor when you cut
[1:58:17] the anchor to the word of god
[1:58:20] and start selecting the scriptures that
[1:58:23] you want to pilot your life
[1:58:26] the true message is the word and all the
[1:58:30] word
[1:58:31] because then you just start to drift
[1:58:34] slowly
[1:58:36] you no longer have your anchor to the
[1:58:38] word of god
[1:58:40] what happens you don't have an absolute
[1:58:47] you can't you can't
[1:58:50] pretty soon
[1:58:51] you've disagreed with the mailman so
[1:58:54] much
[1:58:56] that you won't read the letter you got
[1:58:58] from god
[1:59:02] then you start writing your own letter
[1:59:04] to yourself
[1:59:10] now if i wasn't doing something i'd get
[1:59:12] a letter from leslie she said first
[1:59:14] thing you say are you taking care of
[1:59:15] yourself
[1:59:18] are you eating
[1:59:21] and i know that now you wouldn't know
[1:59:22] that
[1:59:23] but i'll go forever without eating
[1:59:27] nine times when i get eat because have
[1:59:30] you eaten
[1:59:31] you don't want to work for me because i
[1:59:33] don't believe in stopping for lunch
[1:59:38] she'll call me up and say do you feed
[1:59:40] them
[1:59:41] have you fed them guys yet have you gone
[1:59:44] to lunch
[1:59:46] have you
[1:59:47] have you you done that because and
[1:59:50] that's what pretty soon you start doing
[1:59:52] you don't hear the gospel
[1:59:55] that cries out against bob haired women
[1:59:58] shorts
[2:00:00] high heels
[2:00:02] makeup
[2:00:03] rock and roll music this christian rock
[2:00:06] and roll music that
[2:00:07] crept into the church
[2:00:09] that you throw a couple of christian
[2:00:11] words on a satanic beat and it's
[2:00:14] accepted
[2:00:17] they don't they don't believe the
[2:00:19] message
[2:00:20] so now they've cut themselves off so
[2:00:22] they're not even going to receive
[2:00:24] anything that the mailman brings because
[2:00:27] they don't believe that he's really the
[2:00:29] mailman on their route
[2:00:33] he's not really the guy that's got the
[2:00:35] job of delivering the letter so they
[2:00:37] start throwing the letter go they got
[2:00:39] the disease
[2:00:42] and the disease has the rejection of
[2:00:45] god's word and when you reject god's
[2:00:48] word you will perish with the spirit of
[2:00:52] the world
[2:00:57] just like i said you can't help yourself
[2:01:00] from being a believer they can't help
[2:01:02] themselves from the spirit of the world
[2:01:07] if he who is in you
[2:01:09] is not greater than he who is in the
[2:01:12] world if you reject the word
[2:01:17] you don't have him in you to overcome
[2:01:19] the world
[2:01:20] and you will grow worldly
[2:01:26] it'll creep in
[2:01:31] might take a year
[2:01:33] might take two years
[2:01:36] people that'll lift this message now sit
[2:01:38] in denominational churches
[2:01:42] where they preach trinity
[2:01:45] doctrine
[2:01:48] for the church members have earrings on
[2:01:51] and lipstick on and
[2:01:54] and
[2:01:56] i gotta try to make sure that i
[2:02:00] i could say a lot of other things stuff
[2:02:02] they wear to church did they wear shorts
[2:02:04] to church
[2:02:10] and that's where they're at
[2:02:15] blind
[2:02:17] poor
[2:02:18] wretched and naked
[2:02:22] amos knew what it was
[2:02:27] paragraph 284 that's how
[2:02:30] amos got diagnosed the case he diagnosed
[2:02:33] it by the word of god
[2:02:35] that's how a true
[2:02:37] prophet diagnoses the case
[2:02:40] and says to them women don't you never
[2:02:43] try to go to the judgment with bob care
[2:02:47] when you know better
[2:02:49] say to the men the rest of you and you
[2:02:52] preachers denying the word in having a
[2:02:54] form of godliness and joining an
[2:02:57] organization to dodge the issue when you
[2:03:01] know better
[2:03:02] you look at the same word
[2:03:04] the true prophet would look at
[2:03:08] you look at the same
[2:03:10] word a true prophet
[2:03:13] would look at
[2:03:17] it's all a prophet does he looks to the
[2:03:19] word
[2:03:21] he sees what the word says
[2:03:23] he looks out he sees the disease
[2:03:28] he takes the word and applies it to the
[2:03:31] disease
[2:03:33] because he knows if they don't take the
[2:03:36] medicine
[2:03:37] the disease will destroy them
[2:03:42] you look at the same word the true
[2:03:44] prophet would look at the diagnosis of
[2:03:47] the case death separation
[2:03:50] just like a doctor who knows the case he
[2:03:53] knows what kinds of symptoms it's got
[2:03:58] and i think i'll just
[2:04:02] lay rest here
[2:04:10] listen for the message
[2:04:14] don't
[2:04:15] get caught up
[2:04:17] in an argument
[2:04:19] and forget to read the letter
[2:04:25] examine yourselves by the word of god
[2:04:31] look at the choice
[2:04:36] and
[2:04:39] the scribes and the pharisees thought
[2:04:41] jesus was beelzebub
[2:04:49] you know
[2:04:51] but there's a people
[2:04:53] that the letter was written to
[2:04:57] and
[2:04:58] you say brother david do you know who
[2:05:00] those people are known
[2:05:03] i don't
[2:05:05] and i'm going to treat every person that
[2:05:07] i meet
[2:05:11] anywhere
[2:05:13] in any condition
[2:05:15] according to the way the word of god
[2:05:18] says that i could confront them
[2:05:27] lay for yourself
[2:05:28] a pattern of good works
[2:05:31] that's the scripture
[2:05:34] when you're criticized turn the other
[2:05:36] cheek
[2:05:38] that's the scriptures
[2:05:40] live
[2:05:41] the scriptures
[2:05:43] and you'll be living the message
[2:05:46] because the message was back to the
[2:05:49] scriptures
[2:05:50] back to the scriptures and all that
[2:05:53] we've seen
[2:05:55] the cursing and the
[2:05:57] failing
[2:05:59] and
[2:06:00] the destruction
[2:06:02] it's all been told us
[2:06:06] it was diagnosed to us
[2:06:10] what happens
[2:06:11] when you don't take the word
[2:06:15] so i say that the jury
[2:06:19] when all the evidence is
[2:06:22] presented
[2:06:24] when each side has given
[2:06:27] all the miracles and all the vindication
[2:06:30] and all the testimonies and
[2:06:33] all those things
[2:06:35] the other side points out well
[2:06:37] we didn't get the math to add up here
[2:06:39] and and
[2:06:41] you know however god chooses to hide it
[2:06:44] from the wise and prudent
[2:06:48] remember he hides it from the wise and
[2:06:50] prudent
[2:06:51] i don't know what method he uses
[2:06:55] but when it's all said and done
[2:07:00] you're never going to come up
[2:07:03] with anything else
[2:07:05] than a hung jury
[2:07:08] so my advice to you
[2:07:11] forget the trial
[2:07:16] forget it
[2:07:19] it's got a hung jury
[2:07:23] when it's all said and done they're
[2:07:25] going to be right back
[2:07:27] where they started
[2:07:29] the unbeliever
[2:07:31] the make believer
[2:07:33] and the believer
[2:07:35] because that's the jury pool
[2:07:41] you understand that
[2:07:45] that's where they select the jury from
[2:07:47] the jury pool
[2:07:49] the very
[2:07:50] trial
[2:07:52] came from the jury pool
[2:07:58] exactly
[2:07:59] i went to a jury pool
[2:08:07] and i came up with this
[2:08:09] this trial yes
[2:08:11] well you know you forget in the trial
[2:08:13] you're going to hear the other side
[2:08:17] you know i already read the trial
[2:08:23] and i already saw who the witnesses were
[2:08:27] skeptic
[2:08:28] to make believer
[2:08:30] doubter mr impatient i've already seen
[2:08:34] the trial
[2:08:38] but i know who the attorney is
[2:08:42] it's none other than the lord jesus
[2:08:44] christ
[2:08:46] and i know who the judge is
[2:08:48] it's none other than my attorney
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:08:55] so the verdict's in
[2:08:57] for me
[2:08:59] that trial is a hung trial
[2:09:03] my trial was at calvary
[2:09:07] when all my sins
[2:09:09] were presented
[2:09:11] and there was a price paid for him
[2:09:14] when my fine was paid and my debt was
[2:09:17] paid
[2:09:19] and he imparted to me
[2:09:22] his spirit
[2:09:25] that would cause me to forgive
[2:09:28] that would cause me to go the extra mile
[2:09:30] that would cause me to lay a pattern of
[2:09:33] good's work it's back to the foundation
[2:09:37] and the evidence
[2:09:39] of christianity
[2:09:41] is the baptism of the holy spirit giving
[2:09:45] you the power to live the scriptures
[2:09:50] my advice
[2:09:54] read the message
[2:09:58] not just the books
[2:10:01] not just the stories
[2:10:03] not just the miracles
[2:10:06] no not just listening to all the
[2:10:09] testimonies and everything but there is
[2:10:12] a personal
[2:10:14] message to you
[2:10:16] in god's word
[2:10:19] amen and he sent somebody to point you
[2:10:23] to this
[2:10:31] this will get you there
[2:10:35] the message if you read it
[2:10:39] and you see what the messenger said
[2:10:42] you will find
[2:10:43] over and over and over and over and over
[2:10:45] and over and over again
[2:10:47] back to the word
[2:10:49] this is what it said
[2:10:51] these are the truths
[2:10:53] that we are in foundly built upon is the
[2:10:57] scriptural
[2:10:58] revelation of jesus christ the same
[2:11:02] yesterday today and forever
[2:11:06] my advice
[2:11:07] i looked at the trial
[2:11:10] i saw the evidence
[2:11:13] i saw the jury pool
[2:11:16] i thought
[2:11:18] we're right back where we were in the
[2:11:20] garden
[2:11:22] believers
[2:11:25] make believers
[2:11:27] and unbelievers
[2:11:28] and when you have that time of a jury
[2:11:30] pull you get a hung jury
[2:11:32] so
[2:11:33] don't let the jury
[2:11:37] determine
[2:11:39] your fate
[2:11:43] let the pardon
[2:11:46] determine
[2:11:47] your fate
[2:11:50] the jury said you're guilty
[2:11:54] the king of kings
[2:11:56] sent a message
[2:11:58] and said you're pardoned amen
[2:12:01] it doesn't matter
[2:12:04] the evidence now because i received
[2:12:08] the pardon
[2:12:09] have you received the letter
[2:12:12] have you received the message from the
[2:12:13] throne
[2:12:15] have you received the invitation
[2:12:18] to open the door and have him come in
[2:12:22] and sup with you
[2:12:24] and you with him
[2:12:25] let's don't miss the message
[2:12:28] because of the argument
[2:12:30] just just what i wanted to share
[2:12:32] with you this morning so god richly
[2:12:34] bless you the musicians will come
[2:12:37] we have communion tonight and foot
[2:12:39] washing maybe
[2:12:40] some of you that are a home and afraid
[2:12:45] there's plenty of room to be six feet
[2:12:47] apart from somebody here today
[2:12:52] i i guess we don't have to worry i guess
[2:12:54] heaven's not going to be too crowded
[2:13:00] but i don't want to be six feet from
[2:13:02] everybody over there i'm gonna wrap my
[2:13:04] arms around and get real close to them
[2:13:06] so
[2:13:07] the lord protects you we haven't seemed
[2:13:09] to have anybody else that have much
[2:13:12] sickness at this time we have other we
[2:13:16] have other uh
[2:13:18] people that have other medical
[2:13:20] situations but we're praying for them
[2:13:22] and and god is mighty to
[2:13:26] uh deliver them those those that we're
[2:13:28] still praying for but that's what the
[2:13:31] word of god is remember
[2:13:33] the purpose of this message was to
[2:13:35] return us back
[2:13:37] to the faith
[2:13:38] of our fathers
[2:13:40] living by faith
