[6:23] I say
[6:31] [Music]
[6:56] gracious and kind Heavenly Father we
[6:58] thank you Lord once again for allowing
[7:00] us to come together Lord
[7:02] be able to recognize the memorial of
[7:05] this occasion the resurrection
[7:07] of our blessed savior this morning Lord
[7:09] we want to yield ourselves to the Holy
[7:11] Spirit enter into fellowship with you
[7:14] Lord
[7:15] lay aside the things of the world Lord
[7:19] have communion this friend with friend
[7:21] Lord
[7:22] we ask you quick in your word to our
[7:24] hearts Lord
[7:25] it's by that word that we have life
[7:30] Lord It's recorded in your word
[7:32] [Music]
[7:34] speaking of Christ though he were a son
[7:38] yet he learned obedience to the things
[7:40] which he suffered
[7:43] being made perfect
[7:46] he became the author of Eternal
[7:48] salvation unto those that obey him
[7:52] so lord it's out of that obedience
[7:54] that we congregate here this morning
[7:56] searching for the keys
[8:00] to that eternal life
[8:02] and this only through you Lord
[8:04] it's recognition of that and yielding
[8:06] and obedience to your word Lord and
[8:09] we're able to overcome so this morning
[8:11] Lord may you just Infuse it to us this
[8:14] morning Lord may we
[8:16] be able to lift up the higher Heights
[8:18] deeper depths Lord than we've ever been
[8:20] before
[8:23] Lord we just give you the honor and the
[8:25] glory and the praise that you so richly
[8:26] deserve Lord
[8:28] Lord there's no way that we could come
[8:30] into this awesome presence
[8:33] and not feel the effects of it Lord
[8:35] but we want to claim the benefits of it
[8:38] so if they're sick or needy
[8:41] Lord may we go out of here a different
[8:43] person Lord with our needs resolved with
[8:46] our bodies healed Lord there's nothing
[8:49] too small or too great for you
[8:51] so we want you to
[8:53] come Lord
[8:56] as you come where you feel welcome we we
[8:58] just lay aside these things Lord
[9:02] and would be said
[9:04] give you the preeminence we ask this
[9:06] loving and kindly Lord in the name it's
[9:10] above every name the name of the Lord
[9:11] Jesus Christ amen
[9:35] good morning I'm gonna go ahead and
[9:38] turn to Psalm 119 again this morning we
[9:41] can just stay seated for a minute we'll
[9:43] stand
[9:44] give you guys a second to take a load
[9:46] off
[9:49] you know as I was
[9:51] reading Psalm 119 this morning we're
[9:53] going to go ahead and start in verse 145
[9:55] here in a minute
[9:57] you know there was a statement that sort
[9:59] of caught my attention and it says this
[10:02] it says I cried with my whole heart
[10:06] Hear Me O Lord
[10:08] I will keep thy statutes
[10:11] and I thought about that statement I
[10:13] cried with my whole heart
[10:16] and you know two things sort of caught
[10:18] my attention there
[10:21] notice that
[10:22] you know there was a crying out not with
[10:26] lips
[10:28] not with mouth
[10:31] not with his voice
[10:33] but with his heart
[10:37] a cry of the heart
[10:39] not of the mouth
[10:42] the second thing that caught my
[10:43] attention is
[10:45] it was a cry not just of the heart
[10:48] of the whole heart
[10:51] you know the scriptures speak a lot
[10:53] about crying out to the Lord
[10:57] you know we tend to think of that in
[10:58] terms of crying out with our mouth
[11:01] or with our voice
[11:04] that the louder
[11:06] and the longer we cry out
[11:09] that you know somehow the Lord will hear
[11:11] us
[11:12] as if he has a hearing problem
[11:17] you know and that he won't give us our
[11:19] desire until we've met a certain length
[11:21] of time or a certain volume
[11:26] but you know
[11:28] our mouth can cry for one thing
[11:31] and our heart can cry for something else
[11:36] you know it says in Matthew 15 8 Jesus
[11:40] said this he said this people
[11:43] draweth nigh unto me with her mouth
[11:46] and honoreth me with their lips
[11:49] but their heart
[11:51] is far from me
[11:54] You Know It also says in first Samuel it
[11:57] says for the Lord seeth not as man seeth
[12:00] the Lord looketh on the heart
[12:04] you know God isn't looking for a loud
[12:06] voice
[12:08] or lots of words when we cry out to him
[12:12] you know our thoughts speak louder in
[12:14] heaven than our words is what we've been
[12:16] taught
[12:18] God is looking for a cry with our whole
[12:21] heart
[12:22] there's a certain
[12:24] sound a certain cry that you make
[12:28] when it's your whole heart
[12:30] and only then
[12:32] does he hear
[12:34] heart
[12:36] you know Psalm 119 refers many times to
[12:40] doing things with the whole heart
[12:43] you know it says in verse 2 and 10 it
[12:45] speaks of seeking him
[12:47] with our whole heart
[12:51] with my whole heart have I sought thee
[12:55] Jeremiah 29 13 says this and ye shall
[12:59] seek me and find me when
[13:02] ye shall search for me with all your
[13:05] heart
[13:08] only when we seek him with the whole
[13:10] heart
[13:11] do we find him
[13:14] It also says in verse 34 and verse 69
[13:17] you know he refers to observing and
[13:19] keeping the word with the whole heart
[13:24] you know Mark 11 23 says for verily I
[13:27] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[13:29] unto this mountain be thou removed
[13:32] and be thou casted to the Sea and shall
[13:34] not doubt in his heart
[13:38] but shall believe that those things
[13:40] which he saith shall come to pass he
[13:42] shall have whatsoever he asks
[13:45] wholehearted
[13:47] completely sold out
[13:51] no room for any doubt
[13:53] only believe
[13:56] in verse 58 he speaks of entreating his
[13:59] favor
[14:00] with my whole heart and then finally
[14:02] here at 145 I cried with my whole heart
[14:07] you know Psalm 9 Psalm 139 I'll begin
[14:10] with the verse the statement I will
[14:12] praise thee
[14:14] with the whole heart
[14:17] you know God doesn't do anything
[14:19] half-heartedly
[14:21] and he

[38:28] different places with different
[38:31] circumstances
[38:34] different expectations
[38:37] different needs and desires
[38:42] and father having need of things that we
[38:45] don't even realize
[38:49] that's why this morning we place
[38:52] ourselves in this service into your
[38:54] hands
[38:56] because you know all things
[38:59] you know what we have need of even
[39:01] before that we ask
[39:05] and you told us to cast our cares upon
[39:08] you because you careth for us
[39:11] Lord so we've come to this morning to
[39:13] hear of you to
[39:16] be reminded of the word of God in our
[39:19] lives and
[39:21] of all the great promises that you've
[39:23] given us
[39:24] we ask that you bless each heart and
[39:27] bless each one this morning
[39:29] in Jesus precious and
[39:32] wonderful name we pray
[39:34] amen
[39:36] amen God bless you if you have your
[39:38] Bibles let's turn over to Matthew the
[39:41] 16th chapter and the first few verses
[39:45] there it's nice to have
[39:48] our new brides with us sister Jenna
[39:52] Shelley's here and sister Rachel I I
[39:54] don't know how to say your last name but
[39:56] we're happy that's just a Rachel
[39:59] formerly to Mom was with us
[40:01] Jenna's with us so I think that's
[40:03] wonderful this morning makes it a real
[40:05] good day for the bride
[40:07] amen praise the Lord
[40:10] amen we're going to read this scripture
[40:13] then we'll have our seats and we'll read
[40:17] several more scriptures and then we're
[40:19] going to play a few moments of a tape
[40:21] this morning
[40:23] I I always enjoy doing that because
[40:27] we know Heaven and Earth will pass away
[40:30] but God's word will not pass away
[40:33] amen so Mark the 16th chapter
[40:38] and uh
[40:40] starting
[40:42] um
[40:42] with the
[40:45] first
[40:46] a verse there of mark and um
[40:54] so we want to follow this theme through
[40:56] and
[40:59] and I want to
[41:00] ask each of us this morning to place
[41:03] ourselves
[41:06] Place ourselves in the scripture
[41:09] and so don't stand away from the
[41:11] scripture and look at it far but you've
[41:16] got to see the Lord Jesus in every
[41:18] scripture and you've got to see yourself
[41:20] in every scripture so you've got to
[41:23] believe that God had the ability to
[41:28] write this book
[41:30] to place the sentences
[41:33] to speak to the prophets in sun-dried
[41:37] times and in diverse manners to be able
[41:40] to write something that would last for
[41:43] all the ages
[41:46] you know so the gospel hasn't changed
[41:50] men's have been reading this book for
[41:53] two thousand years and it's still they
[41:56] still are inspired by it because the
[42:00] author of its Eternal so this word's
[42:03] Eternal so it applies to us today as
[42:07] fresh Manna so when we hear this it's
[42:10] almost like Jesus was looking at them
[42:13] the those people that were standing
[42:16] there but really he was speaking to you
[42:19] he was speaking to everybody that was a
[42:23] part of him so if I could say it like
[42:27] this and just add a little bit to it it
[42:30] was almost like he was speaking to
[42:31] himself
[42:33] because you're part of him amen do you
[42:36] believe that Hallelujah so let's read
[42:39] the Pharisees also
[42:41] with the Sadducees
[42:44] see that these two people didn't even
[42:46] like each other
[42:47] but they hated Jesus so much they United
[42:52] amen the Pharisees also with the
[42:54] Sadducees came and tempting
[42:58] and Desiring him tempting
[43:02] desired him that he would show them a
[43:06] sign from heaven
[43:09] and he answered and said unto them
[43:11] when it is evening ye say it will be
[43:16] fair weather for the sky is red
[43:21] and in the morning it will be foul
[43:24] weather today for this guy is red and
[43:28] lowering oh ye hypocrites
[43:31] can ye discern the face of the Skies
[43:36] but can you not discern the signs
[43:41] of the times
[43:44] amen but can ye not discern the signs of
[43:51] the times amen this word father bless
[43:54] your word just this morning in Jesus
[43:57] precious name we pray amen amen God
[44:01] bless you may be seated
[44:09] I'd like to turn to a couple more
[44:13] scriptures that are very uh familiar to
[44:18] us and you notice that Jesus is talking
[44:23] about being able to discern
[44:28] the signs of the time and this morning
[44:33] we just want to talk about if we could
[44:36] be important
[44:37] of and the necessity for us to be able
[44:43] to look around and see what's
[44:47] transpiring
[44:48] and and so we just want to go through
[44:51] this a few scriptures this morning that
[44:53] are very very familiar
[44:57] to us and and so if we would uh just
[45:02] turn a few chapters over to the gospel
[45:07] of Saint Luke
[45:08] and and we know these scriptures very
[45:11] well
[45:12] that Luke 17
[45:14] uh Luke 17 and 22.
[45:20] now Jesus once again is going to be
[45:23] speaking about uh giving us a warning
[45:28] and
[45:30] telling us about
[45:32] the signs or what what to look for
[45:36] that's that's what a sign does it says
[45:39] Exit 5 21 a mile and a quarter right so
[45:45] if you're looking for that look for this
[45:47] a mile down the road just a little
[45:50] farther down the road look for this or
[45:53] or they'll let you know it's a sign it's
[45:56] something that tells you what's fixing
[45:59] to happen or something that you should
[46:02] be aware of we're familiar with warning
[46:04] sides on the road
[46:06] stop signs all different forms of
[46:10] of signs and signs are a way of
[46:13] communicating
[46:15] you want to communicate something to
[46:19] somebody you've got you there's there's
[46:22] signs to do that and signs have symbols
[46:25] and these symbols uh uh show forth that
[46:30] there's uh uh something that you need to
[46:34] be aware of uh the the snake on the
[46:38] squiggly snake looking thing that you
[46:40] know that there's some curvy roads when
[46:43] that thing comes in it comes like up and
[46:47] goes like that you know that this Lane's
[46:49] going to disappear and so you you take
[46:54] heed
[46:55] to those signs because they're telling
[46:59] you that you need to make adjustments
[47:03] okay you've got you've got to be making
[47:06] adjustments you've got to be uh you can
[47:09] no longer continue the way that you're
[47:14] continuing because something is fixing
[47:18] to change out in front of you
[47:22] and and so the the
[47:25] uh gospel has always been uh
[47:31] uh a gospel through all the time God had
[47:36] always given his church signs he's
[47:39] always done that the prophets themselves
[47:42] were assigned to the people uh judgments
[47:47] were assigned to the people so God
[47:50] through time has had very many different
[47:54] ways of trying to get the people to
[47:58] realize that we have to change our
[48:02] course
[48:04] and and so even Jesus spoke and we're
[48:09] all very familiar with the last few
[48:12] chapters of Matthew where he talks about
[48:15] wars and rumors of wars and all these
[48:18] things that should take come the Senate
[48:20] Perdition should rise up uh you know and
[48:24] then he would say the ends not yet these
[48:26] things have to happen now we're living
[48:29] in the day of the Fulfillment of the
[48:34] signs
[48:36] in fact the bride has received the last
[48:41] sign that she's going to get
[48:44] it so we we so it would behoove us if I
[48:49] could say it this way
[48:51] to understand if God gave us the great
[48:55] sign of the pillar of Fire
[48:58] he gave us the great sign and we'll read
[49:01] this scripture of the ministry of the
[49:05] son of man
[49:06] it there he was trying to relay
[49:10] something to us
[49:12] trying to get something to us that that
[49:16] that we could grasp a hold of and
[49:21] realize that it's foretelling us of
[49:24] something that's fixing to take place
[49:27] that we don't want to miss so let's just
[49:31] look again and let's read here in the
[49:34] gospel of Saint Luke and we'll start
[49:38] uh
[49:42] and we'll start with the 20th um
[49:46] verse of the Gospel of Saint Luke and
[49:50] the 17th chapter
[49:52] and when
[49:54] he was demanded of the Pharisees when
[49:58] the kingdom of God should come
[50:01] he answered them and said
[50:04] the kingdom of God cometh not with
[50:09] observation
[50:10] neither shall they say Lo here or low
[50:15] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[50:19] within you
[50:20] oh I'd like just a preach right there
[50:23] for a long time
[50:25] let me say it this way
[50:30] he's saying it like this the kingdom of
[50:33] God's not going to come with observation
[50:35] it's not going to be something that you
[50:38] see
[50:39] but the kingdom of God is within you so
[50:42] it's something that is in you that can
[50:47] be contacted
[50:48] so if you have a receiver in you if if
[50:52] we could uh say it that way you have a
[50:57] part of your spirit and a part of your
[51:00] nature that can hear from God
[51:04] that you'll be able to to see you'll be
[51:07] able to hear my sheep hear my voice
[51:11] another they won't follow so the kingdom
[51:14] of God is only he only came to his own
[51:19] amen so he goes on to say
[51:23] he said the kingdom of God is within you
[51:25] and he said unto the disciples the day
[51:29] will come when ye shall desire to see
[51:33] one of the days of the son of man and ye
[51:37] shall not see it
[51:39] and they
[51:41] and they shall say to you
[51:44] see here or see there go not after them
[51:50] nor follow them for as the lightning
[51:53] that lighteth out of one part of Heaven
[51:56] shineth into the other part under heaven
[52:00] so shall also the son of man be in his
[52:03] day
[52:04] for first he must suffer many things and
[52:08] be rejected of this generation
[52:12] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[52:16] shall it be also in the days of the son
[52:20] of man
[52:22] they did eat they drank they married
[52:25] wives they were given into marriage
[52:27] until the day that Noah entered into the
[52:31] ark and the flood came and then straight
[52:34] it destroyed them all
[52:36] likewise also as it was in the days of
[52:40] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[52:44] they sold they planted they built but
[52:47] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[52:50] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[52:53] and destroyed
[52:55] them all even thus
[53:00] it be in the day when the son of man is
[53:04] revealed
[53:06] now do you understand he's telling us
[53:08] things that are going to transfer
[53:12] transpire he's telling us how to see
[53:15] what to see what to recognize what to
[53:19] look for
[53:20] so he's giving us if I can say this a
[53:24] sign
[53:25] he's telling us what the signs will be
[53:27] well if it isn't no good to recognize
[53:31] the sign unless you understand the signs
[53:35] given for an adjustment
[53:38] right so he says
[53:40] he said uh
[53:44] he did
[53:47] and in that day he shall be
[53:52] he he shall be shall be on the Housetop
[53:56] and his stuff in the house let him not
[54:00] come down to take it away
[54:03] and he that is in the field let him
[54:07] likewise not return back
[54:10] remember Lot's wife
[54:14] okay let's just think let's just not
[54:17] like we're reading some scriptures and
[54:19] stuff this is exactly the word of God
[54:22] telling you the kind of preparation and
[54:26] attitude that you need to have
[54:30] it another don't get attached to no
[54:33] stuff
[54:35] don't get attached to no job
[54:42] like nobody does
[54:48] it says remember Lot's wife
[54:52] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[54:54] shall lose it
[54:56] and whosoever shall lose his life
[54:59] shall preserve it
[55:01] I tell you that in that night there
[55:07] shall be two men in one bed and one
[55:10] shall be taken and the other shall be
[55:12] left two women shall be grinding
[55:15] together and one shall be taken and the
[55:18] other left two men shall be in the field
[55:21] and one shall be taken and the other
[55:24] left
[55:26] amen what uh
[55:29] uh what a uh awareness
[55:34] what a a a prophecy
[55:38] what what a realization
[55:42] that he's trying to give us that we need
[55:46] to grasp this realization and it's
[55:49] important that we grasp this realization
[55:52] each of us in our own lives because this
[55:57] world is designed to swallow you up
[56:01] to get to where you can't you you don't
[56:04] even look up
[56:07] you know it just got you down looking
[56:10] down looking down but the very scripture
[56:12] says look up
[56:14] clear Redemption is not in other words
[56:18] stand up look around you see where
[56:20] you're at
[56:22] because if you don't know where you are
[56:25] you can be lost
[56:28] yeah you may say well I'm not lost I
[56:31] know how to get home I know how to get
[56:33] here that ain't the journey you're on
[56:35] you're not on a journey here you're on
[56:38] another Journey that's taking to another
[56:41] land Another Place Another Kingdom and
[56:44] that there's a way there's a provided
[56:47] way to get there
[56:49] and if you're not looking for the signs
[56:53] that guide you down the way
[56:56] now if you kind of remember the way for
[56:59] us is in a physical way it's a spiritual
[57:02] way if I can say this it's a way of
[57:05] nature
[57:07] it's a way of attitude
[57:10] it's a way of atmosphere
[57:14] that's the way that he wants to see us
[57:17] in it's a it's the way of his spirit and
[57:21] his life
[57:24] because if the same life that was in him
[57:27] if the same spirit that was in Jesus
[57:30] Christ dwelleth in you it'll also
[57:33] Quicken your mortal body
[57:35] so there's a lot of distractions
[57:40] a lot of things trying to gather your
[57:43] interests trying to pull you away trying
[57:46] to deceive you because we were told in a
[57:50] very beautiful way it's like the the the
[57:53] seeds and the weeds and things they're
[57:56] deformers
[57:58] they grow up out of life and they get a
[58:02] hold of you and they deform you
[58:05] they they change your efforts they
[58:08] change your goals they they change the
[58:11] the the amount of time you give
[58:14] something pretty soon before you know it
[58:17] you're working 60 hours a week you're
[58:20] scratching to make a car payment you're
[58:23] bogged down with debt and and you're
[58:27] struggling to make a living and make a
[58:30] life
[58:32] and you're putting all your effort into
[58:36] a place that the word of God is telling
[58:39] us we're leaving
[58:43] remember this is a leaving message
[58:49] is not a staying message
[58:52] we need a guide
[58:55] we haven't been this way before
[58:59] so we're we're we're we're needing this
[59:02] great we're needing this uh great diet
[59:06] so the word of God is standing up and
[59:09] and telling us hey as when it gets to be
[59:12] like Sodom and Gomorrah when it gets to
[59:15] be like
[59:16] like in the days of Noah
[59:19] look for the the ministry of the son of
[59:22] man well how much farther for us who
[59:25] have seen the ministry of the son of man
[59:30] come here
[59:32] uh
[59:34] it would behoove us
[59:37] to have a real deep
[59:41] uh attitude check
[59:45] and attitude adjustment
[59:47] it would behoove us to have another good
[59:51] look
[59:51] at what our value structure is and
[59:55] what's important to us now I'm not
[59:58] trying to create any condemnation this
[1:00:00] morning or but I'm saying is is hey
[1:00:05] we're
[1:00:07] getting ready to leave
[1:00:10] how close are we to that time
[1:00:14] it would be important for us to check up
[1:00:18] and make sure that we're not carrying a
[1:00:23] heavier load then we need to carry
[1:00:29] I noticed one that anybody that's got a
[1:00:33] few years on them
[1:00:35] um
[1:00:37] when you go down life's Road you don't
[1:00:40] want any more junk
[1:00:42] you want to get rid of stuff
[1:00:45] get rid of this stuff get rid of that
[1:00:47] stuff you know what I mean so you know
[1:00:51] and you know Goodwill is probably one of
[1:00:53] our favorite places now not the shop
[1:00:58] to give away
[1:01:01] you know you don't need stuff you just
[1:01:03] don't need it you spend all this time
[1:01:05] and and
[1:01:07] I got tools in my shed and all kinds of
[1:01:10] tools and I don't even want to work
[1:01:12] anymore
[1:01:15] but you accumulate stuff well remember
[1:01:18] the natural types the what
[1:01:21] spiritual
[1:01:23] so we thought we've got to really sit
[1:01:27] back and ask yourself how much spiritual
[1:01:30] baggage do I have how many bad attitudes
[1:01:33] how many bad this how many bad thoughts
[1:01:36] how many bad approaches
[1:01:38] you know what what what are they you
[1:01:41] know what what concerns do I have what
[1:01:45] affections do I have what loves for the
[1:01:47] world do I have uh what are there things
[1:01:51] that I I really don't need to put my
[1:01:55] time and effort to
[1:01:58] or what things am I being left undone
[1:02:04] and so the scriptures
[1:02:08] are speaking out to us
[1:02:12] and saying hey
[1:02:14] one's going to be left
[1:02:16] one's going to be taken well I don't
[1:02:19] want the attitude well if one's going to
[1:02:20] be left fine one's going to be taken
[1:02:24] hey my attitude wait a minute
[1:02:27] what are the qualifications for the guy
[1:02:29] that's going to be taken
[1:02:33] what's he gonna be doing what what
[1:02:36] what's the Angel that's going to and fro
[1:02:40] marking the size in Christ okay if you
[1:02:43] know the Angels going by your life
[1:02:45] marking your life marking what your size
[1:02:48] are what your cries are what your
[1:02:51] interest is he knows exactly what's
[1:02:53] going on in your mind
[1:02:57] and in your life
[1:02:59] and he's reporting back we've heard many
[1:03:03] times the story of the Tudor right the
[1:03:06] holy spirit is our tutor is that right
[1:03:09] at he reports back to the father
[1:03:13] and he says my son is receiving the
[1:03:16] instructions of the word of God
[1:03:19] he's transforming he's not conforming to
[1:03:22] the world but he's transforming into the
[1:03:26] image of his father
[1:03:30] now he's reporting on you
[1:03:35] now you may not think that
[1:03:38] you may be so caught up with work so
[1:03:40] caught up with the job so caught up with
[1:03:43] your bills so caught up that it has
[1:03:47] totally slipped
[1:03:50] from your thinking
[1:03:53] that you're being reported
[1:03:56] nowadays they see everything they hear
[1:03:59] everything you say I don't know I think
[1:04:01] me and Leslie talked about something the
[1:04:03] other day and it showed up on her phone
[1:04:07] and she said they're listening to us
[1:04:14] well there's somebody a lot higher than
[1:04:16] them listening
[1:04:20] there's so many a lot higher in them
[1:04:22] watching you
[1:04:25] well actually you know it scares me when
[1:04:27] someone says did you tape up the camera
[1:04:29] on your computer I didn't know my
[1:04:31] computer had a camera
[1:04:34] you know you got to duct tape the thing
[1:04:37] why
[1:04:40] because this is the time that the angels
[1:04:42] are going to and fro
[1:04:44] marking
[1:04:46] marking
[1:04:47] the sons of gods are manifesting
[1:04:50] themselves why are they different
[1:04:55] why are their actions different why is
[1:04:58] their life different why are their
[1:05:00] affections different why are their
[1:05:02] desires different what makes you
[1:05:04] different What Makes You Different is
[1:05:08] your ability to discern the signs and
[1:05:11] the times oh ye hypocrites
[1:05:15] you can know all about the weather but
[1:05:17] you can't discern the signs of the times
[1:05:19] now let's take that personal this
[1:05:22] morning
[1:05:23] oh you hypocrite
[1:05:29] can you discern the signs of the time
[1:05:33] you recognize where we're at and what's
[1:05:36] going on and and
[1:05:39] the hypocrisy would not be in our morals
[1:05:45] the hypocrisy would be seen would be in
[1:05:49] our value system
[1:05:51] what's important to us
[1:05:54] the number one thing that should be
[1:05:57] important to us is making that rapture
[1:06:01] look let's
[1:06:03] let's just turn over a to another
[1:06:06] scripture before we uh make a few
[1:06:10] comments and then we're going to listen
[1:06:11] to a portion of God's word let's turn to
[1:06:14] Revelations the third chapter
[1:06:30] and the 14th verse
[1:06:33] to and let's read now this is
[1:06:36] really bringing it home to us right so
[1:06:41] this is our age
[1:06:43] so all the warning are prophesied
[1:06:47] warnings
[1:06:49] right it'll be like this it'll be like
[1:06:52] this it'll be like this they were
[1:06:54] prophesied warnings
[1:06:57] and now we've seen those warnings come
[1:07:00] to pass
[1:07:02] this now is a description
[1:07:06] of the prophecies that have been
[1:07:08] fulfilled all around you so how much
[1:07:12] more should we wake up
[1:07:18] one of the great terminologies you'll
[1:07:21] hear is Shake Yourself
[1:07:24] Shake Yourself what what did we listen
[1:07:28] to just a little bit ago and remember I
[1:07:31] believe the holy spirit is is saying
[1:07:34] these things to us because the Holy
[1:07:37] Spirit has one goal if I can say this
[1:07:40] forgive me speaking on his half and one
[1:07:45] objective and that's to bring you into
[1:07:48] remembrance of the word of God he didn't
[1:07:51] even come to speak of himself
[1:07:54] but to bring you into remembrance of the
[1:07:58] prophecies and the word that was spoken
[1:08:01] for our day
[1:08:03] and we can't get through a place where
[1:08:05] that's not it doesn't have Supreme
[1:08:08] importance in our life
[1:08:14] it's okay it's the time to say wait a
[1:08:17] minute I know I believe
[1:08:20] what's the word I hear so much today
[1:08:23] they call it being proactive
[1:08:28] are we proactive
[1:08:31] toward the things of God
[1:08:34] I I uh other terminologies I hear like
[1:08:39] getting ahead of the Curve
[1:08:42] you know or in other words getting get
[1:08:44] out getting out front
[1:08:47] of the issue well I think we ought to be
[1:08:50] the people that are out front
[1:08:55] we we should be on our toes
[1:08:59] because we we don't want the word of God
[1:09:02] tells us that we would neglect
[1:09:05] such a great salvation
[1:09:08] that we would let it slip and remember
[1:09:11] this is what we have to be
[1:09:16] afraid of
[1:09:19] and it's spiritual amnesia
[1:09:23] forgetting the importance
[1:09:25] just letting it slip by
[1:09:28] forgetting the importance of the word of
[1:09:30] God forgetting the importance of of
[1:09:33] being a diligent
[1:09:36] and and
[1:09:39] becoming as we know in these scriptures
[1:09:42] as we read them lukewarm and under the
[1:09:46] angel of the Church of ladyocia write
[1:09:50] these things saith the amen the faithful
[1:09:54] and true witness the beginning of the
[1:09:57] creation of God so these things were
[1:10:01] spoken to our messenger
[1:10:06] and he gave us a faithful and true
[1:10:09] witness right the same signs that Jesus
[1:10:12] used to vindicate his message
[1:10:16] the one that told us what would be here
[1:10:19] what to look for he used the same signs
[1:10:23] act he he and who was saying at the
[1:10:25] beginning of the creation of God in the
[1:10:28] beginning was the word what was the
[1:10:31] beginning all things that were made were
[1:10:33] made by him and nothing that was made
[1:10:37] that was not made by him
[1:10:39] so these things are are not man to man
[1:10:46] they're not they're not
[1:10:49] um
[1:10:50] uh history and Theology
[1:10:54] and and and tradition
[1:10:58] this is God
[1:11:00] speaking
[1:11:02] directly to you
[1:11:05] individually from his word saying this
[1:11:10] is now this is to you
[1:11:16] and that's one of the things our
[1:11:18] messenger told us is you've got to take
[1:11:20] it personally if you've got to take it
[1:11:22] for yourself it's an individual affair
[1:11:28] and if you if you don't
[1:11:36] then
[1:11:37] you're influenced
[1:11:40] by something
[1:11:42] and and so again you got to make sure
[1:11:45] that you're influenced
[1:11:50] by the word of God
[1:11:53] first and foremost
[1:11:56] and then you check the things that
[1:11:59] influence you by the word of God
[1:12:03] signs are given to give you an awareness
[1:12:08] to make you an aware
[1:12:11] and when the awareness rubs off
[1:12:14] you're not aware anymore you're not
[1:12:18] afraid anymore okay everything start to
[1:12:22] become common to you anybody that's
[1:12:25] involved in safety
[1:12:27] will tell you when things get common
[1:12:30] people get on
[1:12:33] unsafe
[1:12:37] you know I've seen it big signs that say
[1:12:40] high voltage
[1:12:44] well they just get used to working
[1:12:45] around it you know and pretty soon they
[1:12:47] got their hammers on their pouches and
[1:12:50] they got their wrenches in their back
[1:12:52] pocket high voltage
[1:12:54] high voltage
[1:12:57] and now you might as well put a sign
[1:12:58] saying electric chair
[1:13:02] but they get loose
[1:13:06] they start working instinctly
[1:13:11] they'll drop something and reach right
[1:13:13] under to something to try to grab it
[1:13:17] I remember my brother dropped a nut a
[1:13:20] bolt after he went down and he stuck it
[1:13:23] he stuck his hand under the panel
[1:13:27] down under the floor where the because
[1:13:29] piece of it wasn't and the only reason
[1:13:32] he didn't get zap is all the hair on his
[1:13:35] body started standing up
[1:13:39] what was it
[1:13:42] it was a total unawareness
[1:13:47] of the surroundings
[1:13:49] and the circumstance
[1:13:52] and the danger that's
[1:13:55] at hand
[1:13:57] and that's what the enemy wants to do he
[1:14:00] wants to lull us into thinking
[1:14:02] everything's peaceful and everything's
[1:14:04] safe and everything's good and the Very
[1:14:07] word of God says they say peace and
[1:14:10] safety and then sudden destruction
[1:14:13] strikes in
[1:14:15] so we're here this morning
[1:14:19] because this is the house of correction
[1:14:22] it's the house of reproof correction
[1:14:25] doesn't mean the punish correction means
[1:14:28] to alter our attitude
[1:14:31] to alter our habits the things that
[1:14:35] we're letting slip we go back and and
[1:14:40] reignite uh our passion
[1:14:44] because the very thing they lost in the
[1:14:46] first stage was they lost their first
[1:14:48] love and and I want to say this humbly
[1:14:51] as I can but my heart fears
[1:14:56] because I feel across the message that
[1:15:00] there's a a softening of love for this
[1:15:03] message
[1:15:07] that other things are attracting
[1:15:10] other voices
[1:15:13] other types of music
[1:15:17] and it's hard I I know people got upset
[1:15:20] at me because I wouldn't sing certain
[1:15:22] songs and and everything well go ahead
[1:15:25] go and sing those songs someplace up but
[1:15:28] you're going to meet it at the Judgment
[1:15:29] God don't like rock and roll
[1:15:34] reverence
[1:15:37] was what he liked
[1:15:42] really a reverence a respect
[1:15:45] an admonition and uplifting
[1:15:49] we don't sing songs because we like to
[1:15:52] beat and we like the music they've
[1:15:55] really got to be uh something there's
[1:15:57] there's songs maybe that we sing that I
[1:16:00] battle with personally but I try
[1:16:05] not to
[1:16:07] force my own things but if something's
[1:16:10] not drawing you closer to the Lord and
[1:16:13] you the first thing that attracts you is
[1:16:16] the sound of it
[1:16:19] get in his presence
[1:16:22] and and present it to him
[1:16:25] and let the spirit
[1:16:27] purify it
[1:16:29] for you
[1:16:33] because
[1:16:34] we've been warned
[1:16:38] now let me read this last two scriptures
[1:16:41] to you
[1:16:44] he says I Know Thy works
[1:16:47] doubt doubt are neither cold nor hot
[1:16:51] I would that were cold or hot
[1:16:55] so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[1:17:00] and neither cold nor hot
[1:17:03] I will spill thee out of my mouth
[1:17:08] what a warning
[1:17:10] I mean
[1:17:12] he means what he says
[1:17:16] and when the word of God gets numb to us
[1:17:21] then it doesn't shake us the way it it
[1:17:25] used to if it doesn't strike us it
[1:17:29] doesn't strike the fear of God in our
[1:17:31] heart the beginning of wisdom is the
[1:17:34] fear of God hey am I hot or cold am I
[1:17:38] lukewarm I don't want to be spilled out
[1:17:40] of his mouth it ought to the word of God
[1:17:44] ought to send a message to the kingdom
[1:17:48] of God that is within you
[1:17:53] if you haven't had anything work on your
[1:17:56] heart for a while
[1:17:58] that's because the flues and the power
[1:18:02] lines and the communications is all
[1:18:05] stopped up
[1:18:09] what's he saying get them unstopped
[1:18:14] don't go on
[1:18:17] with problems in your life
[1:18:21] don't condemn yourself because you've
[1:18:23] got them
[1:18:24] but don't get lukewarm that you're not
[1:18:27] dealing with them
[1:18:31] and then of course you know the rest of
[1:18:33] this because they'll sayeth I'm rich and
[1:18:35] increase with goods and have need of
[1:18:37] nothing and knoweth not thou God are
[1:18:40] wretched and miserable poor blind and
[1:18:44] naked and then we know that he counsels
[1:18:47] us and one last scripture this morning
[1:18:52] and that is in Hebrews
[1:19:07] Hebrews the fifth
[1:19:09] chapter
[1:19:18] let's just start with the 11th verse and
[1:19:21] read
[1:19:23] these scriptures this morning
[1:19:28] he's of of whom we have many things to
[1:19:33] say
[1:19:34] and it's hard to be uttered seeing ye
[1:19:38] are dull
[1:19:39] of hearing
[1:19:42] oh my
[1:19:46] Paul said I'm trying to get something
[1:19:47] across to you but we're getting dull of
[1:19:50] hearing
[1:19:52] don't get all of hearing
[1:19:54] do you understand
[1:19:58] it
[1:20:00] I I know that
[1:20:03] what our kids get tired they get
[1:20:06] tiredness of trying to train them trying
[1:20:09] to tell us the same thing every don't go
[1:20:11] out there don't do that don't do this
[1:20:13] don't listen to that don't go hanging
[1:20:16] out down there don't don't do this don't
[1:20:19] do this and and Paul's sitting there I
[1:20:21] know you guys are getting
[1:20:23] dull of hearing
[1:20:26] but we can't get dull of hearing
[1:20:31] I would be remiss in my duties if I let
[1:20:34] us all get dull of hearing where all we
[1:20:37] had is a good party going on here
[1:20:40] you know let's have service in the
[1:20:42] morning and let's go picnic and barbecue
[1:20:45] and play basketball in the afternoon all
[1:20:48] is well
[1:20:51] no we've got communion tonight
[1:20:56] communion is is hardly in the message
[1:21:01] anymore
[1:21:02] once or twice a year
[1:21:05] go read the communion book
[1:21:08] look all that the prophet of God says
[1:21:11] what it what it is when you go to
[1:21:14] communion
[1:21:16] it's you putting yourself up against the
[1:21:18] urum Thunder
[1:21:20] for you to judge your life
[1:21:23] well what's the easiest way to get away
[1:21:25] from that is don't put yourself in front
[1:21:28] of it
[1:21:30] right don't go to nothing that's going
[1:21:32] to condemn you don't do it don't do
[1:21:35] nothing but the beautiful part of
[1:21:38] communion is the holy spirit promises in
[1:21:42] communion to be there and convict your
[1:21:46] heart
[1:21:48] being convicted by the holy spirit is
[1:21:51] one of the most wonderful parts of a
[1:21:54] Christian's life
[1:21:56] in fact what did he even say the Holy
[1:21:58] Spirit was to do it was to convictus of
[1:22:02] sin of unbelief
[1:22:06] well I don't want something in me that's
[1:22:08] going to keep me out right convict Me
[1:22:11] Lord
[1:22:16] it's a blessing
[1:22:19] if if if if you get Dolly hearing you
[1:22:23] know hey I don't want to get tired of
[1:22:24] hearing about communion no you know what
[1:22:26] come to communion
[1:22:29] come to communion
[1:22:33] I didn't want to I'm not didn't come to
[1:22:35] preach about communion but it come up to
[1:22:37] me right at this moment but if you
[1:22:39] co-read the book he said if you don't do
[1:22:41] these three ordinances you will not be
[1:22:44] there
[1:22:47] sorry
[1:22:50] Give Me Your Righteous program
[1:22:54] don't take communion you ain't going
[1:22:57] sorry sorry
[1:22:59] sorry sorry
[1:23:03] I don't mean you're all sorry
[1:23:07] but it's the truth
[1:23:09] we don't want that no more you know what
[1:23:11] we want you're the bride
[1:23:14] you're elected you're going you can't go
[1:23:18] to hell your name's on the Lamb's Book
[1:23:21] of Life the prophet of God said we've
[1:23:23] taken Grace and turned it into disgrace
[1:23:28] oh my
[1:23:31] God if your name's on the Lamb's Book of
[1:23:33] Life you will be at Communion sorry if
[1:23:36] you're not at Communion there's no
[1:23:39] evidence that your name is on the Lamb's
[1:23:42] Book of Life you are fooling yourself
[1:23:45] the scripture says away seemeth right
[1:23:47] unto a man but the end thereof is death
[1:23:50] you've got your own righteousness which
[1:23:53] by the way is filthy rags
[1:23:59] he's provided away
[1:24:02] he's provided a way of Escape
[1:24:06] and the way of Escape is full obedience
[1:24:10] to the word of God
[1:24:14] so I mean I'm going to have hard enough
[1:24:17] time getting in
[1:24:19] myself because I know what a rascal I am
[1:24:22] but I'm not going to have the fact that
[1:24:24] I failed to preach the gospel
[1:24:29] on my charge
[1:24:32] let's just read again this beautiful
[1:24:34] scripture here we're reading
[1:24:42] that was I mean Hebrews
[1:24:44] the fifth chapter I think we started
[1:24:48] um
[1:24:50] here
[1:24:52] um
[1:24:53] first fifth calculator verse what did we
[1:24:57] go to 11.
[1:24:59] it says for when for the time he ought
[1:25:03] to be teachers
[1:25:06] you have need that one teach you again
[1:25:11] which be the first principles
[1:25:15] of the Oracles of God
[1:25:21] that's pretty straightforward don't you
[1:25:23] think
[1:25:25] for all of us who feel that we know it
[1:25:27] all we're also self-righteous he's
[1:25:30] saying hey you ought to be teaching
[1:25:32] these things
[1:25:34] well we've got to be taught them again I
[1:25:37] I'm almost feeling when I start looking
[1:25:39] around wait a minute what happened to
[1:25:42] the ABCs what happened to things that
[1:25:45] Prophet taught about high heels about
[1:25:47] shorts about haircuts about about
[1:25:50] pulling us about being the church on
[1:25:52] time about fellowshipping with the
[1:25:55] things of the world it's almost like
[1:25:58] we're sitting back and and without
[1:26:00] knowing it we're falling asleep
[1:26:04] we're becoming lukewarm
[1:26:08] we're becoming self-confident we're
[1:26:11] becoming to think that it's all sewed up
[1:26:15] you know what we're doing we're falling
[1:26:17] into the Slumber of the sleeping virgin
[1:26:24] but we want to wake up
[1:26:28] and what
[1:26:29] what trim our lamps
[1:26:31] that we can what See Clearly
[1:26:37] that's what we want
[1:26:40] we want we want to see clearly
[1:26:44] we want to be able to recognize
[1:26:49] what's transpiring
[1:26:51] doesn't ask what he said
[1:26:54] he said
[1:26:56] teachers the principles of the Oracle of
[1:26:59] God and are becomes such as that have
[1:27:01] need of milk
[1:27:03] and not strong meat
[1:27:09] for everyone that useth milk is
[1:27:12] unskilled
[1:27:14] in the word of righteousness for he is
[1:27:19] as a babe
[1:27:21] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[1:27:25] are
[1:27:26] of full age
[1:27:28] even those who by reason
[1:27:32] of use
[1:27:34] have their senses exercised to discern
[1:27:40] both Good and Evil
[1:27:46] amen if am I making myself
[1:27:50] clear
[1:27:52] okay
[1:27:54] we've got to put our spiritual
[1:27:55] eyeglasses on
[1:27:58] we've got to come to an awareness
[1:28:01] there's there's no need uh uh running
[1:28:06] and jumping and screaming and at and
[1:28:09] having a good time if we can't see the
[1:28:13] message we're going to listen to for 20
[1:28:16] minutes now is called recognizing your
[1:28:20] day
[1:28:21] and its message
[1:28:24] the importance of recognizing your day
[1:28:29] we just read several scriptures about
[1:28:33] Discerning about recognizing about not
[1:28:37] being able to see what's transpiring and
[1:28:40] I'm not talking about only the general
[1:28:43] picture
[1:28:44] I'm talking about the picture of your
[1:28:47] own life
[1:28:51] Discerning what's coming into your life
[1:28:54] what's drawing into your life what's
[1:28:57] coming into your life can influence your
[1:29:00] screen where is this having reason of
[1:29:04] exercise where is this decision going to
[1:29:08] take me
[1:29:15] you know we don't we don't think
[1:29:19] of decisions
[1:29:23] I remember a friend of mine telling me
[1:29:25] that he went on vacation so he told his
[1:29:28] son he said whatever you don't drive my
[1:29:31] car
[1:29:33] well they left what do you think the boy
[1:29:35] did
[1:29:38] first thing he did he took the car
[1:29:42] well he was driving the car around he
[1:29:44] drove it for a few days and then one day
[1:29:46] coming in pulling in the drive he heard
[1:29:48] a scrape
[1:29:51] and he thought
[1:29:53] oh my goodness I
[1:29:55] wrecked the car
[1:29:57] so he parked the car in a garage he got
[1:29:59] out and looked and there was a great big
[1:30:01] scrape
[1:30:02] on the side of the car
[1:30:05] so he said oh my goodness I'm in trouble
[1:30:09] so he grabbed the car and he took it
[1:30:12] down to the dealership and he went and
[1:30:15] got all kinds of money and paid him for
[1:30:17] a rush job and and everything it got him
[1:30:20] fixed up and all that and got the den
[1:30:23] all in there and looked around it was
[1:30:24] all clean he sat in there well then the
[1:30:27] dad come home
[1:30:28] he said he looked around he said wow he
[1:30:32] said did you drive my car
[1:30:36] he said no
[1:30:39] he said well then how did the dent get
[1:30:41] fixed that I put in it before I left
[1:30:54] see you don't even know what you're
[1:30:57] causing
[1:30:59] and then we try to fix things and adjust
[1:31:02] things and do things and make excuses
[1:31:06] for a thing
[1:31:08] no it could it's seriously
[1:31:11] a Time
[1:31:13] now I'd like to just read these
[1:31:15] statements to you
[1:31:17] this morning before we listen to our
[1:31:19] just 20 more minutes
[1:31:22] this is from a message
[1:31:24] God doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:31:28] without first
[1:31:31] warning him
[1:31:35] all these things that scriptures we've
[1:31:37] read are warnings
[1:31:40] the sign is a warning
[1:31:45] it's a message it's a warning lady Elsia
[1:31:48] age is a warning
[1:31:50] the times of Noah the times of Sodom and
[1:31:53] Gomorrah the morals all these things
[1:31:56] another great message was preached was
[1:31:58] the flashing red lights of the sign of
[1:32:01] his coming
[1:32:02] all these things now are things the
[1:32:06] trouble with it is is these are things
[1:32:08] that he's revealed to us that leave us
[1:32:11] without excuse
[1:32:17] that's the problem
[1:32:20] you can't plead ignorance
[1:32:27] you might be able to plead selfishness
[1:32:31] or self-love
[1:32:33] or lover of pleasure
[1:32:36] but you've got no excuse for missing the
[1:32:40] warnings
[1:32:41] and packing
[1:32:44] the wrong approach and attitude
[1:32:50] I'm not trying to create condemnation
[1:32:53] this morning I'm not preaching
[1:32:55] condemnation I'm preaching an awareness
[1:32:58] that we've got to recognize that we've
[1:33:02] got to be more aware of the signs than
[1:33:07] everything they're flashing everywhere
[1:33:11] some things fixing to happen
[1:33:14] take heed
[1:33:16] make adjustments
[1:33:21] in in yourself in your spirit in your
[1:33:25] being in your diet spiritual diet
[1:33:29] he says
[1:33:32] now everyone has this we might say well
[1:33:36] this fella died without a warning no no
[1:33:39] no no no
[1:33:41] God never you don't know
[1:33:44] what was in that man's heart
[1:33:48] you don't know what's been a going on in
[1:33:53] his life
[1:33:56] God never brings any man to his death
[1:34:00] without first warning him about it
[1:34:04] telling him
[1:34:06] if something a preparation
[1:34:12] God is sovereign
[1:34:15] he knocks at the heart of every man
[1:34:19] giving him the opportunity to come
[1:34:24] he's knocking this morning at your heart
[1:34:27] giving you the opportunity to come back
[1:34:30] into fellowship with the message of the
[1:34:34] hour which is what's the only thing that
[1:34:37] can guide you
[1:34:44] it's personal
[1:34:47] all of you have access to listen to the
[1:34:49] tapes
[1:34:50] I don't know uh uh who you live with
[1:34:55] those of you that are home I don't know
[1:34:58] whether you have unbelieving parents
[1:35:00] unbelieving spouses unbelieving
[1:35:02] relatives I I don't care but there's not
[1:35:05] one person in here that doesn't have the
[1:35:07] ability
[1:35:09] to listen to the word of God
[1:35:14] read it if you need to
[1:35:19] but that's that is your thing because
[1:35:24] this message is a preparation
[1:35:28] and the warnings that were in this
[1:35:31] message about the this indictment of
[1:35:34] Jesus Christ the second crucifixion of
[1:35:36] Jesus Christ the indictment the flashing
[1:35:39] red lights the God of this evil age uh
[1:35:42] Satan's Eden all these great warnings
[1:35:45] that went out to tell us that don't get
[1:35:50] caught up
[1:35:53] we're leaving
[1:35:55] well Peter even dealt with it they say
[1:35:58] where is the sign of his coming
[1:35:59] everything Remains the Same they didn't
[1:36:02] have these things
[1:36:06] Paul said these certain things have to
[1:36:08] come to pass first the son is the Son of
[1:36:12] Perdition has to be revealed not only
[1:36:14] has he been revealed we've seen this
[1:36:16] whole history from the first horse rider
[1:36:19] all the way through
[1:36:21] till the end the seals are open the
[1:36:24] Mysteries reveal
[1:36:26] so he's done his part
[1:36:30] of preparing us
[1:36:32] the question is are we recognizing
[1:36:37] is there a recognition going on in our
[1:36:40] lives
[1:36:43] he says
[1:36:45] giving him the opportunity to come now
[1:36:48] he might he might worn away and turn it
[1:36:52] down
[1:36:54] and shake his head to it and walk away
[1:36:57] and say ah is just a funny feeling
[1:37:02] I'll get over it but anyhow it was God
[1:37:06] speaking to him
[1:37:10] you know another word for that funny
[1:37:12] feeling is conviction
[1:37:15] if you're sitting here this morning and
[1:37:16] say you know something I really haven't
[1:37:18] been on fire for God
[1:37:21] I've been lukewarm I haven't been
[1:37:23] reading I've been looking at everything
[1:37:24] I've been looking at boys I've been
[1:37:26] looking at girls I've been looking at
[1:37:29] Fashions my heart's every place else you
[1:37:32] know
[1:37:34] get your priorities right
[1:37:36] God first
[1:37:39] family second
[1:37:41] you third
[1:37:44] it's not just a funny feeling
[1:37:48] this morning I'm trying to be as cordial
[1:37:51] and nights as I can but there are people
[1:37:55] that are in danger of the Judgment
[1:37:58] because not because they're bad because
[1:38:01] they're just getting so lukewarm that he
[1:38:05] can't deny his word
[1:38:07] if you say you're sorry he's just in
[1:38:10] faithful to forgive you because he can't
[1:38:12] deny his word
[1:38:14] but if you become lukewarm he's got a
[1:38:17] dispute out of his mouth
[1:38:20] and how many
[1:38:24] excuse me how many parables could we go
[1:38:27] through
[1:38:29] we've got it we've got so one-sided
[1:38:33] that we don't think we can do anything
[1:38:35] wrong
[1:38:37] no you will reap what you sow
[1:38:42] let's just finish up and then I'll
[1:38:44] finish up
[1:38:45] he says God never brings judgment upon
[1:38:48] the Earth without first giving the
[1:38:50] people warning God never does nothing
[1:38:53] without declaring it first what he's
[1:38:56] going to do and he gives people a choice
[1:39:01] you can do right or wrong see God never
[1:39:06] changes his nature his program can never
[1:39:09] change from what he started with because
[1:39:13] he's infinite and he is programmed in
[1:39:16] his ideas are all perfect and if he
[1:39:19] would change that would show that he had
[1:39:23] learned more
[1:39:24] so being infinite he cannot learn more
[1:39:28] his first decision is always perfect and
[1:39:31] there's nothing can ever change it
[1:39:35] now we find out that his nature here
[1:39:39] to always to warn a man before judgment
[1:39:43] to warn a nation before judgment and so
[1:39:47] forth he always gives his warning a
[1:39:51] reminder
[1:39:52] to we
[1:39:54] of a responsibility
[1:39:57] we are responsible and God has put us
[1:40:00] here on the earth for a reason and that
[1:40:05] reason that he has put us here for we
[1:40:09] are responsible to him for that reason
[1:40:15] he put you here for the rapture
[1:40:18] how many believes God put you here for
[1:40:20] the rapture
[1:40:23] you got a responsibility to the Rapture
[1:40:26] it's not something that's just going to
[1:40:28] happen
[1:40:30] it's there's a responsibility to it you
[1:40:33] should go to him and find out what he
[1:40:37] wants you to do
[1:40:39] see if you don't if we went to work for
[1:40:43] a man and he give you a job on a ranch
[1:40:48] or something other and you just went out
[1:40:51] to the barn and just sat down out there
[1:40:54] and said well see you must go ask him
[1:40:58] what he wants you to do and then do it
[1:41:03] if you're working for a man find out
[1:41:06] what your duty is well how about for God
[1:41:11] amen so we're going to turn over to
[1:41:14] paragraph 64 of the message recognizing
[1:41:19] your day
[1:41:21] and its message
[1:41:23] your responsibility to recognize the day
[1:41:28] and the message to your day
[1:41:31] you're responsible
[1:41:33] for that
[1:41:36] hey don't shirk your responsibility what
[1:41:40] do you want to find out
[1:41:41] where who
[1:41:43] you are you receiving the message from
[1:41:48] what they are warning you about
[1:41:53] the evidence and Vindication of what
[1:41:56] they are warning you about
[1:41:58] and remember that it's only warnings are
[1:42:02] only
[1:42:03] to certain
[1:42:06] individuals
[1:42:09] this warning is only for the bride
[1:42:12] you have to listen for 20 minutes
[1:42:15] and then we'll we'll close as you listen
[1:42:19] to your messenger
[1:42:21] trying to stir you up
[1:42:25] to recognizing the day in the message
[1:42:27] and your responsibility I believe you'll
[1:42:31] love this little portion of tape God
[1:42:34] richly bless you this morning
[1:42:37] recognizing the day and its message God
[1:42:41] bless you
[1:42:48] that in the third day
[1:42:51] we'll be gathered again
[1:42:56] after two days in the third day
[1:43:00] we will be gathered again
[1:43:02] receive life in his sight
[1:43:06] promises
[1:43:08] they are perfectly wrote on the wall
[1:43:13] we see where we are living
[1:43:16] now in the Homeland waiting for the
[1:43:18] Feast of the trumpets
[1:43:20] are the recognizing of the atonement
[1:43:24] and to uh wait for the coming
[1:43:29] to mourn for their rejection of the
[1:43:31] first time that they rejected it they're
[1:43:33] in a Homeland for that waiting what are
[1:43:35] they all everything is positionally
[1:43:37] placed
[1:43:39] the minister of the Gospel I can't see
[1:43:43] one thing left
[1:43:45] but the going of the Bride
[1:43:47] and the bride has to be taken away
[1:43:50] before they can recognize what's
[1:43:52] happened
[1:43:55] they were
[1:43:56] bound scattered I mean they were
[1:43:59] scattered blinded and out gathered
[1:44:03] what's left
[1:44:07] the bride to be taken out of the way
[1:44:09] waiting for the going of her bride so
[1:44:12] their prophets of Revelations 11 can
[1:44:15] call them to the Feast of the trumpet
[1:44:18] to make them to recognize what they have
[1:44:20] done
[1:44:22] remember right between those seals
[1:44:25] came forth The Sixth Seal and that was
[1:44:29] 144 000 Chosen and called and between
[1:44:33] the sixth and seventh trumpet
[1:44:34] Revelations 11 appears right there
[1:44:37] exactly in line with the Sixth Seal
[1:44:40] what to do what was it to do and this
[1:44:43] wants to bring forth two witnesses Moses
[1:44:47] analyze
[1:44:49] prophets which the Jews only believe
[1:44:51] their Prophets
[1:44:53] and they'll come forth with the sign of
[1:44:55] the prophets
[1:44:58] and their work will be that of the
[1:45:00] Prophet amen
[1:45:02] for they did exactly what showing one
[1:45:04] thing
[1:45:06] that man when you die but whatever when
[1:45:09] you leave this world your nature doesn't
[1:45:12] change
[1:45:13] if you're a liar now you'll be a liar
[1:45:16] there
[1:45:17] if you're headed here you'll be headed
[1:45:19] there
[1:45:20] if you're a doubter here you'd be a
[1:45:22] counter there man and women it's time to
[1:45:25] shake yourselves and examine yourselves
[1:45:28] and see where we are standing
[1:45:31] for death does not change it they've
[1:45:34] been gone for 2 000 years Moses for a
[1:45:37] minute about 2500 years and Elijah for
[1:45:40] uh ever since almost 2500 years has
[1:45:44] Elijah been gone and Moses have been
[1:45:46] gone and here they return with the same
[1:45:48] nature and do the same things
[1:45:53] death doesn't do nothing to a man but
[1:45:55] change his Dwelling Place
[1:45:58] doesn't change your nature
[1:46:00] doesn't change your faith
[1:46:02] doesn't change nothing in you but your
[1:46:04] dwelling place so which away your nature
[1:46:06] is this morning if you're a daughter of
[1:46:09] God's word you'd be a doubter over there
[1:46:15] I don't care how old you are how you
[1:46:17] live and how could you live it wouldn't
[1:46:20] change you one bit to die just your
[1:46:22] dwelling place and if you can't accept
[1:46:24] the whole word of God the way it's
[1:46:26] written you wouldn't do it there so
[1:46:28] don't worry you won't be there
[1:46:31] you've got to accept it in this fullness
[1:46:34] and the power of His Vindication and the
[1:46:36] revelation of what it is
[1:46:39] that you become a part of it it's only
[1:46:41] his word that he'll raise up
[1:46:44] as he did his word
[1:46:46] on the first Easter morning only his
[1:46:48] word came forth
[1:46:50] and those who had died in his word
[1:46:53] believing his word and Vindicated his
[1:46:55] word
[1:46:56] notice
[1:46:57] now that's been 2700 years ago
[1:47:01] notice they were scattered
[1:47:03] they were blinded and now they've been
[1:47:06] gathered
[1:47:07] now the next thing is that they are to
[1:47:10] receive life
[1:47:13] and the Gentiles are called out the
[1:47:16] bride's ready the Rapture is at hand
[1:47:19] can we realize that
[1:47:22] can we actually believe that
[1:47:24] is it a story that's been told is it a
[1:47:28] myth to us
[1:47:29] is it a something that sounds real
[1:47:31] is it something that we outside can't
[1:47:34] believe or is it something that's in US
[1:47:39] that's part of us
[1:47:41] but it's more than life to us
[1:47:46] What attitude do we sit in this morning
[1:47:48] in this Tabernacle
[1:47:51] remember it'll be a small flock that
[1:47:53] receives it
[1:47:56] now in the Homeland waiting for the
[1:47:58] trumpets
[1:47:59] now waiting for the going of their own
[1:48:01] Pride so that Revelations 11 can be
[1:48:05] fulfilled the church age has ceased
[1:48:09] the seals has been opened that prove
[1:48:12] what they left out in the church age
[1:48:16] and the message has been given
[1:48:19] Israel is on the scene
[1:48:22] Hallelujah ready
[1:48:24] why are the beasts of trumpets
[1:48:29] all you men in other lands or you'll
[1:48:32] hear this tape can't you wake up my
[1:48:34] brother
[1:48:37] or does it blind you
[1:48:40] would you throw it out and call it false
[1:48:42] prophecy when it's Vindicated right
[1:48:44] before you by the worrying by the time
[1:48:48] by the peoples
[1:48:50] and by the Holy Spirit
[1:48:52] who wrote it it's Vindicated both nicely
[1:48:55] spiritually materially everything that
[1:48:58] he said is fulfilled and proven
[1:49:01] Israel in her land
[1:49:03] drove him in there hurting him in there
[1:49:06] like sheep
[1:49:08] the Wolves got entered and run back to
[1:49:11] safety to their own land remember
[1:49:12] Israel's only promised to be blessed as
[1:49:14] long as she was in her land
[1:49:16] God never blesses Israel outside of the
[1:49:19] land
[1:49:20] Abraham went outside the land was
[1:49:22] condemned everyone that leaves the land
[1:49:24] is condemned God only can bless Israel
[1:49:26] when she stays in her Homeland
[1:49:29] and she's there now as a nation
[1:49:34] and the church is called
[1:49:37] she's just only waiting
[1:49:39] for the Rapture of the Bride
[1:49:42] take it out
[1:49:43] the seals are open it's revealed to us
[1:49:47] see what they left off you either want
[1:49:49] to debate and fuss about the serpent
[1:49:51] seed and water baptism and so forth
[1:49:54] you're blind and it don't know it
[1:49:57] God of this world
[1:50:01] and you don't know it
[1:50:04] wonder I had such a time this morning
[1:50:06] fighting to them pressures
[1:50:10] so their profits can be revealed and
[1:50:13] this last day you can't do it through
[1:50:15] the trumpet of the Feast of the trumpets
[1:50:19] he said through Hosea
[1:50:21] I have hewed
[1:50:24] I watch Israel is talking to you I have
[1:50:26] hewed
[1:50:27] or in other words I have chopped
[1:50:30] chop them out
[1:50:33] through the prophets
[1:50:35] that's how God does his people
[1:50:38] he chopped them out from the rest of the
[1:50:41] Nations amen
[1:50:43] what man
[1:50:44] just two eight sword amen is wired he
[1:50:48] chopped him
[1:50:49] this nation from the Nations
[1:50:53] he chopped his Nation from the Nations
[1:50:56] by the prophets his Vindicated word so
[1:51:00] has he chopped his bride from the
[1:51:02] denominations by his words
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:07] promised America 4 in the last day
[1:51:11] chopped out his bride humor from the
[1:51:15] rest of the churches
[1:51:17] you know this bride
[1:51:19] shut down His prophets fill with His
[1:51:21] prophets for the word chop in Israel
[1:51:23] separate yourself from the rest of them
[1:51:27] look at when they want to act like the
[1:51:29] rest of them they came to the prophet
[1:51:31] Samuel he said have I ever took your
[1:51:34] money
[1:51:34] have I ever spoke to you anything in the
[1:51:37] name of the Lord but what happened
[1:51:38] I said no that's that's right but we
[1:51:40] still want a king
[1:51:42] that's the way the churches is dead
[1:51:45] oh we believe the word it's all right
[1:51:46] but you know that we say we should do
[1:51:48] this I don't care what they say the word
[1:51:50] is right
[1:51:53] waiting just chop them out through the
[1:51:56] prophets
[1:51:58] what time is it brother
[1:52:00] what time is it minister
[1:52:05] you see the time of the day and the sign
[1:52:08] you're living under
[1:52:09] can you understand
[1:52:11] do you see it
[1:52:14] everywhere now
[1:52:16] there's no Revival
[1:52:18] everybody's complaining Minister's
[1:52:20] crying
[1:52:22] us reading one of the outstanding papers
[1:52:25] that comes here to the church a very
[1:52:27] fine paper
[1:52:29] now I know the editor and I know the
[1:52:31] people they're godly people
[1:52:33] very fine
[1:52:35] brother sister Moore of the herald of
[1:52:38] his coming
[1:52:39] one of the finest papers on the field
[1:52:41] Harold of his tummy but they hardly will
[1:52:44] print anything unless it's about fast
[1:52:47] pray fast pray sound a trumpet get how
[1:52:51] many reads it you know who you see it
[1:52:52] all time fast pray fast pray it's all
[1:52:54] you hear fast pray we're going to have a
[1:52:56] great break-in of the day that's a great
[1:52:58] thing going to happen all of you pray
[1:52:59] pray we're not too late yet
[1:53:02] why do they do that
[1:53:04] why do they do that
[1:53:07] they want to create Awakening
[1:53:09] they're crying bleeding yet they will be
[1:53:11] awakened they're good people
[1:53:14] why is it what have they done they have
[1:53:18] not recognized The Awakening of the
[1:53:20] Bride
[1:53:21] see
[1:53:22] by being a Christian they feel the pull
[1:53:25] of the hour but they haven't recognized
[1:53:28] what's been done
[1:53:30] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:53:31] yeah
[1:53:32] they know something's supposed to happen
[1:53:35] but see they're looking for it way off
[1:53:37] in the future to come when it's already
[1:53:38] happened right by you
[1:53:41] that's the same thing they did in the
[1:53:43] old days
[1:53:44] they'll be the coming Messiah they
[1:53:46] believe that there'd be a forerunner
[1:53:47] come but it was right on them and they
[1:53:49] didn't know it they didn't recognize it
[1:53:52] they be there or come a forerunner they
[1:53:54] would forerun them aside and they cut
[1:53:56] his head off
[1:53:57] a killer Messiah because it was
[1:54:01] prophesied that they'd be blinded
[1:54:03] Hosea Said So In The Same Spirit that
[1:54:06] spoke to Hosea spoke to John and said
[1:54:08] the church in this last days would be
[1:54:10] naked and blind amen and would put him
[1:54:14] outside the church
[1:54:16] they failed to see those prophecies
[1:54:18] fulfilled but be in there they realize
[1:54:21] that something has got to happen
[1:54:23] they just don't get it they don't
[1:54:25] realize it
[1:54:27] much like the Jews of Old Times blind
[1:54:30] and laosia
[1:54:32] Rich's theology hostile with the church
[1:54:35] hustle towards the message
[1:54:37] look how hustle of Jews was were John
[1:54:40] look how hostile he was with Jesus when
[1:54:43] he was the very one that they claimed
[1:54:46] that they were looking for
[1:54:49] I believe we blowed a fuse
[1:54:53] I suppose that cuts the tape recorders
[1:54:55] off too
[1:54:56] it doesn't
[1:54:58] all right
[1:55:00] they were hostile
[1:55:03] towards the message
[1:55:05] what happens is that so much momentum
[1:55:08] each one of you all are a heating unit
[1:55:11] there's no way to keep the church
[1:55:12] perfectly normal and though under those
[1:55:14] times the cause you see each one of you
[1:55:16] are 98 BTUs normally and you just don't
[1:55:20] sit there like that you're constantly
[1:55:21] putting out Heat
[1:55:23] there's enough air and you're now to
[1:55:25] freeze the place up
[1:55:26] but with a heating unit going forth you
[1:55:28] you can't do it
[1:55:30] notice hostile
[1:55:33] but now like the Jews of old blind and
[1:55:37] they're at lady asea
[1:55:39] they're naked miserable wretched and
[1:55:41] don't know it
[1:55:43] day of riches
[1:55:46] great theological teachings
[1:55:48] great education
[1:55:51] and now they have become hostile
[1:55:54] towards the message
[1:55:56] they want nothing to do with it
[1:55:58] just like it was back in the days when
[1:56:01] Jesus of Nazareth was on Earth
[1:56:03] the reason people in Noah's day did not
[1:56:07] go into the ark because they never
[1:56:10] recognized the message nor the messenger
[1:56:13] that's the only reason they perished is
[1:56:16] because they didn't recognize the hour
[1:56:18] that they were living
[1:56:20] they didn't recognize that God would
[1:56:22] deal with sin
[1:56:24] as he promised he would you destroy a
[1:56:27] man from the face of the Earth
[1:56:28] he had prophesied it he meant it and he
[1:56:32] means that today the same as he did Dan
[1:56:35] but the people instead of being
[1:56:37] favorable towards Noah he was considered
[1:56:39] a wild man
[1:56:41] they didn't believe him to be a prophet
[1:56:44] you know Jesus he known self told us how
[1:56:46] they scoffed in the days of Noah
[1:56:49] made fun of him
[1:56:51] called him a fanatic and want more
[1:56:54] but they didn't recognize their hour
[1:56:57] they didn't recognize the day
[1:56:59] they didn't recognize the sign they
[1:57:02] didn't recognize the message
[1:57:04] they didn't recognize the messenger but
[1:57:07] put him from their midst and laughed at
[1:57:09] him Jesus says it Wows in the days of
[1:57:12] Noah
[1:57:15] with Israel in her land and everything
[1:57:17] sitting down the message is just
[1:57:18] perfectly moving in what day are we
[1:57:21] living brother
[1:57:22] where are we at
[1:57:25] they didn't know the day
[1:57:27] they didn't know that's reason they
[1:57:28] missed it is because they didn't
[1:57:30] recognize it
[1:57:31] they were like the day like someone like
[1:57:34] the people today
[1:57:37] by scientific proofs
[1:57:39] by Educational Systems by theological
[1:57:42] seminaries
[1:57:44] and things that blinded them in that day
[1:57:47] it's done the same thing today
[1:57:50] it's blinded them again
[1:57:54] and also the Simplicity Simplicity of
[1:57:59] the message and the messenger
[1:58:01] Noah wasn't scientific
[1:58:03] he wasn't an educated man
[1:58:06] he's a poor farmer humble with a simple
[1:58:09] message it was too simple for their High
[1:58:11] Learning
[1:58:13] so is it today
[1:58:14] God always makes it simple to get the
[1:58:16] people who will believe and trust him
[1:58:19] it's a different
[1:58:21] just a different message
[1:58:23] but the same God
[1:58:26] I want you to believe it
[1:58:28] and understand that God has spoken Jesus
[1:58:31] said they scoffed at his Prophet Noah
[1:58:35] and as his scoffed in that day so will
[1:58:37] they do it again at his coming
[1:58:40] they would do the same thing
[1:58:42] that's the reason that Pharaoh drowned
[1:58:43] it in the sea he never recognized his
[1:58:46] day
[1:58:48] he never recognized what was going on
[1:58:51] he was too tuck up in the achievements
[1:58:54] of his scientific age to build cities
[1:58:58] with slave labor
[1:59:00] he was too he was too busy to recognize
[1:59:04] the opportunity that he had
[1:59:07] and he turned God's Prophet messenger
[1:59:09] out into the wilderness
[1:59:12] didn't recognize it
[1:59:14] that's the reason that if things went
[1:59:16] the way they did
[1:59:17] he never recognized it if he would have
[1:59:20] only recognized the promised word of God
[1:59:22] to that people
[1:59:24] and if the church is today would only
[1:59:27] recognize
[1:59:30] if the churches would only recognize the
[1:59:34] word of God
[1:59:35] that's made this promise for this hour
[1:59:38] to the people
[1:59:41] they wouldn't perish
[1:59:42] if America could only recognize the
[1:59:45] Constitution as she brought up
[1:59:48] she wouldn't be willing to take Bibles
[1:59:50] out of the schools
[1:59:52] take the name of God off of coins and
[1:59:55] pledge allegiance under God
[1:59:58] but she doesn't realize it wow
[2:00:07] ah the blood of those precious boys has
[2:00:09] died on the fields for this privilege
[2:00:12] they're forgotten
[2:00:14] their dust
[2:00:16] but there's one who does remember
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:19] the shed of the blood of the prophets
[2:00:23] the cost that had taken to bring this
[2:00:26] gospel to us today
[2:00:27] now the thousands have been eaten by
[2:00:29] lions have thrown into the dens have
[2:00:31] been solder sundered burnt crucified
[2:00:36] God Rest in the house he said the church
[2:00:38] has forgot their Prophets
[2:00:40] don't need them anymore they claim
[2:00:43] but God knows he's got to Heaven he uses
[2:00:47] people by his word
[2:00:49] but it's too old-fashioned to them in
[2:00:51] this day
[2:00:52] they don't recognize it that's reason
[2:00:55] they're in the condition they are that's
[2:00:57] the reason they're naked miserable blind
[2:01:00] ratchet
[2:01:02] don't know it because they don't
[2:01:03] recognize the hour that we're living
[2:01:06] they don't notice it Moses he recognized
[2:01:10] his day and his calling when he saw the
[2:01:12] promise of God's word for that day
[2:01:14] Vindicated
[2:01:17] he knew then and realized what he was
[2:01:20] and what he's to do by the promised word
[2:01:22] so he didn't fear what anybody said
[2:01:26] he wasn't ashamed of his message whoever
[2:01:29] priesthood ever payroll everything ever
[2:01:31] Authority disagreed with him
[2:01:34] but he recognized when he saw that light
[2:01:38] that Pillar of Fire
[2:01:40] hang in that bush I spoke to him the
[2:01:44] word that was promised for that day
[2:01:47] and said I've called you to go do it
[2:01:49] he feared not the
[2:01:51] the great threats of the king
[2:01:55] he went down to bring those people to an
[2:01:57] exodus
[2:01:58] like the word of God had promised
[2:02:01] see the promised indicated he made the
[2:02:04] people ready for their Exodus when when
[2:02:09] he saw the promise of God Vindicated
[2:02:12] remember he ran with his theology
[2:02:16] he ran with his with his training
[2:02:19] but when he saw the word of God made
[2:02:22] manifest
[2:02:23] he saw it Vindicated
[2:02:26] I am that I am
[2:02:29] then he didn't care what anybody said he
[2:02:33] didn't fear what Pharaoh would do with
[2:02:34] him he didn't fear what the rest of them
[2:02:37] would do he only feared God that he
[2:02:41] might misunderstand God or some way that
[2:02:45] he might misunderstand God he didn't
[2:02:47] fear the people and what they would say
[2:02:49] or what they would do he only feared God
[2:02:53] after he recognized that it was the word
[2:02:57] of God he couldn't understand how a man
[2:02:59] like him would be sent down there
[2:03:02] but when he recognized by the Vindicated
[2:03:04] word what it was then he didn't fear the
[2:03:06] king's Commandments
[2:03:09] if you'd only recognize if we today can
[2:03:12] only recognize Moses recognizing when he
[2:03:15] seen the word Vindicated seeing the
[2:03:17] Vindication made prove he was ready for
[2:03:19] the Exodus for the people
[2:03:25] it's called recognizing its day in its
[2:03:28] message
[2:03:30] it's very
[2:03:32] straightforward message I hope that
[2:03:36] you
[2:03:38] understood what the messenger is saying
[2:03:42] and you know I uh you have to understand

[2:03:54] share with you what I feel God puts on
