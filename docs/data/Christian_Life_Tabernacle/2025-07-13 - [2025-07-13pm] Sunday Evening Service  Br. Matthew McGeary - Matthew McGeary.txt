We'll ask sister Sarah to come with her special and right after we'll have sister. I see him. When the night comes, when you're all alone, when there's trouble, stirring in your soul. And if your world is falling apart, just hold on for the morning breaks to dawn. Come and lay your burdens down. to the place where freom is found. At the feet, at the feet of Jesus, come and lay your burden still. Deepest sorrow weighs on your heart. When you've prayed for answers, but the answers haven't come for every tear that you cry. There's a promise. He will make your burdens of light. Come and lay your burdens down to the place where freom is found. At the feet, at the feet of Jesus. Come and lay your burdens down.

Why don't you lay your burdens down? Come and lay your burdens down. So many times I question certain circumstances and things I could not understand. Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand. It's then I am reminded I've never been forsaken. I've never had to stand a test alone. And when I look at all the victories, the spirit rises up in me. And it's through the fire my weakness is made strong. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. The heat said hell would always come in time. So just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary is gi. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. I know within myself that I will surely perish if I trust the hand of God. He'll shield the flame again. again. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. So just remember when we're standing in the valley of decision and the adversaries gi. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. So just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversaries say G. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. Hallelujah. Isn't it a comfort to know he never lets you go alone, &gt;&gt; but he always comes with you? Hallelujah. We don't have any new written requests. We want to remember the ones that were spoken this morning and remember to keep Brother Billy in prayer as he was out ministering that he come back to us safely. If you have a need upon your heart and you want to make it known to the Lord by the uplifting of your hands, do so and know he sees and there's an answer coming for you. If the brothers that are taking the tithes and offerings would come up. Brother Caleb Miles, if you want to come up and pray for these Let's go to the Lord. Father, we love you so much, Lord Jesus. You're everything to us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. just Lord thinking of the prophet Lord whenever the man came up to him Lord in the prayer line and he reminded him reminded him of his dad started sizing up his shoes and sizing up his coat and wanted to give it to him he didn't have any shoes on Lord Jesus Lord that's that's the love we have for one another Lord God, Lord, the the request, Lord, that were brought before the desk this morning and all the needs, Lord Jesus. You know, of the local body, Lord God. Lord, you said I'd never leave you and never forsake you, Lord. You know everything before we even bring them to you, Lord God. For our footsteps are ordered by you, Lord Jesus. Lord, as sons and daughters, we just claim the blood, Lord God, for healing, for salvation, Lord Jesus. Lord, I pray that you just meet every need in the service tonight, Lord God. Bless the tithes and the offerings, Lord God. May they go for your glory, Lord Jesus. I pray that you just be with the rest of the service, Lord God. And may we may our hearts just praise you, Lord God, for all the things that you have done for us, oh God. We just love you, Lord. Lord, we just put everything in your hands. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's sing this song as Sister Bian and Sister Kaylee come with their special. Oh, heing is here. Healing is here. Oh, healing is here and I receive it. Oh, he is here. Healing is here. Healing is here. I believe in. And so I reach my hands to the heavens. I lift my mind where my help comes from. My look to you. You are my rock, my healer. I trust in you. I reach my hands. I reached my hands to the heavens. Lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you. You are my rock, my healer. Trust in you. What do you say to feels like they've lost it all? over the edge with no one there to break their fall. And what do you say to someone who feels so unloved and giving themselves away a little bit every day just to be good enough? And what do you say to a hopeless soul who can't remember their way home? And everything is out of their control. There is no valley, there is no darkness, there is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus. There is no moment. There is no distance. There is no heartbreak. He can't take you through. &gt;&gt; So before you think that you're too lost to save, remember there is nothing greater than grace. What do you say to someone whose life is on the line and they're unsure what happens after their last breath? What do you say to someone who's only known abuse when the walls they built to save themselves makes it hard to hear the truth? And what do you say to a life of regret that's trying so hard to forget? And what do you say to dreams unmet? That there is no valley, there is no darkness, there is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus. There is no moment. There is no distance. There is no heartbreak. He can take it through. So before you think that you're too lost to save, remember there is nothing greater than grace. &gt;&gt; There is no valley. There is no darkness. There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus. There is no moment. There is no distance. There is no heartbreak. He can't take it through. So before you think that you're too lost to save. So before you think that you're too lost to save, remember there is nothing greater than grace. Remember there is nothing greater than grace. Let's all stand. You are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. You are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. Oh, you deserve the glory. Invite brother Matt at this time. Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we praise your holy name. You deserve the glory and the honor. Oh, and Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we praise your holy name. You are the great. You do miracles over. There is no one else like you. Oh, and there is no one else like you. You are great. You do miracles. So great. There is no one else like you. There is no darkness. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just sing that again. You deserve the glory. You deserve the glory and the honor. Glory worship as we praise your holy name. You deserve the glory. We offer glory. We lift our hands in as we praise your holy name. You are great. You do miracles. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. Oh, and you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one &gt;&gt; for you are great like you. Oh for you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah Lord. None like you. There is no for you are great. You do miracle so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else &gt;&gt; like you. Let's go before him, Lord Jesus. We certainly declare there's none like you, &gt;&gt; Lord. And it'll take an eternity just to begin to know you. And how we thank you, Lord, for looking out over our lives and bringing us to this moment in time tonight. Lord, I believe we stand in a predestinated moment that you have ordained that we would be gathered together. You would come by our way, Lord, and speak words of life. For you said the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, they are life. So we not do not look to a man this evening, but we look to your divine promise that you are gathered here with us, Lord, and that you could come and just move us aside, Lord, and anoint the the speaker and the hearer. that you could just have your perfect will and way. Lord, we would bind the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ that would try to hinder the moving of your Holy Spirit and the revelation that you would want to bring to your believing children this evening. Lord, we know that he's like a roaring lion seeking and whom he would de devour. But he is defeated for you defeated him on Calvary, Lord. And our faith is looking to your word, to the divine promises that you have given to us. And by that faith, Lord, we can quench every fiery dart of the enemy. We are not a powerless church, but we are the very empowered bride of Jesus Christ by thine own spirit in the last days, Lord. So, we're thankful to be standing in this moment. And I look with great expectation for what you would have for your people tonight. We ask these blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And if you have your Bibles, let's just turn to Psalms 27 or uh um let's turn to 1 Corinthians 15. We'll just see how the Lord will lead. Uh praise God. 1 Corinthians 15 and 51. How's everybody feeling this evening? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan tried to stop you, but he couldn't. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of y'all didn't want to come back tonight. Your bed was feeling too good and I'll just stream. But something else said, "You know what? &gt;&gt; You old bag of bones. I'm going to church." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you made it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. 51 would read, "Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, that's that's shouting grounds right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for the trump it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory." Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We pray a blessing on the reading of the word. You may be seated. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, I'm just I'm just waiting for launching power. So, &gt;&gt; you know, uh I really appreciated the words that we heard &gt;&gt; uh this morning. You know, there ought to be a a church standing um on the face of this earth with the message that we have received where uh it's that there's a works and a life that is following the word that we've heard. Amen. And Romans 8:11 would say, "But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you." And I I just like this quote and we actually read this last time we ministered and thought we would just maybe find some launching ground from here in Easter Seal uh paragraph 109. He said, "And when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him, God recognizes our repentance and our faith toward him." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And sends down the abstract. And the abstract is the assurance. &gt;&gt; It's the guarantee that everything that was ever held against you, you thoroughly repented. Hallelujah. and the property is boughten and you hold the abstract for the assurance. Let somebody try to put you off the land, say he belongs and and with the abstract in your hand, let them try to do it. There ain't no law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract. Hallelujah. Do you have an abstract tonight? Something that says I got it right. And there's no devil, no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and abstract that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized us in Jesus Christ. We're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him. Amen. The old things, what does it do to our mortal bodies? It turns our opinions, changes our notions. It sets our affections on things which are above and and the smoking and the drinking and the gambling and the things you used to do is dead and it's beneath you and you are quickened and the quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already. Oh, I just love that so much. I I believe that is a promise and a quote right there that you can whoop the devil with because the quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already. I'm so glad that the quickening power changes the way you act. It changes the way you talk. It it changes your ideas and your opinions and the and the things you wanted to do and the things you used to do. And and sometimes we we need to just look to that quickening power into the word of God because many times the old flesh man wants to try to reassert itself and try to discourage you and pull you one way to the other, one way to the next and say, "Hey, I'm not going to go to church tonight. I'm just going to I'm just going to sit back and stream a little bit." You know, but I like it when you say, "You know what? I'd rather be found in the house of God on a Sunday night. I I'd rather be obedient to the word and to the prophet when he says if the doors are open, there's something in your heart that wants to be there. I'm so glad that there's a quickening power that can bring your body under subjection to the power of almighty God and to the power of the word that we're not just left to man's opinions and man's uh efforts and ideas that will always fail. I mean, how many times have we started out to achieve something and you thought you'd be a better Christian and I'm going to get the overcoming power and I won't do this anymore and and and I'll set a pattern of good works. You know, if it ain't for the quickening power of God, you'll find yourself falling to the same snares and to the same traps and you'll think, I I finally got this under control and and and I got I finally got what I what I've been looking for. And you'll find yourself coming to a condition or a situation and you'll fall to that same thing again. that that shouldn't discourage you, but let it encourage you that there is more quickening power for the believer that you can be so surrendered to that you can have overcoming power in every situation. I don't care where you're from, in your private life, in your work, in your car, at your home, with your family, in your job, in the church, in the church parking lot. Sometimes we need more overcoming power right outside here in front of the church, you know, cuz it's those that you love that can hurt you the most and and those of your own household that can get under your skin. But you got to find some real love and faith to to go along with it and pray and be long-suffering. Amen. We need quickening power to quicken our mind and and our thoughts and our actions, you know, to quicken the way that we think and and to quicken us in how we handle our time. Redeeming the time. Amen. Hey, I say it takes some quickening power to redeem the time as we see the day approaching. So many of us are given over to so many things that don't do anything to further the kingdom of God. We just feed the flesh. We just uh listen to all these other nonsense and things and we're not giving over to prayer. We're not giving into praying for revelation. We're not studying the word. We're not looking into the message. I don't know you, but the the bride of Christ should be feeding every day on this word. You ought to be listening to the prophet every day. You ought to be reading your Bible. You ought to be praying. I want to tell you, there ain't nothing else to live for. I've lived for the world. It ain't worth living for. I've lived to to pay the bills. I've lived to do those things and all those things are going to burn. They're all going to perish away. I I don't care. You can get all enthused about something. But I tell you, it's all going to burn. But there's one thing. If you can ever get excited about the word of God and start catching a revelation of what this message really is, I want to tell you, it's worth living for. It's worth dying for. It's worth giving all your time and attention. It's worth pouring yourself into it, lifting it up, studying it out, and getting a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's where the quickening power is. It lays within this word. It's a real quickening power. It's a real life, you know, and and I I just something that's been on my heart in in the rapture. Brother Brandham says, "Faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't." So look, faith puts you into action. And faith also has a voice. If anything's contrary to the word, it calls it as though it is not. Look, look, faith has a voice. Are you Are you hearing me tonight? Faith has a voice that can actually speak the word and call things that are not as though they are. Look, you might sound like a fanatic. You might sound like a crazy man. And absolutely Abraham sounded like a crazy man because all of the things of your senses and reasoning and touch, taste, see, and felt, all of those things declared to Abraham, to his neighbors, to the doctors, to his wife, to his brothers, to his sisters. There's no way that you're going to have a baby. But something had been revealed to Abraham. Oh, he faith was a revelation that declared another reality. Faith declares another reality than the very one that you're seeing with your own eyeballs. &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word, it's not. So, &gt;&gt; Satan, you're a liar. &gt;&gt; God gave me the promise. &gt;&gt; And it says it calls those things that are not Hey, sometimes you got to start calling it what it is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. The promise has a voice. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just got to start speaking the word. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to believe. It's like, you know, some of us just need to take take the promise that you received and go into action and start speaking it. Start talking about it. Start meditating on it. Start praying about it. Start telling your neighbors about it. Start telling your family about it. Hey, I'm going to have a Well, you say you believe. Well, get excited about it. If you believe it, declare it. Faith put you into action. Amen. You know, as we heard this morning, what kind of Christian should we be? Show me your faith. &gt;&gt; You can claim to be something. And I want to say there's been a lot of claims made. A lot of people make a lot of claims. They, you know, a lot of people have claimed the world's going to end at this time and the world's going to end that time. What does it do? The date comes and it goes. There's been a lot of men raise up and try to be some great eighth messenger, you know, and what do they do? They crash and burn and they hit the ditch and and many if the Lord carries many more will rise up. We let they'll all crash and burn. Many men make claims. &gt;&gt; Many men have claimed to be some some big messenger or some big thing. But you know what? If it's contrary to the word, I say leave it alone. Faith has works. Abra, brother Random said Abraham's works was expressing his faith he had in God's promise. What was he doing? He was getting ready. He was testifying. And we are of the faith of Abraham. &gt;&gt; We call anything contrary to the word as though it was. &gt;&gt; So what the promise is our reality. &gt;&gt; Look, this ain't just uh talk. &gt;&gt; I've heard a lot of people run their mouth and they're all talk. You know, they got some worldly expression that says, "Put your money where your mouth is." &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people run their mouth and they talk a big game, but when when it comes to show what you really believe, they show their colors. &gt;&gt; There there's been a lot of people run their mouth, you know. I I mean, there there's been a lot of people that would run their mouth about the prophet, about the message, &gt;&gt; you know, but when it came down to a showdown, well, where were they? They they knew that that that the prophet had something more than they had. And I have something to say about this little movement that sparked up in the last 10 or 15 years, you know, starting to uh uh uh this this nonsense. I don't even want to name it because they shouldn't invoke much of our time. But I tell you what, what a bunch of cowards want to try to wait so many years and and so many witness. I tell you what, if you'd opened your mouth 20, 30 years ago, you had a litany of witness that said, "I was there. I was in the meeting. He called my name. He told me about my wife. He told me about my condition." You want to try to call him a fake. You want to try to tell him he's a false prophet when he discerned the very thoughts and intents of my heart. Oh, there would have been thousands of voices that would have been coming say, "Hey, you that you want to try to stand." But what do they do? They wait until there's just maybe, oh, maybe three or four left, &gt;&gt; bunch of cowards, &gt;&gt; but you know, I shouldn't get, you know, I don't want to get too much into that because, you know, it's harvest time. It's manifesting time. Look, everybody got to be what God made them or what what seed they are. So, you know, let let the unbeliever be an unbeliever. Let the makeel believer be a be a be a makebeliever. But I say, why don't we let the bride be the bride? Why why don't you be what God made you? I I think you ain't you ain't you ain't beholden to nobody. You ain't got to impress nobody. You ain't you ain't here to prove nothing to nobody else but just prove your love to the Lord Jesus Christ. And recognize that he called me and he wrote my name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And I am going in a rapture and I'm going to follow this message with all of my heart. I'm going to pray and I'm going to continue to serve him with everything I have. Look, you we what what do we ain't trying to to to to prove something to everybody else that we got something more than them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That just causes carnal impersonations and workups and buildups and things that just crash and burn. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when you got a secret life and a hidden life, &gt;&gt; when you're in Psalms 27, you're in the secret place. Come on, y'all help me preach tonight. I don't I mean, hey, y'all, it's up to y'all if we're going to preach or not. So, why don't we just have church? We're here, right? &gt;&gt; We can be short or long. The the the harder you pull, the shorter we'll be. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I I I've heard people run their mouth, but you know, uh uh this this there's a lot of people that say they're Christians and they say they're believers, but their life declares something completely different. They they have no ability to meet the challenge of the age. They have they have no ability to live an overcoming life. that I ain't talking about being able to abstain from certain things, but I'm talking about being able to meet the challenge of the age. And I want to say the challenge of the age is rapture. The challenge of the age is to believe every word that was spoken by Malachi 4:5. Many people can come up so far. Many people could say amen to justification, sanctification, the restoration of the gifts. Many people can say amen to Malachi 4:5 and God sent a prophet. But just as Jesus said, unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you'll have no life. tell you, you have no part of me. I tell you, there is a bride that will say amen to every word that was spoken by Malachi 4:5. I will not back up. I will not compromise. I will not give it over to say it was just an opinion or I can take a little here and take a little there. Look, every word I say, hey, hallelujah. I believe it all. &gt;&gt; And as you receive the word, you become the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I just was thinking about that. How he would stand there hh night night after night after night and prove that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday, today, and forever. Opening blind eyes. People being raised off of CS and stretchers, discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. Oh, that many people come and they enjoyed those things. And when he brought the word, even men would testify over out of their own mouths like, "Well, he got off at the end. He got off the word." No, they just got off from following a vindicated prophet. And he would stand there and declare just as Jesus said, "Search the scriptures. In them you think you have eternal life, and they are they that testify of me." &gt;&gt; I say you know them by their fruits. Jesus said in Matthew 7:19, "Every tree that bringeth forth not good fruits is heuned down and cast into the fire." &gt;&gt; Wherefore, by their fruits you shall know them. &gt;&gt; I say we ought to possess some love. Right? We ought to have some faith. &gt;&gt; We should have some works. I'm afraid some of us relegate our works to just Wednesday and Sunday, you know? I mean, hey, I'm I'm a good Christian on Sunday and uh I I go to church on Wednesday, but what about your everyday life? What kingdom are you living for? &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you living for yourself? That that that that's that's a good place to start right there. A lot of us are just living for ourselves. A lot of us are just selfish, you know, trying to pay the bills, you know, trying trying to trying to make a living. But where's that leadership? Where where's that hunger for revelation? Where's that Lord? What would you have me to do? Lord, is there something in the church? Is there somebody I can pray for? Is there a burden that I can carry? Not something some big uh uh to-d do where everybody can say, "Oh, look at me." But something maybe in humility and meekness and a total surrender. Lord, is there something that I can do for your kingdom? He says, "And not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven." Oh, I love that. Just as we heard this morning, you know, where there is no vision, the people perish. I'm so glad that the bride has received a revelation from a vindicated prophet which is your vision which reveals to you the will of God for your life. I look I am not sitting around here and wondering what the will of God is for my life. Now, sometimes I know you come to to crossroads and certain things and you you might be wondering, well, should I live here or or should I go there or or should I go to that church, you know, and and maybe you come to those decisions, but and that's all right. We have to come to those places and learn to grow and follow the leadership of the Lord. And sometimes we just need to learn how to sit and and stand still. And I I say that's where a lot of us get ourselves in trouble is we don't really know how to just sit and be still. You know, if God led you and and God's placed you, well, then uh be, you know, you're content in that state until he continues to lead you. You know, there so many times we're we're looking for some other answer. We're looking for some other way when when I tell you what, if you just be faithful with what was given you, God would continue to lead and guide you into all truth and righteousness. And sometimes we haven't even been faithful with what God's given us. And we're looking for something bigger and better. And it's like, you haven't even been faithful with what I've given you. You want a bigger house and a bigger car. You can't even keep what you got. You can't even be thankful for what you got. I mean, I tell you what, we ought to be so thankful for the very things that God has given us. I I would say if anybody on the face of this earth should be thankful. It should be the bride of Christ. We should be so thankful for our church. We'd be so so thankful for our brothers and sisters, I say there ought to be an outpouring of thanksgiving in our heart for the message of the hour and the things that you ought to be so thankful. &gt;&gt; Hey, there's a lot of people that are way better than me and do a lot more works than I could ever do. So, you can't compete with some of the the lives given to to to to to uh uh the works out in the bushes and things like that. And and some of them on that day say, Lord, have I not done all these things? And what will he declare unto him? Depart from me, you workers of iniquity, for I never knew you. Oh, but to think that God knew you so much that he wrote your name on the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. and he came calling your name and pulled you up out of the muck and mire. I say there ought to be a thanksgiving out outpouring out of your heart, a love and thanksgiving to God every single day. There ought to be praises and a thanksgiving going up to God. &gt;&gt; Why do I got to go to church? Why do I, you know, why? Why is this happening to me? Quit your whining. Quit your complaining. Should I say it again? &gt;&gt; I tell you, we're talking about revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation changes everything. &gt;&gt; I say it changes everything. When you start to catch a revelation &gt;&gt; that we are going in a rapture, &gt;&gt; when we start catching a revelation that he is Jehovah &gt;&gt; Gyra, &gt;&gt; he is my provider. That the word he he's able to provide for himself. Look, as long as I take him at his word and I stay with that word, if he gave the promise, God is able to provide for himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many will say on that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? In thy name cast out devils, and in my name have we not done many wonderful works, and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from you that work iniquity. I like how we heard this this morning in in in the tape. Brother Brandham said, "The word measures them up." They can't cross every single word of it. You know, they're always going to come to some portion to where they say, "Well, I don't know about it." And you still see that today with the people the way they might live their life or the or the little things that they hold on to. They're declaring. You know, I I believe all of it. But you sometimes you get to know somebody, you might wonder and you come up to something and you find out like, "Oh my, they don't believe that." Like my I I thought they were a believer. Oh, hold on. Don't don't. But sometimes, you know, when God reveals something to you and you see it so plain in the word of God and you come up and somebody just totally rejects that in your heart, it vexes your spirit say, "Oh God, may you help them open their eyes. They they can't see that laying right there." And yet their life is declaring, "Yeah, I believe I believe 95% of it. I believe 99% of Oh, but there is a bride that believes 100% in all the word." And they don't just believe it, they will manifest it. Amen. &gt;&gt; This This ain't a hope so gospel. This ain't a fairy tale gospel. This ain't some h a pie in the sky. Well, you know, we can close here soon. Let's find a way find a place to close. My sheep hear my voice and they follow me. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people heard the word. &gt;&gt; A lot of people started with the word. My Bible tells me it's he who endures to the end. &gt;&gt; I don't want to tell you. You think it's hard now, just stick around a little while. &gt;&gt; I I I I ain't going to tell you this ain't going to get any easier. &gt;&gt; And and it has to get harder. It has to get worse. And you better know that you know that you know. &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes you come into hard trials and hard situations and you realize, you know, I really didn't have what I thought I had. But I say, let it be the grace of God letting you know, son, you really don't got what you thought you had. You you tried to work it up. You tried to make it happen. And then you fell back down. But oh son, I've given you a promise regardless of your faults and regardless of your failures. There is a quickening power that can bring the promise into manifestation. &gt;&gt; Not just put it off in something in the future. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people are just waiting for an event. &gt;&gt; They're just they're just waiting for some squeeze to come. that they're waiting for some ecumenical force or oh you know hey I got a quote for it brother Random said look look a national force put Israel in the homeland but he said it'll be the power of God that puts the bride &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; it's not some outside force but what is it revelation the rapture is a revelation &gt;&gt; oh it changes you quickens you my sheep hear my voice and Hey, y'all know that scripture. My sheep hear my voice and they All right. If y'all haven't heard that scripture before, it goes, "My sheep hear my voice and they follow me." &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice and they follow me. &gt;&gt; A lot of people here, &gt;&gt; but now I'm talking about following Are you following the pillar of fire? &gt;&gt; Are you following the message of the hour? Brother Brandham says in perseverance and the whole armor of God is faith, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience. The whole armor of the believers is faith. We believe God by faith because God said so then what is it? Abraham was justified by Paul by faith, but by James by works. Abraham was talking what God saw and James was talking what man saw. Show me your faiths by your works without your works and so forth. See, then if you don't have works with your faith, it shows you haven't got faith. &gt;&gt; You're just talking from your mouth. &gt;&gt; Hey, I've been guilty of it. I've done a lot of talking with my mouth. I I I've talked the quotes and and I thought I kind of knew a little something. You get to talking to somebody a little bit about it and ask a little question. All a sudden you I really don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But you know there's some type of pressure like we got to be know-it- alls. I got to have a I got to have an answer for everything. Brother Brandham said you find a man that got the answer to everything. Watch out for that guy. &gt;&gt; But sometimes, you know, I don't care what it is. It could be some fundamental doctrine and somebody asked you the question like, you know, I really don't know. I believe it, but I'd like to know more. &gt;&gt; I'd have a lot of respect for that. I've asked some people some questions and things. They like, well, doesn't mean this, this, and this, and this, or that. I'm like, you know what? No. Well, you know, let's see what the prophet said about it. I like that we don't have works with your faith. It shows you haven't got faith. You're just talking from your mouth. But if you really got faith, you believe it and act like it. &gt;&gt; It puts you in action. Look friends, we have an absolute. &gt;&gt; I tell you, we have an absolute. Anything contrary to it. &gt;&gt; Look, we we have an absolute. You know what an absolute is? I mean, it's absolute. I don't know how else to say it. It's an absolute. &gt;&gt; When you have an absolute, and I want to tell you that this message, I can't even believe it. It struck me funny. I I don't did you know there's actually in some some circles that there's some debate or some there has to be a conversation about the me they they don't want to accept the message as their absolute. &gt;&gt; It's just because they don't have a revelation of what it is. &gt;&gt; Like if you got to like do a walk around &gt;&gt; like where hey the message is my absolute. Well, you know &gt;&gt; what what are you what are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; Like are you kidding me? What? I'm not trying to say anything. &gt;&gt; I ain't got a thought coming. I'm just trying to, you know, &gt;&gt; there was a deep call into a deep and a deep respond to it. It changed my life. It It pulled me up out of the muck of my I was going one direction and the quickening power come and snatched me from death under life. And now I'm following the pillar of fire and I'm following into my health. I'm following into my body change. I'm bringing my family into it, those that are around me into it. I'm walking in truth. I'm walking in righteous. I'm going in a rapture. I'm marching onward Christian soldier because I have an absolute and it's thus sayeth the Lord. Heavens and earth will pass away. But this absolute of Jesus Christ, the revelation of the age will never pass away. I'm talking about an absolute. &gt;&gt; It cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; There ain't no demon. There ain't no no devil. There ain't no theology. There ain't no church. There ain't no man. I'm talking about an absolute. I'm talking about a King of Kings. I'm talking about the Lord of Lords. He's the Lord of glory. Who is the Lord mighty and bad? That's my absolute sir. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, are you talking about a man? &gt;&gt; What? Have you not been reading and listening, &gt;&gt; theologians? &gt;&gt; Well, my absolute the Bible, friend, &gt;&gt; you don't even know what that says. &gt;&gt; Hey, you might as well call me a fanatic right now. You don't even know the truth of this Bible until you recognize a vindicated prophet. Thus say the Lord that took a closed book &gt;&gt; that we were probing at and wondering where I came from, where am I going, what are the truth, what's laying under those seals. But then the mighty angel come down veiling himself in the form of a man opening the seven seals and the voice of God thundering out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's an absolute. &gt;&gt; They just don't even know what they're talking about. &gt;&gt; See, that's the problem. Everybody thought they were following a man named Moses &gt;&gt; cuz they can see the flesh. You might be able to see this flesh, too. &gt;&gt; They can see the humanity. Oh, I want to preach a sermon called the humanity and the vision. Because God can speak a vision. And thus sayeth the Lord can be thundering out. But you know what's all wrapped up in the vision? A lot of humanity, &gt;&gt; a lot of flesh, &gt;&gt; and what you know what? Bless Aaron and Miam. Cuz their brother was thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I have come down. And how did he come down? Going in the form of a man. And Moses had become so common. &gt;&gt; And how could Moses not be common to Aaron and Mary &gt;&gt; where it got so close they forgot? &gt;&gt; You know, we could go into it where where I it's failing me now, but you know, they they got to thinking they had something to do with it, &gt;&gt; you know. You know, I mean, hey, we got a lot we we We got something to say here too. You know what happened? Pill of fire dropped out of the sky said, "Aaron and Mo Mariam, come here." Um, you know, uh, yeah, there there's a gift of of prophecy, you know, where my spirit will move upon somebody and they'll prophet, but your brother, my servant Moses, that ain't it ain't that kind of prophet. No, he's the kind of prophet that I speak lip to ear. &gt;&gt; So then the words that coming out of the vessel &gt;&gt; is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; But there's so much humanity in it. They just thought they following some man. And everybody starts to complain, hey Moses, have you brought us out here to die? You know, is that why you brought us out here? and and they're totally blind. Somehow I just, you know, everybody gots to play their part because in all of that there was two predestinated seeds. But in all of that, can you imagine seeing all the signs and all the wonders a and miracle after miracle after miracle performed? And you would think uh you would think by signs and think about the church world, right? Here come God veiling himself in a man proving that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Taking a people in an exodus, right? Look, we're coming out of the church ages. We're going into the bride age. We're going into rapture. Look, I am who I said I am. If you don't believe my words, believe the words. They testify of who I am. &gt;&gt; Around the world, seven times vindicated, showing forth, discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. Just like Moses coming out, you would think they'd say, "Man, I tell you what, Egypt was the most mighty nation in all the world." But God is leading us out of here in our prophet Moses. &gt;&gt; But how quickly did things get a little, you know, come to come to the Red Sea like, "Hey, Moses, did you bring us out here to die?" You know, he even got Moses in such a place that Moses started to to to cry about it. That's where brother Brandon preaches that whole message. Why cry? Speak. Moses was anointed for the job. He was gifted for the job. And God's telling Moses, "Look, Moses, what are you doing? Why are you crying? can go forward. Why? Because it was God veiling himself in a man. We don't have to wonder. We don't have to cry. I'm not wondering where I'm going. I'm not wondering if this message will fail or if it'll work. I have a revelation. Look, I I am not like Ananas and Safire. I don't got a backup plan. &gt;&gt; I I ain't sitting over here, you know, and and I'm I'm 90% message and 10% open. I'm not 99% this is thus sayith the Lord and 1% just in case it doesn't work. &gt;&gt; I got no backup plan. I'm all in. &gt;&gt; All my eggs are in one basket. I'm going where this message takes me. And I'll be frank. I don't want to go anywhere it's not going. &gt;&gt; It's my ticket out of here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's my salvation. It's my Holy Ghost. I'm talking about an absolute. &gt;&gt; We got an absolute. &gt;&gt; And everything else is absolutely dead. &gt;&gt; Everything else is absolutely fake. Everything else is absolutely hybrid. Everything else is absolutely man-made. Everything else is absolutely going to be burned. Everything else is absolutely going to be left. But if this message is your absolute, you are absolutely going in a rapture. You will absolutely be healed. You will absolutely be changed. You are absolutely be victorious. You are absolutely receive every promise that God has given you. I'm talking about an absolute. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got an absolute. I had some absolutes in the world. And they absolutely failed me. They were absolutely a joke. Matter of fact, devil, you're a joke. &gt;&gt; You are absolutely a joke. You ain't got nothing. And God gots it all. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Show me your faith. &gt;&gt; I mean, at least act like you believe the message. You know, at least I can give people, you know, I mean, some of these people, I mean, they're anointed by devils, but, you know, &gt;&gt; they ain't afraid to talk about it. &gt;&gt; There's people that will come out in public and declare to you that a man can have a baby. &gt;&gt; And we ain't got enough guts to say, "God sent a prophet." Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; You heard me. &gt;&gt; We got people out there that'll go out and and and and workplaces create safe environments. &gt;&gt; I say they ought to they shouldn't be safe from you. &gt;&gt; You ought to be a walking talking Bible. &gt;&gt; You ought to be the Holy Ghost on two feet. They ought to know about it. &gt;&gt; Hey, all I'm saying put God first. &gt;&gt; Hey, put I I forget I forget how he says it, but the prophet says he's mighty and healing. You got to see him in battle. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of a fight. &gt;&gt; You kidding me? I got a big brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, one time I got me in a little squabble right down here at the Oaks Apartments right here. caddy corner right there, you know. And I remember the guy's name. He was bigger than me, you know, and and and I come up the stairs one time and and he said, "Come on up here." You know, I want to show you something. And I came up the stairs and and there was a rope in a circle. He goes, "You know, stand on over that circle." And I stood in the circle. And he pulled it tight and he dragged me down the stair. I'm talking about, "Hey, these weren't carpet stairs. These these old outdoor Hey, the stairs are still there. I'll take you over and show him." He dragged me straight down the whole thing down to the bottom. This guy was bigger than me and I was hurting and I was aching and I was in pain and he said, "What are you going to do about it?" And I thought, you know, I'mma go get my brother. So, you know what I did? I went back over to Mccur over there and I said, "Hey, hey, hey, man. This guy's picking on me." And you know what my brother did? He said, "All right, I'll go over there." My brother showed up. My My brother wasn't as big as I thought he was. This guy was bigger than me, bigger than him. But you know what my brother did? He fought for me. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I was his little brother. &gt;&gt; And you know what? That might mean my big brother in the flesh, but we got a bigger brother. &gt;&gt; You know, one thing I like about that story, my brother went to fighting. We kind of teamed up on that guy a little bit. But I tell you what, we got a big brother and his name is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be afraid of a fight. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be afraid of a battle. &gt;&gt; You got to be Are you kidding me? You You come to me with your armor and you come to me with your sword and you come to me declaring your Philistine gods. But I come unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I will cut your head off, Goliath. &gt;&gt; What did David have? a revelation. &gt;&gt; He was ascending to the throne and there wasn't no giant. There wasn't no devil. There was nothing that could stop the promised word of the prophet from coming to pass. &gt;&gt; He had an absolute. Well, come on. &gt;&gt; You got an absolute. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, give us revelation tonight. that could put us into action &gt;&gt; that'll make us not afraid to declare this message. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you got friends that you associate with and you hang out with and you have not told them that God sent a prophet, I challenge you in the name of the Lord, let it out. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, I ain't trying to just tell you to, you know, you we want to use wisdom and discernment, and I'm not trying to I'm trying to encourage you in a way that if you love someone, ask the Lord to open the door. If you're not looking for the opport it's going to be gone &gt;&gt; and there's going to come a day they'll look at you and say, "Why didn't you tell me?" I thought we were friends. &gt;&gt; You said you loved me and you knew. &gt;&gt; I say, "God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. I'm preaching to myself. Lord, help me. Let my faith go into action. Let me speak this message. Let me witness. Let me declare it. There there's power in revelation. &gt;&gt; Well, you're not following that. See, they all they could see was the humanity. You're following a man. Far from it. &gt;&gt; Far from it. But you know the whole thing like the answer, so close but so far away. &gt;&gt; Because when God veils himself, what he's hidden in simplicity and that humility and that meekness. Oh, but when you can look past the veil and see none other, that is Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever, and you say, you know what? I have an absolute. I have a vision. I'm not wondering where I'm going. I'm not wondering if I'm going to make may make it or I Why? Because I have an absolute. And look, in this message is everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; What? Why? I don't know. You got a need here tonight. Somebody got a need. I I don't care whatever that need is. The answer lays within God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the revealed word of the hour by a vindicated prophet brings forth the word that can meet the challenge that you're going through and answer any questions that you have. &gt;&gt; Say, what do you got need of? What is faith? Faith comes by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing the word. &gt;&gt; Not a word from another age. &gt;&gt; Noah's message won't work. Moses message won't work. It has to be the message for the day that we are now living in. &gt;&gt; This message packs the revelation of everything that you have need of. We just find a quick place to close. But we know the scripture says, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." Brother Brandham said that's where the church fail today is by disbelieving God's word. &gt;&gt; Right? That's that's where they all fail because what God's word come by divine promise and was manifested and they failed to believe it. Many can come up so far. Many can come to water baptism. Many can uh uh uh accept serpent seed. Me many many many people can can come so far. But I you know where they can't come is recognizing the headship to the age. Come on. &gt;&gt; When it comes to recognizing Malachi 4:5 is the fulfillment that the the the ministry of William Brandham is the fulfillment of scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it goes from a feel-good story to a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Because now now it brings it now it's decision time. You see, you realize that just oh my, it was just so beautiful because just as in the days of Jesus, if Jesus was who he said he was, that meant all of their that all of the Sadducees, Pharisees, and the high priest had no more jobs. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's over. &gt;&gt; Playing church is over. &gt;&gt; The the the the the the all the money-making schemes is over. &gt;&gt; All of our position over. Why? Because the Messiah is here. &gt;&gt; And when Malachi 4:5 showed up, what did it mean? It meant playing church is over. &gt;&gt; All the personalities and all the workups and and all the pool and the the flash and the pan and the healing and the oil and and all of the signs and nonsense. The bride would never go playing. Church was over. The bride wants one thing and that's the word. &gt;&gt; And sure, signs and signs and wonders follow that word. &gt;&gt; But we know the devil can impersonate it all. &gt;&gt; There's one quote, brother Brandham says that that uh Janice and Jambers impersonated every gift up to the death angel. That threw my brain for a warp. What? one side he's saying what he was speaking flies into the create you know frogs and lice and all these things and here Janice and jammers are imitate how' they do that I don't know I just know &gt;&gt; it happened how do you know it happened well I got an absolute &gt;&gt; call me absolutely crazy but I'm absolutely going in a rapture &gt;&gt; come on it's I think it's time we we get just as crazy as Abraham &gt;&gt; you know I don't know yall talking about rapture? Are y'all talking about body change? You talking about the message? I don't know. What do you What do you spend your time talking about? If if we sat down and said, "Hey, what's the five things on your list you want to talk about? I mean, what do you want to talk about? Let's sit down for one hour. What do you want to talk about?" Now, I I would want to give you the opportunity to share what's on your heart, but I love to talk about this message. I love to talk about this word. &gt;&gt; You know what? I think we ought to have leaving on our mind. &gt;&gt; I think we ought to have going home on our mind. I think we ought to have lost souls on our mind. I think we should have revelation on our mind. &gt;&gt; Because we're a people, we don't disbelieve one word. That's where the church failed is disbelieving one word. But the prophet of God, we'll just call for the musicians. We'll find a place to you know what? Hold it. I I don't I'm not going to do that to you again. &gt;&gt; When you come up, I want you to start playing right away when you hit that piano. So, just give me one moment, sister. I I' I've y'all for y'all I ask for forgiveness for that. I've left our musicians sitting up there too long and and I know I'm wrong for that. So, you forgive me. Let me try to I just uh work this towards a close quickly. Brother Brandham says and Jehovah Gyrus I've been listening to. says, "But in this case, to the royal seed called predestinated to eternal life, the royal seed of Abraham, they believe that word. I don't care what comes or goes, how much they laugh, who says this, that, or the other, they are ordained to eternal life." And she goes right straight back. Her and her lover, Christ is one, the life. The spirit that's in Christ is in the church. That's their eternal covenant. Look, I don't care what comes or goes. I don't know. I don't know what you're going through, but I don't care how bad it gets. &gt;&gt; What? What is he saying? Look, I don't care what comes or go, how much they laugh. Look, are they going to laugh? They're going to laugh. Are they going to make fun of you? They're going to make fun of you. And I tell you what, I think you ought to be putting yourself in position to be laughed at. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but some of us never put ourselves into position. It's like that boy that went to the camp. Honey, when they find out you're a Christian, they're really going to give you a hard time. What happened when he got back? Say, "Oh, uh, honey, how'd it go?" "Oh, he went fine." Really? What' they do when they found out you're a Christian? Oh, mom, they never found out. Come on. I say some of us ought to be getting some boldness in the day of judgment to declare the message of the hour because I tell you, faith has works. It declares to the people around you that you are not of this world. Look, when mo when Abraham went to expressing his faith by his works. It was what man saw. Are you hearing what he's saying? James is saying the works, the works we have. Man ought to be seeing our works. It ought to be declaring there's an absolute and another hope than what the world has. But if we're just blended in, where's your works? Where's your faith? And if you don't have it, faith is dead. But there ought to be something welling up in you that says, "Look, I don't care what comes or what goes. They might make fun of me. They might laugh at me." What What did Brother Brandon say? They They laughed at him and said, "Oh, oh, you meant Josephine." They laughed at him. They made fun of him. But he had a revelation. And because he had a revelation, he declared to the public. &gt;&gt; He was going to have a son and his name was Joseph. &gt;&gt; Now, when that child came along and it wasn't Joseph, he didn't sit back and say, "Oh, I guess that wasn't God. Oh, maybe it is Josephine. No, he had a revelation. Brother Brand said, "I don't care." They laugh and they scorn, but I couldn't find it in the Bible, but he said it was written on my heart. &gt;&gt; I I want to tell you, this message ought to be written on your heart. &gt;&gt; Rapture ought to be written on your heart. Leaving here ought to be written on your heart. Finding lost souls should be written on your heart. fighting for your brothers and sisters should be written on your heart because it's a revelation. &gt;&gt; It ought to be something just belching forth out of your life. I tell you, when you've met them, &gt;&gt; uh when you've experienced it, you look at others and you want them to have what you've experienced. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in that message we heard this morning, he says, "You don't stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but you give praise to God." Know that it's got to happen. I don't care what the doctor says. Everything else will come in in all kind of way. But don't you believe it. It's a lie of the devil. Yes, sir. It's true. I'm in raptured condition already. &gt;&gt; Hey, the doctor looks at me. He don't think I'm in raptured condition. Maybe my brothers and sisters don't think I'm in raptured condition. But my absolute said, my absolute told me because I got the quickening power, I'm in raptured condition already. &gt;&gt; Well, that makes me happy. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I can't miss it. &gt;&gt; I am going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for an event. &gt;&gt; Now, I know we'll meet him in the air. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen. I I I I can't tell you what the third pull will be, but I know what it is right now. &gt;&gt; So many people want to argue and debate about what it will be. I guess I'll find out. &gt;&gt; Look, if if there's going to be a tent one day, I guess I'll be a part I'll be there. Trust me, I'll be there. Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, but but everybody puts their hope in something, some interpretation. &gt;&gt; Some workup, some hope, and totally miss what we got right now. &gt;&gt; When a prophet tells me, I'm in rapture condition already. I don't have to necessarily look for an event. That's exactly what Mary and Martha were doing. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I know that I know that in the resurrection, my brother will rise. &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus have to tell her? I am the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're walking with Jehovah, you're walking with the rapture. &gt;&gt; I I am the rapt. You're looking at the rapture. Why? Because the rapture is in me. I'm in raptured condition already. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brother Brandham said this in Jehovah Gyra. He said, the question was, where is the seed you promised me? Talk about Abraham. How am I going to be it? The people are laughing at me saying, Abraham, the father of nations, been 15 years now. Now you're 85 years old. Where where where where is all your children at? How many children you got now, father of nations? See, making fun of him. But he staggered not. He stayed right with it. Made fun. Said, "Father of nations, now let's see how many children do you have this time?" Wanting to make fun because he was holding to God's promises, believing that he was able to keep that which he promised. He's more than able. He can provide his own sacrifice. He is Jehovah Gyra. He can provide and make way for what he promised. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say if anything, the very message that we have received, if you're wondering how, right here, he's Jehovah Gyra, he can provide and make a way for what he promised. It ain't going to be something you muster up. It ain't going to be something you work up. God will make a way for the promise. &gt;&gt; Look, he's making a way for the body change. He's making a way for all these things. All as I know, as long as I stay with the word, if I walk with the word, if I stay with the absolute, then when the need arises, when the time comes, I'll step right into the manifestation of the promise because God is more than able. &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto me unto the father but by me. I want to tell you outside of Christ. Outside of the message of the hour is nothing but confusion, &gt;&gt; darkness, chaos, man's opinions, disappointments, &gt;&gt; false hopes just lead you on so long you think so and then before you know it, you're looking for something. Have anybody ever been there? You're from one hope to another hope, but that's all that's out there. It's just gross darkness. And you know, I was I was ministering on that little dew drop. You know how brother Brandon says it was just formed in the night time, you know, and there there that little dew drop. It was it was formed there a in the night. And he says, "But as the sun starts to come up, as that sun starts to come up, it starts to shake. It it starts to glisten and it starts to shine and it starts to get happy. You say you little goo, why are you getting happy? Why are you getting excited? He say, why? Because you see that up there? It's declaring that I'm going back to where I came from. Now, just before service, I got to thinking about that little dew drop and and and and I I I looked this up and I thought, you know what? What causes that dew drop to go back? And and I just like this. You know what? It says heat. As the sun rises, the temperature of the air and surfaces on which de has formed increases. This heat provides the water molecules in the due drop with more kinetic energy energy causing them to move faster. I like that because you know eternity is just a little faster dimension. &gt;&gt; But this is this really got me. He said he said now what causes the dew drop? It's it's evaporation which means when water molecules on the surface of the dew drop gain enough energy they overcome the intermolecular forces holding them in a liquid state and escape into the air as a water vapor. This process is called evaporation. I got to thinking hallelujah I'm evaporating. I am evaporating. Why? Because the sun is up. The prophet of God said, "But just let the sun come up. Watch it go to shining. It's happy." Why? The sun is going to call it right back where it came from. &gt;&gt; That's the way with the Christian. Hallelujah. We know when we walk into the presence of God, something in us tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back again by that power that's pulling us. The little dew drop, he glistens and he shines and he shouts because he knows he comes from up there. And that son is going to draw him right back up again. And a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows, hallelujah, when he comes in contact with the son of God, he is going to be drawled up from here someday. For if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me. Oh, praise God. I want to tell you, the sun is up. The sun is shining. Uh, what a resurrection that was. But what a resurrection this is. The sun is up. What is it declaring? I'm going back to where I came from. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The musicians would come. I want to sing that song. Uh, Speak to the Mountain. Church world has denominated and died and there's been personalities and movements. They've come and gone. But, Brother Brandham said in words of faith express, he said, "But oh God, they denominated. They went right back out to take man's ideas. Therefore now when the bride is being called as you've promised in in the scriptures reading it before the world night out night after night and we watch it with our own eyes God may it dissolve all the doubts in the people's heart may they fe flee quickly to the open sun to be ripened to be taken into the garner not be left in the stalk to be burned but may they go to the garner tonight I love how our pastor was laying in there he's a dissolver of doubt That word means to destroy, just to disintegrate. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said in in uh the greatest battle ever fought. He said, "Lust don't get a 22." God has an atomic bomb &gt;&gt; called faith. &gt;&gt; He said it disintegrates. It annihilates devils left and right. &gt;&gt; He said it destroys and disintegrates. I say, why don't you just let the Lord come and anoint your faith, dissolve all the doubt and all the unbelief that you can go into action. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'll leave you with this and maybe we can pick up on this sometime somehow. Brother Brandham says, he says, "You say, 'Is is that right, Brother Brandham? Then why does it on some and not on others?" He said, "It's because of the channel. You can look out and see it, but you've got to have it in here looking this way, not out there looking in. You got to be looking out. Friends, if we're always looking as the message as something we're trying to achieve, oh, I got to be this. A and we're always we're we're looking like that eagle that flew over the barnyard. If we're always just in the barnyard looking up, but no, that eagle has to come in you. And now it's Christ in me. making me what he wants me to be. &gt;&gt; Not that it's a challenge like I got to make something happen, but that he promised it. And now, Lord, I'm going to surrender to that word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get out of the way, Lord, and let you be in me what you want me to be. Not me try to be something on my own, but a total surrender. Would you like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go ahead and stand. The germ that was in you at the beginning found you. That's what this message did. Showing you who you really were from the very beginning. Amen. I want to just sing this song. Amen. Why should I worry when giants come calling my name? My God is so much bigger than the troubles I face. Why would I hope for power or riches or fame? Cuz my God is so much better than all of these things. So I won't be shen and I won't be. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountains. Oh, it's time to move. Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger, and greater than you. Oh, my enemies scatter. They know the battle's been fought. My God is stronger with me already. The king died my brother. My God is hell and the grave. I won't be shen or I won't be. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time. They just softly play that. I I just want to reemphasize this. Brother Brandon says it's because of the channel. You can look out and see it, but you've got to have it in here. Looking this way, not out there looking in. And I feel so many times as believers, we're we're looking at this stature of a perfect man or we're looking at the sheath wave or a first one to maturity and we're we're always trying to catch up or oh, I see it and and I need to be it. And what the prophet was telling me, "No, son, you're you're you're not looking at it out there. You got to get that out here and here." &gt;&gt; Does that speak to you? &gt;&gt; And then when that comes in here, it'll start to change you. &gt;&gt; And then if you're you're you're doing something, you're like, "Oh Lord, help me. Father, &gt;&gt; change me." And I just thought maybe with every head bowed, maybe you feel like, you know what, that's exactly where I've been. I've been looking at the message. I I I've been looking at the Holy Ghost. I've been looking at the scriptures and and all of these things and I've I've been trying to manufacture or I've been trying to play catchup. I I've been trying to run after something and I can never catch it. And you're tired and you're wore out. tired of being up and down and in and out and you say, "Lord, I want what I see in this word to come into me, Lord. I I want you to come in. I just want to surrender Lord all everything to you Father where it's no longer me struggling and trying but it's me surrendering where I can start bearing wool not manu trying to manufacture I would just ask is there somebody here that you would want to lift up your hands say Lord I need what I see in this message in me I'm tired of trying to achieve it on my own God bless you maybe somebody you want the Holy Ghost and you want to lift your hand say God I need the Holy Ghost, I need some I need something more than I got. I say, "Oh, God, I need something more than I got." Lord, I I Lord, I I I want I want these works to be manifested in my life, Lord. God bless you. Hands that are just raised everywhere. I say, "Why? Why don't you just invite God to where you're at? Why don't you let God just deal with you in a supernatural way?" I just I feel impressed in my heart that as this prophet said, it's because of the channel. You you can see it out here. But now I say, "Oh God, let that revelation of the message now come in me." &gt;&gt; Just as he said at that day, that's this day. You'll know that I am in the father and the father in me. When the revelation of this message comes forth, then it's I and you and you and me. You're no longer struggling. You're no longer wondering why. Because you're now in a union with the word. And the Lord just deal with your heart. God bless each one of you that's lifted your hands, Lord Jesus. Lord, as we just bring this service to a close, Father, you see the many hands that have been lifted, Father. We've just tried to maybe bring a scripture or some quotes, Lord. maybe not knowing all of how or where what would be done, but Lord, I just pray something that has been said. Lord, I know that you're able to to take a broken up message, Lord, and just take a portion of it and feed your children. Lord, I pray that your word would just become such a reality to your children, Lord, that their works would start declaring their faith. Lord, you see the faith, but man sees the works. So Lord, may we be a total surrendered vessel. Lord, I just feel in my spirit you're doing something very special for somebody right now, Lord. Lord, I pray that there just be a full surrender right now and a total bornagain experience. Lord, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're not a God of frustration. You're not a God that leaves us wondering and guessing. But Lord, you make things so plain. Lord, you make things so clear that even when our own carnal mind would not understand, Lord, there's a revelation of faith that anchors down to know it's thus sayaith the Lord. Lord, I just pray that you would bring that revelation to somebody here right now. Lord, for we know the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to the individual. Lord, I'm so thankful you're still calling. Lord, that there's people that still have a desire to serve you. Maybe right now the devil's trying to tell somebody they've crossed the line and they've tried too many times. Lord, we know that devil's a liar. The very fact that they have a desire for the Holy Ghost proves that it's you and them calling out to your word and for the Holy Ghost to come. Father, I just commit them to you as we sing this song in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I won't be shen. I won't be moved. Our God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time to pray. &gt;&gt; I like this song. So help me learn. Sing the first verse. Amen. &gt;&gt; My God is so much fear in the trouble that I will honor power which is your name. My God is so much better than all the things. So I won't be shy. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So our streets and mountains for each time. Our God is bigger, better, stronger, gater. &gt;&gt; Amen. God before you. &gt;&gt; Who can be against you? &gt;&gt; I mean, just think how wonderful it is. I really like that. what the prophet said, Matthew brought up that you've got to look at it from the inside. &gt;&gt; So, it's not something out there that you're trying to grab a hold of. It's something that's in you &gt;&gt; by seed. &gt;&gt; Can you understand that? &gt;&gt; The revelation that God gave you was the seed. You were the bedding ground. And when that seed came in, it's in the same book that he read out of of the works his faith expressed. He said that seed comes into the bedding ground and then it's got a place to grow and you grow in to faith. You know, none of us started out as giants. You know, I I I thought I had more faith when I was a young preacher &gt;&gt; than I do now, but I now I know I have to rely on him &gt;&gt; more than ever. And that seed and the prophet of God said every gift, every fruit that's ever in that tree &gt;&gt; was in that seed. And I just thought as Matthew preached, he talked about all the power that the believer has to overcome. And I thought about Moses with that stick in his hand to go down, take over Egypt. And I I thought of the Lord, how that he could spoke anything. And then I thought about our prophet messenger pro probably the three most powerful men that were ever on the face of the earth. And you want to know the most amazing thing about him? Moses was the meakest of all men. Jesus and was was was so I can't express it just full full of love and caring and brother Brandham how humble that he was &gt;&gt; and and that nature and I thought you know that that's the only way we're ever going to get across to this world what it is that the revelation that we have was when we can approach this world with the character and love of Jesus Christ in our heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because remember, your actions speak louder than your words. And and I I just you know, you know, at the end of that tape, I don't want to keep you any longer, but that part of the tape we listened to this morning where brother Ram said, "If you do the works of mount, if Jesus did the things that said about him that were spoken, then it must have been him." And then he said, "Now ma, you know, if if it says the angels would come and they came and and and he said Malachi 4 and he was here and he he said all those things. And you know what he did right after that? He turned his back to the audience. He discerned he he called out and discern the thoughts that he had. He put on total display everything that he he did right there in Jack Moore's church in Shreveport, Louisiana. And he just said they just can't believe the message. &gt;&gt; But you did, didn't you? &gt;&gt; If that isn't the love of God, &gt;&gt; I don't know what the love of God is. &gt;&gt; Why he ever chose me? How did he choose you? Why? How out of the whole world did he pick you? &gt;&gt; Because he loved you first. &gt;&gt; And then you could just be so grateful. If you got believing parents, you ought to be grateful. &gt;&gt; You know, if if you're if your parents love this message, you ought to be so happy and you ought to be thankful that God did it. and and and I I really honestly believe what's going to strike this world and this hour is when there's a people that have that character cuz power apart from character is satanic. You're not going to move anybody until that love of God is shed abroad in your heart &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. So you we've we have it. &gt;&gt; It's ours now. We just need to get the revelation of it and believe because I think God's fixing to move. And that's your personal relationship with Jesus Christ. As Matthew said there, he said the ev the Holy Ghost is the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you. It's a personal revelation that God gives you. And God leaves his church by divine revelation. Let's stay humble, church. Let's let's share with all humility and meekness of spirit and loneliness of heart all that we have in humility. And and watch the world respond. The world is tired of being yelled at. They're wanting people that'll lend a helping hand. You know, today we're at the restaurant and there's a little group of Pentecostal uh Spanish brothers and sisters came in and my heart was just a thumping, you know, cuz they were dressed right, you know, and they loved one another and just a little group and and but we helped them. I don't know where Michael's at. Yeah, we I don't know if he's here, but we helped take their dishes, their trays to the table and everything and you know, and I finally just stood up and they're missing. I said, you know, I appreciate you. Don't let the world come in and and and keep keep holy and keep your dresses and don't cut your hair and don't start putting on makeup. And I didn't even go to their church, you know what I mean? But they was amen because people are hungry, &gt;&gt; church. They're starving, hungry for what you have. And I encourage you to take the encouragement from tonight. Don't be afraid to speak it. You know, even our messenger said, "God can do nothing for you till you confess it first." So, I think we're on we're heading down the right road. We're We're heading down the right road. Let the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. Amen. You believe that with all your brother Jay, would you come dismiss us in prayer tonight? Heavenly Father, we just Lord, it's good to be in your presence this evening, Lord. And Lord, just to feel your spirit come by, Lord. And just touch, Lord, the areas that we need, Lord. Lord, we just we're we're desperate for you, Lord, to just be manifested in our lives, Lord. And Lord, we're desperate for a change, Lord Jesus. Lord, a change that is a permanent change, Lord. Not a moment, Lord, but Lord, that something that is, Lord, evident to our family members, Lord, that aren't here, Lord, or our friends, Lord, that we come in contact with, Lord. And Lord, we just want to be still, Lord, and be in your presence, Lord. And just ask that you would, Lord, just come seal that word in our hearts, Lord. As the prophet said, Lord, let your word be written on our hearts, Lord. And Lord, we just ask for your spirit, Lord, just to take control, Lord, of everything in our heart, our minds, Lord. And Lord, just lead us and guide us, Lord. every step, Lord. Lord, we just we we need that, Lord, more than anything right now. Lord, and we just ask that you would strengthen us, Lord. each one, the ministers, Lord, the the church members, Lord, and just ask that you would go with us this evening, Lord, beyond these four walls, Lord Jesus, Lord, to wherever we may go, Lord, to work, to school, Lord, our homes, Lord. Just ask that, Lord, you'd be with us, Lord Jesus. We just want to thank you Lord and just ask that you would Lord just bless each one this evening in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Have a great week. Huh? Tell somebody that you love them. Tell somebody that Jesus loves them. Amen. Let your light so shine amongst men that your good works will glorify your father in heaven. I like this song. So let's sing this as our dismissal song. I won't be shaken. I won't be moved. Amen. So I won't be shen. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. I'll speak to this mountain. Oh, it's time to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger than you. fighting for heavy scatter cuz they know the battle is done. &gt;&gt; Oh my God is stronger. The victory already won. &gt;&gt; You died my rose up on the earth. Oh my God is gater. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord. I won't be shen. My God is faithful. His promise is true to you. So I'll sing to the mountain. Yes. Oh, it's time to do our God is better. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Love one another. Go in peace. Are you close?
