Description:
A Call To Put On A Rapture
Br. Michael Rae
November Meetings
November 11, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

better already amen but bu is speci special if he could come at this time amen God bless you so I had told John earlier that I was going to sing a certain song and then I walked into church and God put another song in my heart so he's been thinking about that song but I got another one uh this is probably like weirdest week I've had I'm not the type of person that loses things this is a short testimony but uh Sunday night after communion service had a lot of stuff in my hands was walking up the stairs to go and sleep and I guess I forgot to lock my car and uh I didn't go to work Monday morning cuz I was trying to get this cough off of me and I go downstairs around 8 I think and my car door is open my stuff's outside my glove compartment's open like it looked like somebody went in there and had fun napkins everywhere papers everywhere they stole a air compressor for my tire um some other stuff that wasn't important the air compressor I missed but you know that's okay and then um that Tuesday I lose my wallet I'm I'm like okay something's something's up and then but luckily I found it cuz I remember the last time I knew I had it so it was easy to find and then uh two days ago I lost my car keys and I stopped working I told my B I said um I don't have my keys so he calls all the shuttles that we have and ask everybody to check so they stopped working to find my keys so about an hour and a half I spent checking all the cars that I took from dispatch up which is about 30 something cars checked every single one of them didn't find it I finally got to the last one I said God either it's here or it's in my pocket whether it's in this car in my pocket one or the other those are the options I'm giving you and I open the car door and I know if I look under the seat and I don't find it that ends the search so I don't look there I look where I know it's not so I looked in the passenger seat I looked in the back I looked in the trunk I looked everywhere and then I finally got to this year I said Lord please just please let it be here and I looked down disappointment it wasn't there so I'm like Lord what is this and then that's so I got down I started praying I said God I need my keys I got to get home and so somehow and my boss tells me check your car now I knew it wasn't in my car cuz I was late to work that morning and I went downstairs I remember vividly stopping at the stairs and turning off my car and hearing it beep twice I'm like okay yeah I'm good so I run downstairs so I knew I had it he says go and check your car maybe it's in there I said it's not in there I know it's not in there he said go and check you so I walked to my car and someone tells me your door's open I said no it can't be the door opens and then I look in a spot where I never put my keys it's sitting right there in between two things just sitting there I said wow what placement I says so I just want to sing this song Because Lord knows how to speak in ways that I wouldn't prefer but he speaks anyhow y'all help me sing it Lord I come to you let my heart be changed reew fallowing from the gra that I found in [Music] you Lord I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me

and we come in that name The Wonderful Name of Jesus amen amen God bless you may be seated wonderful to be in the house of the Lord and be in the battle amen and uh he certainly uh he knows how to fight and you know what happens when you meet somebody that knows how to fight fight you go learn to fight I was a little fella I still am a little fella but I was a real little little little fella and all through until the summer between my eighth grade year and my ninth grade year I grew six Ines and put on about 50 pounds and uh I used to get beat up a lot but I beat up a lot of people that summer because all of a sudden I felt like King Kong you know and Satan uh he's been beating my body but every time he beats me I purpose in my heart to destroy him someplace else amen so I I'm hoping I can go steal some Souls out of his grasp amen I can get people delivered from some of the sicknesses that he imposes you know we're not the enemy he's the enemy amen and if someone offends you it wasn't them that offended you it's like brother Murphy said there was a voice in them that's right that was speaking that really wasn't their voice and uh and that's with it purpose in my heart I'd like to read a little scripture uh found in St John and been the uh theme that's been on my heart for uh this meeting and uh if you read it it's a simple scripture but it really caused me to stir deep inside and it said says let your let not your heart be troubled amen you've believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many men itions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also he says and whether I go ye know and the way ye know and Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and that struck me very much and it became the theme in my heart for the meetings is show us the way you know they knew he said you know the way but they didn't you know and I know Thomas he takes a lot of heat but you know he went on to bring the gospel all through the area of India and and and all down through that part of the world and because he was full of that Zeal that we heard about last night that jealousy for the gospel um I I notice that every time there's great confusion and how many would agree that the world's confused and there there things start to rise up and and uh divisions come in and separations come in and and we've had great events great leaders great people that are part of this message that have left the scene uh great the great voices of this hour have been silenced one by one the people that knew our messenger and and walked with them there's very few left and it press me so much in my spirit to ask the Lord I say Lord we need to know the way which way do you want us to go what path do you want us to take what what light do you want us to shine what is it that you want us to stand for and represent and you when you have people around you uh that were there you find out that you lean on them you know you have that thing you could always call this brother or talk to that brother I always felt that way with my dad if I ever had a business problem or electrical problem or I just knew he was there and one day he wasn't and I realized that I had to start walking and I think that time it is for all of us to realize that there's a place that's been prepared for us and we need to start finding the way there and what it is that God would have us to do on that way and I just didn't want him to speak to the individual a lot of times we ask God to speak to us individually speak to the individually deal with the heart but my particular desire for this meeting was that he would speak to us as a church as a body not something to go out and find maybe individual problems or weaknesses or sicknesses but that we we are a body you know what I mean and we're part of a body and we're fitted and joined together and God has called us from all parts of the earth and all places and assembled us here and and brought us together the ones that he's brought together here and he did that work why we don't know but that's what we want to know Lord what are we here for show us the way what what do we want to be as as a body for years we've we've grown and and and little by little by little family by Family Birth by birth we've grown but it it you come to the time where if I could just say this you're big enough to fight you know what I mean you're big enough to have an impact you're big enough to do something if everybody comes together and we could find the way that God wants us to go the vision that God wants us to have not the vision of another place and and and not the uh work that somebody else is doing but that God would find what is the work that you would have for our body to do what light do you want us to show in this place this 6 million 7 million people that are starting to surround this area people are pouring in here there's 400 and some people a day move to this city and and there's there hardly a voice out there anymore that's willing to stand for the truth and if there's ever a time that we need to come together and to find a divine purpose and a Divine reason that each of us plays and what it is that we're bringing to this area and I I thought brother Murphy last night is really begin to touch on that I thought it was miraculous he said the first thing we all need to do is become more zealous and more jealous over this message there's no reason for us to hold our peace we've got the greatest word that's ever been spoken we we we have we have a truth now that explained what's going on more than anybody else can ever explain we've got prophecies after prophecies after prophecies that are coming to pass every minute surrounding us we got Israel in a war we've got a government that's selling our morals down the two and we have Americans and people coming from all over the world and they don't know where to go they don't know the way but he said you know the way amen and so it it behooves us to to stand back and say wait a minute Lord what is that way Thomas said we don't know the way show us the way where are you going and I think when we begin to sum this up in our heart and we begin to really start getting to the place that we start joining ourselves one to another for the cause of this message to stand for this message like we've never stood for it before you know they want to make it a curse to say God sent a prophet but you know something God sent a prophet that's the truth and he had the word of life for this age he had the pathway for this age he had the way for this age there was there's no escape from this world without the guidance of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 it's not that people are evil it's that they don't know the way and I I I trust that you will let this services not only speak to you individually as a member of the body but it would also speak to you to the fact that you're fitted and joined together with the rest of the body we preach so much on individuality that we have no Unity we preach so much on our own way and and our own responsibility that we fail to understand that we have responsibility to one another and I'm I'm the worst I I think if anybody needs Improvement on that I do but I'm asking the Lord Lord make me a part of the way show show me the way where do you want us as a body we're going to have a new building by the grace of the Lord if he comes before that thank you Jesus yeah even so come quickly Lord Jesus but if he doesn't then I I don't want to if there's an empty seat I want to fill it up with a lost soul that's right I want us just to become a lighthouse everybody out there with the same Zeal the same fire the same jealousy that our brother spoke about the other night that Burning Flame within us that and he he gave examples of people you know brother Roger came to me he said you know Brother David he said that statistic that the government gives is a million people being killed in Rwanda he said I was there I watched the dead bodies I I took 150 kids out of the army and brought them to safety he said the reality of the real number was more like 4 million genocides and things are happening all over the world men are losing their mind but there should be a people that have the mind of Christ that's right and if if if you if you could see that this is an assembly of people from everywhere and every one of you is important and nobody can take your place and there's no big eyes and there are no little you so in these meetings I'd ask you not only to look at where you stand individually with the Lord but ask yourself where do you stand in the body where do you stand in the church what labor are are you putting forth and what labor do we have as a body and thus my prayer when Thomas said he says how can we know the way we know the way by his word I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me let's seek and pray that the the Lord would not only show us the way as individuals but he'd show us the way as a church he'd show us the way of the body he would speak to our hearts and bring it deep into us in the part that we play and I think it'll be wonderful sorry brother Michael for that but I I I know that you can touch the high voltage line anytime you put your hand out so I'm certainly not taking any fire from you uh I it's it's been a privilege to to have uh uh brother Tom and sister Joanne and their three boys with us and their wives and the ray family and they've been a blessing to me uh and my family and it's been blessing so would would all of you stand up for us please this is the whole Ray family and not their children but there they are God bless brother Tom is uh brother boll's son-in-law and and brother Boll has uh you know he's he's uh he's been his years in the gospel and and no longer physically able to carry on the work and brother Tom's been carrying on that work as the Lord leads him so we're certainly grateful for that but you know brother Michael he he this is the first place he preached a a real sermon anybody can preach at home you know where you get cuddled you know and and everybody's there and Grandpa's there and Grandma's there and all the kids and everybody loves you but he I always think he cut his teeth right here you know and he came and preached for us and I'll never forget he was preaching and he was under the inspiration and and he grabbed a piece of paper and he curled it up like that and he he threw it up in the air and uh I went and got that piece of paper and I pinned it on the wall in my office and I called it inspiration well Mike I think one of my cleaners thought it was a piece of wrinkled paper I stuck on the wall but uh but to me it meant so much and I I saw a real man of God with a real gift because I saw the inspiration come down and take it over and that stirred my heart and I knew I found someone that could find the mind of God I hear a lot of preachers anybody can go to this message and put together a sermon it's not the knowledge that makes you a preacher it's the inspiration and the move of the Holy spirit amen and I saw that and my heart was endeared to him and and uh I knew he was going to give a lot up a lot of professional Pursuit and a lot of things in order to give his life to that and that meant much to me and then last time he came here how many remember the service about pre-venture shooting an arrow amen just putting your request up there pre-advent Venture it would find the Mark just the faith to to to put it that that so inspired me and I told myself I'm waiting for that Arrow to land amen so I I want to let you know it's a it's a real honor for me to have uh brother Michael Ray minister to us tonight as a body of Believers amen so as we prepare for the word let let Stand Together Billy give me a song to sing as [Music] we oh there to you may take one my son and one my f take the word of God oh what you see what is what you set

two services oh dear goodness wow but you were gracious you pulled and and you hold a real special spot in our heart and it's just a real pleasure to be here have the whole family here my as brother Murphy said last night the hospitality is uh Second To None it's good thing we don't have to weigh in before coming into Dallas because we'd be in trouble weighing out might have to call the airline company and say hey might adjust your payload or something because we're coming back it's been incredible wonderful time here but maybe tonight we'll spiritually dig in a little bit amen the natural food is wonderful but it's the spiritual food that gets us where we need to be which is eternity amen so why don't we turn to our scriptures tonight Matthew 22 is where we'll begin you've been singing and you've been worshiping and that's wonderful the Lord deserves all our praise may he give you strength tonight now to pull on the word you help me because I'm going to need it amen Matthew 22 very familiar Parable verse two it says the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage you can imagine as the servants went forth and they were conveying the earnestness and the the excitement of the king and here they were conveying this message come bid them it's all ready the the marriage Feast is prepared and but the verse five says but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm and another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and in treated them spitefully and slew them incredible but when the king heard thereof he was wroth understandably and sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which are bidden are not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king king came in to see the guests he saw there was a man or there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the King D's servants bid him bind him handed foot take him away and cast him into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord tonight Lord I know the heart of each one Hees Lord I want to be at that Feast I desire to be with the king of glory Lord in here it's even would seem unfathomable that the response of the invited ones that Lord even slew your servants that beckoned and called but Lord there's a group of people here tonight that are saying Lord we're hearing the call and we're responding Lord and maybe there's one tonight that needs to respond may this be their moment tonight Lord Lord as the king is still beckoning Lord these are words that you spoke Lord you spoke this Parable and Lord your word is eternal and so Lord that word still Goes Forth the call still goes forth so Lord May Lord your word Lord in Be Inspired tonight to your people may we receive it with open heart and Lord you would do your Mighty work tonight in your people we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you may have your seats tonight just going to read Isaiah 4 64 while you're you don't have to turn to it Isaiah 64 and I'll turn I'll try and tie these together but but but we are all an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away all our righteousness are as filthy rags and I want to speak on a little T subject tonight a call to put on His Garment or maybe a call to put on Rapture and just to speak a little bit about the the the subject here I feel a little bit like a uh uh I can imagine a racehorse at the gate as the gate's been just holding him back a little while and he's just quivering ready to go you know and I can just imagine his little muscles there just just ready for that gate to to smash open and and hit the hit the racetrack I kind of feel like that a little bit so I'm just going to try and hold myself back the gate is now open I'm just going to to try and walk out a little bit and then I'll run huh but that depends on you a little bit if you start pulling maybe I'll run faster or or sooner I should say but here we go but the scripture says a call in verse three the servants were sent forth and a call was that was made out there to bid them to the wedding you know and when a call comes from a dignitary you know generally that would create quite a large stir you know when a call Goes Forth you know to have a king said hey you want to come to my to my dinner or to my event of such and I know that everybody has their circle of of influences or maybe their circle of interests I should say that you know there's if someone called you from a maybe an area of Interest some of you maybe young men maybe it's sports or something of that nature uh maybe it's somebody that loves investing and you know Warren Buffett would call you to to the to come to have a one-on-one invitation to his table to give you the his investment mind and say I've got the the the uh the wisdom that if I can just sit with you I want you to come to my table and I'm going to give you what you need to succeed and be a billionaire like me I tell you you'd be like I'm there is it today tomorrow what what's the date marking in my calendar 18,000 reminders you'd have them set so that you wouldn't miss the moment e that's what You' be doing because you were called and you would want to make sure you're responding right and then you'd probably walk around for the next 3 weeks or however long it was and you'd be saying hey guess where I'm going I'm got a personal invite with Warren Buffett he's going to give me what I need to be a billionaire oh and you'd go to the next person you say hey just in case you didn't know and you'd be like I heard it 1,800 times you're going to see Warren buff you're like yeah that's exactly where I'm going because you'd be so excited because he's called you to give you what he needs now do you sisters that probably means Zippo to you but pick a person write the name down and say if they called me I bet you you'd be responding right but I'd say tonight is just as we open up the service but our Briand says the people say he says the people that's got the Holy Spirit they say he they brag too much about it he said we can't brag enough about it it's something to curl about you've been invited to a feast it's something to curl about he says we've been invited to a wedding supper of the Son of God it's worth walking on the street testifying telling every creature you come in contact with what a good thing it is that you're invited to a wedding supper amen he said God Almighty has selected you from the slums of the earth to attend the supper of his beloved Son oh what an invitation it w in buffet pales in contrast what an invitation he said it's worth a 100 billion president suppers to attend that come on a 100 billion that's a whole lot of President suppers to attend maybe you don't want to attend your president's supper per se but maybe if it was Lincoln or something like that or George Washington right well you know if you had that opportunity you'd probably you know fuss and make sure you're all looking just perfect you know you got the right attire on the the suit and tie whatever you need to be in just to make sure that you're prepared to attend the banquet amen amen and that's what we're talking tonight but you know if you got the call let's just run down with the Warren Buffett this morning or this evening maybe somebody pick you know name who who's like a big you know who's your football star here okay no no football stars here if somebody special to you called you and it rung up on your phone or May and maybe you had no you've never they've never never phoned you before and it came up you're like well I have no idea what that number is you know I wonder would you you know ah don't know who that is I I'll just you know maybe come back to it a little later and you miss the call and they leave a voicemail like yeah sorry you know uh we're just trying to call you but we're going to move on to the next person person you missed your opportunity to the call to sit down maybe at this personal one-on-one opportunity you'd be pretty disappointed you'd be pretty disappointed but you know we get so many scam calls and unknown numbers you have know what it is and so you just kind of Let It Go by my goodness I get you know it's like H you know send a voicemail ever done that before like yeah send a voicemail someone's calling but how do you not know that that's an important call right and so I wonder how many times when the important call comes to come to my banquet Christ is calling and saying hey I'm bidding you those ones that were rejecting he was bidding them if I want to bring it up to today's day he was calling them saying hey answer the phone I'm calling you and they're like yeah yeah no now don't need to take that call right now I'll send it later then he starts texting out hey uh you know send a text out to you in this current day and age and how many is texting back and forth and suddenly their buddy or whoever it is just it's gone like man I was talk I was texting with him like 10 seconds ago and it's just disappeared ghost yeah yeah who's ghosted somebody before yeah indeed but you were called and you didn't answer or you were in a communication and then you drop it you say wellow you call me back do you know how disappointing that would be if that's what you did to to a president or Warren Buffett or something like that and you're like yeah I'll get back to him later and it and it passed you by oh my goodness yeah let's just go there just just put your mind there if that was the case where you were but I'm far surpasses but brandham said the call to the to the to the wedding supper the one that is worth talking about we've been called by another one from another realm amen that's what that eagle scream was that was calling out that's beckoning you saying come to dinner come to this marriage Feast amen it was no phone call that you could miss because inside of you is a seed amen inside of you it's not that you well I missed my phone my battery died I couldn't take the call no no no there's a seed inside your soul that can't help but respond amen because when that message Goes Forth when the word was spoken something inside is saying wait a second something's speaking to me something's beckoning me it's you're unable to miss the call amen there you were as butter brown talks about that little Eagle scream or that little eaglet sitting there in the little farmyard how many knows the story so well you can lift your hands it's okay it's church have well done that's right this is just Saturday night amen we can just relax and man but we know the little story of the little Eagle as he's sitting in the barnyard I can imagine that little eaglet sitting there and the the den of the cluck you know and how terrible that have been as this little guy or I should say big guy is sitting there in the middle of all these chickens and they mo you know God there's no God or there's you know whether it's Trinity or this or Apple in the garden he's just looking and running around listening to all this B B B there in the chicken yard all his own thoughts on the matter of what they feel you know God means or this that and the other and he's just in this den of noise who is in a d of noise whether some denominational realm or whatever it was or in some World worldly system somewhere or whatever and just a whole bunch of noise that you were listening to but then here he was trying to peck on the ground and trying to sustain himself somewhere and there he'd peck on little worm and he'd seriously and he'd try and swallow what they're trying to throw down his throat spiritually speaking just something inside of him is rejecting it I can't swallow that I can't believe that there's three Gods there's no way it was an apple in the garden something was just that's just not right for me amen because you're an eagle something was crying out for more amen and so you're trying to choke down food are you kidding me there's no Miracles anymore there's nothing there's nothing God doesn't move on the scene anymore like this you can't be born again you can't be transformed that's just stuff of the past that's somewhere back in Acts but it's not today that's all that is but your little Eagle heart is saying I can't stomach that well sir but then something something caught your ear it was a call From Another Dimension amen he's saying come up a little higher come up a little up a little Bride come a little higher what was it you were hearing a screech you were hearing a call that was beckoning to something a little deeper than what the little chicken yard could give you right amen you say wow that's just a humble little sounding Prophet really could it really be something like that everybody just looks at the they look at the bad your skin but don't realize the voices you heard last night behind the voice that was screaming out to you come my little Bride come to this wedding supper but Brenham said he would not understand it no matter how he tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an eagle was cuz all he looked around was at chickens he had nothing to identify with well I I look different but no no you're just a chicken but I just don't we look different like I've got really big claws and you got little ones and I got a beak and you got a tiny one we're no no it's the same as us because he had no reference point to show him what he really was nothing has given a visual to say hey this is a he didn't he couldn't stand in front of the mirror no one else he stood there but no no one else he had nothing to say what an eagle was but then something started to fly something started to move in his realm maybe in a church service one day somewhere where God started to move and that little eag that big eagle mommy Eagle started to fly over that little Barnyard brother brandom says he would not understand it understood it until he seen something that reflected him he said then he that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a good neighbor but a Son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the request of this day amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he said ain't no hen going to hold you no sir he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with and he recognizes it imagine the first moment when he saw that Mama eagle and he's like wait a second that looks a lot like me she's got feet like me she's got big wings like me she's got a big beak like me that must be who I am that's where I came from oh my there there was a squabble in the chicken yard at that point in time I can imagine trying to tell him well you know no way there's there's no way you're just could stay down here with us but there was no way because when the chickens started to see the eagle I can imagine Eagle's like that's food that's right there that little Eagle was sitting in food all the time yeah Eagles could eat chickens clear the yard there's an enemy overhead eag's like what do you mean that's looks like me Hallelujah who says an enemy get undercover it's just a cult it's just we don't believe in prophets anymore this thing's going to kill you no sir this is going to give me life this is going to get me out of the chicken yard amen that depends on who you're where you're what seed inside of you amen as someone said many times you say well you called me a chicken someone I don't know over the years they say well I didn't hear no chicken they call me an eagle what are you what are you identifying with that's my reflection I see Eagle reflection yes sir yeah Hebrews 1 prophets are done and gone come on this is this you got to stick with the worms but once you taste a little bit once you get a little bit of Eagle food once you start feeding on the word of the hour you start receiving the message and the word you say you satisfied with what that barnyard could give you anymore Revelations 22 and the spirit and the bride say come is a call said let him that heareth say come and let him that a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely you mean you mean I got to leave all this behind I can imagine the Eagle's like well there ain't much here to leave I'm going to just start to fly but you know what he didn't know how to do that quite yet he'd never done that before he his wings he'd been held back all this time brother brandham says the invite went out call him to come and said just just me for a moment and here he said he's I'm calling you he's at the door he said he says I'm out here to give you a robe he says and you try to climb up your own moral stepladder or by some Creed or some church brother you're going to find yourself the same way referencing the robless one he said every man comes by the door is going to get the same robe and that robe is the baptism of the Holy Ghost every man pays the same price amen no man comes to me except the father draws him but I want my ear to be listening to the sound of the cry saying come are you a thirst come come to this marriage table amen he says that barard stuff didn't do him good nothing no more and he said all things are possible and he starts to get off the ground he said just jump a little bit you mean all I got to do is believe have faith all things are possible really is it that easy it's just that easy he said that's what's the matter so many Christians today they can't get their feet off the ground he said that old mom he said Son jump you're an eagle come up where I am you mean I just got to believe your word every word is it that hard and simple it's that simple just start to read just start to take it in just start to believe what I've said to you okay I'll he starts to jump that little Eagle start to jump a little more believe a little more read the scripture a little more and his wings start to move it wouldn't take too long for a big old Eagle to do about two flaps and you realize you've set your wings to The Winds of Faith you can fly in a higher Place amen he said M I never jumped in my life she said well you jump said well I've never really stepped out in faith like that before you jump yes you jump a little higher he gave you the word and you believe it now he says you're an eagle to begin with you're not a chicken so he made his first jump flopped his wings didn't Doo didn't do too good but he got off the ground am man it did not take too long after that where he was more than just off the ground but he started to fly because a call was going forth and he was drawn beckoned to a higher Place amen a seat of God daughter of God a Son of God they're going to be drawn by a call because a seed in your heart is drawing you into a higher place with him so we go into the scripture so many heard the call so many were beckoned but they've looked at the Garment of the word today and they're like yeah well I want to wear something different at Style just doesn't quite fit me in fact why do I even need a garment provid I'm just going to wear my own thing anyway and really they're saying my Rags are just fine he said who on Earth would say a thing like that that's insane I know because you're all believers Revelations 3:17 says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and no not that thou are wretched miserable poor and blind and naked no garment nothing I me it's a deceived age that we live in to the extent that their garment are so stained so tattered so wretched as the scripture says that it's nakedness to God and they don't even know it I thought you know what a mindset to believe that you're adorned and Fit For A King and to present yourself to to a King and knowingly Go a different way fully expecting as we just go into this Parable a little bit let just go down this way and then we'll go that way okay but this one went into the feast fully anticipating that all would go well that's that I can't expect that he went in there thinking that he was going to go to weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth I don't think anybody saying in the mind or thinking that they're saying would even do that but Mark says though that not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and many will say unto me in that day Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many works and I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity and so this one that went into this into the into the that Jesus is speaking of in the parable here he was a clear representation I would say of the make believer mentality because the unbeliever didn't even attend he didn't even show up to the feast he he called and he had other things to do and and the King went out and and dealt with them but the this one here he attended the feast but he had his own garment on he he had no intention of following the process here and so he he landed at the feast and it was going to basically make up his own his own way he knew there was a wedding Feast he had heard a call but he had his own thought and so here as a pre-wedding preparation this person could talk the talk he could fit in with the crowd because he knew there was a call but in his private life when no one was around there was his own idea and his own Concepts was very much abounding he knew that there was an invitation and maybe someone would say hey you going to the wedding you know the King has invited all of us yeah I'm going to the wedding do you have an invitation you know what I think I just left it at home and they they they could they could kind of talk and fit in a little bit into that conversation but when he got to the door or he didn't even get to presented to the door you can only you can only come in through the main door and so but you need to have your invitation because you got to go through the door you got to go through the right entrance yeah I know yeah know it's okay I'll make sure I have everything in order when I get there I mean it's not really urgent you know but in his mind he had no intention of going to the door everybody will be accepted I mean how can they deny me if I want to come in the way that I want to be because God loves everybody right there's a way there's a way my pages are uh make sure got them in order here I wonder what a bold spirit that would be to approach the king and his feast with my own idea and my own way my own clothing Concepts and the spirits today are so bold they're in your face they're rebellious they're they're they're they're pressing their idea in front of you what they what they think how they feel about it whe in whichever way whichever Sodom aspect of this world that we're dealing with it's a bold spirit that is pressing against but so is this one so bold to walk into the presence of the king's court the way he designed that religious spirit is worse as we know So Many religious people to face their own their own thoughts on their spirituality and what they would would feel even the message said you know there's you could go down that road at which I won't spend too much time but his own idea is what was manifesting and I can imagine he thought you know well you know I'll come but it's going to be in such a way that the Royal purpose will not be served but maybe rather hindered he knows he's coming in in a totally different clothing not the way that was being that was required and so you know I'm not really going to share in the ceremony per I'll be present but uh you know and maybe I won't even show maybe a whole lot of care for the business at hand but uh I'll just kind of do what serves my own purpose and so the man came full really full desire or full exercise of his own self-will and his self-love he resolved to yield no respect but to assert his independent self sovereignty said wow that's a whole lot of information about a man that just didn't take didn't have the wedding garment but you got to realize he didn't just get there and suddenly poof oh I'm here and I don't have the right garment there was a process to get there he had the opportunity to get there the right way he had to consciously figure out and wrestle through and whichever to go in a different way through the back door or through the window some way he had to premeditate this is how I'm doing this this and he would show up the king even at his own table where the king's bounties were so largely dispensed that he was not afraid to affront him and basy stand as an affront saying I don't need your rope I don't need your garment this is just as good as it's going to get that garment was intended to show that the wearer was a real participator in the joy of the feast we're a body all robed in spotless white and here there that wedding garment brother brandham said oh listen to this it's the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Spirit how are we going to be represented any other way if the first church had to come by the door Christ Jesus be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to put on the wedding garment how are we coming any other way impossible to come in he said if you come by Methodist or Baptist or Pentecostal any denomination you'll be bound and cast to Darkness he said you got to come by Christ Jesus the way the door the truth the life amen amen we can Echo an amen with brother brandham say absolutely the truth amen but this one here was not acknowledging that he didn't acknowledge the king nor the prince nor Karen Adam about the G gladsome event and they had no objection to be there and to eat and recline and see the pomp in the show but reject the desire that the King had I could say he was only in it but not of it right in the world and not of it but he was the bit of the Reversed he was there in the in the area but he was not of it he was not of the the wedding Feast he was in body but not in spirit right how many sit in church in body but not in spirit we need to be in and of I should say Amen you know I can't even fathom if I was sitting if I I'm going to try and get into his mind and this fellow or whoever is is the scripture is standing there and all around him are everybody in a wedding garment and he's the odd man out you'd think okay wait a second ah I need to deal with this you know you'd think he wouldn't want to or everybody around him say hey um you don't got a garment on and that's a problem so the king isn't here yet so you want to make a dash out there you want to go I don't know what way you got in here because surely you should have taken a garment at the gate when you came through Christ when you came through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he robed you in Pure White you should have came in here looking like I am but somehow you got here differently so maybe go that way you came in go around and come back through the door do that and then you'll look just like us and you'll be right a part of the body of Christ you got to come the way said well you know there was some premeditated intent to just stay there oh and as a songwriter pinned down oh sinner what's your needless delay amen why you hesitate why do you hesitate get back come in the right way and a call to be robed in Christ he rejected rejected the call and he at some point the call would go out the cry and says the bride room it's coming he's arriving and oh my everybody stands to attention oh the king is here the feast is the beginning this is incredible and everybody's at straight attention and there's one there that is sticking out like a sore thumb and here right there the king spots him you don't think Christ can't see who needs needs attention immediately in even this little meeting here as the king can walk through and his eye can spot you need attention you don't have the Rob on that you need my call went out he said friend if you go into that word actually that word friend doesn't mean my buddy my beloved you're you're you're so close to me that actually that word friend it means a selfish acquaintance one who seeks his own interest above the interest of others it's not it's not attached with filio and in fact the other there's a few times in Scripture that that word friend is used in the New Testament and the other one is when Jesus called Judas friend there was no filio connection there was no tight connection to this one CU he had had if I could say he' lost his opport opportunity the call had gone forth and the the the the the the process had been given which way to come through the door through Christ to get your garment to to be robed and he had bypassed and bypassed and bypassed and maybe some had in had said you know this is the way to go this is you need to get to Christ the end is coming the message has been given to this hour this is the pro a prophet has come and someone's been bidden bidden but then there came a point at this in the parable where there was no more time and the King said friend where's your garment you know I could say Tonight Rapture hasn't happened and I may be asked the same question do you have the right garment and this man scripture said was speechless what do you say well wait I I believe uh I'm I'm I'm a Pentecostal or you know better I'm read quote well wait a minute I'm a presbyterian I'm a Methodist or I'm a Pentecostal but BR says that had nothing to do with it he said well I believe brother br's a prophet I went to a messes Church in fact my home I had Holy Ghost parents but you don't have the robe on yes well my parents had the robe on but you don't have the robot better around says he didn't come by the door and he failed to get a robe Jesus said I am the door to the Sheepfold and if you come you can't come by the Methodist Church you're a thief and a robber he says you got to come by Jesus Christ the only way you can ever come to him is to come by Jesus and when you pass through him he throws his love a robe around you leads you to the fold that we're living on the Hallelujah side he said come and by the door why would anyone show up with the knowledge that weeping and wailing is the end never I can't believe anybody would ever do that to come by man's own way but brother B said God has a way provided that way is Jesus he says your life would compare if you had Christ and the new birth you're born again your life would compare with those in the Bible the apostles who are robed in his righteousness the thing of it is he says they come in some other way besides the door they're robed with some kind of a spirit they have the same kind of life or they or they'd have the same kind of life if they did they'd be the same people as in scripture amen he said but like Paul said in the way that's called heresy so worship I God of our fathers oh because he'd been robed in the same righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ your life would manifest the same power the same fruits the same gospel would flow through you amen he said so many people trying to get in but they're not taking God's provided entrance he said oh and if they go any other way when the apostles come to Christ when the early church came they received the baptism it made them a different people it made them a different people it made them act different it made them live different their whole life was motivated different they had different motives they had different objectives everything but Braham said was different when they came to Christ amen that's how you know you're a different people you're a peculiar people amen it should be a warning Bell in your little brain if there's some real tight similarities between you and the world right if you're like well you're kind of saddling up a little close to some of the desires or the different Trends and Fashions and it's like that's hard to see the difference here you're kind of similar I wonder we should be different some little bell should be going off on your mind because as pul hit in the way that's called heresy they're saying that's just wrong but it was the way that God desired it was the way that the Holy Spirit would would be presented through Paul and the world would say it's heresy well he should be saying that to you and I but in the way they call heresy so worshiped by God of our fathers amen what's your ambition the world's views your views how close are they oh about the Fashions and the world's ideas on that end how close are they I'd say let's get a little bit you could go say well brother Michael you can preach a little deeper no sir let's get down a little business we say we want our life to be different I want my life to align with the word of God not any bit close to the world cuz I need to have a garment that's accepted inside I'd say there's still time the door still open and the robe of his spirit is still here to fall upon you I'm going to take the I'm going to take now another road there's a call and a robe that you must wear I was just to set that portion of the service up I have no idea what time I started so my apologies but uh we'll just uh see where we go here there was a little girl one day this is for little ones maybe and big ones alike and she was a lovely little lady and she had a lot of difficulty she worked hard her mother died her father remarried to another woman that had two daughters so she had a couple step sisters and she was a really scorned little thing and you'd say she would maybe work I should say worked more like a maybe a little bit of a servant girl and she labored and they put her to work and she had to basically do their every wh and way and you know she would she went through these trials I could say in tribulations and she grew into just a beautiful young lady she had a lot of character because hardship brings that fiery trials and tribulations can bring build character and so she would learn to turn the other cheek and how to love her enemy you know and she was just a humble Meek little contrite thing and as she did her duties and she would you know she would get all dirty and filthy as she labored in the kitchen and such these you know the stove and the sit around that and they would end up calling her she'd all look smudgy and all that sit on her and she would be working and they would end up calling her Cinderella you know the story it's an old old old tale really old tale but one day an invitation went out to come to a banquet and oh she wanted to go real bad she had asked you know could I really go to this banquet that the prince is the king is putting on for the prince she wanted to go so bad to this but the response was never it ain't going to happen who would ever ever want a little dirty little thing like you at the at this banquet you got too many things to do you got all your chorice to do and slave away and do this you ain't coming for nothing look at you in filthy rags anyway oh but she just wanted to go oh and so it was just something in her heart that was yearning to be at this little banquet and her step sisters prepared and they pred and they pampered themselves in all these different ideas of what they thought they should wear and they had their own stepsister religion of what their covering should be and so they put their own design together and they had their ideas this is exactly what the prince is going to want this is what he's going to look at I'm going to wear my thought this way I'm going to wear this certain dress and I can imagine if we just kind of jump a little bit that I'd say well what what they were Desiring to Adorn themselves in was their idea of what the prince wanted their idea of what the prince wanted and I wonder how many people have their own concoction of what they're dressing themselves in of what they think he desires you know and if we said well at this right this moment right now if you were adorned in where you're at what would you be dressed in some people might be dressed in a complex of complexes that they're not able to and that that just so surrounds their world their life they're adorned in it it consumes them or maybe somebody is just a straight up hobby that that is they they eat sleep and breathe it because that's what that's what you are everything you are that that's what you're presenting yourself some people are just they work they're Workaholics they they desire the fame and the riches and the glory that's what their robe is if I could put it that way amen their robed in their profession or they're robed in their education or maybe maybe there's a hurt or a bruise or or something deep in their life and it just consumes their everyday life it's what they've robed themselves in and these step sisters with hotty shy never really wondering or even researching you know what the prince desired does anyone even know what catches his eye did anybody even do that what what does he what does he like what is his favorite color I don't know but my favorite color is yellow so that's what I'm wearing I don't really care what he thinks that's about how some people believe I don't know what what what what what what does God mean here I don't know this is what I think it means here we don't think there's an answer for that you know it says in Malachi 4 that there Elijah would come before the great and Dreadful day what's well I think that there's no more prophets anymore what you robing yourself in is your own color and so they put put themselves and they put their dress together and they left to the banquet with their own adornments and their pretty dress that they thought but reality was those pretty dresses were really just filthy rags because a prince had no desire about them anyway because if you fast forward that little story he didn't care to cents about them what they look like his eye wasn't on them it didn't catch his attention and there at back at their home they did indeed leave one that was in rags her own unrighteousness crying but there was such a desire my heart yearns to be there and she had all the grace the love the humility and the respect you know she had this Inner Strength she carried herself like a queen but she was needing a garment that she could be presented in she needed a blood token that surround would surround a little bride her character was exactly what the prince was looking for through trials and through testing but she needed she needed to be made holy and made perfect by a robe amen so brother Bram says God usually puts us in the shop and trims us up you know he didn't alter his robe to fit Elisha he ordered Elisha to fit the robe amen that's what he does today he Alters us to fit the robe so he go through trials we go through difficulty you go through some tribulation but he's just altering you a little bit he's getting you ready to fit a rope because he's got a ro for you that it's going to be perfect match that you are going to be doned and adorned in his righteousness amen but he's got to get you so you can fit it amen I don't want to be all sloppily dressed you say this thing's way too big he's going to have to work you down a little bit he said that's what he does today he Alters us to fit the robe not the robe to fit us sometimes we want to make the robe fit us right let's just go back to the story oh they had a little slipper That was supposed to it's going to fit me and they try to cram their foot into a little slipper It Don't Fit you it isn't made for you it's made for a certain little lady that's been custom made for the Prince of Peace he said he's got to bring us you've got to let yourself to be all altered for the robe it's God's robe and he's made it perfect he's got to bring us into that realm to make us fit the robe he says we can't be perfect ourself we know we can't there's no way for us to be and yet he said for us to be so but what did he do he made a propitiation for us I can't be perfect I know but I got exactly what you need amen as we heard last night brother Murphy was kind of stomping all over there a little bit but the God has a mind brother Murphy and so we'll just keep going down this line he said there's where Perfection comes of ignoring our own Holiness of which we have none of our own thoughts which we ought not to be but we rest solemnly upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus God sent him to the Earth and it was in him that we rest amen and so her cry does your heart cry of course the seed will cry oh God I need to be adorned I want to go to this Feast I heard a call I Heard a Voice that called to me and I'm responding I'm not robed so she's crying her deepest calling her deepest yearning there must be a deep to respond as we know and he said there's there's just no way in the States you are you have even have a chance to present yourself I I can't look this way I'm Unholy I'm unrighteous and then one came if you go into the little story someone came from a different dimension to put a garment on her that would be custom fit that was going to get the attention of the prince is that what happened and so she started to create a gown that was going to catch the eye she goes I know exactly what he's looking for so I'm going to Adorn you that way so that you are no one else there's no other person it might as well be an empty room it's just you and him there could been thousands of other ladies but when you're adorned in what the Prince of Peace is Desiring Nothing Else Matters to him but you and him and so he rose she robed her to we the only one that he would see and I could say if I end there we've had an eleazer coming this day to robe us so that we are the only one he wants to even look at he's going to clothe you and I amen that's what this message is is to clothe you you say well I don't know what the message was you better need that you need the message cuz it is the adorning of his word to get you ready to present you to a King there an angel a messenger From Another Dimension stepped into this realm Amen to bring the design and the layout of exactly what he wants his his Queen to wear the exact color the exact fashion he knew what he wanted and so in 1947 the threads of this garment started to be weaved amen someone from another dimension came to this Dimension to issue out the exact pattern amen anybody looked at a fabric pattern I tell you I look at it be like I wouldn't even know how to read that because it takes someone special that's anointed to be able to take the pattern to be able to receive from God and then issue out this is what he's Desiring and we had then we start to hear the very beginnings and it starts to weave and the the me the message starts to go forth and G and the faith is the substance of things hoped for the message only believe the message experiences the prophet started to speak out as the base layers of Faith started to be weaved and woven for a bride he said oh show show it set the rock of Revelation that my church needs to be built on preach these foundational messages so that they know exactly whom they have believed in line upon line believe in God a greater than Soloman is here I need my bride to know that my Plan of Redemption I need them to know I'm her Boaz preach kinsman redeemer Hall I need this little bride to be adorned this garment it represents me it represents my word it represents my righteousness oh he said layer it in golden thread maybe preach Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever she must be adorned presenting to the world that I'm the same healer I'm the same deliverer I'm the same God the pattern kept being issued out preach as I was with Moses so shall I be with you preach why Christ speak you got a problem speak my word that's what she's adorned in she's not just some humble don't know nothing he's saying Speak Moses came to the waters you've been given speak my word they must know that she's a p must be a pure virgin bride preach serpent seed so she knows exactly what happened at the beginning of the garden oh I like some nice elegant sleeves on this gown maybe that she may be able to look at her adornment and her sleeves and it's in my name that there is power I am the Lord and her savior I am that I am I am Jehovah the old Jesus of the new preach godhead preach God God's provided way preach the church ages this is your dress wear this is him adorning you he says oh I needed her to be presented with the Revelation that has been me all the time I am the en morphe I am that one that's unveiling myself that's pouring myself into Christ that's pouring myself into her preaching unveiling of God prise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus oh there's a real part critical part of this dress it's such a gorgeous little addition that I want to add into it oh maybe uh may maybe she needs to know that that all the mystery of my Plan of Redemption it's been revealed she needs to be adorned in this Simplicity just sew it in so simply but I like it to be seven nice layers because it's the revealing of who I am it's the mystery of my coming preach heals and when she looks at it she can see it's a vital part of her faith for Rapture add another layer who is this smaz Hallelujah add another layer flesh and red light of is coming Jesus we need some lovely stockings maybe some lovely slippers you can't be walking in without no shoes on it's got to be a complete garment keep sewing elaser marriage and divorce Masterpiece spoken words Original Seed the sewing needle was moving so quickly Golden Threads of Eternity moving so that you and I could be continually wrapped and adorned in this message oh that g needs a little Sparkle I really love diamonds and when she sees him she'll know that I've provided a token a place of safety nothing can be hard for her she has my protection all of Hell will Compass her but she's robed in my righteousness oh she also needs a veil and it must be the most prettiest of design oh my sacredness veils would Veil The Very word expressed preach Christ is the mystery of God revealed in her cuz it's me in her I'm veiled in her she needs to know the coming of the lord it's in her she's my mystery I've been veiled in my bride and I can imagine that God continually urging and inspiring his eleazer to ensure that the dress is exactly he couldn't deviate one way nor the other though he they tried and they pushed and they pulled but he was ensuring that the fabric and the thread was being woven just perfect you say this garment this message is this garment that I need to wear I'm saying exactly that am it's this message that reveals the scripture in our day of who you are and it r you and I so that we are presentable at that at that date at that time at the revealing when we walk into that marriage Feast I don't want to be with my own garment the Bible said his wife has made herself ready at the End of the Age how did she make herself ready to become his wife what did she do what what does she what kind of garment she had on his own word she was dressed in his righteousness that's what it is right it needs a little Touch of Elegance it needs a train cuz she's my bride I needed to fall behind her preach Masterpiece oh I like a little on those little slippers that she could just look down little Rows of Sharon design cuz that's who I am and when she puts her foot out in front of her preach the guide so she would know that's exactly who's leading her maybe that very last message as he spoke leadership it's come follow me she knows exactly who's she's entrusting your leadership to it's her King it's her king of kings and Lord of lords the design is perfect and she needs to robe herself in and I say get in this message keep keep your eyes on me the last days will be dark but my word will lead you to ensure that you are properly adored and in a garment fit for a queen Hallelujah he says therefore in the days of Wesley and Luther it was thought to be believed in the day of the chemistry of the blood but this day where the token is required that makes get the whole unit for the Rapture water blood and Spirit come when a mother gives birth the first thing breaks in a normal birth is water second blood and in life there come from the body of our Lord Jesus water blood and life and the whole church the bride together has been made to justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the token simple and the church in this day has received it of the baptism he says the blood has been shed the Holy Ghost is upon the church without us then they could not raise he says they dep depending on us all those from past ages are depending on you and I for God promised he would have it and somebody is going to be there I don't know who he says it's going to be but I if I could say brother bradam we're here this is who it's going to be they're depending on you and I to make sure that we are robed appropriately that we are adorned and waiting and ready for this great Rapture he said there's no Rapture without a people that won't Adorn themselves in this message people who died in here are depending but a brand says and are waiting on us think of it they're waiting on you the church has got to come to perfection in order to bring Resurrection Souls Under The Altar and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority he said less and less are wanting to put on the the Garment that he's prepared can you imagine it's like here's my robe come into my come into my Feast would you be my bride here's here's my robe would would please Adorn it that robe who wants this that this this message I mean who would believe a Prophet come anyway really serpent seed but that's what's happening in this day and even people that have been in this message have professed to believe it and they've just left it behind said no I don't believe it no more and they're essentially stripping themselves of the Garment that is going to bring them into a Rapture can you imagine as they stood before the king of judgment and say well you tore off the Garment that I gave you oh my you say oh God I just want to adore myself I want to wrap myself every bit of me that I need every bit of design if there's a message I haven't been into I want to get into it I want my Footwear my sofware my dress wear whatever my veil my train I want it all and they're depending on you the Saints of old are depending on you and I to Adorn ourselves God didn't send this message just to throw it away he sent it so that there would be a people that would be [Applause] raptured I love the old the I love the the 100 meter D the 100 meter relay run I love it because I love the Baton I love the passing of it I love I love that teamwork aspect of a body you got the front the middle the fourman team or whatever it needs to be but there's a last one there's an anchor Runner that is there at the at the back end he's waiting he's in position they've run the race they've run the race and they're ready to receive the Baton and they're just primed and ready and the whole team is depending on that one the whole team is depending on this one to make sure you take the Baton you get in the message and you run this race you imagine team USA at the 100 by4 and he's just there that anchor Runner is right at the end and he's like yeah I got it I got the Baton I'm ready for it actually is this way and he's got his eyes on the goal and he's got his hand ready for the taton and it gland in his hand and he's like whatever you'd be like are you serious Team USA has made it all the way to the finals they're all there at the Olympic at the right at the top you've got I man I can't remember even who here some of your runners but we would go insane you just dropped the Baton oh my don't drop the Baton pick it up and run with patience that you might attain Hallelujah there's a cloud of witnesses waiting for you oh yeah I don't want no substitute artificial garment brother BR said a woman that puts on a garment that pertains to man as an Abomination it's filthy God don't like no garment that's wrong okay he says and you that claim to have the Holy Ghost yeah you got that's got long hair wear dresses and eat and everything but you stay home on Wednesday night and watch a program a television program instead of a church prayer meeting he said you're presuming you got the Holy Ghost you don't want to be artificial no we don't want to be a fake we want to be wrapped in the genuine the genuine robe amen there's there's no I'll tell you there's no substitute false teeth in the resurrection you know there's no artificial prosthetic in the resurrection it's all real amen it's real and neither do we want an artificial Christian will'll never raise in the resurrection genuine Believers Sons and Daughters of God that have received the call and responded to adoring themselves yes sir brother Murphy you know I had some when you started speaking about the scrubbing I've never heard a preacher you know even take that topic of a of a lady trying to scrub I I I I could find it in my notes I have wrote and I wrote U I'll go on a limb here when I was a kid we would uh we you know in school we did the lion witch in the wardrobe CS Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia it was a book thing anybody ever read that yeah okay you know if you read the whole thing there's a you know one of the characters turns into Dragon because he gets greedy right and he tries to carry clean himself and and remove the skin of of his of his torment and I had wrote that in my in my notes and you brother Murphy started to just scrape he says no how is this God is trying to tell you something that's how I receive that God's trying to tell you something you cannot remove the stain on your own it requires somebody from another dimension to come and start to scrape if you know the story it was a lion that came in and tore deep into that story I said it's the lion of Judah that has to tear deep into you to remove the stain but this garment that we've been given it's a cleansing robe I'm going Lord has a has a desire if you didn't hear it last night you go listen to it and you'll hear a little bit even now but maybe the Lord has sometimes he'll say things two times as a parent you ever said something to your kids once twice maybe three times four five 10 20 times will you ever get it and then they do so sometimes when a preacher comes and you're like well I've heard that before but maybe it just hasn't quite sunk and so he brings another preacher and he brings another and another message and then maybe on the 20th time you're like yes I get it and so this garment is a cleansing robe it's more powerful than bleach it's almost if I could say like an invisibility cloak because it makes but revers because what's underneath it cannot be seen all you see is the robe amen and all that's under it is forever gone and I was thinking of Ruth the moabit a heathen considered wretched and unclean to Israel MO Mo was for is balam and such and Israel was justified in scorning and uring there was no connection with Moab no connection cursed nation and she had the stain of a heathen upon her you think she walked into Israel and they was just like oh oh no it was scorn ridicule mockeries because she had a stain of the moabites upon her a heathen and no matter what she did to try and be as inconspicuous as possible she could never get away from that and so she'd maybe glean somewhere but she couldn't escape that she was different the stain of her past was on her and she could not remove it she could not no matter how hard she tried could not remove the stain of who she was but I would say there was a redeemer in the story that could remove the stain and when she became part of him all things changed because she was no longer identified with Ruth the moabit but she's identified with Ruth who was Boaz his wife and her identity was in him it was he who covered her with his robe and adorned her and took her into his body he said no Ruth you're you're mine you're stain of who you are is no more you're now part of me you're your Boaz his wife not the moabit hallelujah how many in your past desired to remove stains blemishes of sins maybe you're smoking and drinking and you're lusting and all of that and you hated it but you couldn't remove it maybe some even currently hate something but on your own you cannot remove it and like brother Murphy said you try to rub it off what about your past David you think that you'd try to smear off in your own way but I think of those that in the past there was David David did not walk across into glory and adorned him he was wrapped in a robe and he was accepted on that day but then someone look at and say wait a second you got a spot right there what's that stain on your robe no oh that's the spot of murder no that's not how it was it's not when Abraham didn't receive he didn't receive a garment he was given it to him he like sorry uh my blood couldn't remove where you lied here or Jacob the spots of deception or Samson sorry but you married a Philistine and you got all that issues with Delilah I just couldn't get it out of the robe you're just going to have to wear like that but but that's not going to be accepted it needs to be spotless and pure the bride needs to be Adorn in His Garment that that doesn't have any stain or spot or wrinkle I'm sorry that's not what he got that's not what Moses got when he got given a given a robe and it's like well you murdered a guy you know that's like pretty bad how do you think I got that out of there you sure Rahab you you know you're called the Harlot all the time Rahab the Harlot I mean your Deeds were terrible you know what you had to do and your way of living it it's filthy I can't get that out of that robe there's a stain on your character you know that's the hardest thing to remove you know nothing but my Jesus Hallelujah My Savior shed his blood at Calvary this robe that I wear is not of my own but it's a blood covering that raps me and whether it was murder whether it was Harlot Tre whether it was thieving and lying and lusting or whatever it could be you put your sin there I put my sin there I don't care what it was but when you get wrapped and adorned with this word and it adorns you all over when Jesus sees you and look at and gives you the robe you can look at say oh my goodness that's as white as snow although my sins be as Scarlet they are white as snow because I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah that's the robe you want to be dorned in that's the robe you want to be wrapped in you don't want to be a Moses or somebody that would that had that kind of thing no sir but there are some that do not have that covering and they will indeed come up and he will say I'm sorry but you didn't wrap yourself in the covering of my blood and therefore I I cannot but see the stains I cannot but see the Maring say oh but can't you cover me now I gave you an opportunity yes yes true I don't care what your stain is right now I don't care what your complex is right now I don't care how deep the hurt how hard the Forgiveness might be I don't care what it is this word this Jesus Christ can Adorn you and remove every stain you get identified in your boys in your Redeemer the bride is adorned in the token blood the scripture says verily verily I say unto you he that Hearth my word and Believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life Hallelujah wouldn't you want to be in that place that's where the call is going forth saying come up a little higher little bride Adorn yourself in my word because therefore there's no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus Oh may you walk out tonight oh maybe you're just walking a few feet off the ground in some air because you're like I am not condemned I am covered in the robe of Boaz amen Rahab right Rahab became not Rahab the Harlot as bad as her history could be but the moment Salon took her as wife she became part of him and no longer she got ejected injected into the lineage of Christ when you become part of this groom when he receives you into himself you get injected into the lineage of Jesus Christ that's the power of this Blood it can remove all pasts all stain all history and inject you into royalty what a barrier this blood is hallelujah that he might present to himself a glorious church not having a spot or a wrinkle or any such thing amen that it should be holy and without blemish that's my God I say come come unto me all you who are weary in heavy Adorn yourself in this garment if I could close I'm sorry I don't even know what time I would started I'll just close with this there's more to this garment if I could say it this way not diminishing at all but just add to the the characteristics of this great robe because the robe has more it has also the power of the blood but there's another there's power also in this great robe and the scripture says in in the in Kings Elisha wanting a double portion and he said Elijah said you have asked a hard thing he said if thou see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so I wrote the first thing the first key is Elisha could not take his eye now off of Elijah Elijah asked a hard thing you've asked a hard thing to have a double portion of my spirit but if you see me then you'll have what you ask for so I'd say if you ask for a double portion of his blood and his covering and his Spirit to be infused in you as Jesus Christ Holy Spirit was sent out after the cross of Calvary you say I want that I say you better keep your eye on this message am what he sent you in this day because of Elisha wherever Elijah went now and he missing it how did he know Elijah's Gone elij Gone how do you know you got to keep your eye on this word you got to keep your eyes dead center wherever it moves whatever it says whatever this message says I ain't deviating because I want a double portion of his love amen is a songwriter pin down he says oh this garment wasn't just it's not not a form of godliness it wasn't that there's no power no no no no when Elisha got the mantle there was a power that came behind that mantle he didn't just wear it for good looks he said brother don't be afraid to ask God for anything second-handed robe was all right but AB BR said he needed a fresh call of God in his heart he needed a fresh anointing he wore a secondhand robe when came to the river but he needed a brand new firsthand call from God and a firsthand power from God he he said my brother don't be afraid to ask God anything now catch this brother brandham says You must demand God or ask God for anything he's promised for if I'm introducing a God that's omnipotent and all powerful and if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if I do the works of God you're ready for this not disrespecting but he says I must demand of God to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible [Music] all that's a Son of God that's standing exactly who he knows he is he knows where he stands and he's saying God is demanding of me to produce the impossible he says I have to ask him I have to call on him and stand there and say you promised hall hallelujah but it takes us son and daughter of God who are willing to step out in faith and say you're demanding of me to produce the impossible then oh God respectfully I'm demanding that you come on a seene and do the [Applause] impossible brother Bram says so you say well that's the prophet that's the messenger that's Malachi 4 he says then to you the bride that he's adorning he says to you so do you every person so now suddenly he's put that word in your mouth prophesy again Hallelujah you shall receive power and you after your robed is a your faith is set in Christ then you you shall receive power there you are yes and every brother sister this morning he says may I say this before going to prayer he says it's not Goliath that hindered me God slayed him before me but the thing that's hindered it's the lack of faith I said oh God May the faith Bank raise this night when Jesus stood on Earth healings and miracles are going abroad the disciples were following and there was a point there they tried to heal God gave him power to go and they couldn't and they could the epileptic boy couldn't be healed and said oh we we couldn't do it we couldn't he wasn't healed he prayed he wasn't he healed he said oh little faith and so there was a time then Jesus prayed delivered the disciples wow this is this is incredible and they seem blind then they seen lame then they seen the deaf he blind see and I'm sure their amazement started to increase then he walked then they walked on water Peter stepped out and you know all this little time maybe they had a little bit of doubt you know wow you know a blind one but oh no no he can do that you mean calm the sea and it's a raging Storm oh he can do that and their faith Bank I'm sure was raising a little bit to the point where it must have come to Lazarus and they're like well I mean he can heal but what are we doing here this is the dead that stinketh all so long and after four days but then they stood there and they watched in Wonder and amazement as the Son of God Christ himself stood there cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and they saw the dead man come walking out of the Tomb at that moment I'd have to say that the disciples would have to said all right there's nothing there's nothing he cannot do throw it at him devil but he's God and I believe wholeheartedly H I'd say as a body of Christ we've seen a whole lot of what our God can do that's right you start going by I don't even have the time I could go through this aisle and say what have you seen God do what have you seen God do you've seen the miracles happen you've seen the death here you've seen the lame walk You' you've seen God move Cancer's Cancer's completely annihilated do you've seen it I'd say we've come to a place bride of Jesus Christ that we've got to come and we are here now where we can say there's nothing my God cannot do because Leviticus says he shall take blood of the Bullock sprinkl it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times but AB Bram says oh isn't that beautiful seven times towards the east what is it the seven Church ages shall be covered by the blood blood Jesus Christ blood just as sufficient in it yesterday today and forever in every age to save every sinner to heal every sick person bring every miracle and every sign to pass seven times way back in the Old Testament 1490 years before Christ come think of it a symbol seven times so does it prove today in this age in this day that he can still raise the dead you say Well that's pretty bold words brother the Michael he can raise a dead and if there's a dead person here I believe with all my heart he raise him right up out of the Grave Just as he did Lazarus but there might be a dead spiritual person and I'd have to say if you could put on a scale that's worse but my God can raise the dead you know how I know that because you're sitting here excuse me you're sitting here dead in sins and trespasses but God through his rich Mercy has raised you up and adorned you with a bride with a robe that's how I know he can raise the dead you say some here are pretty pretty desperate cases like Lazarus yep yep but you're here so uh boo devil it's been done it's been done we have our brother back home brother yonas was had cancer they told him for one he had cancer and so that was a death sentence in itself and for two the remot chance that you're going to somehow survive from that you can't even have kids and such and he was just getting he was engaged at believeing about Dem married or in close to that but you know what he does not have cancer and he does have a baby is that the truth that's the truth we've seen too many I we don't have time but surely like the Disciples of old we don't doubt the power of almighty God because the Holy Spirit has robed this bride and is not lacking in power so then what I say is take the robe that Elisha has received take the holy spirit that you have received and walk to Jordan and strike it right you have not just been given a robe to look beautiful you've been given a robe to defeat the enemy you've been given a robe to Rapture out of hereen Amen he said brother Braham said it's time to take this holy spirit that we're Anointed with and say where is the god that was Upon Jesus Christ you say well that's pretty bold that's your Prophet yes I'm just quoting him you say it yeah where's the god of Jesus Christ where's the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob where's the God that was on our lord Jesus the blessings he said and in this great crisis here that someone had to turn back to Elijah was gone he was the one that had poured the water in his hands that had double portion so this sick and sin for world goodday could look at a real Church of the Living God who possess a double portion of his holy spirit we can we what can we do in this time what can we do in this time if someone has the boldness to say I've been adorned and he's demanding me to do the impossible what's the impossible to me you might have something on your heart that's impossible God's you with a robe that is accepted and gives you power if you just believe musicians why don't you come Elisha asked for a double portion and I was thinking Elisha we know types the bride we you go back to eight miracles Elijah 16 Miracles Elisha double portion I know preachers have preached on that as such I was thinking about the double portion if you go deep that that last I believe the 16th miracle was the dry bones if I'm correct on the dry bones when the or the body was thrown onto the bones and they were Elisha's bones and he raised up so it took some time for that to come to fulfillment but those power and those bones still held still had the Bones still held the power to bring that prophecy to pass no matter how long they sat there but at the Jordan I was thinking that this bride is coming to indeed if you look at that last miracle the last one was a resurrection you say there's the double portion and we're here as a bride to receive a rapturing double portion and that's that's where we are and you can run run the tip but I was just thinking you know that double portion has even maybe an extra little air to that because at this day and age there's not just Resurrection that's needed for dead bones but there's a double portion in that power and anointing in this bride because there's living bones there's a bride that's staying here that's living and breathing and we need an extra portion so that we are also resurrected it's the dead bones and it's the living bones that will be resurrected by this double portion of this anointing so that's uran I portion of this garment say Lord I'm not here to die and go into the grave but if so you can raise me but this double portion is a rapturing portion that those which are alive and remain shall be gathered together with them in the air it's a Rapture robe it's a power robe it's a sin cleansing robe I say come and Dorn yourself tonight in the Garment of his word and don't come to a marriage feast in your own garment and be speechless why don't we stand tonight [Music] the Call's gone [Music] out I wrote on my notes I just said well there could be three responses you could have a speechless response when the king says where's your role that's one possibility but I believe tonight the response will be a praise or maybe a striking Jordan maybe it's a need tonight you said I didn't realize what I've been adorned in and I've been living a little underprivileged I say on your heart tonight you lift up before the Lord yes we didn't just come to church to hear somebody preach if you came to church because you believe in a living God then a living God is here to meet your need that's right that's right if you're a sinner you say well like but Michael I actually feel like I'm robless tonight he's here his word is here to Adorn you the time hasn't come where there's no more time left I say run say Lord I need a [Music] Rob but B says father there's here those here who does not have that garment that sees the seriousness that they'll hear the king say that day how did you get in here you had an example you had my Parables you heard my message you read in the word you've seen what they did the first ones that come to the door of Pentecost that's the way they got it that's the way they acted that's the way what they had that's the lives they lived and you're here trying to hold before me a denominational ticket he said you must be born again and filled with the Holy Spirit he said that is your need tonight that is your cry as the song leader sang but David sang as we came up here what what your need watch your cry come on we sing that here as we close you put your you put your need he said Lord this is my need tonight and I'm not walking out that door without this garment on my back and sing that what's your need your cry watch your Mountain oh my speak the word of God speak the word of God and By and By by and by o it will move amen just flop your little wings a little bit tonight oh we set your wing oh till the wings of Faith oh you can fly in a higher place oh do not struggle it's BYU amen said it tonight let's sing that third verse watch the eagle oh watch the eag better David didn't know this was going to be in the message tonight but that eagle doesn't struggle he doesn't strive he just believes he doesn't oh for the power oh that Mak him rise already already in the SK oh to to The Winds of f oh you can in a higher place oh to not strle it's by to to [Music] who said [Music] to [Music] higher strle is my PR [Music] why don't we bow our heads tonight I don't believe tonight God would allow us to come to A Moment Like This to a service and not require us to step out in faith we could hear we can read a message we can read the scripture we can listen to a sermon and we can walk out the door but I believe tonight God is demanding of us to actually step out in faith actually do something make an action tonight I don't know whatever God has put on your heart whether it's to lift your hands whether it's to get on your knees I don't know what it is and I don't know what your need but the song writer depend on what your need what's your cry so you need to now step out in faith maybe need to put it on your lips a little bit and start are confessing it and making some movement and saying Lord I don't know how I don't know when but I just believe it tonight this is my impossible this is my circumstance and I need you to move on the scene why don't you lift your hands to him whenever you may feel to do we're going to pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord we're in the midst of your people Lord a group of people that are adorned in a robe that are adorned in a garment oh God lord not just a pretty dress wear but Lord It's a robe of power it's a robe that's full of anointing it's a robe that has power to resurrect oh God it's a robe that has power to heal it has power to bind Lord Jesus I pray tonight Lord that the the faith of your people would recognize that they've received a message they've received a word that has wrapped them Lord with a with a robe that does not just Lord end right there at at its appearance but it begins and the healing they need the Deliverance they need is surrounding them this very moment oh God I pray Lord on their lips tonight that they Place their need Lord they Place their cry and Lord your presence would start to brood tonight Lord not that you would end but you would begin begin to move on their behalf Lord begin to deal with hearts that are needing to make a move maybe they've never budged an inch before but Lord make Lord maybe they just need to take that one little step and the Holy Spirit unction will do the rest but you're just looking for that little movement that little hand to go in the air something oh God that they would be able to do that then you can move on their behalf and then finish the work you began Lord I commit this little group of people Lord precious Believers here in Dallas that you've held Lord they've been a lamp post a ligh host in this area of the world would you continue to let their light shine May the works of your Holy Spirit move through them in a mighty way oh God as they even laboring Lord to continue they have a little building there they're putting in their effort would you God you pour the blessings upon this little congregation Lord Jesus that we would meet on that great day and we would all look at each other and say oh you have such a beautiful Rob on it's the same as mine oh God because that's what we're here Lord you ensure that we're dressed in the robe of your righteousness I commit them to you tonight may you continue now to brood I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] amen amen the blood that Jesus shed for me way back on calary the blood that gives me strength from day to to it will never lose is high amen let's sing that now oh for for it reaches oh to the highest mountain will and clows oh to the low lowest [Applause] Oh The Blood [Music] to amen what a word does it inspire you does it put a question on your heart and a desire in you to come up higher how many feel that you you realize you need to come up higher amen you need to come up higher to get more involved to get more dedicated D start letting him dress you with the Rob yes you know I I I thought it was Marvel I started to write notes and I couldn't even keep up with it but he said you know I thought it was amazing he said you know there's a that man had that attitude in that wedding supper he he was self-independent his own agenda his own design sat right in the midst of everybody but never surrendered never gave in to the way it was spoken just the way the messenger said it he talked about those that just walked away from it you know and he didn't want to be clothed and he told us how that that garment was that token you say well what's that what's the token that's the biggest question that we get what is the baptism of the holy spirit it's when the one from the other dimension Hallelujah comes down and changes your nature and changes the desires of your heart can you be religious without the change I think that's what was preached us so beautiful [Music] tonight that you can fake everybody out around you but what a time to be honest with yourself what a what a what a wonderful time right now to ask yourself if you want to rededicate your [Music] life to look deep inside and and to know what it's like maybe get Place St or something and I think that I wouldn't want to take it to this place without giving us the opportunity Unity to wait a moment you know I like that song stay because it says do you know what it's [Music] like you know it's like to be so lost so far away from God that there's no hope and then just to look up to him and scream from your heart God help me God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this and then to have him come down pick you up in his hands and say it's okay that's why I died and I I thought it was so beautiful tonight that's been told us you can't fix [Music] it you can't fix it right you can't stop doing it yes thank Jesus you can't there's nothing in you to do [Music] it it's got to come from someplace else Hallelujah it's got to come from another realm another dimension thank you Jesus and I think that's so beautiful he demands you to be perfect and you [Music] can so he just says that you got to look back up to him and say Lord I can't you're demanding me to do it so I'm going to demand you to change me hallelujah hallelujah do you really want to be different do you really want to come up higher do you really want the stain removed it takes you dedicating yourself to him and then God takes those people that he's changed and he molds them together fit and joined and he becomes a beautiful bride do you want to be a part of that I mean I'm I'm talking from the bottom of your heart Lord I don't want to miss what our brother was preaching about a message that's come to dress us and Adorn us for a Rapture and a wedding supper and I have not been involved in that program I've been self-willed I've been doing my own thing I've been pursuing my career I've been dabbling and all kinds of nonsense I am not sold out oh Lord but tonight Lord I want that to change I want to rededicate myself to you I want to want to start fresh and I want to lift my spirit to you Lord and say [Music] father I say it with faith you wouldn't have demanded and put this call and this burden on me to be different if you weren't going to do something for me Lord I don't want to wait till tomorrow Lord I want to really from the depth of my heart father come back into the battle I want I want to get back into the fight I want to get back into the spirit I want to get I want to be renewed back and I I want my fire to be enkindled again in you Lord Jesus I don't want to go out of here the same way but it takes a little bit of your [Music] time takes a little bit of your heart it takes you just bowing your head and moving into his presence and saying Lord I'm here I'm surrendering there's no need me confessing all my sins to you you already know you know my weaknesses you know my mind battle I have a mind battle but I've been told tonight in your word that if I would take a moment and I will set myself before you just as I am and I would come and I would ask you father to come and start working in me and dressing me I'm here to praise myself father in your hands and be rededicate my life to you H and as we sing this song I want to give you the opportunity each of you in your own heart to reach out to him if you're in a place that you feel that prayer would help you we'd be happy to pray for you but it's not about our prayer it's about you and him right where you are please take this opportunity to ask your heart do I want to serve God with all my might do I want to ask God to fix the problems in my marriage do I want to ask God to fix the problems on my job do I want to ask God to fix the weakness that's in my flesh the bitterness that's in my heart do I want want to ask God in my [Music] life I know what it's like in the presence of the Lord and I know what time is [Music] time to [Music] stay is [Music] with because we stand here in the presence of the Lord no one

heart is [Music] your [Music] our gracious father Lord I pray that the seriousness of this sour would burn in our hearts Lord what's at [Music] stake the value of the Garment what it possesses and what it does and where it takes [Music] you that we wouldn't be beguiled of the Simplicity of the Gospel of our Lord [Music] Jesus father that we wouldn't be lured Away by carnal and mental battles father we wouldn't be defeated by sickness by [Music] depressions we wouldn't be defeated by any torture or any demons that the enemy would Place upon us because you are the same yesterday today and forever that we take our stand now and say Satan you will not defeat me cuz the word of God says if Christ be before me who can be against me amen Lord you I I'm standing here Satan you will not defeat me because he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world Satan you will not take me because the gospel I heard tonight said that nothing could pluck me out of the palm of his hand and that he would take my Roe filthy as they [Music] are and he would tailor me a new garment a new nature a new life a new heart that he'd take my heart a stone and he'd make it like flesh that I could become a new creature in Christ Jesus and I want to just take a moment Lord to stay in your presence [Music] and let your spirit move on me I don't want to let this moment go [Music] by Lord we want to know what it's [Music] like Lord It's been forgotten people waiting and sitting and let you move father I want to sing this song again and I hope each heart can clear their mind and begin to move and just take a moment say Lord I that word spoke to me tonight and I want to just give you another thought I want to give you you another moment Lord to deal with my [Music] heart I know what it's like just wait in his presence for a [Music] moment he's giving you an opportunity right now [Music] and bodies were heales restored because we stayed [Music] here in the presence of the Lord no one
