========================================

cry out for what he's listening for you know the scripture says in luke 18 8 that when he comes will he find faith in the earth and god is listening for the sound of a people to cry out to them with his own word with faith attached to it that's the sound he's listening for that's the frequency that he's tuned to and when he hears his own word activated by faith that's an acceptable time you know it says in j it says in mark 11 24 therefore i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them james said ye ask and receive not because you ask amiss and says in verse in chapter 5 of james is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of the elders the prayer of faith shall save the sick so you know as i was reading this it occurred to me that david recognized that there was an acceptable time for prayer a time when prayer was acceptable a time when it was effectual and it was when the cry of his people match what he is listening for then he can come on the scene you know so as we read psalm 69 this morning we won't read it all we'll just read the first 18 verses if you find yourself in an hour of desperation and sooner or later we all will will your prayer be in an acceptable time will it be what he's listening for psalm 34 15 says the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry let's just read psalm 69 together we'll just read those first 18 verses it says save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away oh god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me when i wept and chaste my soul with fasting that was to my reproach i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them they that sit in the gates speak against me and i was the song of the drunkards but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters let not the water flood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me hear me o lord for thy loving kindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies amen [Music] amen god bless you this morning oh christ i redeemer died on

there's so much in here for you and uh and so uh i'll try it's gonna might be a little longer than we would normally like but the the word is so great to feast on um i know jackson's family's here brother tommy's brothers here today christ he wants to be baptized and you know that's uh really a thrill when we see that hey nice to have uh thomas sacks with us today and lily's with us and her husband so that's wonderful let's just approach him for a moment and uh once again let's keep brother mike you know i just lost a friend and i i just don't believe god's gonna take another one so we just really want to turn our hearts if you have something that you'd like god to do for you as mike said an acceptable time to hear this is an acceptable time i feel his presence to make your request known father once again we come before your throne father we're here because your word spoke us into existence and now father you want to share that very word that spoke us into existence with us this morning i ask that you grant the freedom of your spirit father i ask that you deal with the souls this morning that are away from you and deep in their heart they know that they could serve you and they want to serve you but satan has lied to them about their past and about their place and their position father i asked this morning that you'd open their eyes that they may see themselves in you that they might understand that you love them that you paid a price for every evil that they ever done and you took the punishment of that upon yourself and that by your stripes that we are healed and the chastisement of our peace is upon you and you've done so much for us father i just ask you to continue to win souls bring in the loved ones that your church has prayed for we ask these things this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning we're going to play 20 minutes this morning right now of who is this melchizedek thank you musicians and we're going to start at paragraph 29 and and then he'll read the scriptures and right after the reading of the scriptures he'll say think of this great person and then we can take our seeds are you ready for a good bible study this morning amen i just i can't tell you i won't be able to even begin to half preach this the way that it moved on my heart but there's so much revelation in here for each of us that it answers so many questions it's so beautiful so we just trust the lord be your portion this morning so god bless you brothers if you would start that on paragraph 29 and we'll be seated right after the scriptures thank you let's get right into the service now quickly turning now with me if you will to the book of hebrews and another revelation on the message we'll speak for just a few moments tonight the lord willing and then well reading the first three verses of hebrews 7 1-3 and then commenting on this and we don't know what the lord will do we do not know the only thing we do is just believe watch pray is that right amen and believe that he'll make everything work together for good to them it loves him because he promised to amen for this melo king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace let's read a little further without father without mother without the sin neither beginning of days or end of life but made liken to the son of god abideth the priest continuing think of this great person of how great this man must be and now the question is who is this man theologians has had different ideas but since the opening of the seven seals the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us according to revelations 10 1-7 all the mysteries that's wrote in this book that's been hid down through the age of the reformers is supposed to be brought out into view by the angel of the last church age how many knows that's right amen that's right supposed to be brought all the mysteries of the mysterious book is to be revealed to the ladies messenger of that age seeing there is much dispute about this person and this subject i think it behooves just to break into it to find out who this is now there's several schools of thought on him one of the schools are claims he's just a myth he wasn't actually a person and the others says that it was a priesthood that was a male chesadec priesthood that's the most likely one that hold better to that side than the due to the other is because they say it was a priesthood it can't be that for in the fourth verse it says he was a person a man so in order to be a person he has to be a personality a man not a order but a person so he was not just a priesthood order neither was he a myth he was a person and the person is eternal if you notice he had no father he had no mother he had no time he ever began and he had no time he ever ended and ever who it was is still alive tonight because the bible said here that he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of life so it would have to be an eternal person is that right an eternal person so it could only be one person that's god because he's the only one that's eternal god now in first timothy 6 15 and 16 if you'd like to read that sometime i'd like for you to read it now the thing that i contend is that he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and now god changing himself into person that's what he wants no father no mother no beginning in life no entering a days now we find in the scripture that many people teach us that three personalities in the godhead so you cannot have a personality without being a person it takes a person to make a personality a baptist minister a few weeks ago come up and to my house and said i like straightening out on the godhead sometime when he got time called me up brother i said i got time right now because i want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it he come up he said brother branham you teach that there is just one god i said yes sir he said well he said i believe there's one god but one god in three persons i said sir repeat that again he said one god in three persons i said where did you go to school and he told me a bible college i said i could believe that you cannot be a person without being a personality and if you're a personality you are a one personality to yourself your separate individual being and he said well the theologians can't even explain that i said it's by revelation and he said i can't accept revelation i said then is no way for god to ever get to you because it's hid from the eyes of wise and prudent and revealed to babes revealed revelation revealed to babes such as will accept it alone now said there'd be no way for god to get to you you've closed yourself off from him the whole bible is a revelation of god the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there's no other way to know god only by revelation to whom the son will reveal him revelation everything is revelation so to ex not to accept the revelation then you're just a cold theologian and there's no hope for you now now we find out that this person had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life it was god in marfan now the world the word comes the greek word means change was used changing himself in marfa from one person to one person the greek word there in martha means it was taken from the stage act that one person is changing his mask to make him some other character like in in school just recently i believe rebecca just before she graduated they had one of shakespeare's play and one young man had to change his clothes several times because he played two or three different parts but the same person he come out one time he was the villain and when he came out next time he was another character and now the greek word in marfa mean that he changed his mass and that's what god did it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the the spirit the pillar of founder the same god was made flesh and dwelt among us in martha brought out so he could be seen and now that same god is a holy ghost father son holy well not three gods three offices three acts of the one god the bible said there's one god not three but that's how that they could you can't get this straightened out and have three gods you'd never sell a jew that i'll tell you that one who knows better he knows there's only one god notice like the sculpture he hides with uh a mast over that's what god's done to this age it's been hit all these things has been hid and supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is and that's what the bible has been it has been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hidden since the foundation of the world and it's sevenfold mystery and god promised in this day at the age of this ladies church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing god in marfan masked in a pillar of fire god in marfa in a man called jesus god in marfa in his church amen god above us god with us god in us the constant seeing of god up there holy no one could touch him he settled up on the mountain and even if an animal touched the mountain had to die and then god come down and change his tent and come down and live with us become one of us and we held him the bible said first timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of god it's for god was manifested in the flesh handled by hands god eat meat god drank water god slept god cried he was one of us beautiful types in the bible that was god above us god with us now it's god in us the holy spirit not the third person the same person god came down and become flesh and died to death in christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for fellowship god loves fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time far was for fellowship god dwelt alone a chairman and notice now he made man and man fell so he came down and redeemed man because god loves to be worshipped the word word god means object of worship and this that comes among us as a pillar of fire as something that changes our hearts that is the same god that said let there be light and there was light he's the same yesterday today and forever now in the beginning god dwelled along with his attributes as i spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just god alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks is he's going to to build create now he cannot create he could take something that's been created and make it in a different form because god's the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then and uh a word is a thought when it's expressed it's a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought then a word notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him and his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else [Music] that's eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite god and if he isn't infinite he isn't god god has to be infinite we're finite he's infinite and he was on the present omni mission and omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be god knows all things all places because of his omnipresent omni mission makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he is a being he dwells in a house but being on the mission knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he knows everything is going on there can't be a flea bat its eyes but what he noted and he noted before there was the world how many times had bad its eyes and how much talent had in it before there ever was a world that is infinite if we can't comprehend it in our minds but that's god god infinite and remember you your eyes your statue whatever you was you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is expression word actually thought it he spoke it and here you are amen if it isn't if he wasn't in his thinking there's no way at all for you ever be there or he's the one who gives eternal life do you remember how he read the scriptures not him that willeth or him it runs but god and that is predestination might stand true he could choose before any time who god's sovereign in his choosing did you know that god's sovereign who was backed here to tell him a better way to make the world who would dare to tell him he's running his business wrong even the very the very word itself very sovereign even the revelation is sovereign he reveals to whom he will reveal the very revelation itself is sovereign and god that's how people pound the things and jump at things and hitting things not knowing what they're doing god is sovereign in his works now we find him at the beginning is attributes and now you were with him then then is when the book of life comes into view now we read over here in revelations the 13th chapter the eighth verse that the beast that comes upon the earth in these last days will receive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world think of it before jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he came on earth and several thousand years before you come on earth jesus in god's mind died for the sins of the world and the book of life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world that's the bible truth see your name was ordained of god and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you are a part of god when you become a son or a daughter of god just as you are a part of your earthly father that's right you are the male carries the hemoglobin the blood i am on that estonian and the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also so you're all a part of your father glory that lets the denomination out all [Applause] together does god and all the only place notice now his attribute then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us saint john the first chapter and the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where melchizedek is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then the word became flesh and dwelt among us hold that there now notice his his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of theophany i will get to that and prove it in a few minutes the lord willing he was the word a theophany is something that you could not see it could be right here now yet you cannot see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing there's colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to five senses rather and you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see but there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation by television now television does not manufacture a picture a television only channels it in to a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the pictures there to begin with television was here when adam was sharing television was shared when elijah said on mount carmel television was shared with jesus of nazareth walk the shores of galilee but you're just now discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you'd be crazy to have said something like it but now it's become a reality amen and so is it that christ is here the angels of god are here amen amen and someday in the great millennium to come it'll be just for real and television or anything else because they are here amen amen he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he amorphous himself into his servants and it proves himself amen hey man i always feel terrible to stop now we're just gonna go back over it uh slowly and and just fellowship and work uh towards uh a few things to uh really understand but this explains the beginning of our existence and if i would call this i would call it the beginning of our existence so we can understand how that we're here and why that we're here and i i just thought that was beautiful what we just listened to and and and so as we we start out we notice that that brother branham is trying to point out something to us and you can follow these along on the screen up there and we'll start with paragraph 29 and i want to uh uh catch this little is there anybody in the booth uh paragraph 29 of where we just read who is this melchizedek it says now let's get right into the service now quickly turning with me if you will to the book of hebrews now they have a period there but let me read it this way turn quickly with me if you will to the book of hebrews and another revelation on the message okay so we see that what he's going to point out to us here is another revelation that the message was to bring us so part of the message that he was sent to reveal he's now going to reveal this to us so as you're sitting here this is something that he said is to you this is to you i mean it's not about somebody else it's not for anybody else it's for you so there's a revelation that was hit that was hid in this melchizedek so when we talk about who is this malkesada there's a revelation hid in malchezada so that's why we have to know who is this man because if we can understand who this man is then we can get the revelation that's hid in him okay so that that's what he's trying to express to us here is it's not he's just not going to tell us that oh this is who mal kizek it is you've got something no if you follow down as he goes through this message he begins to unfold it and the kind of lay it out there he says so who is this great person he says now that's a question who is this man paragraph a 30. he says who is this man theologians have different ideas but since the opening of the seven seals the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us according to revelations 1-7 all the mysteries that's wrote in this book that's been hid down through the ages reformers to brought out into view by the angel of the last church aid so he's saying here now there's something that this messenger angel is going to reveal to you it's not a theology it's not it's not a matter of putting historical facts together there's a revelation hid in this word for you and it was hid until the seven seals were to open it up and so he he says now he goes on he says so if this person whoever this person is is he still alive hallelujah so he's still alive and he's alive tonight so this if this revelation will if he's still alive tonight because then if he reveals himself then you begin to understand why that god revealed himself and and and and where why where he stood about this great eternal person so he's still alive tonight because the bible said that he had neither father mother and um and and he would have to be an eternal person is that right an eternal person so he could only person that's god because he's the only one that has eternal life so so we know that this person is god and this god is going to be emorphae in other words so we understand that this is a changing god that's going to to change himself so he's going to take off his mask he's what's been hidden he's going to reveal so we understand that in the by by this seventh church age messenger the things about god that were hid are now going to be revealed so he's going to reveal how that we came into existence so if we know how we can came into existence then we will also know how that we're going to end up because he's alpha and omega he's the beginning and the end so if he was word in the beginning then he's word in the end and we're going to start seeing the revelation that's hid in this great person uh malchezadec and and so we we we'll just kind of go through it quickly so he wants to show us that he's a changing god now that's important to us because once we understand that he takes off his mask by the seven seals by the opening of the seven seals he's like the great sculpture he's going to pull the covering off of what that he had in his mind from the beginning what it was that he was creating hold that there what it was what he was creating because that when you see melchizedek you see what it was that he was creating oh that's good to me so he's an unchanging god and so when you know that he's unchanging god then you can understand justification how he changed from justification to sanctification and how he changed from sanctification to the restoration of gifts and then how he changed to the unmasking or uncovering of the mysteries so people they they would come along as we talked before in previous messages that they got to justification and they stop and when he changed they didn't change with them and so that that's where they died they didn't make the change with them now this is part of the revelation that's hidden in melchizedek is making the change with him god's moving he's changing he's changing us right now god's changing us we can't wait for the change we got to be part of the chance and he's moving he's changing he's changing his form so he he's he he's unmasking himself so we understand he's we in one way he's an unchanging god but the change is not in him it's in the portion that he's revealing or the change is in us god is changing us amen he's not going to leave one of us out and so we saw that this change can only to be revealed right and so that's what we preached last wednesday when we began to open the book is that worship comes from revelation and remember if we go back just a page over to page paragraph 45 if you guys wouldn't mind jumping around with me he said notice now he made man and man fail he came down to redeem man because god loves to be worshipped the very word god means object of worship and this is that come amongst us the pillar of fire as something that changes our hearts this come amongst us as the pillar of fire something that changes our hearts so you understand emorphae is going on right now now this revelation is hidden in melchizedek okay so we understand that so god is changing himself and so we understand that he said i can't accept revelation he said then there's no way for god ever to get to you paragraph 37 because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed and debates such as will acceptance this change oh hallelujah the rapture is a revelation this change it's to them that will accept it or learn there be no way for god ever to get to you so you can't worship god unless he reveals himself to you right so you can't really worship god until you know him you're just you're just worshiping an idea you're just worshiping some image that somebody drew up praise god i come out of that about your statues and lighting candles and worship be something you don't know that's the devil but god reveals himself so he can be worshipped and without revelation you can't worship god so you can't worship something that he's not so if you're worshiping three persons or three gods or a trinity you're not worshiping god because that's not what he is so the only way you can truly worship him is to know who he is and he wants to reveal that to you that's what he wants to do i don't care if you're a sinner i don't care if you're a smoker i don't care if you're a drinker i don't care what your past is god this morning wants to reveal himself to you so you too can join in with all those he's revealed himself to and worship him hallelujah now he he does this through this book just saying something and then going back to it saying something and going back to it so you've got to understand here that that his and he goes down and he talks about you have to have revelation then he talks about this person being changing so any morphe if he comes down he says now notice like the sculpture he hides his mask or in other words when you have a statue or something you put a covering over it excuse me until the time of its unveiling okay so we know that he's now going to unveil so what he's going to unveil was what was hid in melkiside so there's a mystery in melchizedek that's been covered up that it wasn't until this time that the revelation of the message would be open and he's going to pull that cover off but here's the key he says paragraph 42 that's what god has done to this age it's been hid and all these things that's been hid are supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible said they would be revealed in the latter time it's like the sculpture keeping his piece of work all covered up until the time and he takes his mask off of it and there it is hallelujah and there it is that got the work that's been covered up and hid since the foundation of the world and its seven mysteries and god's promise in this age of ladies say church age he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it right now again just that jump around a little bit to tie the pieces of the puzzle together let's go back over and so he says this now and he talks about the changing god gaudi morphic and how he wanted to be worshiped paragraph 46 and in the beginning god dwelt alone with his attributes i spoke on this this morning that's his thoughts there's there is was nothing just god alone so he's go we're just going through it slow this morning so in the beginning was god amen god just dwelt alone nobody knew him nobody even knew to think about him in fact there was nobody there to think so something had to come into existence so so he because he loved to work worship he began to come into existence he said and it's just god dwelt alone but he had thoughts it's just like the great architect he sits down he has a thought he can't create but he can take stuff and put it together but god can create that's the difference so this architect god is going to create now the mystery of his creation lies in this melchizedek so let's jump up we're talking about about revelation so let's jump over to the 51st verse so god and morphe god's changing and the only way you can worship him correctly is if he reveals himself to you and he promised to reveal himself all what was covered up from the beginning of the book he's going to pull the covering off but this is the key here he says remember now verse 51 well he talks here let's go to 50 because we all love this verse now remember your eyes your statute whatever you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is an expression word he thought it he spoke it and here you are if it isn't if you wasn't in his thinking there's no way at all for you ever to be there he's the one that gives eternal life now how am i ever going to know that by what revelation so i don't care if you're like the woman at the well she was married five times and when living with a guy like the man that was demon possessed all those people in the bible the great harlot the one that was going to be stoned the condition didn't matter if they got the revelation they were redeemed [Applause] how do you get it he said now remember the scripture read not him that willeth or that him that runeth but god and that his predestination might stand true he could choose before any time god sovereign in his choosing did you know that oh church has got all kinds of rules for the choosing they've got all things you've got to mask up to be chosen they don't understand look at his election is sovereign he's the potter how can the clay say to the potter why how that made me thus [Applause] it's not the church's job to lay the standard it's the church's job to preach the word of god god is a forgiver and when he forgives it's thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more so you don't look to the past you look to the revelation is god trying to reveal to me that i am one of his god is trying to reveal to you that you are one of his thus saith the lord and he predestined might stand true he could choose before any time he chose before there was any time the choice was already made god sovereign in his choosing did you know that god sovereign who was back yonder to tell him a better way to make the world who would dare to tell him he was running his business wrong we do it all the time you shouldn't have picked that one that one's not in he's a believer he's not a believer it's my way or the highway even even the very the very word itself very sovereign even the revelation is sovereign he reveals to whom he will reveal the very revelation itself is sovereign in god god chooses whom he's going to reveal it to and that's what we call the elect the elected are those who receive the revelation the election is not what you're going to be it's the revelation election is in revelation oh i hope i made that clear we say i'm elect i'm chosen no you're elected to receive the revelation if you receive refuse the revelation your name is taken out of the lamb's book of life now nobody likes to hear that part of it but he said when he comes and does these things and you call it beelzebub there's no forgiveness for you in this life or the life to come but remember you can't worship him without revelation you can't be a part of him without revelation so god's sovereign elected god reveals the change to the elect the emorphy the change god changing from justification to sanctification god changing god changing from the great eternal being working towards fast so the the revelation is the revelation of the emorphy or it's the revelation of the changing god so there's a change going on now and we have to have the revelation of the change else we're worshiping for something that he was instead of something that he is and that's what we talked about wednesday night so we find out that he does this and and uh and so we begin to see this these three great states of god these three great emorphas of god we can watch the change now comes down and when we can see this change then we can understand this malkeside so we know that first of all god change changes he doesn't change his person he changes his mask or his covering he had this all in his mind from the beginning so we're going to find our place in this great plan of god so where we come into existence so first of all we know that he was god eternal and and we're again we're going to read here and then jump back and read back so we can put it together so let's turn go to paragraph 55. he says notice now his attributes then the attributes was first god the thought the attributes itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed it secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us saint john first chapter and first verse in the beginning was god so first of all god dwelt alone with his attributes and so what is an attribute an attribute is what makes you what you are it's the identifying characteristics i have certain attributes certain idiosyncrasies certain things that identifies me as who that i am so you recognize me by the attributes you might say that's the grumpiest meanest sharpest preacher i've ever met [Laughter] his fuse is about this short he can't stand lazy people that don't work hard so that was god he was just all by himself the self-existing one and in him are attributes is that right and so he says now notice verse 56 in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word so time began at the expression of god's thoughts the beginning of god's thoughts is when time began so when is time no more at the completion of god's thoughts [Applause] so when he took the covering by the seven seal off what he had in his mind and he was going to reveal it he said time shall be no more [Applause] why because now he's revealing and he's finishing up his plan and he's showing what it was he's revealing the beginning and we've got that part now it's got to emorphy it's got to change from the beginning to the end okay oh i wish i had a vocabulary i probably should have finished school but i'm going to preach this with the 10 words that i have the best i can so he was just alone but he enemy had thoughts right so the second thing that god decided to do was express those thoughts and when the thoughts were expressed it becomes a what a word the word is a thought expressed so when he began to express his thoughts that's when time began what he said right here when the time began it was word before it was word paragraph 56 again before it was word it was attributes a thought then it was expressed the thoughts were expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where melchizedek is melchizedek is the revelation of the expression he is the word that's right he wasn't jesus jesus was another expression of god in flesh this was the secondary expression the thought of god how he appeared to abraham the secondary the expressed word that's why abraham worshiped him he was this theophany he says now working himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met abraham called melchizedek he was the original expression of the thought of god amen okay oh i just can't make it any better so in this expression thought in whatever what melchizedek was that thought became word in other words when he thought his word he didn't think part of the plan he thought the whole plan that's why the color of your hair the color of your eyes the statue were in you were all in that original thought of god so when god when god appeared to abraham in that body that theophany body not the flesh body it was a spirit that couldn't be seen like television he said it's here we can't see that body but it always existed so when he appeared to abraham in that great form were in him then [Music] this is where you come into existence that's what he said you were a thought expressed but you only know that from the viewpoint of your flesh right oh i know i can't express this so he meets abraham right and now brother brahm goes through this little dissertation here about television so abraham's sitting there here comes a man now this is important because if we can follow this man this person who is this man if we can follow this man's journey right how that he created nothing was made everything that was made was made by him that how he appeared to abraham and then how he came in the flesh if we can follow this person all the way down to this age then we know whom we're worshiping [Applause] so he comes before abraham and he said god let's go to the 60th verse where we stop god reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he emorphy himself into his servant and proves himself so this great amorpha this great change that god made so when he had his thoughts in the beginning that thought he expressed and you were in that thought your eyes your color of your skin the color of your hair uh the statue that he gave us you were in him then that's when time began that's when you came into existence so now when he appears to abraham we stop the tape but we're going to close now and we go over to verse verse a paragraph uh let's start in 64. so he's talk he's talking about this some morphe and and so uh we'll pick this up tonight come back through this but just to lay this down for this morning he says now 64. now god in this great stage this stage of his creation later formed into flesh jesus so in that state that he was that person that he was those attribute expressed he later formed himself into jesus from what from the great beginning spirit then come down to be word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke out emorphate later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners now this next verse is the revelation that was hid in melchizedek when abraham meant him he was melchizedek you understand he was not human flesh yet but he was theophany flesh right spirit flesh he could walk through walls he could walk on water who wasn't that walk on water it was melchizedek who walked on water who wasn't that walk to the wall it was melchizedek that walked through the wall why the revelation lies in melchizedek he says he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham hallelujah [Applause] he's revealing to abraham what every son that accepts the promise will be [Applause] that's why he had to reveal himself to abraham in that form so abraham could know what this flesh was going to be [Music] how many of you hate your flesh oh wretched man that i am when i would do good evils with me he redeems you by becoming flesh but he takes you back to theophany that's what abraham saw he saw what he was going to become what abraham's seed was going to become what god had in his mind [Music] [Applause] the final end of every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want to watch how we have to come so god always had this theophany body for us this is what he revealed in malchezad this is the sinless body this is the attributes that i have in my mind expressed this is what every son of abraham will come into that's the final thing so now what's he going to go into he's going to go into why we had to bypass that theophany okay but how when time is no more we start to hear back from it because it's calling us to that perfection first of all god alone secondly he thinks his whole plan from beginning to end he starts expressing it that's where you are and when god expressed the body the being of every son of god he expressed it to be what melchizedek was that's the original expression so when abraham meant god he meant god in his original expression what you really were doing in the beginning the real body he has for you so when this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting for us amen may i just throw in a scripture here in closing go to uh the gospel of saint john first chapter 12th verse now here he is in flesh right jesus he's come down in flesh he he's not in the melchizedek form he's in the form that we are that's what i think about hallelujah showing us that this is in our body this isn't the thought god had of us he just gave us this body so he could express his attributes and we can be tested don't give up on your loved ones don't give up on your loved ones pray for your loved ones that's right amen amen listen but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believed on his name not to become fleshly sons but to become theophany son remember a theophany is a spirit something that you can't see therefore it has to be what reveal let's look at another great scripture philippians 3 and 2 21. look i just like let's read start from the 19th verse talking about the devil whose end is destruction whose god is their belly the whole whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile bodies take it our vile body that it may be fashioned liken unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself so what is he going to do he's going to take this vile body and make it like the body that abraham saw [Applause] that that's what he was revealing in melchizedek this abraham is the body that all your seed is going to receive this is what i have in my thinking this is the real you [Applause] amen now in the next part of this he's going to talk about our journey how we bypass that right but we know at the end time we're starting to hear back from it why are we starting to hear back from it because there's immorphy you're invited into the change praise god he's inviting us into his change the invitation is in his word the invitation is in the revelation the invitation is in the eye salve the invitation is in the goal oh hallelujah we see ourselves in his created state but because we're in this flesh we look through a glass darkling we can only imagine but now he says here's one of the revelations that comes in the opening of the seven seals abraham sat there and saw what the promise of what every one of his children would be i think there's a change coming i think god's immorphy i think that's why he's gathering all of those and putting him under the word of god because the word of god causes transformation amen so we'll stop there that's more than i can grasp who was this man what was the revelation that was hid why is it important to us because when we go back through it and we see what we bypassed and why we bypass it in other words he said the way we had to come well he shows us what we bypass then he's going to show us how we come back to it and we're right at the door now i enjoy the word don't you remember it's hid but revealed if this earthly body be dissolved we already have malkes adapt waiting for us who is malquesada are melchizedek amen hallelujah melchizedek was the revelation of the first true redeemed son of god you could almost say adam was adam was melchizedek when he was male and female together and then god made flesh took eve out that's all part of the plan but it all comes back to what that word was in the express thought god alone god above us right gives great thoughts the word and what has he done in this age why did god send a prophet i know we take a lot of grief for believing in a prophet you know we take it's easy to point to us and and call us a cult but i know one thing he didn't come in word only but he came in power and demonstration of the spirit and that's why he sent a messenger he sent a messenger to reveal melchizedek because melchizedek is who we really are that's what every son of abraham don't you love that statement is it up there put it up there again if you could like 65 paragraph 65 we have that when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham amen [Music] could you imagine abraham looking across it himself because we have to be like our father and abraham's looking there and he knows who this guy is he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart yeah yeah now you can follow it down right this same malkes adapt is going to come back and veil himself in a prophet amen to unveil the mystery of our existence when we come into existence where we come from and where we are going jesus said i come from god i go to god amen back to that great melchizedek that every son and daughter of abraham that's elected this received this revelation will be what was that beautiful revelation held in melkiside amen our alpha and our omega amen lord

forget this day none of us should ever forget this morning and what a great revelation anyway before we read the scriptures chris just wants to say why he's here they'll listen to you but put my life in god's hands i just wanted a change the reason i'm here is my life's not going the way i want it to and i just want change i want good things to happen and i just feel like this is the only way to get and that's about it man that's good enough huh amen let's read in the scriptures therefore therefore let this is acts the second chapter the 36th verse therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up towards generation amen amen that's where we're going here this way our gracious heavenly father this brother has come lord he is not a great student of the word but he's a great student of the conviction of your spirit upon his life lord he knows that you're calling him and he knows that you're dealing with his heart and father we know all that transforming power is in the seed that you've awakened by your word and father so now we're going to baptize him according to the word of god and then according to divine revelation of being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ go into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and on the day of pentecost we recognize that name the lord jesus christ so heavenly father according to your word of god we baptize our brother in the name of the lord jesus christ okay do you want to say anything no you want me to say something for you no our gracious heavenly father according to your word gary wants to be desired your prophet said when the minute they want to be desired you don't delay father he's doing the right thing he wants it to be the guide of his life therefore according to the divine revelation we baptize him in the name of the lord jesus christ by god's grace we'll go a little farther into the message who is this melchizedek i hope you can all
