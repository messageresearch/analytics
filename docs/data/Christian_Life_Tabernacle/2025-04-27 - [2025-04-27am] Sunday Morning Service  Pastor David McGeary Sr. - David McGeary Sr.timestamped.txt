[16:25] Father. And because we know you've done
[16:27] that, Lord, we know that you have
[16:29] something for each and every one of us.
[16:31] So Lord, may we just cast aside all of
[16:33] our thoughts, all of our problems, all

[16:46] sweep through every pew, Lord, touching
[16:49] every heart, Lord. Let our hearts be
[16:51] open, Father. Not one door be closed,
[16:55] Lord. There be things in our life,
[16:57] Father, that you don't approve of, Lord.
[16:59] May you
[17:00] just bring us revelation of that, Lord,
[17:02] so we can work on getting those things
[17:04] out of our lives, Father, and draw
[17:06] closer unto thee. God, may you have your
[17:08] way with this, our pastor this morning,
[17:11] Lord, as he brings forth the message
[17:12] that you placed upon his heart, Lord.
[17:16] Father, just have your way with the song
[17:18] service, Lord, and all the way down
[17:21] through, Lord. And let not one of us
[17:23] leave here this morning without saying,
[17:24] "Did not he speak to us along the way?"
[17:27] Lord, Father, we love you. We give you
[17:30] all the praise, the glory, and the
[17:31] admiration. In the precious and lovely
[17:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.

[52:54] know, all the dignitaries of the world
[52:57] would go to
[53:00] uh see them and and show up to
[53:05] uh you know, give their respects and
[53:08] make their political
[53:11] uh stance, you know, and and uh but yet
[53:14] when Jesus was here, he was raising the
[53:18] dead and feeding thousands and and yet
[53:23] no dignitaries would come at all. Amen.
[53:27] But we certainly want to be ready when
[53:30] he comes back. Amen. That's why we're
[53:33] here this morning, right? we we know
[53:35] that he's coming for us and that we we
[53:38] want to be here. So, we certainly
[53:41] believe that. And we'd like to make a a
[53:45] a few announcements
[53:47] uh uh this morning uh you know, I think
[53:51] one of the best ways to announce
[53:55] something. I think that isn't there a
[53:57] saying that a a picture is worth a a
[54:01] thousand words? Okay. So, I'm gonna make
[54:04] an announcement by way of picture if I
[54:08] could do that. So, it'd make it easy.
[54:11] So, here's my announcement.
[54:16] Like I've always told
[54:17] you, there's literally nothing about you
[54:20] I'd ever change. Will you marry me? Yes.
[54:25] Thank you, baby. Yes. Look at that.
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:41] So now, was that an announcement or
[54:44] what? Amen. Clever and Rebecca, where
[54:47] are you? Are you here? All right. Would
[54:50] you stand up, please? Amen.
[55:02] That's our newly engaged couple. I think
[55:05] they're planning for a maybe a December
[55:08] uh wedding or something. Maybe they want
[55:11] it to be on the 25th or something. No, I
[55:15] I don't I I don't think so. Amen. Amen.
[55:20] We want to
[55:21] um uh just minister a thought on our
[55:26] heart this morning more in a way of an
[55:31] understanding of of a
[55:34] teaching of a remembrance.
[55:38] uh you know it's it's important that
[55:42] um
[55:44] we remember certain things and um uh we
[55:49] started the year and
[55:52] we have had a um a a burden on our heart
[55:58] about the path forward. Okay, we've it's
[56:03] we've been in this message a long time
[56:06] and we want to know what what
[56:11] direction is God wanting the church to
[56:15] go
[56:16] in. And every time there's a
[56:21] time comes on the scene
[56:24] where men and
[56:27] and are
[56:29] wondering what what's the path that God
[56:32] has for us? What what's the journey?
[56:36] Where are we supposed to be? Uh what is
[56:39] supposed to be happening? Uh you know
[56:44] why are we here? And and when when those
[56:47] questions start to
[56:51] arise, people begin to
[56:55] uh come try to come up with
[56:58] answers and many
[57:03] uh leaders will arise to the scene and
[57:07] they will begin to speak out about uh we
[57:12] I think we should go in this direction
[57:14] or I think the church is moving in this
[57:17] direction. That happened in the time of
[57:20] Israel when they were under Roman
[57:22] bondage and they begin to desire
[57:27] uh that something would change and many
[57:31] people came up and they even referred to
[57:34] it. this person rose up and this person
[57:36] rose up and led these people led this
[57:39] way and then then the great uh uh I
[57:43] believe it was Gelia said well if this
[57:46] be of God you know who can stand against
[57:49] it yes many many have come before but if
[57:53] this be of God then it will stand and so
[57:57] uh I I'm I'd like to
[58:01] uh just go down a a little path path
[58:04] with you just for a moment and express
[58:09] some things and my feelings
[58:12] uh
[58:13] about uh part of our path forward, if I
[58:19] could say it that way. So, if we have
[58:22] our Bibles, let's stand and we'll read a
[58:26] couple of scriptures and we'll refer to
[58:30] a few scriptures here and there and
[58:33] we'll try not to be uh uh too
[58:38] long this morning. Uh but one of them's
[58:43] found in just the simple verse in he in
[58:48] Matthew
[58:50] 10 and
[58:54] um
[58:57] uh Matthew 10
[59:01] and7 and just so this is Matthew 10 and7
[59:06] and this is a great uh portion of
[59:12] scripture. I got to get some of the
[59:14] strong deacons to take
[59:17] the caps off these for me. And it says
[59:22] here it says, "And as ye
[59:26] go,
[59:28] preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is
[59:33] at hand." How many believe that? Amen.
[59:38] So, uh, they were speaking of a of an
[59:41] exodus that was trans in that day. And
[59:44] now we're in a day that we're speaking
[59:46] of an exodus. Heal the sick, cleanse the
[59:51] lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils.
[59:55] Freely you have
[59:57] received, freely
[1:00:01] give. Freely you have received, freely
[1:00:05] give.
[1:00:07] And then if you turn over with me to uh
[1:00:13] uh uh second
[1:00:16] Peter the 8th
[1:00:19] uh first chapter of second Peter and the
[1:00:24] eth verse.
[1:00:34] And we know that this is uh
[1:00:38] Peter uh speaking of the statue of a
[1:00:41] perfect man. But we'd like just to pick
[1:00:45] up in the eighth and ninth
[1:00:49] verse. He says, "For if these things be
[1:00:54] in you," then so rem re remember what
[1:00:58] those things are. uh you know uh their
[1:01:04] their you know temperance, patience,
[1:01:06] knowledge, faith, virtue,
[1:01:09] uh uh
[1:01:12] godliness and brotherly kindness. And he
[1:01:14] says, "If these things be in
[1:01:17] you and
[1:01:20] abound, they make you that ye shall
[1:01:23] neither be barren nor
[1:01:26] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:01:30] Jesus Christ. If they
[1:01:32] abound, then uh but he that lackth these
[1:01:38] things is
[1:01:40] blind and cannot see a far
[1:01:44] off and hath
[1:01:46] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:01:50] old sins. Father, we ask you to bless
[1:01:54] your word to us this morning. In Jesus
[1:01:56] precious name we pray. Amen. You may be
[1:02:00] seated.
[1:02:15] I'd like to
[1:02:20] um read some statements to you this
[1:02:24] morning. And this is from a message
[1:02:27] called Convinced and Concerned.
[1:02:30] He says, "And we find today that there
[1:02:36] is is such a falling
[1:02:39] away and it seems to be that people are
[1:02:45] not
[1:02:46] interested like they used to
[1:02:49] be." Now Peter is even speaking here. He
[1:02:55] said, 'If these virtues aren't in in
[1:02:57] you, then you've forgot where you've
[1:03:00] come
[1:03:01] from. And I I think that's a a a really
[1:03:06] important thing about going forward is
[1:03:12] that you never forget where you come
[1:03:15] from because you never want to go back
[1:03:19] to where you've been. That's the whole
[1:03:22] uh if I could say that about the whole
[1:03:25] idea about moving forward is that you
[1:03:29] you're you're leaving those things which
[1:03:32] are behind behind and you're pressing
[1:03:36] for the higher calling. And that's what
[1:03:39] the scripture always admonishes us to
[1:03:42] do. Leave those things which are behind
[1:03:45] behind and press for a higher calling.
[1:03:48] Now, we always take that in our
[1:03:50] favorable stance that we always want to
[1:03:53] leave the bad things that we've done
[1:03:57] behind. We're real quick to say, "I'll
[1:04:00] just leave that behind. I'll just forget
[1:04:02] about that and uh I'm just going to go
[1:04:05] forward. So, I'll just take my eraser
[1:04:09] and wipe it off of the board and and
[1:04:12] then I will go on." But if you if you're
[1:04:15] continually going back to the same
[1:04:19] place, then you would want to take heed
[1:04:24] uh to yourself and say what is maybe
[1:04:27] that's not exactly what I'm leaving
[1:04:32] behind. You know, there might be a
[1:04:34] different cause. There might be a
[1:04:36] different reason. There there might be
[1:04:39] uh something else that's going on in my
[1:04:42] life. and and maybe not so much that
[1:04:46] it's a bad thing, but maybe it's
[1:04:49] something that is not in my life that is
[1:04:53] causing the
[1:04:54] deficiency that I continually find
[1:04:58] myself going back over the same place
[1:05:02] and arriving at the same place and
[1:05:04] finding myself in the same condition.
[1:05:08] And so it might be that there's other
[1:05:11] things that we've got to uh uh take out
[1:05:16] of our lives and maybe replace them with
[1:05:20] something else. uh you know so uh and so
[1:05:25] sometimes leaving something behind it
[1:05:27] doesn't mean that if it's maybe a
[1:05:30] terrible thing that you're leaving
[1:05:32] behind or a evil thing that you're
[1:05:35] leaving behind but maybe you've matured
[1:05:38] past that place and it it's time for you
[1:05:43] to uh as the scripture says to put off
[1:05:46] childless things and as a child I
[1:05:49] thought as a child as I act as a child.
[1:05:52] But now now I'm maturing and I need to
[1:05:56] act more mature. I need to uh handle uh
[1:06:01] uh uh things in maybe a more mature
[1:06:05] manner or I ought to take on the
[1:06:09] responsibility that goes with the the
[1:06:13] place that I am a as a Christian. Or a
[1:06:17] lot of times it you might be to
[1:06:20] understand that uh we have to maybe have
[1:06:25] more
[1:06:26] diligence and and more respect towards
[1:06:30] our uh Christian walk and our Christian
[1:06:34] life
[1:06:36] and and and so when when you come to
[1:06:40] that place that you realize I need to I
[1:06:43] need to make a change. Yes, sir. Well,
[1:06:47] anytime you make a change, you're going
[1:06:49] to leave some things behind and you're
[1:06:53] going to move into other things. And
[1:06:57] this is what we believe. We believe that
[1:06:59] this is a gospel of
[1:07:02] transformation that we didn't come to
[1:07:05] the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:08] and then believe that that wasn't going
[1:07:11] to have any effect on us and and when
[1:07:15] and so when you're on a journey and
[1:07:19] you're you're transforming you're coming
[1:07:22] into new opportunities you're coming
[1:07:24] into new revelations you're coming into
[1:07:27] new enlightenment. ments you're coming
[1:07:29] into new understandings and and all
[1:07:32] those things that God is doing with you
[1:07:36] is so that you will not be barren or
[1:07:39] unfruitful. We understand what the Lord
[1:07:42] gave such the parable of the fig tree uh
[1:07:46] when when there was no fruits there.
[1:07:49] There was no evidence that that tree was
[1:07:55] performing that which it was created to
[1:07:59] perform.
[1:08:02] and and and we take that to heart
[1:08:06] because we believe that that God planted
[1:08:09] a seed in us and the seed that he
[1:08:12] planted us had a purpose and the purpose
[1:08:15] of that seed was to bear fruit.
[1:08:18] And so Peter's telling them, you need
[1:08:21] these virtues. You need to add these
[1:08:23] things to your life. You need to have
[1:08:26] these things abound or in other words in
[1:08:30] practice. If if you don't have these
[1:08:33] virtues and you don't have these fruits
[1:08:36] uh of the spirit in practice, then you
[1:08:39] will be uh barren. You won't be
[1:08:43] fruitful. So, they've got to abound.
[1:08:46] They've got to be alive. And you can't
[1:08:49] forget that. You can't forget that these
[1:08:52] are things that that we have to keep
[1:08:55] alive in our life that we've got to make
[1:08:58] sure that they're there. We've got to
[1:09:01] make sure that they're operating. We've
[1:09:04] got to make sure that that we're in
[1:09:07] possession of them. It is like a man
[1:09:10] that's goes on a job. You know, he's got
[1:09:13] his tools. You've got to make sure that
[1:09:16] you you have your your your tools with
[1:09:19] you to do the job. And there's nothing
[1:09:21] worse when you get on the job and you
[1:09:23] say, "Oh, I left my saw at the other
[1:09:26] job. I left my hammer. Oh, I left my
[1:09:29] laptop at home. I I I left my notes. I
[1:09:32] I've done all these things. And you
[1:09:35] realize that you don't have the tools
[1:09:39] with you to perform the work that has
[1:09:42] been presented before
[1:09:45] you. It's like running out of
[1:09:48] gas. You know, you don't start on a trip
[1:09:51] and and
[1:09:52] and not fill your tank. You know what I
[1:09:56] mean? You should you should check your
[1:09:58] tires. You should fill your tank. You
[1:10:00] should you should make sure you know
[1:10:02] where you're going. You know that you
[1:10:04] you've got
[1:10:06] your navigator. Of course, when I went
[1:10:09] on trips, I used to say, "Do we have the
[1:10:11] map?" You know what I mean? And I sat on
[1:10:14] the side of the road with the map out
[1:10:16] and you know looking at little numbers
[1:10:18] and you know nowadays they tell you but
[1:10:21] you no matter what the tools are you've
[1:10:24] got to have those tools with you in
[1:10:28] order to perform the work that's there
[1:10:31] for you to perform.
[1:10:37] And and so that's what that our heart is
[1:10:43] moved to. Now we could spend a lot of
[1:10:47] time and we have in Christianity spent a
[1:10:51] lot of time going over the tools.
[1:10:55] Do you have this tool? Do you have this
[1:10:57] in your life? Get get these things out
[1:11:00] of your life. Get these things out of
[1:11:02] your life. get your life cleaned up. Get
[1:11:05] this. Have the spirit of God. Do all
[1:11:08] these things. But I I wonder if we've
[1:11:10] ever came down to the time that we're
[1:11:13] going to face the challenge of the work
[1:11:17] that is set before us to do.
[1:11:23] and and we we've kind of come to the
[1:11:28] place I think that and it's a dangerous
[1:11:33] place
[1:11:34] but that we think that just believing
[1:11:39] will get us there.
[1:11:42] I believe this. I believe that. I
[1:11:45] believe this. and and and that was a
[1:11:48] issue that was uh our prophet addressed
[1:11:53] in the message called works is faith
[1:11:56] expressed. He he wanted us to uh
[1:12:00] understand that that uh your faith is
[1:12:04] expressed in the works that you
[1:12:07] do. I believe James spoke it like this.
[1:12:11] Show me your faith without your works.
[1:12:14] And I'll show you my faith by my works.
[1:12:18] Though we're not saved by those works.
[1:12:22] We're saved by the blood of the lamb.
[1:12:25] We're saved by uh the the calling that
[1:12:30] was in our heart, the the revelation
[1:12:33] that our of our election. And and that's
[1:12:37] what has brought us to the place that we
[1:12:42] begin to apply the token to our lives
[1:12:45] and we begin to understand that we
[1:12:48] needed to uh uh uh get right and we
[1:12:53] needed to separate from the world and we
[1:12:56] need to come out from the world and we
[1:12:59] need to be separate and and there's very
[1:13:01] there's many Christians at many
[1:13:03] different walks and stages of life.
[1:13:06] There's people that are still coming out
[1:13:08] of things. You You know what I'm saying?
[1:13:11] Coming out of ideas, coming out of
[1:13:13] teachings, coming out of fears. But but
[1:13:17] the the the most important thing is is
[1:13:20] is that there's a
[1:13:22] transformation going on in us. And you
[1:13:27] it's not just one time,
[1:13:31] you know, but it's a
[1:13:34] continually moving to the become the
[1:13:38] image of the Lord Jesus Christ and that
[1:13:41] that love of God would have its perfect
[1:13:45] work in us and that through that love we
[1:13:49] could say these words as he is so are we
[1:13:53] in this world. And so we're we're
[1:13:58] we're
[1:14:00] realizing
[1:14:02] that that God didn't do all that he's
[1:14:07] doing without a plan and a purpose in
[1:14:12] mind and the part that you as an
[1:14:18] individual play in that plan. Now one
[1:14:22] member of the body can't say I'm not a
[1:14:24] member of that body because the body is
[1:14:28] fitted and joined together. Every member
[1:14:32] supplying the need to the other. We're
[1:14:36] intricately fit together like I referred
[1:14:39] to that great puzzle and we want to be a
[1:14:43] part of the right puzzle. We want to be
[1:14:46] a part of the move of the spirit of God.
[1:14:50] How's the spirit of God moving? Where's
[1:14:52] the spirit of God going? What is it that
[1:14:55] God would have for my life? Look at the
[1:14:58] challenge many of you young people, you
[1:15:01] go to school, you you come to uh uh you
[1:15:06] come to get a job and and and we're
[1:15:09] we're so
[1:15:11] careerorientated, you know, what's my
[1:15:13] career going to be? How am I going to
[1:15:14] support myself? we go to school. And I'm
[1:15:17] not saying that's wrong to be doctors,
[1:15:20] to be nurses, to be computer
[1:15:23] technicians, to to to do all these
[1:15:26] things because we're
[1:15:27] concerned about our success. We're
[1:15:30] concerned about what am I going to be?
[1:15:34] You start asking that question uh real
[1:15:38] early. What do you want to be when you
[1:15:42] grow up? You know, and if you if every
[1:15:45] kid said his dream, our whole world
[1:15:49] would be full of
[1:15:52] firemen. You know, you couldn't light a
[1:15:55] match without there being someone there
[1:15:56] to put it out. Every little boy wants to
[1:15:58] be a fireman. I want to be a fireman.
[1:16:01] maybe a
[1:16:03] policeman, you know, but yet our just
[1:16:07] for some reason our path has moved into
[1:16:11] uh different uh fields and and different
[1:16:15] work as we needed to work to supply. But
[1:16:20] as much as that's a reality that we want
[1:16:24] to grow and mature and and to be
[1:16:28] successful and and and to have a career
[1:16:32] or have a job or or have a a life that
[1:16:36] provides a home and shelter and food for
[1:16:40] us, whatever path that you you've taken.
[1:16:44] But yet there's a path for the believer.
[1:16:49] As much as you would have there to be uh
[1:16:55] your natural work, God has a spiritual
[1:16:59] work for the
[1:17:01] church. And that spiritual work has been
[1:17:08] replaced with the
[1:17:11] thinking that it's just by
[1:17:16] believing that we get in.
[1:17:19] And I want to walk that line with you
[1:17:22] for a moment and bring to you some
[1:17:25] things that stood out to me because I
[1:17:28] don't want us to forget who that we are
[1:17:33] and what it is that we're
[1:17:35] confessing. And and that's the worst
[1:17:38] thing that can happen. You you won't go
[1:17:41] forward if you forget where you've been.
[1:17:46] You have no reference point.
[1:17:51] You know, just like I remember I was on
[1:17:54] a trip with the brother and and Leslie
[1:17:57] and I and and uh we were going from this
[1:18:00] certain place
[1:18:02] and and we we went down. We made a turn
[1:18:05] on this highway and we drove for about
[1:18:08] an hour, hour and a
[1:18:10] half and then we got on another road and
[1:18:13] we're coming down and finally we came by
[1:18:16] and passed a sign that said 11 miles to
[1:18:20] such and such and that was 11 miles from
[1:18:24] where we left an hour and a half
[1:18:29] ago. Now you say what? But if we
[1:18:32] wouldn't have
[1:18:33] known that's where we came from, we
[1:18:37] wouldn't have known how lost
[1:18:40] we
[1:18:42] were. And every
[1:18:46] believer has got to put landmarks down
[1:18:50] in your life of the time that you've
[1:18:53] been transformed or the time that God
[1:18:57] has done something for you.
[1:18:59] And we don't forget those things. We had
[1:19:03] testimony uh from the meeting and last
[1:19:06] week and people began to testify of
[1:19:09] things that God had done in their lives.
[1:19:12] And if you don't testify of those
[1:19:14] things, you will forget them.
[1:19:19] And that was one of God's greatest
[1:19:21] complaints about Israel is that they
[1:19:23] forgot where they come from. They forgot
[1:19:26] what that he's done for them. Um, I I
[1:19:29] like what David says. Uh, uh, let me see
[1:19:34] if I'll just see if I can find it real
[1:19:36] quick for you. It's in uh Psalms uh
[1:19:41] 119. So, that was the psalm I always
[1:19:44] thought. I hope Mike doesn't decide to
[1:19:46] read Psalm
[1:19:48] 119 this morning, but Psalm
[1:19:52] 119 and I believe it's verse
[1:19:56] uh
[1:19:58] uh 92
[1:20:04] uh I'll just read it from 89. They could
[1:20:07] put it up there. Psalm uh 119.
[1:20:13] Verse
[1:20:14] 89. Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled
[1:20:18] in
[1:20:19] heaven. Thy faithfulness is unto all
[1:20:24] generations. Thou hath established the
[1:20:28] earth and it abideth.
[1:20:32] David is saying, "Look right here. We
[1:20:34] could and and Paul comes back and he
[1:20:36] says,"The invisible things of God are
[1:20:39] clearly seen by the visible things
[1:20:42] around us. We should look up in the sky
[1:20:45] at night and know there's a God."
[1:20:49] And so he goes on to
[1:20:52] say, he
[1:20:54] says, "They continue this day according
[1:20:59] to thy
[1:21:01] ordinances, for all are thy
[1:21:05] servants." What a beautiful thing. Now
[1:21:09] listen to this. what he says. Unless thy
[1:21:14] law had been my
[1:21:19] delight, I should then have perished in
[1:21:23] my
[1:21:26] afflictions. Unless your law was my
[1:21:29] delight, I would have perished. He's not
[1:21:32] forgetting.
[1:21:34] He says, "I will never forget thy
[1:21:38] precepts,
[1:21:40] for with them thou hast quickened me."
[1:21:51] I am thine.
[1:21:53] Save
[1:21:55] me, for I have sought thy precepts."
[1:22:00] What a what a
[1:22:03] beautiful understanding of the
[1:22:06] importance to
[1:22:09] remember where that you've come
[1:22:12] from. to
[1:22:14] remember that that you you have a
[1:22:21] calling, that you have an
[1:22:23] election, that you've been chosen, that
[1:22:27] it it's it it's a privilege to have been
[1:22:31] chosen. It's a privilege to have heard
[1:22:34] the word of God. And when when
[1:22:38] we forget those
[1:22:42] things, Peter said we become
[1:22:44] barren and we become
[1:22:47] unfruitful and we and that's what he
[1:22:50] said that the time would come that those
[1:22:52] would be chopped down and and throwed
[1:22:56] into the fire. So our prophet is
[1:22:59] beginning to approach this. Now we we we
[1:23:03] have quite a testimony this morning and
[1:23:07] that's why we testify. We testify to
[1:23:10] keep things alive in our life. If when
[1:23:14] when you give a testimony, you watch
[1:23:17] what it does for you, just testify that
[1:23:19] something that God done for you five
[1:23:22] years ago, 10 years ago, it's like re
[1:23:24] being rejuvenated. You know, you get you
[1:23:27] get excited again. You know that he's
[1:23:29] real. You know he's alive. You know what
[1:23:31] he did with you. He's back on your mind
[1:23:34] and you're conscious of
[1:23:36] them. You know, you you never want to
[1:23:39] forget people that maybe some tragedy
[1:23:43] thing has happened. Uh some maybe a uh
[1:23:46] somebody was kidnapped or something and
[1:23:49] people will put up posters, they'll put
[1:23:51] up websites because they never want that
[1:23:54] person to be forgotten. And and that's
[1:23:57] what Israel purposed in their heart.
[1:23:59] They purposed that they were never going
[1:24:01] to let the world forget the
[1:24:04] Holocaust. They have museums. They have
[1:24:07] pictures. They have monuments. They they
[1:24:10] keep it alive in the minds of the
[1:24:13] people. Don't
[1:24:15] forget that there was two million of us
[1:24:20] killed. And Israel doesn't
[1:24:23] forget. They're not going to
[1:24:26] forget what what's come. Just like
[1:24:28] they're purposed in their heart, they're
[1:24:30] not going to forget. I believe it was
[1:24:32] October 7th when there was a massacre.
[1:24:35] They're not going to forget
[1:24:38] that. And they'll pour revengeance out.
[1:24:42] They'll bring it up. They're continue.
[1:24:44] They're not going to let it go by the
[1:24:47] wayside. It's not going to be forgotten.
[1:24:53] And how much more
[1:24:56] should we not forget?
[1:24:58] what God has done for us because once
[1:25:02] you forget, you go a drift.
[1:25:09] You just start drifting.
[1:25:12] You you you you don't have no bearings.
[1:25:15] You don't have no markers. You don't
[1:25:17] have no remembrance. You you you know,
[1:25:20] you can't you don't remember what the
[1:25:21] Lord's done for you. Remember this day.
[1:25:24] Amen. The scripture says, "Remember that
[1:25:28] was what the Passover was about.
[1:25:30] Remember, never forget the day that God
[1:25:34] delivered you from Egypt and this
[1:25:37] bondage that came from you." We ought
[1:25:39] never to forget the day that God set us
[1:25:42] free.
[1:25:46] But when we forget those things and we
[1:25:50] forget all the markers all down life, we
[1:25:53] forget that we are we forget our own
[1:25:56] testimony. I'm the bride of Jesus
[1:26:00] Christ. We forget the reverence to the
[1:26:03] house of the Lord. I I don't say much on
[1:26:06] these things and you know that but I see
[1:26:10] people staggering to church 30 minutes
[1:26:12] late all casual you know just talking
[1:26:15] all down the outside of the church till
[1:26:18] they get in they stroll and they flop
[1:26:20] down I just think
[1:26:24] Lord you know I don't know what they're
[1:26:26] here for
[1:26:29] I want to let the deacon say we got
[1:26:31] another wife
[1:26:33] looker you know they're only here to
[1:26:35] look at the see if they can find a
[1:26:38] sister or
[1:26:41] something. Big warning to you
[1:26:45] sisters. You know, if some guy just
[1:26:47] shows up, he don't have a long long
[1:26:49] history of serving God, you just put a
[1:26:52] big old circle with a line in it. You
[1:26:58] know, I ought to have a a deacon back
[1:27:01] there with a buzzard and, you know, and
[1:27:04] one of these buzzards comes in all late
[1:27:07] walking in the church, you know, so cool
[1:27:09] and just
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:13] bang, I got one
[1:27:15] question. Are they late to work? No.
[1:27:20] Because they want that carnal reward.
[1:27:23] Well, they they're they want that dollar
[1:27:25] bill, you know, that I make. They they
[1:27:28] they want to be successful. Well, we
[1:27:31] come to church to be successful.
[1:27:36] Peter said, "Stir up their minds by way
[1:27:40] of remembrance.
[1:27:43] Don't don't let don't let us forget the
[1:27:46] responsibility that we have for the
[1:27:48] gospel.
[1:27:50] What it is that we're reflecting, what
[1:27:53] it is our lives are reflecting. We we
[1:27:55] claim to be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:01] That I mean this let's just think of
[1:28:04] what it is that proceeds out of our
[1:28:07] mouth
[1:28:09] and the claim that we make. be
[1:28:16] elected the the the people that
[1:28:21] house the eternal thoughts of God and
[1:28:25] the seed of
[1:28:27] God. And then we
[1:28:30] forget that our lives ought to identify
[1:28:35] with our confession
[1:28:39] which we used to call our
[1:28:42] testimony. Believers used to protect
[1:28:44] their testimony.
[1:28:46] They wouldn't
[1:28:48] lie for anything
[1:28:52] because honesty was the first sign of a
[1:28:55] Christian.
[1:28:57] And and believers used to protect their
[1:29:00] testimony. They they wouldn't drink. I I
[1:29:03] I remember we wouldn't, you know, we
[1:29:06] used to make sure they took the anything
[1:29:09] the wine glasses off our table. We
[1:29:12] wouldn't want anybody to think it was
[1:29:17] wine, you know. Then they wanted to
[1:29:19] serve CocaCola. And I mean, we used to
[1:29:22] be so
[1:29:23] concerned that we made sure they bring
[1:29:26] us a regularl looking glass cuz we
[1:29:28] didn't want anybody to think we were
[1:29:31] over there drinking
[1:29:35] wine. And what were those days? We we
[1:29:38] never we were always careful the sisters
[1:29:42] were that when they sat down that their
[1:29:44] dresses were long enough to cover their
[1:29:47] knees when they were sitting. They never
[1:29:50] wanted anything tight that would show
[1:29:52] any strap or anything through their
[1:29:56] garment. There was a
[1:29:58] consciousness of
[1:30:00] holiness that was around this message
[1:30:03] when we first got into it because we re
[1:30:07] remembered what we stood for.
[1:30:11] Even the early Pentecostal church, they
[1:30:14] wouldn't listen to no boogie woogie.
[1:30:16] They wouldn't go to no dances. They
[1:30:17] wouldn't do nothing because their
[1:30:20] testimony was everything to
[1:30:24] them. Now our testimony is intellect.
[1:30:30] This is what I
[1:30:33] believe. And nobody cares about nobody's
[1:30:36] life. You lay all your doctrines and
[1:30:39] there's not you can take the doctrines
[1:30:41] of William Brandham and the scriptures
[1:30:44] and it'll defeat any other doctrine
[1:30:46] because it's truth.
[1:30:49] But that isn't attributed to you.
[1:30:55] The truth stands on its own. It's a
[1:31:01] consciousness of your testimony.
[1:31:05] The scripture says, "No man lightth a
[1:31:07] candle and put it under a bushel
[1:31:10] basket." You don't want to create your
[1:31:12] own bushel basket.
[1:31:15] You don't want to be to the place where
[1:31:18] you're ashamed.
[1:31:20] Paul says, "I'm not ashamed." you you
[1:31:23] can't you where all of a sudden you
[1:31:25] can't stand up and make a statement and
[1:31:28] make a stand because everybody around
[1:31:31] you will remember the things that you
[1:31:33] said in the past.
[1:31:35] When you read those scriptures, James,
[1:31:37] he talked about bridling the tongue.
[1:31:41] You know, I mean, these guys talked
[1:31:42] about all these ways that a Christian
[1:31:45] lived and how important it was to their
[1:31:49] lives that they didn't
[1:31:56] forget. And you know, pretty soon we
[1:32:00] just we don't think we just think we
[1:32:04] we're there and it's all settled.
[1:32:08] It's nice to have that comfort, but it's
[1:32:11] not nice to live that way.
[1:32:16] You want to continually
[1:32:18] be contending for a higher calling, a
[1:32:23] greater Christianity. Now, I'd like to
[1:32:26] go over this with you, and that's the
[1:32:28] basis because I've had
[1:32:31] a a burden on my heart, and I I
[1:32:35] finally I just felt the spirit led me to
[1:32:39] this
[1:32:40] place to where I began to find some of
[1:32:43] the
[1:32:45] answers. And you know what I believe? I
[1:32:48] believe the answers have been stored up
[1:32:50] for us in the word of God.
[1:32:55] I don't believe there's another voice,
[1:32:57] another
[1:32:59] message, but I believe that if the
[1:33:03] spirit can move on
[1:33:06] us, it's not moving on the ministry.
[1:33:09] This is the bride
[1:33:11] age. This is where every
[1:33:16] individual has access to the bridegroom.
[1:33:22] You can listen and hear the word of God
[1:33:24] for yourself.
[1:33:28] Now let's go back and let's read through
[1:33:31] this uh with
[1:33:34] me. He says, "We find today that there's
[1:33:37] such a falling away. It seems to be that
[1:33:40] people are just not interested like they
[1:33:43] used to be. They are falling away from
[1:33:48] the fundamental facts of the
[1:33:56] Bible. How many knows the fundamental
[1:34:00] facts of the
[1:34:02] Bible? What a what a
[1:34:06] question. You know, a lot of you you
[1:34:09] can't build your experience on
[1:34:11] secondhand revelation.
[1:34:14] You can't go forward just coming and
[1:34:18] listening to people preach to you over
[1:34:20] the pulpit. You've got to work your own
[1:34:24] salvation out with fear and trembling.
[1:34:27] You've got to make yourself go forward
[1:34:31] in your heart with God.
[1:34:35] No matter what the trials, no matter
[1:34:38] you've got to settle this thing that
[1:34:40] God, if God be for you, who can be
[1:34:43] against
[1:34:46] you? He said the fundamental facts of
[1:34:48] the Bible, they are seem to be drifting.
[1:34:56] Now, when you're
[1:34:58] drifting, you're tossed to and fro by
[1:35:02] every wind of doctrine, every
[1:35:05] circumstance that comes up, every
[1:35:07] situation that rises up, every little
[1:35:11] storm that blows in, every little thing.
[1:35:14] It just it moves you to one side, it
[1:35:17] moves you back to the other. and and you
[1:35:20] you you don't it just seems like you you
[1:35:23] lose the deadon precision
[1:35:28] to move
[1:35:30] forward and we don't want to lose that.
[1:35:34] We want to know a way forward. We don't
[1:35:36] want to be continually
[1:35:39] drifting in the same doctrines, the same
[1:35:43] messages, the same
[1:35:45] sermons. Just let's hear it again. Let's
[1:35:49] hear it again. Let's hear it
[1:35:52] again. What What What does
[1:35:57] God want for me? And is he speaking to
[1:36:03] me? All of you should have a place. I
[1:36:06] should also have a place, have an
[1:36:10] atmosphere, have a time that we set
[1:36:13] aside for God to speak to us.
[1:36:20] hear ye
[1:36:23] him. And and and you you don't just
[1:36:27] congregate and say, "I'm just going to
[1:36:29] hear the message. I'm just going to hear
[1:36:31] what I believe, and the brother's going
[1:36:33] to go back over what I believe and what
[1:36:36] I believe and and as long as he's saying
[1:36:38] what I believe, I think I'm okay."
[1:36:42] That's not the point. The point is, what
[1:36:44] would you have me to do?
[1:36:50] And you seek that path individually and
[1:36:54] God the great conductor will orchestrate
[1:36:57] it and put it all together into one
[1:37:00] beautiful
[1:37:03] music
[1:37:05] that they're drifting. And I think all
[1:37:09] of the ministers who love the word of
[1:37:12] God and know that that is the only
[1:37:18] standard in which we can be sure that
[1:37:22] we're right is upon not some theory but
[1:37:26] upon the word of God.
[1:37:30] He says, and he goes on, he says, "Today
[1:37:35] we
[1:37:37] find though that people get away. They
[1:37:41] get away from the word."
[1:37:45] Now listen, as I I I I want to maybe
[1:37:52] help see help share with
[1:37:55] you maybe my heart in a way. But he says
[1:37:59] that they get away from the word. They
[1:38:03] get away from the
[1:38:07] interest. Others are not interested in
[1:38:11] the word.
[1:38:13] They get away from the interest. They
[1:38:15] get away from what's he saying? What's
[1:38:18] teaching? What's what's in here? Speak
[1:38:20] to me.
[1:38:22] They lose their
[1:38:24] enthusiasm. Now, remember the point that
[1:38:26] we're making these for is when that
[1:38:28] starts to happen to you, you go into a
[1:38:31] drift.
[1:38:35] And and when you're drifting and you
[1:38:39] don't know where you are and you don't
[1:38:41] know what's going on in your life, you
[1:38:44] become more susceptible to attack.
[1:38:49] And that's what the prophet of God said
[1:38:51] happened to the United States in World
[1:38:53] War II at Pearl Harbor. They got so
[1:38:56] lazy, they got so worldly, they got so
[1:38:59] minded that they didn't think anybody
[1:39:02] would attack. There was no need to keep
[1:39:04] the weapons up. There's no need to keep
[1:39:07] the guns up. No need to keep the
[1:39:09] military up. No need to do this. No need
[1:39:12] to do that. And then everything just got
[1:39:15] laxed. And then all of a sudden bombs
[1:39:19] started falling out of the
[1:39:22] sky and they found out they had their
[1:39:24] whole Pacific fleet in one harbor and
[1:39:28] they're all partying.
[1:39:34] And it it just because they didn't do
[1:39:38] due diligence.
[1:39:40] It we call it periodical maintenance.
[1:39:44] You know, you change the oil on the car,
[1:39:46] you change your tires on the car, you
[1:39:48] you do certain things for your car and
[1:39:50] you'll get a 100,000 miles out of it.
[1:39:53] Never ch change the oil. Never change
[1:39:55] the add antifreeze. Never get your
[1:39:59] tires. You know what? you'll have in
[1:40:00] three or four years is a
[1:40:02] wreck and then it won't get you down the
[1:40:05] road and then you're wondering
[1:40:07] everything that you should
[1:40:10] do. I'll just throw this in there
[1:40:13] because I'm in the mood to just like
[1:40:15] paying tithes.
[1:40:18] It ru you just ruin your finances when
[1:40:22] you don't.
[1:40:24] Amen. I remember Leslie and I we be I
[1:40:27] told you this story many times. I'm 80 I
[1:40:30] don't know $80 a week or something. You
[1:40:32] know, I thought that's pretty
[1:40:35] good. You guys spend that at McDonald's
[1:40:38] now. You know what I
[1:40:40] mean? And and our rent went up $20 and
[1:40:44] everything. And then we got down. We you
[1:40:46] know, we needed tires and we get can't
[1:40:49] buy t can't buy a tire. We'd buy a
[1:40:52] tire and then we buy another tire, you
[1:40:57] And when you do that, then they you're
[1:40:58] just wearing them out all the time. So
[1:41:00] then we went to buying two
[1:41:02] tires. Put the two best tires this place
[1:41:05] and back and forth. But remember, we had
[1:41:07] to buy tires. And so we just said,
[1:41:09] "Well, we're going to pay our ties." So
[1:41:11] we paid our ties. I pay $8 or whatever
[1:41:13] it was. But you know, we
[1:41:16] got oh, I don't know, a hundred,000
[1:41:19] miles out of a pair of tires.
[1:41:22] That's the kind of God we serve.
[1:41:27] You know, when you put God first,
[1:41:30] everything else is added unto you.
[1:41:33] That's a
[1:41:34] fundamental fact
[1:41:37] of the Bible.
[1:41:39] Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[1:41:44] He says they get away from the
[1:41:48] interest. There seems not to be very
[1:41:51] much interest in it. We find that
[1:41:55] amongst even our own
[1:41:57] people, the full gospel people, that
[1:42:02] we've come to a spot that we are over
[1:42:08] fed. Now, I'm going to I'm going to say
[1:42:10] something here in a moment, and I I hope
[1:42:13] that I don't get eaten alive for it.
[1:42:18] He says, "Now a person gets
[1:42:22] overfed, gets drowsy,
[1:42:25] lazy."
[1:42:27] Our doctor friends there could surely
[1:42:31] tell you that if you've
[1:42:35] overeaten and I think we Pentecostal
[1:42:38] people have
[1:42:40] overeaten. We've seen so many great
[1:42:43] things till it's becomes common to us.
[1:42:47] You see
[1:42:50] now that
[1:42:52] is quite a
[1:42:55] statement that we've over
[1:42:58] eaten and you know there there
[1:43:02] there's questions that arise and I'm not
[1:43:06] I'm not criticizing anybody and I'm
[1:43:09] certainly not criticizing the
[1:43:13] feeling but that's a remarkable
[1:43:16] statement.
[1:43:18] And I'd like to go go down further with
[1:43:20] it as we read on and I hope that you can
[1:43:23] follow and then go read it for
[1:43:24] yourselves.
[1:43:26] But sometimes the question
[1:43:28] arises, you know,
[1:43:30] that that because of this lack of
[1:43:36] interest, people would say that that the
[1:43:40] supernatural is under
[1:43:42] attack and that that there doesn't seem
[1:43:47] to be
[1:43:48] any supernatural movement.
[1:43:51] But
[1:43:52] yet we that's all that we want to
[1:43:56] see. You know what I mean? It's not a
[1:43:59] meeting if there's not some
[1:44:02] supernatural something go on or or some
[1:44:06] shout of the spirit or of some uh
[1:44:10] movement of of some sort. and and we've
[1:44:14] just got to we've got just to have to
[1:44:16] have more and more and more until that
[1:44:20] we we actually the prophet of God said I
[1:44:23] think the problem is we've got overfed.
[1:44:28] Now, that's a remarkable
[1:44:33] statement and it it
[1:44:35] it sobered me
[1:44:39] because that's all that it seemed that I
[1:44:43] was interested in doing was working it
[1:44:46] up, trying to get more supernatural,
[1:44:49] trying to create more faith. Believe for
[1:44:51] this, believe for that, believe for
[1:44:53] this. If you had faith, you could do
[1:44:55] this. God can do anything. God can
[1:44:57] deliver you. God can do that. And it
[1:45:00] it's always this. Let's feed this to
[1:45:02] you. Let's feed this to you until
[1:45:04] everybody's heard so much of
[1:45:09] it that it doesn't do
[1:45:12] anything. Everybody's a drift.
[1:45:16] Their
[1:45:19] expectation has already been set in
[1:45:22] their
[1:45:23] mind when they arrive on the
[1:45:27] scene. There's no openness. There's no
[1:45:30] wonderment. There's no
[1:45:34] interest. It It's put the
[1:45:39] church in a very sad condition.
[1:45:50] just overfed.
[1:45:53] We've got so much revelation, we don't
[1:45:56] know what to do with
[1:46:00] it. Will you follow with me?
[1:46:05] You know, I I
[1:46:06] mean, I'm not preaching to anybody but
[1:46:09] us here this morning. I don't know who
[1:46:12] watches. I don't know who uh listens in,
[1:46:17] but he tells this story and and and I
[1:46:22] want you to think about this in context.
[1:46:26] It's like it was and you've all heard
[1:46:27] the story, but I'll read it anyway. It's
[1:46:30] like was told one time in England that
[1:46:32] there was a
[1:46:33] poet who wrote the
[1:46:36] poem of how beautiful the sea was and
[1:46:40] the sea gulls and how it reflected its
[1:46:44] beauty in the sky and
[1:46:46] itself. And so he was going to never
[1:46:50] seen the sea. But one day he was on the
[1:46:53] road down to the seashore. And on his
[1:46:56] road down, he meant an old what we would
[1:47:00] call an old salt or old
[1:47:03] sailor. And he said, "Where goest thou,
[1:47:06] my good man?" And he said, "I am a poet.
[1:47:10] I have wrote of the
[1:47:12] sea." And said, "I have never seen it as
[1:47:18] yet. I've only written on what I have
[1:47:24] read about.
[1:47:28] What a
[1:47:32] condition that can happen to us right
[1:47:35] here,
[1:47:37] sitting right here that we can actually
[1:47:41] get
[1:47:42] fed so much that there's no interest in
[1:47:48] experiencing it for yourself.
[1:47:54] The singing's
[1:47:57] enough, the worship's
[1:47:59] enough, the words
[1:48:03] enough, and we get
[1:48:06] sleepy. Spiritually
[1:48:09] overfed, spiritually
[1:48:12] sleepy. Do you
[1:48:15] you
[1:48:17] understand what I'm saying? No, I'm not
[1:48:20] saying this in judgment.
[1:48:23] I'm not saying it as an accusation.
[1:48:27] I'm saying it as our prophets teaching
[1:48:31] us and warning us that when the
[1:48:35] condition
[1:48:37] arises that we can recognize it
[1:48:44] and we can find out what is the cure.
[1:48:50] What's the answer? What's our path
[1:48:54] forward? Because what's happened? We've
[1:48:57] wanted the supernatural so bad that
[1:49:01] we're starting to create it.
[1:49:06] We're starting to want to make things
[1:49:08] happen.
[1:49:11] We want to
[1:49:13] uh make things find their place. We want
[1:49:17] to have prophecies. We want to have
[1:49:19] worships. We we want to have music. We
[1:49:23] want to have specials. And I I'm telling
[1:49:26] you, every time I I don't know all those
[1:49:29] three girls were that same, but I'm
[1:49:31] sitting back going, "My goodness, we got
[1:49:32] so much talent in this church that why
[1:49:36] preach. Let's just have song service all
[1:49:39] the time."
[1:49:41] You know what I'm saying? And then and
[1:49:44] it's it's satisfying.
[1:49:49] You understand? I could I could I can
[1:49:51] come here and listen to some of these
[1:49:54] specials and the worship and absolutely
[1:49:57] my soul gets satisfied.
[1:50:01] I would have never ever described that,
[1:50:04] brother Matt, as getting overfed,
[1:50:10] making me sleepy,
[1:50:13] and causing me to drift.
[1:50:20] That's sobering.
[1:50:31] I'm going down now to have my first
[1:50:35] experience. I want to
[1:50:37] smell the brime waters. I want to hear
[1:50:42] the call of the seagull as it circles in
[1:50:46] the air and see it frolicking waves as
[1:50:52] it throws its white caps and the blue
[1:50:55] skies reflect itself unto the water.
[1:51:00] Nobody can. That's a prophet speaking.
[1:51:04] That is poetry beyond poetry right
[1:51:07] there. That's gorgeous. And I believe
[1:51:10] that
[1:51:12] tonight that's a whole
[1:51:15] lot the matter with our churches in our
[1:51:20] full gospel ranks here in
[1:51:23] America. We have seen so much of the
[1:51:28] goodness of God till it has become
[1:51:31] common to us. We just don't respect it
[1:51:36] like we should.
[1:51:39] We think we do, but really I believe
[1:51:45] that we should give more earnest
[1:51:49] heed to that which we have heard, lest
[1:51:54] at any
[1:51:55] time we should let it slip. Now, I
[1:51:59] believed that's the truth.
[1:52:06] So, we've heard
[1:52:10] things, but we we fail to give those
[1:52:15] things the earnest heed. And you
[1:52:18] understand what uh when you heed
[1:52:20] something, in other words, you learn to
[1:52:23] hear the
[1:52:25] warning that's in them. How can two walk
[1:52:30] together unless they agree?
[1:52:33] A believer is not unequally
[1:52:38] yolked. A good
[1:52:41] soldier entangleth them not in the
[1:52:44] affairs of the world. All all these
[1:52:48] things, the fundamental facts of the
[1:52:51] Bible, they go unheeded.
[1:52:55] In other words, the warning has become
[1:52:58] part of our
[1:53:00] teaching, part of our doctrine.
[1:53:04] It becomes part of our language, part of
[1:53:06] our personality, part of our speech. And
[1:53:10] we just rattle him off as things that we
[1:53:13] believe. We believe this. We believe a
[1:53:16] soldier shouldn't be entangled in the
[1:53:18] things of the world. We believe we
[1:53:20] shouldn't be equally ill. But th those
[1:53:22] things now move out of
[1:53:28] practice because they're not
[1:53:31] heated. When you come in contact with
[1:53:34] somebody, you don't think I'm not
[1:53:36] equally yolked to this
[1:53:39] person. I'm not going to do this with
[1:53:43] this person or I'm not going to get
[1:53:46] involved in that.
[1:53:49] Whether it's a spat at work, whether
[1:53:51] it's a movement, whether it's a whatever
[1:53:54] it might be, if you there's a heed in
[1:53:58] you,
[1:54:00] something that you're conscious of,
[1:54:02] something that you're living by, you
[1:54:05] say, "I'm not I don't do this."
[1:54:09] And that starts to slip away.
[1:54:14] And and then you then we
[1:54:19] drift and and and then pretty soon we
[1:54:23] don't have
[1:54:25] bearings. And and the worst thing that
[1:54:29] happens is pretty soon we believe
[1:54:32] everything and stand for nothing.
[1:54:41] We don't want to have music
[1:54:44] standards because some like this music
[1:54:46] and some like that music and
[1:54:49] and some is this way. I remember there
[1:54:53] was a time that everybody wanted to sing
[1:54:56] this
[1:54:56] song and uh so I I went and looked it up
[1:55:00] and when I saw the
[1:55:02] group I said I'm not we're not going to
[1:55:05] sing that song. And I had them some
[1:55:08] people get pretty
[1:55:10] frosty
[1:55:13] upset, you know, and I won't come out
[1:55:16] biting unless
[1:55:18] you back me in a corner real bad. And I
[1:55:22] I don't ever pull down on my divine
[1:55:24] authority.
[1:55:28] But if I think it's necessary for the
[1:55:32] flock, I'll kill the wolf.
[1:55:39] I thought it's the identity.
[1:55:44] But we used to be real
[1:55:46] careful. Now we don't even run the
[1:55:48] process of
[1:55:51] identification. Okay. Do we want to be
[1:55:55] representing this
[1:55:56] song from this group and incorporating
[1:56:01] it in to our worship?
[1:56:07] In other words, they they wouldn't eat
[1:56:08] meat sacrificed unto
[1:56:13] idols. There was the
[1:56:16] principle of
[1:56:19] identification. There was the taking
[1:56:21] heed to
[1:56:23] that. Now, we're saying these things
[1:56:27] because these are the things that are
[1:56:30] keeping us from going forward.
[1:56:34] Another we're missing what it is, what
[1:56:39] the path
[1:56:40] is laid for us
[1:56:43] forward. We we've been thinking the path
[1:56:48] is supernatural, supernatural,
[1:56:51] supernatural, supernatural.
[1:56:53] Now, the prophet of God said, "You're
[1:56:58] overfed and you become
[1:57:01] lazy and you've drifted and you've got
[1:57:05] away from
[1:57:06] principles and everything's creeping
[1:57:10] in. Things are out of order. People
[1:57:12] don't come to church on time. They don't
[1:57:14] give their offerings. They don't do
[1:57:16] those other things that are required to
[1:57:18] do. They don't pray for service."
[1:57:24] Why? We're
[1:57:29] believers. We got so much fat on us. We
[1:57:32] could live for a long
[1:57:36] time. I could probably live 30 days and
[1:57:39] got still not be skin and bones, not eat
[1:57:43] for 30
[1:57:45] days. Is this what we want to be?
[1:57:52] Is this what I want to
[1:57:54] be?
[1:57:57] No. I want to have a greater
[1:58:01] reality of a living God in our life. And
[1:58:04] I'm beginning to see what it is that
[1:58:07] he's trying to point out to
[1:58:11] us. It It's a little late, I know, but
[1:58:15] I'm going to finish.
[1:58:20] Now I I like how
[1:58:22] that
[1:58:24] he brings
[1:58:29] this. He
[1:58:31] says he's going to give a for instance
[1:58:34] and when maybe for
[1:58:37] instance one single act of God here
[1:58:42] probably you would walk out and say well
[1:58:45] that was all right.
[1:58:51] Hey, he's saying for instance, in other
[1:58:54] words, to make his point, if we done one
[1:58:57] miracle
[1:58:59] tonight, we would say, "Oh, that was all
[1:59:02] right. That's pretty
[1:59:04] good." You
[1:59:06] know, I haven't had bread in about six
[1:59:11] weeks. You know how much I crave a piece
[1:59:13] of bread?
[1:59:17] I drive by doughnut shops and slow down
[1:59:20] and look at
[1:59:26] them. You know what I
[1:59:28] mean? So, we we'd probably say if
[1:59:32] something was done, that's all right.
[1:59:36] That's good. What we expect
[1:59:40] that? Bear with me.
[1:59:46] Well, that's all right. But that one
[1:59:49] act maybe in some jungle back there in
[1:59:53] South Africa or Tanzania, wherever it
[1:59:57] might be, Kenya would cause maybe
[2:00:02] thousands to fall on their face and give
[2:00:06] glory to God. And that's just one thing
[2:00:10] taking place.
[2:00:15] So you can see where the great
[2:00:20] power of the pull of the spirit
[2:00:25] is to go where the word is made
[2:00:30] manifest. Now, I want to hold that thing
[2:00:34] there for you cuz I I I want to to see
[2:00:39] what
[2:00:40] that he's saying to
[2:00:43] us. And and don't you believe that
[2:00:46] within this message, the world can
[2:00:50] listen to this message and hear one
[2:00:52] thing, but the bride can read uh there
[2:00:56] and hear what that he's saying to her.
[2:00:59] Now, look at what he's saying.
[2:01:02] He's talking about acts that happen in
[2:01:05] our midst all the time. In fact, we've
[2:01:09] got so
[2:01:10] hungry that we can't get enough.
[2:01:16] The more you eat, the more you want to
[2:01:18] eat.
[2:01:20] And we want to eat the supernatural. Eat
[2:01:22] the supernatural. We've got to bring the
[2:01:24] supernatural in the church. There's such
[2:01:26] a hunger for the supernatural that we
[2:01:28] start producing carnal
[2:01:33] impersonations. And maybe they're not
[2:01:35] even
[2:01:37] carnal. Maybe it is the the
[2:01:41] supernatural. But let me tell you
[2:01:43] something. If somebody stood up this
[2:01:46] morning and prophesied and gave a word
[2:01:48] of prophecy, we would walk all out of
[2:01:51] here saying, "Oh, that was all right.
[2:01:55] That was spirit. That was good. I like
[2:02:01] it. How much
[2:02:03] effect can we have on one
[2:02:06] another? Follow what he's saying
[2:02:13] here. But if that one act would have
[2:02:16] taken place someplace
[2:02:19] else in a different circumstance.
[2:02:24] Now we have sent missionaries into the
[2:02:26] foreign fields for
[2:02:27] years. I found the same thing when we
[2:02:31] come to South Africa where I
[2:02:33] missionaried here with our brother and
[2:02:38] we we did fine. Most was reading,
[2:02:42] writing and arithmetic. Now I have great
[2:02:44] respect for Africa and for my Africans
[2:02:49] also brethren but when it takes to make
[2:02:53] a man who don't even know which is the
[2:02:57] right hand the left hand and you go and
[2:03:01] tell him anything or lead him to Christ
[2:03:05] about a track that you might pass to him
[2:03:08] and he can't read see what he wants.
[2:03:13] He
[2:03:15] needs what he wants. He He reads of a
[2:03:19] god or he knows about another god, all
[2:03:23] kinds of gods, but he wants is something
[2:03:27] in action, something he can see.
[2:03:37] Now, I I just I I just couldn't believe
[2:03:40] what I was
[2:03:42] what I was
[2:03:44] hearing. We're
[2:03:48] overfed. I I didn't think we could ever
[2:03:50] get like
[2:03:51] that where we have so much
[2:03:56] supernatural, you know, that now you
[2:03:59] just keep whooping up bigger
[2:04:02] recipes. You know what I mean? It's not
[2:04:04] just potatoes anymore. It's potatoes
[2:04:09] with whole cream.
[2:04:12] and butter mixed in them. And if that
[2:04:15] ain't good enough, you add a little sour
[2:04:17] cream. Man, them things just getting
[2:04:20] richer and richer and getter and
[2:04:22] smither. You know what I mean? Because
[2:04:25] regular old mashed potatoes don't do.
[2:04:28] But if you're
[2:04:30] starved and you bring somebody mashed
[2:04:33] potatoes, they just s thankful.
[2:04:36] So it it it's not that the supernatural
[2:04:41] is under attack.
[2:04:44] It's just that the
[2:04:46] supernatural is misplaced.
[2:04:57] We all want the
[2:04:59] blessings, but we don't want to do the
[2:05:02] work.
[2:05:05] How do you
[2:05:07] get
[2:05:11] unlazy if you
[2:05:14] overeat? How do you
[2:05:16] handle being
[2:05:19] overfed? You do the
[2:05:21] work. You do the
[2:05:25] exercise. Now, the prophet gives an
[2:05:27] example talking to a church. We've seen
[2:05:30] so much
[2:05:32] supernatural. We've seen God do things.
[2:05:34] We've seen them give messages in tongues
[2:05:37] and prophecies. We've seen laying on of
[2:05:40] hands of the sick. We've seen miracle
[2:05:42] after miracle come across our our
[2:05:45] platform. And yet we're a
[2:05:50] drift. We're
[2:05:52] overfed. We've got so much
[2:05:57] supernatural that we become doy.
[2:06:01] But now he points out, if you would take
[2:06:04] that supernatural
[2:06:08] and you would take it out into the
[2:06:11] field,
[2:06:13] out where there's lost souls,
[2:06:16] off out where people are starving and
[2:06:19] hungry,
[2:06:20] and you would demonstrate to them the
[2:06:23] same God you testify in here, it would
[2:06:26] have effect
[2:06:34] But we've got it misplaced.
[2:06:40] We we we
[2:06:43] we've taken it and just brought it into
[2:06:47] our four walls and worked on it and got
[2:06:50] it turned it into a bigger bigger bigger
[2:06:53] meal. And that's not even the
[2:06:55] commission.
[2:07:00] The commission was to go into all the
[2:07:02] world and preach the gospel. Demonstrate
[2:07:07] to the world through your testimony and
[2:07:11] through the things in your life that
[2:07:12] your God is alive.
[2:07:18] That's where the supernatural should be.
[2:07:24] It just keeps throwing the church
[2:07:28] into greater division,
[2:07:31] into greater
[2:07:32] confusion, into document uh doctrine or
[2:07:38] arguments about gifts and operation of
[2:07:41] gifts and whether they're placed in the
[2:07:43] back room and whether they're done that
[2:07:45] and and that's not the point.
[2:07:53] It ain't an
[2:07:54] idea about coming up with a new recipe
[2:07:58] for us to get spiritually
[2:08:03] fat. It's
[2:08:05] about we
[2:08:09] believe. It's about taking it where it
[2:08:14] belongs.
[2:08:16] He said if this one
[2:08:18] act was done in
[2:08:21] Africa, thousands would come. And yet we
[2:08:24] sit back there and say it's okay because
[2:08:27] it's
[2:08:32] misplaced. We need to start bringing the
[2:08:34] supernatural testimony of our God into
[2:08:38] the lives and the people we come contact
[2:08:41] with. In closing, listen to what he
[2:08:43] says.
[2:08:48] He
[2:08:51] says that's the reason the apostles were
[2:08:56] endued with
[2:08:57] power because they were in a day of
[2:09:01] pagan
[2:09:03] and different gods was being worshiped
[2:09:07] and they wanted to see the manifestation
[2:09:10] of the true living God that could make
[2:09:13] himself known.
[2:09:16] That's why he endued them for power on
[2:09:19] high. Not to make us spiritually fat,
[2:09:23] but in the pagan world,
[2:09:28] we could go shout. Tell me this is the
[2:09:30] most pagan time, the most evil time, the
[2:09:35] most deceitful time ever. And God never
[2:09:38] gave you the spirit, never called you
[2:09:41] out, never called you to be elected so
[2:09:44] we could sit down and fill one another
[2:09:46] with the spirit
[2:09:50] until we have to create all kinds of
[2:09:53] movements.
[2:09:55] just to keep us happy.
[2:10:00] We got to run from camp to camp to camp
[2:10:06] or find some good preacher in. I'll tell
[2:10:10] you, you want to have the greatest
[2:10:12] experience in your life. You sit there
[2:10:15] and you tell some worldly person about
[2:10:17] the God that saved you, a God that
[2:10:20] healed you, the God that delivered you.
[2:10:22] You'll see more effect than you'll ever
[2:10:25] have in a church meeting.
[2:10:31] You'll see the real supernatural.
[2:10:35] It won't be, "Oh, that's just one more
[2:10:38] thing." Really, your God can heal.
[2:10:43] Would you come pray for my
[2:10:45] mother-in-law?
[2:10:49] see them sit there
[2:10:51] weeping, tears running down their
[2:10:56] face because you're talking to their
[2:10:58] heart and nobody's ever touched them on
[2:11:02] the
[2:11:03] inside. Nobody's ever found what their
[2:11:06] problem was or or where they've been.
[2:11:14] It's been freely
[2:11:17] given. Freely
[2:11:22] give. When do when when we're recalled
[2:11:25] just to get revelation upon revelation
[2:11:28] upon revelation until we're so full we
[2:11:32] don't even know what to do with
[2:11:35] it. Now we got to have whipped cream and
[2:11:37] cherries.
[2:11:42] The
[2:11:43] supernatural is not under
[2:11:45] attack. The problem is we've misplaced
[2:11:48] the
[2:11:52] supernatural. It wasn't given for us to
[2:11:55] continually have our faith built
[2:11:59] up. The disciples didn't go to that
[2:12:02] upper room to be endured with power on
[2:12:04] high so they would believe the message
[2:12:07] that Jesus sent.
[2:12:11] They were sent and got the power so they
[2:12:15] could go into all the world and preach
[2:12:18] the gospel so they could be convinced
[2:12:21] and
[2:12:24] concerned. You fight a
[2:12:27] devil. Maybe you fight lust. Maybe you
[2:12:29] fight anger. Maybe you fight
[2:12:31] discouragement. You know what? Just
[2:12:33] start testifying
[2:12:35] about the God you serve. Hallelujah.
[2:12:38] Start telling the world about a God that
[2:12:40] can deliver. Start telling your milkman.
[2:12:43] Start telling your neighbor. Start
[2:12:45] testifying to the glory of God. You know
[2:12:47] what you'll find? You'll find you're
[2:12:49] getting victory. You'll find that you're
[2:12:51] starting to overcome. You You're
[2:12:53] starting to find that you've got
[2:12:55] something to live for.
[2:12:58] But if you're going to keep sitting
[2:13:00] there
[2:13:02] hearing over and over and over again,
[2:13:05] you need more faith, you need more
[2:13:07] power, you need more this, you need more
[2:13:10] that, you're just going to become fat
[2:13:13] and doy. That's right. And I stand on
[2:13:16] the word because the prophet said so.
[2:13:24] Supernatural is not under attack.
[2:13:26] Unbelief don't stop God. We're just not
[2:13:29] doing the work.
[2:13:34] We're not an ice cube church. We're not
[2:13:37] a church that doesn't believe. Our
[2:13:39] problem is is we're not doing what we're
[2:13:43] called to do.
[2:13:48] We're not about the father's business.
[2:13:51] We're not carrying out the commission.
[2:13:55] We're not telling people about being
[2:13:58] baptized in Christian baptism. We're not
[2:14:01] telling people about the baptism of the
[2:14:03] Holy Spirit. I I don't need to tell you
[2:14:06] about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I
[2:14:08] don't need to tell you about being
[2:14:10] baptized in Jesus' name. I I I you guys
[2:14:13] know that.
[2:14:17] doing with it?
[2:14:23] Have we planted it and buried it because
[2:14:28] we know we have a wrathful God that
[2:14:30] takes
[2:14:39] judgment? This is what he he he says. He
[2:14:44] says, "That's
[2:14:46] why he filled
[2:14:48] them." And I thought, "Lord, what's our
[2:14:51] path
[2:14:53] forward? What is
[2:14:57] it that you would have us to do? We want
[2:15:01] to be
[2:15:03] spiritual. We want the spirit
[2:15:07] moving. We want the things of God."
[2:15:12] And some say, "Lo's here. Lo's there.
[2:15:16] Come over here. The spirit's moving
[2:15:18] here. Come over here. The spirit's
[2:15:20] moving. We've got God moving." You know,
[2:15:23] and you know what happens when you take
[2:15:27] misplaced
[2:15:29] spirituality, the world can walk right
[2:15:33] next to
[2:15:34] it. Pretty soon, you've got so much
[2:15:37] spirit, you can watch anything on TV.
[2:15:40] You've got so much spirit that you can
[2:15:42] go anywhere. You've got so much
[2:15:47] spirit because we're
[2:15:49] fat. And when I read the prophet of God
[2:15:53] saying we're
[2:15:57] overfed, I
[2:15:59] thought he didn't say
[2:16:04] that. We're always saying what? Eat
[2:16:07] more.
[2:16:09] Eat more
[2:16:10] revelation. Eat more tape. Eat more
[2:16:13] this. Eat more truth. Eat more spirit.
[2:16:18] Eat, eat, eat. And you know what? The
[2:16:20] word of God comes back and say
[2:16:26] work. Go into all the world. Do the
[2:16:29] work.
[2:16:32] Do the work. And now you'll have
[2:16:35] appetite.
[2:16:36] Do the work. Watch the supernatural
[2:16:39] where the supernatural is having effect.
[2:16:42] We see supernatural here. That was
[2:16:45] great. Great
[2:16:47] meeting. You tell some
[2:16:50] sinner that's at their wits end and
[2:16:53] their roads end about a God that can
[2:16:57] change their life. You watch how you
[2:17:00] feel and you watch how they feel. And if
[2:17:03] you've got faith, you'll see it through
[2:17:06] until it brings fruit.
[2:17:12] I think we're spiritually
[2:17:15] fine. I just think we need to get
[2:17:18] back to what the church was called to
[2:17:20] do.
[2:17:25] I've been honest with
[2:17:26] you. I've been straightforward with you.
[2:17:33] The spirit of God was not designed to be
[2:17:36] kept in these four
[2:17:39] walls. It was designed to reign in your
[2:17:43] heart as an
[2:17:46] individual and for you to
[2:17:50] share what God has done for you. If he
[2:17:54] hasn't done anything for you, then ask
[2:17:57] him
[2:17:58] to. and he will not turn you away. Amen.
[2:18:05] It's
[2:18:07] 12:15 and I know it's a little late, but
[2:18:11] I hope that you can
[2:18:13] understand what I'm
[2:18:18] saying. Let's be lean, rugged Christians
[2:18:24] because we're doing the work of
[2:18:27] Christianity.
[2:18:29] And I believe that God will bless it.
[2:18:32] Tell somebody about the baptism of the
[2:18:34] Holy
[2:18:35] Spirit. Kneel down with them. You don't
[2:18:40] have to bring them to church to have the
[2:18:43] ministry do the work. You do the work.
[2:18:47] You don't be ashamed of the gospel.
[2:18:52] You tell how your candle got lit and
[2:18:56] keep that spirit alive in your life. And
[2:19:02] then if you see God do something here in
[2:19:05] this framework of this
[2:19:07] building, you're you're not going to sit
[2:19:09] here and say, "Oh, that's nice." You're
[2:19:11] going to say, "I'm going to go tell such
[2:19:13] and such what I seen God done."
[2:19:17] and you'll be
[2:19:19] servants of the most high God. You'll be
[2:19:22] carrying out the commission that God
[2:19:25] told you to carry out. You'll be walking
[2:19:29] the path that he's chosen us to walk.
[2:19:32] Our way forward as a body of believers
[2:19:36] is to witness this message to this lost
[2:19:41] and dying generation.
[2:19:44] It's not for me to continually teach you
[2:19:48] in the doctrines and the revelations of
[2:19:51] William Brandham, which you have access
[2:19:54] to.
[2:19:55] But I hope you still love me.
[2:19:58] I hope you trust me and I hope you can
[2:20:01] understand what the prophet of God was
[2:20:03] saying when he said, "We need to be
[2:20:06] convinced and we need to be concerned
[2:20:10] because that's the path forward for the
[2:20:12] church." God bless you, brother Bill.
[2:20:15] [Applause]
[2:20:41] Man, is that your heart desired this
[2:20:42] morning? Lord, me Lord, I want to be
[2:20:45] about your work. You know, you can't
[2:20:48] eating without exercising is no good. It
[2:20:52] gets you fat. When you eat, you need to
[2:20:54] exercise. You need We eat for the
[2:20:56] purpose of gaining strength for the
[2:20:58] exercise.
[2:21:03] Amen. You hold my
[2:21:07] aing
[2:21:10] moment. You call my
[2:21:13] raing sea.
[2:21:18] You walk with me through

[2:21:27] mighty
[2:21:30] things. Oh, and I

[2:22:21] I have for
[2:22:27] me. Jesus, you're all I
[2:22:32] [Music]
[2:22:33] need. Lord, you hold my hand. Every
[2:22:42] morning you
[2:22:45] come to
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:49] see you walk with
[2:22:52] me through
[2:22:55] [Music]

[2:23:08] see you.
[2:23:12] Oh,
[2:23:20] that's heat.

[2:23:55] I for
[2:24:01] Jesus, you're all I
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:08] need. Father of
[2:24:11] life, sitting on the throne of
[2:24:15] grace. It's only by your mercy we are
[2:24:20] saved.
[2:24:23] Oh Lord, you
[2:24:26] said if we call upon your name, oh
[2:24:34] we
[2:24:36] [Laughter]
[2:24:38] feel Heat.
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:48] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:25:03] Jesus Christ.
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:33] Happy Jesus Christ.
[2:25:36] [Music]

[2:26:40] [Music]
[2:26:54] I

[2:27:13] Oh my

[2:27:53] Heat.
[2:27:55] Heat.

[2:28:08] Jesus Christ.
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:27] How we
[2:28:33] pray
[2:28:37] most Jesus Christ.
[2:28:41] [Music]
[2:28:43] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I trust we can
[2:28:48] to be about our father's business.
[2:28:51] That's our heart's desire. Whatever he
[2:28:54] wants us to do, that's what we want to
[2:28:55] be about. Amen. He said this works,
[2:28:59] these signs shall follow them that
[2:29:01] believe. That when we cast out devils,
[2:29:04] we do all of that. Those are part of the
[2:29:06] signs that follow the believers. And we
[2:29:09] believe that when we go about the work,
[2:29:11] he will bring the signs to come to pass.
[2:29:14] Amen. But if you could just come and
[2:29:16] dismiss us this morning.
[2:29:26] [Music]
[2:29:32] Let's pray. Do not repent. God our
[2:29:35] father.
[2:29:40] Yeah. We are approaching once again your
[2:29:42] throne as your
[2:29:45] children. those that you have redeemed
[2:29:47] with the
[2:29:49] price. The blood is flown that
[2:29:53] day. The blood of animals could do
[2:29:57] nothing. So it took you the God himself,
[2:30:00] the prophet to give your son to come die
[2:30:04] at the
[2:30:05] cross so we can have life.
[2:30:09] In the day of Pentecost, you said to
[2:30:11] your
[2:30:11] people, "Go into go into the upper room
[2:30:16] and I will come."
[2:30:18] You came down
[2:30:19] certainly. You spoke to
[2:30:22] them. Holy Spirit came upon
[2:30:26] them, not only so that the spirit is
[2:30:30] that they may go out and bring out the
[2:30:33] word. The same commission you given us
[2:30:36] today. That's why we pray Lord that you
[2:30:40] help
[2:30:41] us everywhere we are that we may be in
[2:30:44] the
[2:30:45] commission that we may testify of
[2:30:53] you. He took them talking about you.
[2:30:56] That's how you came to them on the way
[2:30:58] to
[2:31:00] Emmas and also we want to talk about
[2:31:05] you every moment.
[2:31:09] When we are gathered with
[2:31:10] people, speak about him and know that
[2:31:14] you will come.
[2:31:16] Thank you for your servant that you
[2:31:18] utilize this morning. Strengthen him and
[2:31:22] bless
[2:31:24] him. Bless us as we go
[2:31:27] home. Let us talk to about you
[2:31:31] everyone. talk about all your
[2:31:34] goodness, everything that you have done
[2:31:36] and what you promise you're going to
[2:31:39] do and will come in our midst and and
[2:31:42] come and do.
[2:31:45] Thank you for
[2:31:46] everything in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:31:48] we pray.
[2:31:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you at this
[2:31:54] mist. We bow our
[2:31:59] hearts. We bend our
[2:32:01] [Music]
[2:32:03] knees. Oh spirit, come make us
[2:32:11] humble. We turn our
[2:32:15] eyes from evil
[2:32:19] things. Oh Lord, we cast out our idols.
[2:32:25] Oh, give us clean
[2:32:28] hand. For give us your
[2:32:33] heart. Let us not lift our souls to
[2:32:39] another. Oh, give us
[2:32:44] sweet. Give us your heart.
[2:32:49] Let us not take our souls to
[2:32:55] another. Oh God, let us be a
[2:33:00] generation that
[2:33:02] [Music]
[2:33:03] seeks your
[2:33:06] face. Oh God of J.
[2:33:11] Oh God, let us be a
[2:33:16] generation that
[2:33:18] sees. Oh, see your face.
[2:33:23] Oh God of
[2:33:28] Jacob, oh
[2:33:32] God,
[2:33:34] who
[2:33:37] I

[2:33:44] sp we turn
[2:33:48] around from evil
[2:33:53] Oh Lord, we

[2:34:01] us give us your
[2:34:06] heart. Let

[2:34:17] praise. Give us pure
[2:34:21] heart. Let us not lift our souls to
[2:34:28] another. Oh God, let us be a
[2:34:33] generation. I

[2:34:40] Oh God of
[2:34:44] Jacob, God let us be a
[2:34:49] generation that
