[38:52] lord jesus i believe that every son and
[38:55] daughter
[38:56] would agree that they want you to have
[38:59] your perfect will and way in their life
[39:01] lord truly lord as we
[39:05] live here on this earth and we are in
[39:08] these
[39:09] tabernacles of clay we have desires and
[39:12] wants
[39:13] and certainly see the natural needs of
[39:17] a home and shelter and cars and vehicles
[39:20] and careers and jobs and
[39:22] providing for our families and lord many
[39:26] times
[39:26] we form plans and
[39:30] ideas and look to the ways that we would
[39:34] accomplish those things but lord we know
[39:38] that
[39:38] it's not in ourselves to provide those
[39:40] things but it's in you
[39:43] lord you said seek ye first the kingdom
[39:45] of god and his righteousness and all
[39:47] these things
[39:47] shall be added unto you and lord however
[39:51] you would see fit to provide for us lord
[39:54] we want what you want lord many times
[39:57] it's hard to die out to our ideas it's
[39:59] hard to die
[40:00] out to our wants our dreams our goals
[40:03] our ambitions lord but you know what's
[40:05] best for us
[40:06] lord we've come to the house of god that
[40:08] we could just surrender to your
[40:10] will lord we've
[40:13] sung the songs of zion we've
[40:16] lifted up your name and we thank you for
[40:19] your presence by divine promise that is
[40:21] here
[40:23] and now lord we look that you would come
[40:25] and you'd break the bread of life as
[40:26] only you can
[40:28] lord i am needy of you to come by
[40:32] and just use the vessel lord and
[40:35] ourselves we don't have anything to give
[40:38] but lord if by your holy spirit you
[40:40] could come and just speak
[40:43] lord that the hungry hearts that have
[40:45] gathered can hear from you
[40:47] not hearing from a man but here from
[40:49] your throne tonight we pray we love you
[40:51] lord
[40:52] we commit the service we surrender
[40:54] ourselves to you now in jesus christ's
[40:56] name we pray
[40:57] amen praise the lord it's good to be
[41:01] in the presence of god i mean if you
[41:03] have your bibles we'll
[41:04] just read a couple scriptures
[41:08] we'll read revelations chapter one
[41:14] now we just want to remember our pastor
[41:15] and prayers he's not feeling well
[41:18] i he he wanted to be in the house of god
[41:21] so
[41:22] he is here in the back but he's just
[41:24] battling some pain and some
[41:27] some affliction in the flesh so just
[41:28] remember him
[41:30] tonight reading revelations chapter 1
[41:34] verse 17 and 18
[41:38] says and when i saw him i fell at his
[41:41] feet as dead
[41:43] and he laid his right hand upon me
[41:45] saying unto me fear not
[41:47] i am the first and the last i am he that
[41:50] liveth
[41:51] and was dead and behold i am alive
[41:55] forevermore amen and have the keys
[41:59] of hell and of death amen you may be
[42:03] seated
[42:05] this has a blessing on the reading of
[42:07] the word as you turn also to romans
[42:09] chapter 8.
[42:21] just read from
[42:24] by this it's so wonderful here we'll
[42:27] just start with verse one
[42:29] and work to verse 11. it says there is
[42:31] therefore now no condemnation to them
[42:35] which are in christ jesus who walk
[42:38] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[42:42] i love that has anybody ever battled
[42:46] condemnation
[42:48] i don't know about you but condemnation
[42:51] is a very serious tactic of the enemy
[42:54] and when he starts heaping on the
[42:56] condemnation and starts pointing
[42:58] to your past or to your mistakes or to
[43:00] your failures and
[43:02] he he gets you to start looking at how
[43:04] things could have been or should have
[43:06] been and
[43:07] how maybe you should have handled
[43:08] something starts making you kind of feel
[43:10] a little down kind of makes you start
[43:12] feeling a little out and then
[43:14] when we start looking into the word and
[43:16] my how we
[43:17] how we love to feed on the word and we
[43:19] we see the examples that god's put
[43:21] before us and
[43:22] and why we're feeding on the word and
[43:23] then also it just seems like you can be
[43:25] rejoicing and looking at these great
[43:27] promises and then something kind of just
[43:29] slip in and say
[43:30] yeah but you ain't anywhere near there
[43:33] you know and yeah you just don't add up
[43:35] and all of a sudden condemnation
[43:37] can come in and and really start to have
[43:39] an effect on you where you
[43:41] you don't want to make that phone call
[43:42] or you don't want to go to the house of
[43:44] god or you just might not testify and
[43:46] you want to pray and and all of a sudden
[43:49] you can find yourself
[43:50] just really fighting a battle out of
[43:52] nowhere but i love the scripture right
[43:54] here jesus said there's no condemnation
[43:58] to them that are in christ jesus and
[44:00] even when your heart condemns you
[44:02] god's greater than your heart oh i love
[44:05] the word it just knows how to wash you
[44:07] don't it
[44:08] just knows how to take you when you're
[44:10] feeling all down and you're feeling all
[44:11] blue and you don't know what to do
[44:13] you can just look into the mirror of
[44:15] god's word you can look into his
[44:16] promises
[44:17] and he'll just take you and wrap his
[44:19] arms around you and tell you
[44:20] everything's gonna be okay amen
[44:23] there is therefore now no condemnation
[44:25] to them which on christ jesus who walk
[44:27] not after the flesh
[44:29] but after the spirit for the law of the
[44:31] spirit of the life in christ jesus hath
[44:33] made us free
[44:35] from the law of sin and death for what
[44:38] the law could not do
[44:39] and that it was weak through the flesh
[44:41] god sending his own son in the likeness
[44:43] of sinful flesh
[44:45] and for our sin condemned sin in the
[44:47] flesh
[44:48] that the righteousness of the law might
[44:50] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[44:52] the flesh but after the spirit
[44:55] for they that are after the flesh do
[44:56] mind the things of the flesh
[44:58] but they that are after the spirit the
[45:01] things
[45:02] of the spirit that's a good scripture to
[45:04] do a checkup on your life
[45:06] for they that are after the flesh do
[45:09] mind the things of the flesh
[45:11] once again if if you have a heart to
[45:13] serve god
[45:15] and you're wanting to serve god but you
[45:16] find that you're minding the things of
[45:18] the flesh and you haven't overcome
[45:19] certain things you know you should have
[45:22] well don't don't be condemned in such a
[45:24] way that you shrink
[45:25] back but know that god has shown you
[45:27] that there's more for you
[45:29] you know that should be uh something to
[45:32] encourage the believer
[45:34] is when you look into god's word and you
[45:35] see it calls for something
[45:37] and you see that you're falling short
[45:39] don't don't be discouraged and give up
[45:42] be encouraged to know that god has more
[45:44] for you i mean so many times the enemy
[45:46] wants to just turn it around on you
[45:49] in such a way where where it causes you
[45:51] to shrink back but know what god is
[45:53] wanting you to see is yes that's okay my
[45:55] son
[45:56] this is where you're at and you're still
[45:58] battling certain things in the flesh
[46:00] but i'm wanting you to know there's
[46:02] higher heights and deeper depths there's
[46:03] a place of deliverance
[46:05] there's a place of refuge that you can
[46:07] enter into where you're not minded the
[46:09] things of the flesh anymore
[46:11] but you've moved into a place where you
[46:14] find yourself not minding the things of
[46:15] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[46:18] the things of the spirit as you start to
[46:20] surrender your life and you come to that
[46:22] place of
[46:23] justification and sanctification and now
[46:25] the holy spirit is
[46:26] is moving in your life you find yourself
[46:29] to be about the father's business
[46:31] and even for those that have received
[46:33] the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:35] we have to remain vigilant and to bring
[46:37] this flesh into subjection because it's
[46:39] so
[46:40] easy to fall back or it's so easy to
[46:42] give in
[46:43] if you're not careful oh yes there was a
[46:45] question asked could somebody
[46:47] with the holy ghost you know do bad
[46:50] things or do very bad things look
[46:52] you're in a tabernacle that's
[46:54] unconverted
[46:55] this flesh if you will this flesh man
[47:00] oh it's it's not going to be converted
[47:02] uh
[47:03] uh you're going to leave that here we're
[47:05] going to shed this thing there's another
[47:07] tabernacle
[47:08] that god has prepared for us that when
[47:10] this earthly tabernacle dissolved
[47:12] all we're going to be changed in a
[47:13] moment in a twinkling of eye and we're
[47:15] going to be caught out of here but
[47:16] but we got to realize there's a white
[47:18] dog and a black dog
[47:20] and whenever that black dog if you if
[47:22] you if you're not bring it under
[47:23] subjection and you allow it to start
[47:25] having its own way and feeding on things
[47:27] you you better watch out
[47:29] that's where all something in our heart
[47:31] is born again believers filled with the
[47:32] holy spirit we got to bring it into
[47:34] subjection
[47:35] for to be carnally minded as death but
[47:37] to be spiritually minded is life
[47:39] and peace because the carnal mind is
[47:42] enmity against god
[47:44] for it is not subject to the law of god
[47:45] neither indeed can be
[47:47] so then they that are in the flesh
[47:50] cannot please god
[47:52] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[47:54] spirit if so be that the spirit of god
[47:56] dwell in you
[47:57] now if any man have not the spirit of
[47:59] christ he is none of his
[48:02] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[48:04] because of sin
[48:05] but the spirit is life because of
[48:07] righteousness
[48:09] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[48:12] jesus christ from the dead dwell in you
[48:15] he that raised up christ from the dead
[48:17] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[48:20] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[48:24] amen and just really appreciate the word
[48:26] of our pastor and brother billy on
[48:28] sunday
[48:30] we just hopefully maybe can say
[48:32] something just to maybe support that or
[48:34] fall in line
[48:35] but we're just thankful for the holy
[48:36] ghost
[48:38] we're thankful that there's there's
[48:39] something in the believer
[48:41] uh that cries out for more of god and
[48:44] cries out for that manifestation
[48:46] and as our pastor was speaking on
[48:47] stepping away out of the theology
[48:50] you know that's truly something that all
[48:53] of us should really take
[48:55] very seriously and and consider because
[48:57] it's easy for us
[48:59] uh to get into our routines it's easy
[49:01] for us to check all the boxes
[49:03] it's easy for us to maybe study the word
[49:05] and listen to the message
[49:07] and then we find out if we're not
[49:09] careful we've maybe entered into more of
[49:11] a
[49:11] a religion or a routine and maybe more
[49:13] into a theology
[49:15] and not really allowing the life of that
[49:17] word to be what's jurisdicting our
[49:19] actions which jurisdicting our day
[49:20] that's
[49:21] that's leading and guiding us on a daily
[49:23] basis and we find ourselves maybe
[49:26] uh in a rut or in a routine and
[49:29] just want to read this quote out of it
[49:30] is the rising of the sun it says
[49:33] now you who were once walked along with
[49:36] a great big cigar in your mouth and
[49:37] everything
[49:38] or a bunch of cigarettes and you women
[49:41] once had short hair and painted and
[49:43] carried on and
[49:44] wore shorts and things like that all at
[49:47] once
[49:47] something screamed and you looked down
[49:50] here and it was the word
[49:52] see it quickened you said no more shorts
[49:55] for me
[49:55] no more liquor for me no more lying no
[49:58] more stealing
[49:59] no more this or that i i like when the
[50:02] prophet says no more this or that
[50:04] because it just
[50:05] that gets it all you know you might have
[50:08] you might have grown up in a message
[50:09] home where where
[50:10] you know where the token has been
[50:12] applied or or had good parents that have
[50:15] have raised you really well and there
[50:16] hasn't been the nonsense in the home and
[50:19] and you might feel like uh well you know
[50:21] what there's
[50:22] i didn't have to battle all those things
[50:24] i've never come to a place
[50:26] to where i had to say no to the
[50:28] influence of the world but i want you to
[50:30] know being born in sin
[50:32] and shaped in iniquity there has to come
[50:35] a place
[50:36] where there that seed receives from the
[50:39] word and that cry in there is crying out
[50:41] to god
[50:42] there's a deep calling to a deep and
[50:44] something responds
[50:45] and you actually know that there's been
[50:47] a change take place
[50:49] you you can say oh i've been in the
[50:51] church pew and i i've been going through
[50:53] all of the motions
[50:54] but there comes a time where something
[50:57] becomes more real to you than it's ever
[50:59] been
[51:01] and we thank god for his keeping power
[51:04] and i believe it's an
[51:04] inheritance unto the believers of this
[51:06] day that we can raise our
[51:08] children in in the ammunition of the
[51:11] lord and
[51:11] and apply the token to our household and
[51:14] have them in a church where the
[51:15] the word is faithfully taught and at
[51:17] young ages they can come to know the
[51:19] lord and have an
[51:20] experience but i want to encourage each
[51:22] and every one of you
[51:23] to come to that place where you know
[51:26] that you know that you know
[51:28] that you come to the place where you can
[51:30] say no more stealing and no more this or
[51:32] that
[51:33] no more doubting no more second-guessing
[51:35] no more wondering what's out there in
[51:37] the world
[51:38] no more worrying about uh what what
[51:40] other religions or whatever
[51:42] doctrines or whatever things are out
[51:44] there because you've come to a place
[51:45] where you met the author of the word
[51:47] you've come to a place where you've met
[51:49] jesus christ and he meets every single
[51:51] deed that you've ever had
[51:52] and it's you and him alone and nothing
[51:54] else matters and you can come to that
[51:56] place no more this or that
[51:58] it's you and you alone lord
[52:01] see that's the spirit that raised him
[52:03] from the dead
[52:05] dwelling in you will also bring your
[52:08] mortal bodies the dust of the earth into
[52:10] subjection
[52:12] you see what is it subjection to what
[52:15] christ who is christ the word
[52:18] not the theology but the word
[52:23] not a conforming not a struggle
[52:27] but by the power of the holy ghost
[52:31] you're changed you're you're receiving a
[52:34] nature
[52:37] you know you can you've heard the the
[52:40] the the story go like this you can take
[52:43] a pig and you can clean them all up
[52:46] what is he going to do he's going to go
[52:47] right back and start walling around in
[52:49] the mud again
[52:51] and look if if if you're in a in a place
[52:54] in your life
[52:55] where you find out you're struggling
[52:57] with something
[52:58] and look you can you can have a mental
[53:02] will or you can have a focus and there's
[53:03] people out in the world that they've
[53:05] they they give up alcohol they give up
[53:07] cigarettes and they come to a place of a
[53:09] resolve and a decision
[53:11] and they make good choices and then
[53:12] embedded their lives and they commit to
[53:14] fitness programs
[53:15] and they do a lot of things through
[53:17] through through being able to make a
[53:19] mental decision
[53:20] and and staying true to it and and so i
[53:22] say it behooves you if you find out
[53:24] that that you find yourself coming back
[53:27] around to something
[53:29] and something keeps peaking its head
[53:31] back up in your life
[53:32] you can come to a place of total
[53:34] deliverance
[53:36] and look that's god god allows these
[53:38] tests and he allows these trials to come
[53:41] into our lives
[53:42] so that you can come to that place of
[53:43] deliverance
[53:46] that's just the way it is and praise god
[53:49] he does it that way
[53:51] because it's always to show you that
[53:53] there's more in store for you
[53:56] you don't have to live that way anymore
[53:58] look if you're trying to conform to a
[54:00] set of rules and regulations and conform
[54:02] to to maybe what up what from that
[54:06] vantage point you think the message is
[54:09] because the message is not a religion
[54:11] the message is not a denomination
[54:14] the message isn't a group of people that
[54:16] have identified a set of moral codes
[54:19] and identified a set of teachings and
[54:22] they all got together and they said you
[54:24] know what
[54:25] we all agree together and this is going
[54:27] to be what we believe and this is our
[54:28] religion
[54:29] and this is what we're going to push and
[54:31] this is what we're going to set forth
[54:32] and we're all just trying to conform and
[54:34] hold some type of standard
[54:36] no sir the message is jesus christ and
[54:39] when you've met
[54:40] jesus christ and you've been changed you
[54:43] received the nature of the word
[54:45] and that's what this message is doing
[54:47] it's bringing you into the nature
[54:49] of jesus christ where his thoughts are
[54:52] your thoughts and your actions are his
[54:53] actions it's
[54:54] he and you and i and you it's it the
[54:56] whole thing is him
[54:59] and until you get to that place i
[55:02] invite you to come to that place oh to
[55:05] where you're transformed and you're
[55:07] changed and then those things that
[55:08] you've been struggling with
[55:10] and those things that you've been
[55:11] battling and those things that you have
[55:13] been worrying about
[55:14] when they all start to dissolve because
[55:16] you start beholding the word
[55:18] and you look into the word and the word
[55:20] speaks back and something in you says
[55:21] amen
[55:22] and it starts to transform and starts to
[55:24] quicken you
[55:25] it starts to quicken your mortal body
[55:29] oh you're no longer dead but you're made
[55:31] alive in jesus christ
[55:33] now you're living but if you're
[55:36] conforming
[55:38] if that struggle is still there now once
[55:41] again
[55:42] it's okay if you're struggling it's okay
[55:46] if you've been
[55:46] trying to conform if you've been making
[55:49] an effort that's okay if you've been
[55:51] making an effort to wear your clothes in
[55:54] a different way and wear your hair in a
[55:55] different way and brothers
[55:57] to dress not like the world and wear all
[55:59] the trendy things of the worlds and the
[56:01] pants and the shirts
[56:02] and the hairstyles and you're making
[56:03] ever but you find yourself battling oh
[56:05] just know that you can come to a place
[56:07] of total surrender to where his life
[56:10] comes into you and those things don't
[56:11] have a pull on you anymore
[56:27] but oh if we're not staying in the
[56:28] channel
[56:31] we're not staying feeding on the word if
[56:33] we're not staying
[56:35] in in the spirit and reading and praying
[56:40] then bringing this this old bag of bones
[56:43] into subjection becomes a little tougher
[56:46] and you find yourself not praying as
[56:48] much not reading as much and you find
[56:50] yourself out
[56:51] doing things and looking around on
[56:52] things that you shouldn't do and
[56:54] wasting your time and and the longer you
[56:57] do it isn't amazing how the harder it
[56:58] gets
[57:00] the longer you go without praying the
[57:02] harder it is to pray has anybody ever
[57:03] experienced that
[57:07] you know the longer you go without
[57:08] reading your bible the longer you go
[57:10] without getting in the presence of god
[57:12] well i thank god we had we had a
[57:14] wonderful prayer service last night
[57:15] really felt his presence and
[57:17] and uh sister julia brother cosmic labor
[57:20] on the piano just helped create a
[57:22] a wonderful atmosphere and i it was just
[57:24] refreshing to be in the presence of god
[57:26] and
[57:27] to hear the prayers of the saints going
[57:29] up and coming to his presence
[57:30] oh it's sometimes we we need we need
[57:33] those things to help break us through
[57:34] and
[57:34] enter in and you know you come home and
[57:40] it's just easier to enter in
[57:43] you you come to the church service or
[57:45] something like that and there's a
[57:46] refreshing of the spirit
[57:47] it's easy to enter in it's easier to get
[57:49] into the spirit
[57:50] it's easy to pick up your bible and
[57:52] start to read and you just feel like man
[57:54] it's speaking back to you
[57:55] but oh when we allow the cares of the
[57:57] world just to continue on and continue
[58:00] on
[58:00] and then we want to let off the pressure
[58:02] with the current events and news and
[58:04] certain things like that and we're not
[58:05] feeding our soul
[58:07] oh we find ourselves uh where that where
[58:09] where we
[58:10] we start to find it harder to do the
[58:12] things that we know to do
[58:14] and john 5 24 says verily verily i say
[58:17] unto you he that heareth my word
[58:20] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[58:23] everlasting life
[58:24] and shall not come into condemnation but
[58:27] is passed
[58:27] from death and to life
[58:33] just in this message rising to the son
[58:35] brother branham and referring to that
[58:36] text
[58:38] he says he that heareth he says really
[58:40] in the greek it's he that understandeth
[58:42] my word
[58:43] he says you know not necessarily hear
[58:46] that heareth and he says
[58:47] to to show you this is the truth and
[58:51] he says now you could have maybe a drunk
[58:54] and walk down the road and he he's all
[58:56] has his arm around a woman he's not
[58:57] married to and he's cursing and all
[58:59] these things and say hey drunk
[59:01] did you hear what the preacher said he
[59:03] said yeah i heard it
[59:06] but see it didn't have any effect and
[59:08] he's showing that it's not
[59:09] it's not in just a hearing of the word
[59:11] naturally but there has to come an
[59:13] understanding
[59:14] there you have to come to a place to
[59:17] where now the word it's not just a
[59:19] hearing of the word only but it's a doer
[59:22] the life of the word
[59:23] is coming and making its abode it's
[59:25] making its resident in you
[59:27] and now that word that you heard is now
[59:29] living out through you
[59:32] he that understandeth my word and just
[59:35] in that
[59:36] thinking upon uh just the theology or
[59:39] religion and things
[59:41] you know it's not an understanding or a
[59:43] comparison or a research or committee
[59:46] or facts or works or something that we
[59:49] come to know the word of god
[59:54] it's not by your mind it's not by facts
[59:55] it's not by research
[1:00:00] you can hear it all your life you can
[1:00:01] hear it preached all your life you can
[1:00:03] read all the message you want to read
[1:00:04] but
[1:00:05] but if it's just up here you've never
[1:00:08] really come to a knowledge and
[1:00:10] understanding
[1:00:11] of the word because you have to have the
[1:00:14] life of the word
[1:00:16] it's like i was i was thinking you know
[1:00:18] one time i remember trying to tell my
[1:00:20] daughter
[1:00:21] look don't touch that it'll burn you
[1:00:23] well you can just try to describe to
[1:00:25] somebody all you want what it means to
[1:00:26] be burnt
[1:00:27] well it's like a really you know it like
[1:00:29] it hurts really bad and it's like
[1:00:31] it's like a sharp not like a sharp pain
[1:00:33] but it's a burning it's a burning
[1:00:34] well you you can try to explain it all
[1:00:37] you want
[1:00:38] but every once in a while somebody
[1:00:39] catches the revelation
[1:00:42] you tell him not to touch the hot stove
[1:00:44] you tell him not to touch the hot iron
[1:00:46] you tell him not to stick things in the
[1:00:47] in the wall socket or you'll get
[1:00:49] electrocuted well you can study
[1:00:51] electricity all you want you can study
[1:00:53] what it means to be burned but when
[1:00:54] there comes a day
[1:00:55] where all of a sudden you stick your
[1:00:56] hand in that electric socket and you get
[1:00:58] shocked
[1:01:00] i know what it means to get shocked oh
[1:01:03] glory hallelujah it's that same way
[1:01:05] when you come in contact with the
[1:01:07] resurrected lord jesus christ
[1:01:09] when it gets all the ego i've been
[1:01:11] changed i know what it means i know what
[1:01:13] it's like
[1:01:14] oh it's not up here anymore but i got a
[1:01:16] revelation
[1:01:18] and then you can go tell somebody else
[1:01:20] look don't do that
[1:01:22] you'll get shocked you get electrocuted
[1:01:24] what does that mean i said tell you and
[1:01:25] then you can start witnessing the people
[1:01:28] you say oh you don't want to live that
[1:01:29] way i used to live that way before but
[1:01:32] there's a better way you can repent
[1:01:34] you can be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:01:35] christ you can receive salvation
[1:01:38] and the gift of the holy ghost and you
[1:01:39] can receive a comforter that'll comfort
[1:01:41] you no matter what you're going through
[1:01:43] and you can speak from experience have
[1:01:46] you ever had somebody try to sell you
[1:01:48] something they haven't experienced
[1:01:50] or tell you about something they haven't
[1:01:51] experienced you go to a restaurant you
[1:01:54] try to order a meal
[1:01:55] well this is really good yeah have you
[1:01:58] had it before
[1:01:58] no i've heard it's really good it's one
[1:02:02] of our most popular things
[1:02:05] but when somebody's experienced it oh
[1:02:07] that's my favorite thing i eat in about
[1:02:09] three or four i take what you have
[1:02:10] they'll give that to me
[1:02:13] because they know what they're talking
[1:02:15] about oh hallelujah may we be a people
[1:02:17] that know what we're talking about i
[1:02:19] don't care if we come in contact
[1:02:20] with people that have their church
[1:02:22] services out there and they're running
[1:02:24] and screaming and shouting and speaking
[1:02:26] in tongues
[1:02:26] and they got all the works and they got
[1:02:28] signs and they got wonders and
[1:02:29] everything following them
[1:02:30] praise god that's what my god does i
[1:02:32] like to know when my
[1:02:34] god is blessing other people i haven't
[1:02:35] even come to the knowledge of the full
[1:02:37] truth
[1:02:37] that means it puts me in a position to
[1:02:39] say hey do you know there's something
[1:02:40] more
[1:02:42] i don't shy from it i don't back down
[1:02:44] from it i embrace it because i know the
[1:02:46] author
[1:02:48] say that's my god he's a god who heals
[1:02:51] he's a god that delivers he's a god that
[1:02:53] said i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:02:54] flesh
[1:02:55] oh you'll dream dreams you'll prophesy

[1:03:00] that's my god he doesn't limit his
[1:03:03] his blessings to one house

[1:03:08] compassion

[1:03:11] come to experience it for yourself
[1:03:13] praise god then you know what you're
[1:03:15] talking about
[1:03:17] it's not a conforming it's not a
[1:03:18] religion
[1:03:21] it's not in your head
[1:03:25] but it's a reality
[1:03:31] because i tell you what
[1:03:34] your mind you can have stuff up here
[1:03:38] your mind will fail you
[1:03:41] and you can plug this scripture in that
[1:03:44] quote and you can listen to this message
[1:03:46] and you can hear the prophet and you get
[1:03:48] a pretty good handle of something
[1:03:50] and you have it ironed out pretty good
[1:03:54] and then you hear it this way and you
[1:03:55] hear a minister say it that way and then
[1:03:56] you realize you ain't got nothing ironed
[1:03:58] out any good
[1:04:00] you say i thought i had it down i
[1:04:01] thought i knew what the godhead was i
[1:04:03] i thought i knew what the seventh seal
[1:04:05] was i i thought i knew what the son of
[1:04:07] man was i thought the son of man said
[1:04:09] i thought i knew when the coming of the
[1:04:10] lord was i thought it was health you
[1:04:12] know what
[1:04:13] that's all you don't get caught up in
[1:04:14] theology
[1:04:16] but if you're walking with him oh like
[1:04:19] those disciples on the road to emmaus
[1:04:21] oh they were so downtrodden here they
[1:04:23] were walking along
[1:04:25] and what did jesus oh he came along he
[1:04:27] said oh fools and slow of heart
[1:04:29] to believe everything that the prophets
[1:04:31] had ever said oh
[1:04:32] they were walking with him oh they were
[1:04:35] walking with the most blessed
[1:04:37] uh experience they could ever have
[1:04:39] they're walking with a resurrected lord
[1:04:41] jesus christ and didn't even know it
[1:04:45] oh but praise god he he continued on
[1:04:48] with him
[1:04:50] he didn't leave him in that condition
[1:04:53] and all their hearts started to burn
[1:04:55] within him and i say
[1:04:56] when you read these things in the
[1:04:58] scripture the coming of the son of man
[1:05:00] and the seventh hill
[1:05:01] and all of these things and and you hear
[1:05:04] the testimonies
[1:05:05] oh something in your heart just burns
[1:05:07] you hear the discerning of the thoughts
[1:05:09] and intense light
[1:05:10] and something in your heart burns with
[1:05:11] it i say oh don't leave it there
[1:05:14] constrain him to stay say lord my
[1:05:17] heart's burning within me
[1:05:19] don't leave me lord come reveal yourself
[1:05:21] to me
[1:05:22] i want to know more of your person
[1:05:25] break the bread of life lord i need
[1:05:27] revelation
[1:05:30] oh and then when your eyes come open i'm
[1:05:33] sorry about it but when you see
[1:05:34] something you can't unsee it
[1:05:37] i'm sorry bring
[1:05:40] bring bring all the nonsense you want to
[1:05:43] bring
[1:05:44] and try to tell me this message ain't
[1:05:46] real come way too late
[1:05:50] because i've seen it
[1:05:53] like like when elijah come out there and
[1:05:55] he had his little servant there
[1:05:57] and he's all master what are we going to
[1:05:59] do the
[1:06:00] syrian army is all surrounding me what
[1:06:02] are we going to do
[1:06:05] well there stands a prophet his eyes
[1:06:08] were already open
[1:06:12] praise god for a prophet and he said oh
[1:06:15] lord
[1:06:17] opened his eyes and when he opened his
[1:06:19] eyes he saw that there was more with
[1:06:22] them
[1:06:22] that were against him oh when your eyes
[1:06:25] come open
[1:06:26] all the fear all the doubt all the
[1:06:29] unbelief
[1:06:30] everything just vanishes away and no
[1:06:33] matter what the enemy can throw at you
[1:06:37] it's too late i'm changed i'm different
[1:06:40] i got a different nature i'm not living
[1:06:44] up here in the realms of my carnal mind
[1:06:45] and theology and trying to
[1:06:47] piece everything together oh that
[1:06:48] something's happened
[1:06:50] i've been changed
[1:07:00] we must have an anchor
[1:07:03] we've got to have an anchor that goes
[1:07:05] beyond tradition
[1:07:07] it goes beyond works and goes beyond a
[1:07:09] camp experience
[1:07:11] it has to be a life there there has to
[1:07:15] be a prevailing
[1:07:16] revelation inside of the believer that
[1:07:19] meets the challenge of the age
[1:07:22] you can't be living on something from
[1:07:23] the past
[1:07:25] and god forbid we be living on an
[1:07:27] experience from the past
[1:07:30] so i want to refill him lord i want more
[1:07:33] and more and more and more
[1:07:38] that's what jesus says in mark 7 13 he
[1:07:41] told the sadducees and pharisees he said
[1:07:44] you make the
[1:07:45] the word of god of none effect because
[1:07:46] of your traditions
[1:07:51] don't use a hay fork and pitch that off
[1:07:53] to the sadducees and pharisees
[1:07:56] that's for us we make this
[1:08:00] message a tradition
[1:08:04] we make going to church a tradition
[1:08:11] let me just speak for myself because i
[1:08:14] don't want to try to
[1:08:15] to uh uh indict anybody else
[1:08:20] we work we wake up we work work work
[1:08:22] work come home work work
[1:08:24] work come home work work work oh gotta
[1:08:26] get to church
[1:08:28] get ready get ready get the kids get the
[1:08:30] food get the car get there get to church
[1:08:32] on time oh they're singing songs we're
[1:08:34] singing songs praise god singing songs
[1:08:35] the preachers preaching
[1:08:36] preach preacher preach but oh
[1:08:41] oh if we if we can if we can get into
[1:08:43] the spirit
[1:08:44] if we can get into the unity i often
[1:08:47] like to challenge myself and think of it
[1:08:48] like this
[1:08:49] matter of fact like what what would you
[1:08:51] do maybe you just think if if
[1:08:54] if it was brother branham was preaching
[1:08:55] tonight
[1:08:57] or if it was paul or your or one of your
[1:08:59] favorite ministers how about we do that
[1:09:02] and we can't help it i i it it there's
[1:09:04] there's a natural tendency
[1:09:06] to where we allow the routine and we
[1:09:08] allow the traditions and allow things to
[1:09:10] become mundane
[1:09:11] to where it affects our expectation
[1:09:15] but oh if we can come with such an
[1:09:17] anticipation
[1:09:18] in our heart to where at least look you
[1:09:21] be the one that's so full of the holy
[1:09:22] ghost and so full of god that your cups
[1:09:25] so overflow and that people in the song
[1:09:26] service go like praise god hallelujah
[1:09:29] i wasn't feeling too good but man this
[1:09:30] sister gots it tonight
[1:09:32] she's making me happy bring the joy of
[1:09:35] the lord to you into the house of god
[1:09:37] why don't we act like we've been
[1:09:38] delivered why don't we act like we've
[1:09:40] been set free
[1:09:41] why don't we act like we're going in a
[1:09:43] rapture why don't we praise god like
[1:09:45] where we're going
[1:09:46] oh i can't wait to get over there there
[1:09:48] ain't going to be no hindrances on the
[1:09:50] other side
[1:09:51] we'll be dancing and we'll be shouting
[1:09:53] why i say why wait
[1:09:56] let's don't wait any longer i'll let the
[1:09:58] joy of the lord
[1:09:59] just overflow in your heart oh i ain't
[1:10:02] trying to
[1:10:03] i ain't trying to preach fanaticism here
[1:10:07] but be free
[1:10:11] be free you want to run
[1:10:14] you want to scream me you want to shout
[1:10:16] i never forget a brother called me up
[1:10:17] one time he was coming home from a ball
[1:10:19] game
[1:10:20] and he said oh man man we won
[1:10:24] we won it at the very end we won it all
[1:10:26] you know i can't remember if it was the
[1:10:28] championship or something like that he
[1:10:29] goes man i was so happy
[1:10:31] i ran down the stairs i ran back up and
[1:10:33] i was giving everybody five
[1:10:35] i said praise the lord brother now we
[1:10:36] just need to get you to do that in
[1:10:37] church
[1:10:42] and i didn't hear for him for a little
[1:10:44] bit
[1:10:46] we got back together we represent he's
[1:10:49] like you know what
[1:10:53] that was a miserable trip home that
[1:10:54] night because he's a believer
[1:10:58] and that penetrated through all the
[1:11:01] fluff
[1:11:02] of lady osea through all the temporaries
[1:11:05] look i've gotten caught up in swine
[1:11:07] saying there's anything wrong with it i
[1:11:08] root for the home teams and
[1:11:10] and i can enjoy those things but it's so
[1:11:13] easy to get caught up where it affects
[1:11:14] you emotionally
[1:11:16] and all of a sudden you're invested and
[1:11:18] it's actually affecting your peace
[1:11:21] praise god i learned a long time ago
[1:11:23] whenever i'm disappointed praise god i'm
[1:11:25] a christian
[1:11:28] and i just move that right back
[1:11:32] that losing season that injured
[1:11:35] quarterback
[1:11:36] praise god i i praise god i'm a
[1:11:38] christian
[1:11:39] my quarterback can never be injured he
[1:11:41] was injured on calvary
[1:11:43] he was put in the grave but he rose on
[1:11:45] the third day and he'll never be injured
[1:11:47] again
[1:11:48] and because i live ye live also
[1:11:51] oh we got something to sing about we got
[1:11:53] something to shout about
[1:11:55] all of this nonsense of the world that
[1:11:57] we can get all happy about and scream
[1:11:59] and shout about
[1:12:00] oh if we can just get into the presence
[1:12:02] of god and really start to worship i
[1:12:04] think of david when the ark started to
[1:12:06] come on
[1:12:06] oh he just got beside himself he started
[1:12:09] to dance because what did it represent
[1:12:11] oh
[1:12:11] victory was coming back to the camp the
[1:12:14] presence of the lord was coming back
[1:12:16] oh and we are sitting on the revealed
[1:12:18] word of the air
[1:12:19] victory is in the cap the presence of
[1:12:21] the almighty god the pillar fire
[1:12:23] is here he's in you and in you and in
[1:12:26] you
[1:12:27] and when we all come together oh what
[1:12:29] kind of atmosphere should it be
[1:12:32] oh hallelujah
[1:12:35] oh these signs shall follow them that
[1:12:37] believe
[1:12:39] i'm looking for the manifestation i'm
[1:12:42] looking to get away from the theology
[1:12:44] and the mind and the
[1:12:49] the flesh ways of making this great word
[1:12:52] of tradition
[1:12:54] it's easy to do look we we always want
[1:12:58] it's so easy to condemn the sadducees
[1:12:59] and pharisees
[1:13:01] so easy to condemn the israelites and
[1:13:04] the jews
[1:13:05] which they were the most religious and
[1:13:07] most right
[1:13:08] organized people on the face of the
[1:13:10] planet that was instituted by god
[1:13:13] they had moses for their prophet and
[1:13:15] they had the testimonies
[1:13:17] but they had got to a place to where
[1:13:19] when the word continued to unfold and
[1:13:21] was continued to lead they were stuck in
[1:13:23] their traditions
[1:13:25] we we've done it this way in so long
[1:13:28] when i say oh god may i not be stuck
[1:13:29] there lord if you want to do something
[1:13:31] different tonight
[1:13:32] if you want to do something different in
[1:13:33] the morning lord here i am
[1:13:35] if your spirit wants to pour out on us
[1:13:38] and everybody starts to do
[1:13:39] uh something of an operation of a gift
[1:13:42] or rejoicing in the lord
[1:13:43] whatever you want to do lord i don't
[1:13:45] want to be so conformed into my mind
[1:13:47] that things have to go this way
[1:13:49] and i'm not just speaking of just here
[1:13:50] in the house of god but in our daily
[1:13:52] lives
[1:13:53] don't you be surprised if you're on your
[1:13:55] way to work
[1:13:56] and something tells you to make a
[1:13:57] right-hand turn
[1:14:00] although we despise the still-small
[1:14:02] voice of the lord
[1:14:04] we should be looking for it we had an
[1:14:06] example in our day
[1:14:08] who is catching a plane if if anybody
[1:14:10] what i mean
[1:14:12] look if you miss an airplane taking off
[1:14:14] they can't make a left-hand turn and
[1:14:15] come back and get you
[1:14:18] you better be there to get through
[1:14:19] security and be there on time because if
[1:14:20] that plane leaves
[1:14:22] you're out of a bunch of money and a
[1:14:23] bunch of time
[1:14:26] in my be really hard to get
[1:14:29] get a son of god or daughter of god now
[1:14:31] to to
[1:14:32] well wait a second lord my plane leaves
[1:14:35] in 30 minutes
[1:14:37] so that can't be you talking
[1:14:43] but you know the prophet he was a man
[1:14:46] just like we are
[1:14:48] he's our brother and he had to battle
[1:14:51] the same things
[1:14:53] oh he's so transparent over and over
[1:14:55] he's like
[1:14:56] nope that that's not him but all he
[1:14:59] would keep pressing
[1:15:01] keep pressing all of a sudden he he'd
[1:15:02] learn by then all right
[1:15:04] bye bye plane and you know the story how
[1:15:07] it goes
[1:15:08] there was there was a woman in need who
[1:15:10] had been praying for an elijah she said
[1:15:12] where's my elijah
[1:15:14] and god sent him on this way can god not
[1:15:17] do that
[1:15:19] with you can god not use you
[1:15:23] to be going through your normal day and
[1:15:25] say you know what why don't you pull
[1:15:26] aside and pray
[1:15:28] well we're such a routine we're in such
[1:15:30] a a busy in the things of the day that
[1:15:32] we hardly have time for god
[1:15:41] you know experience is good
[1:15:44] but it's not good enough i had an
[1:15:47] experience when i was 12.
[1:15:51] and i learned something as the years
[1:15:52] went by
[1:15:54] i needed to get the spirit of the
[1:15:55] experience
[1:15:58] look i was 12 years old i was at youth
[1:16:00] camp it was supernatural i usually
[1:16:02] hardened my heart you know i didn't you
[1:16:04] know when
[1:16:04] when i was getting towards the climax of
[1:16:06] the service but you know i'd used up my
[1:16:08] two bathroom breaks and
[1:16:10] and i got back into the service and and
[1:16:13] i was stuck but you know one thing i had
[1:16:14] going for me i was tired so
[1:16:16] somebody let me fall asleep
[1:16:19] but all god was smiling down there
[1:16:22] because
[1:16:23] like i said i just i i maybe would have
[1:16:25] resent to the word but i just remember
[1:16:26] waking up and i was in the presence of
[1:16:28] god and something pulled me out of my
[1:16:29] seat
[1:16:30] and something pulled me to the front and
[1:16:32] some pulled me to the baptismal pool and
[1:16:34] something
[1:16:35] pulled me in such a way that i knew god
[1:16:37] was real
[1:16:39] but you know what i knew god was real
[1:16:42] but i didn't get the god that revealed
[1:16:43] himself to me
[1:16:45] inside of me i didn't feed that fire i
[1:16:48] didn't continue
[1:16:49] and when i got back home uh i ended up
[1:16:52] feeding that black dog and and ended up
[1:16:54] going out into the world but by his
[1:16:55] grace
[1:16:56] i come to know him in the power of his
[1:16:58] resurrection later on in life
[1:17:00] but i just want to say that you know
[1:17:02] experience is good
[1:17:03] but but we got to have that that we got
[1:17:06] to have the holy ghost that quickening
[1:17:08] spirit
[1:17:09] living inside of us and i just want to
[1:17:11] read this scripture here
[1:17:16] corinthians 13 2.
[1:17:25] i say it it's wonderful when he pours
[1:17:28] out his spirit
[1:17:30] has anybody ever been in a church
[1:17:31] service where the presence of the lord
[1:17:33] is just moving
[1:17:35] i've been in church service where it's
[1:17:36] like in waves you actually see it come
[1:17:39] over the congregation over here and go
[1:17:40] towards the back and then come back down
[1:17:42] the front
[1:17:43] and the holy ghost just moving it's so
[1:17:44] thick you want to get a you want to get
[1:17:46] like a bag and bag it up
[1:17:49] i want to take it with me
[1:17:52] but you can
[1:17:55] you can you can have that holy spirit
[1:17:57] with you every day of your life
[1:18:01] you just invite him to come into your
[1:18:03] heart
[1:18:04] i read a news article uh here not long
[1:18:06] ago
[1:18:07] i think it was a seven-year-old that
[1:18:09] that committed suicide
[1:18:11] and every time i read something like
[1:18:13] that i say god
[1:18:15] that means our seven-year-olds can be
[1:18:16] born again and filled with the holy
[1:18:18] ghost
[1:18:19] if they can come to a place in their
[1:18:21] mind where they can make a decision to
[1:18:24] take their own life
[1:18:25] i believe our children can come to a
[1:18:26] place in a decision where they can
[1:18:28] surrender their life to jesus christ
[1:18:30] and be filled with the holy ghost if
[1:18:32] josiah or whatever
[1:18:33] there was a king that started to reign
[1:18:35] at seven oh that's in there to let us
[1:18:37] know that god can use our children
[1:18:40] and many times god does use our children
[1:18:41] but maybe we've got too much pride to
[1:18:43] hear from the mouth of a babe
[1:18:48] first corinthians 13 2
[1:18:53] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:18:55] and understand all the mysteries and
[1:18:56] knowledge
[1:18:57] and though i have all faith so that i
[1:18:59] could remove mountains
[1:19:00] and have not charity i am nothing
[1:19:06] if i have not love i am nothing
[1:19:11] you know there's two types of love
[1:19:13] there's a filio love
[1:19:16] and there's an agape love
[1:19:23] and we know that agape love is the love
[1:19:26] of god
[1:19:28] but you know you think of affiliate love
[1:19:32] that's not to be belittled you know man
[1:19:34] was made in the image of god and when
[1:19:36] you start to think of a love
[1:19:38] of a mother and the love we have for one
[1:19:40] another and our families and
[1:19:41] and how we'll lay down our lives and and
[1:19:44] the very
[1:19:45] the very love that we possess for one
[1:19:47] another for our children
[1:19:49] my it's a very powerful thing you just
[1:19:52] think of mankind and the ability
[1:19:55] uh that that they have to show honor and
[1:19:58] to show patriotism
[1:20:00] and to lay their life down for somebody
[1:20:03] else
[1:20:04] i was i was just moved by looking into
[1:20:07] this
[1:20:07] um this article they they have in the
[1:20:11] arlington cemetery there in virginia
[1:20:13] it's called the tomb of the unknown
[1:20:15] soldier
[1:20:16] has anybody ever heard of that
[1:20:19] and to my shame i i don't know much
[1:20:21] about history or
[1:20:23] i just don't uh keep up on many things
[1:20:25] and nor
[1:20:26] feel i have the capacity to try to even
[1:20:28] retain
[1:20:29] but this just i never really heard or
[1:20:31] known of it before i
[1:20:32] maybe had seen a picture once upon a
[1:20:35] time but nothing ever grabbed me or
[1:20:36] caught me but i started to look into
[1:20:38] this
[1:20:39] this tomb of the the unknown soldier and
[1:20:42] there on the tomb i believe it says
[1:20:44] herein lies a a a an honored
[1:20:47] american soldier unknown but to god only
[1:20:52] and the story goes behind what they did
[1:20:54] with this memorial is
[1:20:56] through all of the years so through all
[1:20:57] the wars there's been
[1:20:59] uh unknown soldiers along the way that
[1:21:01] have given their lives
[1:21:04] on the battlefield and they
[1:21:07] they decided i don't know what president
[1:21:09] was but he wanted to bring
[1:21:10] a unknown soldier from from
[1:21:13] world war one and world war ii in
[1:21:15] vietnam and
[1:21:16] and he brought four unknown soldiers to
[1:21:19] this place and to this tomb
[1:21:21] as a representation of all of those
[1:21:25] unknown soldiers that have lost their
[1:21:27] lives on the battlefield
[1:21:30] and i thought you know what what an
[1:21:32] admirable thing to do you know just to
[1:21:34] to show some type of act of patriotism
[1:21:37] or show some type of honor
[1:21:38] to to to they don't even know them
[1:21:42] reminds me of the scripture that where
[1:21:44] it says you know when you have charities
[1:21:46] you show the same love for one another
[1:21:49] they don't know what this
[1:21:50] they don't know how they died who they
[1:21:52] were whether they were run and come and
[1:21:54] go and what they did
[1:21:56] but they were showing a value and an
[1:21:58] appreciation for the life that was
[1:22:00] was was was given on the sacrifice of
[1:22:02] freedom and i started to look at this
[1:22:05] and and what they do is these soldiers
[1:22:07] they they
[1:22:08] they're called tomb guards and they
[1:22:11] guard that tomb
[1:22:12] 24 hours a day seven days a week 365
[1:22:16] days a year
[1:22:18] 24 7 and they've been doing it since
[1:22:20] 1937.
[1:22:22] rain sunshine sleet snow
[1:22:26] whatever you call it they're there
[1:22:29] because they say they want that unknown
[1:22:31] soldier to rest in dignity
[1:22:33] and somebody to be there and i got to
[1:22:35] thinking about that my
[1:22:37] just think of of of the effort and the
[1:22:40] time and these soldiers
[1:22:42] uh they're dressed and they're so
[1:22:45] immaculate it takes them eight hours to
[1:22:48] prep their uniform and get prepared
[1:22:50] to go out there and stand guard
[1:22:54] and after they've they've gone through
[1:22:56] all the the routine and they make sure
[1:22:57] there's not a lit and everything is just
[1:22:59] perfect
[1:23:00] and they come out there and they do the
[1:23:02] walk and they do
[1:23:04] 21 steps and it's to signify a 21 gun
[1:23:08] salute and they look up for 21 seconds
[1:23:10] 21 gun salute which is the highest honor
[1:23:14] that you can give to a fallen soldier
[1:23:17] and they do that changing of the guard
[1:23:18] every hour or sometimes every 30 minutes
[1:23:20] they've been doing that since 1937
[1:23:23] for soldiers that are unknown
[1:23:28] in a tomb and i was just thinking in my
[1:23:31] heart
[1:23:31] if if mankind
[1:23:35] if mankind could show that type of
[1:23:37] commitment
[1:23:38] and that type of love or appreciation or
[1:23:41] patriotism
[1:23:42] for somebody they didn't even know or
[1:23:44] somebody they never even met
[1:23:46] i said oh god if they can do that in the
[1:23:48] filio
[1:23:49] oh can't be a godly love that you've
[1:23:51] shed a bride of my heart
[1:23:52] can't i give all to you and you're not
[1:23:55] in the tomb anymore
[1:23:56] but you've risen and ascended on high
[1:23:59] and you've sent your comforter back
[1:24:00] i said oh god why can't i give my all to
[1:24:02] you
[1:24:04] why can i surrender i want that agape
[1:24:06] love where i can commit my whole life
[1:24:09] to 365 days a year seven days a week
[1:24:12] every minute of every hour
[1:24:16] we can have that type of love and that
[1:24:17] type of an experience
[1:24:21] praise the lord i'd say i'd find a place
[1:24:22] to close but i really didn't have no
[1:24:24] place to start
[1:24:25] or stop so we'll just ask the musicians
[1:24:28] to come and we'll
[1:24:34] they would just read a quote in closing
[1:24:39] or if the spirit leads and we take off
[1:24:40] again we'll just however the lord leads
[1:24:43] if he does something different tonight
[1:24:44] that's alright amen
[1:24:49] i told jackson maybe we'll just have him
[1:24:50] come up and say something wait we we
[1:24:52] wouldn't do that to him though
[1:24:55] but corinthians goes on to say charity
[1:24:57] never faileth
[1:24:59] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:25:00] shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:25:02] they shall cease whether there be
[1:25:04] knowledge it shall vanish away
[1:25:07] the love of god is never going to fail
[1:25:10] it goes beyond the flesh it goes beyond
[1:25:12] the mind
[1:25:14] it produces a faith that's unwavering
[1:25:37] i was just thinking of
[1:25:43] the children of israel how they had the
[1:25:46] experience
[1:25:47] they had the word they had the law
[1:25:52] and yet when it came to kadesh barnea
[1:25:54] they'd
[1:25:55] come out under the blood they'd come
[1:25:58] through the red sea
[1:26:01] when it came time for them to cross over
[1:26:03] into the promised land they came to
[1:26:05] cadis barnea
[1:26:07] they came to a judgment seat they came
[1:26:10] to a time of testing
[1:26:13] the prophet said god always test his
[1:26:15] children by the word
[1:26:17] if you believe his word god tests you by
[1:26:19] his word
[1:26:21] our pastor on sunday said satan's always
[1:26:23] trying to change the narrative
[1:26:26] they were more than able to take the
[1:26:27] land
[1:26:29] but satan wanted to change the narrative
[1:26:33] so when the spies got back
[1:26:38] they started to give an evil report
[1:26:42] they started to say oh we're like
[1:26:43] grasshoppers and and all they're they're
[1:26:46] built up and they're strong and there's
[1:26:48] no way that we could ever take it
[1:26:51] and the people think of this
[1:26:55] i try to think of it in my mind but it
[1:26:57] just shows that oh there has to be a
[1:26:59] predestinated seed
[1:27:01] there has to be an election there has to
[1:27:03] be an ability
[1:27:04] to go past the mind and down into the
[1:27:07] heart
[1:27:08] where you're not believing with the mind
[1:27:10] but you're believing with the seed faith
[1:27:12] that god has placed there
[1:27:13] that no matter what comes up against you
[1:27:16] you're anchored
[1:27:18] because here these these are the same
[1:27:20] ones
[1:27:21] that were signed and crying because of
[1:27:23] the bondage they were in egypt
[1:27:26] these are the same ones that rejoiced
[1:27:28] when moses came
[1:27:30] as their deliverer
[1:27:34] and now they've they've they've seen the
[1:27:36] plagues they've seen the mighty hand
[1:27:37] they've seen the red sea
[1:27:39] party they've seen the pillar of fire in
[1:27:41] the cloud by night they've seen all
[1:27:42] these wonderful things
[1:27:45] but now when they come to kadesh barnea
[1:27:49] somebody starts preaching a false
[1:27:51] narrative
[1:27:53] somebody starts preaching you know this
[1:27:54] message really isn't everything that
[1:27:56] moses said it was
[1:27:58] and these same people that came out by a
[1:28:02] mighty strong end started to doubt
[1:28:04] whether they were able to take the land
[1:28:08] oh it's in there for principle because
[1:28:12] if you try to think that in your mind
[1:28:14] like you mean they saw the plagues come
[1:28:16] they saw the red sea part they saw their
[1:28:19] enemy swallowed up in the red sea
[1:28:21] they were fed with mana they they had
[1:28:23] quail come in
[1:28:24] uh the the rock was smitten we saw the
[1:28:26] pillar of fire we heard
[1:28:28] god speak to us over and over
[1:28:31] testimony after testimony and they had
[1:28:33] seen it with their own eyes
[1:28:37] and these same people when these spies
[1:28:39] come back and start to give a negative
[1:28:41] report
[1:28:42] they start to say oh why did you leave
[1:28:44] us out here why did you lead us out here
[1:28:46] we we would you have us die here and
[1:28:49] they started to ask for for
[1:28:51] for a captain to take him back to egypt
[1:28:54] but i love how caleb stealed the people
[1:28:56] and he said no
[1:28:58] no we're more than able to take it
[1:29:02] we're more than able to take the land
[1:29:05] and i say the same thing to you you're
[1:29:07] more than able to possess the land
[1:29:09] you're more than able to overcome a
[1:29:11] negative report
[1:29:12] you're more than able to overcome if you
[1:29:14] can't find some
[1:29:16] news article on so many people falling
[1:29:18] off a bridge you're more than able to
[1:29:20] overcome a negative report
[1:29:21] you're more than able to overcome if he
[1:29:24] wasn't over here and the cloud was on
[1:29:26] you're way more able to overcome that
[1:29:29] because it's not you that liveth but
[1:29:31] it's christ that liveth in you
[1:29:33] and it's that quickening power that has
[1:29:36] come down on the inside
[1:29:38] of you it will raise you out of the
[1:29:41] grave let's stand
[1:29:48] i'm gonna put sister nikki on the spot
[1:29:52] that song you sang the other night was
[1:29:53] awesome
[1:29:55] who played the piano for you
[1:29:59] praise the lord that's a good jubilee
[1:30:00] song right there
[1:30:03] let's praise the lord i've been wanting
[1:30:06] to hear that song again
[1:30:08] so there's our different that's our
[1:30:10] mix-up for tonight i believe that'll be
[1:30:12] a good way to
[1:30:14] to end the service we have
[1:30:18] sister nikki come sing that song for us
[1:30:21] but oh i just pray something that was
[1:30:23] said that could
[1:30:25] oh that could just encourage us
[1:30:30] the prophet said brother when you hear
[1:30:34] that scream
[1:30:35] there's something in you you're an eagle
[1:30:38] to begin with
[1:30:39] why you are the seed that the
[1:30:41] resurrection of the s-o-n has dawned in
[1:30:43] the wave sheath upon the earth to make
[1:30:45] you recognize
[1:30:46] that you're an eagle and not a
[1:30:48] denominational chicken
[1:30:50] you see it now if the spirit that raised
[1:30:52] him from the dead
[1:30:54] the word the dynamic of the word dwells
[1:30:56] in you it also quickens your mortal body
[1:30:59] now how are we flesh of his flesh and
[1:31:01] bone of his bone because quickly while
[1:31:03] we were yet mortal sinners mortal ready
[1:31:07] to die
[1:31:07] these bodies it quickened that body
[1:31:10] what's quick and brings to life
[1:31:12] the spirit that once liked to drink run
[1:31:14] around commit adultery and all these
[1:31:16] all these things it's quickened why the
[1:31:19] thing
[1:31:19] died and you are resurrected it quickens
[1:31:22] your mortal bodies
[1:31:23] therefore your body is the temple of the
[1:31:25] dynamics because why
[1:31:27] from the beginning you are part of the
[1:31:29] mechanics oh there's your resurrection
[1:31:32] there is the church in the resurrection
[1:31:34] with him these bodies right now are
[1:31:36] quick and see you've heard
[1:31:38] you believe it changed you from a
[1:31:40] denomination to the word see
[1:31:42] the dynamics it comes upon the water
[1:31:47] the dynamics if it comes upon water
[1:31:49] it'll just sputter
[1:31:50] days of miracles are passed oh i believe
[1:31:53] the bible pom-pom papa but
[1:31:55] there ain't no pop-pop pop see but when
[1:31:57] it hits
[1:31:58] that 1000 octane room aware goes you see
[1:32:01] oh my the dynamics strike that
[1:32:04] but it'll strike a chicken it won't do
[1:32:06] no good but when it strikes the eagle he
[1:32:08] moves out amen
[1:32:10] the dynamics with the mechanics see what
[1:32:12] i mean that's it
[1:32:13] if it's a true eagle now he will
[1:32:16] understand
[1:32:17] oh not a not a theology
[1:32:21] you say brother matthew what do i do i
[1:32:24] see the massacre would
[1:32:26] i i recognize that i want to believe
[1:32:27] what the prophets say
[1:32:29] just start flopping your wings just not
[1:32:32] he didn't say start
[1:32:33] soaring like an eagle he said just start
[1:32:35] doing something
[1:32:37] just raise your ass say oh god help me
[1:32:39] lord i
[1:32:40] repent lord forgive me of all i says
[1:32:42] start to testify
[1:32:44] on the tape of our pastor mentioned on
[1:32:47] sunday

[1:32:49] housewife pick up the phone and call
[1:32:51] somebody

[1:32:53] status change your profile
