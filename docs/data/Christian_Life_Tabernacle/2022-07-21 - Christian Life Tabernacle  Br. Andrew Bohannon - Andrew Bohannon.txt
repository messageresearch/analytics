========================================

vain because you paid a price lord and we look back in calvary and we see there's a finished work lord and even now lord we just desire that the blood that you shed would atone for us lord would cover us all of our wrongdoings lord all of our past failures lord all of what we try to hinder the move of this service lord we claim those bloodstains for healing tonight father even father will you speak o god tonight lord me as a mortal man lord i can do nothing lord without you lord but we ask that you would be the listener and the speaker tonight lord may our hearts be bound together by what you've done in this hour lord the faith that you've delivered father we desire that you would move according to your will as we commit each heart here to you we ask your blessings in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord how many happy to be a christian tonight amen well we'll get right to the word if you have your bibles we're going to lord put something on my heart out of saint mark chapter 11. just was fellowshipping a little bit over the past weekend and just a little something the lord put on my heart on see if i can get out of the way to deliver my burden amen so in mark chapter 11 very familia familiar scripture reading found in verse 22. the scripture reads here in mark 11 22 he says and jesus answered saying unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he hath said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things so ever you desire when you pray believe that you have received them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen and then also i want to take a scripture out of james chapter 4. we'll start there in verse 7. scripture reads in james chapter 4 verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh unto god and he will draw an iron to you cleanse your hands you sinners and put your hearts purify your hearts ye double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned in the morning in your joy into heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up amen you may have your seats trust the lord what a blessing to the reading of his word you know as we were going through the the message perfect faith brother branham said in verse 19 the perfect faith he says now faith is based on forgiveness then and then we said the morning trying to get to the church to a place where we can really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we hung we all hunger it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it amen how many have seen it how many want to see more of it amen praise god we want to see more of it we want to it to such a flow that it'll help us flow out of it will help us us flow out to others remember jesus he never used his power for himself he used it for others and that's what it was sent for and you think sometimes why a man so full of power like him that he would have to ever be sick yes sir and then he goes on to read about the book where he had the headache you know and it just it's just striking how you know we all have a common place and that's under the shed blood of the lamb of god amen and so that's where our fellowship is is and that's where our faith remains is what it's based on forgiveness you know there was a perfect love that that spread his arms on a cross called calvary amen and though you know we we come into this world the bible says we come into this world speaking lies we we were born in sin shaped in iniquity amen and and we didn't live by the faith that has been restored in this hour but we lived by an intellectual understanding right amen and so as we go through just want to maybe lay up a little bit of a thought on your mind where the lord's just kind of directing me is we want to be submitted to his love amen you know and and for the cause to yield a peaceable fruit you know god's called us in this time he said now you abide in me and my word abide in you you will ask what you will and and it is god's desire amen it is god's desire that we be fruitful for the kingdom of god amen and so we want to come to a place where we're submitted to his love so that he can yield his fruit in its season amen we're not trying to get out there in the world and rub shoulders with the world so we can bear a bunch of business fruit and have a bunch of stocks and bonds and and you know if if god blesses us with that that's great but we want to see the resurrected savior bearing the fruit of that brings peace you know the scripture says in one place he says we want to have peace with all men amen and there's so much strife going on in the world and and where is there a peace where has the the introduction of shalom come amen i believe there's a people tonight that have heard the call of shalom good morning aren't you grateful that god made peace like like when he died on the calvary he he said it was by the blood of the cross that he made peace amen aren't you glad you've been invited to have peace and that the the burden of sin no longer is is you're not holding the burden of sin no more that you've turned it loose this word submit is to leave the approval or the judgment of a plan to someone else for consideration so if you submit like the plans to the church we're looking for approval how many people in this world are looking for others approval you know there there's a people that are looking for the approval of someone to give them a thumbs up on twitter or whatever those you know give me a like or you know uh how can i gain someone's approval can i be the net you know the next widget maker you know that that you know uh makes me the millions you know there's something hungering for approval right what is that there's a hunger in a thirst placed with in a human being that drives them god placed that hunger and that thirst in them to to reveal and to expose what they have need of right you start getting real thirsty well it's 108 degrees or whatever it's been maybe when was the last time you had a drink of water you know and all of a sudden you know sometimes life circumstance happen you get you know you get a little sickness and then all of a sudden there's something inside that says i'm i'm hungry for some healing you know you start seeing uh there's some loved ones that are lost and all of a sudden you start hunger and i want to see a savior on the scene what is that what is that we want to submit to some power there's no greater power than the love of god amen if you've ever tasted that love in the way of forgiveness you're never the same amen you know the um the submission is to yield or to surrender your authority or your control in your choice you know it's it's a hard thing to die out to the will of it isn't it isn't it something it's almost like you have to lose all of your identity all what your self-worth was and that's not easy you know the scripture says in hebrews comes to my mind it says in hebrews to please god it has to be by faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him so this is not something we'll just approach him haphazardly where all the sudden we can just show up and not give all we you know we can't just be half-hearted in our submission you know this the kind of love that we want to submit to is not a human love this is a love that gave all this is a love that is unending like the song says i mean to be able to stand and he endured such a contradiction with sinners and he was he he they could not they accused him but where did he not fulfill the scriptures you know and and you know if there's a is if there's a painful desire in my heart is to have the same love that he had for me to go out to others amen isn't that a craving you want to yield that peaceable fruit that you can yield your life in such a way the same love that he loved you with that you can bear when someone crosses you when someone actually mocks you ridicules you spits in your face and you got a 50 on that test are you a dummy and you know what maybe i could have studied a little bit better you know they call it taking the high road you know doesn't love covered a multitude of unbelief amen isn't there power of life and death in the tongue i mean you're talking about a life that's that's yielding a peaceable fruit can stand there so submitted to another love another life that they can though they've been cast off and isolated all alone feeling like nobody's there and yet you know that god hasn't left you nor forsaken you and that's enough and we don't have to ridicule because so that's what he did he held his peace amen i believe that love can help us to hold our peace and to speak when it's needed god we stroking you some rain it's been hot you know our farmers they're probably drying up parched you know we could pray for some some of the farmers to have some rain and you know maybe some farmers in here sowing some seeds of faith out there they can ask for some rain we want to see a harvest we want to see the seeds of love go out because we want to see the fruit of peace you know we can point say i want that one to do it i want that one to do it but what about this one you know where are we gonna give an account you know this is where we get i mean we we can have we can go rejoicing we can do the running on the aisles but really where the real grind is where the real christian faith the rugged is in the trenches you know when you're driving down the road and the guy cuts you off you know i like it one of the brothers was testifying during the the brothers breakfast about how the power of the the perfect faith that had been exposed in his life when when someone would cross him and he would get he used to get real angry but now it was a real miracle because he wasn't getting mad you know sometimes it's in the little things that we overlook you know there's a great victory in the little things if we can just recognize that's god that's god doing for me that's because his love for me being a recipient of his love he wants us to have victory in the little things not just the big things oh i had a broken back god's supernatural that's great and i made a vow i would serve him you know but i'm certainly grateful that he's teaching me aren't you glad you have a teachable spirit that's another fruit of his peaceable love amen that you're teachable you know oh i'm i'm i'm sealed i'm saved and you know ain't nobody can tell me nothing what kind of attitude hi scripture says in second timothy 3 16 it says all scripture is given by inspiration of god and it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen isn't that what we want we want this the inspired scriptures to give us that reprove you know this love that we're speaking of when we submit to it a lot of people don't understand love but praise god that we know that love is corrective you know if you have children and you just kind of let them run in the streets and and do whatever they want that's not real love that's that's a dodie grandpa but but a real father will step in and say you're going the wrong way there's a there's an enemy out there there's a danger that that's liable to take your life put you in bondage but thanks god thanks be to god that the scripture is given by inspiration of god not of man amen this wisdom come not from man it is profitable for doctrine reproof and correction and instruction in righteousness praise god you know we're living in a great time where we know that it's been promised a rapturing faith we know that third pool is on we know that we've been given authority we've been given power that we can speak creation it's not just taking what was created and and multiplying creation but now this is actually creation by the spoken word my now you're talking about something as a body like god's not just going to give it to show off we're going to need it we're coming to a place where like you know it just reminds me you know we want to know what we are what we've been called to a lot of times people if you don't know you've been given authority and you're speaking you can be speaking creation on things that are negative the scripture says the things that job feared he brought it to him what was that what was that because there is an authority in a child of god amen so we want that unruly member to be governed by love what what what does my father god is love what did what did god say concerning this praise god the scripture says in hebrews 12 i won't be very long tonight lord willing would just share this kind of a direct thought about just being yielded and submitted to this love because we want that peaceable fruit to be manifested in our lives and through our lives hebrews 12 and verse 3 for consider him that endured such a contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and feigning your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son he receiveth if you endure chastening god deal with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not amen what an identification a son chastise who who loves that who wants to be nobody wants correction but praise god what an identity like you know none of us were born adults knowing that even jesus himself was born in the scripture says he learned obedience by the things that he suffered amen we want to have the right vision of the things that we're enduring today god is training us up god has given us power over our speech if you endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which correct us and we have given them reverence what shall we not much much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for ver for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness what a benefit i mean who you put that reward out there we can be a partaker of his holiness that's what this thing says holy bible we want to be a partaker of his holiness what a what an entrance that's been made that we can be corrected and god could come and live his own life out and bear the fruit of righteousness in our life that's what we want to be surrendered to is that great love to see him coming in his word in our sanctified vessel because he paid the price now he can live in you he can live in you he can live in you and he can perform the very same works he did when he was on earth in your world in your situation in your work environment in your household now will we let him do it we have to come to that place where it says the submission is to yield to another one's authority to give up that control and be the choice of another well i tell you if you've ever tasted the love of god you want more of it it's worth surrendering to i don't know how the devil he's so conniving and so tricky he's like oh you don't want that the best thing available to man the very love of god in forgiveness to become a son or a daughter of god to be in relationship to grow in grace and knowledge my praise the lord in verse 11 it says now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous but grievous nevertheless after it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the holy hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight the paths of your feet lest that which is lame is turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness for without it no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you thereby many are defiled my you know we want to see the lord we want to see jesus amen you know an outstanding statement that brother branham made in perfect faith it's found in paragraph 132. he said now when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in the muck and mire of sin and and god sought us he sought us out in the scripture says no man come to me except the father draw him god came down in the muck where you were and sought you and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he promised you then real genuine love will create confidence in his word amen oh i love that i love that and brother branham's making this it's this is where we want to personalize this you know he he he caught me when i was nothing and i'm still nothing is anybody here had something that they could offer god when he came to you i mean i'm nothing and i'm still nothing but i'm in his hands that's that's my identification i'm nothing if it wasn't for the grace of god we we'd all perish but i'm in his hands you know when the devil comes and he's starting to push you around say wait a minute i'm in his hands who can bring anything to the charge of god's elect i'm in his hands you're in his hands the devil can come make accusations but you could just point to a cross you can point to an empty tomb you can point to a heart that's pulsating with the king living inside i'm in his hands he caught me he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when you were unlovable he changed you just like that colored sister said in her testimony i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be but i'm not what i used to be hello i'm not what i used to be praise god and that's because of love hallelujah she know she was she had come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when you when i was alienated from him so loved me till he stooped down and picked me up it gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he's got a reason to save you look at the people that's in the unsaved today look at the millions that he could have took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen no one can take your place you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you amen in that wonderful god came to you in your dark hour when you had no hope when life wasn't worth living you didn't even regard the life that was in a seed form inside of you you were just minding the things that you were in front of you let me try to figure this world out what where's my place in this world am i a part of this group where am i going to make my greatest impact this is where my lasting value this is where i'll leave my legacy we had like a vision of what we thought how how it should be but god one day he pulled you out of that he says i got something so much greater and it gives us a confidence that he wants to use us that devil comes and says you ain't no good you ain't got no testimony why did god come satan why did god come and pay the price for me why did he pay the price for you he said he wants to use you he's got something for you to do amen praise god i'm glad that god's got something for me to do you know i heard it said this way he said anything that god that serves god's purpose is going to have a resurrection amen so how many in here care tonight to know what your purpose is god is resurrecting a divine love and a people in this dark hour in satan's eden where man is running to and fro seeking purpose meaning in life and yet there's a people that are shining the light of god's love amen praise god well i'm so happy you know this this perfect faith that brother branham was preaching about as i was digging in this i started realizing how little i really know what he's talking about but i know the author and i know there's something that pulsates inside that says amen you know he's talking about faith and not just any kind of faith but perfect faith a perfect faith that knows what the word says and how god wants to execute it in our lives to be yielded to be submitted to be surrendered that god himself comes and energizes the promise to make it live we can't do it we need god to do it and there's a love that anchors that says i believe he's going to do it because he promised he was going to bring that to perfection what's concerning us amen in verse or in paragraph 76 in in perfect faith he says notice where he said unto us he said to us if you abide in me and my word abide in you saint john 15 if you abide in me see if you abide in me and my word abides in you you can ask what you will now see he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce what he knew what he was now if you abide in me and my word in you you know what you know what you are amen how many want to do more abiding i want to do more abiding this is where we know where we are we can look into the mirror of god's word and say i can take you at your word i can have a confidence of what the word says about me it is written of me how many want to grow in that and say to the devil when he comes knocking and trying to accuse and say it is written of me this is coming into that perfect faith he says you know who you are you ask what you will to be given won't that be wonderful tonight if everybody could come in the prayer line and say i'm a christian there's no condemnation i know that my heart is condemning not something tells me that tonight's the end of my suffering that's you believe you'll go away with something no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it won't work that perfect faith has to manifest and identified itself in you as a substance and then and when it does there's nothing going to shake it shake you from it now you just trust the lord to kind of change something because the scripture is noticing and if your heart condemned not you can have confidence towards god you know and the scripture i i believe it was the mark 11 says verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and do thou and be thou cast into the sea and thou shall not doubt in his heart you know doubt is an ugly thing doubt is sin doubt is unbelief and see saying right here if you don't if there's no condemnation in your heart you can ask what you will you know that's where the devil tries to snare me up he's trying to snare you up oh oh you remember that day do you remember that would you remember that day you remember that day do you remember that day when he appeared in the cloud and he restored authority do you remember that day he spoke about the the statue of a perfect man well if our hearts condemn us there's one greater hallelujah you know the devil is a defeated foe he's just bluffing us trying to keep us from taking the land that god already paid for us to possess blind devil the message we would see jesus in in paragraph 21 he says when a man is converted his eyes are set towards calvary if he's still just a little nervous if you don't watch it him he will go over on the fanatic side if he's just a little scholarly he'll go over on the starchy side but right in the middle of the road is the same sensible born again spirit-led endured endued church of the living god going straight down the road with christ that's the real coming from that's the real coming from both sides we went one way and and one went the other way shows fanaticism and the others scholarly too stiff to bow you know more about the word of god than about the author to know him to to know the word to work to know the words not life but to know him as life to know him you don't have a scholarly you have to be a submitted person you have to be and when you submit yourself to christ christ is obligated to feel that vacancy and that you poured out on the altar to him he's obligated to his word to do it and he will not fail aren't you grateful it's just that simple you know god's not looking for the scholarly he's not looking for the starchy he's looking for one that would submit their heart you know and it's not just a one time you know when i was 13 and or when i was 18. but it's in every day i want to submit i want to surrender i want to be a submitted person you know walk humbly before the lord amen you know another thing brother branham was talking about in perfect perfect faith he said you know you want to you want to know that these things are for you and the devil is always trying to say it's not for you you know you know about culture or where you were born at or how you were raised up and your family's broken and all of those reasons why it's not for you but the bible says he died for you and it's to you and to your children and to as many as the lord our god shall call and he's still calling tonight so these promises are for you so you can have faith that god said it's for you amen you know in this this really stood out in perfect faith in in paragraph 97 he says now you must recognize or you must believe what you asked for if you are a believer recognize yourself a believer recognize that these things are for you if there's condemnation in your life straighten that first see if you got condemnation in he says you might have oral roberts and a dozen people who have faith come over here and pray over you and jump up and down and pour oil by the gallons and still it won't move that's right what falls off from oral roberts meetings and that i checked him through the prayer lines and i hear that him say his prayer before them a man with dark hair and a kind of big fellow with big jaw that oral roberts see and and that certain city and certain thing yes that's right see you was prayed for such and such man see that but here it is here's your trouble see go make that thing right go out there and confess that sin to your husband to your wife go do this thing it'll never do you any good no matter who you pray for until they make that right condemnation in your heart god will not come in a condemned a heart condemned see but god don't dwell in that you got to make it right then when you do you have you must have faith if everything's right you must have faith and believe and don't be afraid amen see that fear that job had and brother branham goes down into speaking of it that was a that was a substance of something and that's what we don't want to manifest we don't want to manifest when condemnation comes when we did wrong and then now we're speaking from a standpoint of fear can we discern within ourselves if if what we're speaking from is from the standpoint of god has covered me god he loves me and now this great love is projecting out through me or is am i starting to get a little nervous is what i'm saying is this out of a heart of fear and doubt because we we're living too late of an hour to get tripped up by the devil constantly trying to tell us all of these things where we have to oh i'm going to panic i'm not gonna make it no god's already put your name in the book of life he sealed your eternal destination the price that he paid was worthy of all sin so we just want to get that thing right and get to go we want to see that apostolic faith moving again it doesn't matter how many times we've been prayed for and who prays for us and how much oil they but if we got things that aren't right let's make them right amen let's go to the devil and tell them you devil you've been locking me down with this thing for too long i'm done with you amen does there are people that have the courage tonight to be able to say to the devil i'm done with you you've lied to me long enough you know i noticed that there's this thing and and brother branham talks about in a he asked a medical doctor the first thing you try to do is get get to do is to have confidence in the medicine they're giving you if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone sure what is it it's faith that does the healing it's faith that does it all the time and isn't it something that medical science they do a lot of their testing on new medicines and things they have these clinical trials where they would have these study groups this group over here would take the new medicine and then this group of people they would take like a sugar pill and then they would test to see the effectiveness of the medicine versus the other group and so a lot of the people who are taking the sugar pills are getting healed what's going on with that you know if they got eczema and they come up with this new product and the the two thousand people over here going man i'm not itching as much and the eczema is going away and i can tell it's working and then half the people over here going yeah this is really working the eczema is going away what wait a minute and so it's not disclosed until later what is it it's their faith working it's faith that heals they call it the placebo effect see what you can believe for you can create if you let your fear go to work what is it going to provide you a bunch of chaos a bunch of uncertainty faith that does the healing amen i love this point and we all know it in verse in paragraph 114 it says so when a man lives by faith he walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there is now and there now we're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor now deacons trustees that means for the laity and every individual that walks in the world walks in a world with god alone amen in that wonderful you know what what a high calling god he's provided us and and that's just the thing though sometimes we're afraid to walk alone with god we're not going to go in the group now we come together because of what the work that god's done we have that common fellowship but oh my to walk with this substance faith we walk with god alone amen my my this is plunged full of good nuggets you know i i was like never before when i was when i was reading the message and i was hearing brother branham talk about the woman that touched jesus garment you know she's seen something in jesus that she believed that if she could just touch his garment that she would be well you know i'm not exactly sure if brother branham talked about her having any other scripture or any of the scrolls to validate that but she believed it so much so that when she got the healing virtue other people started touching him you know our lives when we touch jesus they have an effect on others they say wow what is the difference i want to go and touch jesus like he did and get the same result god's no respecter of persons i love it how he says here in uh paragraph 141 he says by by his faith in his word we he conquers we can conquer anything both death hell in the grave we know that god is god that perfect faith in a perfect god's perfect word he conquers anything that comes in contact with death he conquered everything death could not stand in his presence sickness could not stand in his presence flowing from him was like rivers of virtue going out constantly virtue going from his garments these people were laying in the shadows just put their finger on his garment and was healed when the woman done that then everybody wanted to touch his garment because they seen that there was virtue going out of him constantly flowing like rivers there he was walking walking in a world perfect faith because he was the word now if you abide in me through him he brought the word to you and my word abide in you then walk the same kind of way virtue flowing from you rivers of god's fountain and blessing just flowing out to the people amen isn't that wonderful that that same fountain of blessing can flow to others and they can come and touch you and what god can do for them through you oh my woo praise god well i'm so happy about that oh my paragraph 148 look he knew that he pleased god my i believe there's there's a place that we can come to that in our testimony we can know that we please god he knew that he pleased god he knew that there was nothing on his life god had already testified this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased hear him this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in at the day of his baptism i'm pleased to make my abode in here there's no condemnation in him at all now when the same god comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you please to honor your word what your decision is oh my you see how the correction has to come first the condemnation has to be dealt with first there's things that we we do that's wrong but there's a grace there's a blood there's a power in confessing our faults one to another because he's faithful and just to forgive us we're our identity is not in our failure our identity is in what he did when he died and gave us the victory we don't have to be afraid of the devil's bluff we don't look at each other through our failures we look at each other because he chose us and he paid the ultimate price praise god that's just so wonderful aren't you thankful to be called to be the voice in this last hour to be able to be the the very vessels of mercy to be able to live out your life what god's done for you and then it contact the world and they can see that god's not dead god cares so much that he sends you to their world my in james 3 1-2 it says my brethren be not many masters knowing that ye shall receive the greater damnation for in many things we all offend if any man offend not in word the same man is perfect man and is able also to bridle his whole body you know this is a very important aspect of our walk because it's by our conversation it's by our actions it's by what we do and say that shines a light to others so we want to make our conversation always seasoned with salt to give grace to the here amen and also knowing that the way that we judge others is the same way we'll be judged my brother branham saying this and and no it did not in paragraph 122. now the outside man is the flesh that's what you look at what we see and that has five inlets to the body and any grammar school child may as myself would know that the five senses control the body see taste touch smell here without that you cannot touch the body that's the only way that we have to the body is see taste feel smell and hear you see it you taste it you feel it now that's the evil one and on the outside now inside of that is the spirit which you become when you're born into this world and the breath of life is breathed into him that's spirit is of a worldly nature because it is not given from god but it is permitted by god now you got that for every child that's born into the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies that's right so that person on the inside is a sinner to begin with my oh my i'm not going to make excuses for that outside guy no more he's just the sinner and that's the evil one and i'm not concerned that because what is on the inside is going to bring the outside subject amen the love of god can cause this outside man to come subject to every word further down in james 3 and 16 he says for where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable then gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruit without partiality without hypocrisy the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace to them that make peace amen praise god blessed are the peacemakers you know blessed are the pure in heart my this is just down to the simple gospel amen sometimes we just get back to the the simplicity of what god's done for us and how he's made it so plain it's so tangible we can be a partaker of his very holiness we're wrapping up here in proverbs 15 i thought this was marvelous proverbs 15 23 it says a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and the word spoken in due season how good is it oh my how many can testify of a word spoken in season how good is it the light of the eyes rejoice at the heart and a good report maketh the bones fat the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise he that refused instruction divide despise his own soul but he that heareth reprove geteth understanding the fear of the lord is in instruction and wisdom and before honor is humility praise god you know i remember the testimony when brother branham was preaching influence you know isaiah is isaiah yeah he was he was ordained of god to to be a prophet and he is a young person and he had a young friend that um his father passed i believe it was and and his he was going to be king and god called him to be a king and he seen that when his father was prospering in a way he seen that you know when a man would put god first and honor god's word that the blessings of god would come and and as he began to serve as king and he realized that all these blessings and things of a god called king was was blessing him and then he got to a place where he felt lifted up where he could do anything he didn't have to give account for all of his actions well he was a god called king he had an influence amen you know these attitudes can creep up you get you get so long where you forget where he pulled you out of the mire you forget what power of love it took and all of a sudden the reverence is lost oh i can do whatever i want but there's a people that are in submission to his love i i love your word lord i love you i love your people i don't want to be arrogant i want to remain humble in subjection but you know it became a testimony to isaiah when his friend he ended up getting out of his position he was he was blessed in his position as king but when he started to take the incense that was out of his calling and when he was told that he was in the wrong he had an attitude he ended up he couldn't take the correction you know and and you see that outside man sometimes can get stirred up so we want to defend things that aren't worth defending just turn them down turn them down my identity is in the love of christ amen you know that okay nature you know he's he uh he refused to he saw the humble offering of his brother but instead he out of petty jealousy he murdered him and that's what the enemy wants to do with us when we get into the wrong and he tries to snare us and we get to a place sometimes where we're unwilling to forgive but now faith perfect faith is based on forgiveness and so we've renounced our rights as believers to the one who loved us amen aren't you grateful that you have the ability to humble yourself to a love like this to serve a god that's so mindful that he's prepared he's going to prepare a place for you for where i am there you may be also praise the lord my you know i'll leave you with this last quote and we'll wrap up but i thought it was outstanding the testimony that brother branham gave about uh and it's in a couple messages but you know there was a young man that he went off uh he was going to be a doctor and so he went out and he was going to pursue his career in in india and he was going there and he left his his mother behind and while he was there he changed careers he started becoming an electrical engineer and in his practice you know he he became known and and he became very wealthy and he uh the the the the report came and i'll just read part of it here he says now the woman got poverty restriction stricken she just didn't have nothing and so uh charity was trying to come and take care of her and so they investigated the case and when they investigated they found out that the woman had one support and that was his son that was very wealthy in india and said well why don't your son support you she said oh i can't ask him i'm his mother i'd just rather take charity than ask my son don't you never hear from don't you never hear from him she said oh i hear from him once or twice a month said he writes me some of the sweetest letters that you ever read well it looked like if he loved his mother enough he had plenty of money he would have trying to take care of her instead of her trying to have charity well perhaps if he knew i was in this way he would he would care for me but said you know he doesn't know and i just feel embarrassed to tell my son like that and he still writes you sweet letters she said oh yeah the sweetest letters said he sends me the prettiest pictures you ever seen said the prettiest pictures he said so let's see some of them so she went through her bible and she began to pull out and she and you know when when it was it was what it was it was bank drafts india puts pictures on bank drafts and she had plenty see india puts pictures on bank drafts and she uh at pretty pictures she had thousands of dollars converted from in indian money into american money what was it in the ledgers of her bible she had treasures that she thought was just pictures but come on come to find out it was real value to her amen you know the enemy is just trying to paint pictures like these are just pretty pictures the devil is trying to lie and say that this is just a painted fire but how many here can say man that this is not a painted fire there's a real holy ghost there's a real promise for filler he doesn't just give the promise to leave it hanging on the shelf as a pretty picture or some childhood story book imaginary tale praise god it's become a real value to her hallelujah why don't we stand we can invite the musicians praise the lord we're working we're working out our own salvation with fear and trembling amen why do we buy our hearts together there's something in your heart that you just want to lift your hand and say god i have a need the lord's been speaking to you about a situation or circumstance or where maybe you can submit more to his love and the the fruit of righteousness can flow through you and you just want to ask god that that love that forgiveness can bring a perfect faith let's pray together heavenly father lord we appreciate your grace to stand in your presence lord to know that lord you're still working on us lord still honing out a masterpiece still chiseling off the world and the thinking of the world and our own carnal way lord you haven't left us oh god alone but you've sent a message lord jesus give us the holy ghost lord let us not look on ourselves oh god or on others any other way but the way that you see lord give us eyes to see

manifestation of that perfect son one like mark 11 who can speak the word and know that it's going to come to pass one who believes the word amen but a dylan if we could just come and dismiss us
