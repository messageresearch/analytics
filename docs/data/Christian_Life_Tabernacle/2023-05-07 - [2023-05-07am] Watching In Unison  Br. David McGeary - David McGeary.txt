Description:
Watching In Unison
Br. David McGeary
May 07, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] amen good to be gathering the house of God this morning I want to welcome everyone in the house of God all our visitors you can turn around and welcome someone is invite as invite for the team for I saw him reading this morning God bless you I bless you have your seats this morning good morning good morning welcome to the house of the Lord pray that he feel this morning that this is the best place that we all could be amen here on planet Earth you think my others lots of other places I'd rather be but in his presence is where we want to be and uh I think we'd be remiss this morning if we didn't remember the family members of the victims of the Rampage shooting that just occurred it's uh a sign of the times truly um if we allow it to it can it can offset our faith and believe in who's in control but God's got everything in control and he knows all and job said that hell is naked before him in destruction hath no covering and Solomon repeats that and he says it this way and hell in destruction or before the Lord how much more then the hearts of the Children of Men so there's a blessing to be had by following his word and stand within the protection of that mighty tower the name of the Lord amen we're going to talk very briefly and it's uh it's easy when you have a captive audience just to go on and on and on we don't want to do that this morning we want to talk about a Bible character you know there's uh there's many characters we can relate to in the Bible and uh positive connotation and negative connotation but I believe if we'll look at it in the right manner there's a positive connotation even in the negative so-called negative characters in The Bible because they were all for a purpose one of those would be naming help me remember his name um I for weeks now I've just kind of Fallen back in red and red and red and how brother Brown referred to Naaman um and Hebrews Assyrian he was a captain of the host of the Syrian Army and second Kings chapter 5 talks about him and said he was a great man with this master in his honorable because he'd LED away he'd the Lord blessed him it's hard for us to imagine this is the enemy camp but the Lord blessed him by Leading captive and given Deliverance unto Syria maybe some mighty man at Valor and there's a butt he said but he was a leper and when they were out on their campaigns they brought back a little a little maid from the camp of Israel and she was tending naaman's wife and she had a testimony even in the enemy's camp she said I would that my Lord would be in Samaria here's there's a prophet that can that can heal him of that leprosy when that message got to the king it didn't take long he sent a letter sent Messengers and a large sum of money the Bible says I will send a letter into the king of Israel and he departed two with ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and 10 changes of Raymond I looked up that silver and gold twenty thousand dollars in silver thirty three thousand dollars in gold and I would imagine the changes of Raymond probably were more beneficial and helpful than all the money you think how hard it is just to weave a garment you think 10 changes of Raymond you have to have quite a quite a tent just to hold that but here's Naaman he goes to the to the house of Elijah Elisha rather pulls up in his chariot and expects the man of God to come out and just lay his hands on him speak the word he doesn't do that he sends us his messenger he sent gehazal out with the message said go wash in the River Jordan seven times a dip and the Bible says that Naaman was Roth he was very angry this is surely come out here sometimes we expect the Lord to do what we want him to do rather than what his word says he would do so he told me go dip seven times in the Jordan River it was a dirty River and brother Bram talks about it he says I can just see him on his high horse getting down getting in the water says like a tomcat and molasses you know High stepping down there and I imagine it was painful open sores on your skin and thinking boy he says the rivers of Damascus are cleaner than these par and abana they're they're much cleaner than the Jordan why do I have to wash here brother Brown types that several times when he's in discernment talking about at least come and do what the Lord says and we know he was encouraged by his servants as they just do what he asked just do what he has to remind him say stay in the word stay in the word and he dipped seven times in his skin says was like a babies or like a child came back to him and he returned to the man of God and wanted to pay him all this money he says no I'm not going to take it I'm not going to take it it says go on your way and he realized the blessings and where to come from and he wanted to submit himself but he would still beholden to his master he said well I'll tell you this when I go in the house of Remnant the false gods is that I I hold his hand and I kneel down he said forgive me for that he knew it was the wrong kind of worship he said at least allow that transgression to bypass just have mercy on me I appreciate that and then we know the story goes on that gehaza followed after him he says Oh my he didn't charge him anything for that I'm going to take some blessings of that and ran after him and he took what he wanted or what he thought was beneficial he says oh there's two talents for me and he he said we've got other Messengers coming of course he comes back to Elisha he says wither go us thou gets I said oh I didn't go anywhere you can't get by with it own up to it just let the Lord correct you and make it right turns out the Bible says that the leprosy of Naaman now sounds strange but that was put on Naaman that was destined for Naaman there are trials struggles that we go through that are our specific the Lord can Deliver Us from them all but the lepers said Naaman came on gehaza and he was white as snow and I I believe following the scriptures that he continued to serve the prophet that he never was recovered of is leprosy there's many many lessons in that story I'd like to read you what brother Brown said about the girl's testimony and it's in the message that's Supernatural this is just an excerpt so they had a little girl there now I want to show you the force of a testimony of a child who lived in a nation or perhaps a family who was under the influence of God she loved her master and her misters so in which he'd seen Naaman probably a good-hearted good-natured man as far as we know according to history Elijah had never healed a man with Leprosy there'd never been a leper case healed in his day but the little girl being raised and brought up under the influence over in Israel yet in Alien that's us she was conducting herself as a believer and that's the way we should do all the time is conduct ourselves no matter what our position is conduct ourselves as Believers ready at all times to give an answer for the hope that lies within you you see it and I'll follow up with this and we'll get right to our psalm it's in the same message just a little farther down he said there's many people today that doesn't know Jesus Christ is still alive they don't know that he steal rules and Reigns they don't know that the blood of Calvary for the all-sufficiency that's even purchased there the cross for your transgressing aggressions and your healings they don't know that that's real today we need some more Little Maids to go around to testify of these things don't you think so get in the atmosphere of it It's Not Afraid what the world says because while they're talking about the world they're still in another atmosphere you're talking to the sinner but you're not in his atmosphere and you're in such a glorious and shrouded in then Shekinah Glory all around you and the veils of the world hid you can talk to the worldly women or the worldly men or whoever it is and still live in this that Shekinah Glory telling them of a loving God that's raised from the dead amen that's my desire this morning amen Let's uh let's stand we'll read psalms 73 kind of a mid-lengthy Psalm um I'd certainly encourage you to go back and study it completely we're just gonna read it as the old saying is let the ships fall where they may let's just read it together psalm 73. truly God is good to Israel even to such as our of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well and I slipped for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore Pride can passeth them about as a chain violence covered them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression and they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the Earth therefore his people return hither and Waters of a full cup are wrung out to them and they say how does God know in is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches verily I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands and energy for all the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morning if I say I will speak thus behold I should offend against the generation of thy children when I thought to know this it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of my of God then understood I therein surely thou did set them in Slippery places thou casted them down into destruction how are they that brought into desert as in a moment they are utterly consumed with Terrors as a dream when one awakeneth so Lord when thou wait this awakens Thou shalt despise their image thus my heart was grieved and I was pricked in my Reigns so foolish was I and ignorant I was as a beast before thee nevertheless I am continually with thee thou has hold in me by my right hand Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to Glory whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever for Lo they that are far from thee Shall Perish thou has destroyed all them that go ahoring from thee but it is good for me to draw near to God I have put my trust in the Lord God that I may declare all thy Works amen blessed be the name of all God

the other cheek how you go the extra mile how you give the cloak father you give what we have Lord that you Marvel [Music] my heart my mind that you're the kind of God that you are that you'd even be mindful of man Lord that you would even love us so much that you would give us your only begotten son that his blood could cleanse us from all unrighteousness and that he could impart to us eternal life oh Father we don't have words of praise we don't have vocabulary to exalt you to where you need to be exalted but we just asked today that you would extend your love and your mercy to us once more bless us in your word strengthen our faith in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you love the Lord this morning amen he certainly want to thank everybody for all the effort and work you've put into the building next door it's slowly coming up and we're grateful for that and we also want to thank brother Orlando for all the videos that he's taken and provide him for Us online we're very appreciative of that let us open our Bibles this morning to Nehemiah and we're just gonna just kind of go through the fourth chapter just a little bit this morning and glean from it some things that I think will help our lives and bless us this morning in the fourth uh chapter and um you just bear with me on uh the names here I don't know most of your names or know how to say most of your names so don't expect me to say these ancient names amen it says but it came to pass that when sin uh bailout heard that we built the wall he was Wrath and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spoke before his Brethren and the army of Samaria and said who do these feeble Jews what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubble which are burned amen I say yes Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated we want to just kind of go through the fourth chapter and a lot of what that were uh doing in this uh going through the scriptures is is has a two-fold purpose not only to study the word but also to encourage our hearts to read the scripture and if I could say it this way not that I'm any form of teacher at all I just believe the word of God and I believe what the prophet says about the scriptures he said if you don't see Jesus Christ in every verse go back and read it again and I also believe what he said he said put yourself in the story put yourself in the scripture so okay don't just read the scripture like it's another day read the scripture in your day in your circumstance identify with the characters realize that they're just men and women like you are with the same passions the same mental battles the same concerns and worries and all those things are the same so when you begin to approach the scriptures that way then then you can you can read them and and uh uh take something from it and receive something and the Lord can speak to your heart and so from it's that approach that if I could say that that um uh we're learning how to read our Bibles and we're gleaning from the Bible and we're going through the scripture and you know a lot of people uh it's like this message we know that we've received the prophet's message we know that this message was promised to us in the scripture so it wasn't something that William Branham sat down and read the Bible and he said oh we need a prophet I think I will be a prophet no that's not how it ever works it was he was The Vessel by which God fulfilled the scriptures that were prophesied for this day it could have been and I don't mean this in any form if God would have made you and prepared you for that office any man could have filled that office that God made and prepared for it you understand what I'm saying it wasn't an arbitrary choice that he said it was it was what was biblically promised and so a lot of times people say well you're you're built on on on the prophet and we're we're not built on the man per se but we can't separate the man from the prophecy because he was the prophecy fulfilled so if you were to ask me show me Malachi 4 5. Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 7 show me that I would have to say that's it because that's it it was made flesh the word of God's always made flesh it's always manifested and so we we learned that we just we take it back beyond the time that this scripture was put together we go all the way back to the beginning of the spoken word when God thought it and we understand that he knew the beginning from the end he has this whole thing thought out if I could use that like we know in a masterpiece but when you have a great architecture he has something in his mind and he strives towards that working to what he's painting working to what he's carving working like the great Sistine Chapel as as Michelangelo painted that great thing and and all of these men worked towards uh what they had but they had something to work with so God he when he worked with it he didn't have anything to work with if I could say that I I wish I had a better way of explaining it but so he he had to use himself so what he thought and what he created he brought it to pass and he was the author and finisher so he knew it from the end all the way to the beginning it was all thought out even to this morning what he had in mind for you and and we wanted to lay that real strong in your heart this morning that God had a has a part for you to play and I'm not complete without you playing your part and I apologize for all the times that I've let my part down because in letting my part down I let you down and we let one another down and I believe this portrait and this book of Nehemiah is a wonderful book about the church working together and everybody performing their Duty and and uh you know on the job site we have a term for people that don't do their part we call them sandbaggers or or Slackers or you know they don't carry their weight and I would notice through time that certain people they they uh they want to work with a certain person because that person carries their load you know oh we got to get this done oh let's get Kim to do it he'll get it done and and pretty soon you're packing everybody's load you know what I mean but that don't work in the kingdom of God and so when we go through the third chapter of the book of Nehemiah the the list is this group of people built this part in this group of people and and it's such a beautiful picture of everybody working together that if if had to be everybody building that their part and doing their job and everybody had to work and and it from that aspect of it each group of people and each individual took on the responsibility and by taking on the responsibility that became part of a burden that they were going to fulfill they knew what the effort that they were going to put into it so they made a commitment right from the beginning when the whole vision of building the wall was presented to them when Nehemiah came and Nehemiah had a burden on his heart and the scripture says that that that he cared for the Jews in fact they they wanted to know who's this guy that comes and is looking after the welfare of the Jews and that's kind of the theme this morning of what we're going to study uh if I if I uh had a title I would maybe call it watching in unison but it it's the care that they had and the commitment to doing uh what they said that they would do and as we read in this fourth chapter we find out that that these people they they begin to mock the Jews they begin to say oh even if they build the wall uh even if a fox walks through it'll knock it down so you know the first thing that they go through is denial you know oh it just this ain't nothing this ain't nothing but even in the scriptures when the when they talked about the high priest he said they talked to him and he commands I think it was said if it's God then with not speak against it but if it's not God it will come to not so if it's God so they had to come to a place that they believed it was God before they they could ever start out on this great project and it's good if you go back and you you nowadays I guess I'm sure that uh some of you could look there there's some photographs and things of what that wall looked like and drawings of the rubble and it was so bad that they couldn't even pass through the Rocks were so heavy and it was so beat down and the gates was burn up it looked like something that was uh insurmountable that couldn't be done impossible and I think that's what we all got to realize that what we're facing is in building this body of the Lord Jesus Christ and this body be fitting and joined together by the word of God and the restoration of the Faith of Our Fathers because that's what's promised to be restored to us our messenger came in the midst of a religious World beyond a shadow of a doubt and prove that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and that he did the same works and he made that clear and he told us that this was the age of restoration that the faith that our fathers had and the Revelation that our fathers had in other words the spirit that made our fathers what they were would be returned back to the believer in this time and to a gentile people this time that's something if I would say that's something to work towards is something to have a vision of for yourselves that each of you can look at yourself as a of as a child of faith as a early church believer the women as those that receive their their loved ones from the dead of to those that prayed and saw signs and wonders that you've got to take yourself and you've got to place yourself in that position and say I'm one of them is it okay if I take my coat off thank you thank you brother Billy and and so we find out that that in order for this project to be move forward that they had to be convinced it was God they had to believe it was the will of God and they had to say I'm going to participate in this and we talked about that a little bit before that the outsider wanted to participate and they said no you have no Heritage in this the heritage of the restoration of the Faith of Our Fathers is to the elect you say why could you say that that should be for everybody but if you're not elect you're gonna mix leaven with it um you see and they didn't want to build the wall can have all kinds of unbeliefs and all kinds of suspicions and all kinds of little uh Trinkets and little idols and little witchcraft things I remember one time in Ghana where a guy came to me and he said there's a bunch of witch doctors uh praying against you and he wanted to give me a little something could that somebody had prayed over that was going to keep those witch doctors off of me and I thought you know what if I need that I shouldn't be here but the word of God says if God sends me God will take care of me so you don't have to be afraid to be being sent amen if you're elected and chose to show this generation that the power of the Resurrection is still alive then you cannot be afraid to stand up and take that position and con and confess that you're that part of that scripture coming to pass you must recognize yourself as scripture can I say that again you are not here of your choosing you have not chosen me I have chosen you you are not here because you saw it was a good thing but you're here because God elected you to be here he chose you to be in this place at this time and he's got a reason that he's done it and you can't be ashamed you can't look at your past and say I'm disqualified he knew the beginning from the end and didn't disqualify you you can't look at the history of your mistakes you can't look at the history of your failures you can't spend your life in regret because in order to be victorious you've got to leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling and in order for that group of people to work in unity third chapter is amazing but if I can't read one of these names I would surely never make it through the third chapter but it's this group built this and this group did this don't you understand in order for them to do that they had to lay their grudges beside behind they had to lay their thoughts about one another behind they had to enter into a Unity because they knew they wouldn't be able to do it without one another and we kind of get to the place a lot of times that we don't feel we're obligated to one another we use that quote it's an individual Affair so much that it's like the prophet of God we've taken Grace and made it a disgrace the affair is individual just like in a family or in a marriage but the results are brothers and sisters that live together in unity and life and love and work out their salvation with fear and trembling and they make a family so so the Affairs individual the birth is individual the the forgiveness is individual to you as an individual God forgave you your sins he didn't forgive you of my sins and because you asked for forgiveness and he forgave you doesn't allow me to say oh I did the same thing he did no I've got to go get my own forgiveness I've got to accept my own pardon I've got to ask him for my own birth but once I've had that birth I've been borned into the body of the Living God and now I'm a part of something you just can't say well I'm not part of the body well then you won't be and there's the body that's going to be Resurrected you're not the only person going in the resurrection but you have to think if there's only one it's me but you don't pray oh Lord let it be me and forget everybody else if there's only one Let It Be Me Lord no Lord I want everyone that I love and loves me there so we begin to see that there there had to be a transformation and I think it's to our shame that we have such a great message and such a great messenger that spoke such Words of Love out to a people that didn't even see what he was know what he was or believe what he was even though they reap the benefits of his spirit to have division Among Us but that's man's nature and a kingdom cannot survive if it's divided against itself if we could all just come to the place that we had an absolute that we can leave our own interpretations and our own ideas and in our ownings and really from the sincereness of our heart ask God to reveal to us what was the messenger trying to tell me because it's not secondhand he wrote the message to you where you are you says I'm 19 yes there's a 19 year old message in there that'll touch you well I'm only there's a 12 year old message there's I don't care how low you can go Faith cometh by hearing never was a quote on the end of it if you're so old you're so old if you don't start taking it personal right and you don't start letting it work on you and you don't start letting it speak to you then you're gonna find yourself short of things that you could have possessed so there's such a uh of Fountain of blessings to the believer such a fountain of blessings so no matter where you are in your life that will guide you and and instruct you uh and and teach you for all scripture is given for instruction for reproof for living in godliness and if you don't connect with it and don't say wait a minute there's something in here for me because I'm a part of what God's doing I'm a part of the move the move that God's making or else you're just sitting back and you're seeing where things go it's like standing outside of a bus and reading the sign where it's going and then when it leaves you're not on it work out your own salvations with fear and trembling it doesn't say it said work it out you gotta work your way through being 12. you've got to work your way through being 15 and 16. you've got to work your way through your parents not knowing everything you've got to work your way through you feel like oh they just got control of me I don't have no Freedom you've got to work your way through your siblings but you gotta you gotta have a goal so as we looked and read these scriptures we're going to find out that there were certain characteristics that every wall Builder and gate Builder had to have and those characteristics I found so beautifully spoken by our messenger he said one of the first things they had to be is they had to be persistent okay and I want to read a few statements that before we go through uh these scriptures if I could I want to talk a little bit about the characteristic of perseverance and and it's uh it's a marvelous characteristic and and there's a thing that motivates perseverance how many you understand what perseverance means that means to stick with something just stay after it to go after it not to let nothing Knock You Down so we find out in this thing when these guys begin to speak all these words against them all who do they think they are these feeble Jews this little group of people and they're going to build the wall they're going to stand against the king mocking them and everything I love the response of Nehemiah and that's the fourth verse he says Hear o our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head we've got to stop giving the devil a pass we got to start identifying me as the devil we've got to start telling me he don't belong he's not going to squat this is our city this are our walls these are our gates and get behind me he said upon their own head and give them for pray into the land of captivity in other words they want to put us under their hand Lord let them all come and Capt them may they become prey you know we give way too much place to things that aren't God and as I read some of these statements I hope that you will see that what and I I uh if you know like they accuse Paul in the second Corinthians the 10th chapter of writing real strong letters but yet being weak and comparing them and and trying to tear down and Paul just trying to say hey I'm just telling you the word you know what I mean because the words the only thing that's going to benefit you and he says they're fools because they compare themselves one to another and and and and and they have a whole different way of measuring we only measure everything by God's word so this is what the prophet of God said in the one of the messages perseverance this happens to be the one that he preached in 1963 uh 0-1 13 in the evening in paragraph 34 he speaks this he says the word perseverance means to be I think according to Webster persistent in other words not hit and miss not try one day I had a a lot of fun yesterday with the brothers uh Brother Joseph told me he wanted to be a landscaper did you want to be a landscaper so I gave him a post hole digger I said dig this hole 24 inches and give this whole dig this hole 36 inches and he was out there and he just sweating away and working at it and and everything and when he finally got all done with everything he looked at me and he says I don't think I want to be a landscaper oh he says I think I'm going to look for an office job I thought okay I get it that's why I had you dig the post and not me and I appreciated him digging it you did a wonderful job but he learned something you're going to be a landscaper there's a lot of digging there's a lot of it takes a lot of persistence to see it all the way through you've got to have such a love for it and it just can't be an idea it's got to be a passion and to be a Christian you have to have a passion for Christ you have to have a passion for what the word stands for you have to have a passion for the lifestyle a passion for the spirit of passion for the blessings that come with it you can't be sharing that passion it's got to be a love affair where you're on fire I love it I want it I want to pursue it I'm going to stick with it till I get every benefit from it it can't be oh it seemed like a good idea for a while an old Ben coming up to me he says it looks to me like you're making careers I said none of them are Labor careers and none of them are in construction I can tell you that you've got to be persistent I don't know if you found that let us read on he says I think according to Webster it means to be persevering perseverant in making a goal and every person on Earth or that ever been on Earth that ever achieved anything or amounted to anything had to be perseverant so I want you to think these people had to take on the commitment that I'm going to see this thing through to the end and when the enemy came up and begin to mock them they were so persistent in what their goal was and what they wanted to achieve they called on God to fight their enemy and they go on to say and cover not their iniquity what is Iniquity unbelief cover not the iniquity that they don't believe this is God that they don't believe what we're doing we're told to do don't let that just go away don't let them remind them keep them in mind you stood against it you spoke against it you reviled it and let me tell you something there's going to be a lot of people that reviled this message reviled the people in it for their own movement and their iniquity will not be hid as one brother told me he said I'm still waiting for their apology I say Amen people just change courses I had a man come to me in bald face lie to me and then get out and put out a big thing and try to cover it up Lord let not his iniquity sorry I had to get that off my heart he said Terry Our God for We Are advised and from turn their reproach upon their own head I like that right and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders Hallelujah that's part of persistence you can't let every critic you can't let everybody that got an opinion you can't let everybody push you away from your passion God put something on your heart it's not majority rules you and God make a majority if you feel led to do something you stick with it you pray about it you know of God before you who can be against you but I'm telling you if we're going to turn in to this manifested bride that we're prophesied to be with a spirit of love being shed abroad in our heart not the spirit of power the spirit of love because if you've got love power will follow we're trying to get the power before the love and we're going to have a mess on our hands we're going to have a lot of confused young people we're going to have a lot of disappointed people gets a passion for Christ first power without character is satanic you don't put a gun in the hand of a minor and may I say this I don't care if I come under Crypt because I know where I stand you can't put all figure putting all the power of the spirit of God and the wisdom of the Gospel in the hands of a bunch of teenagers and think it's going to come up let them grow into it lead of the spirit growed in the word it's easy to get excited but when you have a demon in front of you you got to know there's something inside of you that he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world you better have something that's real not something that's been felt but something that's been born in you we gotta quit being babies we heard a message beautiful about letting off the pressure so perfect for our day he said where do we run when the pressure gets on we run to Christ we run to him let's read as we read this is I hope it trusts it blesses you this is our messenger speaking to us this is God speaking to us through a prophet he knew he wouldn't be here for the Divine wisdom and by divine revelation he stored it up in a storehouse that the bride can go to it and be able to retrieve it in season and have it ministered to her the life that it needed for the hour that they're in that's God that scripture that's life to be perseverant you've got to be sure first what you've got your faith Anchored In now Faith is just not a thing that so easily floated around and some kind of as we call it in Street expression Hocus Pocus faith can only have its right position when it's placed upon something that's steadfast not something that just floating around it's got to be something that's real something that's steadfast I wonder how many of them Builders looked at all that bunch of rocks and said one there was a time that a great City sat here with a great king and I'm part of that it's a land of my fathers my fathers used to live how can I be happy when the house of my father lays in ruin how can we be happy when the Church of the Living God is laying in ruin yeah we'd be happy with a half experience with a half cup of water when he promised to us so many blessings I love singing about it but I want to get to the place Lord I don't want to just sing about it I don't want to have the song feel me good I want it to become a living fountain on the inside of me I want it to be life and life abundant and I'm going to be persistent and I have a lot of unbelief to overcome I have a lot of my nature to overcome I have a lot of my personality over to come I have a lot of shortcomings but let me tell you something nothing is impossible for our God I'm not impossible for God if you don't have a passion for it if you got a taste for the world and the things of the world the scripture says the love of God isn't even in you Lord help me he says this the 37th his faith cometh by hearing and hearing what the word of God therefore if this be the word of God now he's talking about perseverance here he's going to explain to you and to me what motivates perseverance because if it's if it's not steadfast and it's not true and you don't feel that it's accomplishable you'll give up on it you'll give up the pressure will make you give up the trial will make you give up what people think will make you give up your past will make you give up nobody that ever gave up ever persevered you've got to persevere I'll try to give probably got a little bit of time this morning but I think it's he says therefore if it if this be the word of God and it is what it teaches we can rest upon it God cannot change God must forever remain God his word must be just as true in this age as it ever was in any age we are finite we can say something this year and maybe even tomorrow have to alter it because we're not too sure because we're finite we just presume and presume means to venture without Authority boy I got that disease bad there's only one cure for it the word of God listen as God speaks to us but when God says something it's perfect don't eat altering don't need changing e means exactly what he says he means right it's perfect he don't have to alter it Abraham staggered nodded the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God because he knows that he was able to perform or to keep or to do that what he had promised then if God is ever called on the scene for a decision and the decision that God makes first it has to Forever remain the same if he forgave the woman at the well he'll have to forgive every woman at the well if he forgave the woman caught in adultery he'd have to forgive every woman caught in adultery if he cast out the devil he'd have to cast out every devil as long as you come to him on the same grounds and the same decision and you identify yourself Lord I'm like that man and he came to you and you forgive him therefore I can have confidence that you'll forgive me therefore I'm going to be persistent till I get the blessing that's mine we're not going to go anywhere without it this is what motivates it he said if God ever called LeBron to make a decision that promise that God makes first it has to Forever remain the same it can never change it cannot be altered because he's infinite in anything that's infinite never had a beginning or an end so he can't take it back next year or say it was wrong and then if that was his decision then every man that makes the same comes to the same decision that God made for one man upon the basis of his faith to believe it he's got to meet that same thing every time a man believes it oh God let that sink in you're really not as special as you think you are you want scripture for that God is no respecter a person a prophet what life he's trying to restore back this people this city this Jerusalem he's got to meet the same thing every time a man believes it God has got to act every time the way he acted the first time he acted wrong the first time who can accuse God of acting wrong God has got to every remain with his decision if thou canest believe now to achieve anything you've got to set a goal and say this I believe you know Satan's knocked me down a lot he's knocked me down mentally he's knocked me down physically he's knocked me down emotionally he's I've wanted to quit over and over and over again but there's one thing I believe this message so I might not understand it I might not have a a hundredth of what's in it but I know by divine revelation that God's Prophet for this age was William Miriam Branham he was a Vindicated word of God he was scripturally Vindicated it was the word of God made manifest through our day and I believe it I cannot help that am I discouraged what I see in the mirror yes but when I hear what he just said then I know like every lost man if I could go meet him on that ground he'll transform me into what that he has in mind for me you've got to set it goal this I believe and tie yourself to it too many anchors in too many things and keep drawing move up closer to it how many of us are standing off we're not moving into that perfect man we're not trying to move into that Faith we're not trying to accept the public responsibility and the power that God wants to transmit to us don't overcome our whole life is standoffish we don't want to go into the prayer closet you know I I get afraid to go in my prayer closet because I'm afraid God will tell me something I don't want to hear oh you like getting my prayer on God said Brother David I'd like you to go down in the you know pick some country nobody's from huh wait a minute Lord I got a good thing going here no when your heart's desire Lord whatever it is be it unto me according to thy will when you're not standoffish anymore you're willing to take it I'm willing to go through with this I'm going to be persistent in it Lord if that's what your hearts desire for me but you can't be standoffish you got to tie yourself to it you got to pull draw to it what's in there for me got to become your life blood you're pressing your your you're reaching in you're getting more that's what those guys had when they went to Build That Wall they were gonna build it regardless God stop our enemies keep going keep moving up closer to it knowing that you it's there knowing that there is something there that you're coming two oh can I be honest with you this morning how many of you know where you're going what are you coming to as a Christian what's the image of the man you're walking into your personality your characteristics your traits overcoming your weakness I don't like who I am but praise God he can change me if I draw to this message if I know there's something in there for for me if I know I'm coming to something I'm coming to a gentler man I'm coming to more of a wise man I'm coming to a Kinder man I'm coming to a man that cares more I want to come to the place that I can identify with the sick that I can take their burden no I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but by his grace I'm not what I used to be [Music] and I'm moving up are you moving up this morning are you going deeper into the message are you going to become what we're promised to become is it your promise are you persistent to it do you know what the messenger said he said that you are the last sign that the world would get is Christ in you the hope of glory and Christ in you is the hope of other men you got to know it's there I like this little thing he says like it it was said the little boy with the kite holding the string in his hands and he said the man said what are you holding son he said my kite he said I don't see nothing but string he said but there's a kite on the end of it the man looked up and said I don't see the kite the little boy said neither do I he said well how do you know you've got a kite he said I can feel it tugging at the end Hallelujah I feel something tugging me to be a perfect Christian to be a perfect man to meet Satan at every ground every incident to stand up I gotta be persistent that's a characteristic that they had and that summed up in the sixth verse so built we the wall and all the wall joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work they were persistent half the walls built now it's finally all hooked together and then I'll skip over these next few verses but what so what happened is they all conspired they were Roth and they all got together and they conspired to go against them and all can atheros and and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it right well this is not going to go without a battle Prophet warned us he said they'll come in amongst you and they'll try to sold Discord he said don't you believe it you pull your string up closer you draw closer one to another you love one another you don't let them criticize you don't let them right you don't let them try to divide us I'll say it again we are not a religion we are a people we are the elect Sons and Daughters of God from every nation every tongue that's how he said it would be and it's sitting right in front of you manifested in flesh exactly what was prophesied Hallelujah [Applause] from every kindred all over the place and we want to let junk come into our midst black lives matters you know could this that and all this other stuff hey man we're not of any of the races of the world we're the race of the Living God the seed of God is planted in US and we can't make it without one another there's no big eyes there's no little use don't let that poison I know that poison got a bunch a bunch of our young people you know I'm more than willing to give up my spot to anybody who wants it you want it make your application I'm happy if you can square it with him I'm good I'm out of here because this is getting tougher than you can imagine the spirits the nonsense that's coming from the other side all the foam that's pouring into the cracks we got to start washing our minds with the water of God's word we're going to start keeping that stuff out let's just real fact it's right here in our scriptures ninth verse nevertheless we made our prayers unto our God and set a watch against them day and night because of them now you know what comes next you've got to if you're persevering and you believe it then you become concerned if you're convinced you're concerned if you're convinced that there's an enemy trying to devour your children trying to devour your friends trying to devour this life this Christianity they're trying to devour this message trying to make it illegal for us to preach against homosexuality and act and making us accept transgender things not going to do it it's Antichrist it's anti-word it's not scriptural and God will fight our battle if God be for you who can be against you why try to be politically correct when how much have they changed politics in five years or four years or two years don't build yourself on something that don't last he said never left our prayers under our God and we set watch against them day and night because of them and Judah said the strength of the Bears of burden is decayed and there is much Rubble so that we are not able to build the wall and our advisor said they shall not know neither in our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work disease when I read that I thought in my Heart Lord how much Rubble do I have in my life how much Rubble is there that's keeping me from seeing the enemy how much tell me this he said I can't work got so much Rubble so much junk so many burdens and things of the world that I'm totally absorbed with that I can't even work for the kingdom of God I can't have faith I can't have an atmosphere I can't have any Joy because I'm stuck in a pile of rubble in the adversary can sneak in and stop the work I like what they said they they're gonna do I just want you to catch this whole beautiful thing that that they're they're saying and he said so they set up a watch they begin to look out after one another they begin to become concerned about one another they were convinced and concerned they cared about one another it was their City when people ask you you don't go to my church don't tell people you go to David McGarry's Church please don't tell them you come to you go to Christian Life Tabernacle if they say who's the pastor you say I'm trusting it's the Holy Ghost because I sure hope that guy there gets out of the way all the glory to our Lord [Applause] are we convinced it's God hmm I mean you are you convinced there's there's a God working here with you is it just another church you know are we a denomination we go hither we can go whatever as long as they're preaching the message great I'll give you a letter I know good that dude but some people want them our adversary said we shall not know so there's too much junk and the junk was hindering them to besee the enemy now that's what I said watching in unison as we read this next portion of scripture these people all of a sudden realize there's Spirits out there that are trying to bring the work of this message which is to have a bride with the love of God shed a bride in their heart being capped with the Capstone and there's people that are pursuing that the love of God shed abroad in their heart by the holy spirit so they had to do certain things and we're going to have to do certain things we are going to have to start looking out after one another being in prayer one for another being concerned about one another it's not a one-man job that's the curse of nickelodeonism the pastor's supposed to pray for the sick I can't pray for all the sick sometimes I'm sick myself you've got to pray for the sick you've got to look after one another look older sisters are to teach the younger sisters you're an uplift one another in prayer you've got to get fitted and joined together you can't sit apart you've got to join the watch you've got to join the watch you've got to join the fight you can't always have a back door you can't always have an Escape Plan you've got to be convinced you've got to be committed you've got to know where you stand and they go on they said he said he says and then it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came they send and said unto us ten times from all places when she shall return unto us they will be upon you know there's anything they're going to get you they're everywhere there's no safe route so these guys say okay we got to get involved we've got to do something we got to protect ourselves we try to have a prayer meeting this Tuesday is going to be a prayer meeting all might take a little sacrifice to come pray for somebody we've got Soul soft it's pathetic excuse that word I'm not saying you're soft I'm saying we need to get stronger is that better no I don't want you to be under conviction but I want you to be encouraged so it came to pass can't I there will be upon you therefore I set I in the lower place behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows our weapons of warfare are not carnal but they're spiritual and mighty and pulling down of the strongholds I believe that's the second Corinthians 10 and four I believe you want to you can throw it up there if you like if you find that for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen we got a spiritual weapon and then he goes let's read on it's beautiful he says from all places when she shall return and therefore I sit in the lower Tower of pace behind the wall and on the higher places I set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not afraid of them amen remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your house Hallelujah not just for yourself fight for your brethren fight for your loved ones to fight fight for your sons fight for your daughters fight for your wives fight for your house watching in unison watching after one another keep fighting for one another what's our ours is a spiritual warfare pulling down the strongholds when we see the enemy creeping in with a flood you go to your brother you talk to your brother you got you can't just sit back and say oh well that's not my business whose testimony was that I'm Not My Brother's Keeper we are our Brother's Keeper we're the keepers of the faith the scripture tells us when one be caught in a fall ye that are strong go to that person and lift them up pray for them get involved with them don't keep brushing everything off you might be the only eyes on it you might be the only one that noticed somebody slipping away you might be the only one that that sees a thought of gossip running through the house of the Living God you've got to stand there and say wait a minute I'm not going to let this hurt my family I'm not going to let this hide in the rubble I'm not going to do it I'm I'm in a fight for my brethren I'm gonna fight for my family I'm gonna fight I'm going to be a watch they set up and they took watch they were watching in unison for any place the enemy was going to come in and try to stop them from the work you say what's our work our work has a body and as individuals is to come into the image of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and to be filled with his spirit they had to fight and he said Remember the Lord and it came to pass when our enemies heard it was known unto us and God hath brought their counsel to not that we returned all of us to the wall everyone unto his work you know sometimes we only get riled up when there's a trial but he said they they stayed that off and they returned to the work Now watch how they continue and it came to pass from that time forth that half of my servants wrath in the work and the other half held both the spear and the shield and the bow and their and the harvickson's and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah and they which built on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that Laden everyone with one of his hands wrath in the work and with the other Hands Held a weapon Oh what a beautiful picture they're all working why they're perseverant they're going to build this wall they're going to build this by they're working in unison and now they realize in order for us to succeed we've got to watch out after one another we've got to put on the full armor of God foreign we've got to take the sword of the word we've got to look out and make sure the enemy isn't coming into our midst and they said for every Builder everyone had a sword amen what's his sword Hallelujah he had a sword and he had Works show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my work belief doesn't Stand Alone the word if you're going to be in the work you've got your word and you got your work and everybody's got their work and that becomes the strength of the body theology is not the strength of the body Doctrine is not the strength of the body because that can become dead but the Life of Christ working through you in good works is the strength of the body When you pray for somebody whether they know it or not and they get well then you know God's with you for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and soaked built and and he that sounded the trumpet was by me and I said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another remember the walls two and a half miles long so they can't see they're watching for one another they're girded up they're ready for all that they can do and he said he said into what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet Resort ye hither unto us our God shall fight for us how many beliefs we got a trumpet amen what happens when the enemy comes in like a flood we go we we come to the trumpet sound and We Gather in the word of God we gather around the promises of God we so we put on the full armor of God and we take the sword of God's word and we repel the attack of the enemy why because we're a people we love one another we love this message I love you that you love this message I love you that God loves you I love you for the stand you've taken I know it's hard you know our women don't wear pants we don't wear pants at work there's no work situation there's no circumstance women don't wear pants I didn't make that up and sometimes there's a lot of reproach and that's part of being an odd people that's part of being elected that's part of the burden that goes with the Revelation God's given you you will be despised of the world and Satan desires to Sifty a sand but he said I've prayed for you bear the reproach it will be worth it all and you'll find out someday somebody will come and inquire of you why do you let your hair grow why don't you wear pants why do you do the things you can do and then you can stand up and share with him the Glorious life that you have in your heart that makes it worth all while I want to finish this up read a few quotes and we'll be gone this morning I hope the word it is with you and so we see here that we can't be separated one for another we have to have a place that we can all come together that God shall fight for us that's why this scripture says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together forsake not Fellowship forsake not prayer for we labor so we labored in the work half of them held the Spears from the rising of the morning tell the Stars appeared and likewise the same time I said unto the people let everyone with his servant Lodge in Jerusalem amen let's stay in the spirit let's Lodge in the spirit Lord forgive me for every time I've went outside I'm sorry that I do it but let me come Lodge in the city let me stay in the presence where I can watch and look after one another that in the night they may be a guard to us and labor on the day watching and guarding Unity together watching and guarding so neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the Guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saved that everyone put them off for washing they stayed ready they stayed pervert they were convinced I'll just read a few statements here this is out of convinced and concerned in 1962-118. he says now that's the only way that I see for there to come a concern in the church and back among the people is to stay long enough until you're convinced that the program is right foreign and not some mental illusion or emotion or psychology or some workup it's absolutely the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God promised to pour out in the last days that's the reason the seminaries are dropping off they've seen that all that they get somehow or another it's always promised something that you never get to I want to get it everybody agree with me on that I don't want to promise as promises promises that we never get to he says there's a reason for that it's a lack of being convinced he says something they promise and they just keep promising and promising and promising and you never get it but the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call Peter said in the day of Pentecost it just isn't for a group away back in some other age it's today how far as many as the Lord Our God shall call the signs was to follow the believer so that they would know who they were giving a Vindication of them that they were all praise God I would ask for that I would pursue that I would be convinced that that word is true but I can solve that question in my heart now Andrew became very very concerned because he stayed with them all night and was convinced and then when he became convinced that he was the Christ then he was concerned about somebody else what happened they were convinced the wall was of God they knew that God wanted to do it they were persevering and doing it they were so convinced and then what do you see now they were concerned about one another they stood watch over one another if one would couldn't pay their rent they would go around and muster up everything they would take care of one another they make sure people had food they make sure that it was good charity begins first at the house of God he said he was concerned about and I believe that every man every woman every boy or girl that ever stays long enough that they're convinced that it's right and it's the Holy Ghost you are burdened so hard in your heart that you can't stand still and let these people die like this is a shame die like this in shame and sin it'll grind the very heart out of you to get out here on these streets it does any Christian to see the people wholly given over to sin drinking gambling cursing swearing smoking every car you pull up behind it's a woman with a cigarette in her finger and with one of these water head haircuts they're using now and all this common nonsense and thousands professing to be Christians convinced and concerned and you was concerned for about his brother as soon as he was absolutely convinced that the Messiah how did he do it he stayed with him all night but the thing then is that loses concerned and after a while you've lost the hole you've lost everything if you're not concerned about anything but just your own self that was paragraph 122. do you see what he's saying this message slips away from people why they just quit being concerned about one another concerned about lost souls concern being involved concerning that there's more life don't let the world gobble you up don't let your job gobble you up don't let the I thought brother Tim did such a beautiful job this morning saying don't let all the negativity out there take an effect on you you know you're a part of what's right it's paragraph 235 that's it brother we're concerned about our brother when we're convinced that it's God and if the Pentecostal people are convinced it's God then they'd be concerned about our Brethren that's right and we act like that we're not fully convinced and sometimes when we pray for the sick and the sick just keeps going on we say well I don't know pray for me again on back and forth we act like we're not thoroughly convinced that God keeps his promise God keeps his promise brother certainly he does if it isn't God if it isn't God's promise then he don't have to keep it but if he if it's his promise he must keep it in order to be God ain't nothing wrong with God it's with you and I amen amen I like to read this last statement to you this is paragraph 258. convinced then concerned so I believe that all the Protestants believe and the great Evangelistic move that really born of the spirit of God or God any God uh about them they know the Holy Spirit comes but they don't say that he when he comes that he changes his nature see they seem to be they think well he just intolerance the world he's just in tolerates the world and the people grow on living the same way as always you know just go to church and try to be Good Fellows and do the best they can that's not it friend and I like what he said the the new birth isn't just an intolerance to the world and sometimes the new birth is preached to our young people that if you're doing this and if you're doing that if if you're doing this if you're doing that you need the Holy Ghost in other words it's intolerance to sin that's what the Holy Spirit does you become intolerant to the world intolerant to sin but I want you to know that the prophet said it's more than that it's more than that if you love him you don't love the things of the world now they still may work on you like he said there's some that hate it when they do wrong and there's others that don't care but he makes this so it's not an intolerance we're not preaching oh if you had the Holy Ghost you wouldn't play video games no if your Nature's changed yeah there's not the there's not the need for it but if you're in this generation with everything that's going on out there with everything that's pressing if we don't get rid of the rubble we can't see our enemy if we're not watching one for another we can't see them and if you don't have a change in nature this becomes hiding places we hide in the rubble like the enemy is going to do we think that we're not exposed I don't care about being exposed to one another I don't I want him to see me didn't you see the queen yeah I saw the queen but she didn't see me I want him to see me and so much of the need for sports and for music and for games in those things and I'm not against those things young people are young got a lot of vigor I used to play football with the brothers I used to be able to throw the ball 55 yards of course I can hardly lift my arm knob now because of it yeah I'm not that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about when it becomes a need to hide a need to occupy time because you're not drawn to it you're not becoming what you're not convinced there's something there for you and you're not concerned and when you're not concerned you'll find yourself with a lot of idle time and I grew up hearing this statement the idle mind is the Devil's Playground about the work but this is what he says when the Holy Ghost comes into you he makes you a new creature yes sir he makes you a new creature and he puts himself within you and you are his Idol amen wow can you imagine that he puts himself in you and then he loves you because you're he's in you his sons in you you're what he lifts up you're what he takes care of it's like God worshiping the god in you it's it's yeah oh Hallelujah There's Hope There's Hope for me because God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son who would ever believe on him he give them power to become the Sons and Daughters of God Glory it's our promise don't let no brown-eyed blue-eyed green-eyed little long last boy bad as little eyes at you sisters and take anything from you amen you leave your life behind if it's marked or scarred that's not important to God because he's thrown it in the sea of God forgetfulness you start living and let him live in you and when the Holy Ghost comes unto you he makes you a new creature yes sir he makes you a new creature and he puts himself within you and you are his Idol you he's living inside of you working moving his own way in you Hallelujah you want to build a Christian Life be convinced be concerned be perseverant stay in the city watch after one another in unison and the blessings will thrill your soul there's nothing let this mind be in you which is in Christ Jesus God bless you this morning sorry I kept you so long man let's all stand this morning hey man is that your desire this morning let it
