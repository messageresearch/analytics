[35:55] you were the word in the beginning
[35:57] amen
[36:03] [Music]
[36:20] creation
[36:23] now revealing
[36:29] what a beautiful name it is
[36:37] the name of jesus
[36:41] christ
[36:45] what a beautiful name it is
[36:49] nothing compares to this
[36:52] what
[36:55] [Music]
[36:58] jesus
[37:03] you didn't walk without
[37:07] [Music]

[37:50] [Music]
[38:03] oh lord what a
[38:05] lovely name
[38:06] [Music]
[38:07] because that name represents a person
[38:11] [Music]
[38:13] lord we could talk about george
[38:15] washington
[38:18] all what he did and
[38:20] what he accomplished and go look at his
[38:23] monument
[38:24] [Music]
[38:27] but we never knew george washington
[38:32] we could talk about abraham lincoln
[38:34] [Music]
[38:37] and we could go read the
[38:39] proclamation
[38:43] the gettysburg address
[38:45] see the great statue and memorial lord
[38:48] i've stood there
[38:49] [Music]
[38:50] but i never knew
[38:53] abraham lincoln
[38:54] [Music]
[38:56] but father i can look at the cross
[39:00] [Music]
[39:02] and i
[39:04] can
[39:05] read of what was accomplished there the
[39:07] greatest accomplishment in the world
[39:12] but lord we can say we know you
[39:18] what a great
[39:19] privilege
[39:21] to say that we know the person behind
[39:24] the name
[39:26] we know who he is
[39:29] and what he's done
[39:32] father we ask you to bless us this
[39:34] evening
[39:35] in your word
[39:37] in jesus
[39:38] precious and
[39:40] wonderful name we pray
[39:43] amen
[39:45] amen if you have your bibles in return
[39:47] with me
[39:49] forgive me tonight you i'm a little not
[39:51] well but
[39:54] it's been so long since i've
[39:58] ministered here that someone asked me if
[40:01] i'd retired
[40:03] and i do i get retired every day
[40:07] but we've got a wonderful gospel and
[40:10] if you don't mind me just reading
[40:12] statements and
[40:14] and
[40:16] just going through the word of god
[40:18] with you
[40:20] i'm certainly not an evangelist and
[40:23] or a teacher
[40:24] but i i just love god's word and
[40:28] and
[40:29] we've been
[40:31] taking a journey
[40:33] through the
[40:34] sermons
[40:36] um uh
[40:38] wherever we started at and we've come
[40:41] upon this sermon and this sermon came
[40:44] upon my heart
[40:45] and i was reading uh out of it
[40:48] and then come to find out that it is the
[40:51] next sermon
[40:53] in line so
[40:54] we're going to study here for a little
[40:57] while
[40:58] and we're not going to really study the
[41:00] book
[41:01] or try to repreach brother banham's
[41:04] sermon but we're going to go through it
[41:08] and glean out
[41:10] if i could use that word not that we're
[41:12] capable
[41:14] but see and spend some time in the
[41:16] mighty riches
[41:18] that are hidden in the scripture how
[41:20] many of you my brother spoke of having a
[41:22] bible i like having a bible
[41:25] and you know you start marking it out
[41:28] and then you start using blue and then
[41:30] you start using red and yellow and
[41:33] pretty soon your pages are falling out
[41:36] and you read it and it's like you've
[41:38] never read it before
[41:40] and i feel that way with the word of god
[41:43] you grow up
[41:45] a little bit you know
[41:47] and i like taste of things now that i
[41:50] hated
[41:51] when i was a child
[41:53] but i loved to grow this scripture
[41:58] had a tremendous effect on me and i'd
[42:02] like to share it with you this evening
[42:05] and it's found in 2 thessalonians
[42:09] the 3rd chapter
[42:11] and the 5th verse
[42:13] and
[42:16] and so i won't be able to preach but i
[42:18] i'd just like to testify
[42:21] i was going to try to get brother bill
[42:25] uh zlad off to come and
[42:27] testify but then i got to thinking he'd
[42:29] tell so many stories about me
[42:32] that he might ruin my ministries
[42:36] but anyway it's again it's so nice to
[42:38] have brother
[42:40] wade and sister heidi and bill and marcy
[42:42] with us and i see my other friend there
[42:45] it's so good to see them and so lord
[42:48] bless you
[42:51] i'd like to just read this scripture and
[42:54] then fellowship with you on it
[42:57] and the lord
[42:58] direct
[43:01] your heart
[43:04] into
[43:06] the love of god
[43:10] and
[43:10] into the patient waiting
[43:14] for christ
[43:18] father we ask you to bless your word
[43:21] in jesus precious name we pray
[43:24] amen you may be seated
[43:31] i read this scripture
[43:35] and it
[43:37] touched my heart
[43:39] and then i went to a different bible
[43:42] and
[43:44] and they
[43:46] i think they call it the new king james
[43:49] and the
[43:50] new american standard
[43:52] and they took this scripture
[43:55] and they changed it
[43:58] in a way that i thought that they missed
[44:02] really what was being spoken
[44:05] and i realized that they missed it
[44:08] because
[44:09] they it they don't have the key
[44:12] that we have
[44:14] to understand the scriptures
[44:16] that came to us through the word of god
[44:20] of our generation and they reworded it
[44:23] in a way that it said this
[44:26] and the lord direct your hearts into the
[44:29] love of god or god's love
[44:32] and into the patience of christ
[44:37] and they put the emphasis
[44:39] on the patience
[44:42] and not
[44:43] the waiting
[44:46] and so he said that
[44:49] and so he says may the lord direct your
[44:51] heart
[44:52] so this is something that
[44:56] uh paul is telling us
[44:58] that we need to be led to
[45:03] okay it is a not an attribute
[45:08] but it's a place
[45:10] or a position
[45:13] it's a it's something that
[45:16] that we've got to have so he's not
[45:18] talking about having patience
[45:22] he's talking about something completely
[45:25] different
[45:27] and as we begin to read
[45:30] this place
[45:32] i'd like this to start and maybe you
[45:35] could pull this up
[45:36] along and we could read it together
[45:39] um i i feel it's very important
[45:43] to when you talk about the word of god
[45:46] to be established in the word of god
[45:49] because the word of god is not letter
[45:54] the word of god is the present tense
[45:59] voice of jesus christ speaking to you to
[46:03] where you are at at the moment
[46:07] so you can never look at the word of god
[46:10] as letter
[46:11] because the letter killeth but when you
[46:14] look at it as spirit
[46:17] then it brings life
[46:19] and so now you have something that you
[46:23] can read
[46:24] and it it's not
[46:27] trying to set forth an order of doctrine
[46:30] or to set forth some sort of moral code
[46:36] but it's something that now
[46:38] it can speak to you move you
[46:41] and direct you
[46:43] so the word of god doesn't become a
[46:47] study
[46:48] it becomes a living leadership
[46:51] and that's why through the ages it could
[46:55] lead you through the ages
[46:57] and it doesn't matter you can get away
[47:00] from the word of god you can change your
[47:03] lifestyle situations can change you can
[47:06] get into all these different places but
[47:09] the minute that you come back into
[47:12] contact with the word of god it's going
[47:15] to start directing you to the love of
[47:19] god
[47:24] because it's living
[47:26] and that's what he is he's a shepherd
[47:29] so he's going out to find you and if you
[47:32] get away what does he do he leaves the
[47:34] 99
[47:36] he comes back and he finds you
[47:40] and now he's going to start directing
[47:42] you so you've got to understand even
[47:45] when we come to church to fellowship
[47:48] we're not coming to study we're coming
[47:50] to be directed we're coming to have the
[47:53] holy spirit leadership in our life guide
[47:57] us into all truth and righteousness i
[48:01] will not leave you comfortless but i
[48:03] will come again and i'll be with you and
[48:06] i'll lead you and guide you and direct
[48:10] you into all truth and righteousness now
[48:14] he's saying may god direct you
[48:16] and lead you
[48:18] into the love of god why is that
[48:21] important to us because we know that's
[48:24] the final part of the church of the
[48:27] living god is the capstone of love
[48:34] i got to cut my inspiration because i'm
[48:37] going to fall over
[48:40] so
[48:40] he wants to direct us someplace
[48:43] so god is trying to direct his church
[48:48] to a place
[48:53] so all the attributes that we have
[48:58] the spirit the fruits of the spirit
[49:01] of
[49:02] of joy peace patience love all the
[49:05] attributes
[49:07] all the fruits of the spirit we're not
[49:09] talking about those we're talking about
[49:12] having those
[49:14] and then taking those to a place
[49:19] or a position
[49:22] so you i'm trying to make a distinction
[49:24] because he's not talking about having
[49:28] patience
[49:29] he's talking about leading us
[49:32] to
[49:33] the
[49:34] to into
[49:38] the patient waiting
[49:41] so the patient waiting is a place
[49:46] it's a position
[49:49] it's some place we have to go so let's
[49:51] just look at it here as
[49:54] the title of my
[49:56] sermon
[49:57] to
[49:58] deceiving
[49:59] is called
[50:01] the condemnation test
[50:06] the test of condemnation
[50:08] not a negative thing
[50:10] but the positive things that god
[50:13] has given
[50:15] uh given to us
[50:18] uh
[50:19] so
[50:20] uh as as we
[50:23] uh look at this
[50:25] this evening
[50:27] if we could turn
[50:29] we we will see that
[50:32] we want to turn to this
[50:34] place this message here it's called
[50:37] god's provided
[50:39] place
[50:41] of worship
[50:42] so i want you to look at that as it's a
[50:46] place just like this is a place
[50:48] or spring creek is a place
[50:52] it's a place that you can go and dwell
[50:56] it's actually an existence
[51:01] okay and now there's things that we can
[51:04] that we can determine
[51:07] whether we're in that existence or not
[51:11] whether we're there
[51:14] and i want to make sure i'm there
[51:17] i don't want a religious uh deception
[51:21] i i don't want
[51:23] the foolishness of man i don't want to
[51:26] join a church i don't want to join a
[51:28] cult i don't want to join a denomination
[51:32] but i want to know that i'm sitting at
[51:34] the table and supping with him because
[51:37] he said in this day behold i stand at
[51:40] the door and knock and any man that
[51:42] opens up i will come in and i will sup
[51:45] with him that is a place
[51:52] it's a position
[51:54] it's something that's not real that's
[51:56] real
[51:58] so let us
[51:59] read this if you could find this it's
[52:01] paragraph
[52:03] 27
[52:06] and he's talking here
[52:08] when he reads this message
[52:11] he's reading out of deuteronomy where he
[52:14] talks about
[52:15] that the place that i put my name
[52:19] and we will go through that portion of
[52:21] it
[52:22] another day but we're laying the
[52:25] foundation for the study
[52:28] or the furtherance of the word of god
[52:31] and how the scripture moved on me he
[52:32] said
[52:34] deuteronomy this is the 24th
[52:36] a paragraph says deuteronomy being a
[52:39] greek word that means two laws
[52:43] the word deuteronomy god has two laws
[52:47] and one of them is the law of death
[52:51] to
[52:52] to disobedience to his word
[52:56] we find that when eve disobeyed his word
[52:59] it brought death
[53:01] that's one of the laws
[53:03] the day that you eat thereof
[53:06] that day you die
[53:10] and when he
[53:12] and then he has another law
[53:15] which is the law of life
[53:17] to obedience
[53:19] if you do
[53:21] if you don't do such a thing like
[53:23] keeping his word you'll live
[53:27] so it boils down to two things in my way
[53:31] of thinking
[53:32] that's either keeping his word or
[53:35] disobeying his word
[53:40] you can't create an option
[53:43] around that
[53:45] it's two things
[53:47] keep his word is life
[53:50] disobey his word is death you can't
[53:54] scheme with god
[53:58] and paul said would we sin
[54:00] that grace might abound
[54:03] god forgive
[54:04] so we're we're talking as we're moving
[54:06] through this word we're trying to come
[54:10] to this understanding today
[54:13] that god has given us a place
[54:17] and he wants to get us all there
[54:21] it's like all going to the same
[54:23] restaurant together
[54:26] and sitting down and feasting on the
[54:29] word together
[54:30] so it's not us one being here and one
[54:34] being there but he's saying there's a
[54:35] place i provided a place
[54:38] that you can all gather
[54:40] and all be won and all be fed
[54:45] and we want to find that place
[54:49] so he says here he says one of these
[54:51] laws was given at mount sinai
[54:54] and the other
[54:56] law
[54:57] that's the law of death and the other
[54:59] law was given at mount calvary
[55:03] and the law of life was given
[55:06] through christ jesus
[55:10] he also had two covenants
[55:13] he had a covenant with adam
[55:15] the first man on earth
[55:18] and that covenant
[55:19] was on condition
[55:22] if you do so and so
[55:24] i will do so and so
[55:27] adam
[55:28] would had something to do
[55:31] in order to keep this covenant alive
[55:35] before god
[55:36] he had to walk in god's way
[55:39] keeping all of his word
[55:42] and not breaking one word
[55:45] so adam's existence in the garden was
[55:49] based on if he stayed this and didn't
[55:52] break one word
[55:56] well we know that didn't happen right
[55:59] he said how do i know that didn't happen
[56:02] because here i is
[56:08] he did
[56:09] but then he made another covenant
[56:13] and that was with abraham
[56:17] so we're talking about this place
[56:20] you understand now the first thing that
[56:22] god has got to deal with
[56:24] before he can get you to this place is
[56:27] your mind
[56:30] because that's where the battle is
[56:34] so basically we need to get out of our
[56:36] mind
[56:38] when someone says you're out of your
[56:40] mind you ought to say praise god
[56:44] that's what i've been trying to do i've
[56:47] been trying to lose my mind
[56:50] [Applause]
[56:53] it's where the battle is
[56:56] you create your own enemy in your mind
[57:00] you create in your mind something that
[57:03] you are not and then you let it torment
[57:06] you
[57:13] i want the mind of christ
[57:15] i want what he thinks about me
[57:19] that's what i want
[57:22] i only want to dwell on what
[57:25] he has done for me
[57:30] because that's truth
[57:33] and what sets you free
[57:35] it's truth that sets you free i'm sorry
[57:38] i might get going preaching a long time
[57:39] i don't preach so long this feels so
[57:41] good
[57:44] he said he said
[57:47] he said but he made another covenant and
[57:49] that was with abraham
[57:51] and this covenant was not on condition
[57:55] but was unconditional
[57:58] god gave the covenant to err
[58:00] abraham no strings tied to it at all
[58:04] unconditional not i will but i have
[58:10] it's already done it
[58:15] that's what he said here i've already
[58:16] done it
[58:21] he was now sharing the covenant
[58:24] with abraham thy seed
[58:27] shall possess
[58:28] the gates of the enemy
[58:30] i've already finished it
[58:33] he said
[58:34] now listen to this verse 31
[58:37] and that's the law
[58:40] that christians
[58:41] must live by
[58:45] now we're talking about a place
[58:48] a position
[58:50] a place that you live
[58:53] by this law
[58:56] it's what governs your life
[58:59] a law is a governing force that governs
[59:02] your life
[59:04] because of sin we're under the law of
[59:06] gravity
[59:09] but when you get from this eden
[59:12] which is satan's eden
[59:14] over into the original
[59:17] eden there's a whole other set of laws
[59:20] that governs it
[59:21] and you'll be able to travel in a
[59:23] thought you'll be able to speak worlds
[59:25] into existence and go live on them whole
[59:28] glory even so come quickly lord jesus
[59:32] he said now that's the law christian
[59:36] must live by
[59:38] it's not what we do ourselves
[59:41] but what he has done for us
[59:49] christ
[59:50] has already been sacrificed
[59:54] not he will be
[59:57] but has
[59:59] been
[1:00:01] and we're not looking for him to do a
[1:00:04] work
[1:00:05] it's already done
[1:00:07] we're not looking for him to come down
[1:00:11] and bring us heaven we're already
[1:00:15] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:00:18] jesus
[1:00:19] we're already possessing
[1:00:23] the gates of the enemy
[1:00:25] we're already possessing eternal life
[1:00:29] in other words
[1:00:30] if you've have eternal life you've
[1:00:32] always had it so he wants to get to the
[1:00:36] believer to the place where they can
[1:00:39] live
[1:00:40] knowing that they possess eternal life
[1:00:43] and it's not something that's a will be
[1:00:46] but it's a something that is
[1:00:51] we need to move past the will be
[1:00:56] i don't want to be a willaby
[1:01:02] and i don't want to be a wannabe
[1:01:04] i want to be a has been
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:11] the old man has passed away i'm a new
[1:01:14] creature in christ jesus there's a place
[1:01:19] that we're talking about
[1:01:22] he says that's the law of christ
[1:01:25] it is
[1:01:26] it's been he he said
[1:01:29] it's not
[1:01:30] will be it has been
[1:01:33] it's a finished product
[1:01:39] he lived died and rose again ascended
[1:01:43] into heaven and has come back in the
[1:01:47] form of the holy ghost
[1:01:49] so it's a finished work with god
[1:01:53] christ knowing no sin
[1:01:57] became my sin
[1:01:59] that i might stand in his place
[1:02:02] he took my place that i might stand
[1:02:07] in his place
[1:02:10] so where he was standing
[1:02:12] sinless
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:17] where he was standing knowing that he
[1:02:20] come from god and went to god
[1:02:23] where he was standing the father hath
[1:02:25] given all things into my hands where
[1:02:28] that place that he was
[1:02:32] he became us
[1:02:34] that we might become him that we might
[1:02:37] stand in that place
[1:02:39] in that position
[1:02:46] now
[1:02:48] why i don't know why we doubt
[1:02:51] you know why we doubt because there's a
[1:02:53] line snail devil
[1:02:57] that one day we've got to con get the
[1:03:00] courage to say get behind me satan
[1:03:03] well you were yet sinners
[1:03:06] he died for you
[1:03:08] because he had to pay for what you're
[1:03:10] going to be not what you were
[1:03:15] he said if it's a finished work
[1:03:18] god
[1:03:19] finished work with god
[1:03:23] it's a finished work with god
[1:03:26] so he already knows
[1:03:28] right christ knowing no sin
[1:03:31] became my sin that i might stand in his
[1:03:35] place he took my place i was in him at
[1:03:39] calvary and when he died there i must
[1:03:42] die with him to live because the law of
[1:03:45] sin and death is in my body
[1:03:48] we have to die to be reconciled to him
[1:03:56] beautiful thing
[1:03:57] so what do you have to die to
[1:04:01] you have to die to the covenant
[1:04:06] of i have to do this
[1:04:12] it's hard to accept the gift
[1:04:16] now let's just turn quickly
[1:04:18] over to paragraph 35.
[1:04:25] there's a whole lot in between that
[1:04:27] but i'm just trying to get to my thought
[1:04:30] to lay this down just this evening about
[1:04:33] this place
[1:04:35] that we're invited to
[1:04:37] we have the
[1:04:38] ticket
[1:04:40] so we just got to get on the journey
[1:04:43] that's right
[1:04:44] it says
[1:04:46] now this is this 35
[1:04:48] and this world
[1:04:51] must soon come
[1:04:53] to an end
[1:04:55] it can't go much longer
[1:04:58] sin is too deep
[1:05:01] it's beyond hope
[1:05:03] there is no more hope for the world it's
[1:05:06] past that
[1:05:10] now i know we sit here and we read that
[1:05:12] and say this is 65 why are we here we're
[1:05:14] going to talk about that
[1:05:16] just in a moment
[1:05:18] i believe the holy spirit is gleaning in
[1:05:21] the field
[1:05:23] finding this one and that one
[1:05:27] for the hour is far spent
[1:05:30] the gospel has been preached to every
[1:05:33] nation
[1:05:35] and things has followed it
[1:05:39] but yet the gospel has went on just the
[1:05:43] same there's only one true gospel it was
[1:05:46] the gospel that was preached with the
[1:05:49] promise of the baptism of the holy
[1:05:51] spirit with the promise of a place
[1:05:56] and a position
[1:05:58] that the believer could live in
[1:06:00] and serve god
[1:06:02] there's been all kinds of bogus
[1:06:04] denominations
[1:06:06] all kinds of bogus teachings all kinds
[1:06:09] of men rising up to share the glory of
[1:06:12] god there's been all kinds of schemes
[1:06:15] that says if you do this if you do that
[1:06:18] you do this you live by this you follow
[1:06:21] me you give one of the biggest lies
[1:06:24] that's ever been preached is the
[1:06:25] prosperity gospel
[1:06:29] give me money
[1:06:31] i will bless you and make you love the
[1:06:34] world more
[1:06:38] you can drive a better car live in a
[1:06:40] better house my goodness i'm tired of
[1:06:43] this house i'm tired of this house
[1:06:53] he said but the gospels went on just the
[1:06:56] same
[1:06:57] and now at the end time
[1:07:00] we see
[1:07:02] the things happening
[1:07:04] the way they are
[1:07:06] there's a great
[1:07:08] warning
[1:07:09] amongst the elect people of god to find
[1:07:14] what
[1:07:15] is right
[1:07:19] there's a great warning
[1:07:21] amongst the people of god to find what's
[1:07:24] right that's what's going on in your
[1:07:26] heart
[1:07:31] what's right
[1:07:35] we don't want to accept this message
[1:07:39] in any alternative form
[1:07:42] or motive or objective
[1:07:45] this message is not to give us something
[1:07:48] to follow it's to give us eternal life
[1:07:52] and the revelation of jesus christ and
[1:07:56] what he was in the beginning the true
[1:07:58] word of god
[1:08:06] he says and it behooves us
[1:08:09] to know that
[1:08:12] so there's we're at the end and there's
[1:08:15] some we see things happening the way
[1:08:18] they are
[1:08:19] because there's a great warning amongst
[1:08:22] the elect people of god define what's
[1:08:24] right
[1:08:25] that's why we see the things happening
[1:08:28] that are happening
[1:08:30] it's supposed to be a warning to us to
[1:08:33] get right
[1:08:37] now
[1:08:38] get right i'm not talking about cleaning
[1:08:40] up your life
[1:08:44] i'm talking about
[1:08:46] getting to the right place
[1:08:50] the right position
[1:08:52] the right relationship
[1:08:54] with god in his word
[1:09:00] john said no man can love the world in
[1:09:02] the things of the world and still love
[1:09:04] god the love of god is not in them
[1:09:07] so we're not talking about
[1:09:09] quitting smoking drinking the
[1:09:11] temptations of the flesh
[1:09:14] we're talking about god has provided a
[1:09:17] place for us
[1:09:20] a position
[1:09:21] of rest
[1:09:23] come unto me all ye that are heavy laden
[1:09:26] and i'll give you
[1:09:28] rest
[1:09:31] i'll give you joy unspeakable
[1:09:35] i'll give you peace
[1:09:38] that surpasses understanding
[1:09:41] so we're talking about a place
[1:09:45] and here he says that god that the lord
[1:09:49] direct your hearts
[1:09:52] into the love of god
[1:09:56] into the patient
[1:09:59] waiting for christ
[1:10:01] so he's telling us there's a place
[1:10:05] there's a position
[1:10:08] there's a land
[1:10:11] that we've been invited to be in
[1:10:14] because that's the launch place
[1:10:21] that's where we want to find ourselves
[1:10:25] so what we're talking about
[1:10:27] is that place
[1:10:33] he says
[1:10:35] and it behooves us to know that
[1:10:40] so it behooves us to know that god has
[1:10:44] trained you to direct us
[1:10:48] to a place
[1:10:50] a peace of mind
[1:10:53] a piece of spirit
[1:10:55] a patient waiting
[1:11:00] he said
[1:11:02] but he said
[1:11:05] he behooves us to know that
[1:11:07] now not somebody's theory
[1:11:12] but to know what is truth
[1:11:17] what the bible says
[1:11:20] is
[1:11:21] the truth
[1:11:22] because it will be too late one of these
[1:11:25] days for us
[1:11:27] and this may be the day
[1:11:30] so let's take
[1:11:32] real consideration
[1:11:34] of what god
[1:11:36] has
[1:11:37] said
[1:11:40] boy we really i think we ought to take
[1:11:42] real consideration about what this
[1:11:44] message is
[1:11:45] and what's in it and what he's trying to
[1:11:48] tell us
[1:11:49] in other words it's it's not a theory oh
[1:11:51] i believe everything brother branham
[1:11:53] said i believe this quote i believe that
[1:11:55] quote
[1:11:56] wait a minute that's not what he's
[1:11:57] talking about he's talking about a place
[1:12:01] a position
[1:12:03] a condition
[1:12:05] a reality
[1:12:08] a possession
[1:12:11] that the believer must find
[1:12:13] and the reason he gave the message was
[1:12:16] so that the message was the only thing
[1:12:20] that could lead us to that place because
[1:12:23] satan got this book and told millions of
[1:12:26] lies from it
[1:12:30] so people got the book
[1:12:33] but now somebody's come to reveal the
[1:12:35] author
[1:12:36] [Applause]
[1:12:40] so that you can know
[1:12:43] the author of the book and when you have
[1:12:45] a re-personal relation with the author
[1:12:48] of the book he will reveal to you what
[1:12:51] it is he meant when he wrote the book
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] do you love god's word
[1:13:01] remember
[1:13:06] he said
[1:13:12] and so one of these days be too late for
[1:13:14] us
[1:13:15] and this may be the day so let's take
[1:13:17] real consideration
[1:13:19] of what god has said remember when god
[1:13:22] speaks a word he can never take it back
[1:13:27] it has to ever remain the same
[1:13:30] he can never say something and say
[1:13:34] well i didn't exactly mean that
[1:13:39] that's why he's got to bring to pass
[1:13:42] what he said
[1:13:44] that's what makes him the own
[1:13:46] interpreter of his word
[1:13:48] aren't you glad you're a part of that
[1:13:50] well don't you understand that god is
[1:13:53] going to interpret you
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:01] oh god
[1:14:03] would you please reveal what you had in
[1:14:05] mind when you made me
[1:14:08] because i look in the mirror and i think
[1:14:10] you didn't even know what you're doing
[1:14:14] come on
[1:14:15] but he said i'll bring you into
[1:14:17] obedience and i'll show you who you are
[1:14:20] you'll learn of me by obedience
[1:14:22] and by the things you suffer
[1:14:26] that's what god wants
[1:14:28] he don't want church members
[1:14:31] he wants sons and daughters
[1:14:41] well i didn't exactly mean that see he's
[1:14:44] infinite he knows the best
[1:14:47] to begin with we say things that we
[1:14:50] think is best then after a while we take
[1:14:53] it back
[1:14:57] man
[1:15:00] that cut me to a car
[1:15:03] someone told me they i listened to a
[1:15:05] sermon that
[1:15:06] you preached in
[1:15:08] 2014 i just sat there and shuddered
[1:15:14] i'd hate to listen to something i
[1:15:16] preached in 2014.
[1:15:18] i sure hope i moved on
[1:15:28] but god can't do that
[1:15:31] and remain god
[1:15:33] so if he's infinite
[1:15:36] he does not do that
[1:15:39] because he is perfect in every word
[1:15:43] we utter
[1:15:45] he never utters a word
[1:15:47] unless it's eternal
[1:15:50] all of his eternal
[1:15:53] all of his eternals
[1:15:57] was with him
[1:15:59] at the beginning
[1:16:01] his thoughts
[1:16:02] his attributes
[1:16:04] and there's only one
[1:16:07] expressing
[1:16:08] and they're only expressing themselves
[1:16:12] in
[1:16:13] the world
[1:16:14] today
[1:16:16] hello expression of god
[1:16:21] now remember
[1:16:23] he has a provided place
[1:16:26] one place alone
[1:16:28] where he'll meet the believing children
[1:16:32] anywhere else
[1:16:34] won't
[1:16:35] work
[1:16:39] now
[1:16:41] think of this place
[1:16:44] okay so
[1:16:45] are you
[1:16:46] am i are we making ourselves clear
[1:16:50] that we're talking about a place that
[1:16:54] exists
[1:16:58] call it a state of mind i don't care
[1:17:03] call it a
[1:17:05] a realm
[1:17:07] that's fine
[1:17:09] it's hard to come up with words
[1:17:12] but it's an eternal
[1:17:14] existence
[1:17:16] where we become part of eternity
[1:17:23] and it's not where we're going
[1:17:26] it's where we are
[1:17:29] we get there before we get there
[1:17:37] so we're there
[1:17:38] and one day it becomes a
[1:17:41] reality
[1:17:42] and then we step from this mind
[1:17:46] and this body
[1:17:47] right into that place
[1:17:50] but he's given us a foretaste of glory
[1:17:53] divine he starts to share that place
[1:17:56] with us am i out of my mind
[1:18:00] it's wonderful
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:04] it hasn't even entered into the thoughts
[1:18:06] of man the things that god's prepared
[1:18:09] for them that love them
[1:18:14] that's why he said we're already sitting
[1:18:16] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:18:19] it exists now
[1:18:21] but we need the word of god to i save to
[1:18:26] cleanse our minds
[1:18:27] and of our unbelief and bring us to the
[1:18:31] realization of the position and the
[1:18:34] place that we're in in christ jesus
[1:18:41] let me get my breath
[1:18:48] so
[1:18:48] this place
[1:18:52] this place is
[1:18:55] the lord jesus christ
[1:18:58] i am the way
[1:18:59] the truth the life
[1:19:02] no man cometh to the father but by being
[1:19:07] in me
[1:19:10] i will not leave you without me
[1:19:13] but i will come again and i'll be with
[1:19:16] you
[1:19:17] even in you
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:23] now you might not feel that you're in
[1:19:25] this that place
[1:19:27] but you are in that place
[1:19:30] because he's already spoke it
[1:19:36] but what's the word of god for
[1:19:38] to give us i sav that we might see
[1:19:43] to give us
[1:19:44] gold
[1:19:46] that's tried in fire a christ-like
[1:19:48] character
[1:19:50] and to give us clothing that
[1:19:53] we will not be ashamed
[1:19:55] so that we can see
[1:19:58] we can be clothed
[1:20:00] and we can have character
[1:20:02] because without that character we can't
[1:20:05] live in that place
[1:20:06] so he's trying to get us to where we can
[1:20:10] comfortably live in that place
[1:20:14] without condemnation
[1:20:19] so
[1:20:20] another so this place is jesus christ
[1:20:24] now
[1:20:25] it's not a belief
[1:20:30] i believe in the godhead i believe in
[1:20:32] this i believe in that i believe in the
[1:20:35] baptism the holy spirit those are all
[1:20:38] biblical facts
[1:20:43] in other words jesus is more real to me
[1:20:45] than george washington
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:50] i never saw the cherry tree stump
[1:20:56] but i saw that
[1:20:58] i meant the man that hung there
[1:21:04] who's the guy that's supposed to throw
[1:21:05] the dollar across the river or something
[1:21:09] well yeah might as well have
[1:21:12] he's as good as anybody else
[1:21:15] just one more lie
[1:21:21] was it abraham lincoln that never told a
[1:21:23] lie
[1:21:26] now who in the face of the bible
[1:21:28] when the bible says all men come into
[1:21:30] the world speaking lies would try to
[1:21:33] have the testimony he never told the lie
[1:21:35] lie
[1:21:36] that's a lie right there
[1:21:39] he's the father of lies and there's no
[1:21:41] truth in him
[1:21:43] so let we we're trying to establish this
[1:21:46] place because it's not religion
[1:21:51] religion is teachings about this place
[1:21:55] you can be religious without ever being
[1:21:58] in the place
[1:22:04] so it's like looking at pictures of food
[1:22:07] on the
[1:22:08] internet and licking your chops
[1:22:12] well that's a good restaurant well that
[1:22:14] looks good
[1:22:16] but you never tasted it
[1:22:18] you never been there
[1:22:20] come on
[1:22:22] i went to some of them places got the
[1:22:23] best reputation in the world and i
[1:22:25] wouldn't feed it to my dog
[1:22:28] praise god i don't got a dog because he
[1:22:30] wouldn't live long
[1:22:34] so it's it's it's not a belief
[1:22:38] or a history a
[1:22:41] historical
[1:22:43] acknowledgement
[1:22:47] it's not acknowledging that jesus
[1:22:51] was
[1:22:52] or what he did
[1:22:55] if i confess that i'm a sinner
[1:22:59] and i acknowledge
[1:23:01] that jesus christ
[1:23:04] did something in the past you're saved
[1:23:10] what a lie
[1:23:13] no you're saved when you enter in to his
[1:23:17] rest
[1:23:18] i will give you rest
[1:23:21] i'll provide for you a place that you
[1:23:25] can rest i will provide a place for you
[1:23:30] i will direct direct you to a place to a
[1:23:34] position where you can patiently
[1:23:37] wait
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:45] for christ
[1:23:48] not only in his returning
[1:23:52] but in his patient
[1:23:55] revelation of himself
[1:23:58] to you
[1:24:03] waiting
[1:24:05] for his time
[1:24:07] lord direct me to the place
[1:24:09] that i can wait on you to reveal
[1:24:12] yourself i can wait for you to transform
[1:24:15] me i can wait for the seed in me to grow
[1:24:20] through its growing process and bring
[1:24:22] forth the fruit
[1:24:24] oh god
[1:24:26] hallelujah
[1:24:30] that place exists
[1:24:34] i believe he's revealing it
[1:24:37] he said not a historical
[1:24:39] acknowledgement not a moral code
[1:24:45] or
[1:24:46] a religious culture
[1:24:50] that's what we've got in this message
[1:24:52] today
[1:24:53] not the true message
[1:24:55] but the idea of the message has become a
[1:24:59] religious culture
[1:25:03] the message is an experience
[1:25:06] it was a prophet
[1:25:08] that had an experience
[1:25:11] the real experience of the revealed word
[1:25:14] for our day
[1:25:16] because he had come into contact with
[1:25:20] deity
[1:25:21] and that deity came and dwelt in him and
[1:25:25] therefore he was the first fruit
[1:25:28] of someone that had come into that place
[1:25:31] and it was waved out over the people
[1:25:37] so that we could look
[1:25:40] and live
[1:25:45] so it's not a religious culture
[1:25:48] culture is something that is taught
[1:25:51] it's not inherited
[1:25:54] so we don't want the culture of having
[1:25:56] long hair
[1:25:58] and the culture of having
[1:26:00] long dresses and the culture of not
[1:26:02] wearing makeup
[1:26:03] and the culture of doing this and the
[1:26:05] culture of doing that
[1:26:09] amen
[1:26:10] but we want it to be the fruit
[1:26:13] of whom that we've meant
[1:26:18] because you can do all those things
[1:26:20] and not be in this place
[1:26:23] but so we want to talk about this place
[1:26:26] so what is that place but it's a present
[1:26:29] tense union
[1:26:32] with his
[1:26:34] indwelling
[1:26:36] presence
[1:26:37] and person
[1:26:41] it's a union
[1:26:44] an invisible union it's a union you have
[1:26:53] total confidence
[1:26:57] total rest
[1:27:00] so it's it's a presence with this person
[1:27:03] it's a place
[1:27:05] or a
[1:27:06] position
[1:27:10] okay
[1:27:12] now
[1:27:13] so he wants to bring us to that place
[1:27:16] and we'll talk about that more
[1:27:20] but we sit here
[1:27:22] and we say he said that in 65
[1:27:25] why are we still here
[1:27:31] because we're a memorial
[1:27:35] to what that he did on calvary
[1:27:39] he came to redeem a bride
[1:27:42] is that correct
[1:27:44] and that bride
[1:27:48] is a memorial
[1:27:51] to what that he did
[1:27:53] if the bride never comes into existence
[1:27:57] free from sin
[1:28:00] and dwelling in this place
[1:28:02] then calvary didn't work
[1:28:08] if he never sent the comforter
[1:28:12] or returned into the holy spirit
[1:28:15] so the holy spirit is in some place you
[1:28:17] go the holy spirit came to direct you
[1:28:21] and lead you
[1:28:23] into all truth and righteousness he came
[1:28:26] to direct you and to lead you to the
[1:28:29] place that was already in you
[1:28:32] in his thoughts in his word from
[1:28:34] beginning
[1:28:40] to the eternal life
[1:28:43] that was already in you
[1:28:45] he's got to lead you through the jungle
[1:28:47] of your mind
[1:28:50] he's got to lead you through the harvest
[1:28:53] fields of your flesh and the things that
[1:28:57] you've sowed
[1:28:58] and you've reaped
[1:29:00] he's got to lead you through all the
[1:29:02] confusion of the lying devil
[1:29:06] and the deceit of this world
[1:29:10] and the deception of the eye and the
[1:29:13] deception of the census and the
[1:29:15] deception of the realms of emotion until
[1:29:18] he can bring you to that created place
[1:29:22] of inward peace that's in you the place
[1:29:25] where you can worship him
[1:29:35] it's a
[1:29:37] a place
[1:29:40] that he wants us
[1:29:42] to go
[1:29:44] and so
[1:29:45] we're a memorial
[1:29:47] that that place exists
[1:29:56] the works that i do
[1:29:58] you shall do also
[1:30:00] there's a place
[1:30:03] not
[1:30:04] attributes you take all these attributes
[1:30:08] to that place
[1:30:09] silver and gold have i none but that
[1:30:12] which i possess
[1:30:14] i give to you
[1:30:20] and we just want to know am i there
[1:30:24] it behooves us to know what's right
[1:30:28] it behooves us
[1:30:29] to
[1:30:31] take into consideration
[1:30:33] it behooves us to quit looking at
[1:30:35] circumstances
[1:30:38] and what our loved ones has done
[1:30:40] and look at the possibility that god has
[1:30:44] for them in his mind
[1:30:48] so in order for something to be a
[1:30:50] memorial
[1:30:53] it has to be tested
[1:30:56] it's got to be proved
[1:31:00] so it can't be just a claim
[1:31:07] it can't be a claim
[1:31:10] my peace i give to you
[1:31:14] my joy i give to you
[1:31:17] it can't remain on paper
[1:31:24] he can't leave it on paper
[1:31:28] you understand he can't fail
[1:31:31] he can't promise an elect lady because
[1:31:34] he can't take
[1:31:38] that word back
[1:31:42] he can't take it back
[1:31:44] he can't say oh i'm going to make it
[1:31:47] different that's when he wiped out the
[1:31:49] world he had to carry that seat over
[1:31:57] oh she wouldn't be here
[1:32:01] he can't take it back
[1:32:04] he can't take it back my sheep will hear
[1:32:06] my voice
[1:32:08] he can't take it back they'll enter into
[1:32:10] my rest he can't take it back they'll
[1:32:13] have gold tried in fire
[1:32:15] he can't take it back
[1:32:18] that behold
[1:32:20] i knock
[1:32:21] and if they open i'll come in and sup
[1:32:24] with them none of it can be taken back
[1:32:27] how does he prove his word by
[1:32:30] predestinating a people to be there that
[1:32:33] will receive it
[1:32:36] but a memorial
[1:32:39] must be tested
[1:32:43] it's got to be a time-tested memorial
[1:32:48] prophet of god in time tested memorial a
[1:32:50] guy said well if this be the truth then
[1:32:53] let snakes
[1:32:55] come out of my grave
[1:32:59] what do you think happened
[1:33:03] just like the tree
[1:33:05] falling on the
[1:33:06] truck there's snakes that come out of
[1:33:09] the grave
[1:33:13] so why
[1:33:17] do we have to endure
[1:33:22] these 50 years
[1:33:24] because abraham had to endure
[1:33:27] noah had to endure
[1:33:31] they became time-tested memorials
[1:33:34] the children of israel had to endure
[1:33:38] every
[1:33:39] person that
[1:33:41] has received
[1:33:42] what god has promised
[1:33:45] has to endure the memorial
[1:33:48] of the test of time
[1:33:52] now
[1:33:56] and into
[1:33:58] the patient waiting
[1:34:01] for christ
[1:34:04] that to the the place
[1:34:07] if i could say it this way so it's not
[1:34:10] the attribute of patience
[1:34:16] but a position
[1:34:19] a place
[1:34:20] a position of rest
[1:34:24] a place where you know you are where god
[1:34:27] wants you
[1:34:28] to be
[1:34:34] it's where i he wants me to be
[1:34:38] i'm about my father's business
[1:34:42] i'm not worried
[1:34:43] that's right
[1:34:45] whether i'm right or wrong
[1:34:50] a place where you're happy and content
[1:34:54] and at peace
[1:34:57] to wait on this soon return
[1:35:01] it's like being in the station with the
[1:35:04] ticket in your hand
[1:35:06] knowing the train is going to arrive any
[1:35:08] minute
[1:35:13] my wife wants me to get to that place
[1:35:15] because i say do you have my wallet do
[1:35:17] you have my phone you have the ticket do
[1:35:19] you have the passport you have my global
[1:35:22] entry card yes dear yes dear yes dear
[1:35:26] we get out of the car do you have our
[1:35:28] tickets do you have our plan
[1:35:30] yes dear
[1:35:32] well how long do you think i'm going to
[1:35:33] take yes dear
[1:35:35] finally
[1:35:37] give it to me
[1:35:39] and i take it in my hand i have my
[1:35:42] ticket i have my passport i have my
[1:35:45] global entry i have my seat with my name
[1:35:49] on it
[1:35:53] and i make sure she has hers because i
[1:35:55] want to take her with me
[1:36:03] i don't want it second hand
[1:36:06] and i trust her
[1:36:10] never giving me a reason to doubt her
[1:36:14] but i still like to know it for
[1:36:17] my
[1:36:18] self
[1:36:20] i want to know that i've come to that
[1:36:22] place
[1:36:24] so it's it's a place where we're happy
[1:36:26] paul said in philippians 4 11 i've
[1:36:29] learned no matter whatever state i am to
[1:36:31] be content
[1:36:37] and so
[1:36:39] we come to that place
[1:36:42] that
[1:36:43] position
[1:36:46] and now i'm going to just preach my
[1:36:48] sermon for
[1:36:50] 10 minutes
[1:36:52] and then we'll have a long communion
[1:36:54] night
[1:36:55] and then you can catch that four o'clock
[1:36:57] fight
[1:36:58] in the morning
[1:37:00] you'll be able to sleep
[1:37:02] the whole way because all things work
[1:37:04] together for good to them that love the
[1:37:07] lord
[1:37:08] so there's
[1:37:10] let's talk about
[1:37:12] something that goes on
[1:37:14] in that place
[1:37:17] how can we test whether we're in that
[1:37:21] place or not
[1:37:22] how can we be at peace
[1:37:25] that we're in that place
[1:37:27] and that's why we call this the
[1:37:29] condemnation test
[1:37:36] so if you're not there
[1:37:39] there's something going on in your life
[1:37:43] the very life you're living is
[1:37:45] condemning you
[1:37:47] and you feel that tension
[1:37:52] and that knot at peace
[1:37:54] but he says now when you come into this
[1:37:57] place
[1:37:58] and that place is christ
[1:38:00] and
[1:38:01] first corinthians 12 says
[1:38:03] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[1:38:06] one body
[1:38:07] paragraph 100 of the same message
[1:38:12] now after you're in this body
[1:38:16] in this place
[1:38:18] in this position
[1:38:20] when you're in this body romans 1 says
[1:38:23] there is therefore now
[1:38:26] no condemnation
[1:38:28] to them that are in christ jesus
[1:38:33] that are in this place
[1:38:38] think of it if you have to you're in
[1:38:40] this restaurant you're in this building
[1:38:43] you're in this existence once you get in
[1:38:46] there
[1:38:47] there's total peace
[1:38:49] there's no condemnation
[1:38:52] there's no way trying to figure a way
[1:38:54] out or in
[1:38:57] or to leave it and try to figure a way
[1:38:59] you can get back in
[1:39:01] there's no condemnation
[1:39:03] to them that are in christ jesus
[1:39:06] that walk not after the flesh
[1:39:09] but after the spirit
[1:39:10] there is the place
[1:39:13] where there is no condemnation
[1:39:18] there is a place
[1:39:23] where there's no condemnation
[1:39:27] where you're not hating yourself
[1:39:34] where you know how to deal with your
[1:39:35] flesh
[1:39:37] there is a
[1:39:38] place you hear them
[1:39:41] there is a place that there's no
[1:39:43] condemnation
[1:39:45] whether you go to a methodist baptist
[1:39:48] presbyterian church wherever it is if
[1:39:51] you are in christ you are a new creature
[1:39:55] and there is no
[1:39:57] condemnation in you
[1:40:00] nowhere at all
[1:40:06] boy
[1:40:08] i start to think about all the things
[1:40:11] that are bugging me
[1:40:16] could it be that they're bugging me
[1:40:22] because
[1:40:23] they don't belong in that place
[1:40:29] the test
[1:40:30] of condemnation
[1:40:33] condemnation is not a bad thing
[1:40:39] it's it's a a good thing
[1:40:43] mark i think it's 16 or so talks of it
[1:40:49] he says
[1:40:52] there there's and there is no
[1:40:54] condemnation in you
[1:40:57] nowhere at all
[1:40:58] that's god's meeting place
[1:41:03] that's the place he wants to be
[1:41:06] that's the place he wants to meet you
[1:41:08] that's where god meets the worshiper
[1:41:12] there is where you
[1:41:14] you are accounted a new creature
[1:41:18] for
[1:41:19] they're dead to the things of the world
[1:41:23] they're alive in him
[1:41:26] the living presence of god
[1:41:30] is with them
[1:41:31] day
[1:41:32] by
[1:41:33] day
[1:41:36] may
[1:41:37] the spirit direct you
[1:41:41] your hearts
[1:41:43] into
[1:41:44] the love of god amen
[1:41:48] what he's trying to get us to do get us
[1:41:50] to where we love god
[1:41:52] above all the things of the world
[1:41:55] above our own families
[1:41:57] above our own friends jesus said i have
[1:42:01] not come
[1:42:03] to you and i but i've come to divide
[1:42:07] if you don't love father
[1:42:08] mother
[1:42:09] home place
[1:42:12] more than me
[1:42:14] you have no part
[1:42:17] in me
[1:42:18] now don't
[1:42:20] take this negative
[1:42:22] because condemnation is not condemnation
[1:42:35] you understand there's a difference
[1:42:37] between being condemned
[1:42:39] and being convicted
[1:42:43] he says
[1:42:45] he lives in them
[1:42:48] through every age
[1:42:51] every age he comes along
[1:42:54] down through the bible
[1:42:57] and when man
[1:43:00] meets god's requirement
[1:43:03] comes into the place
[1:43:06] to where he
[1:43:07] provided
[1:43:09] in his written word
[1:43:12] for that day
[1:43:13] god makes that person
[1:43:16] to be a new creature
[1:43:18] and he has no
[1:43:20] condemnation
[1:43:22] look at
[1:43:23] job
[1:43:28] so he's he's trying to direct our hearts
[1:43:33] to a place
[1:43:35] where we can
[1:43:36] wait
[1:43:38] for his soon coming
[1:43:40] and for his revelation
[1:43:43] and for his further revealing in us but
[1:43:46] how can we
[1:43:48] test that what comes along because if
[1:43:52] anything comes along
[1:43:54] and gives us
[1:43:56] condemnation
[1:43:59] or an uneasy feeling
[1:44:02] or that voice speaks within us this
[1:44:05] isn't right
[1:44:06] praise god
[1:44:08] that's the test
[1:44:10] that we're leaving that place
[1:44:18] for where there's condemnation
[1:44:20] we're not walking in the spirit
[1:44:23] for there's no condemnation for them
[1:44:25] that walk in the spirit and not after
[1:44:28] the flesh so the minute we start walking
[1:44:31] after the flesh the test of condemnation
[1:44:34] comes condemnation tests that place
[1:44:40] you know while we said oh oh
[1:44:43] i don't this don't feel right to me
[1:44:49] you take that drink you feel that
[1:44:50] condemnation then we know that's not the
[1:44:52] place
[1:44:53] you smoke that cigarette you feel that
[1:44:55] condemnation you know that's a place
[1:44:57] thank god for condemnation because
[1:45:00] what's the holy spirit come to do it's
[1:45:02] come to convict
[1:45:04] men of unbelief amen
[1:45:10] it's come to give you condemnation
[1:45:13] when something is taking you outside the
[1:45:16] word of god it's the test of
[1:45:19] condemnation condemnation has been given
[1:45:23] to us yes
[1:45:26] as a testing tool
[1:45:28] to know whether we're in the spirit or
[1:45:30] not
[1:45:34] whether you're going to take what he
[1:45:35] said or not
[1:45:41] i know what it's like to be on a fishing
[1:45:42] boat and be the only guy there and a
[1:45:44] pair of pants
[1:45:49] why don't you have a pair of bermudas
[1:45:51] you need a pair of bermudas
[1:45:53] i got a knife i can cut those off for
[1:45:55] you
[1:45:59] if i cut those things off i would leave
[1:46:01] my place
[1:46:04] you think i'm going to leave my place
[1:46:06] for a bunch of bullies
[1:46:11] i say no
[1:46:14] the lord wants me to wear these
[1:46:17] and i'm not ashamed
[1:46:19] because blessed is he who is not ashamed
[1:46:22] in me
[1:46:24] blessed is he who is not offended i'm
[1:46:27] not offended of the place that god wants
[1:46:30] me to be
[1:46:31] and if i start to leave that place there
[1:46:35] is a spirit of condemnation
[1:46:38] that meets me there and i know there's
[1:46:41] no condemnation to them who are in
[1:46:44] christ praise god for the test
[1:46:53] look at job
[1:46:55] but look job regardless of how many
[1:46:59] people tried to condemn him how many
[1:47:02] said he was wrong
[1:47:04] he was keeping the commandments of god
[1:47:08] by that burn offering
[1:47:11] he knowed he was justified
[1:47:14] because he was keeping the commandments
[1:47:16] of god
[1:47:17] that's how he was justified because he
[1:47:20] was doing the things that god
[1:47:25] wanted
[1:47:26] him
[1:47:27] to do
[1:47:32] just think of that
[1:47:34] can you imagine being in a place
[1:47:36] where that spirit can't nag you
[1:47:39] or bug you
[1:47:41] or there's no doubt
[1:47:43] there's rest
[1:47:45] may god
[1:47:46] direct your heart
[1:47:48] into the love of god
[1:47:51] amen
[1:47:53] into the patient waiting
[1:47:56] waiting
[1:47:57] for him to reveal himself in you
[1:48:00] and to live in you
[1:48:02] and to come soon to you
[1:48:04] and thank god
[1:48:06] there's condemnation
[1:48:09] in our heart
[1:48:12] because if god condemns us
[1:48:15] he's greater
[1:48:16] than our heart
[1:48:20] we could
[1:48:21] i guess we could read that
[1:48:23] if we wanted to
[1:48:25] first john
[1:48:26] the third chapter
[1:48:28] and the 20th verse let's just read that
[1:48:32] as we
[1:48:33] close
[1:48:34] this evening
[1:48:54] first john
[1:48:56] what was it i i just had it here
[1:48:59] if i could
[1:49:01] yeah first john 3 and
[1:49:03] and
[1:49:04] 20.
[1:49:13] my little 18th verse my little children
[1:49:16] let us not love
[1:49:18] in word
[1:49:20] neither in tongue
[1:49:22] but in deed
[1:49:23] and in truth
[1:49:25] may god lead you
[1:49:27] into the love of god
[1:49:29] may god direct your hearts to the love
[1:49:32] of god
[1:49:33] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:49:36] truth
[1:49:38] and shall assure our hearts before him
[1:49:42] for if our hearts condemn us
[1:49:45] god is greater than our heart
[1:49:48] and knoweth all things
[1:49:50] beloved if our heart condemn us not
[1:49:54] then we have confidence
[1:49:57] towards god
[1:50:01] the test
[1:50:03] of condemnation
[1:50:07] what couldn't eve do
[1:50:13] right we're talking about being led
[1:50:16] into the place
[1:50:20] where we can wait
[1:50:23] for christ
[1:50:26] wait for him to do his word
[1:50:29] wait for it to unfold
[1:50:31] knowing we're where he wants us to be
[1:50:34] at perfect rest
[1:50:36] and peace where we are
[1:50:39] now you see
[1:50:41] the seed this is eve now you see the
[1:50:44] seed
[1:50:45] that she was holding
[1:50:48] and would have finally
[1:50:50] become a mother
[1:50:51] by the will of god
[1:50:53] through the spoken word
[1:50:56] she would have finally become a mother
[1:50:59] but she couldn't
[1:51:02] wait
[1:51:06] you don't think there's something to
[1:51:10] being directed
[1:51:12] to the patient waiting place
[1:51:18] notice
[1:51:20] in this bride
[1:51:22] what did she do then
[1:51:25] her first child
[1:51:27] come forth
[1:51:29] it was a bastard child
[1:51:32] and he was full of death
[1:51:35] and caused death
[1:51:37] this is from the spoken word as the
[1:51:39] original seed and caused death
[1:51:42] and everyone since then
[1:51:45] is dead
[1:51:47] now you see it
[1:51:49] it had to be sex
[1:51:51] why
[1:51:53] you dying
[1:51:54] if it wasn't sex
[1:51:57] when god gave a commission
[1:51:59] which cannot perish
[1:52:01] god's word is eternal it cannot fail
[1:52:05] and when he said multiply and replenish
[1:52:08] the earth
[1:52:09] that was god's eternal purpose
[1:52:12] to carry that out
[1:52:14] you could not die because it's his word
[1:52:18] you have to live
[1:52:20] and if a child had been brought forth
[1:52:23] right
[1:52:25] there had been
[1:52:27] no death
[1:52:30] but she couldn't wait
[1:52:34] that's what's the matter today
[1:52:37] you want some kind of phony makeup
[1:52:41] with screaming
[1:52:42] jumping speaking in tongues
[1:52:45] or something instead of waiting for the
[1:52:49] real
[1:52:50] word of god to be made manifest through
[1:52:55] the bride
[1:53:02] wow
[1:53:05] that's why satan
[1:53:06] could get to her
[1:53:10] because there was something in there
[1:53:14] that was true
[1:53:16] now you know why cell phones are of the
[1:53:18] devil
[1:53:22] well you all got one sure
[1:53:27] think of where all our lives would be if
[1:53:28] we all chucked them amen
[1:53:31] amen
[1:53:34] how free we would be
[1:53:36] only living in the place
[1:53:40] no condemnation
[1:53:42] that's how satan could get to her
[1:53:44] because there was something in there
[1:53:47] that wanted to come forth
[1:53:51] and that's why we need the spirit to
[1:53:53] direct us
[1:53:55] to the patient waiting we need to
[1:53:57] understand that condemnation
[1:54:01] is there to protect us
[1:54:04] and to keep us in that place
[1:54:06] and if we ever step into that realm of
[1:54:08] condemnation we can give life the
[1:54:12] condemnation test
[1:54:16] does this condemn me
[1:54:19] do i feel that
[1:54:21] holy unction
[1:54:23] of the spirit
[1:54:25] can i get away from the place where i
[1:54:28] make excuses
[1:54:31] and make decisions
[1:54:33] or can i accept
[1:54:36] the condemnation
[1:54:38] test
[1:54:41] i thank god
[1:54:43] that the spirit
[1:54:45] condemns sin
[1:54:48] when it comes in our life
[1:54:50] and i know when i
[1:54:53] feel that
[1:54:55] condemnation
[1:54:56] i feel that failure that failure doesn't
[1:55:00] tell me i'm lost
[1:55:02] it tells me there's a place
[1:55:05] where there is no condemnation
[1:55:08] that i can live
[1:55:10] life
[1:55:11] and life more abundant
[1:55:14] the wonderful
[1:55:15] holy
[1:55:16] spirit amen
[1:55:19] god bless you let's stand
[1:55:20] and open our bibles
[1:55:22] the brothers we go prepare
[1:55:25] communion
[1:55:35] amen cosmic why don't you come here and
[1:55:39] read the scriptures
[1:55:49] so
[1:56:02] would you come and read here from
[1:56:04] corinthians 11th chapter
[1:56:07] and the 23rd verse
[1:56:10] and read those scriptures the brothers
[1:56:12] if you would get the
[1:56:13] communion together
[1:56:16] and read those
[1:56:31] for i received of the lord that which
[1:56:34] also i delivered unto you
[1:56:36] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:56:38] which he was betrayed
[1:56:40] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:56:43] he break it and said
[1:56:45] take eat this is my body
[1:56:48] which is broken for you
[1:56:50] this do in remembrance of me
[1:56:53] after the same manner
[1:56:55] also he took the cup
[1:56:58] when he stopped saying
[1:56:59] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:57:02] blood
[1:57:03] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:57:06] remembrance of me
[1:57:08] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:57:11] drink this cup
[1:57:12] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:57:15] come
[1:57:16] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:57:18] and drink this cup
[1:57:20] of the lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:57:23] of the body and the blood of the lord
[1:57:26] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:57:29] him eat of that bread
[1:57:31] and drink of that cup
[1:57:34] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:57:36] unworthily eat it and drink it damnation
[1:57:39] to himself
[1:57:40] not discerning the lord's body
[1:57:43] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:57:46] among you and many sleep
[1:57:48] for if we would judge ourselves we would
[1:57:51] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:57:54] are chastened of the lord that we should
[1:57:58] not be condemned with this world
[1:58:01] wherefore my brethren when he come
[1:58:03] together to eat terry one for another
[1:58:06] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:58:09] home that ye come not together unto
[1:58:12] condemnation and the rest will i set an
[1:58:15] order when i come
[1:58:18] do you see it
[1:58:21] there's no condemnation
[1:58:23] in this place examine yourself
[1:58:26] if there's condemnation
[1:58:29] get that place out of your life
[1:58:31] and come into the place
[1:58:33] where you can have communion
[1:58:36] with the lord
[1:58:37] god bless you
[1:58:44] heavenly father we ask you to bless this
[1:58:47] bread
[1:58:48] that represents
[1:58:50] the body
[1:58:52] that was broken for us
[1:58:54] that we could enter into a place where
[1:58:56] there's no condemnation
[1:58:59] because you took sin upon you
[1:59:02] and you've provided us
[1:59:04] this place
[1:59:06] that we can worship
[1:59:09] that's what we're communing father we're
[1:59:11] communing in the place
[1:59:13] where we're free

[1:59:17] lord we ask you to bless this wine
[1:59:20] which represents the blood
[1:59:23] that was shed on our behalf
[1:59:26] and that the life that was in that blood
[1:59:28] could return back onto the believer and
[1:59:32] stimulate them
[1:59:33] and lead them into the love of god
[1:59:36] and into the patient waiting
[1:59:39] for christ
[1:59:42] we asked that this evening father
[1:59:46] that we would
[1:59:47] enjoy this communion
[1:59:49] and fellowship in our freedom
