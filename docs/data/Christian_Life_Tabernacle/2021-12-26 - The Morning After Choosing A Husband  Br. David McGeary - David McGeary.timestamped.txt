[10:19] amen
[10:20] you know many times
[10:22] the way people might spend their

[10:25] might vary drastically
[10:28] some maybe have many families some not
[10:31] much family some might have been alone
[10:34] but if you have jesus christ you have
[10:36] everything and so we're just thankful
[10:38] that
[10:39] for this time of year where we can just
[10:41] celebrate the the greatest gift that man
[10:43] has ever known as the lord jesus christ
[10:45] we're just thankful for each one that's
[10:47] been able to come

[10:49] at this time for the song

[11:01] so grateful to you for your hand upon

[11:12] lord to speak to our hearts
[11:14] to direct our steps
[11:16] to heal our sicknesses
[11:18] to provide our needs
[11:20] lord to show us your words to make
[11:22] yourself known unto us
[11:25] lord we have everything to be grateful
[11:26] for and we just thank you for another
[11:29] opportunity to gather together
[11:31] lord to hear from you
[11:34] to learn of you at your feet to worship
[11:36] you to
[11:37] fellowship one with another
[11:40] to strengthen one another to be
[11:41] strengthened by you
[11:43] we want to be careful to commit this
[11:44] service to you
[11:46] that your will would be done
[11:48] lord that whatever purpose you have for
[11:51] today in your word with your people
[11:55] lord that you would be free to move deal
[11:57] with hearts
[11:58] meet needs
[12:00] make yourself known may this service be
[12:02] done
[12:03] according to your word as we commit it
[12:05] to you we thank you
[12:06] we look to you and we pray these things
[12:08] in jesus name amen
[12:13] good morning
[12:15] and merry christmas
[12:19] it uh
[12:22] you know it's worth noting that the
[12:25] closer you get to the end of the book of
[12:28] psalms
[12:29] the more it the more it becomes
[12:32] about praising the lord
[12:35] in fact the last five chapters
[12:38] of the book of psalms are all about
[12:41] praising the lord
[12:45] all five chapters
[12:47] begin and end with the statement
[12:49] praise ye the lord
[12:53] of the 130 times in the psalms
[12:57] that it speaks of praise
[13:00] 20 percent is in these last five
[13:02] chapters
[13:04] just all about praising the lord so it's
[13:06] interesting that the closer
[13:08] that it gets to the end
[13:10] the more it becomes about praising him
[13:15] you know we tend to think of praise as
[13:19] something we do in church
[13:21] when there's a worship service when a
[13:24] song touches our heart when
[13:26] you know the spirit is moving
[13:30] when the lord comes and deals with our
[13:33] specific need
[13:35] when he meets
[13:37] us in our hour or when we see him or
[13:40] when we hear from him we tend to praise
[13:42] that's that's our reaction
[13:44] and that's good
[13:46] but
[13:47] you know
[13:48] many times
[13:50] there's another level
[13:52] of praise
[13:53] than just us
[13:55] responding
[13:56] to his move in our life
[14:01] you know there's
[14:03] there's a purpose for praise
[14:05] it says in psalm 34 and verse 1 it says
[14:08] i will bless the lord
[14:11] at all times
[14:14] his praise shall continually
[14:17] be in my mouth
[14:19] continuously
[14:21] non-stop praise
[14:24] hebrews 13 15 says something similar by
[14:27] him therefore
[14:29] let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
[14:32] god continually
[14:36] you know there's that word again
[14:38] continuously
[14:40] constantly
[14:42] nonstop
[14:44] praise
[14:46] you know what does that even look like
[14:49] you know certainly we can
[14:51] envision what it's like when we praise
[14:53] the lord when the lord does something
[14:55] for us or when the spirit is moving
[14:57] but to be constantly
[14:59] continually
[15:00] praising the lord
[15:02] does that mean to constantly walk around
[15:04] saying praise the lord
[15:06] whether you feel like it or not
[15:08] is that what it means to constantly
[15:11] continuously
[15:12] praise the lord
[15:16] we're going to read psalm 146 this
[15:18] morning
[15:20] verse 2
[15:22] makes this statement
[15:26] while i live
[15:28] will i praise the lord
[15:31] i will sing praises unto my god
[15:34] while i have any being
[15:38] you know more than just a response
[15:41] our response our praise
[15:44] to the spirit moving
[15:46] meeting our need
[15:50] this speaks of a life of praise
[15:54] while i live
[15:56] there will be praise
[15:58] going forth
[16:00] out of my life
[16:03] while i have any being at all my very
[16:05] existence
[16:07] will be praised
[16:08] unto the lord
[16:12] you know this is us
[16:14] becoming
[16:16] his praise
[16:18] us becoming
[16:20] praise unto the lord
[16:23] you know ephesians 1
[16:25] has several verses about this verse 5
[16:28] says having predestinated us unto the
[16:30] adoption of children
[16:32] by jesus christ to himself
[16:35] according to the good pleasure of his
[16:38] will
[16:39] to the praise
[16:41] of the glory
[16:42] of his grace
[16:44] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[16:47] beloved this isn't about us praising him
[16:51] because of something that he has done
[16:53] for our need or in a worship service
[16:55] this is about him positioning us in such
[16:58] a way that we can become praise unto his
[17:00] glory
[17:02] something totally different than our
[17:04] little attempt
[17:05] at praise how can we
[17:08] offer praise that accurately reflects
[17:11] him
[17:12] only he
[17:13] can take a vessel and make them
[17:16] something that praises him appropriately
[17:19] it says in
[17:21] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[17:23] an inheritance
[17:25] being predestinated according to the
[17:27] purpose of him who worketh all things
[17:30] after the council of his own will
[17:32] that we should be to the praise of his
[17:35] glory
[17:36] again not about us praising him for
[17:38] something he's done for us
[17:40] but him making us something that can
[17:43] appropriately praise him
[17:45] that can reflect
[17:46] him
[17:48] continuous
[17:50] praise
[17:52] not something we do in a worship service
[17:54] though that's fine
[17:56] certainly would praise him and worship
[17:58] him when the lord moves or when the word
[18:00] goes forth but we can't produce
[18:04] what praise for him should reflect
[18:07] only he can do that with our lives
[18:11] something that's reflected in us when he
[18:13] takes us positions us and reflects
[18:16] himself in us that we might be a living
[18:18] epistle
[18:20] right of all men
[18:21] our life praises him
[18:25] psalm 146 while i yet live
[18:28] will i praise him you know as we go
[18:30] through these chapters about
[18:32] what
[18:33] praise
[18:35] looks like there's little clues about
[18:37] how we can live how we can praise while
[18:40] we live how we can be in continuous
[18:43] praise
[18:45] it says in verse 3 of psalm 146 put not
[18:49] your trust in princes
[18:51] powerful influential men
[18:55] nor in the son of man
[18:57] in any flesh not even in yourself
[19:00] in whom there is no help
[19:04] you know continuous praise can't happen
[19:08] unless you
[19:09] get your eyes off of the leading of the
[19:11] flesh
[19:12] the leading of man following where they
[19:14] would have you go
[19:16] listening to those voices not going down
[19:19] the roads reflecting the images they
[19:21] would have you reflect you can't even
[19:23] begin to live a life of praise
[19:25] to be in continuous praise so long as
[19:28] that is what you're following after
[19:31] it says in verse in fact it says in
[19:33] verse 9 the way of the wicked he turneth
[19:36] upside down do we not live in an upside
[19:39] down age
[19:40] amen
[19:42] but it says in verse 5 happy is he that
[19:44] hath the god of jacob for his help
[19:48] whose hope
[19:49] is in the lord
[19:51] his god
[19:53] continuous praise can't happen
[19:56] until first you set aside all those
[19:58] other leadings all those other voices
[20:00] even your own flesh
[20:02] and put your hope
[20:05] totally in the hands of the lord that he
[20:08] might make you
[20:10] lead you
[20:11] direct you as he
[20:14] sees fit
[20:15] then you can begin to reflect something
[20:18] then you can begin to become that
[20:20] continuous praise
[20:22] that he's looking for
[20:26] it causes our lives to utter something
[20:29] to reflect something that's an image of
[20:31] him
[20:34] so if you want to know what continuous
[20:36] praise looks like while i live
[20:39] will i praise him
[20:42] psalm 146 gives us a little bit of a
[20:44] clue of what that looks like
[20:46] i don't know about you but there's i
[20:48] want to make sure that the praise that i
[20:50] offer him
[20:51] is something that reflects him
[20:54] and not my little attempt
[20:56] at reacting to something that he has
[20:58] done for me and the only way that can
[21:00] happen
[21:01] is by committing myself completely
[21:04] into him
[21:05] as my hope
[21:07] not any princes not any son of man
[21:09] but him alone so as we read psalm 146
[21:13] this morning
[21:14] you know what greater praise could any
[21:16] of us offer
[21:17] than to be put in his hands and let him
[21:20] make us
[21:21] the image that reflects himself that
[21:23] while we live
[21:25] we will praise him let's read psalm 146
[21:28] together
[21:29] praise ye the lord
[21:30] praise the lord o my soul
[21:33] while i live will i praise the lord i
[21:36] will sing praises unto my god while i
[21:38] have any being
[21:40] put not your trust in princes nor in the
[21:43] son of man in whom there is no help his
[21:46] breath goeth forth he returneth to his
[21:49] earth in that very day his thoughts
[21:51] perish
[21:52] happy is he that hath the god of jacob
[21:55] for his help whose hope is in the lord
[21:58] his god which made heaven and earth the
[22:01] sea and all that therein is which
[22:03] keepeth truth forever which executed the
[22:06] judgment for the oppressed which giveth
[22:09] food to the hungry the lord loses the
[22:12] prisoners the lord openeth the eyes of
[22:14] the blind the lord raiseth them that are
[22:17] bowed down the lord loveth the righteous
[22:20] the lord preserveth the strangers he
[22:23] relieveth the fatherless and widowed but
[22:25] the way of the wicked he turneth upside
[22:28] down the lord shall reign forever even
[22:31] thy god o zion unto all generations
[22:34] praise ye the lord
[22:38] the r amen let's just sing that song

[46:26] doesn't have anything to do with my
[46:28] announcement
[46:30] but we are going to be reading out a
[46:32] choosing of a bride so
[46:36] i felt
[46:37] a little
[46:39] funny when i was reading all the quotes
[46:42] and i thought well you know
[46:44] but i didn't plan it that way and they
[46:46] didn't plan it that way so god's got a
[46:49] lot of things that
[46:51] marvelous a lot of people asked me with
[46:53] our last service
[46:55] did i know there was nine candles there
[46:58] and i didn't
[46:59] that was just all inspiration i just
[47:02] didn't know and in fact i was shocked
[47:06] and even more shocking i was shocked i
[47:08] got all nine of them in there
[47:11] i certainly hope as you we will read
[47:14] that the natural
[47:15] types the spiritual and uh
[47:19] that's our desire is in it certainly
[47:21] have all those gifts that god gave us
[47:25] his spirit is a gift
[47:28] to us you know
[47:29] and um
[47:31] to think that
[47:35] those i was
[47:36] amazed when i thought about that
[47:38] scripture
[47:39] when it said against such
[47:42] there is no law
[47:44] you know there's a lot of things you
[47:45] can't do
[47:46] you just can't walk into any place that
[47:49] you want to right you can't drive as
[47:52] fast as you want to
[47:54] um
[47:55] there's everything that is regulated you
[47:58] know you
[47:59] in fact your body can't even eat as much
[48:02] as you want to
[48:04] you know i've sat there were as full as
[48:06] a tick
[48:07] i couldn't get one more ounce of food in
[48:10] me
[48:11] and the law was i'm filled up
[48:14] but it looks so good and i just want one
[48:17] more taste i mean there's laws that
[48:19] govern things
[48:20] but these gifts
[48:22] any place anytime
[48:24] anywhere
[48:25] and they'll do for you exceedingly and
[48:28] abundantly
[48:29] above
[48:30] what we could
[48:31] even
[48:32] begin to
[48:35] ask or thank
[48:37] we're going to
[48:39] minister a little bit this morning i
[48:41] guess if i would
[48:43] i would have a
[48:45] title
[48:47] i would call it the morning after
[48:50] the morning after this is the morning
[48:52] after
[48:54] christmas
[48:55] and i'm sure that there's
[48:57] all kinds of different thoughts going
[48:59] through our heads the things we've got
[49:02] the things that
[49:04] we have to make decisions about
[49:07] i had to make some decisions whether
[49:09] certain things fit or not
[49:12] you know or whether i liked them or not
[49:16] and
[49:16] and how to do it and so
[49:19] we're we're talking this morning on
[49:22] the morning after
[49:24] and kind of as a subtitle
[49:28] we're reading from the message called
[49:31] choosing a bride
[49:33] but
[49:34] really
[49:35] from our standpoint
[49:37] it's choosing a husband
[49:40] choosing a husband
[49:43] that we don't
[49:46] realize that
[49:48] i could also had many quotes that i
[49:51] wanted to read
[49:53] out of leadership
[49:55] what brother branham talks about uh
[49:58] how that we're led and and what choices
[50:01] we have to make so let's stand in our
[50:04] morning and take our bibles
[50:06] and
[50:10] let's turn over to first kings
[50:14] or
[50:15] uh
[50:15] let's read joshua this morning first and
[50:18] then we'll sit down and read that
[50:21] later
[50:22] um
[50:24] and this is joshua the 24th chapter
[50:28] and the 14th verse
[50:32] joshua
[50:35] 24
[50:36] and
[50:37] 4
[50:39] 24
[50:40] and 14 we'll be reading
[50:43] from this morning
[50:45] it says
[50:47] now therefore
[50:49] fear the lord
[50:51] what's the beginning of wisdom
[50:54] fear of the lord
[50:56] amen and and we hope we can maybe tie
[50:59] that in a little bit if the lord would
[51:01] lead us that way
[51:04] now therefore fear the lord
[51:07] and serve him in sincerity
[51:10] and in truth
[51:12] and put away the gods
[51:15] which your father served
[51:18] on the other side of the flood
[51:21] and
[51:22] in egypt
[51:24] and serve ye
[51:26] the lord
[51:28] and if it seem evil
[51:31] un
[51:32] to you
[51:33] to serve the lord choose ye
[51:37] this
[51:38] day
[51:39] whom ye will serve
[51:42] whether
[51:43] the gods
[51:44] which your father served
[51:47] that were on the other side of the flood
[51:51] or the gods of the amorites
[51:54] in whoms land ye dwell
[51:57] but as for me and my house
[52:00] we
[52:01] will serve
[52:02] the lord amen god bless you
[52:06] this morning
[52:08] may be seated
[52:14] you know this being the morning
[52:17] after
[52:19] christmas
[52:20] i began to sit back and and begin to
[52:24] think
[52:25] of
[52:26] how many morning afters
[52:29] there were
[52:31] in the scripture
[52:34] some of the morning afters
[52:36] were great
[52:37] and some of them not so great
[52:40] i always wondered what it must have felt
[52:44] the morning after
[52:47] adam made his choice
[52:49] and found him
[52:51] outside
[52:53] the garden
[52:56] you know that morning after
[52:58] must have
[53:02] dwelled in his mind
[53:04] and as he
[53:07] thought over
[53:08] his
[53:09] decision
[53:11] and
[53:13] i'm sure that
[53:15] there
[53:16] must have been in his heart
[53:22] maybe regrets
[53:24] you know that
[53:26] but he knew he had to go on
[53:30] you know and and i i believe that that
[53:32] must have been a hard morning after
[53:36] because he reflected back
[53:39] on the decision
[53:41] that
[53:43] he'd made
[53:45] and he knew that he couldn't
[53:49] change it
[53:50] now
[53:52] he knew that the discipline he had made
[53:54] he had made and
[53:56] and and we don't want to reflect on all
[53:59] the reasons he made that decision and
[54:01] how that god was going to allow his
[54:05] plan to unfold but i want to reflect
[54:08] more on the human side
[54:10] the the the
[54:13] uh the emotions that
[54:16] and the
[54:17] struggles and uh the dwelling
[54:21] and the
[54:23] pondering
[54:25] that
[54:26] goes on within us
[54:28] so much
[54:29] we go through sometimes seasons
[54:32] of it
[54:33] before that we can recover
[54:36] and accept the things that
[54:39] the way they are
[54:41] and set our course
[54:44] you know i always loved the definition
[54:47] that our messenger gave us
[54:50] when he said that correction
[54:53] is not punishment
[54:55] it's to adjust the course
[54:59] in which that you're going to travel
[55:03] many times you know will finally
[55:07] break down you know men aren't very good
[55:09] at taking directions i'm sure all of you
[55:12] wives realize that by now
[55:15] but you know we will open something up
[55:17] and we'll look at it and try to start
[55:19] putting it together before we decide to
[55:22] read the instructions
[55:24] and then when we finally sit down and
[55:26] read the instructions the
[55:29] instructions correct us
[55:32] and therefore we have to change our
[55:34] course or the direction that we're going
[55:37] in or many times we have to go back to
[55:40] the step
[55:41] that we uh so geniusly
[55:45] left out
[55:47] so you know correction is never
[55:50] punishment
[55:52] the punishment
[55:54] usually comes
[55:56] as the result
[55:58] of the choice
[56:01] the mental suffering the emotional
[56:04] suffering
[56:05] uh
[56:06] the regret
[56:08] you know sometimes i believe that regret
[56:12] is a terrible punishment
[56:16] to sit back and to realize that
[56:19] that there's nothing you can do
[56:22] to redo
[56:24] and and that's one great uh struggle
[56:28] that we all have in life
[56:31] is that we can't redo a lot of the
[56:34] things
[56:35] that we've done
[56:37] and that's important because you don't
[56:40] need to look back
[56:42] on those things
[56:44] you don't need to look back on the on on
[56:47] those things but
[56:48] uh i i think of these uh morning afters
[56:53] and
[56:54] and how that these
[56:56] individuals must have looked back on
[56:59] what they had
[57:01] uh just done
[57:03] and and they're they're stuck in that
[57:06] place of of uh
[57:08] pondering it and uh uh the great what if
[57:13] and or
[57:14] could have been
[57:16] you know i i think those are words that
[57:19] because of calvary
[57:21] that we don't have to have in our
[57:23] vocabulary anymore
[57:26] you know
[57:27] and because you can't change a lot of
[57:30] things but god can change things for us
[57:33] that that's what's wonderful
[57:35] you know i i there's i could if i ever
[57:38] started looking back
[57:39] at the choices i've made and the things
[57:42] that i've said
[57:43] and all that i how my life could have
[57:46] been what i thought it might have been
[57:48] in everything you'll end up into a vast
[57:51] realm of confusion
[57:55] and and i that's what's so beautiful
[57:58] about the blood
[58:00] and about the wonderful thing that the
[58:03] lord jesus did for us at calvary because
[58:06] he took all our regrets and all our
[58:09] things and he threw him in the sea
[58:12] of god's forgetfulness to be
[58:15] remembered no more
[58:17] you know i read in when brother branham
[58:19] was speaking in a message that he
[58:22] preached
[58:23] he called it experiences
[58:26] and he was
[58:27] talking about a time that
[58:31] he was going through a great time in his
[58:34] life
[58:35] and he was uh traveling with brother
[58:37] bosworth at that time
[58:39] brother brosworth was in his seventies
[58:42] and
[58:43] and uh he uh
[58:45] and he preached divine healing uh before
[58:49] brother branham preached divine healing
[58:52] and and i'd like to say this right here
[58:56] is that
[58:58] you know
[59:01] the word of god doesn't require us to to
[59:05] bestow any greater honor on a prophet
[59:09] than that which god bestowed
[59:13] and a prophet is a prophet because god
[59:16] made him to be a prophet and he had
[59:19] something that he wanted to
[59:23] bring to that prophet and say through
[59:26] that prophet
[59:28] and
[59:29] and
[59:30] a lot of times people
[59:33] uh they stumble
[59:35] i i was surprised how many people
[59:38] stumbled
[59:39] because they found out that charles
[59:42] larkin
[59:44] laid down the history of the church ages
[59:50] you know
[59:51] and and and they they have they have
[59:54] such a
[59:55] misconception
[59:57] of what a prophet is they have such a
[1:00:01] misunderstanding and brother brahma he
[1:00:04] he he expresses it
[1:00:07] right out he said i studied many men
[1:00:10] i took their truths
[1:00:13] i studied scofield
[1:00:16] you know and some things he had right
[1:00:19] and some things he didn't
[1:00:22] and
[1:00:22] people are are stumbled
[1:00:25] because brother branham used uh
[1:00:28] many of the
[1:00:30] teachings that
[1:00:33] men had on the pyramids
[1:00:36] before he came along all the truths
[1:00:38] about the pyramid are factual
[1:00:41] mathematical historical truths
[1:00:46] you know and and and when we preach and
[1:00:49] the inspiration comes thoughts come into
[1:00:52] our mind things that we've heard things
[1:00:55] that we've read we don't sit back and
[1:00:58] say uh such and such said this on the
[1:01:02] the the sermon you you know
[1:01:06] many times how many knows who said
[1:01:10] we don't know
[1:01:11] what tomorrow holds but we know who
[1:01:15] holds tomorrow
[1:01:20] who said that
[1:01:23] who's the first guy to say that
[1:01:27] am i going to research and research and
[1:01:30] research and come up with who the
[1:01:33] original person was that said it right
[1:01:36] and every time i want to express that
[1:01:39] thought that i have to lay a footnote
[1:01:42] down
[1:01:44] and said nostradami said that
[1:01:49] or sir savio dolly
[1:01:54] those are our all great
[1:01:57] demon possessed people
[1:02:02] you know
[1:02:03] you don't
[1:02:04] you know what i'm saying so when you're
[1:02:06] in the inspiration that's the historical
[1:02:09] side of it
[1:02:10] is is not
[1:02:13] the message
[1:02:15] of it
[1:02:16] so when brother brown saw the church
[1:02:18] ages he saw the church ages he knew he
[1:02:21] could his revelation was the two spirits
[1:02:24] coming up through the framework of the
[1:02:26] church
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:29] and that's what he was
[1:02:32] showing us in our day
[1:02:34] is the history of the two spirits
[1:02:37] working through the framework of the
[1:02:40] church because there's two spirits
[1:02:42] working in the framework of the church
[1:02:44] we saw here in the reading in joshua
[1:02:47] there was two spirits working in the
[1:02:49] framework of the church and and and
[1:02:53] there there had to be a decision made
[1:02:57] and so he he he used the he used many of
[1:03:00] the things that larkman says because
[1:03:02] they were true
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:06] he took many of the teachings on
[1:03:08] justification that came out from
[1:03:14] martin luther
[1:03:15] because they were
[1:03:17] truth
[1:03:19] wesley spoke truth
[1:03:21] there's a lot of people that speak truth
[1:03:25] and it's truth i've heard
[1:03:28] like we talked at the young people
[1:03:29] there's a lot of people that are
[1:03:31] inspired they have a gift
[1:03:34] they write songs that inspire you
[1:03:37] you know i remember when i was in a
[1:03:39] valley one time and i that song came out
[1:03:42] i know the master of the sea
[1:03:45] you know that was like like david
[1:03:47] playing a psalm
[1:03:50] to me it comforted my spirit and so
[1:03:53] brother brown brought forth these uh
[1:03:55] the the history of of uh the the church
[1:03:59] ages and he used larkin's think but
[1:04:02] larkman didn't say that one was wesley
[1:04:04] and martin and all things he said i went
[1:04:06] and chose the messengers for each one of
[1:04:10] these ages
[1:04:13] and i i'm surprised that
[1:04:16] that people are moved by those things
[1:04:21] you know that
[1:04:23] they try to figure out how the cloud got
[1:04:26] there and
[1:04:27] and and and they go back and and what
[1:04:30] they can't understand is they get caught
[1:04:34] in the trap of reasoning
[1:04:37] nothing that god does
[1:04:39] reasons out with man
[1:04:42] the only thing when it's supernatural
[1:04:46] the only thing that it reasons out with
[1:04:49] with the believer is the seed that's in
[1:04:53] them
[1:04:57] and that's why the church is built on
[1:05:00] revelation and it's built on
[1:05:03] faith
[1:05:04] and faith is a revelation okay you know
[1:05:07] if not
[1:05:08] you'll get stumbled because now you're
[1:05:11] trying to put it together
[1:05:13] in your mind with your thinking and you
[1:05:17] become a god unto yourself so you choose
[1:05:21] basically
[1:05:22] uh
[1:05:23] something that's going to husband
[1:05:26] you know what husband tree is don't you
[1:05:29] husband tree is the nurturing and
[1:05:32] growing and feeding to bring forth a
[1:05:35] fruit so they choose what's going to
[1:05:38] nurture them what's going to
[1:05:40] give them husbandry
[1:05:43] what's going to develop them
[1:05:47] so like we're saying this morning
[1:05:50] choosing a husband you you choose what
[1:05:53] is going to
[1:05:55] influence you
[1:05:57] and what is going to lead you
[1:06:00] and that's why there was statements that
[1:06:02] i was going to read out of leadership
[1:06:06] because
[1:06:08] decisions lead you
[1:06:13] every decision has a morning after
[1:06:21] every decision if i could say this has a
[1:06:24] result
[1:06:26] it's got a morning after
[1:06:30] you know i've told many people don't do
[1:06:33] it
[1:06:36] and for the next 50 minutes
[1:06:39] them explained to me why they're going
[1:06:42] to do it
[1:06:46] and i say really
[1:06:52] i've taken dreams that people have come
[1:06:55] to me with and line them up in the row
[1:06:58] showed them every dream which i believe
[1:07:00] was god
[1:07:01] and showed them which way it was
[1:07:03] pointing them and they just make a
[1:07:05] decision
[1:07:08] and they have a morning after
[1:07:12] well the morning after is not the end of
[1:07:14] your life
[1:07:18] it's the beginning of your restoration
[1:07:25] so brother branham was talking about
[1:07:28] how that
[1:07:31] on the field with brother bosworth
[1:07:33] brother bosworth could preach and pray
[1:07:35] for the sick and hold up
[1:07:38] and brother branham
[1:07:40] couldn't you've heard him tell the
[1:07:43] stories after four or five discernments
[1:07:46] that he would
[1:07:48] he would
[1:07:50] just be
[1:07:51] done
[1:07:52] and he couldn't hold up
[1:07:54] okay yes he was
[1:07:56] as we know it forced his body
[1:07:59] into a nervous breakdown because nervous
[1:08:03] breakdown is not the same thing as a
[1:08:05] mental breakdown
[1:08:07] you understand a nervous breakdown is
[1:08:09] when your nervous system is fatigued
[1:08:14] can you understand and you
[1:08:16] and it it just
[1:08:18] fatigued i don't believe brother random
[1:08:20] ever had a mental
[1:08:22] breakdown
[1:08:24] he was fatigued
[1:08:26] in his body and he wore his nervous
[1:08:29] system out and anybody that is spiritual
[1:08:34] is a nervous person
[1:08:37] because the weight
[1:08:39] of the choices you make weighs on you
[1:08:42] heavy
[1:08:44] uh
[1:08:45] in our little small congregation that we
[1:08:48] have and i'll tell you
[1:08:50] arc were blessed
[1:08:53] we really are we don't we i we don't
[1:08:56] have a lot of major problems i'm
[1:08:59] trusting there's no gossiping going on
[1:09:03] you know if you can tell it to somebody
[1:09:05] else you ought to be able to tell it to
[1:09:07] me
[1:09:10] and and our sisters you know and and uh
[1:09:14] i'm i'm just as plain as can be usually
[1:09:17] that's where the trouble is and and i
[1:09:19] know our african sisters and some of our
[1:09:22] cultures are a little more prone to
[1:09:25] share things and talk things and that's
[1:09:27] why i say that in in christ there's
[1:09:30] neither bond or free
[1:09:32] june or greek male or female american or
[1:09:36] african or anything because we're all
[1:09:38] christ and christ is god and we all come
[1:09:41] under the same absolute amen
[1:09:46] but sometimes we're prone to things but
[1:09:48] anyway so brother brahms going through
[1:09:50] this and he
[1:09:52] he just wore out
[1:09:55] he's he's nervously shot
[1:09:57] and he said i slipped out of the
[1:10:00] house and i didn't tell my loved ones
[1:10:06] but i was going out
[1:10:09] and i was contemplating
[1:10:12] on taking my life
[1:10:16] and then it meant he goes on to explain
[1:10:18] later about coming out of that
[1:10:20] inspiration and the thing he said when i
[1:10:22] finally got to it i got out there and i
[1:10:25] began to to pray about it and and
[1:10:28] everything connect he
[1:10:31] gives a great
[1:10:32] thing about
[1:10:34] what god's gift
[1:10:36] to him was
[1:10:37] that he had a gift
[1:10:40] but there was another gift
[1:10:42] that he had and that's what held them
[1:10:46] and and comforted them and later on of
[1:10:49] course we know at the losing of sharon
[1:10:51] rose that that same gift come
[1:10:54] and comfort them
[1:10:56] so we're talking about
[1:10:58] morning afters
[1:11:00] and i wonder what cain's morning after
[1:11:03] was
[1:11:06] after he had
[1:11:09] killed abel
[1:11:11] he had a chance
[1:11:14] to do something different
[1:11:19] but he had a morning after
[1:11:22] just think of the morning after the
[1:11:25] choice that he made
[1:11:28] in killing
[1:11:32] abel
[1:11:34] you say boy this sounds like a
[1:11:35] depressing message this don't sound very
[1:11:38] christmasy
[1:11:42] but truth is always a gift
[1:11:48] because what sets you free
[1:11:51] the truth sets you free
[1:11:54] truth is freedom
[1:11:56] if you will look
[1:11:57] truth in the eye
[1:12:01] it will speak back to you yes sir
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:06] and then you come to the place
[1:12:09] of
[1:12:10] decision
[1:12:12] think of in the days of noah
[1:12:16] the morning after the first raindrop
[1:12:20] fell
[1:12:23] and for the first time it had rained for
[1:12:27] 24 hours
[1:12:28] and the water was this tall
[1:12:33] and they looked around how many you
[1:12:36] think ran over to bass pro shop and
[1:12:38] bought boats
[1:12:41] they hewed out everything they could hew
[1:12:43] out they built rafts because it just
[1:12:46] might have been a possibility that that
[1:12:49] old kook
[1:12:50] in that floating farmhouse over there
[1:12:53] was right
[1:12:56] think of the morning after
[1:13:00] what i think what might even be more
[1:13:02] striking is the morning before
[1:13:07] because it was before the morning
[1:13:11] choice that gave them the morning after
[1:13:15] that they're having
[1:13:21] the morning after always comes
[1:13:24] from the day before
[1:13:28] because sometimes we're stuck
[1:13:30] with the morning after
[1:13:33] because we
[1:13:34] didn't do due diligence
[1:13:39] on the day before
[1:13:42] just think of
[1:13:44] moses
[1:13:47] the morning after
[1:13:49] the death angel
[1:13:51] passed through the land
[1:13:55] i i love that scene
[1:13:58] in the ten commandments
[1:14:02] where ramesses finally comes back and he
[1:14:05] sits on the throne
[1:14:07] and his wife chides them because
[1:14:11] he
[1:14:12] claimed to be a god
[1:14:15] and they believe their pharaohs are god
[1:14:18] and he had claimed to be the god he was
[1:14:21] sitting there his nation was ripped out
[1:14:24] from under him egypt was never to rise
[1:14:28] again
[1:14:29] it was over
[1:14:34] and he sat there and he makes this great
[1:14:36] statement
[1:14:38] moses is god
[1:14:40] is god
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:46] he went to all his gods and his gods
[1:14:49] couldn't do nothing and finally he come
[1:14:52] to that great place in his life he said
[1:14:54] moses is god is god
[1:14:57] but look at all the opportunities that
[1:15:00] he had had the day before
[1:15:02] so that he wouldn't have had to had that
[1:15:05] morning after
[1:15:11] think of uh
[1:15:14] of uh
[1:15:16] the children of
[1:15:19] egypt children of israel
[1:15:22] that day you know a lot of people had to
[1:15:24] make a choice
[1:15:26] not every
[1:15:27] israelite came out
[1:15:31] but also many egyptians came out
[1:15:35] because it was the morning after
[1:15:37] something that god had done
[1:15:40] and the morning after brought a new
[1:15:44] set of choices
[1:15:49] do you understand that this morning the
[1:15:52] day before caused the condition caused
[1:15:55] the morning after but the morning after
[1:15:58] left a new set
[1:16:01] of choices
[1:16:06] like those leopards that were there can
[1:16:08] then they say why sit here we and die
[1:16:15] let's go out you know if
[1:16:17] it came when they got there the whole
[1:16:19] camp was gone
[1:16:21] they they became some of the richest men
[1:16:24] in all of uh israel
[1:16:30] look you know
[1:16:32] why why sit we here
[1:16:36] and so the the we we look at that we
[1:16:40] look at him at mount sinai
[1:16:44] the morning after
[1:16:47] moses came down from the mountain
[1:16:53] oh
[1:16:56] that golden calf didn't look so good all
[1:16:58] of a sudden
[1:17:00] i love again work it says
[1:17:03] moses is shining and they they got him
[1:17:05] shining they said moses has seen god
[1:17:09] just think it was the day before
[1:17:12] that caused the morning after
[1:17:14] but they didn't have to stay there did
[1:17:16] they
[1:17:20] moses drew the law
[1:17:22] the
[1:17:23] the
[1:17:23] the line in the sand
[1:17:27] and now they couldn't do nothing about
[1:17:30] where they'd been or what they'd been
[1:17:32] through
[1:17:33] but now lied before them
[1:17:37] a choice of path
[1:17:44] and we know how that
[1:17:48] it
[1:17:49] lies before
[1:17:51] let's turn in our scriptures
[1:17:55] if we could over the kings
[1:18:07] we're going to read
[1:18:08] in the 18th chapter
[1:18:11] and the 20th verse
[1:18:19] but in the 17th chapter
[1:18:23] there's a story
[1:18:25] of a little lady
[1:18:27] and her son
[1:18:29] and there was great famine
[1:18:31] in the land
[1:18:34] and the day before
[1:18:38] she had
[1:18:39] finally taken
[1:18:42] all the meal
[1:18:44] and oil
[1:18:45] left but for one cake
[1:18:50] so
[1:18:51] the day before created the morning after
[1:18:56] and what lied before her was i'm gonna
[1:18:59] go eat this cake
[1:19:01] and i'm gonna lay down me and my son and
[1:19:04] we're gonna die
[1:19:07] but you know something
[1:19:09] the morning after presented a
[1:19:12] new
[1:19:13] opportunity
[1:19:15] for a new
[1:19:16] direction because a voice rang out
[1:19:20] bring me something to eat
[1:19:25] can she had a choice
[1:19:34] and he said you bring me a cake and let
[1:19:36] me eat
[1:19:37] and the cruce won't run dry
[1:19:41] and
[1:19:42] the barrel
[1:19:45] won't run empty
[1:19:48] and she was stuck there with a a great
[1:19:51] decision
[1:19:53] a great choice to make
[1:19:55] now that choice was either
[1:19:58] you know
[1:19:59] that opportunity there was going to
[1:20:02] change what the morning after would be
[1:20:07] so there would have been a morning after
[1:20:10] of death or a morning after of life
[1:20:18] but the day before had only presented
[1:20:21] her
[1:20:22] with one
[1:20:27] and if she would have dwelled
[1:20:29] in that place
[1:20:33] in that mindset
[1:20:36] in that thinking
[1:20:40] but the morning
[1:20:42] brought her a new opportunity
[1:20:47] and that's what i love about the lord
[1:20:49] you may have had some bad morning afters
[1:20:54] but it's not the end of the matter
[1:20:59] and we read here
[1:21:10] and we know this great story the story
[1:21:12] of mount carmel
[1:21:14] so ahab sent unto all the children of
[1:21:17] israel
[1:21:19] and gathered the prophets together
[1:21:22] unto mount carmel i stood on mount
[1:21:24] carmel
[1:21:26] and i looked over the valley
[1:21:28] i could imagine
[1:21:30] what it looked like
[1:21:33] and what
[1:21:34] the scene is
[1:21:36] and i i i thought they've got a great
[1:21:39] monastery up there you know the
[1:21:41] catholics have gone and claimed every
[1:21:43] spot
[1:21:45] but you know but they don't really know
[1:21:47] the spot
[1:21:48] right
[1:21:49] it's just that
[1:21:51] constantine's wife
[1:21:52] had dreams and they built all the
[1:21:55] all the sites based on the dreams and
[1:21:58] and and you go on on to mount dalgoth
[1:22:02] and there's a great big gigantic
[1:22:04] cathedral sits up there
[1:22:07] and they have a little altar built up
[1:22:10] over this little niche
[1:22:12] in the rock where they said they set the
[1:22:16] the
[1:22:18] crucifix in
[1:22:21] the cross in
[1:22:22] and they have this great altar there
[1:22:25] and the priests are there selling
[1:22:27] candles
[1:22:30] and then you light the candle i don't
[1:22:32] didn't like the candle i lit enough of
[1:22:35] my candles in fact i lit enough candles
[1:22:38] at one time for my whole lifetime so
[1:22:41] uh
[1:22:41] if you know my testimony to it
[1:22:44] so
[1:22:45] anyway and and so you they light this
[1:22:48] candle and they walk up and they put it
[1:22:50] in this little sand tub i think sister
[1:22:54] rebecca you've seen that haven't you
[1:22:55] there
[1:22:56] and
[1:22:58] and then they get down on their knees
[1:23:00] and they crawl over and they kiss
[1:23:03] this little plastic plate
[1:23:08] and then they they count and after about
[1:23:12] 25 30 people go they take those candles
[1:23:15] and they put them out and
[1:23:17] they start selling them again
[1:23:22] you know
[1:23:23] i just think of
[1:23:27] what a terrible end
[1:23:28] yes sir
[1:23:30] but we see
[1:23:31] what he says here he says and he
[1:23:33] gathered all the people together on
[1:23:36] mount carmel
[1:23:37] and elijah came unto all the people
[1:23:41] saying how long halt ye
[1:23:44] between two opinions
[1:23:51] but if baal
[1:23:54] but if baal
[1:23:55] then follow him
[1:23:59] and the people answered him
[1:24:01] not
[1:24:02] a word
[1:24:06] you know a halting between two opinions
[1:24:08] i think is one of the greatest
[1:24:11] definitions of being lukewarm
[1:24:17] doesn't settle it
[1:24:21] nothing settled
[1:24:24] when you're lukewarm
[1:24:26] sure
[1:24:29] i want to say that again nothing settled
[1:24:33] when you're lukewarm
[1:24:38] it's a terrible state
[1:24:41] to be in
[1:24:44] the lord despised that state so much
[1:24:50] that he said either be hot or cold
[1:24:54] in other words choose one opinion or the
[1:24:57] other but don't stay halted between two
[1:25:01] opinions
[1:25:02] if it's evil to you
[1:25:04] to serve
[1:25:06] god
[1:25:08] then
[1:25:09] choose the god of your fathers
[1:25:14] if it if it's righteous for you
[1:25:17] then serve the lord
[1:25:20] but look at these people
[1:25:22] and the people answered not a word
[1:25:28] what do you think their morning after
[1:25:30] was
[1:25:33] when the 400 prophets wailed and cut on
[1:25:36] themselves
[1:25:39] when everybody had bowed a knee
[1:25:42] think of all the morning after of all
[1:25:45] the people that bowed a knee
[1:25:48] to the religious system
[1:25:53] that was ruling the land in that day
[1:25:58] think of their morning after
[1:26:02] when the
[1:26:03] true word of god
[1:26:05] was vindicated
[1:26:09] i wouldn't have liked to been
[1:26:11] at that morning after
[1:26:17] the children of
[1:26:20] israel
[1:26:22] how do you think about the morning after
[1:26:24] katie sparnia
[1:26:28] two guys had a good morning after
[1:26:34] and their morning after
[1:26:38] wasn't the end of their journey
[1:26:42] they remained strong all the way until
[1:26:45] the end let's just take one more
[1:26:48] this morning
[1:26:50] of a morning after
[1:26:56] how about rahab
[1:27:00] what do you think her morning after was
[1:27:02] like
[1:27:04] she had the most expensive piece of real
[1:27:06] estate
[1:27:11] in all of jericho
[1:27:17] everything else was rubble
[1:27:20] think about her morning after
[1:27:25] now look at her day before
[1:27:32] she had a terrible day before
[1:27:37] but she made a decision
[1:27:42] and her decision changed
[1:27:45] her morning after
[1:27:49] because we know there's a law that you
[1:27:51] reap what you sow
[1:27:59] i just could imagine
[1:28:04] i mean you ever see where what her
[1:28:05] morning after led to
[1:28:08] who she married and
[1:28:10] who come from that
[1:28:12] seed
[1:28:13] that lineage seed oh wouldn't we just go
[1:28:16] into a great bible study of the type of
[1:28:18] the bride and eve and how the seed was
[1:28:20] passed down and all those ladies in the
[1:28:23] scriptures and what they typed
[1:28:28] see
[1:28:29] what morning after are you living in
[1:28:37] because
[1:28:40] her morning after
[1:28:42] was
[1:28:43] something else
[1:28:46] but every event
[1:28:50] transpired because of the choices
[1:28:54] that were
[1:28:56] taken
[1:28:58] i'd like to read
[1:29:00] to you the definition
[1:29:04] of choice
[1:29:08] brother graham says choice is an
[1:29:10] unwritten law
[1:29:12] in every human being
[1:29:16] sometimes we take
[1:29:18] predestination
[1:29:20] and we misunderstand it
[1:29:23] the footsteps of the righteous are led
[1:29:26] by the lord
[1:29:29] okay but the choice is made
[1:29:35] how many people have we seen that were
[1:29:37] led of the lord had great ministries and
[1:29:39] then
[1:29:40] that they are arrived at a question
[1:29:44] or a decision
[1:29:48] and
[1:29:48] the decision that they made change their
[1:29:51] day after
[1:29:54] so your day after may be blessed
[1:29:57] your day may after may be miserable
[1:30:03] but that doesn't mean it's the end of
[1:30:06] your choice
[1:30:11] here's what choice means
[1:30:13] an act
[1:30:14] of selecting
[1:30:18] or making a decision
[1:30:21] when faced with two or more
[1:30:24] possibilities
[1:30:29] and my dictionary
[1:30:31] has in parenthesis the choice between
[1:30:34] good
[1:30:36] and evil
[1:30:38] i thought are you kidding me
[1:30:41] i don't even know webster was a
[1:30:42] christian
[1:30:47] two possibilities
[1:30:49] your morning after holds two
[1:30:52] possibilities
[1:30:54] it holds the possibility of returning
[1:30:58] or going forward
[1:31:02] whether it's good
[1:31:03] or whether it's bad
[1:31:06] if you've made decisions that have
[1:31:09] caused you heartache that have messed
[1:31:11] your life up
[1:31:13] that were bad financial decisions or
[1:31:15] whatever you can stay right there and
[1:31:19] live in that
[1:31:22] or you might consider another
[1:31:25] possibility
[1:31:30] because my god says all things are
[1:31:32] possible
[1:31:34] yes sir
[1:31:39] and when brother brennan had to consider
[1:31:41] that possibility are you you think
[1:31:43] brother branham a prophet of god sat
[1:31:44] there and had to decide whether he was
[1:31:47] going to live
[1:31:49] or die
[1:31:55] i mean you wouldn't even think that he
[1:31:57] would be at such a place like that
[1:32:02] but he faced a morning after the morning
[1:32:05] after he had just prayed for the sick
[1:32:07] kim the devil was
[1:32:09] speaking to him and the depression that
[1:32:12] he went through you don't think the
[1:32:14] prophet of god didn't go through
[1:32:15] depression yeah he went through
[1:32:17] depression he went through a lot of
[1:32:19] depression it comes with the gift either
[1:32:21] choose the gift or chews a door
[1:32:25] but it comes with it and as for me and
[1:32:28] my house we'll serve god
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:34] that brother ran through he said oh the
[1:32:37] depression was just caused by the gift
[1:32:42] he came to that understanding he says
[1:32:44] but i got another gift it's him and it's
[1:32:48] the gift of life
[1:32:53] oh i made a
[1:32:54] i remember one time that
[1:32:57] i i had an opportunity to cut
[1:33:00] a road in
[1:33:01] to a logging camp
[1:33:04] this was back in 1970
[1:33:10] one i believe
[1:33:12] or two
[1:33:14] a lot of you weren't born there
[1:33:20] and it was gonna pay
[1:33:22] two thousand dollars
[1:33:26] and i could do it in one sunday
[1:33:32] and i remember
[1:33:36] i chose
[1:33:37] to make a decision
[1:33:40] i chose to go to church
[1:33:45] i've never had a pair of
[1:33:48] tires ever wear out since
[1:33:50] i'm not saying i hadn't changed them
[1:33:53] all right
[1:33:55] but i got
[1:33:57] 80 000
[1:34:00] miles on 40 000 mile tires
[1:34:04] i put mitchum's on attack that lasted me
[1:34:07] three four
[1:34:09] five years
[1:34:11] i always credited that
[1:34:14] to that decision
[1:34:17] how so many things in my life had lasted
[1:34:20] longer
[1:34:21] than they were supposed to last
[1:34:24] well over any of the money i'd ever make
[1:34:26] i'm glad i didn't have the monday after
[1:34:29] that sunday
[1:34:35] but it's a it's a decision
[1:34:39] that
[1:34:40] you make
[1:34:43] and i want to just read because
[1:34:45] sometimes we we get to the place that we
[1:34:48] don't think we have to make decisions
[1:34:53] we just think well
[1:34:55] the
[1:34:56] the lord would have
[1:34:59] is it should have taken care of this and
[1:35:01] he should have taken care of that
[1:35:03] no
[1:35:07] it's who
[1:35:09] what are you going to choose
[1:35:11] to husband you
[1:35:17] you understand customers just not a
[1:35:19] companion to make children
[1:35:24] that's the most adult way that i can say
[1:35:26] it
[1:35:29] it's just going to nurture you
[1:35:32] who's going to
[1:35:33] give you well-being
[1:35:36] who's going to uh uh
[1:35:39] dig up the roots and after and
[1:35:42] and and
[1:35:44] uh
[1:35:45] fresh soil and and and and nutrients in
[1:35:48] there that it brings forth much fruit
[1:35:54] what what oh who you what are you gonna
[1:35:56] choose
[1:35:58] to
[1:35:59] uh
[1:36:00] and pick
[1:36:01] to
[1:36:02] mold
[1:36:03] your
[1:36:05] tomorrow
[1:36:11] because you have to have a today
[1:36:14] and a decision today in order to produce
[1:36:18] the results in the morning we read some
[1:36:20] stories of some awful mornings we could
[1:36:23] read a lot of stories of some wonderful
[1:36:25] mornings
[1:36:29] i wonder what the morning after lazarus
[1:36:31] coming from the grave was like
[1:36:33] i wonder what the morning after for that
[1:36:35] leopard that came back
[1:36:37] and fell at jesus feet and worshiped
[1:36:40] them
[1:36:42] all ten leopards had a mourning after
[1:36:47] the others went back and showed
[1:36:49] themselves to the priest
[1:36:51] and went back home clean
[1:36:55] they may have never testified
[1:36:58] of the lord
[1:37:02] that would not been a good morning after
[1:37:05] for me but it was still a morning after
[1:37:08] a good thing
[1:37:11] but that morning still
[1:37:14] gave them
[1:37:16] a choice
[1:37:18] and that one leopard's morning after
[1:37:22] brought him back to the feet of jesus
[1:37:27] and said lord
[1:37:29] thank you
[1:37:33] i always wondered if he was one of the
[1:37:34] ones in the upper room
[1:37:39] i put him there
[1:37:40] in my heart
[1:37:43] i looked at the boy that was healed
[1:37:46] when he was blind
[1:37:49] and he looks at me he says you being the
[1:37:51] fathers of israel
[1:37:53] and know not who healed me
[1:37:57] and jesus sought him out i always
[1:37:59] believed he was in the upper end
[1:38:02] i believe we can go to the upper room
[1:38:06] don't you
[1:38:07] but you've always got choices
[1:38:11] and that's what we're talking about this
[1:38:13] morning
[1:38:14] is choice
[1:38:17] you can make a choice
[1:38:18] and not have a morning after
[1:38:21] or you can make a choice the morning
[1:38:24] after to change your next
[1:38:27] morning after
[1:38:31] many hours i've spent on my knees
[1:38:33] repenting
[1:38:36] telling god i was sorry
[1:38:39] many at times i promised him i'd never
[1:38:42] do it again
[1:38:44] and find myself
[1:38:47] back at the same place
[1:38:48] at another morning after
[1:38:52] but at every morning after
[1:38:58] there's another morning coming
[1:39:01] and the decisions of that time
[1:39:06] will create the morning after
[1:39:10] and wouldn't you like to have morning
[1:39:12] after
[1:39:13] morning after
[1:39:14] morning after in him
[1:39:17] and wouldn't you want to know in your
[1:39:20] heart if you have a morning after
[1:39:23] that is full of regret and
[1:39:24] disappointment
[1:39:26] that that doesn't have to be your next
[1:39:28] morning after
[1:39:32] it doesn't have to be the morning after
[1:39:34] for the rest of your life
[1:39:37] that
[1:39:38] morning after does not have to be your
[1:39:42] husband all right
[1:39:44] thank you lord
[1:39:46] and if though any of you who have
[1:39:48] studied marriage in divorce
[1:39:51] you know it's exactly what the prophet
[1:39:53] taught he said that husband has got to
[1:39:56] die
[1:39:57] you can't let him be the one that's
[1:40:00] going to continually
[1:40:03] nurture your thoughts your spirit your
[1:40:07] experience your joy
[1:40:11] you can't let that morning after
[1:40:14] what do you think judas's morning after
[1:40:16] was like
[1:40:20] there's a song i like
[1:40:23] and it's called
[1:40:24] judas didn't know
[1:40:29] and in the words that song goes is that
[1:40:31] he would have forgiven him
[1:40:33] yes
[1:40:34] that's right that he loved him
[1:40:39] he would have received them
[1:40:42] and took him in again
[1:40:44] but
[1:40:45] judas didn't know
[1:40:49] his morning after
[1:40:51] led to him hanging himself
[1:40:55] because he was the son of perdition
[1:40:59] and he didn't believe
[1:41:03] that a morning after could exist that's
[1:41:06] greater than the morning he's in
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:12] hallelujah
[1:41:14] i'm so glad that there's another morning
[1:41:17] coming in in my this life here and i'm
[1:41:21] so glad there's another morning coming
[1:41:23] amen
[1:41:26] yes sir
[1:41:28] oh that's the morning that we live for
[1:41:31] look
[1:41:32] what i i want to say if you say
[1:41:34] birmingham this sounds like a new year's
[1:41:37] message well this is the morning after
[1:41:39] christmas
[1:41:41] and the only thing that lies before you
[1:41:43] is a new year
[1:41:47] is tomorrow morning
[1:41:52] so it's the choices you make today
[1:41:55] that are going to produce
[1:41:57] that
[1:41:58] tomorrow morning
[1:42:01] that's why the prophet of god said don't
[1:42:03] let it pass you by
[1:42:10] i want to just read a little bit and
[1:42:12] we'll close because there's no service
[1:42:15] this evening
[1:42:17] there's no service wednesday night
[1:42:20] the next choice you have to make
[1:42:24] as far as i'm concerned
[1:42:27] is on new year's
[1:42:29] eve
[1:42:30] next sunday service is at also at 11
[1:42:34] o'clock
[1:42:37] the choice is yours
[1:42:42] now choosing a bride
[1:42:44] i want to just read you a few statements
[1:42:46] now about choice
[1:42:48] the selection
[1:42:53] when faced in making a decision
[1:42:56] when faced with two or more
[1:42:59] possibilities
[1:43:02] choice is the decision made when facing
[1:43:06] two or more
[1:43:08] possibilities i've got two possibilities
[1:43:14] coming to me
[1:43:17] i can stay home
[1:43:20] or i can
[1:43:22] go to
[1:43:23] the service
[1:43:26] or i could go out and have dinner
[1:43:28] or i could go to the company party or i
[1:43:31] could do this or i could do that
[1:43:33] it's a decision
[1:43:36] it's a selection or a decision between
[1:43:40] two or more options
[1:43:46] wouldn't it be wonderful when we can get
[1:43:48] to the place that we narrow our options
[1:43:52] down to nothing other than the word of
[1:43:55] god
[1:43:56] not how i feel
[1:43:58] not what i'm going through
[1:44:03] but what the word of god said
[1:44:08] the decision to go forward despite how
[1:44:11] you feel
[1:44:13] despite your emotional makeup
[1:44:16] you know one of the hardest things for a
[1:44:18] preacher to do is stand at the post of
[1:44:20] his duty and preach the gospel when he's
[1:44:22] had a terrible day before
[1:44:26] and his morning
[1:44:29] after
[1:44:31] isn't so good
[1:44:34] he don't feel like preaching
[1:44:37] he knows he shouldn't be preaching he
[1:44:39] feels terrible he's condemned
[1:44:42] he just wants to run away from it all
[1:44:44] is miserable
[1:44:46] he doesn't he just looks at he's got a
[1:44:48] whole bucket load of excuses
[1:44:52] and that god says you can't use any of
[1:44:54] them
[1:44:58] my grace is sufficient for you
[1:45:00] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:45:03] and then you want to come do you want to
[1:45:05] come over here you're feeling terrible
[1:45:07] you're run down and you say well you
[1:45:09] know
[1:45:10] i can preach
[1:45:13] the people love me and okay and
[1:45:16] you know i'm pretty good and
[1:45:19] you know i've studied a long time and
[1:45:21] i know a lot of things that brother
[1:45:22] brown said on the tape
[1:45:25] and you can't use that either
[1:45:28] you're stuck right where brother branham
[1:45:29] was stuck
[1:45:30] he gave me a gift
[1:45:32] the blood
[1:45:34] if i meet him there he forgives me of
[1:45:36] all my unrighteousness
[1:45:40] i can have a new
[1:45:42] morning
[1:45:44] in him
[1:45:47] and when you walk out that door you
[1:45:49] leave
[1:45:51] and get yourself out of the way you get
[1:45:54] your miserable self out of the way you
[1:45:56] get your good self out of the way you
[1:45:59] get your gifts out of the way you get
[1:46:01] everything out of the way and you anchor
[1:46:04] yourself in one thing and one thing
[1:46:06] alone and that's god's eternal word
[1:46:11] heaven and earth will pass away but this
[1:46:14] word will not pass away
[1:46:17] you don't need no recognition you don't
[1:46:20] need no data boys you don't care if you
[1:46:22] get criticized you know one thing i've
[1:46:25] said what he said
[1:46:29] and it'll stand
[1:46:31] and it'll create for me
[1:46:34] a new morning
[1:46:39] praise the after
[1:46:40] if not you'll die
[1:46:43] you'll die
[1:46:49] oh i just i want to close but i i could
[1:46:52] go over into birth pains right now what
[1:46:55] he talked about the choice they all had
[1:46:57] to make between the two systems
[1:47:01] you know every day
[1:47:03] you're faced
[1:47:05] with two systems
[1:47:08] i don't know if i brought it
[1:47:10] yeah i did i'm going to read it anyway
[1:47:12] you don't have nothing to do but go open
[1:47:14] all the christmas gifts you couldn't
[1:47:17] open up yesterday because you got so
[1:47:18] many of them
[1:47:24] you know who had the christmas don't you
[1:47:27] walmart
[1:47:29] that's who had the christmas yeah
[1:47:32] yeah if you think that you think you had
[1:47:34] a christmas
[1:47:37] costco and walmart had real christmases
[1:47:42] of course you know what they got the
[1:47:43] morning after coming don't they
[1:47:46] when all that stuff that doesn't fit
[1:47:49] comes pouring back in and all the stuff
[1:47:52] that's broke just remember for every
[1:47:54] morning there's a morning after
[1:48:08] all right he said these men if they
[1:48:10] picked this
[1:48:12] and this is paragraph 175 in burke
[1:48:15] paints
[1:48:17] these men if they pick up this
[1:48:19] and it goes out with it
[1:48:22] they can make more sense of it see
[1:48:24] to bring it to a place you would i just
[1:48:27] want to lay this seed
[1:48:30] then hope they make it come to life
[1:48:34] he says in paragraph 74 it's always been
[1:48:37] that way
[1:48:39] that the reason she
[1:48:42] is bearing birth pains because there's a
[1:48:45] fight in her
[1:48:46] he's talking about the church
[1:48:49] right
[1:48:50] he's also talking about the individual
[1:48:55] there's a fight in you between the two
[1:48:57] husbands
[1:49:01] you understand that
[1:49:02] the husband of the old man
[1:49:05] the husband of your emotions the husband
[1:49:07] of your feelings the husbands of your
[1:49:09] regret the husbands of your
[1:49:11] consciousness
[1:49:17] but he made a choice
[1:49:19] in choosing a bride
[1:49:22] and he chose the miserable person that
[1:49:25] we are
[1:49:27] but the choice was his
[1:49:29] it was his choice of the place of
[1:49:31] worship it was his choice
[1:49:34] now we have a choice
[1:49:37] to choose what's going to rule over us
[1:49:40] the morning after
[1:49:43] or the morning that could come
[1:49:50] i choose
[1:49:53] the morning
[1:49:54] to come
[1:49:58] and i don't mean just tomorrow morning
[1:50:02] i mean the morning
[1:50:04] that's to come
[1:50:09] and i want everything that husbands
[1:50:12] my life
[1:50:14] every decision i make between two
[1:50:17] options
[1:50:20] to be made by the husband
[1:50:23] of my morning
[1:50:28] leave those things which are behind
[1:50:31] behind
[1:50:32] and press
[1:50:34] for the higher calling
[1:50:35] prophet of god said you cannot drive in
[1:50:38] a rear view mirror that's right yeah
[1:50:45] if we confess our sins
[1:50:47] he's just
[1:50:49] and faithful
[1:50:50] to forgive them
[1:50:55] when you compare
[1:50:57] your mourning
[1:50:59] against the blood
[1:51:02] your mourning loses every time because
[1:51:05] what he did for you
[1:51:08] that you could have a new morning
[1:51:11] surely out does what created the morning
[1:51:14] you're in
[1:51:20] there's always been the reason she's
[1:51:22] bearing birth pains because there's a
[1:51:24] fight in him
[1:51:25] there's an esau just a man of the world
[1:51:28] very religious
[1:51:29] and oh he's all right good fellow clean
[1:51:32] moral
[1:51:33] as far as i know of but he don't know
[1:51:36] nothing about that birthright
[1:51:41] think of his warning after
[1:51:44] when he sold
[1:51:46] his birthright
[1:51:48] think of jacob's
[1:51:50] morning after
[1:51:52] when he was a rat
[1:51:54] but he had the birthright oh
[1:51:57] hallelujah
[1:52:02] oh
[1:52:04] i love him
[1:52:08] the word must
[1:52:10] deliver
[1:52:12] that word bride church
[1:52:15] the word must deliver that word bright
[1:52:18] church
[1:52:20] if you're in a bad morning
[1:52:23] the word must deliver that word bride
[1:52:28] church
[1:52:38] where am i at
[1:52:43] all right he says inject and this is
[1:52:45] paragraph 146 and jacob i don't care
[1:52:48] what he is he wants that birthright
[1:52:51] he's the spiritual one
[1:52:55] he said and and
[1:52:56] then them to
[1:52:59] today is in the womb of the church
[1:53:02] there's a great big system trying to be
[1:53:05] formed called the world council of
[1:53:07] churches
[1:53:08] and from the womb
[1:53:10] of the church is coming forth to
[1:53:13] children
[1:53:14] it's just mark my word
[1:53:18] the world
[1:53:20] the word must deliver the word bright
[1:53:22] church
[1:53:24] the church has to be delivered out of
[1:53:27] her
[1:53:28] the bride for christ
[1:53:30] them that fell asleep in all ages will
[1:53:33] make up that bride that comes out on the
[1:53:36] word
[1:53:38] they that they come out on
[1:53:42] like from your feet coming forth to the
[1:53:44] head
[1:53:45] she it's a it gets greater
[1:53:48] and the more
[1:53:49] you have to have and so forth
[1:53:53] as the body grows up so does the body of
[1:53:56] christ grow up and then finally the head
[1:53:59] will come into it
[1:54:01] the head of it
[1:54:03] will now if you notice
[1:54:06] because it's
[1:54:07] all linked to the head
[1:54:10] the head does the turning
[1:54:12] pulling
[1:54:14] who's the head
[1:54:17] the husband
[1:54:19] what's pulling and turning you
[1:54:23] yesterday's failure
[1:54:26] your complex
[1:54:29] you don't like what you see in the
[1:54:30] mirror
[1:54:38] well there's a million doctors out there
[1:54:39] they'll stuff you with
[1:54:41] shots and everything you want
[1:54:45] and i'm not against it
[1:54:49] that's great
[1:54:50] to give you more self-confidence make
[1:54:52] you happy that's great
[1:54:56] but i couldn't even imagine myself
[1:54:58] without this big shnoj
[1:55:03] i got so used to looking at it the
[1:55:05] prophet of god said said think vice
[1:55:07] versa
[1:55:08] i just look in the mirror and say man
[1:55:10] it's a beautiful nose
[1:55:12] everybody's jealous that they don't got
[1:55:14] one like fun
[1:55:17] don't worry opinion's like a nose
[1:55:19] everybody has one
[1:55:24] the head of it will now if we notice
[1:55:27] because it's all linked together the
[1:55:29] head does the turning pulling
[1:55:31] but these systems will not grow out of
[1:55:34] that
[1:55:37] okay the systems will never grow out of
[1:55:40] the morning that they created
[1:55:47] oh i hope this is striking personal
[1:55:51] because we've got to decide now
[1:55:54] what we're going to be in the future
[1:55:57] what kind of person we're going to be
[1:55:59] what kind of church we're going to be
[1:56:01] what kind of dedication we're going to
[1:56:02] have
[1:56:03] because i
[1:56:04] the one thing that this virus did
[1:56:07] is it created a huge amount of lukewarm
[1:56:12] people
[1:56:13] and gave them an excuse
[1:56:19] and the word of god says he who chooses
[1:56:22] his life shall lose it
[1:56:24] but he who lays down his life shall save
[1:56:27] it
[1:56:32] you read into that whatever you want
[1:56:37] he says the systems can't grow out of
[1:56:39] that because it's a system and it cannot
[1:56:42] bring forth a cuckleburg cannot bring
[1:56:44] forth a bunch of wheat
[1:56:47] but they both in the same field
[1:56:50] watered by the same water and the same
[1:56:53] sunlight one is the word one is not the
[1:56:57] word
[1:56:58] and them two are fighting and they've
[1:57:01] been fighting since the first
[1:57:03] reformation and they're still fighting
[1:57:06] where did the first battle start
[1:57:08] it started in the mind they're still
[1:57:11] fighting the battle still going on
[1:57:15] but your mind does not create
[1:57:19] your tomorrow
[1:57:21] if you let the word create the tomorrow
[1:57:27] if we went through every prophecy
[1:57:30] that the seventh angel the angel of uh
[1:57:34] a messenger of malachi 4 5 the prophet
[1:57:37] of malachi 4 5 the the message
[1:57:40] of the 7th church age messenger the
[1:57:43] fulfillment of revelations 10 7 and all
[1:57:46] them scriptures were fulfilled in a
[1:57:48] chosen man called william mary and
[1:57:51] branham if we went through all the
[1:57:53] prophecies it would take us a year to
[1:57:55] get through them
[1:58:05] now i don't have to go any further on
[1:58:07] that
[1:58:10] you know what i'm talking about
[1:58:12] yes sir there we are
[1:58:14] there you are a system what system
[1:58:18] are you
[1:58:19] in
[1:58:24] what morning are you living in
[1:58:28] i don't care if you got drunk last night
[1:58:34] you don't have to remain a drunk
[1:58:38] i don't care if you smoked a cigarette
[1:58:41] you don't have to smoke another
[1:58:46] i don't care what you lusted at i don't
[1:58:48] care what you failed at i don't care you
[1:58:50] may have a terrible morning this morning
[1:58:53] because of your yesterday's choice
[1:58:56] but there's a system
[1:58:59] called the word of god
[1:59:02] that delivers people
[1:59:04] from bad mornings
[1:59:10] what system are you in
[1:59:13] are you in the system that's going to
[1:59:16] create another miserable tomorrow
[1:59:23] or are you going to create a new morning
[1:59:26] one
[1:59:27] morning
[1:59:29] at a time amen
[1:59:33] very good
[1:59:35] that's what he said
[1:59:36] take no thought of tomorrow
[1:59:39] the evil of today is sufficient thereof
[1:59:43] now let me
[1:59:45] lay
[1:59:47] the light on that
[1:59:48] is in the context of what we're talking
[1:59:50] about
[1:59:51] make the right choices today tomorrow
[1:59:54] will take care of itself
[1:59:57] it didn't say not to plan it didn't say
[2:00:00] not to plant your potatoes it didn't say
[2:00:02] not to make a life choice or a decision
[2:00:06] there's lots of choices in life
[2:00:10] but you don't have to let the evil
[2:00:15] that's with you on this morning
[2:00:20] create
[2:00:21] the next morning
[2:00:23] for you
[2:00:28] he said just imagine now
[2:00:31] if you had lived back
[2:00:34] in the other days
[2:00:37] under the jolt
[2:00:39] of god's prophets
[2:00:41] and words
[2:00:42] that come forth
[2:00:44] what side would you want to be on
[2:00:48] back there
[2:00:53] oh isn't that aren't these books
[2:00:54] wonderful
[2:00:56] these sermons
[2:00:57] they're so packed
[2:01:01] sometimes we just read them in one light
[2:01:03] and we don't understand that this is the
[2:01:06] i am the light that cometh down i am the
[2:01:08] bread that cometh down from heaven
[2:01:11] amen in the beginning was the word and
[2:01:13] the words with god and the word was the
[2:01:15] light
[2:01:16] of men
[2:01:17] the light of the morning the light of
[2:01:19] the new morning
[2:01:24] well you've got the same choice today
[2:01:28] she's fixing to bring port
[2:01:30] the perfect word back there
[2:01:32] and that word is coming forth
[2:01:35] the word bride
[2:01:37] a woman is part of the man
[2:01:39] taken from him
[2:01:41] so the church will have to be a word
[2:01:43] abiding church
[2:01:45] every word of the bible no systems no
[2:01:49] darkness nothing added to it
[2:01:52] it'll have to be in
[2:01:54] an unadulterated pure
[2:01:56] virgin word
[2:01:59] and let's close this morning
[2:02:03] and
[2:02:04] go go to choosing of the bride
[2:02:06] paragraph 31.
[2:02:09] so you say what are you telling us
[2:02:11] i'm telling you
[2:02:13] your choices
[2:02:15] can change your morning
[2:02:20] i know one thing that i've got to make a
[2:02:22] choice of
[2:02:23] and that's
[2:02:24] turn off the world
[2:02:28] turn off its politics turn off its
[2:02:30] thinking
[2:02:31] turn off
[2:02:32] all the stuff that bothers me
[2:02:38] because it eats me up and it makes me
[2:02:41] mad and people don't make godly
[2:02:43] decisions
[2:02:45] but i know there's one thing that i can
[2:02:47] let influence my day
[2:02:51] and it ain't that five dollars and 25
[2:02:53] cents on the gas pump
[2:02:56] it's god promised he'd never let his
[2:03:00] children beg bread
[2:03:06] now what's gonna husband tree my
[2:03:08] thoughts
[2:03:13] it's all the devil
[2:03:15] all these people who thinks fox news is
[2:03:18] the angel of god sent down to save
[2:03:21] america
[2:03:22] you know what i mean yeah
[2:03:24] you know all that is is good cat
[2:03:27] cop bad cop
[2:03:29] the whole purpose of it was to throw you
[2:03:31] in jail one way or the other
[2:03:36] don't
[2:03:37] we've got an infallible
[2:03:40] unadulterated guide
[2:03:45] that if we could put this thinking
[2:03:48] in our thinking let this mind be in you
[2:03:52] that was in christ jesus you know what
[2:03:54] this message is it's the mind of god for
[2:03:58] the age we're living in
[2:04:02] amen
[2:04:03] end the story
[2:04:08] we
[2:04:13] there are many things of life
[2:04:16] we are given a choice
[2:04:20] the way of life
[2:04:22] itself
[2:04:23] is a choice
[2:04:25] we have a right to make our own way
[2:04:28] choose our own way
[2:04:30] that we want to live
[2:04:33] education is a choice
[2:04:35] we can choose whether we're going to be
[2:04:37] educated or whether we are not going to
[2:04:40] be educated that's a choice
[2:04:44] that we have
[2:04:46] right and wrong is a choice
[2:04:48] every man every woman boy and girl has
[2:04:52] to choose whether they're going to try
[2:04:55] to live right or not live right it's a
[2:04:58] choice
[2:05:00] choice is a great thing
[2:05:02] your eternal destination is a choice
[2:05:06] and maybe tonight some of you will make
[2:05:09] the choice of whether you'll spend
[2:05:12] eternity
[2:05:14] before this service ends tonight
[2:05:17] there will be one time
[2:05:19] that if you turn god down
[2:05:22] many time
[2:05:23] there will be one time you'll turn him
[2:05:26] down
[2:05:27] for the last time
[2:05:30] if you keep choosing
[2:05:32] the evil of your morning
[2:05:36] over the light of god's
[2:05:39] love and deliverance
[2:05:42] one morning you'll be trapped
[2:05:45] in that system
[2:05:52] he said
[2:05:53] it's a dangerous thing
[2:05:56] he said one
[2:05:58] one time you'll turn him down for the
[2:06:00] last time there is a line between mercy
[2:06:03] and judgment
[2:06:05] it's a dangerous thing for a man or a
[2:06:07] woman boy or girl to step across that
[2:06:10] line for there's no return when you step
[2:06:13] across
[2:06:14] that deadline so tonight it might be the
[2:06:18] time
[2:06:19] that many will make their decision
[2:06:23] where they will spend
[2:06:26] the endless eternity
[2:06:28] there's another choice we have to make
[2:06:30] in life
[2:06:32] that's a life companion
[2:06:35] a young man or woman stepping out
[2:06:38] on life
[2:06:39] has been given the right to make a
[2:06:42] choice
[2:06:43] the young man chooses the young woman
[2:06:46] has a right to accept or reject it
[2:06:50] but it's still a choice on both sides
[2:06:53] both man and woman they have the right
[2:06:57] to choose
[2:06:59] you you have a choice as a christian
[2:07:02] you have a choice of the church
[2:07:04] here in america so far
[2:07:09] that
[2:07:10] we can go to
[2:07:13] i don't like that so far
[2:07:17] that we can go to
[2:07:19] that's your own american privilege to
[2:07:22] choose any church you want to belong to
[2:07:25] that's a choice
[2:07:26] you don't have to go to any of them if
[2:07:29] you don't want to
[2:07:31] this is the first time in american
[2:07:32] history that americans have
[2:07:34] overwhelmingly chosen not to go to
[2:07:37] church
[2:07:39] there are more non-going church people
[2:07:42] in the united states than church-going
[2:07:44] people
[2:07:46] if you don't want to
[2:07:48] but if you want to
[2:07:52] change from the methodist to the baptist
[2:07:55] or the catholic to the protestant
[2:07:57] so forth there's nobody can tell you or
[2:08:00] make you come to any certain church
[2:08:04] that's our that's our freedom
[2:08:07] that's what our democracy is every man
[2:08:10] can choose for himself freedom of
[2:08:13] religion and that's a great thing god
[2:08:17] help us to keep it
[2:08:19] as long as we can
[2:08:22] we have a choice
[2:08:24] whether you choose this church you can
[2:08:27] choose whether
[2:08:28] it's this church whether you will choose
[2:08:31] a church that will guide you
[2:08:34] to your eternal destination
[2:08:37] you can choose a church
[2:08:38] that
[2:08:39] has a certain creed
[2:08:42] you might
[2:08:43] think that creed
[2:08:46] is just what you want
[2:08:48] or the other church has their creed
[2:08:51] and then there's the word of god
[2:08:54] you have a choice of
[2:08:55] you have to make the choice
[2:09:01] that's what god delights in
[2:09:04] so many times i hear that in brother
[2:09:06] mike's psalm reading god delights in the
[2:09:10] choices
[2:09:11] that you make
[2:09:13] that's how you worship him
[2:09:17] because he's your husband
[2:09:21] it's an unwritten law among us of
[2:09:24] choosing
[2:09:26] i believe it was elijah one time at
[2:09:27] mount carmel after the showdown to the
[2:09:30] great hour of the crisis we just
[2:09:33] about to come to right now
[2:09:36] perhaps it may be
[2:09:38] to you
[2:09:39] or i tonight
[2:09:42] that we make this choice
[2:09:44] like the mount carmel experience
[2:09:46] frankly i think it's going on worldwide
[2:09:50] now
[2:09:51] but there will soon be a time
[2:09:53] where that you'll have to make a choice
[2:09:56] and you men here your denominational
[2:09:59] churches just believe this
[2:10:02] that hour is right on you when you're
[2:10:05] going to make a choice
[2:10:08] you're either going to
[2:10:10] go into the world council of churches or
[2:10:12] you're not going into the to be a
[2:10:15] denomination anymore you're going to
[2:10:18] have to do that and that's the choice is
[2:10:21] coming soon
[2:10:23] he's bringing this choice to him
[2:10:25] but also we're talking about the choice
[2:10:27] you have to make for your individual
[2:10:29] life your spiritual being your spiritual
[2:10:33] atmosphere
[2:10:34] your spiritual food chain
[2:10:38] and what you want to create a union with
[2:10:41] which husband
[2:10:43] do you want
[2:10:45] and if you get the right husband in your
[2:10:47] individual life you'll get the right
[2:10:50] husband
[2:10:53] you're way ahead of me jeff you need to
[2:10:55] sit there and listen and give me time to
[2:10:57] get to where i'm going okay
[2:11:01] because that's i'm not talking about
[2:11:03] that carnal husband
[2:11:06] i'm talking about the one that's going
[2:11:08] to lead you tomorrow
[2:11:10] and feed you tomorrow
[2:11:12] and influence you tomorrow
[2:11:22] it's a dangerous thing to wait till that
[2:11:24] last hour
[2:11:26] two because you might
[2:11:28] take on something that you could never
[2:11:30] shake out of it
[2:11:35] now i'm applying that to what we're
[2:11:37] talking about you might take on
[2:11:39] something
[2:11:40] that you can never shake out of
[2:11:44] you'll take on a complex you'll take on
[2:11:47] a defeatist attitude you'll take on a
[2:11:50] failure attitude
[2:11:55] let's change our morning yes sir
[2:11:58] let's change our tomorrow morning this
[2:12:01] morning
[2:12:08] you won't be able to shake out of it you
[2:12:09] know there's a time when you
[2:12:12] can be warned then if you step across
[2:12:15] the line of warning then you already
[2:12:17] marked on the other side branded
[2:12:20] remember when the jubilee year come
[2:12:23] and the priest rode with his trumpet
[2:12:26] sounding that every slave could go free
[2:12:30] but if they refuse to accept their
[2:12:32] freedom
[2:12:34] then he had to be taken to the temple
[2:12:38] to a post
[2:12:39] and an awl bore through the ear
[2:12:43] and then he served his master always
[2:12:47] it was put
[2:12:48] on his ear as a type of hearing
[2:12:52] faith cometh by hearing
[2:12:55] he heard that trumpet but he didn't want
[2:12:58] to listen to it
[2:13:02] oh my
[2:13:04] god
[2:13:06] don't accept
[2:13:09] that
[2:13:14] you may be in year one
[2:13:17] of the seven
[2:13:21] you may have six more years to go
[2:13:24] if the lord tarries till that trumpet's
[2:13:27] prone
[2:13:29] but never
[2:13:31] accept
[2:13:33] anything
[2:13:35] condition
[2:13:36] failure
[2:13:37] negativity
[2:13:39] never accept anything
[2:13:45] you got a past
[2:13:47] caused you to do things god can make it
[2:13:50] fresh
[2:13:51] and new
[2:13:58] i don't remember
[2:14:00] where i'm at or the jubilee year don't
[2:14:02] listen to it
[2:14:04] he says elijah
[2:14:06] paragraph 44 elijah gave them a choice
[2:14:10] what they should choose you this day
[2:14:13] whom ye shall serve if it god be god
[2:14:17] serve him
[2:14:19] but if it's baal be god
[2:14:21] serve him
[2:14:23] and as we see that all the natural
[2:14:26] things is a type of the spiritual thing
[2:14:30] as we went through
[2:14:32] in our lesson this morning
[2:14:34] as the son
[2:14:37] and his
[2:14:38] nature that was my first bible
[2:14:42] before i ever read a page in the bible i
[2:14:45] knew god
[2:14:46] because the bible is written everywhere
[2:14:48] in nature
[2:14:50] and it just corresponds with the word of
[2:14:52] god how the death burial and
[2:14:55] resurrection of nature the sun rising
[2:14:58] crossing setting dying rising again
[2:15:00] there's so many things that we could
[2:15:03] type
[2:15:04] god in nature
[2:15:05] that we have to bypass for this message
[2:15:08] now it's spiritual the natural types the
[2:15:11] spiritual
[2:15:12] then the choosing of the bride in the
[2:15:15] natural is a type of the choosing of the
[2:15:19] bride in the spiritual let's finish with
[2:15:22] paragraph 51
[2:15:24] what i'm trying to emphasize this
[2:15:27] morning is choice
[2:15:30] people have got to the place they think
[2:15:32] predestination
[2:15:34] takes choice away
[2:15:37] and it doesn't
[2:15:43] and if we would study what we're doing
[2:15:47] when we're going
[2:15:48] to get married he's talking about
[2:15:50] marriage in this particular text but i
[2:15:53] believe i can take what he says here if
[2:15:56] we would study what we're doing
[2:16:00] when we're going to
[2:16:05] you can fill that blank in with
[2:16:06] everything sure
[2:16:10] when we choose our wife
[2:16:12] our husband
[2:16:14] if we study it over
[2:16:16] a man should pray earnestly for he could
[2:16:19] ruin his entire life
[2:16:21] remember the vow is until death do we
[2:16:24] part
[2:16:25] he could ruin his life by making the
[2:16:27] wrong choice
[2:16:28] but if we know
[2:16:30] knows what he's making the wrong choice
[2:16:34] and is marrying a woman
[2:16:37] and it's fit
[2:16:39] to be his wife
[2:16:40] he doesn't
[2:16:41] anymore
[2:16:43] then it's his fault
[2:16:45] if a woman takes a husband who knows
[2:16:48] that he's not fit to be a husband
[2:16:51] you know then it's your own fault
[2:16:54] after you know what's right and wrong
[2:16:56] so you shouldn't do it until you
[2:17:00] thoroughly prayed through
[2:17:03] the same applies to choosing a church
[2:17:06] now you must pray over the church that
[2:17:09] your fellowship in remember churches
[2:17:12] carry
[2:17:12] spirits now i don't want to be critical
[2:17:16] but i realize that i'm an old man
[2:17:18] and i've got to leave here
[2:17:20] one of these days
[2:17:22] and i've got to answer
[2:17:24] at the judgment day
[2:17:26] for what i say tonight or any other time
[2:17:29] and therefore i've got to be dead
[2:17:32] earnest and truly
[2:17:34] convicted
[2:17:37] we're not talking about marriage and
[2:17:38] divorce this morning
[2:17:41] we're not talking about choosing or
[2:17:45] not choosing a husband
[2:17:47] jenna has passed that
[2:17:49] threshold so you don't ever have to
[2:17:52] worry about those quotes ever again
[2:17:57] you know
[2:17:58] but some of you do
[2:18:00] have to to go through the process
[2:18:03] because we know the process brother tim
[2:18:05] and we're praying for the whole thing to
[2:18:07] go
[2:18:08] smooth
[2:18:10] but you've got a choice tomorrow
[2:18:14] you have a choice today of what your
[2:18:16] tomorrow is going to be
[2:18:20] are you going to choose him
[2:18:24] and let him guide you
[2:18:26] and help you
[2:18:32] out of
[2:18:33] your mourning
[2:18:40] you can make a terrible investment
[2:18:43] the stock market could crash
[2:18:45] you could lose all your money
[2:18:48] you have a choice of jumping out a
[2:18:50] window
[2:18:54] jumping off a bridge
[2:18:57] oh you don't think so sure
[2:19:01] go back and read the suicides on black
[2:19:03] friday
[2:19:06] people thought they lost everything
[2:19:10] but was it profit of the man if he gains
[2:19:12] the whole world and loses life
[2:19:16] god's gift to us is eternal life through
[2:19:19] christ jesus
[2:19:21] in other words if you're that seed
[2:19:24] and if you've made a bad morning
[2:19:27] he he's going to take you from that
[2:19:29] morning
[2:19:31] if you'll choose him
[2:19:33] to tape you
[2:19:37] choose a good morning
[2:19:39] good morning to you
[2:19:45] i really wonder what brother brennan
[2:19:46] meant when he stepped to the microphone
[2:19:49] and said good morning friends
[2:19:54] in other words you can change your
[2:19:55] morning
[2:19:57] many people didn't know they could
[2:20:00] rahab changed her morning
[2:20:03] noah changed his morning
[2:20:06] joshua and caleb changed their morning
[2:20:09] all kind daniel changed his morning
[2:20:14] you know it was one morning that put him
[2:20:16] in the lion's den
[2:20:20] but that same choice took him out of
[2:20:30] just think of
[2:20:32] of
[2:20:33] joseph
[2:20:36] he made a choice
[2:20:37] and it put him in prison
[2:20:40] but the same choice
[2:20:42] took him out of prison
[2:20:45] you don't have to remain in prison
[2:20:47] you don't have to be stuck
[2:20:50] that's a system
[2:20:55] it's a
[2:20:56] system that this world has developed
[2:21:00] to affect your emotions
[2:21:02] and your thinking
[2:21:05] i got notes written down here god of
[2:21:07] this evil age
[2:21:08] satan's eden
[2:21:11] wake up church the prophet of god said
[2:21:14] don't get caught in this age of
[2:21:17] reasoning
[2:21:22] don't get caught
[2:21:24] in satan convincing you
[2:21:27] that you cannot be delivered from a bad
[2:21:31] choice
[2:21:36] because
[2:21:38] there's a new day of coming
[2:21:41] there's a new morning at hand
[2:21:43] and i can have a new morning tomorrow
[2:21:47] i'm going to have a good day because
[2:21:50] it's good afternoon to you
[2:21:53] but let's have wonderful
[2:21:55] mornings
[2:21:56] let's stand together
[2:22:06] let us all
[2:22:11] take a look
[2:22:13] at our choices
[2:22:15] and
[2:22:16] in the morning after christmas
[2:22:20] when we just received and chose this as
[2:22:22] a memorial for the gift of jesus christ
[2:22:26] what are you going to do with what god
[2:22:28] gave you this morning
[2:22:32] i don't want to put it on a shelf
[2:22:38] but i want to take the isab
[2:22:41] that i might see
[2:22:44] i want to take gold trident fire and
[2:22:46] white raiment
[2:22:50] i want to choose to open the door this
[2:22:52] morning
[2:22:54] and let him come in and sup with me
[2:23:01] because i believe there's another
[2:23:03] morning coming soon
[2:23:06] and my choices on this morning
[2:23:10] are going to make that resurrection
[2:23:11] morning alive
[2:23:14] and then on the other side of that
[2:23:16] morning
[2:23:18] oh
[2:23:18] think of what that's going to be like
[2:23:21] running around like a young 20 year old
[2:23:24] fella
[2:23:28] greedy my sisters and my brothers and
[2:23:33] talking it over with paul and peter and
[2:23:38] say oh excuse me a moment brother i'm
[2:23:40] gonna run over and visit with moses
[2:23:44] [Music]
[2:23:46] oh and then we all go before our great
[2:23:49] husband
[2:23:52] and we'll lay down our crowns and
[2:23:55] worship him
[2:23:58] oh that sounds so beautiful to me
[2:24:04] this is a choosing of a husband
[2:24:11] a different morning after
[2:24:18] [Music]
[2:24:21] we
[2:24:22] honestly look at the message
[2:24:26] that god has given you
[2:24:29] and when you in your heart say i'm going
[2:24:31] to let this message
[2:24:34] this word
[2:24:37] this message that the lord jesus sent to
[2:24:39] me
[2:24:40] personally i'm going to let this message
[2:24:43] husband my life
[2:24:45] i'm going to be married to this word
[2:24:52] this is what
[2:24:53] i'm going to choose to make my morning
[2:25:01] and when i fail and
[2:25:03] the morning of failure comes
[2:25:06] i'm going to go back
[2:25:07] [Music]
[2:25:09] and say lord where can i go
[2:25:13] thou alone hath eternal life
[2:25:17] how do you think peter felt that morning
[2:25:21] when he denied the lord
[2:25:27] [Music]
[2:25:28] and the lord said do you love me peter
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:34] feed my sheep
[2:25:37] and he asked him again
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:40] and he asked him the third time
[2:25:43] and peter was grieved
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:47] he could have run from his presence
[2:25:52] he could have hung his head in shame
[2:25:56] he could have just laid it all down and
[2:26:00] went back
[2:26:03] to the sea of galilee and
[2:26:08] got his boat
[2:26:12] but he said lord
[2:26:15] you know all things
[2:26:17] you know that i love you
[2:26:20] and the lord changed his mourning
[2:26:24] forever
[2:26:27] [Music]
[2:26:30] lord i pray this morning that
[2:26:34] you don't have to be in sin
[2:26:37] maybe just a little lukewarm
[2:26:42] maybe not sold out
[2:26:46] maybe being halted between two opinions
[2:26:49] this morning
[2:26:51] which is the definition of lukewarm
[2:26:55] maybe you have decisions
[2:26:57] that are laid out before you
[2:27:01] and you've got to choose
[2:27:04] i say choose him
[2:27:07] choose the word
[2:27:13] talk it over with them
[2:27:16] let them reveal to you
[2:27:19] life
[2:27:20] and life more abundant
[2:27:23] because that choice always makes for a
[2:27:26] beautiful morning
[2:27:28] and that choice will make for a
[2:27:30] resurrection morning one day
[2:27:34] so lord that's our desire
[2:27:37] maybe down in your heart
[2:27:39] this morning
[2:27:42] no service this evening
[2:27:46] you would like to lift your hand and say
[2:27:48] lord i'd like to rededicate my life
[2:27:54] i want to change
[2:27:57] some of the mornings i have
[2:27:59] [Music]
[2:28:01] i can't do it lord
[2:28:04] but what i'm choosing today is not to
[2:28:07] let yesterday guide me
[2:28:12] i'm not going to let yesterday
[2:28:15] be what's going to make my tomorrow
[2:28:20] but i'm going to lift my hands to you
[2:28:22] today and say lord you know i need
[2:28:24] healing
[2:28:26] i don't even know how to beg you anymore
[2:28:29] lord for deliverance
[2:28:33] all i can say is help my unbelief
[2:28:37] lord i'm so weak i can hardly give it up
[2:28:40] i can hardly keep my face out of the
[2:28:42] computer lord god
[2:28:46] i don't want to have that feeling that
[2:28:49] morning
[2:28:51] i want a new morning lord jesus
[2:28:55] i don't have to be stuck
[2:28:57] with that kind of mourning
[2:29:00] lord you can change my mornings
[2:29:04] you can put
[2:29:05] joy
[2:29:07] and peace
[2:29:09] and rest
[2:29:11] in the time of confusion
[2:29:14] i'm giving myself to you this morning
[2:29:18] i'm rededicating my life this morning
[2:29:22] i'm gonna make choices for the right
[2:29:24] kind of mourning
[2:29:25] and you just lift your heart and your
[2:29:27] hands to him this morning
[2:29:30] and say lord i'm
[2:29:32] i'm gonna have a different
[2:29:34] morning after
[2:29:36] from this morning forward
[2:29:39] i'm going to change my mornings this
[2:29:42] morning

[2:29:49] to be a joyful day
[2:29:51] in my life

[2:29:55] i'm committing
[2:29:57] my morning
