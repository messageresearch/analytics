[16:29] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[16:31] Lord for the grace that you've shown us
[16:34] for the love that's been projected in
[16:36] this day Lord for the message that's
[16:39] called us out of sin and unbelief and
[16:41] has set us apart Lord to know what you
[16:44] want how to be pleasing to you father
[16:47] and for your spirit that makes it
[16:49] possible to live an overcoming life Lord
[16:53] we ask just you could continue to bless
[16:55] our pastories as a way our brother Billy
[16:58] as he ministered this morning and for
[17:00] all the saints that have gathered again
[17:01] once tonight father to Feast at your
[17:03] table Lord we're committing this service
[17:06] to you and no as man we wouldn't be able
[17:08] to break the bread of life father nor
[17:11] would we be able to multiply it but Lord
[17:13] you're the one who could go to each one
[17:15] in their heart and could speak words of
[17:17] life and Lord our desire is that you
[17:20] would do that now and we commit
[17:22] ourselves to you as unworthy as we are
[17:24] Lord but knowing that you've put a call
[17:26] in our life we ask that you would use it
[17:28] now minister to the needs of your people
[17:31] and we'll be careful to give you the
[17:32] glory and the honor in the name of our
[17:34] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[17:37] pray going to continue on where our
[17:40] precious brother Billy kind of
[17:41] ministered from this morning he he
[17:43] ministered on
[17:44] Grace and as I it was very it's very
[17:48] fitting for our age for the time we're
[17:50] at that the message that we're hearing
[17:52] is one of Grace one that's calling out
[17:54] Grace because that is as as it was in
[17:57] the book of Zechariah
[17:59] in the text that our brother took
[18:02] um it was that the headstone was crying
[18:05] Grace Grace as it came down so in
[18:07] Zechariah 4:7 we'll just read that again
[18:11] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[18:14] zerubabel that thou shalt become a plain
[18:17] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[18:20] therefore with shouting crying Grace
[18:22] Grace unto it and let's turn over to
[18:26] Revelations 22 and verse 17 there's a
[18:31] continuity that um I'm getting a a
[18:34] slight ring up here but that I'll I'll
[18:36] work through it I kind of have to
[18:38] remember I did it for 27 years and I
[18:41] never got it right so we appreciate
[18:44] everyone laboring in the back and their
[18:48] labor Revelations CH 22:1
[18:51] 17 would
[18:54] read the spirit and the bride say come I
[18:56] just need to go one more chapter
[19:00] thank you and the spirit and the bride
[19:02] say come and let him that heareth say
[19:05] come and let him that is a thirst come
[19:08] and whosoever will let him take of the
[19:11] water freely God bless you you may be
[19:17] seated the spirit and the
[19:19] bride are saying the same
[19:22] thing and it and it's it's quite fitting
[19:25] that in this day that we're living in uh
[19:28] is it's it's the Capstone which is
[19:30] coming down which is love which is Grace
[19:32] brother brandom says love and grace are
[19:34] the same thing but it's it's in the
[19:38] understanding of love and grace where
[19:40] there would probably actually be more of
[19:42] a disagreement around what love and
[19:44] grace actually is than you would realize
[19:47] um as the Bride of Jesus Christ we have
[19:50] an understanding of love and grace that
[19:52] the world does not have we don't have a
[19:55] petty love we don't have a petty Grace
[19:57] we don't take the grace of God and turn
[20:00] it into a disgrace but it's the love of
[20:02] God to Deliver us from sin it's the love
[20:05] of God to take us out of the condition
[20:06] that we're in and the set in Heavenly
[20:08] places in Christ Jesus so that is that
[20:12] is in direct contrast to what the world
[20:15] would would convey to be Lov and that's
[20:18] just come as you are just stay as you
[20:19] are God loves you the way you are and
[20:22] there's no power in it to deliver you
[20:25] that's right there's they turn the love
[20:27] of God into something dope
[20:29] and God loved us while we were in sin
[20:31] and trespass but he didn't leave us
[20:33] there he identified with us in our sin
[20:37] so that we could be clothed in his
[20:39] righteousness now I I love the the
[20:42] sermon this morning because Grace has a
[20:44] Char God's Grace has a characteristic
[20:47] that the that the world doesn't have
[20:49] God's grace does what you can't do okay
[20:53] so God's grace is one that does what you
[20:56] can't do where the grace almost in a
[20:59] worldly measure would say would turn the
[21:01] reasonable service that you have that
[21:04] you can submit yourselves and do things
[21:06] of the works of your own hands and then
[21:08] they would call those things that you
[21:10] can give yourself a religious sticker
[21:12] and a badge and say the Merit that
[21:14] you've earned is Grace it's the grace of
[21:16] God that you could perform the things
[21:19] that you by reasonable service and
[21:20] commitment can perform but there's a
[21:23] there's a travail that takes place in
[21:25] the heart of the believer there's a
[21:27] thirst for righteousness that that can't
[21:29] be satisfied by any measure of worldly
[21:32] Works any any measure of your own effort
[21:35] and I would say that some of us can do
[21:37] more than others after their ability but
[21:40] even as the Rich Young Ruler would be
[21:42] found in a place where he could say all
[21:44] that I've done I've kept from my youth
[21:46] I've done everything that I could do and
[21:49] I was able to perform it there the word
[21:51] had a way of coming down his his Lane
[21:54] calling his name and his address and say
[21:57] know where the lacking one was right so
[22:00] the none of us are righteous we have no
[22:02] righteousness of our own and if you're a
[22:04] Son of God that because he's going to
[22:06] correct you you're going to come to a
[22:08] place where your ability doesn't have
[22:11] the
[22:12] ability he he the law was to come to
[22:15] magnify your inability that's why when
[22:18] Jesus would come you would say uh
[22:20] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[22:22] after hath committed adultery with her
[22:24] already in his heart he says I didn't
[22:26] come to do away with the law I came to
[22:28] magnify the law you know if if your
[22:30] brother comes to you and has need of
[22:32] something you say go away he said he
[22:34] said and you don't minister to the needs
[22:37] right so there's this righteousness that
[22:39] God is calling for in us that I would
[22:41] say um if if we're honest with ourselves
[22:45] and we were to place our sins before us
[22:47] we'd say Lord I'm
[22:49] lacking that's right and that is uh the
[22:53] love of God to reveal to us that there
[22:57] is a lack
[22:59] lacking it takes a revelation of the
[23:01] lacking to truly repent I believe that
[23:03] that's that's in my heart because um as
[23:07] though there would be those who couldn't
[23:09] find a place of repentance I believe
[23:11] it's because God will accept even we
[23:13] heard it this morning I if it's true
[23:16] repentance God will accept it but true
[23:19] repentance takes a
[23:21] revelation that you need
[23:23] God and the word it exposes a lacking
[23:28] and it's because it's by
[23:30] Design I'm going to read uh this may be
[23:33] a little lengthy but I think it just
[23:35] brings continuity this is in God's only
[23:38] provided place of worship this is in 65
[23:40] November 12th uh to November the 28th in
[23:44] the
[23:45] morning and this is uh starting in
[23:49] 261 notice now when you are a son of God
[23:53] in the house of God you are a part of
[23:54] God's economy Romans 81 then there is no
[23:58] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[24:00] Jesus for they are dead to the world
[24:02] alive in him and living in the present
[24:05] day making the word that God has used
[24:09] them a for or foreordained them placing
[24:13] their name in The Bride book and when
[24:16] the waters come upon the seed that's in
[24:19] the heart raises it up to the bride of
[24:22] Christ oh my just perfect as it can be
[24:25] in every age it's been that way the
[24:27] Lutheran under justification the feet
[24:29] raised it like that Wesley under
[24:32] sanctification the Pentecostals under
[24:34] the arms the works and the deeds and so
[24:36] forth he's saying that that's in the
[24:38] arms and so forth had to be calvinist
[24:41] and it had to be Armenian had to be
[24:43] legalist but now we come to the Head the
[24:45] Capstone Grace Grace cap the Capstone
[24:49] cried The Headstone crying what Grace
[24:52] Grace pass from death and Creed into
[24:55] Living Word of the Living God God's only
[24:58] provid Ed plan for his age his sons in
[25:00] the word age quickened by the spirit
[25:04] like a spark that Lit off something make
[25:06] it alive and seated now in Heavenly
[25:09] places in present tense already alive
[25:12] and subject subject to every promise in
[25:15] the world word subject to every promise
[25:19] in the word I our pastor would say hey
[25:21] don't read this as condemnation read
[25:23] this as a promise when you see that the
[25:25] word calls you to something higher
[25:27] that's a promise that you can obtain to
[25:30] because you can reckon yourselves dead
[25:31] in Christ he you're you're dead in
[25:34] Christ and Alive resurrected sitting in
[25:36] now in Heavenly places in Christ
[25:41] Jesus the word age quick and spirit the
[25:44] spark the lid off something make you
[25:45] alive seated now in Heavenly places in
[25:49] present tense already alive subject to
[25:52] every promise in the word then what does
[25:55] that you being a part of God's Gene a
[25:58] part of the word other men a part of
[26:00] God's word seated together manifest the
[26:02] entire body of Christ because there's no
[26:05] leaven among
[26:07] you see what he's talking about brother
[26:10] Brown no leaven among you just the word
[26:12] only seated in Heavenly places in the
[26:15] door where he put his name Christ Jesus
[26:18] we'll just pause there for a second the
[26:21] the the thing that struck my heart and
[26:24] that I know that I have to be obedient
[26:25] to really is is is the part of
[26:28] leaven and that's because the word
[26:31] causes the challenge and we're not going
[26:33] to shy away because if the we're we're
[26:35] not ones that uh that are without
[26:40] hope we don't believe that this gospel
[26:42] is powerless but it's going to purge us
[26:46] thoroughly sir and we're going to be
[26:48] found in his
[26:50] righteousness the scripture that has
[26:52] been on my heart it's found in 1 John
[26:54] the 2 chapter and in the 15th verse and
[26:57] I'm going to take a a little piece of
[26:59] wisdom from we were in uh New Mexico in
[27:05] Espanola and I told the song leader that
[27:08] if he didn't call my wife out to to sing
[27:10] a song um that I would when when I got
[27:13] when I came out and I don't know exactly
[27:16] what the previous condition was but he
[27:17] got in trouble once for for calling
[27:19] someone up to sink so he couldn't do it
[27:21] and so he said well I just needed to let
[27:23] you know that your husband
[27:27] said that he would call you out if if if
[27:30] I didn't do it so I feel a lot more
[27:34] comfortable reading our
[27:35] Prophet I take this text speaking to the
[27:39] bride of Christ and let me say something
[27:41] to you brother and sister in 1 John the
[27:44] second chapter in the 15th verse we read
[27:46] it if you wish the Bible says if we love
[27:49] the world or the things of the world
[27:51] because the love of God is not even in
[27:53] us now the word there is not Earth it's
[27:57] the Greek or Cosmos which means the
[28:00] world order if we love the Fashions of
[28:03] the Earth the world if we love the trend
[28:05] of the day if we think this is a
[28:07] wonderful time oh we have all these
[28:10] things if you think that it's because
[28:13] your thinking is wrong it's perverted by
[28:15] the devil for if you love The World's
[28:18] order and the things of the present
[28:20] world so present world not the thing you
[28:24] know isn't the word amazing it didn't it
[28:27] it is spoken in such a way that it's a
[28:28] living word that there's a current world
[28:31] order there's a current way the world
[28:34] economy works but you're in God's
[28:37] economy and God could come very specific
[28:39] now and come down each of your aisles
[28:41] but if your love the world or the things
[28:44] of the world the love of God is not even
[28:47] in
[28:48] you remember that and he he goes on and
[28:52] and in this that's in the power of
[28:54] transformation brother brandham talks
[28:56] about the seed and how Satan would tried
[28:58] to to to kill it that he would just
[29:01] poison it the only he can't keep the
[29:02] seed from being there because it's a
[29:04] predestinated seed of God but what he
[29:06] can do we know the parable of the serwer
[29:08] he could try to choke it out with the
[29:10] cares of the world with the things of
[29:12] this life and he if if you're not being
[29:14] fruitful then there's a way that God can
[29:17] be the good husbandman he could come in
[29:19] he can break up the follow ground he can
[29:21] take out the rocks and a lot of times
[29:23] that is simply just the cares and the
[29:25] love of the world it's the and and
[29:28] that's the world order but that's also
[29:31] uh something personal to each of us
[29:33] things that the devil has a Punch coming
[29:35] maybe it's the the lust of the eye the
[29:37] lust of the flesh popularity the pride
[29:39] of life you know those three Avenues are
[29:41] the things which Satan's going to come
[29:43] through and it really constitutes it all
[29:45] avenues that Satan could use to come to
[29:47] you is that scripture where the pride of
[29:50] life and and those things and that
[29:51] constitutes the world order so there's
[29:55] no one in this world that doesn't have a
[29:57] sense of Presser a for self I would say
[29:59] that this scripture doesn't leave any
[30:01] room for anybody to say they're
[30:03] Guiltless okay that's I I read that as
[30:06] one saying Lord I know that my flesh is
[30:10] of this world so it cares for the things
[30:12] of this world I how can that mean that
[30:14] the love of God is not in
[30:17] me right so but there there you can't
[30:21] take it
[30:21] out it's there so there's a there's a
[30:25] recognition that you have to come to
[30:28] that you have an identity that the love
[30:31] of God is in that's not in
[30:35] this right here there's a seed of God
[30:38] that's in you you know the scripture
[30:40] would say in in
[30:42] uh uh let me see if I can find it it
[30:46] it's it's a good scripture Jeremiah
[30:48] 13:23 can the Ethiopian change his skin
[30:51] or the leopard his spots then may ye
[30:54] also do good that are accustomed to do
[30:56] evil
[31:05] and
[31:07] died that I I stole gum without anybody
[31:10] telling me to steal gum I was just in
[31:13] the grocery store I was raised better I
[31:15] knew better and I stole the
[31:19] gum and I got
[31:21] caught but it was just in me to do
[31:25] it just in me
[31:30] and yet there's a
[31:33] challenge that's presented see the the
[31:36] law is not going to to the law doesn't
[31:38] leave any
[31:40] unguilty that's why you need a
[31:43] savior because if there was a provision
[31:45] or a way within the law that none would
[31:47] be guilty then I guarantee you us after
[31:50] our religious Minds would it's easier to
[31:53] accept law than Grace I don't know why
[31:56] that is but why would we have a tendency
[32:00] to want to accept law over Grace yet law
[32:04] is the very thing that ministers the
[32:06] necessity of Grace that's that's right
[32:09] but some won't humble themselves to
[32:11] receive
[32:13] it so we just have to search our own
[32:16] hearts with fear and
[32:19] trembling in the message of Grace this
[32:22] is in 61
[32:25] 0827 think of it love and grace is
[32:29] sisters twin sisters you can't have
[32:31] Grace without having love they're twin
[32:34] sisters exactly right before you can
[32:36] have Grace you have to have love before
[32:39] you can actually show somebody a favor
[32:41] you love them right or wrong you have to
[32:44] love them anyhow or you can't see so
[32:48] love and grace is the same thing they're
[32:51] just twin sisters that's all love and
[32:53] grace they were we can see one you can't
[32:57] see one without the other God so loved
[33:00] the world he gave his only begotten son
[33:02] he shed his his grace and brought it
[33:06] into our hearts through the Holy Ghost
[33:08] see there's just nothing you can do
[33:11] without working one with the other
[33:14] Grace Grace of God is what saves
[33:18] us I I appreciated the brother's prayer
[33:20] because that was on my heart if you've
[33:22] been shown Grace and you've been shown
[33:24] love and there's been a forgiveness
[33:26] that's come into your life you he who's
[33:28] forgiven much loves much that is an that
[33:32] is a response that you can't
[33:35] manufacture that is a response of God's
[33:38] grace and love projecting into your life
[33:41] and you recognize Lord when I was
[33:42] unlovable you sought me when I was dead
[33:45] in sin and trespass you started to
[33:48] tenderize my heart you started to make
[33:50] you pulled the feathers out of the nest
[33:52] the things I once took pleasure in the
[33:55] things that that sin is pleasurable for
[33:57] a season but my as a Son of God well
[34:00] that pleasure is
[34:01] gone and in the after impact of it it
[34:05] starts just to not
[34:08] satisfy and then when you've been set
[34:11] free of that bondage of that going back
[34:13] out into the world and trying to get
[34:15] temporal satisfaction and you've tasted
[34:17] what it means to be set free from this
[34:19] flesh and the bondage that it was and
[34:21] now you're a free and live in Christ
[34:24] Jesus are you mad at the person who's in
[34:27] bondage
[34:28] did you free
[34:29] yourself did you break your
[34:32] bonds did you find the way out of your
[34:38] prison no we didn't deliver
[34:42] ourselves it was the grace of God that
[34:44] pulled us out of the myy
[34:47] clay and there's an identity that you
[34:49] can have that can Minister Grace and
[34:52] that's the nature that's what the bride
[34:55] is able to Adorn herself in is the love
[34:58] and the grace of Jesus Christ that has
[35:00] robed her with righteousness that she
[35:02] wouldn't have of
[35:09] herself now this is in desperation
[35:13] 6391 I just love how brother Daniel can
[35:16] just boom boom boom pull stuff up like
[35:20] that it's incredible I think we're
[35:22] spoiled here
[35:25] guys I mean I I visit some other places
[35:29] and I love reading along with the quote
[35:31] it really just helps so I appreciate it
[35:33] when they throw it up 63901 this is
[35:36] paragraph 68 now the word plainly states
[35:40] if you want to put this down Galatians
[35:42] 56 that Faith worketh by love see Faith
[35:46] worketh by love and the only way that
[35:48] you can have faith is to have love first
[35:51] because after all faith is Love's
[35:53] incentive I love that um I I looked up
[35:58] the definition of incentive and we'll
[35:59] look at it we probably could just Google
[36:01] it again because I was blessed for
[36:03] reading it but faith is Love's incentive
[36:06] incentive that's exactly what faith is
[36:09] it's an incentive to love now you if you
[36:12] don't have love you can't have
[36:17] faith
[36:20] wow how can you have faith in your wife
[36:24] if you don't love her boy see he takes
[36:27] it right in into the type that you can't
[36:28] get out of this
[36:30] now that's in filio now how about in
[36:33] Agape to God how can it be if you don't
[36:37] love God if you said you loved your wife
[36:40] and never tell her about it and never
[36:42] sit down and make love to her express it
[36:44] to tell her to kiss her to hug her and
[36:46] tell her she's the best cook in the
[36:48] country all the things that you know you
[36:51] know and how pretty she is and how much
[36:54] you love her if you don't do that she'll
[36:57] never know it that's the way if you do
[37:00] love her you express it that's the way
[37:03] we do to God we love him we tell him
[37:06] about it and we sit down and we adore
[37:08] him and worship him and see love drives
[37:12] us to
[37:14] it so love is the vehicle love has the
[37:20] faith love has the victory love has us
[37:23] sitting at at his feet telling them he's
[37:26] the lovely one and we adore him the the
[37:29] Victory and love that's been given to
[37:31] you you just have to go back and fall in
[37:33] love if you're cold if you're not seeing
[37:36] the victory in your life if the things
[37:38] and the cares of the world are are
[37:39] creeping in you need to fall in love
[37:42] with Jesus true
[37:45] because his love is greater than
[37:47] anything this world could
[37:50] express it only will ever the world will
[37:53] only ever produce death heartache and
[37:55] sorrow that's right it it it it's full
[37:58] of
[37:59] hypocrisy it's full of ma ill intent and
[38:03] and the what the scripture tells us
[38:05] about love this world can't produce it
[38:07] could only kind of grasp at it in the
[38:10] Realms of
[38:11] filio okay because it's given for the
[38:13] invisible things of God to be clearly
[38:15] manifested in the nature and the things
[38:17] around us man is made in in nature and
[38:19] Beast image and there's a there's a
[38:21] there is a uh measure ofilio of the
[38:24] attributes of God to be reflected in
[38:27] worldly things and and I would even say
[38:30] that if you feed on those things there
[38:32] there may be some things that just seem
[38:34] like they're okay love songs things like
[38:36] that and maybe in some context there is
[38:38] some virtue in it I'm not telling anyone
[38:41] to go out and listen to love songs okay
[38:43] but that's because there is a reflection
[38:46] of the love that God has for us that's
[38:49] expressed in that okay so what is
[38:52] perversion anyways perversion is when
[38:54] you take something that's real and
[38:56] that's genuine because Satan can't
[38:57] create and then he trickles it on down
[39:00] and he adds leaven to it okay and then
[39:04] what we have there's no leaven in it
[39:07] okay I I take that back there's no
[39:09] leaven in it matter of fact let's let's
[39:11] turn to that I I believe that's in found
[39:14] in the context of Galatians um and I
[39:17] think our brother maybe ministered on on
[39:20] some of what this is touches on in the
[39:23] book of Galatians on Wednesday
[39:28] I'll just start at the the first verse
[39:30] but I'm getting I think to some place in
[39:32] here if I'm if my memory serves me well
[39:38] um I believe it covers
[39:41] 11 Galatians 5 Stand Fast therefore in
[39:44] the Liberty wherein Christ hath made us
[39:46] free and be not entangled again with the
[39:48] Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto
[39:52] you that if ye be circumcised Christ
[39:54] shall profit you nothing for I testify
[39:57] to every man that is circumcised that he
[39:59] is a debor to do the whole law so now
[40:01] you made yourself subject to the law
[40:03] you're going to seek your righteousness
[40:04] after your works then go ahead and
[40:06] fulfill it big
[40:08] man do it
[40:11] all Christ has become no effect to you
[40:15] my whosoever of you are justified by the
[40:18] law you are fallen from grace for we
[40:22] through the spirit wait for the hope of
[40:24] righteousness by faith for in Christ
[40:27] neither circumcision ath anything nor
[40:29] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[40:31] by love ye did run well what who did
[40:35] hinder you that you should not obey the
[40:37] truth this persuasion cometh not of him
[40:40] that calleth you a little
[40:43] leaven lenth the whole lump you know
[40:47] it's it's actually quite amazing we
[40:49] think of Leaven as worldly things he's
[40:52] he's even talking about that Reliance on
[40:54] self-righteousness and works can can can
[40:58] spoil the very working the faith that
[41:01] you're waiting there's a hunger there's
[41:03] a thirst after righteousness there's a
[41:05] faith that says God you can perform this
[41:08] work in my heart you can make it so that
[41:11] I no longer desire these things and I
[41:14] need you to perform that amen amen you
[41:18] promised me amen that I could have the
[41:20] mind of
[41:22] Christ and I'm not
[41:25] satisfied with anything left
[41:28] and as the word comes and indicts me I
[41:30] say oo that's not that doesn't line up I
[41:33] lay down and I crucify that and I die to
[41:36] that and I said Christ I want your mind
[41:39] to live in me and that that
[41:41] understanding is a lot you know people
[41:44] talk about putting on worldly rosecolor
[41:46] glasses I wish we could really step into
[41:49] the heavenlies and see ourselves the way
[41:50] God sees us I wish we could see each
[41:53] other as as Christ sees us as
[41:56] blood-washed B Sons and Daughters of God
[41:59] and when the Satan's come and he tried
[42:00] to put a little taint on us God's not
[42:02] attributing that to our righteousness
[42:05] and we shouldn't be measuring others by
[42:06] that either you know and that's the
[42:08] conundrum right we know that God's word
[42:10] calls for total separation from unbelief
[42:13] so there's a paradox here you can't sit
[42:16] there and say you're partaking in his
[42:18] righteousness and then have the mark of
[42:19] the world on
[42:23] you okay we don't sit there and take the
[42:27] the grace of God and turn it into
[42:29] disgrace but we don't feel that this is
[42:31] something that I can I can't help a a
[42:34] butterfly out of the
[42:35] conon okay if I try to you know hey you
[42:39] need help you need to come out of there
[42:41] I'm going to you you know you need to
[42:43] you're missing the standard you're
[42:45] missing the mark the splits too high the
[42:47] shirts too the the the skirt's Too Short
[42:50] it it's hardly ever the dresses that are
[42:52] too short It's usually the skirts okay
[42:55] so that take that one for free but just
[42:59] it's funny the way it says it you know
[43:00] it's not it's not a mini dress it's a
[43:02] mini skirt so it those things they're
[43:05] there but we don't we're not trying to
[43:09] make those a
[43:11] law uh sometimes I think they do need to
[43:13] be preached they're more pastoral but
[43:15] all those things can really do is say
[43:16] Lord it it it it should cause us to just
[43:19] examine our hearts and say is the love
[43:21] of the world creeping in is the love for
[43:24] the things of the world creeping in is
[43:26] is there is there an affection in my
[43:28] heart that has been set upon the things
[43:30] of the world and the requirement for
[43:33] deliverance is absolute I it was put in
[43:37] the Book of Genesis it was put it the
[43:40] the the fall constituted the need for a
[43:42] savior it constituted the need for a
[43:45] blood covering and it even said things
[43:47] that would make us subject to the law of
[43:49] sin and death if it was not for
[43:53] Grace the very attributes of the Fallen
[43:56] nature of a woman and a man are uh what
[43:59] the world rivals in they actually
[44:01] celebrate it and they put it in your
[44:03] face and they say if there was a God
[44:09] then then you wouldn't have a fleshly
[44:11] nature
[44:13] yourself but we testify there's a new
[44:16] birth we testify there's a c Gene of God
[44:19] inside of us that is not of the world
[44:21] that they they can claim evidence exist
[44:25] they can claim all day long a worldly
[44:27] evidence of a fallen nature and a fallen
[44:29] man but it's given to us to declare a
[44:31] Heavenly Kingdom and a righteousness
[44:33] that's not of this world and we can live
[44:35] forth the very righteousness of Jesus
[44:37] Christ by his
[44:39] blood
[44:42] amen no leav Isaiah 6110
[44:47] through1 I will great greatly rejoice in
[44:50] the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my
[44:53] God for he hath clothed me with his
[44:55] garments of Salvation he have covered me
[44:57] with his robe of righteousness as a
[44:59] bridegroom deth himself with ornaments
[45:02] and a bride adorne herself with jewels
[45:05] for as the the Earth bringeth forth her
[45:08] bud and as the garden causeth things
[45:10] that are sown in its
[45:12] spring to Spring forth so the Lord will
[45:15] cause righteousness and praise to Spring
[45:18] forth before all the
[45:20] nations let's just meditate on that for
[45:23] a moment that's a beautiful scripture I
[45:26] will great rejoice in the Lord my soul
[45:29] shall be joyful in my God for he hath
[45:32] clothed me he hath clothed
[45:36] me in the garments of Salvation he hath
[45:40] covered me with Robes of righteousness
[45:44] you ever seen a kid try to put on their
[45:45] own jacket you know there's a there's a
[45:48] there's a need of him to be the one
[45:50] who's clothing Us in his righteousness
[45:52] there's a need of his robe of Salvation
[45:55] this isn't something we Adorn our
[45:57] ourselveses with and I would say that in
[46:00] if we could make ourselves a debtor to
[46:02] the law and we can fulfill it and we
[46:05] weren't an offense to one another and it
[46:06] was and you just fit the part and there
[46:09] was no
[46:10] reproach that we had I would say it
[46:13] would be more needful that our reproach
[46:15] be known and that we could wear his robe
[46:17] of righteousness than our own
[46:22] covering the First
[46:24] John 3 and9 whosoever is born of God do
[46:29] not commit sin for the seed remaineth in
[46:32] him and he cannot sin because he's born
[46:35] of
[46:37] God that's the difference that's the
[46:40] grace of God that's the love of God is
[46:43] the seed of God that's been placed in
[46:45] you and that's not something you could
[46:47] sew and do yourself but there's a
[46:50] there's a ground that's prepared your
[46:52] part is to Simply do the reasonable
[46:55] service right
[46:57] those are the things that you can do to
[46:59] keep your heart tender and that is
[47:02] whatever measure you're able to do do it
[47:06] that's a reasonable service but when
[47:08] you've come to the end of what you're
[47:10] able to do and don't stop until you find
[47:13] it because until you find the end of
[47:16] what you can do and you come into the
[47:19] place where you're say God I can't do it
[47:21] without you I have found the end I
[47:25] finally found where I'm lacking Lord I
[47:28] kept all the Commandments from my youth
[47:30] I've done it all I was raised in the
[47:32] message I always respected my Mommy and
[47:34] Daddy they told me what what to do and I
[47:37] did it but Lord I found now that your
[47:39] word has called me to something higher
[47:42] and I I can't help but be jealous I
[47:45] don't know what it is but you know this
[47:47] person does that and it just I just want
[47:49] what they have you know I can't help it
[47:51] when someone tells me they need
[47:53] something I just I'm a people pleaser
[47:54] and they make me do things that I don't
[47:56] want to do and I'm subject to it I can't
[47:58] help
[47:59] it God I need you and when you've done
[48:02] all to stand stand cuz he's on the way
[48:05] his his hand's not too short he's going
[48:07] to deliver you we preach a gospel that
[48:10] sharp because it's a it's a deliverance
[48:13] we preach a gospel that tells you you're
[48:15] a sinner because he forgives Sinners and
[48:17] he washes them in the blood of Jesus
[48:19] Christ and he sets them free We Don't
[48:21] Preach a gospel that says stay in sin we
[48:25] preach a gospel that tells you to do
[48:27] things you can't do right because we
[48:29] have a God that's more than able
[48:31] Hallelujah we preach a gospel that
[48:33] requires Grace we don't have a hope
[48:37] without Grace we don't have a doy gospel
[48:40] that is a Grace that's works that you've
[48:42] done that's turning Grace into
[48:46] disgrace it's a Grace that's greater
[48:48] than anything we could ever do it's a
[48:51] higher level of Grace it's a higher
[48:55] law it's a Higher
[48:59] Love This Is Spoken Word is the Original
[49:03] Seed now here is what I'm trying to say
[49:05] to you the law of reproduction bringing
[49:08] forth of its kind Genesis 1:1 the last
[49:10] days the church Bride Comes To The
[49:12] Headstone will be the Super Church a
[49:15] super race as it nears The Headstone so
[49:18] what's Grace Grace and love love crying
[49:20] it's crying The Headstone love Christ
[49:22] we're coming to the headstone this is
[49:24] that invisible Union this is where the
[49:26] Holy Ghost ghost has come up through the
[49:27] stature of a perfect man go ahead and uh
[49:30] put that up if you have it the stature
[49:31] of the perfect man and we're coming to
[49:33] what is a reflection of the very image
[49:35] of Christ which is summed up in one
[49:37] thing love the the whole image of the C
[49:39] I love the cabstone because it's the
[49:41] shape of the very pyramid itself the if
[49:44] you look at a Capstone it is a
[49:46] pyramid it's like if you're what's those
[49:48] gifs or whatever they just do the the uh
[49:51] unending Loop we should do one of the
[49:54] Capstone what we should do one of our
[49:56] technology Brothers needs to zoom in
[49:58] Into The Headstone and then it's the
[50:00] pyramid and then you zoom back into the
[50:02] headstone it's the pyramid it summarizes
[50:04] the entire body of the entire thing is
[50:07] made up in
[50:08] love the very pyramid itself could be
[50:11] within the Capstone the Capstone sets on
[50:14] top of it what does it love what what
[50:16] does it come in Grace Grace Grace it's
[50:19] the bride of Christ reflecting the very
[50:22] image of her husband so here's the we'll
[50:26] continue read in paragraph 3 352 now
[50:29] here's what I'm trying to say The
[50:30] Headstone that's they will much be much
[50:35] like so like him even they will be in
[50:38] his very image in the order to in order
[50:41] to be United with him they will be
[50:46] one they will be one they will be very
[50:48] manifestations of his word of the Living
[50:50] God denominations can never produce this
[50:54] this will be they will produce their
[50:56] breeds and dogmas and mix the word and
[50:59] bring a hbrd product no leav the first
[51:04] son was spoken seed word of God he was
[51:07] given a bride I'm just reviewing the
[51:10] spirit now I'm picking it up what I said
[51:12] see a bride to produce himself she fell
[51:15] see that's what the bride was given to
[51:17] produce himself again another Son of God
[51:20] but she fell by high breeding see
[51:23] produce himself but she fell caused him
[51:26] to die speaking of Eve now the Second
[51:29] Son a spoken seed word of God was given
[51:32] a bride like Adam but before he could
[51:35] marry her she had fallen also he's
[51:38] talking now about the church ages and
[51:40] she had been put on freom moral agency
[51:43] like Adam's wife was to believe God's
[51:46] word and live or doubt it and die and
[51:48] she did then from a little group of the
[51:51] true seed of the word God will present
[51:54] Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin
[51:57] of his word and through them and by them
[52:01] will be fulfilled all that has been
[52:03] promised for his word in the Virgin who
[52:06] knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas the
[52:10] Word of Promise in himself like it was
[52:12] in Mary God himself made manifest he
[52:16] will act himself by his own Word of
[52:20] Promise so to fulfill all that has been
[52:23] written of him he did when he came came
[52:27] through the Virgin wound type of the
[52:30] spirit wound now so that will the Virgin
[52:33] now accept his word be it unto
[52:36] me th though he said though it was said
[52:40] by an Angel while it yet was written
[52:44] word Isaiah 9:6 they will love him love
[52:48] his and shall have his potentials for he
[52:52] is their head and they are his subjects
[52:56] sub to the head headship of Christ was
[53:00] his notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[53:04] anything until he seen the father or the
[53:06] father showed him Harmony between God
[53:09] and Christ see John
[53:11] 5:19 so will the bride and he show her
[53:15] his word of life he knows her and she
[53:19] receives it you know depart from me I
[53:22] never knew you this is that now this is
[53:25] who is known this is how he knows his
[53:29] bride there's those who can do an
[53:31] amazing amount of works but there's a
[53:34] depart I never knew you this is a secret
[53:37] here now this is the knowing this is
[53:40] we've been invited into the bride
[53:41] chamber you know there's the there's the
[53:44] secret there's that invisible Union of
[53:46] the Bride In Christ and this is it's
[53:49] transpiring right here that's right I
[53:52] mean here's the prophet bringing to you
[53:55] how this invisible Union taking
[53:58] place
[54:00] it she never doubts it nothing amen then
[54:04] I got a great Hallelujah here is the
[54:06] secret the word is the bride and the
[54:10] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[54:12] done with the word and she does it in
[54:15] his name she has thus sayith the Lord
[54:18] then it is germatize so the Holy Spirit
[54:21] Waters it until it grows and serves its
[54:25] purpose that's
[54:27] beautiful they do only his
[54:30] will no one can persuade them different
[54:34] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[54:36] keep still then they will do the works
[54:38] of God for it is himself in them
[54:42] continuing his word to fulfill and he
[54:45] did complete in his days all things when
[54:48] he was here he did not complete all of
[54:50] them when he was here for it was not
[54:52] time yet so he's saying there's a work
[54:55] for the bride to do now let us stand
[54:57] like Joshua and Caleb and now watch
[54:59] close this is going to have a spiritual
[55:00] background now let us stand like Joshua
[55:02] and Caleb as we see the promised land
[55:05] coming in sight it's nearing the time to
[55:08] be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior
[55:10] and represents the promis in leader to
[55:13] take the church over Caleb represents
[55:15] the True Believer who stayed with Joshua
[55:18] God started Israel as as a virgin with
[55:21] his word but they wanted something
[55:22] different so did the last church but
[55:25] were the Caleb we take the promised land
[55:29] we go in and we possess it and the the
[55:32] the union between Christ and the bride
[55:35] so that she has the mind of Christ and
[55:38] the character of Christ cries Grace
[55:41] Grace this the the scripture we opened
[55:43] with the ver the bride is saying he that
[55:47] you know let's just turn back and read
[55:49] it in Revelations 22 the spirit and the
[55:52] bride say come and let him that heareth
[55:54] say come so if you've heard
[55:57] if you've heard the grace and the Good
[55:59] Tidings of the Gospel if you heard what
[56:01] this message did to call you out of dead
[56:03] formal denominationalism to call you out
[56:06] of a lukewarm gospel a Christianity that
[56:09] can stomach the things of the world that
[56:11] could say I can do the things of the
[56:12] world and claim to be a Christian I'll
[56:14] put the Emoji on my name I'm a Christian
[56:17] I I claim I love
[56:19] Jesus no you don't Jesus said if you
[56:23] love the world or the things of the
[56:24] world the love of God isn't in you
[56:27] that's not our gospel we've heard a
[56:28] gospel that says the same thing that
[56:30] Jesus Christ said and he said if you do
[56:33] those things and you love those things
[56:35] you have no part of me true you know
[56:38] it's it's it's judgment and your sins
[56:41] either go before you now and you and you
[56:43] throw yourself on the on Christ and you
[56:45] say God forgive me I'm found wanting I
[56:48] need a savior or you dress yourself in a
[56:51] right a self-righteousness I love
[56:53] Jesus I'll just live however I want I'm
[56:56] going to I'll I'll I'll take a worldly
[56:58] identity and I'm going to bring my
[57:01] Christ into it I'm going to say Jesus of
[57:04] Nazareth the one who walked the Sea of
[57:07] Galilee can dress any old way can listen
[57:10] to any old music could could go ahead
[57:12] and do all these things and you're going
[57:14] to say that's the identity of Jesus
[57:16] Christ that's not the identity of Jesus
[57:17] Christ that was declared the same
[57:19] yesterday to date him forever in our day
[57:22] it called out against it just go listen
[57:23] to a tape for crying out loud has it
[57:25] been that long since you listen to a
[57:27] tape pick one up listen to it we we we
[57:32] we trust that people are listening to it
[57:34] but we don't preach it near as hard as
[57:35] brother Brandon preached
[57:37] it and we shouldn't be scared of the
[57:39] Bride of Jesus Christ not being able to
[57:41] receive it just the way he preached it
[57:43] have we have we changed our taste buds
[57:45] to the point where we can't stomach
[57:48] it you know it I know that it's not a
[57:51] closed line gospel but it sure keeps the
[57:52] goats
[57:54] out true that's right you know it'll
[57:57] keep the goats out it ain't going to
[57:59] keep the bride
[58:02] out now we're not perfected by the law
[58:05] but sometimes we just need to get the
[58:06] goats out because there's because it
[58:09] matters okay Eve listened to a word a
[58:12] lie of the devil that said it didn't
[58:13] matter and it matters it matters the way
[58:16] you dress it matters your Associates it
[58:18] matters your friends it matters the
[58:20] influence it matters what you're feeding
[58:21] on you think it's a little thing it's a
[58:23] little seed okay it'll it'll it goes a
[58:26] lot further than you want to
[58:29] go it
[58:31] matters you can't that you can't dabble
[58:34] in the things of the world and not be
[58:36] scarred you can't da you can't take a
[58:39] coal to your bosom and not get burnt you
[58:42] can't do these things and think that it
[58:44] doesn't matter now God will save
[58:47] you he's not going to lose a
[58:51] one but why go that
[58:54] way when there's a victory that could be
[58:56] one why go that way when it can be
[58:59] salvation to others you know think of
[59:02] this and and God help us your your
[59:06] position as a Son of God sure might just
[59:08] be well and dandy on the Lamb's Book of
[59:10] Life but what about those who you failed
[59:12] to save and reach out to that could have
[59:14] been the one that had the right response
[59:16] to something you could have
[59:19] said that might have been their only
[59:22] hope and you back boneless couldn't take
[59:26] stand and it could have been someone's
[59:28] hope to say you know
[59:30] what he's
[59:33] right what he's saying is the truth they
[59:36] may not have anything in them to live it
[59:39] but on that day that could have been the
[59:40] very thing that delivered him and you
[59:43] coward couldn't take a stand
[59:47] on whose lives are at stake I'm glad
[59:50] you're
[59:52] secure I'm glad you know the love of
[59:55] God's going to take you on your
[59:58] deathbed I'm glad you're compelled of
[1:00:00] the love of Christ but what are you
[1:00:03] showing the love of Christ stands with
[1:00:07] authority it stands and call Sin Sin it
[1:00:11] stands and say you can be free from
[1:00:16] that we don't have a powerless
[1:00:22] gospel it's the love of God to set you
[1:00:24] free from it
[1:00:28] God help
[1:00:29] us I've seen God take some and I'm I'm
[1:00:32] believing for him I've sat in an
[1:00:35] atmosphere show the P Pillar of Fire and
[1:00:37] the presence of God dropped down and one
[1:00:39] person had the bad response to it the
[1:00:40] other one say don't don't say that and
[1:00:43] I'm believing for that
[1:00:46] person they there something caused a
[1:00:48] response in them that wasn't them they
[1:00:51] took a stand because there was a
[1:00:53] showdown where's The Showdown happening
[1:00:56] in your life are you just selling
[1:00:59] along is there no Showdown taking place
[1:01:02] but there's got to be a showdown where
[1:01:04] the word comes and cuts our lives and we
[1:01:06] say God I'm willing to
[1:01:08] die I'm willing to give it all to you
[1:01:10] all my heart all my mind all that I am
[1:01:12] I'm willing to
[1:01:13] die and if that's not the Showdown
[1:01:16] that's taking place in our lives then
[1:01:17] we're that's not the gospel Jesus said
[1:01:20] he came to set us under and to divide to
[1:01:23] set father against mother this gospel C
[1:01:25] causes a division it causes a separation
[1:01:29] it doesn't cause a stomach that can feed
[1:01:31] on the things of the
[1:01:34] world it it it it should throw us into
[1:01:37] desperations because it is the
[1:01:40] desperation that this word causes it has
[1:01:43] to cause something that says I'm not
[1:01:45] able to do
[1:01:47] it and if we just want to pet everybody
[1:01:49] so they just kind of make it in you know
[1:01:52] it's sickening the stuff that goes on
[1:01:54] now in the name of the message
[1:01:58] in the association of the message and
[1:02:00] and and God forbid things be named
[1:02:02] amongst our young people but we're not a
[1:02:04] social
[1:02:07] gospel just because someone friends you
[1:02:09] doesn't make them a
[1:02:12] Christian you better and watch your
[1:02:15] Associates and I'm not thinking of any
[1:02:17] particular person saying that or anyone
[1:02:19] or any friend or anybody's contacts I'll
[1:02:21] tell you that
[1:02:26] but the desperations that we should
[1:02:34] have Lord help
[1:02:36] us I don't think I read
[1:02:39] this this is in the marriage of the
[1:02:45] Lamb someday as I look towards the
[1:02:47] setting of The Sun 31 years ago made a
[1:02:53] pledge somehow lost every handkerchief
[1:02:55] if I had I didn't know how I did that
[1:02:57] but here we
[1:02:59] go someday as I look forward to setting
[1:03:02] the sun 32 years ago made a pledge see
[1:03:07] these tissues on a McGary nose they just
[1:03:09] shred so got to have some
[1:03:14] cotton the one that I loved All My Love
[1:03:18] to him I've always tried to hold up for
[1:03:21] him in his word wherever I go I know
[1:03:24] there's many other setting here like
[1:03:26] that waiting for the day
[1:03:28] that when this Old Ship isign shall come
[1:03:31] into Port pick up our souls and take us
[1:03:33] to the presence of him who we love and
[1:03:36] his pledge our love too there may be
[1:03:39] some in here tonight who's never made
[1:03:41] that pledge there may be some that's
[1:03:43] made it and broke it if you're in that
[1:03:46] condition tonight friend you don't have
[1:03:48] to just come back tonight and renew your
[1:03:50] pledge if you haven't make it why don't
[1:03:54] you come and make it tonight say Lord
[1:03:56] Jesus I love you remember if you've
[1:04:00] already made your pledge and still
[1:04:01] mingle with the things of the world
[1:04:03] Jesus will not have a bride like that he
[1:04:05] will not have one that's adulterous All
[1:04:08] Your Love must be to him and if you love
[1:04:11] the things of the world and the Fashions
[1:04:12] of the world better than you love God
[1:04:15] then you have not made yourself
[1:04:18] ready is that person in here tonight
[1:04:22] while you have your heads bowed would
[1:04:23] you raise up your hand and say brother
[1:04:25] brand and pray for me I do not want to
[1:04:28] be that way I do I want to be a part of
[1:04:31] the Bride I know I'm doing things I

[1:04:51] your life you have to look back before
[1:04:54] you can go forward
[1:04:56] look what you have been look what spirit
[1:04:59] that you've got has made you if you
[1:05:03] haven't if you Proclaim to be a
[1:05:05] Christian and you still mingle with the
[1:05:08] things of the world brother sister you
[1:05:10] can but be blind if you don't see that
[1:05:15] you're wrong so you're blind if you can
[1:05:19] mingle with the world and the things of
[1:05:20] the world you're
[1:05:23] blind I counsel you to by isev that you
[1:05:26] can see get in the presence of a holy
[1:05:30] God know the right not an anointing not
[1:05:33] an outpouring but know that you've met
[1:05:35] Jesus Christ himself and the love of
[1:05:38] Jesus Christ for yourself and you tell
[1:05:40] me if those things are in that
[1:05:45] presence you you'll have no need of any
[1:05:48] man to teach
[1:05:51] you anything when your eyes come open
[1:05:55] and you can they can be opened in his
[1:05:57] presence
[1:06:05] said glad they had that up someone said
[1:06:08] the other day said brother brandom you
[1:06:10] ought to leave off the people like that
[1:06:12] said people call you a prophet I said
[1:06:14] I'm not a prophet but said people think
[1:06:16] you are you ought to be teaching these
[1:06:18] women instead of telling them to wear
[1:06:19] long hair and the right kind of clothes
[1:06:21] and things like that you ought to be
[1:06:23] telling them how to be to get spiritual
[1:06:25] things isn't that something that's
[1:06:28] that's that that's that charismatic
[1:06:31] that's that
[1:06:32] Pentecostalism that's that lack of
[1:06:35] understanding that the rain falls on the
[1:06:36] just and the unjust and and we should be
[1:06:40] darome ourselves to think just because
[1:06:42] we can get an anointing get the moving
[1:06:45] of the spirit have even gifts that we
[1:06:47] could operate in our lives that somehow
[1:06:49] there's a way of
[1:06:53] Escape it
[1:06:57] it's false Doctrine you're blind you're
[1:07:01] blind I said how can I teach them
[1:07:03] algebra when they won't learn even take
[1:07:06] ABCs the kindergarten haven't you even
[1:07:09] haven't even got the decency to clean
[1:07:11] themselves up calling the bride of
[1:07:14] Christ I'm not saying that irritable I'm
[1:07:17] saying that in Godly love so now we're
[1:07:20] understanding what God's love is God's
[1:07:23] Love's
[1:07:24] corrective and as I said this morning if
[1:07:26] you see you going down the river in a
[1:07:28] boat and you see you're going to hit the
[1:07:30] falls and the boat won't take it me
[1:07:33] screaming at you and hollering at you
[1:07:35] and I'm trying to hurt you I love you
[1:07:37] because if you don't your life will be
[1:07:39] lost is there anyone is there another
[1:07:43] one raise up your hands before we pray I
[1:07:46] see you back there ain't
[1:07:53] that amen who even knows if he saw him
[1:07:56] with the natural
[1:08:00] eye but he sees
[1:08:02] you you don't it you know the the
[1:08:05] smallest desperate cry he
[1:08:08] hears if it's a cry in faith and it's a
[1:08:11] cry in the heart he hears that cry you
[1:08:14] may not even raise your hand physically
[1:08:16] but something in your heart can go lord
[1:08:18] it's me I want more and that's that seed
[1:08:21] Gene of God that he put in you and he's
[1:08:23] drawing it
[1:08:34] God there's something wrong somewhere
[1:08:36] look at you out in the rooms out there
[1:08:38] raise up your hand say pray me brother
[1:08:40] brandom God bless you that's right
[1:08:42] honest to goodness I admire sincerity
[1:08:45] that's what's the trouble with the
[1:08:46] Pentecostal church today we might as
[1:08:48] well just put all our names there we
[1:08:51] haven't got the real sincerity we used
[1:08:53] to have we haven't got the audacity to
[1:08:55] come and say admit we're wrong the devil
[1:08:58] has just got so much hold on the church
[1:09:00] until it's just wallowing in the muck of
[1:09:02] the world don't do that your own life
[1:09:05] proves that you haven't got what you say
[1:09:07] and you got then why not confess it he
[1:09:11] will confess his sin shall be pardoned
[1:09:14] he that hides his sin shall not Prosper
[1:09:16] you can't hide it God knows all about it
[1:09:19] if you see and know what you're not
[1:09:21] living right then why not confess it and
[1:09:24] come out and let it be be clear some
[1:09:27] people sins go before them some follow
[1:09:30] let mine go before let me tell all of
[1:09:33] mine right now Lord God get it right
[1:09:36] that's what I ought to
[1:09:38] do that's my prayer Lord I I want to be
[1:09:42] right I want my heart
[1:09:46] right this message has come to to
[1:09:49] restore a
[1:09:51] heart with that heart of Faith a heart
[1:09:54] to believe all things that possible a
[1:09:56] heart to believe that I'm the very image
[1:09:58] of God that I'm declaring his
[1:10:00] righteousness and I don't want any
[1:10:02] worldly ISM attached to it he loved me
[1:10:06] so much to identify with me and my shame
[1:10:09] he loved me enough that the stubborn
[1:10:12] person I
[1:10:16] was I remember a time it was the
[1:10:18] Crystal's Pizza I don't even know if
[1:10:20] anyone Liv lived in this town longer
[1:10:22] long enough to remember Crystal's Pizza
[1:10:27] anyone all right Crystal's Pizza it was
[1:10:31] this pizza joint and I think over in
[1:10:33] Irving off MacArthur it had this nice
[1:10:36] Blinky sign out front and it was really
[1:10:38] cool inside had arcades it had uh
[1:10:42] bowling things had a Sunday bar you can
[1:10:45] go get your Sunday and you could put all
[1:10:46] the toppings on it you wanted and my
[1:10:48] family would go there periodically maybe
[1:10:51] every now and then a
[1:10:52] Friday and the musicians could come I'm
[1:10:55] going to try to wrap up
[1:10:57] and I probably should have looked up the
[1:11:00] year at close because it probably given
[1:11:02] me an idea of how old I was but I
[1:11:04] imagine I was maybe six seven eight
[1:11:06] years old and something
[1:11:09] happened where I wasn't going to go in
[1:11:13] it was a hot
[1:11:15] Friday
[1:11:17] evening and the rest of the family went
[1:11:19] in and I stayed in the back of
[1:11:21] that station wagon
[1:11:25] and I was so stubborn I sat in there for
[1:11:28] the two hours that they were in
[1:11:31] there I wasn't going to go in I wasn't
[1:11:34] going to relent whatever it was in my
[1:11:37] thinking I can't remember what it was
[1:11:39] but I was hurt enough that even though
[1:11:42] they wanted me to go in and everybody's
[1:11:44] like you know come in you're going to
[1:11:46] have a good time just come in Let It Go
[1:11:48] I wasn't going to let it go I sat in
[1:11:50] that van it was I think it was actually
[1:11:54] a station wagon and I was just
[1:11:58] stubborn and that's the nature I have
[1:12:03] even when God would entreat me show me
[1:12:06] things I had nothing to even help myself
[1:12:10] my stubborness was even bigger than I
[1:12:13] was but I do remember another time I
[1:12:16] went out to a van I believe it was tape
[1:12:18] meetings in Little Rock Arkansas Hot
[1:12:21] Springs
[1:12:22] Arkansas they were playing a tape at a
[1:12:24] at a YMCA Center and my father came out
[1:12:27] to me I wasn't in the service I was
[1:12:29] running
[1:12:32] around and go ahead and play he touched
[1:12:35] me I
[1:12:36] guess I just don't want you sitting
[1:12:40] there maybe I wanted you to have a
[1:12:42] closer
[1:12:43] view but the grace of God that that
[1:12:47] found me in that
[1:12:50] moment I went out to the van and I
[1:12:52] started to pray I said God if you could
[1:12:55] being there you could be out here
[1:12:59] too I don't even think I
[1:13:03] understood even what I was
[1:13:06] praying I couldn't comprehend what was
[1:13:09] about to
[1:13:11] transpire I don't even know what led me
[1:13:13] to that van to sit there and to say that
[1:13:16] prayer but the presence of the Lord
[1:13:19] Jesus Christ came in that van and he
[1:13:22] changed
[1:13:23] me and everything that I was in that
[1:13:26] moment
[1:13:28] changed I knew a
[1:13:32] presence that was the love of God
[1:13:34] projected to me you didn't need to tell
[1:13:37] me what wasn't
[1:13:39] pleasing I didn't want to do anything to
[1:13:41] disturb that
[1:13:43] atmosphere I wanted it to abide with me
[1:13:47] forever it wasn't even long after that
[1:13:50] offence came Satan's always trying to
[1:13:53] trouble that atmosphere of the Lord
[1:13:55] L and the Holy Spirit in
[1:13:58] you it's a
[1:14:00] dove it's a home loving
[1:14:03] bird it wants to take
[1:14:05] Roost it wants to be there and we do
[1:14:09] things that cause an offense we do
[1:14:12] things that shock the atmosphere and all
[1:14:15] we have to do is really get the love
[1:14:18] back get the atmosphere right the holy
[1:14:22] spirit's there to lead and guide us in
[1:14:24] all truth and righteousness he's not
[1:14:26] leaving
[1:14:28] us to
[1:14:30] ourselves you don't have to do this
[1:14:33] alone but you could ask God to come and
[1:14:35] pilot the ship you could ask him to be
[1:14:38] the power in the engine you could ask
[1:14:40] him to be your sight you could ask him
[1:14:42] to be your guide and anything any
[1:14:45] thinking contrary to that you could say
[1:14:49] Lord I want to die to
[1:14:50] that I recognize it's there I put it
[1:14:54] before me and I ask Lord that it would
[1:14:57] be dead at
[1:14:58] Calvary let's just stand together and
[1:15:01] let's sing that song and just in your
[1:15:04] heart I wasn't in a church service when
[1:15:07] that happened I was in a van by
[1:15:10] myself years later I'd be in a park and
[1:15:14] I would say it's a perfect type of man
[1:15:15] and wife in Christ in the
[1:15:17] church and the presence of God would
[1:15:19] drop down again and many times in my
[1:15:23] life in the presence of the Lord has
[1:15:25] dropped down and it hasn't been in
[1:15:26] church so you don't have to be here but
[1:15:29] I will say as you're in an atmosphere
[1:15:31] Believers ones who could say what he's
[1:15:33] done for me he could do for you and as
[1:15:35] we would incline our hearts as Believers
[1:15:37] that God would you touch one that
[1:15:39] doesn't know you that if you
[1:15:41] would incline your heart to him he could
[1:15:44] do that for
[1:15:46] you where our strength is
[1:15:49] gone where our strength is not able he's
[1:15:53] the Difference Maker
[1:15:55] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:15:57] Lord none of us by ourselves has a
[1:16:00] righteousness and we're all
[1:16:02] transgressors Lord the very things that
[1:16:04] I've spoken of Lord you know the times
[1:16:06] in my life I failed to take a
[1:16:09] stand I failed to Proclaim My Love For
[1:16:12] You Lord in action or deed and or maybe
[1:16:16] I've even done things that partook of
[1:16:19] things that didn't show forth your
[1:16:21] glory Lord in the love that you've shown
[1:16:24] me
[1:16:25] Lord and He who's been forgiven much
[1:16:29] we're debtors of much father Lord what a
[1:16:32] greater love we should
[1:16:34] show Lord I want to show forth a greater
[1:16:37] praise and a greater love through a
[1:16:39] righteous life through a holy life
[1:16:42] through a clean life through one that
[1:16:44] doesn't dabble in the world or partake
[1:16:46] of the things of the world Lord that
[1:16:49] doesn't bring a reproach upon your name
[1:16:51] father ask you to forgive me where I've
[1:16:54] come short of that Lord David would even
[1:16:57] pray for the iniquities he knew not Lord
[1:17:01] I I'd say in my mind I can't even
[1:17:04] comprehend the depths of your
[1:17:07] righteousness Lord what is man that
[1:17:09] you're mindful of him Lord that you
[1:17:12] would even come down and visit us with a
[1:17:14] holy
[1:17:15] presence Lord but Purge our minds once
[1:17:18] again father take all of our hearts once
[1:17:21] again Lord Lord we give ourselves to you
[1:17:24] a fresh just rededicating ourselves oh
[1:17:26] God asking Lord the grace and the grace
[1:17:29] and the grace that was cried out this
[1:17:31] morning father would be effectual Lord
[1:17:34] it would show forth a love a love for
[1:17:37] you
[1:17:39] God a love that's greater than the
[1:17:41] things of the world oh
[1:17:43] God lord for it's your promise to us

[1:17:53] precious name of our Lord and Savior
