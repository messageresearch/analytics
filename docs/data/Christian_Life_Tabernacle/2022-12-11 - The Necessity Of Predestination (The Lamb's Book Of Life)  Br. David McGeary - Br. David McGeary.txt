interested in what God's done for you so we're just going to give you a moment take your time and and and feel free and and uh we'll just enjoy it thank you amen God bless you brothers and sisters I just want to say this in in English because I want the pastor to hear this from me um I told this morning that I want to give my testimony on Wednesday but here I am um thank you all for your prayers during this time that is that has been very difficult for me and my family in November 2021 it started all with [Music] covid and day after day symptoms kept adding up and nov on November 18th I remember I couldn't breathe anymore and um however I could speak and uh breathe I told him I needed to go to the hospital I told my husband on the way I told him to call the call Brother David her pastor so that he could pray for us for me on the way on the road which was a very long long road uh from my home to the hospital I sent messages to my family saying goodbye cuz I felt like it was the last last time that I was ever going to see him or talk to them and I remember my dad's face when I was leaving the house it's probably the hardest thing that you have to say uh by or hard for a parent to say to their daughter I'm going to try and cut it a little bit short cuz it's uh it's a little bit long and I'm feeling sentimental I think in total uh we had six visits to the ER um and if we visit I would tell the doctors I couldn't breathe my heart uh had heart palpitations and had a lot of trouble breathing my heart rate my heart uh beats would go from 30 beats per minute to 160 in a matter of minute seconds I didn't understand what was going on because to the doctors it was just anxiety and I never had anxiety and it went like that through the end of December for me every night it was difficult because I felt I wasn't going to wake up anymore every night at the end of December one of the last days in December we came to Brother David so that he would pray for us and that day God spoke to me from Brother David's uh voice he spoke to me that day uh God said things to me that I had never told Brother David questions I had in my mind that he was answering and it was answer after answer of things that I had been asking God all this time everything he was saying was an uh an answer to a question I had that day something happened I feel that day God revealed himself to me because years I had been coming to church and I just was doing it just to play the role I never felt Christian I was just coming to church to to follow on order I would just I would just come to church and a dress and I would go back home and I would put my pants back on and I'm not proud of what I'm telling you but I want you to know what God has done in my life because since that day December 27th till today I serve God that day when I went back home I threw away all my clothes and on my knees I asked forgiveness and I think that day I spent hours in the closet praying something that I never done in my life my mom would always take us to church me and my husband uh heard of the message from my mom but I didn't want anything to do with it and going back just a little bit God had already been calling calling on me and in July 2021 I I uh I something had uh had an intoxication in my system that was very severe in my body um feel I went to the hospital I spent the day there it was in Mexico and I'm sure now that that day I was going to die I promised God things that day and when I felt better I didn't I didn't keep my promises when all this happened with Co I came to a scripture I think it was Ecclesiastes 5 I'm going to read it Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 5 when I read this scripture I don't know how to explain it to you let me explain let me in Ecclesiastes 5 is's just talking about when you make when you make a vow to God uh defer not to pay it for the had no pleasure in in fools pay that which thou Hast vowed better is it that thou sh should us not vow then that thou shouldest vow and not pay when I let this scripture was something that just came through flashed through my mind really really quick how I felt the moment I was going to die how God took me out of that how you res me and now it feels great it's a pleasure to be here I want to serve God every day and and it's a joy to be here when I come now before I used to make a lot of excuses not to come to church and now that I want to be here the enemy puts a lot of for her not to come every Saturday something happens it's my husband it's our kids I get sick our babies I get sick every Saturday night and every Sunday morning we say we're going because I have to defeat the enemy one day he will leave us CU I have a promise and I believe in everything that the word says and I believe I'm Healed even in my body still going through some of the uh the struggles that it's been going through in the name of our Lord Jesus I was listening to brother Matthew's testimony and it touched my heart how a mother is always fighting and praying for her children her kids Matthew and my testimony is nothing like brother Matthews but by faith I know my kids will be at his feet one day because I have the same promise that he has that we all have in the time that I didn't serve God I was uh I was the cause of I was an obstacle in my mom's way I was always the cause of all her pain a lot of her pain not my father not my my brothers they don't believe and I always told them that they had a right and that they had a a good reason that it was my mom that was just being religious yeah and now that I have the Revelation I asked my mom for for for forgiveness and I know that with my example my brothers will come too too not because of me but by the grace of God now my sister God my sister's heart and she has same the same desire deserve I always thought that just because I didn't go out I didn't drink I didn't go out and have a great time like everybody I thought I was right because I didn't do all that but now I know that it's not the case forgive me that I'm just uh time jumping from one time to another time but I don't have my notes thank you Pastor [Music] in the time that I was really I would ask God why people why were other people healthy and why do they have everything and they don't even serve him and they were enjoying life and a voice told told me because you're mine cuz you're one of mine and because I'm molding you in my in the way that I want to mold you and I give all the glory and all the honor to God because of what he's doing to me and now my uh family members tell me that I look a lot better because I looked really I was in real bad shape and and physically and and and emotionally I was unstable at at that time my response to them always is is glory to God cuz now I'm a lot better than I was before because I serve a living God a god of power who takes care of me and my family and it doesn't matter what the enemy wants to do we're in his hands and he's in control I always wanted to come up here so that they would pray for me now I know I have the power to do it myself and declare that I am healed thank [Applause] you I if I could say something um we always we almost didn't come in I had a real bad toothache a horrible too th uh earlier like two hours ago and all of a sudden like within between the service in the morning and now it just it went away we know why now I didn't even know so but we know why it's because we serve a great God that's right you know you might not understand why that I I thought my heart you know the best testimony is the one you don't prepare to give amen you know because it's alive and it's real and we have that kind of God that can speak and tell you the secrets of your heart and you might speak to a lot of people and you're just saying what God's telling you to say I I'm in fact I I even uh not knowing why I I went into this uh the see if I can find it because I just I underlined it uh earlier and and uh I don't know if I I have it in here or not but anyway maybe it was just for me uh personally but uh uh the prophet of God talks about how that how you can discern what somebody's in somebody's heart and he said how because it's a thought and God had to have that thought in order to discern it and he said so it wasn't me he said it was God and and and that's what is beautiful and I I just like to share a little uh something because I think it goes so well with our our sister's testimony and what I I'd like to call it is is the necessity of uh let me see if I I brought it maybe I didn't that's the reason I don't have it on my desk in there if would you go there's a a book in there called proving his word I I didn't pick it up when I came out but it's what that I want to uh just to speak out of a little bit this evening is the necessity of predestination and uh and uh or I could also call it um uh the Lamb's uh book Book of Life and see if this is the right one here okay page paragraph see if I have it here which what year is this no it's the other proving his word I'll get it it right you just keep going on right I should preach perseverance all right there's another one in there he'll bring that one and then I can get uh started I hope all right all right let's try this one okay ah here you go three is the completion right so everything's everything's good everything's good we uh we talked this this morning about uh uh about the word of God and the importance of the word of God and a as we as we talked about it um um we realize the and again we're talking about the necessity of predestination or or or we could say another way we could say why the Lamb's Book of Life and everything that God does he has a purpose in doing it he has a reason of doing it and the what he is obligates him to do things certain ways and I I hope that my vocabulary can express that to you uh when he made a law he was obligated to place a punishment upon the breaking of that law because it wouldn't be a law if if it stayed in that a place if it didn't have a punishment then it it wouldn't be a law because there there would be not nothing to enforce it so there would have to be an enforcement to the law and that lets you know how crazy our society's gotten that in some places if you steal under $800 worth of merchandise they don't even prosecute it so what you're saying is Everybody's Free to steal $800 well that's not what God says God said Thou shalt not steal and there there was a a penalty uh to the law so God's word obligates him he's obligated to what that he speaks and he only speaks that which reflects himself he can't speak something that's not him that would be deception that would be deceiving and there's one thing that God cannot do and that God can't lie so when God says something you know that he's got to see it through all the way till the end and we read that this morning right that his very words will show up judgment and that's what he was telling the people hey heavens and earth is going to pass away but my word is not going to pass away in fact what I'm telling you now is what is going to judge you when you get there I don't come to judge any man Jesus is saying they like that part of them he said but I've come to save you amen but he saves Us by giving us his word and he went further in saving us knowing that the law demanded a recompense uh for all that would break it and not hold it true he kept that rep recompense for us in other words he paid the price of the law so of all the law that we have broken he did the prison time amen he did he did he took the the the penalty and the penalty of sin was what death and that's what he did he paid the death and it couldn't just be uh it had to be a a a peer offering and so it a good payment is one without sin if it if if I would die for your sins and I had sins then I really wasn't dying for yours I was dying for mine but but if I had no sin and I was righteous and there was no cause for my death then I could apply my debt you know what I mean it's like in a debt if if if if there's a a home for sale for example and and and the people that built the home they filed a lean against it and and everybody says they owe me this they owe me that they owe me this well when that house is sold they take that money and and they divide it up on all those leans sometimes there's not enough money there and what they'll do is they'll settle we'll settle for 50 cents on the do dollar we'll settle for 75 cent just give me 75 cents of every dollar that you owe me and I'll sign off on the lean there there's a settlement involved because there was there was something owed so if if I was to give my life and I had sin then part of my life if you could express what I'm saying would have to go to that debt but he didn't have any debt so he could take his life which was righteous life a life that he didn't have to lay down because there was no death in him nobody could take his life he says they don't take my life I Lay My Life down for my own so he laid his life down and paid the debt and and so when you begin to think of what is the importance of predestination you have to understand that God's nature and what that he was caused him to have to predestinate you understand why because he couldn't mix with anything that wasn't his word because if he mixed it it wouldn't be pure if it was mixed with anything other than word word and word brings forth word word and anything else brings forth death it won't last we call it in the in in in The Parables leav a little Le leth the whole lump in other words it it won't be the same with even a little leaven that's why it had to be unleavened bread it couldn't have anything mixed in it and we understand that's the type of the word of God it can't have anything mixed in it so God's word couldn't mix with anything else except word so if if he and so in order for him to mix or or join himself together he had to have something that was him to mix with or that was word to mix with therefore he had to predestinate you before the foundation of the world he had to put your name and who you were because he saw you then before there ever was a star before there ever was a moon before there ever was in anything you were with him in the beginning you were part of the word of God and so if you ever were going to have eternal life you always had eternal life because he couldn't he he couldn't uh he couldn't mix or bring forth life with anything else other than life so that's why when we understand our predestination we understand why it had to be predestination we we knew that because of the Fall that we came the way that we came and he allowed that because he wanted to express his attributes but he he he always knew that we were a part of him in the beginning we were only part of him maybe in his thinking you understand but because we were there in his thinking he could put us on the Lamb's Book of Life and so now he's got something that he's going to unite himself with that he's going to manifest himself in that he's going to bring forth his life in that and that so he he couldn't just if he just kept his life then it would never been shared but the very attribute of Love is sharing so he wanted to share it he wanted to express it he wanted to have preeminence and he wanted to bring his children back to where they were in the beginning and the only thing that could do that was was his word and so his word couldn't mix with anything another words we he could couldn't have mixed with us the way that we were even if he paid the price for us since we were born in sin shaped in iniquity we were hybrid to begin with we came into the world speaking lies our righteousness is as filthy rags there still wouldn't have been anything that he could join to unite with and produ with and that's what that's what he says as far as reproducing himself he couldn't reproduce himself so when when when Eve when she was by her the prophet of God said by her seed she brought forth Twins and we know that there was death in that but he doesn't bring forth death he brings forth life so in order for him to bring forth life there had to be something of him there the word because the word only joins and unites and and uh uses the word uh breed or brings or or reproduces it can only reproduce with word it can't reproduce with something that's not word so we were born in C shape and iniquities he couldn't he couldn't reproduce with that he now he could come pay the price for it but that would just pay the debt it wouldn't change what we were so we have to be borned again but if you don't have life in you you understand if you don't have that seed in you then there's nothing there to to be birthed and a birth takes two parts we know that so it there had to be something that he put there amen that he and he uses the word and and he me makes mention many times of this message I hope some of you were inspired enough to start going back and reading he says that to impregnate or to unite with so he had to place there what he was going to unite with because it had to come from him in order to be him it it couldn't come from any place else it had to come from it's original Source because the spoken word is the or Original Seed and every seed that was ever planted came from God's word is that right you understand that when he said let there be let there be let this be let be all that was original and it could produce after its own kind but the minute Another Kind came in right then there was death so he couldn't mix with anything so he had to predestinate and supply of seed in you that he could Unite with in order to reproduce himself and so like if we were to read in Luke uh the I think it's the uh eth chapter of Luke again starting at the fourth verse of the eth chapter of Luke it says and when much people were gathered together and come to him out of every city he spake by a parable now we remember when we read over I believe it was in Matthew he said in all these things Jesus Jesus spake unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world now he is going to preach now in this Luke he's preaching the revelation of pred destination amen yes they might not understand it you understand because we know that it's going to be sealed up until the last day but it was still him that preached it because the word of God's Eternal so he's going to preach it right now he says so a multitude come together and he spake by a parable a s went out sowing his seed and he sowed and some fell by the by the wayside and was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell on the rocks and as soon as it sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture some among the thorns and thistles sprang up with it and choked it and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear forth fruit H hundredfold and and when he said these things he cried he that hath a ear to hear Let Him hear hallelujah amen amen you know how you say well how do I know I have to hear the ear the ear is revelation that's right that's right anybody can hear the word but the ear of the spirit is revelation and then the disciples you know is you as as they come the disciples ask him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that they seen they might not see and hearing that they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so every seed is a word of God so when when we talk about the seed being in you the seed that's being in you if you can understand that's the word of God that's in you yes oh I just thought our sister's testimony was beautiful it was in her amen and and she said and and I almost come out of my seat cuz she said I I was there and God spoke to me that I was his and that's what the prophet of God says he says when the rug rugged original word seed speaks to your heart and says your mine why because that seed is his he planted it it was his seed he owned that seed and that's seed was his word so what that he placed in your heart is the word of God the word of God was in there in the beginning another there was a thought expressed in you from the beginning oh that's what's going to come alive that's what's got to that's what's got to to come forth and bring forth and and spring up in us and you see if I have that I want to read it just right right here uh he says now what he says he says now what is the seed of life the word of God Amen therefore for life you can't come through through a Creed you can't come through a denomination you've got to come back to the word now the seed of life he said all right his word is his seed and his spirit is the water you see what did they what did they die from lack of moisture so his seed his word is his seed and the spirit is the water now right back to John 13:14 there you get it again you see the spirit is the water John 13:14 we understand what it means if you want to read it and he talked about Moses lifting up the blast cir we'll go into that later but the the seed is the word of God so that word of God that had to be in you and so we know that the that a lot of people this question Rises up uh is uh about the word that the letter kth but the spirit giveth life that's 2 Corinthians 3 and 6 let's just read that for uh a a moment as we just uh talk about these one wonderful things of the Lord and uh so second Corinthians 3 and and six he says Paul speaking here uh he says and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of our our El but our sufficiency is of God Amen who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and so what is the spirit of the word amen now we've drifted so far sometimes in our carnality that we relate the spirit with things Untouchable and and unseen so uh spiritual things are are not thing seen or uh they're only felt you understand so you you you people feel that you know the word intellectually but you feel the the spirit but that's not the spirit of the word the spirit of a word when it's the spirit of something it's what the intention and purpose of it was that's right if you were to be in a great legal battle and they would start to bring forth the law and one attorney might he might speak the law and he'll say well this is what the law was saying this was the intention of the law this is what why the law was written and the other exper attorney would argue that no that's not what the intention of the law was that's not what the rule of the law was written for and they would try to to to to find out what what was the spirit of the law what was the purpose of the law we have a whole Supreme Court which are supposed to be great ET uh attorneys and great legal minds and their job is to judge the Spirit of the Constitution what was the intention of our fathers that's right Hallelujah well we have the judge the jury and everything in the Lord Jesus right he says I have not come to do away with the law but I have come to fulfill the law I have come to present the spirit of the law what the law was intended to do the law was intended to make the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit but because you were born in sin shaped in iniquity came in the world speaking lies and you are full of Deceit I had to govern that I had to bind you by the law I had to put rules on you to keep this hybrid person that you are in check but when you're born again and you're born again when the seed that was in you is impregnated by the word of God and now you receive and the intentions of the word of God does the new birth have an experience yes you heard it testified of of tonight something changed I was born again God dealt with me I received the holy spirit amen I went into my closet I had a a sister that had accepted the word of the Lord and and God moved on her heart she went home and and I don't know if any of you are old enough to remember but they used to have stereo cabinets like this they'd have the TV in it in the middle and a record player on one side and and then you had these little sliding drawers on the other and it was uh the whole thing was in a cabinet and they were heavy and she got in the spirit and and the spirit moved upon her that that was the devil and she knew this is where her problem was it was these soap operas and all this stuff and and and she found herself where she just had to go and see what they were going to do you know they always leave you hanging with a carrot who's going to cheat on who and who's going to find out the LIE who's that that the prophet of God said he said the church is reading too many romance books I think today you'd say the church is playing too many games she took that thing she picked it up and she carried her out and she threw it out in the front yard and when her husband came home he wanted to know how in the world did that thing get in the front yard she got in the spirit of the word she got in the purpose of the word the intention of the word what it was written for that's why they can fall on the unjust but it falls on the just it falls on the just it falls on on the spirit in other words the intention and the purpose of what's been spoken is predestinated to fall on somebody that that intention of the word might be manifested in the flesh that's right you can't do it uhuh not by will not by strength not by might but by the spirit of the Lord but by my spirit sayeth the Lord by my intention that's why you know when that rugged word of God speaks out and he says that you are mine what's he doing he's taking possession of the seed that he put there he says now is the time that the seed that I planteth bringeth forth of its kind Hallelujah you would have never brought it forth it had to be there it had to be predestinated cuz it could only come forth after its kind so if it wasn't planted in the beginning when he spoke every seed it would never come up because there was nothing else anywhere to produce it because everything was hybrid and that's why he said it had to be watered the spirit the intention of the word is watered by him revealing it to us what the great intention was so why predestination cuz he had to have something that was him or of him or from him in the beginning to bring to life now I know in some of us that seed's lying in a bunch of rotten stuff but God will do anything that it takes anything that it takes that seed was in a woman at the well her condition was just terrible she was an outcast she had to come to the well by herself it the the every situation was bad it seemed hopeless beyond the comprehension of Hope but the scripture says I have need to go by there that's right he knew what he was waiting for he knew what he was sitting he knew that he was going to speak to her and that there was something in her that was going to come to life when you measure yourself remember God works from the inside out there may be things in your life but you'll find out you hate those things but you can't get away from that part inside of you that says I know this is truth and that's what she said we have been told when the Messiah comes he'll do these things oh my you can read all the scriptures very few places did he ever say I am he but he said I am he to her I'm he you found life I have water water amen that you know not of I have living water and if you drink this water you will never thirst that's the spirit of God you'll never thirst you'll never hunger yes thank because you're full God's revealing to you his intention he's revealing to you his purpose he's revealing to your election he's revealing to you why he put you here in this age and what the reason for it is he just sowed the seed he knew where it was going he knew it'd be good ground but what did he say is I'm the husbandry I I'll dig you up I'll dung your roots I'll prune you I'll Water you I'll make you fruitful CU every tree that's not fruitful every tree that's Barren will be chopped down cast down it's got to be his fruit and it couldn't be his fruit without trying to and that's what we're fighting is wickedness in high places and what's his whole purpose is to discredit the word not discredit the teachings of Jesus they teach them all over that's not what he's trying to discredit he's trying to discredit the Eternal seed word that's in you that's what he doesn't want you to touch that's what he doesn't want to come alive that's why he'll he'll twist your mind and the battles in the mind but he gave us the best weapon and that's his word that's what speaks to your heart that's why it's important to get alone with God and read the word of God you're not reading it to study it because that's why he said the the letter kills so if you take the word without the intention and purpose for which the word was given then that very word becomes an instrument of death how many people try to take this Bible and prove the Trinity it's the mark of the beast you know who else took the word Satan he said it is written it is written it is written but what did Jesus know he says that wasn't the intention why it was written he didn't write it for that purpose he didn't write it for that reason he didn't speak it for that reason that wasn't the spirit of it when he spoke it he says to you I only tell them in Parables that seeing they don't see and hearing they don't understand but to you is given the Kingdom of Heaven to you is given the spirit of the word the intention of the word the revelation of God's word that's why the church is built on Revelation his reason what do you think he shared with us in this day the mighty angel put his foot on land and sea and opens the book and reads the book The Book of Life and reveals all the intentions and all the purposes of God's word things that were uttered that never were spoken that we might be able to rise up and say wow I never did anything he's only un ning with himself that's right he's he's joining himself back to what was was in me that he put in me it's an invisible Union between the Earthly bride there she was in seed form and then he begins to unite himself with that and and we stand in a of ourselves we know that there that this wretched flesh is encapsulating something that's growing up within us and we can't deny it our flesh cries for one thing because the flesh Warth against the spirit but our spirit cries for righteousness and Truth oh we we sit back and I I ask what's going to win and then he speaks these great words if I start a work in you I will finish it till the end nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow that's right amen thank you Jesus you actually see something growing in you many times I stood back and I say why did it take me so long I just hear something Echo back in me you wouldn't listen how many times do I have to learn this lesson until it comes to pass cuz he won't quit try to quit you don't even want to try to quit there was Paul one that he created to be the church age messenger and bring his gospel to the Gentiles and he's absolutely out there and imprisoning them and putting him in the death stood witness to it now tell me that isn't a paradox why would he allow such a thing why would he allow it to be in the woman in the well why would he allow it to be in the man that was possessed with demons that would rise up and Nash on people and lose his temper and just be angry and Shout out and and be uncontrollable why to show that he can do anything and will do anything to save his elect that's nothing I know he reached his hand down in the pits of hell but he speaks it in Romans I believe it's in Romans 8 he says Jacob and Esau hallelujah amen he said Jacob I loved and Esau I hated the children having done neither good nor evil but that the law of election might stand hallelujah oh that makes my heart beat it makes me happy makes me happy when someone stands up I used to do this and I used to do that you don't have to go into detail but something happened the word spoke to my heart and I was changed I was borned again a new creature arose oh I used to go home and come to church in a dress and go home and put on my pant I just did it I knew it were right but one day Hallelujah I Heard a Voice that says you're mine you think the battle's over no no chastisement comes he chastises his own think it not strange at the chastisement it might seem sorrowful at the time but it brings forth the beautiful beautiful peace that you know that he loved you that he's going to do whatever it takes whatever it takes he is not going to lose a one you can't go too far if you have the seed that's right he'll leave the 99 he'll do whatever he text but he has spoken it all the father hath given me will come that's I don't know who he's given or who has who he hasn't given therefore it's wise to treat all men as if they're angels unaware good practice wise practice taught by the Lord do unto others yes sir as you would have them do unto you that word is going to come forth but it had to be predestinated else there would been nothing there for him to breed with and bring life with he works from the inside out not from the outside in you can get all the outside fixed up to where you look like a scribe and a Pharisee where nobody can lay one thing to your charge but it's still your righteousness his righteousness was paying the price thank you for our flesh for our mind for our sin census that he would be justified in bringing forth that seed to life why predestination why a Lamb's Book of Life he had to make it the word in the beginning in order to bring life through it because if it wasn't it wouldn't bring life and what we have called Christianity Today bobbed hair makeup earrings shorts high heels man smoking cigarettes and and and doing all the things of the world and with the label what Christian he never United with that he couldn't Unite with that that's hybrid Christianity it's not even real genuine Christianity it's not the real thing the real thing had to exist Amen in the beginning he had to know he had because he couldn't Unite with anything that wasn't word so he predestinated the word to be in you so no matter what time he chose uhhuh to unite with it he wasn't uniting with your present condition he was uniting with what he had in the beginning that's why he told him in the beginning it wasn't so he was you not all right I'll use mini handheld he was uniting with what was eternal because eternity can only Unite with eternity if you if if eternity United with something that was carnal it couldn't produce eternal life that's right so if you have eternal life you always had eternal life cuz eternal life can only come from eternal life it's the only thing that can be brought together so he encapsuled you thank you Jesus hallelujah oh I'd like to go into the rest of this part of this we will get to it how Eve would have brought forth that's right but it went a hybrid route but in order to preserve his word he planted it Hallelujah he planted it in Sons and Daughters ERS scattered all throughout time that his word would be preserved and down Through the Ages he United with it and he United with it Wesley's group remember he said that group's going to rise up at the Hybrid can then he said Luther's group's going to rise up against the hybrid Pentecostal is going to rise you get those old Pentecostal fathers that prayed all night they see what they call Pentecost today they nauseate them I think some of those people that really got throw it out of their denominations and everything at this message might be a little upset with what we call the message today people half ashamed of the name of William Brown won't even put the picture of the pillar of fire in their Church won't even play tapes in their Church don't be deceived by that stuff when we know by the word itself that the O The Birth has to come by the word and it has to come by the word of the hour and it has to come by the person that was elected to give the word you can't bypass it what is it that we've got today I say back to the word amen back to the spirit of the word word back to predestination and what it really is so why were you predestinated it answers why you're here you know we don't have to struggle it's all been taken care of we have to overcome ourselves we have to pray for Revelation so he's talking here he says this is paragraph 120 improving his word he says notice it was by his Believers that he proves his word by he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by Believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother see if you he said brother see if you do God will prove prove it so cuz we look and see the others how can we say then see it's the True Believer that proves this word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word now he had the Believers the old crop had died off the the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he's talking about coming into the promised land how many know that's a perfect type where we are right now right now we're at the promised land we're at ready to go in and take every promise every predestinated Power every privilege that's granted to us to restore back to us the Faith of Our Fathers to do the same thing and they've come right up to to the door they don't feel they can take it so they go back to the life in the Pentecostal shock did I turn it off or what yeah they can't they can't get it right they can't get it right just as long as I get it right I'm happy I'm going to be judged for what I say that's going to meet me at the Judgment can you hear me is everything okay so they they they don't want to go forward so they set up camp prophet of God preached a wonderful message called going beyond the camp let the word of God take you out of your comfort zone let him take it beyond your flesh let him take it believe in what that he said will be true oh if you believe it he said the old crop died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he let everyone of them perish why every one of them but believers who was left Moses had been taken to Glory the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children there were only two that crossed over that was the Believers Joshua and Caleb they was the Believers they was the ones who crossed over it its only way God can do it is by his believing children so where are you going to get something to believe with you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity you come in the world speaking lies you're a debor to the flesh where are you going to get something to to believe with not something hybrid but where are you going to get something to believe the original True Word of God with that is contrary to Science Education civilization and everything where are you going to get it from if the word come from eternity that had to come from eternity where are you going to get something to believe with he's got to predestinate it I am going to put in them a seed Something to Believe with that I can connect to cuz I got to use Believers without faith it's impossible to please God faith is a gift of God lest any man can boast so he said where are you going to get this there was believers they was the only ones who crossed over that's the way God can do it is by his believing children you believe that all right his Believers was the ones that done it he used them to cross over with see now I want you to notice he does it that way in in every age now doesn't that make you feel good to be elected to be predestinated to understand what he's chosen you to do what he's chosen you for who would sell that out when you sell out you know what that's called right it's called the Judas Spirit you sell out the word for a temporarily worldly gain oh I I I'd like to say I'm not guilty but the closer I face the reality the more I take heed that it's time I get serious when you're young you think you have all the world ahead of you and you find out that world flies by so fast we're in December already this is the fastest year I think I've ever been through in my life like slow down where do they depict that gold dark guy in in a hood carrying a sickle it's like he's doing a 4240 or something I mean he's moving out you say what's the word say he said he would shorten the days lest no flesh be saved I don't like short days I don't like when it gets dark at four 5:00 whose idea was that we're not children of the dark we're Children of the light I like it to be light till 9 10:00 so I can work it's believing children you believe that all right Believers was the ones that done it he used them to cross over now I want you to notice he does it the same way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take Believers and then in order to have Believers to meet that word hallelujah he's got to pred destinated to that age so you understand why now you can only be born again in the age that you're living cuz you weren't predestinated to receive any other word but the word for this age and that's what that our messenger preached he said let's raise them up out of History let's let's quit quit try trying to clone that's right look back and imitate an age gone by and let him speak a new person into existence in this age Hallelujah something new and fresh and Alive by the word and the message that he sent to be brought to life in this age I don't care how dark you are you can be caveman dark come but if it's in there he'll do whatever it takes to bring it out he'll descend into the lowest hell to find you unbelief does not stop God like I said Paul what an unbeliever man what a revelation he had who are you Lord laying there blind sees a great flash of light and can you imagine when those words are spoke I'm Jesus whom you're persecuting wow I can't believe what I'm doing you know how he just described himself the chiefest of all Sinners Pharisee above Sarah a scribe above all scribes taught in the house of Gia and I counted all dung not worth nothing I was the chiefest of all Sinners but the Lord spoke to him Paul your mind and I'm going to show you what you have to suffer for this gospel say because I have chosen you to bring what you are persecuting to the Gentiles now how would you like to face that message I think the first book that Paul went back and read was the Book of Jonah somebody else who ran from a message someone else who w going to go down there and tell them people what God told him to tell them found himself in the belly of a whale in the bottom of an ocean didn't stop God God spewed them out on the beach coming walking out of the mouth of the god they served hey man you are the voice to this final age you are coming out out of the mouth of the god that you serve you are being spoken into position amen you are being resurrected to life you are now being created by the word that you were predestinated to receive because you have a mission to fulfill and God's got to fulfill fill that mission therefore it was necessary that he predestinated you and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life that you would be eternity you come from God and you go to God let us finish this evening and in order to have Believers to meet the word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you get it did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated to this by his for knowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he came over and predestinated anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestines anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time oh hallel that's why it's predestination it isn't just predestination I chose this one I chose that one it's predestination with a purpose it's predestination with a spirit with an intention with an outcome it's never oh I'm predestinated to be there no you're not predestinated to be there you're predestinated to to carry out the word you carry out the word you'll be there that's right that's right that's right you got to you got to take the word you got to let let him mold it you got to let him build the the the clay he's the Potter you're the clay all mankind lies in front of him as one lump of clay and with nail card guard hands he molds that lump of clay to his purpose sometimes he's got to take that clay and completely break it down and build it up the way that he wants it this is the love of God and another way of Love there is not Church age book beautiful book and when he predestined anything to happen and he says it'll happen he knows the seed will be there at that time he predestinate a bride he had to have an eve she would have never come by anything here the church World cannot produce the bride it's too mixed it's too hybrid the only thing that can reproduce itself is the seed of God it's got to be watered by the spirit and impregnated by the word it's got to be watered by the intention and the purpose for why the word was spoken that's why they'll come to him in that day and say Lord Lord we've done all these things he'll say depart from me you doers of iniquity that's never what I predestinated you to do remember the bride the believer doesn't produce the signs the signs follow those that are following the word they become second nature you never sit back and say I'm going to go pray for this guy and they're going to get well that's a some sort of Glory Seeker but you're living your life at the funeral I was coming up an elevator I had my Bible in my hand a man stepped in the elevator we started to write up he says we got to the bottom floor and I was fixing the step out and he said sir are you a preacher I said yes sir he said will you pray for me my house just just blew up then I didn't I figured insurance would probably take care of it and maybe it wasn't Financial or everything but I felt this is a man that's calling out he arranged that meeting in that elevator everything's in the palm of his hand everything's on his timing can we put our hand on and we bowed our heads there and we prayed I don't even know all that I prayed I just felt something on my heart to pray and we prayed and there seemed to be a peace come over the man and he looked over and he said thank you so much I know it'll be all right and I said I know it'll be all right too and we win our way with him he makes it happen you don't have to make it happen follow he says he knows the seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to breathe there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestinated it by his forn knowledge see there's nothing going to stop it that's why the Lamb's Book of Life that was the necessity of predestination the necessity of predestination wasn't so he could have somebody there it was so he could have somebody here that he could Unite with and become one with and fulfill his word with that is something we ought to be thankful for we ought to be thankful to God that we've heard the voice of life to resurrect us into rapturing condition Lord richly bless you brother Billy amen man aren't you glad you predestinated for a purpose amen he has an intention for you and and things that he wants to see out of us amen that's what we're thankful about let's all stand amen amen spirit of God move write your word in my heart oh fill my whole being
