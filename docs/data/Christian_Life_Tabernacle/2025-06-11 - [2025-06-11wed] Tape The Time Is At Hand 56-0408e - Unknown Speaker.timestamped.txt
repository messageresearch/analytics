[26:52] Oh my god.
[27:09] [Music]
[27:17] [Music]
[27:21] heads. Our gracious Father, Father,
[27:23] we're so thankful that you live today.
[27:25] And
[27:27] we gather in your presence. You said in
[27:29] your word that because you live, we
[27:31] shall live also. Father, we know that
[27:34] you are the very source of life that's
[27:36] in us. Father, you said, "No man can
[27:38] come unto me unless the father has
[27:40] called him." Father, we are here as the
[27:42] elected called people that you have
[27:45] assembled together. And Lord, we've
[27:47] gathered for the bread of life, Lord.
[27:49] And we pray, Father, that you speak to
[27:51] our hearts tonight. Len, Father, when
[27:53] you speak, you speak life, Lord. And and
[27:56] every word that comes out of you is life
[27:59] to the believer. And we pray tonight
[28:01] that that life may be transmitted once
[28:03] again as we listen to your prophet,
[28:06] Lord. May you speak to the needs of each
[28:08] one represented here tonight, Father,
[28:10] that they not there may not be a need
[28:12] that goes out of here without you
[28:14] speaking to it. Because I believe, Lord,
[28:16] that your words has creative power,
[28:18] Lord. When we receive your word is
[28:20] creative power in action to go forth and
[28:23] to defeat the enemy, Father, that we are
[28:25] battling. We commit everything we are to
[28:27] you. We ask that you just take this
[28:29] portion of the service into your hands.
[28:31] Lord, you lead us and guide us. Speak to
[28:33] us. I pray. That's the desires of our
[28:35] heart. We love you and we ask this in
[28:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[28:39] pray. Amen. Amen. and we're going to be
[28:42] listening to a tape and the title of it
[28:45] those headphones and devices that they'd
[28:47] like to be listening to uh from uh it's
[28:50] the time the time is at hand. Um it's
[28:53] only 27 minutes. I believe you'll be
[28:56] blessed. Um I listened to it myself and
[28:59] I was extremely blessed and I was
[29:02] telling brother Matthew in the back I
[29:04] said you know I I I listened to it. I
[29:06] said even if if I was given the same 27
[29:09] minute, it would take me forever to just
[29:12] try to repeat what he said in those 27
[29:14] minutes. So we certainly uh I believe
[29:17] with all my heart you'll be blessed by
[29:19] listening to it. And so um he's going to
[29:22] start reading the Bible and once he's
[29:24] done reading the scriptures, we could be
[29:26] seated and continue on. Amen. God bless
[29:29] you.
[29:33] Now I want to read two parts of the
[29:36] scripture and just take a few moments
[29:39] then we'll start the prayer line cause
[29:42] uh not to take up your time and we're in
[29:44] a hurry to get going back and then pray
[29:47] for some the sick over in St. John the
[29:50] 17th chapter and the first verse these
[29:54] lovely words of our savior.
[29:58] These words spake Jesus and lifted up
[30:01] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[30:05] the hour is come. Glorify thy son. Thy
[30:09] son also may glorify thee." And in
[30:12] Revelations the first chapter and the
[30:15] first two or three verses, the
[30:18] revelation of Jesus Christ, which God
[30:20] gave unto him to show unto the saints
[30:24] things which must shortly come to pass.
[30:28] And he sent and signified it by his
[30:32] angel unto his servant John, whom beare
[30:35] record of the word of God, and of the
[30:38] testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all
[30:41] things that he saw. Blessed is he that
[30:44] readeth, and they that hear the words of
[30:47] the this prophecy, and keep the things
[30:50] which are written therein, for the time
[30:54] is at hand.
[30:57] I would take if it was for a text for
[31:00] just a few moments, the time is at hand.
[31:06] You know, this was the revelation that
[31:09] God gave to his
[31:12] age seer, the last of the prophets of
[31:15] that age of the original pro prophets
[31:19] that was with Jesus. John believed by
[31:22] many theologians to be the John the
[31:24] beloved who leaned on his bosom and he
[31:27] had been exiled out into the aisle of
[31:29] Patmas for the word of God's sake and he
[31:33] was a man who one time after following
[31:37] the Lord Jesus along he was a man who
[31:40] wanted to burn down the city because
[31:43] that they refused to give him some food
[31:45] said shall we call fire out of heaven
[31:48] but how that God had changed him since
[31:51] Christ had left the outside of him and
[31:53] come inside and he was out on the aisle
[31:56] of Patmas known as the the lover of the
[32:00] New Testament John the beloved and
[32:04] exiled out there for preaching the word
[32:07] and he was in the spirit on the Lord's
[32:09] day and God sent an angel and testified
[32:13] to him the things that was to come. In
[32:16] other words, he laid down the fulfilling
[32:19] of all things that's to be met in the
[32:22] last days is prophesied and the book was
[32:26] sealed. Nothing else can be added to it
[32:28] or nothing to be taken away from it. And
[32:31] as we read this marvelous book of
[32:34] Revelations, there's been in my home
[32:36] church. I'd taken once almost a year and
[32:40] a half to go through it slowly each
[32:42] night teaching on just the book of
[32:44] revelation and comparing it with the
[32:47] rest of the Bible and the ages and so
[32:48] forth that had passed on.
[32:52] Now there's time for all things that's
[32:55] an old American slogan and it's true.
[32:58] There's times that when you have to
[33:00] break your ground to plant your crop.
[33:02] There's times that you have to sew your
[33:04] seed. Then there's time that you reap
[33:07] your seed. There's times that nations
[33:09] has to begin. There's times that nation
[33:12] has to end. And the time that every
[33:16] fellow has to come to the time where you
[33:19] make a decision, there's got to be a
[33:21] time where you make your decision of
[33:24] whether you're going to be married or
[33:25] not. Then the decision that you and your
[33:28] girlfriend has to make whether you are
[33:30] going to live together or get married or
[33:33] not. There's all kinds of decisions to
[33:36] be made in life and they'll linger along
[33:39] for a certain period and then a time
[33:42] comes where it's got to be settled.
[33:44] That's the last time. It's got to happen
[33:47] now one way or the other. And Christian
[33:50] friend, I believe that we're living in
[33:53] the end time. That's right. that when
[33:57] all things that was written in the
[33:59] Bible, it's time now for all these
[34:02] things to come to pass. Right? And I
[34:05] believe that the very things that we see
[34:07] happening now, it's just exactly in
[34:11] season with God's word. Now, there was a
[34:14] time when God made the heavens and earth
[34:16] and put man on the earth. And then when
[34:20] man began to multiply and wax great in
[34:23] the earth, building cities and many
[34:26] people began to be fully populated,
[34:29] wickedness set in among the hearts of
[34:31] the people. And the time came where God
[34:35] had to send judgment.
[34:37] God set a time for that judgment. And
[34:40] then he also had a preacher of
[34:44] righteousness by the name of Noah who
[34:46] preached 120 years and was turned down
[34:50] by everyone except his own family. Then
[34:54] the time come that what Noah had
[34:57] prophesied through God must come to pass
[35:00] and the Andolvian destruction taken
[35:02] place and God floated the ark through
[35:06] preserving his self-esteem.
[35:09] There was a time when God spoke to
[35:11] Abraham and told him that his seed would
[35:14] sojourn for 400 years and be evil
[35:18] intreated in a nation, a heathen nation,
[35:20] but he would bring them out with a
[35:22] mighty hand. Now, before that could take
[35:26] place, which God had said, God had to
[35:29] have this nation ready, he had to have
[35:31] the people ready, and then he had to
[35:33] have a Moses ready to to go down there.
[35:37] God makes everything work together,
[35:39] right? Just like cogs coming together.
[35:42] We see it off sometime in a distance and
[35:44] wonder, could it ever be? But it always
[35:47] happens just the way God said it would
[35:50] be. And when the time of the promise
[35:53] drew nigh, there come a Pharaoh who did
[35:56] not know Joseph. And then at the time of
[35:59] the persecution and killing of the
[36:00] little children, God sent Moses, a
[36:03] prophet, came on the scene and miracles
[36:06] and signs begin to happen in the age
[36:10] because the time of that age was
[36:12] finished. There come a time where the
[36:15] Hebrew children had to make a stand
[36:18] whether they were going to bow down to a
[36:20] heathen image or whether they were going
[36:23] to keep their faith in the true and
[36:27] living God. The time came when the
[36:30] decision must be made and they made the
[36:33] right decision and God was with them.
[36:37] The time came when the prophet Daniel
[36:39] had to make a decision or whether he
[36:42] would fail to pray. He would keep the
[36:45] tradition of the religion of that
[36:47] country or whether he would go his
[36:49] regular custom where he had fellowship
[36:51] with God, raise up the windows and pray
[36:54] towards the temple daily. And Daniel had
[36:57] to make his his decision. And the time
[37:02] finally forced him to a place to where
[37:04] he had to make it. God when he speaks
[37:08] anything, he forces it to the place.
[37:10] Amen. And Daniel had to make a decision.
[37:13] And he went straight to this place of
[37:16] worship and raised up the windows and
[37:18] worshiped God. God protected his
[37:21] prophet. God will always do it. There
[37:24] come a time where there had to be the
[37:26] voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[37:28] Isaiah of 812 years before had
[37:31] prophesied that there'd be a voice of
[37:33] one crying in the wilderness. How little
[37:35] did the people know it? How little was
[37:37] they expecting it? the ages had went on
[37:40] and the and the places of the idea of
[37:43] the supernatural and the idea those
[37:46] things had faded from the people's
[37:48] hearts and all of a sudden right out of
[37:52] the blue sky we said it there came a
[37:55] fella out of the wilderness a burly
[37:57] looking fella a preaching repentance and
[38:00] telling the people that the axes laid to
[38:03] the root of the tree and every tree that
[38:05] didn't bring forth good fruit was shed
[38:06] down and cast into the fire and he said,
[38:09] "I indeed baptize you as water and two
[38:11] repentance." But there cometh one after
[38:15] me. Amen. If the people would have been
[38:18] aware of the prophecy of God, they' have
[38:21] known that John was to prepare the way
[38:24] of the Lord according to the prophecy.
[38:27] He said, "I am not he, but there's
[38:30] coming one after me whose shoes I'm not
[38:33] worthy to loose. He will baptize with
[38:35] the Holy Ghost and fire and his fan is
[38:38] in his hand and he'll thoroughly purge
[38:40] his floors and and gather the wheat into
[38:43] the garner and burn the chaff with
[38:44] unquenchable fire. And then come Jesus
[38:48] of Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of
[38:52] him. Just an ordinary looking young
[38:54] fellow of about 30 years old walked out
[38:56] into the water all these years since the
[39:00] time of a child where the angels saying
[39:04] and the magi followed the star. Nothing
[39:07] had been said very much about him. But
[39:09] when he was really to be the son of God,
[39:12] the anointed Messiah, God gave a sign
[39:15] out of heaven. John said, "I didn't know
[39:17] him." But the time had come for who John
[39:21] had been told by to vindicate who the
[39:24] person was. For he said, "He that sent
[39:27] me to baptize as water set up on whom
[39:30] thou shalt see the spirit descending and
[39:33] remaining, he's the one that'll baptize
[39:35] with the Holy Ghost and fire." The time
[39:38] came when that had to come to pass. The
[39:42] time came for Jesus to go into his
[39:44] ministry, for miracles and signs and
[39:47] wonders to be done. The time came for
[39:50] the Pharisees to reject him, the church
[39:52] to turn him down. The time came for the
[39:55] crucifixion. The time came for the
[39:58] revelation. The time came for the
[40:00] resurrection.
[40:02] And all these things has time limits.
[40:05] The time came for the woman who had the
[40:08] blood issue. It'd waited all these years
[40:11] to be healed. She'd went to the doctors
[40:14] for many years. But her issue kept
[40:17] coming forth. The doctors give her
[40:19] medicine and nothing would stop it. But
[40:22] the time came when she had said within
[40:24] her heart, I hear of this one and I
[40:27] believe him to be the Messiah. If I can
[40:29] only touch his garment, I'll be made
[40:32] ever with whole.
[40:34] And if you believe that in your heart,
[40:36] God's obligated then to present that
[40:39] before you if you believe it. Now, what
[40:42] if Jesus would have come and she looked
[40:44] down to the river that morning and see
[40:46] him get out of the boat, tired, weary
[40:48] bunch of man, and she said, "Well, I
[40:51] hear him laughing at him. Maybe I better
[40:52] not go down." Then it'll never happen.
[40:56] But God presented him. And when God
[40:59] presented him, she went and touched and
[41:01] believed because her time was that time.
[41:04] Amen. The time came that when he had
[41:08] told Nathaniel back there, if I told you
[41:11] where you was at or what your name was
[41:13] or so forth and you believe that, you
[41:16] shall it'll be a time when the dead
[41:18] that's in the grave shall hear the voice
[41:21] of the son of God and shall come forth.
[41:24] And the time came for that to happen.
[41:27] And he walked to the grave of Lazarus.
[41:29] And there stood the apostle standing
[41:31] around. And Jesus called a man after
[41:34] being dead four days back to life again
[41:37] because he had said so. Now friends, the
[41:41] time came for the carrying away of the
[41:43] the temple. The time came for the
[41:45] erecting of the abination that maketh
[41:47] desolation. That's spoken by Daniel. And
[41:50] now it's went to the siege. The time has
[41:54] come and passing. For the prophet said,
[41:57] "There'll be a day that it won't be
[41:59] neither dark nor light. It'll be a day,
[42:02] but in the evening time it'll be light."
[42:06] Now, we'll watch civilization travel
[42:08] from the east. China is supposed to be
[42:11] one of the oldest civilizations we have
[42:14] and it travel east going west
[42:16] civilization has. And now we've come
[42:19] plumbed to the west coast and revolve
[42:22] back around. The sun really rises in the
[42:26] east and sets in the west. Now I want to
[42:28] ask you something. If the eastern
[42:31] people, the sun rising in the east
[42:34] certainly shined on the eastern people
[42:36] first and they received a revival and
[42:40] that was the Pentecost that had been
[42:42] prophesied for years and years how God
[42:45] would inaugurate his church and send out
[42:48] a group of people that would do great
[42:50] signs and wonders. And the time came for
[42:53] Pentecost to come. They were gathered in
[42:55] the upper room. They wasn't discussing
[42:58] their religion. They were the one accord
[43:00] in one place. And the time came for the
[43:04] promise of the father as he said through
[43:06] Joel, I'll pour out my spirit in the
[43:09] last days upon all flesh. And the time
[43:12] came and the Bible said when the day of
[43:15] Pentecost had fully come, there came a
[43:18] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[43:20] wind. It filled all the house where they
[43:23] were sitting. Cloven tongues set upon
[43:25] them like as a fire. They were all
[43:27] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[43:30] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[43:31] gave utterance. Out into the streets
[43:34] they went. And Peter standing up began
[43:36] to preach to them. The time had come
[43:39] because God had said so. From that
[43:42] little church went forth signs and
[43:44] wonders and everything. They laid people
[43:47] in the shadow of a man called Peter, a
[43:50] fisherman who could not even sign his
[43:52] own name. The Bible said he was ignorant
[43:56] and unlearned. But they taken heed that
[44:00] he had been with Jesus and they laid
[44:02] people in his shadow and they were
[44:04] healed because God had prophesied
[44:07] through his prophets that these things
[44:09] would take place. That was the breaking
[44:12] of the day in the eastern country. Now
[44:15] he said the prophet said there will be a
[44:17] day that it'll not be night or day.
[44:20] It'll just be kind of a gloomy misty
[44:22] weather. The sun went down, but the sun
[44:25] yet shining through the clouds. If it's
[44:27] cloudy, we yet walk by sunlight, but not
[44:30] the fullness brightness of the light.
[44:32] And then we've come to 2,000 years
[44:36] almost of that kind of a condition where
[44:39] we've had fine churches, organizations,
[44:42] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[44:44] Lutheran, Pentecostals, all different
[44:46] kinds of churches has come up during
[44:48] this time and they've had enough faith
[44:50] to believe that Jesus was the son of
[44:53] God. Enough light to look at the Bible
[44:55] and know that he died for our sins. But
[44:58] what has happened? The people has said,
[45:01] "But the days of miracles has passed."
[45:04] Why? They didn't have the light on it.
[45:06] They couldn't see it because God said
[45:08] they couldn't see it and they could not
[45:11] see it. But the prophet said, "In the
[45:13] evening time, the sun will shine. It'll
[45:17] be light in the evening time." And now
[45:20] here in America, the extreme western
[45:23] country, the greatest of the western
[45:25] civilizations that I believe with all my
[45:27] heart, is now there is breaking forth an
[45:31] oldfashioned Holy Ghost revival just
[45:35] like it was in the beginning with the
[45:37] same type of ministry, same signs and
[45:40] wonders, the same divine healings, the
[45:42] same reaction on the people just like it
[45:45] was in the beginning. For it's the same
[45:48] sun that rose in the east is setting in
[45:51] the west and the time has come for these
[45:53] things to be fulfilled. Amen. And I
[45:56] believe that that's exactly the reason
[45:58] you're seeing things go on the way they
[46:00] are today. It has happened the time.
[46:03] Look, when was the ever in the history,
[46:06] you people who are historians, when was
[46:08] there ever a time that a universal
[46:10] revival started? since the day of
[46:13] Pentecost of the phenomena of divine
[46:17] healing and the powers of the Holy
[46:19] Ghost, the gifts of the spirit. When did
[46:21] it ever happen? Oh, every time they've
[46:24] had a revival in a little place, uh,
[46:26] healings would take place or something
[46:27] like that, just in a little group of
[46:29] people. When the Methodists, uh, when
[46:32] they had a revival, they had divine
[46:34] healing. And the Baptists used to have
[46:36] some divine healing. and uh many of the
[46:39] others we find out that had some signs.
[46:42] But if you'll look friends, this great
[46:45] universal revival, the fires are burning
[46:49] on every hill of every nation in the
[46:52] world. God, right? Great signs and
[46:56] wonders in Korea down there. God raised
[46:59] up some little people down there after
[47:01] that Korean war when they were
[47:04] struggling and having a hard time to
[47:06] make a living. And God has raised up
[47:09] prophets and signs and wonders and a
[47:12] revival that just swept through Korea of
[47:15] an oldfashioned apostolic revival. A man
[47:19] and women who didn't even know the
[47:21] Bible. God is able of these stones, said
[47:24] John, to rise children unto Abraham.
[47:27] We're at the end time. And that's where
[47:30] we're standing today. A universal
[47:32] revival. It's a sign of the coming of
[47:34] the Lord Jesus. He will come and he
[47:38] cannot come until the gospel's been
[47:40] preached into every nation and they have
[47:42] at least not every nation received it
[47:44] but every nation has heard it when this
[47:47] gospel has been preached to every kinder
[47:49] tongue and nation than the end shall be.
[47:51] Amen. I was so amazed to go away into
[47:54] the dark jungles and back into the
[47:57] places of the lands where he sacrifices
[48:00] be made and kill a goat and spread the
[48:04] blood over the people and all the
[48:05] carrying on you ever heard to idols and
[48:08] find missionaries back there. Not not
[48:12] Pentecostal Pentecostal too but
[48:15] Presbyterian and Baptist and Christian.
[48:19] and they had received the Holy Ghost and
[48:22] was doing signs and wonders in the midst
[48:25] of the people. And I said, "Are you a
[48:26] Pentecostal?" Said, "No, brother. I
[48:28] belong to the Christian church." And I
[48:31] said, "You mean the Camelite church?"
[48:33] "Yes." Said, "Our people wouldn't in
[48:36] America, they'd never receive it. But we
[48:38] have found God." What is it? The time
[48:41] has come. Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:44] Look, the time has arrived
[48:48] that God is raised on the scene.
[48:51] The old formal church aid is gone. And
[48:55] the time that God is doing a new thing
[48:58] and he's not only doing it here, he's
[48:59] swept around the world everywhere. Way
[49:03] up into Iceland, into the Eskimos, out
[49:05] into the Indian tribes, way down in
[49:08] South India, Delhi, and in there. And
[49:10] down in there we find signs and wonders.
[49:13] Ministers have starved out there in
[49:16] those jungles of working and preaching
[49:18] and praying. Not long ago I talked to a
[49:21] famous man. He said, "I'd like to show
[49:23] you something on the communist line.
[49:26] Went down into a little place and
[49:28] sitting in there." He said, "I'll show
[49:30] you where they're worshiping." And I'll
[49:32] tell you, it looked like a groundhog
[49:34] hole where they were going down. And
[49:36] when we went into that place, there were
[49:38] people down there praying with their
[49:41] hands up and screaming and shouting and
[49:45] over the place. And I said, "My, all
[49:47] these Pentecostals said, there isn't a
[49:50] Pentecostal among them. There are
[49:52] Presbyterians and Baptists and
[49:54] Methodists and Lutherans and them that's
[49:56] hungered. They've been strained so hard
[49:58] till they've been pressed in till
[50:00] they've got a touch of God and they're
[50:02] hungry and God's filled their hearts
[50:04] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Godl
[50:08] Pentecostal people, we organize. I call
[50:11] myself one of you. Same as the do a
[50:13] Baptist. We've organized oursel and
[50:15] isolated yourself. But the time has come
[50:18] when God broke those barriers down. And
[50:20] he'll do it himself if he We ministers
[50:22] won't take it to him. The time has come
[50:25] and it's at hand now. The time has come
[50:28] for God Jehovah to rise on the scene and
[50:31] show himself. He always does it just at
[50:34] the junctions of time. And that time is
[50:36] now. The lights are shining. It's time
[50:39] now for me to stop preaching. It's time
[50:42] for me to pray for the sick. It's time
[50:44] that God will fulfill his word. Jesus
[50:47] said, "The things that I do will you do
[50:49] also, even more than this, for I go unto
[50:52] my father." It's time for God to prove
[50:55] that this word is truth.
[50:58] Not only a mythical story, not like
[51:01] Buddha. Well, they produce psychology.
[51:04] The Buddhas, the Mamas, and every other
[51:06] kind, they have a psychology with it.
[51:09] But there's not another religion under
[51:11] the skies that can produce the signs and
[51:14] wonders of a resurrected Jesus Christ
[51:16] except the Holy Ghost itself working in
[51:20] the people. Praise God. Our
[51:22] denominations here the other day I read
[51:24] a letter from a sister who was with
[51:27] Billy Graham and I'm down in in Saipan,
[51:30] brother Moore's daughter. Their picture
[51:32] was together in a paper where they had
[51:34] an interview and as soon Mrs. Moore said
[51:37] there Mrs. surprised it is. Now I said
[51:39] when they went in there here they had a
[51:41] missionary place there and they begin to
[51:44] talk and brother Osma was there and said
[51:45] now I having a little talk with him and
[51:48] he said brother Brandham was when I was
[51:51] having a meeting and I seen the angel of
[51:54] the Lord perform something there that
[51:56] night and some people from a famous
[51:59] church the Christian church went around
[52:01] to Mrs. Moore said we are on our way now
[52:05] to America to find brother Brandham to
[52:08] bring him back to Saipan.
[52:11] Said our church sure we wrote to him and
[52:14] told him what had broke out down here.
[52:16] Said we're having a real revival. Said
[52:18] we're praying for the sick signs and
[52:20] wonders and said the Holy Ghost is
[52:21] falling upon our people. They're
[52:23] speaking with tongues and showing great
[52:25] signs and wonders all over the place
[52:27] here. And said we're having a real
[52:29] revival. Hallelujah. The time has come
[52:32] when God has broke the denomination
[52:35] lines and shed forth his holy ghost upon
[52:37] the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[52:40] Lutheran, and all and whosoever will
[52:42] have a humble contrite heart.
[52:44] Hallelujah. The separating time has
[52:46] come. There's a plum line. God, you'll
[52:50] meet one side of the line or the other.
[52:52] You are that way tonight, friends. On
[52:54] one side of the line. The time has come
[52:57] that when you sick people, many of you
[52:59] come here tonight to be healed, the time
[53:01] has come for your healing. I say to you
[53:04] that there's not enough man in this
[53:06] world that could come together and do
[53:09] anything towards divine healing for you.
[53:11] And there's only one healing, and that's
[53:13] divine healing. No other healing at all.
[53:16] Doctors don't heal. They don't claim to
[53:18] heal. They set bones and sew up places,
[53:21] but they don't put calcium and knit the
[53:23] bone together, and neither do they build
[53:25] tissue. and and he heal the arm is cut
[53:28] or whatever it is. They only sew it up
[53:30] and keep it clean while God heals it.
[53:33] That's right. They're God's servants to
[53:35] do so. Just like the man that makes soap
[53:37] to wash your hands with, the same thing.
[53:41] Now, the man that makes an automobile to
[53:43] give you a transportation or an
[53:44] airplane, it's just a goodness of God.
[53:47] But God is a giver of every good thing.
[53:52] Only healing can come through Almighty
[53:54] God. Glory.
[53:57] Yes, sir. I'd like to see the man that
[53:59] if I'd break my arm, I'd lay it out to
[54:01] him, said, "Doctor, heal my arm right
[54:03] quick. I got to continue on my message."
[54:05] Well, he'd think I was crazy. Certainly,
[54:07] he can't do it. He say, "I set your
[54:08] arm." Well, I thought you could heal. If
[54:11] you can heal me, heal me. I want to be
[54:13] healed. He can't. The only thing he can
[54:15] do is say, "Sir, I can set your arm and
[54:17] get it in place." Almighty God has to do
[54:20] the rest. That's right. He might take a
[54:22] pendic out or pull a tooth out, but
[54:24] he'll never heal the place it come from.
[54:26] That's right. It takes God. God builds
[54:28] tissue. God is the only healer. And the
[54:31] time has come that you, my friends, many
[54:33] of you has went to find doctors here in
[54:35] the city, which Chicago is noted for its
[54:37] fine doctors. And I'm so happy for them.
[54:40] and forever clinic and forever hospital.
[54:43] But let me tell you, every time you hear
[54:45] a siren ring, and every time you pass a
[54:48] graveyard, every time you see a gray
[54:50] hair, remember that's God warning you
[54:52] that someday you've got to meet him.
[54:54] You're not here to stay all the time.
[54:56] And I'm happy about it, aren't you?
[55:00] Certainly, the time has come now for us
[55:03] to realize these things. The time has
[55:05] come when God's breaking the boundaries
[55:07] down. And the time has come that the
[55:09] devil is rising up like a a wild lion
[55:12] going about roaring, doing everything he
[55:15] can, but the great battle is being set.
[55:18] I wonder what it would be tonight if we
[55:19] could climb above the heavens of heaven.
[55:21] And look at this great drama is just
[55:23] getting set together now, fixing to come
[55:25] to pass of God and the devil coming to a
[55:28] showdown. I'm so glad I'm on the winning
[55:32] side. I'm so glad that I follow the lamb
[55:35] because he said the lamb overcame them
[55:38] for he was king of kings and lord of
[55:40] lords. The time has come now for you to
[55:43] make a decision tonight what side you'll
[55:45] be on and I trust God that you'll make
[55:48] the decision that you'll follow the
[55:50] lamb. Shall we pray? Our heavenly
[55:52] father, we thank thee tonight because
[55:54] this is the time. Tomorrow may be too
[55:58] late for many people here. It may be too
[56:00] late for some that's sitting here sick
[56:03] and may die. They may be sinners and not
[56:05] know you. And it may be too late in the
[56:08] morning and just think they'll never
[56:10] have another chance as long as eternity
[56:12] rolls on. This may be the last time that
[56:15] you'll give a call to their heart. Oh
[56:18] God in tender mercy, not willing that
[56:21] any should perish but would all come to
[56:23] repentance. I pray thee, heavenly
[56:25] father, that just now that you'll speak
[56:27] to hearts in here about their eternal
[56:30] destination and word they shall spend
[56:32] it. Oh may it come to pass Lord that
[56:35] every heart that you touch will raise
[56:37] their hands and make a decision now and
[56:39] say this is my time and I now come to
[56:43] the Lord Jesus.
[56:53] Amen.
[56:58] Amen. Did you enjoy that? You know, it's
[57:02] so loved how there's so many things that
[57:05] just stood out to me as I was listening
[57:07] to it.
[57:09] It's saying that this is I believe in
[57:12] paragraph 16 it says now it's the time
[57:15] for all things. The old American slogan
[57:18] is true. He says it's there's a time
[57:20] that when you have to uh have to have to
[57:23] break through your ground to plant the
[57:25] crop and there's time that you have to
[57:28] sew your your seed and there's time it
[57:32] says and then there's time that you have
[57:34] to reap your seed. There's time that
[57:37] nation has to begin and there's time
[57:39] that they have to end. And then at the
[57:41] end of paragraph 17, he says, "And and
[57:44] then the time comes when it's got to be
[57:47] settled. It's the last time." It's it
[57:50] says it's got to happen now. One way or
[57:54] the other. And I just thought in my
[57:56] heart and and you know as human we most
[58:00] of the time we tend to think we have a
[58:02] lot of time right you know we we
[58:05] something may happen we living and you
[58:07] feel like well I can do t tomorrow I can
[58:10] do it the other day and you know this is
[58:12] going to come but he's really trying to
[58:14] let you know the moment you hear the
[58:16] word of god that's the time
[58:19] when when when we gather we come we hear
[58:21] the word of god this is the time it's
[58:24] not tomorrow It's not yesterday. It's
[58:26] not after we get out of church. It's the
[58:28] time. It's the time we So, it's whenever
[58:32] you hear the word of God, whether you
[58:34] need healing, you need salvation, you
[58:36] need the moment you hear that there is
[58:39] something there that God can provide for
[58:41] you, you grab that word of God at that
[58:44] time. Amen. We we we we know by the word
[58:47] of God, even as the prophet will say
[58:49] many other places, he said, "We we're
[58:51] not guaranteed tomorrow. we've gathered
[58:54] here. We're not even guaranteed that
[58:55] we're going to get home. So when we hear
[58:58] the word of God, when we receive the
[58:59] word of God, that's the time we make the
[59:02] decision. That's the time we gravitate
[59:04] towards the word of God and receive it.
[59:07] That's the time we hear his voice. The
[59:09] scripture will say that today, if you
[59:11] hear his voice, harden not your heart as
[59:14] in the days of provocation. So it's now
[59:17] the moment you hear the moment the word
[59:19] of God touches your hear that even uh uh
[59:23] it's that time that God is trying to do
[59:25] some something in your life. It's at
[59:28] that time that your heart is being
[59:30] convicted. It's at that time that you
[59:32] can receive. And he said Abraham's seed
[59:34] has already received but one will talk
[59:37] about we we live in a time where there
[59:40] is no more promises that we're going to
[59:43] see some new event uh some new uh sign
[59:46] come. He talked about Abraham's seed
[59:48] having received the last sign. In fact
[59:51] he he talks about how even the very
[59:54] times that's allocated to the gentile is
[59:58] run out. We we live in borrow time. We
[1:00:01] we we we we don't know. We can't say,
[1:00:04] "Well, I haven't seen this prophecy
[1:00:06] come. I'm going to wait until this
[1:00:07] happen."
[1:00:09] There's no time. There's no guarantee
[1:00:11] for what's going to happen. Preparation
[1:00:13] is done when the word of God is
[1:00:15] received.
[1:00:18] So, we we we so we we've he says here in
[1:00:23] uh I believe this is in the message um
[1:00:26] what was the Holy Ghost given for, but
[1:00:28] I'm going to mix the statement. And I
[1:00:29] just copied it in as I was uh listening
[1:00:32] to this message. It just blessed my
[1:00:34] heart. He said, "God is waiting on you
[1:00:37] and me. The church is waiting on you and
[1:00:40] me. Adoption time when God can pour into
[1:00:44] us his fullness."
[1:00:47] So we can't say, "Well, um I haven't
[1:00:50] seen uh this word fulfilled or that word
[1:00:53] come to pass." We know we live in the
[1:00:55] time where all the mysteries have been
[1:00:57] revealed. Yeah, we we have seen the son
[1:01:01] of man revealed. We've seen Luke 17:30.
[1:01:03] We've seen everything. And we couldn't
[1:01:06] go back and say this is not God is and I
[1:01:09] want to say this, God is not withholding
[1:01:12] a certain promise so that you it will
[1:01:15] slow down your progress.
[1:01:18] It it's it's it's really our progress
[1:01:21] and our growth is only uh tied to how
[1:01:24] much we eat and expose ourselves to the
[1:01:27] word of God.
[1:01:29] He he's revealed everything. That's why
[1:01:31] the prophet will say he talks about
[1:01:33] amnesia. He said this God has shaked all
[1:01:37] the possible gifts that could share
[1:01:38] before it could shake before the church
[1:01:40] and the church is still in this state
[1:01:42] where it it's not really understanding
[1:01:45] what's happening. So it's it's an
[1:01:47] understanding that all the mysteries
[1:01:49] have been revealed. All the word of God
[1:01:51] has been made known. Everything that was
[1:01:53] in the book has been made available to
[1:01:55] us. And we will say as the book as the
[1:01:58] prophet will say it's time for us to eat
[1:02:00] of the book and become the book. It's
[1:02:03] for us to believe the message, believe
[1:02:05] the word and become that word and act
[1:02:08] upon that word. So God is not going to
[1:02:11] uh come back or or there's not another
[1:02:13] promise. They say, "Well, you didn't
[1:02:15] know about this promise. I'm here to
[1:02:16] give you a new promise." No, it's the
[1:02:18] fullness of the word of God revealing
[1:02:21] the end time and it's given to the
[1:02:23] believer for them to eat and come into
[1:02:25] the image of that word.
[1:02:28] He says here he says and Christian
[1:02:30] friends I believe we are living in the
[1:02:32] time in the end time that all the things
[1:02:35] that was written in the Bible it's time
[1:02:38] now that all those things come to pass
[1:02:41] and I believe that the very things that
[1:02:43] we are see we see happening now is just
[1:02:47] exactly in season with God's word.
[1:02:52] I I thought you could take that that
[1:02:55] paragraph and and paste it in any age
[1:03:00] and it will be exactly the word of God.
[1:03:04] So it's the word of God coming to pass
[1:03:07] and to the believer they will see it and
[1:03:11] it's it's the eternal word given. All
[1:03:14] you can see and when you see the things
[1:03:16] around you, when you see what's
[1:03:18] happening in the world, you can see that
[1:03:20] this is the fulfillment of what was
[1:03:22] written that we are living in. I can see
[1:03:24] the promises of God happening in the
[1:03:27] church. I can see the promises of God
[1:03:29] happening in the life of the believer. I
[1:03:31] can see the world and see that they're
[1:03:33] fulfilling the things that were promised
[1:03:36] will happen into the world.
[1:03:38] He talks about Noah and at the end of
[1:03:40] paragraph 18 he makes this amazing you
[1:03:44] know he says that um let me just read
[1:03:47] it. It says now there was a time when
[1:03:50] God made uh uh made the heavens and the
[1:03:53] earth and he put men on earth and when
[1:03:55] men began to multiply and watch uh great
[1:03:59] in the earth building cities and many
[1:04:02] people began to uh to fully populate.
[1:04:06] wickedness set in among the hearts of
[1:04:10] the people and the time came where God
[1:04:14] had to send judgment and then he makes
[1:04:17] this statement and said God set a time
[1:04:20] for that judgment.
[1:04:24] I let me say this the wickedness or the
[1:04:28] the the wicked man cannot continually
[1:04:31] prosper forever. Amen.
[1:04:35] You see what I'm saying? We say, "Oh,
[1:04:37] how come the prosperity watch? There's a
[1:04:40] set time that God has in his mind that
[1:04:43] that prosperity will come to an end. The
[1:04:46] world said the world in the shape in the
[1:04:49] form with the things that are happening,
[1:04:51] it cannot last forever. Man is killing
[1:04:54] himself. Man is killing one another."
[1:04:56] All of those things. The the very word
[1:04:59] of God has a set time for everything. So
[1:05:02] when we hear the word of God, we know we
[1:05:05] can look at it and know that this is the
[1:05:07] judgment that's about to happen. This is
[1:05:09] judgment. The element of the judgment
[1:05:12] setting in why because they rejected the
[1:05:15] word of God and the only thing that they
[1:05:17] have left is judgment.
[1:05:20] And we can look at ourselves. I thought
[1:05:22] well maybe believers can also look at
[1:05:24] ourselves and said well it seems like
[1:05:26] you know every day is a struggle. We do
[1:05:28] good and you know but yet you know we
[1:05:30] still are persecuted. Time things get
[1:05:34] difficult and this happen and and that
[1:05:36] happen and this one gets sick and that
[1:05:38] one gets sick and this happen. Let me
[1:05:40] say this that also has an end.
[1:05:45] Your suffering has an end. Amen. Your
[1:05:48] struggle has an end. Your your trouble
[1:05:50] has an end. Your trial has an end. God
[1:05:53] is not going to try you forever. He has
[1:05:55] a set time. when that time comes, you
[1:05:57] will reap the fruits of your your your
[1:06:00] perseverance in the word of God. Amen.
[1:06:03] We don't have to worry. We don't have to
[1:06:04] come and say, well, you know, like you
[1:06:07] know, like we said last Sunday, since
[1:06:09] our father sleep, everything continue.
[1:06:11] It will continue, but there will be a
[1:06:13] time. Let me tell you, when Noah waited
[1:06:17] 150 years, they thought it was crazy for
[1:06:19] sure. But there came a time when it was
[1:06:23] the last time. The scripture says, "Be
[1:06:25] not we be weary in welloing."
[1:06:29] So when we come and we give our lives to
[1:06:31] God, we consecrate ourselves and oh my,
[1:06:34] I tell you this, some people may look
[1:06:36] and say, "Well, I don't go to church as
[1:06:37] much as others, but I don't see the
[1:06:39] difference." Well, wait and see. You're
[1:06:42] going to see the difference one day. You
[1:06:45] Let me say this. This is the true word
[1:06:48] of God. You cannot come into the
[1:06:50] presence day in and day out. You're not
[1:06:52] seeing the change, but change is coming.
[1:06:56] You say, "Well, I don't see I I I'm I'm
[1:06:58] still the same person. I'm still
[1:07:00] struggling. I'm still doing." God has a
[1:07:02] time. You continually come before him
[1:07:05] and come before you. One day, it will be
[1:07:08] the end of your struggle.
[1:07:11] There's a time. Otherwise, he's not a
[1:07:13] just God. He He He will let things go,
[1:07:15] but he's not going to let it go forever.
[1:07:18] The righteous has to reap righteousness.
[1:07:20] the wicked head to reap wickedness.
[1:07:24] But he he lets it happen. You know, I I
[1:07:28] remind I was reminded and now I said I
[1:07:31] was not I'm sorry. I'm getting excited
[1:07:34] up here.
[1:07:36] I I was thinking even with the children
[1:07:39] of Israel, God gets them out and he he
[1:07:42] he keeps them over here and he tells
[1:07:45] them, "Well, you can't go possess the
[1:07:47] land right now because I have to find a
[1:07:49] reason why I would take the these
[1:07:51] people's land and give it to you." He
[1:07:53] says, "Well, I will wait for the
[1:07:55] iniquity to rise. Therefore, I'll have a
[1:07:58] reason and a motive to kick them out so
[1:08:00] you can take the land."
[1:08:03] That's right.
[1:08:05] Is that the Bible?
[1:08:09] So, and I love what he said one place he
[1:08:12] said, let me see if I can find it. He he
[1:08:15] he I think it was talking about Moses.
[1:08:17] Let me just just skip a little bit. Did
[1:08:20] he talk about Moses? Yeah, I think he
[1:08:23] talked about Moses.
[1:08:26] Yeah, I what he talked he started with
[1:08:28] Abraham and then he switched. It says, I
[1:08:30] believe it's paragraph 19. He said now
[1:08:33] before he says now before that could
[1:08:36] take place which God has said God had to
[1:08:40] have God had to have this nation ready.
[1:08:44] He had to have the people ready and then
[1:08:47] he had to have Moses ready. Amen. Think
[1:08:50] about it. It wasn't a hop and chance.
[1:08:53] The children of Israel just didn't
[1:08:55] decide, oh, we need to go out so bad
[1:08:58] now. No. What he did? He let the
[1:09:01] affliction grow. He knew they were going
[1:09:03] to cry out and he knew that with the
[1:09:05] time they were going to cry out, Moses
[1:09:07] also was going to be ready.
[1:09:10] They didn't cry out a minute before or a
[1:09:13] minute later. They cried out at a
[1:09:15] specific time.
[1:09:20] And let me say this, the world will not
[1:09:23] go on. A and as believers, this word of
[1:09:27] God that we have received is given for
[1:09:29] us for us to know that this is the time
[1:09:32] of preparation.
[1:09:35] The word that's been revealed to us is
[1:09:38] to prepare a bride so she could go into
[1:09:40] the rapture. And it's for us to take the
[1:09:44] word. I just read that parag says God is
[1:09:47] waiting upon you and me. He's waiting.
[1:09:48] What is he doing? He's given us the
[1:09:51] message. He's given us before the
[1:09:53] judgment can come in, God has given us
[1:09:55] this word of God for the believers to
[1:09:58] eat and be ready for that when judgment
[1:10:01] will fall, we will we'll be gone. But we
[1:10:04] can't say, well, you know, I still got
[1:10:07] time. I'm not going to get ready now and
[1:10:09] then I'll wait until the end. You can't
[1:10:12] do that
[1:10:14] because it could happen tomorrow
[1:10:17] morning. It could happen anytime. The
[1:10:19] time is God's time. It's not our time.
[1:10:22] We as believers, we've only been given
[1:10:25] the word to have to eat of the word to
[1:10:28] get ready so that when the word of God
[1:10:31] when t time comes, God will take it,
[1:10:33] will take us away. He says that they go
[1:10:36] down. He says God makes everything work
[1:10:40] together, right? Just like a cog coming
[1:10:43] together.
[1:10:47] Something will happen in your heart. You
[1:10:49] feel like, "Oh, I feel like doing this."
[1:10:51] Who is it? Is it God moving in you? Oh,
[1:10:54] I feel like praying. You You in in the
[1:10:56] middle of the night at 3:00 a.m. you all
[1:10:59] of the sudden you wake up
[1:11:01] for no reason. There's no sleep. What is
[1:11:04] it? It's God calling to you. All you you
[1:11:07] you go out all of the sudden somebody
[1:11:09] comes on your heart. Is God trying to
[1:11:12] talk to you? What is it? It's God. Those
[1:11:14] are the things as believers we have to
[1:11:16] know. It's the sign that God is setting
[1:11:20] a time or he's trying to contact me for
[1:11:22] something. The word is given so we can
[1:11:25] receive it. He says this, we set it off.
[1:11:28] It says, "Sometimes in the distance I
[1:11:30] wonder could I ever be? What if uh but
[1:11:33] if I always, it says, but it always
[1:11:36] happened just the way that God said he
[1:11:37] would. And when the time of the promise
[1:11:40] drew nigh, they came a pharaoh who did
[1:11:42] not know who who did not know Joseph.
[1:11:45] And then at that time of the persecution
[1:11:47] and the killing of the little children,
[1:11:50] God sent Moses, a prophet came on the
[1:11:52] scene, a miracle and miracle and signs
[1:11:55] begin to happen in the age. It says
[1:11:59] because the time of the age was
[1:12:03] finished.
[1:12:06] I believe one of them said someplace
[1:12:07] that God always send the messenger of
[1:12:10] the age at the end of the age.
[1:12:13] Amen.
[1:12:14] Now, if it's the end of the age, how far
[1:12:17] are we from the end of the age?
[1:12:24] So, it's either we understand God's way
[1:12:27] of doing things and we understand that
[1:12:30] it's time because his believing
[1:12:32] children, they are made within. God has
[1:12:35] made them so they can know it's the time
[1:12:38] they are made. I was fellowshipping with
[1:12:40] brother Benoa. How brother Benham talks
[1:12:43] about uh I believe it was the birds and
[1:12:46] the animal in India. Yeah, they are in
[1:12:49] the middle of the hot sun. All of the
[1:12:51] sudden all the animals they move away
[1:12:54] from buildings and they were gather up
[1:12:57] somewhere in the middle of nowhere, no
[1:13:00] shades.
[1:13:03] And all the humans are looking at them
[1:13:04] and says these animals are losing their
[1:13:06] mind. How can they move away from
[1:13:09] buildings and trees and things that can
[1:13:11] protect them and go stand right on? Why?
[1:13:14] Because Baranam said God built them with
[1:13:16] an instrument that they knew something
[1:13:18] was coming.
[1:13:21] Oh, aren't you glad you have an
[1:13:22] instrument tonight? And I want to say,
[1:13:25] trust that instrument. Trust that
[1:13:27] instrument. It's God energizing you and
[1:13:30] getting you ready for what's to come.
[1:13:32] You don't want to uh uh uh ignore the
[1:13:35] instrument and say, "Well, everybody
[1:13:37] else is also doing this." No,
[1:13:39] everybody's not going where you going.
[1:13:45] The place that's we going is for
[1:13:47] believers, those that have the
[1:13:49] instruments. Because now the the thing
[1:13:52] that happened is this. Even though
[1:13:54] everyone will hear the voice, but not
[1:13:57] everyone will register it for what it
[1:13:59] really is.
[1:14:03] You see what I'm saying? Everybody will
[1:14:05] hear. How many people heard the message?
[1:14:08] How many people followed the message?
[1:14:10] How many people came from the signs and
[1:14:12] wonders? How many people came and and
[1:14:15] saw and even said this was a great man
[1:14:17] of God, but they actually never follow
[1:14:20] the things that that great man of God
[1:14:22] said to them. Right.
[1:14:25] In fact, the debate was there always
[1:14:27] that he he yes, God was with him, but
[1:14:30] when he came to his doctrine,
[1:14:33] he was off the scripture. I it saw me
[1:14:36] another man that God was with that that
[1:14:39] he would be with him, but yet it was off
[1:14:41] the scripture. And he a man who would
[1:14:43] send and say, "If what I just told you
[1:14:45] is the word of God, then he will come
[1:14:47] and vindicate it. But if I tell you is
[1:14:49] not the word of God, then he won't come
[1:14:51] and vindicate it." Amen.
[1:14:57] He talks about the Hebrews children. It
[1:14:59] says paragraph 20 says there came a time
[1:15:02] where the Hebrews children make their
[1:15:05] stand whether they were uh going to bow
[1:15:08] down uh to hidden images or whether they
[1:15:11] were going to keep their faith in the in
[1:15:14] the true um and living God. The time
[1:15:17] came
[1:15:19] when the decision must be made.
[1:15:22] I mean, there's no room. And here's the
[1:15:25] thing I I I always feel about us as
[1:15:27] humans. We feel like if if I decide to
[1:15:32] delay my decision, it means I didn't
[1:15:34] make a decision. Well, you made a
[1:15:37] decision to delay. It's a decision.
[1:15:43] God wants to do something. Well, I not
[1:15:46] now. I I'm only going to do it if I do
[1:15:48] this. If I gather up this then. No. If
[1:15:50] God wants to use you, he wants to use
[1:15:53] you today.
[1:15:55] If you're going to give your heart to
[1:15:56] the Lord, it's today. It's now. It's not
[1:15:59] when you go home. Young people, you
[1:16:01] don't say, "Oh, you know, I'm too young
[1:16:03] to give my heart. I need to do." No,
[1:16:05] it's now. Yes, sir. That's how God
[1:16:07] works. The moment when you hear his
[1:16:10] voice and he convicts your heart and he
[1:16:12] talks to your heart. That's the moment
[1:16:14] to make a decision. It says and they
[1:16:16] made a dec and then it says and they
[1:16:18] made the right decision and God was with
[1:16:21] them. The time came when the prophet
[1:16:24] Daniel had to make a decision whether he
[1:16:27] would fail to uh to pray uh he would
[1:16:30] keep the tradition of the of the
[1:16:32] religion of the country or whether he
[1:16:34] will go his uh regular custom um where
[1:16:38] he had fellowship with God raised up the
[1:16:42] window. He says raised up the windows
[1:16:44] and and and sprayed toward the and pray
[1:16:47] towards the temple daily. And Daniel had
[1:16:50] to make his decision and the time
[1:16:53] finally forced him to make to to the the
[1:16:59] the time came I'm sorry Daniel had to
[1:17:02] make his decision and the time finally
[1:17:05] forced him to take a place to where he
[1:17:09] had to make it. Now he says he makes
[1:17:11] this statement 21 God makes God when he
[1:17:15] speaks anything he forces it to the
[1:17:20] place
[1:17:23] when you hear the word of God it's
[1:17:25] forcing you to make a decision am I
[1:17:28] going to receive this am I going to
[1:17:30] actually accept what's being so spoken
[1:17:33] am I am I going to receive this in my
[1:17:35] heart it's not later it's now when you
[1:17:37] hear it you hear the word of God it's
[1:17:40] You are making whether you you you you
[1:17:43] consciously or unconsciously you are
[1:17:46] making a decision at that time.
[1:17:50] And aren't you glad you've already made
[1:17:52] your decision. I love what he said. He
[1:17:54] said, you know, Satan is there. It's a
[1:17:56] showdown time. Satan is on one side and
[1:17:58] God is on and they're battling all
[1:18:00] together. He said, I'm so glad I'm on
[1:18:02] the winning side. Why? Because my
[1:18:05] decision is included in this decision
[1:18:07] that he already chose me before the
[1:18:09] foundation of the world. All I'm doing
[1:18:11] here, I'm just playing out the decision
[1:18:14] that was already made for me. When I
[1:18:16] hear his word, something in my heart
[1:18:19] causes me to choose what he wants me to
[1:18:21] do.
[1:18:26] If the musician could come
[1:18:45] He says
[1:18:48] he talks about he talks about John the
[1:18:52] Baptist and they said they asked John
[1:18:55] and they said how are you going to know
[1:18:57] him how when are you going to know it's
[1:18:59] the time he said I don't know
[1:19:02] but when the time came he said the
[1:19:04] spirit came down and he spoke to him and
[1:19:07] he said to whom you will see the spirit
[1:19:10] descend upon upon then you will know
[1:19:11] that's him.
[1:19:14] And I believe that's the same way we're
[1:19:16] going to know. How are we going to know
[1:19:17] it's rapture? When the spirit spoke
[1:19:20] speaks to you and tells you this is the
[1:19:21] time, you're going to know it's the
[1:19:23] time. Why? Because that same spirit
[1:19:26] that's been preparing you, that same
[1:19:28] spirit will speak to you. He says indeed
[1:19:31] uh uh indeed he said I baptized you with
[1:19:35] water unto repentance but there comes
[1:19:38] one after me.
[1:19:41] He says if the people would have would
[1:19:43] have been aware of the prophecy of God
[1:19:46] they would have known that John was was
[1:19:48] to prepare the way of the Lord according
[1:19:51] to the prophecy. Now aren't you glad you
[1:19:55] know who the Elijah was in the end time?
[1:19:58] Now, it's not by your own knowledge, but
[1:19:59] it was because it was revealed to you
[1:20:01] for you to know. He said, "And I said,
[1:20:04] I'm not he, but there's one coming after
[1:20:07] me whose shoes I'm not worthy to lose.
[1:20:10] He will baptize with a Holy Ghost and
[1:20:13] fire, and his f is in his hand, and he
[1:20:16] will he will uh thoroughly purge his uh
[1:20:19] his floor, and gather the wheat unto the
[1:20:22] gardener gardener, and burn the shaft
[1:20:25] with the unquenchable fire. He speaks of
[1:20:28] Jesus. It says that the time came that
[1:20:31] Jesus had to go into his ministry for
[1:20:35] miracles and signs and wonders to be
[1:20:37] done. It came for the Pharisees to
[1:20:40] reject him, the church to turn him down.
[1:20:43] The time came for the crucifixion. The
[1:20:45] time came for the res for the
[1:20:47] revelation. The time came for the
[1:20:50] resurrection. And the time of these
[1:20:53] things and then and these and all these
[1:20:56] things has time limits.
[1:21:02] Nothing will go forever.
[1:21:04] All everything that we are seeing
[1:21:08] is for a set time.
[1:21:11] And I love this. It talks about the
[1:21:13] woman with the blood issue. says now
[1:21:16] what if it says she came um
[1:21:22] it said here let me just read from the
[1:21:23] top it says the time came for the woman
[1:21:26] who had the blood issue paragraph 24
[1:21:28] yeah h had waited all these years to be
[1:21:33] healed she had went to the doctors for
[1:21:35] many years but her issue kept coming
[1:21:39] forth the doctor gave her medicine and
[1:21:42] nothing would stop it. But the time came
[1:21:45] when she had uh said within her heart, I
[1:21:49] love this. I hear this one and I believe
[1:21:52] him to be the Messiah. And if I can only
[1:21:56] touch his garment, I'll be made I'll be
[1:21:59] I'll be made ever with whole. And then
[1:22:01] it says, "And if you believe that in
[1:22:04] your heart, God's obligated then to
[1:22:08] present that before you if you believe
[1:22:11] it.
[1:22:14] I I I love that. Now, God presented this
[1:22:19] message before you so you can believe
[1:22:21] it. You didn't you didn't stumble across
[1:22:24] it. You didn't fall on the message. No,
[1:22:27] God presented this message before you so
[1:22:30] you could believe it. You heard
[1:22:32] everything else. There was nothing that
[1:22:34] would satisfy. But God knew that, okay,
[1:22:37] that's my son. That's my daughter. My
[1:22:39] sheep hear my voice. when I present them
[1:22:41] to the when I present you had a hunger
[1:22:44] within yourself like this woman you were
[1:22:46] searching and looking for. She was
[1:22:48] looking and just hungering but God knew
[1:22:51] that when he would present it before her
[1:22:54] because of the belief that was within
[1:22:56] her heart she would believe.
[1:23:00] God presented the message. He presented
[1:23:03] his word before us.
[1:23:06] And I want to say this, if that's the
[1:23:08] case, then let's not waste any time.
[1:23:12] Then let's believe it with everything
[1:23:13] that's in us. Then let's give it our
[1:23:16] all. Let's not waste any moment. The
[1:23:19] time is too short. We don't know how
[1:23:21] long we got. Whatever time is allocated,
[1:23:23] we want to say, God, this is the time
[1:23:26] you've given us, and we're going to put
[1:23:28] everything in it to serve you with it.
[1:23:31] Why? Because the time is at hand.
[1:23:33] whatever you have need of this word of
[1:23:35] God. It didn't come so we can say well
[1:23:38] you know God will do he did yesterday
[1:23:41] but then he will do tomorrow. He said
[1:23:43] that's the issue with men. They will
[1:23:44] take God. They will recognize what he
[1:23:46] did in the past. They will recognize
[1:23:48] what he's going to do in the future but
[1:23:50] they will fail to realize what he's
[1:23:52] doing in the midst.
[1:23:57] The time is now. The time is today.
[1:24:00] Whatever it is that we have need of,
[1:24:03] it's today. Whatever it is that we need
[1:24:05] to be ready, it's now. It's today. It's
[1:24:08] in the word. It's not tomorrow. Let's
[1:24:11] all stand.
[1:24:18] Oh my. There's so much. He makes a
[1:24:20] statement at the end. Let me just read
[1:24:22] it. He says this,
[1:24:26] "The time has come now that you must
[1:24:28] make a decision what side you'll be on."
[1:24:33] It says, "And I trust that God will make
[1:24:36] the decision. I trust that you will make
[1:24:39] a decision
[1:24:41] that you will follow the lamb."
[1:24:43] But when I'm says
[1:24:46] the people of this age, people of this
[1:24:48] time, they are making their decision.
[1:24:51] They are making their choices. They said
[1:24:53] the devil on one end by deception,
[1:24:57] he's calling forth his people. But it
[1:25:00] God is by the revealing of his word, by
[1:25:03] the life that's being manifested, is
[1:25:06] also calling his people. And right now
[1:25:08] as we are gathered here tonight, we are
[1:25:12] making a decision. You made a decision
[1:25:14] to come to church. You made a decision
[1:25:17] that it's a Wednesday. I'm not going to
[1:25:19] stay home. I'm going to hear the word of
[1:25:20] God. You made that decision today. You
[1:25:24] make that decision every Sunday. Every
[1:25:27] Wednesday you make I'm here to tell you
[1:25:29] that you make your decision now. That
[1:25:32] decision is counting in God's economy.
[1:25:35] You you you're not here. Don't just
[1:25:38] think, oh, I I come and there's nothing
[1:25:40] that's happening. No, it's building up
[1:25:42] to something. You may not see it. You
[1:25:44] may not understand it, but it's building
[1:25:46] up to something. The time will come when
[1:25:50] all the efforts, everything. But when
[1:25:52] I'm said that there's never been a man
[1:25:54] that borrowed anything to God that God
[1:25:56] has never return 100fold.
[1:25:59] If we will give him our time, if we'll
[1:26:01] give him everything that we are, if
[1:26:02] we'll sacrifice and make all of that,
[1:26:05] God is obligated that one day there's
[1:26:08] going to come a time where he says,
[1:26:10] "This is the end. And this is the time
[1:26:12] for me to reward all those faithful
[1:26:15] believers, all of those that placed that
[1:26:17] did all that they could for them to come
[1:26:20] and receive my word. Now it's time for
[1:26:22] my word to fight for them. Now it's
[1:26:24] time. You know, you heard brother David
[1:26:26] talk so many times and say, you know,
[1:26:28] you probably going into difficult times
[1:26:30] and something has said, uh, you know,
[1:26:32] you don't you don't know how you're
[1:26:33] going to pay your bills. Who pays your
[1:26:35] bill? Who shows up to come and rescue
[1:26:38] you in that time? Who saves you from the
[1:26:41] accident? Who saves you from all of
[1:26:42] that? It's God. And you ask yourself,
[1:26:45] why is he doing it? He's He's there
[1:26:47] because he has a time appointed for you
[1:26:50] to come into his presence and get to
[1:26:53] know him. And nothing is going to stop
[1:26:55] that. It's him protecting his elected
[1:26:58] believers. And it's for us to come and
[1:27:01] for the time that we have, we give it to
[1:27:03] him so he could be manifested. Is that
[1:27:05] your heart desire tonight? Amen.
[1:27:09] Let's just sing now. Oh, and beyond this
[1:27:13] flesh
[1:27:15] that you can see now,

[1:27:47] the love of God for my soul down inside
[1:27:52] of me. When I hear the word,
[1:27:56] my heart says,
[1:27:59] "Amen."
[1:28:03] I say, "Amen.
[1:28:08] Oh, and beyond this place
[1:28:13] that you can see now
[1:28:16] we are born with blessings
[1:28:20] of this friend. Oh, and there is a

[1:28:54] heart say
[1:28:57] amen.
[1:29:00] I say amen.

[1:29:08] place,
[1:29:10] but you can't see now.
[1:29:13] Beyond the weak places
[1:29:16] of this bread. Oh, and there is a
[1:29:20] connection.
[1:29:22] Oh, he is.
[1:29:25] Oh, Jesus Christ.
[1:29:31] Oh, I know how. Oh, and I don't know
[1:29:36] why.
[1:29:37] I cannot explain
[1:29:40] the love of God for my soul down inside
[1:29:45] of me. When I hear the word
