[14:54] whisper there's no place here for her
[15:01] kind still on she came through the shame
[15:06] that flushed her
[15:08] face until at last she knelt before his
[15:16] feet and though she spoke no
[15:20] words everything she said was
[15:24] her as she poured her love forth the
[15:27] master
[15:30] from her box of

[17:01] days pouring my life without measure
[17:05] into a little treasure box I thought I
[17:11] had
[17:14] found
[17:15] until the day when Jesus came to me and
[17:21] healed my soul with the wonders of his
[17:27] touch so now I'm giving back to him all

[19:01] [Music]
[19:12] P amen
[19:15] wonderful man let's all stand at this
[19:18] time let's sing that song we sang the
[19:20] other day you can't cross the Rood line
[19:23] as we invite our pastor at this time
[19:26] amen amen
[19:30] man let's start with the course maybe
[19:32] that's
[19:35] easy oh I just got to tell you
[19:41] Satan you can't cross the
[19:46] bloodline CU I'm covered by his
[19:51] blood
[19:53] oh and you may save and you may find
[19:58] you're going to lose this battle tonight
[20:02] we
[20:04] remember you came just sing it one more
[20:07] time
[20:09] oh and I just got to tell you Satan you
[20:16] can't cross the
[20:19] bloodline cuz I'm covered by his
[20:25] blood oh and you may stand and you may
[20:31] fight you're going to lose this battle
[20:35] tonight oh
[20:37] remember you can't sing that first
[20:42] ver
[20:44] oh even though my spirit
[20:48] L and it seems I can hardly go but still
[20:53] I
[20:55] see victory
[21:00] oh many times I'm walking by faith I can
[21:06] see what lies before me still I
[21:11] see
[21:14] Victory
[21:16] oh and I just got to tell you Satan
[21:22] [Music]
[21:50] amen amen Satan is one Underdog I don't
[21:53] root
[21:54] for you know I've got Underdog syndrome
[21:58] that means even if my favorite team's
[22:00] playing I all of a sudden start feeling
[22:03] sorry for the
[22:04] underdog you know but now I found an
[22:09] underdog I don't root for he's the
[22:12] biggest Underdog of them all he's a
[22:15] loser he's already lost he's got nothing
[22:19] to bring to the table in fact he has a
[22:23] title the father of
[22:26] lies and there's no truth in him that's
[22:30] quite a testimony he's got right so why
[22:33] would we even listen to
[22:35] him right I remember one time I prayed
[22:39] for somebody and they came up to me and
[22:41] says Satan keeps telling me I ain't
[22:44] going to make
[22:45] it I thought
[22:47] really that tells me one thing you're
[22:50] already there cuz he's a liar right amen
[22:55] I like that song let's turn in our
[22:57] Bibles tonight I won't keep you long
[22:59] tonight uh uh as you're turning I'll let
[23:03] you know my my mom is uh well I guess
[23:08] the only way to say it is is that we
[23:11] know she's got a lot of ears and and
[23:14] she've just kind of
[23:16] started uh her decline if I could say it
[23:19] that way she's not sick she's just got
[23:22] 100 and a couple years uh that she's
[23:26] lived and her body
[23:28] isn't um going like it used to she did
[23:33] very good for a lot of years she's still
[23:34] sharp of course she doesn't have the
[23:37] energy and she doesn't have the appetite
[23:40] she had so uh we know that we're facing
[23:44] our our last time uh with her um it
[23:49] could be days it could be weeks could be
[23:53] months but it's not going to be very
[23:57] long so I certainly ask for your prayers
[24:01] and your understanding because I'm going
[24:04] to try to be out there as much as I can
[24:07] and and I know we have such capable
[24:10] ministry here that um uh it allows me to
[24:16] uh maybe be gone just a little bit so
[24:20] anyway uh just keep us in prayer it's
[24:23] kind of an emotional strain you know
[24:25] being there and and everything and very
[24:28] very tiring so um I am a little weary
[24:32] but I just have a little thought I I had
[24:34] something on my heart I wanted to preach
[24:36] and then I visited with Matthew and
[24:40] Matthew kind of gave me some words and
[24:42] thoughts so I've provided for him for
[24:45] lots of years so I stole this thought
[24:47] from
[24:49] Matthew so that's what ministers do
[24:53] right is we steal each other's sermons
[24:56] that's what they do prophet of God said
[24:58] many a time he'd listen to a sermon and
[25:01] he'd get a strike of
[25:02] inspiration from it so this is just a
[25:05] simple thought tonight something that uh
[25:10] I I want to sew in your hearts so um it
[25:15] would be like a tool you could use and
[25:19] uh if
[25:21] I um I had a sermon title uh maybe I
[25:26] could call it the reason to read listen
[25:31] and
[25:32] pray the reason to read listen and pray
[25:37] and I hope that I can just give you a
[25:39] little uh thought to do it so if you
[25:41] have your Bibles let's turn to a very
[25:44] familiar
[25:45] scripture um and uh it's found in
[25:50] Malachi uh 4 and we'd like to read it
[25:54] and then we'd like to read a scripture
[25:57] in uh St
[26:00] John
[26:06] um um
[26:08] 39 and just read a few scriptures there
[26:11] so I'm sure you already know this
[26:13] scripture by heart you probably didn't
[26:14] have to turn there um but um we like
[26:19] reading that out of the pages it said
[26:22] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[26:27] which I commanded
[26:29] un unto him in
[26:32] harb for all
[26:35] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[26:39] said behold I will send you Elijah the
[26:42] prophet before the coming of the great
[26:46] and Dreadful day of the
[26:48] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[26:52] fathers to the children and the hearts
[26:55] of the children to their fathers
[26:58] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[27:02] curse and U now I'd like to just point
[27:06] one little thing that he shall he
[27:10] shall okay he's the one okay we to hold
[27:15] that thought and then over here in St
[27:18] John the uh fifth chapter and the 39th
[27:23] verse it says
[27:31] um he says search the
[27:34] scriptures so what's he telling them to
[27:37] do search the
[27:39] scriptures for in them ye think ye have
[27:43] eternal
[27:44] life and they are they which
[27:48] testify of
[27:50] me and ye will not come to me that you
[27:54] might have life I receive not honor from
[27:59] men but I know ye that ye have not the
[28:04] love of God in you I am come in my
[28:08] father's name and you receive me not if
[28:12] another shall come in his own name him
[28:16] ye shall receive how can you believe
[28:20] which receiveth honor one of another and
[28:24] seek not the honor that Cometh From God
[28:28] God
[28:29] only amen Heavenly Father we ask you to
[28:33] bless the scriptures in jesus' name we
[28:36] pray amen you may be
[28:42] seated I'd also like to read a little uh
[28:45] statement tonight I'd like to uh greet
[28:48] all our visitors that are here and
[28:51] tonight Lord be with you and our brother
[28:54] from South Africa you you're hiding
[28:57] there somewhere
[28:59] all right good to have you we have you
[29:02] on the
[29:03] schedule so uh I'm giving you notice and
[29:07] you can ask all the ministers in the
[29:09] church I never give anybody
[29:12] notice I read a scripture that said be
[29:15] instant in season and out of season and
[29:18] I just thought I might as well apply
[29:19] that to everybody so uh I always tell
[29:23] the guys if you ever come over to hang
[29:25] out just remember there's one thing I do
[29:27] is work so always be ready to work right
[29:30] so we we like it this is a statement
[29:33] that um I I looked at in a little
[29:36] different light than I've looked at it
[29:40] before and um I I I trust it's a
[29:44] blessing um if I I just want to give you
[29:47] something tonight that you could uh
[29:50] maybe remember a little motivating or a
[29:54] tool to work with and remember Jesus
[29:58] says this in perfect
[30:00] faith and it says he said now he's
[30:04] talking about the story is about you
[30:07] know that there was a uh a a person that
[30:12] uh that had a uh an Affliction and the
[30:17] disciples couldn't move it and U and so
[30:23] uh Jesus uh kind of uh he did scold him
[30:29] I don't think that's what wasn't a
[30:32] rebuke but I think he was really
[30:34] pointing out something to them he said
[30:37] oh ye of little
[30:39] faith oh ye of little faith so I think
[30:43] he was trying to say something to them
[30:45] like you're lacking something okay and
[30:50] um uh so but then our prophet in
[30:54] explaining that goes on to take it in
[30:58] maybe a little different
[31:01] Viewpoint than we would um uh think and
[31:06] I and I want to look at in a little
[31:08] different
[31:09] Viewpoint um that he says he says now he
[31:13] says now remember they had the
[31:16] word so Jesus told them right go out uh
[31:21] uh L your hands on the sick cast out
[31:23] Devils if someone doesn't receive you
[31:25] shake the uh the
[31:29] you know dust off your feet and uh and
[31:33] they were
[31:34] rejoicing uh because the of the Miracles
[31:37] that they saw like uh he said I saw
[31:40] Satan falling you know like a star
[31:43] falling from heaven and and he makes a
[31:46] remarkable statement he says don't
[31:48] rejoice in all the work you done but
[31:51] rather Rejoice because your name was
[31:54] written in
[31:55] heaven so uh there was something that
[32:00] existed that they didn't
[32:04] know and I think the reason that he sent
[32:07] them out was for the purpose that they
[32:11] might come to the
[32:15] understanding that their names
[32:18] was written in heaven that there was
[32:22] something that was greater than uh uh
[32:28] The Works that they
[32:29] saw okay so it was already there wasn't
[32:33] it so it was already written in heaven
[32:36] their names were okay so in my little
[32:39] thought if you'll just take these little
[32:41] pieces and help me put them
[32:44] together he says now remember they had
[32:46] the word and the Word was flesh then and
[32:51] the word told
[32:54] them I give you power
[32:58] amen I give you power and they had the
[33:02] power so they they had the power was
[33:06] given to them they had the power is that
[33:08] right but they didn't have faith to
[33:12] operate the
[33:13] word that was in them and and then we go
[33:19] on uh he says see what I mean but Jesus
[33:25] had it he was the word and he had faith
[33:29] that what he said would happen he said
[33:32] oh bring him here how long will I suffer
[33:36] you and uh we could go on reading but I
[33:39] I I want to uh have a a little thought
[33:44] uh uh uh here and and I've already given
[33:48] um Matthew all the credit he's going to
[33:50] get so uh we're just going to go on
[33:53] because it's all in the word of God
[33:55] right and really none of us ever uh
[34:01] created the word of God a lot of people
[34:04] try to invent the word of God but the
[34:07] word of God is not made to be
[34:11] invented it it it's not made to be
[34:16] created but it's made to be
[34:21] discovered okay so the the faith they
[34:24] had the power but they hadn't
[34:28] discovered the faith to use the power
[34:33] and and so uh the the word discovered uh
[34:40] and I'm I'm going to try to do something
[34:42] I've always tried to do is preach a
[34:44] 25 20 to 25 minute sermon because
[34:48] brother Ram said they were the best and
[34:50] I've never preached the best sermon you
[34:52] know what I mean I had a good friend of
[34:55] mine tell me one time after I preached
[34:57] he say you're never going to preach any
[34:58] better than that and I
[35:01] thought should I continue
[35:04] on you know and then you sometimes you
[35:07] preach for years and somebody'll come up
[35:09] that's the best I ever heard you preach
[35:11] and then you think well man how how
[35:13] lousy were my other sermons you know so
[35:17] uh but we don't measure uh the how it's
[35:20] delivered we go by one thing in anyway
[35:24] is we live by
[35:25] truth so it's not how it's said it's
[35:30] what is said and and we want something
[35:34] that that said that strengthens us and
[35:37] fortifies US gives us some insight um it
[35:41] it doesn't have to be a a great thing uh
[35:45] sometimes the smallest tool does the the
[35:49] biggest job and he said like a watch he
[35:53] said you know it's the smallest little
[35:55] spring that causes is the thing to work
[35:58] so you wouldn't have the big picture
[36:02] without the little teeny uh Springs and
[36:06] little uh things that go together to
[36:09] make it work so we just want to give you
[36:12] one so uh I I was talking about these
[36:16] guys as he talks about these disciples
[36:19] they had the power so it was not
[36:23] something that they didn't have but it
[36:27] it
[36:29] existed but so uh you when you discover
[36:34] something you you you're not finding
[36:37] something that doesn't
[36:40] exist you understand it's already there
[36:43] it already exists and so I think what
[36:47] Jesus was really wanting them
[36:50] to discover was their
[36:54] election and that their name was written
[36:57] in the Lamb's Book of Life that was
[37:00] really what he was after because if we
[37:03] would go on to read further he talks
[37:05] about he says to him he says now Jesus
[37:09] believed who he was he believed who God
[37:12] said he was he had faith in what he knew
[37:16] he had faith in his position that's
[37:18] because he discovered it and other words
[37:22] he found it right okay and and when you
[37:27] discover something something is you come
[37:28] across it uh maybe accidentally or when
[37:32] you're searching for something or you're
[37:34] looking for something you come across
[37:37] something and we call that Discovery oh
[37:40] I discovered this I didn't know it was
[37:43] there I didn't know it existed I I I
[37:46] didn't I didn't know I had that in my
[37:49] possession it I I I totally didn't
[37:53] realize it until I discovered it you you
[37:57] know what I mean it's like America they
[38:00] did they didn't know it was out there
[38:01] they just thought it was blue uh water
[38:04] out there some people thought you'd fall
[38:06] off the end of the Earth so someone uh
[38:11] decided the way they saw the sun and
[38:13] everything and the sunet and the
[38:16] sunrise they knew that it had to be
[38:18] going somewhere and so it it put a
[38:22] curiosity in them and they begin to
[38:25] search so they begin to go out out and
[38:28] they began to go and they went so far
[38:30] and they hadn't fallen off and so they
[38:32] kept going and lo and behold they
[38:35] discovered
[38:36] America now they didn't invent
[38:40] America America was always
[38:44] there okay so it existed and but they
[38:48] came across it they they they found it
[38:51] they discovered it and all of a sudden
[38:54] they they they they saw and they found
[38:56] out there was people living there you
[38:59] know how how that's kind of like a
[39:01] church when they find out there's other
[39:03] people
[39:05] saved you know there's other people that
[39:07] got the Holy Ghost you know uh you know
[39:11] uh you mean we're not the only ones you
[39:14] know uh you call that living in your own
[39:17] world your own existence you know but
[39:21] sometimes if you go outside your world
[39:24] you discover that there's other things
[39:27] there's other
[39:29] understandings there's other things to
[39:32] know that it isn't just the way that you
[39:36] think it is and and and you you you you
[39:40] ran across it in your search so they
[39:43] discovered
[39:45] America and so they didn't find
[39:47] something new they found something that
[39:50] all uh already existed and and so
[39:55] there's uh
[39:58] there there's something uh there's
[40:01] something there and so these disciples
[40:05] they had the word they had the power
[40:07] they've seen it but when they ran across
[40:10] something they they didn't know how to
[40:13] handle it they didn't have the faith or
[40:17] the Revelation or they hadn't yet
[40:20] discovered what that they
[40:23] possessed cuz they had the
[40:26] power okay but they didn't have they
[40:28] hadn't discovered the faith yet the
[40:33] faith
[40:34] existed that's right right but they
[40:37] hadn't discovered the faith that was
[40:40] going to make that power work yes sir so
[40:44] the Lord's telling them the faith that's
[40:46] going to make your power work is if you
[40:49] could ever discover the fact that your
[40:51] name's written on the Lamb's Book of
[40:53] Life before the foundation of the world
[40:56] then then you would come to the
[40:59] realization that uh that you were made
[41:02] for this
[41:03] position and I I like what brother Billy
[41:06] said Sunday when he was talking about
[41:09] something has to have a connectivity you
[41:12] know it's got to be able to connect and
[41:15] and some people can't connect with
[41:17] something because there's nothing in
[41:19] them to connect with but how would you
[41:22] like to uh realize that you you're not
[41:26] connecting with something but you have
[41:29] what's in you to connect with it but you
[41:33] haven't discovered it
[41:37] yet and and
[41:40] uh and so uh and that's why my my
[41:45] thought is that you you need
[41:50] something that
[41:53] will cause you to discover that that now
[41:58] Jesus did that by giving them power and
[42:02] having them use that power and hop that
[42:06] they would discover oh this was part of
[42:09] my inheritance this is part of my
[42:12] positioning that they would come to the
[42:14] Revelation Jesus was trying to do
[42:18] something to get them to discover that
[42:21] there was something in them that
[42:25] exists now when you go back to Malachi
[42:30] 4:5 we we find the same uh positioning
[42:36] and we could we went we could go back to
[42:38] proving his word and we remember that
[42:41] God planted a seed there right so
[42:44] there's something there it exists the
[42:47] seed of Faith the seed that was going to
[42:51] receive uh Revelation was already there
[42:54] so if I could say this the the faith was
[42:59] given but the believer and the person
[43:04] had to discover that that Faith was in
[43:08] them the prophet of God talks about
[43:11] you'd go from this place to that place
[43:13] and then you would stumble in and you
[43:16] would
[43:17] find the Salvation you you stumbled into
[43:22] it in other words you discovered it it
[43:25] was there all the time
[43:30] you you know we know that uh pigs don't
[43:34] become lambs and Lambs don't become pigs
[43:37] but what happens a lamb can be in a pig
[43:40] pan until he discovers that he's not a
[43:46] pig wouldn't it be great if we could
[43:49] discover that we don't have to live yes
[43:53] sir we we live and do things many times
[43:57] because we we we don't know anything
[44:02] else because we haven't
[44:05] discovered that something else
[44:09] exists or that God has something else
[44:12] for us so we continue on as we
[44:16] are and and we continue on with what
[44:20] they got but what what we need is we
[44:24] need uh
[44:27] a a
[44:29] discovery we need to come across
[44:32] something that exists so we know that
[44:38] that there was a faith that was
[44:42] planted for our day and our time and a
[44:46] people that was planted how many believe
[44:49] that that God put you here he he he
[44:53] predestinated you to be here he fixed
[44:56] you up with the wife you've got he gave
[44:58] you the children you have that
[45:01] everything was pre-planned by God back
[45:04] to your great great grandfather
[45:06] everything came down but but you didn't
[45:09] know
[45:10] that but what God wants you to come to
[45:14] is the discovery of
[45:20] that you know and and I I'm not using
[45:23] the word revelation
[45:27] for these things because I I want you to
[45:29] understand Discovery has something to do
[45:32] with a
[45:34] search that's right okay so yeah you
[45:39] know or or in your journey you come
[45:41] across something you discover it it it's
[45:45] not like we just sit back and and and
[45:48] God just drops Revelation in on
[45:52] us
[45:54] D ding you know the light comes back
[45:58] that's not what we
[46:01] do we we take life's journey we go down
[46:05] the road of life and we're knocking our
[46:06] heads against this and we're fighting
[46:08] against that and and and we're just so
[46:11] frustrated and all that and then lo and
[46:14] behold we
[46:17] discover
[46:18] something Have you ever discovered a $5
[46:22] bill in your purse or your wallet or
[46:26] your pocket ET I I do it all the time
[46:29] I'll find a suit out and I'll get my
[46:31] suit on I'll reach in the pocket oh
[46:35] $20 you know what I mean I I just I said
[46:38] well praise the Lord lesie doesn't
[46:40] search my pockets before she hangs up my
[46:44] suit you know I discovered it no it was
[46:48] there it was there all the time like the
[46:52] song he was there all the
[46:55] time right well we didn't
[46:58] necessarily find him right he found us
[47:03] but what he did is he led us to discover
[47:09] him because the footsteps of the
[47:11] righteous are led by the Lord and so
[47:14] that's what Malachi for is the seed is
[47:18] there he planted it proving his word he
[47:22] told us that he takes the
[47:25] seed right and he predestines it to be
[47:29] there so it's laying there but it's not
[47:33] discovered you didn't discover that see
[47:35] I I I went through all kinds of terrible
[47:40] life before I came across the
[47:44] knowledge and the
[47:46] understanding that there was something
[47:49] in there that God put
[47:51] there so I was
[47:55] led to the
[47:58] discovery and so that's what Malachi 4
[48:01] does right he he says he shall restore
[48:05] the
[48:07] faith of the children back to their
[48:11] fathers so there there had to be
[48:14] something that led you to the
[48:22] Discovery do you understand that and so
[48:25] I have a relative
[48:27] that's uh sick and and uh
[48:31] she and and she has
[48:34] Faith you know what I mean but
[48:39] uh but I she's lacking the
[48:43] tool you understand to discover the
[48:47] faith and the healing that's in
[48:52] her okay and and so I in my heart I
[48:56] thought oh if I could just get her to
[49:01] listen to the voice of Malachi
[49:06] 45 and and
[49:09] and I believe that that
[49:12] voice was given sir as the means of
[49:20] Discovery you understand it it's the
[49:23] it's the the the that will open up to
[49:27] her it's that's what his purpose was was
[49:30] to restore the faith the faith is there
[49:33] but she needs something that would cause
[49:36] her to discover that
[49:40] Faith so it's like Jesus talked about
[49:43] men going on honor another man's honor I
[49:47] couldn't say well you've got faith God's
[49:49] okay but you need something greater than
[49:53] the faith and belief of man that's right
[49:56] you need something that connects you
[49:59] with something that's inside of you you
[50:02] need something to that allows you to
[50:05] discover the faith that's in
[50:09] you Jesus did
[50:12] that he sat down with those Elders he
[50:15] sat down with the scriptures he heard
[50:18] the story and he discovered who he
[50:22] was he discovered it
[50:27] he ran across
[50:29] it he found it that's right it was
[50:32] through
[50:34] Discovery it was
[50:37] discovered and that's what that's what
[50:40] Jesus said he said you search the
[50:42] scriptures CU in you you think you have
[50:45] eternal life but they are which
[50:47] testifying of me so they were reading
[50:50] the scriptures and they never discovered
[50:53] him in the scriptures
[50:58] was he
[51:00] there he was there all the time every
[51:03] prophecy every example every scripture
[51:07] was right there all the time right but
[51:09] he
[51:11] never they never discovered
[51:15] it because they rejected the word that
[51:20] would have opened their eyes and giving
[51:24] them Isa to discover it what do he do he
[51:27] gives you isab that you might what see
[51:31] can I insert a word there he gives you
[51:34] isab that you might
[51:37] Discover right you might come across and
[51:40] see it and see it and then know oh I've
[51:44] got
[51:47] this that's why I said I the
[51:50] reason that we listen yes sir the reason
[51:56] that that we
[51:58] pray and the reason that we read is that
[52:03] we might
[52:06] discover we might find
[52:10] something we're not just reading to
[52:12] fulfill a check on the
[52:16] box I've read the Bible for
[52:20] years and things pop up to me I'm still
[52:24] discovering things in the word of God
[52:27] now am I making them
[52:29] up I hope
[52:31] not am I inventing
[52:34] them they've been there all the time yes
[52:37] sir but I didn't Discover it now if I
[52:41] would never read it I would never
[52:43] Discover it even the kingdom of God is
[52:46] like a man that finds a treasure what
[52:49] does he do he discovers a treasure
[52:57] he discovered it wow there's a treasure
[53:01] here now he's willing to pay the price
[53:06] to
[53:07] apprehend the benefits of what he
[53:13] discovered and a lot of Believers
[53:16] Never grab a hold of the benefits of
[53:21] what they discovered the pearl of great
[53:23] price the treasure in the field
[53:28] but a lot of people go over things they
[53:32] miss
[53:33] things because they're not searching the
[53:36] scriptures Jesus said you search the
[53:39] scriptures but you search them for the
[53:41] wrong
[53:45] reason because you think that your
[53:47] eternal life is in your
[53:50] knowledge but he said they are which
[53:53] testifying of
[53:55] me now they would approached the
[53:57] scriptures correctly they would have
[53:59] known that he was the
[54:01] Messiah how many know is that sure it
[54:06] was there to be
[54:08] discovered now I want you to look at
[54:10] your position there's things there that
[54:14] are given to you to
[54:17] discover but if you're not looking for
[54:20] them you're not searching for them
[54:23] you're not asking for them you're not
[54:25] knocking
[54:27] on you won't
[54:29] discover so God sent a
[54:34] messenger to lead you to
[54:40] Discovery he sent the
[54:43] scriptures for you to read to lead you
[54:47] to Discovery prayer leads you to
[54:52] Discovery because it put you in a
[54:54] position to listen
[55:00] yes to
[55:03] discover now can you imagine if if we
[55:06] think we've got
[55:08] it and there's no more Discovery in our
[55:13] life there's no
[55:15] more there's no more uh Treasures in the
[55:19] field no more pearls a great price
[55:22] that's too many people's attitude with
[55:25] the message
[55:26] they think they know it they think
[55:28] they've got it they think it's you know
[55:31] it's there and let me I'll just say it
[55:34] like this until you can walk on water
[55:36] and raise the dead there's something to
[55:41] discover uh by no means I hope I didn't
[55:44] mean that in Sac
[55:47] religious you know what I mean but here
[55:50] it is the perfect love that as he is so
[55:53] are we in this world so when we can
[55:56] understand that the reason we're reading
[55:59] is for
[56:00] Discovery the reason that we're
[56:02] listening is for Discovery the reason
[56:06] that we're praying is for
[56:10] Discovery it's not a religious
[56:14] ceremony it's not to feel good it's to
[56:17] find
[56:19] something to
[56:21] discover
[56:23] something can you imagine if your life
[56:26] could
[56:26] change to a life of
[56:37] Discovery I had a friend that told me
[56:40] the story he was a Dairy Farmer in
[56:44] Pennsylvania when he took a fella to a a
[56:49] dairy farm and the guy saw them milking
[56:55] cows and you know what he said oh that's
[56:59] where milk comes from the guy looked at
[57:02] me says well where did you think milk
[57:04] come from he said the grocery
[57:11] store no I'm telling you you don't want
[57:14] to be
[57:15] trapped in your own mind and your own
[57:19] spiritual level and be
[57:23] stuck being spiritually
[57:30] ignorant but you want to realize wait a
[57:32] minute there's a world of Discovery for
[57:36] me in the scriptures if I search the
[57:40] scriptures they are which testify of him
[57:43] I can discover more about
[57:49] him things for me to
[57:52] discover you can discover what Real Love
[57:55] Is
[57:57] you can discover what real attraction is
[57:59] you can discover what real wealth is you
[58:02] can discover the in the scriptures the
[58:05] things for a successful
[58:08] business it's all
[58:10] there it's all there to be
[58:13] discovered so that's what I I want
[58:16] to I'm in to close it's a miracle
[58:21] because I I I want to really

[59:17] gold it's in the word it's in prayer you
[59:21] got to discover it though you've got to
[59:25] be on a trip journey of Discovery so
[59:29] that's my little thought tonight I want
[59:31] you to understand I I want us to become
[59:35] explorers
[59:36] discoverers Searchers of the
[59:40] scriptures finding the The
[59:43] Riches of God the riches of his
[59:46] knowledge may you increase in knowledge
[59:48] may you increase in spirit may may you
[59:51] increase in in in the wealth of the G uh
[59:55] gifts and
[59:57] and the character of
[1:00:01] Christ discover and there's got to
[1:00:05] be some
[1:00:09] tool you understand that leads you to
[1:00:13] the Discovery
[1:00:15] yes if not you would walk right over the
[1:00:19] top of
[1:00:21] something how would you like to be out
[1:00:23] in the field and you picked up a great
[1:00:25] big
[1:00:26] rock yeah kind of a funny looking rock
[1:00:29] kind of clear I know kind of looks like
[1:00:31] I don't know quartz crystal or
[1:00:35] whatever and you just threw it
[1:00:38] down and then you were some place and
[1:00:40] you started reading a
[1:00:42] book and you found out what you just
[1:00:44] threw down was a
[1:00:51] diamond something had to let you know
[1:00:53] that wasn't just a rock yes sir
[1:00:58] and that's why God had to send somebody
[1:01:01] to let you know you're not just a church
[1:01:04] member
[1:01:05] yes you're a child of
[1:01:10] God he had to give you
[1:01:12] sermons that would lead you to a
[1:01:17] discovery not knowledge a discovery of
[1:01:21] something that exists in
[1:01:24] you right
[1:01:27] he looked at me and says I can you I
[1:01:29] know you guys you don't even have the
[1:01:30] love of God how would you like to
[1:01:33] discover yes that the love of God is in
[1:01:35] you when you discover something it puts
[1:01:38] an end to the
[1:01:41] question
[1:01:43] wonderful this whole journey in this
[1:01:45] message is based on
[1:01:50] Discovery I I think we we we we got uh
[1:01:54] took revelation and turned it into an
[1:01:58] accumulation of knowledge it's not this
[1:02:01] is an accumulation of Discovery yes sir
[1:02:04] I'm going to discover who I am I'm going
[1:02:05] to discover what I got I'm going to
[1:02:08] discover what I made of I'm going to
[1:02:10] discover the power that God gave me I'm
[1:02:12] going to discover the position that God
[1:02:15] given
[1:02:17] me and I'm not the guy that does
[1:02:21] it amen there's not one of us in here
[1:02:24] that does it it was given to Malachi 45
[1:02:28] to do it he's the one that straightens
[1:02:30] out the world he's the one that
[1:02:32] straightens out countries he's the one
[1:02:34] that straightens out the gospel he don't
[1:02:36] need us that's
[1:02:38] right he's trying to lead us to
[1:02:41] Discovery and we're trying to lead other
[1:02:43] people to discovery of what we don't
[1:02:45] even
[1:02:50] know alls you can discover from me is
[1:02:53] what I
[1:02:54] know and that's means to sit back and go
[1:02:59] oh that's all he
[1:03:02] knows the brothers that do electrical
[1:03:05] work with me they call me old
[1:03:08] school cuz I only know old
[1:03:11] stuff and they got all kinds of new
[1:03:14] gadgets I said that's a cheap way of
[1:03:17] doing stuff you know no electrician just
[1:03:20] sticks wires in a little yellow thing
[1:03:23] you got to twist those babies you know
[1:03:25] what I mean and put your wiring on there
[1:03:27] till your hands are
[1:03:29] sore no they've
[1:03:31] discovered easier ways to doing things
[1:03:35] and the spirit moves on so could you
[1:03:37] imagine me going someplace and I'm going
[1:03:40] to give them all that I
[1:03:42] know to how far that I am you know how
[1:03:46] long it it's going to take till they
[1:03:48] know you're an
[1:03:51] ignoramus not long how many wants me to
[1:03:55] program your
[1:03:58] computer
[1:04:01] nobody why cuz you think I haven't
[1:04:05] discovered I don't even I they had to
[1:04:07] teach me how to turn mine on I couldn't
[1:04:10] even discover the button I had to have
[1:04:13] somebody help me discover the button
[1:04:18] right so you understand that's what the
[1:04:20] message is it's the key to our Discovery
[1:04:24] amen it's the key to discovering really
[1:04:27] what's in the
[1:04:30] Scriptures it it's it's it's it's
[1:04:33] not only Revelation the way we think it
[1:04:37] of but it's the
[1:04:39] whole discovery of what God's got for us
[1:04:43] for this age let's be
[1:04:48] explorers I like to close with the
[1:04:52] story Matthew shared the story with me I
[1:04:55] just really fit with what exactly was in
[1:04:58] my
[1:04:59] heart there was a man here
[1:05:04] recently and he was at home and so I I
[1:05:08] want you to understand it takes
[1:05:09] something to cause
[1:05:13] Discovery you're led into Discovery now
[1:05:17] I want you to picture this
[1:05:19] fellow he's
[1:05:22] broke he just lost his leg
[1:05:26] he's never had
[1:05:29] nothing and he's in
[1:05:33] great
[1:05:34] wonderment of what his life
[1:05:37] holds and how long he can hang on to
[1:05:41] what little bit he
[1:05:45] has
[1:05:47] very tough place to
[1:05:52] be and so he's sitting on on his
[1:05:56] couch and him and his wife turn on their
[1:06:01] television and they start watching the
[1:06:05] Antique Road
[1:06:09] Show and they sitting there on their
[1:06:13] couch and they're watching the Antique
[1:06:15] Road Show and this guy comes in with a
[1:06:21] blanket and they pull the blanket up
[1:06:26] and the guy looks at the blanket you
[1:06:28] know the antique shows they bring items
[1:06:30] to
[1:06:31] appraisers so the guy looks at the
[1:06:34] blanket and he says wow he said this is
[1:06:36] a great blanket he says this blanket
[1:06:40] could be worth
[1:06:43] $10,000 possibly maybe as high as
[1:06:47] 50 and the guy's looking at the
[1:06:51] blanket and all of a sudden it Dawns on
[1:06:54] them that look looks exactly like the
[1:06:57] blanket that's on the back of his
[1:07:02] couch so him and his wife jump up and
[1:07:06] they pull up the blanket and they're
[1:07:08] holding it up to the TV and they say wow
[1:07:11] this blanket looks just like that
[1:07:15] blanket see he was
[1:07:18] led to discovery of something that he
[1:07:22] always had
[1:07:26] but he needed a
[1:07:29] tool so now he's got this
[1:07:32] blanket so it brings it down to an
[1:07:35] appraiser and the guy says yeah he says
[1:07:38] that looks real let me send it off for
[1:07:40] some testing he says man this blanket
[1:07:42] might be worth 50
[1:07:44] Grand look I says 50
[1:07:47] Grand
[1:07:48] wow I got
[1:07:51] nothing and somebody will give me 50
[1:07:53] grand for this blanket so we went down
[1:07:55] and put it up for
[1:08:00] auction there's the
[1:08:02] blanket on the wall and they start
[1:08:04] bidding one guy goes
