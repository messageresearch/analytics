[41:09] important
[41:12] Sunday it's the it's the 27th of
[41:16] October anyway that'll be my 75th
[41:20] birthday so I'm gonna throw a party for
[41:23] myself we'll have a Sunday morning
[41:26] service and then Sunday evening we'll
[41:28] have something to eat over in the room
[41:31] over there so we'll do that and then
[41:34] don't forget our meetings are coming up
[41:36] November 8th 9th and 10th November 8th
[41:41] 9th and 10th so that's going to be our
[41:44] annual meeting and also our dedication
[41:46] meeting so uh we just trust everything
[41:50] will work well I think for our youth
[41:52] meeting we put a little over 550 people
[41:56] in the building building so uh we'll
[41:59] have just to get close to one another
[42:01] again and and squeeze together and then
[42:04] uh if we have overflow then we'll we'll
[42:07] make room for our overflow so we're
[42:09] certainly looking forward to that uh
[42:12] this evening I want to play a a a a
[42:17] small portion of a tape but
[42:21] um when when I hear brother Brandon
[42:23] preach a message uh and then he'll Maybe
[42:27] preached that message four or five
[42:30] different times just the fact that he
[42:32] approaches it more and once makes me
[42:35] take heed to it that there's something
[42:38] lying within there some sort of thought
[42:43] uh uh maybe even beyond the thought i'
[42:46] like to consider a
[42:49] principle and um something that a a a
[42:54] principle is something by which
[42:57] something operates in other words it it
[43:00] operates on these
[43:02] principles um like maybe it'll operate
[43:05] on the principle of of gravity or you
[43:09] know maybe if you had we flowing liquid
[43:13] down you have the the gravity it has a
[43:17] principle behind it and there are
[43:19] certain principles in our lives as
[43:22] Christians that are P that is important
[43:26] to us
[43:27] that we understand them because it's how
[43:31] things work one of the great uh
[43:34] principles of Christianity is uh is
[43:39] repentance and uh uh if you don't have
[43:42] that uh down then a lot of things don't
[43:46] work you know it's the it's the it's a
[43:50] principle you know what I mean you can't
[43:52] go forward if you have a in your heart
[43:55] against somebody you got to make that
[43:57] right that's a principle and so what
[44:01] you'll find out is you have a lot of
[44:03] vain efforts that never amount to
[44:05] nothing until everything gets back on
[44:08] track and so this is the a a a statement
[44:12] that has motivated me for the approach
[44:17] that I've taken and the things that are
[44:20] on my heart to share with you and our
[44:24] Prophet has said this he said I want to
[44:26] speak to you something to bring
[44:29] something to Enlighten you to the
[44:33] promises of God for this age so uh
[44:37] that's another thing that we got to a
[44:41] principle that the church operates on is
[44:44] that we're operating in an age like no
[44:47] other age this is a time like no other
[44:51] time uh and there is a word for this age
[44:57] age that was never given in any other
[45:00] age so like our messenger told us it was
[45:04] a principle he said Noah's message won't
[45:07] work in this day Moses's message won't
[45:10] work in this day so that's a principle
[45:13] that you can look back into the gospel
[45:16] you can look back into the history of
[45:18] the Bible you can look back at the Bible
[45:21] characters but you've got to understand
[45:24] that you have a special word for your
[45:25] day you have a special challenge for
[45:28] your day the enemy uh attacks you in a
[45:33] special way for this day you know you
[45:37] think of of uh uh of uh technology and
[45:42] things uh it it so amazing what people
[45:46] what we have to deal with I mean just uh
[45:50] the other day there's a quite a story in
[45:53] the news because uh I guess Israel they
[45:57] set up a a a a a a a tremendous plan so
[46:04] they went and and they they put a rumor
[46:08] out that uh they had
[46:11] infiltrated all the cell phones and uh
[46:16] of the their enemy so their enemy went
[46:20] out and bought pagers so they could
[46:23] avoid being detected well Israel sold
[46:27] them the
[46:29] pagers I just it's so
[46:32] elaborate that
[46:34] it I don't I I just got to say it
[46:38] sometimes you wonder if God's in it you
[46:40] know what I mean that they could pull
[46:42] this off and then they blew up all the
[46:47] pagers they got a message and the pagers
[46:50] exploded so they went to an
[46:53] emergency system of walkie-talkies and
[46:56] they able to blow them up now I carry
[47:00] around the phone and I wondering can
[47:03] they blow these things
[47:05] up you know they want to put you in a
[47:07] car they can
[47:09] stop you know what I mean I
[47:12] mean in other words the only Freedom we
[47:15] have is in Christ Jesus and if there's
[47:18] ever a time that we need the leadership
[47:21] of the Holy Spirit on the things that we
[47:25] do it's now amen and so as we go on
[47:28] brother BR said he
[47:31] said he said
[47:33] something not something that somebody
[47:36] else was in some other day so we're not
[47:39] trying to go back and be what somebody
[47:42] else was in another day that was the
[47:45] failure of Pentecost they they wanted to
[47:48] be like the apostles they wanted to be
[47:50] like they were in the other day they had
[47:52] to get everything trying to get it back
[47:54] to the day of Pentecost to the the early
[47:57] church but we have another faith we have
[48:00] the Faith of Our Fathers which was in
[48:03] the faith in the word of the hour that
[48:05] they lived in and so that's a different
[48:09] measure than reading a Bible story and
[48:12] so brother B's pointing that out as a
[48:14] principle he says we don't want he says
[48:17] you know that somebody else was in some
[48:22] other day but something then the things
[48:27] are all right and we refer to those
[48:29] things but I thought I would try to
[48:31] bring something to your mind with the
[48:34] scriptures I've got written here that
[48:37] would Enlighten you to know and make you
[48:41] a better soldier in the field that
[48:44] you're fighting in now so that's why
[48:48] that I want to play this tape this
[48:51] evening and make comments on it so you
[48:54] can be a builder Soldier I can be a
[48:57] better Soldier we can be a better
[48:59] soldier in the field that we're in now
[49:02] and then we can understand a
[49:05] principle by which things operate and if
[49:08] we can live by that principle it'll
[49:11] bring us much Victory he
[49:14] says he says to that you're fighting in
[49:18] now to learn the tactics of the
[49:22] enemy okay and the prophet of God's
[49:25] going to mention things in here here and
[49:27] I think you'll be able to see the
[49:29] tactics of the enemy so that you can
[49:32] block everything before it gets to you
[49:36] see that's the main thing is to learn to
[49:40] keep the punches off of you as much as
[49:43] you can so we're we're going to listen
[49:47] uh if you have uh one of your tablet or
[49:50] phone or whatever you want uh we're
[49:53] going to listen to uh a portion of tape
[49:57] about 27 minutes uh from the sermon that
[50:01] brother Brandon preached called from
[50:03] that time and this is the one in
[50:06] Bloomington um Illinois and I believe
[50:10] it's
[50:13] 52061 and uh so we're going to start
[50:15] with the reading of the scripture and uh
[50:18] we'll just listen to the 27 minutes and
[50:21] then I just want to make a few comments
[50:24] at the end and um
[50:27] I I also want you to notice uh just how
[50:31] sweet brother
[50:33] brandom's spirit is in this tape and how
[50:38] understanding he is and how loving he is
[50:41] and uh it that really touched me so
[50:45] let's stand together and and uh we'll
[50:51] uh we'll open our Bibles for the Short
[50:55] scripture reading
[50:57] is found in Matthew the 4th chapter and
[50:59] the 17th verse brother bram's going to
[51:02] read it and then um after he's done
[51:06] reading uh you can take your seats and
[51:10] um and just enjoy and and soak it in and
[51:15] just um meditate on it and uh and then
[51:20] we'll try to make a comment or two uh to
[51:23] um just try to help this sink in a
[51:26] little deeper so let us pray our
[51:28] gracious Heavenly
[51:31] Father Lord we're not even worthy to be
[51:35] in your
[51:37] presence but yet you're so kind and
[51:39] merciful to
[51:41] us Lord we don't know what we'd have
[51:43] done if you
[51:46] hadn't in your great wisdom stored up
[51:50] spiritual food in due
[51:52] season father that in this Great Famine
[51:55] that we live in in a land that's turned
[51:58] their hearts from
[52:00] you that we would have an eternal source
[52:04] of
[52:06] pure Vindicated word Lord that we know
[52:11] beyond the shadow of a
[52:13] doubt we can put our full confidence in
[52:17] and our full faith in and we don't have
[52:20] to figure it out we don't have to
[52:22] understand it we can believe it with all
[52:25] our hearts knowing that you will
[52:27] interpret it and you will bring it to
[52:29] pass just exactly the way it is
[52:32] spoken and we rest in that Bless the
[52:35] people tonight father as we felt led to
[52:37] play this portion of tape I ask that you
[52:40] would bless it to their hearts in Jesus
[52:42] name we pray amen God bless you our
[52:47] messenger in the Book of Matthew the 4th
[52:51] chapter the 17th
[52:55] verse we we read these words and from
[53:00] that time Jesus began to preach and to
[53:04] say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[53:07] at
[53:08] hand I'm going to take the little
[53:10] subject watch that
[53:13] clock the subject of
[53:16] from that
[53:19] time now there is
[53:22] uh times that we can say from that time
[53:28] there's times when as a young
[53:31] child these ministers here could say I
[53:34] was at a church and uh or I was out in
[53:37] the field
[53:39] or I was reading the Bible and from that
[53:44] time a little boy an old man we have a
[53:49] certain time that something happens and
[53:52] then we say from that time
[53:56] the little boy can say you know I I
[53:59] never lied in my life and one day I made
[54:02] a corn silk cigarette and I got up
[54:05] behind the old fire chimney and and I
[54:08] smoked this cigarette and got some
[54:10] coffee and put my mouth so Mama wouldn't
[54:13] smell it and and uh she said Junior have
[54:17] you been smoking a red light don't lie
[54:20] little boy don't lie conscience don't
[54:24] lie no Mommy you broke every barrier
[54:28] then and from that time I begin to
[54:33] lie that's way we start we have to mark
[54:36] it from some time something happened and
[54:39] from that time it changed things we all
[54:43] have those kind of
[54:44] times the immoral woman walks on the
[54:48] street she might have said one time I
[54:51] was as pure as a
[54:54] Lily and as radiant as after the rain
[54:58] when the Heavenly dude fell upon me and
[55:02] I was as pure as that
[55:05] Lily I was out with a boy that I thought
[55:08] to be a
[55:10] gentleman one night he gave me a spiked
[55:14] Coke he kissed me in a way that he
[55:17] should not have kissed me instead of
[55:20] pulling away from him and slapping him
[55:22] in the face and going
[55:24] home I throw my s into his arms and from
[55:29] that
[55:30] time there always something then I throw
[55:33] my life away I talked to such a woman
[55:36] the other
[55:38] day they had her in a psychic Ward I
[55:41] went in to pray
[55:43] for he said go back in straight
[55:47] jackets that's really what last night
[55:49] would have been the Visions were going
[55:52] right along calling those people from CS
[55:54] and things but when the glory of God
[55:56] fell in that building I couldn't even
[55:58] hear no more you know why I sent them
[56:01] ministers down
[56:02] there I want this audience to know and
[56:05] these people to know when I leave here
[56:07] that they don't have to send for me to
[56:08] pray for them I wanted the people to
[56:10] know that these Servants of God can lay
[56:12] their hands on the
[56:14] Seck it ain't nothing to one person it's

[1:04:26] um so she lay there a little while and
[1:04:29] she looked back she said you think it's

[1:04:33] she prayed a while longer I was taking
[1:04:35] plenty of time with her just she got the

[1:05:02] on that order how many knows Rosella
[1:05:05] many of you Rosella there you are from
[1:05:09] that time a certain thing then from that
[1:05:12] time it changed that's what the immoral
[1:05:15] woman the drunk could say I was raised
[1:05:17] as a provisionist my people didn't
[1:05:20] believe in drinking but one time I was
[1:05:22] with some boys and they call me a
[1:05:24] if I didn't take a drink and and I took
[1:05:26] my first drink and from that time that's
[1:05:29] the time it started one night in a in a
[1:05:32] Roadhouse one night parked on the side
[1:05:34] of the road when my girlfriend give me a
[1:05:36] drink from that time it's started New
[1:05:40] Year's they turn a new page good
[1:05:42] intention don't do no good that won't
[1:05:45] help anything I used to see my father
[1:05:47] throw away his chewing tobacco on on New
[1:05:51] Year's and say I'll never chew it no
[1:05:53] more and watch where he thr it so I can
[1:05:56] pick it up the next day you see and I've
[1:05:58] see him throw his bottle away and then
[1:06:00] watch what he done with it you see go
[1:06:02] you you turnning Pages don't do no good
[1:06:04] it takes something to happen
[1:06:06] inside any doctor will tell you if you
[1:06:08] put something on the outside and heal
[1:06:11] was sore over on the outside it'll only
[1:06:13] make it worse if it isn't it has to heal
[1:06:15] from the inside out and that's way
[1:06:17] Christianity is isn't jarn in church or
[1:06:20] something it's healing from the inside
[1:06:23] coming out your conversion comes from
[1:06:25] the inside inside the core the spirit
[1:06:28] life after the first world war many of
[1:06:31] you young fellas don't remember this us
[1:06:33] older man remembered I was just a boy
[1:06:35] nine years old but I remember they said
[1:06:38] we'll have no more Wars after the first
[1:06:40] world war it's all settled they found a
[1:06:43] thing called gas and we we just can't we
[1:06:46] will never be able to to survive Another
[1:06:49] War because that it's uh uh we're going
[1:06:52] to fix an idea that we'll never have no
[1:06:55] more Wars that's all we're settl it for
[1:06:57] good so but they had other War they find
[1:07:02] they finally organized the thing called
[1:07:04] the U I believe it was called the League
[1:07:06] of
[1:07:07] Nations and we're going to take so many
[1:07:10] soldiers out of every nation and we're
[1:07:12] going to have a police guard and if
[1:07:14] anybody gets out of roof one of this so
[1:07:17] many out this nation so many we're going
[1:07:18] to go say sit down
[1:07:20] John because the nations are just a
[1:07:23] bunch of boys just a family that's all
[1:07:25] there is do it like a house to God and
[1:07:28] we're going to police them and we're
[1:07:30] going to have the League of Nations but
[1:07:33] they had War just the same now they've
[1:07:35] got the UN but we got War just the same
[1:07:39] you see so uh when we formed the UN and
[1:07:42] we get all the nations into it now
[1:07:44] Russia's out and this and that see
[1:07:46] there's none of those things you you
[1:07:47] can't put your hands on that not a thing
[1:07:50] the young couple one time there was a
[1:07:52] young couple would get married
[1:07:56] and the young couple might have said um
[1:07:58] John and Mary and how fine they live
[1:08:01] together and they might have said that I
[1:08:04] am perhaps maybe I'm taking too long and
[1:08:07] holding this uh meeting too long what
[1:08:10] time we have to leave
[1:08:13] brother what
[1:08:16] time oh I didn't know we're sorry
[1:08:18] brother just a few minutes and
[1:08:21] we yes sir thank you sir we didn't know
[1:08:25] that we're supposed to have left the
[1:08:29] 10 let's go just a little
[1:08:33] farther it was fine and dandy told one
[1:08:36] time a little curly-headed salesman come
[1:08:39] in that talked her into something wrong
[1:08:42] and it broke off her home from that time
[1:08:44] you see brother brandom you're telling
[1:08:46] us this morning of how many things
[1:08:48] that's happened and what's taking place
[1:08:50] and all this that and the other is there
[1:08:52] anything that can happen that stands
[1:08:54] eternally yes when a man meets
[1:08:58] God there was a man named Abraham just
[1:09:01] an ordinary man but one day he met God
[1:09:05] and from that time he was changed
[1:09:08] forever he believed something that he
[1:09:10] could not see when he met God he was
[1:09:13] changed Moses a runaway servant he
[1:09:16] didn't he was supposed to deliver the
[1:09:18] children of
[1:09:20] Israel but he run away and he didn't
[1:09:23] know how to do it his military training
[1:09:24] wouldn't let do it but one day he met
[1:09:27] God he was a changed man and a man meets
[1:09:30] God it makes him act different than he
[1:09:32] ever did act could you imagine a Moses
[1:09:36] how ridiculous when you meet God what
[1:09:38] it'll make you act Billy did you say we
[1:09:40] had 10 minutes about 10 minutes sorry uh
[1:09:42] how make look at Moses here one day he's
[1:09:45] a sheep herder a prince of Egypt run
[1:09:48] away on the backs side of the desert
[1:09:49] back on the backside of the desert herd
[1:09:51] and sheep afraid to go to Israel uh go
[1:09:55] down to Egypt rather and here he is on
[1:09:57] the backs side of the desert the next
[1:09:59] morning here he is with his wife sitting
[1:10:01] straddle a mule with a young on her hip
[1:10:05] Whiskers hanging this low 80 years old
[1:10:08] his bald head shining a stick in his
[1:10:10] hand here he goes glory to God
[1:10:13] hallelujah walking where you going Moses
[1:10:15] going down to Egypt to take
[1:10:17] over one man
[1:10:20] Invasion why he had met God where he was
[1:10:25] was running now he was going back to
[1:10:26] take over and he done
[1:10:28] it because he had met God and from that
[1:10:32] time The Burning Bush Moses was a
[1:10:34] different character after he met God
[1:10:37] that's right Mary the little virgin
[1:10:40] never had a woman bore a child without
[1:10:43] being uh an interourse with man never
[1:10:49] had she never been able to to ever be
[1:10:52] able to have a child without natural
[1:10:54] pollen but she believed God and before
[1:10:57] she felt any life or anything else the
[1:11:00] Angel's word was good enough for her she
[1:11:02] met the Lord said Hail Mary blessed art
[1:11:06] thou amongst women you're going to have
[1:11:08] a child knowing no man she said behold
[1:11:11] the hands made of the Lord and from that
[1:11:14] time Mary never waited till she was
[1:11:17] positive why would we wait till we were
[1:11:20] we've got to see our hand come straight
[1:11:22] our foot come straight the belly ain't
[1:11:24] stopped
[1:11:25] not her the angel of the Lord his
[1:11:28] message is good enough for her she SC
[1:11:32] around testifying Hallelujah and going
[1:11:34] to have the baby knowing no man why she
[1:11:38] met God that was a different Peter when
[1:11:42] he met God and Jesus revealed to him who
[1:11:44] he was from that time he was an apostle
[1:11:48] Paul the Little Hook noosed Jew
[1:11:51] sarcastic going down there with a letter
[1:11:53] in his pocket to arrest all them people
[1:11:54] Shout speaking in tongues he was going
[1:11:56] to put him in jail he had a a order from
[1:11:59] the high Church to do it but he met God
[1:12:02] from that time oh he was a different man
[1:12:06] when he met God one time a dirty
[1:12:10] stinking leper laid at the gate and
[1:12:12] Jesus came through and he said if thou
[1:12:15] wilt thou can make me clean from that
[1:12:18] time he had no leprosy why he met God
[1:12:22] that's that an immoral woman met God God
[1:12:25] one time at the well she had five
[1:12:27] husbands and lived with the six he told
[1:12:30] her the very secret of her heart and
[1:12:32] from that time she was a messenger of
[1:12:35] God to the city come see a man who told
[1:12:37] me what I've done isn't this the very
[1:12:39] Messiah Hallelujah when you meet God it
[1:12:42] changes things from that time it changes
[1:12:46] things it certainly does it does it for
[1:12:49] all people there was a blind man one
[1:12:51] time met God and from that time he could
[1:12:54] see certainly as soon as he met God
[1:12:59] now we got a lot more we could say but
[1:13:01] to hurry I want to make one statement
[1:13:04] here death met God one
[1:13:08] time and it never was the same
[1:13:13] Afters the devil always doubted that
[1:13:16] being the Son of
[1:13:18] God he thought if that was him up there
[1:13:21] on a mountain why didn't he perform a
[1:13:23] miracle before me
[1:13:25] when they tuck him down there and put
[1:13:27] that rag around his eyes and hit him on
[1:13:29] the head and said if you are a prophet
[1:13:31] if you can discern the thoughts of the
[1:13:33] heart now you tell us who hit you we'll
[1:13:36] believe you they thought surely that
[1:13:40] can't be God they let somebody pull the
[1:13:43] beard out of his face and haw with
[1:13:45] drunken spit of a soldier and spit in
[1:13:47] his face and that be God and then stand
[1:13:50] there and not say a word about it said
[1:13:52] that couldn't be God God to Smite him
[1:13:55] dead see he just don't know the nature
[1:13:58] of God a lot of people try to be I'm so
[1:14:01] and so step out like that that's not God
[1:14:04] the way down is
[1:14:07] up his humility proved to me he was God
[1:14:11] what he was humble
[1:14:14] sweet now the devil thought that wasn't
[1:14:18] god let's take a look at him just as we
[1:14:20] were watching watch how death met him
[1:14:23] and what happened to death how could
[1:14:25] that be God being a man why he was born
[1:14:28] down there out of holy
[1:14:29] wedlock his mother probably had that
[1:14:31] baby but Joseph this old man 45 years
[1:14:34] old her 16 why he is a father of four or
[1:14:38] five children and then go ahead and
[1:14:40] marry this young girl why that baby is
[1:14:42] born without a holy wedlock that's how
[1:14:44] they had to turn that's exactly the way
[1:14:46] the people believed it born under
[1:14:48] without a holy wedlock they believe that
[1:14:51] illegitimate child how could that be God
[1:14:54] it could couldn't be God so I see going
[1:14:58] up the hill let's let's go to Jerusalem
[1:15:01] for the next 3 minutes or five I we're
[1:15:04] talking I hear a noise let's go look out
[1:15:07] the window raise it up I hear something
[1:15:09] going bump bump bump it's an old cross
[1:15:14] coming up the
[1:15:16] street he had one garment on his back
[1:15:20] wall through out without a
[1:15:22] scene a howling mob I see a little woman
[1:15:25] run out in front and say what has he
[1:15:28] done but heal your
[1:15:31] sick make gentleman out of your
[1:15:34] criminals what has he done but brought
[1:15:36] us hopes of Life a big rough hand
[1:15:39] smacked her across the street said would
[1:15:41] you listen to that woman instead of your
[1:15:42] Bishop your
[1:15:44] priest what's he done I look at him he's
[1:15:49] little across
[1:15:51] Dragon I see some little red spots on on
[1:15:55] the back of his coat that's got across
[1:15:57] his shoulder what are they on up the
[1:16:00] hill he goes and spots begin to come
[1:16:03] bigger and
[1:16:04] bigger larger natur while they all run
[1:16:08] into one big spot Splash now it's
[1:16:14] blood dragging the footprints out as it
[1:16:17] comes up I can see the bee of death say
[1:16:21] you want me to go now
[1:16:23] Satan yeah ah he that's not God he's not
[1:16:28] even a prophet you wouldn't stand that
[1:16:30] he'd curse that bunch of people if he
[1:16:32] was a prophet he that's out him go on
[1:16:35] bee
[1:16:36] stinging anchor him we've got him now
[1:16:39] and see that bee of death begin to hum
[1:16:41] around him Buzz around him
[1:16:44] brother anybody knows an insect that has
[1:16:46] a stinger like a bee if it ever stings
[1:16:50] deep it don't have no Stinger no more
[1:16:54] he stuck his sting in the wrong flesh
[1:16:57] then he stuck it in Emmanuel's
[1:17:02] flesh the bee of death stung
[1:17:05] him death met
[1:17:08] God since then he don't have any
[1:17:12] Stinger he pulled his
[1:17:15] flesh he depowered
[1:17:19] him he couldn't sting no
[1:17:22] more one named Paul when they were
[1:17:25] building a a place of scaffold there in
[1:17:28] Rome to chop his head off that bee be to
[1:17:31] hum around him make a
[1:17:34] noise said oh death where is your
[1:17:38] stinger grave where is your Victory but
[1:17:41] thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:17:44] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:46] and when death met God God pulled the
[1:17:51] stinger out of
[1:17:53] death something happened to death when
[1:17:55] it met God and today when we go to face
[1:17:59] him death can buz but it can't sting it
[1:18:04] hasn't got any
[1:18:07] Stinger let us
[1:18:11] pray father I'm so glad that death has
[1:18:15] no Stinger it can
[1:18:18] fuss Buzz around and try to make us as
[1:18:22] scared we can stand like Paul of old
[1:18:25] we've had that same experience that we
[1:18:27] have passed from Death because we've
[1:18:30] been hid in a body called Jesus Christ
[1:18:34] that pull the very Stinger of death out
[1:18:36] of it so we have the muddy grave can no
[1:18:41] longer hold a Believer for he rose again
[1:18:44] and as he rose We rise with him for

[1:18:51] bring with him at his
[1:18:53] coming God is if there's someone here

[1:19:52] the sister's tips on the table if you
[1:19:55] will and God be with you until we meet
[1:19:58] tonight all right God bless
[1:20:08] you did you enjoy
[1:20:11] that amen wasn't that wonderful I just
[1:20:15] you could just feel the nuggets of
[1:20:17] wisdom uh just pouring out and
[1:20:20] everything but I just wanted just to
[1:20:22] make a just a few comments ments uh
[1:20:26] certainly can't add to it um and I've
[1:20:30] listened to it and just even listening
[1:20:32] to it again so much more beautiful
[1:20:35] things open up but this is something
[1:20:38] that brother brandom said and and we're
[1:20:41] talking
[1:20:43] about principles things that we can
[1:20:47] place in our understanding that allow us
[1:20:51] to fight the
[1:20:53] battle of better in the battle that
[1:20:56] we're in and that's what we all want to
[1:20:59] do if God could give us anything better
[1:21:01] than his word he would have given it to
[1:21:04] us and that's his weapon is his word and
[1:21:08] and so you know uh that's one of the
[1:21:12] things that the privilege of
[1:21:16] hearing the spoken word we and in the
[1:21:20] hour that we're living in and the fact
[1:21:23] that we can actually hear a voice uh was
[1:21:28] just such a blessing to our age uh
[1:21:31] before you could read and you would just
[1:21:33] have to wonder what was said and wonder
[1:21:35] this and wonder
[1:21:37] that think to see what you might be able
[1:21:40] to put together and and everything and
[1:21:43] you just never could put it together but
[1:21:45] finally a a a a word came and the Word
[1:21:48] was
[1:21:49] opened and he began to to speak things
[1:21:53] to us
[1:21:55] that is a love letter to us it's just
[1:21:57] written in between the lines and and
[1:22:00] those that are elected they they hear
[1:22:03] what he's saying and it just it comes
[1:22:05] out because I I just think the way he
[1:22:08] puts his sentences together was divine
[1:22:11] so uh you might think I'm a little
[1:22:13] fanatical but uh it's okay I don't I'm
[1:22:18] happy so like brother B says I'm happy
[1:22:21] with this you know just leave me alone
[1:22:23] but he makes this statement and I just
[1:22:25] want to uh this statement that he made
[1:22:30] is the way that I approached the rest of
[1:22:34] what he was speaking about and he
[1:22:38] says he says and you know he said M you
[1:22:41] know he said uh junior did you smoke and
[1:22:44] he said no I didn't smoke and he says
[1:22:47] you broke every barrier he said from
[1:22:49] that time became a liar now brother BR
[1:22:53] makes this statement and it it it it
[1:22:55] sunk into me if you don't mind me just
[1:22:57] fellowshiping with you for a moment he
[1:23:00] says that's the way we
[1:23:03] start okay
[1:23:05] so don't only look back but what he's
[1:23:09] saying this is the way we start if we're
[1:23:11] going to make a change or if something's
[1:23:15] going to take place there's a starting
[1:23:18] place this is where we start so you
[1:23:21] start you have to have a starting place
[1:23:23] to go back and you have to have a
[1:23:25] starting place to go right so he says
[1:23:28] this is how it starts he says this
[1:23:32] is that's the way it starts we have to
[1:23:36] mark it from some time and so he says
[1:23:43] and and don't just walk over
[1:23:46] it by but like looking back and looking
[1:23:50] he says you have to mark it from
[1:23:52] sometime our mind immediately medely
[1:23:54] goes to the time but really is what he's
[1:23:57] saying is you have to mark
[1:24:02] it okay you've got to mark your
[1:24:06] blessings and you got to mark your
[1:24:09] mistakes you've got to know that you've
[1:24:12] made them you've got to know that I did
[1:24:16] this this is what I
[1:24:19] did and and and what I did caused
[1:24:24] this to happen and so he's he's saying
[1:24:28] you have to mark that you have to mark
[1:24:31] that you can't you just can't do things
[1:24:34] and do things and just let them fall by
[1:24:37] the wayside and and and say things and
[1:24:40] and not think that they're not having
[1:24:43] any effect or they're not affecting
[1:24:47] you okay that there's and he says he
[1:24:50] says he said so you've got to mark it
[1:24:53] from sometime you've got a
[1:24:55] market something
[1:24:59] happened okay you got a market something
[1:25:04] happened so if if if we don't have this
[1:25:10] Insight you understand that if you've
[1:25:12] ever offended somebody you know I
[1:25:15] remember one time I made a statement to
[1:25:17] a really close friend of M I didn't know
[1:25:19] what he was going through I didn't mean
[1:25:21] to say what I said but I said something
[1:25:25] and and he got mad and got up and left
[1:25:28] and we didn't talk to each other for
[1:25:30] years and
[1:25:31] years you know and and I and I had to go
[1:25:37] back to that
[1:25:39] time of what I
[1:25:41] said and what
[1:25:44] happened because I when I marked that
[1:25:47] time and I went back to that time that
[1:25:50] it happened then I had to mark that time
[1:25:56] before something could
[1:25:59] happen you understand I'm talking I hope
[1:26:02] you can apply this to your own life he
[1:26:04] says something happened and from that
[1:26:07] time it changed
[1:26:11] things so he say and he says we all have
[1:26:16] those kinds of times so we find out that
[1:26:20] in our lives you you're wanting to go
[1:26:23] forward you you've got to go back and
[1:26:26] find the time and Mark it when they
[1:26:30] changed both spiritually for the better
[1:26:35] and fleshly for the worse because if you
[1:26:38] don't mark it you won't deal with it and
[1:26:41] that was one of the greatest things that
[1:26:43] our Prophet could do he could go back
[1:26:45] into your life and find that time he
[1:26:49] could find that time the time it changed
[1:26:52] we all know the story about the the the
[1:26:54] little girl that got barked at by the
[1:26:56] dog and and from that time she got this
[1:26:59] fear and the fear led to this and led to
[1:27:01] that and it it absolutely affected her
[1:27:05] life and so he could take her back to
[1:27:08] that time and when she came in contact
[1:27:11] with that time then it came clear to her
[1:27:15] because once she came to the time that
[1:27:18] the change came was also the time that
[1:27:21] she could be changed right
[1:27:24] but it had to be
[1:27:26] marked so you you've got to mark your
[1:27:30] life you know you you've got to know the
[1:27:33] time that you prayed the time that you
[1:27:38] prayed many times when I I I I I reach
[1:27:42] certain battles in my life and I find
[1:27:45] myself falling to the the same spot I'll
[1:27:48] go back and say Lord I remember when I
[1:27:51] stood behind that church and I prayed
[1:27:53] for this I believe you heard my prayer I
[1:27:57] I I I told you I needed help but you've
[1:27:59] got to have that thought in your life
[1:28:03] you know that you know that that
[1:28:05] something took place in your life that
[1:28:08] you something changed and so we we do
[1:28:11] that because if you you've got to you've
[1:28:15] got to Mark the time that things change
[1:28:18] because he told us one of the things
[1:28:20] that the principles we go back to is
[1:28:23] when you get away away from him you've
[1:28:25] got to go back to where you left
[1:28:28] them you've got to go back to the time
[1:28:32] that you left them so you got to Mark
[1:28:34] the time you're blessed you've got to
[1:28:37] know the time that you left them you got
[1:28:39] to Mark the things that change you know
[1:28:43] this whole world wants us to be
[1:28:46] lukewarm it wants us to have amnesia it
[1:28:50] wants us to be numb it it wants us to
[1:28:53] get to the place we just think
[1:28:55] everything just happens by chance and
[1:28:57] we're not control and this is happening
[1:29:00] and that's happening and and I don't
[1:29:02] know what's going on and I'm just kind
[1:29:04] of wandering through life loss that's
[1:29:07] that's a
[1:29:08] deception the prophet God was talking to
[1:29:10] these people he says they all will tell
[1:29:12] you there was a time from that time I
[1:29:15] took my drink from that time I smoked
[1:29:17] from that time I lied from that time
[1:29:20] from that time from that time things
[1:29:22] changed
[1:29:25] and so if you you find yourself in a
[1:29:29] condition then you've got to find the
[1:29:32] time and Mark that
[1:29:34] spot find that St pray that it be
[1:29:38] revealed to you he lays that principle
[1:29:41] down also and be certain of God he said
[1:29:44] when you up against something he says
[1:29:46] you go back and turn every stone to find
[1:29:50] out if there's a time that caused
[1:29:53] something right and then when you make
[1:29:55] that
[1:29:56] right and you fix it then you can say
[1:30:00] this was the time I came to him this is
[1:30:03] the time I backslid and from that time
[1:30:06] I've been battling this from that time
[1:30:08] I've been battling that well once you go
[1:30:10] back to that time that the change
[1:30:13] happened to you then the change can take
[1:30:18] place am I making myself
[1:30:21] clear it it it a it's an a
[1:30:27] principle what happened to Moses he says
[1:30:30] Moses Moses was called to do this he
[1:30:32] went out there he tried to use the force
[1:30:36] you know what I mean he went out into
[1:30:37] the desert and then he had to come back
[1:30:39] to the time that he tried went to the
[1:30:41] burning
[1:30:42] bush then he could have a
[1:30:45] change and so the one of the things that
[1:30:48] we have to realize that's so beautiful
[1:30:50] is no matter where we're at there is a a
[1:30:54] a
[1:30:55] time that things can change in our lives
[1:30:59] there's a time that the corner can be
[1:31:02] turned there's a time we can come out of
[1:31:05] the depression a time we can come out of
[1:31:08] the finances there's a time of change a
[1:31:11] time of change
[1:31:13] exist right a place where we could say
[1:31:16] from that time I might find myself in
[1:31:19] the desert but if I know there's a time
[1:31:22] that that I know that God's got a time
[1:31:24] that I can come to life and find
[1:31:27] water that if I'm walking in a dry place
[1:31:30] I know there's a time that a Wellspring
[1:31:33] of life will come up so okay I know that
[1:31:36] he's got a time of
[1:31:39] change that he is that there's there is
[1:31:42] a from that time out there waiting for
[1:31:47] me I can take hope in
[1:31:50] that I can I can take rest in that that
[1:31:54] I'm not stuck
[1:31:56] here now something might have got me
[1:31:58] here and I can say from that time I got
[1:32:01] in this shape I quit paying my tithe I
[1:32:04] quit giving my offering I quit doing I
[1:32:07] quit doing that and you come back and
[1:32:08] say wow man I really in a financial mess
[1:32:11] and you go back and say wow uh from it
[1:32:14] was from that time that things begin to
[1:32:16] fall apart from for me well once you're
[1:32:20] there you went back to where you left
[1:32:23] them
[1:32:25] and when you go back to where you left
[1:32:27] them then you can meet them again and
[1:32:31] you'll have
[1:32:32] another from that
[1:32:36] time lord and that was so
[1:32:40] beautiful about the gospel and so
[1:32:42] there's a lot of things you know uh
[1:32:45] there's a a lot of things that you got
[1:32:47] to go back to you know a lot of times
[1:32:50] it's a decision you made to change your
[1:32:52] course
[1:32:56] you know what I mean because sometimes
[1:32:58] you got to go back and say well how did
[1:33:00] I get
[1:33:02] here you know it doesn't he used things
[1:33:05] like drinking smoking and all those
[1:33:07] things well those those things are is
[1:33:10] the is the the Dynamics of somebody
[1:33:15] that's found thems in sin they didn't
[1:33:18] start that way but they were tempted and
[1:33:20] drawn off by their own flesh and they
[1:33:23] went over and failed and sin was
[1:33:25] conceived and then it then it became
[1:33:28] practiced and then they made him a
[1:33:31] sinner but a lot of times with
[1:33:34] Christians you're not participating in
[1:33:37] those kind of sins but our failures are
[1:33:41] in decisions we
[1:33:45] make things we chose to do maybe we
[1:33:49] didn't pray about it maybe we didn't uh
[1:33:52] uh consider everything uh maybe we uh we
[1:33:56] felt pressure to get to rush to a
[1:34:00] conclusion and the prophet of God went
[1:34:02] over that in the message called letting
[1:34:04] off the pressure he said pressure will
[1:34:06] cause you to do things you normally
[1:34:07] wouldn't
[1:34:10] do so if you understand this
[1:34:14] principle of addressing things finding
[1:34:18] things finding the time find finding the
[1:34:23] the hour that you came under pressure
[1:34:25] the hour that you came under inspiration
[1:34:28] and filter it all back through the word
[1:34:30] of God go back over here what did it
[1:34:33] cause you to do what did it get you
[1:34:36] involved in so if you can go back
[1:34:38] through that process and find that time
[1:34:41] that you left him you go back there then
[1:34:44] what's waiting for you is a brand new
[1:34:47] from that time from the time I made it
[1:34:50] right the time I said forgiveness the
[1:34:54] from that
[1:34:56] time so it works on both ends a lot of
[1:35:00] times it's the view that you've taken or
[1:35:04] the
[1:35:06] opinion that you've
[1:35:09] formed you know
[1:35:11] I when I first came in the message the
[1:35:14] very first people I
[1:35:17] met they didn't like Perry
[1:35:20] green and Perry Green's gone now so not
[1:35:24] here to defend himself but those guys
[1:35:26] are gone too so I'm pretty
[1:35:30] safe but they didn't like brother Perry
[1:35:33] so man they just laid a picture of Perry
[1:35:35] green about me that you know the GU guy
[1:35:37] was you know he's
[1:35:40] terrible and I had an
[1:35:43] opinion never met the guy never heard
[1:35:47] him talk didn't know what he stood for
[1:35:49] or nothing I was poisoned I had an
[1:35:52] opinion
[1:35:54] I formed a
[1:35:55] view and my view was clouding my
[1:36:01] judgment and it caused me to say things
[1:36:05] do
[1:36:06] things have an attitude and an
[1:36:09] atmosphere around
[1:36:11] me because I
[1:36:14] listened well I was young
[1:36:17] then but now you know I I don't make
[1:36:21] that judgment
[1:36:23] because you know when I meant the
[1:36:25] brother you know of course I spewed all
[1:36:29] the all the vile things I heard about
[1:36:32] him and he just slowly defended himself
[1:36:34] told me what brother Braham said B but
[1:36:35] the whole story was
[1:36:37] different I went to being like brother
[1:36:39] Bram said that that guy
[1:36:42] that you're you know and just
[1:36:48] going
[1:36:50] why cuz there was a time
[1:36:54] that I listened to gossip there was a
[1:36:57] time that I formed
[1:36:59] opinions a lot of times your judgment
[1:37:02] the judgments you make uh uh they they
[1:37:06] they they affect and the opinions you
[1:37:09] have they affect your decisions they
[1:37:11] affect the things you do the way you go
[1:37:14] about things the way you treat people
[1:37:17] all all these things and and your whole
[1:37:19] course is being changed and you're and
[1:37:22] things and you're slowly drifting away
[1:37:25] from the from the sweetness and the joy
[1:37:30] and the presence of the Holy Spirit and
[1:37:33] you don't know why you're in the
[1:37:36] desert and you say well I'm not drinking
[1:37:39] I'm not spoken well why don't you look
[1:37:41] at what what you think about
[1:37:44] people why don't you look about your
[1:37:46] opinions why don't you look at your
[1:37:49] judgments go back to the time that I
[1:37:51] begin to think this way
[1:37:58] you know I I'll never forget when Rachel
[1:38:01] told me that she liked
[1:38:03] Gary I thought
[1:38:07] what something's wrong
[1:38:10] here you know and I remember going to I
[1:38:13] says are you sure you know and oh yeah
[1:38:15] brother David I really love
[1:38:18] him I don't
[1:38:20] know you know and man I I'm trying to
[1:38:23] get all kinds of opinions and filter
[1:38:25] everything now now he's he's he's one of
[1:38:28] our
[1:38:30] deacons you can be so wrong about
[1:38:35] stuff so
[1:38:37] wrong and it actually is affecting you
[1:38:40] and now you have from that time I begin
[1:38:43] to feel these ways about certain people
[1:38:46] my spirit changed my nature changed my
[1:38:50] peace changed my Joy changed my happy
[1:38:53] has changed everything because I got in
[1:38:56] this great big U wad of thoughts and
[1:39:00] opinions and judgments going on in my
[1:39:03] mind and and uh I I love brother bram's
[1:39:07] attitude towards that girl in the insan
[1:39:09] this island are you here are you a
[1:39:14] patient you know well oh what did you do
[1:39:17] yeah man he just all covering her sins I
[1:39:21] saw she could be a beautiful he looked
[1:39:23] at her and what did he see a lovely
[1:39:26] wife a a
[1:39:28] mother I mean come
[1:39:34] on can you imagine him taking the wrong
[1:39:36] opinion or the wrong
[1:39:40] judgment the effect and so we we've got
[1:39:44] this we've got to we've got to
[1:39:48] to especially the young people going to
[1:39:51] school and and start relationships you
[1:39:54] got to Mark those times you've got to
[1:39:57] Mark the influence you've got to measure
[1:40:00] the effect things are having on you the
[1:40:02] way it works on your mind the way it
[1:40:04] works on your emotions you've got to
[1:40:07] become aware of it and where it's taking
[1:40:10] you because it's causing a change in
[1:40:14] you and then you got to be able to say
[1:40:16] is that change right and if it's not
[1:40:19] right and it's not the further of the
[1:40:21] Gospel bringing you into hum humility
[1:40:24] then you've got to go back to that time
[1:40:27] that you that you changed those opinions
[1:40:30] that you came to that time and you got
[1:40:32] to go back to where you left him so you
[1:40:35] can have a brand new from that
[1:40:40] time and it makes your
[1:40:42] life you it's always that
[1:40:46] way
[1:40:49] daily it's good to sit down at the end
[1:40:52] of the day and go back back through the
[1:40:56] things you said the things you
[1:40:59] thought the way you treated people the
[1:41:02] attitude you had and then when you got
[1:41:05] something that's right go make it
[1:41:08] right Jesus said don't let the sun go
[1:41:11] down upon your wrath so all these are
[1:41:14] the really the principles that's going
[1:41:17] to make the
[1:41:18] church have power and keep the punches
[1:41:22] of the enemy off
[1:41:25] you when you mark the time he tries to
[1:41:28] punch you when he Mark you mark the time
[1:41:31] he tried to lay something on
[1:41:34] you and if you get one of those things
[1:41:37] working in you go
[1:41:41] back look at the effect it had look at
[1:41:45] what's going on and then you'll find out
[1:41:47] you can get in the presence of the Lord
[1:41:50] like that girl he said she got down and
[1:41:52] prayed he prayed with her I spent time
[1:41:54] with her and then finally she struck the
[1:41:57] fire Hallelujah she knew something was
[1:42:01] different she knew because she had a
[1:42:06] brand new from that time now she got up
[1:42:10] and said from this
[1:42:12] time she had it from that time and now
[1:42:15] she had it from from that time and both
[1:42:18] of them came from the same spot
[1:42:24] sess success and failure launches from
[1:42:28] the same
[1:42:30] point the same
[1:42:33] place and so I I I I just wanted just to
[1:42:37] share that with you this evening and and
[1:42:42] and and that you know
[1:42:44] that this is something that the prophet
[1:42:47] of God taught and I could take you to
[1:42:49] more than one places you you listen to
[1:42:51] tapes you probably have
[1:42:53] many of the same thoughts and different
[1:42:56] things that he expressed that and like
[1:42:58] he said you go back to where you left
[1:43:00] him you go back to where it started you
[1:43:03] go back to where it caused the The
[1:43:06] Faults the feelings the judgments the
[1:43:09] opinions if you got a bad jealous Spirit
[1:43:12] you got a bad feeling to somebody go
[1:43:14] back to where you got
[1:43:17] it cuz he didn't give it to you that's
[1:43:20] right and and it changed es so remember
[1:43:24] things these things they change things
[1:43:28] and if things are trying to change our
[1:43:30] life and the enemy is trying to change
[1:43:33] our life he's trying to change our
[1:43:35] course he's trying to change our spirit
[1:43:38] he's trying to change our love one for
[1:43:40] another he's trying to change our
[1:43:42] forgiveness and our tenderness and our
[1:43:45] care one for another then we got to we
[1:43:48] got to keep those
[1:43:49] punches off of us amen you believe it
[1:43:53] amen Lord bless you I'm glad you enjoyed
[1:43:55] your tape let's Stand Together the
[1:43:58] Lord's good isn't he he's just so good
