[Music] it's precious [Music] who can cease [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] this is a really old song um i think i first heard it when i was in high school and thinking about what brother billy was preaching the other day you know when you sing a song it needs to be real to you and i remember singing this song i don't know 20 years ago um and it wasn't the same and recently i was just thinking you know over the years on everything that he's done for us and this song came on my heart and i was you know i could just remember the words and i thought wow that's a whole different song now that i've been married and have children and you go through the struggles of life but anyhow it's been on my heart and i just pray that it'll be a blessing and if you know it feel free to sing it with me [Music] when i first began to walk with the lord i didn't fully trust him how he longed for me to understand that i could [Music] so through the valley he let me operate as i could be until i felt his loving arms [Music] embracing me see i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me he's come through too many times and that puts my mind and i'll stake my very life that he's gonna take care of me [Music] you see i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me how could i ever doubt my god whose hands hold the universe and how could i ever question his ability there's no place that i can go where he doesn't know the things that trouble me he's always aware of where i believe him now after all these years he's been so faithful he's proven to be true nevermore will i doubt our question why because i've seen him work before and i know what my god can do i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me [Music] he's come through too many times and that puts my mind at ease [Music] that he's gonna take care of me you see i've been through enough to know you'll be enough for me i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me [Music] i trust you've been in through enough to know that there's enough for you amen amen amen let's all stand at this time amen amen you are not a god created [Music] oh [Music] you're the only god [Music] that's just the way [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] worthy of you are god that's just [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen he certainly stands as god alone if you have your bibles let's turn over into the book of matthew the 15th chapter of matthew and 21st verse and we'll start reading there in the matthew the 15th chapter and the 21st verse then jesus went hence and departed unto the coast to torah and siddhan and behold a woman of cana came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but jesus answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not meant to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said true lord yay the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as doubt will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen amen god bless you may be seated we're going to listen just a few minutes this evening of that portion of kate where brother van talks about her her attitude and this and the approach that she had and that great persistent attribute that she had to get what she was uh longing for and i just think you'll enjoy this 28 minutes god bless you as we listen this evening oh brother sister how the church of the living god or to stand and i persistent as long as we can feel the covet of the holy spirit the blood of jesus christ cleansing us from all sin we should never let nothing stand in our way persistent certainly john the great prophet that was spoke out to raise up when he was in the wilderness he was told by god there's looking for a messiah of course 400 years before that had a prophet but god told him in the wilderness he said now they'll try to tell you uh doctor so and so is the guy or to be the messiah if you're to announce him why he's the best person in our congregation and they're going to say well the the high priestess grandson up here he's a he's the guy should have it and so forth but look john this is a real job you've got to be sure so i'm going to give you a sign upon whom thou shall see the spirit descending and remaining upon that'll be the one that'll baptize with the holy ghost and fire john stood there watched over the congregations as they come and he everybody coming this that the other but he couldn't see one day while standing debating with the priest saying you mean to tell me the time will come and the daily sacrifice will be taken away he said there have come a man and he looked there it was he said behold there is the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he knew it because god had told him upon whom now shall see the spirit descending he knew it he was persistent back to this little woman we just got many things we could say about different ones that was perseverant persistent holding on to achieve i've got a little slogan that i say it quite a bit it might be good for you to take it a winner never quits and a quitter never wins just think of it a winner never quits and a quitter can't win you must hold on and before you even start be dead sure you're right and then be persistent let nothing move you go on i've had quite a bit of experience of that and you know it i know this one thing when you're dead sure that you're in the will of god when you're dead sure you're centered in calvary nothing's going to move you you're there this little woman she was a greek and a serpeo and she had heard about the fame of jesus how does faith come by hearing hearing of the word she had heard of him and you know she might have had a lot of things to hinder for her being a greek faith cometh by hearing we know that and she had a a lot of things to hinder her but faith finds a source no other knows anything about faith finds this source that no one can explain it it's something that you know others can't see it but faith sees it faith sees that where the natural eye doesn't see it but the inside eye sees that thing now she had a need of jesus she first thing you have to do if you're going to find christ you've got to know that you've got a need of him when you think that you just don't need him then you'll never find him because you won't search him diligently did you notice that scripture where it says seek and you shall find knock and it'll be open actually that's just not knock like and it'll be open s e that's not just say well i went out lord here i am you want me no that's not it he that seeketh he that knocketh continuation it has to compare with the rest of scripture like the unjust judge and the widow constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if he turned her away today to marshes on his hands again that's the way you want to get god be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking just don't knock a little while get tired and go away just keep standing there god i'm here and i'm not going to leave i'm on your hands now i'm going to stay right here getting tired listen i'm having a great time knocking going on oh you're coming that's when something happens yes get you off of his hands so he comes out to answer you now faith finds this his word is a sword the bible says in hebrews 4 12 that the word of god sharper than a two-eighth sword now there's only one thing can hold this sword that's the hand of faith the hand of faith is the only thing that can yield this sword of faith uh sword of the word now you might have a weak arm just enough to pick it up for justification you're so weak maybe that's all you can cut through but this sword of the wire will cut free every promise that god made in it if they got a good strong arm of faith holding it there i believe god for my healing i believe god for my baptism god made the promise and faith holds his sword it'll cut her out of the rock on earth every promise of god can be cut free by the word of god for it is a sword she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any you might have a lot of hindrances every person starts out to meet christ we're fine you got a lot of hindrances but your faith don't have any faith don't have no hinders faith has hairs on his chest great big muscles reasons raised up and said you know what's reasonable faith pulls his muscles back sticks out his big chest and said shut up sit down and reason jumps over the corner takes his stew run faith's got muscles and he he means what he says that's what we need tonight that's what the four square church needs that's what the pentecostal group needs that's what the whole world needs that's what i need that's what you need and we want to be ashamed to admit it but we need a faith that'll hold god's word and say it's true meet the devil say thus saith the lord i was reading they were a man said the devil got before him and said he's just a little bitty old evil and he said boo said i jumped back and said he said boo i jumped back every time he'd haul her boo and i'd jump back he'd get bigger and i'd get littler instead he kept saying boo said i'd get smaller each time i want to jump back and he'd get bigger said i know they had to fight him after a while said i looked around but what i found the word of god said i wrote it in my hand and the devil said boo and i said boo back and said when i said boo back every time i said boo he got smaller and i got bigger that's it you've got to fight him sooner or later you know the people don't believe is the devil i run into him all the time head into him every day any other believer does yes you got to fight him sooner or later so he might as well start right now he's only one thing he's afraid of is that blood in that word faith holds it it's strong marches on now find out this little greek woman as i said she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any faith don't have any henderson they might have said to her you know you're a greek you're you're a greek uh you know you don't belong to his denomination don't go down there that bunch now that's one of the hindrances see but if you've got faith you're going anyhow i don't make any what denominations he's in just so he's there she had a need she had a daughter that was dying with epilepsy and she had to get to him because the doctors couldn't do nothing for her can't do it yet so she had to get to jesus she'd hurt it he'd heal those kind of cases well they said he's not he's not he never come with his revival to your denominations that didn't hinder that little woman had faith she was persistent she just passed that group her faith pulled her away from it oh if he could just do that today somebody says in the meeting right down to four square church well it don't belong to your denomination you better stay away from down there just press right on through your faith takes your enemy see faith has no hindrance it goes anyhow nothing's going to stop it like i said it's brawny big muscles it's got the floor the rest of them scared of it yes sir they'll run from it like smallpox they just get plumb away they ain't got nothing to do with that but big faith raises up say i know who i believe i'm persuaded that's it you know i've been another group that come along say the days of miracles has passed there is no such a thing as that that's a bunch of holy rollers now i am jews we are greece we're smart we're intelligent group of people we give the world art music and religion and there's no such a thing as that but she was persistent days of miracles wasn't passed for her because something done totally down here that it wasn't and if jesus had what she was looking for and she was determined to get to him regardless of her denomination sponsored it or not she's going anyhow she's going to get down there she was persistent still persistent days and miracles might be passed for them but it wasn't for her that's what it is with every believer then people say the days of miracles a man told me some time ago said i don't care what you'd say mr branham but i don't believe there is such a thing as divine healing i said certainly not to you it wasn't for unbelievers just for those who believe that's right it wasn't sent to unbelievers it was sent to believers you can't enjoy it because you know nothing about it he won't tell me there was no such thing as the holy ghost i said you're just about 33 years too late for that i said i know better i've done received it ah nonsense as it might be to you but not to me it's real to me it's life something anchored you come too late to tell me that they've come too late tell us about divine healing we'd have been healed we've not been filled with the holy ghost we done got raptured in grace amen it's too late for any of those things he might as well shut up we done got it our faith can say sound i know what i'm talking about well doctors i don't care what doctor so-and-so said the bible said it and i've got faith in that book in my hand and my faith holds it out there jesus is coming i believe that i receive the holy ghost because i see him living in my life hey man it's according to the word nothing unmanifested revelation a perfect vindication of the bible being right jesus christ the same yesterday then forever let them laugh that away they could laugh all they want to we'll just be as persistent as it was when noah was moses was all the rest of the impersonators raising up james and champions threw their rod down turned into a snake there was those men just as honorable as they could be did exactly what god told them doing there come a bunch of impersonation up throw down their rods the only thing they could do is just stand still and see the glory of god amen god will stand by it if he's sensing you're sure of it you're going to achieve the work that god predestinated for you to do you'll stand there and god will take every carnal impersonator away from it right stand there you can be persistent because you know who you have believed and what's right examine your revelation with the word if it's contrary to the word leave it alone if it's with the word god's bound duty bound to keep his word now now there might have been a bunch of ladies stand down the corner uh you know and they said here she comes now she's got that kid up here it's got epilepsy in and dr so and so said that that there's no cure for epilepsy and here she is going down to that off-brand denomination down there for that fanatic prophet to come up here and heal that child so they said we are to stop susie i hope there's not a susie here but we are to stop susie and tell her because she's been a good woman there's nothing against her life but we are to stop her and the only thing i don't do she's passed by everybody else so she won't break this barrier you know what susie your husband will leave you because he's the trustee or deacon of the lord and he'll leave you sure as the world if you go down there she was still persistent she went right on see faith don't know no hindrance it must get there then she passed another group and said you know what when you return back defeated and find out there's nothing to it everybody in the neighborhood will laugh at you that didn't even make her ears turn red she was persistent she went right on i like that i like that persistence then he urged one of the deacons and said if you go down there you know what they're going to do put you out of your church because you've associated yourself with them holy or the people i said you know excuse me oh maybe i said it you associate yourself with them you'll get put out your church she was still persistent faith knows no defeat she had one thing to achieve and that was get to jesus she had a need and he was the only one who had that need i'm seeing this tonight brother and sister i'm 53 years old i've been serving him since about 20. he's met everything that i had to need and when it comes to the hour of my death i'm sure what i need right then two wings to reach across the river he'll be there don't you worry i know he'll be there i'll just stick the old sword back in the sheath and take off the helmet lay it down up on the river when i bank when i hear the dashers and i'll scream send out the lifeboat i'm coming home this morning it'll be there yes sir the morning star will come down and light up the way across the river we'll go yes sir amen she was persistent she had an achievement she knew that she had to be persevered in order to get to jesus so she had to pass by everything finally she arrived now finally got here everything's fine now and then here come another hindrance the very man that she'd profess to have confidence in the man she tried to get to jesus he said i'm not sent to your race would that have not made us pentecostal blow up i'm not sent to your race that was a shock but you know what he knows no shock and then again he turns around after all these things should pass through and her faith holding that she knew that jesus could give her her desire and she went through every one of these barriers and when she got to him and turned down flat i'm not even sent to your race i can imagine standing in her eyes gleaming she was in front of me man that's all she had to be and said besides that you're a race ain't nothing but a bunch of dogs oh my what if it said that to you you said i'll take my papers from this four square and go over to somewhere else i'll never go back there again i'll take it from so and so oh yes yes sir but still she held on oh see faith knows no defeat ain't nothing going to stop it though jesus said to her the very one she come to said i'm not sent to your race and they're nothing but a bunch of dogs but what she had a hold of real faith faith knows no defeat i don't care where it comes from knows no defeat because she had faith still she held on oh i love that she was not a hotbed plant a hybrid like some of them today these high bred religions we got today you know ain't no good everything now is hybrid hybrid even they got hybrid churches hybrid christians talking by shaking their hands oh they can dress better and maybe use better english and so forth like that ain't got no life in it you take a big fine ear corn hybrid maybe it's twice as pretty as the other one plant it it'll die that's right we don't want nothing hybrid we want the genuine thing if you haven't got it stay there till it comes why except the substitute when the pentecostal skies are full of the reel nothing hybrid it won't stain you have to always spray a hybrid plant keep the bugs off of it that's where some of these hybrid christians you have to baby them and pet them and promise them they'll be deacon or something else keep some of the worldly bugs from them of unbelief then get out of the church kick them out anyhow never was in you can't join a church you might join a lodge you can join the methodist lodge baptist lodge or pentecostal lodge but if you ever come to christ you'll be born into the church that's right the mystical body of christ others are lodges that's right it's all right nothing against them but you're born into the church of the living god by the spirit of god you can't join it at all and when you're born in there you got a birth you're not a hybrid no more a hand joiner or a hitchhiker no hitchhiker's always thumbing that's way well i know but doctor so-and-so no no that's it that's it exactly she was persistent she wasn't a hybrid you had to spray her over with perfume make her right she stood there part of our crop today too many of them's hybrids just a couple like david duplis i believe once said god has no grandchildren troubled our pentecostal movement we're getting pentecostal grandchildren they come in because our fathers and mothers for pentecostal we take them in on the cradle roll and they come up without the experience and there they say they're a pentecostal too no sir god don't have grandchildren he ain't grandfather he's father right if you ever get to heaven you'll pay the price like your mother did your daddy did amen that might sound crude but it's true it's crude way of making a point but you understand that kind of english i'm sure it isn't very good english it gets the point what i'm trying to say you just listen to her yes she wasn't a hybrid she didn't have to be sprayed over and baby now well i sister dear i i i tell you no no no sir and no matter what knocked her down she said truth we're nothing but a bunch of dogs it's true that we're not worthy of it oh my she admitted that he was right i'm going to say a great big mouthful get ready every time genuine faith will admit the words right and anytime that if something says that the days of miracles has passed or something against the bible it's not genuine faith of faith will always admit truth must stay with the word no matter what anything else says what anybody else says it's the words right let every man's word be a lie and mind true every who will add to or take away from the same will be take this part out of the book of life god's going to judge the world by a church which one catholic 660 somehow different denominations how is he going to do that god's going to judge the world by jesus christ and christ in the beginning was the word the word is with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god and the word is the same this is god on print you've got the you've got the holy spirit plant that seed in there it brings it to life breaks that life forth and manifested and vindicated jesus said in saint john 12 he that believeth on me saint john 14 12 rather the works that i do shall he do also so it always admits to the truth oh my but you know she said that's true we ain't nothing but a bunch of dogs and we're not you're really wasn't sent to us but large i'm not looking for all the bread the children had i'm only searching for crumbs oh my how'd you notice people they want to get this get healed and get the holy spirit the way they think they ought to have it now i'll come down brother if you'll bring me up and take me into the room where nobody will see me and you lay your hands up on me and bless me and put the holy ghost in me i'll accept it oh no naaman going to accept this healing like that one time but elijah told him to get out there in her old muddy jordan and dipped seven times i can just see him get off his chariot oh great man hold his nose gary comes out the water tip tore like a cat molasses going coming out like this getting out i can't get out of water he said oh i hate to do this hot top down some people come see the older like it is sickening affair for them yeah oh i don't want to do that you duck one time i still got leprosy the prophet said seven times right until he obeyed the word completely until you obeyed completely he had a good man standing on the bank said the prophet said seven times father just keep on dipping that's it if you don't get it the first night just dip again the next night just keep on get get him now remember she was like rehab the harlot this little woman was she had never seen a miracle she'd only heard about a miracle what was she doing the day of judgment to us she had never seen a miracle she was a gentile she had never seen but she had heard and we've both seen and hurt and stilled out oh my she was like rehab the heart when the spies come over she didn't have to say oh yeah i tell you you bring joshua over and let him hold a service to me and i see the way he grooms his hair and the way he talks and the adequacy uses at the pulpit and i'll see whether i can accept him and how i've done she said i have heard that the god of heaven was with you the only thing i asked is to be spared there you are that little woman was really persistent she helped right on just spare me i'll do anything that you want me to do oh there you are that's it this little woman no matter what the difficult was she was persistent oh she had the right approach to the gift of god she had the right approach humility she fell down at his feet and she had humility she didn't stop saying you wait just a minute you know what we people agreed she said we were dogs just a minute here sir do you realize that we are we're the masters of art and we're the masters of so-and-so and such-and-such she never thought of that at all she just admitted that he was right and fell down at his feet and said help me lord i'll just eat the crumbs if my daughter can't have a whole slice of bread will you just let her have the crumbs if she's a dog oh my god there you are would we be satisfied with just the crumbs if the holy spirit should reveal to somebody tonight you're healed would you be ready just to take the crumbs or do you want god to walk over and raise you up and give you some kind of a feeling if you just say in your heart my sickness is over you haven't got it no more i believe that i'm going to be healed from the night on would you take the crumbs or would you want uh everybody come up lay hands on you and pour all and go through the regular ritual like that are you just looking for crumbs god will honor that you know many of the disciples have seen him after his resurrection thomas said no i won't believe it i got to put my hands in the prince of his nails in his hands and in his side then i'll believe it he said come here thomas said touch me and he did he said my lord and my god he said thomas because you have seen and felt and everything you believe yes lord said how much greater is their reward who has never seen and yet will believe you are we ready are we gentiles like that gentile woman was she an example to all of us just give me the crumbs lord just let me hear some man i've never read the word but tell me that you heal the sick uh that chrome will be enough for me i believe it let me hear somebody say and read it from the word that the holy ghost peter said on the day of pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise isn't to you and to your children and to them it's far off even as many as the lord are god shall call lord i feel it that's right that's a crumb come on that's all you have to do come are we ready to take the crumbs are we ready to humble ourselves she was she was ready to humble herself faith always admits the word right faith is always humble faith humbles itself now she was just looking for the crumbs watch what jesus said for this saying for this saying i'm willing to take the crumbs lord for this saying thy child is whole you have your request because you believe it faith admits that the word of god is right faith admits all these things amen did you enjoy that i i think there's a lot of a lot of right things in there for us that we can hold to and it certainly demonstrates the uh the attribute and the characteristic of a real believer amen it come from her heart she said she didn't know what it was but there was something down in there you know who put that down something down in there he did he did it for all of us let's open our bibles and stand as we prepare for communion turn to the 11th chapter of the first corinthians 11 chapter and the 23rd verse the brothers that are going to serve the communion if they would go prepare it and do you have that determination in your heart uh you you know i i like where how brother brahms says you put put yourself on god's hands make them deal with you make them do something you know and sometimes we don't think we can have that attitude towards god but yet that's the very same attitude he wants you to have you know like he said the unjust judge he made those type you just keep knocking if you don't answer you should be there the next day god i'm here god i'm here i want this i need this i got to have this and you just keep pressing press and press and pressing and don't stop i like that don't you amen it gives me hope i have no strength if he don't answer i have no victory if he don't answer lord you have to answer 23rd verse of the 11th chapter of the first gospel or epistle of paul to the corinthians first corinthians 11 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this duty as often actually drink it in remembrance of me for often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore who shall whosoever shall eat this bread or drink of this cup the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let them eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come amen amen do you love the lord tonight let's just pray as the brothers bring the bread and the wine and we'll ask you to bless it let us pray together you have a special need on your heart just something before the lord that you want to maybe you have a weakness in your life that is a sin that so easily besets you and you're just battling so against it you just like to say lord you know in my heart i i don't want to do these things i want to be right i ask you to forgive me and help me lord i want to partake of you you're the only one that could help me you're the only one that you already know lord you're the only one that can help me lord i want to come and partake of you and your nature i want deliverance there's healing in communion there's deliverance in it let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord as we look upon this bread that you broke or in remembrance of the sacrifice that you made for us at calvary that your word is made indeed and lord it is life and we can live by the life of your word in every circumstance your word can control the circumstance your word can change things your word can provide for us your word can put food on our table lord your word can put money in our account it can it can give us jobs lord it can fix things there's nothing that the word can't do father all things every good and perfect thing comes from the father above heavenly fathers we partake of this bread that represents that word we ask you to bless it to us father would you increase our faith father for she certainly was the prophet spoke of this little stereophone this little canaan woman this greek she was certainly an example of the faith that we should have of believers father and we've seen how much more should our faith be strong father we ask you to bless this bread and this wine father that represents the stimulation of our faith by revelation the life that was in the blood returned upon the believer father we take it tonight and ask you
