and father we trust that our hearts are set on the right motive the right objective and the right goal and father that we love you above the things of the world and that's Lord we desire with all to have a pure heart and a righteous heart religion's just a covering father anyone can wrap thems in their religion with their lips they can worship you and yet the scripture says as their hearts are far from you Lord May our hearts desire to draw closer and to draw nigh and ever be with you we just ask that you could bless us to evening in your goodness in your holy word we pray this evening in this evening service father bless those who have come out we ask you to be with us now in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen let's let's open our Bibles again to just that little verse in Matthew 4 and4 and and just to uh reset and just move a little forward in the good things of the Lord and it says in Matthew 4 and4 but he answered and said it is written man man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen living by every word God bless you you may be seated amen oh this looks like about an ice cream crowd tonight doesn't it to me well I guess we put the ultimatum out didn't we like who wants to follow well you know what so you know that that's okay can you can you you know we know it's not going to be many anyway right so I mean just pick somebody that's not here and put them out of the boat no we draw a bigger Circle don't we so anyway we're happy to be here in the house of the Lord because we love God's word and and I there there's a uh um just a just to continue with a little thought uh something that so blessed me out of this message and I just wanted to read the statement again but I I'd like just to uh uh just take uh uh another uh scripture here that reads and Jesus said now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when its branches yet tender and put it forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise when ye shall see all these things know ye it's near even at the door verily verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things shall be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away way and and you know I I truly believe that every word of God every promise he made is true that we can count on it um and you know uh uh you know like healing and so many things it it's for believers healing is for believers and and we we know that that all men don't have faith we understand that uh Salvation though it's for all men it's in one way in another way it's not for all people uh they just can't find it within them to accept it but you know faith is Peter says it's by these great and precious promises that we're partakers of divine nature and faith is what pleases God in the believer that to have faith you you must have faith that believes God and I I I just like to read this statement out of the message the unfailing words of Promise his unfailing words of Promise because we know if God said it it's got to happen it's true that's one thing uh that God can't do you know you don't hear very many statements that God can't do this and God can't do that but uh uh uh one of the great writers was so moved it said that God cannot lie and so he swore he swore by himself that he can't lie so he can't make a promise that won't come to pass and and that's what that that's what our our resting place is so faith has got to have a resting place so it's it it it seeks Faith seeks for something that it can hold on to uh something that it trust it's it's built upon something and we know that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and the prophet of God puts it this way he says faith is by hearing the word Okay so uh and so faith is by hearing the word but then he adds this little portion to it which I think is a exciting he says the Word of Promise so Faith cometh by hearing the word The Word of Promise well you can read in the scripture uh many scriptures a historical uh Chronicles and events of the king and and those things are true facts it would be like reading a history book you know George Washington crossed the Delaware well my heart doesn't swell up with faith when I hear that George Washington crossed the Delaware that that's a a a fact if I could say that well our faith isn't rested on the fact but it's rested in a promise so that's where that's where faith has to Anchor it's got to have something that anchor to it's got to have something that it knows is going to respond to it and and and that's what God's promise is it it's the response to you hearing his promise and and accepting that promise and believing that promise and now this is a a tremendous uh statement here if we could just take a moment before we all go have have ice cream it said if you don't have a promise then you're venturing out upon your own faith now now just think of that if if you don't have a promise you're you're you're trying to make it on your own and a lot of people they want things they want things to happen they want things to change they want things to transpire they want things to be different and and then it becomes a hope they they Venture after it without a promise they don't have a promise for the result they don't have something that they can hold on to that knows that the result's coming the result isn't coming by hearing the word the word brings faith in the promised word that he said so that's what your faith is rested it's rest ing in what he said what he promised he promised if you confess your sins that he'd be faithful and just to forgive them that's a promise now can you imagine confessing your sins and not knowing whether he forgives them or not but if you believe that if you believe that promise that he said if you confess your sins that he he'll be faithful and just to forgive him then when you confess your sins you know that they're forgiven it's it's not a hope so it's not a wondering it you know and and he goes on to say this and he says he says but if you can take a promise of God that's God's promise to you so what are what's your faith in my faith is in the word of God my faith is in the promise that he made to me that he made this promise and and if he made this promise then I can uh what what are what's your confidence in what what what are you resting in I'm resting in the fact that God can't promise it and then not perform it now I can reject the promise or I can say the promise is not for me or that promis is for somebody else but once I take possession of that promise now I've got faith because my faith has a resting place and that resting place is the promise of God I said I believe that God promised me he promised me he wouldn't leave me nor forsake me but he'd be with me even in me till the end that's a promise now I don't have I I can't undo that promise unbelief doesn't stop God if you believe God and you take God at this ear he will perform that promise I've seen God give people the very things they prayed for and asked for and they turned it down they didn't stick with it they didn't hold to it they weren't persevering but I want to go a little someplace with this just real quick because there there's we are we are up to up up against such a great challenge in this hour that it that it would cause us to shrink back but we've got to know that that we have a promise and so he says now he said look listen to this he says the woman that touched His Garment had no promise of that there was no promise in the Bible that said If You Touch the Hem of His Garment you shall be healed now we have a promise we have a promise if we Touch the Hem of His Garment that we be healed why because if he does it for one he'll do it for for everyone so we have that word so now we have that promised word it's precept upon precept line upon line promise upon promise so now we know that if You Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment he'll heal you so you say well how do I know that because we we have the promise if he ever does one thing one time he'll do it the same if a man meets God on the same condition God will provide the same answer every time because he's an unchangeable God I am God and I change not so that that's what a Believer does he starts taking the building stones of God's word and he lays for himself a Cornerstone and Jesus Christ being that Chief Cornerstone he builds upon it let every man watch how he builds so we could we can start walking by promise that's what God desires his church to do is to walk by promise so she didn't even have a promise of that she said he said but her faith without a promise got her healed now if she could get her healing by her faith without a promise in what she was doing how much more ought we to get our healing by faith in a promise that God is manifesting and vindicating before us and has brought it to us by his word come around and confirm his word now is God a respector of persons certainly not if he heals one he'll heal the other oh that's a promise he said there's only one thing you have to do is appropriate that faith and that faith is something that you know not something you Ponder or guess at you know it something happens now Through the Ages people have rested upon this now so I'm not approaching this from Divine Healing and because we know God's A Healer we have a lot of evidence that God's A Healer I'm approaching it from the promise that God said that he'd have a church without spot or without wrinkle now that's a promise and when I look in the mirror I see spots and I see wrinkles now what am I going to look at it's what I'm going what am I going to focus on what what am what am I want to be I want to be different so if I could say it this way I want to be well I want to be spiritually well I I want to live according to the promises of God's word I want to be victorious everything that he's talking and describing his church that she will be is a promise that's right he said she will be this way she will be one with him she'll be one with the word she she she won't compromise she won't do all these things now I could take all those things and and allow those things con to condemn me or I could look at those things and said this is a promise to me and if God promised it he'll fulfill it and he'll fulfill it in me I believe that I appropriate the faith that he speaking of me and now if if he promised to do that so we understand that that it the same things that we use so many times for healing of the flesh are the same basis by which we heal our Spirits we heal our lives we overcome if there's something in your life you know is contrary to the word and you're paddling in it and you don't want it to be there how how are you going to to uh deliver it and have deliverance from it without a promise you're venturing out on your own faith but if you know you have a promise that the bride wouldn't have this in your life then you know that that promise is given to you you can look forward to that Deliverance you can speak that Deliverance you can claim that Deliverance because God has the power to transform that's what we're trusting you say well I don't I don't have it I have it by promise if you have it by promise it's just just as good as being in your pocket it's like someone gave you two quars for a loaf of bread you can walk down the road grab those two quarters and say see my loaf of bread cuz you know by promise that those two quarters are going to be transformed into a loaf of bread that's what they were given for that's what they're going to perform that's what they're going to do and the believer can can look at that and and he can realize that and so God makes all kinds of uh uh his whole book is is his Covenant with man it's his promises to man both good and bad I promise you if you do this and you do this and you do this you won't this won't happen but I also promise you if you do this and you do this and you do this this will happen everything with God is based on his word but not just his word as we look at it as the Bible but the words of Promise his his his his words of Promise they're unfailing words of Promise they will not fail and then when we read because because I I believe that the the the signs of his coming are are are so uh just so evident around us the condition of man the condition of the world the the uh the the the hatred that they have we were talking with some brothers and they were telling me uh and they were telling me about a couple that was taking their way wedding vows that they had been married for or not married but what do you call it courting um engaged for two years and and they came to the Altar and and and uh uh the the they were going to take their vows and they came to the lady and they said uh will you do this and she saidou know she said I can't and he he looked back he said you know and and I don't know what it was it was maybe his stance on a certain social issue of the day you know uh you know the way that you feel about a certain political view and I thought two and a half years you've been courting and all of a sudden you decide you can't marry this person because of a political view like saying I can't marry you because you're a Republican and I'm a Democrat one thing they they've lost it it's it it it's since when did that ever have anything to do with anything you know how if you vote you you notice you can't go into that voting booth with anybody but yourself I didn't tell the lady at the voting booth I'm going to go in with my wife to make sure she votes the way that I vote else we're getting a divorce I mean it the things have have got so ins significant and and and and so deceptive and like I told you before I remember boy when the election was on and all of a sudden KLA Harris is running for president and and the polls were saying that she was leading all the Believers are going oh woman president that's exactly what brother Brandon promised oh oh say he prophesied and oh now we're we're we're at the end time now and and boy I better get right with God and then and then November 7th come along and and uh everybody goes the world's not going to end yes it is nothing's changed the devil just put on a different face what are they what's what are they saying now peace and safety I'll have peace I'll have problem Prosperity I'll have this yay peace prosperity and and what's the promise then sudden destruction you think that we got a new savior in town he ain't saving nothing a prophet told me this country was gone he told me it was morally bankrupt he told me there was no turning back you think oh well we got four years so where are we at now one guy does four years the next guy undoes it and then what's going to happen in the next four years I'll tell you I'd anchor in Jesus Christ I would anchor in a promise I would find a promise what did he promise me and so I I thought of this statement that we heard this morning and if you would turn with me because I just want to read uh the scriptures found in St John the 17th chapter and and our messenger put it to us this way this morning he said Jesus said that they may be one father as you and I are one not for some man to be over something it never will work it'll never work if you're in a fellowship you're in a church you're in something where uh uh in Christian Life where one man's over another man you know by God's word it's not going to work we are put here on free moral agency we are put here to choose and there's something in you that chooses God's word nobody can fear you in to living for God all fear does is cause you to do it in secret but if you have the Holy Spirit convicting you in your heart he'll separate sear at you from the things that aren't of him he will do that for you well listen what he said I thought it was fantastic he said it'll never work one denomination wants to take over the other and one man over another one but that you might be one with God like like Christ and God was one that's what the prayer is that's what the prayer is he said that was the word and Jesus prayed that we might be the word reflecting him that's what he prayed for that's his prayer PR to be answered now when I read that I thought wait a minute that was his prayer that I and the father might be one that was his prayer for me not only one but one as he was one with the father that there's a union an invisible Union between the Earthly uh uh bride in the Heavenly bridegroom that there's a Oneness that there's something that's promised to me it doesn't matter my condition if I have the promise the promise prevails over my condition and it's not a fact I could take John Beal here I could say John Beal's worth 10 million he's worth millions and millions that's a fact but if I said John Beal promised me any time I needed a million I would have it that's different ain't that right John now I ain't bankrupt now I got a million sitting right there I also have ocean front property to sell in Arizona that's closer to the promise you see what I'm trying to say see it's it's the promise that makes all the difference it isn't the fact in other words to say God Is A Healer that's the same as me saying John has 10 million but when I can say God has promised me my healing then I'm not basing it on the fact that God can heal I'm not basing it on the fact that he's a Healer my my faith isn't in the fact that God's A Healer my faith is not in the fact that God's capable of doing all things my faith isn't in the fact that history has said that he's a Healer my faith is in the fact that he promised me my healing it's my promise he promised me now my faith is in the promise not in the fact because the promise is the power he'll do it because he said though he said he'd heal my kids he would save my children but he Satan put that one to the test Dave's not here so I'll just tell on them and there's not very many of you here so you probably won't remember anyway you know but he he got in trouble you know so they took him to the city clink and uh so he's sitting in the city clink and he decides to he decided to let him go so they release him well he still got his City clink uniform on so off the school he goes right in this class uless jail how long do you think that lasted you say boy that kid's doomed uh-uh I had a promise I had a promise and one day he got converted and one day we're sitting there in a grandstand and one of his teachers leans over and says are you David McGary and he says yes he said I saw the difference in you when you gave your life to the Lord and it was an inspiration to me what prevailed the promise it didn't care what Satan did it didn't care what Matthew did or Aaron did or any of them did that wasn't what I was basing it on it wasn't they they could have written a Litany of things but they all preach the gospel today why cuz I did something no cuz I raised them right no because I had a promise now was God a savior it's always been a savior is he a Healer he's always been a Healer is he a deliverer he's always been a deliverer but as long as they remain facts they sit on the Shelf but when you take them off the shelf as a promise then it's the promise that empowers the word it's the promise behind the word that gives it its Eternal result you know I have someone that every time they do something they say I'm sorry I said well you were supposed to be here I'm sorry and I said you know did you do this no I'm sorry and finally one day I asked him I said wait a minute is that a statement of fact or a statement of contrition are you telling me you're sorry you understand what I mean when I say that it got to the point where all he's saying is I'm a sorry person I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm no good I'm sorry but obviously it wasn't a state of Contrition because if you repent of something then there should be change following but if you just keep saying I'm sorry I'm sorry with no mink for repentance no nothing changes nothing does there's no effort put forth I'm sorry just becomes a statement of fact you might as well just put a sign on your back says I'm a sorry person I am sorry not apologetic just plain sorry because there's no apology in it if you're sorry you try to change you try to put something forth now we have a promise and the prophet of God placed it like this he said St John 17 was Jesus's prayer to be answered now all of a sudden this prayer becomes a promise to me and it it this this is marvelous you know many times when we we read the scripture and we'll take it and where Jesus says they said teach us to pray he said pray like this our father but you know another way to learn to pray is go to the example of him praying and let's just read these prayers and close these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou hath given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him and this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent I have glorified thee on Earth I have finished the work which thou givest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou givest me out of the world thine they were and thou givest them me and they have kept my word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hath given me are of thee that's right for I have given unto them thy Words which thou givest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me for they are thine all mine are thine and all thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now now I'm going and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou haast given me that they may be one as we are one keep me father that now becomes a promised to me keep me Father keep me I want to be kept while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou given me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scriptures might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves these are things that he's praying for okay so now I look at this now I've got a promise Jesus is praying for me he's asking the father that I can be one now you say here I I said I'm a sorry individual with all kinds of shortcomings temper anger fly off the handle uh get frustrated discouraged every condition that you can put on but now I have a promise that he's prayed for me and it's a prayer that has to be answered oh something's getting out of my hands you understand God's doing something God's got the power to transform God's got the power to hear that prayer God's got the power to bring that past it didn't matter yeah I I never prayed for my kids you don't pray for your kids oh God when they all get straightened up save them no you don't care where they are go to wherever they are Lord you'll say things like if you have to put them in the hospital if you have to put them in jail do whatever it takes to save them Lord I had a man come one time wanted prayer he came up and he said I said what would you like he said well I want to get a a ticket to go overseas because I'm a great athlete and I'm I'm going to want to go play in worldwide something or other in sport I said you want me to pray for that I said I ought to pray that God breaks your leg really I'm Ain going to pray that you get a ticket to go over and you know be sinner star I mean I mean you have to admit that's a lot of G I wish some of us had Faith like that but he just come up I want to be a star I'm a star you know and I'm I want to I'm GNA go over and be a you know make the world cup or something like that I thought well I said I'm not going to pray for that I said you you want me to pray that that you break your leg well that I'll pray for Lord do whatever it takes no matter what it is right isn't that the way you'd pray now look who you got praying for you he's praying for you all this whole prayer that they might know the joy that they might be one that thou keep us from the world all these things these are prayers that are going to be answered in me you say why because I look at them as a promise they're a promise they're a promise to me he promised me this I'm I'm not going to fret over my inability to overcome when I have a promise that'll overcome for me he gave the promise to bring my victory he didn't command me to get the victory he command in me to believe his promises these great and precious promises allow us to be partakers of divine nature of the attributes of God let's just finish quickly it said that they may be one as we are one and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them Thy Word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world and I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from the evil oh God you prayed for me that you would keep me from the evil Lord Lord I I know you'll get me through this I know I can overcome this I know you'll keep me from the evil Jesus prayed for me they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth another promise as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sake I Sanctified myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word Oh my he just made it all personal didn't he it's all personal now now these become unfailing words of promise to me you say I got a bad habit I got a promise for that habit I've got some real weaknesses I I I've been going to church a long time and I have just a lot of things that just ain't right I got a promise that he can transform me he can change me he can make me right he can give me the victory he promised because he promised he would have a bride he promised that she would be there she promised and he promised that this elect lady would come on the scene and because he promised it it'll come to pass it doesn't come to pass because of the promise or because they believe the promise they believe the promise because he already brought it to pass I don't know if I can express that to you the way that I want to express it but God's Word of Promise is unfailing it's unfailing and what he asks for is unfailing so he's going to Calvary and he's saying father I'm going to go lay my life down I'm going to fulfill the work here are the things that I'm asking asking you to do this is what I'm laying my life down for that you keep those that were thine they're mine that you keep them from the world that you put the joy in them that we have that they become one that was what his whole promise to the church is that's where God's path is taking us is into this fellowship with the father this is a promise to us and man's still trying to do it through the law and keeping rules and trying to think that oh if if I I got if I if I miss one offering or I miss a service or I do this or I do oh I'm out or you're out that's not what I heard heard I heard all the father hath given me had come and if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life nothing can put it on and nothing can take it off that's a promise I am not going to ever be able to hold the law in my heart through fear but I can live the law Naturally by love I can do it naturally with the love of the Lord for all that he done for me it just becomes our reasonable service and I I just love that so much he says neither I pray for these alone but for them which also Shall Believe on me through the word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hath sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou haast sent me and hath loved them as thou ha loved me father I will that they also whom thou givest me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou haast given me for thou ha lovest me before the foundation of the world oh righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherein thou Hast loved me may be in them and I in them he ends this prayer with the Capstone if you want a vision of your the path forward it's promised to us it's believing the unfailing Word of Promise believing what he promised knowing that he promised to have this elect lady that he was going to have this bride word that she was going to be one and that the love that they have was going to bind together he said that they all may be one can you imagine we've got lots of different churches in town do we really want everybody in town to come here I don't but they're all my brothers they're all my sisters I'll Fellowship them where we agree I'll Fellowship him with the blood I'll Fellowship him in the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'll Fellowship him in works I'll Fellowship them with un sanctification wherever they want to Fellowship I'm willing to Fellowship I just want to be one I want the love that the father have the way that he loved them and laid his life down for them even though they don't have the Revelation I didn't come upon the revelations God gave me the Revelation I never figured out that God sent a prophet I never opened my Bible one day and read Malachi 4:5 and said that's William Mariam random I'll prove it to you uh-uh he had to bring it my way he had to open my eyes to it he had to let me see it I sat right with people that sat and listened to the same tape I listened to some got up and walked away in another state as true to it as could be it's election he chose me you have not chosen me I have chosen you and all the father hath given me will come I'm not the divider of the sheeps and goats right right I don't I don't have to know who's a goat and who's a sheep me being a Christian is in me if God doesn't have any respect to persons and I'm supposed to be one like him then I shouldn't have a respector a person I'll call Sin Sin and I'll call the devil the devil but as far as people you know I never heard brother brand come up and somebody come up in the Prine say are you a Methodist are you a Baptist are you a Pentecostal what are you he'd ask me if they believed do you believe that I'm God's servant do you believe that I'm God's Prophet you believe if the spirit tells you what's wrong with you would you believe that it's him look at what he was trying to get him to see and here tonight we have a promise that God is going to call out a bride that he has a prayer that he prayed in the garden that we would be one with him that the love where in he loved him would be in us and that we we'd be one and the joy that we had would be one and he prayed that prayer and the prophet of God says that prayer has to be answered it's the prayer to be answered and I lift my hand and I say I'm sorry and I am sorry but I've got a promise and that promise is going to transform me from Death un life from a liar to a truth speaker from a luster to loving from from doing what's right from being nervous to being full of Faith to being suspicious to having confidence whatever parallel you come it doesn't matter where you are the promise is what we rest in because the promise is what changes without a promise you're on your own faith but with a promise you know it's God is going to do it and I I just hope that encourages you because I when I read that I just I I just thought my my not one of the that prayer is going to go unanswered CU he said ask anything in my father's name and he will grant it he said if you're if you're offended 70 time 70 in one day forgive them you know what I thought in my heart I'm so glad he practices what he preaches I'm so glad that everything that Jesus preached he practiced and I can certainly rest this evening so thank you for coming out I I hope next weekend if anybody's streaming that uh next week you won't stream but you'll come out to hear Bill Ivy Bill iy's been a dear friend of mine for a long time and and and I know Bill he'll preach to one if one shows up but I would really appreciate uh if you would come out uh next Sunday night and next Sunday morning uh if you are listening maybe you can make a a effort to do something and also I know that they've made the announcement for the 39 and under um uh coup's dinner on uh April 11th and we said if you're engaged uh you can come so anybody that wants to go to that wants to run out and get engaged teach real quick you're you're you're you're welcome to to come to that and and you say well and I know that it was easy for the 40 and over group because we didn't have too many children and I know a lot of the younger ones have children but we had over 30 couples that were over 40 so you might talk to some of them about babysitting so uh maybe you can get a few babysitters together and be able to come out to that so uh we'll we'll have all the plans at what we're going to do and uh either we'll cater it or or maybe do a potluck but we don't want you to have to be doing all your family and and then cooking too so we'll have something nice so that's coming up and then the Sunday April 13th it'll be our oneyear anniversary from being in the building so it's going to be our first year anniversary and it's going to be the dedication of the Pavilion so when we dedicated the church we preached right we're going to dedicate the Pavilion we're going to cook right you need to dedicate it for what it's used for so we'll get out our big grill and we'll have hamburgers and hot dogs and and if you bring a dish uh you can put cold dishes in the refrigerator over there frozen in the freezer and and you can wrap your stuff up and put it in the kitchen then after service we'll go out and we'll have uh a nice uh lunch and cook some things and and just have a time of fellowship and then after that's over at 5:00 everybody who wants to will just come back in here and have a singing and just sing and have a time of fellowship and everything so that's our plans for the future so this coming weekend brother Bill Ivy I you'll enjoy brother Bill a longtime believer in this message and and and just uh uh just really um has been faithful and has a lovely group of people that are solid so I'm real uh happy to be able to have the opportunity now to invite uh brother Bill down to preach us so if you'll do that and then also if uh uh I I'll go up to uh the custard place up here and I'll be there and if you want to order Custer at least it's not 30 degrees outside you know what I mean so and you want to come up and get an ice cream cone I notice I say ice cream cones and then people bump it up to Sundays and and what do they call that a crush or a uh what concrete see they're already wanting to order concrete so I if you want concrete get concrete I I I don't care but I I do appreciate you coming out to the house of the Lord and uh uh you know it's kind of sad though because if people came for the ice cream then there'd be too many of them to go so it's only the people that come for the word that get ice cream people that come to for the ice cream don't get anything fair that's fair we try to be fair in all things now I'm sure there's going to be someone that's going to see if there's any Scripture uh for this but alls I can say is that they found bread and fish upon the fire you know so uh uh we don't have bread and fish so we're going to have ice cream and that's about as quick as a spiritual comparison I can make right on a short notice but uh I love Fellowship don't you I love the church I love one another so Lord richly bless you let's stand together and and uh musicians will come we'll sing a song and and if you would like uh ice cream if you come up I'll I I'll take you up there and I'll I'll I'll buy you a a a custard uh and uh if you see me trying to eat custard please uh remind me that I don't eat custard okay so I'll let you eat custard but you don't let me eat custard and that'll be good so I I just think the lord loves his children so let's just pray and and and in our hearts let's just thank them Heavenly Father we love one another and you said in your word that you would rather that we love one another than even love you and father we love you because you first loved us and Lord we love the work that you do and the mercy and Grace that you shed and my brothers and sisters around me are the attributes of your grace and mercy there are men and women from all walks of life from all backgrounds from all trials and situations that you called and you said that they were yours and that they were a part of you and a part part of your word and Lord if I'm a part of you and a part of your word and they're a part of you and a part of your word then I'm a part of them and that's what Jesus prayed that we would all be one and that we would love one another and that we would be in you together father I believe with all my heart that's the path forward and father as we go through your word and we go to the storehouse and we take the tapes that you have left us and we play them and we listen to them together father may it be for that great one purpose that we become one with your word and one with you father and one with our Lord and Savior and Lord may that be our goal and if one comes into our midst and they don't know you father May the love that they feel Reach Out And Touch their heart that they'd become thirsty and inquire what is the hope that you have what is the joy that is expressed in your heart why is there a smile on your face and we can tell them because we're going to a land beyond the river we're going to where the streets are gold we're going to a mansion on the hilltop we're going to get a new body to the land where we never grow old and God have purchased that for us at Calvary that we can be free from sin free from hatred free from malice and strife and envy that we can be full of joy and peace and patience and longsuffering and godliness and goodness and faith and virtue when we can be capped off with the great Capstone father though simple yet so true and so real and father I pray that that would be ever and those that couldn't make it back to the house of the Lord father make a special way that next weekend that we'd all come out and hear your servant brother Bill and that he could enter into our fellowship with us and he could praise God With Us and he could Minister the words of life to us and re rejoice in the things that we here that we receive correction and am amation father and and we be stirred up that's it we long anoint Him Father speak to his heart on our behalf and father once again may this week coming may we find victory in our midst father may we withstand the Satan at every move he makes father may he ref may we refuse to eat anything he tries to feed us outside the word of God give us this great courage father we pray we ask it in jesus' name we pray amen is that I have a father amen I don't know if you have those words have a father he [Music] oh
