Description:
Testimony Service
Br. David McGeary
Wednesday Service: April 7,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

grave resurrection or whether it be translation we are in your glory we're grateful for that father we ask you to bless us tonight in this wonderful testimony service tonight in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated tonight hallelujah everybody still love the lord amen well you you got an adversary that's trying to take you out of love amen but loves the greatest uh thing in the church so we're certainly uh we're certainly uh grateful for that we just want to we won't have testimony service tonight so we're gonna just say a few things and then we're gonna play a little portion of a tape and then i'll kind of explain to you why i played that portion of the tape and then uh we have our testimony from that point so if you have a testimony think about it you know i i could start testifying forever amen you know what i mean he's done he's done so much for me that god's going to have to create a whole nother bunch of oceans and a whole bunch another parchment sky and a whole bunch of more scribes to write it all you know i was thinking the other day i just want to give a testimony and sometimes you know testimonies i sav you know what i mean it just god just comes down they put some eyesight on your ice aven and and you just realize wow lord forgive me you are in control all the time you had me in the palm of your hand and you know and you know that we've been just going through this major struggle with the city to get our church built you know they keep coming up with this and coming up with that and coming up with this and they're trying to get us to do all the work and all the engineering and everything it cost us money you know what i mean and and of course and yet they can build two liquor stores in 30 days you know what i mean and we're trying to get a different kind of spirit you know so they got they got a spirit store down here you know back and we're trying to build another spirit store where you can get the spirit and they've been fighting this you know so it started a couple years ago and it just seemed like what is wrong and then you know i would get the thinking well maybe god don't want me to do it god don't want me to do it and then i'm just ready to fold it up and the lord comes down and gives brother uh adrian a stefan a prophecy a word of the lord just straight word of the lord that come down and he come to me and he gave me the word of the lord and i was there and it was perfect and and uh and you know i got it in on my desk and then i meant some more coming and then brother john samuel comes brother sam john samuel has dreams so you just can't get around it i know for a fact that he does because i have dream dreams and he's dream dreams you know and don't think that we don't dream dreams and see visions you know what i mean and don't think that the gift of discernment doesn't lie within the office it's here god's working but god's always hid in simplicity you know what i mean so he moves in mysterious ways so he comes with a dream and then almost everybody i talked to even in the friends in the world that i said what are you doing so i'm trying to build the church fight and say they said how big it's going to be i says well you know we've only got a couple maybe two 300 people and we're building it for 500 every single one of them says it's not big enough it's not big enough yeah even john tells me it's not big enough he's from ohio who can you believe from ohio you know what i mean so uh okay and yeah so sorry uh we've really had a nice time together and so uh you know and it doesn't look like it's going that way at all and then we know that uh c19 hit okay so we battle for a year c19 hits and we got 10 people in the building right and the cops are in the foyer making sure we don't have any more than 10. that does not look like an atmosphere to build a church in right and everybody's running around with masks and people are getting sick and it doesn't look like we have any future at all and so it just the other day i'm sitting back and we finally were able to go into our little thermometer there in the back and it's only we only have a thermometer because i haven't been able to find anything more spiritual and i really didn't want to build a pyramid that had anything to do with money pyramids supposed to do with character and spirituality so but we we hit the uh we hit the 400 000 mark and last month we had matching funds of fifteen thousand dollars so that means that people put fifteen thousand dollars into our building fund and the business person that's backing it he matched it with fifteen thousand dollars so it's well some people didn't have the money at that time so they wrote a pledge i'll give i'm gonna get this back i'm this is coming down the road i pledge that well the person said okay i'll extend it for the month of april so we still have 35 000 dollars up there that we can match but in the meantime we are able to come almost to uh right now with other funds that have been set aside and in the the ministers brothers in the church uh instead of giving them an offering when they preach we've been taking their money and the minister's money and putting it aside in a special fund for the building so with all what the ministers have donated by preaching and not receiving offerings and all that we've set aside with that money and our money were that about six hundred thousand dollars so that's that really helped so um okay so but what i realized was if we would have built that church before covet we would have had a gigantic bill nobody working and nobody to pay for it you know and uh um yeah and if the timing of the lord is just impeccable and so i i was really moved and then i really realized how much he was looking after us when it really didn't appear that he was and and and during that time we've had wonderful brothers join our fellowship and and they've uh you know they've come to the lord we've seen uh uh people that are coming to the lord people that were sinners people that were in sin we've had our young people be baptized and people being baptized so it is it's really exciting to see what god's doing so we are wanted tonight to have a testimony service but i wanted to play about 15 minutes out of a message called what heary and as we listen to this we'll read the scripture here in a moment it's what i'm what my desire is is i want our testimony to be and and testament you have testimonies whatever you feel led to testify about what god's done for you but i'd like also like to see that hear from what god spoke to you you know what i mean and so i think this will be a real blessing uh to us to listen to this and then when we're done i think uh brother matthews uh uh is gonna share a testimony that a sister um wants to have him share on her behalf i think that's what we're going to do and then i thought brother darian's testimony it was so wonderful tonight too because i was there in the hospital and i was there when it looked like he wasn't going to make it and god's miraculously provided him a liver and and it's just wonderful the things that gods can do so let's stand together tonight and and i know you'll enjoy this and and listen and take it to heart because the uh brother ben's really pointing to something and and when it really comes down to it in life what your greatest testimonies are the ones that god's personally spoken to you they never leave you you know what i mean you they're like they're like words of life to you and you can hold on first so let's turn in our bibles to the 19th chapter of the book of kings first kings the 19th chapter and you know the story here and the second verse sets the story and it so and uh you know ahab and the prophets and elijah had slain the prophets by the sword and so you know the story and then a jezebel sends a messenger to elijah's lies saying you know let the gods do unto me if you're not dead by this time tomorrow all right so he's been threatened and uh so we know that he goes out and he sleeps under a tree and he's a day's journey and finally he comes and and uh he he comes to this place that he is going to uh enter in to a cave so the ravens are feeding them and everything's feeding them and now he comes to this cave and this is where we pick up the scripture and this is where brother branham tells the story now we're going to go ahead in this sermon up to the 84th verse of a paragraph of this story but if you want to go back and read something that will really instruct you and bless you and become a part of the way that you look at things go back and listen to what does thou hear and he says and he came hither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what does thou hear elijah and he said i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant and thrown down thy altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and thou seek my life to take it away and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountain and break it in pieces and rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so he when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him saying what does thou hear elijah let's uh lord ask you to bless the word of the lord let's just pick up this little portion of the word and then after this this will be the root of our testimony service tonight god bless you let's listen to you may be seated as we listen to this wonderful portion of god's word hallelujah and we find then that he went 40 days and nights and god located him standing or pulled back in a cave and god wanted to attract his attention so there was a great storm passed by and it ripped the mountains it was so powerful to shook the rocks but god wasn't in the storm it went before god did and then there come again a great earthquake that shook the earth but still god wasn't in the earthquake and there come a fire but god wasn't in the fire and then there came a still small voice and god was in the voice and brother sister i've been back in the cave long enough and you have to to know that there's been a lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot of noise and fusses and stews and things like that and big meetings but where's been god out of it that's the reason i said what i did this morning there's got to come something deeper than a healing service that's got to come something deeper than a gift to speak with tongues there's got to be something deeper than a russian mighty wind the wind went forth but god wasn't in it we've had russian mighty winds all over the country and sensations and blood in the face and in the hands all kinds of signs but where's god at elisha waited yet he was a prophet but he listened to it he never went out to compare revivals with them he never went out to get the biggest tent in the country he never went out to go on television or so forth as we would call it all the great fuss and america's guilty of listening to those noises oh we love noise but god's not in the noise although as honorable in things as they are yet god isn't in noise that had been so when the africans beat the tom toms you never heard such a noise in rhythm god wasn't in it and we've had russian mighty winds we've had all kinds of fires and earthquakes and shakings and great revivals and things like that god wasn't in it if it had been it was showed itself up but after that come a still small voice then god was in the voice that's what i'm thinking today friends we people are so are so carried away with all the noise so america loves noise look at what they're doing they turn on these old radios just as hard as they can with rock and roll and ugly woodland all that kind of stuff they've got to have it so loud it'll blast your ear drums out nearly all the noise all the time of the day and in the church we beat the tambourines we've run up and down and screamed and hollered and hooped and had a great time like that nothing against it but where was god in it what did it do broke us up in little pieces called the assemblies of god the church of god the pentecostal united oneness and all these other different little denominations god wasn't in it it's a forerunner of god it's a framework when you see so-called christianity today people goes to churches and lives these dignified lives and goes out and denies healing and denies the power of god and denies a consecrated life calling you fanatics remember that's framework that's brother woods i believe you call a scaffold work it's a bogus it's a frame that goes on the outside god only stands on it to build the building glory god hallelujah it's only a bogus frame that'll be tore down amen we've tapped hands and said glory to god when you shout you got it the method has said that the nazarene they found out they didn't have it the pentecostal said clap your hands and shout till you speak in tongues you got it but we found out we didn't have it there's one more thing left than god take it to a cave then i can find it let's get that still small voice that's something that puts a cream in the life that's something that though you speak with tongues of man and angels and have not that you're nothing though you can prophesy and speak with tongues that show signs and wonders and work miracles and do great signs but at that little still small voice is in there you're nothing says the scripture that's what we're listening for now we've had the thunders we've had the fire we've had the russian winds and the earthquakes but god sent us a still small voice that's what we need listen brother we need that still small voice a still small voice that spoke jesus said you couldn't hear his voice in the street he didn't hear him crying he was our pattern look at him he was compared his spirit like a dove gentle it's great things are quite things did you know that friends listen the sun which gives life on the earth to every living thing and botany life plant life tree life whatever more it brings forth life the sun does and it can draw a million gallons of water from the earth and make less noise and we can get a bucket full out of a pump it's big things quite things are big things did you ever hear the world turning did you ever hear the planets as they passed through the orbits do you ever hear one that's the big things did you ever hear the sun rise oh we think we have to have a lot of noise have to have a brass band to beat a lot of jumping up and down and we ain't got a good meeting we think everybody has to be on top of the clapping their hands and things we think the music has to be going in a rhythm and everybody running down the aisle we've had that what good's it done where's that where's it got us today in a bunch of confusion a bunch of denominations broke up brotherhood ruined certainly it has it's been the old cankerworm and palm worm and and all kinds of bugs from back there in the beginning of jobs or joel saw them what the palm worm has left the canker worm eating what the cankerworm meat the grasshopper eaten and so forth that we've eaten down to a stone but the scripture says i will restore saith the lord we're waiting for something of all the shout we've had enough blast and noise to to convert the whole world we've had enough hurrah and hollering and carrying on until what's it done it hasn't built the church it's built denominations this made man go out with puffed up ideas and stuffed shirts i don't like that stuff walk out on the platform say oh look at him he's a prince look how he's dressed just polished and everything he knows how to make his vows and so forth that ain't what god chooses a prophet thought that one day he's going to anoint a servant he said he's the biggest of the family he'll look right but god refused him you don't have to have princes and and so forth to stand up there like i don't know what it ain't the clothes you wear or the eloquence you speak with it's the something that's inside of you that voice of god that's what it is the prophet passed by another and said that's not him god's refused him pastor and said haven't you gotten so we got a little ruddy one back here on the hillside hurting the sheep it's david the one that brought this little redheaded freckled face guy across there and his little stooped in shoulders and sheepskin after i didn't god said that's him all your big statues and stuff shirts didn't go with god you might be dddd phd or double ld you might be bishop poper or whatever you might be but it takes god to make something out of nothing as long as you can be the nothing gods of something as long as you get yourself out of the way then god can come in but when you're so stuffed up and starchy you got the biggest and the best you haven't got nothing that you ought to have that's a humble heart before god we know that brethren hallelujah certainly sure you never really see you'll hear the sun rise you never didn't hear that did you ever go out at night to hear the dew fall what will we do without it see it don't take that i'll tell you one thing now it's the still it is the riffling waters that makes such a big noise and jumps up and down that reflects the beauty of the stars in it it's still a small pool that's deep and still that reflects the beauty of the stars what we need tonight is that deep rich experience that's something down in us that it don't have to shout yet it might but we put all emphasis on our shouting it might never speak with tongues yet it might but we put all emphasis on that it might not attended billy graham's meeting or robert's meeting your mind meeting you don't have to what it has to have is that depths of god's eternal love amen that spirit on the inside of him that makes you what you are that's what i was speaking about this morning that's what i was pulling the church across calvary back and forth don't you think because that you spoke with tongues are that you know so much about the scriptures or you read somebody's books and you know more than the other fella he said put a mark on those that sign cry for the abominations that did in the city who would he mark in our cities tonight see it's the depths of the spirit not the shallowness it's not the shell on the on the hickory nut that's good it's the heck or not under the shell got to begin to shell you got nothing under there what we need tonight is the depths of god's love and when elijah heard that still small voice nothing bothered him what have you heard in all of it you'll be going in a few days you hurt billy graham you're here or robert you'll hear others great man nothing against those men they're god's servants but don't listen to the noise hear that still small voice that depth of something that comes into the human heart that takes all foolishness away from you it takes all the world away from you it makes you hate the things of the world and love the things of god that's the depths that's the pool that reflects the stars of god's eternal glory that's the thing it brings forth tears to the eyes brings joy unspeakable and full of glory it makes you stand when all other things will fail you it makes it when the sickness comes or even death itself it's still got the reflection of god's blessings in it that little pool that's deep and reflects the heavens not the ripple and noise of the water riffling waters are not very deep it's still waters it runs deep may god help us tonight friends as we're coming to the communion table to remember that no matter what outward we do how many good things we do you say where brother adam i go to church i try to live the best that i can good there's nothing against that brother i have spoke with tongues brother random i have shouted in the spirit that's good but that's not what i'm talking about brother that still isn't in that isn't what i'm speaking of i'm talking of that still small voice that's something rich and royal that i used to see the old mammoths when they come down this aisle here years ago the tears streaming from their cheeks when one sinner boy would raise up to come to the altar the day i make a call and see a boy come they said and pop their chewing gum what's the matter you lost the here then what have you heard what here us thou we're at the end time you hear on the television and on the radio in your magazines in your papers that there's going to be a whirl across this country someday what are you listening for to hear that all alarm your radio on all day long with all that nonsense of carrying on to hear when the bullets are going to drop for the bombs i'm not listening to that stuff i'm listening year boys say come up higher it was well done my good and faithful servant what you're a sound you know i think that we're so interested in listening so close to all the things of the world and things like that we can't hear that little still small voice well you're our pastor say just join the church it'll be all right we hear some of them say just speak with tongues it's all over some of them say just shout this all over you can't hear that little still small voice that places something rich and deep in the light makes you what you should be a wheat doesn't bear wheat because it's on a vine or on a stalk of weed also it's on a stalk but it takes the life in that vine to bring forth wheat the waters that fall under the water both of them they'll both rejoice in it they'll both grow in men and women can grow up shouting and praising god speaking in tongues and belonging to the church dancing in the spirit and paying times still not be in their heart that still small voice of god's rich deep love though i give my body to be burned as a sacrifice and have not love i'm nothing though i give all my goods to feed the poor i'm still nothing i have faith to move mountains i'm still nothing huh i i do speak with tongues as men and angels i'm still nothing see it's that still small voice that speaks down in your heart that changes every attitude makes a nature different and you become a new creature in christ what hear us thou depends on what you're listening for for him if you're listening you're not no remarks no reflection but if you're listening you're a of a great revival somewhere where ten thousand people are gathered go ahead you're listening to the wrong thing i'll go over and see they say they have great crowds that don't make a bit of difference the racetracks have that everything else has that rock and rollers have that i'm going over to i'm going over for something else if you go for anything else but if you're listening for anything else but that still small voice get back in the cave go back out of the juniper tree until we can prepare hold yourself quiet in wait let the thunders go by let the earthquake shake let the russian winds go in the fire sweep whatever it will now think of that song teach me lord how to wait when hearts are aflame let me humble my pride call on your name keep my faith renewed my eyes on thee let me be on this earth what you want me to be that's what i want to do they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an ego you believe that they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint teach me lord teach me lord how to wait let the thunders go by let the fire sweep by but let me hear that still small voice says come under me all yet labor and a heavy laden come out and earn the junior for treating come out of here cage i want to bail my faith facing his blood walk forth and say yes lord i now believe [Applause] amen so you say you want to have a testimony meeting well i want to have a testimony meeting from the still small voice you know what in the midst of all the shout in the midst of all the wind in the midst of everything what did god speak to your heart you know did you hear from him what did he say what did he show you what did he what has he done where is he you know did you ever hear the sunrise can you feel this present can you feel that a little anointing start moving over the building right now are you sensitive enough to it that it speaks to the deep that calls to the deep something that produces the cream of life the real thing that this message brought resurrection and life that's what that's where our testimonies ought to come from you know i'm glad he still speaks i'm glad he's still changing i'm glad that he still can let me look in the mirror and i don't like what i see but i know there's grace there to do that so anyway i was going to ask brother matthew to come and and i wanted to share with you about our prayer meeting we had just a a wonderful prayer meeting last night i mean people just praying before god and worshiping the lord and calling upon the lord and and singing and and praying through and getting the victory and having the transforming power uh just come down on the inside and and and change the the heart and uh and that's what i wonder and i think this sunday we have some baptisms that are going to take place uh i think a little uh joshua i think it is is getting baptized i forget names real easy you know that but we had a sister that had a a wonderful testimony and she wrote it down and and brought it to the back and and i i could never read it and it expressed it the way but i was gonna see if matthew would come and read that testimony tell you a little bit about the prayer meetings every tuesday after communion and maybe you set aside and then right after that we'll be prepared to hear the testimonies any testimony you have on the heart of what god's done for your heart this weekend or this week or wherever it's been oh god bless you brother matthew amen amen praise the lord sure enjoyed that portion uh that we listened to amen i uh that still small voice is always means a lot to me just maybe 22 years ago i remember doing uh feet washing and communion with brother tim seiler and as he was just washing my feet there just a young christian i remember him praying lord may he be sensitive to that still small voice and that's never left me that means a lot and and much we could say but god is in each one of you and something that might seem so simple or something that you would think might go unnoticed i'm testifying that something a brother said over 20 years ago has meant a lot to me in my christian walk and so we that's what we're looking for you know brother branham as as he would be maybe out in nature going down down the road he'd feel a win maybe pass by him or something and he was wanting to be sensitive lord is that you and i i think that's just as our pastor has uh so beautifully been led to this portion of the the message and what the prophet has shown i thought that was just just the mind of the lord because we can get excited we can shout we can we can run the aisles the gifts can be in operation but we want god to do something personally to each one of us and i tell you when he does something personal to you and you hear the still small voice well then if you get excited and you start shouting and you start singing the victory and you might start running like you said you might you might you might not but it doesn't matter then as you heard you heard brother branham say he said once elijah heard this still small voice then nothing bothered him and that's why sometimes you know there's some impersonators there's some people that mimic but that's why some people just nothing bothers them they're just expressing the fire that's dropped in their heart by the word of the lord so uh yet something that um this testimony that was turned in is just as is wonderful and i maybe just want to read a portion of scripture out of james this is something that we put up on the on the screen here uh during the prayer service and uh we'll just read that and then we we couple that with a quote it's that it's a scripture we're very familiar with out of james chapter five they can put that up i believe it's going to be verse 15 and 16. it says and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and then we just couple that with this quote if you could move the slide there brother brahma says oh eternal god hear the prayer of your servants and no and now it's written again if the people that's called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then i'll hear from heaven oh god hear the prayer of your children tonight from heaven and i just could testify last night we seen the very manifestation of that quote there and we've been meeting um just a little bit over three years now doing prayer services we we were doing it every tuesday for certain needs and then as time progressed it was it seemed that doing it once a month could be very beneficial because instead of maybe having uh the many that would come to support it scattered out over three or four times throughout the month if if we all came together uh once a month after communion it just seemed to be very fitting in the mind of god and uh something that was on my heart as we we kept moving forward um it just the burden of my heart was is wanting to see uh the spirit of prayer really just wanting to see the people enter in in into an intercession and really uh crying out to god and and calling his presence down and really fulfilling that quote uh that we just read that the people assembling themselves together and calling unto god and knowing that he's hearing from heaven and just even out with the portion of tape we just listened to of of how you're marked about your sign and crying i i'm reminded of when brother branham said how many in here have the holy ghost all right raise your hand everybody all right do you sigh and cry for the abomination in the world that'll tell you if you got it yeah i'm like oh god help me i'm not doing that and so uh we this that's an opportunity to come together and as the spirit of god would move upon you you find yourself crying out for things you might not even know really but it's the spirit of god uttering through you things you didn't even know to utter and i just want to read this here just um from our sister she says dear saints of god i want to give this testimony to encourage someone and for the glory of god who does what no man can do he is god and forever remains god he is living in his servants those that are really sincere and serving him in truth and in spirit it is good to be in the services of god whenever it's called for what happened in the prayer meeting yesterday was really supernatural the hand of god i came to the meeting with burdens on my heart and for answers that can only come from god i came to church to just sit down and something said go straight to the altar so i went straight to the altar praying and pouring my heart out to god then when the praying was going on with everywhere on fire i felt a hand on me and the hand is just not man's hand but a supernatural touching hand then there came on me a sweetness a move all over me and the burdens were all gone then i found myself praising god and saying thank you lord thank you lord my burdens were lifted off me she says it's then i saw a brother's hand on me praying for me and touching all those problems i was surprised because as i as that brother laid hands on me the sweetness came all over me how did he know what i was praying about i am testifying to you because i have started seeing the answers to these prayers i prayed yesterday god is moving in our midst if we can only come to him with expectation in our hearts and acknowledge his presence in our services and to honor him when we're called to these prayer services she says the greater testimonies are coming sister rosemary i thought my what what a word from the lord i thought that was so beautifully uh uh uh exhorted to us that testimony of what god is doing and as as i would uh turn this back over to our pastor i would say i can testify of what god has done for me over the weekend god i spoke directly to my heart i did something extremely uh supernatural for me and and confirming things and we just give god all the glory i say i am in such great expectation for what god is doing i i said i said to brother jackson remember remember these letters uh uh i told him and i said wb i say remember these letters cause i'm gonna i'm gonna let you know what it means but it stands for wet blanket and i say this fire is so on fire ain't no wet blanket gonna put this fire out god has started something in me and it's been by that word of the lord that has spoken to my heart that no man can take away no devil can take away it's something that god has done for me and ain't no devil gonna put this fire right ain't no criticism gonna put this fire right no nobody criticizing me for i'm on fire like like a house on fire on a windy day ain't nobody gonna hold this bride down we're going up hey man god bless you amen don't you love it when god speaks to your heart nothing like it in the world having god speak to your heart it'll set you on fire you can walk in front of the king and point your finger in his face and say you can't have her it's against the word of the lord amen anybody else who's a god i i had a a a name here it said a testimony i didn't know if that meant that that brother had a testimony man okay brother christian i have your name here uh are you here not here he's not here okay it just said testimony so i guess the brother it wasn't made well it doesn't matter if somebody else has got a is is this him here he is hallelujah praise god any good praise the lord amen thank you amen god bless you all thank you i was happy to be here tonight and uh to have the opportunity to uh to testify to the glory of god uh two months ago the end of february i had a trip back home in my home country cameroon i was visiting my family because my sibling just lost a one-week year old baby so uh i had a quick trip back there uh i was there only for one week so uh when i was coming back the day i was coming back the morning i started feeling sick and it wasn't that bad yet so uh around noon i started reacting and my stomach was running i started throwing up i went to the pharmacy i got some medicine to try to calm me down but it wasn't still working so uh during that time brother moses called me to check on me i told him that i'm not feeling that well i'm thinking of of postponing my flight he said okay let me do what is right but he he will be praying at the same time his sister in florida called me also and they all they all started praying for me his dad was a pastor in another town also he was supposed to meet me before my trip i told him that i might consulate because i'm not feeling well he said okay let me know but we will stop praying for you so um a voice started talking i said cancel it so i was like okay let me wait let me go out and have a walk so when i come back let me see how i feel so i went out when i came back i was like oh okay i feel good i might not even have to cancel my flight so when i went i sat on the bed i said a voice said cancel it i said at this time i'm not going to debate i'll cancel it so then i called the airlines i i wanted a consulate usually they will charge you the change fee but somehow they say they're not going to charge me anything i say okay that even works better so i changed the date around the time that i was supposed to be flying the temperature came out started again it went up my stomach started running again i started throwing up i tried to take the medicine even water as soon as i take water i could throw up and see all the medicine i just took everything is back up so uh i called brother moses died and told him that it's no it's not going well so you guys can keep praying for me so it's nighttime i'm in the room with my little sister my little brother i suddenly could not move and they would even stand calling me to give me water to give me something i could barely move my hand i could barely even turn my head they were standing for for a couple of minutes calling me i couldn't respond but i could hear them my eyes were closed captioning not when available finished praying my little sister took over i could hear them praying then it was my turn i was praying while laying down like i was cold even though i wasn't covering myself my eyes were closed i started praying in french but when i finished i couldn't still do anything then i started singing little by little when i was singing my voice was coming up and up and up now i was able to sit now in the bed then i started praying for the second time in english i prayed i prayed i prayed that i started feeling a little relieved then i started singing again my little sister speaks english was picking up some of the songs we started singing then i said i'm not done yet i have to kneel down and pray again so i kneeled down i prayed again in english for the third time then i had the strength even to kneel on because i didn't have that strength before so i prayed i prayed i prayed when i woke up now i stood up i sat back on the bed i said for one to two minutes i kept saying i am healed i am healed i am healed i am healed for at least one minute i remember so now i laid down they wanted to give me water i said no that's okay i feel better do you want to drink medicine i said no that's fine so um my little sister wanted my younger brother to stay in the bedroom with me to watch over me i said no you guys can go i'll be all right so i kept singing all night so uh this is the testimony in another testimony so during that time before i got really sick i had a friend my co-worker who called me that the staffing agency is letting us know that on monday when i come back i don't have a job no more so i'm struggling to to heal and then i get a text called in the text i didn't answer the call but i got a text i saw it i said i would deal with that later so during that time my they left me in the room i woke up when i woke up now i took my phone i saw two voice messages from a job that i uh applied and i interviewed two weeks before telling me that they want me to be their employee so that that has been solved so two issues solved in in a matter of four hours amen thank you so when i woke up i called i remember i think brother moses brought sister in florida she called me or i called her so when i i picked up the phone i started singing that i am a winner i am a winner so she was happy she's like you heal you're healed so you're good i said yes i'm not only healed but i got my job replaced amen so during that time and i spent the whole day after two days that i postponed my flight i was just singing rejoicing and be glad that by faith everything is possible and when i came back here on monday the the recruiter called me telling me that today is your last day at 8 am then at 6 00 pm the new job send me an email that we are sending you your offer letter let us know if you like it that's god's work amen so that's my testimony tonight and i'm just grateful for for god's faith and god's glory thank you all god bless you amen amen who else can testify for what god's done for him bro jeff you've raised your hand yeah okay your name is jeff all right let's have a testimony several months ago there was a something that the prophet said had been on my heart about getting down to that deep kernel of sincerity you know and it just really struck my heart and and it caused me to you know kind of uh go into some bird pains for a while and uh but i began to to pray and uh you know and ask for a greater sincerity in my prayer and i realized that there's a lot of layers to the heart and i lived a long time in the in the world you get a lot of a lot of insincerity that you don't even know you have you know and even after you know serving the lord for a while you you know you start finding little hidden things of dishonesty and so forth anyway so i you know i'm i'm spending a lot of a lot of time uh praying and uh and really uh you know groaning before the lord and he's showing me things and uh and any anyhow so i noticed that i was i gained a sensitivity that i never had before and i started to notice that in my daily walk little things that i would see even people doing things it was like there was a still small voice that you see that right there that's like this you see how this bird's doing that or whatever that's like this and a lot of times would be questions on my heart or maybe uh you know a burden for somebody else and you know the lord showing me things and uh and and i really enjoyed that because i saw that in the prophet you know when i've seen the same thing in my life well anyhow this uh so i'm gonna just use that kind of look for a foundation so i uh the covet thing came out and uh and uh there's a uh i can't wear a mask you know anything over my face to uh to stop uh to inhibit my breathing and uh and i don't want to say what it is but basically when the announcement came forth of covid they said if you have this you know and you catch covet it's basically a death sentence so that caught my attention and and so one morning i was uh i went to a job site and uh and i always go to work like an hour hour and a half early and uh and so i'm sitting there in the in the dark you know and uh and and i started to pray about that you know um because that that's kind of serious you know and uh and uh and something told me i had a little uh a gideon's pocket bible in my car and something said pick up your bible and so i picked up my bible and i opened it up i believe it was psalms 51. anyway i opened it up and right where i started reading it was just like the lord was was quickening this this verse to me and uh but what i was hearing in my heart was you know that that i'm going to protect you from this virus [Music] and this revelation was so profound that uh from that point until now um you know i'm not saying that people haven't gone sir sir you know and i've handled it in a very polite way because the cdc has calls me exempt so did the state mandate you know and so i would always tell them i'll remain six feet but i can't wear a face cover but i have gone i have not i didn't slow down at all i went to all all the stores just like i normally would and uh and if i felt led to go into a ward where the people were all sick with covet i could go in there and lay hands on every person in there without one speck of fear just a profound a word from the lord that was just a divine revelation and his sovereignty that he gave me and then a short while after that you know uh you know the mask first it was they were shortening uh listening how many people could be gathered well in my trade the job sites that i work on are usually 300 500 800 workers so needless to say most of the projects that i would normally be working on which is my particular skill set and construction they were all shut down postponed you know so they're having to tell the investors you know hey you know that completion date you know and so meanwhile i'm out of work and uh and then even when they when they you know begin to uh you know expand okay 100 people can gather so on and so forth um the fact that i can't wear a mask i'm not allowed on the job sites and started working labor and uh and then it happened there too couldn't uh couldn't go on the job sites without a mask so i i had applied for a job they called me they sent me to a place i went out there they said i think you don't have to wear a mask here and i was like okay great i get out there same thing i'm there like an hour and a half early it's dark and uh and then i find out they're not going to let me in this job site either without a mask i i talked to i went all the way up the chain of command talked to their project safety manager he said no and uh you know and the thought came to mind i could sue them you know but that's not really the christian thing to do and it's just a bleeding thought and i was like yeah that's not uh no and you know so i went back to my car and it was almost the same type of way i just began to pray right there in my car felt again to pick up my my little king james bottle this is months later and i picked it up and right where i picked it up was where caesar was before i believe it was festus and uh and uh and he was brought up on charges and and he said you know i appeal to caesar and when i read that appeal to caesar it was just like the lord spoke to my heart and said appeal to caesar and so i'm like okay okay you know and so i i went home and on the way home i was like okay appeal to caesar and i go well it's too small of an issue for president trump you know so i just went down and i thought but you know what there there's uh there's state legislative people there there's you know u.s senators and so forth and so i said well lord you know however you leave me you know i believe this is from you i believe i heard your word to me i know it's you and uh and so i got back home i went on my computer and i went to uh you know this particular congress person's website and didn't feel anything so i went to another website you know they have those official government websites and then i went to this one u.s senator and i just felt a peace you know and so uh you know i'm kind of wordy and so the lord helped me make it just a short paragraph that really described everything and i was like that's amazing that and i sent it off and i also brought up that i had been denied unemployment and i wasn't trying to file against the labor place i just was looking for the disaster really because i can't wear a mask well uh a short while after that you know went through a little trial with it you know they called me and they're like you know and i got a hold of a person i knew it was a trial i recognized it i was trying to you know it's a character test and uh did pretty well and uh and uh and then uh it got another call and this person was very nice and they're like hey you know i think i can get you this and this and i was like well i'm not really trying to get this and that he goes no i i can get you this and that and i'm like okay you know and a day and he said now it may take a couple of weeks for this to go through a day and a half later a huge lump sum i was so in debt i mean my credit cards were maxed out i owed everybody that i knew i had all my tools almost to knock in a day and a half later a huge lump sum hit my bank account and the lord has provided for my needs ever [Applause] since hallelujah anybody else have the lord bless in their heart sister go ahead hallelujah praise the lord god bless you i'm kind of shaking right now but i just want to testify what the lord has done for me the past two weeks i remember there was a day it was a sunday but the david was preaching on the cry to overcome and i was struggling with this spirit and that spirit was a spirit of lust not after that before that i had friends that had gone to oklahoma youth camp and we were on a group call and we were just talking they were just saying god delivered me from this god delivered me with this and then two other girls like god didn't god delivered me from last pornography and i was like god i see what you're doing for others then what about me and then i came to sunday and the brother david preached a song on the instrument on the cry to overcome i was like god i want to overcome i don't want the spirit on me i don't worship the devil i don't want the spirit on me and so i had been avoiding the altar like i was like you know something's telling me you should go to the hotel and get this paid out of you and i said and i kept on putting up was like i'm going to go next time next service next service and you know week after week you went by and there was a day i was listening to a sermon the accumulation of faith and that summary just encouraged me and i just felt like to write the thing i was like i was going to louisia i'm going to louisiana youth meetings i'm going to write down a list of what i got what i want god to deliver me from and i wrote it down i put in the back of my phone case and when i got home i put in my bible and then when we got to the hotel on friday i looked at that list i was like god today is the first day of the youth meetings i want you to do something for me this weekend and went to service and i began losing my voice and i was like god if you give me my voice back i'm going to testify and then i got my voice back and then that night by the day and his demon preached a sermon and after the sermon they had an auto call and you know i just felt so just i didn't feel discouraged but i just didn't want to go to the altar but there's something came in me said you've been avoiding the author for too long i think it's time and i went there i got prayed and that spirit just went out right out of me and then and then this song came up came in my mind it says you're my courage when i worry in the dead of night you're my strength because i'm not strong enough to win this fight you're greater than the battle that's raging in my mind i will trust you lord i'll fear no more and i also had a desire way before that that's been two years for two years i've been praying about that god i'd love to see my little brother saved and when we got home you know i have forgotten about it i have forgotten that i prayed for this and you know i went to my room getting ready to go to sleep i was like i need water and i went to grab water and i saw my little brother sitting there leaving music linda i need to talk to you and ask him what's up he's like i had a great weekend god really moved on my heart i was like i want to get baptized i thought mommy i didn't know whether to shout or cry i was like i just went praising the lord as a god i've been praying two years for this and i have a quote a song that i found and i feel like that song just summed up my week my weekend at the louisiana youth meetings says i found my freedom in you i found a joy i can't lose and thank god it's true you wrapped your arms around me and heaven broke through from the moment you found me lord i found my freedom in you i found my new name i found my good grace found that healing and the tears fell down from my face when i found my beginning that has no ending i found my second chance i found my best friend i found my forgiveness i found my happiness i've been singing ever since i found my freedom in you hallelujah amen that sister's become dangerous you better watch out satan amen we've got someone's got dangerous that's who's dangerous is the people that hear from the lord in their heart amen because now they know where it come from and if you ever have that nothing can take it away amen any more dangerous people in here brother go ahead praise the lord god bless you signs yeah i'm glad i'm not as much nervous as last time yeah i just want to share a quick testimony here i have a thousands of them i could actually go and share from the moment god has brought me here but one that really resided with me as brother david was speaking earlier you know that the spirit of the lord still moves and still operates on people you know it's a testimony coming down here to texas actually for me and my family you know uh this goes back from really like before my childhood i was never the kid that settled for proficiency or just he has a a in a class i always wanted to do a little bit extra either to be the teacher's pet or to just piss somebody off or you know it was like a competition for me and it got to a time where as i was going to school you know i graduated from high school with all these honors scholarships and everything and then you know i started going to college you know at first it was yeah i wanted to do cyber security and you know and then i got pulled into you know there was this desire upon my heart where it was just like david you've been called for more than this and you know there was this call deep inside of me just you know davey you have been called for more than this and it was this hot cry and then i was like maybe cyber security is not the way i should go and then i was thinking you know there was this life from the devil about you go for theology so you know how to bring the word of god to people and i was just like listening to brother branham and and i could hear our brother obama was just blasting against that spirit of you know learning god from a man and i said maybe not theology i i found a shortcut and then i went for psychology from the moment i said i want to do psychology the spirit was just like david you know myself i could really tell myself it's just like david aren't you ashamed of yourself you know and i went so deep into psychology where you know i could deal maybe my siblings can share a little bit of it i could deal with somebody two minutes before you even spoke a word to me it was like i could just look into a person and you know there was these things that we were learning and you know i kind of really got too much into you know it was psychology everything became about psychology and then it wasn't until core and i started coming you know that i took one class and then i was in that class and as i when i took that class the lord started just speaking dealing to my heart it's just like you know how far do you want to go you know how far do you want me to reach down and i've never really settled for failing in the class and then i went on i was in the b a minus range in the class the end of the semester came i failed i was just like this is strange i took it again the next semester following semester in the summer and it was so blurry like things i did study last semester and i almost passed because of one quiz and misunderstanding that i failed and i found myself really completely in the f i was just like i have to withdraw so i withdrew from the clash again and then i came again to take it and then i started praying to god i said god if you really don't want me to do this give me a sign and then i was sitting there as i was praying i was speaking myself and then like something started telling me did you really hear yourself how many more signs do you need to pull away from it you know you know now it sounds really you know to me it sounds maybe funny but i know the standard my dad has for me understanding my parents said before me i just was sitting there i was just like god it can be you i've given three years of my life in college i've lost the scholarship with that first failure and then you know now i had to pay back money because i failed a class with the scholarship i had i was just crying i was so lost you know it was last last year toward the end and then you know we started listening to this message and you know it was about trusting god and all of a sudden my dad walks up one day and be like we're packing all of your stuff we're moving out of states i was just like dad you know i was just in a place where like nothing was making sense but then you know the lord started dealing with me to completely pull out of that psychology and i it was hard and i was just like you know what lord i give up you know because when you look into life at least for me when i look into life i i'm looking at my friends as well those we started college with you know you see them graduate and every time you have a friend that says oh come to my graduation ceremony your heart goes like that could have been me you know it kind of was like picking like dealing with my ego a lot you know to see you work from something you build you build you build and then at the end it came to nothing and then i was really hurt and my parent was just like yeah we need uh we need to be moving we're moving out of colorado you know the house is on sale everything is up you guys need to stop preparing for it and i was praying to god i was just like that is taking me somewhere i don't know anybody but few friends that i had here already in the church and i don't know where to start life and that i'm getting old you know by the way i'm saying you know by the way i'm 22 years old you know and i was just looking at stuff i was just like you know i was looking at life i'm like it's this is not going to work so i i started fussing about it i was just like dad what are you trying to do like are you running away from something little did i know it was really for my benefit you know and i came here i remember the first prayer night i had i spoke with brother matthew brennan matthew looked at me asked me what did you do that that question every time i heard it it was just like somebody telling you a failure you know he asked me what do you what are you doing you know i just like to be honest with you i'm lost you know i told him i was just like i don't know what i'm doing i don't know what i want to do like i was just like i'm in this place of confusion and you know as i was sitting and thinking about stuff one day brother david gave just enough it was just like you know if you guys are if you guys need any help you feel the lord has been dealing with in a certain way just come talk to me and stuff i went to see him that day and he was at home with with his wife and then i walked in his wife offered me tea and as i was drinking tea i just you know before going to him i was just like lord i'm lost like at this moment if you really don't do anything i might as well become a bum because i don't want to do something else and then you tell me to stop doing it you know i was just like i don't wanna there is so many ideas but if i put my head into it you pull me out i don't know and then i went to see brother davidesro speaking and i was talking with him more on the side of the call that god put in my heart in my life and you know it was when i just reached like they picked the highest level of sincerity with him and i just started telling him everything that was going on with my heart that the atmosphere in the room changed and maybe he didn't notice but i know he didn't notice that day you know he went on to telling me things about my past things that i've never shared with nobody and he just started speaking he started speaking and he tells me that was the lord protecting you you know you will be this and then you know that i keep it for myself i just sat down in his table i was like a foolish person i just was crying i was just like this has to be god you know and after he told he told me after that day i don't even want to say he because it was god speaking and after these things had happened you know god has given such a sense into my life now i feel like i am even way ahead of those that i felt like left me behind you know and just you know things the lord has been opening for me you know the opportunities you know the businesses and the everything that i've been just working on lately you know it's amazing i can't i can't put like see down and start counting and say when i come to dallas you know this is a success i will have you know and brother matthew one thing he told me is success is not measured you know by the things of this world and i do really believe it's true because i've spoken with so many friends i was telling me david the moment you've been here this is the impact you've done into my life this is what you've done this is what you've done this is and there is so many even testimony i've seen friends that was not serious with the lord you know come out and you know just under the sweetness and say i need this help you know and i've seen the lord work in my life more in the last three months i've been here than i ever did in my whole life you know and uh i can't i'm just so excited you know to see what he can do more you know since that day on that table you know when sometime i'm really ungrateful god forgive me because i don't stand here very much i try to run from this place but my heart has always been excited since that day you know the things god does for me and the way he does things you know that's really uh that's one of the million testimony i have to share he knows our heart doesn't he i don't know if you guys are going through what i'm going through but there is a hunger in me for more of god than i have ever experienced and you know that you go back to the very simple things that brother branham said he said there's a deep calling to it deep but there can't be a deep calling to the deep unless there's a deep to respond to it and and the reason that we're there's this deep hunger for more of god like brother graham said i i i want to get to that deep like that place there's there's something more than this there's something there's something beyond this but the only reason that's in their calling is because there's something there to respond and what's there to respond has to respond you you understand if it he said like that boy ate the pedal from the because he needed sulfur but but there was sulfur there to respond and the reason we're feeling this great desire to move up into a higher place beyond and brother branham was not throwing any wet blanket in this tape he was he was pointing out to us there's that inner voice that's going to speak to every single one of their children his children so it becomes personal it's personally imparted from god to your heart and and i don't care what atmosphere it comes in you understand that's not the part that matters okay it doesn't matter about none of that what he said mattered was that god spoke to your heart and you know why that we feel a hunger in our heart because god wants to speak to your heart he wants you to know personally i've talked to him i've walked with him he spoke to me nobody can tell me he hasn't even when brother ben said when everything was going against him his wife was laying there died his baby's dying everything was there he said satan come up to you he said he couldn't tell me there was no god because i already heard him and i already seen him i knew there was god he tried to tell me he didn't love me he said that's when that deep deep on the inside cried out yet he slayed me though i'll serve him that's what we're talking about this morning those these are these testimonies sister that just set me on fire you know god's moving he's moving let's don't miss his move let's don't miss where the move is it's in the still small voice amen anybody else god's done something for him amen was it you barry that raised your hand brother gary god bless you try to keep it short but i just want to read a scripture from the book of romans chapter 8. just kind of been i've testified to several brothers recently just kind of what god's been doing in my life and but uh here in verse let's see verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body and so you know just i guess it's been about a year now about a year ago this time actually april 15th you know i guess it was even before then you know a lot of times we get to this we almost get to the end and can look back and then recognize what god has done in our lives but um so about i guess right around the time kova hit last march or so just a groaning in myself to come up higher and to be closer with him and you know and just the brotherhood in this church and the inspiration each one has been in my life is it's really hard to describe it's really hard to measure out in fact but um just knowing that he's always been there and then to turn around and see the manifestation of it so you know as covid kind of hits last march just groaning in myself to come up higher and you know i think brother matthew said something about praying and uttering things we don't even recognize but um seeing brothers that are you know just one thing that maybe brother jackson doesn't realize or never maybe i've never said it to him but you know he was the one that introduced me to this message and but um one thing that i feel like he instilled in me maybe more than anything else is availability just being available to be used being available to be worked on and to grow and so like i said last march when covet hit and groaning and wanting more of the lord and just not happy you know we know that natural types of spiritual and um not being happy in my work life and my job and just going through the monotony of working for 13 years for the same company in a warehouse and just wanting more and wanting something different so been in prayer about it and crying out and seeing god use brothers and and looking at their situation and where they're at with the lord and wanting those same things and so around april 15 i was let go at my job you know it was right after right in the middle of the pandemic and you know i come and i saw jackson and we talked in kosman's office at the time when he was working for cosmon and i was just i was relieved you know i couldn't explain how i felt other than i was relieved and um and yet excited and scared i had a family of five god had given me wonderful gifts of children and it was my greatest heart's desire to be a father and he gave me children and so here i am praying for something and a lot of times god will answer you in a way that's unexpected in a time that's really unexpected right in the middle pandemic i'll lose my job and so you know i just worked a lot with brother david over the summer and you know i really enjoyed myself because i was able to have fellowship with brothers and lunch with brothers and you know i was crying out to be a part of the morning studies at matthews and god made a way um and yet i was still groaning for more and more of him and um i guess it was about um of this year i guess brother aaron oglesby came over and preached and um talked about leading your children back to sodom and that was just such a turning point for me in my life you know i you know we get complacent we let things slip we let things enter in that we ought not to and whether you know whether it be simple things of keeping up with the news well that just fills your head full of junk i can testify to that but so as i've just purposed in my heart to let those things go what a piece came about in a and um and a daily a greater daily walk of reading my bible twice a day and being inspired by cause man and um brother joseph and even daniel hox and just seeing these brothers who god is doing the work in them and wanting the same thing in my life just knowing that he's the same yesterday today and forever if he'll do it for them he'll do it for for me and so um and it seems like you know aaron preached on a series a couple years ago about every time there's a work for god to do satan comes to war against it so every time there's a work in your life to do god you know satan wars against it so you know as i'm getting the victory of laying things down and and really entering in and having a greater walk with him then sam's like well i'll flip your body and so i just had been feeling a lot of discomfort on the left side in my stomach and even around my heart that just you know sometimes i think can be kind of a nervous person or you know i've listened to brother brown talk about those that are an overthinker or think things that they haven't crossed the bridge yet or um and so just filling those things in my body and not knowing you know and set up at a doctor's appointment and i called matthew had called me that day and we'd we'd prayed over the phone and um i get to the doctor and they wouldn't take our insurance so i just didn't go you know and so i would get back home and i even came up for a wednesday night service in prayer and matthew prayed for me again and you know as i walked away he talked about just taking in faith i think is some of the lines of what he said but you know like i said we know that the natural types of spiritual and so as i lost my job and now hadn't gotten a job in door-to-door knocking sales job and i was like is this where the lord wants me to be and i know that i had um tried for other warehouse positions and i just couldn't even get a um an interview with 13 years of experience so i'm like lord is this where you want me to be and i know that we i mean we have to have faith for a rapture to take a rapture so i was just stepping out on faith and wanting to live by faith he wants to you know he he wants us to be his everything everything you know and so as i'm knocking these doors it's almost like in a daily transition it's an uncomfortability there it's a learning how to get yourself out of the way and trust in the process and i could just look in my life in the natural and see it in the spiritual that he's wanting to do the same things to get ourselves completely out of the way that we could be used by him and so you know as these brothers have just testified and and god's been doing a work i just believe you know our lives are as a christian we're a continual testimony and so just believe that he's still working you know and i just wanted to testify that like brother david said god still moves he's still doing the work he he's in his bride he's in his people he's moving in the brothers the love you know as he even said um has even titled you know faith is contagious i mean we're are we not seeing the manifestation of that but i just wanted to testify of how god had you know naturally been doing spiritually things in me with losing my job and in the middle of a pandemic and even can testify that we were you know i lost my job in april and somehow someway god gave us a house in november knowing that i lost my job in april with a deadline of november coming that we can no longer stay in our apartment wanting to own or not well to own a home but to have a home period and to see it manifested you know we you know we joke a lot but i made a little group for the guys that were moving me moving my apartment and called it you know manifested promise movers because the promise had come to pass you know we needed a home and in the middle of not having a job a pandemic god had made a way so i just wanted to testify that manifested promise movers that's okay i like that anybody else wanted the lord now brother go ahead this year we had probably 40 young people that wanted to go to louisiana and we it was very unique in that half of them were divided kind of doing um grouping up in little categories and going out uh with the group and then we had some um some of the younger ones going to uh van loads brother chris and myself drove the vans and i would have to say that this year was unique in that about 75 of the people that went actually never been before so it was very unique in that way and so the expectation already was just like a raw expectation and a hunger for god to see god move for them and it became such a neat thing to see it unfold it set an expectation in my heart to see how god's going to move and change lives and and just to see a real personal connection made with god for each of these individuals and so as we started out on our journey it was so neat how the lord was dealing with them and it seemed like walls were being broken down and there was like a unity starting to to over take like the fellowship and it was just really wonderful to see that and um i i testified to some brothers we had a little thursday get together and something that popped out that brother branham had said um in the easter seal but you know sometimes brother branham he's just talking he's not necessarily preaching on the word but he just in conversation would say something and he said something that was so marvelous to me that uh he was doing a hunting trip and there was a young man that brother brandon had noticed something on his era bro and he said donald then he asked him the question he said now he didn't bro this brother donovan never mentioned for brother branham to pray for him or nothing right but he's just fellowshipping with brother branham doing a hunting trip and well brother branham just asked him the question about this growth on is he here and it's so it was so outstanding to me that brother brown's response he said he didn't even pray he just looked over and he said my brother brother branham looked at donovan in such a way in his heart he had a love and you know it was something because that sermon that brother brandon preached he said when when divine love is projected sovereign grace and i began to say oh my what a theme and in my heart i want to see this kind of love in my life and so as we're driving out there i see god's dealing with people and the supernatural is present and people are being changed and then i see a man who you know some of y'all may not have heard but uh brother ron spencer he's been through the fire he's been through cancer and this man standing here and and then even brother tim testifies of how that or brother ron he was in that dark and and there was a love of god in brother tim's heart that he went out there and he spent time with him and so so brother ron testified how that he knew he wasn't alone you know there's things that you and i we go through and each one of us can affect each other like eggs and the love that you have it made such an impact and to see i i saw them rejoicing so much so that like it reminds me of the scripture in galatians five it says now now the this this faith there's a faith that we're looking for that worketh by love and and i began to see a theme unfolding in the man of god as he was delivering his burden and then to see brother tim and brother ron hugging and this was not just a brotherly love there was something more someone showed that a he said while i'm preaching these tumors are going to be dissolved oh i thought what a love what what a faith that someone could proclaim the word and and so oh my because now i begin to see okay that's the word that that what i heard about brother donovan i rejoiced him and i i i see the love of god being manifested with brother tim and brother ron and then all of a sudden you know expectation is like gasoline you got gasoline all over everybody yeah i was in need of that spark that's right all of a sudden i see my sister julia she's walking down the aisle and she goes right to the front and all of a sudden something's happening in me i said that's my sister boom she got the victory and it was like oh man an explosion happened all right glory to god i just want to thank god because he's alive he's well he's resurrected we have so much to be thankful for and just the expectation of what god has doing just whatever is in your heart go for it [Applause] and then isn't that what love does it takes you from you instead of being used for you and it's used for somebody else that's way brother i think you started to come to come on go ahead god bless double c church um so two three weeks ago uh something happened that took me back to the testimony or the things that god has done for me uh and um i was marveled because it felt like a dream one more time you know but it wasn't a dream and i've been growing up i've been having this struggle and the struggle is i'm very impatient uh this is something i pray to god every single day that i was part of my christian journey i just believe you know once that torch comes in it would take care of that and um i just grow up if i want something done i just want it done and the inpatient just keeps growing it just keeps growing and it also happened you know even in my christian life um i would find that just as you know the quote or the salmon we were listening to you know listening to that still small voice it does really speaks because i do hear it but most of the time it's probably because i'm not paying attention to it or i'm pretty much just occupied with something else and so during the time you know the testimony almost looks like the same during the time that i was looking for a job you know um it was a big problem yeah i was like oh why this time what happened and um i can remember i had an interview that was coming up it was for a position a director position i was so happy oh they reached out to me i never reached out to them so in my mind i was like oh this is a done deal god answered my prayer and this and all of a sudden the morning of that interview um i woke up it was a home and before then i've been having that struggle i just want you to be patient and that's what the spirit keeps telling me you have to be patient but you are not patient you know i said okay i'm talking to myself i know i mean like i know i'm impatient it's just i just want to get it done um then that morning i woke up and i heard a knock on my door 6 am nobody comes visit me it was like who's knocking 6 a.m i hope when i was in my suits and everything i opened up the door and i couldn't see anybody so i looked down and you were part of the way i pronounced this i was asking my daughter how do you pronounce that it's a 30 right as a the little 30 another 30 dove the little third of that you know walks slowly thank you very much i i was going to murder that and so i saw that i wasn't living close to the stream it was weird i called my wife i freaked out i was like why why you why are you knocking on the door and and so i have i didn't say this but this is something that has always been with me and so the first thing i told my wife is i don't want to be slow like why are you knocking on my door this morning um well i sat for the interview it all went well it never came it never worked out i sat for a couple interviews after that it never walked out two weeks ago i was sitting down in my office and then i had a meeting with with my boss and in the conference room something happened to the conference uh the the the conference technology and i was setting it up and i just remembered it was just like you know they would say oh it just came back and i've been shown exactly what i was doing in that room who actually sat on that room the people that were sitting across from me and i just remember i just dropped my hand and my boss was like are you okay i was like i've seen this i've seen this and you know he was looking at me like okay you acting up again but but i actually know what i saw and so i was just like oh my god i came home i told my wife i told everybody i was like can you believe this like this is what happened i've seen that but i was never patient for it um but then when i finally became you know a little more patient i sat and waited for god to give me this job um everything just fell in place um i'm in a place where i would say i have the best time of my life i don't i don't get worried in fact my wife is my boss because she's the one that tells me to go to work and and so i i'm just in a place where i just felt like god was trying to tell me something you have to be patient listen to me and when i heard that sermon you know when i heard brother brown talking i just said oh i need more of him i just want to listen to that in every aspect of my life and i'm just using this opportunity also say pray for me i just need to get i want to listen to that small still voice i bless you all amen um a lot of you know me some of you may not i don't know but uh i grew up around the message i say not necessarily in it excuse me if i get emotional god's done a lot for me lately but anyway i don't want to beat up on a piano let me slide this over here god forgive me anyhow um i went to church for years when i was a pew warmer is what i was um i wasn't serious then i caught myself you know coming to church for the wrong reason to impress people that's no reason to come to church so i told my wife i said you know what i'm not going to go anymore i'm not going to go until i can go for god and my wife got sick and i said well here's a perfect opportunity to quit going to church i could stay home take care of her you know do the things around the house need to take care of so i did and i guess i was gone for about a year and uh i was growing colder and darker in my heart so much that we went to land passes and uh was down there and um long story short i had a stroke 44 years old i ain't supposed to have no stroke but uh i had a stroke on my right side of my my body i mean so much i was picking up a dog a bag food i mean a bag of dog food and it just went right through and i couldn't couldn't grab it nothing with his hand and it was just weird very weird never experienced anything like this so when my wife took him to the hospital there in land passes and it got so bad i mean and i was so frustrated trying to talk to the nurse because i couldn't get no words out so they put me in an ambulance and sent me down to uh austin while i was there they run a bunch of tests on me come to find out i got a hole in my heart that i was born with well uh when the doctor came and told me this i'll tell you what that hole's all about i said that's where jesus christ belongs but he hadn't been there for a while so and uh i said when he comes back in it'll be fine but uh anyhow so come to find out i got a hole in my heart got been having many strokes or whatever um got a blown acl man i'm just falling apart you know but uh still wasn't going to say well you know what i'm still not going to use that as to go to church because i want to go for god i'm not going to go for his mercy i want to go to please him so anyway long story short my daughter i was talking to her one day she called me on the phone and she was telling me she was having some rough times and i told her i said casey i said when was the last time you prayed when was the last time you read your bible when was the last time you hit play and something just wasn't something it was god god said you go look in the mirror and you preach that again god my god the tears just i just wept god forgive me i said so that wednesday i started coming back to church and he's just been working on me day and night day and night more and more every day i wake up i love him more and i told some brothers i said i challenged him the other day challenge jesus what do you mean i said well i did i said prophet said you can never outlove the lord well i'm trying i want to try and out love him but i know the more i love him the more he's gonna love me amen but uh i'll tell you another thing i may be the last person in this building that had a television in their home i don't know but i ain't got no one no more by the grace of god brother matthew came over one night and helped me get him out he says i had his big 65-inch monster above my fireplace and i with my my knee i wasn't about to climb up there and pull that thing down so he'd come over and help me get it down got it out of the house and uh the very next day very next morning god gave me this scripture he told me to read ecclesiastics and this is what he said excuse me i'm over 40. i need my eyes out here hold on ecclesiastes 9 7 7 8 9 reads like this it says go thy way eat thy bread with joy drink thy wine with a merry heart for god now accepteth thy works let thy garments always be white let thy head lack no ointment live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity which he hath given thee unto the son all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labor which thou takest unto the sun i'm telling you folks it's time to get serious because god is on the move and uh like i said i just love him more and more i don't want to take up too much time it's hard getting late so god bless you all i love each and every one of you man well it's almost 9 30 so i think we just ought to do this again sometime amen i really think there's a hunger for god in our heart and and god is moving and i think we heard tonight where you find them and he's moving because he wants to get a hold of this so he can move in you and you can do that exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think and pretty soon not only is god moving on you not only is he moving in you but now he's using you to move on other people and that's one of the greatest things that can ever happen in your life so i think the lord just kind of spoken to us tonight and i think that the more we look in the more we'll be able to look out and the more he speaks to us on the inside the more he'll be moving on the outside amen he loves you he wants to do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think and he really wants to be manifested in your your mortal flesh that people can look at you and they can see god on the inside not anything it goes beyond temporary it becomes supernatural as we become closer and closer and more one with god i believe we'll see his hand moving and it will our love is going to call him down to manifest himself on one another and i think we're fixing to see some miracles and some things that are beyond anything that we ever dream of he's still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and he still can do for us exceedingly and abundantly what he could ask or think so brother billy if you could come and lead us in a little bit of worship anyway before we sing maybe we could just say anybody have a prayer request on their heart or his mind that they want god to do something for him just raise them up to him we'll we'll hold those right before the lord and ask god so let's stand together and let us pray together before brother billy leads us in some worship and turns our hearts to the lord our gracious heavenly father lord we had hands go up and what are those hands that went up it's our next testimony meeting fathers those that's placed something before your throne that's laid it out there and said lord i need you to move in my heart our sister was so hungry in her heart she she just wrote down the things that god needed to do for her lord you mentor lord your men are on the face and the people were just so desiring in their heart for you father that you've meant them lord you always made a believer in that still small place in their heart you always meet him father when they really come to you with the honesty of their heart

you to continually move continually speak to us continually let us grow in your spirit and your character and father may we have the courage to be able to tell of the things that you've done in our midst may your praises ring on our lips and in our hearts as we testify of what a mighty god you are father those that raise their hands this evening they have a hunger for you to do something for
