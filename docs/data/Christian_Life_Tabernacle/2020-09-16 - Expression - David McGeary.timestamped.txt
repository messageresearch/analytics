[36:21] and just read that wonderful portion of
[36:26] scripture there
[36:35] the gospel of saint john the first
[36:37] chapter
[36:39] it says in the beginning was the word
[36:45] and the word was with god and the word
[36:48] was god
[36:49] and the same was in the beginning with
[36:52] god all things were made

[37:20] in your precious name we pray tonight
[37:23] amen
[37:24] amen god bless you
[37:30] you know there's it's um
[37:33] it's uh
[37:38] certainly a time where
[37:42] you're always looking for
[37:46] new ways to figure out how to do things
[37:51] you know and everybody's coming out with
[37:56] different ideas and things i went out to
[37:59] see my
[38:01] mother and and you know as you know as
[38:03] you know my mom's 98 years old and
[38:07] and uh you know she's uh
[38:10] her arms she don't lift her arms as high
[38:12] as she did so i had to rebuild her
[38:14] closet and
[38:15] lower her clothes rack down and now she
[38:19] can't go down steps with just by herself
[38:21] so
[38:22] i built a little rail so she could hold
[38:24] on to and
[38:26] now the steps are getting too tall so
[38:29] i'm gonna have to go divide all the
[38:30] steps in half you know
[38:32] but as as she has a need
[38:36] there's you know you come up with ways
[38:39] to uh meet that need
[38:43] and uh and it wasn't until
[38:47] the the need was there that you even
[38:51] looked for a reason to
[38:54] uh to go further and do
[38:57] something and you know i i saw an
[39:00] article the other day that said out
[39:04] is the new in and it
[39:07] caught my eye so i thought well i'll
[39:10] read this article
[39:11] and it was talking about how everybody's
[39:14] eating
[39:15] outside now and so
[39:18] you can't eat inside but you eat outside
[39:22] and so now out's the new inn
[39:25] and i thought now that's about getting
[39:27] as confusing
[39:30] as it it can be you know and
[39:33] and so you come up with things and and
[39:35] and that's sort of what i'm
[39:37] kind of going through in a lot of ways
[39:39] here at
[39:40] church is trying to figure out ways to
[39:44] come up with things to meet all the
[39:47] different
[39:48] challenges and all the different ideas
[39:51] and opinions that are coming up and
[39:56] and the the sunday school children have
[39:58] been on my heart
[39:59] and uh um
[40:03] i i go have coffee uh sometimes in the
[40:06] morning i go to mcdonald's and uh
[40:09] and sit down and and meet with a bunch
[40:12] of old guys you know that
[40:15] all have their own ideas how the world
[40:17] should run
[40:19] and every now and then we get to just
[40:21] say a few things about the gospel
[40:23] you know and and talk about the gospel
[40:28] and we enjoy that and
[40:31] there it uh mcdonald's they have
[40:35] the back room blocked off
[40:38] and they don't let anybody go in there
[40:40] but every time i'm there there's a young
[40:42] boy there
[40:44] and he's the son of one of the workers
[40:49] and he's there back there on his
[40:51] computer
[40:52] trying to go to school and she'll wait
[40:55] on the customers and then
[40:57] come running in and help him with his
[41:00] problems and everything
[41:02] and and you know my heart began to break
[41:06] because that's where that kid spends his
[41:08] day
[41:09] you know and i know his mother's trying
[41:11] to do all that she can
[41:14] to you know raise her him and her family
[41:17] i don't know
[41:18] her her status in life maybe she's a
[41:22] single mother maybe she's
[41:24] a working mother and everything but you
[41:26] know and i just got
[41:28] thinking about our young people and and
[41:30] so
[41:31] we wanted to do something for them
[41:35] and so what we wanted to do
[41:38] was we can't have sunday school here
[41:41] anymore we don't have the spacing
[41:45] we don't have the room but so what i
[41:48] wanted to do was
[41:50] maybe take a saturday morning maybe once
[41:53] a month or every three weeks or
[41:56] whatever and just have the kids that
[42:01] can come and want to come
[42:04] a saturday morning that we can come
[42:07] and they we can get together and we
[42:09] could have
[42:10] a little bible school lesson and
[42:15] and then have maybe some activities and
[42:17] have a little
[42:19] a fellowship or food and i i watch how
[42:22] they all get together after service and
[42:25] run all around and everything and and
[42:28] so we just wanted to provide something
[42:31] now
[42:31] you know everything that we do
[42:35] is all voluntary you know all our
[42:37] deacons are our volunteers
[42:40] you know what i mean they don't get
[42:43] really
[42:43] paid anything here
[42:48] as far as monetary things and there's a
[42:50] blessing that comes with it
[42:53] and the trustees and the sunday school
[42:55] teachers and the
[42:56] musicians those are all just services of
[43:00] sacrifice you know they're you're not
[43:03] obligated
[43:04] and we never want anything to ever be
[43:07] done
[43:08] by an obligation you know so
[43:11] uh uh and and i know like anytime we
[43:14] have a saturday activity
[43:16] maybe your children or some of them
[43:18] might be in
[43:21] a little little league or baseball or
[43:25] soccer or whatever some of the sports
[43:28] are that they play football and
[43:30] and if you're committed to that that's
[43:33] fine
[43:34] but everything that we do is for those
[43:36] that that want to do it
[43:38] and alls we can do is make the
[43:41] opportunity available for them to come
[43:44] so
[43:45] and even those that are listening in so
[43:48] you know
[43:48] saturday i think it's from is it from 9
[43:50] to
[43:52] 12 is that what it is i don't see
[43:54] cosmond
[43:55] where are you hiding 9 to 12.
[43:59] 10 to 12. okay they shortened it up so i
[44:02] don't know what we're doing away with
[44:04] but uh okay so it's going to be 10 to 12
[44:07] so
[44:08] we want to have a little sunday school
[44:11] um
[44:12] lesson and then maybe some activities
[44:14] outside some
[44:15] sort of some games to play and then
[44:18] we'll
[44:18] eat some pizza so the parents are
[44:21] welcome to come
[44:22] you're welcome to bring your kids and
[44:24] we'll probably i'll probably teach a
[44:26] little sunday school class to everybody
[44:28] here
[44:29] in the morning and then um
[44:34] have that and maybe some just some time
[44:37] of fellowship
[44:38] for the kids but it's for the kids it's
[44:41] for those who want to be here
[44:43] if you can bring your children i
[44:45] understand
[44:46] that's wonderful if you can't bring your
[44:48] children
[44:49] we understand that too we're just making
[44:52] it available to whoever
[44:55] can you know who's ever hearts in it we
[44:58] just want to do something for the kids
[45:00] that want to come out and
[45:01] and if there's 10 we'll have a good time
[45:03] with 10.
[45:05] if there's 20 praise the lord you know
[45:07] what i mean
[45:08] and uh and so we just want to create a
[45:12] an atmosphere and uh and
[45:15] and do a little something for our our
[45:17] children
[45:18] and and i certainly uh know
[45:21] that in the situations that
[45:24] are we're in now i i've never seen a
[45:27] time where people are getting burned out
[45:30] so easy you know i mean there's their
[45:33] fuses are
[45:33] short and they're looking for some kind
[45:36] of
[45:37] relief somewhere or anything
[45:40] i i went to my doctor
[45:44] while i was out helping my mom i injured
[45:47] my
[45:48] thumb again you know which was my own
[45:51] fault
[45:51] because i knew not to do something
[45:55] but because i knew not to do it i
[45:58] figured i'd be okay doing it
[46:02] and i remembered why
[46:05] i got a first-hand lesson on why you
[46:07] don't do
[46:08] that you don't tighten a drill chuck
[46:11] with your drill plugged in
[46:13] and so that's just kind of a rule and
[46:16] you lock it if it's a battery drill but
[46:18] anyway so uh but i went to the doctor
[46:22] and everybody in the doctor's office is
[46:25] coughing
[46:27] and i thought and you're going to take
[46:30] my temperature
[46:32] you're going to ask me all these
[46:33] questions and all you people are in
[46:35] there
[46:38] and it's from it's from wearing those
[46:40] masks all day long
[46:43] okay you know what i mean and so you you
[46:45] know
[46:46] i'm sitting there and it's and i'm
[46:48] watching the nurses go down the hall
[46:50] and every time they turn the corner
[46:52] they're going
[46:53] they're stretching it out like this you
[46:55] know trying to
[46:57] catch a breath you know what i mean so
[46:59] everybody's coughing you know and it
[47:01] it's just like man
[47:03] isn't it it's not going to be long
[47:05] there's going to be a whole thing out
[47:07] of how that wearing mask causes
[47:10] deep respiratory trouble and everything
[47:13] but there's one thing i do believe i do
[47:16] believe everybody's going to be hearing
[47:18] better
[47:19] because all their ears are like this now
[47:22] and uh so that is certainly
[47:26] gonna make it uh where we can hear
[47:29] uh better you know but uh i'm sure the
[47:33] dry skin and everything behind your ears
[47:35] is gonna be there and
[47:37] so we're just going through a challenge
[47:40] and
[47:41] and it's real important i think in a way
[47:45] of how that
[47:48] we react
[47:51] to the challenge and
[47:55] and i think there's a reason for it
[47:58] so i just want to spend a few minutes uh
[48:01] uh
[48:01] talking to you tonight a little bit
[48:06] about expression and
[48:10] we we know that uh
[48:14] the scripture is if we go on
[48:18] and a read here
[48:21] in this uh scripture of
[48:25] john it says that this was the true
[48:27] light
[48:28] with light of every man that cometh into
[48:31] the world that's the ninth verse
[48:34] and he was in the world and the world
[48:37] was made by him
[48:39] and the world knew him not now think of
[48:42] that
[48:42] the world was made by him
[48:47] and the world knew him not he came
[48:50] unto his own and his own
[48:53] received them not but as many as
[48:56] received him
[48:59] to to them gave he
[49:02] power to become the sons of god
[49:07] even to them that believed on his name
[49:11] which were born not of blood nor of the
[49:14] will of the flesh
[49:16] nor of the will of man but of god
[49:20] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[49:22] among us
[49:24] and we beheld his glory the glory
[49:27] as the only begotten of the father
[49:30] full of grace and and so
[49:34] we know that that
[49:39] this great love that god
[49:43] had for us that god so loved the world
[49:47] that he gave his only begotten son
[49:51] but god
[49:54] sent his son because his son
[49:58] was an expression god's
[50:01] love was expressed in his son
[50:05] jesus god so loved the world
[50:09] he gave his only begotten son
[50:13] and and what it was
[50:16] what that jesus was was
[50:19] he was the love of god expressed
[50:24] and and when when jesus
[50:28] uh was here
[50:31] on the earth and he began to
[50:35] live his life the scripture tells us
[50:39] that he was
[50:40] tempted in every way that were tempted
[50:44] and you know i always noticed that that
[50:47] was one of the things that
[50:49] satan always tried to do
[50:53] is he he he never had problem
[50:56] with people
[51:01] seeing the deity of jesus christ
[51:04] making him all god because if he was
[51:08] all god then there
[51:11] you never would have any aspiration
[51:14] of being like him or you would ne you
[51:18] would
[51:18] it would it would be impossible for you
[51:22] to even comprehend or perceive
[51:25] that you could be christ-like
[51:29] so as long as satan could put him out of
[51:32] reach
[51:33] and make him to a place that he he
[51:36] wasn't
[51:37] obtainable he wasn't touchable
[51:41] but you you notice how john wanted
[51:44] to to say here he says and the word was
[51:47] made flesh and dwelt among us
[51:49] and we beheld his glory the only
[51:52] begotten
[51:52] of the father and he said that that
[51:56] we we touched him and we beheld him
[51:59] and we knew him and we seen them so
[52:03] that they they saw him
[52:06] as a man but they saw
[52:10] what that it was that was in him
[52:14] and he went on to say uh even
[52:18] in in preaching he says he who have
[52:21] seen me have seen the father
[52:25] and so he he was an expression
[52:30] of of the love of god
[52:34] in other words god wanted to have some
[52:36] way
[52:37] to show fallen man who
[52:41] by the fall in the garden had stepped
[52:44] out of the grace of god
[52:46] out of the atmosphere of protection
[52:50] that he was in as long as adam and eve
[52:54] stayed in that garden they would have
[52:57] remained
[52:58] the sons and daughters of god they would
[53:01] have continually had their dominion
[53:04] they would have continually lived right
[53:08] but
[53:08] something had to come in
[53:11] and to defile them and to and to
[53:15] break them down and in the masterpiece
[53:18] brother branham teaches he said that
[53:20] god saw his broken fallen family
[53:24] and right then in his heart the
[53:27] the very thing that he wanted to do is
[53:30] restore
[53:30] that family back to what that they had
[53:34] lost
[53:35] and and when we we realized it
[53:38] it's hard for us to realize but he said
[53:41] to as many
[53:43] as believe on him he would give them
[53:46] power to become the sons and daughters
[53:50] of god
[53:51] so god wanted to share what that he was
[53:55] that was
[53:56] the purpose that he made man in the
[53:58] beginning
[53:59] and when you think of man you might
[54:03] think well he made adam in the beginning
[54:05] god dwelt alone
[54:07] and god wanted to have fellowship god
[54:10] wanted to share
[54:11] himself and so we come a part of that
[54:16] we were in his mind we were in his
[54:18] thinking
[54:19] and the reason that he he was there is
[54:22] because he wanted
[54:24] to share himself he wanted to express
[54:26] himself
[54:27] and when man fell
[54:31] and separated out from god they they
[54:34] what took over man was unbelief
[54:38] and we know we know that through that
[54:40] tree of good and knowledge
[54:42] good and evil that cain's seed came up
[54:45] and
[54:45] man begin to seek after knowledge they
[54:48] begin to seek after intellect
[54:50] they begin to make a way for themselves
[54:54] in fact they begin to worship
[54:57] god after their own method
[55:00] by building their own altars bringing
[55:03] their own
[55:04] sacrifices offering their own
[55:07] praise and yet man could never find his
[55:10] way back to god
[55:12] god had to provide a way for man to come
[55:15] back to him
[55:16] and can understand that if you backslide
[55:21] or if you fail and you have a failure in
[55:25] the flesh you lose your temper you
[55:27] you look at things you shouldn't look at
[55:30] you get frustrated
[55:32] and say things you you don't really mean
[55:35] to say
[55:36] one of those spirits of gossip just
[55:38] comes flying around
[55:40] and they find you at a weak spot you
[55:42] know what i mean and you're all bummed
[55:44] out and you've
[55:45] worked hard and you know you're you're
[55:47] about ready to like i said i'd pull out
[55:50] my hair sometimes if i could
[55:52] and that spirit just drops on you
[55:55] and in the moment of pressure
[55:59] you you say things that normally you
[56:02] wouldn't
[56:03] say or or you caused something to happen
[56:07] you do something hurtful
[56:09] if you you know you just maybe lose your
[56:12] temper
[56:13] with your children or your loved one or
[56:16] or whatever those circumstances are
[56:18] the prophet of god said in that message
[56:21] letting off the pressure
[56:22] he said he walked up there and he asked
[56:24] that nurse you know uh you know how do i
[56:26] get to himself aren't you
[56:27] someone from just she just read them the
[56:29] right act
[56:31] and you know and i this thought is so
[56:33] beautiful he just stepped back and said
[56:35] wow she's under a lot of pressure
[56:38] you know what i mean if she something
[56:41] has
[56:41] made her to do that and when
[56:45] when you do something like that and you
[56:48] you you
[56:49] you find that the the flesh rises up
[56:53] you know god's made a provision for that
[56:56] he's made a way back out of that
[56:59] circumstance
[57:01] he he's he's made a way back to himself
[57:06] and this is what he did this is why he
[57:08] sent his son he wanted to show man that
[57:11] he may he gave a way back for man to
[57:14] come back to him
[57:15] because without god life
[57:19] is absolutely a drag
[57:23] i i mean there's no joy
[57:26] there's no peace there's no hope
[57:30] there there there's no
[57:33] even any anticipation
[57:36] of a deliverance you know i'll tell you
[57:40] one thing i'm looking up
[57:43] a lot more than i ever had saying boy my
[57:46] redemption draweth nigh
[57:48] i'll tell you what words are starting to
[57:51] come out of the believer's mouth
[57:52] more than ever even so come quickly
[57:56] lord jesus
[57:59] lord is it even possible
[58:02] for this thing to go any uh
[58:05] any deeper into uh
[58:10] into the condition to that that it
[58:13] it's going into and you know i i
[58:16] just come from the you know what the
[58:20] california so you know that that's where
[58:22] the civilization
[58:23] finally ended up now all the filth of
[58:26] the world
[58:27] comes from out there every kind of
[58:30] philosophy and
[58:31] thinking and an ungodly conception
[58:35] that's being birthed out there
[58:37] and being sold to the world through
[58:39] entertainment and
[58:41] through songs and music and and
[58:44] politics and philosophy and everything
[58:48] and the greatest equation
[58:50] to it all is exactly what the scripture
[58:53] said
[58:53] they no longer retain god in their
[58:56] thinking
[58:57] they no longer desire
[59:00] to retain god in their thinking
[59:04] so their conscience has been snared with
[59:07] the hot iron
[59:08] and so all their actions are no longer
[59:12] uh no longer considered
[59:16] to to involve god at all
[59:20] and so the world there he was in their
[59:23] midst and the world
[59:24] knew him not they no longer risk to
[59:27] retain
[59:28] god in their knowledge that's what the
[59:31] word
[59:32] of god said we have come to that place
[59:35] where man does not want to keep god
[59:38] in their knowledge and that's the most
[59:41] important thing
[59:42] for us to do is to remember in the
[59:46] beginning god in the beginning was the
[59:49] word
[59:49] and the word was with god and the word
[59:52] was
[59:53] god that that is the ultimate
[59:57] uh truth of
[1:00:00] the uh that that there is of god
[1:00:04] and now there's god there's a commercial
[1:00:06] out about all
[1:00:08] and the whole commercials shows guys and
[1:00:11] test tubes and
[1:00:12] all this and talking about the answer
[1:00:15] and talking about the deliverance
[1:00:17] and i almost felt like bringing it in
[1:00:20] playing it here at church
[1:00:21] and they say what causes that science
[1:00:28] oh boy i'm going to put all my trust
[1:00:32] in science
[1:00:35] an ungodly scientist
[1:00:40] and that's what the world does and
[1:00:43] here's this little voice
[1:00:45] crying out in this day in a little old
[1:00:48] body just a humble ministry
[1:00:51] saying science is of the devil
[1:00:57] manic is looking so they're they're
[1:01:01] looking to science
[1:01:03] uh they're looking to government
[1:01:06] they they begin to look they begin to
[1:01:10] look
[1:01:10] this way and they begin to look that way
[1:01:13] and they begin to point
[1:01:15] and there's many voices that says
[1:01:18] lo he is here in other words you know
[1:01:22] it's not somebody that says they're
[1:01:23] jesus
[1:01:25] it's somebody that's offering
[1:01:27] deliverance
[1:01:29] that's what they say in other words
[1:01:31] though he's here
[1:01:33] in other words there's peace and safety
[1:01:35] here
[1:01:36] you know there's peace that we're going
[1:01:38] to come up with a vaccine that
[1:01:41] is going to give you all peace and put
[1:01:44] you
[1:01:45] back to normal well i'll tell you
[1:01:48] something a lot of people are glad to be
[1:01:50] six feet apart
[1:01:54] and i've seen a lot of people i'm glad
[1:01:56] they're wearing a mask
[1:02:00] you know i want to see all that you know
[1:02:04] paint and all that stuff i think they
[1:02:06] look real good in the mask
[1:02:11] i mean you understand that that you
[1:02:14] cannot
[1:02:15] let what is
[1:02:18] being presented and the atmosphere
[1:02:21] that's being created affects you
[1:02:25] because the atmosphere is what
[1:02:29] draws out the attribute
[1:02:33] and i want to point that out this
[1:02:36] evening that
[1:02:37] that the attribute is drawn out
[1:02:41] so when god wanted to express
[1:02:44] his love in his son god
[1:02:47] had within him attributes
[1:02:50] we we know that we could we we read it
[1:02:53] we read it in uh he says he said a
[1:02:56] thought
[1:02:57] is it's a thought when it's expressed is
[1:03:00] a word
[1:03:02] and a thought expressed is a word but it
[1:03:04] has to be a thought first
[1:03:06] so it's god's attributes then it becomes
[1:03:10] a thought
[1:03:11] then a word then it's spoken
[1:03:15] so what draws out the attribute
[1:03:18] is the the atmosphere
[1:03:21] now god wanted to man to know
[1:03:26] that he was a god of mercy
[1:03:32] he wanted man to know that he wanted
[1:03:35] he wanted to express to man
[1:03:39] even though they had fallen even though
[1:03:41] they had sinned
[1:03:43] even though they had rejected him within
[1:03:45] him
[1:03:46] lied an attribute of mercy he was
[1:03:49] willing to have mercy
[1:03:53] and so here's blind bartimaeus
[1:03:58] he he's he's blind he's
[1:04:01] stuck in the corner the crowd is just
[1:04:04] screaming everywhere and he cries out
[1:04:09] about son of david have
[1:04:12] mercy on me
[1:04:16] he's crying out thou son of david
[1:04:19] have mercy on me and jesus stops
[1:04:24] yes because
[1:04:27] that cry that that atmosphere
[1:04:31] that it drew the attribute
[1:04:35] out of jesus that god
[1:04:38] wanted to express he was an
[1:04:42] expression so the
[1:04:45] the situation arised
[1:04:49] by the knowledge and orchestration
[1:04:53] of god to create the atmosphere
[1:04:57] to draw the attribute out of
[1:05:00] jesus because that was jesus's purpose
[1:05:04] he who hath seen me hath seen the father
[1:05:09] the works i do i do not
[1:05:12] by myself but it's the father
[1:05:15] in me that does the works in other words
[1:05:18] it's the attribute of god being
[1:05:21] expressed
[1:05:22] through me that's the work
[1:05:27] the work was in god in the beginning
[1:05:33] because god was merciful so when jesus
[1:05:37] came across an atmosphere
[1:05:42] or circumstance or situation
[1:05:46] that called for mercy
[1:05:50] there had to be what a mercy
[1:05:54] to respond well how did that
[1:05:58] situation how did the call get there
[1:06:07] sure the call was
[1:06:10] orchestrated by the father
[1:06:14] so that the attribute could be
[1:06:17] manifested
[1:06:19] just like when he fed the five thousand
[1:06:22] he had compassion on him
[1:06:25] he was a provider that attribute was in
[1:06:28] god
[1:06:29] that he was a provider and therefore
[1:06:32] that
[1:06:32] situation was orchestrated by the hand
[1:06:35] of god
[1:06:36] that caused jesus that the work that the
[1:06:40] father was in him
[1:06:41] fulfilling the expression of who that
[1:06:44] the father was
[1:06:46] because there was no way for man to
[1:06:49] know god unless god
[1:06:52] expressed himself and the only way you
[1:06:55] can know god is by what that you are
[1:07:02] remember you can't mix with the dog
[1:07:08] it's okay the only way that it could
[1:07:10] that you could relate to it
[1:07:14] if it came from the flesh
[1:07:18] it had to come by way of something you
[1:07:21] could relate to
[1:07:22] as long as it was a supernatural as long
[1:07:25] as it was an angelic
[1:07:27] as long as it was something out of the
[1:07:29] realms of
[1:07:30] human in the supernatural
[1:07:33] you could always dismiss it
[1:07:37] for yourself because you
[1:07:40] knew that you are flesh but he was
[1:07:44] born in every way
[1:07:48] that we are even tempted
[1:07:52] the way that we are so that we could
[1:07:55] look at a man
[1:07:56] and see that god was manifested
[1:08:00] in the flesh and he who says that christ
[1:08:03] has not come in the flesh
[1:08:06] is antichrist
[1:08:11] so now they saw a guy is not this
[1:08:14] the son of joseph is not just a legit
[1:08:18] illegitimate roman soldier kid
[1:08:22] who that man joseph covered up for
[1:08:28] they never saw jesus as god
[1:08:33] it had to be revealed
[1:08:38] you say oh yeah they didn't know when he
[1:08:40] calmed the stores and
[1:08:42] the wind they sat back and said what
[1:08:45] manner of man is
[1:08:50] this
[1:08:53] they saw a deity moving in flesh
[1:08:58] and that was god's victory in christ
[1:09:03] that god so loved the world that he
[1:09:06] poured himself into a man
[1:09:09] and that man began to express i don't do
[1:09:12] these works by myself
[1:09:14] it's the attributes that god put in me
[1:09:17] that are being pulled out of me by
[1:09:21] the atmosphere and the circumstance
[1:09:24] that's presented before me
[1:09:30] he couldn't help himself
[1:09:34] and we saw that that so we saw that
[1:09:37] attributes of mercy
[1:09:38] we saw that attribute of forgiveness
[1:09:42] the woman's caught in adultery
[1:09:46] here's all these self-righteous people
[1:09:48] that know no more about god in anything
[1:09:51] me and matthew were fellowshipping the
[1:09:53] day it was so beautiful
[1:09:54] he said you know that in the temple they
[1:09:57] had the temple right
[1:09:59] you know why they built that temple to
[1:10:02] house the ark
[1:10:04] the ark of the covenant but the ark of
[1:10:07] the covenant was stolen
[1:10:09] in and i think it was 586
[1:10:14] bc there was nothing
[1:10:17] in there
[1:10:20] they were playing church
[1:10:26] oh how was it to go into the holy of
[1:10:28] holies oh it's really something
[1:10:30] there ain't even nothing in there
[1:10:35] the the the ark was gone it was built
[1:10:39] the holy of holies was built to house
[1:10:41] the ark
[1:10:42] because god the the the it represented
[1:10:45] the mercy seat
[1:10:46] it represented the things of god the
[1:10:48] blood offering the sacrifice
[1:10:50] it wasn't even he had departed
[1:10:54] and then when he came in flesh
[1:10:57] they rent the veil another
[1:11:00] they tore the veil open so the people
[1:11:03] could look
[1:11:04] and see there was no mercy seat there
[1:11:07] there was no covenant there there wasn't
[1:11:11] even a covenant there anymore the
[1:11:13] covenant now was hanging on the cross
[1:11:16] [Applause]
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:19] god's sacrifice for our sins
[1:11:24] glory how beautiful
[1:11:28] showing this old empty temple
[1:11:31] and where was he he was in
[1:11:34] a man
[1:11:38] a man showing the attributes of god
[1:11:42] and then so you you take forgiveness so
[1:11:45] here's this woman he
[1:11:46] that's caught in adultery and all these
[1:11:49] self-righteous guys were going to stone
[1:11:50] her
[1:11:51] the law says this the law says that oh
[1:11:54] my
[1:11:55] very stuck what has to happen
[1:12:00] god's real thinking
[1:12:05] what is it has to be an attribute
[1:12:08] first then a thought
[1:12:11] then a word so the real
[1:12:14] attribute of god the way that god
[1:12:17] really looks at the circumstance the way
[1:12:20] god thinks about the circumstance god's
[1:12:23] what that wasn't stone the sinner
[1:12:26] stoned the woman
[1:12:30] no no here's the expression
[1:12:33] of the attribute of god made flesh now
[1:12:36] here's a circumstance
[1:12:38] and he can't help himself he's got to
[1:12:41] express
[1:12:42] mercy
[1:12:46] because that's the thought of god god's
[1:12:49] thought
[1:12:50] towards that woman was forgiveness i
[1:12:53] forgive her
[1:12:59] he knew her sins
[1:13:03] he knew what she done she he knew what
[1:13:06] she'd been doing
[1:13:09] we don't know why
[1:13:14] you know there was a harlot in the
[1:13:16] scripture
[1:13:18] that was more righteous one of the
[1:13:21] fathers of israel
[1:13:25] she didn't have any seed she didn't have
[1:13:27] any offspring she didn't have
[1:13:29] any inheritance so she posed
[1:13:33] you know the story as a harlot
[1:13:37] enticed to get
[1:13:41] a child and for witness had a witness
[1:13:46] and when she revealed herself he said
[1:13:48] thou art more righteous
[1:13:50] than i am and she claimed her
[1:13:53] inheritance
[1:13:55] don't you get all bent out of shape when
[1:13:57] you find somebody in a bad circumstance
[1:13:59] because they might be allowed to be in
[1:14:02] that circumstance
[1:14:03] so they can claim their inheritance
[1:14:06] which is the attributes of god our
[1:14:09] inheritance
[1:14:10] is the attributes of god the works that
[1:14:14] i
[1:14:14] do you shall do also that's our
[1:14:17] inheritance
[1:14:22] our inheritance is not the miracles the
[1:14:25] miracle is the result
[1:14:27] of the attribute
[1:14:32] the miracle is the result of the love
[1:14:39] he looked at that woman thought oh my
[1:14:42] goodness
[1:14:43] daughter
[1:14:49] boy that serpent's got you in a mess
[1:14:54] and he looks he says and she finally
[1:14:57] says
[1:14:58] he says woman where are thou accusers
[1:15:02] i'll tell you i i
[1:15:06] i i'm looking
[1:15:09] he said that's one of the people i want
[1:15:11] to meet
[1:15:12] in the scripture because i can identify
[1:15:16] with that condition that she was in
[1:15:19] she didn't try to hide her sins she said
[1:15:23] master
[1:15:23] there's none to condemn me
[1:15:27] but you and he said neither
[1:15:31] will i condemn thee go
[1:15:34] thy way and sin no more
[1:15:38] and she become one of the patriarchs of
[1:15:41] the scriptures
[1:15:42] and the bible why because she was a
[1:15:45] recipient
[1:15:49] of an attribute of god that's the works
[1:15:53] the works that i do you'll do
[1:15:58] oh we want the work that you can see the
[1:16:01] physical
[1:16:01] manifestation we want the old stiff leg
[1:16:04] to come straight and then oh oh praise
[1:16:07] god
[1:16:08] miracle i'll tell you what a miracle
[1:16:11] is someone being born again
[1:16:15] that's a miracle and and so you you look
[1:16:19] there
[1:16:19] and so all of a sudden the circumstance
[1:16:22] drew out
[1:16:23] the forgiveness because that's what he
[1:16:27] was
[1:16:29] he was an expression of the father
[1:16:32] we could see the father
[1:16:36] not see the flesh
[1:16:40] you can't see the father till you can
[1:16:42] see the attribute
[1:16:47] you can relation my mom bless her heart
[1:16:50] she's a catholic
[1:16:52] and she'll go in that room and put that
[1:16:54] mass on
[1:16:57] you know and they're in there singing oh
[1:16:59] ramu's day
[1:17:00] and all these chants and saying the
[1:17:03] rosary and everything

[1:17:22] her
[1:17:23] two sons that believe the message
[1:17:31] your mama's got that going for her too
[1:17:37] yeah if if the woman
[1:17:40] believing wife can sanctify the
[1:17:42] unbelieving husband
[1:17:44] and vice versa don't think when the
[1:17:46] prophet of god said all that you
[1:17:48] loved and all that loved you will be
[1:17:51] there
[1:17:53] let me tell you you've got a lot more
[1:17:56] going on in you then you realize
[1:17:59] i i'm not preaching this weekend george
[1:18:02] smith is preaching
[1:18:05] but you yeah i want you to see that
[1:18:09] that it was the the atmosphere
[1:18:14] was right the person was right
[1:18:19] god allowed her to be there
[1:18:22] how many believe the footsteps of the
[1:18:24] righteous order of the lord
[1:18:26] do you believe that jesus's footsteps
[1:18:28] was ordered by the father
[1:18:30] i do nothing unless the father tells me
[1:18:32] first
[1:18:35] i have need to go by there i'm going to
[1:18:39] go this way
[1:18:40] i'm going to go down this street today i
[1:18:42] feel compelled in my
[1:18:44] spirit
[1:18:49] remember he was led
[1:18:52] by the spirit go get us into the tape
[1:18:56] he was led by the spirit to the
[1:19:00] circumstance
[1:19:02] how can he be led to the circumstance if
[1:19:04] the father
[1:19:05] didn't already know the circumstance
[1:19:07] would be there
[1:19:10] oh we need to get rid of our
[1:19:12] self-righteousness
[1:19:15] get out of here self-righteousness
[1:19:20] so he expressed that
[1:19:23] he had to express it because that's what
[1:19:26] he was doing
[1:19:27] was expressing the father he was the
[1:19:31] father's victory
[1:19:35] over the serpent seed i will put enmity
[1:19:38] between thy seed
[1:19:41] and the serpent seed i'll i'll
[1:19:44] i'll win this victory i'll redeem my
[1:19:47] family
[1:19:48] all the father hath given me will come
[1:19:51] so there so
[1:19:52] then he had in him deliverance
[1:19:57] so he meets the woman at the well
[1:20:01] how many husbands have you had oh i'm
[1:20:03] not married
[1:20:07] you know i i know what i'd have done
[1:20:10] liar liar
[1:20:11] pants on fire nose is longer than the
[1:20:13] telephone wire
[1:20:18] he says oh you've spoken the truth
[1:20:23] you're not married but you've been
[1:20:24] married five times
[1:20:27] and the one you're with now is not your
[1:20:29] husband
[1:20:31] why why
[1:20:34] because there was deliverance
[1:20:38] the circumstance the atmosphere
[1:20:41] was calling for deliverance
[1:20:47] she she went to that well to get
[1:20:49] delivered
[1:20:52] he went there to deliver hallelujah
[1:20:58] there was going to be a collision amen
[1:21:02] sin and life
[1:21:03] was going to meet the prophet of god
[1:21:05] said every time the spirit comes there's
[1:21:07] a conflict
[1:21:09] there's a battle there's a war going on
[1:21:17] oh i don't have one he said give me the
[1:21:21] drink
[1:21:25] you know you don't have nothing to draw
[1:21:26] with he said oh if you know who you were
[1:21:28] talking to
[1:21:29] you'd ask me for living water
[1:21:33] in other words i've got something to
[1:21:35] give
[1:21:36] you
[1:21:40] you know you should be knowing where i'm
[1:21:42] going with this message
[1:21:48] deliverance the man possessed with
[1:21:52] demons
[1:21:54] deliverance he had the attribute of
[1:21:57] deliverance
[1:21:58] salvation he had the attribute to save
[1:22:03] he's walking down the street and
[1:22:05] everybody's crying and everything
[1:22:07] he comes along and all of a sudden he
[1:22:08] stops and says zacchaeus
[1:22:11] come down i'm going home to eat with you
[1:22:16] because the son of man has come to call
[1:22:19] sinners
[1:22:20] to repentance
[1:22:23] so you you you see he it was
[1:22:26] he he was the revelation
[1:22:30] of the father
[1:22:33] christ was the mystery of god
[1:22:37] revealed he was the revelation
[1:22:40] of the father all that the father was
[1:22:44] he poured into christ every move he made
[1:22:48] was an expression of the attributes of
[1:22:51] god deliverance
[1:22:53] healing saving okay everything
[1:22:57] joy peace sorrow entering into the
[1:23:00] burden
[1:23:01] raising the dead you could just go
[1:23:03] through all his life
[1:23:05] and every work and remember those works
[1:23:08] weren't his works
[1:23:11] he was sent to express the father
[1:23:15] it was the father that did the work
[1:23:18] and let me put that in the god in the
[1:23:20] beginning was the word
[1:23:22] the word was a thought it had to be an
[1:23:26] attribute first then it became a thought
[1:23:30] then it became the word in the beginning
[1:23:33] was the word
[1:23:34] in the beginning was the expression
[1:23:39] jesus was an expression of god therefore
[1:23:43] jesus was god
[1:23:51] but there's one mediator between man and
[1:23:55] god
[1:23:56] the man jesus christ
[1:24:02] the beautiful thing about the lord
[1:24:06] that when you've seen jesus
[1:24:10] when you've seen his works
[1:24:14] if you can't believe me for my
[1:24:17] words believe me for
[1:24:20] my works because
[1:24:23] i do not these works myself it's the
[1:24:27] father
[1:24:28] that does the works in other words you
[1:24:30] didn't see me
[1:24:32] you saw the father this is how the
[1:24:35] father
[1:24:36] thinks
[1:24:40] can i say that again that
[1:24:43] was how the father thought
[1:24:46] when jesus meant
[1:24:49] an atmosphere
[1:24:53] he thought about that atmosphere the way
[1:24:57] the father
[1:24:58] thought about that atmosphere
[1:25:01] so the thought came first
[1:25:04] the attribute was there god
[1:25:08] then the thought then the word
[1:25:13] receive thy sight i will not condemn you
[1:25:19] go sin no more come down the son of man
[1:25:23] saves you then the word went out
[1:25:27] because it now became word
[1:25:31] that's a longer sermon
[1:25:35] so he was the revelation and therefore
[1:25:40] what was so beautiful
[1:25:44] is that when jesus was expressing it
[1:25:49] he was now making the love of god
[1:25:52] available to man
[1:25:58] all that the father was the attributes
[1:26:01] by displaying those attributes
[1:26:05] and by showing how the father looked at
[1:26:08] it
[1:26:08] by revealing what the father would do
[1:26:12] how the father thinks he was now
[1:26:15] making available to you the
[1:26:18] thinking of the father
[1:26:22] let this mind be in you
[1:26:25] that was in christ don't look upon thy
[1:26:28] own
[1:26:28] needs but look upon the needs of others
[1:26:35] you know it's hard for us to think our
[1:26:37] kids have needs
[1:26:40] it's hard for us to think our teenagers
[1:26:43] have needs
[1:26:47] but sometimes you've got to think what a
[1:26:49] father do
[1:26:54] and so we begin to see that that that
[1:26:57] he was in able to impart
[1:27:02] what he was to us
[1:27:07] that was what his victory was
[1:27:12] we are his victory
[1:27:15] jesus was the father's victory
[1:27:18] we are jesus's victory
[1:27:21] we he was victorious
[1:27:26] when he was able to impart
[1:27:29] the thinking of the father
[1:27:33] to the children
[1:27:38] where you could think like he thought
[1:27:41] where you could be one with him
[1:27:46] where when you meant the circumstance
[1:27:49] and the atmosphere that attribute
[1:27:53] would be drawn out of you you don't
[1:27:56] think god knew this whole mess would be
[1:27:59] here
[1:28:01] this whole mess is here so that the true
[1:28:04] attribute and the true thinking of god
[1:28:08] towards the whole thing would be
[1:28:11] manifested in you
[1:28:19] are you worried i don't worry
[1:28:24] well what happens if you get sick
[1:28:28] brother mcgarry what happens if you get
[1:28:31] c19
[1:28:34] guess what i'm going to do i'm going to
[1:28:38] call the elders of the church
[1:28:40] and have them lay hands on me i'm going
[1:28:42] to confess my sins
[1:28:44] that i'll recover because that's thus
[1:28:48] saith the lord
[1:28:54] i'm not opposed to doctors
[1:28:58] i've been sick enough i asked the guy do
[1:28:59] you got a gun
[1:29:03] i've been so seasick that i would have
[1:29:06] paid you
[1:29:08] to throw me overboard
[1:29:12] i i really i said there's a captain got
[1:29:14] a rifle
[1:29:16] i don't i don't want to live another
[1:29:18] minute sick
[1:29:19] out of my mind so sick i
[1:29:22] crawled off the boat and kissed the dock
[1:29:26] and hugged the hug the thing they tied
[1:29:29] the boat to
[1:29:31] you know and we have something that's
[1:29:34] called land sickness
[1:29:37] you get rocking so long that when you
[1:29:39] get on earth the earth still and you're
[1:29:41] going woo
[1:29:43] in everything yeah we can get sick
[1:29:49] we can get down we can get out
[1:29:53] but don't you understand something that
[1:29:55] when you get there
[1:29:58] that circumstance calls
[1:30:01] for the attribute of god
[1:30:08] it calls for the attribute of god
[1:30:11] where's that attribute at
[1:30:15] does anybody know where that attribute
[1:30:17] at is there anybody here can give me a
[1:30:19] witness
[1:30:20] anybody can raise their hand and say
[1:30:22] brother mcgary
[1:30:23] it's here it's right in me amen so when
[1:30:27] i get in that place
[1:30:29] my condition is going to call for the
[1:30:32] attribute
[1:30:33] that is in you because you are his
[1:30:36] victory
[1:30:37] that he imparted that attribute
[1:30:41] to you the works
[1:30:45] that i do shall you do also
[1:30:50] i will not leave you comfortless but i
[1:30:53] will come again
[1:30:54] in other words the attributes will come
[1:30:56] again and be with you even
[1:30:58] in you until the end
[1:31:03] i don't have to worry about being sick
[1:31:05] as long as you're not sick
[1:31:09] and if we bo if we're sick that's what
[1:31:10] we'll do we'll pray together
[1:31:14] because wherever two or three are
[1:31:15] gathered together in my name
[1:31:17] there i'll be
[1:31:20] you know that he couldn't be a healer
[1:31:24] until there was sickness
[1:31:28] so we're his victory
[1:31:33] so he he's imparted
[1:31:37] into us we say his spirit
[1:31:42] like it's some sort of rub oil
[1:31:50] a spirit's got identification
[1:31:54] the five identifications of the church a
[1:31:58] spirit
[1:32:00] the identification of the spirit these
[1:32:03] are the fruits
[1:32:05] of the spirit these are the
[1:32:07] identification
[1:32:08] of the spirit this by your fruits
[1:32:13] you will know them by you the attributes
[1:32:16] what you're known by
[1:32:19] hear me now what you're known by
[1:32:23] is what the atmosphere draws out of you
[1:32:32] that's your identification
[1:32:37] you're not known by your words remember
[1:32:40] what brother branham said
[1:32:41] he says that's like the ballistics
[1:32:44] of a bullet he said it'll go so fast
[1:32:49] it'll travel so far he said that's the
[1:32:52] bible
[1:32:53] that's the word but you've got to
[1:32:58] shoot the gun
[1:33:02] you've got to let the attribute
[1:33:06] be pulled out of you
[1:33:14] that's why it's there
[1:33:18] that's why you find yourself
[1:33:21] the value of what gives something
[1:33:25] value is the test
[1:33:28] think it not strange of the testing of
[1:33:32] your faith
[1:33:34] it's more precious than gold
[1:33:38] to be in the circumstance
[1:33:41] in a situation where you're tempted
[1:33:44] where you're trapped where you're forced
[1:33:47] and you get stuck and and to be able
[1:33:51] to realize and and stop
[1:33:54] a moment
[1:33:58] and wait and let that
[1:34:02] attribute
[1:34:04] manifest to the circumstance
[1:34:08] that's what he's looking for then you
[1:34:11] become
[1:34:12] his victory father
[1:34:15] i've imparted myself in them
[1:34:21] father they respond the way i
[1:34:24] responded i've won the victory
[1:34:29] i've showed him my love i've given them
[1:34:33] my spirit
[1:34:35] i've put my mind in them
[1:34:39] that's what he came for
[1:34:43] that he could bring man and god
[1:34:47] back together in fellowship
[1:34:50] that god the threefold purpose right
[1:34:53] brother and that god could have
[1:34:55] the preeminence in other words
[1:34:58] god thinking would be
[1:35:02] in those who jesus redeemed
[1:35:05] if god's thinking isn't in you then he
[1:35:08] has not redeemed you
[1:35:16] but you say well it's not there all the
[1:35:19] time
[1:35:19] if it's there one time you start
[1:35:22] praising god
[1:35:24] hallelujah because it's like yeast
[1:35:28] right a little a little leaven
[1:35:32] leaveneth the whole lump a little bit of
[1:35:34] spirit
[1:35:35] will live in the whole body it'll liven
[1:35:37] the whole life
[1:35:38] it'll fill the whole soul it'll go to
[1:35:41] work on you those attributes will grow
[1:35:44] he'll tutor you and he'll raise you out
[1:35:46] and he'll bring you into his image
[1:35:48] amen so we are the victory
[1:35:52] of christ jesus the works that he does
[1:35:55] is not the miracles the miracles are the
[1:35:59] result of the attributes
[1:36:01] the the works was the projection
[1:36:04] and the expression of the attributes
[1:36:08] of god he said i'd rather have mercy
[1:36:14] than sacrifice oh
[1:36:17] church this is what we're heading to
[1:36:21] the statue of a perfect man the fruits
[1:36:24] of the spirit
[1:36:26] the the re the christ-like
[1:36:29] response in the circumstance
[1:36:33] that he has planned for us to be in
[1:36:41] everybody's against you oh everybody
[1:36:45] hates me
[1:36:45] nobody loves me i'm gonna go eat worms
[1:36:52] just stop a moment say he knows i'm here
[1:36:58] there's a deep calling for a deep
[1:37:02] there's a god that wants to express
[1:37:06] i was going to read the quote but i
[1:37:09] already
[1:37:10] said it that
[1:37:13] he said you are an expression
[1:37:16] god thought it now here you are
[1:37:20] you're here to do what to express
[1:37:24] him you're here to
[1:37:27] prove to this world that
[1:37:30] everything jesus said is true
[1:37:36] to prove that his sheep hear his voice
[1:37:40] and another they won't follow
[1:37:43] to prove that the works that i do and oh
[1:37:46] i wish i could lay that down
[1:37:48] everybody always thinks works is a
[1:37:51] carnal
[1:37:52] physical expression and the greater
[1:37:56] works
[1:37:57] is a spiritual love of god
[1:38:00] projected to create and change
[1:38:03] the atmosphere but anyway this is an
[1:38:06] eternal subject
[1:38:10] and just remember you are eternal people
[1:38:16] you can't take an eternal people
[1:38:19] and try to place them in time
[1:38:26] he's on the mercy seat he's not on the
[1:38:28] mercy seat
[1:38:29] we're here we're there no wonder he said
[1:38:32] times no more
[1:38:34] your eternal people and what is in
[1:38:38] eternity
[1:38:39] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:38:42] and that's god's life and god is his
[1:38:46] attributes expressed amen be the victory
[1:38:50] remember the circumstance the
[1:38:53] atmosphere is to draw out
[1:38:57] the attributes god's allowed this
[1:39:00] rotten stinking atmosphere
[1:39:04] so he can draw the real attributes
[1:39:08] of god out blind barmas
[1:39:12] drew that attribute out the woman at the
[1:39:14] well drew that atmosphere out
[1:39:16] the woman caught an adult he drew that
[1:39:18] atmosphere out zacharias drew that
[1:39:20] atmosphere out
[1:39:22] we could go down and down and down all
[1:39:24] those were drawn
[1:39:25] out of jesus because he's an expression
[1:39:28] now
[1:39:29] you are his expression because you and
[1:39:32] him has become one
[1:39:33] so think it not strange if you find
[1:39:37] yourself
[1:39:38] in all kinds of rotten
[1:39:42] atmosphere because the true bride
[1:39:45] masters every circumstance
[1:39:49] amen god bless you brother billy will
[1:39:53] come and
[1:39:54] close our service if he's here somewhere
[1:39:56] where are you hiding

[1:42:10] and we just trust the lord some of our
[1:42:16] believers are out of town we just pray
[1:42:17] that god makes them prosperous
[1:42:20] that they be in good health and yeah
[1:42:23] keep my mom in prayer you can tell that
[1:42:26] um
[1:42:28] this is the first time that i could say
[1:42:30] that i've
[1:42:31] seen her go go
[1:42:34] down a little bit and
[1:42:39] you know i i already know the prophet of
[1:42:42] god said he prepares you so
[1:42:46] i could tell it in the actions of her
[1:42:48] dog
[1:42:50] you know i knew something was up they
[1:42:53] they sensed things like that i don't
[1:42:55] know how long she'll be with me
[1:42:57] i hope a couple more years but
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:03] it's it's coming in and
[1:43:06] i believe god will have a place for her
[1:43:09] my dad was a rough guy but my dad was
[1:43:11] good to my family
[1:43:13] and in being good to me
[1:43:16] that goodness was able to help other
[1:43:18] believers through time
[1:43:20] my dad helped build my house for me many
[1:43:23] a person stayed and ate in my house
[1:43:26] i believe that will be attributed to the
[1:43:28] mercy
[1:43:29] that god shows upon my father he may not
[1:43:32] be in that
[1:43:34] city and he may not
[1:43:37] he may not be in the
[1:43:41] where the lamb is the light but
[1:43:45] there's people that live on the side of
[1:43:47] the mountain
[1:43:49] and they go pick the leaves off the tree
[1:43:52] and they walk into the city holding that
[1:43:57] leave up like a day pass like a passport
[1:44:01] and they can come in and out but the
[1:44:04] bride's going to dwell there forever
[1:44:07] amen that's where i i want to go
[1:44:11] let's just bow our head tonight
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:17] maybe we'd ask ourselves this evening
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:24] lord him
[1:44:29] am i meeting the circumstances of this
[1:44:33] hour
[1:44:36] with the attributes and works
[1:44:41] that you presented
[1:44:45] lord i ask tonight that you impart those
[1:44:48] attributes to me
[1:44:50] i'm not worried about the miracle
[1:44:53] the miracle will follow if i have the
[1:44:55] attribute
[1:44:57] every miracle was motivated by divine
[1:45:00] love
[1:45:03] and without the attribute we could do
[1:45:05] all kinds of works
[1:45:07] and he would just simply say i never
[1:45:09] knew you
[1:45:11] the father i i pray that the attributes
[1:45:14] of
[1:45:16] of mercy and faith and
[1:45:20] deliverance and healing
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:25] that those that's what flows from me
[1:45:28] father
[1:45:30] that i can be the expression
[1:45:33] because that's what you thought of me
[1:45:36] you could only think of me of what that
[1:45:40] you were
[1:45:42] like brother billy said you brooded over
[1:45:44] us so that we would come into your image
[1:45:47] and to be in your image we have to
[1:45:49] express
[1:45:51] the same works and attributes and
[1:45:53] thinking
[1:45:54] that you expressed may we not be
[1:45:57] discouraged
[1:45:58] at the darkness so as the darkness does
[1:46:02] is manifest
[1:46:03] the light and i pray father that each
[1:46:07] soul is stirred up to be christ-like
[1:46:11] let the love of god just be spread about
[1:46:15] in their heart by the holy spirit and
[1:46:18] may this
[1:46:19] town and this city meet little messiahs
[1:46:23] walking everywhere
[1:46:26] that the attributes of the mighty father
[1:46:29] of heaven
[1:46:30] would be poured out upon every
[1:46:32] circumstance
[1:46:35] whether received or not
[1:46:38] but the out tribute is there
[1:46:41] offering opportunity to whosoever will
[1:46:46] i ask you father
