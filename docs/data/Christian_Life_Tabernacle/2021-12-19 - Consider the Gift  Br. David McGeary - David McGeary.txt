Description:
Consider the Gift
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Evening Service: December 19, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

we recognize your coming into this world and father we know it's not really placed by man in its proper place we know it should be in the spring when the life is coming out of great wintry darkness and there's a springing forth and we just but man has taken this time and lord we want to hold your name in this season father that it's not totally blocked out and turned to total commercialism so father we stand here at this cease in recognizing you that you are the reason and we praise you and thank you for it we ask your blessings on the service now in jesus name we pray amen man god bless you may be seated this morning i was trying to see if i could this where's brother burly out is he with us tonight see where are you hiding brother you hiding somewhere you're not here brother where are you at oh well i was gonna have to say a few words so i guess i say a few words for him and anyway okay uh he must be resting uh just got back from africa and uh suffering with maybe some jet lag or some really wonderful uh romanian food so that could be a lot of reasons but we'll just go to the word of god then i was just looking forward to have a little uh the word of testimony or exhortation from them we we appreciate them so i thank you musicians didn't mean to keep you just a little a thought again tonight on this uh time of season and you know what kind of uh just stimulated my thought and it was uh you know this time being a year of gifts you know everybody wants to give a gift and we feel a lot of times obligated to give gifts because that we're going to receive a gift so you know our desire is that that we give a gift or we take this time to give a gift well i remember i decided one year that our car was pretty wore out and uh i wanted to get leslie uh a new car so i i got her a car it wasn't for christmas i believe it was for her birthday and so we we got a vehicle you know how it is like when you really need something you can use a date as a reason to kill two birds with one stone you know so we were gonna have to get a car anyway so we might as well get a car that acts as a gift you know and so we had the car for about two years i know i've told you this story before but well then i thought well what am i going to get leslie this year and i thought well what i'll do is i'll put remote start on her car you know and that'll be a blessing she could start it up in the parking lot before she goes out to it and she can start it up you know in the at home and get it all warmed up and i thought that'd just be a great gift so i i remember aaron was there and so i said aaron i said i want to put remote start on mom's car for for um this i don't know if it was christmas or something and he said well it's already got it it it came with the gift and a lot of times we don't realize everything that comes with the gift all that's included in a gift you know i i was listening to the radio and a commercial came on and it was for some sort of um bill app and it will it keeps track of all your bills and your prescriptions and subscriptions and you can cancel it at every time and i thought wow i'll get that app you know and then i thought well you know do i really want to buy an app that already knows what all my prescriptions and everything are and and they'll cancel them at any time and do all this stuff and then it kind of dawned on me it probably i have to probably load that stuff in there right and that ruins it you know it's like getting something you have to put together you know by the time you're done trying to put together you hope you never see it again you know so those those are the kind of things but you know we've got a gift that is pretty marvelous and uh so let's stand we just want to take not too many i didn't really have a lot of comments to make i was uh looking forward my brother to help me a little bit but it's okay so what we'll do is we'll just turn to uh matthew the second chapter and then over to matthew the fourth chapter and just uh read from the 14th verse there and just just have a little short time of fellowship and it says now when jesus was born in bethlehem matthew the second chapter now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him amen uh what an acknowledgement of the true king amen and then over here again in the fourth chapter we'll read in the 14th verse and it says that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by elias the prophet saying in the land of zebelon and the land of nephilim by the way of the sea behold beyond jordan galilee the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the regions and the shadows of death light is sprung up and from that time jesus began preaching and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand you may be seated you know what uh uh as as we uh talked this morning about the gift and as we've been reading out of the message that of god's provided place of worship we begin to see that how wonderful the gift of god truly is to us and what he gave us was it wasn't a history that he gave us but he gave us himself and he gave us his spirit now it's hard for us to believe that the same spirit that dwelt in the lord jesus can dwell in us because we have so what so much great conflict sometimes with ourselves as human beings because the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and and we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies and our very existence is is that man's days are numbered and there there are a few days with many trials and man isn't born with a life in him that can last and uh you know that is uh quite a sad thing you might say that uh that you're born but yet you start your life and you've got an allotted number of days to live that life and and you you wonder what what kind of world that you're born into and as you grow and as you have years on you you know uh we used to hear people talk about the good old days and and uh you you know uh if you're 8 9 10 12 years old or 15 or 16 years old what are the good old days to you when you didn't go to school you know i used to think in the fourth and fifth grade i flunk third grade i'm sorry to say that but i was the biggest kid in my class for one year and so i just said wow the good old days was when i i stayed home you know that was the good old days i didn't have to go to school i could get in trouble the only problem with the good old days was i got spanked a lot but you know but so everything is the good old days but you know there's nothing good about old days you know what i'm saying because all the day means is that you've lost one more of the days you have now wouldn't that be a sad thing to look at life like that that you just live a a season of time and then when you come to think of it that you're born into a world and and we look at this gift we have because as we said this morning the gift of god what he was really giving man whose days are numbered do you understand who's who's all's that he can he can have good times he can have seasons of joy he can have times of prosperity or and maybe periods of contentment but all in all all that he has to look forward to is to know that in time that his body is going to stoop it's going to begin to ache it's going to be easier to sit down than it is to get up food becomes less agreeable with you it has worse effects than it does good effects when you were young you eat and you got strong and now when you're older and you eat you get fatter and heartburn and indigestion and and everything else and you you know you get tired and and you know what what's the good old days you know and and and you look at this and you kind of sit in and you look at life and the more that you really look at what the gift of god is to you the the more you understand really what a wonderful thing that he gave us he gave us eternal life and the promise of a kingdom that wouldn't have any of the negativity in it that this kingdom has oh that that's that's wonderful amen you actually can look beyond the grave you can look beyond the 80 or 90 years that god gives you or maybe less maybe more we don't know but you have a hope that lies in something beyond the veil beyond your vision beyond your experience uh that something that's not affected by where you came in to the world whatever status you came in whatever opportunities were afforded to you every uh that you can sit back and you can say you know i i'm here in the circumstances that i'm in but i have something that's going to take me out of all these circumstances i have something i have a gift of god and that gift is life and it's life more abundantly it's it it's a life more prosperous and it's so when we look at this gift and the the as the we read the scriptures the scripture said that light sprung up and i thought this is such a beautiful description of the world it says the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the regions and shadows of death light sprung up and what a a a description of where man sat in the regions of darkness and and you know when you sit in the dark uh you could certainly say that you're lost and you have no direction because that's what light is for light allows you to see where you are and so there's light is kind of used for a lot of things light is used to see in the darkness and we refer to that as the light we have light and the light shineth in darkness can the darkness comprehendeth it not they couldn't they couldn't see what the light was showing but the gift of god has allowed you to see with the light and so the light has given you eyesight it's giving you eyesab that you may see and that's what we understand in the age that we're living and look at the world that we were born in again in the description of the world that we're born in powers and principalities and spiritual weakness wickedness in high places this this is the world that we're born in that perilous times would come men's conscience would be snared with a hot iron and people would become lovers of pleasure uh more than lovers of god they would be self-indulgent and self uh preserving and and you know uh when you're with a people that are self-preserving another word it becomes a me first i i always marvel at this time of year you'll hear of people getting in fights over in the stores parents over a doll or something you know i don't know i i guess uh i don't want to date myself too bad but i remember there was a this doll they called a cabbage patch doll you know just a piece of junk um and uh and uh and people were would go crazy because they had to get their kid a a cabbage patch doll no matter what it meant if it meant you had to have a smackdown in the aisle of walmart whatever it took you know you've got to get then i'm not condemning if you got a cabbage patch doll i they may be worth something now i don't know you know but people fought over pet rocks you know and i mean i had a whole yard full of pets you know so uh it it it kind of shows you the mentality of the world of darkness and and darkness is not just always an artificial darkness but it's a darkness when reality is hid from you where you really don't see the truth of the matter so light is given that one might find its way you know you turn on your flashlight so you can find the trail you turn on your headlights so you can see the road because you want to have light to see where you're going and to see what lies ahead and so we look at light as being something that provides us eyesight it provides us something to see the surroundings around us and the scripture said that those that sat in darkness saw great light and so it made them aware of the circumstances in the situation and the conditions that you're sitting in and and i would say it like this can you imagine sitting in a dark room and you really don't know what's in that room you don't know what's in there you don't know if there's cockroaches in there you don't know if there's spiders in there you don't know if there's snakes in there you're just sitting in a room and you have no idea what is surrounding you and someone's going to all of a sudden turn on the light and let you see what it is that you're sitting in now if there were all those things in that room and all of a sudden you realized you were sitting in a place that had bugs and snakes and spiders and again all kinds of creepy and and and crawling things i i wonder if the light would cause you to make exit it would be because of the light that you would say i don't want to sit in a place that's dark i i want to come from this darkness that i'm in that when men saw light they saw hope they saw something that they'd never seen before their surroundings and their condition and and what they were what they never saw before now they were able to see it because this great light that sprung up to that that it said that that they they those that sat in the regions that sat in the regions and the shadows of death that's the condition that they were in and like i said the world we're born in is a world that is full of powers and principalities in spiritual wickedness in high places and it's perilous times with great deception okay and so you're born in it and and you don't know where it's taking you or where it's going or what they have up their sleeve or what they're trying to do a lot of this whole idea behind the resistance and different people that that uh uh don't want to uh they they don't trust uh the government if and what what are they up to with this vaccine you know why do they why does it mostly affect the elderly and people that have uh some sort of conditions that are going to cost a a continuous a lot of money uh what was there a suspicion that they were trying to take a certain segment eliminate a great portion of the segment of society and they did half a million people i believe and i don't know you know there's a lot of questions a young young women that would like to raise families does this have an effect and nobody can answer that question so suspicions arise and and you don't have an answer to what is there you know you you know that they take money out of your check every hour that you work they pluck a little bit of money that you earned and after you might go get a job and and they say you uh you made 10 15 dollars an hour but you really find out you're only going to take home ten of that and they've taken five dollars of every hour you work they've taken that from you i recall the time that i got a raise and i got a raise i was real happy about getting a raise until i found out my take-home pay was less than it was before i went in i said i don't want to raise because i know what it's like to live hand to mouth i know what it's like to sit down with the paycheck and save five dollars for this five dollars for that so much for rent we can buy so much food and oh my goodness we'll really splurge on next wednesday night we'll have grilled cheese and tomato soup for supper you know and and you you uh you you rejoice in what you have and i went and said i don't want this race because i'm taking home less and and so you answer what what are they doing with all that money and then you find out they're supporting things that you don't believe in you understand so we're living in a time and that's something else that light does it doesn't always let you know but light sometimes gives you to uh the ability to realize what's happening behind the scene or you could you know you might say well i got some light shed on this situation and then i finally understood what was really happening what was really going on i really saw what they were up to oh now i know it's like a light bulb comes on and says oh now i know what they're up to you know you begin to see what what it is so light the gift that god paid this was light and i wanted to bring this little thought in and then i'll close up this evening and like i said but you know the gift of god was the lord jesus we know that and he said in saint john 14 6 he said i am the way the truth the life and no man cometh to the father but by me so we know we lie in a great time of darkness and we know that jesus was the light of the world and it he's become to us in the time that we live in a great guide and so many times we only look at the baptism of the holy spirit as an experience or as something that fixes the past our lives are messed up we make bad decisions things that we can't un do and and the holy spirit comes and and and we feel the forgiveness now the holy spirit is none other than jesus christ returned back to the believer in spirit form it's the same spirit that he had where he had it in fullness and and and many uh the aspects of it were unlimited in him god gave each of us a measure of that same spirit but we know if i have one cup of ocean i have everything that's in the ocean in that one cup even though i don't have all of the ocean but i'm connected to that ocean i am a part of that ocean and that ocean can flow through me can in me and we look so many times as the the god the gift of the holy spirit as god coming down and showing us the darkness that we're in and we see the darkness around us and we're so grateful that we've got eyes that we might see and and we rejoice that we can come out of the darkness because the light's been shined on and we begin to see what the effect of that darkness is on our life and we see the mistakes we've made and we see the condition that we're in and so many times we just look at the holy spirit of something as something that fixes the past and and that's like having a gift that you don't really realize all that's in it you know and that's part of the gift part of the gift was to see that that our eyes were opened by the preaching of god's word and we we saw that the end of this world is destruction and we found ourselves as being self-destructive i'm killing myself you know what i mean i can't go on like this and and the spirit of god come by our way and and gave us life after eternal life but i i want to say this in in closing there's something else about the gift that god gave us and that gift is it's a leader and i think that's the part of the spirit of god that sometimes is used the least we use it to worship we use it for the atmosphere that it creates we use it for stimulation we use it for uplifting kind of like a spiritual energy drink you know we go to the spirit we get in the spirit and in the spirit the cares of our life goes away in the spirit we feel comfortable that i i'm i'm not in darkness because i'm in the spirit and everything that happens so much about this wonderful gift that god's given us is is that we use it for the moment we use it for the atmosphere that it creates we use it for the problems that we've that has arisen in our lives we use it many times to to navigate the the current uh situation but this gift that god has given us can direct us in the future a lot of times we don't realize we come to quick conclusions and quick decisions and we've never let really laid it out before the gift that god has given us to allow us to look down the road and to see the results of the path that we're on so that we can make the changes and adjustments and and be prepared you know we leave that whole wonderful part of the leadership okay in other words the holy spirit's more than a band-aid it's more than a joyful stimulus you know it's like having something in the gift that's never used and that's one of the things that he told us in this day says i'll give you i salve that thou mayest see and and a great uh the great spirit knows the beginning from the end it can look down the road okay it can you know it's like something that uh is there but you've never you've never used it how do i do it you know can we sit and aaron showed us how to press the button on the car can we go someplace and sit out in the parking lot trying to remember which buttons to pass you know and the car would be flashing and beeping and the horn would be going off and everything because it was you had to press this person and that first there there there was a way to do it but we knew it was there we knew it was part of the gift we come to the understanding that there was things that this vehicle could do that we never took the time to find out about and and and the reason i'm saying this because it you never appreciate something or or are thankful for it to the extent that it could really uh be honored for if you don't really know all the ability that it has you know it's like having an oven and you didn't know you can set the timer and have it come on all you knew is you turned it to 350 and you wait till the dinger went off and you stuck it in there how many times you rushed home to stick the meal in there on time so it would be done and then one day you come to find out hey i could put that in there before i leave i can set the clock i can stay and visit and when i come home it'll be done just when i want it to do all of a sudden you like that oven a whole lot more than you did before can boy you're just rejoicing over that and then you find out that crazy thing has an app it can tell your phone what the temperature is of the food that's inside of it and he's wow this is really great and you begin to find out that there's more to it and there's more to it and there's more to it can it unfolds to you and i think so many times we stop with the holy spirit can the spirit of god and we think well i'm saved i have eternal life my past has been fixed he comforts me because he said he wouldn't leave me comfortless and i stopped there i'm satisfied with that and yet there's so much more to the gift that god give us eternal life is just the beginning but to be able to discern uh good and evil to be able to know what someone has need of the move you and to lead you and to guide you into all truth and righteousness we feel like we've obtained righteousness we have the gift but we leave the leadership of this marvelous gift that can actually show us what lies ahead i will show you things to come i'll warn you i'll i'll be with you even in you tell the wind i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll lead you and guides you in all truth and righteousness to let the spirit of god lead us and guide us and shine light on the path that lies before you i'll walk through the shadow of the valley of death yet i will fear no evil because thy rod and thy staff it comforteth me it leadeth me beside the still waters the holy spirit's kind of become like i said it's more reviewed as an experience or a fixer instead of a leader and a guider okay if you you want something and you know that god is going to give you your heart's desire you don't just have to sit there and hope that it it comes along or accept what comes along the spirit of god the gift that god gave you it's in the gift that he gave you can can can make the path to what your heart's desire is he can lay the path before you and he can guide your footsteps because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord he'll bring you to the place of your heart's desire he'll guide you down the way it's a guide it's a leader it's something that said that i'm going to come and lead you through this dark world that can get you to the place of your heart's desire so many times we just treat the treat the holy spirit and preach the holy spirit like it's detergent all this going to do is wash your dirty clothes you need the holy spirit you need to get cleaned up you need the spirit of god it's going to fix you and wash you you know wouldn't it be wonderful if we could really understand the spirit of god and say you need the holy spirit because the spirit of god will lead you out of the trouble to that your hand it'll show you the decisions that you need to make it'll you know it'll it it'll not only uh reprove you of sin and convict you of sin but it'll it'll enlighten your understanding that that you can you can see i believe you can see the future by god's word i believe the holy spirit is from the beginning to the end it's a great leader and and we're talking about this great season that we're living in this great christmas wonderful christmas time and and we know that light has sprung up a light that allows you to realize the way the truth and the life and that we can come in to the kingdom of god and we can see the kingdom of god we can see the benefits in the kingdom of god we can see the righteousness of the kingdom of god ask yourself do you really in your heart have a understanding of righteousness what it means to be righteous what it means to be kind what the benefits are to you of righteousness what the benefits we listed it this morning the the the wonderful fruits of of the spirit the the the great gifts of the spirit because do you have you ever took time in appreciation of what it is that you would say what does this do in other words why did this person give this to me in fact why did he pay such a high price that i could have this because he knew so much that i needed that that i need these things what will these things do what are they there for what will they lead me to what will they do to me what are the effect of what wow what the heck what what happens to when love changes your life you know how wonderful it is to be free from bitterness bitterness defiles many it's 11. that ruins the whole life if that bitterness is a curse of old age you don't get old in god you only get younger hallelujah oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory i've ran the race i fought the fight i wait for the crown that's laid up for me can all this great gift that god has given us can can change the world around us what temperance does for you what peace does for you what long suffering does for you you know i i hate being impatient you know i hate it if someone's gonna get there before me you know wonderful just to be able to sit back oh go ahead hey while you're there order me something you're long suffering and the many other ways and definitions you can give it when you when and i'm just talking about exploring what is in this gift of life that god's given or have we just accepted one aspect of it and the very possession of it alone well i had someone that gave me a a nice laptop they also gave me a promise to set it up for me and teach me how to use it and until they fulfill that part of the promise i've only got a big slab of metal that when i open it up it looks at me about the only thing i can do with it now is shave well god didn't give you the spirit he wants to show you all that's in it all that's in the gift are are you if i i don't have a better
