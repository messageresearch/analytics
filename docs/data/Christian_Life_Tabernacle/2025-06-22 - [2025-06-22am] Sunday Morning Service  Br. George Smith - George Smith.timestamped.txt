[25:45] [Applause]
[26:11] God bless you. Look like it's my
[26:13] family's turn to sing to God today.
[26:16] Um,
[26:18] pardon me. I'll say something before I
[26:20] go on. Um, couple weeks ago, I was with
[26:23] brother Amos. He's also a church member.
[26:26] He had uh his father passed. So, the
[26:29] family went to uh just be with him. And
[26:32] um he had a couple friends with him um
[26:35] that were not um believe in the message
[26:38] and they were in his place. And thank
[26:41] God we started talking about the word
[26:43] and so the message came up and I started
[26:46] talking to them about the message and uh
[26:49] they they were receiving it and they
[26:52] were astonished by what I was saying but
[26:56] then it got to the point where I talked
[26:58] about uh God's election particularly
[27:01] about you know serpent seed and you know
[27:04] there's just just some dedicated people
[27:07] that just God has just chosen. Oh my
[27:10] god, they went off. They were they they
[27:14] just cannot understand it. And you know,
[27:16] we kept on go back and forth, you know,
[27:19] until my family members are like, they
[27:21] can understand. Maybe you should pull
[27:23] back and not talk so much about it. But
[27:25] I still wanted to share it to them
[27:27] regardless. And so I told them about it.
[27:30] They were confused. They told me that
[27:32] can never be so. No, there's What do you
[27:35] mean? There are some people that are
[27:37] just made for for doom. There some
[27:40] people are just, you know, it's already
[27:43] allotted to them. Um, I kept on talking
[27:45] about predestination, but that's the way
[27:47] they understand it. And so when I left,
[27:50] I've just been pondering why didn't they
[27:53] I understand why they didn't understand
[27:55] it. But I think the deeper uh way that I
[27:59] started thinking about it, okay, why did
[28:01] I understand it? I mean, it it looked
[28:03] simple. Um so but why did high
[28:06] understand it? Um and so I started
[28:09] thinking it it it really disturbs me
[28:11] disturbed me a lot. And then I remember
[28:14] uh growing up during family altar my
[28:17] mama would always talk about uh this
[28:19] this verse in the Bible and and I would
[28:22] read it and um this is Exodus I'll go to
[28:25] 19. uh when God was talking to Moses and
[28:30] Exodus 33:19 and he said, "I will make
[28:34] all my goodness pass before thee and I
[28:38] will proa proclaim the name of the Lord
[28:40] before thee and will be gracious to whom
[28:44] I will be gracious and will show mercy
[28:47] on whom I will show mercy." uh when I
[28:50] just kept I kept remembering that all
[28:53] every time like I would be merciful to
[28:55] those that I would be merciful on and
[28:57] the only thing that I could think of is
[29:00] he he just had mercy on me even if I I
[29:03] didn't know how it came about I just
[29:05] understand it. I just knew just
[29:08] listening being under the ministry of
[29:10] this church of our pastor I just I I
[29:14] came to the realization that I'm not
[29:16] made for damnation. I'm made to be in
[29:18] heaven. I'm made as a child of God. I
[29:21] might have fault and I'm walking every
[29:23] single day, but I'm his choosing seed.
[29:27] And so the other piece of that pu uh
[29:30] that I'll be singing today is uh I want
[29:33] God's way.
[29:36] And I'm just going to sing it somehow.
[29:40] I want God's way
[29:43] to be my way
[29:46] as I journey
[29:49] below.
[29:51] For there is no
[29:55] other highway
[29:58] that the child of God should go.
[30:03] Though the road be
[30:07] steep and rough,
[30:09] if he leads me,
[30:12] it's enough.
[30:15] I want God's way
[30:18] to be my way
[30:22] every day.
[30:27] And I want God's way
[30:30] to be my way
[30:33] as I journey
[30:37] below.
[30:39] For there is no
[30:43] other highway
[30:46] that the child of God should go.
[30:52] Though the road be
[30:55] steep and rough,
[30:58] if he leads me,
[31:01] it's enough.
[31:04] I want God's way
[31:07] to be my way
[31:11] every day.
[31:16] And I want God's way
[31:20] to be my way
[31:23] as I journal.
[31:29] For there is no
[31:32] other highway
[31:35] that the child of God should go.
[31:40] Though the road be
[31:44] steep and rough,
[31:46] if he leads me,
[31:50] it's enough.
[31:52] I want God's way
[31:55] to be my way
[31:59] every day.
[32:03] And though the road be
[32:07] steep and rough,
[32:09] if he leads me,

[33:27] to be our way, not our own way, but we
[33:29] want to choose what he has in store for
[33:31] us. Man, we have a couple announcements
[33:33] to make. And uh just a reminder from the
[33:36] deacons. Uh please make sure not to use
[33:39] the hallway when service is started
[33:41] especially uh during preaching because

[34:37] you." Happy birthday, Sister Clarice.
[34:39] God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[34:44] Amen. I know also this weekend it was
[34:47] Sister Angela Villa's birthday. So, God
[34:49] bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord for
[34:52] that.
[34:56] Amen. There's another one. Please pray
[34:58] for the healing in the body of brother
[35:01] Fernando. Uh he's in the hospital with
[35:03] liver concern. Amen. We know we serve a
[35:06] living God, the healer of all our
[35:08] diseases. We could certainly take that
[35:10] to him this morning and be comforted
[35:12] that he will answer to the needs of our
[35:14] prayer. Uh Sister Rachel Bernette,
[35:16] right? Please pray that we may find uh
[35:20] uh keys or lost them while shopping
[35:22] Friday. Amen. We do just pray that the
[35:25] Lord will uh make a way that they may
[35:27] find the keys. Amen. I was talking to
[35:29] brother a Gary earlier on. So they have
[35:31] the car keys, the house keys, and all
[35:33] kinds of keys on that. We pray that the
[35:35] Lord will help with that. Amen. If you
[35:37] have a need upon your heart this
[35:39] morning. Amen. I trust you can know this
[35:41] morning that you are in the house of the
[35:43] living God. Amen. He's here to make his
[35:45] word a reality to the believers. Amen.
[35:48] Amen. The brothers that are taking the
[35:49] offering, see if it could come. Amen.
[35:51] and brother Tim Sal if you could just
[35:53] come and take this knees before the
[35:54] church.
[36:00] [Music]
[36:05] Many things we have need of.
[36:10] Just want to voice my appreciation for
[36:13] uh the service we had on Wednesday.
[36:17] If you haven't heard it or seen it, you
[36:20] might want to go back and listen to it.
[36:24] Brother David did a a fine job.
[36:33] And brother Brown taught us the way up
[36:35] is down.
[36:39] You know, there's a humility
[36:43] comes with the presence of God.
[36:47] [Music]
[36:49] And Isaiah
[36:51] askked a couple questions
[36:55] very pertinent.
[36:57] Says to whom then will ye liken God.
[37:03] Or what likeness will ye compare unto
[37:06] him?
[37:09] The very creator of heaven and earth is
[37:12] who we're about to talk to.
[37:16] And we bring these knees before him.
[37:21] Even lost keys,
[37:26] loved ones on their deathbed, some in
[37:29] the hospital, stroke victims that have
[37:31] recovered or recovering.
[37:34] He knows all these things. Let's pour
[37:37] out our heart to him, but do it in a way
[37:39] that we recognize who he is.
[37:44] and how little we are.
[37:48] But we're instructed to come boldly to
[37:50] the throne of grace.
[37:52] As our brother said,
[37:55] it's not our choosing,
[37:58] but it's who we are. Let's just bow our
[38:00] heads.
[38:02] Oh Lord, we thank you
[38:05] that we're even able to call you father.
[38:11] Lord, you've instructed us. You've led
[38:13] us. You've taught us.
[38:16] Lord, you've provided for us.
[38:20] Lord, we want to hold to that way,
[38:23] that highway that he sang about, Lord.
[38:26] There is no other way. You are the door
[38:29] to the sheepfold.
[38:31] We're thankful, Lord, that we
[38:34] recognize it and it's been provided for
[38:36] us. We ask Lord that all these things
[38:38] have been mentioned. Lord, the the
[38:41] hidden secrets of the heart that have
[38:43] been expressed to you by the upraised
[38:46] hands.
[38:48] Lord, there's many things we have need
[38:50] of in this life. But more than anything,
[38:52] Lord, we need to draw closer to you to
[38:56] be found
[38:58] in your word, Lord.
[39:01] The benefits
[39:04] Lord of a true and living God expressed
[39:06] in our lives can overcome anything this
[39:10] world can put against us. Lord our
[39:12] prophet said the right mental attitude
[39:16] toward any divine promise of God will
[39:19] bring it to pass. So Lord, it's your
[39:22] word that we seek, that we recognize,
[39:24] and we know Lord, when it comes forth,
[39:28] the spirit within us,
[39:30] Lord, it recognizes and says amen to it.
[39:33] That quickening power is available to
[39:35] us, Lord.
[39:37] For you've given it to us. We claim it.
[39:39] We believe it. Increase our faith, Lord,
[39:42] that we might have what we ask for.
[39:45] Amen. Lord, that when we leave this
[39:47] place that each one of us can know
[39:50] firmly within ourselves, Lord, that
[39:53] you've been our midst and you've drawn
[39:55] us closer to you for having been in this
[39:57] little simple service. Grant it to us
[40:00] now as we lean on you once again, Lord.
[40:05] Ask that you just bless the tithes and
[40:07] offerings, Lord. Use it for your honor
[40:09] and glory.
[40:12] And Lord, may each one that's in the
[40:14] divine presence, Lord, whether they have
[40:18] been there or not, Lord, may they
[40:19] recognize Yes.
[40:22] how truly, Lord, how great you are. Yes.
[40:26] [Music]
[40:28] And how you you want to bless us more
[40:30] than we want your blessing, Lord, that
[40:33] there won't be a one lost. Grant it to
[40:35] us now, Lord, as we ask all these things
[40:38] in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[40:40] Christ. Amen.
[40:45] Oh, and the blood
[40:49] that Jesus
[40:53] shed
[40:54] for me.
[40:57] [Music]
[41:00] Oh, way back on Calary.
[41:07] [Music]
[41:08] Oh, and the blood
[41:11] that gives me strength
[41:14] from day

[41:19] Oh, it will never.
[41:29] Oh,
[41:30] when he reaches
[41:33] to the highest
[41:36] mountain.

[41:52] Oh, and the blood. Hallelujah.
[41:58] Oh, from there
[42:00] to heaven.
[42:03] Oh, he will never
[42:07] lose
[42:09] his mind.
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] Oh, at it
[42:18] my darling
[42:23] my
[42:29] height
[42:34] mighty.
[42:36] Oh, and the cloud
[42:39] that gives me strength.
[42:42] Oh, from day
[42:45] to day.
[42:48] Oh, we will never
[42:52] lose
[42:54] his power.
[42:57] Oh,
[43:00] he reaches
[43:02] to the highest
[43:05] mountain.
[43:08] Oh
[43:11] flow
[43:13] to the lowest
[43:16] valley.
[43:21] Oh and the blood. Halleluah.
[43:26] Oh from day to day.
[43:32] Oh we will never
[43:36] sing our course again.
[43:41] Oh,
[43:43] for he reaches
[43:46] through the highest
[43:49] mountain.
[43:52] Oh,
[43:54] and it flow
[43:57] through the Lord.
[44:02] [Music]
[44:06] The blood
[44:07] that gives me strength
[44:10] from pain
[44:13] to the
[44:16] he will never
[44:19] lose
[44:21] his
[44:24] hallelu
[44:27] [Music]
[44:32] that is flowing.
[44:35] Oh, and from world.
[44:38] [Music]
[44:40] Oh, called calary.
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] Oh, and
[44:49] hallelujah.
[44:50] King is
[44:53] Oh, and there is joy
[44:59] and victory.
[45:03] Oh,
[45:12] all
[45:14] is
[45:15] [Music]
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:19] [Music]
[45:22] Oh,
[45:26] [Music]
[45:32] He will rock. He will wash you right
[45:39] [Music]
[45:41] from
[45:44] just think about it this morning.
[45:48] Oh, and angels came
[45:57] fly.
[45:59] Oh, by this mountain
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:06] for me.
[46:08] Oh
[46:14] sh.
[46:17] [Applause]
[46:20] [Music]
[46:45] Oh, anywhere
[46:50] you are.
[46:55] Hallelujah.
[46:57] Hallelu.
[46:59] Let's all stand at this time. Amen. As
[47:02] we invite brother David out, let's sing.
[47:04] I have a father. He knows my name. Amen.
[47:11] I have
[47:13] a mold
[47:16] [Music]
[47:20] my heart
[47:25] and before even time began. Oh, and my
[47:32] life was in his hand.
[47:36] [Music]
[47:39] He knows my name.
[47:46] He knows my every thought.
[47:53] He sees each tear that falls. Oh, and
[47:59] hear me when I call.
[48:06] Oh, and I have a father. Aren't you glad
[48:11] you have a father this morning? Oh, he
[48:14] calls me so.
[48:20] Oh, and will never.
[48:25] Oh, and no matter where I go,
[48:34] he knows my name.
[48:41] He knows my every thought.
[48:48] He sees a cheer that far
[48:53] and he hears me.
[48:58] Our gracious father, we call once again
[49:02] on you this morning
[49:05] because we're a needy people.
[49:08] But Father, not only are we a needy
[49:10] people, we're a thankful people
[49:13] because you promise to provide our every
[49:16] need. You promise to hear our prayer.
[49:20] Father, you know what we have need of
[49:22] even before that we ask. And Father,
[49:26] you're a great provider. You've made the
[49:28] provisions
[49:30] and you've provided for us all that we
[49:32] have need of. Father, may we just
[49:34] surrender ourselves to your will.
[49:38] May we incline our ear to hear your
[49:42] voice.
[49:44] May we prepare our hearts, Father, to do
[49:46] all that we need to do to be obedient to
[49:50] thy will.
[49:52] We ask you to bless us this morning, the
[49:54] people this morning. Father, may they
[49:57] know that you love them. May they know
[50:00] that you laid your life down for them
[50:02] that they could be free from any
[50:04] bondage,
[50:06] all sin, and every hindrance that would
[50:08] keep them from going further in you. Be
[50:12] with us this morning. Father, we invite
[50:14] you with humble hearts. We're unworthy
[50:18] for your presence, but we ask that your
[50:21] mercy and goodness would grant it to us,
[50:24] Father, because we're so needy of you.
[50:27] bless the people we pray in the
[50:29] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:32] we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you
[50:36] this morning. I had a wonderful
[50:38] vacation. In fact, I'm now recovering
[50:41] from vacation.
[50:43] So, somebody told me it's a good
[50:46] vacation when you have to recover from
[50:48] it. So, we had a wonderful time. We
[50:51] caught lots and lots and lots and lots
[50:54] and lots and lots and lots of fish and
[51:00] that's what we went there to do. And you
[51:03] know, so we just had a great time. I
[51:05] want to thank all the musicians, the
[51:08] brothers that preached and all for you
[51:11] for carrying on and and I did make it
[51:14] back before September,
[51:16] but I didn't say I would preach again
[51:19] before September. So we no I will but we
[51:23] have blessed to have brother George with
[51:25] us this morning and and uh I'm so
[51:29] grateful that he's here to share with us
[51:32] the word of God. He's our friend. He's a
[51:35] friend of our church. We love him and we
[51:37] know him. And so there's one rule with
[51:40] brother George. Don't fall asleep
[51:43] cuz he'll
[51:46] he'll come down and whack you on the
[51:48] head with the Bible. So, you're all
[51:51] alert this morning, all ready for the
[51:54] word of God. Amen. I will I'll just turn
[51:58] the service over to brother George. Let
[52:01] him take it from here. We have a saying
[52:03] that we always say, without fear,
[52:06] without favor. Amen. God bless you.
[52:09] Thank you, brother David. It's good to
[52:10] be here this morning. Good to see all of
[52:13] you.
[52:14] Some I don't know, but God knows you and
[52:18] he knows how to provide your needs cuz
[52:21] he's our father. Amen. And aren't you
[52:24] glad that God is a God of variety? Yes,
[52:27] he is. Now, you're all looking at one
[52:29] person, but I'm looking at the variety.
[52:31] God is indeed the God of variety. So,
[52:34] we've prayed and so we're going to look
[52:37] into the word of God this morning. And
[52:39] yes, we're still in the book of Acts
[52:41] because I know some of you haven't been
[52:42] reading it.
[52:44] So,
[52:46] we're going to go into um
[52:49] chapter 13
[52:51] of the book of Acts.
[52:53] And uh let's just pray before we do
[52:55] that. Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[52:56] your mercy today. We thank you, Lord,
[52:59] that you've given us the will to be here
[53:01] and the strength and the car to drive
[53:03] and all that you've given us. We thank
[53:05] you. Lord, bless your your word to your
[53:09] people. May it be something that would
[53:11] hit the need of each one. I don't live
[53:14] here. I don't know what their needs are,
[53:15] but you do. You're our heavenly father.
[53:18] You not only know our needs, you know
[53:20] our name. You know our future. And we
[53:23] put it all in your hands. Help us now in
[53:26] Jesus name. Amen. Okay. You may be
[53:29] seated.
[53:35] Okay.
[53:37] Okay.
[53:39] So, um, I always look forward to being
[53:43] with Brother David. I've known him for
[53:45] half of his life.
[53:49] Yeah. A long time. But, you know,
[53:51] there's a lot of unrest in the world
[53:52] today. You're aware of what's going on.
[53:56] It's because people don't read the
[53:59] Bible.
[54:01] Our God is a God of balance.
[54:05] And I've been over in those areas of the
[54:08] Middle East many times.
[54:10] And it's unbelievable how that people
[54:12] cannot get with the program and just
[54:16] follow God's rules. They won't because
[54:19] they're born, they're anointed for
[54:21] destruction
[54:23] from the little bitty kids. They teach
[54:26] them to hate the Jews. If you can kill a
[54:28] couple of Jews, you got your way paved
[54:30] to heaven. It's foolish. So, it is a
[54:33] matter of staying balanced. Yes, I
[54:36] brought the thought.
[54:39] You'd be disappointed if I didn't bring
[54:40] it right.
[54:42] But, um, no, God being a God of variety,
[54:45] he knows what we need. And, um, the, uh,
[54:51] the scripture says in the book of
[54:53] Genesis, I will bless those that bless
[54:56] thee, my people Israel. Oh, blessing.
[55:00] But I will curse those that curse thee.
[55:04] Now, I've been over there and I've I've
[55:06] seen all this and I thought, well, you
[55:07] know, if I was a if I was an Arab and I
[55:10] believe that the destruction of the Jews
[55:12] was the way to heaven and it hasn't
[55:14] worked out too good so far.
[55:17] I think I would pretend
[55:20] for 6 months, let's see if that really
[55:22] works. Let's be nice to them. See if God
[55:24] blesses. And that's not rocket science,
[55:27] you know, but no, they're they're
[55:29] anointed for what they do. Just like all
[55:32] the churches you came by to get here
[55:33] this morning, they're anointed for what
[55:36] they're doing. It's the broadest way to
[55:39] destruction. See, most people in the
[55:43] world today are going to the hot place.
[55:46] Only a few are going to go the other
[55:47] way. So, be sure that you know where you
[55:49] are. And we trust that God will speak to
[55:52] you some way today
[55:55] that
[55:57] tomorrow will be an easier way that you
[55:59] can be sure that you're in the right
[56:00] place.
[56:02] And I know that we're speaking to at
[56:04] least three uh languages here and it's
[56:07] going out.
[56:08] We're just thankful that God has called
[56:10] us.
[56:12] Now, after today, I'm on my way to
[56:14] Central America. I'm going to be in
[56:16] Honduras for two weeks.
[56:19] And um I didn't bring a Spanish Bible,
[56:21] but they have them down there. I can use
[56:24] their Bible. And these are places I
[56:26] haven't been in over 30 years, but
[56:28] they've been listening and they've been
[56:30] listening and churches are growing. Just
[56:32] in the one country of Honduras, there's
[56:34] probably 120 churches because they don't
[56:37] have the transportation we have. So
[56:39] there's a church here and 10 miles
[56:40] farther and 20 miles farther because,
[56:42] you know, they can't get around as
[56:44] quickly as we can. So we're not going to
[56:46] go to all those churches. We're going to
[56:47] go to several places, but just to
[56:50] encourage the saints and let them know
[56:52] that the gospel is still real. So, in
[56:55] the chapter 13,
[56:57] um, we've studied in the past up through
[57:00] these 12 chapters, we've studied some of
[57:02] the growth, some of the difficulties of
[57:04] the early church. It didn't start out
[57:06] like it is today. They didn't have a
[57:08] church like this. No, they met in homes.
[57:11] They met under down by the river down
[57:13] some trees. And um that was our church
[57:16] at its inception. And now we have been
[57:18] restored back to the original
[57:21] all the way not just to the book of
[57:23] Acts, but all the way back to Eden. We
[57:25] have a message of restoration to put it
[57:28] back the way it's supposed to be. You
[57:29] know, and you see God's map is all on
[57:32] one page. He doesn't have to fumble
[57:34] through the pages and wonder how we're
[57:36] going to get this done and hope this
[57:37] works. No, it's all on one page. He can
[57:39] see the entire picture. and all that's
[57:42] going on in the Middle East right now,
[57:43] it's not a surprise to God. He knows
[57:46] exactly, you know, how it's working out.
[57:50] So Paul, you know, being God's voice of
[57:53] the first church age
[57:55] and then God's voice to our age, uh it's
[57:58] the same quality of inspired word. It's
[58:02] the same revelation of Jesus Christ.
[58:05] When they tried to worship Paul, that
[58:08] didn't work. And today when people try
[58:09] to worship William Brandham, it doesn't
[58:11] work. It's just showing that Catholic
[58:13] spirit that's down inside a lot of
[58:15] people, you know. So we have the same
[58:18] word, the same Bible doctrine. And these
[58:21] people we've studied and we're going to
[58:22] look at today. We're going to see them
[58:23] very soon. This thing is just about to
[58:26] blow up.
[58:28] And I'm not a politician, but you see
[58:31] the same news I do. And the president
[58:33] said, "Well, within the next two weeks,
[58:35] I'm going to decide." So everybody's
[58:37] looking at two weeks.
[58:39] Boom. It happened. And that's the way
[58:41] it's going to happen with us. There's no
[58:43] specific date out there. I'm going to
[58:45] come get you at this date. Because if
[58:46] God gave that date, what would you be
[58:49] doing? You wouldn't be here. You'd be at
[58:52] the beach. You'd be running up the
[58:54] credit card because you're not going to
[58:55] be here to pay it. No, that's not the
[58:57] way it works. We got to stay in balance.
[59:00] Okay. So, that's why we're here today to
[59:03] get ready to be sure everything is lined
[59:06] up properly.
[59:08] So our brothers and sisters here in the
[59:10] book of Acts, they came through many
[59:11] serious trials,
[59:13] serious persecutions. They had
[59:16] encounters with the law. Some went to
[59:18] jail. Some went to untimely death. And
[59:22] you know, Jerusalem is where it all
[59:24] started. We have that, you know, in
[59:26] chapter 2.
[59:29] And there have been annual pilgrimages
[59:31] to the upper room. Some of you have been
[59:33] there. And um it it's always a very
[59:37] important step in the Christian walk to
[59:38] go back and see where it all started.
[59:40] You know, and even till recently they
[59:43] come from all over the world. Tourism is
[59:46] the number one income to Israel.
[59:49] We went last in July of 23 and at that
[59:53] point there was 4 million people coming
[59:56] as tourists every year. Today there's
[59:59] nothing. The airport's closed.
[1:00:02] But you know it was in Antioch
[1:00:05] uh which became the center of early
[1:00:07] Christianity. Now that's up in what's
[1:00:10] Turkey today. And at the time of Acts
[1:00:12] 13,
[1:00:14] Antioch could have been a city of maybe
[1:00:16] a half a million people. And it was
[1:00:18] divided into four ethnic groups. Okay?
[1:00:20] They had walls. There was the Greeks,
[1:00:23] the Syrians, Africans, and the Jews. But
[1:00:25] the gospel goes beyond the walls, you
[1:00:28] know, and it brings people together in
[1:00:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:00:33] Now, today, Christianity is all divided
[1:00:35] up. We got the Catholic, we got the
[1:00:37] Presbyterian, we got the Baptist. All
[1:00:39] these people using the same Bible.
[1:00:41] Something's wrong someplace. But we are
[1:00:44] the people of the book. We're back to
[1:00:46] the original. And so, one of my favorite
[1:00:48] chapters is Ephesians 4. There's one
[1:00:50] body, one spirit. Even as you are called
[1:00:54] in one hope of your calling. It's all
[1:00:56] about the unity. One Lord, one faith,
[1:00:59] one baptism, one God and father over
[1:01:01] all. Uh who is above all, through all
[1:01:04] and in you all. But into every one of us
[1:01:06] is given grace according to the measure
[1:01:08] of the gift of Christ. It all comes back
[1:01:11] to Jesus Christ. Not to me, not to
[1:01:14] David, not to William Brandon. Okay. So
[1:01:18] chapter 13 verse one. Now there were in
[1:01:20] the church that was at Antioch certain
[1:01:23] prophets and teachers as Barnabas and
[1:01:26] Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius
[1:01:28] of Serene and Manan which had been
[1:01:31] brought up with Herod the patriarch and
[1:01:34] Saul. So they had multi-ethnic
[1:01:38] leadership. Barnabas was a henistic or a
[1:01:41] Greek from Cyprus. He came from a very
[1:01:44] priestly family and he was the leader of
[1:01:46] the new group in Antioch. Okay. Uh
[1:01:49] Simeon, he was an African. Lucius
[1:01:52] ofSirene as Libya, also of African.
[1:01:56] And there was Manan, childhood friend,
[1:01:58] maybe even a relative of Herod, the one
[1:02:01] that killed John the Baptist. And so he
[1:02:03] was a privileged member of society. And
[1:02:06] then there was Saul, a Greek Jew from
[1:02:09] Tarsus with religious training. He knew
[1:02:12] the scriptures of the day. They didn't
[1:02:15] have a New Testament. Okay? What wasn't
[1:02:17] written? They had the Old Testament that
[1:02:19] was the Bible still to today to many
[1:02:21] people. And they had a a a recent
[1:02:24] translation that was a little more
[1:02:25] friendly to to uh read which had been
[1:02:27] translated 200 years previous.
[1:02:30] And so these were the teachers and the
[1:02:32] prophets in this early church. And so as
[1:02:36] we read through Acts, we can see the
[1:02:38] model church at Antioch. And they were
[1:02:41] blessed with the spirit of God. Verse
[1:02:43] two, as they ministered to the Lord and
[1:02:47] fasted, the Holy Ghost said, "Separate
[1:02:49] me, Barnabas and Saul, for the work
[1:02:51] wherein to I have called them." So God
[1:02:54] always knows what he's doing. He He can
[1:02:56] see a lot farther. We You got all these
[1:02:59] fancy cars out here. You assume that
[1:03:01] when you go out there, it's going to
[1:03:02] start, but you don't know that.
[1:03:06] You know, it's very possible it couldn't
[1:03:07] start. We don't know the future, but God
[1:03:10] does.
[1:03:12] So God is eternal and he's not guessing.
[1:03:15] Well, let's think it over. What do you
[1:03:16] think? Let's see if this works. No,
[1:03:18] that's not the way God operates. No,
[1:03:20] that's not the way he operates. And so
[1:03:23] we um uh you know, he all he God knew
[1:03:26] all along who Saul was. He knew how he
[1:03:30] would use him. And uh he knows each one
[1:03:32] of you.
[1:03:34] He knows where you come from, why you're
[1:03:36] here, and if you're going to stay.
[1:03:39] See, brother David has no he has no
[1:03:41] guarantee that next Sunday church will
[1:03:43] be full.
[1:03:45] Something could come through here,
[1:03:47] everybody leaves. It's happened before.
[1:03:50] And so, we want to stick in the word,
[1:03:53] you see.
[1:03:55] And so, God knew each one of us
[1:03:58] back when God was of lasting on your
[1:04:01] mind. We were born in sin, shaping
[1:04:03] iniquity, so forth. And you can run, but
[1:04:06] you can't hide.
[1:04:08] I mean, you can run as fast as you want,
[1:04:10] but God will bring you back. We've got
[1:04:12] Saul. We've got many others. God will
[1:04:15] let you go out there and then he'll jerk
[1:04:16] your chain, get you back where you
[1:04:18] belong. So, let us focus on this
[1:04:21] interesting figure for a while. Uh, why
[1:04:24] is Saul important? Well, he was very
[1:04:27] important to our prophet. If you listen
[1:04:29] to any tapes at all, Saul was important,
[1:04:33] you see. So Saul was born in Tarsus but
[1:04:36] he was raised in Jerusalem.
[1:04:38] His father was a Pharisee which is the
[1:04:40] elite of Judaism because they have you
[1:04:43] know sections also. Uh he was a Roman
[1:04:45] citizen so he uh his father was a Roman
[1:04:48] citizen so he was also a Roman citizen
[1:04:50] and that came in handy at times and he
[1:04:52] had a trade. He wasn't just sitting on
[1:04:54] the porch waiting for the check. No, he
[1:04:55] he got it busy. He was a tent maker.
[1:04:58] Okay. And he was trained under Rabbi
[1:05:01] Galio, which was the best at the time.
[1:05:04] And this training usually lasted between
[1:05:07] the age 14 until 40. It wasn't a
[1:05:10] two-month course like today. No, it was
[1:05:12] a long time. And so he became a um the
[1:05:15] Jewish Council's chief agent of
[1:05:18] anti-Christian activity because they
[1:05:21] were, you know, when when this
[1:05:22] Christianity started, well, they had
[1:05:24] they had people in already prepared.
[1:05:26] Okay, now go get them. And he was one of
[1:05:28] them.
[1:05:29] If you even look like a Christian, if
[1:05:31] you had a little cross on the wall,
[1:05:32] whatever, out of here, profiling, no
[1:05:34] problem.
[1:05:36] And so even till today, they have what's
[1:05:39] called anti-missionary
[1:05:41] activity because Judaism wants to stay
[1:05:45] Jewish until the day that God reveals,
[1:05:48] oh, that is the Messiah. Where'd you get
[1:05:50] those prints in your hand? And so, uh,
[1:05:53] even today, every every Christian wants
[1:05:58] to have a a little address in Jerusalem.
[1:06:00] They want to have a a physical address.
[1:06:03] Even the people from Salt Lake City,
[1:06:04] they've got a nice building over there
[1:06:07] because, hey, we're part of this. We're
[1:06:09] part of Christianity. Well, so you say.
[1:06:12] But when they when they bought their
[1:06:14] property, they had to sign papers. We
[1:06:17] will not go house to house. Well, that's
[1:06:20] the main part of their religion, right?
[1:06:22] So, they had to sign that because they
[1:06:24] don't put up with it. I know people that
[1:06:26] have gone over there with great
[1:06:28] revelations. Oh, yeah. We're here to do
[1:06:30] this and that. Uh, let's see your return
[1:06:32] ticket. Okay. Get on the next plane. Out
[1:06:35] of here. They don't put up with it. And
[1:06:37] so, Saul was one of these guys back in
[1:06:39] the beginning, the anti-Christian
[1:06:41] campaign. Okay? And so he was very
[1:06:45] zealous in keeping the tradition the
[1:06:47] tradition of the fathers you know all
[1:06:49] the way from Moses. This is what Moses
[1:06:50] said. And so they they had a foundation
[1:06:53] but they had no revelation. You know the
[1:06:56] light keeps moving. And the reason we
[1:06:58] have denominational spirits amongst
[1:06:59] randommites today is because people put
[1:07:01] a period on God up to here is all I
[1:07:03] understand. That's all we're going to
[1:07:04] have controlling spirit. It's crazy but
[1:07:08] it's happening. We have people uh
[1:07:11] fostering and promoting uh the uh the
[1:07:14] idea that I can run it all.
[1:07:17] You know, organized religion. No, we're
[1:07:21] back to the Bible. Okay. So, Saul was
[1:07:24] called by his Jewish name Saul probably
[1:07:27] in memory of Israel's first king.
[1:07:31] He was a member of the tribe of tribe of
[1:07:33] Benjamin. But after his conversion, he
[1:07:35] became Paul, which would have been his
[1:07:37] Roman name. Okay, that begins there in
[1:07:39] verse 9 of chapter 13.
[1:07:42] And even though he was a troublemaker in
[1:07:44] the beginning, uh God placed him in a
[1:07:47] position of apostle to the Gentiles.
[1:07:50] That's us. So his message comes all the
[1:07:53] way through the seventh age.
[1:07:55] Okay? Now, don't go to sleep because
[1:07:57] it's going to get good here in a minute.
[1:07:59] And we do have ways of keeping you
[1:08:00] awake. Got a chubby deacon over there.
[1:08:05] But um you know
[1:08:07] um
[1:08:09] you know Luke is the actual writer of
[1:08:11] the book and he was only a disciple. He
[1:08:14] was not an apostle. A disciple is a
[1:08:17] follower. And while Jesus was on the
[1:08:19] earth he had 12 disciples. An apostle is
[1:08:22] one that sent out a missionary. Acts 18.
[1:08:25] So the 11 were disciples. They became
[1:08:28] apostles.
[1:08:29] And the one that we would probably put
[1:08:32] at the bottom of the pile, Thomas, he
[1:08:35] was the first one. You know, once he saw
[1:08:38] the prince, it all clicked together. He
[1:08:40] took off to India and became the first
[1:08:43] missionary. And they've still got stuff
[1:08:44] over there. St. Thomas this and St.
[1:08:46] Thomas that. And that's where he was
[1:08:48] killed eventually. But he got very
[1:08:50] serious. So Paul was a missionary, an
[1:08:53] apostle, and he was the first church age
[1:08:56] messenger. Okay? So he had to be
[1:08:59] somebody with a special anointing to
[1:09:01] bridge the gap, you know, to the
[1:09:03] Gentiles. Yet being Jewish in dealing
[1:09:06] with Jews in the first church age. So as
[1:09:09] an apostle and being such a stickler for
[1:09:11] the truth, he became much more of a
[1:09:14] problem for the unbelieving Jews than he
[1:09:17] ever was for the uh Christian believers.
[1:09:21] Not in violence, you know, not but in
[1:09:23] ideology. He was always under threat of
[1:09:26] his life from his former colleagues, the
[1:09:29] people that he was he was dealing with
[1:09:31] and yeah, let's go get the Christians
[1:09:32] and yeah, you're you're the one, Paul.
[1:09:34] Well, now he's a threat from them.
[1:09:37] So, at first, um, you know, in a
[1:09:40] nutshell, he became Christianity's
[1:09:42] leading evangelist and theologian.
[1:09:45] And don't let that scare you. Brother
[1:09:47] Brandham put his thumb down on
[1:09:48] theologians because they're promoting
[1:09:50] Baptist theology, Pentecostal theology,
[1:09:52] and so forth. But a theologian is simply
[1:09:55] one that can very capably defend the
[1:09:58] faith by the scriptures.
[1:10:00] Okay, I'm not there yet. I I don't know
[1:10:02] the scriptures entirely to to be a
[1:10:04] theologian of the scriptures, but that's
[1:10:06] what he was.
[1:10:08] But as the status in the church was
[1:10:10] rising, his perspective of himself
[1:10:13] diminished.
[1:10:15] Exactly what brother Brandham says. You
[1:10:17] want to be, you know, in the sight of
[1:10:19] God, stay more humble. So at first he
[1:10:22] considered himself an important
[1:10:24] Christian leader. Then later in 1
[1:10:26] Corinthians 15, I am the least of the
[1:10:28] apostles and not worthy to be called an
[1:10:31] apostle. Now he had the he had the
[1:10:34] papacy. He could stay elevated. No. Uh
[1:10:38] to be called an apostle because I
[1:10:40] persecuted the church of God. So he
[1:10:43] willingly told about his mistakes and
[1:10:45] his failures. He didn't gloss it over
[1:10:47] and you know forget it. know, he didn't
[1:10:49] pretend.
[1:10:51] Um, he didn't always have a happy face.
[1:10:54] You know, it's like they say over there
[1:10:55] in Israel about about Elijah. See, they
[1:10:58] studied about life of Elijah from from
[1:11:00] children. And they said, "Elijah was a
[1:11:02] pretty nice guy, but you don't want to
[1:11:04] push him too much cuz come after you,
[1:11:06] you know." Well, that's the way Paul
[1:11:07] was. And so, um, he was human, but he
[1:11:11] was totally God inspired, directed, and
[1:11:14] anointed just like William Brandon.
[1:11:17] William Brandon was human. I knew him.
[1:11:20] There's nobody else here knew him, but I
[1:11:22] knew him. And and he was same as Paul,
[1:11:25] God's messenger, you know.
[1:11:28] So in a message faith 1956,
[1:11:31] he says, "We don't care to be a big
[1:11:33] number of people." Okay? I never want to
[1:11:36] be big. I want to be honest. I never
[1:11:39] want to be great. I want to be sincere.
[1:11:42] I want to love the Lord. I want to serve
[1:11:44] the Lord. I want to help people. And so
[1:11:46] in finishing up 1 Corinthians 15, but by
[1:11:49] the grace of God, I am what I am. And
[1:11:52] that's true for each one of us. Just be
[1:11:54] what God made you. You don't have to
[1:11:57] take over Texas. Just be yourself.
[1:12:00] So without God's amazing grace, we're
[1:12:04] all totally lost.
[1:12:06] No hope.
[1:12:08] Not even a guarantee to get out the
[1:12:09] door, you know. So thank you, Lord, for
[1:12:13] saving my soul. just be humble. Thank
[1:12:17] you, Lord, for making me whole. I'm
[1:12:18] well. I'm here. You know, so later Paul
[1:12:23] said he was capable of nothing good.
[1:12:25] Romans chapter 7.
[1:12:27] Then in Ephesians 3, less than the least
[1:12:30] of all the saints. And finally in 1
[1:12:33] Timothy 1, chief of sinners.
[1:12:36] That doesn't sound like a man that's
[1:12:37] trying to get a following, does
[1:12:39] somebody, hey, follow me. I'm the man.
[1:12:40] No. So this fearsome Pharisee of
[1:12:43] Pharisees became
[1:12:46] the fearless apostle to the Gentiles.
[1:12:49] His motto was to live as Christ to die
[1:12:53] as gain.
[1:12:55] But if we're going to live, we're going
[1:12:56] to we're going to do it right. You know,
[1:12:58] and so brother Brandham says, "Make
[1:13:01] yourself little and God will bring you
[1:13:04] up. He that exalts himself shall be
[1:13:07] abased, but he that humbles himself
[1:13:09] shall be exalted. Yeah, that's an
[1:13:11] influence chapter 1962. So, always keep
[1:13:15] humble, be little in your own sight.
[1:13:18] Now, you can be too humble and be a tool
[1:13:20] of the devil. Now, I see some people
[1:13:22] kind of drifting.
[1:13:25] Yeah.
[1:13:26] Pay attention. We're not going to repeat
[1:13:28] this. So, always keep humble. Be little
[1:13:31] in your own sight. No matter what God
[1:13:33] does for you. Wow, nice church. Yeah. Be
[1:13:37] small. Be humble.
[1:13:39] Uh, no matter what God does for you,
[1:13:41] just see how much more humbler you can
[1:13:43] be all the time. The more God blesses
[1:13:46] you, just keep getting more humble, more
[1:13:48] little, and God will continue to bless.
[1:13:52] But you got to have balance because you
[1:13:54] can go out here in your flesh and and
[1:13:57] and be humble and be a tool of the
[1:14:00] devil. It's possible. So when we
[1:14:03] consider Paul's testimony from Galatians
[1:14:05] chapter 1, this transformation with Paul
[1:14:09] did not take place overnight and neither
[1:14:12] will yours. Now we're saved, but then
[1:14:15] there's the teaching, you know, it took
[1:14:18] at least 10 years for him to get it all
[1:14:20] straightened out of his mind. So be
[1:14:22] patient for those people that are coming
[1:14:24] in cuz everybody didn't have the same
[1:14:27] good cup of coffee that you had.
[1:14:29] Everybody didn't have a nice crispy
[1:14:32] pancake or whatever, you know. Everybody
[1:14:35] didn't have the nice cereal that sister
[1:14:37] uh fixed for me this morning. She's a
[1:14:40] good cook. I mean, she's keeping David
[1:14:43] alive, you know. So, um be patient for
[1:14:46] those that are coming along. God knows
[1:14:48] how to accomplish his will in every
[1:14:50] life.
[1:14:52] Remember, it's by his grace that we are
[1:14:55] witnesses. We could be out under a bus
[1:14:58] someplace. We could be down there with a
[1:15:00] drug cartel. There's a lot of things you
[1:15:02] could be, but he's got you here. Be
[1:15:04] thankful. Jesus Christ is our advocate.
[1:15:08] So, we are daily experiencing personal
[1:15:11] transformation, cleansing, and falling
[1:15:14] in love every day with Jesus Christ.
[1:15:16] Okay.
[1:15:17] So, um we are not lawyers to argue the
[1:15:21] case. Jesus Christ is our advocate.
[1:15:24] We're not judges. Nobody qualifies. No
[1:15:26] matter what your name is, sorry. But in
[1:15:28] verse three, it says that they fasted
[1:15:31] and prayed, laid hands on them, and sent
[1:15:33] them out on their first missionary
[1:15:35] journey. And they, you know, scripture
[1:15:39] records three different trips that they
[1:15:41] took. So in 30 years, they probably
[1:15:44] traveled just over 10,000 miles.
[1:15:47] And they didn't have an air conditioned
[1:15:48] SUV. No. Either walking or on a beast of
[1:15:53] some kind. So away goes Barnabas
[1:15:57] and uh Saul and young helper John Mark.
[1:16:01] And they sailed from the port of Seucia.
[1:16:03] All this is in the Bible. Over to the
[1:16:06] island of Cyprus.
[1:16:08] You've heard about Cypress recently.
[1:16:10] Yeah. And after preaching all the way
[1:16:12] across the island, they came to the
[1:16:13] other end on the western end to a city
[1:16:16] called Pathos. And they encountered a
[1:16:19] challenge. So in this western port city
[1:16:22] was an intelligent man like a governor.
[1:16:25] His name was Sergius Paulus and um he
[1:16:28] was hungry for the gospel. He he'd heard
[1:16:30] some things and he was getting hungry
[1:16:31] for the gospel. So he arranged to hear
[1:16:34] the preachers. But there was also a
[1:16:36] magician, sorcerer, false prophet that
[1:16:39] got in the way trying to ruin the
[1:16:42] program of God. Remember every move of
[1:16:45] God produces twins.
[1:16:47] And we'd like to think that everybody
[1:16:48] came here, parked your car nicely, came
[1:16:51] in, paid attention, paid tithe, and the
[1:16:54] church is, you know, going fine. But
[1:16:56] that's not true.
[1:16:59] You know who you are
[1:17:01] because there's three kinds of believers
[1:17:02] in every crowd.
[1:17:05] And of course, you can look around,
[1:17:06] well, we know who she is. We know which
[1:17:08] believer he is. Don't worry about that.
[1:17:10] Which believer are you? You know, so we
[1:17:13] have twins here in this in this early
[1:17:15] church. And um let's look at verse 6 of
[1:17:19] chapter 13.
[1:17:22] And when they had gone through the
[1:17:24] island unto Pathos, they found a certain
[1:17:26] sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose
[1:17:29] name was Bar Jesus. H which was with the
[1:17:34] deputy of the country, Sergis Paulus, a
[1:17:37] prudent man, who called for Barnabas and
[1:17:39] Saul, and desired to hear the word of
[1:17:41] God. So he's already hungry. God's
[1:17:44] dealing with him. But Elimus, the
[1:17:47] sorcerer, that's, you know, his name by
[1:17:48] interpretation, the same guy, withtood
[1:17:51] them, seeking to turn away the deputy
[1:17:54] from the faith. So, anything that gets
[1:17:56] in the way of God's program is going to
[1:17:58] get hammered.
[1:18:00] That's what's happening in the Middle
[1:18:01] East today. Crazy people are getting in
[1:18:04] the way of God. And boom.
[1:18:09] Okay.
[1:18:11] Verse nine. Then Saul, whose name is
[1:18:13] also Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:18:15] set his eyes on him. You don't like when
[1:18:18] Brother David's preaching and he focuses
[1:18:20] right on you. Watch out.
[1:18:25] And he said, "Oh, full of subility and
[1:18:28] all mischief, thou child of the devil."
[1:18:30] He didn't say, "Let's go have coffee and
[1:18:32] talk this over." No, I got a plan for
[1:18:35] you. No, right to the point. Thou enemy
[1:18:39] of all righteousness, wilt thou not
[1:18:41] cease to pervert the right ways of the
[1:18:43] Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the
[1:18:45] Lord is upon you, and you're going to be
[1:18:47] blind, and you're not going to see for a
[1:18:49] season?" And immediately there fell on
[1:18:51] him a midst of darkness, and he went
[1:18:54] about seeking somebody to lead him. Then
[1:18:57] the deputy, you know, the governor,
[1:18:58] whatever he is, uh, when he saw this,
[1:19:00] believed
[1:19:02] and um, being astonished at the doctrine
[1:19:06] of the Lord. Well, yeah, that would that
[1:19:08] would get things pretty serious real
[1:19:10] quick. Real quick, just like in chapter
[1:19:13] 5 with Ananas and Safara, remember them?
[1:19:16] The makeel believers that look good, had
[1:19:17] nice suit, boom, dead. So, things got
[1:19:21] really serious here really quickly, but
[1:19:24] it was all in God's plan.
[1:19:26] All of this happened right in front of
[1:19:28] the Roman leader. Brother Ram says, "So
[1:19:31] it's a cursed thing to the church of God
[1:19:33] for a man to put his hand upon the
[1:19:35] moving of the spirit." So you better
[1:19:38] know what you're doing. Just like on the
[1:19:41] black and white film, Brother Brandham
[1:19:43] is is uh speaking and he's he's waiting
[1:19:46] for the the angel to appear. And he
[1:19:49] says, "Now, just like with Moses, if you
[1:19:52] go taking something off of somebody that
[1:19:54] God put on there, you get in trouble.
[1:19:56] You got to have discernment."
[1:19:59] Okay? And so, it's one of the hard
[1:20:02] things for people to understand. All the
[1:20:05] supernatural that was demonstrated by
[1:20:08] God through his prophet, all the people
[1:20:10] that witnessed those things, where are
[1:20:12] they? How many times did he preach right
[1:20:14] here in Dallas in different places in
[1:20:17] Texas? Where are these people?
[1:20:19] They got the free sandwich and
[1:20:21] disappeared. You know, so in 20th and
[1:20:25] 21st century, we're dealing with very
[1:20:28] intelligent three kinds of believers.
[1:20:31] It's another message. So in verse 13,
[1:20:33] they sailed up to Perga and at that
[1:20:36] point, John Mark left the party. It's
[1:20:38] right there in your Bible. And he went
[1:20:40] home. We don't know the reasons, but he
[1:20:43] went home. Later with encouragement from
[1:20:45] Barnabas, Mr. encouragement, he came and
[1:20:48] was one of the key leaders of the early
[1:20:50] church.
[1:20:52] But look at verse 14 in chapter 13 here.
[1:20:55] What's it say?
[1:20:57] Uh but they departed from Perga. They
[1:21:00] came to Antioch in Pacidia and went into
[1:21:03] the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat
[1:21:05] down. Okay. So they um uh now this is
[1:21:11] another Antioch because unfortunately at
[1:21:14] that time there were 16 cities of that
[1:21:16] same name. Okay. And um in verse 15 they
[1:21:22] were there on the day of the service.
[1:21:23] They didn't knock the doors down. They
[1:21:24] were there at the right time. And after
[1:21:26] the reading of the law, in other words,
[1:21:28] they read a part of their prophet Moses.
[1:21:30] Okay? And the prophets, the rulers of
[1:21:34] the synagogue sent unto those two
[1:21:35] visitors, ye men and brethren, if you
[1:21:38] have any word of exhortation
[1:21:41] uh for the people, say on. So they
[1:21:43] recognized that these are visitors. They
[1:21:46] might have something important to say.
[1:21:48] They didn't pass them through a you know
[1:21:50] series of questionnaires and who are you
[1:21:52] and who's your grandma? No.
[1:21:54] got something to say? And so they
[1:21:56] invited him up. Yeah. It was the right
[1:22:00] day of the service. They arrived at the
[1:22:02] right place, the right time. They showed
[1:22:04] humility. They showed respect. And they
[1:22:06] were asked to speak. So from 16-41,
[1:22:11] uh it's a great message that Paul gave.
[1:22:14] It's all inclusive, quoting the
[1:22:16] prophets, discerning, warning, offering
[1:22:18] hope. Let's look at verse 16. Then Paul
[1:22:21] stood up and beckoned him with his hand.
[1:22:24] Men of Israel
[1:22:26] and all you that fear God, listen up.
[1:22:29] Uhhuh. And he proceeds with the brief
[1:22:31] history that they couldn't deny. Yeah,
[1:22:34] that's that's all right. Yeah, you're
[1:22:35] right on target. Yeah. But look at verse
[1:22:37] 23. Says here,
[1:22:41] of this man's seed, he's been speaking
[1:22:43] about David here. They couldn't they
[1:22:45] couldn't argue about that. Okay? of this
[1:22:48] man's seed hath God according to his
[1:22:50] promise raised unto Israel a savior
[1:22:53] Jesus.
[1:22:57] When John had first preached before his
[1:23:00] coming the baptism of repentance to all
[1:23:03] the people of Israel. And as John
[1:23:06] fulfilled his course, in other words,
[1:23:08] ran his course, he said, "Whom think ye
[1:23:11] that I am? I am not he, but behold,
[1:23:14] there cometh one after me whose shoes,
[1:23:17] you know, I can't even tie his shoes.
[1:23:18] I'm not even worthy to touch his shoes.
[1:23:21] Men and brethren, children of the stock
[1:23:22] of Abraham, and whosoever among you
[1:23:24] fearth God, to you is the word of this
[1:23:28] uh salvation sent. God has had mercy,
[1:23:31] and he's sending you this this message.
[1:23:35] It was a simple message at the beginning
[1:23:37] for the Jews only. Repent.
[1:23:40] And they were so many of them were so
[1:23:43] ingrained in the in the traditions of
[1:23:45] the fathers. We can't we can't no we got
[1:23:48] to stay right with what we know. Look at
[1:23:50] 29. And when they had fulfilled all that
[1:23:53] was written of him. In other words,
[1:23:56] everything that happened to Jesus Christ
[1:23:57] wasn't, you know, on the spur of the
[1:23:59] moment. It was all in the mind of God.
[1:24:01] It was written in the prophets. All of
[1:24:03] that had to come to pass according to
[1:24:04] the way it was written. Just like what's
[1:24:07] happening over there today. It's written
[1:24:08] in Daniel. It's written in Ezekiel.
[1:24:11] And the Baptists are studying it this
[1:24:13] morning.
[1:24:14] It's not a surprise to God. So when they
[1:24:17] fulfilled all that was written of him,
[1:24:19] they took him down from the tree and
[1:24:21] laid him in a sepicore. But by but God
[1:24:25] raised him from the dead.
[1:24:28] So resurrection is the cornerstone of
[1:24:31] our entire message. Brother Bram says
[1:24:34] it's the cardinal resting place of the
[1:24:36] gospel. No matter what he did, if he did
[1:24:39] not raise again from the dead, then it's
[1:24:41] all in vain. Waste of time. It proves to
[1:24:44] me that he was God. So, I don't have
[1:24:47] about that much patience to
[1:24:51] listen to people today preaching in our
[1:24:54] pulpits that Jesus wasn't God. And
[1:24:57] they're doing it. They're taking the
[1:24:59] deity out of Jesus Christ and put it
[1:25:01] over here with this man or this
[1:25:03] organization. No, Jesus was God.
[1:25:06] Otherwise, we're wasting time. And I
[1:25:09] think it's the great coronation of the
[1:25:11] full gospel is the resurrection and its
[1:25:14] divine promises. So, to my opinion, the
[1:25:16] resurrection is the greatest of all the
[1:25:18] promises and the things of the
[1:25:20] scripture. All the rest of it great, but
[1:25:23] if there's no resurrection, what do we
[1:25:26] got? Stories.
[1:25:29] So Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, if in this
[1:25:32] life only we have hope in Christ, we are
[1:25:35] all men most miserable. We're fooling
[1:25:37] ourselves. But this is real. We've got
[1:25:40] history to prove it. We've got lives
[1:25:41] right here that would be buried long
[1:25:43] time ago if it wasn't for the grace of
[1:25:45] God. Where would David be without the
[1:25:47] grace of God? Over there beating a drum
[1:25:49] in California still.
[1:25:53] No matter no telling how many weeds, you
[1:25:55] know, but he's here. But there is a
[1:25:59] resurrection for those that have
[1:26:01] surrendered their entire life to Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ and can say amen to all the word,
[1:26:06] not just the little parts you like.
[1:26:09] Because we go over to the cafeteria this
[1:26:11] afternoon, the kids are going to go for
[1:26:13] the chocolate and the strawberries.
[1:26:15] They're not going to eat the beef and
[1:26:16] the broccoli. No, this isn't cafeteria
[1:26:19] Christianity. We want it just like it
[1:26:21] says.
[1:26:23] So you see, anybody can repeat. Anybody
[1:26:26] can, you know, and they're doing it.
[1:26:27] They're opening the Bible. Yeah, it says
[1:26:29] right here. Well, yeah, it says right
[1:26:30] there. Where's the life? I can hear. I
[1:26:33] can listen to anybody with their stories
[1:26:35] for a little while, but where's the
[1:26:37] fruit of it? If you've got the truth,
[1:26:39] let's see the fruit. You know, so very
[1:26:41] few can take the word serious. All
[1:26:43] others
[1:26:45] all over Dallas will continue to pray
[1:26:48] play church until the day after the
[1:26:51] resurrection.
[1:26:52] You want to see this church fill up real
[1:26:54] quick? The day after the resurrection,
[1:26:56] they're going to start flooding in here.
[1:26:58] Well, those guys might have been right.
[1:26:59] Yeah, the real ones are gone. Just like
[1:27:02] in the days of Noah. So,
[1:27:06] let's move on here. Um,
[1:27:10] so he continues with the theme of the
[1:27:12] resurrected master in verse 31.
[1:27:15] And he was seen many days of them which
[1:27:18] came up with him uh from Galilee to
[1:27:20] Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto
[1:27:22] the people. And we declare unto you glad
[1:27:26] tidings, how that the promise which was
[1:27:28] made unto the fathers, God has fulfilled
[1:27:32] that same thing unto their children. In
[1:27:35] that he hath raised up Jesus again, as
[1:27:38] it is also written in the second psalm,
[1:27:40] "Thou art my son, this day I have
[1:27:43] begotten thee. Okay. So he gives them an
[1:27:48] entire message and at that point he
[1:27:50] could have said you know in closing um
[1:27:53] you know what is the point? Why is that
[1:27:56] important to us here in Antioch? They
[1:27:57] could have said okay thank you. Verse
[1:27:59] 38. Be it known unto you therefore men
[1:28:02] and brethren that through this man is
[1:28:05] preached unto you the forgiveness of
[1:28:07] sins. There's no other way.
[1:28:11] The only way you're going to have any
[1:28:12] success is to start your trip at the
[1:28:15] foot of the cross. You can't start your
[1:28:17] trip reading spoken word books. No, you
[1:28:20] got to start at the foot of the cross.
[1:28:22] Okay.
[1:28:24] Uh 39. And by him all that believe are
[1:28:28] justified from all things, from which
[1:28:30] you could not be justified under the law
[1:28:32] of Moses. Uh-huh. Beware, therefore,
[1:28:36] lest that come upon you which is spoken
[1:28:38] of by the prophets. quote, "Behold, you
[1:28:40] despisers in wonder and perish, for I
[1:28:44] work a work in your days, a work which
[1:28:46] shall in no wise uh believe,
[1:28:50] though a man declare it unto you." So he
[1:28:53] goes on, you know, but these Jews were
[1:28:56] so fanatical and they were so
[1:28:58] opinionated and legalistic. Verse 45,
[1:29:02] um but when the Jews saw the multitudes,
[1:29:06] they were filled with envy.
[1:29:09] Okay, preaching the word to these
[1:29:11] people. Things are happening and these
[1:29:13] people out here, they're filled with
[1:29:14] envy and they spoke against those things
[1:29:16] which were spoken by Paul, contradicting
[1:29:19] and blaspheming.
[1:29:21] You know, there's a limit to God's
[1:29:22] grace.
[1:29:24] Now, we we've been taught when somebody
[1:29:26] disagrees with you, just be nice and
[1:29:28] draw a circle bigger. Well, that's fine.
[1:29:31] It can work. But about the fourth
[1:29:32] circle,
[1:29:35] no more. You've blasphemed. I'm on I'm
[1:29:38] on a different team obviously, you know.
[1:29:40] So verse 46,
[1:29:43] Paul again, you know, very carefully but
[1:29:45] boldly he says here in 46, then Paul and
[1:29:48] Barnabas wax bold and they said it it
[1:29:52] was necessary that the word of God
[1:29:55] should first have been spoken unto you.
[1:29:57] Yeah, that's God's plan. But seeing ye
[1:30:00] have put it from you and judge
[1:30:02] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.
[1:30:06] Lo, we turn to the Gentiles. We've had
[1:30:09] it with you people. You blasphemed.
[1:30:12] We're not going to draw another circle.
[1:30:14] It's over. You know, so verse 47. For so
[1:30:19] hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I
[1:30:21] have set I have set thee to be a light
[1:30:24] to the Gentiles. Thou shouldest be for
[1:30:26] salvation unto the ends of the earth.
[1:30:30] In 48, and when the Gentiles heard this,
[1:30:33] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:30:36] the Lord, and as many as were ordained
[1:30:38] to eternal life believed. There's
[1:30:40] predestination again. And the word of
[1:30:42] the Lord was published throughout all
[1:30:44] the region. So results of simply
[1:30:49] preaching the word, not opinions, not I
[1:30:52] think, no, the word. it produces
[1:30:55] something you see. So, but we look at
[1:30:59] the contrast over in verse 43 um you
[1:31:02] know where they uh you know many of the
[1:31:04] Jews and then in 50 stirred them up. In
[1:31:06] other words, gossip ran and raised false
[1:31:09] witnesses against God's anointed.
[1:31:11] Remember the the magician in verse 8
[1:31:14] stone blind. But you see records, it's
[1:31:17] recorded here the footnotes of the um
[1:31:20] the uh the honorable women during the
[1:31:21] first century there at the end of
[1:31:23] chapter 13 women were in public office
[1:31:26] that didn't happen you know right now
[1:31:28] clear back there they ran their own
[1:31:30] business gaining wealth and influence
[1:31:32] the tragedy once they gained political
[1:31:35] and social power they employed that
[1:31:37] leverage to reject the gospel and
[1:31:40] protect their own interests yeah they
[1:31:43] didn't start here in Washington started
[1:31:44] clear back there. So with this rejection
[1:31:47] and persecution, what did Paul do? Did
[1:31:50] he call 911?
[1:31:52] Go back home. Go back call up from back
[1:31:54] up from Jerusalem. Did he have a pity
[1:31:56] party? Go home. No. Look at verse 51
[1:32:00] right here of where we at chapter 13.
[1:32:04] They shook the dust off their feet
[1:32:06] against those people and came unto
[1:32:08] Iconium. And the and the disciples were
[1:32:11] filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:16] Amen. God was with them. You got to take
[1:32:19] a stand sometimes. We don't have to put
[1:32:22] up with this nonsense. You guys want to
[1:32:24] do that in the name of the Lord, in the
[1:32:26] name of the tapes, whatever. No, there's
[1:32:28] a reality in the word. We got to stick
[1:32:30] with the word.
[1:32:32] Okay, it's not lunch time yet. So, we're
[1:32:34] going to go to chapter 14. So in verse
[1:32:36] one of 14, and it came to pass at
[1:32:38] Iconia, remember we just studied that
[1:32:40] they're they went over there. It's
[1:32:41] another city. Um that they went both
[1:32:45] together into the synagogue of the Jews.
[1:32:47] So they went to the right place at the
[1:32:48] right time. Now, why was why didn't they
[1:32:51] have a temple? Because the Romans had
[1:32:53] tore it down. So there's synagogues
[1:32:55] around the world today. Right here in
[1:32:57] Dallas, a minimum of 10 men get
[1:33:00] together. They can form a synagogue as
[1:33:02] it's a place of teaching. So there they
[1:33:04] are over there and a great multitude
[1:33:07] both of the Jews and also of the Greeks
[1:33:09] believed. So God is honoring his word.
[1:33:12] So they spoke freely at Aonium. There
[1:33:15] were converts but there was also the
[1:33:17] twin the unbelievers in verse two. But
[1:33:21] the unbelieving Jews stirred up the
[1:33:23] Gentiles and made their minds evil
[1:33:25] affected against the brethren. Okay? And
[1:33:29] so they um they brought in confusion.
[1:33:33] They um but God confirmed with signs and
[1:33:35] wonders. You know, confusion is never of
[1:33:37] God. If you see a confusing situation
[1:33:40] here in the church, zip it because
[1:33:43] you're not going to straighten it out.
[1:33:44] You're going to make it worse.
[1:33:46] Stay away from it. God will smash down
[1:33:49] the confusion.
[1:33:51] You stick with the word.
[1:33:54] So they stayed there a long time.
[1:33:56] Iconium uh long time. Therefore both
[1:33:58] they speaking boldly of the Lord uh
[1:34:01] which gave testimony unto the word of
[1:34:02] his grace and granted signs and wonders
[1:34:05] to be done by their hands. Okay.
[1:34:08] Um
[1:34:10] in John 14:12 it was in effect also John
[1:34:13] 15:7 they didn't have a New Testament to
[1:34:16] guide them. They had the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:18] They had the they had the Old Testament
[1:34:20] and the Holy Spirit. And so it hadn't
[1:34:22] been written yet. But um they only had
[1:34:25] the the testimonies. They had the
[1:34:27] eyewitnesses that have seen Jesus. But
[1:34:29] in all the book of Acts, we don't see
[1:34:31] anywhere that they're repeating word by
[1:34:34] word the red letter edition what Jesus
[1:34:36] said back here. They were just
[1:34:37] manifesting it. You see, and so um the
[1:34:42] word was being fulfilled right amongst
[1:34:44] them. So it was God in real time living
[1:34:46] out the promise of the first age. And uh
[1:34:49] you know the only hands that God has are
[1:34:51] your hands. The only eyes he has are
[1:34:54] your eyes. You see? And so, uh, as you
[1:34:57] yield yourself to God, he will use you
[1:35:00] in ways you can't imagine. Now, you
[1:35:02] don't have to figure it all out. Just be
[1:35:04] available for service. Brother Random
[1:35:07] couldn't see the future. I'm going to do
[1:35:08] this now. He had plans, but he had to
[1:35:11] walk by faith every step. And there was
[1:35:14] a lot of confusion even back then. So,
[1:35:18] the confusion continued back there
[1:35:20] because the troublemakers were anointed
[1:35:22] from the dark side just like over there
[1:35:24] today. And they were divi determined to
[1:35:27] bring division. Bring division. Separate
[1:35:29] people. So the unbelieving Jews also hel
[1:35:32] had help from the unbelieving Gentiles.
[1:35:35] They abused the missionaries. They
[1:35:37] stoned them. They were totally under
[1:35:39] control of satanic forces. And those
[1:35:42] forces are now maturing in our time.
[1:35:45] Very visible. Yeah. We don't have to
[1:35:47] wonder. Very visible. So Paul and
[1:35:50] Barnabas, they left town, moved on to
[1:35:53] Lististra, another town. then to Derby
[1:35:55] and there they preached the news and um
[1:35:59] there was a crippled man in the crowd
[1:36:01] and we're going to get to it here in a
[1:36:02] minute and um this man had never walked.
[1:36:06] He was born with this defect. Now we
[1:36:08] don't see too much of that today but I
[1:36:10] have seen people that like one brother
[1:36:12] said he's like spaghetti. He's just he's
[1:36:14] just there. No muscle, no nothing, but
[1:36:18] he's alive. So this is this man
[1:36:20] over here, okay? No muscle, no legs,
[1:36:22] nothing. But when he heard the word of
[1:36:24] spoken clearly in his language, thank
[1:36:26] you. He believed. And while preaching,
[1:36:30] Paul discerned that he had faith to be
[1:36:32] healed. Yeah. Look at verse 10 of 14.
[1:36:35] Where's it at?
[1:36:37] And he said with a loud voice, "Stand
[1:36:39] upright on thy feet." And he leaped and
[1:36:41] walked. Now, he's never walked. He's
[1:36:44] never done anything on his own.
[1:36:47] And when the people saw what Paul had
[1:36:49] done, they lifted up their voices. Now,
[1:36:51] this isn't a foreign language, okay?
[1:36:52] This isn't Paul's language. She's
[1:36:54] speaking through an interpreter. So,
[1:36:56] just like you today,
[1:36:58] they they had languages back then. And
[1:37:01] so, when when the people saw this, they
[1:37:03] lifted up their voices, saying in the
[1:37:05] speech of the Lyonia, "The gods are come
[1:37:07] down to us in the likeness of men."
[1:37:10] Well, yeah. They never seen any
[1:37:12] supernatural before. Wow. this is
[1:37:14] marvelous, beautiful, you know, and um
[1:37:19] so um brother Brandham had very high
[1:37:22] regard for a man called Dr. Lamza. And
[1:37:25] he's one that translated the Bible from
[1:37:28] Aramaic to English. And in verse 10, he
[1:37:31] says here, I um I say unto you, in the
[1:37:34] name of Jesus Christ, stand upright on
[1:37:36] your feet. He jumped and walked away.
[1:37:39] Nobody had ever seen that man do that.
[1:37:41] So the reaction of the people as we just
[1:37:43] read there in 11 and 12 and they called
[1:37:46] Barnabas
[1:37:47] Jupiter and Paul Mercurius because he
[1:37:51] was the chief speaker. So Jupiter is
[1:37:54] Latin for Zeus in Greek and Mercury is
[1:37:57] Latin for Hermes in Greek. Okay. So they
[1:38:00] were totally impressed. They began to
[1:38:02] worship and they gave pagan names to
[1:38:04] God's servants and that was all the
[1:38:07] supernatural that they'd ever seen. It
[1:38:09] seemed right to them. Wow. what happened
[1:38:11] to this man? You know, and um because
[1:38:14] they weren't acquainted with the Bible.
[1:38:15] They had no concept of the Bible.
[1:38:18] These are pagans and there's still
[1:38:20] pagans in the world today.
[1:38:23] And let me just give you a couple of
[1:38:25] numbers to think about. We've got 7,000
[1:38:29] known languages in the world today.
[1:38:31] English is only minor one. The Bible is
[1:38:35] only in 750 languages. So there's still
[1:38:38] people out there that have no concept of
[1:38:40] the word of God. The New Testament is in
[1:38:43] almost 1,600 languages. So the
[1:38:45] missionaries still got work to do. But
[1:38:48] these people never heard about the word
[1:38:49] of God. And in verse 13,
[1:38:52] uh then the priest of Jupiter, you know,
[1:38:54] this pagan religion which was before
[1:38:57] their uh city, brought oxen and garlands
[1:39:01] under the gates and would have done
[1:39:03] sacrifice with the people. So they were
[1:39:06] getting ready to kill some animals and
[1:39:08] have a big feast. Wow, look what's
[1:39:10] happened here, you know. And so um they
[1:39:13] they were so impressed with what had
[1:39:15] happened. It was all the supernatural
[1:39:17] they knew. They didn't know the Bible.
[1:39:20] So um they were serious, you know. And
[1:39:24] today in the 21st century, because this
[1:39:26] is 2,000 years ago, but today, if a
[1:39:29] person doesn't have the Holy Ghost on
[1:39:31] their soul and in tune with the God of
[1:39:34] the Bible, key elements, that person
[1:39:38] will almost feel comfortable with this
[1:39:40] type of worship and adulation. It is
[1:39:44] simple idolatry
[1:39:46] and God hates it. Yeah, but it's all
[1:39:49] gold and it's beautiful and flowers. No,
[1:39:52] we've been in that church over here that
[1:39:53] they're building, you know, Catholic
[1:39:56] church. Beautiful. Wow. God hates it.
[1:40:00] God hates idolatry.
[1:40:03] And so, um, but your revelation must be
[1:40:07] in balance with the written word of God.
[1:40:10] Not your idea, not because grandma said
[1:40:12] so. No, not pagan fanaticism. Okay? And
[1:40:17] so if you could do a brief search on
[1:40:19] your phone in the message, you're going
[1:40:23] to find that William Brandom says back
[1:40:24] to the word over 200 times. It might be
[1:40:27] important.
[1:40:30] Back to the Bible 81 times. Back to the
[1:40:33] original 128 times. Just just on the
[1:40:36] basic understanding, any child can do
[1:40:38] that. So this ministry of William
[1:40:40] Brandham Elijah turning the hearts of
[1:40:42] the children back to the fathers. In
[1:40:44] other words, current Christians back to
[1:40:47] the original.
[1:40:49] The word says, "You shall know the
[1:40:51] truth, and the truth shall make you
[1:40:53] free." So, you have a choice this
[1:40:55] morning. You can wander around
[1:40:58] as a prisoner. You're like a little
[1:41:00] Johnny Crow. You can only go so far. Or
[1:41:03] you can be free. But you got to know the
[1:41:06] word. You shall know the word. Not, you
[1:41:08] know, hear Scorby read it. You got to
[1:41:10] get in there and read it yourself.
[1:41:12] Brother Ram says, "The real church is a
[1:41:15] real sane gospel right in the middle of
[1:41:18] the road." In other words, balanced.
[1:41:21] Because you go this way, you're not in
[1:41:23] the middle of the road. Go this way,
[1:41:24] you're not in the middle of the road.
[1:41:26] You got to be balanced.
[1:41:31] He says, "It's not cold and starchy.
[1:41:34] Neither is it fanaticism. It's real good
[1:41:37] old warm gospel, heartfelt love of God
[1:41:40] going right down the middle of the road
[1:41:41] calling from both sides. And that's what
[1:41:43] he did. You see, brother Brandham was
[1:41:46] not a fanatical person. He was not
[1:41:49] orthodox. He was in the middle of the
[1:41:51] road. And if he only had gone out to
[1:41:55] minister where people just believe just
[1:41:57] like him where it' be nice and
[1:41:59] comfortable, he would have never left
[1:42:00] the corner.
[1:42:03] Listen to the tapes. He was in oneness.
[1:42:05] was in Pentecostal, wherever, because
[1:42:08] they invited him. They probably gave him
[1:42:10] a $100 offering or something, but he he
[1:42:13] stayed in the middle calling from both
[1:42:15] sides. Okay, continue here what he says.
[1:42:18] This is in Hebrews chapter 1.
[1:42:21] Um, that's right. And how are you going
[1:42:24] to get that church? Right out of the
[1:42:26] word, the yearum.
[1:42:29] Now, Paul wanted to get his church right
[1:42:31] in the middle of the road. So he went
[1:42:32] and studied three years on the
[1:42:34] scriptures that he knew Old Testament.
[1:42:37] Therefore, Paul wrote the bigger part of
[1:42:38] the New Testament. Um God had him to do
[1:42:41] that because of the coming gentile age.
[1:42:46] Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John, the four
[1:42:47] gospels, they were Jews, but Paul wrote
[1:42:50] most of the letters. So we have Paul and
[1:42:53] Barnabas in a tough situation here.
[1:42:55] Here's the man walking. Great miracle
[1:42:58] that God performed right there.
[1:43:01] and all these pagan people. Well, this
[1:43:03] must be move of God. We we got to got to
[1:43:06] burn sacrifice. We got to do things.
[1:43:08] It's all they knew. So, look at verse
[1:43:10] 14. It says here,
[1:43:13] which when the apostles Barnabas and
[1:43:15] Paul heard of all this, they ripped
[1:43:18] their clothes and ran amongst the people
[1:43:20] crying out and saying, Sir, why do you
[1:43:23] do these things? We also are men of like
[1:43:26] passions just like you. And we preach
[1:43:28] unto you uh that ye should turn from
[1:43:32] these vanities and all this nonsense
[1:43:34] unto the living God which made heaven
[1:43:36] and earth and the sea and all the things
[1:43:38] that are in. When times pass
[1:43:42] um suffered all nations to walk in their
[1:43:45] own ways. In other words, he he let him
[1:43:46] go on blindly. Nevertheless, he left not
[1:43:49] himself without a witness. and that he
[1:43:52] did good and gave us rain from heaven
[1:43:55] and fruitful season, filling our hearts
[1:43:57] with food and gladness. And with these
[1:44:00] say with these sayings
[1:44:02] uh and with these sayings scarcely
[1:44:06] restrained the people that they should
[1:44:08] not have done sacrifice unto them. So
[1:44:10] with all his screaming and preaching, he
[1:44:13] almost didn't turn the tide. They they
[1:44:16] were hellbent. They're going to they're
[1:44:17] going to do this, you know.
[1:44:20] So, um, he tried to explain and they
[1:44:24] almost succeeded in in worshiping and
[1:44:27] they were just about ready to burn the
[1:44:30] sacrifice and burn these oxen and so
[1:44:32] forth to worship the servants of God.
[1:44:35] But no true servant of God will accept
[1:44:39] any kind of worship.
[1:44:42] As much as we love Brother David, we're
[1:44:43] not going to worship him. He's got a
[1:44:45] position. You got a position. That
[1:44:48] doesn't mean you can't send him a
[1:44:48] birthday card, but you don't worship the
[1:44:50] man of God.
[1:44:52] And we got people today, I know them,
[1:44:55] they're worshiping William Brandon. You
[1:44:58] know, some of them, they're they're
[1:44:59] bowing down before the they got candles
[1:45:01] in front of the picture. They're on
[1:45:03] their face worshiping nothing but
[1:45:06] Catholicism.
[1:45:08] So,
[1:45:10] no true servant of God will accept any
[1:45:13] kind of worship. Neither will he allow
[1:45:16] worship to anyone but the Lord Jesus
[1:45:18] Christ. Now, brother Brandham could have
[1:45:21] gone in privately, okay? Where only a
[1:45:24] few would have seen him,
[1:45:26] kiss the ring of the pope of Rome, he
[1:45:29] had the opportunity,
[1:45:31] okay?
[1:45:32] And um he said in what is it here? The
[1:45:36] India report 1954
[1:45:39] a long time ago. I had an audience with
[1:45:42] the pope and I could have went up and
[1:45:45] talked to him but when I found out that
[1:45:47] you had to kiss his ring and his toe.
[1:45:51] No, no, no, no.
[1:45:54] I will give any man his due regards as
[1:45:56] reverend, doctor, whatever. Take off my
[1:45:59] hat as gentleman. But when it comes to
[1:46:02] worship, there's only one. That's the
[1:46:04] Lord Jesus Christ. So I will not do
[1:46:07] that. So he bypasses opportunity to be
[1:46:10] have a picture made with the pope of
[1:46:11] Rome.
[1:46:13] And for those of you that know a little
[1:46:15] bit about history, this would have been
[1:46:17] Pope Pas I 12th who was in office from
[1:46:20] March of 39 till October of 58. That was
[1:46:23] the one that he almost got to see.
[1:46:26] So back to our story here in chapter 14.
[1:46:29] Um, once again, the double-minded
[1:46:32] people, the fanatics, they have always
[1:46:34] been a part of the fabric of the gospel.
[1:46:37] We had them there. We got them in, you
[1:46:40] know, June of 25.
[1:46:42] I know some of them. They want me to
[1:46:44] come over there and get my picture made
[1:46:45] with them. No, I'm not going. I got
[1:46:47] better things to do. So, if these people
[1:46:50] hadn't shown up in the fabric, we would
[1:46:54] have reason to wonder if we're really in
[1:46:56] the right way. Back in 1950, Brother
[1:46:58] Brandham said, "Behold the lamb of God.
[1:47:00] Get ready. Wake up. Get your conscience
[1:47:02] out here." In other words, quit
[1:47:04] daydreaming. You know, pay attention.
[1:47:07] Get your soul out here with God. Get
[1:47:10] away from that sensebound existence. And
[1:47:13] see, he comes up with these compound
[1:47:14] words. I would have never thought of
[1:47:16] that. Get away from that sensebound
[1:47:18] existence. You know, five senses. Lift
[1:47:20] up your heads. Redemption's drawing
[1:47:22] nigh. Get ready. Signs and wonders
[1:47:24] appearing. 1950.
[1:47:28] critics, infidels waxing worse and
[1:47:30] worse. They were already there. Today,
[1:47:33] they're obvious. They're on the
[1:47:34] internet. They're everywhere. He says,
[1:47:37] "We've got to put up with them. But
[1:47:39] we're not looking to them. We're looking
[1:47:40] to God." So, I tell people everywhere,
[1:47:43] don't get involved with the crazy people
[1:47:45] on the internet. They will take you
[1:47:47] down.
[1:47:50] Yeah, I know them. This one lady used to
[1:47:52] pay tithes and then she got with him and
[1:47:56] she went with him and then she said she
[1:47:58] wrote to me now now that I'm not part of
[1:48:01] same thing you are you owe me that the
[1:48:03] tithe money back said honey that that
[1:48:06] money's long gone but they're crazy you
[1:48:09] see so Jesus wrote and he said woe unto
[1:48:14] you when all men speak well of you well
[1:48:16] me and David don't have to worry about
[1:48:17] that one do we got a few people out
[1:48:19] there that don't like us So the twin has
[1:48:22] to appear. So when you hear or see the
[1:48:25] twin in this congregation, don't get too
[1:48:27] excited. It's part of God's program.
[1:48:31] Okay? But you better know that you know
[1:48:33] that you know your experience and your
[1:48:35] revelation must be backed up by the word
[1:48:38] of God, not popular opinions. Okay?
[1:48:42] So let's go back here to verse where we
[1:48:44] at 14 and 19. And um and there they came
[1:48:50] said there's certain Jews from Antioch
[1:48:52] Iconium and persuaded the people here's
[1:48:54] the unbelievers right having stoned Paul
[1:48:57] they drew him out of the city supposing
[1:49:00] him to be dead so these troublemakers
[1:49:03] followed from the previous city you know
[1:49:06] they had nothing else to do they got the
[1:49:08] people into a frenzy they stoned Paul
[1:49:11] not with pegravel large sharp rocks
[1:49:15] and they dragged him out of the city
[1:49:17] thought he was dead.
[1:49:19] In other words, it's over. Verse 20. How
[1:49:23] be it, as the disciples stood around
[1:49:25] him, they weren't just standing there
[1:49:26] looking. They were praying. He rose up,
[1:49:29] came into the city, and the next day he
[1:49:32] departed with Barnabas to Derby. Okay,
[1:49:35] so great miracle.
[1:49:37] And um so they preached the word over in
[1:49:40] Derby and they returned by the same
[1:49:42] route confirming the faith of the new
[1:49:44] believers in verse 22
[1:49:47] uh confirming the souls of the disciples
[1:49:50] and exhorting them to continue in the
[1:49:52] faith and that we must through much
[1:49:55] tribulation entering the kingdom of God.
[1:49:57] I got news for you. We're not on a
[1:49:59] picnic.
[1:50:01] Okay? Just because we got nice cars and
[1:50:03] nice air conditioned building, that's
[1:50:05] benefits. But it's going to get tough.
[1:50:09] It's going to get real bad real quick.
[1:50:12] Got to know that you know that you know.
[1:50:16] Okay.
[1:50:17] And so
[1:50:19] um tribulation. And when they had
[1:50:22] ordained them elders in every church, in
[1:50:24] other words, they set church in order.
[1:50:26] They had prayed and fasting. They
[1:50:28] commended them to the Lord on whom they
[1:50:30] believed. So things are looking tough,
[1:50:33] but God is in control. And so they were
[1:50:37] definitely ordained of God in what they
[1:50:38] were doing, believing that they were
[1:50:40] preaching. God took care of them. They
[1:50:43] weren't on vacation. So they arrived
[1:50:45] back home. Verse 27.
[1:50:48] And when they were come, they had
[1:50:49] gathered the church together and
[1:50:51] rehearsed all that God had done with
[1:50:53] them on this missionary trip. And how he
[1:50:55] had opened the door of faith to the
[1:50:57] Gentiles. Great news. And there they
[1:51:00] abodeed a long time with the disciples.
[1:51:03] So that is the foundation of our church.
[1:51:09] Rome wasn't in the picture yet. There
[1:51:10] was already already some confusion with
[1:51:13] people that you know were double-minded.
[1:51:15] But there's a truth that comes all the
[1:51:17] way through till today. And that's why
[1:51:19] God has sent us a prophet in this time
[1:51:21] to restore us back to the original.
[1:51:25] We should never
[1:51:27] be unthankful. Thank God he's got you
[1:51:30] under the sound of the gospel, not out
[1:51:31] there serving Romans and burning
[1:51:34] candles. How many come from the Catholic
[1:51:35] church? Be honest. Okay, there's one.
[1:51:38] There's got to be some more. Another
[1:51:40] one. Yeah, another one.
[1:51:43] God knows who you are. He got you over
[1:51:46] here where you can hear the truth. And
[1:51:48] you come from all kinds of different
[1:51:49] things. I'm just happy to be part of you
[1:51:51] and know that God is faithful. God is
[1:51:54] not looking some other way. He knows who
[1:51:57] his people are. He knows how many young
[1:51:59] widows are left over there in Israel
[1:52:02] because there's men sacrificing their
[1:52:03] lives right now. You know, things are
[1:52:06] happening and starting to happen real
[1:52:08] quick and you better be ready. God bless
[1:52:12] you.
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:27] makes you want to go back and start
[1:52:29] reading it verse by verse, huh? Line by
[1:52:32] line. It it goes to show how how you can
[1:52:37] walk over so many things within the
[1:52:40] framework of the scripture and and we're
[1:52:43] all playing a part of it. every
[1:52:45] everybody
[1:52:47] he's our messenger told us that there
[1:52:49] would be another book of Acts written.
[1:52:52] So we're a part of something that's
[1:52:55] real, you know, and you you can't
[1:53:00] condemn those people that when they saw
[1:53:03] the work of God, they thought that God
[1:53:06] had come down in the form of man. Well,
[1:53:10] that's true.
[1:53:12] The response was wrong. But the
[1:53:15] revelation was right. It was God
[1:53:19] dwelling in men. That's what the Holy
[1:53:21] Spirit is. It's God dwelling in men. And
[1:53:25] not the man showing up, but the Christ
[1:53:28] showing up. And really, that's what this
[1:53:32] the our our striving should be as
[1:53:35] Christians. And even Paul says to bring
[1:53:37] the flesh under subjection that Christ
[1:53:40] might live in us and through us and that
[1:53:44] our light might shine and that our good
[1:53:46] works might glorify our father in
[1:53:49] heaven. And you know and a lot of people
[1:53:52] they don't even in their mind even have
[1:53:55] the idea
[1:53:57] of laying down a pattern of good works.
[1:54:01] something that you a good work that you
[1:54:03] do over and over and over again.
[1:54:06] Visiting the widow and their affliction,
[1:54:08] visiting the fatherless, the homeless,
[1:54:10] you know, reaching out to the poor,
[1:54:12] going the extra mile, you know, doctrine
[1:54:16] was never a substitute, and I loved how
[1:54:19] brother George brought that out, was
[1:54:21] never a substitute for the life. That's
[1:54:23] right. Living a Christian life, and a
[1:54:27] Christian life is based on the love of
[1:54:30] God. Amen. Flowing from you,
[1:54:34] the the love of God shed abroad in your
[1:54:38] heart by the Holy Spirit. That that's
[1:54:41] what we do. And if we don't, we fall
[1:54:44] into the same pattern that the church
[1:54:47] has for years. We doctrally separate
[1:54:50] ourselves.
[1:54:51] If you don't believe the way I do, I
[1:54:53] don't walk with you. If you don't
[1:54:55] believe the way I with you, I don't eat
[1:54:56] with you. If you don't believe the way I
[1:54:58] do, I don't walk down the side the same
[1:55:01] side of the street as you do. I I turn
[1:55:04] my back from you. But if you've got a
[1:55:07] fountain of living water because God
[1:55:11] first loved you and you're not going on
[1:55:14] what people think, you're going on what
[1:55:17] that he done for you and that the love
[1:55:20] of God is is shed abroad in your heart.
[1:55:23] That doesn't mean it gets shed for this
[1:55:26] or that. It it means that the love of
[1:55:30] God is flowing through you
[1:55:34] is is going out from you. That you're
[1:55:38] letting your light shine. You're putting
[1:55:41] that love on display. You're letting
[1:55:43] people that you love because he first
[1:55:46] loved you.
[1:55:48] And you're not ashamed of the gospel,
[1:55:51] you know. And I I've just watched over
[1:55:54] the years the decline, you know, even
[1:55:58] within the framework of the message, we
[1:56:01] used to follow this message because the
[1:56:04] scripture said, "Be ye followers of me
[1:56:06] as I am of Christ." You know,
[1:56:10] brother Ram used to have communion the
[1:56:13] first Sunday of every month. That's what
[1:56:16] he did. And so we have communion the
[1:56:20] first Sunday of every month because we
[1:56:22] saw an example. Now people don't have
[1:56:25] communion
[1:56:27] maybe once a year.
[1:56:29] You know the po the pool's ready. If
[1:56:32] you're not baptized in the name of the
[1:56:34] Lord Jesus Christ in Christian baptism
[1:56:37] the pool's ready.
[1:56:39] You know that there's there's there's
[1:56:42] formulas and things you want. You want
[1:56:44] the Holy Ghost. repent,
[1:56:49] you know, say you're sorry, recognize
[1:56:51] you're wrong, you know, and and and and
[1:56:54] be baptized. You will receive the gift
[1:56:57] of the Holy Ghost. You will receive it
[1:57:00] and not an anointing, but a life, a
[1:57:03] love. How can you have the Holy Spirit,
[1:57:05] not have the love of God in your heart?
[1:57:09] How can you how can you Paul John said
[1:57:12] how can you say you love God and whom
[1:57:14] you can't see and then hate your brother
[1:57:17] who you can see and so you know all
[1:57:21] these fundamentals
[1:57:23] that are are the things that really
[1:57:26] please the Lord
[1:57:28] really being a Christian really having
[1:57:31] the love of God the the love that he had
[1:57:34] for you
[1:57:37] having for others
[1:57:38] Freely it was given to you. Freely give
[1:57:42] you re freely received it. Freely share
[1:57:47] it. And and there none of us should be
[1:57:52] able to keep our Christianity a secret.
[1:57:56] You don't know what I mean? Uh we should
[1:57:59] we should all be proud to to let people
[1:58:02] know what we believe. We we shouldn't be
[1:58:05] ashamed that God sent a messenger in
[1:58:09] this day that
[1:58:12] restored us back
[1:58:15] to the scriptures.
[1:58:18] And so I would hope that they could say
[1:58:22] that about each of us that they could
[1:58:25] see God
[1:58:27] in us
[1:58:29] because Christ in you is the hope of
[1:58:32] glory.
[1:58:34] And if this that's the hope of glory.
[1:58:38] You want to have the hope of something,
[1:58:41] the hope of being in heaven, the hope
[1:58:44] that you're going to make it. Christ in
[1:58:46] you is the hope of glory. You you so if
[1:58:52] you you want to possess that hope, let
[1:58:55] Christ be in you. Let the love of God be
[1:58:57] in you. Let the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:59:00] be in you. Let the actions of Jesus
[1:59:03] Christ be in your life. Be a Christian.
[1:59:07] And then we also know that if that same
[1:59:10] spirit
[1:59:12] that was in Christ Jesus dwell in you,
[1:59:17] it will quicken your mortal body.
[1:59:22] And everything about our age is rapture.
[1:59:25] Brother George brought that out. I I
[1:59:26] appreciated that. It's all about making
[1:59:29] the rapture.
[1:59:30] You say, "How do I want to make the
[1:59:32] rapture?" It's not what you believe,
[1:59:34] it's what you live.
[1:59:37] It's not what you say, it's what you do.
[1:59:41] It's not what you hear. Don't just be a
[1:59:43] hearer of the word, but be a doer of the
[1:59:46] word. And then we c we can start to
[1:59:49] understand what what is our path
[1:59:51] forward. What is God looking from the
[1:59:54] church? He's not looking for more
[1:59:57] theologians.
[1:59:58] He's looking for more believers.
[2:00:02] People that'll believe every promise and
[2:00:06] live by that promise and believe that
[2:00:09] that promise is their future.
[2:00:14] The future events in my life should be
[2:00:18] based upon what God promised would
[2:00:21] happen in my life.
[2:00:24] That should be our future.
[2:00:27] and and there there's nothing like the
[2:00:30] Lord Jesus,
[2:00:32] you know, and I know Brother George
[2:00:34] referred back to me from being in in
[2:00:38] California and yeah, I was a a a a
[2:00:42] hippie in California, just 60s hippie
[2:00:47] and but one day he come down for me and
[2:00:53] and changed me and and and and I I I I
[2:00:58] tried to be a Christian my own way and I
[2:01:01] formed a a a commune and I was raised a
[2:01:06] Catholic. So I dressed like a priest and
[2:01:09] and all the believers dressed like nuns
[2:01:12] and and and
[2:01:14] it it was a sight to behold, believe me.
[2:01:19] But God knowing
[2:01:23] that I was his, he found a way to get me
[2:01:27] the word of God for the hour. And I'm so
[2:01:30] thankful. I'm not ashamed of the gospel
[2:01:33] of Jesus Christ because it's the power
[2:01:35] of God unto salvation. I'm not ashamed
[2:01:39] of this message because it exposes the
[2:01:43] deception. It exposes the son of
[2:01:46] predition who appears as an angel of
[2:01:49] light in our day deceiving us. So, okay,
[2:01:54] I it it behooves us
[2:01:58] to get into the word of God.
[2:02:02] It behooves you not to let life just
[2:02:05] catch you up, the daily routine, the
[2:02:08] working routine. You must set time aside
[2:02:13] to get into the presence of God to read
[2:02:16] the word of God as he took his level
[2:02:21] uh to get balanced in your life that
[2:02:25] that the Lord is balanced in your life.
[2:02:28] Satan will eat you up with prosperity,
[2:02:32] but yet it all burns.
[2:02:35] The prophet God made a statement. And I
[2:02:37] I don't know if I I I I brought it out,
[2:02:41] but he said all the things of this
[2:02:44] world, he says they'll perish, but love,
[2:02:47] joy, peace, he says that's of the
[2:02:50] eternal world.
[2:02:54] The eternal world,
[2:02:56] and there is an eternal world for us to
[2:03:00] walk in.
[2:03:02] Don't you want to be a part of eternity?
[2:03:08] Eternal life is a gift of God lest any
[2:03:12] man should boast. I want to live the
[2:03:15] eternal life. Don't you? The life
[2:03:18] that'll last. The life that won't
[2:03:21] perish.
[2:03:22] The life that will be there when this
[2:03:25] body
[2:03:27] fades away and it's starting to fade and
[2:03:31] it starting to wrinkle and it's starting
[2:03:34] to wear down.
[2:03:35] But I have a great hope. I've got one
[2:03:38] waiting for me. How many believes that?
[2:03:42] Amen. Let's live for the glory of God.
[2:03:47] Amen. Let's live
[2:03:50] that we worship and lift him up. Let's
[2:03:55] don't be ashamed. I'm not ashamed of
[2:03:57] this message. I'm not ashamed to have
[2:03:59] the picture of the pillar of fire on the
[2:04:02] wall.
[2:04:04] I'm not ashamed of Malachi 4:5,
[2:04:08] Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, and the
[2:04:13] signs and wonders and vindication that
[2:04:16] was done at our days. It's our hope. Our
[2:04:19] hope is Christ Jesus in us. God bless
[2:04:23] you this morning. That was wonderful.
[2:04:25] Let's come back this evening. What what
[2:04:28] is going on this evening that's so
[2:04:31] important that you can't come back?
[2:04:34] If it's gas money, just come see me.
[2:04:37] I'll buy your gas. I'll fill your tank
[2:04:40] up. If it's if you don't have food, uh
[2:04:44] we'll feed you. If it's too far to come
[2:04:47] back, you can stay at my house or I'll
[2:04:50] get you a room.
[2:04:55] I challenge any excuse
[2:05:01] any reason.
[2:05:04] If you want to, if you have to miss
[2:05:06] work, I'll give you the pay.
[2:05:11] You say, "Brother Megari, can you all do
[2:05:13] all that?" Yes. My father owns the
[2:05:15] cattle on the thousand hill.
[2:05:21] The only difference is what's in your
[2:05:23] heart.
[2:05:25] And the scripture says, as we see the
[2:05:27] day approaching,
[2:05:28] let us ever more gather ourselves
[2:05:31] together.
[2:05:33] People don't even want that. Churches
[2:05:35] are doing away with evening service
[2:05:40] because nobody wants to come to church.
[2:05:43] What do they want? I want God. I want
[2:05:46] the word of God. I want the food.
[2:05:50] You know, I don't know what book George
[2:05:54] go into tonight.
[2:05:56] He's liable to go into Ezekiel.
[2:06:00] And if you don't think you didn't know
[2:06:02] that that two chapters of Acts, how many
[2:06:04] found a lot of stuff going on in Acts
[2:06:06] you didn't ever recognize and see? You
[2:06:09] don't want to get into Daniel or Ezekiel
[2:06:11] or some of those places. It'll blow your
[2:06:13] mind.
[2:06:15] God's real, isn't he?
[2:06:18] Lord bless you. I'm going to have
[2:06:19] brother Billy come lead us in a few
[2:06:21] dismissal songs and pray pray for us and
[2:06:25] and uh we have some things on our heart
[2:06:29] that we'd like to share uh next uh
[2:06:33] Sunday morning with you if the Lord
[2:06:35] allows it if he tries. But if he doesn't
[2:06:38] tar, who's ready to go?
[2:06:42] Amen. Who wants to go?
[2:06:43] [Music]
[2:06:45] Hallelujah.
[2:06:47] Amen. How many just want to stay down
[2:06:49] here for another couple three or four or
[2:06:51] five years and work
[2:06:55] and watch it get worse?
[2:06:58] We come by the church today and brother
[2:07:00] George looked at me. He says, "What do
[2:07:02] they have in there? A swimming pool?"
[2:07:05] No, George. That's that's the way they
[2:07:07] dress for church.
[2:07:10] It's what it looks like. It's getting
[2:07:11] bad, church.
[2:07:14] and and and we know like brother George
[2:07:16] pointed out to us, they're dropping
[2:07:18] bombs over there. Our country is
[2:07:21] dropping bombs.
[2:07:23] Because they're trying to keep a country
[2:07:25] from getting a nuclear weapon. Why? Why
[2:07:29] would they go through so much trouble to
[2:07:31] try to prevent a nuclear weapon? Because
[2:07:34] it's prophesied that they're going to be
[2:07:36] burned up
[2:07:39] and they're not going to stop it. Don't
[2:07:41] fool around with God. Huh? Let's get
[2:07:44] more sincere. God bless you, brother
[2:07:46] Billy H. Come and lead us in a Let's
[2:07:49] stand together and let's
[2:07:57] worship the Lord for a moment. Amen.
[2:08:05] Oh, when you unravel me
[2:08:10] with a meloy,
[2:08:14] you surround me with a song.
[2:08:22] Oh, of deliverance
[2:08:26] from my eneies.

[2:08:34] are gone.

[2:08:40] slave

[2:09:08] Oh, and from eternity,
[2:09:13] you have chosen me.
[2:09:17] Oh, your love flows, oh mighty.

[2:09:37] my name. Hallelujah. Oh, and I'm no

[2:09:53] of God.
[2:09:56] Oh, and I'm no longer
[2:10:00] slave
[2:10:01] to fear.
[2:10:06] I am a child. Sing that second verse
[2:10:10] again.
[2:10:11] Oh, and from eternity,
[2:10:15] hallelujah,
[2:10:17] you have chosen me.
[2:10:20] Oh, and your blood flow.
[2:10:24] Call my name.
[2:10:27] Oh, and I've been born again.
[2:10:31] Oh, into a family.
[2:10:37] Your blood flow through my veins.
[2:10:43] Oh, and I'm going to
[2:10:47] save.
[2:10:51] Oh, and I am a child.
[2:10:59] Oh, and I'm no longer
[2:11:03] a slave
[2:11:04] to fear.
[2:11:07] Oh, and I am a child.
[2:11:12] Oh, God.
[2:11:15] [Music]
[2:11:17] You sweep the sea so I could walk right
[2:11:23] through it.
[2:11:25] My fears were drown in perfect love.
[2:11:30] [Music]
[2:11:33] You rescued me and I will stand and see
[2:11:40] what I am.
[2:11:44] Just sing it again. Oh,
[2:11:49] you split the sea so I could walk right
[2:11:54] through it.
[2:11:57] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[2:12:05] You rescue me and I will stand and see.
[2:12:11] Oh, and I am a child
[2:12:15] of God.
[2:12:18] Oh, when I'm no longer
[2:12:21] a slave
[2:12:23] to fear.
[2:12:26] Oh, when I am a child
[2:12:31] of God.
[2:12:33] Oh, when I'm not longer.
[2:12:41] Oh, when I am a child
[2:12:47] of God. Hallelujah.
[2:12:51] I just want to speak the name of Jesus
[2:13:00] over every heart and every mouth.
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:08] I know there is peace within your
[2:13:11] presence.
[2:13:13] Oh, ask me Jesus.
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:22] Oh, and I just want to speak the name of
[2:13:27] Jesus
[2:13:31] till every
[2:13:33] addiction starts to break.
[2:13:37] Oh, and declaring Mary.
[2:13:44] Just think about it this morning. Must
[2:13:46] be Jesus.
[2:13:53] Oh, your name is
[2:13:57] Hallelujah.
[2:14:01] Oh, your name is
[2:14:09] Oh, and breaking every
[2:14:14] shine through the shadow.
[2:14:17] Oh, and the light
[2:14:20] of heart.
[2:14:26] Oh, and I just want to speak the name of
[2:14:31] Jesus
[2:14:35] over fear and all anxiety.
[2:14:42] Oh, and to every soul that can do my

[2:18:23] this world is full of people who are
[2:18:25] dying,
[2:18:27] that are without you, Lord God.
[2:18:34] Lord, I pray that you'd put such a
[2:18:35] conviction upon us, Lord, that we'd
[2:18:39] spend our time fasting and praying
[2:18:43] and reaching out to the lost.
[2:18:46] It's the final call. We're the final
[2:18:48] voice to the final age. Lord,
[2:18:52] we've got many loved ones who aren't
[2:18:54] serving you, that aren't going in the
[2:18:57] right direction, Lord.
[2:19:01] Lord, we just ask that you would work on
[2:19:03] both ends and that you would
[2:19:08] find us
[2:19:11] available to be your hand extended.
[2:19:16] Lord, we love you and we're grateful for
[2:19:18] your mercy and grace that has called us
[2:19:21] today. Lord,
[2:19:24] we ask that you'd be with us as we go
[2:19:26] and
[2:19:27] with with us as we return.
[2:19:31] We love you. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:19:34] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
