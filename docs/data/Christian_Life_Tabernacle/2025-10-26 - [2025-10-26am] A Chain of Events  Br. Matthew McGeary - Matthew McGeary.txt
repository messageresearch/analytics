Description:
A Chain of Events
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
October 26th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; before I sing. I'll just share a quick testimony. I'll just share a quick testimony. Um, you know, the Lord's just done something very wonderful for uh for me. It was on um Thursday. Um just a little just to go back a little bit. I've been lately just in between so many questions. Um and it's very insignificant to many people, but to me it's a little bit big. So I will share it anyway. I've been just in between like, you know, do I want to get a new car or do I want to get a old car or do I, you know, because I don't want to get in depth. And um, you know, I've been kind of just putting something on the side to see if I can acquire another one. And I've been praying in my heart, you know, if the burden, you know, as we're expecting with my wife, I've been praying. And I said, "Lord, I don't want to be foolish stewards of what you've given me. I don't want to just go ahead and splurge on things and then later on you start falling short." And this Thursday, I was driving with my wife to go visit a brother to help out a brother on something. And we were on the highway and the car just stopped. you know, I'm talking about all the engine sign and everything was just popping right in front of my eyes and I was like, Lord, is this it like for this car? Because I really love my car and it's beat up, but I love it. And you know, I pulled over on the side and you know, I did a little bit that I know about car. You know, I I took a walk across there was a gas station from the highway. I took a walk. I grabbed some coolant because I checked it was low. I added coolant and I tried to revive the car, you know. I checked the radiator. I check every I went through all the check box that I could and nothing seems to be wrong and I start the car. It started and it was shaking and the car wouldn't just move. You know, I put it to back to to to reverse to get out and go and the car just died. And if you know anything about car, every signal was leading to transmission issue. And when transmission is down, you just have a casket. Like literally, it's just garbage at that point. And me and my wife, we looked at each other. I said, but we are in the like we in the in the post of duty. We were going out to help out a brother. Like why would this happen? So we held hands in the car. She was like, "Do we call the Uber? Do you want to go home?" I was like, "No, we are going to go see somebody." And we just held hand in the car and then I said a word of prayer and then I said, "Lord, I have to go visit this brother and we are going to go from with this car. I need it for at least two more months just to be sure of what I want to get next." And just as soon as I finished praying, my wife was looking at me. So, do we call the Uber? I said, "We just prayed. So, I started the car. It was shaking very hard. And I put it on reverse and it didn't stop. And then just as I started going forward, we merge back in the highway. It stopped shaking, you know. Uh, and then she looked at me like, "Do you know what just happened?" I was like, "I knew God was a healer, but I didn't know he was a mechanic because, you know, he just does it all." And &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Random says, "God is a supernatural God and his children's is just an attribute and it makes me glad to know that we have a God that's just a present help. When you call on him, he answers prayer." You know, I want to sing a song &gt;&gt; that says, "My heart is excited. I want to see Jesus. My heart is exciting, Lord. My heart is exciting. My heart is exciting. I want to see Jesus, Lord. My heart is exciting. My heart is excited, [singing] Lord. My heart is excited. I long to see Jesus. [singing] I am like David. I was hurting my father sheep. Then you called me. Then Lord, you anointed me. Lord, you've anointed me. Filled me with your Holy Ghost. You've excited my heart. You've excited my soul. Lord, my heart is exciting. Lord, my heart is exciting. Lord, my heart is exciting. I long to see Jesus. Lord, my heart is exciting. Lord, my heart is exciting. Lord, my heart is excited this morning. I want to hear Jesus. Lord, my heart is excited. Lord, my heart is excited. Lord, my heart is excited. Oh, I long to see Jesus. [singing] Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad to serve a God who's a mechanic? &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't matter what you have need of. He certainly knows how to fix. Amen. That's why we bring our needs and our care to him because he knows the way. Amen. Amen. And we have a couple of requests this morning. Amen. Don't forget we have our youth meeting this coming Friday. Amen. So all of those uh that are in the youth group, please just um uh send uh uh just a confirmation that you'll be able to attend so we can account for the group. Amen. Also, today is a very special day. It's brother David's birthday. Amen. And certainly, you know, appreciate him. I I've always every time I think of brother David, I think about when I'm talking about the sheep who smells the the shepherd who smells like sheep, you know. You know, he's uh he's one that I've met a lot of pastors. I've met a lot of people, but I have never met one with such a humility with like brother David has. And he's never lifted up. He walks with everyone. and whatever your thinking is. You know, I've always been amazed that we our church is built with from people that come from different teaching, different background, and different everything, including even the very food we eat is very different. &gt;&gt; But yet, we are gathered here as one people. It takes someone who has leadership. It takes the Holy Spirit himself to come and put us together. and that we may put our doctrines aside and and that we may focus on one thing alone and that's the life of Christ living in a believer. So today I just want to ask if you take a little bit of time and just text him. I know he's out of town. We want to just text him and and let him know that we appreciate him that uh we certainly pray for him that God will bless him and be with him. I know he just preached this last service and so he's going to be back home soon. We just want to text him and uh thank the Lord for that. Amen. Also, I know brother Andrew is out ministering. We certainly want to remember him and pray that the Lord will bring him back safe home. Um brother Darian is home not feeling well. We want to keep him in prayer that the Lord will touch him and make him well. Uh also we're going to continue to pray for brother but brother uh Daniel Silas um um uh recovery is we know he had a big surgery. We just pray that the Lord will touch him and will heal him. Uh also sister Lovette was not feeling well. We want to remember her that the Lord will continue to touch her. We know that the enemy is always around, right, trying to fight and is there. But we know we have a God who's able, more than able to heal us in everything that we have need of. So if you have a need upon your heart, why don't you just lift your hand up to him? Amen. We invite the brothers that are taking the offerings for the matter of sake if you could just come and take this needs before the church. Let's just all bow our heads and our hearts. Heavenly Father, Lord, we Lord, we just come to you in humility, Lord, knowing you're the answer to it all. Lord, we lift our pastor up to you, Lord. God is over in Zambia. Just asking that you would pour out a blessing upon him, Lord, that he cannot contain. We just love and appreciate all that he does for us, Lord. Just ask that you would bless him, Lord. Lord, as the request was spoken, I thought how we're all homesick. But Lord, we have a precious brother who's at home sick. Just ask that you would restore him, Lord God. We love our brother and just [music] long to see him with us, Lord, worshiping and how he serves your people faithfully. Lord, just ask that you'd go to him now and touch him. Lord, I believe there was another one, a sister, Lord, that was sick. Maybe brother George's wife, I don't remember. Just ask Lord that you would make a house call Lord God. Lord that your power would be made known amongst us Lord. Lord that you'd strengthen us [music] Lord as we look out and see this dark world. We want to run to the light. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. You are the light of the world. You're living in us. Lord, help us to be out amongst the world, shining forth your light. We just ask, Lord, that you would bless any other needs that were spoken, Lord. Lord, that you'd break forth your word. That we would leave here changed. For that's what your word is to do is to change us [music] into your image. We need to be washed by the water of your word. Lord, we know the characters of victory. We ask, Lord, that you'd have the preeminence. We love you and thank you for your mercy and your grace. Jesus name. Amen. And oh oh to Jesus I surrender [music] all to him. [singing] I freely.

All my life [music and singing] you have been so good [music] [singing] with every [music] hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. [music] You have [singing] me through the fire. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Set your testimony this morning. I know [music] I [singing] [music] [music] just worship him. [singing] Thank you, Lord. My [singing] life [music] you have been my [music] [singing] [music] [music and singing] I will sing of the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; I love your voice. I love your voice. [music] Oh, you have led me through the fire [music] [singing] in the darkest night. You are [music] close like no other. [singing] I've known you as a father.

In all my [music] life, in all my [music] life, you [singing] have been faithful. Thank you, Lord. [music] In all [singing] my life, you have been so [music] so good. Every breath [music and singing] that I made will I will sing of the [music and singing] goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for his goodness, &gt;&gt; his mercy, and his grace in your life? I say there's plenty more where that came from [clears throat] there. There's no exhausting his mercy and his grace. And aren't you just thankful when we make a mess of things and we try to figure things out on our own or uh try to go out there and make something of ourselves that we fall and realize that we were nothing when he found us and we're still completely depending upon him every step, every move of the way. We we're just thankful that he allows us as sons and daughters to okay, go ahead. But then his grace and his mercy, he'll pick you back up. And I tell you, there's power in repentance. There's power in confession. And I tell you, the the the the skies of heaven are open for the true believer. And I say that we can just move into those things if we just surrender and just allow him to have his his will and his way in our life. Amen. Let's just go before him. Lord Jesus, we love you. Lord, we're thankful that we would have an opportunity just to be in the house of God again and Lord to sing the songs of Zion and Lord just to pour our heart out to you and to tell you how much we love you and thank you Lord and that by divine promise Lord you would be in our midst Lord just moving amongst us Lord receiving the praise and adoration Lord and that you would draw nigh as we would draw nigh unto you and Lord we've come to this portion now in the service we're depending upon you Lord that you'd could come and take a vessel, Lord, and you would use it to speak your word to your people, Lord. You know where each one is living, where they're at in their life and their journey, what they have need of, Lord. And only you could know the thought and intent of the heart. And [music] your word can come in such a way that it would start to penetrate down into the the soul realm and the uh uh the places that they have need of and to open those doors that have been locked and closed. And maybe they've been afraid and fearful to make a surrender. But Lord, you know how to make the approach. You know how to come to the individual and speak to them in such a way, Lord, where they can start to uh listen to the very word and it would start to discern their thought and intent and and start to speak words of life and encouragement and bring them out of the shadows and out of the darkness. Lord, that your word could illuminate their heart and their life. And Lord, we're just looking that you would do that in a special way this morning, Lord. not something that a man can do but only you could do Lord and you're the same yesterday today and forever. So we just surrender ourselves to you Lord that you would just have the complete control in this service or we commit ourselves to you and ask this blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, if you have your Bibles, we'll read out of First Thessalonians. It's good to be with you. Um Brother Billy has little Evan confused. He's like, "Wait a second. My birthday's today. Well, because Evan and and and my dad share a birthday, which is tomorrow. Um, but uh I just if you send him a double text, Brother David won't mind. So, wish him happy birthday all today and wish him happy birthday all next week, he'll appreciate it. And while you do that, don't don't forget little Evan. You know, one time uh Evan looked over at Grandpa and he said, "I stole your birthday." Well, you know, if anybody could do that, that would be his grandson. Huh. Well, we're just thankful to be here uh wi with you back from a little extended vacation. Uh we just felt in our heart here about a month ago that uh we just wanted to take the family and uh just uh just go on maybe what we would call a little extended vacation. And we were in fellowship with brother Josh Bennett and their church there. and um you know so when you're when you're away for a little bit people start talking and and start asking questions and things but we had an extended vacation out there that was refreshing and we didn't want to lay out of church for for four or five weeks. So, uh, we we just went away and were in service there. And of course, we were happy to be in service for the Lord while we were there and in fellowship. But just wanted to to let you know that, uh, we're we're home and happy to be here and just looking for what the Lord would have for us. And, uh, it's just good to see each one of you. Amen. I hope it's I hope it's reciprocated, but, &gt;&gt; you know, but it's good. We love you. we appreciate you and hold you dear to our heart and uh we want the best for you and God gave us his best and we're just so thankful for that. So we'll just see how the Lord will lead in this this service here and uh just trust in his mercy. Reading out of 1 Thessalonians in chapter 4. I don't know if anybody is in a hurry. Um, but the the same doors you came in are still there. And so if if you have to get up or excuse yourself or something like that, we understand. Uh, but we just want to um we want to give the word preeminence. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16 says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Amen. We pray a blessing on the word. You can have your seats. And also I just want to read a familiar scripture to us. If you'll turn in Revelations chapter 10 and I'd like to read verse 7. I would believe that most of us would know this um by heart. And if you if you don't um stick around a little while and you will. Amen. Is everybody feeling good this morning? &gt;&gt; Even if you're not feeling good, you made it. You know, I I know the devil's pressing me in my body and and uh you know, felt like I got hit by a bus and and maybe maybe that could be upgraded to a Mac truck, but you know, I'm so glad we're not dependent on how we feel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we make it to the house of God. And I I often, you know, I I the way I kind of grew up believing I say grew up from the age of 21 when I was born again. Um you know, I always thought if you were sick, the b best place to be was in the house of God. And I was pretty legalistic about that until I got married and had kids and found out mothers, they have a different way of um approaching things. And you have to realize you have to uh have wisdom and discernment. And and uh it's not always good to bring a a a house full of sick people to the house of God. But I say if it's by revelation, you come on and receive your your your healing. Um but uh but we've made it and I'm sure some of you weren't feeling good but you're here and I believe God has something special for you. Amen. Revelations 10 and verse 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished at heath declared to his servants the prophets. Brother Brandham would say in the lady of church age he says now the age in which we are living is going to be a very short one events are going to transpire very rapidly so the messenger to this lady age has to be here now though perhaps we don't know him as yet but there will surely have to be a time that he becomes known now I can prove that because we have scriptures that describes his ministry first of all the messenger is going to be a prophet he will have the office of a prophet. He will have the prophetic ministry. It will be based solidly on the word because when he prophesies or has a vision, it will always be word oriented and it will always &gt;&gt; come to pass. He will be vindicated as a prophet because of his accuracy. And I tell you, the the world and the militaries, they might have heat seeeking missiles and and they got infrared and and all this night vision. And I tell you that, but there's no greater accuracy than the word of the Lord. He He knows how to find you no matter where you're at and where you're hiding and and all of the unbelief and the sin that you're hiding under, circumstances and generational curses and sin. But God can just he can go and go through all of those things and find you. And and brother Brandon made the statement. He said, "Events are going to transpire very rapidly." And something on my heart that I'd like to speak to you maybe for a title this morning is a chain of events. &gt;&gt; And we have a direction where we're going and I want to use a story uh out of 2 Kings chapter 7 uh to maybe just lay in a a a foundation or an example maybe would be a better word for um how how God has dealt with my heart in a a chain of events. And I don't know how far we'll be able to get um but by God's grace something will be said that'll be a help to you. So if we can just turn in our Bibles to Second Kings chapter 7. I like to hear the the pages turning. If you have your your Bibles uh the book of Kings is it's after Genesis. It's before Revelation if that helps. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges. Am I getting close? I don't know. I might have skipped the chapter you were looking for. Second Kings 7 and verse one. Then Elisha said, "Hear ye the word of the Lord. Thus sayeth the Lord, tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekele, and two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of Samaria." Then a Lord on whose hand the king leaned it answered the man of God and said, "Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be." And he said, "Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shall not eat thereof." And there were four lepers men, four lepous men at the entering in of the gate. And they said one to another, "Why sit we here until we die?" And just in um speaking about a chain of events, the definition Webster would give on this is it's a series of events so related to each other that each one initiates the next or a number of events triggered by the same initial event. So you just can kind of catch by the definition something when when something happens it's in such a way like a domino effect. you know, when when this happens, the next thing happens. And, you know, as I I thought on this thought here, I was uh uh preaching about it and it it, you know, I was reminded of a time I was living in Arizona. I I called it a shoe box on a dirt hill. You know, it was a a nice uh a trailer that I had and and um you know, I was on the phone with with my soon to be uh bride and and I was cooking at the same time. and and maybe that was the first uh step in the chain of disaster is that I was cooking. I don't know. But but as I was cooking, I was on the phone and something was uh getting more attention the other and and and there became a grease fire on the stove and and uh you know and then I I I tried to put uh baking soda on it, but it wasn't baking soda. It was baking powder and and and that doesn't put out a fire like baking soda will. And so now my fire is growing. And then I decided to get a towel and throw the towel on it and the towel wasn't uh uh thick enough. And so that was just adding to the flame and and so um I was just uh here this this fire is growing on the stove and I finally got the great idea that this fire doesn't belong in the house and I was able to grab the handle of that pan and I threw it out the back door. Well, throwing a a a grease fire out the back door in the high desert where there's no water and everything is dry and just like kindling. When that thing hit the ground, there was a whole field of tumble weed and it just went and my my wife, you know, is on the other line. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Everything's everything's good. But it was a ch it was a chain of disaster. You know, one thing led to another and the next thing and before you know it, the whole backyard was on fire. And I'm I'm trying to I don't you know I'm trying to fill up a a trash can in the in the tub, the garden tub, and I'm I'm trying to throw water out the back door. You could just imagine what that looked like. I told you I was You talk about a city on a hill. Everybody around there was looking up. What's going on up there? But you know that was a that was uh some some uh a little uh chain reaction you know and as you think upon this thought here you know the wrong a decision can cause a chain reaction &gt;&gt; or or even neglect or or neglecting to do something [laughter] I can cause a chain reaction as would be another word for a chain of events which is it's a series of escalating negative consequences. If you're speaking about a a chain of disaster or or something, it's it's a series of escalating negative consequences creating a chain reaction of harmful events. Now, as we just move through some of these things, maybe you'll just allow the Lord to speak to you in your life and maybe to think about things. But as I was thinking about a chain of disaster and if you were to even research that of man-made disasters and chain of disasters, you know, some of the things that come up right right away is is there was a nuclear power plant in in uh I believe in Ukraine now um Chernobyl that um you know it it basically uh it blew up and it was something that they the scientists didn't think was actually possible what had happened. But as they did the research and they did the study and found out how could this have happened, it was really a chain reaction of events of of neglecting protocol and and having people maybe there that weren't experienced and they they were going to run a test and and and really what they were doing is they were bypassing all the protocols and everything. And what did it do? It caused a chain reaction to where uh uh where things just got so far down the line when they when they thought they could just shut everything down and and and and and and stop the reaction, it was too late and it actually just detonated and and just blew up and it was a major catastrophe. Another one that is listed is uh called Deep Water Horizon which was a oil drill rigging operation to where once again um they say that there was neglect and and uh there was maintenance and certain things they they hadn't done and it led to one of the the worst uh uh uh disasters oil disasters that the world has ever seen. And and you know when you look at these things you could see while running tests and lack of maintenance and not following protocol and flawed management and and and you know and and all of a sudden in these in these situations when they bypass one step they bypass another. You know you wonder how how are they coming to this place where they're they're they're just they're just sherking uh uh um things that protocols that have been put in place and and this is the order. This is the way to do it. But somehow they lose their sense of urgency. they they become lax and and the maintenance don't matter anymore. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if you don't change the oil in your car, you might be okay for a little while. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Next time I'll do it. Next time I'll do it. Next time." Well, if you do that next time, the next time there won't be a next time. &gt;&gt; You'll find out one time the car is going to say, "Look, I quit." And then you're staring at the car and wondering why in the world is my car not working. is like, you know, I I've had this check engine light on for 6 months. I've been telling you to change or check the oil, and what do we do? We just well, we just neglect it. You just put it off. And and that's exactly how a chain of events or or chain disaster can happen. And and I was just listen thinking about that, you know, a sense of urgency or or getting complacent or getting getting latched. And and that's exactly what brother Brandon would describe the the Ephesian church age as as lacks and drifting. And you'd find that in Revelations 2:4. He said, "Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thou thy first love." You know, if something was left, there was there was an abandonment. Something something that was in the first place, something that you gave honor to, something that you nurtured, something that you loved and and gave your attention to. Now, something is starting to take place to where it no longer has the preeminence. it no longer has the first place, but now all of a sudden you start bypassing or you start allowing other things to get your time and to get your attention and and you and you start to pour yourself and and I'll say it like this, but you you start to have a divided heart to where where you know you you've given so much of your heart to one thing, but now you start to give your heart to other things. And and I could say to have a divided heart is a dangerous place to be because that's exactly what happened to Samson. Samson had a divided heart. you know, he gave his he gave his uhh strength to God, but he gave his heart to Delilah. And so many times, if we're not careful, we give our strength and we give certain things unto God, but there's other areas of our heart and certain things in our life that we don't completely surrender to them. It's because maybe we have a divided heart or we might be like this uh uh battling this this uh a condition of the Ephesian age where where he says something, I have somewhat against it because thou has left thy first love. And the prophet would say this in the Ephesian church age. He said, "The fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the cry for reaching out in the spirit, all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God, it has cooled off and become a bit formal." That is what was happening back there to the Ephesians. They were getting a bit formal. Look at the complaint. They they left their first love. So something else is is creeping in. It's taking their time. It's taking their attention. And and their concern is is maybe not so much uh giving the word the first place. And a a and one decision leading to another decision. &gt;&gt; You you want to know how you get to a place where you don't come to church Sunday night? &gt;&gt; You don't go once. Right? &gt;&gt; I mean I if if you know how you form a habit, it's you keep repeating the process. &gt;&gt; And some people are in a habit of not coming to church on Sunday night because they did it once. And whatever the excuse was not to do it once was good enough to do it again. You see, I remember um as a young Christian, you know, and uh God just made me a certain way. I can be a little bit more legalistic and in time and and and and uh and growth and maturity. I've I uh God's helped uh me to be more balanced. But with that in mind, I I still hold that very uh uh my convictions very uh very real and dear to my heart because I I know my nature and my character and the way I am. I if anybody knows me, I'm kind of an all or nothing kind of guy, you know? I I I like to pour my heart into it. So, if I'm going to miss church on Sunday night, I just might as well not ever go. And some of you have already arrived there, but but I would I was always cautious to know that I have a great enemy in my flesh. And so, I would never want to give it the reason in the first place. And I could remember, talk about being legalistic. I I I I remember I could count on one hand uh uh in the first maybe 10 years of serving the Lord that I had never walked out of a service. Um because I I I uh I believed uh we're in the presence of God and the word is going forth and and I believe that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And and my if I wouldn't want to miss the last out of the World Series, why would I want to miss the very revealed preaching of the word uh coming right to us, you know, and and so that's just the way I am. I'm not trying to force myself on anybody, but but you know, then life happens and and uh you get married and you have kids and you got to take kids out and and you got to do certain things and you know, if you're not careful, you use your kids as an excuse to leave church. Well, that's all right. We're just talking about how we cool off and get laxed &gt;&gt; and how we we don't give give the word the first place and Sunday nights is Wednesday nights and God and his word and praying and listening to the prophet. You know, they're good. I mean, you know, I like to come to church and hear the hear about the gospel, but I got a job, you know. I got a I got a car and a house I got to pay for. Subdivided heart. How do we get to these places? Look at how the prophet is showing what happened to that first church age of how one decision maybe is leading to another. But he says he he he know the complete surrender and dependence on God and his word is no longer the top priority. And then what the world offers and what the world thinks and we start to value uh uh uh its opinions and it starts to influence our decisions. And we could maybe take time. I know I'm moving slowly but uh we could take time and go into Israel and see how Israel did the same thing. They were led by a vindicated prophet, a pillar of fire by day, pillar of fire by night and a and they crossed over by a divine hand uh under the leadership of Joshua, a type of the Holy Ghost to possess the land. But you know what did they do? They started to get their eyes on the things of the world and they wanted a king and they wanted to be like the world and they started to make a decision and a choice that was rejecting God in his provided way. And so uh the brother Brandham would continue to say that that is the history of the church referring to to Israel. He says, 'When it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God, it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially. Now, some of of of of us um maybe have been believing the message longer than others, and I would encourage you young people to go to some of the elders and ask them, "What is Brother Brandham talking about?" Go ask and say, "Well, what what have you seen in our day? What do you mean that? Um, it's not long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially. They change their manner of dress, their attitudes, and their behavior. They get latched. That is what Ephesus means. Relaxed and drifting. Now, I I could take some time on saying, you know what? It used to be wrong for a believer to, you know, it used to be wrong for a believer to wear high heels. It used to be wrong for a believer to wear a tight dress and form fitting clothes. It used to be wrong for for for a believer to watch uh entertainment and movies that are R-rated and have cursing and cursing. It used to be wrong to go to the movie theaters. It used to be wrong to not go to church on Sunday night. It used to be wrong not to be found in the house of God when the when the when the saints are gathered together. It used to be wrong for it. Used &gt;&gt; we we've changed we've changed our attitude. We've changed our approach. &gt;&gt; But it used to be wrong for a sister not to cut her hair. And somehow they still cut their hair. Well, I don't do it. Somebody else do does it. It's contradictory to the word of God. And you don't even have a right to pray. That is the gospel truth. And so when our kids ask us, "Well, so and so cuts their hair." What what am I supposed to tell them? Sometimes I want to tell my kids to go ask you why you cut your hair. I know why you do it. Because the headship's wrong. Now, that ain't my words. I'm just I just say what a prophet taught me. &gt;&gt; But But what's changed, church? What's changed? What What has changed? When 20, 30 years ago, we used to not listen to certain music. We used to not dress a certain way. The sisters didn't want to wear form fitting clothes. But my I I go to places now and I go to camps and things like that and they don't even care as long as they can play sports in it. And and I tell you, you know, you you you you think you gota we we we ought to have some discernment and and and and there's some good things that have been made that that allow us and our sisters to be able to participate in activities that are good for them to be able to do and express themselves as kids. But but don't use that as a license to abandon our godliness a and and our desire to not conform to the world. Now, I'm sorry. I'm just following the leadership of the Lord and what's what a a vindicated prophet has taught me. &gt;&gt; But how do we get to these places? It's a chain of events. &gt;&gt; It's one decision after another &gt;&gt; and then things become acceptable. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we're so revelated, we're so made the rapture that none of this applies to us. If it applied to the first church age, &gt;&gt; oh, we could talk about the signs and the miracles and the works and the vindication of the spirit amongst them. And then we we hardly can identify any of that in our midst. Well, I I I know we're down home living, but I want to make a body change. I want to go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; I want to check up. Oh, I want to see Lord. The Bible says the heart, I believe it says the heart is the most wicked, wicked thing there is. &gt;&gt; It'll deceive you just like it deceives Samson. Samson was deceived. And some of us because we give our strength to God, we're deceived into thinking. But I I pray by the by bringing the word and maybe here in a little bit we can run a little bit faster. But I hope that's okay. Hey, you like the word of God, &gt;&gt; you know, I I would say that if you're a a um a son and daughter of God, you know, he loves you and he corrects those that he loves. So, Brother Brandham would go on to say that the cycle of revival and death has never failed. All you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians, went to church, prayed all night, took to the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit. They left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings. They had reality. But it wasn't too long a time till they began to get enough money to build five new churches. They put a choir in instead of singing unto God for themselves. They put on gowns on the choir. They organized a movement and ran it by man. They soon began to read books they weren't fit to read. Well, we might as well throw in something beside books. We went to websites we shouldn't go to. Come on. I think are are we are we okay? Hey, are we mature enough to allow God to deal with our heart &gt;&gt; that you can let the spirit spell it out? That we we don't have to walk down and a a and and and and you know, just broadcast a bunch of things. You know where you're living. You're a son and daughter of God. You You want to serve him. You want to be pleasing to him. You know, if if you're losing if if Satan's pulling on you where you're like, "May maybe I am losing my first love." Look, we're not talking about condemnation. We're talking about correction. We're talking about repentance because you are going to manifest the word. But we want to we want to be have some sobriety about us to look into our lives and to say if the Lord was to come today, where would he find me? So he says they soon began to read books they weren't fit to read. They let down the bars and the goats came in and took it over. The cry of joy was gone. We could spend some time there. The cry of joy was gone. The freedom of the spirit was gone. Oh, they kept on with a form, but the fire had died down and the blackness of ashes is about all that is left. He said the cycle of revival and death has never failed. So, as churches and individuals, they they begin to to cool off and they start to drift from the absolute. No more fire. No, no, no more no more passion to know his word. No more reaching out into the spirit. Ashamed of the manifestations. Am I talking to somebody? &gt;&gt; Look, I I I don't know. I just know how a prophet taught it. There ain't very many going But I just want to be right &gt;&gt; and I want to go. &gt;&gt; And if God has sent a message and a vindicated prophet to show the air of of the church ages and where each church got off and how he's calling us back uh uh to a total surrender and a total manifestation of the word, then I say, "Oh God, it behooves unto me to say, Lord, forgive me. I repent, Father. Uh make the correction in my life. I want to be right. &gt;&gt; No more fire. Having a form of godliness, but look at the condition that he's painting out of this age of how he said it's it's all died out. And a a and it's just blackness of ashes is about all that is left. And I was just thinking about that. It makes me think of the condition of Lady Oia. how how just gross darkness uh gross darkness upon the people and and how the revival fires were once burning around the country, but you would think that it's all just burnt down. It's it's just like a bunch of ashes and blackness now and chaos and and Lady Osia has just pressed its way into every front. But I want to say that out of the ashes, out of the darkness and out of the blackness, God has called a people to rise up out of the ashes that there would be a people. God always has a representative. Just as Elisha cried out, he said, "Oh, I'm the only one." God said, "No, you're not the only one. I have 7,000 reserved unto me that have not been." God has a remnant. God has a bride. And and I don't care how dark the pressure is and how bad it gets. And and everybody else lets down the standard. And everybody else has a form of godliness. And everybody else is just going to just going to get by the skin of their teeth. And they'll just go to church when they want to go to church. They they'll just listen to a tape when they want to listen to I want to be so sold out and died out to my will that that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come in and taken complete control of my life, of my mind, that it's no longer my will. It's no longer my my wants. It's no longer my desires. That I want to pray. I want to listen to the tapes. I want to listen to the Bible. I need more revelation. Lord, I want a greater revelation of Ephesians and First Corinthians and and Romans and the book of Revelations and Genesis. Oh, it's an everlasting fountain. Lord, I want to know more. We live in an age of information. We give so much of our time to to learning about stuff that don't even matter. &gt;&gt; We've educated ourselves into fields of study that makes no difference. Countless hours of time in studying just because the information is available. When we have an open book, [snorts] am I am I speaking bride language? &gt;&gt; We have an open book. &gt;&gt; For for maybe somebody doesn't know when I say an open book, the truths of the Bible were hidden. Men probed in the book of Revelation. They probed at what the meaning of the scriptures were and they were they were lacking the revelation. But God has sent a vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; to take what was once a closed book of redemption and to tear the seals off and reveal to you who you are and who he is and the hour that we're now living in. &gt;&gt; And you cannot exhaust it. &gt;&gt; But I wonder how much time you've spent on the internet verse your Bible. I wonder how much time you've spent in school. Well, I don't want to use that because I maybe make some people, you know, you can go to school and you can study with the Holy Ghost and don't don't let the devil beat you up on that. We we live in a society where we got to plant our potatoes and we got to go to work. But I say while you're doing it, be attentive to the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and ask the God to use it and look for parallels and types and things and and when it's man's ideas and say, "Man, that is contrary to the word of God." You know, allow that tutor to be there walking with you. But we we we we find out if we're not careful. We allow all these things. But I want to just say in the midst of all the blackness, in the midst of all the darkness, God is calling out a people. He's calling a bride. And the prophet of God would say it like this. But at the opening of the seven seals, Revelations 10, the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on the earth. Manifested in the same way, doing the same things that it did when it was here on earth. Amen. The full maturity of the word being birthed in a people. &gt;&gt; Not not just a knowledge, not just an education, but the full maturity of the word living in the bride by the Holy Ghost. The literal life of Jesus Christ. Come on. That's what the token is. The literal life of Jesus Christ in you. In you. In you. Well, Jesus said you know them by their fruits. If you want to know if it's the literal life of Jesus Christ living out through you, look at your fruits. Look at the things you do. Look at the things you give your time and your attention to. Look, we're not condemning you. We're encouraging you to walk into the inheritance that has been opened up to you by the revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we start to drift. We get laxed. We listen to things we shouldn't listen to. We we listen to music. We I mean, some of us it it I can't I can't believe it. I can't understand it. those things were my struggle. But we have we we have ones that that God has done a work in their life, but they're still listening to worldly music. We we have uh ones amongst us that that you you know there's there's things that you give your time and attention to that Jesus Christ would not give us time and attention to. &gt;&gt; And don't let the devil uh uh lie to you and tell you that, well, I'll just be in this sticky nature and and I got to have fun somehow. I just I I want to tell you, oh, your entertainment should be the Holy Ghost. Your entertainment should be the word of God. Your entertainment should be crying out in the spirit. There ought to be a cry of joy in the believers of the hour, a cry of joy and a moving of the spirit in your life. &gt;&gt; But we've gotten latched. We have a form. But I say we can rise up out of the blackness and out of the chaos. We could rise up like Job from the ashes by revelation that yet in my flesh I'll see God. We could rise up and know that we are living in the hour of the full restoration of the word. Maybe just try to move from some things just to make pace. But just thinking I was listening to modern events made clear by prophecy and just something that's been on my heart, you know, and and here here we we we we want to it behooves us to recognize the the hour in the day that we are now living in. And brother Brandon would take his text uh how the disciples were they were they were walking with the Lord Jesus. And he he comes up to him and and and and and you know uh you know starts to talk to him and and you know why are you so sad? why are you so down? And they start to explain to him, well, you know, uh, with the Jesus Christ, the the Messiah, the one which was was to come and and now they've they've killed him and and he's gone and and we don't know what to do. And and and just to think now that they are walking with the resurrected word &gt;&gt; and they're sad. I got to go back to church to go back to work tomorrow. I got to pay the bills. You know, the prophet's been gone for 60 years and we're going to go in a rapture someday. I thought, you know, I thought I thought the squeeze would have done this or that and I'm just being squeezed and my head hurts. There's no big great manifestations. I'm It's just little old me. Oh, fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. They they were walking in the greatest hour. They were walking in the greatest moment. The spoken word that had been made flesh had now fulfilled the the prophecies that had been spoken of him. He's now been resurrected and he's walking with them. And the disciples are there wondering and downtrodden because they don't recognize the hour in which they are living. And if you my I just say you would if you would go listen to events made clear by prophecy. Uh he's showing that the very words that have been spoken in the written word in the Bible prophesied in the day that we are now living have been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Modern events made clear by prophecy. And and just as uh just as the prophet fulfilled the scriptures it was prophecies confirmed. I want to tell you that you are also prophecy confirmed &gt;&gt; because we can stand here now according to a vindicated prophet who has spoken about a many membered bride body that would live out the fullness of the word that has been spoken. Look, you're called to put demons under your feet. You're you're you're called to lay hands on the sick and they recover. You're called to know the mysteries. You're called to speak to the mountain. You're called to possess the land. You're called to an inheritance. And I say there ought to be a people. You are not downtrodded. You are not wondering. You are not guessing. You're not uh this God's not coming up to you and say, "Why are you so sad?" But there's a people that the cry of joy is in their hearts. They are on fire for the revelation of the hour. And there's no demon. There's no doubt. There ain't no preacher going to shut this son of God up because I know who I am. I got a revelation of the hour that I am now living in. I will put death under my feet. I will put every demon under my feet. There won't be no anxiety. There won't be no depression. There won't be no generational curses. There will be nothing to hold me down there. I'm telling you, I know who I am. And I know whom I am believed in. And I am persuaded. There ain't no height. There ain't no depth. There ain't no demon. There ain't no devil. There ain't no trial that's going to keep me out of my promised land. I will be like Caleb. Give me my mountain. I am a son of God. [screaming] I was birthed here and lad for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To take my inheritance. &gt;&gt; I won't back up. I won't quit. And I won't sit down. &gt;&gt; I know who I am, and I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; They didn't recognize the hour in which they were living. Scripture says in Galatians 6:7, "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he also reap. For he that sweth to his flesh shall also of the flesh reap corruption. But he that sweth to the spirit shall also of the spirit reap life everlasting." Oh, I want to just say the the words that have been spoken by Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:3 is the spoken word being made flesh in you. &gt;&gt; You are the royal seed of the word. &gt;&gt; And and what did God tell Abraham? He said,"Abraham, I I've given you a promise. Rise up and walk through the land." &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Abraham. Rise up and walk through the land. Look, if somebody could number the dust of the earth, that's what your seat will be. Look to the right. Look to the left. Look forward and back. I give it all to you. Rise up and walk through the land. I tell you, why are we sitting around? Why are we sitting idle? Why aren't we rising up? Why aren't we walking? Is it because we don't recognize the promise? Prophet of God said, he said, "Rise and walk through the land because you possess it all." He said, "As we become Christians and filled with the Holy Spirit, we're seeds of Abraham and heirs of every promise. So just walk through the land. Every bit of it is yours." &gt;&gt; But so many times we look at the opposition. It's a I mean, this message is real. Glory to God. This message is real. But there's some giants in there. I mean, I I meant not me. I need a David or a Joshua. &gt;&gt; You are David or Joshua. &gt;&gt; Those were all shadows and types. &gt;&gt; Well, I could preach there for a while. There's a quote where Brother Brandon says, "All of those were just shadows and types of what God was wanting to do." Look, just as Satan came into God's Eden &gt;&gt; and caused his family to fall, God has raised up his family and Satan's Eden is [screaming] causing them to be overcomers, &gt;&gt; causing them to overcome the God of this evil age, causing you to overcome your weaknesses, causing you to overcome your failures, causing you to go to the school and the highways and the workplaces and be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; God wants to use you. Wait, where's the cry of joy? See that Abraham and Jo I mean Joshua and Caleb, they had a cry of joy. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. It's a good land flowing with milk and honey. Let's go into it. &gt;&gt; You would think the same God that brought him out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; What about the same God that's been keeping you? Come on, young people. &gt;&gt; The same God that's been keeping you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young and old, like the same God that's been keeping you in the most wicked age. You're still here. You could have given up. You could have ran off. You could have ran off with that boy or that girl, but you didn't. &gt;&gt; When you might have wanted to, but something's been keeping you. Something's been watching out over your life because you're a seed of God. You're a gene seed thought of God. God had a thought of you, an expression of you, and he placed you in this hour, knowing what he put inside of you that when you would catch the revelation of who you are, you would defeat the very enemy that's trying to take you down. Now I just try to as we're move getting close out of time I want to move into maybe our thought here. So when Elisha in our text spoke thus sayith the Lord he said tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekele and two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of Samaria. I just want to say that that was the power of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. that there was nothing that could stop the power of prophecy that had been spoken. And I I don't have the time to lay this in there, but but you have a place and you have a position and you are part of that word that has been spoken. &gt;&gt; And and the devil tries to make you doubt that part. He he tries to to make you doubt your inheritance and your portion in the word and and he tries to strip you of the inheritance that God has given to you and tries to make your portion so small and so little. It's just to go to church here and there and it's it's just to listen here and there. But I want to tell you, you you have been called and and raised up to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You have an inheritance that that cannot be exhausted. &gt;&gt; Well, is that okay? &gt;&gt; Or do we just, you know, is it is it too hard? &gt;&gt; Let's just pack it in. You know, lady is too hard. It's too hard. You know, there's too much entertainment. There's too much music. too much on the cell phone. You know what? Maybe that's what we ought to do. We ought to compromise. I mean, you know, we believe the message. If after all, we're bride. You know, if we're bride, we're bride. I can change that. You know, after all, if my name was on the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world, there's nothing I could do to miss it anyway. So, you know, it's hard not to It's hard not to to look and to lust. It's it's, you know, I it's it's hard not to to watch entertainment. It's not It's hard not to get caught up in sports. It's It's hard not to allow the fashion. So, we'll just let's just find Let's just cross over a little bit. &gt;&gt; Borderline believers. &gt;&gt; Borderline believers. Some of us are just right on the border. You've had an experience. God's done something wonderful in your life. You believe God's had a pro God sent a prophet and you've crossed over, but we've stopped. We've we sat down. We we've manifested a portion of the word, but God want to wants to manifest the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; And we could take time to go into it, but we've seen what that looks like in a first one to maturity. &gt;&gt; But sometimes the giant in our land is what we think is impossible. &gt;&gt; Oh, I could never. &gt;&gt; I I I could never. Brother Brandham could have never either. Do you realize, brother Brandham, it it was because of his part and his portion &gt;&gt; that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world that brought him into his position? &gt;&gt; It wasn't something Brother Brandham decided to do. &gt;&gt; What happened at the age of seven? A whirlwind got caught up in a tree and said, "Don't defile [screaming] your body. Don't drink or smoke or do anything for I have a work for you to do. Did brother Brandham try to drink? &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; Did he try to smoke? &gt;&gt; Did he try to commit suicide &gt;&gt; twice? &gt;&gt; And then we're over here. Well, I'm not the bride because I drink. I'm not the bride because I can't be the bride because I'm having thoughts of suicide. Let God minister to somebody's heart right now. If the prophet could can come into a place of such agony and discouragement, what about a people who's caught a vision of the greatest word that has ever been spoken and you know that I am the individual that spoke to walk into the fullness of that word, but then we got all these little things hanging on to us. generational curses and abuses and things we went through as a child where you were taken advantage of and spirits have followed you around with depression and doubt and things of agony and it makes you question your calling to where you just want to give up and quit. No different than the prophet of the age. But there was something following his life. No matter when he wanted to give up, no matter when he wanted to quit, there was a pillar of fire that was following him. And there's a pillar of fire following you &gt;&gt; to bring you into every promise. &gt;&gt; That ought to be a cry of joy. That ought to make somebody shout &gt;&gt; to know I couldn't even mess it up. When I tried to give up, when I did this or that &gt;&gt; see when Elisha had spoke, thus said the Lord, nothing could stop it. And brother Bannon said this just to lay this in there. He said, "As long as your seed inside growing, you have to produce just exactly what the seed said you would do." &gt;&gt; That's exactly it's his word. &gt;&gt; He keeps his word. &gt;&gt; He watches over it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's watching over me. &gt;&gt; I said he's watching over me. When I was out there in the world, he was watching over me. When I got in that car wreck, he was watching over me. When I was in that drug house, he was [screaming] watching over me. When I was in that jail cell, he was watching over me. When I made my worst decision of my life, he was watching over me. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. I say, do you know grace? &gt;&gt; Grace who? The grace of God, &gt;&gt; he's watching over you &gt;&gt; because you are his word, his thought. &gt;&gt; He He's He's watching over you. You have to produce just exactly what the seed said you would. First Thessalonians says, "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it." &gt;&gt; Does anybody feel the call of God in your life? &gt;&gt; It's his calling. &gt;&gt; Is he calling you to live a higher calling? &gt;&gt; Do Do you know when you do wrong and you listen to things and you do things and you wear things and you do all these things, you know you shouldn't do something inside of you say, "Well, &gt;&gt; I I know I shouldn't." &gt;&gt; He's calling to you. Satan wants to condemn you. Christ is calling you &gt;&gt; and he's telling you if I'm calling you, I will do it. &gt;&gt; Well, you got to surrender to it. You got to let him do it. He's a gentleman. &gt;&gt; Now, I just, you know, we we'll try to be about 20 more minutes and find a place to close. But hold that in your in your in your thought. And I just maybe for a quick moment I want to help somebody because sometimes we allow our humanity to get in the way of walking into the promises of God. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Is everybody still with me? &gt;&gt; Do we need to take a recess? &gt;&gt; Sometimes or all the time because this is our worst enemy. It's our humanity, right? just like those children of Israel. It's a it's a good land. It's a good word. I believe it, but but I can't &gt;&gt; I can't possess it. &gt;&gt; I I'm not able. And and Brother Brandham said, "If you watch the natural birth, it's more of a mystery than the virgin birth. &gt;&gt; It's determined whether it's going to be a boy or a girl, redheaded, blackheaded, or what what it's determined by God. And and many times we we we allow our complexes and our and our our family tree and and the and the way things have come to to plague our minds with complexes. A and and our self-esteem can be just riddled and we feel like we're not pretty enough or or we don't look good enough and and I'm too short, I'm too skinny, I'm too big, I'm too wide and and all of these things. Satan will use those to plague your mind, &gt;&gt; causing complexes and fears when if you could accept by revelation, &gt;&gt; you showed up just the way God wanted you to. &gt;&gt; I'm not faster. I can't jump high. I let God deal with somebody's heart because these are real problems that we battle. &gt;&gt; And Satan plagues you in the natural in those realms of complexes and it actually keeps you from walking into the word that's been spoken over your life. &gt;&gt; Help me preach. &gt;&gt; If I say something you believe, just say amen. It won't hurt you. &gt;&gt; You operate the gift. &gt;&gt; If you forgot that, that's what the prophet taught. So if you don't get nothing out of the service, it ain't my fault, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But praise God, individuals can operate it and be blessed and people can go out, man, I didn't get nothing out of that preacher. Don't do nothing for me. And other people can, man, &gt;&gt; like God was discerning the thoughts and intents of my heart. I'm a new person. &gt;&gt; And and you're over there looking like really I didn't I don't The only thing I got out of that was he's a Mcgiri. It's all I could see in them. It happens. But let's move into the word and realize that these complexes and these things in our life and and and the way we look and the way that we were we were born with look generational curses and and people born into situations to where they were taken advantage of as as little kids. And a a a and and look, I'm not out of the message. I'm right there. Brother Brandham discerning the thoughts and intents of that girl that was battling fear and anxiety. And he traced it all the way back to a dog that was chasing her as a little girl. &gt;&gt; And you don't think in the most wicked age that we've ever lived in in the things that our kids are exposed to. Look, it it don't have to be manifested in the flesh. Now, people are being exposed to things digitally that are having the same effects on them. &gt;&gt; And you don't understand why the fear. You don't understand why the anxiety because you've been digitally raped. And I I know that sounds harsh. And I know that sounds That sounds harsh, but if you look at the at the the symptoms and if you look at the behavior of somebody that has been physically taken advantage of, it manifest in somebody that has been digitally robbed of their purity. And that's why uh sisters in the message that that are battling pornography, it just ain't the brothers anymore. And they're battling thoughts of fear and depression and anxiety and self-worthlessness and they want to commit suicide. Why? because they've been exposed to something digitally that's robbed them of their virtue. &gt;&gt; And now that spirit &gt;&gt; follows them and they don't know why &gt;&gt; Satan, you're exposed. &gt;&gt; You can't hold that daughter of God. You can't hold that son of God because the word has gone forth to discern the thought intent of the heart and you can be free in the name of Jesus Christ. Free from the doubt. Free from the unbelief. Free from the anxiety. Free from the curse of your past because the blood of Jesus Christ has come to break the generational curses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you see, it starts a chain reaction is what we're laboring at. How one little exposure, one little thing as a kid can cause a chain of reaction and form a thought, form a nervousness and situations and panic attacks where you can hardly breathe and you feel like your life is going to end. That's a spirit. &gt;&gt; But the word can catch it and discern it and expose it. And I want to tell you the word of God will be defeat the devil any place on any grounds on any time. Satan you are defeated. &gt;&gt; Greatest battle ever fought. I was just thinking about this. The problem is a lot of times we stop and listen. &gt;&gt; Is everybody feeling okay? &gt;&gt; Many times we stop and listen. We're we're going along and God's done a wonderful work in our life and and we're on fire for God and and we're walking we're walking down the road and and now we're doing good and all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; Oh, I used to go there. Oh, that's where so and so. Yeah. You know what? I wonder what they're up to. Nowadays, it does. It's not the barroom. It's not the dance room. It's the internet. &gt;&gt; It's Instagram and Facebook. Look, Nelly Sanders. You know the story about Nelly Sanders? She had to physically stop and walk up to the place where she used to socialize. &gt;&gt; But now all you got to do is log on to whatever the new and improved thing is. &gt;&gt; Tell a young person about Facebook, they're like, "Man, you're a dinosaur. &gt;&gt; What is it? What's the new platform?" &gt;&gt; Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Tik Tok, Instagram, Snapchat. Is there Is there What's the new and upcoming one? &gt;&gt; What? Well, that that that took a name name change, right? All of those things. All you got to do, I wonder what so and so is up to now. &gt;&gt; You better watch out. &gt;&gt; You You might be in danger of losing your first love. &gt;&gt; How do men and women get into places &gt;&gt; they never should have been because they get a little curious? Well, I wonder how so and so is doing. Watch out. And all of a sudden you're on Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Instagram, [laughter] and all of a sudden you got a divided heart. Oh, hey, I was wondering about you, too. You remember that time miss so and so in class and you fell over the chair? Hey, some of us are going to be over Starbucks. Yeah, maybe I'll witness to them. Exactly what Nelly Sanders did. Maybe I'll just witness. I'll just log in. It's just the 20, 10 year, whatever anniversary of my class. I'll just Well, I don't know where we're at, but we're here. And all of a sudden, before Nelly Sanders knew it, she was right back in there in the arms of another man. &gt;&gt; Chain reaction. &gt;&gt; Chain of events. Stop just to listen. &gt;&gt; I'll just testify. I'll just look. I'll just say hi. I'll just I'll just I'll just &gt;&gt; Some of us there's been a chain reaction that has started in your life from I'll just &gt;&gt; and you're in bondage. She come uh running down to brother Brandham's house. I want to tell you at least she knew where to go. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. At least she knew where to run to. I want to tell you, if you ever get in trouble, if you ever find yourself out somewhere where you don't belong, I want to tell you there's a place you can run to, and it don't have to be a house down the street. You can run into the arms [screaming] of Almighty God. He'll wrap his arms around you. He'll tell you, "I forgive you." &gt;&gt; She knew where to run to. She ran down to Brother Brandham's house and pounded on the door. And brother Brandon had taken in his friend Wayne who was a drunk. He was trying to get him to sew her up. And Nelly come banging on the book door. Brother Brandon, brother, brother. Brother, brother, I've done it. I blew it. I've gone too far. I've I I I've messed it all up. He said, "Nelly, calm down. What's wrong? What's wrong? I just stopped to listen. I just stopped to listen." And before you knew it, &gt;&gt; God's talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; If you're tired and falling asleep, just stand up. &gt;&gt; You'll make everybody think you're into the service. Right? [clears throat] And he started praying for her. And brother Brenn said, "I don't know much about the Bible, but one thing I do know." And he started to cast that evil spirit out. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "You spirit, whatever you are, she didn't mean to do that. &gt;&gt; But you come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ. You can't hold her any longer. And I want to say the same message of the hour has come and said you were trapped into it. You didn't mean to do it in the first place. Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. Come out of her. She didn't mean to do it. &gt;&gt; Hey, I needed a message like that. &gt;&gt; And I needed a message when I got all messed up and I made a mess of things and I made a bad mistake. I know where to run into the arms of [screaming] Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, some of us are just bound. Just bound. Just bound by circumstance. The cry of joy is gone. &gt;&gt; It's just gone. &gt;&gt; The cry for the manifestation of the move of the spirit, it's just gone. We're tired of fighting for it. We're tired of believing for it. &gt;&gt; I ain't wrong &gt;&gt; because we start losing our first love &gt;&gt; and we start to invest our time and our attention and our effort in other things. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm just saying what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; But you can be liberated. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be free. &gt;&gt; You can catch the revelation. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to get to this place. &gt;&gt; That you can run to the message of the hour and you can be restored. Right on time. Maybe somebody here, you stopped for a moment and you wonder how you got here. I want to tell you there's another voice. There's a voice of prophecy. There's a prophetic word that has been spoken over your life. And I would just want to say as we're going to start moving towards a close that you are called to be that word &gt;&gt; made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hey, shake yourself now. Hit your neighbor and say, "Wake up. Wake up." &gt;&gt; Now hit the other neighbor. Say, "Wake up. &gt;&gt; Wake up." &gt;&gt; Shake yourself. It It's We're in extra innings, overtime. You don't want to miss a walk-off, do you? &gt;&gt; Come on. I say it's, you know, they they they Oh my I don't want to go there. But anyhow, I know where we're going. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for it. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody's awake now. &gt;&gt; You know, I like what Brother Zachary Wallace said one time. He said, uh, he said, "I figured if I put him to sleep, I'm responsible for waking him up." I was like, "I'm gonna borrow that one." So, if I wake you up, I apologize. I put you to sleep. But just just moving in this line of how remember, we're talking about a chain of events or a chain reaction about how one decision can lead to another and it can cause a chain reaction. And now we're looking at when when God spoke, when his word was spoke and it was prophesied, it was going to cause a trigger or or set something in motion that could not be stopped. And I could just read uh uh uh uh scriptures and and prophecies that have been spoken out over your life where where where in Romans it would say, if you've been predestinated, if you're predestinated, you're you're called you who who he's called. Come on. That's a prophetic word that has been spoken over your life that look, if he called you, he's going to justify you. If he's justified you, he's going to sanctify you. If he sanctified you, he's going to glorify you. And Paul goes on to say, look, if God before us, then who can be against us? Then I I like to say it like this. The devil, he ain't got enough. If God before us, devil, you ain't got enough to stop the spoken word of God from being manifested in my life because something has already been triggered. Something has already been spoken. It will move mountains. It will fill valleys. It will beat every demon. It will beat everything away to make sure that I can step into my inheritance of what has been spoken over my life. And I realize as a son, what I got to do is just come into a greater humility, a greater surrender. And the more that I can surrender, the more he'll fill my life, that I can walk into every divine promise of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here we are and finally to my sermon and we'll just ask God to help us here. Feel free if you need to excuse yourself. Second Kings 6:25. So, here we are into our text and we'll try to by the help of God if 10 15 minutes. We've been about an hour and seven minutes. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; It's 11:55. We'll try to we'll try to have you out of here soon. But just by the help of God here, I want to use this story because in 2 Kings 6:25, this is just uh um I believe a little before our text if if I remember, but he said because it's talking about this great famine that was in Samaria and Samaria had been besieged and then it says that a donkey's head was being sold for four score pieces of silver &gt;&gt; and a fourth part of cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver. &gt;&gt; Wow. So I I just want you to maybe try to understand what's happening here in the king of Samaria. This is when the kingdom had been divided. You had the kingdom to the south which was Judah and you had the kingdom to the north which was called uh Israel. And Samaria was the capital of the the northern kingdom. And you go all the way back after Solomon, it was split uh in two and God reserved two tribes for for David's sake uh uh uh Judah and Benjamin. And then the other 10 were given uh to the northern portion of Israel. And that's where this we're finding this story is setting in Samaria. And now um um I'm forgetting uh that the the king now that has come um and surrounded and besieged uh um Samaria. And so what that means is the armies have come down and now it's during a famine and they've surrounded Samaria. So you can't come in or out. So what whatever rations or whatever food or whatever water that you had inside the walls is all you had. And now the famine and the time is getting so bad to where you for $2,000 you could buy the head of a donkey. Anybody want to go have lunch? &gt;&gt; I got the head of a donkey for $2,000. People were were starving. &gt;&gt; Remember a donkey was an unclean animal. Some people wouldn't even eat that. But when but when your your kids rib cages start sinking in and you're eating rocks and you're eating grass, it's amazing what a starving man will do to where when you you keep following this this this story here. These people are are are starving. They're surrounded by the enemy. It's just there's there's no hope for them. I mean, you talk about a time of trouble. And I want to preach on that a little bit of time of trouble, but we ain't got time for it. You can make that parallel yourself. get into Psalms 27 and listen to the rapture. But it's in the time of trouble, right? So, here they are in a time of trouble. So much so, everybody still here? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So much so that the people were boiling their own children and eating them. And it just came about that time here in our story where where this lady she comes she comes to the king and starts to tell him like uh oh king oh king and he finally listens I need your help and the king's like what I what am I going to help you out of am I going to help you out of the wine press? Am I going to help you out of the wheat gardeners? I he said if God don't help you no one can help you. And she said well I help me help me help me. He said stay on. And she said, "Look, me and this woman, we made an agreement that that yesterday we would eat my child and today we would eat hers and we boiled mine and did eat and today when we were supposed to boil hers and eat and the king ran his clothes and he actually got mad and upset at Elisha because now Elisha, he had the authority to call for rain. He he he he made an axe head float. He he he made a barrel not run dry. He he he did all these wonderful miracles and now the people of God are suffering and a a a and a and a famine's been called for. And so what he you know what he starts to do? He starts to get mad at God's prophet. Ain't that just like the people today when things don't go your way and when things aren't adding up the way they you just want to blame the message and you want to blame the word of God and say, "Well, maybe the message ain't everything that I thought it was. I didn't think I'd be c persecuted. I didn't think my family would walk away from me. I thought it would convert my husband. I thought it would convert this. I thought it would save my I thought it would do all this. And then in a time of trouble, when everything's heaping up against you, and you're you're so mad and angry that this healing didn't come and you lost that loved one, and if you're not careful, you'll take an attitude towards the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what this king did. He said, "Oh, more so be also to me if the head of Elisha, the son of Chafat, shall stand on him this day." Imagine the attitude he took towards the the the man of God. And if we're not careful in a time of trouble, we we start to take an attitude towards the word of God. But I want to remind you of what our text says. It says Elisha said, "Hear ye the word of the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord tomorrow about this time." See, he sent a messenger that had come to tell or kill Elijah. And when and when that messenger from the king came, the word of the Lord was spoken. And he said, "Hear the word of the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord, tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekele and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria." Then a a Lord on whose hand the king lean answered the man of God and said, "Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?" &gt;&gt; He doubted. the word of the Lord. Oh, if these things would be us going a body change, me going a rapture, the rapture be on. If God would do this, you see what he's saying? He said, "Oh, if the windows would be made, if windows were made in heaven, how could this thing be?" And listen to what he said. Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eye, but shall not eat thereof. And I want to tell you, if we let this spirit of Nick Leighton or we let this spirit of losing thy first love, you'll have gone to the message church, you'll been in the message camps. You would heard a vindicated prophet. You'll hear about the rapture and all of these things that have been prophesied. In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, you shall be changed. There will be people that will actually see it, but won't partake of it. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we get latched, if we just drift, if we just say, "Well, well, well, well, just a little bit this or that." Your unbelief can cause you to miss it. &gt;&gt; Hey, I know it's a paradox, but look, God, deal with your heart that way. &gt;&gt; So, just bringing this to a close quickly. We're talking about a chain of events. And that's where a lot of our problems are is from a series of events or decisions that we've made. Maybe you've stopped reading your Bible. Maybe you've stopped going to to church. Maybe maybe you stop listening to the tapes. One decision after another. But I just want to end on this note. If it can happen in the negative, &gt;&gt; what about in the positive? &gt;&gt; Because my Bible tells me in 2 Kings 7:3, "And there were four lepous men at the entering of the gate, and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die? Why am I going to sit here in this church any longer and just service after service and die? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I could preach a little bit about the valley of dry bones. &gt;&gt; Where once there was life, there's no more life because it's just a a valley of dry bones. And then as the story goes on, they're all sitting rank and file with a blank stare. What? It's a congregation of the dead. &gt;&gt; Well, I've been there. I'm preaching. I'm preaching. I'm preaching. And some people are responding. But there's some people that sit in their pew and they're just dead with a blank stare on their face. They don't know what you're talking about. Just just come to church, go out of church, go to work, go to this, go to that. But I want to tell you, there gots to be a resurrection. There gots to be something that catches you. There got to be something that changes you. You ain't got to sit there till you die. I say there ought to be a revelation like those lepous men who were between two straits. It looked bad. It looked dark. But they said, "We're going to die anyways. Why sent you here until we die?" &gt;&gt; And this is what I want to leave with you here. This the prophecy had been spoken, but little did these lepers know they were a link in prophecy. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they went down there and God honored that little speck of dingy faith and not only delivered them, but they delivered Israel. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the power of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord about this time. &gt;&gt; They went down to the enemy's camp. And God, because he had spoken a word, had scattered the enemies. They were all gone. And I tell you what, they went down to the enemy's camp and they started getting marooting around in there and they found some gold. They found some silver. They found some joy. They found some peace and they started to heap it up and they started to stash it and they started to put it over here. They dug this hole. They dug that hole. They filled up everything they could fill up. And they realized there's so much more than I could ever contain. They said, "You know what? We don't do good. Why don't we share it with the house of God? let's go on down to Israel and let them know, hey, we came into the camp of the enemy. And there's spoils for everybody. And everybody was able to run into the the the the the camp of the army and take as much joy and take as much peace and take as much of everything that they had need of. And the prophet of God said, "We are not invited to the enemy's camp this morning, but we are invited into the father's house." And I want to tell you, our father owns a cattle on a thousand hills. There's love, there's joy, there's peace, there's deliverance, there's everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What about the day and hour that we're living in? Just a few more minutes. What about the day and hour that we are now living, church? &gt;&gt; You are part of that word and you are a link &gt;&gt; in the chain. of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Lord shall descend from heaven &gt;&gt; with a shout. &gt;&gt; It was a triggering event. &gt;&gt; It was a chain reaction. Zechariah 14:7, "But it shall be one day which it shall be known unto the Lord, not day nor night, but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light." The prophet said at the evening time events are made clear by the prophecy. What is taking place in the modern hour can easily be identified if you'll just believe the prophecy of the hour. &gt;&gt; Not just a prophecy of 1960 or 1950, but there's a prophetic word for this hour that we are now living. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to a close. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. Croak darkness upon the land. But the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. &gt;&gt; Look, a chain of disaster, a chain of destruction and judgment for the world for Lady Osia. But what about the pride? &gt;&gt; The immune physicians would come. But that's not an excuse for for everybody to get up and go to the bathroom. So just hold on. I want to talk to some of you that want to go to the bathroom. Luke 17:29. But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. &gt;&gt; Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. Matthew 25, I'm talking about a Lincoln prophecy. I'm talking about a prophetic word. Matthew 24:27 says, "For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even under the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be. For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to tell you the capstone is here. The mighty angel has descended. Revelations 10 1-7. The ancient of days, the wicked one, the judge, Christ has come down and he's standing present amongst us. [screaming] The Lord shall descend with a shout. It has triggered an event. It's triggered the rapture. And you are a link in prophecy. You are the link in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." &gt;&gt; Look what what what's happening in your life, in your family. It might look like the odds are stacked against you. It might look like there's no way for me to fulfill the rapture. I wanted to sing that song uh speak to the mountain. &gt;&gt; There's no way I can possess the land. There's no way I can go into there's no way I can it's too dark. My my family situation it's it's [screaming] too bad. &gt;&gt; I can't even see. I can't even see. Brother Matthew, I I I can't even make it. I feel like I can't even make it another 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't even see this far in front of me. &gt;&gt; Don't fear, little sister. &gt;&gt; There's a man here who can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; And his name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's time for you to act out your part of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, you do all the planning and everything for for a play and and everybody studies and they all prepare and they make all the props and and they get everything in order and you've studied and you've studied over and over and to learn your part and and now it comes your time and now the stage is set and now it's your turn to walk in there [clears throat] and to play your part. and you go mind blank and everybody's staring at you and all the time and all the preparation and you feel I I've let everybody down. I had one simple phrase, behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. And I couldn't even get that right. But you know what? [snorts] The conductor's there. The playwriter's there. And he has the scripts and he's right there. Said, "It's okay. Go ahead. If you forgot your line, let me tell you again. It's the invisible union of the bride of Christ. Oh, that spiritual union of Christ in his church. Now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested &gt;&gt; vindicated. &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; It it it's your time. It's your turn. Brother Brandon played his part. Me many of those brother Biscll and and they they ran their race. They fought a good fight. They've crossed over. Now, &gt;&gt; you're the link in prophecy. Brother Ber said, "You're part of the word cuz he was the word at the beginning. &gt;&gt; You're the word now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Church, why sit? We here till we die." &gt;&gt; We got a part to play. &gt;&gt; We got a rapture to go into. &gt;&gt; I am not worried about Lady Osia. I am not worried about my job. I am not worried about my car. I am not worried about my bills. Sorry, bill collectors. You're on the spam call. I I'm not worried about that. My debt has already been paid. All of my sins have already been paid for. When Jesus Christ said, "It is finished." He washed me in the bleach blood, bloody word [screaming] of the lamb. And now I am free. I have been loosed. Now I can play my part. I don't have to worry about generational curses. I don't have to worry about my past. I don't want to have to worry about the things that I've done. But oh, there's been a bleeding bloody word that has come and said, "It's your turn. It's your time. I've washed you. I've cleansed you. I've set you apart. I've called you for this purpose. You are the link in the prophecy. You are the link in the rapture. It's time to play your part. It's time to cry it [screaming] out. &gt;&gt; It's time to speak to your mountain." &gt;&gt; Come on. And I say it's time to get the cry of joy back in the believer's heart. &gt;&gt; I am the bride. [screaming] I am going in a rapture. I can do all things. I shall do the greater works. &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you something. There were lepers one time said at the gate. They said, "Why do we sit here till we die? Let's do something about it. Make an effort. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; Make an effort. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; Make an effort. &gt;&gt; Get up. [screaming] Make an effort. Get up. Make an effort. Get up. Make an effort. Get up. Make an effort. Get up. Make an effort. Get up. Make an effort. Get up. [screaming] Make an effort. Are you hearing the prophet? Make an effort. Get up. up. [screaming] &gt;&gt; The doctor's done all they can do. Everybody's done all they can do. God's done all he can do. And the next thing is do is for you to act and let your faith go to work in God's word. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the condition, &gt;&gt; regardless of the opposition, you shall possess the gate &gt;&gt; of your enemy. &gt;&gt; I say, rise up from the ashes. Come up higher. Move into the stature of a perfect man. Move into that perfect faith. Be therefore perfect, even as your heavenly father is perfect. Let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who thought it not robbery, be equal with God. Why should I worry when giants come calling my name? Oh [singing] my God is big, bigger than the troubles. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] &gt;&gt; for power or riches or fame. My [music] God is so [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; be shen I won't be moved. My God is faithful. [music] Speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time to move. Cuz my God [music] is bigger, better, stronger, and greater than you. Well, now my enemies scatter cuz they know the battle [music] is done. Oh, and my God is stronger.

[music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know what else to say but hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm going in a rapture. The mighty angel has already descended. The triggering events, the chain of reaction has already started. &gt;&gt; Look, when the book was opened, he called my name. &gt;&gt; I heard from my theophony. I &gt;&gt; I saw something soaring in the heavens. I said, "Mama, how do I get up there? &gt;&gt; Just jump. Just start. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just get up. [screaming] I don't know how. &gt;&gt; Just flap your wings. &gt;&gt; Just try. &gt;&gt; Somebody going to try. &gt;&gt; Just start flapping your wings. &gt;&gt; I am the bride. &gt;&gt; Okay, you you made a mistake. Try again. &gt;&gt; I'm going in a rapture. I can speak to the mountain. &gt;&gt; I'm in an invisible union with Christ the word. [screaming] &gt;&gt; If you fall down, &gt;&gt; get back up. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "If you can just get started, &gt;&gt; he said it's your it's your attitude, your approach." &gt;&gt; He said, "If you can have the right attitude and the right approach," he said, "If you can just get started, God will do the rest." &gt;&gt; Hey, I I'm already started. I'm thinking of a rapture. &gt;&gt; I've already started. You know what that means? He's going to do the rest. &gt;&gt; Gary, God is going to transform my body. [music] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm thinking of a rapture. &gt;&gt; Well, I am thinking of a rapture in our blessed home. Oh, and the redeemed are gathering. Oh, and how we'll raise the heavenly anthem in the [music] city in the sky. Oh, when the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, hallelujah. When the redeemed [music] are gathering in, oh, wash like snow and free from all [music and singing] sin. And I will shout and I will sing [music] praise the Lord where every day are gathering.

Every day I gather in. Oh, wash like snow [music] and free from all [singing] sin. Well, I will shout and I will sing praise the Lord when [music] Hallelujah. Brother David, if you can come dismiss us in prayer. I don't know about you, but I'm not just thinking about a rapture. I'm living in rapture. Say, "Brother Matthew, what are you talking about?" Well, I've heard from my theophony, &gt;&gt; and something has already been triggered. There's a chain of events that's already started in my soul, &gt;&gt; and I'm already seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And because he's given me an ear to hear, the word which I am hearing is becoming flesh in me. &gt;&gt; The word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming word. &gt;&gt; I say, aren't you thankful for that? God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I was just reading Matthew 22 this morning. And there was a a an invitation that was sent out to come to a wedding supper. And there was many who had many excuses why they wouldn't come. But if they would have recognized the opportunity and what was set before them that day, they wouldn't have sat there and died, but they would have heeded the invitation. What a beautiful message we've heard this morning. &gt;&gt; It is a come and dying call. It's it's it is a chain of events. see your name written in that book of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Recognize your day and the opportunity and say, "That's for me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take that for me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to want transformation in my life." &gt;&gt; Let's just go before him. Heavenly Father, thank you for a a message that would come and speak grace and liberty to your children. Lord, where we fallen, Father, your word and grace much more did abound. Lord, where the enemy would have come and tried to sow doubt and discouragement and failure, Father, a more sure word of prophecy has been spoken over us this morning, Lord, calling us your own, calling us bride, telling us where we're going, our destination, and all the things that are ours, Father. Lord, may we recognize your voice to us, Lord. Your love call to us, Lord, that you're my bride and your bone of my bone, your flesh of my flesh, Lord. And Lord, I'm going to rise and say, I'm not looking at the failure, Father. I'm not looking at the voice of the enemy. I'm not looking at this very flesh, Father, but I'm looking at the things you've spoken of me, Lord. I'm an overcomer, Lord. I'm victorious. I'm not going to sit in in lukewarmness. I'm not going to sit, Father, in complacency. I'm not going to sit and look at the failures of the past, Father. I'm not going to even look at the things I might have done this this very morning that testify differently than what your word speaks of me, Father, but I'm going to reflect you, Father, in the fullness of your word. I'm going to be your bride made manifest. I'm going to be your image, Lord. I'm going to be a voice of salvation to a dying world, Lord. I'm going to rise, oh God, and I'm going to give you the glory because you said, "Arise and shine, for thy light has come." Lord, I've seen your light and I must reflect it, Lord. I've got to declare you, Father. Lord, for you predestined me to me to do that. Lord, we want to thank you, Father, for this word. We ask that you be with brother Matthew that you would strengthen them, Lord. The labor of faith, Lord, to speak, Father, your word of life to your people, Lord. We're going to speak it. Though there would be no evidence that may testify to it, we're going to recognize on the absoluteness of your word that you've spoken it and it must come to pass. So, we're going to praise you, Father. We're going to praise you before there's maybe not even one speck of life showing. We know we've heard from the lifegiver, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, and we're going to glorify you, Father. So now, as we go, be with each one. May your Holy Spirit just brood out after us, Father. Bring our pastor home safe to us. We commit it all to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are worthy [singing] of it all. Amen. You are dismissed. Oh, [singing] you are worthy of it all. For from you are all things, and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. [music] You are worthy of it all. Hallelujah.
