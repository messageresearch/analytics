musicians and uh so I'm going to give you a little update where we are uh uh they're going to start painting tomorrow and uh they're supposed to be done painting uh Saturday so now we have probably 150 different paint color choices sitting in here you know and you know I know somebody would probably want orange walls and pink ceilings but whatever we paint it we're painting it so it's inmaterial and uh so we just you know I'm I'm sure not everybody's going to like it but uh U lesie likes it and uh and so you know happy wife happy life so uh but I I think I think it'll be fine so uh uh we're at that place we got pretty much the floors cleaned uh we didn't quite get around to cleaning the Windows like we were hoping to today uh so I don't know if they'll have them taped off tomorrow or not but we'll just pick it up so after Friday after uh sat they should finish painting Saturday and then starting Monday uh we can start installing all the receptacles light switches all the lighting and uh get that done uh all the speakers all the security cameras um you know all kinds of stuff so it's just going to be a uh to try to trim out as quick as we can put all the doors in all the flooring all the bathroom petitions and and so we hope that maybe we can be done in about 6 weeks if we get some help um and then of course the Landscaping will be coming along so that's where we're at we're we're kind of uh as we would say we're on the downhill side of things so this is the time that we need a lot of help so uh if you can uh give some time there's going to be cleaning sweeping um window cleaning uh all those kind of things that uh that's nobody likes to do but we got to do it anyway so if you can if you can pitch in on any of those items we would certainly uh be happy so we're looking forward to a great uh next couple weeks uh in progress tonight um we I want to listen to and I feel that kind of pressed on my heart especially in light of the place that we are uh in the direction that we're moving getting a new Sanctuary I wanted to listen to the little message that brother Brandon preached called what house will you build me and um when you listen to this I want you in your heart uh every time that brother brandham mentions brother Prairie green you put yourself in that spot uh brother Green's not with us any longer but what brother bram's talking about is he's talking about a church that's not a building but it's a it's a church and that church is made up of uh of of spirit Le people that the church it's not members but it's people that are led by the unction of the holy spirit so I I feel as brother Brandon preaches as he's emphasizing that individual individual leadership of people staying true to what God tells them to stay true to right and then God takes all the people that he's leading into individually and then he places that together and accomplishes his will for the church the leadership of the holy spirit is always according to the word of God but so we're we're listening to this to catch the attitude of what the prophet of God's talking about going forward and I also hope that uh somehow that we can catch uh another very tremendous point that our messenger is bringing to us is that people that are led by the spirit often times have great sacrifice along with that leadership it it's not a bed of ease it's it's the sacrifice we just listened here not long ago to the message leadership and the Rich Young Ruler rer was led by the spirit but he wasn't willing to pay the price the cost so we have to know in our lives that when we're LED of the spirit the spirit doesn't always lead us down a Rosy path and the easy way it's even when the prophecy came to brother Brenham he said because thou H has chosen the narrow way the harder way a great portion of Heaven awaits you and so as we listen to this we hope that it sinks in our heart that what what are we building well we're not trying to build this a building this building doesn't represent anything but clay and mortar and God doesn't dwell in buildings that are made by hands that's right he dwells in the hearts of the people people and and it's the atmosphere and the leadership that we're all trying to individually come under so I I hope it's it's like 22 minutes long uh it it's uh it's really got some real nuggets in it so this evening if let us stand and they'll start playing uh I think it's in the uh uh out of the seventh chapter of the book of Acts beginning with the 44th verse and we'll take our seats right after the uh after the end of the sermon so we don't want to listen to it like brother bram's talking about Perry green we want to listen to it like brother brandom's talking to us and I hope you can do it take it to heart I believe it'll be a blessing to you and and the the smallest sacrifice for the Lord he'll reward in this life and the life to come hund fold God bless you father bless your word to us in jesus' name we pray God bless you now let us read just a a verse or two here out of the the seventh chapter of the book of Acts beginning with the 44th verse our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the the Wilderness as he has appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our father came after brought in with Jesus unto the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for are the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith a prophet Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest has not my hands made all these things upon this the reading of this scripture I want to say the few words that I want to say before brother Perry brings the morning message I find this one of the Great Moments of my visit to Tucson I come here because that I was led to come here I come here because that the Holy Spirit through a vision sent me here uh know that might seems strange maybe but he as far as I know anything that I know of God I was sent by Vision to tuon amen I wondered how I ever was sent to this desert place and then here where there is spiritually speaking uh over the city I don't know of any place that's any more spiritual dead in in the city of Kon there is war between the churches there is fusses between the congregation there's no unity in everyone grabbing and holding and squeezing and trying to get this one and proing it is a desert spiritually speaking also but then I read in the Bible that where God Called Moses away from his loved ones and all that was dear to him and sent him into the Wilderness to write the laws of the Bible that was the Old Testament the first four books Genesis Leviticus uom and exodus he um I never said them just in routine but that four books that really is the Old Testament because the rest of it was what the prophets said in the Psalms of David and so forth but the chronicles of the Kings but this was the fundamental of the Old Testament was Moses wrote them after he was called from his homeland where he had been born and brought up among his people and was sent into the desert to write this book of the Old Testament then I find that in the book of the New Testament where Paul which is the author or not the author but the writer of the New Testament he also was drove out from among his people and by the spirit into the Arabia where he was three and A2 years to uh find the inspiration and Paul is the chief writer of the New Testament amen now there is Matthew Mark Luke and John but they were scribes that just wrote what Jesus said as they followed him along and but you take uh the book to Timothy and to the Romans and to the Hebrews and so forth Paul received inspiration to write the New Testament taking all the Old Testament as a shadow and setting it in and God honored it and made it the New Testament now if the Old Testament had to be drove from the the rider had to be drove from his People Into the Wilderness to get inspiration to write the Old Testament and in the New Testament the writer was drove by the author into a desert place to get the inspiration to write the new Testament and the books are sealed with Seven Seals it would also require the same I believe in these days to open those seven SE to leave what you hold dear to watch you cherish a little home that was given me by the people and amongst all my people and friends and a church that was flourishing and had nothing lacking and to leave that pull right away from it and move away out into a desert where you knew no body and everything against you but there's something about God that he drives a man to do things that's beyond any thinking of his own so it can be to the glory and honor of God and I feel that not self honor but I I feel the privilege it it was to leave everything that was called dear to me Amen to get here into this Wilderness and suffer like I have never suffered in my life here in this Wilderness or this desert but I believe that in doing that and obeying what God commanded to be done God has opened to us the mysteries of this last days amen and we are here uh with this message now there was many people who followed me and that's not unusual usually a person we people love one another and love will drive you to do things you don't think you would do that's right and many of you let your homes you left all just to go come out here in the desert many has called me many has asked me shall we come to Arizona would it be a good place for us well as it was said about Moses and then it was no place of fruit no place of pomeg Grant here there's not much work to do and living is high the cost of living is high it's a really a rough place to live as Tucson Arizona wages are poor and and food is high and rent it's it's a horrible place to live in that manner but it's healthy it's dry and we sometimes we mustn't get our minds fashioned on things of this Earth we must look to the leading of the Holy Spirit but one thing that troubled me in coming here and telling people well you should not come or you should come that I leave up to each individual the way God leads that individual to do I think every one of us should do that be led by the spirit on what to do and many of you here from around Jeffersonville and other congregation there and you have uh come out here now the thing that bothered me was a place of worship and I realize as I read in the scripture here of Stevens and is addressed just before his death or they stoned him immediately afterwards for his message as he was speaking he said our fathers talking of the Hebrews in the early days how that they tried to find favor before God to build a place for worship he said that Solomon build him a house or a building we're acquainted with the story but I like his next words how be it the most high dwelleth not in houses that's made with hands and another place over in Isaiah he said a body has thou prepared me sacrifice and offerings and buildings and so forth but a body H has thou prepared me well we realize that he was speaking then of the body where God tabernacled in Christ but I believe today that the inspiration that's come to to brother green to move here him and Sister Green Giving up their place back in the East also to back in Texas to come here with the start with nothing just simply by an inspiration feeling that they should do it I appreciate man that will follow the leading of Christ regardless of the cost they cost them though the whole world maybe your very best friends think that you're wrong but it isn't wrong to you as long as you feel there's something behind it that's God moving you it's never wrong and it'll always pan out right see this young couple a talented young man and S this because he's sitting here this young lady with her babies his family to raise good his job and everything to move here I realized that years ago I was called the ministry I've never made a successful Pastor because I got a Roman rambling spirit I can't be satisfied anywhere just wherever the spirit moves I just got to move with it because I have a message Jesus said I must preach in this other Town also but there are those who are Shepherds that watch The Flock I'm so grateful that brother Perry followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and today we have a tabernacle it's a small one that's just good enough to start with let's see what the Holy Spirit not knowing let's just move step by step now I believe if God has spoke to brother and sister green to come here and it's opened up a place where our children instead of on Sunday morning ride their bicycles and own the streets and run around they have a place to come to worship instead of us sitting around listening to something think that we've heard on radio which is all right but we as this group of people we have a message for this day we we believe that God has given us a message and brother green is I don't want to call you my associate because we are well it is also my associate we are together in this message brother green preaches the same thing the message that I believe in amen he's left his home he's left his people he's left his church he was a uh believe he's a district superintendent or something of one of the organizations and give a whole thing up when he heard this he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God is giving to us now I say I believe it's a not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up everything that we can attend the services to come here to worship and to make this a place uh where God can reveal to us the things that he has for us to reveal and as his word said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of the inspiration as it does to maybe to some of us but he said I'm here to back up what God has given what a statement and I I believe if we will all cooperate together we'll put our hearts to it I'm old at each one of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it some experiences I've just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I was first saved that was so glorious to my heart and we can come into a place we can set and we see it among us that we're drying as we said you're in the desert I get among my brother they talk with me and I talk with them always in a little way of watching dealing out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong I I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit amen for the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts amen see it's got to be in our hearts or we can't we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself and I'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real Christian now there they need Sunday school teachers they're going to need a STA and I want to say this so that you'll thoroughly understand this is my church I've been here three years and I've had one door open to me that was brother Mackie asked me to come preach God bless him I haven't been invited by any other people not nothing against them they're all right brother Brock a good friend of mine brother Gilmore many of these Pentecostal Brethren here are very very deep good friends of mine I love them nothing against them I understand their position they can't invite me in there and then remain in their organization see they can't do it because if they do they're kicked out so you see their position huh had the same thing to face but mine may it always be seek ye first the kingdom of God the will of God and now that brother green God has sent him in here and open us up a church of like Precious faith that we believe him we are to be very grateful to God attend every service take every place that we can and if we're asked to call on to pray to seek to do let's be so not at the just anxious to do it keep the message honorable live the right kind of life don't let no smut come up on it we're living too late now amen we're too late in the hour let's live it clean on my life your life all of our Lives needs to be picked up before God our young people just ride around from place to place and show to show and drifting further and further away from God like now that's the truth I see my children there and I see myself getting to a place where not you you got to assemble ourselves together to worship God the Bible said so when we see this day approaching that much more come together if there's only two people here you be one of them now that's and if we come together and worship together then we just something other about it Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in they me now as I've said before brother green told me and he said it my wife come told me what he said when I was away that uh he said this morning the pit was open at any time now usually that's open for me to speak I usually I had to drive all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana to give a message that God gave me Amen to bring it to the God gives me a message I can walk right here to pit and preach and feel free today and I believe by that that God Almighty will bless you if you will just stand by this church now this group of people not only that but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in see let's speak to others everywhere speak to them about our church what it means what our church we're here we want you to come bring in strangers and I'm sure it'll be good for all of us see we have a building which we're thankful for we're thankful for this place together together but how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hand see for Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stool and where is the place of my rest but a body has thou prepared me for and we are a body of Christ so as we move from one building to another building I believe and hanging our messages and we'll come down and have healing services and anything the Lord reveals to us to do we have it right here in the church until it swells out to the big we have to take it somewhere else and somewhere else until Jesus comes amen God bless Youk how many feel that was timely I mean that just I'll tell you there's just nothing like the voice did you hear it he said we're here to follow the message that's what we feed on we're not here to try to create a new atmosphere a new move of the Spirit uh some sort of sensation or uh come up with a interpretation we're here to feed on the message and it just takes all of us together so I hope you understood what I said as he talked about the people that sacrifice what it cost to sacrifice what it cost to be dedicated and what it cost to make yourself a part of something and that's kind of the spirit today everybody wants to be not tied down not dedicated they just want to uh be uh free they they don't want to they don't want to serve a master choose whom they're going to serve it's just the age of lukewarm and we've got to understand that that that's the spirit of uninvolvement and unattach and un uncommit make uh things for our young people and and and really to bring the spirit of the Lord that we can worship in the spirit and so when we come to Service uh you know our messenger taught us if we could get here a little early and sit down and read our Bible and pray and get in the spirit till you feel the anointing you feel the unction of the spirit you you can almost uh if you get in the spirit you could almost have the mind of Christ and and the minister will come up and you'll say oh that's just what I read I that's just what I was thinking the Lord spoke to my heart and you're one and I I just feel that that's a a really beautiful message it's something that you can certainly go back and listen to again at at and uh Listen to If I could say that the the the message uh between the lines of what it is he's saying and just think he said if I didn't come out here we wouldn't had those seals open you know and he said you know he just really he didn't say too many good things about TUC son you know but it's where God led him so he was willing to take everything that sacrifice he had to make in order to keep the will of the Lord so we just trust that it is God bless you tonight uh let's stand together and uh our next Sunday will I think is uh Christmas Eve and so we'll have one service at uh uh 10:00 we'll try not to keep it too long and and uh we won't uh have uh service that Wednesday before Christmas because you all have to go out and buy your pastor present so we want to leave that thing open for shopping no I don't need any stuff okay so uh you find somebody that doesn't have anybody or doesn't have a father or a a widow and you get them a present okay I know you love me and I love you so I don't need anything so um uh so don't uh don't get me anything I'll be real honest I don't need any plaques I don't need any statues I don't need any pictures I don't need any socks I I don't need anything so find somebody that that you can give something and you give it to them and uh just in honor of of of feeding the poor and and going out the needy the fatherless the Widow let's take care of them okay so uh Lord bless you let's just have a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord I Marvel that in 20 minutes how much your Prophet can say Lord how we can just create the presence in the midst of the People by your word and that you can speak to our hearts and speak to our attitudes and speak to the way that we think and father I pray that the scripture says that we could have eyes have that we might see father that we can hear that we can have ears to hear what the spirit saith to the church father father don't let us become cold and formal and and think that it's just going to church and and that the services don't have any meaning and we're just going to hear old Brother David or brother Billy or brother Matt or Andrew or Ben wall or brother Paul any of the brethren we have here ministering Lord but we come to hear from you some nugget out of the message message of the hour that you placed on our heart so father I hope that we can grow into what our messenger spoke of tonight father May the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit we ask for your blessings in jesus' name we pray amen bless [Music] you let the weak say I am strong oh let the PO say I am fre oh let the blind say I can see oh
