[10:02] your people Lord
[10:03] Jesus in this house Lord that you've
[10:06] allowed for us to come together with one
[10:08] purpose and one Accord father and that's
[10:10] that your name might be lifted up Lord
[10:13] and that Hearts may be spoken to Lord
[10:16] Jesus this is your house of correction
[10:19] Lord Jesus this is also the house of
[10:22] healing Lord Jesus the house of saving
[10:25] father this is the only place that a
[10:27] Believer has to come to Lord not the
[10:30] building father but Gathering under your
[10:32] word Lord Jesus that they can have
[10:35] access to All Things Lord Jesus
[10:37] regardless the request this is the very
[10:40] Place Lord you can make anything known
[10:42] and the answer is found in it Lord Jesus
[10:45] we're thankful father we pray Lord that
[10:47] you have prepared something for the
[10:49] people Lord father set me aside Lord
[10:53] Jesus use this vessel Lord in its
[10:55] weakness Lord Jesus to say something to
[10:58] the people father father I don't want it
[11:00] to be my thoughts Lord Jesus but I want
[11:03] it to be something for them Lord Jesus
[11:05] that you've ordained they didn't come
[11:07] here to hear from me Lord but they've
[11:09] got something on their hearts Lord Jesus
[11:11] Desiring for you to speak to them about
[11:14] Lord Jesus and after a sermon as such
[11:16] that we heard this morning of a power of
[11:18] transformation Lord Jesus I believe the
[11:21] people have returned in your house
[11:22] father to hear more word father that
[11:25] they can go back and apply and it'll
[11:27] cause a transformation in their life
[11:29] Lord Jesus we just ask Lord that you be
[11:31] with us in this short time that we'll
[11:33] spend in your word
[11:35] father bless Lord Jesus the people that
[11:38] have made the sacrifice to come into
[11:39] your house Lord and for those that had a
[11:41] desire to but Wen able to do so father I
[11:44] pray where they're at that they may
[11:45] receive a blessing as well Lord Jesus we
[11:48] leave all other things into your Mighty
[11:49] hands Lord asking all these things in
[11:51] the precious and wonderful name of the
[11:53] Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[11:56] amen hallelujah while you're standing
[11:59] ing let's turn into the Book of
[12:06] Revelation I've purposed in my heart to
[12:08] not be
[12:10] long I have a timer
[12:14] here so when that timer
[12:16] expires I've
[12:21] expired we'll read uh from Verse 17- 18
[12:26] and then we'll turn again to Romans 8:11
[12:30] the scripture reads and when I saw him I
[12:33] fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
[12:36] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[12:39] not I am the first and the last I am he
[12:43] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[12:46] alive forever more amen and have the
[12:49] keys of hell and of death I want us to
[12:53] keep this in our minds that this very
[12:55] person that says I am the first and the
[12:57] last he that liveth
[12:59] and was dead and behold I am alive
[13:02] forever more the same person lives in
[13:05] you that's right right so if he's
[13:07] dwelling in you and these are his
[13:08] capabilities the prophet would tell us
[13:10] that we are him she is him so if he's
[13:14] alive forever more what about
[13:18] you let's turn to
[13:27] Romans chapter 8 we just read the 11th
[13:30] word the 11th verse it says but if the
[13:33] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[13:35] the dead dwell in you he that raiseth
[13:38] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[13:41] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[13:43] dwelleth in you Lord we want to ask a
[13:46] blessing over the reading of your word
[13:48] father we ask this in Jesus name amen
[13:50] you may be
[13:53] seated as I was chewing on what brother
[13:57] our pastor was preaching on this this
[13:59] morning and it really stood out to me
[14:01] when he was speaking about how we've
[14:04] lost our way we've
[14:06] lost the the the meaning for this life
[14:09] the meaning for this walk and it it got
[14:12] it got me
[14:15] thinking the message the bible church
[14:20] Wednesday Sunday two Services all these
[14:23] different things camp meetings and all
[14:25] these different things that we do and we
[14:27] try to do to help the people
[14:30] what good does it do to have all these
[14:33] camps all these meetings and all these
[14:35] things if our lives remain the
[14:38] same we've received the word that's
[14:41] supposed to cause a transformation in us
[14:44] but instead what it's happened is like
[14:46] our Pastor said this morning it's become
[14:48] now a thing of Association we pick and
[14:50] choose which parts of it that we want to
[14:53] identify with not that we live by but we
[14:56] identify with right I can chew on this
[14:58] side on emotions cuz I'm just you know I
[15:00] feel everything and I can chew on that
[15:03] or you come to the other side and say
[15:04] well I don't like to raise my hand I
[15:06] don't like to do nothing I just want to
[15:07] be a log on the bench well there there's
[15:10] that side as well right but what good
[15:12] does it do to pick a side if you don't
[15:14] live
[15:16] either we we want to be found changed we
[15:19] want to be found transformed and it
[15:21] moved just looking within my own life
[15:24] it's man I I don't I don't have the
[15:27] understanding I don't have the
[15:28] recognition
[15:29] I I don't I don't have what most of the
[15:32] people that have been in this message a
[15:33] long time have had through studying the
[15:35] scriptures through studying the word
[15:37] through studying all these different
[15:38] things I want to make this clear it's
[15:40] not important whether you understand the
[15:42] entirety of it our Prophet would say
[15:45] when when he was tall they said man I
[15:47] some people know the Bible better than
[15:49] me some people have a better
[15:50] understanding of the Bible but they
[15:53] don't know it from an intellectual
[15:55] standpoint I know the author right and
[15:58] it's important for us to get past just
[16:00] letters get past just tapes get past
[16:03] just coming to church into a building
[16:05] but get into the relationship with the
[16:07] author for he he's Desiring to do
[16:10] something in your life he's Desiring to
[16:12] do something in my life he wants to see
[16:14] us changed there's no reason the same
[16:16] person we are today we are again the
[16:18] next year right we want to be
[16:20] progressing and changing getting closer
[16:23] and closer to that which he has planned
[16:25] for us we understand like we heard this
[16:27] morning that God had a purpose in the
[16:29] seed in the beginning he placed the
[16:31] specific attribute that he wanted to see
[16:34] expressed and manifested within that
[16:36] seed right I you can't spend your entire
[16:39] life trying to manifest what this seed
[16:41] of God is manifesting or what that seed
[16:44] or watching holding a stick of
[16:46] manifestation well you're not
[16:48] manifesting what I think you're supposed
[16:49] to be manifesting so you've got the
[16:51] wrong thing you're not manifesting what
[16:53] I think you should be manifesting so you
[16:55] have the wrong thing but my Bible tells
[16:57] me he's a god of variety amen amen
[17:00] that's right some big some small some
[17:02] funny some
[17:05] not there's a difference in us all we
[17:08] are not all the same but the one thing
[17:10] that should be constant in US regardless
[17:13] of how we look or feel is that we can
[17:17] pinpoint the progression in our lives we
[17:20] can see the change it was interesting
[17:23] that he pointed out this this morning
[17:25] man that that portion of tape that we
[17:27] listened to was so beautiful
[17:29] because here brother Bram says since
[17:32] beginning of
[17:33] time God has been trying to transform
[17:37] but in the same time there was another
[17:40] trying to deform he couldn't create
[17:43] nothing all he could do was deform right
[17:46] well deform under what we know that the
[17:48] Bible tells us that God said let us make
[17:50] man in our image well what was that
[17:54] first image that he made man he made man
[17:56] into the spirit man and then from that
[17:59] point he then he made the scripture says
[18:03] there was no one to till the ground yet
[18:06] he made Man In His Image so then brother
[18:09] would specify and say well these are two
[18:10] different
[18:11] Creations this was the spirit man now he
[18:14] worked them towards the flesh Men by the
[18:16] Earth to till the ground and when the
[18:18] doubt was the only state in which the
[18:20] deformer could come
[18:22] in and do what he does best
[18:26] pervert change the meaning change the
[18:30] purpose and what happens is now we get
[18:33] into a state where we've allowed the
[18:35] spirit of the deformer to come into our
[18:37] minds and we're focused on the flesh man
[18:41] ra but that's not what God intended for
[18:43] us to do he wanted us to focus on the
[18:45] spirit
[18:47] man and thinking on this Within Me is
[18:50] the power to
[18:52] transform it it's not something that I'm
[18:54] getting from somewhere else all that's
[18:57] in you now are the potentials everything
[19:00] you'll ever be is already in you so who
[19:04] was the liar that told you that you had
[19:08] to get it from an outside Source trying
[19:11] to give you an
[19:12] alternative God didn't work in happen
[19:15] chance and luck no when he does
[19:17] something he thinks of every single
[19:20] possible method and he plans for it and
[19:23] he acts when he said let there be there
[19:25] was no other thought in his mind he knew
[19:28] what he said was perfect so when a
[19:30] prophet would come on the scene and say
[19:32] in the sermon it is the rising of the
[19:33] sun he says the Lord knew that there
[19:35] would be Sons and Daughters of God in
[19:37] the end well how could he know this
[19:39] because if you Rose if you were in him
[19:42] when he died and he rose that means you
[19:46] Rose with him you are I love the way the
[19:50] prophet says it a
[19:52] benefactor oh my man that that makes me
[19:54] feel good I I can partake of those
[19:56] blessings of what that Resurrection
[19:58] meant
[19:59] there was it was multiple meanings I
[20:00] just want to focus on this one meaning
[20:02] for a moment benefactor of that
[20:05] Resurrection what was he showing me when
[20:08] I see that it tells me that regardless
[20:10] of the condition that I find myself in
[20:13] the condition I find my brother my
[20:15] sister
[20:16] in sometimes the devil really beats up
[20:18] on our loved ones he really comes down
[20:21] on them and they start to question
[20:23] themselves question man do I really have
[20:25] this transforming power it seems as if I
[20:27] take two steps in the right Direction
[20:29] then one step back is this transforming
[20:31] power is it really real do I really have
[20:34] that thing on the inside that's going to
[20:35] take me all the way to the end well the
[20:37] one that put it there made sure when he
[20:40] put it there it would reach its goal it
[20:43] it it wasn't a chance thing he couldn't
[20:45] leave it the chance he's an all knowing
[20:49] god he's an all powerful
[20:54] God we get into a a place where we just
[20:59] we start to try to muster up a
[21:02] transformation we see what it looks like
[21:05] oh this person used to do this now they
[21:09] do this o let me copy what they
[21:12] do let me this is the funny part in in
[21:17] in the Sports World they say I forgot to
[21:20] start my
[21:23] timer in the sports well we're good now
[21:26] I'll just I'll deduct 15 minutes in the
[21:29] Sports World they
[21:30] say you can't look at where somebody is
[21:34] at and try to be where they're at and be
[21:37] jealous of where it is that they're at
[21:39] well this person he just has a way with
[21:41] the ball he's got control man how does
[21:44] he play like that you can watch it and
[21:46] you can learn about it but you'll never
[21:49] be able to do it because he spent
[21:51] thousands of hours mastering that one
[21:54] thing where we have problems is we see
[21:58] some somebody whose life has changed and
[22:01] we said man I want to copy what they're
[22:03] doing now but did you see what it took
[22:05] to get
[22:07] there you've got to go through your
[22:09] process right we we heard what our
[22:11] Pastor said this morning he learned
[22:14] obedience by the things he suffered in
[22:16] the church age book brother brandham
[22:18] says don't think you'll learn it any
[22:19] other way you'll have to suffer that's
[22:22] you'll have to go through things but we
[22:25] want to compare somebody's chapter 50 to
[22:27] our chapter one you got to get through
[22:29] the first 49 that's right transformation
[22:32] is not oh I'm perfect now no it's a step
[22:36] it's a process it's just like patience
[22:39] don't ask for things you don't know what
[22:41] you're asking for Lord give me patience
[22:44] it's not a drink of patience he gives
[22:46] you it's an opportunity to show patience
[22:49] you may not like that
[22:51] opportunity but it's presented to you
[22:54] all we're doing in this time is
[22:57] perfecting that which he already placed
[22:59] in
[23:01] you there it's it's
[23:04] not you're not coming up with anything
[23:06] on your
[23:07] own this this really struck me this
[23:10] morning as our pastor was preaching the
[23:12] power the law of the seed he placed it
[23:16] in me yes sir I'm not in charge of
[23:21] anything you get in the right atmosphere
[23:24] you feed on the right things you start
[23:27] becoming those things
[23:29] that's the law that he placed the more I
[23:31] eat the more I become if you eat bad
[23:34] things well you're going to
[23:36] look if you eat good things you're going
[23:38] to look the way you want to look you
[23:41] can't say man how did I get this
[23:43] way and you just had a Big Mac and 20
[23:47] count nuggets and three fries and and
[23:49] all this different stuff and say man I'm
[23:51] I'm trying to be healthy man I'm I'm
[23:53] trying to live right well where's the
[23:54] evidence of it where's the proof of it
[23:57] what have you been feeding on that tells
[23:59] me that that's what you're going
[24:01] towards and we just get to a place where
[24:03] you you hear a good sermon man I want to
[24:05] be changed I want to be transformed I
[24:07] want to see that life within me and then
[24:10] you you walk out right back in the same
[24:12] place you were doing the very same
[24:14] things he just took you out of and
[24:17] you're expecting to change this is us
[24:21] I'm not preaching to you this is myself
[24:23] we desire these big things but these big
[24:26] things require a big sacrifice it
[24:28] requires a big work you must give of
[24:31] yourself to receive of him did not our
[24:34] Prophet say the more you surrender the
[24:36] more he
[24:38] feels and we think we'll transform any
[24:41] other way we oh you know what Lord I'll
[24:43] just give you this small portion you
[24:45] just give me that and I'll take care of
[24:47] the rest you in what
[24:49] army the devil did not lose his power
[24:53] when he fell from heaven the power he
[24:56] had up there he had that exact same
[24:58] power
[24:59] now if you think you and yourself and
[25:02] your own self-will and restraint as a
[25:05] man can
[25:08] withstand you're fooling yourself that's
[25:11] right you need something greater than
[25:13] you I need something greater than me Ben
[25:18] can't do it Ben was never made to do it
[25:21] I can't transform myself I can't make
[25:24] myself become something that I'm not
[25:26] feeding on then it got me thinking I
[25:30] won't be long it got me thinking of a
[25:34] butterfly have you ever noticed a
[25:37] caterpillar all it does is just
[25:40] eat I can attest to that all it does is
[25:44] just eat but there's an importance in
[25:45] its eating it's not just eating just
[25:49] because which we do but it's eating
[25:52] because it knows at some point before it
[25:54] reaches its maturity it's going to go
[25:57] through a season where it cannot
[26:00] feed and it has to have something within
[26:03] it to feed
[26:04] on that's you and I when a butterfly is
[26:08] in that cocoon State science says it
[26:12] digests
[26:15] itself man what that what that'll do
[26:17] when you look at nature just a little
[26:18] bit like man science knows how to preach
[26:20] better than we can it'll testify to the
[26:23] god they don't like and and you wonder
[26:26] why he would tell John take the book
[26:28] book eat the book what's the purpose of
[26:31] eating
[26:33] it son of man
[26:37] prophesy it's on your lips speak as you
[26:41] eat the word you become that word you're
[26:46] feeding on the god that is within you
[26:49] it's not an outside Source it's when you
[26:52] hear that word spoken when you
[26:54] hear the mother Eagle crying out
[26:57] speaking to you what is it something
[26:59] identifies on the inside and says I just
[27:02] that's me I believe that I want that
[27:07] that I I can attribute myself to
[27:10] that if that's not the CER on your heart
[27:13] What's blocking that
[27:15] way we must open up the paths to allow
[27:19] for the word to be spoken for the
[27:22] feeding to take place so that we can
[27:24] start becoming that which we're feeding
[27:26] on
[27:31] see the constant battle in the
[27:34] believer's mind is always looking to
[27:38] see am I transforming just as fast as
[27:41] this other
[27:42] person man we were both in sin just
[27:45] yesterday you have no idea ah man we
[27:48] were in sin but he looks more spiritual
[27:50] than me I don't like
[27:54] that comparison is the thief of Joy your
[27:58] transformation may be a longer process
[28:00] than somebody
[28:01] else's maybe it's because you're a
[28:03] little too
[28:05] stubborn you just like to have your
[28:08] way nobody knows better than
[28:11] you you got to be honest with
[28:14] yourself if you can't be honest with you
[28:17] the man up here will never tell you
[28:19] something you don't want to hear because
[28:21] you'll be too busy looking at the man
[28:22] and saying I know you what are you going
[28:25] to tell me get past the Veil when
[28:29] something hurts when it's spoken and you
[28:32] feel it hurt it's not a hurt that you're
[28:35] thinking of no one's attacking you no
[28:38] one comes we're not bringing hundreds of
[28:41] people in this building for one person
[28:42] to feel attacked we're trying to make it
[28:46] we don't want to leave not a one
[28:48] behind what good does it do me this this
[28:52] is this the mind that God wanted you to
[28:54] have if you have this great
[28:56] transformation this great thing take
[28:58] place in your life and you leave your
[29:00] brother sitting next to you knowing he's
[29:03] fighting and that does nothing to you
[29:05] that's
[29:07] right I want to be transformed and I
[29:10] want to go and be a testimony a living
[29:14] testimony of what that transforming
[29:17] power can
[29:18] do it's like when you plant a a a plant
[29:22] you put it in the ground you take the
[29:23] seed you throw it into the ground if you
[29:26] dig it up every two seconds to see if
[29:27] it's transforming you'll kill it it will
[29:30] never produce What It
[29:31] Wants What it's intended to produce
[29:34] it'll never produce but if you put the
[29:38] seed down you water it you give it
[29:42] sunlight you let nature take its
[29:46] course it will produce what it was
[29:49] supposed to produce it's the same thing
[29:52] with you and I we have to get out of the
[29:55] mindset of comparison trying to dress
[29:58] drag people through
[30:00] transformation brother bam says God
[30:02] can't do nothing for you till you're
[30:04] willing to let him do
[30:06] it and we just want to drag everybody
[30:09] along man you got to get through this
[30:10] didn't he say he's not going to pull you
[30:12] through a pipe and come out the other
[30:13] end amen it's a process Lord I want to
[30:18] be
[30:19] transformed Lord help me be transformed
[30:22] we get so one- minded thinking that I I
[30:25] just I have to be transformed
[30:26] instantaneously stop stop for a moment
[30:28] and look back at the footsteps look
[30:31] where you've been look at the things
[30:33] you've done I know what I'm talking
[30:35] about I know where I've been sir I know
[30:36] the things I've done in this world that
[30:38] I'm not proud of but you know I can look
[30:41] back and say Lord I'm seeing that
[30:44] transformation take place I may not
[30:46] happy with the current results but I
[30:48] know the same one that's been bringing
[30:50] me through this transformation will get
[30:53] me to that end
[30:55] point if God could do that for you yes
[30:59] sir how much
[31:01] more for those you
[31:07] love this is a group Affair or Pastor
[31:11] said it best we've dealt with the
[31:12] outside now it's fixing the
[31:15] inside Lord I just don't want to be good
[31:18] I want the body to be well Lord how can
[31:21] I be of help to this person how can I
[31:24] minister to this need this person has
[31:27] How can I
[31:28] visit the Widow visit the
[31:31] fatherless do those things which the
[31:33] word said you were called to do you
[31:36] start obeying the word the
[31:39] transformation follows suit Disobedience
[31:42] to the word just
[31:44] shows what's affecting you the deformer
[31:48] wants you to see you the deformer wants
[31:51] you to see your faults your mistakes
[31:53] your errors and he puts in your mind
[31:56] that if you've Fallen if you've made a
[31:58] mistake that transformation has
[32:01] stopped that that's a funny thought to
[32:03] think about hurricanes good or
[32:09] bad tornadoes good or
[32:11] bad tsunamis good or bad who made them
[32:15] all do they not serve their
[32:18] purpose so what's it to you if you're in
[32:21] a season of
[32:22] tornadoes a season of tsunamis it
[32:25] doesn't mean God's not with you that's
[32:27] right
[32:28] amen he's still with you there's a
[32:30] process he's trying to do something he
[32:33] will use whatever measure he needs to to
[32:36] get the attribute out of you he's
[32:39] Desiring we just have to be like a lamb
[32:42] sheer me Lord stand still just for a
[32:47] second I know that's interesting to say
[32:49] because I don't know how to stand
[32:50] still but Lord help me stand still when
[32:55] that word is going forth help me stand
[32:58] still take in what's being spoken so
[33:00] that I may go and live by
[33:06] it brother Brandon makes this comment is
[33:09] rising of the sun paragraph
[33:11] 109 but there has got to come one
[33:14] Hallelujah there has to come a real
[33:17] bride there must come one that's not
[33:20] only got the mechanics but the Dynamics
[33:23] of it makes that church live more in the
[33:27] power of his resurrection until we come
[33:30] to that place until we find that place
[33:34] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[33:37] what good does it do to give her a
[33:39] facelift or simonized job when there's
[33:42] no Dynamics in it no matter how much the
[33:45] mechanic proves to be right there has
[33:48] got to be a dynamic to make it work
[33:51] that's what he proved Hallelujah that's
[33:55] what Easter proved he wasn't only the
[33:57] word but he was God himself the Dynamics
[34:01] in the word that made the body of Jesus
[34:04] Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave
[34:07] Shake into life and rise again and roll
[34:10] away the stone I am he that was dead so
[34:14] dead till the son said he was dead
[34:17] notice the things that are testifying to
[34:19] the condition the son said he was dead
[34:22] the moon said he was dead the Stars said
[34:25] he was dead all nature said he was dead
[34:27] and now the whole world has to recognize
[34:31] that he's alive again he was not only
[34:34] the mechanics God's word he was the
[34:37] Dynamics to prove
[34:41] it I I hope I can deliver it the way the
[34:44] lord gave it to me this is not just
[34:46] speaking about Jesus Christ this is
[34:49] speaking about his
[34:50] bride everything testified look at the
[34:53] church age oh it's dark nobody's living
[34:56] the pure word look at what's going on
[34:59] people are compromising they're choosing
[35:01] church and this they're mixing
[35:02] everything all together but something at
[35:04] the end has to testify the scripture
[35:07] says nature is waiting to see the
[35:09] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[35:11] of God it will testify I want to be one
[35:14] of the ones that it says I see a son
[35:17] that's a son of
[35:19] Adam he's coming into that maturity he's
[35:22] growing he's transforming he's being
[35:25] molded learning to surrender learning to
[35:28] be meek lowly humble not see himself but
[35:33] Christ that's my heart's
[35:37] desire but says until the church becomes
[35:40] both Dynamics and mechanics and the
[35:43] spirit of God that moved him to do the
[35:46] things that he did if he hit on 16
[35:49] cylinders so will the bride amen for he
[35:52] said in John 14:12 he that believeth on
[35:55] me the works that I do shall he do also
[35:59] I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in
[36:03] his mechanics that the world will not be
[36:06] able to withstand it and I'll raise him
[36:08] up again in the last days this this got
[36:12] me feeling good you can scream and shout
[36:13] and jump up and down all you want and
[36:16] deny this word it won't do any good
[36:19] you're just cranking around the Pistons
[36:21] got the spark to fire but no gasoline to
[36:23] fire it oh man what that does
[36:28] we we we want to recognize everything
[36:30] that attributes to the flesh oh man I
[36:33] was in that service man I just felt like
[36:35] my the Skin's on my hair the hairs on my
[36:37] skin man they were just sticking up I
[36:39] felt all this stuff brother Ram says it
[36:42] in the sermon what good does it do to
[36:44] Quicken everything else if it doesn't
[36:46] Quicken the
[36:47] seed the seed has to be quickened that's
[36:50] what the sun came
[36:53] for it quickens the ground around it but
[36:56] the purpose was for that
[36:58] seed don't misrepresent when you're in
[37:02] experience when you're having a moment
[37:04] with God and leave it just to the flesh
[37:07] leave it to just a sensation something
[37:10] you felt that you can go back oh that
[37:11] atmosphere was just something else oh my
[37:14] goodness but the word that gives life
[37:18] did you miss it were you so fixated on
[37:22] how everybody else was acting when the
[37:25] anointing came down that you missed the
[37:27] word
[37:28] what transforms you is not an
[37:33] atmosphere a prophet would say it takes
[37:36] an
[37:37] atmosphere but that's not what
[37:39] transforms you the atmosphere is created
[37:44] where the seed can grow but if the word
[37:46] isn't there you're you're doing nothing
[37:49] but messing with the seed the seed needs
[37:53] word it needs life the life is found in
[37:57] the word what we need more of today is
[38:00] feeding on the word we want to know why
[38:04] we aren't transforming why we aren't
[38:05] changing why our lives are still the
[38:07] same why we feel like we're stagnant is
[38:09] because we're not feeding on the word
[38:11] enough we're not praying enough we're
[38:14] not listening to tapes long enough they
[38:16] said well that's every single sermon
[38:17] that's preached listen to the tapes read
[38:19] your Bible pray well start doing
[38:22] it we have to this isn't just we're not
[38:26] here to bore you with the same
[38:29] information over and over and over and
[38:32] over again I want to see a church filled
[38:35] with the Holy Ghost in so much the devil
[38:38] don't know what to do with you I don't
[38:40] like seeing my brothers and sisters
[38:42] struggling and fighting and down
[38:44] thinking like they can't overcome that
[38:46] they can't get nowhere I don't like
[38:47] seeing that because that's not what God
[38:49] promised me a son and daughter of God
[38:51] would look
[38:53] like we need to transform out of that
[38:55] condition into the condition that we
[38:57] know when we speak something there's an
[38:59] authority behind to bring that thing to
[39:03] pass Lord transform me not just the
[39:08] because it's it's the spirit man we
[39:10] don't walk by this flesh this we heard
[39:13] the scripture this morning renew my mind
[39:16] Lord I got to think different part of
[39:19] the reason I'm not transforming is
[39:20] because my mind is wrong I think the
[39:23] wrong things I keep a negative
[39:26] confession when my Prophet told me not
[39:28] to do so think positive never let a
[39:31] negative con confession come into your
[39:33] mind he gives us
[39:35] these advice I would say it's more than
[39:39] an
[39:40] advice try it just think positive for a
[39:44] moment in the midst of darkness in the
[39:47] midst of everything seeming like it's
[39:48] not going your way just think positive
[39:51] for a second and you see if God won't
[39:54] move it's he's the high priest of your
[39:57] confession am I sick yes am I this yes
[40:02] but Lord your word says by your stripes
[40:04] I am healed see change the testimony on
[40:07] your tongue it's a good practice to just
[40:10] say what he said it eliminates you
[40:13] despite how you feel just say what he
[40:15] said you want soulless you want rest you
[40:18] want peace you want change just keep his
[40:21] words on your tongue and you watch the
[40:23] change will be on
[40:27] the prophet of God makes this comment so
[40:30] the bride must be paragraph 123 flesh of
[40:33] his flesh bone of his bone then how is
[40:36] this mortal flesh going to become his
[40:38] flesh we'll get to it in a minute how is
[40:41] it done how is this great transformation
[40:44] notice if the spirit of him God it's
[40:48] very simple lesson if the spirit of God
[40:51] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[40:55] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[40:58] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[41:01] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[41:04] you what we need is not to look for a
[41:08] transformation but look for the spirit
[41:11] that brings the
[41:12] transformation get the quickening power
[41:15] get him on the inside he takes care of
[41:18] the
[41:19] rest what the devil wants you to think
[41:22] is that you've got something to do with
[41:25] it oh man I felt for times
[41:28] today I'm late to
[41:32] transformation I've been going through
[41:34] six months of darkness
[41:37] numbness I go to church I hear the word
[41:40] it's good word being
[41:42] preached I can amen it but I'm just not
[41:45] feeling
[41:47] it some people feel numb for
[41:50] years I I want to encourage you with
[41:53] something there was a season in my life
[41:54] that I felt numb for a pretty long time
[41:58] but then I found
[41:59] something God never told me he'd be
[42:02] there when I felt like
[42:03] it he never told me he cared about me
[42:06] when I felt like he cared about me he
[42:08] said he'd never leave me he'd be with me
[42:11] even in me till the end so when you
[42:15] feel numb like he's away from you you I
[42:19] just don't feel your presence that's a
[42:22] good time to say Lord you said you'd
[42:25] never leave me nor forsake me but you'd
[42:28] be in me he didn't make that promise to
[42:30] take it back he made that promise cuz he
[42:33] knew he could fulfill
[42:37] it if you've ever been in that
[42:40] condition I wouldn't wish it on my worst
[42:45] enemy the devil really gets in your mind
[42:49] turns things changes the picture all you
[42:52] see is your faults your mistakes your
[42:55] errors your lack of obedience
[42:59] and you have God waiting there
[43:01] patiently just come back just come back
[43:05] where you left me come back pick me
[43:07] right back up let's continue
[43:10] on that's the Christian walk it's Christ
[43:14] in you with you walking he's doing the
[43:18] transformation not you and
[43:21] I he says oh my the predestinated one of
[43:26] course like the seed laid upon the Earth
[43:28] the one that had life in them many of
[43:31] them were dead they were just rotten
[43:33] seed the waters and things burnt them
[43:35] out but you know there was a seed laying
[43:38] there ready for life God know it was
[43:42] laying there oh that's
[43:44] me go back in that time before you had
[43:46] that experience with God there was
[43:48] something crying out you knew you were
[43:50] dead and you needed
[43:52] something you didn't know what that
[43:54] thing was if you were born in this
[43:57] message you may have an you may have had
[43:59] an idea but you really didn't know what
[44:01] that thing was because it up to that
[44:03] point it was mommy and daddy's religion
[44:05] and if you were in the world you really
[44:07] had no idea what that thing was but when
[44:10] you finally got close to that thing and
[44:12] he drew Close to You CU it's two step
[44:15] it's a deep and a deep coming together
[44:18] brother says when two omnipotents
[44:20] meet you had a craving you had a desire
[44:23] for something and he came the one that
[44:26] can fulfill that desire desire he came
[44:29] into
[44:30] you that feeling there was a
[44:34] supercharge it changed your com the way
[44:37] you thought it changed everything you
[44:40] wanted to do everything for God lord
[44:42] I'll pray every single night I'll fast
[44:45] I'll do all these different things in
[44:46] the marriage of land brother bam says
[44:48] that between the the the Earthly bride
[44:50] and the Heavenly bridegroom he says you
[44:51] made a vow to God you said you'd read
[44:53] your Bible you said you'd pray you said
[44:55] you would fast you said you would do all
[44:56] these these things do we uphold those
[44:59] things we promised him we would do we
[45:00] said Lord if you give me your
[45:03] spirit I'll never gossip
[45:07] again I'll never lie
[45:10] again we made all these promises to God
[45:13] knowing the scripture says it's better
[45:15] to not make a promise than to have made
[45:17] one and not keep
[45:19] it but you know thanks be to God he's
[45:22] the one that keeps his promises because
[45:25] he said he would not lose a one he said
[45:27] of all that you have given me I will not
[45:30] lose one if you believe you are one of
[45:32] those ones lift your hands that's a
[45:35] testimony that you're showing because
[45:37] it's not just us
[45:40] here there's that deformer here as well
[45:44] he sits in church he sits right next to
[45:47] you and when something comes that hurts
[45:50] too much he
[45:51] says yeah I don't take
[45:54] that something comes a little bit closer
[45:56] to ooh wait wait hold on does he know
[45:58] what I'm doing does he know how I'm
[46:00] living does he know where I've been does
[46:02] he know what I said yesterday who I was
[46:04] talking about yesterday he's right there
[46:06] in your ear he will remind you
[46:10] constantly he doesn't make things
[46:14] up this this this is the funny thing he
[46:17] didn't make things up he goes to God and
[46:20] says I watched him sin yesterday God
[46:23] says what do you
[46:25] mean I I see blood I don't see what what
[46:29] do you something's wrong my record and
[46:33] yours don't make something's not
[46:35] aligning so we're looking from the wrong
[46:37] perspective of things we think our
[46:39] transformation is man-made no it's God
[46:41] he puts the blood before you he didn't
[46:44] see your faults he didn't see your
[46:46] mistakes you see
[46:48] them if it bothers you enough do
[46:51] something about it sir change what it is
[46:54] that you do you start to see oh one way
[46:57] I one day I used to do these things
[46:59] there was a point in my life I was doing
[47:00] these things and that and then it just
[47:02] ate at me and it killed me and all these
[47:04] different things then you start doing
[47:06] what he said apply the token go home
[47:11] take that thing out the house delete
[47:14] those apps don't go to that site oh
[47:16] don't oh I can manage that no don't go
[47:18] there delete this delete that if you
[47:21] really wanted to live a pure sincere
[47:23] life with God everything you could get
[47:26] rid of if you truly desired it you'd
[47:29] remove everything and it' just be you
[47:31] and him oh what change takes place then
[47:35] but so long as you think you can manage
[47:37] the serpent you can't he's slicker than
[47:41] you think there was a perfect Church in
[47:44] the beginning the Garden of Eden the
[47:46] serpent came in and beguiled Eve and in
[47:49] this day he's trying to do the very same
[47:51] thing and God this is now God taking his
[47:55] bride out of Satan's Eden but we're not
[47:59] careful we start messing with that
[48:00] serpent again did we not learn our
[48:03] lesson it's not the big sin it's not the
[48:07] big flashing red light that you run away
[48:10] from no it's the thing you think you can
[48:12] control that you ought to get away from
[48:14] because so long as you think you're
[48:16] controlling it it ain't you
[48:18] thinking that's a good time to look at
[48:20] your yourself in a mirror and say depart
[48:22] from me Satan cuz you're not speaking
[48:24] about yourself but that thought process
[48:26] of I can manage this you'll never manage
[48:29] it you can't manage it he never left it
[48:33] for you to manage it I want that
[48:35] transforming power that completely
[48:38] changes my being my existence everything
[48:41] I think about my actions I don't want to
[48:44] see Ben I want to see him that all
[48:47] consuming fire come in and just take all
[48:50] the things that I don't Paul said it
[48:53] best that which I want to do I don't do
[48:58] but that which I don't want to do that I
[49:00] do there's a law in your
[49:03] members but if you take this word you
[49:06] feed on it every day when those thoughts
[49:09] come in that's a good time to just let
[49:10] me just sing a song Lord let me just get
[49:12] into your word let me just do this you
[49:15] start reaching for the right thing our
[49:17] problem is we reach for the wrong thing
[49:20] sometimes those thoughts come in that
[49:22] pressure he feels like he's pressing up
[49:23] on you have you ever felt it it's it's
[49:26] it's it's it feels so real like a hand
[49:30] pressing on you trying to push you to do
[49:33] something you know you ought not to be
[49:35] doing that's a good time to change the
[49:38] atmosphere speak the
[49:43] word he says now the predestinated ones
[49:45] are the first to be quickened by the
[49:46] holy spirit for the Holy Spirit comes to
[49:49] claim its own now this is deep now be
[49:52] sure to catch this good now as the son
[49:56] was sent across the Earth not to bring
[49:58] rocks which was dirt also to life it was
[50:01] not to bring all the dirt to life but
[50:04] was to bring the part of the dirt which
[50:05] was enclosed around the life not all men
[50:09] will receive Christ oh no but those
[50:10] which God foreordained life is housed
[50:13] around some of the dirt of the earth
[50:16] that's the one he comes to Quicken
[50:18] they're the ones that now that dirt
[50:21] would lay there in the Sun and say oh
[50:23] this sun is this old sun is so hot that
[50:26] rock say this old son is so hot but that
[50:28] little seed said that's what I'm looking
[50:32] for oh and it begin to Spring forth to
[50:35] life it quickened that part of the dirt
[50:37] because the sun was not sent to Quicken
[50:39] The Rock not to Quicken the dirt but to
[50:42] Quicken the life of the seed oh that's
[50:45] us that's we're crying out oh I need
[50:49] that oh that word that hurts that stings
[50:51] that exposes the sin I need that I got
[50:54] to amen those things because that's what
[50:56] will cause the change but we get when
[50:59] something just gets too close to our
[51:00] life we don't want no ident we don't
[51:02] even want to lift a
[51:04] finger because we think everybody's
[51:06] going to notice what's going
[51:08] on the minister will get behind the
[51:11] pulpit and cast and preach on those
[51:12] things pornography lust and all these
[51:14] things and you know you're struggling
[51:16] you know you're fighting through those
[51:17] things but you don't want to amen the
[51:19] word you're not amening it for habitual
[51:21] sake you're not doing it to make the
[51:23] minister feel good you're doing it for
[51:25] yourself there's a power in an amen a
[51:28] sincere amen will cause the
[51:37] change oh
[51:40] my I got to find a place
[51:44] close these clocks
[51:46] don't wow Lord forgive
[51:50] me veram says paragraph
[51:55] 134 he's talking
[51:57] about the eagle here and I want to close
[51:59] with this
[52:01] statement he's talk he's talking about
[52:03] the eagle here in the hen Eagle growing
[52:05] up in the hen he makes a comment he says
[52:07] and he never tasted anything like that
[52:10] he just eat enough to keep him alive
[52:12] because he didn't like the taste of it
[52:14] see cuz he wasn't a chicken to begin
[52:16] with see we start feeding on things that
[52:20] we know we're not made to
[52:23] eat the physical food that we eat is not
[52:26] to to give us life it's to survive my
[52:29] scripture tells me man shall not live by
[52:31] bread alone but by every word that
[52:34] proceeded out of the mouth of God this
[52:36] is more food to you every day than the
[52:39] food you eat that you consume in your
[52:41] flesh we need this meal breakfast lunch
[52:45] and dinner in the natural they say this
[52:48] breakfast is the most important meal of
[52:50] the day I tell you by testimony singing
[52:52] in my own life breakfast is the most
[52:56] important meal of the day if you start
[52:59] your day wrong feeding on the wrong
[53:01] thing that's right watch the rest of
[53:03] that day and how it goes but when you
[53:05] start it right and you put him in the
[53:07] first place he takes care of everything
[53:09] else this eag was not satisfied eating
[53:13] what these chickens were eating he was
[53:15] lied to by the deformer that this is
[53:17] what he was but there was a
[53:19] predestinated seed in him that could not
[53:23] deny that he wasn't like them he didn't
[53:26] know just what he was but he knew he
[53:29] wasn't
[53:30] that he
[53:32] says by this time this is the mother
[53:34] Eagle by by this time he is time for him
[53:36] to be born is the time for him to be
[53:38] hatched out said maybe a crow some in
[53:41] come in picked up my egg maybe a vulture
[53:43] I don't know something picked up my egg
[53:45] but I know the egg is in my mind I got a
[53:47] son somewhere I got to hunt
[53:50] him so does God he is that great Eagle
[53:55] in his thoughts he knows know he'd have
[53:56] a church he know he'd have a people no
[53:59] matter what's cuddled them no matter
[54:02] what they was hatched out under he is
[54:05] hunting for his own don't let that devil
[54:09] lie to you for one second and say you're
[54:11] too far gone your loved ones too far
[54:13] gone if there a seed of God when God
[54:16] hunts he only shoots seeking missiles
[54:19] there's no luck he don't miss you can
[54:23] turn left right hide down jump up find
[54:26] whatever covering space you want but I I
[54:30] I'll give you an example of something
[54:31] that's dear to me to my heart that I've
[54:32] seen when a mother gets down to pray for
[54:35] her baby I don't care whether you're 20
[54:38] 30 however old you are you're still baby
[54:39] to mom when she gets down to pray for
[54:42] that one and if he's not living right it
[54:44] doesn't matter how far he goes the
[54:46] missile of her prayer will hit the
[54:48] target and when that thing
[54:52] strikes the story of Hatty Wright does
[54:54] something to me the Lord knew what she
[54:57] would ask for I've got loved ones I've
[55:00] got people that I need that seeking
[55:02] missile of God's word to go and find he
[55:05] said he will hunt
[55:08] you the devil has his trophy wall of
[55:12] people he's claimed and all this stuff I
[55:15] got this person I got this person you
[55:17] know the de the devil had a spot for
[55:19] your name in his
[55:21] wall he thought 2,000 years I've spent
[55:25] perfecting this
[55:27] I'm going to get him I'm going to get
[55:30] her oh that dress is just long enough
[55:35] it's tight enough oh no it's loose
[55:39] enough it's the perspective you look at
[55:42] it I just want to I just want her to be
[55:44] right by the line I don't want her to be
[55:47] all the way in the truth or all the way
[55:48] wrong if I can keep her right at the
[55:51] line that shirt's just low enough to
[55:54] where it's not scandalous it's just high
[55:57] enough to where it shows modest you're
[55:59] painting too close to the
[56:01] line do you know where people go to die
[56:03] in war in the front lines get out of the
[56:07] front lines and for the because I I I
[56:10] hear a prophet say this well in the
[56:12] questions and answers he was asked well
[56:13] brother brandom you always preach so
[56:15] much about the sisters the sisters the
[56:16] sisters well what about the brothers and
[56:19] he stated something he said
[56:21] well any husband that allows his wife to
[56:24] do that he's d to
[56:28] blame oh but you know I'm not a husband
[56:31] you know I'm single I don't I don't have
[56:32] a wife do you have
[56:37] sisters they don't have to be your blood
[56:39] sisters do you care about people do you
[56:41] want to see better for people would you
[56:43] like somebody to tell you when you're
[56:44] living wrong when you're too close to
[56:46] the edge that's the kind of love I need
[56:49] if you see me doing something wrong
[56:51] please come to me if you love me you'll
[56:53] tell me amen if you don't you'll let me
[56:56] go go
[56:57] on but we have to be mindful of each
[57:00] other get out of that front line well
[57:03] you know I'm not wearing makeup I just
[57:05] got this colored powder it's not
[57:10] makeup well I'm not doing this I'm not
[57:12] doing that we can justify
[57:15] anything and find an excuse for anything
[57:18] but if we want to
[57:20] transform and be
[57:24] different no excuses
[57:26] lay it all
[57:28] down says if there's a question about it
[57:31] don't do
[57:34] it why Lord I'm speaking to myself here
[57:38] I have so many things that I question
[57:40] yet I act
[57:42] on and then I wonder why the
[57:44] consequences present themselves I didn't
[57:47] heed the advice of a prophet he said if
[57:50] there was a question about it don't do
[57:54] it you want transformation in your life
[57:57] stop doing those things which rise
[57:59] questions in your mind leave them alone
[58:03] continue walking in what you know
[58:05] without a shadow of a doubt is the
[58:09] truth if the musicians would come he
[58:16] says one day The Story Goes this old
[58:18] eagle flew over the Barnyard she was
[58:20] looking everywhere and she found him oh
[58:22] for that Resurrection to recognize that
[58:24] he really wasn't a chicken after all he
[58:27] was an eagle and he was always taught to
[58:29] look down look for a bug or something in
[58:32] the barnyard I want us to pay attention
[58:34] to this who's teaching him this stuff
[58:37] but he heard a scream let's go back a
[58:39] bit he was always
[58:43] taught to look down look for a bug or
[58:48] something in the barnyard but he heard a
[58:51] scream that said look up this way and he
[58:55] looked looked above him and there was a
[58:57] creature with 14 feet Wings powerful
[59:01] than any than all the chickens there was
[59:03] in the barard barnyard and claimed him
[59:06] to be her son he said Mama how can I get
[59:10] to you said just jump start flopping
[59:13] your wings for you're an eagle see she
[59:16] knew she had a son somewhere no matter
[59:19] what he's been raised up in she's got a
[59:22] son somewhere if you're a daughter you
[59:24] place yourself there she got a daughter
[59:26] somewhere and God knows Hallelujah he's
[59:29] got a predestinated for ordained church
[59:32] he know he's got sons and daughters and
[59:34] a bride waiting somewhere when the Holy
[59:38] Spirit begins to fly over it that was
[59:41] Chief oh my he's the same yesterday
[59:44] today and forever not some mythical
[59:46] story but a reality no matter how many
[59:49] tried to tell him an eagle he didn't
[59:51] know what an eagle
[59:53] was yet he was an eagle
[59:56] he would not understand it until he seen
[59:59] something that reflected him that
[1:00:01] reflected rather and it jumped out of
[1:00:03] the page oh when you get a revelation
[1:00:06] where it just comes off the page and it
[1:00:08] hits you I didn't know what I was I had
[1:00:12] to see an example of what transformed
[1:00:14] looked
[1:00:16] like he had a reflection of his
[1:00:20] own we're looking not to him but we see
[1:00:24] Christ in him identifying in the Christ
[1:00:27] in him
[1:00:29] it's Lord help me
[1:00:34] Lord that I might really see my
[1:00:36] reflection in your word the deformer
[1:00:39] wants you to see your reflection in the
[1:00:41] mistakes and stuffs that you do but God
[1:00:44] wants you to see yourself in his
[1:00:46] word this is what the transformation
[1:00:48] looks like it's a Life by the word it's
[1:00:52] not a Life by your own abilities what
[1:00:55] you can must up what you can think of
[1:00:57] what you can do no it's being
[1:00:59] surrendered true transformation is
[1:01:02] complete surrender you're just learning
[1:01:05] how to give in you're learning how to
[1:01:07] give up it's not about me it's not about
[1:01:09] me nevertheless not my will but thine
[1:01:12] will be done Lord let this cup pass for
[1:01:14] me we saw an example of what it meant to
[1:01:17] be transformed and
[1:01:20] changed brother random says let's stand
[1:01:24] he says and when we see not a denom
[1:01:25] comination not a PhD not a lld not a
[1:01:29] good neighbor but a Son of God molded in
[1:01:31] the image of God with the dynamic power
[1:01:34] of God to answer the request of this day
[1:01:37] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:39] forever there ain't no hen going to hold
[1:01:42] you he hunts for his
[1:01:45] mama he's an eagle to begin with he
[1:01:48] recognizes this real Eagle recognizes
[1:01:52] the call of God's word why he's an eagle
[1:01:56] a eagle to an eagle the word before the
[1:01:59] foundation the word to the word oh the
[1:02:02] word predestinated to the word written
[1:02:06] for the hour you realize your position
[1:02:10] he hunts for
[1:02:12] it if you've realized your position in
[1:02:15] this hour and you've seen what it is
[1:02:18] that you want to come
[1:02:19] to what the the maturity of your
[1:02:22] transformation looks
[1:02:23] like some are called the one on office
[1:02:26] some are called to another but your
[1:02:28] desire within yourself should be Lord I
[1:02:30] want to be all that you planned for me
[1:02:32] to be I don't want to misfill anything I
[1:02:36] want to be right on the line with
[1:02:39] everything if that's your heart's desire
[1:02:42] there is a power greater than you and
[1:02:44] I that will bring you to
[1:02:48] that let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:02:51] gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:02:56] you gave me a simple thought Lord

[1:03:03] the burden you put all my heart

[1:03:10] transformation I thank you for
[1:03:12] quickening power

[1:03:18] what the prophet was trying to tell us
[1:03:20] Lord
[1:03:22] Jesus we didn't have to be this way
[1:03:25] he was showing us what we would come
[1:03:28] to if we would just continue walking and
[1:03:31] trusting in the path which was laid
[1:03:33] before us
[1:03:37] Lord father I I sincerely ask for
[1:03:39] forgiveness

[1:03:52] give it to you that I'm able to see any
[1:03:55] progress Lord

[1:04:00] father you see the people's hearts Lord
[1:04:04] Jesus you know the ones that have been
[1:04:06] looking for
[1:04:08] transformation that the devil points to
[1:04:10] faults and
[1:04:11] mistakes and says you're not headed
[1:04:15] anywhere it's just a lie Lord he's
[1:04:19] nothing but a bluff there's no truth

[1:04:56] seek after you Lord we didn't find
[1:04:59] churches to spend time with you Lord we
[1:05:02] didn't get down and pray Lord there was

[1:05:07] that we didn't put Lord Jesus if it was
[1:05:10] up to us we would be doing whatever it
[1:05:12] is that we wanted Lord but you put a law
[1:05:15] within us Lord we must produce that
[1:05:18] which you had in mind since the

[1:10:59] enjoy the word amen it's not looking to
[1:11:03] the left to the right God has a process
[1:11:06] that he would take you through you know
[1:11:09] sometimes we want somebody else's
[1:11:10] process no he has a process for you
[1:11:13] butam says God knows men men don't even
[1:11:18] know themselves God knows men better
[1:11:20] than they know themselves he knows
[1:11:22] exactly where to press he knows exactly
[1:11:25] when to bring the heat he knows what
[1:11:27] he's cooking you know we we just the
[1:11:30] recipe of whatever he wants to bring and
[1:11:32] said God is do when to co he knows when
[1:11:34] to raise the heat he knows when to cool
[1:11:36] it down you know the problem with us is
[1:11:39] we we have an idea we think we want what
[1:11:42] we know what he wants at the end no we
[1:11:44] don't he he he knows what he wants with
[1:11:47] us he knows where to place us he knows
[1:11:50] all we need to do is fell in love with
[1:11:52] him and I I love just what our brother
[1:11:54] brought you you know often time people
[1:11:56] compare one another and they compare
[1:11:58] this and if we can just be surrendered
[1:12:01] all to him you know uh I I don't
[1:12:04] remember who I was fellowshipping with
[1:12:07] and um he was talking about just the
[1:12:10] brothers here at church and they were
[1:12:12] talking about this plant that when it's
[1:12:15] planted how long it takes before it even
[1:12:18] brings everything out it would take a
[1:12:23] long time all of the all of this time
[1:12:26] it's just building the foundation the
[1:12:28] roots are going deeper and deeper and
[1:12:30] deeper it's all doing that in
[1:12:32] preparation before he shoots up you know
[1:12:35] often time we we you know we the the the
[1:12:38] prophet talk says the problem is we lack
[1:12:40] patience you know we we go to church and
[1:12:42] like oh I don't see the results we get
[1:12:44] frustrated with oursel the results
[1:12:47] you're not the one bringing the result
[1:12:49] he's going to bring the result our job
[1:12:52] is just to drink in like our brother
[1:12:54] said to eat the word to eat the word let
[1:12:57] me say this the same process that you
[1:12:59] see with the natural food is the same
[1:13:02] process this word will do it's not a
[1:13:04] different process you eat the food you
[1:13:07] see it come to pass you eat well you see
[1:13:09] it you eat the word sincerely not don't
[1:13:13] eat education eat the word eat the life
[1:13:16] pray and go on your knees and let it
[1:13:18] work on you even prayer itself the
[1:13:22] moment you stand up it gives you a sweet
[1:13:24] Spirit it gives you understanding you
[1:13:26] know how to deal with problems you know
[1:13:28] how to be patient but but if you don't
[1:13:30] do that then you're not going to get the
[1:13:32] result we want to be an overnight
[1:13:34] Christian you know we we've we we call
[1:13:37] ourselves the 11h hour worker that
[1:13:39] doesn't need to do anything no you still
[1:13:41] need to go through the process whatever
[1:13:44] that work is you still need to do it we
[1:13:47] we still need to be to let God work the
[1:13:49] patience work the fruits of the spirit
[1:13:52] we need to eat the word and let the word
[1:13:54] the bread of sincerity and Lord I'm
[1:13:57] eating the word I'm eating then he's
[1:13:59] there behind and just arranging
[1:14:01] everything for you and working out
[1:14:03] bringing out the power of transformation
[1:14:05] it's in the word when you eat your word
[1:14:09] the spirit of the word works on you our
[1:14:12] problem is we eat intellect so we can go
[1:14:15] tell people what we know oh I know this
[1:14:18] and this just like our Pastor said this
