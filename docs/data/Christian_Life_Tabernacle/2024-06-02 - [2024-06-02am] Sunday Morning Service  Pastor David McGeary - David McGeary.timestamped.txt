[47:26] thank you Lord Jesus father you're so
[47:28] wonderful Lord Jesus father when the

[48:03] asking for you to come down and speak to
[48:05] us Lord Jesus not to hear from a man
[48:07] father but to hear from you Lord Jesus
[48:09] words that would pierce the very life of
[48:11] each individual Lord Jesus go down to
[48:14] where each one is Living Lord and say
[48:15] something that might be able to bless
[48:17] the person Lord Jesus that not a single

[48:34] the challenge of the day Lord it doesn't
[48:36] matter how great the request it doesn't
[48:38] matter how small the request the answer
[48:40] stays the same Jesus Christ the same
[48:42] yesterday today and forever father if

[48:55] God that any time his name is asked Lord
[48:58] Jesus Oh father I thank you Lord this

[54:51] amen amen Lord bless you this morning I
[54:54] guess uh many have you have heard that
[54:59] uh the passing of uh brother barudi the
[55:03] Lord has chosen to take him home and uh
[55:08] you know through life people might have
[55:11] disagreements with one another but when
[55:14] somebody loses somebody in their family
[55:17] it's sorrowful you know and we pray for
[55:20] his family and he had many followers
[55:24] people that uh looked to him for their
[55:27] spiritual guidance and now there's a
[55:31] void in their lives so we just pray for
[55:34] all of them that the Lord might find a
[55:38] place that they can find peace and rest
[55:41] and and uh he identified with this me
[55:44] message and I consider that to be a
[55:47] brother when I went to Congo the very
[55:50] first time I had two
[55:52] interpreters one was brother dooka and
[55:55] one was brother barudi and so uh I go
[56:00] kind of far back with a lot of people so
[56:03] we just want to keep them in prayer
[56:05] today and at this time so let us bow our
[56:09] heads together this morning our gracious
[56:11] Heavenly
[56:14] Father Lord one of the great curses of
[56:17] sin was
[56:20] death that the day you eat thereof is
[56:23] the day you die and
[56:26] father all down Through the Ages no
[56:28] matter how great the ministry of men
[56:32] were one by one
[56:34] father the time that was allotted to
[56:38] them came to an end and they went
[56:41] home Paul Peter St
[56:45] Martin Wesley Luther the messenger of
[56:49] our
[56:50] age father they all played their part
[56:54] and father we know there's a Time time
[56:57] that there will be people here that will
[56:59] not taste of that death but will be
[57:02] translated and
[57:04] transformed father and caught up to meet
[57:07] you in the air that's the goal of each
[57:10] of Our Lives father if we are part of
[57:14] that we Rejoice but if we're not we're
[57:17] going to have a life worthy of the
[57:19] Gospel we ask you to bless us this
[57:22] morning as we Fellowship around your

[57:27] pray amen amen God bless you may be
[57:31] seated we have a baby dedication this
[57:34] morning and from uh what I understand
[57:39] it's going to be one of
[57:41] many I think we've had seven or eight uh
[57:46] babies born here in the last few months
[57:48] and and that's what we uh that's what we
[57:52] want we want to grow and and be blessed
[57:55] in the name of the Lord Lord want our
[57:57] Quivers filled and our tables full and
[58:00] the fellowship in so we ask
[58:04] uh uh brother Cosman and and uh sister
[58:10] Holly where are you and Grandpa if

[58:53] I look at Gideon and and you notice he's
[58:55] got like four sisters well he got the
[58:58] perfect
[58:59] name because Gideon means
[59:03] F or Rua which means Grappler or
[59:09] wrestler because uh he tore down the
[59:12] altars of
[59:14] baale and uh we know the great story of
[59:17] Faith how that he went in the battle
[59:20] outnumbered but by obeying the word of
[59:23] the Lord he won a great victory so he
[59:26] had to go Beyond Reason Gideon did it
[59:30] wasn't
[59:31] reasonable and it wasn't a a militarily
[59:35] sound but he had one thing he had the
[59:38] word of the Lord and so that's what
[59:41] we're going to pray is that that the
[59:44] word of the Lord is always gide and
[59:46] sword and his might amen so brother hman
[59:52] if you would come so Grandpa come over
[59:54] here too and and we got these three uh
[59:59] Generations here and I think that's
[1:00:02] wonderful don't you and if the Lord
[1:00:04] carries we hope it continues on so girls
[1:00:08] you take care of them because he'll
[1:00:12] remember you know what I mean and so you
[1:00:16] be sweet sister Holly congratulations
[1:00:18] you know what I mean it's wonderful so
[1:00:20] if you dedicate your son then we'll ask
[1:00:22] Grandpa to pray and then we'll all pray

[1:04:04] Lord bless you all thank you so much
[1:04:11] amen thank you musicians this
[1:04:14] morning you know I I meet the challenge
[1:04:18] uh almost every time that I come to the
[1:04:22] pulpit that I read something and and or
[1:04:26] I I listen to something that the prophet
[1:04:29] of God said and it inspires me and and
[1:04:34] and uh I want to share that with you and
[1:04:38] so then I I I I go through the Battle of
[1:04:43] uh well should I try to share it and go
[1:04:46] through it or should I play it and I
[1:04:50] just came to the point that I couldn't I
[1:04:54] just couldn't come come up with the
[1:04:57] ability to express it any uh better than
[1:05:02] the way he did it and so I I just felt
[1:05:06] in my heart it's 30 minutes but it's a
[1:05:10] tremendous 30 minutes that I would like
[1:05:13] to play for you and I know that we have
[1:05:17] several different languages and and uh
[1:05:21] some people can read English some can't
[1:05:25] um and we have interpreters and
[1:05:28] sometimes tapes are harder to interpret
[1:05:30] and others depending on how fast the
[1:05:33] prophet goes
[1:05:35] but this message was given to be our
[1:05:39] guide through this hour yes and and you
[1:05:44] we can't make it without this word of
[1:05:47] life and and I want you to hear it what
[1:05:52] he he was trying to tell us and then
[1:05:55] I'll go back and read a few statements
[1:05:58] and and share with you what's on my
[1:06:01] heart but I I want us to always know
[1:06:05] where the source is and someone said to
[1:06:08] me here a while back he said to me he
[1:06:09] says well you know if you preach he said
[1:06:11] aren't you afraid that the people are
[1:06:14] going to find out that you were just
[1:06:17] copying brother brandom I said that'd be
[1:06:20] a great
[1:06:22] honor that'd be the greatest compliment
[1:06:25] that they could give me is to say
[1:06:27] brother mcgui you said exactly what
[1:06:29] brother brandham said I I heard that on
[1:06:32] tape just the other day many times that
[1:06:36] I'll Minister something and the brothers
[1:06:38] will come back the next day with quotes
[1:06:41] after quote uh just backing up uh where
[1:06:45] brother brandham said the same thing and
[1:06:47] and and that's what I Rejoice cuz uh he
[1:06:52] was built to get us through he was built
[1:06:55] to meet the challenge of the hour and to
[1:06:59] give us the word that would meet that
[1:07:01] challenge we wouldn't be here this
[1:07:04] morning gathered together from so many
[1:07:07] different places so many different
[1:07:09] countries if all of us hadn't heard that
[1:07:12] eagle scream if we hadn't heard that
[1:07:15] voice and and I know sometimes as
[1:07:19] children or teenagers your parents make
[1:07:22] you go to church and and I made my kids
[1:07:25] go go to church and many times I saw
[1:07:28] him uh sitting on the back row you know
[1:07:33] uh sleeping and doing all those things
[1:07:36] but I had a promise that if you'd raise
[1:07:38] them up in the way that they should go
[1:07:41] that God would bring them back and they
[1:07:43] would return you know so now I'm I'm
[1:07:46] thankful um you know that all three of
[1:07:49] my sons preach the the gospel and they
[1:07:53] believe it for themselves and I believe
[1:07:56] if something would have happened to me
[1:07:58] that they would continue on and and
[1:08:01] that's that's a blessing in my heart so
[1:08:04] let us stand this morning and we're
[1:08:06] going to read a scripture and then we're
[1:08:09] going to uh turn to the message
[1:08:13] called uh identification and we're going
[1:08:16] to try to stay with uh some of the
[1:08:19] things that we've been talking about and
[1:08:24] uh so we're going to
[1:08:26] uh uh uh start on paragraph 24 I know
[1:08:32] some of you now can uh have your uh
[1:08:36] devices or phones or whatever and you
[1:08:39] can make sure your ringer turned off but
[1:08:42] maybe you could pull it up in Spanish or
[1:08:44] French kind of read along and follow
[1:08:48] with the paragraph numbers or however it
[1:08:50] is but to read our scripture this
[1:08:53] morning we want to turn to Philippians
[1:08:57] of the second
[1:08:59] chapter and we want to start with the
[1:09:02] fifth
[1:09:04] verse and uh this is a a
[1:09:10] greater a a greater scripture to me
[1:09:13] every day as I go along life's journey
[1:09:17] it
[1:09:23] says in the fourth verse says
[1:09:26] look not every man on his own things but
[1:09:30] every man also on the things of others
[1:09:34] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:09:39] in Christ Jesus Amen Let the mind that
[1:09:43] was in Christ Jesus be in you who being
[1:09:47] in the form of God thought it not
[1:09:50] robbery to be equal with God but made
[1:09:54] himself of no
[1:09:55] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:09:59] a servant and was made in the
[1:10:02] likeness of men and being found in
[1:10:07] the fashion of man he humbled himself
[1:10:11] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:10:15] death of the Cross wherefore God also
[1:10:19] have highly exalted him and given him a
[1:10:23] name which is above every name name that
[1:10:26] at the name of Jesus every knee should
[1:10:29] bow of things in heaven and things in
[1:10:33] Earth and things under the Earth and
[1:10:37] that every tongue should confess that
[1:10:40] Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God
[1:10:44] the Father wherefore my brethren as ye
[1:10:48] have also
[1:10:50] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[1:10:54] how would more in my absence work out
[1:10:58] your own salvation with fear and
[1:11:01] trembling for it is God which worketh in
[1:11:05] you both to Will and to do his good
[1:11:11] pleasure amen God bless you you may be
[1:11:20] seated I like the very first part of
[1:11:23] this message going to listen to and I
[1:11:27] I'd like to read it uh to you so when
[1:11:29] you hear it it sinks deep he's telling
[1:11:33] the story about the little boy that
[1:11:36] stood in front of the mirror and he said
[1:11:40] and he waved at him and he waved back at
[1:11:43] him and he kept getting closer and
[1:11:45] closer watching the little fella first
[1:11:49] thing he reached out his hand and looked
[1:11:53] around his parents was watching him cuz
[1:11:57] he had never seen a mirror before and he
[1:12:01] said well that's
[1:12:05] me so I just wonder today if we could
[1:12:09] look in the Bible and say that's
[1:12:14] me amen that's what we want to discover
[1:12:17] this morning we want to discover our
[1:12:20] identity we want to discover so let's
[1:12:23] listen very carefully for thir 30
[1:12:25] minutes and uh we have communion tonight
[1:12:29] so our service might be a little if it's
[1:12:32] a little long this morning don't worry
[1:12:34] it'll be a little shorter tonight and
[1:12:36] everything will work together for the
[1:12:38] good amen anybody want rather be some
[1:12:41] place else this morning no I'd want to
[1:12:44] be in the house of the Lord amen God
[1:12:46] bless you this morning as we listen to
[1:12:50] the portion of tape out of
[1:12:53] identification God bless you
[1:12:58] so out of this story comes this that
[1:13:01] these uh people never could afford a
[1:13:04] Looking Glass they didn't have one and
[1:13:07] the father had just a piece of a a Mara
[1:13:09] attacked on the tree to shave by on the
[1:13:12] outside they had a little boy and he
[1:13:14] this little piece of maror while he had
[1:13:16] never been able to to get up to where it
[1:13:18] was at to see himself so he come to
[1:13:21] visit in the city with uh one of his uh
[1:13:25] mother's sisters who had married a man
[1:13:27] that had come to Indiana and then they
[1:13:31] lived out there so they had a home that
[1:13:34] all oldfashioned home used to be they
[1:13:36] had a full miror on the door sometime
[1:13:39] when you would go in in in the bedrooms
[1:13:41] I don't know where any of you remember
[1:13:42] them old doors or not it had a f length
[1:13:45] mirror up and down the door so the
[1:13:48] little boy he got to his Auntie's house
[1:13:50] and he was running around like any
[1:13:52] little boy would and and then noticing
[1:13:54] he he started um to walk up the
[1:13:57] steps and as he did at the head of the
[1:14:00] steps when he's getting close to the
[1:14:02] head of the steps he begin to see
[1:14:03] another little boy appearing and he
[1:14:06] stopped and looked at the little boy of
[1:14:08] course it was he waved at him and he
[1:14:11] waved back at him and he kept getting
[1:14:14] closer and closer watching the little
[1:14:16] fell first thing he reached out his hand
[1:14:20] he looked around his parents is watching
[1:14:22] him because he' never seen a maror
[1:14:23] before he said well that that's
[1:14:26] me I just wonder today if we could look
[1:14:29] in the Bible and say that's me as we
[1:14:32] wonder which one is it um which
[1:14:36] character in The Bible would we look
[1:14:39] like and let's just take that for a
[1:14:40] little text out and stay with it for a
[1:14:43] while and as we look into God's word
[1:14:48] let's identify ourself for he give
[1:14:52] others in there for a examples of what
[1:14:56] we are now remember that God takes his
[1:15:00] Spirit or takes his man but never his
[1:15:02] Spirit Satan takes his man but never his
[1:15:05] spirit so let's see if we can identify
[1:15:08] our present State now with Bible
[1:15:11] characters now they the Bible said all
[1:15:14] those things happened back in those days
[1:15:16] for examples for us they are our
[1:15:20] examples our character molds us to the
[1:15:24] in of what we are our character of life
[1:15:28] that's in us now you take a little germ
[1:15:31] of life and when if it's a if it's a
[1:15:33] germ of U of A bird it'll produce a bird
[1:15:38] and if a germ of a of a wheat it'll
[1:15:40] produce wheat The Germ of corn it'll
[1:15:43] produce corn see the life that's in it
[1:15:46] molds a character of it then we' find
[1:15:49] the same thing like a life of a cancer
[1:15:52] see a germ cancer germ it molds a cancer
[1:15:56] it's an evil life uh life of a tumor
[1:16:00] would mold a tumor so forth you see we
[1:16:03] our characters is molded but what's on
[1:16:06] the inside of us and our outside only
[1:16:10] expresses what's on the inside what we
[1:16:13] are how we walk no matter what we say
[1:16:16] our life speaks louder than our words
[1:16:19] does if we might say I am a believer in
[1:16:23] God and I'd say well do you believe all
[1:16:27] the Bible Well I don't know then you see
[1:16:30] your your your lips your very if your
[1:16:34] life is speaking louder than than what
[1:16:36] your words would be if you say I am a
[1:16:40] Christian I do not believe in doing and
[1:16:43] I believe all that God said is true then
[1:16:46] live any kind of a life after that see
[1:16:49] your your life speaks louder than what
[1:16:51] your testimony does and you know that's
[1:16:53] one of the greatest hindrance that the
[1:16:57] Church of God has The Bootlegger The
[1:17:01] Gambler the that people we we all know
[1:17:04] which way they're headed and they know
[1:17:06] themselves but the fellow that professes
[1:17:09] to be a Christian the woman that
[1:17:10] professes to be a Christian and then
[1:17:13] lives something different it's the
[1:17:15] greatest stumbling block that the
[1:17:17] outside world has got if there is in the
[1:17:20] outside world any words worse than
[1:17:22] anything the world can produce is a
[1:17:24] person that's supposed to be a Christian
[1:17:26] and then live something else different
[1:17:28] from that lying stealing cheating and
[1:17:31] doing things that he ought not to do
[1:17:33] it's a discredit to his testimony when
[1:17:36] you take people that do those things
[1:17:38] there and they
[1:17:40] are there our character is molded uh in
[1:17:44] there by the life that is in us now we'
[1:17:47] say uh Jesus came to save that which was
[1:17:50] lost that's what he did and now they had
[1:17:54] had to be something to save this lost so
[1:17:56] it had to be a different character than
[1:17:58] that which was lost so we find then when
[1:18:01] God looked down upon this creation of
[1:18:05] his that he had made upon the his the
[1:18:09] characters of this Earth his loving
[1:18:12] character his self was molded into the
[1:18:17] person of Jesus Christ to be the savior
[1:18:20] of the world this was done so he could
[1:18:24] pay the penalty for death for us and
[1:18:28] redeem us it certainly fulfilled John
[1:18:31] 3:16 see that God no other person could
[1:18:36] do it Jesus could been no one else there
[1:18:39] was no other character anywhere could
[1:18:41] have produced such a person as Jesus
[1:18:43] Christ but God
[1:18:46] himself now there was nothing in the
[1:18:48] heaven that could have done it you know
[1:18:50] John looked in the the book there the
[1:18:52] Bible we find that he saw
[1:18:55] uh there was no one upon the Earth that
[1:18:58] was worthy to take the book The Book of
[1:19:00] redemption and there was nobody in
[1:19:02] heaven worthy nobody that was beneath
[1:19:05] the Earth or nowhere was able or worthy
[1:19:08] to take the book to loose the seals or
[1:19:11] to even look on it and he wept because
[1:19:14] in this book was a book of redemption
[1:19:16] his own name was in there and nobody was
[1:19:19] worthy and then one of the elders said
[1:19:22] fear not for the line of the tri of
[1:19:25] Judah has prevailed and he's worthy John
[1:19:28] looked then to see a a lion and he saw a
[1:19:32] lamb and it must have been a slaying
[1:19:34] lamb it was a bloody lamb he said it was
[1:19:38] full of blood because it was a lamb that
[1:19:40] had been slay and a slaying lamb is
[1:19:42] bloody of course had been slain from the
[1:19:45] foundation of the world he came and
[1:19:47] tucked the book there was nobody else
[1:19:51] could do it because if you plant any
[1:19:54] like a c Cur in the ground any of you
[1:19:56] Arkansas your know what a cleur is and
[1:19:59] put that in the ground you can't expect
[1:20:01] a harvest a crop of horn out of it no
[1:20:04] you can't so if you took a cleur and put
[1:20:07] it with a and crossed it up with a gyss
[1:20:10] and weed you still wouldn't have nothing
[1:20:12] see and see there's no character in
[1:20:15] there but what would produce the same
[1:20:17] character evil to evil so it taken
[1:20:21] something that was not evil that could
[1:20:25] produce a character like Jesus Christ
[1:20:28] and it was God looking upon his creation
[1:20:32] and his own loving character seeing that
[1:20:38] lost yet In His Image made for his glory
[1:20:42] and see that
[1:20:44] lost his own love projected Jesus Christ
[1:20:49] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:20:53] only begotten son that was God
[1:20:56] manifesting himself not some other
[1:20:59] person but himself in a body form to
[1:21:03] redeem what had been lost I wonder how
[1:21:08] sad that must have been when God looked
[1:21:11] upon the Earth and it grieved him that
[1:21:13] he ever made man one time I I had my
[1:21:16] little girl over the hand and we was up
[1:21:19] in Cincinnati at the zoo and we were
[1:21:20] going down along watching the animals
[1:21:23] and I heard a great noise down below the
[1:21:26] the the cages where the the animals such
[1:21:29] as wolves and tigers and so forth forth
[1:21:32] I walk down there there's a huge big
[1:21:34] cage all as high as a ceiling perhaps
[1:21:37] and they just got an eagle a little all
[1:21:39] a few weeks before that out of U and put
[1:21:42] him in captivity I never felt so sorry
[1:21:45] for that poor fell and he would get back
[1:21:48] he's a big bird and here he was all
[1:21:51] caged up with some something that man
[1:21:54] had done it trapped him into something
[1:21:56] and put him in a cage and that big fell
[1:21:58] he was bleeding over the head his great
[1:22:01] bald eagle that big white head and and
[1:22:04] his wings all the feathers is beat off
[1:22:06] of him like that and the poor old Fell's
[1:22:08] laying on his back his eyes weary
[1:22:11] looking around you get up walk back over
[1:22:14] the other side of the cage and look up
[1:22:15] towards the heavens that's where he come
[1:22:17] from he's a Heavenly bird there's
[1:22:20] nothing can follow him a HW could
[1:22:22] disintegrate to try to follow him
[1:22:24] nothing can follow that eagle and he
[1:22:26] goes so high his eyes is comparative
[1:22:29] with his height he can see what he's
[1:22:31] doing when he's up there what good does
[1:22:33] you get up there if you don't know what
[1:22:34] you're
[1:22:35] doing so God like in His prophets the
[1:22:37] Eagles the foresees things before they
[1:22:39] happen now I notice him bleeding he lay
[1:22:42] on his back and look up like that that's
[1:22:44] where he belonged but man had caged him
[1:22:48] I thought what a pitiful sight he get
[1:22:51] back and he'd fly flop those big wings
[1:22:54] and just Bud his head against those bars
[1:22:56] and fall back and the Flor again lay
[1:22:59] there weary look around like that
[1:23:01] looking that Heavens where he was free
[1:23:03] up there at one time and now in a cage I
[1:23:06] stood there and cried I wish they had
[1:23:08] sold me the thing I turned him loose
[1:23:10] there see anything caged up if that
[1:23:13] would make a man who loves outdoors as I
[1:23:17] love
[1:23:18] Outdoors if I would make a man cry to
[1:23:21] look at that that was a pitiful sight
[1:23:24] but all let me give you a more pitiful
[1:23:27] sight is to see men and women who were
[1:23:30] made in the image of God to bear his
[1:23:33] character yet housed into things and
[1:23:37] housed in by the traps of the world see
[1:23:39] a beautiful young lady coming down the
[1:23:41] street such a a a real U her her such a
[1:23:47] pretty woman and her pretty hair all cut
[1:23:51] off see her face with with a a pretty
[1:23:54] shaped face with so much paint on she
[1:23:56] can't tell what she looks like look like
[1:23:57] she's cankered with blue under her eyes
[1:24:00] and eyes like a lizard or a wolf or
[1:24:02] something like that and to see her with
[1:24:04] clothes on it she shouldn't be even
[1:24:06] caught into the the bedroom herself with
[1:24:09] the doors locked with them on and out on
[1:24:11] the street displaying herself like that
[1:24:14] and to see sons of God which ought to
[1:24:19] recognize that to be their sister out on
[1:24:22] the street whistling and trying to pick
[1:24:23] her up take her out for bad purposes
[1:24:26] that's a pitiful sight to see that Satan
[1:24:30] has caged in the human
[1:24:33] race there's nothing could save it but a
[1:24:37] character that could come over the top
[1:24:39] of all of that yes that there was
[1:24:42] nothing in it that had to come from that
[1:24:44] pure Fountain of almighty God that
[1:24:48] pretty little lady who could be a a real
[1:24:50] little Queen to some little tired
[1:24:52] preacher come in and take him up on her
[1:24:55] laps and put her arms around him and and
[1:24:57] quieten him down there's nothing will
[1:24:59] take that place that's part of a man
[1:25:02] there's no hand can touch you when
[1:25:04] you're tired more out but a real kind
[1:25:06] gentle wife who understands man knows
[1:25:09] that and to see her out like that she's
[1:25:11] in a cage that Hollywood has put her in
[1:25:15] and many times them women claim to be
[1:25:18] Christians and singing
[1:25:20] choirs but all caged up with a spirit
[1:25:24] that they can't see there's no need for
[1:25:26] you try to point it out to them seem
[1:25:27] like it gets get worse and worse see
[1:25:30] there they are a modern
[1:25:33] jell walking on the streets and she I
[1:25:35] give you to understand I belong to this
[1:25:37] I see still that that thing she belong
[1:25:40] to has has cut her off from the resource
[1:25:43] of life amen
[1:25:46] amen when she was born to be a little
[1:25:48] Queen for some man or some man that was
[1:25:51] born to be a a a son of God and to think
[1:25:57] what has happened to them oh it's a
[1:26:00] terrible thing then see God came down
[1:26:05] and the character of God was Christ he
[1:26:08] he was the reflection he was God made
[1:26:13] visible notice God made visible in the
[1:26:17] beginning was God he wasn't even God
[1:26:20] then no God's an object of worship only
[1:26:24] he was was eternal and in him was
[1:26:27] attributes and those attributes were
[1:26:30] thoughts and those thoughts was Express
[1:26:32] the words and word was made manifest
[1:26:34] what is it it's all God becoming
[1:26:38] tangible and you are part of God and
[1:26:42] Jesus come to redeem those that was put
[1:26:45] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:26:48] foundation of the world it was in God's
[1:26:50] thoughts and that's what he come to
[1:26:52] redeem amen and them as soon as it
[1:26:55] strikes to them they see it because the
[1:26:59] life is in there but if the life isn't
[1:27:01] in there then what can they
[1:27:03] do they don't see it they'll never see
[1:27:06] it see in the whole thing is Jesus said
[1:27:08] at that day you'll know I'm the father
[1:27:10] father me I and you and you and me the
[1:27:13] whole thing is God becoming
[1:27:15] material like a husband and wife
[1:27:18] becoming one together God and his church
[1:27:22] becoming one now now it taken something
[1:27:26] to redeem this Fallen woman which was
[1:27:28] typified in Eve when she fell Adam was
[1:27:32] not deceived but the woman being
[1:27:35] deceived was in the transgression Adam
[1:27:37] know that he was doing wrong she didn't
[1:27:40] that's the reason I'm not hurt your
[1:27:42] feelings but you know I've always stood
[1:27:45] part I don't agree with women ministers
[1:27:47] because it's not supposed to be that way
[1:27:49] see she's the weaker vessel now we find
[1:27:52] that this woman was deceived
[1:27:54] by um someone quoting her the word and
[1:27:58] just missed it a little bit that's what
[1:28:00] caused all the trouble reason Paul said
[1:28:02] let her keep silent the church is not
[1:28:04] permitted or speak so forth now notice
[1:28:07] but see all that is it's displaying
[1:28:09] showing by type like the whole Bible God
[1:28:12] coming together with a redeemed wife a
[1:28:16] bride that God had in his mind before
[1:28:19] the foundation of the world that was the
[1:28:21] attributes of God being displayed and
[1:28:23] now to make a character that could
[1:28:26] redeem this woman it had to be something
[1:28:29] greater in her to redeem her and did you
[1:28:32] ever noticed I I this may be now if some
[1:28:35] of my Armenian brothers are uh of
[1:28:38] doctrine that is legalist would disagree
[1:28:40] just let me just pardon me for a minute
[1:28:43] I might project this if he is the
[1:28:46] Redeemer I don't say this to hurt now it
[1:28:48] be different I Don't Preach Doctrine but
[1:28:51] let me ask you something if he is a
[1:28:53] redeem rer he come a redeem is to pick
[1:28:56] up that which has fallen to redeem back
[1:29:00] to a place where it was at the beginning
[1:29:03] so none will be picked up but them that
[1:29:06] was in his thoughts at the beginning
[1:29:08] amen he come to redeem not this Canon
[1:29:12] father that we see around professing to
[1:29:14] be Christians but that he came to
[1:29:17] redeem that was in God's thinking at the
[1:29:20] beginning Hallelujah this other is just
[1:29:22] something mies around the show the
[1:29:24] statue see it is it's a it's a guard and
[1:29:27] a flower guard it plays its part but the
[1:29:29] statue is what you want to see the
[1:29:31] statue of Christ which was God projected
[1:29:35] to the Earth in the form of a man amen
[1:29:38] amen that's a statue you want to
[1:29:41] see that's the one this other is just
[1:29:44] makeup part you see now this reflected
[1:29:47] his loving noble character God reflected
[1:29:52] in a man called Christ he was only one
[1:29:56] that could do this there was no other
[1:29:58] character in heaven could do it see was
[1:30:01] God he was a sinless nature he was the
[1:30:06] word sinless nature of God he was the
[1:30:12] word expressed which the word was the
[1:30:15] beginning and if you are in the Lamb's
[1:30:19] Book of Life you was God's expression
[1:30:23] from he stopped he's seen you and seen
[1:30:26] your desire before there even was a an
[1:30:30] Adam or anything else and you are his
[1:30:32] thought made word and expressed in what
[1:30:35] you are now amen that's God in you
[1:30:38] reflecting
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:42] Christ you know what I mean I I hope
[1:30:45] that don't interfere with nothing you
[1:30:47] see and I wouldn't want to say nothing
[1:30:48] contrary to what you've been taught but
[1:30:50] just so that you to understand what I'm
[1:30:51] trying to get to here a reflection
[1:30:54] you've got to be identified and if you
[1:30:57] are and you were in God's thinking at
[1:31:01] the beginning see and was his reflection
[1:31:05] here on Earth you'll bear record of the
[1:31:09] Heavenly and as he bore record of the
[1:31:13] Heavenly also and when he raised up from
[1:31:17] the grave and was given a body we when
[1:31:20] we raise up will have a body like his
[1:31:22] own amen glory body the resurrection is
[1:31:26] sure it's a guarantee and we have the
[1:31:28] earnest of it now as the Holy Spirit
[1:31:31] comes in and identifies us as God's
[1:31:34] redeemed person the Lord amen when you
[1:31:38] receive the Holy Ghost you're sealed
[1:31:41] till the journey is over that is your
[1:31:43] token that you hold it shows that your
[1:31:46] your fair has been paid you are a
[1:31:48] redeemed character Satan has no business
[1:31:52] with you none whatever this pick up your
[1:31:54] token and show him my healing is paid
[1:31:59] for my trip the glories a token is what
[1:32:02] you use to ride on a bus line or an
[1:32:05] airplane your ticket is your token see
[1:32:07] take your token your redeemed the
[1:32:10] blessing the Holy Spirit and if Satan
[1:32:12] tries to push something on you just show
[1:32:14] this that's your
[1:32:17] identification amen you are identified
[1:32:20] in the resurrection of Christ
[1:32:25] you're identified in his death when you
[1:32:27] die you're identified in his
[1:32:28] resurrection and by that it identifies
[1:32:31] you that you were with him before the
[1:32:33] foundation of the world because you are
[1:32:35] redeemed that's brought back all the
[1:32:38] father has given me will come and no man
[1:32:41] can come unless he the father has given
[1:32:44] see in the beginning now notice he was
[1:32:47] sinful sinless to take a place out the
[1:32:51] sinful the antidote he was with without
[1:32:54] sin so that he might redeem Sinners God
[1:32:57] was expressed in him and properly
[1:33:02] identified himself in him now notice you
[1:33:07] say brother Brandon did you say God
[1:33:08] identified himself he did uh in the
[1:33:12] beginning said St John 1 was the word
[1:33:16] and the Word was with God now a word has
[1:33:20] to be a thought before it's a word
[1:33:22] because a word is a thought expr rest in
[1:33:24] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:33:26] was with God and the Word was God see
[1:33:31] was God and the word the word was made
[1:33:35] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:33:38] identified
[1:33:40] how now Hebrews 4 see the word of God is
[1:33:45] sharper more powerful than a two-age
[1:33:47] sword cutting aund go coming and going
[1:33:51] cut aund and a discerner of the thoughts
[1:33:55] and intents of the heart and when he did
[1:33:59] that that's how the prophets was
[1:34:01] identified because they God would speak
[1:34:04] and tell them just what was wrong and
[1:34:06] what was going on see that is the
[1:34:10] identification of the word of the hour
[1:34:13] being made manifest that he was a
[1:34:16] fullness of God's word for he was the
[1:34:19] fullness of the godhead bodily amen he
[1:34:22] was God in human form and took God to
[1:34:27] express such a character as this and
[1:34:29] then that lovely life had to be taken
[1:34:32] from him so that he could save these
[1:34:35] that God's for knowledge saw in the
[1:34:38] beginning which was his thoughts of you
[1:34:42] and me Jesus came to do that his perfect
[1:34:45] life had to be sacrificed to redeem that
[1:34:49] person then if they do and you were with
[1:34:53] God in his thoughts at the beginning how
[1:34:56] can you deny his word being true yes
[1:34:59] when you are part of his
[1:35:02] word amen certainly Vindicated properly
[1:35:07] they could be no mistake about it he
[1:35:10] said it's not me that doeth the works
[1:35:12] it's my
[1:35:14] father that dwelleth in me now we find
[1:35:18] out that in the great turmoil of the day
[1:35:22] the people about understanding God God
[1:35:25] and three persons God is three
[1:35:29] attributes of God like three offices God
[1:35:33] above us in the Holy Spirit up there in
[1:35:35] a pillar of fire god made flesh and
[1:35:38] dwelt Among Us a man that we could touch
[1:35:40] and handle now God in the church God
[1:35:44] above you God with you God in you see
[1:35:48] the same God in three different
[1:35:50] manifestations but the same God all the
[1:35:53] time
[1:35:54] notice there be no mistakes his sinless
[1:35:57] nature expressed God's word and the only
[1:36:01] way that you'll ever be able to express
[1:36:05] God's word that you believe it and watch
[1:36:07] it act behind you you'll have to have
[1:36:09] that sinless nature that come from God
[1:36:12] before the foundation of the world you
[1:36:14] was recognized with him before the word
[1:36:17] can ever express itself through you it
[1:36:20] takes a sinless nature to do that so
[1:36:23] much
[1:36:24] so he was the word in full the word of
[1:36:28] God flowed through him so freely that
[1:36:31] even he could speak a word it would
[1:36:34] create that showed who he was who can
[1:36:37] create but God God's the only Creator
[1:36:40] there is and he was so perfect in
[1:36:42] harmony him and the Word was so
[1:36:44] perfectly together until he created even
[1:36:47] he had he and the word being one no
[1:36:50] other nature could do this no father
[1:36:54] nature could no character nothing in the
[1:36:57] heavens nothing else could do that but
[1:36:59] him for he was the beginning of that
[1:37:03] character
[1:37:05] savior the angel wasn't born to
[1:37:08] savior he was created a being to worship
[1:37:12] God not a savior but in God was a savior
[1:37:16] an ordinary man born of an ordinary
[1:37:18] woman couldn't be a savior because his
[1:37:20] nature is carnal but it taken God
[1:37:25] himself amen I hope you see it look that
[1:37:29] was the expression to manifest such a
[1:37:32] character as
[1:37:34] that for others it was a fallen
[1:37:37] character nothing could save Angels
[1:37:40] wasn't created for such man was a
[1:37:42] falling character look how could this
[1:37:46] man look to show it's the ones that he
[1:37:49] thought
[1:37:50] of but his thoughts is the Christian out
[1:37:54] today the thoughts before the foundation
[1:37:56] of the world now remember man when he
[1:38:00] was bned in sin shaped in iniquity comes
[1:38:04] to the world speaking lies yes is that
[1:38:07] right right there's nothing in him at
[1:38:10] all amen so you see if he was in God's
[1:38:13] thoughts when he come to the world he's
[1:38:16] come in God's thoughts at the beginning
[1:38:18] to display his attribute you follow me
[1:38:22] amen then Jesus J came to break the
[1:38:25] clouds back so that attribute could
[1:38:28] display
[1:38:29] itself Hallelujah he is God's expressed
[1:38:34] word now nothing else could be
[1:38:36] manifested other characters are all
[1:38:38] Fallen then you see what did Jesus come
[1:38:41] to bring back those characters no no
[1:38:44] they were borned in sin shaped in
[1:38:46] iniquity he came as a redeemer and to
[1:38:49] redeem anything is to bring it back yes
[1:38:56] amen bring it back it was God's thought
[1:39:01] you think little you little
[1:39:04] me no one in the world could take my
[1:39:07] place nobody can take yours you being a
[1:39:10] Christian and filled with the spirit got
[1:39:12] him before the foundation World seen you
[1:39:15] in not every feature that you
[1:39:17] got and Jesus come to bring you back
[1:39:21] that's what Jesus was here for the
[1:39:23] Redeemer the human body to bring you
[1:39:26] back that had to come to be a human as a
[1:39:28] redeemer to display his attributes as
[1:39:30] Savior come to redeem you and bring you
[1:39:33] back from where you come from you are
[1:39:37] when you receive eternal life is only
[1:39:39] one form of eternal life that's the
[1:39:42] Greek word Zoe is that right brother Zoe
[1:39:44] God's own life so you being a son you
[1:39:47] become part of that life so the life
[1:39:51] that's in you never did begin that it
[1:39:53] never can End Amen right Hallelujah
[1:39:57] think of it it can't end because
[1:40:00] anything it's Eternal never
[1:40:02] began the life that's in you never did
[1:40:05] begin that is if you've got eternal life
[1:40:08] and that's God for you as in thought on
[1:40:11] the Eternal and now it's expressed here
[1:40:13] in a human being for his
[1:40:15] glory amen Jesus came to redeem that
[1:40:19] being the son the fullness of God had to
[1:40:21] come and become that the sinless
[1:40:23] character God did that he might redeem
[1:40:25] these other thoughts that to come to him
[1:40:27] to make a wife see what I mean oh it's a
[1:40:29] glorious story we ain't AR to get on
[1:40:31] that anyhow let's go on all
[1:40:39] right there's more there than we could
[1:40:41] ever
[1:40:42] cover here gra gra me my little note did
[1:40:45] you enjoy
[1:40:47] that now the the message is
[1:40:51] identification amen and and he's telling
[1:40:55] us what it is that we
[1:40:58] need to identify
[1:41:02] with is that
[1:41:04] right so uh and so uh I I just think
[1:41:10] that there's enough there that you heard
[1:41:13] to uh
[1:41:16] certainly
[1:41:17] uh raise a a thirst in you yes that you
[1:41:22] would go pursue that a little farther
[1:41:27] and and listen to what's just been spoke
[1:41:31] to you that uh and I love the way that
[1:41:35] he unfolds this he says that in the
[1:41:38] scripture he said that we should be able
[1:41:41] to find our
[1:41:43] identification in the scripture to be
[1:41:46] able to read the scripture and say
[1:41:49] that's me that I see myself alive in
[1:41:53] God's word uh living and uh uh uh and
[1:42:00] there a character he said in the Bible
[1:42:04] find some character in the Bible that
[1:42:07] you identify with that you say that's me
[1:42:10] I'm like that and that was all planned
[1:42:13] that way it was all put that way because
[1:42:16] we are a part of him in the beginning so
[1:42:20] he makes a statement when he starts out
[1:42:22] he says the character of something is
[1:42:25] developed by what's in
[1:42:29] them so we we we recognize that if the
[1:42:34] seed of something's in there that that
[1:42:37] seed has the power within it to
[1:42:41] transform so he said if it was bird life
[1:42:44] in the beginning it'll be a bird if it's
[1:42:48] uh some other life uh in it an animal
[1:42:51] life or some other life
[1:42:53] uh it's a bird many times you would
[1:42:56] refer to like Beethoven or um
[1:43:00] Michelangelo or or if you had that
[1:43:02] spirit in you then that Spirit would
[1:43:05] produce what that it is you'd be a
[1:43:08] painter you would be this so there's got
[1:43:11] to be a a a a spirit in you and uh
[1:43:17] something that is molding and making the
[1:43:21] character uh that you are and so that's
[1:43:27] kind of what I begin to if I could say
[1:43:30] it that way that begin to uh I begin to
[1:43:35] realize what he he said he said that you
[1:43:38] have to be
[1:43:41] identified and I I walking through the
[1:43:45] uh uh the TSA you know where you go in
[1:43:49] to get on a plane the guy took my card
[1:43:52] and he looked at me and he said oh that
[1:43:54] looks like
[1:43:56] you and I thought looks like me that is
[1:44:01] me you you understand
[1:44:05] now we we're so much right now still in
[1:44:09] the thinking of it looks like me it
[1:44:12] looks like me or I'm trying to be you
[1:44:16] know I didn't look at him and says yeah
[1:44:18] that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying
[1:44:20] to look like him that that's my goal you
[1:44:24] know is that eventually I could I could
[1:44:28] uh have all the features that I look
[1:44:31] like
[1:44:32] myself no I'm not trying to look like
[1:44:36] myself that is
[1:44:39] me all that picture was was a reflection
[1:44:43] of me so that's what I
[1:44:46] am that's me know it don't look like me
[1:44:50] it don't uh it it it it doesn't uh
[1:44:54] resemble me it is me it is a picture of
[1:44:58] me and that's what he wanted to begin to
[1:45:01] get us to look at the scriptures that
[1:45:03] way this is a picture of me I'm not
[1:45:07] reading about somebody else I'm reading
[1:45:10] about
[1:45:11] me I I I'm seeing myself in here this is
[1:45:16] I'm finding my
[1:45:21] identification I I'm finding
[1:45:23] I'm I'm discovering who that I really am
[1:45:27] by the word of God now the world will
[1:45:31] let me discover the the person that I
[1:45:34] was born into the world I was born in
[1:45:37] sin shaped in iniquity came into the
[1:45:40] world speaking lies The Whole World's
[1:45:43] identification is of that person that's
[1:45:47] right that's what they're trying to
[1:45:49] identify they're trying to identify you
[1:45:52] as the one that's got to be educated try
[1:45:54] to identify you as the one that's got to
[1:45:56] labor and work trying to identify you as
[1:45:59] this and identifying you that what they
[1:46:01] want you to do is to find your place in
[1:46:04] the
[1:46:06] world well we're not of the
[1:46:09] world we didn't come from the
[1:46:13] world we came from there there's another
[1:46:19] identification that we have there and
[1:46:21] there ought to be a way that we can uh
[1:46:24] identify ourselves and the prophet of
[1:46:26] God made a statement he says in the
[1:46:29] state that you're
[1:46:31] in can you identify yourself with the
[1:46:39] word so that we we find this great mind
[1:46:45] battle and and it it throws us into a
[1:46:50] very difficult
[1:46:53] uh battle if I could say it that or
[1:46:57] position because you have the word of
[1:47:00] God telling
[1:47:01] you that if you had eternal life you
[1:47:05] always had eternal
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:10] life right he said that God didn't come
[1:47:14] to redeem this Atomic F that's out there
[1:47:18] he came to redeem those that were in his
[1:47:21] thoughts
[1:47:23] amen
[1:47:25] amen now you're born in sin shaped in
[1:47:28] iniquity come into the world speaking
[1:47:30] lies but you were deceived into
[1:47:34] that by
[1:47:36] Eve that's right that that's why you
[1:47:39] were here and that's why that that
[1:47:42] that's the the thing that we had is we
[1:47:44] had a divorcement from that
[1:47:47] nature that we can become who that we
[1:47:51] really are
[1:47:54] I hope that this can move into us
[1:47:58] because the the thing that the prophet
[1:48:01] of God said he said this is the age of
[1:48:06] identification so it it's a time of
[1:48:08] choosing it's a time of how that you're
[1:48:12] going to how how that you're going to uh
[1:48:15] uh do yourself brother I love it when
[1:48:18] you clap but you got to hold it down
[1:48:20] just a little bit so everybody else can
[1:48:22] hear
[1:48:23] okay you do that for us all right cuz
[1:48:27] sometimes people can't hear and I want
[1:48:29] to hear this real good is that that if
[1:48:33] you get caught in between those two
[1:48:38] places you understand where you're
[1:48:40] dealing with what you think you are and
[1:48:43] what you see you are and what you're
[1:48:46] doing and what God says that you are it
[1:48:50] places you into a spot that you're going
[1:48:53] to have to choose and what you're going
[1:48:55] to identify
[1:48:59] with CU said now what am I going to
[1:49:01] identify with what is identifying
[1:49:07] me and that that's the
[1:49:11] groundwork because if you don't start
[1:49:13] with that nothing can follow that's and
[1:49:18] so for my little
[1:49:20] thought this morning and I'm I I I I
[1:49:22] think there's so much in there that I
[1:49:24] don't really need to speak very long at
[1:49:28] all
[1:49:32] but
[1:49:33] if if I've always had eternal
[1:49:37] life is that what he
[1:49:41] said that I I I I didn't
[1:49:46] get e eternal life if I have it I always
[1:49:50] had it you said how how did you always
[1:49:53] have it you weren't here I I just came
[1:49:56] here a as an expression of a thought so
[1:50:01] I was in God's thinking before the
[1:50:03] foundation of the world can you identify
[1:50:06] with that this morning can you look at
[1:50:09] yourself and say I was in God's thinking
[1:50:12] before the foundation of the
[1:50:18] world I identify with
[1:50:21] that and why do I identify that because
[1:50:24] he said
[1:50:28] so and he and so I I I'm sitting here
[1:50:32] and if I had eternal life and I always
[1:50:35] had eternal life then the question Rises
[1:50:39] up
[1:50:41] is what if I've always had eternal life
[1:50:44] then what was I saved from
[1:50:55] uh that's right I mean was I
[1:50:59] I uh we say I I'm saved from sin what is
[1:51:06] sin it's
[1:51:09] unbelief it's unbelief that that's what
[1:51:13] that's what I'm saved from I I I'm saved
[1:51:16] from I'm saved from sin I'm saved from
[1:51:19] unbelief now I'm not saved to
[1:51:26] salvation as as man has always taught it
[1:51:30] or expressed it but if I could sum it up
[1:51:33] this way to to
[1:51:38] uh may maybe help it sink in because if
[1:51:42] we're going to express our identity
[1:51:46] we've got to realize what is it that I'm
[1:51:49] identifying with and what is my char
[1:51:52] characteristics to prove that's
[1:51:55] me that's
[1:51:58] me I'm that
[1:52:01] seed I'm that person whose name was
[1:52:04] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:52:06] that's me I identify with
[1:52:09] that that's absolutely the the the truth
[1:52:13] he said so I believe it he he that's
[1:52:16] what he came to
[1:52:17] do he came to redeem it back now let's
[1:52:23] just read this to you in just for a
[1:52:27] moment
[1:52:30] and to read it slow and and just go
[1:52:34] through it so you can kind of see what
[1:52:37] it is that
[1:52:40] uh we're we're trying to express here so
[1:52:43] we're going to drop back in paragraph
[1:52:47] 72 and just go back through this just
[1:52:51] for a second
[1:52:54] because he said you are identified in
[1:52:56] the resurrection of Christ you are
[1:52:59] identified in his death when you died
[1:53:03] you're identified in his
[1:53:05] resurrection and by that it identifies
[1:53:09] you that you were with him before the
[1:53:13] foundation of the world cuz you are
[1:53:17] redeemed that's brought back so remember
[1:53:21] redemp
[1:53:23] is not the Redemption it's redeem means
[1:53:27] to bring back to be lifted up so he came
[1:53:32] here to lift you up he came here to
[1:53:37] bring you back to the characteristics
[1:53:41] that you had in his thinking before the
[1:53:44] foundation of the world he came to bring
[1:53:48] you back now remember how he said the
[1:53:50] saddest thing that he sees is that man
[1:53:54] is in the cage of the
[1:53:58] world so Satan gave certain things to
[1:54:01] CAG men he gave education he gave
[1:54:07] science right he gave religion all those
[1:54:11] things that Satan came out of the garden
[1:54:14] of the tree of knowledge were all
[1:54:17] designed to cage
[1:54:21] you to keep you in
[1:54:24] bondage to hold you back from
[1:54:28] manifesting and coming to the
[1:54:32] character that he had of you in his
[1:54:38] mind you understand that so we just want
[1:54:42] to go through that simply he
[1:54:45] says and we'll pick up
[1:54:47] here at paragraph 71 let's read
[1:54:51] identified how
[1:54:53] Hebrews 4 see the word of God is sharper
[1:54:57] more powerful than a two-edged sword
[1:55:01] cutting aunder cutting both coming and
[1:55:04] going cutting aunder and a discerner of
[1:55:08] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:55:12] and when he did that that's how the
[1:55:15] prophet was identified because God would
[1:55:18] speak and tell them just what was wrong
[1:55:21] and what was was going on see that is
[1:55:24] the identification of the word of the
[1:55:26] hour being made
[1:55:29] manifest so we understand that was the
[1:55:33] identification but what was that word
[1:55:36] doing it was cutting a sun cutting to
[1:55:40] the marrow of the bone try to discern
[1:55:44] your
[1:55:46] heart and your thoughts that's right
[1:55:50] that's what he wants to get you because
[1:55:51] the battles in the mind he wants to get
[1:55:54] you to what is your pure thoughts what
[1:55:57] is your pure desire what are you
[1:55:59] identifying with because he who loves
[1:56:02] the world and the things of the world
[1:56:04] the love of God's Not in
[1:56:08] them that's not where their heart
[1:56:12] is that's not where their thoughts
[1:56:15] are you can't serve two
[1:56:19] masters either you're stayed on the
[1:56:22] world word of God you're believing what
[1:56:24] the word of God says you're feeding on
[1:56:27] the word of God you understand that this
[1:56:30] message isn't something to study it's a
[1:56:32] living guide that comes to you each day
[1:56:36] and leads you through every situation
[1:56:39] day by
[1:56:42] day you've got to live on
[1:56:45] it you've got to feed on it you got to
[1:56:48] Feast on it in other words it's that
[1:56:50] which you find your a
[1:56:54] in because what's it doing it's cutting
[1:56:58] away it's cutting away it's carving away
[1:57:02] it's hewing
[1:57:05] out trying to bring you into the
[1:57:09] character of what that God had in his
[1:57:13] mind of
[1:57:15] you it's transforming you now is that
[1:57:19] the desire of your heart
[1:57:22] that's right is that what you identify
[1:57:25] with make me mold me turn me into what
[1:57:28] you have me to be I'm not trying to
[1:57:30] fulfill anybody else's spot I can't take
[1:57:33] nobody else's spot I want to be what you
[1:57:36] made me to
[1:57:40] be and I I believe you made me to be
[1:57:46] something not a multiple
[1:57:50] choice it's not like see sitting in know
[1:57:53] I went to a uh in my high school they
[1:57:56] gave these aptitude tests you know and I
[1:57:59] hat his
[1:58:01] school I never did graduate from high
[1:58:03] school I'm not proud of that but it's
[1:58:06] nevertheless the
[1:58:07] fact so when I went in there and they
[1:58:09] did all their stuff on me they sat me
[1:58:11] down they said you know uh you could
[1:58:14] possibly be an airline
[1:58:17] pilot well they didn't know I was called
[1:58:20] to be an astronaut
[1:58:23] I was going I want to soar Way Beyond
[1:58:25] any plane could
[1:58:28] soar I thought can you imagine me
[1:58:31] pursuing that
[1:58:33] career I had to join the
[1:58:35] military which that wouldn't have
[1:58:39] worked and or I had to go to
[1:58:41] college which that wouldn't have worked
[1:58:44] it just wouldn't have
[1:58:46] worked but that's what happens when man
[1:58:49] tries to place you is trying to get you
[1:58:53] back to the place that you
[1:58:58] identify without
[1:59:01] Reserve without
[1:59:04] doubt that I am a part of
[1:59:07] him I was in his thoughts now don't look
[1:59:11] at don't look at your life don't look at
[1:59:13] your flesh don't look at the man that
[1:59:16] you were born in the sinful nature that
[1:59:19] you had
[1:59:22] because he
[1:59:24] existed and you existed it before
[1:59:30] that so now he's trying to
[1:59:33] come with the word of God and cut that
[1:59:37] aunder and separate you from
[1:59:40] that let's just follow a little
[1:59:44] further he was the fullness of God's
[1:59:47] word for he was the fullness of the
[1:59:50] godhead bodily he was God in human form
[1:59:54] and it took God to express such a
[1:59:57] character as this and then that lovely
[2:00:02] life had to be taken from him so that he
[2:00:07] could save these that God that God's
[2:00:10] forn knowledge saw in the beginning
[2:00:13] which was his thoughts of you and
[2:00:20] me so now he uses the word
[2:00:23] save so we're just going to talk just
[2:00:27] get to the the point of what it is that
[2:00:30] we're saved
[2:00:32] from he said Jesus came to do that his
[2:00:38] perfect life had to be sacrificed to
[2:00:41] redeem that person then if they do
[2:00:46] and and you were with God in his
[2:00:49] thoughts at the beginning how how can
[2:00:52] you deny his word being being true when
[2:00:56] you are part of his
[2:00:59] word you can't do
[2:01:03] it so there's got to be something
[2:01:06] else that's bringing that
[2:01:13] doubt and bringing that
[2:01:16] struggle and bringing that
[2:01:20] confusion there's got to to be something
[2:01:22] else that's doing
[2:01:24] it remember because it's not him every
[2:01:28] perfect and good thing comes from the
[2:01:30] father
[2:01:31] above but if you had eternal life and he
[2:01:34] came to restore you back or to bring you
[2:01:37] back to that then there's got to be
[2:01:40] something that's trying to resist
[2:01:44] that
[2:01:47] right it in you
[2:01:54] it's something
[2:01:56] else and we can find its original
[2:02:03] origin he
[2:02:06] said
[2:02:08] B he says his perfect life to be
[2:02:12] sacrificed he says your perver I mean
[2:02:14] certainly of Vindicated properly there
[2:02:18] could be no mistake about it it's not me
[2:02:22] that doth the works it's my father that
[2:02:25] dwelleth in
[2:02:26] me oh I hope we can roll that to
[2:02:29] ourselves now we find out that the
[2:02:32] greater turmoil of the day the people
[2:02:37] about understanding God God in three
[2:02:40] persons God it's three attributes of God
[2:02:44] like three offices God above us the Holy
[2:02:48] Spirit up there in the pillar of fire
[2:02:51] God made flesh dwelt Among Us and a man
[2:02:55] that could touch handle now God in the
[2:02:58] church God above you God with you God in
[2:03:02] you the same God in three different
[2:03:05] manifestations the same God all the time
[2:03:08] right so that's the that's the
[2:03:13] turmoil and that had to be settled
[2:03:16] yes it's the turmoil of the church that
[2:03:20] thinking
[2:03:22] that separates you from God they first
[2:03:25] then they had to separate God because if
[2:03:27] they could separate God then they could
[2:03:29] get your mind in a mind of separating
[2:03:33] you're separating this into this
[2:03:35] category separating that into that just
[2:03:38] like you're separating your life you try
[2:03:40] to separate your spiritual life from
[2:03:43] your carnal
[2:03:47] life and you're always schizophrenic
[2:03:52] you're always two
[2:03:55] people we know the flesh Wars against
[2:03:57] the spirit and the spirit against the
[2:04:00] Flesh and these two are contrary one to
[2:04:03] another but I know that I bring that
[2:04:05] flesh under subjection because I know
[2:04:08] that that's not my
[2:04:13] identity this flesh doesn't identify me
[2:04:17] the word identifies me and if I believe
[2:04:20] that word that will follow me and show
[2:04:23] up in my
[2:04:26] life notice to be no mistakes his
[2:04:30] sinless nature expresses God's word and
[2:04:34] the only way that you'll ever be able to
[2:04:37] express God's word that you believe it
[2:04:42] and watch it act behind you and you will
[2:04:46] have to have that sinless nature that
[2:04:49] comes from God
[2:04:52] that's my
[2:04:54] portion hallelu I got to believe the
[2:04:58] word and watch that word transform me
[2:05:02] into a sinless
[2:05:05] nature because it's what's in me that's
[2:05:09] going to produce the
[2:05:12] character I can't make it
[2:05:16] up I've got to believe
[2:05:20] it you see how what are you going to
[2:05:22] believe it he said
[2:05:25] so he said you had eternal life if
[2:05:28] you've got eternal life you've always
[2:05:30] had he said you were in the thoughts of
[2:05:32] God before the foundation of the world
[2:05:34] he said that
[2:05:36] you now you got to identify with that
[2:05:40] you got to believe
[2:05:44] that oh but there's an
[2:05:48] accuser so I'm just going to drop down
[2:05:50] cuz this is where my
[2:05:52] my thought is now look to show its the
[2:05:56] ones this is paragraph
[2:06:03] 77 look to show it's the ones that he
[2:06:07] thought
[2:06:08] of to show it's the ones that he thought
[2:06:13] of he's talking about
[2:06:16] redeemed he comes to bring back the ones
[2:06:20] that he thought of
[2:06:22] he comes to bring back the ones that
[2:06:24] were with him in the beginning he come
[2:06:28] it's not a multiple choice he didn't
[2:06:32] hang on the cross and say whoever has
[2:06:35] pity on me and whoever has sympathy on
[2:06:38] me and whoever believes on me will be
[2:06:42] saved that is not
[2:06:46] salvation if you can do one thing for
[2:06:48] your salvation Jesus Christ died in vain
[2:06:52] the Salvation is not based upon your
[2:06:55] choice he already made that choice for
[2:07:05] you you were already with
[2:07:08] them all he forne he predestinated then
[2:07:11] he justified them then he cleansed them
[2:07:14] then he filled them with the spirit
[2:07:17] there's so there's so much confusion out
[2:07:20] there so many people trying to explain
[2:07:23] what the spirit is trying to explain
[2:07:25] what this is trying to explain that way
[2:07:27] do you want to know where all the
[2:07:29] answers to all the questions are it's in
[2:07:31] the word of God that God brought in this
[2:07:34] generation that's where your answers
[2:07:37] are yes and it's not by Secondhand
[2:07:40] Revelation
[2:07:42] right it's by faith in his
[2:07:46] word now he he he goes through this
[2:07:49] great
[2:07:52] labor to talk to you about you were in
[2:07:55] the thoughts of God you were a part of
[2:07:57] God you were in his thinking who did he
[2:07:59] come to redeem he came to redeem those
[2:08:03] that were in his
[2:08:06] thoughts and you keep looking at
[2:08:08] yourself in this time instead of looking
[2:08:12] at yourself in that
[2:08:17] time and he come me too this is what my
[2:08:20] my battle
[2:08:22] he said to show that it's the ones he
[2:08:26] thought of his thoughts is the Christian
[2:08:29] of
[2:08:30] today the thoughts before the foundation
[2:08:34] of the world now remember a man he was
[2:08:39] born in sin shaped in iniquity come into
[2:08:42] the world speaking lies is that right
[2:08:46] there is nothing in him at all
[2:08:50] so so so you see if he was in God's
[2:08:55] thoughts when he come into the world
[2:08:59] he's he comes in God's thoughts at the
[2:09:03] beginning to display his attributes do
[2:09:06] you follow me in other words you were
[2:09:09] born in sin shaped in
[2:09:12] iniquity right you come into the world
[2:09:15] speaking
[2:09:17] lies now if there wasn't something
[2:09:21] else above
[2:09:25] that remember he said that to to have
[2:09:29] someone save you would have to be a
[2:09:31] greater character that's right than that
[2:09:34] the one you've got a sinner can't save a
[2:09:41] sinner that's why they looked at him and
[2:09:43] say oh save
[2:09:45] yourself that's what saint's trying to
[2:09:47] get us to do save ourselves but there's
[2:09:51] got to be a greater power than the
[2:09:54] character that I possess no matter how I
[2:09:57] try to develop that character no matter
[2:10:00] what it's got to be a greater power than
[2:10:02] that which I possess so he says it's got
[2:10:05] to be something bigger it's got to be
[2:10:08] something
[2:10:10] greater where was it where is
[2:10:13] it how do I find
[2:10:17] it what's going to make it real to me to
[2:10:20] show you was was those that were in his
[2:10:24] thoughts we came into the world we spoke
[2:10:26] lies then Jesus
[2:10:29] came he said do you follow
[2:10:32] me then Jesus came to break the clouds
[2:10:38] back so that attribute could display
[2:10:42] itself that's it so what are we saved
[2:10:47] from We're saved from the LIE
[2:10:54] Hallelujah that's what we're saved from
[2:10:57] the
[2:10:58] LIE the lie that Satan told you the lie
[2:11:02] that says you're a sinner the lie that
[2:11:05] that of the your flesh warn against you
[2:11:07] that's what he's come to save us from
[2:11:10] he's come to save us from the
[2:11:17] lie that you're stuck with this nature
[2:11:19] you got
[2:11:23] you were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[2:11:26] what did he come to do he come to break
[2:11:29] that cloud back so you can see the
[2:11:33] attributes that you are the attribute so
[2:11:36] that you can see that you're in his
[2:11:38] thinking that's the trouble with the
[2:11:39] world today he God ordained a prophet to
[2:11:44] be the one that opened the seals and
[2:11:47] revealed the mystery of God and rolled
[2:11:50] back the cloud that you could
[2:11:53] see that's what we're saved
[2:11:57] from We're saved from the
[2:12:02] lie and we're still believing if we're
[2:12:05] not careful we start believing his
[2:12:09] lies he's the father of Lies there's no
[2:12:13] truth in
[2:12:17] him that's all he can do is lie and he's
[2:12:21] lied to us and lied to us lied to us
[2:12:24] about religion lied to us about the
[2:12:27] Trinity lied to us about the the what
[2:12:30] baptisms are lied to us about this lied
[2:12:34] to us about that and there's only one
[2:12:36] thing that sets us free and that's the
[2:12:39] truth the truth is what set us free
[2:12:42] that's what we're safe from We're Sav
[2:12:44] from the
[2:12:47] LIE now what am I going to identify with
[2:12:52] am I going to identify with what he said
[2:12:55] or how I
[2:12:59] feel am I going to look and say see my
[2:13:02] failures and I'm going to say well
[2:13:04] that's really what I
[2:13:06] am or can when I can I get to the place
[2:13:09] where I start standing back and saying
[2:13:11] wait a
[2:13:12] minute uhuh get behind me Satan I have
[2:13:17] the seed of God in Me I'm the thoughts
[2:13:20] of God
[2:13:21] and I'm here to manifest that thoughts
[2:13:23] of God that word's here to manifest
[2:13:26] itself in
[2:13:28] me that's what I am
[2:13:32] now I might be in this chain of this
[2:13:36] habit you got me in but once I can
[2:13:39] identify that that habit is a lie
[2:13:43] hallelujah
[2:13:45] hallelujah it's a
[2:13:48] cage it's a it it's a it it's a
[2:13:56] a a
[2:13:58] deception and that I can that I can rise
[2:14:01] way up above that and I'm more than
[2:14:06] that I like what he said here he says he
[2:14:09] come to redeem listen to
[2:14:12] this this is a if you can grab this you
[2:14:18] understand and and and identify with it
[2:14:22] not only is it identifying you're
[2:14:24] identifying yourself with it but it's
[2:14:27] identifying you this message came to
[2:14:31] identify you as the thoughts of
[2:14:34] God he
[2:14:36] says he is a
[2:14:38] redeemer he come to redeem is to pick up
[2:14:44] paragraph 60 that which has
[2:14:48] fallen to redeem back to to a place
[2:14:52] where it was at at the beginning so none
[2:14:57] will be picked up but them that was in
[2:15:00] his thoughts at the
[2:15:07] beginning so if I it don't matter if I'm
[2:15:10] down I got a power greater than
[2:15:15] me right that will pick me up and Redeem
[2:15:20] Me back to where I am so what do I have
[2:15:23] to do I've got to not I've got to be
[2:15:27] saved from the lie that put me
[2:15:32] there whether it's a
[2:15:34] complex whether it's what what you grew
[2:15:39] up under whether it's the complexes
[2:15:42] Satan put on you whether it's the trials
[2:15:45] that formed you none of that matters if
[2:15:48] he said I was in his thinking before the
[2:15:51] world and he came to redeem the thought
[2:15:54] am I'm that thought then I know that he
[2:15:58] will pick me up
[2:16:01] Hallelujah and what I need to be saved
[2:16:04] from is the
[2:16:06] LIE amen amen amen amen you brought it
[2:16:09] upon yourself you deserved it you made
[2:16:12] this decision
[2:16:14] true but I'm that prodal son in my
[2:16:18] father's house are many mansions I've
[2:16:20] got a place
[2:16:22] there see that's what he's come to save
[2:16:25] us from is the
[2:16:28] lie and he goes on to say he come to
[2:16:32] redeem not this Canon fodder that we see
[2:16:36] around professing to be
[2:16:40] Christians but that he came to redeem
[2:16:45] that was in God's thinking at the
[2:16:49] beginning this mother is just something
[2:16:52] that's mixed around to show the
[2:16:58] statue
[2:17:00] Church what are we going to identify
[2:17:04] with right it's just
[2:17:07] like it's
[2:17:09] like it's like all of a sudden you've
[2:17:12] got
[2:17:14] nothing like we talked about that man
[2:17:16] that with that
[2:17:18] blanket you remember the story I just
[2:17:20] told it that he was sitting watching his
[2:17:23] television and there and somebody held
[2:17:26] up a blanket and they looked at the
[2:17:28] blanket and the guy said this Blanket's
[2:17:31] worth
[2:17:33] 250,000 or I think the guy in the
[2:17:36] television said this blanket is worth 50
[2:17:39] $60,000 at auction this guy turned
[2:17:42] around and there's a a blanket laying
[2:17:45] over the back of his
[2:17:47] couch that he's leaning against
[2:17:52] that his grandmother had given
[2:17:54] him and him and his wife grab it and
[2:17:56] they hold it up and they say these look
[2:17:58] the
[2:18:00] same and he tells the story he he had
[2:18:03] just lost a limb and he was broke and he
[2:18:06] didn't have nothing and he went and he
[2:18:09] took that blanket to
[2:18:11] auction and they started he didn't know
[2:18:14] what he
[2:18:17] had somebody had to come and roll P back
[2:18:21] the
[2:18:25] cloud now what if somebody said oh
[2:18:28] that's just an old cheap blanket my my
[2:18:33] aunt makes those all day
[2:18:37] long huh what if they would have believe
[2:18:42] that what everybody said but something
[2:18:45] rolled back his eyes yes so he took the
[2:18:50] blanket to
[2:18:52] auction and the blanket came up from
[2:18:55] auction and the first bid
[2:19:00] 50,000 and the minute that guy said
[2:19:02] 60,000 somebody offered 25,000 more
[2:19:09] 75,000 think of
[2:19:11] it then someone yelled out a 100,000 his
[2:19:15] wife were grabbing tears was running
[2:19:17] down their
[2:19:18] face the bids just kept going up and up
[2:19:23] now it was
[2:19:25] 700,000
[2:19:27] 800,000 $900,000 $1
[2:19:31] million they're sitting there
[2:19:34] shaking they had it all the
[2:19:38] time but somebody had to roll
[2:19:42] back the cloud that the
[2:19:46] attribute might be put on display
[2:19:50] what did they have they had an
[2:19:54] original novel whole blanket woven by
[2:19:57] some famous with all the original dyes
[2:20:01] from the plants and flowers nothing fake
[2:20:04] about it 100% genuine original don't you
[2:20:09] understand there's nothing fake about
[2:20:11] you you're the genuine original thoughts
[2:20:15] of God sent here to be the Bride of God
[2:20:18] Hu
[2:20:22] it's the
[2:20:24] lie that you're something else it's the
[2:20:27] lie that you're a sinner it's a lie that
[2:20:29] you're a failure it's a lie that you'll
[2:20:32] never make it we got to be safe from the
[2:20:37] lie and it's the truth that set you
[2:20:40] free and this message is the
[2:20:45] truth it's not wrapped in Trinity
[2:20:48] confusion amen
[2:20:51] he said to redeem that was the thinking
[2:20:54] beginning this other is just something
[2:20:57] around in his P he says and if you are
[2:21:01] in the Lamb's Book of Life of God's
[2:21:04] expression from his thoughts he seen you
[2:21:09] and seen your desire before there even
[2:21:12] was an adom or anything else and you are
[2:21:17] his thoughts made word the expression in
[2:21:22] what you are
[2:21:29] now that's a
[2:21:31] mouthful but I look at
[2:21:34] myself do I see that you know why I
[2:21:38] don't see it I'm believing the
[2:21:42] lie but if I believe what he
[2:21:48] said then I'm his work
[2:21:53] word and he'll lift me
[2:21:55] up he's my
[2:21:58] redeemer to bring me back to where I was
[2:22:00] in the
[2:22:02] beginning the LI say you're the LI say
[2:22:06] you're here you're stuck you're a sinner
[2:22:09] but that's not what he
[2:22:11] said he said I was in his thoughts at
[2:22:13] the beginning I've already had eternal
[2:22:15] life so what am I looking for there's a
[2:22:18] greater
[2:22:19] power that's going to lift me up and
[2:22:23] bring me to what that he thought of
[2:22:26] me do you believe
[2:22:29] it he'll do it for
[2:22:33] you if is that your heart's
[2:22:36] desire that's why the word of God goes
[2:22:39] out it's trying to keep getting to you
[2:22:42] and cutting you till you get to the
[2:22:44] place I don't desire the world or the
[2:22:47] things of the world I desire life and
[2:22:50] life more
[2:22:51] abundant and when you identify with that
[2:22:55] the redeemer's there yes with a greater
[2:22:58] power than you have to bring you up and
[2:23:02] lift you up oh I love it it's not it's
[2:23:06] what you are now so you would understand
[2:23:09] that I'm trying to get here a reflection
[2:23:13] you've got to be
[2:23:16] identified amen he's trying to identify
[2:23:20] you
[2:23:21] he's rolling the cloud
[2:23:25] back
[2:23:27] he's diminishing the
[2:23:30] lie that Satan said about you about your
[2:23:35] nature about your personality all of
[2:23:38] it's a lie you say why do you why
[2:23:42] there's a blood
[2:23:45] there that paid that
[2:23:48] price that separated ated you from that
[2:23:52] marriage you had when you were born in
[2:23:55] sin shaped in iniquity and he's
[2:23:58] restoring us back and bringing us back
[2:24:01] and I like to read this last thing the
[2:24:03] musicians can
[2:24:07] come he came as
[2:24:09] Redeemer and to redeem anything is to
[2:24:13] bring it back bring it back it was God's
[2:24:18] thought you think little you little me
[2:24:23] no one in the world can take my place
[2:24:26] nobody can take your place you're being
[2:24:30] a Christian and filled with the spirit
[2:24:34] God became before the foundation of the
[2:24:37] world seen you and knew every feature
[2:24:42] that you got see and Jesus come to bring
[2:24:47] you back
[2:24:50] where did we get the idea that we
[2:24:53] already had to be
[2:24:57] there that's the
[2:24:59] lie you're always short you you've
[2:25:03] always got this problem you've always
[2:25:05] got that problem you've always got this
[2:25:08] failure oh you'll never make it wait a
[2:25:11] minute it's not what he said Hallelujah
[2:25:15] we say brother M you you're you're you
[2:25:18] you get a little hot tempered sometimes
[2:25:20] that may be true but guess what he's
[2:25:23] going to bring
[2:25:25] me he's going to redeem me from that
[2:25:29] he's going to bring me from that he's
[2:25:31] got a thought that was before the
[2:25:33] foundation of the world that's what he
[2:25:35] come for is to roll the cloud back so I
[2:25:38] don't have to believe the lie that makes
[2:25:41] me mad that makes me angry that makes me
[2:25:45] fear for my finances that makes me look
[2:25:48] after my own well-being that that let
[2:25:50] Satan put burdens on me that I I'm not
[2:25:53] even capable of carrying oh praise God
[2:25:57] that he's come to deliver me from the
[2:25:59] lie he's saving me from the
[2:26:14] LIE when you received eternal life there
[2:26:18] is only one form of eternal life that's
[2:26:22] the Greek word Zoey is that right
[2:26:25] brother brother says yes Zoe God's own
[2:26:29] life so you being a son you became part
[2:26:34] of that life so the life that's in you
[2:26:39] never did
[2:26:40] begin and it never can
[2:26:45] end when did you get it
[2:26:50] did you get it the day you got
[2:26:54] down that's part of the
[2:26:58] lie you kneel down and you say oh I give
[2:27:01] my life to Christ and you wake up and
[2:27:03] you've got the same
[2:27:05] nature but it's the seed that's in you
[2:27:08] that produces the
[2:27:10] nature and God Waters it by his word we
[2:27:14] keep putting ourselves under the
[2:27:16] challenge I've got to do this I've got
[2:27:18] to overcome this way wait a minute he's
[2:27:21] my Overcomer He's My Redeemer he's the
[2:27:24] one that's going to lift me
[2:27:27] up quit looking back leave those things
[2:27:31] which are behind behind and press for
[2:27:33] the higher calling maybe you had your
[2:27:36] marriage is messed up maybe you're
[2:27:38] you've done sin in your life maybe
[2:27:40] you've went out and done things you
[2:27:42] can't undo but that don't stop God don't
[2:27:46] let the
[2:27:48] LIE continue
[2:27:52] to stop letting him bring
[2:27:56] you and redeem you and save
[2:28:01] you from the LIE oh he's a
[2:28:07] liar he says God's own life so you being
[2:28:11] a Son of God become part of that life so
[2:28:14] the life that's in you never did begin
[2:28:17] and it never could end think of it it
[2:28:19] can can't end because anything that's
[2:28:23] Eternal never began the life that's in
[2:28:28] you never did
[2:28:31] begin that is if you've got eternal life
[2:28:35] and that's God for you was in his
[2:28:39] thought from the Eternal and now it's
[2:28:44] expressed here in a human being for his
[2:28:48] glory Jesus came to redeem that being a
[2:28:54] son the fullness of God had to come and
[2:28:58] become that the the sinless character of
[2:29:02] God did that that he might redeem these
[2:29:07] other thoughts that was to come to him
[2:29:13] to make a
[2:29:16] wife what are you brother I'm the other
[2:29:19] thought amen I'm the other
[2:29:22] thoughts oh my goodness I'm a thought of
[2:29:26] God you might not believe it but I
[2:29:30] believe
[2:29:33] it you say well I don't see it well sit
[2:29:36] back and watch my redeemer will lift me
[2:29:40] up he'll transform me but I'm not going
[2:29:44] to believe the lie that says I can never
[2:29:46] get there when he said I could I'm not
[2:29:49] going to believe the lie I'm going to
[2:29:50] hell when I always had eternal
[2:29:56] life do you say oh well if you believe
[2:29:59] that you can sin and do er no if you're
[2:30:01] sinning it's unbelief it's because you
[2:30:04] don't believe that but if you did
[2:30:07] believe that and you've got a problem or
[2:30:09] you've got a habit or you've got a
[2:30:11] burden you know you've got a
[2:30:14] redeemer that'll lift you
[2:30:17] up and you can look up and say my
[2:30:20] Redeemer liveth though the skin worms
[2:30:22] eat my bones yet I'll see
[2:30:25] God it's like a
[2:30:28] slave he's he's being whipped on his
[2:30:31] back he's in
[2:30:36] slavery and he toils every day he's
[2:30:39] hardly ever
[2:30:41] fed and then one day he finds out he's
[2:30:43] the
[2:30:47] king he owns the
[2:30:50] the
[2:30:56] plantation they were lying to
[2:30:59] him saying that he was the slave when he
[2:31:02] was the
[2:31:04] [Music]
[2:31:05] owner you think he'd look down at the
[2:31:08] whoop marks and say oh I've got
[2:31:11] scars I'm must mean I'm a
[2:31:16] slave I've got all the scars from my
[2:31:21] past from all the years I was in
[2:31:24] bondage does that mean I'm a slave no
[2:31:28] I've come to
[2:31:29] realize I'm the
[2:31:31] king I'm the owner of this
[2:31:35] world I have power over every demon

[2:32:16] could deny it but he brought me here to
[2:32:19] say that I could say Amen to every word
[2:32:23] of
[2:32:24] God God saved me from the
[2:32:28] LIE save me from the lie I'm telling

[2:38:43] [Music]
[2:38:44] stand I am a
[2:38:47] child of God
[2:38:52] amen I'd like to read one more statement
[2:38:55] to
[2:38:58] you cuz I I if there's someone here
[2:39:03] that is in doubt of who you are
[2:39:08] and what your heart's desire is and you
[2:39:12] think prayer would help you then we want
[2:39:14] to pray for
[2:39:17] you he said but he that is in you is
[2:39:22] Christ and if Christ is in you the works
[2:39:26] of Christ you will do if Christ lives in
[2:39:30] you he said so St John
[2:39:34] 14:12 he that believeth in me the works
[2:39:38] that I do shall he do
[2:39:42] [Music]
[2:39:43] also he didn't say the works that I do
[2:39:50] he is doing right
[2:39:51] now it says he shall
[2:39:57] do and if Christ is in you or if Christ
[2:40:01] lives in you then Christ is the word is
[2:40:05] that right and the word Come To His
[2:40:08] prophets see and if you Christ lived in
[2:40:13] you the works of Christ would be done
[2:40:16] through you and the life of Christ would
[2:40:18] be live through you The Works he did the
[2:40:23] life he lived and everything it would
[2:40:26] live in you just like Shakespeare or
[2:40:29] Beethoven or whatever it was lived in
[2:40:32] you if his life but if you're still
[2:40:37] living your own life then your own works
[2:40:41] you'll
[2:40:42] do but if you're living the life of
[2:40:45] Christ if Christ is in you
[2:40:50] he that's in you is greater than he that
[2:40:55] is in the
[2:40:59] world if your doubts and frustrations
[2:41:03] about God's promise is in you then
[2:41:07] Christ isn't there see you're only
[2:41:11] worked up but if the Life of Christ is
[2:41:14] living in you his word will recognize
[2:41:18] and his promise us he'll do it so he'll
[2:41:21] do
[2:41:22] it it doesn't mean that you're not a
[2:41:25] Christian do you understand what he says
[2:41:28] if you're all frustrated about the
[2:41:30] promise of God if you're if if if you're
[2:41:35] if your if if if your doubts and
[2:41:39] frustrations about God's promise is in
[2:41:41] you then it isn't Christ
[2:41:45] there doesn't say you're not a
[2:41:48] Christian he said if that frustration is
[2:41:51] there and that Doubt's there then that's
[2:41:54] not
[2:41:55] Christ that's not
[2:41:59] him and if you can say that that's not
[2:42:02] him if you if you if you're worried
[2:42:04] about your healing or whether you're
[2:42:06] going to get healed or whether you're
[2:42:09] forgiven and you have all that doubt and
[2:42:11] frustration that's not
[2:42:16] him and that's when you've got to say
[2:42:18] wait a minute that's not
[2:42:20] him I'm not going to accept that he that
[2:42:24] is in me is greater than my doubt and my
[2:42:30] frustration and this morning if you're
[2:42:32] living below your
[2:42:37] privilege he says when thou prayest
[2:42:42] believe that you receive what you ask
[2:42:45] for and it shall be given you if you say
[2:42:49] to this mountain be moved and don't
[2:42:52] doubt in your heart but leave that what
[2:42:55] you say will come to pass you can have
[2:43:00] what you say the father worketh and I
[2:43:04] worketh hither too verily verily I say
[2:43:07] unto you the son can do nothing himself
[2:43:11] only what he sees the father doing and
[2:43:14] and doth the son likewise and when the
[2:43:17] father showed him what to do he walked
[2:43:20] out there without a failure of anything
[2:43:23] and said let it be and it was and the
[2:43:28] same Christ lives in
[2:43:30] you it lives in us then his Works will
[2:43:34] do because Christ is the word the
[2:43:38] promise of the word brings healing to
[2:43:41] you do you believe that it's the promise
[2:43:45] of the word that brings to Healing it's
[2:43:48] acting on the the promise is coming up
[2:43:50] and saying I've got doubt and confusion
[2:43:53] Lord I Want to Be Free I've got sickness
[2:43:57] I'm going to act on the promise it's
[2:43:59] what brings healing he said I will not
[2:44:03] leave you
[2:44:05] comfortless as I pray asked a while ago
[2:44:10] there in Matthew
[2:44:11] 24 Matthew 282 see he says I will come
[2:44:16] to you and be in you I the person of
[2:44:20] Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost
[2:44:23] will come and live in you then you won't
[2:44:27] be you won't be yourself anymore I'll be
[2:44:31] in you and greater is he that is in you
[2:44:35] than he that is in the world see Hebrews
[2:44:38] 138 he's the same yesterday today and
[2:44:44] forever if you if you have a need this
[2:44:47] morning
[2:44:50] we'd be
[2:44:52] happy to pray for
[2:44:57] you there not any power I
[2:45:00] have but it's what he
[2:45:02] said and if you need something from the
[2:45:06] Lord this morning and you'd like to

[2:45:15] lie that he's told on you and I thought
