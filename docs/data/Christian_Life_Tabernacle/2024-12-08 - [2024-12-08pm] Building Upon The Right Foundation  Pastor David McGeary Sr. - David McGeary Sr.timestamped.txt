[23:46] [Music]
[24:16] God bless you Church uh before I sing I
[24:19] have a testimony that I was going to
[24:22] give this morning but I decided to wait
[24:25] it out and then when uh brother Matthew
[24:28] was pring preaching he kind of touched
[24:29] on that subject so I was just like well
[24:32] let me just give it um so this testimony
[24:36] is not
[24:38] just mine but it's my sister's it's my
[24:41] family's testimony sort of to say um so
[24:45] um one of my young sisters was applying
[24:48] to come out to study for school and um
[24:51] so she went for her interviews uh for
[24:54] the viser she went the first time she
[24:57] was denied uh was not given any good
[24:59] reason to why she was denied she was
[25:01] just told she doesn't meet the
[25:02] requirements and so she kind of It kind
[25:06] of it was stressful for her sort of to
[25:09] say so she went back home um we decided
[25:13] to try again she went again the second
[25:15] time but um I think God had worked on
[25:19] her the second time she went cuz she
[25:21] went there they denied her again um
[25:24] didn't give her any reason was basically
[25:26] like okay the first one refused you so
[25:28] the second one I'm going to say no as
[25:30] well um so she went back home and she
[25:32] said well God your plan is bigger than
[25:35] mine and um if this is not the route you
[25:39] want me to take I'll still praise you
[25:42] and so as she was seated home um not too
[25:45] long after she received a phone call and
[25:48] um so she thought I don't know this
[25:51] number so I'm not going to pick it up uh
[25:54] but she had something upon her heart
[25:55] that was like just pick up the phone
[25:57] just pick up the phone so she picks up
[25:58] the phone and um so they asked her is
[26:02] this Miriam uh she was like yes this is
[26:04] she and they were like this is the US
[26:06] Embassy and are you available to come by
[26:09] tomorrow she was like okay I I am so she
[26:12] goes by the next day and uh not knowing
[26:16] what to take or anything she just took
[26:17] everything she had taken to her
[26:19] interviews and this day when she went
[26:21] this was a day of like collections it
[26:23] was not a day for interviews so she was
[26:25] not scheduled for an interview and this
[26:27] does not happen back home so for you to
[26:30] get interviewed you need to schedule
[26:32] that means you need to pay for it she
[26:34] didn't pay for anything she was called
[26:36] by the US Embassy and they don't do that
[26:38] and so she went there um she joined the
[26:41] line she was like yes I'm Miram I was
[26:43] called yesterday they were she was
[26:44] thought well just join the line and the
[26:47] lady who interviewed her on this day was
[26:51] there the next day when she was called
[26:53] so she was like oh I wonder what's
[26:55] happening so people were collecting
[26:57] their um um visas and stuff like that
[27:01] and um I don't know why but the lady in
[27:04] front of her did not collect hers and so
[27:06] here Miriam doesn't know what to think
[27:08] but she goes up she's asked a few
[27:10] questions so she was telling me she said
[27:13] she looked at the lady the lady looked
[27:15] at um the rejected pal and she looked
[27:18] over on the other side she looked at
[27:20] Miriam and she just told her well come
[27:22] back and collect your Visa so I'm just
[27:25] grateful if God saw her here God Prov it
[27:28] away and I'm just going to sing a short

[32:46] back to Texas we will find out that yes
[32:49] that is true so we we were able to
[32:52] experience that and I thank God for
[32:54] brother jman he was planning of going to
[32:57] noa's Arc and he thought of our family
[33:00] he extended the invite and we said yes
[33:03] and uh we were able to also go to
[33:05] brother brenham's
[33:06] Tabernacle and uh vgr so that is
[33:10] something that I want to share share
[33:13] something with you um sister has sung
[33:16] such a beautiful song count your
[33:18] blessings and our text testimony is a
[33:21] combination of uh of our um blessings
[33:26] and when we testify to the church and uh
[33:31] I was saying no all the way and then
[33:34] brother jman says no brother you're
[33:36] coming I said okay that settles it
[33:40] so something has happened and that's
[33:43] something I wanted to share with
[33:46] you brother David uh meui I was able to
[33:51] like from the heart I want um I was able
[33:54] to recognize what he does when he plays
[33:57] the cape and uh and the and the respect
[34:02] he has for the word of
[34:05] God there was a time when noa's was NOA
[34:09] was building an ark lot of work was
[34:12] being done at that
[34:13] time and uh there was a time the ark was
[34:19] done midone and there was the time when
[34:23] Ark was completed in Noah's
[34:26] time and Bible says says as it was in
[34:28] the days of NOA so shall be in the day
[34:31] of the son of
[34:33] man and when we went to see Noah's Ark
[34:35] in Kentucky it was like four story
[34:38] high least I know that just by simply
[34:42] taking the trip God was constantly
[34:46] talking to
[34:48] me if the Bible says it will happen like
[34:51] it was the day in NOA I truly believe it
[34:54] will
[34:55] happen when we went to grr this was not
[34:58] Brothers jman's um uh I believe there
[35:01] was his fourth visit to vgr and brother
[35:05] jman testified that brother when we came
[35:10] that
[35:11] vgr it was like a 18 wheer trucks used
[35:15] to be there and there was a there was a
[35:18] material that's been shipped out to the
[35:22] World Church here in United States and
[35:25] brother brisal in Canada so they were
[35:28] doing lot of lot work throughout the
[35:32] globe and we went I testify and I am
[35:35] testifying in front of you if you go to
[35:38] vgr the roads are like there's nothing
[35:42] going on
[35:44] there what I want to tell you is noar
[35:49] Ark is done the time is the door is
[35:53] about to

[36:02] God has opened our eyes and our ears we
[36:06] can see recognize the message we can
[36:10] hear the

[47:08] the grace and
[47:09] mercy that you showed us in this
[47:12] generation sending us a Messengers
[47:16] to bring us
[47:19] back to that
[47:22] Foundation Lord we ask this evening that
[47:25] you would bless our
[47:28] service in our effort to evening and
[47:33] that the heart of the believer will be
[47:35] touched and father that they'd ever be
[47:41] fortified in the trust that we can place
[47:44] in you that you'll take care of
[47:48] us and that you will not leave us nor
[47:51] forsake us father we ask you to forgive
[47:54] us our sins and our doubt and help us
[47:58] grow more in your presence that we can
[48:01] be used father For Your Glory we ask
[48:05] these things in Jesus precious name we
[48:08] pray
[48:09] amen amen God bless you if you open your
[48:12] Bibles and turn with me uh to
[48:18] Ezekiel and I I I just uh am going to um
[48:24] I can't certainly can't add to any that
[48:27] was said this morning I did uh uh enjoy
[48:31] it and received
[48:34] inspiration uh from it and uh we just
[48:37] like to point out some of the things
[48:39] that stood up out to me and uh and Trust
[48:43] it' be a a blessing to you you love the
[48:47] Lord amen he's he's good to us and uh
[48:52] he's going to stick with us that's the
[48:55] one thing you know
[48:57] I've certainly done a lot of things in
[48:59] my life that I thought would scare him
[49:02] away and uh and sure enough he's comes
[49:06] back every time you know and he finds me
[49:10] and and when I try to hide uh it's no
[49:14] need trying to play hide and seek with
[49:16] the Lord because he knows where you're
[49:19] at and you know when uh it just he just
[49:24] that way and I I appreciate that about
[49:27] him so if you read let's start with U
[49:33] uh
[49:35] um the 10th verse and we're going to try
[49:38] to derive a little something from this
[49:42] and then we'll uh read another scripture
[49:45] found in numbers of of 14 and four but
[49:49] we'll read that later on he says let us
[49:53] read what he says
[49:55] here because even because they have
[49:59] seduced my people saying peace and there
[50:04] is no was no peace and one built upon a
[50:09] wall and loow others dabbed it with
[50:14] untempered
[50:15] mortar saying unto them which dab it
[50:20] with untempered mortar that it
[50:23] shall that it shall fall
[50:27] there shall be an overflowing shower and
[50:32] ye oh great hailstones shall fall and
[50:36] the stormy wind shall rent it and lo
[50:40] when the wall is Fallen shall it not be
[50:43] said unto you where is the dab dabbing
[50:49] wherewith ye dabbed it therefore thus
[50:52] saith the Lord God I will rent
[50:57] it with stormy winds in my Fury and
[51:01] there shall be an overflowing shower in
[51:05] my anger and great hailstones in my Fury
[51:09] to consume it so will I break it down
[51:13] the wall that ye have dabbed with
[51:16] untempered mortar and bring it down to
[51:20] the ground so that the foundation
[51:23] thereof shall be discovered and it shall
[51:27] fall and ye shall be consumed in the
[51:31] midst thereof and ye shall know that I
[51:35] am the Lord God I am the Lord heavenly
[51:40] father bless your word in your precious
[51:42] name we pray amen amen you may be seated
[51:57] you know something that um stood out to
[52:00] me and um and I'm I'm uh just when I
[52:06] read the scriptures and I listen to our
[52:09] messenger
[52:10] preach one of the things that I always
[52:13] search for is principles by which God
[52:18] does things there are certain principles
[52:21] that God has that and and all his
[52:25] principles and all all the decisions he
[52:27] makes are all for his children uh
[52:31] because he's a loving father and that's
[52:34] why he created us in the first place
[52:37] that he could reveal himself and have
[52:39] fellowship and he can do these things so
[52:43] he abides by certain principles of
[52:45] course one of the principles that he
[52:47] abides by is that he's not a respector
[52:50] of persons so his Mercy is extended to
[52:56] who never will accept his Mercy his
[52:59] forgiveness is given to anyone who will
[53:02] repent there he doesn't he doesn't turn
[53:06] his heart against any man because of his
[53:10] upbringing because of the color of his
[53:13] skin because of his education there
[53:16] there's nothing that he holds uh back if
[53:20] a man will meet him on the the provided
[53:24] terms he'll meet that man on those terms
[53:27] every time he he doesn't consider one
[53:31] person above another uh uh he is fair
[53:35] and just to all uh he doesn't he doesn't
[53:40] hold a a grudge you know if he forgives
[53:44] you you're forgiven you you don't have
[53:47] to worry about you're going to get
[53:49] punished for it down the road and and oh
[53:52] you know if you've done something and
[53:54] you've made it right it it's right you
[53:57] don't have to worry about the
[53:59] consequences of that you don't have to
[54:01] sit back and and and worry if there's
[54:04] judgment coming down the road if you
[54:07] accept a pardon it's a pardon you know
[54:10] if the if the prison do has been opened
[54:14] and and you're set free you you don't
[54:17] have to worry that that crime is going
[54:20] to come back and imprison you again
[54:23] that's a
[54:24] principle that uh in life if you begin
[54:28] to understand these principles God's
[54:30] placed them there all for a reason the
[54:33] biggest trouble we of course have is we
[54:35] have an adversary we have a devil he's a
[54:38] liar and he perverts the word of God and
[54:41] he he comes as an angel of Light and and
[54:45] you know all that he's all in your best
[54:48] interest but uh the truth of the matter
[54:51] is when you anchor yourself in the
[54:53] principles of God it's it's good another
[54:57] principle that we know and understand is
[54:59] that God doesn't change his mind if if
[55:02] he he does something one time you can
[55:05] count on it every single time he doesn't
[55:09] he doesn't progress in the way that we
[55:12] would think of progressing uh he doesn't
[55:16] uh say try something and say oh it
[55:19] didn't work I'll I'll try something a
[55:21] little better no he knows exactly what
[55:24] he's doing you can you can actually sit
[55:27] back and and rest on that if he's ever
[55:31] done one thing one way you can just hold
[55:33] on to that that that he'll stay that way
[55:37] the whole time and so we we find out
[55:41] that there's principles that are laid
[55:45] out uh through the word of God and and
[55:48] kind of when I was listening to brother
[55:52] Matthew this morning as he was
[55:54] evangelizing the Gospel to and reaching
[55:57] out and and touching souls and and a lot
[56:03] of people who have have kind of gone
[56:05] astray or went back in the world a
[56:08] little bit it seemed like the Lord was
[56:10] reaching out to them and setting their
[56:12] hearts on fire again to try to come back
[56:15] to God that's what we want we don't want
[56:17] to leave one person behind we don't want
[56:20] to judge somebody and point fingers at
[56:23] somebody we want to hold them up in
[56:25] prayer uh you know because so that our
[56:28] our goal is to leave here and to have
[56:32] every person that it is here waiting for
[56:36] his great coming to be in the best
[56:39] possible condition that they can be in
[56:42] for that day and as was Reas reading
[56:45] this I I I I thought of this principle
[56:48] that kind of stood out to me in the
[56:50] scriptures if you would bear with me in
[56:53] my
[56:54] Folly this evening and
[56:57] and uh and it was what the Lord said
[57:00] here when he began to preach this he
[57:03] said uh uh if I can find it here he said
[57:08] so so will I break down the wall that ye
[57:12] have dabbed with untempered
[57:15] mortar and I don't want to go into all
[57:17] what untempered mortar is I think you're
[57:19] spiritual enough to understand that's
[57:22] things that you put in the building that
[57:24] don't belong there that won't hold up
[57:28] but he says here he says and bring it
[57:30] down to the ground so that the
[57:33] foundation thereof shall be
[57:37] discovered and and I I I realized that
[57:41] that through the preaching of the word
[57:42] of God that a lot of Christians and a
[57:48] lot of people they they've never built
[57:51] on the right foundation so in your life
[57:55] if if if you're you're trying to build a
[57:58] life for the Lord and let's put
[58:01] everything on a positive Viewpoint
[58:03] you're trying to do your best you're
[58:05] trying to build your your life for the
[58:09] Lord you you're you're wanting to live
[58:11] right you're wanting to do right but the
[58:14] Lord understands something he says that
[58:16] if you don't build it on the right
[58:18] foundation when the storm comes and the
[58:21] wind comes it'll blow away and that's
[58:24] why in the gospel he preached about the
[58:27] man that builds his foundation on Sand
[58:30] he said when the storm comes it won't it
[58:33] won't stand but you got to build it on
[58:36] on that Solid Rock and what happens to
[58:39] us a lot of Christians we we we we put
[58:43] untempered mortar in our our walls and
[58:47] we we have things placed within our life
[58:49] and we never were really securely
[58:52] founded in the right thing and and so as
[58:57] as we begin to to go through our lives
[59:01] and and and we go go through our
[59:04] experience as a Christian we we come to
[59:08] to places that we think well I've been a
[59:10] Christian for so long time really is not
[59:14] one of God's
[59:16] principles he really you know he doesn't
[59:20] it it doesn't matter to him he doesn't
[59:23] care how long it takes for him to get to
[59:26] his end because he he's Eternal he has
[59:31] all time he has everything that he ever
[59:33] needs to do what he wants to do with so
[59:36] he can work on you for a long long time
[59:39] he can leave you go for a long long time
[59:42] he can do whatever he wants to do but
[59:44] when he decides to move he
[59:46] moves and so a lot of times in our
[59:48] Christian lives we go for a long long
[59:50] time as a Christian and then we find out
[59:53] that that if if what we have and what we
[59:58] built on won't meet the challenge of the
[1:00:02] age God in his Mercy will tear that down
[1:00:06] that the foundation thereof will be
[1:00:10] exposed and known and that's I think
[1:00:13] God's trying to get to his church he's
[1:00:16] trying to get his children back to the
[1:00:19] foundation back to to Really what it is
[1:00:22] that they should be built on because you
[1:00:25] come through life and you hear the
[1:00:27] gospel and you you know you're a sinner
[1:00:29] and you know there's a hell and you know
[1:00:32] there's things that that you you don't
[1:00:34] want to uh go to the bad place and
[1:00:38] everything so you you you start building
[1:00:41] a Christian
[1:00:43] Life you start building your own walls
[1:00:47] you start building your own way of
[1:00:50] believing you start building your own
[1:00:52] experience you you build your your
[1:00:56] fellowships you build all these things
[1:00:58] but if it's not built on really what the
[1:01:01] church is supposed to be built
[1:01:04] on it God is going to tear it down it
[1:01:08] doesn't mean he's against you in the
[1:01:11] church age the prophet of God said God
[1:01:13] says sometimes God takes a vessel and he
[1:01:17] completely breaks it down that he can
[1:01:20] remold it again that he can fashion it
[1:01:23] again for his own pleasure he said this
[1:01:27] is the love of God and another love of
[1:01:30] God there is not and so
[1:01:35] part of the love of God we know is
[1:01:39] chastisement that's part of the love of
[1:01:41] God he chastises his children it doesn't
[1:01:45] mean to punish correction isn't
[1:01:47] punishment it means to alter its way he
[1:01:51] he he if we could understand this great
[1:01:54] principle
[1:01:55] that stood out to me this morning was
[1:01:58] that God's going to tear something down
[1:02:01] that's not
[1:02:03] Eternal if you're Eternal beings and
[1:02:06] eternal children he's not going to allow
[1:02:10] things in you that aren't connected to
[1:02:14] Eternity in fact he's it's like he's
[1:02:17] going to purge the UN Eternal away from
[1:02:21] you so if you have a religious
[1:02:24] Foundation if you are building building
[1:02:26] your own building if you are pursuing
[1:02:29] your own Walk of Life God's not against
[1:02:32] you he's for
[1:02:34] you and and he's got a plan for your
[1:02:37] life he's got something that he wanted
[1:02:39] you to Anchor in a foundation that he
[1:02:44] wanted you to build on and if you've
[1:02:46] built on that maybe you've built
[1:02:48] yourself on an
[1:02:50] experience you know you you had a a
[1:02:54] shutter or you you you had a a a a flash
[1:03:00] of light you know I kind of grew up with
[1:03:04] hippies you know and every time you
[1:03:05] turned around somebody had a a god
[1:03:08] experience you know they they they saw a
[1:03:10] flashing light or you know they they
[1:03:14] they they were caught up in the clouds
[1:03:16] and and you know and he they they'd have
[1:03:20] these things that they thought were uh
[1:03:23] uh you know I meant God you know what I
[1:03:24] mean can the truth of the matter is she
[1:03:26] took too many
[1:03:29] drugs you know it wasn't a real genuine
[1:03:33] thing at all you couldn't build on that
[1:03:36] and that's what man
[1:03:38] did had this whole thing of Ezekiel he
[1:03:41] talks about prophets prophesying to the
[1:03:43] people telling them things that weren't
[1:03:45] true telling them gospels teaching them
[1:03:48] things that weren't true preaching all
[1:03:50] kinds of of of man's approach to this
[1:03:54] and man's approach to that and none of
[1:03:57] it was ever hold
[1:03:59] you and so if you have those things in
[1:04:02] your life you've came along in your life
[1:04:05] and you've heard people tell you things
[1:04:07] and you you dabbed your wall with
[1:04:11] teachings that weren't right you dabbed
[1:04:13] your wall with approaches that weren't
[1:04:17] his approaches you you martyred your
[1:04:19] wall with things that were never proven
[1:04:22] by the word of God maybe you had
[1:04:24] confidence in the man that told you it
[1:04:26] but what he told you it it had a portion
[1:04:29] of
[1:04:30] Truth can you you join that to your
[1:04:35] building and maybe you've lived by that
[1:04:38] and you've thought that way for a long
[1:04:40] time the grace of God not the punishment
[1:04:44] of God but the grace of God is going to
[1:04:47] test that mortar and tear it down he's
[1:04:51] going to tear those things out of your
[1:04:53] life he's going to tear those ideas out
[1:04:56] of your life those fears out of your
[1:04:58] life all those teachings that we have in
[1:05:01] our life that aren't really based on the
[1:05:04] real Foundation of what Christianity is
[1:05:07] based
[1:05:08] on and we've heard it over and over
[1:05:11] again you must be born again well that's
[1:05:14] been taught for so long by the church
[1:05:17] it's like an experience outside of
[1:05:21] Salvation like you get saved and then
[1:05:24] you're born again
[1:05:26] that foundation's not
[1:05:28] right that won't
[1:05:33] stand you know the whole understanding
[1:05:37] of being born again is that you've been
[1:05:41] birthed by
[1:05:43] him you meant him
[1:05:48] personally it doesn't matter if you're
[1:05:50] prayed for if you're prayed for that's
[1:05:54] wonderful the all they can do is pray
[1:05:57] that you'll have a meeting pray that
[1:05:59] you'll come face to face you know like
[1:06:02] he the prophet of God said many times he
[1:06:04] told Philip and Nathaniel he said come
[1:06:06] see come see for yourself meet it for
[1:06:11] yourself and and it can't be built on
[1:06:15] something
[1:06:16] secondhand and so we're coming to a real
[1:06:20] amazing time in the time of the
[1:06:24] church and and if you understand the
[1:06:26] growth of the church and you understand
[1:06:29] the principle of God and all this we
[1:06:31] could type it if you know this is
[1:06:33] Jerusalem and and we could go through
[1:06:36] all the types of new but that's not what
[1:06:38] we're here the the principle of
[1:06:41] understanding that if there's something
[1:06:45] there not
[1:06:48] sin you understand I'm not talking about
[1:06:51] Sin I'm not talking about drunkenness or
[1:06:54] all this anything of that nature I mean
[1:06:58] the way that you're
[1:07:00] approaching the father how that you look
[1:07:03] at them how that you understand the word
[1:07:07] how the suspicions you might have the
[1:07:11] guilts that you might have the the fears
[1:07:15] that you might have all those things God
[1:07:18] is fixing to
[1:07:23] address he's going to tear them out your
[1:07:27] building he's going to tear anything
[1:07:30] that not
[1:07:32] built on the right
[1:07:34] foundation he's going to take it
[1:07:38] out oh that's a good
[1:07:42] thing right because you want something
[1:07:44] that
[1:07:46] endures that stands the
[1:07:49] test you you can't you know uh when you
[1:07:54] know
[1:07:56] it's just like so many people they they
[1:07:59] they had the idea you know that you know
[1:08:03] Christianity in
[1:08:05] America were hand in hand with the Bible
[1:08:09] on the table and the flag upon the wall
[1:08:13] neighbor that's the answer to it
[1:08:16] all you
[1:08:18] know that's you know that's salvation
[1:08:21] for every nation with the Bible on the
[1:08:24] table and the flag upon the wall that's
[1:08:27] how people thought be a good citizen go
[1:08:30] to church read your Bible and they built
[1:08:33] on that but that's not what the
[1:08:35] foundation
[1:08:37] was the foundation of the church is the
[1:08:40] revelation of Jesus Christ that that not
[1:08:44] the knowledge of them but the personal
[1:08:48] meeting of the believer in Jesus
[1:08:51] personally I me him I know him I know
[1:08:55] know what he did for
[1:08:58] me and that never leaves
[1:09:03] you that change never leaves
[1:09:07] you you might go through all kinds of
[1:09:10] Trials you might go through all kinds of
[1:09:12] mistakes but whenever you get down
[1:09:14] before God he'll never fail to bring you
[1:09:18] back to
[1:09:22] Calvary and and and that's when you talk
[1:09:26] about being born again we talk about a
[1:09:29] nature change but you know what he's
[1:09:32] taking you
[1:09:35] from it does you don't need if he paid
[1:09:39] it and he made the change in you you
[1:09:44] don't need any more than that except
[1:09:47] subjecting yourself to the leadership of
[1:09:50] the word of
[1:09:53] God but when we we begin to understand
[1:09:57] that in order to have a bride without
[1:10:00] spot or wrinkle he's got to start
[1:10:05] purging all these thinkings all these
[1:10:09] ideas all these
[1:10:11] misconceptions and I have to admit that
[1:10:14] 90% of the problem with all these
[1:10:17] misconceptions is
[1:10:22] preachers they they they come up with
[1:10:24] ideas
[1:10:27] they come up with ways of
[1:10:30] living they come up with rules that'll
[1:10:33] replace law with
[1:10:36] Grace we could make a law I could have
[1:10:39] the Deacon stand at the back door and
[1:10:41] say and look at every heel and have a
[1:10:45] little ruler there and we could make a
[1:10:47] rule inch and a half anything above inch
[1:10:50] and a half is a high
[1:10:53] heel I mean you can have a
[1:10:57] law right so everybody lines up with the
[1:10:59] law but they've never been in the closet
[1:11:02] in prayer they've never got to the place
[1:11:06] they've never had the experience of the
[1:11:09] Lord Jesus bringing to their own
[1:11:13] personal experience that that heals too
[1:11:18] long it it makes your body twist or you
[1:11:22] think it makes you look taller well if
[1:11:24] you're not tall thank God God made you
[1:11:27] that
[1:11:31] way doesn't matter if you're tall or
[1:11:34] wide or Nothing what matters is that
[1:11:37] don't matter what ground that seed is in
[1:11:40] is the seed that's important everybody
[1:11:43] spends so much time on the soil that the
[1:11:47] the poor plant's not
[1:11:50] growing and so he's going to deal with
[1:11:54] that he's got to get that out of your
[1:11:56] mind he's got to get that thought
[1:11:59] process away from you he's got to get
[1:12:01] your approach right he's got to get your
[1:12:04] attitude right so how's he going to do
[1:12:06] that well first of thing he's got to
[1:12:08] purge out he's got to tear down all the
[1:12:10] walls he's got to get rid of all the
[1:12:13] tempered mortar till he gets it down to
[1:12:16] find out what's the foundation of
[1:12:21] it and the foundation of it always been
[1:12:27] man have not revealed this to you but my
[1:12:30] Father which is in heaven you say well
[1:12:33] that's a
[1:12:35] general scope of all things no it's the
[1:12:41] principle by which God deals with you on
[1:12:46] every single item in your
[1:12:52] life from your job
[1:12:55] to the car you drive to the food you eat
[1:12:59] you say oh God's not concerned about
[1:13:01] that God's concerned about everything
[1:13:04] that concerns your
[1:13:09] soul the
[1:13:11] principle is that the bride does nothing
[1:13:16] amen till she's heard from the Lord
[1:13:19] yes it's so
[1:13:22] individual and it's so real
[1:13:26] and it's so
[1:13:30] true that we've almost got to the place
[1:13:34] where we don't expect it anymore we're
[1:13:37] not in
[1:13:38] expectation of a a man or a woman coming
[1:13:43] face to face with the Lord and the Lord
[1:13:46] speaking to them and them rising up with
[1:13:49] the power and the glory of the
[1:13:50] Resurrection in their life set free and
[1:13:53] born again
[1:13:58] that God birthed it in
[1:13:59] US Satan's trying to replace everything
[1:14:02] with Doctrine with
[1:14:05] religion with with uh all kinds of ideas
[1:14:10] and things but you've got to
[1:14:14] know that you've meant him and you've
[1:14:18] got to know that he wants to meet you
[1:14:25] and and it it's
[1:14:28] hard when the ministry becomes the
[1:14:37] confessional a lot of times that's all
[1:14:39] that prayer lines
[1:14:42] are Brother David I've been out in the
[1:14:45] world I've sinned I've I've done all
[1:14:48] that I need to get back to God tell him
[1:14:55] let him
[1:14:57] know and I pray oh God this person wants
[1:15:00] to come back to
[1:15:03] you I can't make the I'm not the
[1:15:05] birthgiver
[1:15:09] the only form that I can impart eternal
[1:15:15] life is is in the form of the
[1:15:21] word Now understand that so if we've got
[1:15:26] conceptions and ideas that have been
[1:15:28] planted we've our lives are dabbed up
[1:15:32] with everything there there comes a a
[1:15:35] time where he says I'm going to take
[1:15:38] this
[1:15:39] church and bring it back to its
[1:15:44] foundation and really when you look at
[1:15:46] our messenger what did he start to do he
[1:15:48] started to shake the walls down of
[1:15:51] denomination he shook the walls down of
[1:15:53] their teaching began to break all the
[1:15:56] dab and all the m and finally he came to
[1:15:58] the place he said there's only one place
[1:16:01] that God meets a man and that's under
[1:16:04] the shed blood of Jesus Christ it's
[1:16:06] God's provided place of
[1:16:12] worship and the church is trying to re
[1:16:14] to worship under
[1:16:18] anointing they're trying to worship
[1:16:20] under
[1:16:21] music you know what you worship God for
[1:16:24] what he did for you for
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:28] you Lord I know what you did for
[1:16:33] me every bit of my life goes back to
[1:16:37] that time on that roof when I read those
[1:16:40] scriptures and he lifted the burden that
[1:16:43] I was
[1:16:44] under and I come face to face with
[1:16:50] them it's like
[1:16:53] Egypt like Israel
[1:16:55] if you let's just turn and read that for
[1:16:58] a
[1:16:59] moment in
[1:17:01] numbers
[1:17:03] 14 and
[1:17:17] four this is
[1:17:20] a just read along with the a few moments
[1:17:23] starting in the first
[1:17:25] verse and all the congregation lifted up
[1:17:29] their voice and
[1:17:31] cried and the people wept that night and
[1:17:36] all the children of Israel murmured
[1:17:38] against Moses and against Aaron and the
[1:17:43] whole
[1:17:44] congregation saying unto them would God
[1:17:49] that we had died in the land of Egypt or
[1:17:53] would God had died died in this this
[1:17:57] Wilderness and therefore hath the Lord
[1:18:01] brought us into this land to Fall by the
[1:18:05] sword that our wives and our children
[1:18:09] would be bet would be pray were it not
[1:18:13] better for us to return unto
[1:18:18] Egypt and they said one to another let
[1:18:21] us make a captain and let us return un
[1:18:25] Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their
[1:18:28] face before all the Assembly of the
[1:18:30] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:18:33] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[1:18:36] son of Zephaniah which were of them that
[1:18:43] searched the land rent their
[1:18:46] clothes and they spake unto the company
[1:18:50] of the children of Israel saying the
[1:18:52] land which we passed through to search
[1:18:55] it was exceedingly good
[1:18:58] land if the Lord delighteth in us then
[1:19:02] he will bring us into this land and give
[1:19:06] it us a land with floweth with milk and
[1:19:11] honey
[1:19:13] now the reason that they got into the
[1:19:18] condition that they wanted to return
[1:19:21] back to Egypt was they never left Egypt
[1:19:26] on the right
[1:19:29] foundation they only left to get rid of
[1:19:32] the bondage they only let left to get
[1:19:37] rid of their
[1:19:39] taskmasters but they never left with a
[1:19:42] promise in their
[1:19:44] heart now Joshua and Caleb
[1:19:48] did that's why that was the response
[1:19:51] it's a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:19:54] it's a land land that was promised to us
[1:19:56] it's a land of blessing it's a land of
[1:20:00] prosperity it's a land and it's our land
[1:20:04] if God be with me he will surely give it
[1:20:08] to me if I find if I he Delights in
[1:20:13] us now if you've met him
[1:20:16] personally and he's forgiven you your
[1:20:19] sins you know he did that because he
[1:20:22] Delights in you he loves you
[1:20:25] the question of his love never comes
[1:20:27] into the picture ever
[1:20:32] again if you're in a trial it's for your
[1:20:35] good all things work together for good
[1:20:39] he said I shall not leave you I shall
[1:20:41] not forsake you I'll be with you even in
[1:20:44] you to the end when you know
[1:20:49] that there's no
[1:20:52] questions because you have a
[1:20:56] promise what was your promise I've
[1:20:59] passed from Death unto life the gift of
[1:21:03] God is eternal life the wages of sin is
[1:21:09] death you're on the right
[1:21:11] foundation it isn't a religious Escape I
[1:21:15] thought that was brought out beautiful
[1:21:18] it wasn't just getting rid of your
[1:21:21] Taskmaster it wasn't just getting rid of
[1:21:23] and that's what happened to people they
[1:21:26] realize they're wrong they realize
[1:21:28] they're on the right wrong road they
[1:21:30] don't like what they are they don't like
[1:21:33] who they are so they start
[1:21:39] building on their own
[1:21:42] thing and their building is
[1:21:49] beautiful and it's they're putting a
[1:21:51] real
[1:21:52] effort into living right
[1:21:56] and then when God because he has a
[1:22:01] principle that he can't let you
[1:22:05] build a life or a building on a false
[1:22:12] Foundation he swings by in your
[1:22:15] life and he starts taking it
[1:22:19] apart and he's going to drive you back
[1:22:25] to the right
[1:22:28] foundation where he brings you back and
[1:22:32] to where you finally are willing to lay
[1:22:34] down and say
[1:22:36] Lord I've really tried to serve
[1:22:41] you but there's a bunch of stuff in here
[1:22:44] that's not
[1:22:46] you and you go back and you
[1:22:50] reestablish and are built again I'd like
[1:22:53] to read you this a
[1:22:57] statement this struck
[1:23:02] me he's talking about Mexico
[1:23:05] City listen this is just simple we're
[1:23:08] going to close very quickly he said
[1:23:11] Mexico
[1:23:12] City where we had a great meeting where
[1:23:16] the little baby was brought back to
[1:23:19] life and there in that great place where
[1:23:24] we were having the meetings one of the
[1:23:27] brothers taken me the next day out to
[1:23:31] look over this to look the city over
[1:23:35] which Mexico City is a beautiful place
[1:23:39] but what did I find when I got out there
[1:23:44] looking down over the city some of the
[1:23:48] most modern
[1:23:50] architecture I'd ever
[1:23:52] seen oh they went
[1:23:56] oh they went all together out and what
[1:24:00] was it they never dug down to find the
[1:24:04] right
[1:24:07] foundation the great percent of Mexico
[1:24:11] City is either pitched forward the
[1:24:14] buildings are backwards or sideways they
[1:24:19] never went to the
[1:24:21] Rock no matter how pretty the building
[1:24:24] looked it wasn't built on the solid
[1:24:30] rock now think of that they built Mexico
[1:24:34] City on a
[1:24:37] lake now why would you go
[1:24:41] back and buil another
[1:24:45] building on the same condition or the
[1:24:49] same
[1:24:52] Foundation it it wouldn't
[1:24:54] work and that's what happened to the
[1:24:57] children of Israel instead of leaving
[1:24:59] there with their life based on a promise
[1:25:03] there's a land for us we're not not
[1:25:05] leaving this land to escape we're
[1:25:08] leaving this land to go to a promise
[1:25:10] land we have a land of promise we have
[1:25:13] what God Said would be there for us
[1:25:16] every believer that meets the Lord Jesus
[1:25:19] Christ every promise in the book is mine
[1:25:22] every chapter every reverse every line
[1:25:26] it's all mine it all comes with them
[1:25:29] it's all part of my inheritance not some
[1:25:33] of it all of
[1:25:35] it hallu but if you're experience in
[1:25:39] your foundation isn't right you start
[1:25:42] picking which promises fit your
[1:25:47] building I can believe this but I can't
[1:25:50] believe
[1:25:52] that you know our our hearts condemn us
[1:25:55] and we don't even know
[1:25:58] why we don't understand the reason I'm
[1:26:02] not having
[1:26:04] peace the reason I I can't find
[1:26:08] joy is it because you're not born again
[1:26:12] or saved but you started building things
[1:26:16] in your life not based on the foundation
[1:26:19] not all the way back to the Rock
[1:26:24] if you could take everything we did in
[1:26:26] our life and bring it back to that first
[1:26:29] day
[1:26:31] experience and see how it flows and how
[1:26:34] it lines up and how it
[1:26:38] fits so now we're finding a lot of the
[1:26:42] church because the prophet of God says
[1:26:44] if it can be shaken it will be
[1:26:50] shaken if it can be torn down it will be
[1:26:53] torn down and should be be tore
[1:26:57] down but he'll rebuild again I'll
[1:27:00] restoreth sayith the Lord if he Shake
[1:27:03] something out of your life it's not I'm
[1:27:05] not talking even about Sin today you
[1:27:08] understand that I'm not talking about
[1:27:10] doing wrong I'm talking about religious
[1:27:12] ideas
[1:27:15] attitudes the way you judge things the
[1:27:19] way you look at things it it's just not
[1:27:21] the pure love of God flowing do your
[1:27:26] heart it's footsteps that aren't ordered
[1:27:30] by the
[1:27:33] Lord he he just wants to come back and
[1:27:35] he says I love you so much there's not
[1:27:38] going to be one thing in your suitcase
[1:27:41] that you can't take over to the other
[1:27:48] side be it done unto me according to thy
[1:27:52] will
[1:27:57] we say it take everything out of me but
[1:28:01] in our mind we're always thinking of
[1:28:04] sin and of the
[1:28:07] flesh the flesh is a
[1:28:11] battle it will
[1:28:13] rage till the day you're
[1:28:18] changed but if you me him face to face
[1:28:21] you know that he'll provide the gra and
[1:28:24] the mercy to overcome the flesh you
[1:28:27] don't have to be a fear of it you just
[1:28:29] have to fight
[1:28:32] it Life's a constant Warfare the flesh
[1:28:36] Wars against the spirit and the spirit
[1:28:38] against the Flesh and these two are
[1:28:41] contrary to one another and the carnal
[1:28:43] mind is imity with God and the spiritual
[1:28:46] mind is life and
[1:28:50] freedom and we come to a place
[1:28:54] we come to a
[1:28:56] realization that you can't live your
[1:28:59] life being afraid of
[1:29:04] death no matter how it comes it's our
[1:29:08] way out of
[1:29:09] here this thing is cursed to
[1:29:14] die I would love if the lord gave me
[1:29:17] another 10 years that'd be
[1:29:20] wonderful but that means that I would
[1:29:22] have I I would have pass by fourth core
[1:29:25] and how many years that he
[1:29:28] gives it doesn't matter if I know I'm in
[1:29:32] the palm of his hand I know that nothing
[1:29:35] can pluck it out of there Paul finally
[1:29:37] said oh death where's your Victory oh
[1:29:40] grave where's your sting I have fought a
[1:29:42] good fight I've ran a good race I'm
[1:29:45] looking forward to the crown that's been
[1:29:48] stored up for
[1:29:52] me see Israel got their eyes off the
[1:29:58] promise what did he save you from he
[1:30:01] didn't save you from your sins he saved
[1:30:05] you from the
[1:30:08] world politics education
[1:30:13] science the whole mental
[1:30:16] structure the whole social
[1:30:20] structure he saved you from it all it's
[1:30:24] all
[1:30:26] death and what did he give
[1:30:28] you
[1:30:30] eternal life you've never come face to
[1:30:34] face with the Lord Jesus and not Reed
[1:30:37] the promise of eternal
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:42] life and when he put the blood on the
[1:30:46] doorpost in Egypt it was for them to go
[1:30:50] free not to go free but to go to a land
[1:30:55] that was promised
[1:30:58] them and they brought all kinds of
[1:31:01] garbage got
[1:31:03] involved and God had to keep them 40
[1:31:07] years until he got every bit of it out
[1:31:12] of
[1:31:14] them so we ought to be ready for some
[1:31:19] dillies some personal life
[1:31:22] shaking some personal Al mental
[1:31:26] reconstruction some attitude
[1:31:30] adjustments we ought to be getting ready
[1:31:32] to be delivered from fear and start to
[1:31:35] have for us an assignment of Good
[1:31:40] Works be not hearers of the word only
[1:31:43] but do doers of the word you're not
[1:31:46] doing the word God's going to fix and
[1:31:48] tear everything down in your life that's
[1:31:51] keeping you from doing the word of God
[1:31:55] amen you say that's bad that's
[1:31:59] good you know why cuz he's not going to
[1:32:01] lose a one of
[1:32:03] you nothing can pluck you out of the
[1:32:05] palm of his hand but he can't keep
[1:32:08] nothing in the palm of his hand that's
[1:32:09] not
[1:32:11] his he's going to deal with
[1:32:14] us he's going to take with
[1:32:18] us so when you come out why why go back
[1:32:24] if God's dealing with your
[1:32:26] heart don't go back to an experience
[1:32:29] that didn't hold you in the first
[1:32:35] place don't go back to the methods you
[1:32:39] used that got you where you're
[1:32:44] at you got to dig
[1:32:49] deeper just don't go back until you've
[1:32:52] repented of what you've done
[1:32:54] you you you made up your mind you're not
[1:32:57] going to go that way
[1:32:58] anymore and then you just go back
[1:33:01] building the same building that you
[1:33:05] built you might change the paint
[1:33:08] color you might go add you know patch
[1:33:12] and crack and put web ta tape on it
[1:33:16] and put little drywall mud on it and
[1:33:19] sand it up and and clock the trim and
[1:33:23] make it look like it's all together but
[1:33:25] just give it 10
[1:33:28] years if the foundation ain't
[1:33:32] right and I think that's what God's
[1:33:34] trying to tell us go back and make
[1:33:40] sure you're built on the right
[1:33:42] foundation if you're not I'm going to
[1:33:45] keep tearing down what you
[1:33:50] build until I find that found
[1:33:55] foundation and I get you to build on
[1:33:59] it I think that's wonderful I think
[1:34:03] that's his grace I think that's his
[1:34:06] Mercy I think that's his
[1:34:08] patience listen if I could read this he
[1:34:12] says now
[1:34:14] friends it's only one road
[1:34:20] back I've seen many of them that could
[1:34:23] dance in the
[1:34:24] spirit that could speak with tongues and
[1:34:28] could run all over the building and
[1:34:31] everything else and still no
[1:34:35] Fellowship just as
[1:34:38] miserable as they could be because they
[1:34:41] built upon the wrong
[1:34:47] Foundation think of it praising
[1:34:51] worshiping speaking in Tong
[1:34:54] moved by in the spirit I'm not saying it
[1:34:57] wasn't the
[1:34:59] spirit but they never found the peace
[1:35:02] they never found the joy they they just
[1:35:06] you know
[1:35:07] it's that's what addiction is you you
[1:35:10] lose the feeling of the of the of the
[1:35:14] drug you use the and you just got to go
[1:35:16] get another fix and another fix and
[1:35:19] another
[1:35:22] fix we don't want be to the place we
[1:35:24] need religious
[1:35:27] fixes we don't want to keep rebuilding
[1:35:30] our church and rebuilding our life when
[1:35:33] I mean our own life our our personal
[1:35:35] church we just don't want to keep going
[1:35:38] saying oh this all messed up I'm going
[1:35:40] to go build another one I'm going to
[1:35:41] start a new life how many new lives do
[1:35:44] you have we're Eagles we're not
[1:35:51] cats right we're not trying to work on
[1:35:54] life seven life eight life
[1:35:56] nine no dig
[1:36:02] deeper make it
[1:36:04] personal get in there so when you get up
[1:36:08] you say I know Jesus Christ the same
[1:36:11] yesterday today and forever his Spirit
[1:36:14] has made an effect on my life and I have
[1:36:18] a promise he'll never leave me nor
[1:36:20] forsake me and he'll lead me and guide
[1:36:23] me and all truth and
[1:36:26] righteousness then you never have to
[1:36:28] worry about being tore down
[1:36:32] again there's a lot of people that are
[1:36:34] out there
[1:36:37] shattered and it was God's Own
[1:36:42] doing because they built on a round
[1:36:45] foundation and he had to bring them back
[1:36:48] to a
[1:36:50] place that they'll go get it right for
[1:36:53] themselves
[1:36:55] many a man is serving God because of his
[1:36:59] wife many a wife is serving God because
[1:37:03] of her husband and that'll work for so
[1:37:06] long but one day God's going to want to
[1:37:10] make it personal and he'll start tearing
[1:37:13] all your thinking down he'll start
[1:37:15] tearing you down it's not God against
[1:37:17] you it's God for you this is a love of
[1:37:20] God and another form of God's love is
[1:37:23] not he will get you back to
[1:37:28] him and when you meet him face to face
[1:37:32] and you have his change not your change
[1:37:38] his change in your life you've been born
[1:37:47] again you can have anointings they're
[1:37:50] wonderful you can have leadership you
[1:37:53] can have inspiration but nothing will
[1:37:56] ever take that birth from
[1:38:03] you so think it not
[1:38:07] strange don't let it shake
[1:38:12] you he wants you to get
[1:38:16] built as he
[1:38:18] says here he
[1:38:21] says because they built on the wrong
[1:38:24] Foundation that's right we got to get
[1:38:28] that right thing the first thing first
[1:38:32] if you don't your
[1:38:35] whole starting is wrong you've got to
[1:38:39] get back to the foundation your whole
[1:38:45] starting was wrong it's wonderful you
[1:38:49] started that is to your credit
[1:38:54] he's glad you started but his eternal
[1:38:57] connection with
[1:39:00] you you understand that you're his
[1:39:03] children his eternal connection with you
[1:39:06] will not let you build something that's
[1:39:09] not
[1:39:13] him that's why he went and tore all the
[1:39:16] the denominations down to set you
[1:39:21] free that you could build your life on
[1:39:26] his
[1:39:27] word and what he said and if he says
[1:39:30] you're forgiven you're forgiven if
[1:39:32] you've never heard those words from
[1:39:37] him if you've never confessed your sins
[1:39:40] to
[1:39:41] him and you've never
[1:39:44] realized and said to him I was
[1:39:47] wrong I just fellowship with a brother
[1:39:50] in Africa he was in six different
[1:39:53] different
[1:39:57] denominations I said brother you are in
[1:39:59] a denomination for every Church
[1:40:06] age and one day he found the
[1:40:10] truth he said you know how much
[1:40:12] repenting I had to do you know how much
[1:40:15] rebuilding I had to do you realize how
[1:40:18] many ideas I had to get rid of I said I
[1:40:22] know brother I I got raised up in this
[1:40:24] message by a lot of
[1:40:27] people that claim to know brother
[1:40:29] brandom that claim to know what he
[1:40:32] taught I was so uninfluenced by all
[1:40:35] kinds of quotations and things that
[1:40:38] brother brandom said and this and that
[1:40:40] and that one day they got it on a
[1:40:42] computer I found out 90% of it wasn't on
[1:40:46] the
[1:40:47] tapes what was God
[1:40:50] doing he couldn't let me go on
[1:40:56] amen you say that's terrible that's
[1:41:02] wonderful isn't that one of our great
[1:41:05] principles of what he does to a tree he
[1:41:09] purges it he prunes
[1:41:13] it he gets it back to its
[1:41:16] original I don't want a branch growing
[1:41:18] out of me that's not producing original
[1:41:21] Fruit
[1:41:23] prune it
[1:41:25] Lord and and and so Church the
[1:41:30] move the first thing God does and I'll
[1:41:34] try to get into this more in the future
[1:41:37] but the first thing God
[1:41:39] does is he separates
[1:41:42] unbelief and anything that's not the
[1:41:45] word of God fruit is in unbelief no
[1:41:49] matter how spiritual no matter how
[1:41:52] reasonable able no matter what it makes
[1:41:56] sense it's just not going to
[1:41:59] produce the next thing he does is he
[1:42:02] calls the bride to unite
[1:42:05] yes to come together in the one spirit
[1:42:08] and one
[1:42:10] baptism and then he calls her the duty
[1:42:14] to perform the works that he
[1:42:18] called if our
[1:42:20] lives I'm going to go down the road I
[1:42:22] didn't want to go to tonight but I'll
[1:42:24] just say
[1:42:25] it if we have things in our lives
[1:42:29] doctrines attitudes teachings judgments
[1:42:34] if we do a whole list of signs and
[1:42:37] wonders those signs and wonders are
[1:42:41] testifying to things that aren't
[1:42:47] truth and therefore the scripture says
[1:42:50] they hold the word of God and
[1:42:52] unrighteous
[1:42:56] I don't want to be
[1:42:58] there so we're going to God's going to
[1:43:00] press us to the place that we become the
[1:43:04] true
[1:43:05] representatives of the true Living Word
[1:43:08] and the true bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:43:11] that's what his promise is for a
[1:43:15] church so that's a principle I just
[1:43:19] wanted to share with you tonight God
[1:43:22] tearing our walls down until we're built
[1:43:27] on the foundation and no other Stone can
[1:43:31] a man lay than the Chief Cornerstone is
[1:43:34] with Jesus
[1:43:36] Christ and Paul was preaching this 2,000
[1:43:41] years ago and we're returning back to
[1:43:44] the same gospel Paul preached the same
[1:43:47] gospel our messenger brought to us back
[1:43:49] to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:43:53] forever God bless you stand
[1:44:02] together thank you but that's I'm glad
[1:44:05] you appreciate the word and I know that
[1:44:07] you love me and and I I I just got to
[1:44:11] share with you I was so embarrassed
[1:44:13] overseas
[1:44:15] because the first night I preached in
[1:44:20] Zambia uh after service all the kids
[1:44:23] that were oh I would say probably from
[1:44:25] 12 under they all started running up to
[1:44:28] their parents was that brother branam
[1:44:32] was that brother
[1:44:33] brandom and and uh so you know uh you I
[1:44:37] and I know that I'm Irish just like
[1:44:39] brother brandham was and and I'm sure
[1:44:42] there's some resemblance both Billy Paul
[1:44:44] and Joseph told me that that I look like
[1:44:47] Daddy you know and you know certain
[1:44:50] features and things well then it got
[1:44:53] worse than that
[1:44:55] because I'm an American and they all
[1:44:58] were raised up under British influence
[1:45:01] you know so they all got the queen's
[1:45:03] English with an
[1:45:06] accent and so I'm just talking like an
[1:45:09] American well now they said you you
[1:45:11] sound just like brother
[1:45:13] Brandon well then I'm reading
[1:45:16] quotes and they come to the conclusion
[1:45:18] that I'm preaching just like brother
[1:45:21] Brandon and so
[1:45:24] which you know I mean you that makes you
[1:45:26] feel good and everything but down in
[1:45:27] your heart you know you're so far away
[1:45:31] from what brother brandham was and what
[1:45:33] he did you don't even want them
[1:45:35] associating you with that you know what
[1:45:38] I mean it's like who no you know what I
[1:45:41] mean because you know somebody's going
[1:45:43] to take it and just blow it out of the
[1:45:47] water so then the brother started
[1:45:50] kidding me you know making fun of me CU
[1:45:53] they knew it got to me and they'd say
[1:45:56] good morning brother brandom how are you
[1:45:57] doing today brother BR they pick me up
[1:45:59] how how's brother brandom today you know
[1:46:01] they're just rubbing it in part of me
[1:46:03] wanted to stay and part of me wanted to
[1:46:05] get out of Dodge so uh but any anyway I
[1:46:11] I'll tell you what I'll never know what
[1:46:13] he knew I'll never have the experiences
[1:46:16] he have but if I could get a little bit
[1:46:19] of his nature that would be my heart's
[1:46:22] desire
[1:46:24] just to have some of the love that he
[1:46:26] had in his heart and the sacrifice that
[1:46:30] he had in his heart that would make the
[1:46:33] world of difference to me isn't that
[1:46:36] your heart's desire to Lord tear
[1:46:38] everything down that isn't right I
[1:46:43] I I don't care if I put a lot of time
[1:46:46] into it you know what would you have me
[1:46:49] to do and I think that what he's looking
[1:46:53] for us and so if he comes into your life
[1:46:56] and he's you start to see Things Fall
[1:47:00] Apart don't
[1:47:03] fear sit back and say praise
[1:47:08] God he's getting all the unbelief out of
[1:47:12] me it's him working on
[1:47:16] me I'm not what
[1:47:18] I should
[1:47:20] be and I'm not what I want to be but I'm
[1:47:24] not what I was
[1:47:26] either and if I could just keep pressing
[1:47:28] that Mark in My Heart Lord I want to be
[1:47:31] like
[1:47:33] you his love for you is so
[1:47:36] great that he won't allow something
[1:47:40] that's not
[1:47:41] him to have possession of your heart
[1:47:46] your mind your actions or your life he
[1:47:50] will come and bring you into his fold
[1:47:55] and he'll take everything
[1:47:58] out that he can't love and wrap his arms
[1:48:03] around and you say well what about my
[1:48:05] past forget your past leave those things
[1:48:08] which are behind behind put yourself in
[1:48:12] his mercy and his
[1:48:16] grace I'm glad I don't have to meet the
[1:48:20] things I've said and the things I've
[1:48:21] done
[1:48:23] I'm glad that every time Satan brings it
[1:48:25] up there's a blood spinning around the
[1:48:29] world that that action of mine can't get
[1:48:33] through and I'm trusting in that aren't
[1:48:35] you don't you love them amen let's just
[1:48:38] pray together our gracious father we've
[1:48:41] heard such lovely gospel today and we
[1:48:46] saw so many come up to be prayed for and
[1:48:51] want to rededicate their Liv lives and
[1:48:54] my heart father for them most probably
[1:48:57] most of them aren't here this
[1:49:00] evening but father that you you
[1:49:04] that forgive my vocabulary Lord and my
[1:49:08] inability to approach you
[1:49:11] correctly but father my heart's desires
[1:49:14] they don't build on the same old
[1:49:15] Foundation that don't
[1:49:18] work that they don't put a lot of effort
[1:49:21] into a new Christan Christian Life just
[1:49:24] to find that it fails down the
[1:49:28] road father I just pray according to
[1:49:31] this
[1:49:33] principle that you won't let any
[1:49:35] untempered mortar come into your their
[1:49:39] lives that you'll keep driving them back
[1:49:42] right from the beginning until they come
[1:49:45] face to face with
[1:49:47] you Lord keep knocking at their heart
[1:49:52] I like how Matthew said it not to run
[1:49:55] around and get their house all
[1:49:58] straightened up and cleaned up but they
[1:50:01] will invite you in just the way you
[1:50:05] are Lord and that little girl that came
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:11] up and she asked for prayer she said I
[1:50:14] want to be a good
[1:50:17] child I thought why didn't she want to
[1:50:19] be a good child cuz she was a child
[1:50:22] and you meant her right where she was
[1:50:26] at and if we could know that that you
[1:50:29] will always meet us right where we
[1:50:32] are you keep all your appointments Lord
[1:50:36] you never miss
[1:50:38] one and Lord I my heart I would just ask
[1:50:42] that the our assembly that you've put
[1:50:46] together here in Bedford Texas our
[1:50:50] Believers coming from all over the
[1:50:53] Metroplex that their spirit will be a
[1:50:56] spirit of love and caring one for
[1:50:59] another and praying one for
[1:51:02] another that they'll know that they have
[1:51:04] a source in a storehouse that has every
[1:51:08] answer for every question in their life
[1:51:12] if they'll wait on
[1:51:13] you and that you promised youd never
[1:51:16] leave them nor forsake them but that
[1:51:19] you'd be with them even in them till the
[1:51:21] end and and that you would lead and
[1:51:23] guide them in all truth and
[1:51:26] righteousness we just ask that you would
[1:51:28] grant that in Jesus precious name we
[1:51:31] pray amen I don't know this song I don't
[1:51:34] if you help me sing
[1:51:39] it I remember who I was oh I was I
