[16:43] um we've got a chance tonight to make
[16:47] this a red letter day if you haven't
[16:49] already the opportunity exists right
[16:52] [Music]
[16:53] now it's what we have need of
[16:59] if you don't mind I want to make a
[17:04] reference to
[17:09] Moses I heard brother Bram say this
[17:13] week he said God said he would bring his
[17:15] children out with a strong
[17:17] hand and he
[17:20] did but he sent
[17:22] Moses it was God in Moses
[17:26] right and if we're to overcome it's not
[17:29] my own doing it's God in you God in
[17:35] us and he told
[17:43] Moses if I can find it here he said I I
[17:47] appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and
[17:51] unto
[17:52] Jacob by the name of God
[17:56] Almighty but by my name Jehovah HOV I
[17:59] was not known to
[18:02] them what name is God going to have for
[18:06] a raptured bride think of that he said
[18:09] it' take all of eternity for him to
[18:12] continue to reveal himself to us we've
[18:14] got a crown waiting sure but we need
[18:17] something to get us through this time so
[18:21] let's let's as our
[18:23] brother exhorted us to stick with one
[18:27] another to uphold one another another to
[18:30] be there for our brothers and sisters
[18:32] pray for one another appreciate your
[18:34] prayers for us while we were
[18:36] out you know the book of Isaiah says he
[18:39] gives power to the weak and those that
[18:42] have no might he increases strength so
[18:44] we're here tonight to absorb some of
[18:46] that strength we get from God's Eternal
[18:49] Word let's bow our heads our gracious
[18:51] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once

[35:12] feel knowing that we sit under the voice
[35:16] of the messenger of this
[35:19] age though the systems of the world
[35:23] don't see how that fits in the word of
[35:26] God they don't see how it's a part of
[35:29] the
[35:31] Gospel they just never moved as they set
[35:35] up camps down life's
[35:38] road but father you have shed your light
[35:41] upon us in this hour for it shall be
[35:45] light in the evening time lord and you
[35:48] gave us eyesa that we might see and our
[35:51] eyes were open to the truth of your word
[35:55] father and we saw you veiled in flesh
[35:58] doing the same Works amongst the
[36:01] Gentiles that you did amongst the
[36:05] Jews and father our hearts caught it and
[36:09] something within us said amen and amen
[36:14] father may we draw our confidence this
[36:16] evening from that word we ask you to
[36:19] bless us tonight as we've come out to
[36:22] Fellowship around God's word so just
[36:25] trust father that you'll open it up to
[36:27] to us we pray in Jesus precious name
[36:31] amen amen if you have your Bibles we
[36:33] want to read a couple scriptures and and
[36:36] trust that the Lord uh will just
[36:40] encourage us this evening
[36:44] um I'd like to read uh uh let's start
[36:48] first in Galatians
[36:51] um uh
[36:53] five and uh
[37:01] we'll just start with 15 because it's
[37:05] getting to be very
[37:07] acal in these recent
[37:09] times Galatians 5:5 he says but if ye
[37:13] bite and devour one another take heed
[37:18] that ye be not consumed one of another
[37:23] this I say then walk in the the spirit
[37:28] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[37:32] flesh for the flesh lusteth against the
[37:35] spirit and the spirit against the
[37:39] Flesh and these are
[37:42] contrary one to the other so that you
[37:46] cannot do the things that ye would but
[37:51] if you be led of the spirit ye are not
[37:54] under the law and then let's turn over
[37:59] to
[38:00] Romans and
[38:04] um and we'll start in Romans uh the 10th
[38:10] chapter and we'll start uh with uh uh
[38:16] Romans
[38:17] 7 and
[38:21] uh let me see where I want to start here
[38:23] let's we'll start with uh
[38:28] let's start with uh Romans 10 and
[38:33] 13 He says for whosoever sh shall call
[38:40] upon the name of the Lord shall be
[38:43] saved how then shall they call on him in
[38:49] whom they have not
[38:52] believed and how shall they believe in
[38:58] him of whom they have not
[39:02] heard and how shall they hear without a
[39:08] preacher amen aren't you glad God sent a
[39:12] prophet and how shall they preach except
[39:16] they be sent as it is written how
[39:19] beautiful are the feet of them that
[39:22] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[39:25] Good Tidings of good good
[39:28] things but they have not all obeyed the
[39:33] gospel for
[39:35] isaas saith Lord who hath believed our
[39:41] report and I want to just hold that up
[39:44] here who has believed the report of the
[39:49] preacher and we're not talking about
[39:52] this preacher we're talking about the
[39:54] preacher of the age okay every other
[39:57] preacher should be just under the
[40:00] preacher of the age and have the same
[40:03] voice you know what I mean and they they
[40:06] should be
[40:08] preaching that gospel you know not
[40:12] Wesley's gospel but the truth of the
[40:15] light of the gospel for that age and but
[40:19] then we've got to believe the report so
[40:22] let's just let's hold that so then Faith
[40:26] cometh by by
[40:28] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[40:34] faith right
[40:36] Revelation
[40:38] faith hope that of something to believe
[40:43] that you know will come to pass that
[40:45] comes by hearing the word of God that's
[40:49] the source of it you can't muster it up
[40:52] inside
[40:53] yourself because you have no you have
[40:56] nothing but yourself to back it you know
[41:00] what I mean but if God put in his word I
[41:03] could lift 500 lb you know the only guy
[41:06] I ever knew that bench 500 lbs was
[41:09] brother Chris but uh so if you could do
[41:13] that God said in his word I could do it
[41:15] then I could do it because God would be
[41:19] there to bring that word to pass but if
[41:23] I just muster it
[41:25] up right then I don't have anything
[41:29] within me to bring it to pass so Faith
[41:32] cometh by hearing and then hearing by
[41:36] the word that spoke it so just hold that
[41:39] there because we're going to go through
[41:40] a little something tonight I just think
[41:42] it'll lift your spirits and um and and
[41:46] and just make you just feel so glad for
[41:49] the faith that cometh By Hearing in
[41:51] hearing by the word of God but I say
[41:54] have they not heard verily sound went
[41:58] into all the Earth and their words unto
[42:03] the ends of the world Amen so what we
[42:08] want to do tonight is we just are going
[42:11] to sit back for a moment and we're going
[42:13] to listen to uh a portion of uh out of
[42:19] the message God's power to
[42:23] transform and uh
[42:27] and if you it's just 10 minutes but if
[42:30] you just follow it down you'll be able
[42:32] to start placing to what's
[42:36] transpiring and like I've always said
[42:39] one of the things that Satan has uh
[42:42] tried to do is he's always tried to lie
[42:45] to us and the prophet of God brings that
[42:48] up but you have a choice right to
[42:51] believe what God says or to believe what
[42:54] he
[42:55] says okay
[42:57] and and it it it comes down to a pretty
[43:00] simple thing but so uh you may have your
[43:04] seats and uh uh if you want to uh I
[43:09] guess you can pull it up on your phone
[43:12] if you want uh uh this is uh
[43:20] 911 um
[43:23] 1965 and uh we're going to start on
[43:26] paragraph
[43:28] uh uh I believe we're going to start on
[43:34] uh what was it paragraph
[43:38] uh uh 212 was that
[43:40] correct okay
[43:43] paragraph
[43:45] 210 all right so we're going to start on
[43:47] paragraph 210 and we're just going to go
[43:50] into about paragraph the end of 239
[43:57] and then we'll just want to go back uh
[44:00] through it with us and just read some of
[44:03] the paragraphs together and uh just see
[44:06] if uh our faith can be lifted up and I I
[44:11] trust in this tonight that you can see
[44:15] the love of God for you so God bless you
[44:18] let's just take a few moments and listen
[44:20] to God's wonderful
[44:24] word see it's a modern Eden now what
[44:27] done himself he's moving himself
[44:29] Rome this final great eating eating
[44:32] place you see what the pope come over
[44:33] here the other day you know what all
[44:35] them 13s that happened then he spoke 13
[44:37] words had 13 taking communion spoke uh
[44:40] in Yankee Stadium which is 13 everything
[44:42] was 13 and our nation's numberers 13
[44:44] prayers the 13th chapter of Revelation
[44:46] 13 stripes 13 stars 13 bars 133 numbers
[44:49] on the coins 13 stars on the
[44:51] everything's 13 and a
[44:53] woman here comes the pulpe the head to
[44:56] the woman the false Antichrist to the
[44:58] false bride of science which our world
[45:01] our America Eastern World here Western
[45:04] world has led the world in science comes
[45:06] to her in his scientific church I think
[45:09] is that the God's power to transform
[45:14] 91165 then we then we'll have to line up
[45:16] the paragraphs I
[45:21] think there's several of
[45:25] them do you have my book there really
[45:28] let let's make sure yeah
[45:33] so but the prophet can speak thus sayith
[45:36] the Lord there he is
[45:39] nonsense I like thus sayith the
[45:45] Lord but the prophet can speak thus
[45:48] sayith the Lord people say nonsense see
[45:52] there's not a hope for
[45:53] them it's they say well we're smart
[45:56] we're ual we don't have to take that
[45:58] kind of stuff we know what we're talking
[45:59] about it's also an old proverb that
[46:02] fools will walk with hob nail shoes
[46:04] Where Angels Fear to
[46:07] tr certainly
[46:09] now what is the transformation quickly
[46:13] how do we get it what does a
[46:15] transformation God does it by the spirit
[46:18] of his word he transformed he plants his
[46:21] seed throws his Spirit on it and brings
[46:23] forth the
[46:24] product his holy spirit trans forms a
[46:27] seed word in to be Vindicated of its
[46:30] kind what kind of a seed you are that
[46:32] shows just what's in you you can't hide
[46:35] it whatever you are inside it shows
[46:39] outside you just can't keep from it you
[46:42] can't make that tree anything but what
[46:43] it is see it's it's going to be that way
[46:46] the Holy Spirit transforms the seeds
[46:48] that's on the inside of it no matter
[46:50] what kind of seed it is it'll transform
[46:52] it it's evil it'll bring forth evil if
[46:55] it's a hypocrite it'll bring forth a
[46:56] hypocrite
[46:57] if it's a genuine word of God it'll
[46:59] bring forth a genuine son or daughter of
[47:01] God through a thinking man's filter when
[47:03] the seed comes up he comes through that
[47:06] it produces a son and daughter of
[47:08] God one day when the world lay in the
[47:11] darkness of
[47:12] chaos God now listen close course we're
[47:15] not going to speak just a little bit
[47:17] longer look one day when the world was
[47:20] again in all kinds of
[47:22] religions washing hands pots wearing
[47:25] different robes and bonnets and so forth
[47:28] it lay in the midst of another
[47:31] chaos the genuine Israel of God had been
[47:35] so perverted from the laws and statutes
[47:37] of God Jesus said you with your
[47:39] Traditions make the word of God of no
[47:42] effect to the People by your
[47:46] tradition look at them holy priests they
[47:49] call them and Jesus said you of your
[47:51] father the devil and his works you
[47:54] do it's exactly what he said
[47:58] now when the world lay in that kind of a
[48:00] fix God's spirit moved
[48:05] again upon a seed that was
[48:09] predestinated he translated and
[48:12] transformed Isaiah 9:6 of its promise
[48:16] the God was made in human flesh to save
[48:20] that chaos time when man was made the
[48:23] image of God here comes God by the
[48:25] prophet foreing now remember the word
[48:28] the prophet foresaw it just the same
[48:30] Prophet that seen Satan in this last
[48:33] days of this educational program and
[48:36] things he had religious program the same
[48:39] prophet Isaiah 9:6 said unto us a child
[48:42] is born through us the son is given and
[48:46] his name Shall be Called counselor the
[48:48] Prince of Peace the Mighty God the
[48:51] Everlasting
[48:54] father and of his Reign there will be no
[48:56] end
[48:57] and that word's God's word and the
[49:00] spirit moved upon that word and it
[49:03] formed in the womb of a virgin amen a
[49:06] son is born I created
[49:10] born Satan tried and triy again to
[49:16] spread he took him up and said if you
[49:18] are what you say you are then do some of
[49:21] this healing here for me show me how you
[49:24] can do it turn this bread in this stones
[49:28] into bread I see you take a dive because
[49:31] the scripture says you'll do it you see
[49:32] them religious Devils today still saying
[49:34] that same thing if there's such a thing
[49:36] as Divine Healing here Ladi brother SW
[49:38] so let's see healing that same devil
[49:42] stood at Jesus cross said if thou be the
[49:44] Son of God come down off the cross the
[49:46] word said he was the Son of God the
[49:48] spirit proved he was the son of God
[49:51] Isaiah 9 and6 was fulfilled the other
[49:53] night many of you in the broadcast heard
[49:55] how that we 60 some odd scriptures
[49:57] almost I believe about proving that the
[49:59] scriptures said that that was
[50:01] him oh Satan tried and tried again do
[50:05] everything one night laying on the back
[50:06] of a ship he see him asleep he said I'll
[50:09] destroy him right now but he couldn't he
[50:11] tried to tempt him into doing the wrong
[50:13] thing but he couldn't do it why he had
[50:16] been sprayed with a repellent of
[50:20] predestination it can't be
[50:23] deceived no the word said he'd be here
[50:27] amen amen ain't no devil going to bother
[50:30] him no other Son of God is predestinated
[50:34] to take his place he's sprayed with a
[50:37] repellent Satan's poison denominational
[50:39] doctors don't even touch him at all he
[50:41] moves right on nothing going to bother
[50:43] him it didn't have any effect upon him
[50:47] well I'll make you the bishop of all the
[50:49] earth I have rule over it if you just
[50:51] worship me come on join my group I I'll
[50:54] make you the ruler I'll step down let
[50:55] you up he said get sit behind me Satan
[50:58] it is written thou shall worship God the
[51:01] word and him only shall thou
[51:04] serve then one day on this great person
[51:06] I'd like to stay there a while but one
[51:09] day the spirit moved upon him again
[51:12] because there some word have been wrote
[51:14] about him come from God to the prophet
[51:18] and he was led to the slaughter like a
[51:21] lamb and the spirit moved upon on him
[51:23] and led him and sent him to calvary's
[51:25] cross
[51:27] there he died and everything that was
[51:29] spoke of him in his death was fulfilled
[51:31] to bring light and Life to all the
[51:34] predestinated seed of God that was up on
[51:37] the earth he brought the way to do it
[51:40] here is the
[51:42] seed the the spirit brings the
[51:45] life transforming Sons and Daughters of
[51:49] God from the world in this dark chaos
[51:53] into to be Sons and Daughters of God
[51:55] don't stumble that word predestination I
[51:56] know you do but listen it's not my word
[52:00] it's one of God's words if you want to
[52:03] read it read Ephesians 15 which he has
[52:07] predestinated us to the adoptions of
[52:09] sons through Jesus
[52:11] Christ just let me break it just a
[52:14] minute and just a minute to break this
[52:17] out of your mind look just as you were
[52:19] in your father at the beginning of germ
[52:23] seed do you know that every one of you
[52:26] you were in and your great great great
[52:27] grandfather also do you know that read
[52:30] the book of Hebrews or that we find that
[52:34] Levi paid ties when he was in The Lawns
[52:38] of Abraham four generations behind him
[52:41] when Abraham paid TI to Mel chdc it was
[52:45] accounted to his great great grandson
[52:47] down below him and he was then in the
[52:49] laws of
[52:50] Abraham there you are see you were in
[52:52] the laws of your father but your father
[52:54] could not have any fellowship with you
[52:57] until you was
[52:59] transformed into a body of Flesh my son
[53:03] there was in me I I I wanted a son but
[53:07] he was in me then see he was in me then
[53:11] but through wedlock he was transformed
[53:13] into a man like me and then he become
[53:17] like me you become like your parents see
[53:20] because it was in you to begin with now
[53:23] if we
[53:24] are the sons of
[53:27] God his attributes which you are an
[53:30] attribute of your father not your mother
[53:35] your father The Germ lays in the father
[53:39] and now your mother was an incubator
[53:41] that bear you bear the seed of your
[53:44] father see and the Earth in flesh is
[53:48] also the incubator that bears the seed
[53:51] of God see just exactly not the world
[53:53] how great the world how great the god
[53:55] that made it Hallelujah now if you are a
[54:00] son and daughter of God then you were in
[54:04] God at the
[54:06] beginning you're his attribute if you
[54:09] wasn't there then then you never was or
[54:12] never will
[54:14] be cuse I cannot bear a from my loins
[54:18] the son of this man
[54:21] here or that man there I can only bear
[54:25] my own son
[54:26] sons and they bear my
[54:31] likeness Hallelujah is
[54:34] it Sons and
[54:36] Daughters was in God at the beginning
[54:40] now look you got eternal life you save
[54:43] we believe it that we got eternal life
[54:46] well there's only one form of eternal
[54:47] life and that's God hallelujah that's
[54:51] the only thing it is eternal is God then
[54:54] if you've got eternal life that life is
[54:56] in you always
[54:58] was and you were in the laes of God
[55:00] before the even was a world and when the
[55:03] word itself Jesus himself is called the
[55:07] word and St John 1 said in the beginning
[55:10] was the word and the word is with God
[55:12] and the Word was God and the Word was
[55:14] made flesh and dwell among us then you
[55:16] were in the laes of Jesus and went to
[55:19] Calvary with him you died with him and
[55:22] you're raised with him and today we're
[55:25] sitting in heavenly place that's in him
[55:28] fill with his
[55:30] Spirit Sons and Daughters of God die
[55:34] with him raised with him sure now then
[55:38] now now you can fellowship with him you
[55:42] couldn't back there because you were
[55:45] just a word in a seed but now he's
[55:48] manifested you and now he wants you to
[55:50] fellowship with him then he came down
[55:52] and was made blessed so he could
[55:53] perfectly fellowship with you amen see
[55:56] the perfect
[55:57] Fellowship oh my them deep mysteries of
[56:00] God how wonderful see God cannot
[56:03] Fellowship in the spirit so God became
[56:05] man with us Jesus Christ was God himself
[56:08] manifested CS his the son because he was
[56:10] begotten but it's just a tabernacle from
[56:12] to live
[56:13] in no man has seen God at any but the
[56:16] only begotten of the father has the
[56:18] clarity God built himself a house a body
[56:20] to live in come down so that you could
[56:23] touch him 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[56:25] controversy great the mystery of God is
[56:27] for God was manifested in the flesh see
[56:29] the Angels believed on received up into
[56:31] heaven see now he you being flesh and
[56:34] him being flesh then you can Fellowship
[56:36] one because he was God's attribute of
[56:39] love God is love is that right and Jesus
[56:44] was God's attribute of love and when the
[56:46] attribute of love was displayed which
[56:49] that was God himself all the attributes
[56:51] that hung on to him come to him all the
[56:53] father has given me will come to me
[56:55] short Hadad be predestinated it wasn't
[56:58] you won't be there that's all certainly

[1:02:00] that word it'll grow it's got to grow
[1:02:03] God's transforming power that brought it
[1:02:05] up in the first place he's just on his
[1:02:06] road back taking it back again now he's
[1:02:09] going right back again to where it was
[1:02:12] Enoch was translated from Death By God's
[1:02:16] transforming power what did God do that
[1:02:19] for for a type of the Rapture in church
[1:02:22] that's coming yeah Elijah was a saint
[1:02:26] Jesus body was quickened after it was
[1:02:28] dead and in the grave Jesus body was
[1:02:32] quickened by the word of God and
[1:02:34] transformed from a dead cold image to a
[1:02:37] resurrected glorified Son of God because
[1:02:41] the prophet Psalms 16:10 if you want to
[1:02:44] put it down 16:10 said I will not leave
[1:02:48] his soul in Hell neither will I suffer
[1:02:51] my Holy One to see corruption oh God

[1:02:57] God's word plant it in your heart if you
[1:03:00] want to go on
[1:03:01] Rapture you want to be Christians
[1:03:04] genuine place this word as a I believe
[1:03:07] it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll
[1:03:09] and eat it
[1:03:10] up that the prophet and the word would
[1:03:13] become the same every promise in there
[1:03:16] has to manifest itself because it's
[1:03:19] God's original seed don't you let some
[1:03:22] educated Theologian out here try to pump
[1:03:24] it out of you don't you let him spray
[1:03:26] with that carnal science and knowledge
[1:03:29] and education believe
[1:03:38] God he didn't say I had to understand it
[1:03:41] he just said I had to believe
[1:03:44] it
[1:03:45] amen amen let's just take just a couple
[1:03:49] seconds and just uh run back over just a
[1:03:52] few of those statements again and and I
[1:03:55] mean you you heard some
[1:03:58] things you know and the the the the
[1:04:00] people he was preaching them to just did
[1:04:04] not believe it and you notice how he
[1:04:07] said the prophet says thus sayith the
[1:04:10] Lord ah they don't believe it they're
[1:04:12] smarter than that he was giving a
[1:04:16] precursor to the very attitude that was
[1:04:20] going to be there of the things he was
[1:04:23] about to say
[1:04:27] you understand now because the
[1:04:29] church had made its
[1:04:34] living and binding the People by the
[1:04:38] fact that if the they would follow their
[1:04:42] teachings and follow their
[1:04:45] instructions and adhere to their rules
[1:04:49] that they would be saved and have
[1:04:53] eternal life
[1:04:56] so they that's what that they uh were
[1:05:04] holding the People by and now he's going
[1:05:08] to start saying things that breaks down
[1:05:13] everything that they're built
[1:05:15] on and so uh if we we just went back he
[1:05:20] says now what is
[1:05:24] transformation quickly
[1:05:26] this is paragraph 212 how do we get
[1:05:30] it now what does the
[1:05:36] transformation okay how do we get it we
[1:05:38] don't get
[1:05:39] it you understand that this is you know
[1:05:45] Jesus said you didn't seek me I sought
[1:05:49] you you know no man cometh unto the
[1:05:51] father l i draw
[1:05:54] him okay so he's trying to
[1:05:58] eliminate from your mind that that
[1:06:02] there's some form of of actions that you
[1:06:08] have to take to transform
[1:06:14] yourself okay that's what he's trying to
[1:06:17] do but he's trying to get us to is to
[1:06:20] believe what he said Faith cometh by
[1:06:24] hearing and hearing by the word believe
[1:06:28] the word believe what the word says and
[1:06:33] then he's going to just move
[1:06:35] so so what's going to cause
[1:06:39] that to come to life what's going to
[1:06:43] cause the change so if you just follow
[1:06:46] this I just I want to share this with
[1:06:48] you because I really believed that we're
[1:06:51] we're he said it right at the end we're
[1:06:54] into that now the Rapture is coming now
[1:06:56] that trans it's now so I believe that
[1:07:00] now is
[1:07:03] now so he says God does it by the spirit
[1:07:09] of his
[1:07:12] word he does the transforming by the
[1:07:15] spirit of his word he
[1:07:18] transforms he
[1:07:20] plant his
[1:07:22] seed throws his Spirit on it
[1:07:26] and it brings
[1:07:28] forth the
[1:07:31] product his holy spirit
[1:07:35] transforms the the the seed
[1:07:39] word in to be Vindicated of its
[1:07:45] kind okay so you understand that the
[1:07:48] seeds planted he knows it's there but
[1:07:51] now he's going to transform it he's
[1:07:54] going to throw the spirit Spirit of his
[1:07:56] word not what everybody thinks as an
[1:08:01] anointing you understand or as a
[1:08:05] rain okay if we divide this you will see
[1:08:08] how the rain can fall on the just and
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:12] unjust okay it's not the
[1:08:16] rain it's the
[1:08:19] seed right that's the part of you that's
[1:08:22] God right so he said
[1:08:26] he says now what kind of seed you are
[1:08:31] that shows just what's in
[1:08:35] you now that's why I read that scripture
[1:08:38] the flesh Wars against the spirit and
[1:08:40] the spirit against the Flesh and these
[1:08:42] two are contrary to the other your flesh
[1:08:45] is not what's in you the seed is in your
[1:08:50] flesh and he went on to explain that
[1:08:53] about the seed being in the womb of the
[1:08:55] Earth you were in the womb of your
[1:08:57] mother he's trying to get the idea out
[1:08:59] of you to quit looking at yourself here
[1:09:04] and look at what the word says you are
[1:09:08] and where that you were in the beginning
[1:09:11] because that's what that he wants you to
[1:09:14] identify with see what you you he
[1:09:17] already said we read it right if you had
[1:09:20] eternal life you've always had eternal
[1:09:22] life so you're not being saved from no
[1:09:26] having no eternal life to eternal life
[1:09:30] you're being saved from the
[1:09:35] LIE do you understand that if you don't
[1:09:38] get this flesh to be become perfect you
[1:09:43] don't have
[1:09:45] it but what he's trying to get you to
[1:09:48] understand is if you'll hear this word
[1:09:51] this word will transform you it'll
[1:09:54] change you you from flesh to
[1:09:59] life and that's what he wants you to
[1:10:01] have faith
[1:10:05] in because without it's impossible to
[1:10:08] please God Satan wants you to look in
[1:10:10] the mirror and say
[1:10:13] no but you want to look in the mirror
[1:10:16] and look yourself right in the eye and
[1:10:18] say Satan get behind
[1:10:23] me cuz the spirit spirit of God Can
[1:10:26] Transform now let's just read a little
[1:10:28] further if you don't mind just we'll
[1:10:30] just spend a little time of Fellowship
[1:10:32] brother Jeremy Shriner is going to
[1:10:34] preach for us this weekend so uh we just
[1:10:38] want to Fellowship here he says what
[1:10:41] kind of seed just what what's in you you
[1:10:45] can't hide
[1:10:46] it whatever you are inside it shows
[1:10:50] outside you just can't keep from it you
[1:10:53] can't make that tree anything but what
[1:10:58] it is see it's going to be that way now
[1:11:03] listen the Holy Spirit
[1:11:06] transforms the seed that's on the inside
[1:11:10] of
[1:11:12] it the Holy Spirit transforms the seed
[1:11:16] that's on the inside of it no matter
[1:11:20] what kind of seed it
[1:11:24] is it'll transform
[1:11:27] it if it's evil it'll bring forth evil
[1:11:31] if it's a hypocrite it'll bring forth
[1:11:33] the hypocrite if it's genuine word of
[1:11:36] God it'll bring forth genuine Sons and
[1:11:40] Daughters of
[1:11:41] God through a thinking man's filter when
[1:11:45] the seed comes up it comes through that
[1:11:48] it produces the Son and Daughter of God
[1:11:52] now so we always think well what what's
[1:11:55] going to the word of God the spirit of
[1:11:58] the word of God is the same Spirit of
[1:12:01] the word of God that makes you a
[1:12:03] Believer is the Same Spirit of the word
[1:12:05] of God that makes the evil seed
[1:12:10] evil that's why the rain can fall on the
[1:12:13] just and and the
[1:12:16] unjust it's not the it it's not the rain
[1:12:20] that transforms you it's the spirit of
[1:12:24] the word and you heard him say right
[1:12:27] every word is a
[1:12:32] promise so and God cannot
[1:12:36] lie so if God says anything it'll come
[1:12:40] to pass so no matter what struggle
[1:12:43] you're going through no matter how bad
[1:12:45] the flesh Wars against the spirit you've
[1:12:48] just got ask yourself do I
[1:12:51] believe what he said about me
[1:12:58] and if you can believe
[1:13:02] that and you can call unto the Lord who
[1:13:07] who will call unto him that hasn't heard
[1:13:11] and hasn't received the report the
[1:13:13] report for our
[1:13:16] age was that God predestinated the seed
[1:13:20] in you before the foundation of the
[1:13:23] beginning of the world and no regardless
[1:13:26] of what your ancestry
[1:13:32] is he planted it he'll water it he'll
[1:13:37] bring it to
[1:13:40] pass and that's the LIE is no he won't
[1:13:45] look at me I better get this to a place
[1:13:47] he can do it just believe
[1:13:52] God Abraham believed God he tried to
[1:13:56] give his wife away I mean what a crumb
[1:13:58] bum but he still believed God and it was
[1:14:02] imputed to him for righteousness his
[1:14:05] righteousness didn't come from the
[1:14:08] bringing the flesh into subjection his
[1:14:10] walk righteousness came to believe that
[1:14:13] God could transform his
[1:14:17] flesh into the word of
[1:14:21] God he can do it for you he can do it
[1:14:25] for me see The Same
[1:14:29] Spirit Satan's not a
[1:14:32] Creator The Same Spirit God brings forth
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:38] evil and the
[1:14:42] good just look look what's in you what's
[1:14:46] in your heart what's in your desire what
[1:14:49] do you
[1:14:52] want the flesh Wars against the spirit
[1:14:56] and the spirit against the flesh they're
[1:14:58] contrary one to another so we wouldn't
[1:15:01] always do the things that we would want
[1:15:03] to
[1:15:04] do but we're not looking to do
[1:15:08] it right we want him to do it we want
[1:15:14] him to create the
[1:15:19] change and we keep trying to change
[1:15:22] ourselves into this model of
[1:15:24] Christianity we keep trying to change
[1:15:26] oursel into this idea of Christianity
[1:15:29] instead of saying wait a minute God
[1:15:33] can't
[1:15:36] lie
[1:15:38] right and if I'm his
[1:15:41] attribute he said where else could my
[1:15:43] son come from but from
[1:15:46] me so if I'm his
[1:15:51] attribute then I've got to come forth
[1:15:56] and the life is in the sea we just went
[1:15:59] through that so it's there and the
[1:16:02] spirit is going to move upon it and it's
[1:16:05] going to change you that's why I've been
[1:16:07] trying to preach in just as humble as
[1:16:09] way as I know
[1:16:10] how is that you've got to
[1:16:16] recognize that you can't it's not
[1:16:19] becoming a Christian setting yourself in
[1:16:23] stone and have having all these
[1:16:25] Christian things that you do and you're
[1:16:28] just hanging on for dear life hoping he
[1:16:32] comes
[1:16:35] no it's changing every day transforming
[1:16:40] you bringing
[1:16:43] you growing
[1:16:46] you enlightening you teaching
[1:16:51] you your world changes around you
[1:16:57] it's not oh I
[1:16:59] believe I it's not believing it's
[1:17:03] knowing that he will transform
[1:17:09] you he will change you let's just read
[1:17:12] quickly some beautiful things he said so
[1:17:16] he says it's a product son and daughter
[1:17:18] of God that's what he produces and then
[1:17:20] he goes right down he says in all the
[1:17:22] darkness and all the chaos what is they
[1:17:25] do washing of pans all kinds of rules
[1:17:28] all kinds of things what were they doing
[1:17:31] with
[1:17:32] religion they were making the word of
[1:17:34] God of none
[1:17:38] effect they the people weren't looking
[1:17:41] for the
[1:17:42] change they weren't looking for a spirit
[1:17:45] to mold them make them to renew them to
[1:17:50] wash their water of their mind to change
[1:17:53] their thinking you know how beautiful it
[1:17:56] is to have your total thinking
[1:18:00] changed if you've ever been in this walk
[1:18:04] very long and you look back on the way
[1:18:06] you used to think you'll just bury your
[1:18:09] head in the
[1:18:12] sand but what's happened your mind is
[1:18:15] Switched look at some of you are under
[1:18:18] bondage to things that the people just
[1:18:21] held you down and and and uh just you
[1:18:25] know you're all rigid and and you had to
[1:18:28] do this and if you did this and you did
[1:18:31] that and all this stuff oo you're in
[1:18:35] danger no you're
[1:18:40] not if you had eternal life you always
[1:18:42] had eternal life that thus sayith the
[1:18:45] Lord prophet of God said it and I
[1:18:47] believe every word he
[1:18:51] says not not taking nothing from you
[1:18:57] but what did Paul say he said they come
[1:18:59] in and they spy out the
[1:19:02] Liberty the freedom that we
[1:19:05] have they want you to think if I could
[1:19:08] every little thing just perfect no I
[1:19:12] can't make it perfect I want to make it
[1:19:14] perfect Lord transform me change me he
[1:19:20] doesn't do it all at
[1:19:22] once so we read d says they make the
[1:19:25] word of God of no effect and so you know
[1:19:29] and and so they and he just keeps on
[1:19:32] going here and he says everything he
[1:19:35] said in Isaiah come to pass and then he
[1:19:37] made this statement Satan tried and
[1:19:40] tries again to spray it he took them up
[1:19:45] paragraph 16 says if if you are what you
[1:19:48] say you
[1:19:53] are he ever use that that on
[1:19:56] you if you are what you say you
[1:20:03] are and he always tries to play the
[1:20:06] hypocrite card the flesh
[1:20:10] card God didn't say what I was when I
[1:20:13] was here he said what I was when I was
[1:20:19] there so I'm not going to let him defeat
[1:20:23] me with my
[1:20:27] myself I'm going to look at myself and
[1:20:29] say
[1:20:32] okay what you're seeing he will change
[1:20:36] what you're seeing he will transform the
[1:20:39] weakness that I'm expressing he will
[1:20:41] deliver me
[1:20:44] from because he said in his word but
[1:20:47] what he wants you to do is become
[1:20:50] paralyzed right there with his lie
[1:20:55] and the only thing that sets you free
[1:20:57] from a lie is the truth the truth is
[1:21:00] what set you
[1:21:02] free and that's why they hated him
[1:21:05] because here are the prophets preaching
[1:21:07] a word that's going to set the true Sons
[1:21:10] and Daughters of God free from all their
[1:21:14] denominational
[1:21:18] nonsense
[1:21:19] free Not
[1:21:23] Afraid how can you how can someone make
[1:21:25] you afraid if you
[1:21:28] believe this man's
[1:21:33] report if you believe his report he says
[1:21:37] he says if you are say what you are then
[1:21:41] do something of this healing here for me
[1:21:46] show me how you can do
[1:21:50] it he he never changes his tactics
[1:21:56] turn this
[1:21:57] bread stones into bread let me see you
[1:22:01] take a dive because the scriptures said
[1:22:05] you'll do it
[1:22:07] see he does the same thing to you he's
[1:22:11] always comparing your flesh to your
[1:22:15] Christianity he's always comparing your
[1:22:18] weakness you can't get rid of your
[1:22:22] weakness you can't
[1:22:25] you can't heal
[1:22:27] yourself that's not our
[1:22:30] promise how do we
[1:22:32] overcome we overcome by the word of God
[1:22:36] we overcome by the promise of God we
[1:22:39] overcome by the fact wait a minute if
[1:22:41] that seeds in me then his
[1:22:46] spirit will transform it and I'm going
[1:22:50] to change from what you're seeing into
[1:22:54] what he wants to be so when you see
[1:22:56] yourself in weakness and you see
[1:22:58] yourself in failure and you see yourself
[1:23:01] in sin you hang on to the
[1:23:05] transforming power of God that God can
[1:23:09] take you from that condition and make
[1:23:12] you from what you are to what he wants
[1:23:15] you to be but you've got to be ready to
[1:23:21] change or transform
[1:23:27] and then he keep he he goes
[1:23:29] on he says Satan tried and tried again
[1:23:32] to do
[1:23:34] everything and you know he but he
[1:23:36] couldn't do it and he tried to tempt him
[1:23:38] he couldn't do it he had what did he
[1:23:40] have the repellent of look listen what
[1:23:43] he said he tried to tempt him to doing
[1:23:47] the wrong thing but he couldn't do it
[1:23:50] why he had been sprayed with the
[1:23:53] repellent of of
[1:23:56] predestination it can't be deceived no
[1:24:00] no the word said he would be here
[1:24:06] amen it it would deceive the what very
[1:24:10] elect if it was
[1:24:16] possible when we start drawing the
[1:24:19] line between that Eternal part that we
[1:24:23] are
[1:24:24] and this outside
[1:24:27] manifestation and understand that our
[1:24:30] eternal life is not what's at
[1:24:33] stake we're not fighting for eternal
[1:24:36] life we have eternal life what we're
[1:24:39] fighting for is the
[1:24:42] transformation of this flesh into the
[1:24:45] image of his son by his
[1:24:50] spirit that we start bringing this under
[1:24:53] subjection
[1:24:55] our hearts changed our minds changed our
[1:24:59] hungers are changed our desires are
[1:25:02] changed our Nature's being transformed
[1:25:05] it it's not instant that was another
[1:25:08] part of the LIE come down here kneel
[1:25:11] down speak in tongues rise up now you're
[1:25:14] saved wait a minute I'm going to read
[1:25:17] you in a second he said you always were
[1:25:21] saved you weren't saved you're still
[1:25:23] under the a lie but you always had
[1:25:27] eternal
[1:25:28] life think of it do you believe that can
[1:25:32] you believe that about yourself why did
[1:25:35] Jesus have perfect Faith because he
[1:25:37] believed what the word of God said about
[1:25:41] them when you can come to that place and
[1:25:45] say I love this message I love this word
[1:25:48] My Flesh fights against me but now I'm
[1:25:51] going to come into fellowship with that
[1:25:53] part of me that's God that part of me
[1:25:56] that's always was God it's there it's in
[1:25:59] me he said it's in me now I'm going to
[1:26:02] have him take that part of me that's him
[1:26:06] and overcome this part of me that's in
[1:26:09] the world he that is in you is greater
[1:26:14] than he that is in the
[1:26:18] world and then you got a clear
[1:26:22] picture say will make you your own
[1:26:28] enemy yeah your flesh is not what you
[1:26:33] are but we don't sin that the grace of
[1:26:37] God May
[1:26:39] abound right but we go back to what our
[1:26:42] heart's desire is and we
[1:26:45] overcome because it's given to the
[1:26:48] Overcomer that that lets God transform
[1:26:52] him to get the victory
[1:26:55] and then we just go on so he
[1:26:58] says he how he tried to tempt him
[1:27:04] and and he goes on he says Satan PO he
[1:27:08] said there ain't no evil going to bother
[1:27:11] him and no other Son of God that's
[1:27:15] predestinated to take his
[1:27:18] place
[1:27:20] what how do we take his place we don't
[1:27:24] don't take his place but we take the
[1:27:27] same place that he is with the same guy
[1:27:31] trying to spray us
[1:27:33] right he is sprayed with a repellent
[1:27:36] Satan poisons
[1:27:38] denominations old
[1:27:40] doctors don't even touch him at all he
[1:27:43] moves right
[1:27:44] along nothing's going to bother him
[1:27:48] see it didn't have any effect on them
[1:27:51] and I like that see we move right right
[1:27:55] along we keep
[1:27:57] moving right along we're not going to
[1:28:00] stop he
[1:28:02] said and and then he make this statement
[1:28:04] everything that was spoken of him in his
[1:28:07] death was fulfilled bringing light and
[1:28:11] Life to all the
[1:28:14] predestinated seed of God that was upon
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:19] Earth he brought the
[1:28:22] Wake to do it
[1:28:24] here is the
[1:28:26] seed the spirit brings the
[1:28:31] life transforming Sons and Daughters of
[1:28:35] God from the world in this dark chaos
[1:28:40] into being the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:45] that's how it donees don't get destroy
[1:28:49] yourself because you're in dark chaos
[1:28:52] take hope
[1:28:54] that this power of the Resurrection is
[1:28:58] going to transform you from whatever
[1:29:01] weakness you're in to
[1:29:04] Victory and he says don't stumble at the
[1:29:07] word predestination let's just go down
[1:29:10] and read a few more things because like
[1:29:13] your parents see CU you was it was in
[1:29:15] you to begin with and if you are a son
[1:29:20] of God his attribute which you are an
[1:29:23] attribute of of your father not your
[1:29:25] mother your father The Germ lays in your
[1:29:29] father see and now your mother was an
[1:29:33] incubator that bear you but the seed was
[1:29:38] in your father and the Earth is flesh is
[1:29:43] also an incubator that bears the seeds
[1:29:45] of God see exactly not the world how
[1:29:49] great the world is it's how great the
[1:29:52] god that made it is is see now listen to
[1:29:56] this you've got to Anchor I've got to
[1:29:58] anchor on this I'm just trying to
[1:30:00] encourage myself the scripture says
[1:30:02] encourage yourself in the Lord right now
[1:30:06] if you're a son and daughter of God then
[1:30:10] you were in God at the
[1:30:20] beginning
[1:30:22] right your his
[1:30:25] attribute if you wasn't there then then
[1:30:29] you'll never was or never will
[1:30:37] be why try to make your way in there
[1:30:41] settle the
[1:30:44] question I believe the word I believe
[1:30:47] what I heard he
[1:30:49] said I was in
[1:30:51] him now I look in the mirror there's no
[1:30:54] evidence of that because it's just
[1:30:59] Earth but I'm going to take that word
[1:31:04] I'm going to eat the
[1:31:05] book I'm going to take the
[1:31:09] promises I'm going to accept everything
[1:31:11] that he
[1:31:12] says and it's going to start changing me
[1:31:17] and transforming me from Darkness to
[1:31:21] light
[1:31:25] he's going to move on me but if you get
[1:31:28] your mind keeping looking at yourself
[1:31:30] and looking at your failers and working
[1:31:33] you'll work yourself to
[1:31:37] death what do you do when you do
[1:31:39] something wrong ABA father I'm
[1:31:43] sorry and he throws it in the sea of
[1:31:46] God's forgetfulness to be remember no
[1:31:51] more but don't worry
[1:31:54] you say you're going to be judged in
[1:31:55] your present condition my present
[1:31:58] condition was in him before the
[1:32:01] foundation of the beginning of the world
[1:32:04] because it's a
[1:32:06] promise he said it I didn't he knew what
[1:32:09] his thoughts of us were and so he just
[1:32:12] comes down he just keeps he just keeps
[1:32:16] uh just going Sons and Daughters of God
[1:32:19] at the beginning you've got eternal life
[1:32:22] you say
[1:32:24] we believe it that we got eternal life
[1:32:28] well there's only one form of eternal
[1:32:30] life and that's God that's the only
[1:32:35] thing that is eternal is God then if
[1:32:40] you've got eternal life that life that's
[1:32:45] in you always was and you were in the
[1:32:51] loins of God before there even was a
[1:33:01] world where's your
[1:33:03] Victory your Victory is in that
[1:33:07] statement Faith cometh by hearing
[1:33:11] hearing by the word of God when I can
[1:33:15] approach the Satan when I can approach
[1:33:18] my life when I can approach my
[1:33:20] shortcomings saying wait a minute I have
[1:33:23] eternal life he who is in me is greater
[1:33:28] than he who is in the world I can win
[1:33:31] this challenge I can defeat this devil I
[1:33:34] can overcome this because of what and
[1:33:37] who that he said that I am if you're
[1:33:41] still looking at
[1:33:44] yourself where were you when the Sons
[1:33:47] and Daughters of God shouted for
[1:33:51] Joy now you're starting to see the
[1:33:54] secrets the secrets to loving one
[1:33:56] another the secrets to uh being be able
[1:34:00] to forgive one another because you
[1:34:03] understand wait a minute God's not going
[1:34:05] to leave one of these seeds ungrown he's
[1:34:08] going to harvest every single one of
[1:34:10] them it could be your Baptist brother it
[1:34:12] could be your Methodist person it could
[1:34:14] be it doesn't matter to you because you
[1:34:17] know none of that's all that is just a
[1:34:21] lie
[1:34:24] but you know that that Eternal Word of
[1:34:27] God will come to pass we'll just close
[1:34:30] with with some of these great
[1:34:32] things he
[1:34:34] said if you got it well and when the
[1:34:38] word itself Jesus himself is called the
[1:34:41] word in St John he said in the beginning
[1:34:44] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:34:47] and the words was God and the Word was
[1:34:50] made flesh and dwelt among us then you
[1:34:53] were in his loins of Jesus and you went
[1:34:57] to Calvary with them you died with him
[1:35:00] you raised with him and today we're
[1:35:02] sitting in Heavenly places in him filled
[1:35:06] with his Spirit Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:08] God died with him raised with him
[1:35:12] sure and now you can actually take that
[1:35:15] statement and throw yourself in the
[1:35:17] total
[1:35:20] negativity when were we there
[1:35:26] you we've got to go back to our Eternal
[1:35:32] self and realize that we're not of this
[1:35:35] world we're in this world we came down
[1:35:39] in this fleshly body and we're going to
[1:35:41] overcome this flesh Body by his
[1:35:45] transforming
[1:35:47] power and then we there
[1:35:50] just we you know we're just
[1:35:54] and then he goes oh my the Deep
[1:35:55] mysteries of God in paragraph 237 you
[1:36:00] being flesh and him being flesh then you
[1:36:03] can have Fellowship one with another
[1:36:06] because he was God's attributes of love
[1:36:09] God is love is that right and Jesus was
[1:36:12] God's attribute of love and when the
[1:36:15] attribute of love was displayed which
[1:36:18] was God himself all the attributes that
[1:36:22] hung unto him come to him all the father
[1:36:28] hath given me will come to me all the
[1:36:33] attributes that hung to him will come to
[1:36:38] him can you imagine if we could start
[1:36:42] approaching life tomorrow morning get
[1:36:44] out of bed and say I'm an attribute of
[1:36:47] God I have eternal
[1:36:52] life God gave it to
[1:36:54] me and I'm here to be
[1:36:57] transformed I'm here to
[1:36:59] overcome I'm here to bring this flesh
[1:37:02] into subjection by his grace by his
[1:37:05] Mercy by his power by his life Satan
[1:37:10] he's going to defeat
[1:37:13] you he's got he's he he has me in the
[1:37:17] palm of his hand and nothing can pluck
[1:37:21] me out
[1:37:24] and you you'll quit beating
[1:37:26] yourself and when you have a weakness
[1:37:29] you won't beat yourself over it you'll
[1:37:32] go to him and see the word of God come
[1:37:35] to pass because he'll transform you from
[1:37:38] what you are to what he wants to be and
[1:37:42] you'll see the light and the
[1:37:43] transforming of go power of God just
[1:37:46] grow and grow in your life
[1:37:50] and and he says and with his
[1:37:53] transforming power planted by a seed by
[1:37:57] predestination and I saw it who whose
[1:38:02] son am I
[1:38:05] now that was in paragraph 240 but
[1:38:08] brother there's only one thing I can
[1:38:09] brag on I can brag on my Lord Jesus
[1:38:12] Christ who has redeemed
[1:38:15] me and with his transforming
[1:38:18] power planted a seed by predestination
[1:38:23] and I saw
[1:38:27] it did you see the message right who son
[1:38:31] am I now
[1:38:34] then whose son am I I
[1:38:37] now I saw this so quit the
[1:38:42] battle quit being halted between two
[1:38:45] opinions quit dragging yourself down
[1:38:48] make a stand this day who are
[1:38:51] you who are
[1:38:54] you and and and draw on the Eternal
[1:38:58] transforming power of predestination to
[1:39:02] give you the victory over everything in
[1:39:05] your life because he wants to make you V
[1:39:08] Victorious True predestinate Believers
[1:39:10] will stay with the word of God because
[1:39:13] they're a part of the
[1:39:15] word he is longing for you he wants to
[1:39:20] transform you by the renew in of your
[1:39:24] mind not to the church or to the
[1:39:28] denomination but to his word which you

[1:39:39] transform

[1:40:02] it he's going to do
[1:40:04] it I heard it I believe it I accept it
[1:40:09] he's going to do

[1:41:05] to change you right
[1:41:07] into a
[1:41:10] Rapture amen I I love it you know God
[1:41:14] sent his transforming power to fulfill
[1:41:17] his word and change the whole body of
[1:41:20] Sarah and Abraham and we could just go
[1:41:23] on and and he then he begs us to come
[1:41:26] back to the word uh uh that's what we
[1:41:30] are he says he says that word has to
[1:41:34] come to pass it's God's word planted it
[1:41:39] in your
[1:41:41] heart if you want to go into the Rapture
[1:41:45] if you want to be a
[1:41:47] Christian genuine part of his word as I
[1:41:51] believe as Ezekiel God said take the
[1:41:55] scroll and eat it up and the prophet and
[1:41:59] the said the word would become the
[1:42:04] same and every promise in there has to
[1:42:09] manifest itself because it's God's
[1:42:12] original seed don't let education
[1:42:15] theology out here try to pump it out of
[1:42:20] you don't let him spray you
[1:42:23] with that carnal science of knowledge
[1:42:26] and
[1:42:28] education
[1:42:29] believe God can you believe what God
[1:42:36] said
[1:42:38] that if you have eternal life you always
[1:42:41] had eternal life you were always there
[1:42:44] you know how different that makes
[1:42:47] you how how
[1:42:49] absolute what Fountain of every ever
[1:42:53] lasting power you have to change things
[1:42:58] if you're faithful and little you'll be
[1:43:01] faithful in much if we can start
[1:43:03] changing it's no telling what he can
[1:43:06] bring our hearts and our minds to to see
[1:43:10] the Miracles that God can do for them
[1:43:13] that believe on him amen God bless you
[1:43:17] let's stand
[1:43:24] oh my God's word so good amen I I I need
[1:43:28] a little prayer request if you could
[1:43:31] pray with me so as as you know uh mom
[1:43:35] passed away and we're trying to sell her
[1:43:37] house well uh we went out there and we
[1:43:41] found a buyer and we wrote up all the
[1:43:43] deal and everything set ready to go and
[1:43:46] now we lost
[1:43:48] the we lost the trust
[1:43:53] well we can't find the
[1:43:56] documents that say that we are who we
[1:43:59] are
[1:44:01] so nobody we can't prove that the house
[1:44:04] is ours we can't prove that we can sell
[1:44:08] it we can't we can't you know say here
[1:44:13] it is you know this is who's supposed to
[1:44:17] sign
[1:44:19] so you know it's kind of like the book
[1:44:22] being sealed up you know what I mean so
[1:44:25] we need the Lord to help us find th
[1:44:29] those
[1:44:30] papers
[1:44:32] um anyway so I won't even begin to think
[1:44:37] of all the internal struggle I'm having
[1:44:40] over those papers not being found but
[1:44:43] anyway it just we but God can God can
[1:44:47] knows where they are do you believe that
[1:44:49] amen so we just trust that he makes a
[1:44:52] way and is merciful and that uh we can
[1:44:56] put this all behind us and see which way
[1:44:59] that God wants to take us so we
[1:45:02] certainly love the Lord let's bow our
[1:45:05] hearts and the Lord as brother Billy
[1:45:07] comes to lead us in a closing prayer and
[1:45:11] worship our heavenly father we heard it
[1:45:14] as plain as could be plain
[1:45:17] tonight about where we
[1:45:20] were and Who We Are
[1:45:24] and the
[1:45:26] power that that
[1:45:30] carries to change us from the
[1:45:34] chaos that we're
[1:45:40] in and I believe the Cry of your spirit
[1:45:43] to every believer is who wants to enter
[1:45:48] in to the
[1:45:50] trans formation
[1:45:56] who wants to become a part of
[1:46:00] it he's not transforming a church as a
[1:46:05] group though we come together to hear
[1:46:08] the word of God and fellowship one
[1:46:10] another and pray one for another and
[1:46:14] help one another's burdens that's the
[1:46:16] love of God shed abroad in our heart by
[1:46:19] the Holy Spirit
[1:46:23] we know it's not the rain because the
[1:46:25] Same Spirit brings the good seed and
[1:46:30] brings the evil
[1:46:35] seed but Lord we look deep on the
[1:46:39] inside and we say Lord I want to be a
[1:46:43] part of the transformation that's
[1:46:47] transpiring right
[1:46:49] now you said it was going on now
[1:46:54] Lord You're making the change that
[1:46:56] seed's coming to maturity it's coming to
[1:47:00] harvest Lord and I want to just I don't
[1:47:03] want it to be in my mind I want it to
[1:47:05] come in and take over my whole body my
[1:47:07] whole flesh my whole Spirit my whole
[1:47:11] soul and I wanted to start working
[1:47:13] changes in my thinking changes in my
[1:47:17] heart changes in my
[1:47:20] spirit I just want to move up to that
[1:47:23] rapturing
[1:47:25] condition Lord I want to enter in and I
[1:47:28] believe that that just your spirit's
[1:47:32] been leading us this way and we hearing
[1:47:35] the voice of your Prophet Lord I just
[1:47:38] hope it settles into the heart so that
[1:47:41] every believer
[1:47:44] here can say I believe what God said
[1:47:49] about
[1:47:50] me I don't see evidence of it in my
[1:47:53] flesh all the
[1:47:55] time but my spirit Bears witness because
[1:48:00] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:48:04] the word and I heard the word and Faith
[1:48:08] brings every promise to pass I ask that
[1:48:12] you bless it to the people tonight in
