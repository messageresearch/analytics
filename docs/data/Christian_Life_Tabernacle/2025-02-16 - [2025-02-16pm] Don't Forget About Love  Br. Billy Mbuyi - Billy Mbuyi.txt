Description:
Sunday Evening Service
February 16th, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

the word of God to just speak few words tonight may you help us Lord because we count on you in everything that we do we love you and ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you welcome you back in the house of God Amen let's open our Bibles and amen let let's open to 1 Corinthians uh chapter 13 a very familiar scripture [Music] reading man did you enjoy the word this morning amen I trust that the Lord spoke to you I was telling the brothers in the back I said uh you already have your lunch so this is just going to be a dessert tonight so lower your expectations 1 Corinthians 13 uh let's read verse one it says though I speak with tongues of men and Angel and have no charity I'm become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and knowledge and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could move Mountain I have not I have not charity I have I'm nothing now I want you to realize this just struck me as I was looking at it so he's saying that even though I have faith so that I could move mountains so there could be a faith that I can actually move the mountains but if it's not connected to charity it's nothing and then it says though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and I have I have my body to be burned and I have not charity it profited no me nothing now now this one is even striking because now is even saying that you can feed the poor you can feed the hungry you can take your body as a sacrifice it's still not connected to charity charity suffers long and now it's giving you the definition of what charity is talking about so he gives you the definition of what man thinks charity is what men would think charity is what love is the according to mankind according to men's definition to be to give yourself to do all of this to feed the poor now he's giving you what the true charity definition is Charity suffers long suffer long and is kind charity Envy not charity vaed not itself and is not puffed up do not uh do not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not our own glory is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity Rejoice but rejoiceth in truth beareth not beareth all things believe all things hoping on all things endureth all things charity never fail but where it says but whether there is there be prophecy they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall it shall vanish away but now it says but we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with when I see when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I taught as a child then when I become a man I put away childish things it says for we for for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I knowing part but then shall know as I shall know even as I am known it says and now abideth faith hope charity these three it says but the greatest of these is Charity gracious father we ask you bless you to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you may have your seats amen we we certainly enjoy the word this morning and I like I said I'll try to be very short in fact I believe if I just stop here it'll be good right like brother Matthew said it's extremely tempting um but I I believe that you came for a little more than that amen and we'll just try to add to it we we believe as we heard this morning that we thank God for the revealing of the word um and I'll just try to just Pace myself so I don't take too much time we thank God for predestination we we thank God for the end time manifestation of Jesus Christ and and I want to say we can the the word the revealed word of God to the believer it gives us the boldness to come before the Throne of God and to know that the promise belonged to us as we heard it this morning we the the word and the revealing of the hour is for you you you don't have to be ashamed of it you don't have to come and wondering is God going to give me is he going to chase me is he going to love me what is he going to do no it's the promise for the hour we can come as we heard this this morning whatever we have need of the word of God has been made available so we can go in and take what belongs to us it's been given to us by predestination not because of our goodness not because of what we have done or what we could do no it's been given to us by predestination God elected and chose us so we could be partakers of his divine nature we didn't ask for it we didn't come and cry out for it no he chose us now remember there are people that are more sincere than we are there are people that are a lot better than we are they are good they are they can they have all of these things they people are that some people are born patient you see them and you can scream at them they just look at you and you know and you wonder oh my I wish I could have that you know so but it's not even given for that this is the patience that comes by the word of God so he he he elected us he made us what we are and and we can come with boldness and know that these things are mine we I love what our brother said it's like we we are not afraid to come but whatam says we have been given the seven Coast meal we can come at the table and not wonder if you ever gone to a uh you know I was thinking the best I could think of is uh like a a dinner for work you know you show up at the restaurant everything is paid off you know you don't have to pay for anything you know what you do you go to the menu you find what is the highest price you you try the frag that you never ate before you know you you take the tomahawk you know you're not going to finish it it's paid for and and the promises of God are paid for for you you don't have to pay for it just come and eat at the T at the table and yet we are you know we like oh is this mine am I really deliver am I really healed it's yours it's been paid for show up and eat than Lord you know if if if you're not healed you're not eating enough just go and eat and eat and eat brother Ram says it's like that seed what says when the seed is put in the ground the only thing the farmer has to do is just continue to pour water continue to pour water but it's the seed responsibility to continue to drink of that water it will drink it will sayam says one place that he has to drink more than its own portion and when he drinks one time what's going to happen is the seed is going to burst forth and produce what the promise was so my advice to you is continue to eat continue to ask ask for things that are impossible continue to ask for things that you couldn't pay for things that you couldn't afford why because he already paid for you you just come and enjoy it we can stop right there but we'll just take St so I'll be measuring every step and if I feel like that's it we'll just stop I yeah so I I was thinking about this and and as we read remember this is in the book of Corinthians and we we know uh my we could just go so long um but when I'm will will talk and and and and here he says he speaks about charity being the greatest of all of them but if you go just if we could take a step back you know that bam will talk about even uh the book of Corinthians we understand it's the book of Correction so he he would talk about the difference between the Church of Corinthians and the Church of Ephesian the difference in the things that he found out so I'll just go quickly I I try to just uh uh uh put everything together so I don't have to preach longer I I realize when I talk I talk longer than when I look in my notes so so I'm trying to be really close really really so he talk about if you read the book of Corinthians one of the things some of the things you'll find out is that Paul was addressing is that were there were more uh uh giv into the gifts and and there was more issues with the Corinthian Church than there was with the Ephesians so if you go look butam says what Paul had to deal with them was not he there was nothing like that find found in the uh in the the Ephesian Church age so you will go you'll find out that there were division in the church some will say they were for Paul and some Apollo some and sephus so they had those people were divided in who they were following it's 1 Corinthians 1:10 to7 there was uh uh there was in them found that some sexual IM immorality issues that Paul had to address and lawsuit among brothers and and and even in regarding to marriage and and and singleness they had issues in the understanding of all those things and abuse of the spiritual gift and even the the the disorder in the church that they you know they were come and they didn't know how to place the gift in order there was confusion if about the understanding of the doctrine of Resurrection I I could I could give you a reference to all of this but I'm trying to go really quick but to find out that Paul will describe the Ephesian Church to be a solid church that they were more a little more established that that that he would come to them the things that he will speak to the Ephesians those things he couldn't speak to the Corinthians because there were still babes they still needed milk and he still didn't need to correct them every time every once he came his job was to put back in line and everything but when he came to the Ephesians Oh my he could speak to them with spiritual things and he will talk to them about predestination and unity in the body and the mystery of Christ and he will talk to them about the election and the calling of the church and spiritual warfare and strength and and living out the Christian Life by the new man so you can go and read you will find all of those things that Paul he's addressing and is's taking those churches and and is bringing those things and trying to position them but the goal was now I want you now to realize it was not necessarily and we read it somewhere it's not necessarily that it was uh rebuking them so they can stay in that state Paul desire was so that if you were in the Corinthian Church that you receive the word of God and move through the Ephesian church so when the word of God is preached and you find yourself lacking it's not so God can continually call you Corinthian Corin Corin no it's so that somewhere somehow in the middle you will receive the word of God and move from the Corinthian into the Ephesian church because with the Ephesian church it was the positioning of the believer there were those that knew where they came from there were those that God will take and bring into adoption now we understand the prophet will say that the Ephesian church is the type of Joshua we have been given in inheritance and by Christ dying and we know that we have been made partakers of divine nature and Joshua is the type of the of the Holy Spirit we believe we are living in a time where the holy spirit is here to positionally place a Believer and if you find yourself with Corinthian characteristics do not be discouraged that same word that's preached to you you are not positioning yourself but it's the word that's positioning you God by his word to say this that this is so comforting for a Believer I I that's why I say this morning as a Believer there's nothing that we need to be ashamed of or there's nothing that we need to look and look down upon ourselves why because it's the very word that you are hearing that's the word that will produce what God is requiring because when God send his word the Holy Spirit has to come and testify of what you are hearing so it can take you from where you are into what God is calling for the the the the trouble we have as humans is we try to apply the word to our flesh and then we run into conflict we don't see it happen and we keep beating our heads no what we need is to apply the word to the soul and let the soul be strengthened so the soul will have the power to overcome the Flesh and take it for the Corinthian into the Ephesian so we find ourselves yeah and I say and and then I said and so we move he's wanting to move us and I want to say this God oh I thought God is so wonderful because even as he's giving his word what God is looking for is to take a Believer and move him from where you are into the place that he has for you I talk about it there a scripture says God is a husbandman he will come and you know people will look a tree and and look at it and said this tree is as good as that you got to cut it down and and they they will look at the tree and see all that's wrong with the tree they'll see everything it hasn't been producing fruits the leaves are dried and all of this they said and then all they looking for is for the tree to be cut down but it takes a husband man to come and say I know you want to cut it down but give me time let me work with this tree and show you the potential that's within the tree let me say you man is not given to see the potential within one another man is not given to see the potential of God but it takes the word of God to see the potential that's within you and and I tell you this the worse it is the more the husband man knows he can it can bring it to come to pass I I tell you God loves the worst like the the the outcast the no good good they rejected oh I tell you I I remember but when I'm speaking about the meeting in Mexico and everything he said they come the general said oh you know they came and they called the people when when the the first crowd came in it was a bunch of welld dressed up people educated and everything but when his turn came it was a bunch of wheelchairs and all of those cast out some coming from hospitals and everywhere that's the people of God why because they are a people with a need within their hearts and they are theread with a real need and know that God is going to answer to the need I said I wasn't going to preach so the brother speaks about these two churches and they said I don't remember what message it is you could find it there it says now it says notice now if you'll notice in the book of Corinthian and he says of what Paul had with this Corinthian it says they were all seeking out after different blessings all spiritual gifts and Paul had to speak to them as to children so the word of God can come and speak to you as a child wonderful he trying to help you it's not casting you out it's trying what the manner of speech is is what comes to you so you could receive it in the place that you are and he says but when he came to the Ephesian church he spake to them in a different way the Church of Ephesus they are a solid Gospel Church it says now he's speaking here of what God did before the foundation of the world who's that the Ephesian church now we just can't come and every day preach about the foundation of the world we got to find out and help the Corinthians and let me put and myself there's some Corinthian in each and every one of us that needs to be addressed and it's not that it's there to be addressed so you can say oh who is me no it's addressed so that part can receive the word and move over progress go a little bit further move up go up into what God is looking for in the church order uh pre uh preach uh preached in 63 December 26 it says now some time ago it says when the order was set the church I do it says I do believe in speaking in T and interpretation and all fine spiritual gift that were ordained of God in the church but we are living in the day like it was in the Bible where Church it says where the church is now you'll notice that he founded the Church of Ephesus and the ephes the Ephesian Church which was a wellestablished church did you notice it says we we believe that Paul uh did say so himself that he spake in many tongues Paul himself and we know that he had the gift of tongue not one that I had learned but those who were Spirit those who were spiritually given to him because of how because of how he's uh he's speaking in the Corinthians here to save time it says let me jump uh paragraph 18 it says now Paul never one time had to speak to the Ephesian church or the Roman church or any of those other churches about their spiritual gift about how they put them in order but he did but but he did have to speak to the Corinthian continually about it because they made it they they made it an issue all the time and Paul said when he come among them if they found out if one had a tongue and other had a PSAL and he thank the Lord uh for uh for all the fine gifts and things like that and if you'll notice in the first chapter or two Paul was telling them positionally positionally when they were in the uh what they were in Christ it says they were positionally in Christ then after he told them I like this then like a father he began to whip them down to whip them down and say I hear there's uh cont uh contentions among you and I hear that you get drunk on the Lord's Supper on the Lord's table he he didn't unch christianize them and don't you brother do that and christianize them but it's the way that they are they are behaving themselves in the house of God listen to this that's where they at it's at so just because you come and and and you see someone falling short it it it doesn't mean that I'm no longer a Christian what what what is important because I want to say this the importance of the love in the Christian Life can never beas overemphasized now I didn't give my title my my title is uh don't forget about love don't forget about love the love ingredient is the is one of the most important ingredient in Christian life don't forget about it so the importance of the love of God in the Christian Life can never be o overemphasized i I want to say this it starts with love it ends with love if you take love out of it it will never achieve the goal it starts if you can ever help anybody it has to be by love if you can ever do something for God it has to be by love I love my brother Matthew was getting there even this morning you heard him just go I told him I'll just pick up where you left off so it's it's it but whatam says one place he says the trouble with people with trouble with preachers is we have taken the word of God and made it a bunch of rules and regulations where we we come to church and all say you got to dress like this you got to talk like this you got do like this and if you fit the criteria that means you are a Christian no you are not it was never about that it was never about obeying rules let me say this you can obey all the rules you want if it's not by love he will not produce it the the Christian walk this Bible is a book of love story it's when you read it it's about a loving God who the loving saor who came and he gave his life for you let me say this what changes you is the understanding that there was one who died for you before you even know it love conquers all he says love never fail if you do it by anything else that's why he was talking to the Corinthians the problem was not to give the problem is if one came and he did something oh people regarded him as the greatest oh that one spoke in tongue God must be with him and this one did this oh that now they they will follow that one today follow this one today they didn't know what to do what they failed to realize it it had nothing to do with all the time it was the word that was given to them so the the the the we have to it will not profit much if it's not by love the body of Christ or the church but says is the sickest body I know and and but I want to say this it's the sickest body I know but God is given the remedy to to to heal the sickness he's not left us alone just sick he's given us the word and love so we can heal our sicknesses butam says in the message uh the perfect faith and and and and perfect faith he talks about it and and let me just say this this is the foundation of why you would call yourself a Christian perfect faith and it says in paragraph 132 it says where when you were a sinner alienated without God in the world in the mark and and it says in the mark and I talked about it this morning God came to us when you were sick in the mark let me say this sickness is a disease let me say this everything that you were it was a disease he says that when you were in sin you were a sinner aliened without god without God in the world in the m and in the mud it says I talked about it this morning God came to us God sought you you didn't come to God and say oh God I'm sick help me no God came to you that let me say this if God didn't come to you you would not love him the way you love you're supposed to love him let me say this I I wanted one of the titles I was going to give this morning uh tonight was the Forgotten testimony we we forget what our testimony is our testimony is it's the love of God that did all of this for us it was never because we merited it it's his love that did us let me say this at the end the celebration is going to be about love not about our efforts and the requirement is the same love that's been given to you you extend it we we don't God they heal the seek a heal it's not so God can vindicate you you understand and let me say this if it's done by anything outside of love it's not going to work it's only going to be a man boasting himself that's why you hear oh I heal the sick over there I raise the dead over here he only piling Glory but the prophet who brought the very message it will constantly tell you men cannot heal healing is not a man's ability healing is only God himself that can heal all glory goes back to him and I love even as our pastor was preaching all of that I found it in this message you're talking about he was said in Mexico he said this man came and he was there it talks about Pano and all the difficulties of life that they would go through and everything it says I looked at him he didn't even have the right kind of clothes I said can I give him my suit can I love is being projected and love when love was projected healing has to show up it's not by frustration it's not by I'm going to prove the devil I'm a Son of God it's not going to work you know sometimes we we we feel like oh we are the the manifested son we're going to go and raise people out from the grave and and no if there's no love projected all of that is is men trying to project and show what they can do so he says God came to us it says God sought you you never sought God man it says no man can come to me except the father draw him first God God came down in the mark that you were and he sought you and he bought you it says that ought to create a perfect love oh my brother my sister the love that we have as a that's why let me say this the love that I'm talking about you can never receive it until you are born again it it's not an intellectual love that that's why when when Paul is talking about this let me say this Elon Musk can feed the the the more better than I can what's the Microsoft guy Bill Gates he can feed the poor he does it that they do a bunch of donation and that's what Paul is talking you can take your body and be Let It Be burned that that's what it says but this love that I'm talking about can only come by the new birth love to the the love to be patient with one another the love when somebody gets on your nerves you just love them the love when you see something wrong you see something continually wrong you pray so God can move you know it's easier to love somebody when you are not with them every day right but when they contact they become more contact and and and and the things is just continually you look at them you're just about to lose your mind that's when you have to love them now that's the true Christian love it it's not it's not a love that oh if it's not done my way I don't want it no it's the love butam speaks one place it talks about the Tabernacle it said you know the brothers came together he didn't want something and they came together and they decided that they wanted to do it you know what he did he said if you guys voted and everybody wanted to do it I'm joining that's the love I'm talking about it's not oh it has to be everybody has an opinion I is supposed to work if it's not done my way I don't want to be part of it no it's the love that knows we have the same goal the same objective we going to the same place therefore no matter what decision is made I'm behind it we'll continue another time that's why the prophet could say if he sends me to hell now you do that's not mental love that's not human love that's not filo that's agap love that's when that's when you're talking when you get to that place then we can talk why because it's the love to know that I love him regardless I know whatever he will give me he'll give me the best whatever if he wants me in hell that's the place I want to be we we're not Christians because we are scared to go to hell that decision is already made am we are Christians because there's something beating within our hearts we want to serve God we want to see other saved we want to see other touched and only when we have that same heartbeat that's when it will produce the same result if we do it because I'm a preacher I want everybody to know I'm a preacher or I'm a deacon or I'm this and it's only going to produce a preacher result a deacon result whatever other result it is and it's only going to be temporary the scripture says God so loved the world andam says he's the very essence of Love he's the Fountain of many color so when he created you he didn't create you so he can see if he can create it was the love of God butam says one place he says when the love of God was projected It produced Jesus Christ right so if you Pro if you project the same love it will produce Jesus Christ and I love what our brother said this morning it's the same son of man it's not a different one that's why he could say that if the same word is received the same way is applied the same way it will produce the same son of man again we'll continue another if the musician could come I'm sorry I we'll continue another time I know I know what I'm I I I could just go on and go on but and it says it says Thou ought to create perfect love if you can put it back up there look what you was look what you are what did it somebody that loved you somebody that loved you not somebody that hated you not somebody that looked with you with Strife not somebody that looked at you said how long until you get it no it's somebody that loved you and let me say this one of the characteristics will'll get to it another time of Love is patience the ability to just pray continually until it happens love never gives up listen it says when it says Love Never Fails Love Never Fails if you ever feel yourself tired of either praying for somebody or for something watch what love did you go by it could be your emotions you got all emotional and you feel like oh I want to get this done but Let It Drop and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that Let It Drop from filo into your G love you will see the result before it even happened because you know that when I ask you know that I will stay here you'll say like that man says you will find my bones here when you come back because it's in my heart so you can do it it's love that does it but when I'm praying for people they didn't even know you pray and and you will pray and you will go it's the love of God that went and heal those people people he didn't come and say I'm going to prove to you that I'm a prophet no it was by the love of God shed in his heart it says you can't have faith in in what he promised you you it says it says can't you have faith in what he promised you then it says real genuine love will create a confidence in his word that's what I'm looking for I want confidence in his word he says he caught me when when I was nothing I'm still nothing it says it says but but I'm in his hand see he caught me he loved me when I was unlovable let me say this love goes around he's looking for the worst you see somebody with purple hair with tattoos and they look like they're good for nothing I want you to think about the love of God the love of God is looking let me let me just talk about myself I didn't like preachers I wasn't a church person I I came to church and and all of this excitement I wasn't part of it I came and church was over and put my Bible and went home and do my did my business God came in he says you the hate preachers I'm going to come and make you one of them I said no it's not happening but look at me where I am today what did it it's the love of God I I I I didn't grow up say I'm going to be a preacher one day no it wasn't in my perview in fact I quit every time after preaching what did it the love of God it's the love of God he came and you look at it you're like my my my look at what the love of God could do and I want to say this it's just not me everyone sitting here this tonight it's the manifestation of the love of God you were what you were by his grace by his love let's all stand I'm sorry I'll just keep going and going amen we'll pick it up another time we we had a wonderful service this morning and I just don't want to I told the brothers I didn't want another heavy meal we had a heavy meal this morning and I'll just give dessert on top amen do you love God tonight is that your heart desire that It Be by love when when you see you don't let even in your own home I was talking about Matthew he just mentioned something that just touch my heart it's so true it's like having a child you know that that kid can shoot somebody and you're not going to cast them out it's your child whatever they do you're still going to love them what the there's no nothing Under the Sun they're going to do where you say you've crossed the line you're no longer my child whatever they can come and say Oh Daddy this happened guess what we're ready to go to battle whatever it is let's go figure out how we're going to fix it and brother and the scripture says that if you you that are Earthly your son will ask you for a bread you will not give him a stone or there will ask for a fish you will not give him a snake how much more your heavenly father it's a love affair if you can only sprinkle the ingredients of love in it you will it will help you understand what God is looking out of us a lot better the reason we don't understand is because we make it intellectual we make it let me say this love you can talk all about love that you want until you feel it until you experience it then you will know what love is and God wants us to experience what divine love is what his love towards us is our gracious father we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy father God it's just such a a desire Lord in our hearts to serve you and to serve you right and we ask father that you just help us in our modal being and father sometimes I feel like one day we are in the Corinthian Church ages and the next day we are the phion and then we drop back in the Corinthians and then we go back to the Ephesians Lord help our unbelief help our in consistency and help all the doubting and all the shcking and father Place us on the Solid Ground of Revelation that will never change and that will be never moved help us be solid Believers that will come and know our place and Lord at least we will put that behind and serve you with everything that we have and know that our heavenly father cares about us help us Lord those that couldn't be here Lord I pray that you you just reveal the Love by which they were saved in their hearts and help their circumstances and their situations Lord that they may come to know you even more Lord and Lord that all of us together may come together as one body and serve you the best that we can that we May Lord I believe with all my heart that we we together just the way we are buil we can produce something that no other church can produce we are so uniquely built for such a unique purpose Lord and I pray that you just bring us
