above all we ask that this great love you have for us may be shed abroad in our hearts to others we ask you to bless us this morning and help us in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated for a few moments this morning uh i'm i'm i'm done looks like the jesse james gang up here is um you guys can go thank you i don't think we're having are we having a baby dedication this morning is that still i don't see the family okay things change over the weekend i guess you guys realize that so i think we're okay if not we'll make arrangements uh um you know it uh it just seems like we're getting back on our feet and and uh the government came up with another uh you know wanting to slow things down again you know just to kind of give you my viewpoint on things and i'm certainly not afraid of this virus you know one of the great benefits we have as a congregation is that 90 you know of our congregation is under 50 years old so we're a very young congregation so we're very resilient and strong so that part of it we're very thankful for the other approach is is that as a as a a church in our country they give churches certain benefits is the best way i could say it our church owns all this property here and they don't tax us for it um we have this building and they don't tax the building they give us tax credits for monies that we give to church so the government extends to us very many benefits as being a church they want to give us beverage benefits because all in all churches help the community they teach to buy the laws they teach to be safe they teach to love one another to not steal not kill not murder and so there's social benefits to uh a church and for that reason they extend to us a lot of benefits if you are a tax accountant you would understand the number of benefits that the church receives as a minister i'm able to receive certain benefits from the government also so i just think that in a way of and i think it's only fair that when they ask us to do something after extending to us so many benefits that we don't stand up and be rebellious like it's owed to us you know so uh that's why when they asked we went ahead and extended uh that we would go ahead and do our best to comply this time they're saying for july well i don't know how good that virus does in 110 degree temperature but you know i mean we could turn off the air and kill that thing in a minute you know what i mean so but anyway so that's just um our approach and we do have streaming now so those of you who are listening and watching at home we hope that you feel a part of us and so they've asked certain things and they've asked that we would wear masks outside wearing masks inside is optional but so when you go outside we have mass there like i said we have gloves if you're worried about touching something just slip on a glove and the and that'll make you feel safer or if you feel you've touched something then there's always hand sanitizer that you can put on maybe you can carry a little bit with you and then we just do all that we can do because we want to be good neighbors in our community so we'll get through this we're going to have it's going to cause a lot of trouble i'm glad that we're in summer we don't have to worry about sunday school but we're working on all the things that we need to accommodate us not only now under this uh executive order from our governor but in the future and in our new building if the lord jesus would so provide to us a new sanctuary would be a larger than this it would hold more people than this twice as many people and has a lot of room for expansion but we're trying to put into all that all the things that will make going to church easier where you're sitting now this part of the church will be turned into sunday school rooms and i don't know probably from about where brother wade is sitting right back here all the rest of this will all be taken out and turned into a fellowship area so by god's grace we have plans and vision we can't do it in the flesh but god can do it by his spirit and his might so we just ask you to bear with us join with us those of you are at home we're working as hard as we can to provide a place for you in the sanctuary it seems like we have a little more room today we could have added a few more people but anyway let's just be patient and do our due diligence and and you know we're supposed to let the love of god be shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit that goes for people that don't love you amen oh let's stand this morning let's read a couple scriptures and we're just going to have a time of fellowship and talking a little bit and uh uh this uh little thought i want to bring is kind of uh um you know just stir us up and to and so i kind of wrote a note down as if your part in the plan of god your part in the plan of god or if i could also say that god had a a role for you to play and uh in the message that we're referring to is up you know as out of the message the unveiling of god and so let's turn to two scriptures this morning and then we will read uh several other scriptures and so let's turn into the gospel of john uh the gospel of john chapter one starting with verse one and um so one of the young girls in church young lady i think she's 12 or so she said every time brother david calls for scripture he reads it before i can find it in my bible so everybody find your uh bible scripture we're going to read the first verse of the first chapter of saint john and then we're going to read the uh 14th verse and i know all of you that are spiritual can figure out this sermon from these two scriptures um a lot of times when brother brennan would minister he'd read a scripture and then he'd preach a sermon and i never could tie it back to the scripture but he he had that ability to take a scripture and expand on it beyond any realm that i ever thought that that scripture was in but that so these scriptures will be very obvious to you but let's read this in saint john that first chapter and the first verse in the beginning was the word and in genesis it says in the beginning was god now john comes back and says in the beginning was the word so now he's in his great spiritual wisdom he's not going to contradict genesis but he's going to show us how genesis 1 unveiled okay so how that genesis one in the beginning god how that we now have been able to make contact with that god in the beginning was the word and the word was god and and in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god so in the beginning was the word and the word was god amen and in john 14 the same chapter in the 14th verse it says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth god bless you you may be seated uh we fellowshipped last week a little bit as were on this subject of the unveiling of god and we we talked about manifestation and what manifestation meant was to make something clear and obvious and or or to show or display and so we understand that that was god's plan and his will one of his great three objectives was one was to uh reveal himself to make himself known and then we know another objective was to have preeminence in other words that was to be god to be worshipped of god to have preeminence so it was his desire to have a people that he had preeminence over or in other words preeminence would mean that he was the most important part of everything he designed creation to reflect himself therefore he has preeminence in creation because everything is set in order but it was his order that said it if you read the next verse down it says everything that was made was made by him and there was nothing made that was not made by him so he had the preeminence and his preeminence or his uh i don't like the only word i can come up with um you use your vocabulary because i'm cert it's certainly greater than mine was to control he he he had uh his preeminence because he was the one that controlled the order of things or made the order of things so you know i love that song who hung the stars in the sky you know who made the earth who made the sun to rise that was the preeminence of god that was doing it so he had preeminence and and so he wanted to reveal himself and and then or so we saw the the first revelation of god in the things that he created and we saw the scriptures said that the invisible things of god were made clear by the visible things that we could see so we we talked last week that god was un invisible but the invisible god wanted to show himself or manifest himself so we talked along those lines and and we took uh from that we took the subject that circumstances cause manifestation manifestation comes from circumstances so there has to be a circumstance arise in order to bring forth the manifest station and we talked about jesus at the wedding uh supper that uh he had this he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so in the fact that god dwelt in him he had creative power in him amen he possessed creative power he had the personality of god he was god in person form in flesh form so he had the personality of god and but his time wasn't yet so a circumstance arose at a wedding feast which mary's family was involved in and she didn't want no reflection on the the bride and and the bridegroom i couldn't just see that love of mary you know the concern she had for that couple how she felt for that couple how embarrassing it would be you know that and she didn't want people to draw unfair conclusions about the family you know oh they're poor or oh they didn't care isn't that terrible about human nature how we always draw such unkind conclusions that most of the time our discernment is negative you know why people do things that reason people do things there's always such a suspicion you know but perfect love casts out suspicion and so i just could feel how mary must have loved that couple how much she must have loved that family and and she wanted to spare them embarrassment and gossip and didn't want that wedding and that marriage to get started out on that foot so she went to where that she knew god was she knew this boy comes from god you'll never convince mary in any other way because she believed the word of god before there was any sign that she had a child and she said even so lord let it be done according to thy will now i'm going to share some of my personal views okay i believe mary did this for god you understand what i'm saying mary knew that she accepted the holy spirit creating a body in her womb you understand she had given herself to the hand of the lord so if i could say that if uh if you could accept my expression for that so she knew she had uh you know uh something in her pocket you know what i mean so she had done this for god now she was going to ask god to do something for her you understand she she she knew that she had given herself she bore the reproach she was willingly bore the reproach of being called whatever wicked names they would call a person that would bring forth an italian illegitimate child and she bore the rumors and everything and she bore that reproach now there came a time that the reproach she bore that she could ask a favor so she went to her son and said son they have no wine or she may have called them jesus jesus they have no wine and he said my time has not yet come it's not time for me to manifest myself it's not time for me to show to show what that i am and what my purpose here on earth is but the circumstance was there and because of the circumstance the circumstance caused jesus the manifestation of who jesus was to come forth and knowing what she had done for the father and not that she was bargaining with god but can you imagine the relationship she must have had with almighty god well this child was being formed in her womb oh can you imagine the glory and the presence of the lord that she walked in so much so that eliza this child leapt in the womb when she come into his presence i believe she knew that she could talk to the father and i i and i think that she knew and remember this now that in jesus he was the word okay so in him was ask anything of the father in my name and he will grant it so when she approached him she knew who he was and in him she knew if she asked anything of the father in his name and that's what she did son jesus i'm asking you jesus the name of the father to make this one hallelujah how many knows the wine got made amen amen so the circumstance caused things great uh reasons behind things so you you've got to understand nothing happens by chance god knows what he's doing he's got reasons to do things that we don't know and and we we don't know the beginning from the end and that's what he said he puts the he puts it the kingdom of god within a man that he doesn't know the beginning or the end so even in the midst of all this uh time in our politics time in our government time and everything god's hand is working towards his end the word of god is the final say in any matter if you want to know the final outcome the final outcome is always the word of god i i remember i i had an opportunity one year to minister at brother uh tim's in in louisiana rather tim pruitt sister julia's uncle and and the the message i ministered there someone just brought it to my attention the other day was the unseen force the unseen power and the unseen four so when david went forth to meet goliath there was an unseen power there and unseen force this i'm kind of going in this direction so you know goliath saw david what he didn't see was the unseen power or the unseen form and and and when when gideon uh went forth they they didn't see the unseen power the unseen force that was a gideon they didn't see the unseen fourth with samson so the unseen four they never could see that but yet it was there and and so we know that in the midst of everything in our lives all the conflicts all the troubles and everything that we're going through all the inconveniences and and our flesh begins to disagree with the conveniences of the disc convenience our flesh begins to argue in war against the circumstances or our flesh uh goes in and we find ourselves wanting to make a statement and but if we could sit back for a moment and understand that he that all things are in his control that all things are allowed and many things that god does we don't quite see the great purpose behind but we have to know that there's a god behind the purpose so there's an unseen force that's with us in all this there's an unseen force that's with his church there's an unseen force that will keep his congregation safe and we'll keep them together there's an unseen force that is there to to to stand on our behalf and we can't let our faith be weakened because faith is the evidence of things hoped for but not yet seen so we we know that this force is with us and you know you talk about circumstances i i thought of paul and if you just wanted to look at it with me a little bit uh we're going to read a scripture a little bit above that just a time of fellowship and bible study but go over to acts uh the 7th chapter and the 57th verse and we'll just read a few verses and how many know who paul is okay we'd all raise our hand and say we know who he is right we know that he was the first church age messenger we know that he brought the gospel to the gentiles we know that he wrote most of the new testament so we know what he is but do you ever take a moment to consider what he was because in what paul was that circumstance is what revealed what he is so let's just take that and and this is i hope this is great comfort for you that have loved ones that are maybe not doing so well or have made choices against the word of god and and there's many people who have fallen to the great cunningness of intellect and the warring of the adversary against this message in the word of god but i hope that we can take comfort in knowing that god can do all things so let's listen to this peter just got done giving him an exhortation and they said and this is and they cried out uh well let's read 56 well let's just go to 54. this is again we might as well have enjoy the scriptures amen everybody easy no service tonight uh we we can't go nowhere we can't go to restaurants we we can't go do nothing we gotta wear a mask everywhere you know it i mean bank lobbies can't open up because everybody comes in with a mask and you don't know who's a thief and who is it a thief you know what i mean and you don't know who's infected and who's not infected and you know and and you know i don't know all that stuff but i know one thing i know that nothing can pluck us out of the palm of his hand and i know that if god before you who can be against you right so i just rest in that how about that well will we just rest right there and when they heard these things they were cut that's uh acts 7 verse 54. i hear the pages rustling out on the internet all right let's go again now acts 7 verse 54 and when they heard these things they were cut to to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth but he being filled of the holy ghost looked up steadfast into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus sitting on the right hand of god and he said behold i see the heavens open and the son of man sitting on the right hand of god and they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord they just couldn't take that that just put them over the top man they i just think they thought blasphemy huh and they cast them out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was saul and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus and they stoned stephen calling upon god saying lord jesus receive my spirit and and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge now you know who that was speaking amen there was something in stephen something that dwelled in there and laid this not to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep amen and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was in jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him and as for saul he made havoc of the church entering into every house and hauling men and women and committing them into prison therefore they were scattered abroad when everywhere preaching the gospel what a what a circumstance to bring the word of god to pass and what a testimony that god allowed saul actually to persecute the church and as you read later on in the scriptures the scripture says that paul's testimony was that the one that used to kill us is now one of us it shows you the ability of god to transform things okay it lets you know that that when you have a teenager that goes through a season of rebellion you can just think you know saul he consented to the death of stephen and god brought him a pillar of fire you know and we can we can see that all these circumstances here are beautifully orchestrated by by god and so circumstances arise that and they cause the circumstance causes the manifestation so god was a healer and and that was in god that attribute was in god but that attribute could never be manifested until there was the circumstance of sickness so the circumstance of sickness was allowed that the attribute of god or the manifestation that god was a healer or to make it clear and obvious that god was a healer and that god could show or display that he was a healer the sickness had to be there else else he could have never shown that he was a healer if everybody would have continued and adam was in the garden no sickness no death no nothing and everything the very fact that god was a healer would have went unknown okay so that was an invisible part of god so that part of god couldn't be seen so there had to be a fleshly manifestation in order for that attribute to be seen so god allowed sin he couldn't make adam fall because adam was the son of god but and adam possessed the attributes of his father in fact adam was the first son of god so it was it was right in adam he was without sin but he allowed he took a byproduct and when he created that byproduct that that that part of that byproduct that reasoning part of that by byproduct he knew that would fall but he also knew in adam was the attribute that he would lay his life down for who he loved adam was a perfect type of christ the first adam was a living soul the first but the second adam was a quickening spirit so these circumstances had to come forth so we understand that what one of the parts of what god wanted to do was he wanted to manifest himself he wanted to make himself known so as you sit here in your the part your part in in the plan of god you have to understand that god wants to make himself known to you that you so you're part of that he couldn't make himself known if there wasn't somebody to make himself known to so god allowed us to fall he eternally secured us by putting our name in the lamb's book of life but he let us come in this flesh he let us come into these circumstances the circumstance of sinful flesh the circumstance of being born in iniquity and shaped in sin and coming into the world speaking in lies how many would you think if you were to design your own self what you would design well i wouldn't inside myself bald-headed and big nosed come on right would you have designed yourself a liar huh you wouldn't have designed any of those things in you but the circumstance is the only way that it could be manifested so god secured us to be just and then allowed us to be in a circumstance that he could make himself known to us that's what he wanted to do he wanted to make himself known he wanted man to know he was a healer he wanted man to know he was a savior he wanted man to know he was a deliverer and you couldn't know he was a deliverer until you were in a circumstance he had to deliver you from well believe me adam wasn't in any type of circumstance that he wanted to be delivered from in fact we're going back to the circumstance that ada was in in the beginning how many knows that we're going back to eden eden was heaven on earth eden walking in the cool of the evening the great new jerusalem is going to set it forth and it's going to be back in that beautiful eden and so oh i've got a lot of thoughts on that about adam would eventually have created that new jerusalem you believe that you don't have to because that's what i feel in my heart but i love you and i feel the freedom that i could be able to do that but i derived that because enoch had visions and that's why that he built built that testament as a testimony of what was and uh so anyway so we we we understand that that the circumstances so we we see that god wanted to do that he wanted to make himself known so right where you're sitting now this morning or listening wherever that you are uh in our congregation this is for our congregation and and uh i know maybe other people spy in but for those of us that are here that are part of us online this morning and sitting in our service right where you sit you should know god wants to make himself known to me and we should be an expectation of that that any moment in any circumstance god can make himself known and and so that's a part of the part we play in the plan of god we play the in the part of plan of god that god wants to make himself known to us now i just want to take a few moments this morning and talk about another part of what god wanted to do he wanted to have preeminence now don't look at preeminence the way we do in a carnal mind so in a carnal mind we would think preeminence is be the one who's the boss you know or the one who gets the most recognition or praise we would call base preeminence on a totem pole of fat but that's not what the preeminence that god was talking about god wanted to dwell in that was the preeminence that god wanted he wanted to take up residence and so part of the plan of god is for god to dwell in you that that's what he wanted to do god couldn't dwell in uh something that was marred so what the lord jesus did is he paid the price for that and so we are washed under his blood and now through that blood we have access to the throne of god so god can dwell in us because that were redeemed so god chose to dwell in flesh and that's what we read you said in the beginning was the word right but then he said and the word was made flesh so we understand that that is the way that god planned it that that's the way that he is that he that he chose to do it so he chose to have preeminence he said now notice god himself veiled in human flesh this is a part of his way this is the way that he manifests himself to us manifesting the eternal word of god god made flesh so we we understand that god chose to make himself flesh or he chose to dwell in flesh so on the day when john was baptizing him right which was a type of justification purification the voice came down and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in or in whom i'm pleased not an external pleasure but a preemptual preeminence i'm pleased to dwell in him i'm going to dwell in him this is my beloved son in inside whom i'm pleased to dwell in and so he chose that way so god chose in the beginning he chose to create adam and and and put his attributes in adam and dwell in adam and so now he chose to dwell in uh in uh in jesus so god chose to to dwell in flesh so you know and if you if you spend time reading the unveiling of god you begin to see that this is what he's pointing out is that god veils himself in flesh that's the way he always does himself he hides himself behind the veil of flesh he used to hide himself beside behind the veil of badger skin but he ran that veil to show now he changed forms so he moved from dwelling in behind badger skin to now dwelling in flesh so he changed that form so now he's dwelling in flesh and he wanted to point to the people because there was every promise of the word of god everything that was prophesied in the old testament everything they were reading in that temple everything that they were reading in the scribes that they were teaching the the people every bit of the word of god was manifested in flesh the word of god always manifests itself in flesh the word is made flesh always we call it veiled in flesh or hidden flesh well it doesn't change the fact that it is dwelling in that flesh it can't be hid if it's not there you know if if these these glasses are right here so i can't come over here and say the glasses are hidden in my coat pocket no they're not hid in my coat pocket but you see these glasses now i take these glasses and i put them in my coat pocket you all know now right that they're hid in my coat pocket but if somebody else was to come in here they wouldn't know that they were hid in my coat pocket it would have to be revealed to them by something unseen that they were in my coat pocket and then by that revelation they could say those glasses are in your coat pocket so that's how the prophet of god's gift work those spirits would try to hide but he could go there and say oh that cancer's hid right here that spirit that's causing you to feel this way it's hid right there and what was he he was a discerner of the thoughts intents of the heart those spirits couldn't hide one of my favorite things is in that wonderful film where all of a sudden you can say he says you know i'm waiting for something you know i'm waiting for him he starts talking about he's going to africa and he's doing this and and you're sitting there you're wondering where the prayer line's going to start that humble servant of the lord he's not going to fake it it ain't going to be pretend he's going to stand there and he's going to wait on the lord because he's got a scripture right here that he knows they that wait upon the lord and all of a sudden that head goes back and you can see it's just like he's following that pillar of fire he goes then he turns and he goes he's here i take every spirit in this congregation under my control in the name of jesus christ oh i just like to shout it nothing was hit then it was unveiled everything became unveiled so we know that god always veils himself in flesh now you're part of the plan of god you know where i'm going with this i'm going that god bales himself in flesh that's part of his plan so god's plan is to veil this every word of god is veiled in flesh it's got to be manifested in flesh every promise is manifested in flesh by these exceedingly great and precious promises we become partakers of the divine nature of god so god's word is always manifested in flesh there's no way that you go out there and you see god god's not manifested in this piano now you might know the products were products of his creation and and i'm sure that you could find uh some way that god is in it but that piano on its own can't manifest god and he says and he says now notice every word that jesus reported back to them for they came to see who he was and they could not see him they seen the form but it was he was in his temple god was in his temple veiled in human flesh so god was in his temple that was god's temple they come to see god but they couldn't see him because he was veiled in his temple human flesh now you see the part that you play in the plan of god god chose in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh now once god did that that had to be the way he did it every time so when he was going to manifest himself again he had to manifest himself in flesh he had to manifest the word and flesh so from that time god's words always been manifested in flesh silver and gold have we none but that which we have go wait in the upper room until you're endured with power from on high it's always manifested in flesh too many times the church world and that's why it's denominationism is a curse but because they try to put god in temples made by hand and this is what they stoned stephen over because he said then he's talking about jesus he says which of our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drove out before the face of our fathers and unto the days of david who found favor before god desired to find a tabernacle for god the god of jacob but solemn built him a house so you understand man was looking for a place for god to dwell they knew god was with them he showed up in a pillar of fire they were looking for a place for him to dwell now james see uh stephen's there preaching saying solomon built them a house our father's in the wilderness he was with them in a tabernacle in a pillar of fire and a cloud by night but they wanted a place for god to dwell now here comes stephen he says but solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven and earth heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what else will ye build me saith the lord or what place is the place of my rest hath not my hands made all these things he's looking at the vanity of man and say what do you mean you're going to build me a house the heavens is my throne the earth is my footstool you can't build me a house the choice is his where i'm gonna dwell so he chose to dwell in jesus so god was now in the form he took on the form just like he changed he came down you know he dwelt with the prophets and he came down but now the fullness of the godhead bodily was poured in him that's where he was that's where god chose to dwell and then when he went and redeemed his people and he paid the price for his plan so he dwelleth not in temples made of hands but read first let's go to saint john just for a moment and and go to the 14th chapter and the 17th verse and he said and i will pray i'm sorry go ahead everybody turn your pages i suggest that you really know your bible real good so you know just about where in it all these scriptures lie and i pray the father that he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not why because he's invisible the unseen god but the unseen god is manifested or made known in flesh so he chose to dwell in flesh and he says neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so that was the promise so now he's saying he's dwelling with you because he's in dwelling in jesus but jesus knows he's going to go to calvary no he's going to take the curse of sin off his children and now he's going to change forms from dwelling with us to dwelling in us god dwells in flesh from that time god moved upon the prophets of old but now god was going to make a change he was making an emorphy he was changing his form so he changed his form from dwelling in jesus to dwelling in his bride and these two became one they couldn't see it he said they couldn't understand why that they couldn't see him there stood a man they came to see god and they seen a man see they couldn't see god because god veiled it to them now keep that on your mind god veiled in a man they could say no man could do these works except god it be god no man can do it and how here standing a man and yet the works of god is manifested through him see they couldn't understand that god was veiled in other words god chose to dwell he's veiled in a man as he always was veiled he was veiled unto them he was in he he was in his human temple god was in a human temple now be real careful now he's the same yesterday today and forever see god hiding himself from the world veiled in human being here was god the greek said we would see him god veiled in the form of man hid himself from their view they could only see a man but those predestinated seeing god saw man the others saw god so you understand that god so there's a part that you play in god's plan you understand first of all he wanted to manifest himself show himself now the part that we play in his plan is that now he wants to have a place to dwell or have preeminence he doesn't dwell in temples at one time he did but he rent that veil he moved out and said this is my beloved son in who i'm veiled in there he was unveiled in human beings now he goes to calvary and he keeps saying i'm going to come back he says so i'm not going to leave you comfortless. i will come again to you so there he goes to calvary he pays the price he goes preaches the gospel in the regions of the lost he comes back and he tells them go into the upper room until you're endued with power from on high go up there because now i'm going to come and dwell in you i won't only be with you but i'll be in you you call me master and lord for you say well for so i am but the time's going to come that the works i do you shall do also because i'm going to be dwelling in you oh let me tell you every promise of god is manifested in the flesh now you say why did i mention paul because paul knew what he was but he knew it was what came in him that made him different no wonder the prophet of god said pray who's within you that's god's plan you say what part do i play in god's plan you now become the dwelling place that god dwells in you the word always is veiled in flesh malachi and this is what brother brahms preaching this message he's trying to tell him this is the age this is the time that god is showing this church that he's manifested in flesh so there was malachi 4 5 manifested in flesh there was luke 17 30 manifested in flesh there was revelations 10 7 manifested in flesh but they couldn't see it because god doesn't dwell in temples made of hands he doesn't dwell in organizations he doesn't dwell in systems he doesn't dwell in plan god dwells in beings any human being so here was the word of god malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 here was the word of god that they could study and had been studying and placing it in john and placing it in the two people coming to israel and placing it here and placing it there but god comes down and manifests it in flesh and here's the word why did he do that because what we were having was is that god dwells in his bride here on earth and what called out that bride was the word made flesh revealing to that bride that this is god's dwelling place this is the part that we play the part that we play in this end time is this elect lady not christian like tabernacle not the assembling and fellowshipping of ourselves together worldwide is a group of people that have the same belief in the same faith but it's that god dwelling in that individual god dwelling in flesh and he's and he's he he's he's dwelling in flesh oh brother sister are you catching it look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what god said and it will be opened in the last days through those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into the view of the people what took place all along the hour of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be made known in elijah this last hour how that christ is put out of his church the son of god how is how he is revealed as son of man again how that the church is to be put in order and everything for the last days no creeds no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual hallelujah now we know our part in the plan of god in the last day god is going to dwell in an individual people that's called his bride i'll take one and leave one i'll take and leave that one there's just there's no strings no denominations no buildings or nothing it's the heart with god and him alone just think about it this is the part that we play the heart alone with god god dwelling in the individual god dwelling in his bride amen and he's failed in flesh now you you think that you go back and you understand that the prophet of god said i preached the same thing paul preached this was paul's message to the gentiles he comes and dwells he's here to live in human flesh he's here to be that that's what paul was preaching and here comes this little white horse rider trying to rob it from the people trying to steal it from them just in a little lie the deeds of nickelodeonism the deeds of stealing it away from an individual and giving it back to a priesthood that was what jesus came and stood against that's what peter stood against he don't dwell in temples made of man he don't dwell in churches he don't dwell in faith he doesn't dwell in doctrines he dwells in individuals so you can sit back and say wow this is the part that i play i'm here to be a temple that god dwells in because god don't dwell in christian life tabernacle the only way god got here is if you brought them i've been here when you're not here it's a stone cold dead building building has no life these walls don't breathe these walls don't talk these walls don't feel that's why he couldn't be satisfied with creation alone he made you to have preeminence not rule over he made you so he could dwell in you you could be his presence here on earth just think of it he wanted to make himself known now he wants to dwell he wants to live just grab your bibles now we're closing so let's just remember now read it again and then you turn in your bibles to first corinthians the third chapter the 16th and 17th verse he says i'll send you the comforter the spirit of truth he says you know him because here i am standing right here with you he says you know him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and now he says and shall be in you so now here these disciples go out right and so you go over to first corinthians and what's he say know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you wow just think god created me placed me here in this last day even though i was a sinner like paul he met me with a pillar of fire cleansed me from all unrighteousness and now wants to take his abode and dwelt in me so that he can continue the works that he did him doing the works but having a form to do it in it's still him doing the works he's the healer it's still him doing the deliverance but now he's changed the form that he's working through he waived that first sheep offering he waived that son of man ministry where we saw god dwelled in human flesh doing the works now he tells the church that the church this seed is going to come into the maturity and the works that i do shall you do also because i go to the father and if i go to the father i will come again that where i am you may be also not i am out in space not i am out in heaven but where i am in the relationship with the eternal father father that they may be one as we are one amen think of it that's where he was he did nothing till the father showed them if i do not the works of my father then why do you condemn me and there is he saying why do you condemn me that god dwells in me they should have been happy predestinated saw it predestinators saw that that was god in that man so let's read this what is it that you're the temple of god and and the spirit of god dwell in you and if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple are ye let's turn over a page in your bible you should be able to turn over a page to the sixth chapter and the twentieth verse and let's start with the 19th verse which is the birth just below the 20th verse so we will start with chapter 6 verse 19. what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own you say why aren't you your own because he has the preeminence and what his preeminence was not to have a bunch of recognition and not to have a bunch of accolades laid on him of how great he is and how wonderful he is and what a powerful god he is no his preeminence was that i can dwell in there you are not your own why aren't you your own because he is preeminence for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which our gods god takes preeminence by dwelling go over into first corinthians the sixth second corinthians see if i can find it here second corinthians the sixth chapter the 16th verse what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people hallelujah this bride was not set apart to be a more scriptural abiding people or a more doctrinally sound people or a more scripturally revelated people let us leave the doctrines of laying on of hands of the mysteries and things but let us move on to perfection do you understand when that which is perfect is come that that which is perfect is not the bible it's perfect letter but the same letter killeth but that which is perfect was when this word dwells in flesh that's why he was perfect because the word was made flesh and the scriptures come back and say be ye perfect as he was perfect what made him perfect was that god dwelt there that's our part i can't determine the measure but i know he dwells in is elected he you should know he's in there if someone came to you and said knock knock who's there you should say the spirit of god because he promised that he would come again and not only be with me another is working on my behalf like jesus did he worked on our behalf but now he'll be within us and because he's there the works that i do shall you do also because i'm going to come and dwell in you you say what so so many times we think that our part is believing and only believing what is taught in other words we think our part is to say the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ is the correct baptism amen that's my job stay amen there's only one god one person amen that's my job my job's just to it and we so we misinterpret what prophet of god said the evidence of the holy spirit is to amen every word of god and we take that on the carnal side but that's not what amen means amen means so be it so when he says i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh you say so be it come dwell in me come manifest in the flesh come make that word live in the flesh because anyone that says that word that jesus christ has not come in the flesh not 2 000 years ago right today is antichrist think of it you're called to play that part don't get caught up in this world that's why the scripture says separate yourself from the world aren't you glad thank god for this virus that makes me stay six feet away from all these demons can you imagine i'd go home and leslie cranks up some old rock station or some old country music station so we can be eating out oh we're just devastated there's no restaurant well all you sisters can invite me and leslie over to eat we would love to come to your restaurant i probably shouldn't do that i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that you can just make me a cake or something and bring it to me some peach cobbler something no but you understand we're almost devastated that we can't make contact with the corruptness that's out there well what's going to happen to our economy i know one thing the righteous won't beg bread that's thus saith the lord and that's what he said i'd rather eat bark off of trees and drink branch water than be a part of this world i don't know why the circumstance but i know one thing the circumstance is going to manifest that god is dwelling in a people listen now let's go back to start from the beginning let's read this what agreement have the temple of god with idols i got no agreement with him no plan in other words i'm not relying and trusting him to provide anything to me satan if you'll give me a raise i'll work sundays or if you get me this loan i'll work seven days a week i ain't got no agreement with idols we're the temple of the living god we already know this god can create bread we already know this god can raise the dead we already know this god can turn water into wine we already know this god can take 12 loaves or earth six loaves and feed ten thousand and five thousand and break fishes he said you already know this god said why murmur amongst yourself that you have no bread you don't think he was sitting there saying come on guys don't you remember the 12 baskets what's wrong with you you don't think i can feed you oh what are we gonna do about the tax man barbara gary what are you gonna do about the tax man go fishing right what are you gonna do if you toiled all night throw the net on the other side who can pluck you out of the palm of my hand if i started to work in you i'll finish it don't you understand his finally dwelling in a people is his finished work he's transferring the resurrection power from his flesh to your flesh hallelujah if the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body why because that's the third part of his plan is to bring you back to where you were in the beginning first of all he manifests himself secondly he dwells in you thirdly he takes you back to where you were in the beginning oh don't you see our part where we are he's here to dwell in you clean your mind now let's finish the scripture what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god had said now here it is being fulfilled in flesh i will dwell in them and walk in them the works that i do you shall do also it's not me that does the work jesus said it's the father that is in me that does the work it's not us that does the work it's the god that's in us that does the work we're just carrying out his word lay hands on the sick pray cast out and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and my daughters saith the almighty amen praise god you see god's always veiled in flesh and he's unveiled in the same amen amen just think your part and you say well look at me i say look at paul paul said i was the chiefest of sinners i laid waste to the church but when he met me on that day is because my name was written in the lamb's book of lights and that had to be manifested in flesh every word of god which you are and if your name was written on the lamb's book of life that was the word of god or the thought of god every thought of god is manifested in the flesh because in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh so every promise every time how many times have you heard the prophet god said ye are the word of god you're the word of god for this age you're the word of god for this time you're the word of god for this season your god does not the scripture itself say ye that are you are gods why are you gods because god dwells in you god bless you brother billy if he'd come and it's really here they're pointing back there like brother branham preach here he is aren't you happy see you think well i'm a wreck god fix rex in order to carry out his word if your name's in the lamb's book life i don't care what kind of wreck you're in his words has to be manifested so i rest in that nothing can put your name on the book nothing can take the name off the prophet said you can save god a lot of trouble if you'll just line up but if you want he'll line you up but i'd rather have that promise right than to think that it would be all over for me you see our part i mean we want to build a bigger building we're building that building for our flesh you know just like when you have three kids you move from a two-bedroom to a three-bedroom when they get teenagers you might better think about getting that fourth bedroom you do that for the flesh you know so but where god dwells as in a people we don't go to church to find god we go to church to hear the word of god but you find god in here he's in that seed that's in your heart he's in that that deep like i love that song sisters he's in that deep that's calling it's when you hear that word of god you feel that anointing and it just stirs you and you know there's something there you know there's a longing in your heart i know for a fact god can make that longing so real that it consumes you i know what it's like to be so desperate for god they're so hungry for god so wanting out of the life i was in so wanting out of the condition i was in so full of despair [Music] could harley take it i told my mom i said mom i'm going to kill myself she said now calm down son all my friends do it they rolled joints for me by the hundreds smoke this smoke this this will make you feel better take this eat this drink this gallons are a ripple in my house pounds of drugs [Music] could be such under the influence i had no control over my senses my heart on my heart i just cried out and cried out and cried out finally one of my friends looked at me he'd give me everything in the arsenal for the flesh and out of his mouth like god speaking out of the mule he said why don't you read the bible [Music] another i don't know nothing else in the world that come help you why don't you try that god book i got that god book flipped it open i said all right i'll read it they're on a rooftop i read romans chapter one and the unseen god failed himself in human flesh you don't believe that if you don't believe that you've never been converted because he said i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again and i'll be with you and i'll be in you even until the end he said nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand and if i start to work i'll finish it oh my then all of a sudden i started to see wow my job isn't to build the church i found out the other day there's a lot of men that can build the church better than i can but i will preach the gospel and the gospel is this is the age that he can dwell in a pure unadulterated bought washed redeemed bride [Music] and he will be on this earth when he leaves he will be in human fleshly formed when he leaves this earth jesus rose in the flesh this bride will rise in the flesh [Music] you say well what happens if you die brother mcgary i'm going to go to that waiting place i'm looking to go back to eden and i believe it that's your purpose that's your part in the plan of god why are we building a church because we love one another why are we building churches because we want to have room for our sunday school we want to have places of fellowship we want to have some place we can serve god and invite people but it's all in vain if he doesn't dwell on the heart and the lives of individuals don't forget that don't let the temporary world separate yourself under your calling to be the temple of the living god if you're not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that word has to be manifested in your flesh if you're baptized in the father son and holy ghost you do not have christian baptism you have the baptism of three gods if you're baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost you believe there are three gods that make up one god you know who figured that one out don't you lucifer [Music] oh you can't say that brother mcgeary yes i can say that it's the mark of the beast there's only one god it isn't the third person that dwells in you or anoints you it's god himself the one person god see god's a manifesto he's always been a manifesto he always shows himself so in order to reveal himself he had to be a father in creation [Music] he had to reveal himself as a son so we could understand that we're sons and daughters that he was the firstborn [Music] we're joined heirs to every promise he was a promise of he had to come as a son in order to do that and then he had to return back in the office of the holy spirit so he could put the same life that resurrected him put it back in us get away from that devil baptism in the name of the father and son and the holy ghost else you'll find yourself in the fire of hell because you held on to a pope instead of a gospel you could say i'm baptist no you're catholic it's a demon baptism he said the catholic church was nothing but the worst form of spiritualism that ever existed people praying to saints [Music] oh you're going to lose your federal funding if you preach like that didn't have their federal funding i want something that transforms people into resurrection material don't you i want a rapture don't you amen don't play with this gospel let's get real amen i don't mean to get upset but don't you just hate a liar i hate a liar and satan's the father all lies so i just want you to know i'm sorry i'm trying to become a better christian but i don't love satan so if you think that you need to pray for me go ahead but i know what he's going to do with them [Music] so i want nothing to do with him because there's a lake of fire prepared for satan and all those angels would you rather be a child of god wouldn't you rather take your position in christ wouldn't you rather open your heart and say come live in me lord come dwell in me lord i'm here this morning i'm going to give myself the promise for this age i've been like saul i i've been like a sinner but i want you to come today and dwell in me i want you to dwell in me lord i'd be baptized in your name for the remission of my sins lord because you promised if i would you'd fill me with your spirit [Music] oh i want to be part i want to play my part in the plan of god don't you let's stand together amen maybe if you bowed your head [Music] and you want to lift your hand this morning and say lord i'd like to play my part in your plan i would like to find the works that i'm for ordained to walk in lord i want to know my calling i want to know what you'd have me to do [Music] lord i want to open my life for you to dwell in i want to come up from the world and be separate lord we're in this fulfillment of you taking

don't yell at the people i i yell at that lying doctrine of the devil that keeps people from being whom they are called to be [Music] bless this people father they come out this morning others were courteous and they stayed home but you're not a god of this building go right down to where they are and touch their heart may they never be ashamed to stand on your word may there be no compromise in their life [Music] may they not be lukewarm [Music] just ask for your grace that the glory of god and his mercy and grace is revealed in them let's let it be father amen so be it we ask it in jesus name [Music] oh [Music] [Music] yes [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] uh [Music] he came to me [Music] he [Music]
