[7:00] will welcome you as you invite buddy
[7:01] mike for our psalm reading this morning
[7:03] and may god bless you
[7:18] good morning
[7:22] you know once again let's go ahead and
[7:23] look at psalm 119 this morning
[7:26] we're just going to continue reading
[7:28] that together
[7:30] you know as we've been reading this
[7:33] you know i hope you see that this is all
[7:34] about a relationship
[7:37] with the word
[7:39] that this is
[7:41] you know uses different words it calls
[7:43] it says the precepts the commandments
[7:45] the law the testimonies it's all just
[7:47] the word
[7:49] you know you can replace any of those
[7:51] words with the word
[7:55] you know this is hopefully you see this
[7:57] is more than just reading and studying
[7:59] and understanding
[8:00] a book
[8:02] the scriptures and trying to order your
[8:04] life
[8:06] to discipline your life
[8:08] with the scriptures there's no life in
[8:09] that
[8:10] all right you know it's that's just
[8:13] religion
[8:15] but you know as we read psalm 119
[8:18] hopefully you see
[8:20] it's a chapter of action
[8:23] there's action words in almost every
[8:25] single verse
[8:28] it describes a living
[8:30] active
[8:31] functional relationship
[8:33] with the word
[8:35] you know
[8:36] it has an effect
[8:38] it does something for you
[8:40] and you do something back
[8:43] that's an active relationship
[8:48] you know there's a clear example of this
[8:49] as we go through looking at verse 25
[8:51] we're going to read kind of that next
[8:54] eight verses
[8:56] you know it's a beautiful summary of the
[8:58] transformation work
[9:01] that is done by the word
[9:04] the transformation the activity of
[9:07] transformation
[9:09] you know it begins in verse 25
[9:13] my soul cleaveth unto the dust
[9:16] you know that word cleave means to cling
[9:19] to stick
[9:22] you know and that's our natural tendency
[9:23] isn't it
[9:25] our natural state is to be attracted to
[9:28] earthly things
[9:31] to cling to
[9:33] or to be stuck
[9:35] to this world
[9:38] you know that's where we all start isn't
[9:40] it
[9:43] then there's a cry of his heart says
[9:45] quicken me
[9:48] to bring me to life
[9:50] energize me
[9:53] according to thy word that's an action
[9:57] scriptures and books don't have actions
[10:01] you know that's just dead letter it
[10:03] takes a person
[10:05] to perform an action
[10:09] so as he sits in this natural state
[10:11] clinging to earthly things his cry has
[10:13] quickened me
[10:15] bring me to life
[10:17] energize me
[10:19] according to thy
[10:22] word
[10:23] the thy in thy word is who he's calling
[10:26] out to
[10:28] you it says in verse 26
[10:31] i have declared my ways
[10:34] that's a confession
[10:37] and then in verse 26 thou
[10:40] herdest me
[10:43] as the song says this poor man cried
[10:47] and the lord heard me
[10:49] notice the progression
[10:51] of the relationship with the word
[10:56] you know he goes from his natural
[10:58] condition
[11:00] calling out for quickening
[11:03] confessing his ways and someone hears
[11:06] him
[11:08] goes on in verse 26 teach me thy statute
[11:14] make me understand the way of thy
[11:16] precepts
[11:18] so shall i talk of thy
[11:21] wondrous works
[11:23] a confession of his own ways
[11:26] and a cry to someone
[11:28] that he would be instructed in
[11:31] his ways
[11:33] that he would be instead of his own
[11:35] works instead of his own ways
[11:37] that i might be instructed in your ways
[11:41] that i might testify of
[11:42] your works
[11:46] verse 28
[11:48] my soul melteth for heaviness
[11:51] repentance
[11:54] again look at the progression of the
[11:56] relationship with the word this is far
[11:58] more than studying a book
[12:02] a cry for quickening and instruction
[12:04] followed by repentance
[12:08] he says strengthen thou me according to
[12:10] thy word
[12:12] he needs supernatural strength
[12:16] something beyond the strength of man
[12:19] strengthen thou me
[12:22] to cause him to abandon his works and
[12:25] his ways
[12:27] and to perform works
[12:28] according to the word
[12:31] it's a book of action
[12:33] verse 29 remove me from the way
[12:36] of lying
[12:39] notice he didn't say deliver me from
[12:41] lying
[12:43] he said remove me from the way
[12:46] of lying
[12:48] you know in verse 26 he had said i have
[12:50] declared my ways
[12:53] and then in verse 29 he describes it as
[12:56] the way of lying
[12:58] his ways
[12:59] are the way of lying
[13:01] you know we know that
[13:04] all men are born into the world speaking
[13:07] lies and surely that's true
[13:11] but you know we've also been born into a
[13:13] way
[13:14] of lying
[13:15] a world of deception the great lie
[13:20] deliver thou me from the way
[13:23] of lying
[13:25] a lie is an untruth
[13:27] an absence of truth a perversion of
[13:30] truth
[13:34] you know outside of the intervention of
[13:36] the word we would find ourselves stuck
[13:40] in the way of lying
[13:46] it says in verse 29 grant me
[13:49] thy law
[13:51] graciously
[13:53] give me your word
[13:54] by your grace
[13:57] you know remove me from the way of no
[13:59] truth
[14:01] and give me
[14:02] thy truth
[14:04] you know this is a nature change
[14:08] trading a nature of untruth
[14:11] for the truth himself
[14:13] i am the way
[14:15] the truth
[14:16] and the life
[14:18] it says in verse 30 i have chosen the
[14:21] way of truth
[14:22] remove me from the way of untruth i have
[14:25] chosen the way of truth
[14:27] exchanging
[14:28] untruth for truth and nature change you
[14:31] see the progression of the action of the
[14:34] word
[14:37] do you recognize the pattern
[14:40] how many can say that they have been on
[14:41] that journey
[14:43] with the relationship with the word
[14:48] you know moving from a natural state of
[14:50] clinging
[14:51] to earthly things
[14:54] and then because of a quickening work
[14:56] there's a confession
[14:58] repentance
[15:00] instruction
[15:02] supernatural strengthening
[15:05] then a nature change
[15:08] a change from the way of untruth to the
[15:10] way of truth
[15:12] and look at the testimony that comes
[15:14] from this
[15:15] relationship with the word verse 30
[15:18] 31
[15:19] i have stuck
[15:21] unto thy testimonies
[15:24] he went from verse 25 my soul cleaveth
[15:26] to the dust
[15:28] where i was stuck
[15:30] in earthly things
[15:32] so verse 31 i have stuck
[15:36] unto thy testimonies
[15:38] thy word
[15:39] the action
[15:40] of the word
[15:44] you know i uh
[15:46] i thought it was just a beautiful
[15:47] example
[15:49] of the
[15:50] action-oriented relationship
[15:53] of the word
[15:56] and you know to me it was just a
[15:58] reminder
[16:00] and a testimony
[16:02] that the word
[16:03] produces action
[16:05] the word has an effect
[16:07] it's not just something we study
[16:10] or believe
[16:12] or memorize
[16:13] but it's something that produces an
[16:16] action-oriented relationship and you can
[16:19] see it in the example of transformation
[16:23] both in the word and in our lives
[16:25] i just thought it was just beautiful i
[16:27] thought it was all laid out there i hope
[16:28] it was a blessing to you it was to me
[16:30] but let's just read that next little
[16:32] piece of psalm 119 together from 25 to
[16:35] 32
[16:37] my soul cleaveth unto the dust quicken
[16:40] thou me according to thy word i have
[16:43] declared my ways and thou herdest me
[16:46] teach me thy statutes make me to
[16:48] understand the way of thy precepts so
[16:51] shall i talk of thy wondrous works
[16:54] my soul melteth for heaviness strengthen
[16:57] thou me according to thy word remove
[16:59] from me the way of lying and grant me
[17:02] thy law graciously i have chosen the way
[17:05] of truth thy judgments have i laid
[17:07] before me i have stuck unto thy
[17:10] testimonies o lord put me not to shame
[17:13] i will run the way of thy commandments
[17:15] when thou shalt enlarge my heart amen

[43:59] holy name we pray
[44:01] amen
[44:02] amen i don't want to stop worshiping
[44:06] amen don't think that you don't even
[44:10] think grandma can be able to preach
[44:11] after that you know what i mean it'll be
[44:13] a letdown
[44:15] but uh
[44:17] we're not counting on us
[44:20] amen aren't you counting on the love of
[44:22] god
[44:23] if i if i really want a
[44:25] revelation
[44:27] a increase in revelation i'd like to
[44:29] have be
[44:30] increased in the revelation of how much
[44:33] god loves me
[44:36] how much he loves me when i was just
[44:40] became a christian i wasn't a christian
[44:42] very long at all
[44:44] and
[44:45] this elderly gentleman
[44:48] came up to me and and he said you know
[44:51] god really loves you
[44:53] and i thought oh yeah you know
[44:55] i believe that he says no wait a minute
[44:59] he says i'm trying to tell you something
[45:01] here
[45:02] god really
[45:04] loves you
[45:06] and and he was trying to say something
[45:10] and i believe it that god did have a
[45:12] special love to me
[45:15] because he had to go really deep
[45:18] to find me
[45:20] but he did it
[45:22] he didn't have to do it but he did it
[45:26] amen we're not going to forget that
[45:28] let's pray as we approach him again the
[45:30] word let's open our bibles
[45:34] and thank you musicians one day by the
[45:36] grace of god i'm going to sing in the
[45:38] choir
[45:41] it may not be here
[45:44] but there's a choir i'm going to sing
[45:45] and there's a special
[45:47] that's going to be on my heart
[45:50] and
[45:50] i trust it now this is scripture
[45:54] i
[45:55] i didn't
[45:56] quite understand why the lord brought me
[45:59] to this scripture this morning and
[46:01] and i was in my office it just i got in
[46:05] and
[46:06] and
[46:08] he said i listen
[46:11] in exodus
[46:13] this is
[46:14] what i want you to read and it all fell
[46:17] together but
[46:18] here let's let's read over in exodus the
[46:21] 14th chapter
[46:30] and this morning i
[46:33] uh
[46:34] i'm just going to put i don't have a lot
[46:36] of notes i'm
[46:37] going to have to go by inspiration
[46:40] um but i want to preach on
[46:44] the struggle
[46:46] the battle
[46:48] the burden
[46:50] the victory
[46:52] okay
[46:53] so let us let us read here in exodus
[46:59] the 11 of the
[47:01] 14th chapter and the 11th verse and
[47:06] and so you know the story right they're
[47:10] coming out of their egypt
[47:13] amen
[47:17] and they said unto moses because there
[47:20] were no graves in egypt
[47:22] thou hath taken us away to die in the
[47:25] wilderness
[47:27] wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us
[47:31] to carry us forth out of egypt now i
[47:36] want you to hold that
[47:37] that dilemma why
[47:40] did you take me out
[47:44] you know what i mean now remember
[47:46] the coming out of egypt is a type isn't
[47:49] it of the bride
[47:51] it's a type of every christian journey
[47:54] amen so he said why did you do this if
[47:56] anybody ever asked why'd you save me
[48:00] i was happy back there
[48:03] all right and he said
[48:06] he said
[48:08] you see
[48:10] he said
[48:12] but
[48:14] is it not
[48:16] this
[48:17] the word that we did tell thee in egypt
[48:22] saying
[48:24] let us alone
[48:26] that we may serve
[48:29] the egyptians
[48:32] for it had been better for us to serve
[48:35] the egyptians
[48:37] than that we should die in the
[48:39] wilderness
[48:43] and moses
[48:45] said unto the people fear ye not
[48:49] stand still
[48:51] and see the salvation of the lord
[48:55] which he will show you
[48:57] today
[48:59] for the egyptians whom you have seen
[49:03] today
[49:04] ye shall see
[49:06] them again no more forever
[49:11] the lord shall fight for you and you
[49:14] shall hold your peace
[49:16] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[49:18] word in your precious name we pray amen
[49:22] god bless you may be seated
[49:24] this morning
[49:28] there's uh
[49:31] certainly a shout in the camp this
[49:34] morning amen amen
[49:37] and you know i like
[49:40] when there's a shout in the camp because
[49:43] when there's a shout in the camp there's
[49:45] always those that are wondering well
[49:48] what is everybody shouting about
[49:51] what's all the excitement about
[49:53] uh you know they're
[49:55] we know the story of blind bartimaeus
[49:58] and and black martinez he sat at his
[50:01] place and all of a sudden he heard the
[50:03] shout he heard there was a shout in the
[50:05] camp
[50:06] and
[50:07] and so as the crowd was moving down and
[50:10] he heard this he inquired of somebody
[50:13] what is it
[50:14] what is he saying oh haven't you heard
[50:16] it's the young prophet it's jesus of
[50:19] nazareth
[50:20] and and so the shout
[50:23] caused the inquiry
[50:26] and the inquiry when they heard it they
[50:29] began to hear well who is this man who
[50:31] is this jesus well he's the one this is
[50:34] the one that raised uh lazarus from the
[50:36] dead and the leopards and and the thing
[50:39] was and then he he took it within
[50:42] himself
[50:44] and he cried out
[50:46] so the the shout's a good thing but
[50:49] it's a good thing to have a shout in the
[50:51] camp it's a good thing to be worshipping
[50:53] the lord
[50:55] because those that that don't know what
[50:58] you're shouting about it gives them an
[51:00] opportunity to find out what the shout's
[51:02] all about
[51:05] you know you know what i mean
[51:10] i'll guarantee is when when you have
[51:12] good news
[51:13] you shout about it
[51:15] when the
[51:17] the woman found the coin
[51:19] she shouted about it she went and got
[51:22] her neighbors that which was lost
[51:24] is found
[51:26] and so it's a it's a great uh
[51:29] it's a great thing that i have to shout
[51:32] in the camp it's also
[51:34] an important thing not to let that die
[51:38] and uh
[51:39] and uh
[51:41] and that's why uh we're having testimony
[51:43] we're gonna continue our testimony to
[51:45] service many other people came to me uh
[51:48] and said i'd like to testify sunday
[51:50] night so if you have your testimony just
[51:52] write your name down
[51:54] give it to billy
[51:55] uh
[51:56] take a little bit of prayer in your
[51:58] testimony so you can keep it
[52:00] to the point because pretty soon you
[52:03] want to tell your life story
[52:05] you know i tried to tell my life story
[52:07] one time two and a half hours later you
[52:10] know i was still going so
[52:12] uh
[52:13] you know which i i wouldn't mind you
[52:15] know
[52:16] i'm kind of to that age now if i fell
[52:18] asleep in my seat nobody would say much
[52:20] about it
[52:22] for that
[52:23] i'm grateful
[52:25] for that but
[52:26] um
[52:29] i have a
[52:30] concern and it's not a negative concern
[52:34] it's a positive concern
[52:37] and
[52:38] and so i'd like to read this statement
[52:41] that
[52:42] um the prophet of god in preaching he
[52:45] says
[52:48] and this is out of the message proving
[52:51] his word
[52:52] that brother branham preached in los
[52:54] angeles
[52:55] and
[52:57] i believe this is right after that he
[52:59] had
[53:00] spoken of the earthquake going to shake
[53:04] california so
[53:06] but he says this he says
[53:08] and if you can find that you're welcome
[53:10] to put it on the board
[53:12] it's proving his word paragraph
[53:14] 22
[53:16] and it's just right in here that brother
[53:18] branham
[53:19] um
[53:21] he
[53:24] talks this so it's paragraph 22
[53:25] approving this word
[53:27] the one that was preached on a
[53:30] 4 26
[53:32] of
[53:35] 1965.
[53:36] he says now tonight i want to read a
[53:39] place
[53:40] here in the scriptures just for a few
[53:43] moments
[53:45] we're going to pray for the sick
[53:47] billy said
[53:49] he give out a bunch of prayer cards
[53:51] and he gave me
[53:53] out some yesterday and i never got to
[53:56] any of them last night
[53:58] and i wonder
[54:00] when the holy spirit
[54:02] you
[54:03] he says you
[54:05] you can't make it work
[54:08] it's just like a little lever
[54:12] you pull yourself into gear
[54:15] you're the ones that does that operating
[54:19] of the holy spirit not me
[54:23] now
[54:27] that like that says teaching right there
[54:29] in
[54:30] itself
[54:33] but
[54:34] i don't believe that the prophet of god
[54:36] came to speak of himself he was way too
[54:40] humble
[54:41] for that
[54:43] i think everything he said
[54:46] he said for his
[54:48] the bride
[54:50] because the way of a true prophet is to
[54:53] speak the word
[54:54] so when he says you know it's like a
[54:57] little lever
[54:58] you pull
[54:59] yourself into that gear
[55:02] you don't
[55:04] we always can look well that's brother
[55:06] branham but but
[55:08] you too are the sons and daughters of
[55:11] god
[55:12] you are also the word that god had in
[55:15] his mind before the beginning of
[55:19] the
[55:20] of time and creation
[55:22] he also had
[55:24] thoughts of you and his thoughts to you
[55:27] were good
[55:28] and and he knew that
[55:30] that he had a wonderful thought of you
[55:33] and that thought had an expected end
[55:36] so you could sit here and realize that
[55:38] god's got
[55:40] an expected end for me
[55:43] so he's he's bringing me as we talked in
[55:46] the rising of the sun
[55:49] and in our journey he he's bringing us
[55:52] and he's drawing us to that expected end
[55:57] he's drawing us to
[55:59] the the finished creative product that
[56:03] he had in his mind
[56:05] but we understand that god's an
[56:07] evolutionist he's a god that unfolds
[56:10] he's a god that does things in process
[56:13] you know wouldn't it have been wonderful
[56:15] if he would have just said whom well
[56:18] we're all there in eden
[56:21] we'd have never known he was a healer
[56:23] we'd have never known he's a deliverer
[56:25] we would have never really recognized
[56:28] that he was even the great god that he
[56:32] was
[56:33] because it was all that we ever knew
[56:36] and so we knew that he had such a
[56:38] marvelous way of creating a contrast
[56:42] so that that we could have fellowship
[56:45] with him and know that where we were
[56:48] once lost and now we're found
[56:51] but he said this little lever he says
[56:53] you do that you pull that gift you you
[56:57] make that so you've got to realize that
[57:00] you've got something within you
[57:02] that has been created if i could call
[57:05] that a lever
[57:07] that can pull yourself into the presence
[57:11] of the holy spirit
[57:13] that can pull yourself into
[57:16] the the the word of god
[57:19] when you sit down and you
[57:22] and you approach there's two ways to
[57:24] approach the word of god you can read
[57:26] the word of god because it's a beautiful
[57:28] thing to read it's a wonderful thing to
[57:30] read the stories and things are
[57:32] wonderful or you can approach the word
[57:34] of god to hear from god
[57:38] you understand and when you do that that
[57:40] that you're pulling that lever because
[57:43] you're pulling yourself in there for an
[57:45] answer you're pulling yourself in there
[57:47] to receive something from god
[57:50] now a lot of us don't pull the lever
[57:57] you know you know what i'm we know it's
[57:59] there
[58:00] but we don't make that move but let's
[58:02] just go on and read what he continues to
[58:04] say
[58:07] he says
[58:10] you're the ones that do that you do that
[58:14] yourself
[58:18] you do that yourself
[58:20] so god's equipped you
[58:24] to enter into his spirit
[58:28] so
[58:30] so i last night i noticed even in the
[58:34] discernment it never picked up
[58:36] with the people just right
[58:39] they didn't seem to
[58:41] take to it
[58:43] i have
[58:44] found it
[58:46] here lately it seems like more or less
[58:50] just as i was speaking laying on of
[58:53] hands upon the sick
[58:56] they know
[58:58] we we should realize
[59:01] that
[59:02] in us has been given
[59:07] we who believe jesus christ and are born
[59:11] of his spirit
[59:13] and filled with that quickening power
[59:17] that power
[59:18] that
[59:19] in you
[59:21] by laying on of hands
[59:23] and on
[59:25] on the others
[59:26] like the disciples did
[59:29] down through the ages it's absolutely
[59:33] healed the sick
[59:35] raised the dead
[59:37] it showed visions and prophecies
[59:41] and the same spirit that lived amongst
[59:44] the early apostles is living in the
[59:48] church today
[59:51] working the very same thing
[59:54] and as
[59:56] quick as we can recognize that
[1:00:01] see no matter how much it's working
[1:00:05] you've got to recognize that and believe
[1:00:09] that
[1:00:10] it won't do one bit of good until you
[1:00:13] believe it
[1:00:14] but the moment you believe it your
[1:00:17] troubles are ended that's true
[1:00:22] so
[1:00:25] we
[1:00:28] we know that the scripture
[1:00:32] tells us i i believe it's in
[1:00:36] romans the eighth chapter that we fight
[1:00:39] not against principle flesh and blood
[1:00:42] but against principalities
[1:00:45] powers and
[1:00:46] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:00:50] a lot of sometimes are in battle with
[1:00:52] ourselves
[1:00:54] when it's really not you at all
[1:00:57] it's the it's the enemy
[1:01:00] but he has a way of of uh
[1:01:03] of battling us so i'd like to talk about
[1:01:06] our journey because we've just had so
[1:01:09] many people
[1:01:10] in our in our body that have come back
[1:01:13] from camp and other people that have
[1:01:15] went to camp that have been at different
[1:01:17] places in their christian walk
[1:01:20] who who
[1:01:22] have who have received something from
[1:01:25] the lord
[1:01:28] but what transpires in every one of us
[1:01:31] first of all is the struggle
[1:01:36] there's a struggle that starts within
[1:01:39] ourselves in our our lives maybe it's
[1:01:42] the word of god comes by we hear
[1:01:44] something maybe we have the question in
[1:01:47] our life of uh why am i where i'm at and
[1:01:51] why do i have the parents and and okay
[1:01:54] where's my life going but i want you to
[1:01:57] realize that with every christian
[1:02:01] and though you might not notice it from
[1:02:04] the outside someone might look like
[1:02:07] everything's just rolling smooth you
[1:02:09] know what i mean and yet on the inside
[1:02:12] there was a great struggle going on
[1:02:14] there was a great turmoil going on
[1:02:17] many times the world is shocked
[1:02:21] because somebody will take their life
[1:02:24] and
[1:02:26] and they they stand back in
[1:02:28] in dismay
[1:02:30] because they they say well we thought
[1:02:34] everything was good we thought
[1:02:36] everything was fine
[1:02:38] we just and and that that's a
[1:02:41] uh
[1:02:43] just an easy way
[1:02:45] to to look at things
[1:02:47] is just think well if they're dressed
[1:02:49] good if everything's fine and
[1:02:50] everything's going on then must
[1:02:52] everything must be fine but i think if
[1:02:54] we understand and we recognize that
[1:02:57] people go through struggle
[1:03:00] there's a struggle inside the struggle's
[1:03:02] going on and we know that that struggle
[1:03:07] takes place in the mind
[1:03:10] because that's where the battleground is
[1:03:13] a lot of internal struggle a lot of
[1:03:16] thoughts how many testimonies did we
[1:03:19] hear wednesday night as i was struggling
[1:03:22] in my mind i was struggling with this i
[1:03:24] was struggling with that and god
[1:03:27] delivered me from my struggle
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:33] oh well i've heard it
[1:03:37] when people have deliverance
[1:03:40] made from alcohol they they would
[1:03:43] testify i struggled with alcohol
[1:03:46] i fought with it i struggled with it i i
[1:03:49] it was a battle that was going on with
[1:03:53] inside of me
[1:03:57] and you don't have control over that
[1:04:03] it's a it it's a struggle i i think uh
[1:04:06] brother mike touched on it
[1:04:08] a little bit in his exportations but it
[1:04:12] takes two for a relationship right it
[1:04:14] takes two for a struggle
[1:04:22] you understand because you're struggling
[1:04:25] against something
[1:04:28] i remember the first time i i ever saw
[1:04:31] an advertisement for
[1:04:33] resistance training i thought that's
[1:04:35] stupid
[1:04:40] you know that's where they got those
[1:04:41] rubber bands and they just pull
[1:04:44] and they struggle
[1:04:46] but see there's something else pulling
[1:04:48] back
[1:04:50] you understand so there's something that
[1:04:52] struggle well the reason you're in a
[1:04:55] struggle is because there's two people
[1:04:58] struggling for you
[1:05:01] you kind of feel like the tug of war
[1:05:04] rope
[1:05:06] you know what i mean one's on one end
[1:05:09] and something's on the other end
[1:05:11] you know that i mean
[1:05:14] the pink panthers from penn state are
[1:05:16] pulling you this way and
[1:05:19] and god's pulling you this way
[1:05:22] you know what i mean and you find
[1:05:24] yourself in a struggle so i want you to
[1:05:26] understand the struggles there
[1:05:29] it's always the first step
[1:05:36] remember we're talking about struggle
[1:05:39] battle burden victory
[1:05:42] so the struggle's there
[1:05:44] you know because so many times we feel
[1:05:46] while i struggled and
[1:05:48] and
[1:05:49] you only have one struggle
[1:05:54] no every time he comes to pole
[1:05:58] you'll find yourself in a struggle
[1:06:01] every time that he decides to make a
[1:06:03] move on you you'll find yourself in a
[1:06:06] struggle
[1:06:07] now the the thing about it is we've had
[1:06:10] so many victories and and people somehow
[1:06:13] said i was struggling
[1:06:16] and praise god
[1:06:18] i overcame that struggle
[1:06:23] and that's always i mean if you can you
[1:06:26] can you to overcome right so it doesn't
[1:06:29] matter
[1:06:30] what you overcome
[1:06:32] the important thing is how you overcome
[1:06:35] it
[1:06:36] and we know that our victory
[1:06:39] is our faith
[1:06:42] right first john
[1:06:44] 5 and four
[1:06:48] even our faith
[1:06:51] look
[1:06:52] i thought as we people began to testify
[1:06:55] and
[1:06:56] and
[1:06:57] many people have sat with me even those
[1:06:59] that haven't gone to camp in the
[1:07:02] last few days and i i love the the
[1:07:04] things that i've heard i used to
[1:07:06] struggle with this and i used to
[1:07:08] struggle with that
[1:07:10] and so god delivers us out of the
[1:07:13] struggle
[1:07:15] but he doesn't deliver us out of the
[1:07:18] struggle
[1:07:20] into
[1:07:22] a
[1:07:23] flowery field of ease
[1:07:28] he do so the struggle
[1:07:31] is going on inward
[1:07:35] that's the struggle
[1:07:37] and then you come to that place where
[1:07:39] you make that decision
[1:07:42] of
[1:07:43] which
[1:07:44] which side of the
[1:07:46] of the rope you're going to go on
[1:07:49] you know what i mean so
[1:07:51] god's ear pulling and right isn't that
[1:07:53] what the scripture says satan's cast his
[1:07:56] vote against you god's casted his vote
[1:07:59] for you now there you are in the
[1:08:02] struggle
[1:08:06] which way am i going to go which path am
[1:08:09] i going to choose
[1:08:11] and and then the battles going on right
[1:08:14] eve was in that battle
[1:08:17] and satan's giving you all the benefits
[1:08:21] who else do we know was in that battle
[1:08:25] the lord was in that battle
[1:08:29] i'll give you all the kingdoms
[1:08:33] i'll give you this i'll give you that
[1:08:35] we'll read a statement here in a little
[1:08:36] bit about that
[1:08:40] but
[1:08:41] so the struggle
[1:08:42] goes on inwardly
[1:08:45] is the two forces
[1:08:47] pulling at you
[1:08:49] now remember in those forces of that
[1:08:52] struggle
[1:08:53] he uses your five senses
[1:08:57] he uses your emotions and your mind your
[1:09:01] consciousness your thinking he's using
[1:09:03] all those things
[1:09:05] in that struggle to try to pull you
[1:09:08] he's trying to pull you he's trying to
[1:09:10] build a kingdom he wants satan wants you
[1:09:13] to be a part of his kingdom he wants you
[1:09:15] to be a part of his world he wants you
[1:09:18] to be a part of his education his
[1:09:20] civilization his science
[1:09:24] and then over on this side and he's got
[1:09:26] all these universities and professors
[1:09:28] and hospitals and all these buildings
[1:09:32] and everything that are out there
[1:09:34] that are
[1:09:35] he's offering you all his kingdoms
[1:09:40] because he he has to have some weight
[1:09:44] have you ever seen a tug of war
[1:09:48] they never put me on the end of the rope
[1:09:52] because i was a little guy
[1:09:56] he was always the guy to get in the mud
[1:09:58] first
[1:09:59] they picked the biggest guy they could
[1:10:01] get and they put him on the rope
[1:10:05] and that's what satan does he's got all
[1:10:07] the weight on his side of the rope
[1:10:10] you say well what's on god's side of the
[1:10:13] rope the thing that's on god's side of
[1:10:16] the rope is his expected end of you
[1:10:26] amen but it don't do us no good if we
[1:10:29] can't recognize it
[1:10:32] it doesn't it doesn't do it any good
[1:10:34] till we come to the spot in this
[1:10:37] struggle
[1:10:39] you understand that god has got
[1:10:42] something for me
[1:10:47] you're not going to enter into this life
[1:10:49] this christian life you're not going to
[1:10:52] enter into this
[1:10:54] the baptism of the holy spirit you're
[1:10:56] not going to keep going if you don't
[1:10:59] believe that god's got something for you
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:06] that he's got the spirit to give you
[1:11:09] that he's got victory to give you
[1:11:11] blessings to give you healing to give
[1:11:14] you deliverance to give you you won't
[1:11:16] you won't go if there's no benefit
[1:11:20] that's why in the resurrection that's
[1:11:22] what the prophet of god said he said
[1:11:24] when jesus rose from the dead the first
[1:11:28] thing he told his disciples were the
[1:11:30] benefits
[1:11:33] because i live
[1:11:35] you shall live also
[1:11:40] look the the struggle
[1:11:42] is there
[1:11:45] and the struggle's on
[1:11:47] and two sides are pulling at you
[1:11:50] and you're you're pressed in
[1:11:54] and you don't even know what's going on
[1:11:56] you've got this little teeny seed
[1:12:01] inside of you
[1:12:03] and it's struggling too
[1:12:07] did you know that
[1:12:10] satan comes and he pours a ton of
[1:12:12] concrete on you
[1:12:14] and now that little seed is struggling
[1:12:17] to get to that sunlight
[1:12:19] it's trying to find its place is trying
[1:12:23] to come out of the struggle
[1:12:27] now i don't want to sound
[1:12:29] discouraging
[1:12:32] by any means because
[1:12:35] you can see the struggle
[1:12:39] you know
[1:12:42] people struggle the most
[1:12:45] when they're trying to protect their own
[1:12:48] interests
[1:12:51] their own feelings
[1:12:54] their own emotions
[1:12:56] a selfish person really struggles
[1:13:00] a lot
[1:13:02] because they're so easily offended by
[1:13:05] everything that anybody says or does
[1:13:09] that they might that might uh in their
[1:13:11] life might make their life a little more
[1:13:14] inconvenient or or it's just not you're
[1:13:17] not making my life smooth
[1:13:19] and i want this and i want that that
[1:13:22] person's always going through a major
[1:13:24] struggle
[1:13:25] but the struggle's there
[1:13:28] the struggles there because the law of
[1:13:30] contrast is there the struggle's there
[1:13:33] because there's principalities and
[1:13:35] powers and spiritual wickedness in high
[1:13:38] places the struggle is there because you
[1:13:42] have something inside of you that is the
[1:13:45] seed of god
[1:13:46] and it is struggling for life also
[1:13:52] no matter
[1:13:53] how
[1:13:55] far you run
[1:13:56] into the world or how hard you try to
[1:13:59] get away from it it follows you
[1:14:04] sometimes you like to turn around to the
[1:14:06] seed and say give me a break
[1:14:10] and he said i'm not gonna give you a
[1:14:12] break
[1:14:14] i'm after you
[1:14:16] i'm going to overcome you
[1:14:19] i'm coming for you because you're mine
[1:14:26] now that's a struggle
[1:14:29] when you don't know who you are
[1:14:35] well you don't know whether i want to
[1:14:36] serve the world or serve god
[1:14:41] because we're in an age of lady osea
[1:14:44] where lukewarm don't work
[1:14:51] lukewarms religion
[1:14:54] lukewarms brick buildings on corners
[1:14:59] amen uh uh uh
[1:15:01] uh there's
[1:15:03] this this is a physical building but
[1:15:06] it's not the church
[1:15:08] there's not a holy church
[1:15:10] there's only a holy god
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:14] so that the struggle's there and that
[1:15:16] struggles inward
[1:15:20] now the struggle ceases
[1:15:26] when you make the choice
[1:15:30] all right
[1:15:31] i'm done struggling
[1:15:33] i'm done with this
[1:15:35] i'm not going down that highway anymore
[1:15:38] i'm not going to do that i'm going to
[1:15:40] break up with this boy
[1:15:42] this all this boy wants to do is take
[1:15:46] advantage of me
[1:15:48] all this boy wants to do is show me out
[1:15:50] to the
[1:15:51] the world you know what i mean all this
[1:15:54] boy is interested in is my innocence
[1:15:57] because every other girl out there has
[1:15:59] been taken advantage of so many times
[1:16:04] now that's the truth
[1:16:08] try to say it as appropriately as i can
[1:16:11] and the same thing on the brother's side
[1:16:13] the same thing on all of our side it's
[1:16:15] always that struggle
[1:16:18] but let me tell you when you finally
[1:16:20] come to the place that you've made that
[1:16:22] decision
[1:16:26] like we sang that song i ain't going
[1:16:28] back
[1:16:31] the struggle's over
[1:16:33] i'm not going back
[1:16:36] satan i'm done with you
[1:16:38] you're a liar
[1:16:40] you're the father of life
[1:16:42] that can your your all your army has a
[1:16:45] sickness and death and confusion
[1:16:48] and
[1:16:49] depression that's what your army brings
[1:16:52] i'm not a part of that anymore i'm done
[1:16:56] struggling
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:58] with that choice
[1:17:10] it's not bad to be in the struggle
[1:17:14] but i appreciated our sister's testimony
[1:17:16] so much i i'm going to go back and
[1:17:18] listen to it again just for myself
[1:17:24] but there came a time i'm done with this
[1:17:28] struggle
[1:17:32] i'm going to go be prayed for
[1:17:36] it doesn't come in a prayer line
[1:17:39] mine came on a rooftop
[1:17:46] mine come open in the bible
[1:17:50] and read in romans chapter 1
[1:17:52] and saying i'm done with this i remember
[1:17:55] i when i prayed i said god i don't know
[1:17:57] what i am
[1:18:00] but i'm not this
[1:18:04] i'm not going to be a biker
[1:18:06] i'm not going to be a drug dealer
[1:18:08] i'm not going to hang around with this
[1:18:10] people i'm not going to rob and join
[1:18:12] organized crying and others he brought
[1:18:15] me to the edge of decision
[1:18:20] you know what i mean
[1:18:21] there was a struggle now either i could
[1:18:24] end the struggle by choosing satan
[1:18:32] or i can end the struggle by choosing
[1:18:34] god
[1:18:36] but the struggle only comes to an end
[1:18:39] with a decision
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:46] otherwise you're double-minded
[1:18:50] you're tossed to and from
[1:18:54] this way that way
[1:18:56] this way that way
[1:18:58] sometimes you got to drive down the
[1:19:00] stake
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:05] this is what i'm going to live
[1:19:07] right i'm going to serve god amen
[1:19:10] so i'm going to set my tent up here
[1:19:15] and where he leads me
[1:19:17] i will follow
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:20] so you may be struggling
[1:19:23] and that's fine
[1:19:27] it's it's okay to struggle
[1:19:30] but understand the struggle
[1:19:33] what's the struggle for
[1:19:37] it's a struggle between
[1:19:40] truth
[1:19:41] and false light and darkness the true
[1:19:45] word of god and the untrue
[1:19:48] there's no such thing as a true what do
[1:19:50] you call that other thing a lie
[1:19:56] that's the struggle
[1:19:59] and when you make your decision
[1:20:02] the struggle's over
[1:20:05] but now you move into
[1:20:09] the battle that's right
[1:20:12] the struggles within
[1:20:16] when the decisions made
[1:20:19] now you enter the battle
[1:20:24] because now satan's back after you now
[1:20:27] now you've got an adversary
[1:20:30] right because you made a decision and
[1:20:33] you said i'm not going to serve you i'm
[1:20:35] not going to follow you i'm not going to
[1:20:38] listen to you i'm not going to listen to
[1:20:40] your music i'm not going to listen to
[1:20:42] your lies i'm not going to listen i have
[1:20:44] chosen god's holy word
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:55] all right
[1:20:56] the fight is on
[1:21:02] no more
[1:21:04] it's a whole lot tougher
[1:21:07] than the struggle
[1:21:11] it's a battle now
[1:21:17] it's a battle yes sir
[1:21:21] when jesus went up there in that 40 days
[1:21:24] in the wilderness what was he doing
[1:21:27] he was struggling
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:34] he's out there being tempted he's out
[1:21:36] there
[1:21:37] going through the struggle
[1:21:40] if thou be
[1:21:43] a christian
[1:21:48] oh i'll give you this
[1:21:52] that's what he does
[1:21:54] he offers everything the struggles on
[1:21:57] but jesus made a decision amen
[1:22:02] get behind me satan
[1:22:05] and now the battle was on
[1:22:08] and and the battle
[1:22:10] so
[1:22:11] it's important
[1:22:13] for me
[1:22:14] as a pastor
[1:22:17] even to
[1:22:18] to say to those of you
[1:22:21] that are coming out of the struggle
[1:22:24] i don't want you to think because the
[1:22:26] struggle's
[1:22:28] over
[1:22:29] that's the inward part
[1:22:32] the battle now moves to the outside
[1:22:36] now the battle's on
[1:22:41] he'll try to embarrass you
[1:22:44] he'll try to make you the fool
[1:22:47] he'll try to
[1:22:49] you know he'll tr he'll try to talk you
[1:22:51] out of every decision this very decision
[1:22:56] you made
[1:22:58] he wants to talk you out of it
[1:23:01] it's the battle that's right
[1:23:04] you don't have the struggle you thought
[1:23:05] well what's happened well what's
[1:23:07] happened the struggle has left the
[1:23:10] inside and now turned into a battle on
[1:23:14] the outside
[1:23:16] because you've identified
[1:23:19] you're adversary
[1:23:22] as long as the struggle's going on
[1:23:25] you don't really know which voice is
[1:23:27] true
[1:23:31] there's feelings of things things are
[1:23:33] pulling at you and everything and what
[1:23:35] does god do
[1:23:36] he's always salting that seed
[1:23:39] with a little bit of word here a little
[1:23:42] bit of word there a sermon here
[1:23:44] something here that deep inner gut
[1:23:47] feeling uh this bible calls that holy
[1:23:50] unction that keeps haunting you it's
[1:23:53] wrong it's right you know you're not
[1:23:55] right you know you shouldn't do this and
[1:23:57] you keep crossing that word over you
[1:24:00] keep running from it you struggling with
[1:24:03] it you go do what you do you feel
[1:24:05] miserable
[1:24:06] and and that oh my
[1:24:11] it's so good
[1:24:12] to be free
[1:24:15] he who is free
[1:24:17] is free indeed
[1:24:20] but now we move into the battle
[1:24:24] the battle is the outward
[1:24:28] the battle is the adversary
[1:24:31] trying to do everything he can to do to
[1:24:35] discredit you
[1:24:39] he makes you look at yourself
[1:24:43] if you can do one thing for your
[1:24:45] salvation jesus christ died in vain
[1:24:50] well you were yet a sinner he died for
[1:24:53] you
[1:24:56] in other words now you're in the battle
[1:24:59] so you've left the struggle for the
[1:25:02] battle
[1:25:03] but you can't enter a battle without a
[1:25:06] weapon
[1:25:11] you say well what was the struggle the
[1:25:14] struggle satan had his weapon
[1:25:18] it was called the world
[1:25:23] it was all the pleasures of the
[1:25:26] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[1:25:28] flesh the pride of life
[1:25:31] well the pride of life what is that my
[1:25:33] education my station my accomplishment
[1:25:38] my income level the house i live in
[1:25:42] something that represents some form of
[1:25:45] something that i've done
[1:25:49] wouldn't you rather live in a tent
[1:25:51] by a riverside and eat soda crackers and
[1:25:54] branch water
[1:25:56] and be filled with the spirit of god and
[1:25:59] know that god loves you there's no
[1:26:01] prestige
[1:26:02] who are you trying to impress
[1:26:05] that don't impress a christian
[1:26:10] amen
[1:26:12] that was satan's
[1:26:14] lie
[1:26:17] satan is trying to give people a false
[1:26:21] worth
[1:26:25] you hear me
[1:26:27] a false worth
[1:26:31] you're you're great
[1:26:33] i i i watch it in the few years that
[1:26:36] god's given me to live i've watched
[1:26:39] superstars come and go
[1:26:50] how many knows where kobe bryant is
[1:26:52] today
[1:26:58] i'm not his judge
[1:27:02] you know what i mean but he ain't the
[1:27:04] talk of the town
[1:27:07] it took
[1:27:09] that long
[1:27:12] all his dreams
[1:27:15] all his reputation
[1:27:17] everything is history
[1:27:19] it's in the history books
[1:27:22] and what's the final conclusion of his
[1:27:24] whole life
[1:27:26] is a wreck
[1:27:31] see satan tries to give us false worth
[1:27:35] so when in the struggle what was satan's
[1:27:38] weapon
[1:27:42] it was society
[1:27:44] it was
[1:27:44] civilization it was education
[1:27:48] it was
[1:27:48] offering you a way to fit into the world
[1:27:53] let me tell you what happens when the
[1:27:55] struggle's over
[1:27:56] you realize
[1:27:58] you don't
[1:28:00] fit
[1:28:04] that's what's wrong with you all
[1:28:08] right
[1:28:09] you're a bunch of oddballs
[1:28:13] you don't fit
[1:28:15] you'll never fit
[1:28:17] no matter how hard you try to fit you
[1:28:19] won't fit
[1:28:23] i'll say to this to my shame and i hope
[1:28:26] i don't embarrass my
[1:28:28] my daughter but
[1:28:30] you know
[1:28:32] we we
[1:28:34] worked all our lives pretty hard
[1:28:37] and uh
[1:28:38] and we didn't have a whole lot and i was
[1:28:41] able to get my daughter into a private
[1:28:43] school because i was building their
[1:28:44] gymnasium and building their field house
[1:28:47] and working and electrical and doing a
[1:28:49] bunch of things
[1:28:50] well you know and so
[1:28:52] uh
[1:28:55] so i i i i felt bad for her because we
[1:28:58] we didn't have the best clothes
[1:29:01] and we didn't have the best items to
[1:29:03] give so
[1:29:06] i i don't know school year finally came
[1:29:09] and i felt bad for her so
[1:29:12] i took her out and i forget what the
[1:29:14] fashion was back then but anyway it was
[1:29:16] a big top named fashion i bought her a
[1:29:17] whole gigantic wardrobe
[1:29:20] there was nobody on that campus
[1:29:25] that dressed as nice as she did
[1:29:29] you think that made her fit in
[1:29:33] it just pushed her to the other side
[1:29:40] and you know when i realize she'll never
[1:29:42] fit in
[1:29:43] she's a daughter of god
[1:29:46] he's got the seed of god we're not made
[1:29:48] to fit
[1:29:50] we're not made to fit
[1:29:53] they use intelligence to get work we use
[1:29:56] the grace of god to get work
[1:29:59] they use money to pay bills we use faith
[1:30:02] to pay bills
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:08] they use dr dobson and
[1:30:12] and all these tough love books and
[1:30:16] and all that to raise children we use
[1:30:18] the holy ghost
[1:30:24] let's face it
[1:30:25] we don't know what we're doing in this
[1:30:27] world
[1:30:30] we are the biggest bunch of clueless
[1:30:33] people that exist
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:39] you might think you're going to use your
[1:30:41] intelligence or your knowledge well let
[1:30:43] me tell you something god has built in
[1:30:46] you a handicap
[1:30:52] you've been disabled
[1:30:55] by the seed of god that's in your
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:02] you want to park here the word of god
[1:31:04] said sorry

[1:31:19] here you can you're not parking why
[1:31:21] can't i park there cause you're
[1:31:23] handicapped
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:29] oh i'm waiting for his team aren't you
[1:31:32] i'm waiting for the team that judged the
[1:31:34] world
[1:31:36] oh you're handicapped so we move from
[1:31:38] the struggle
[1:31:39] satan's weapon being all the things of
[1:31:41] the world you come out of the struggle
[1:31:44] now you're in the battle
[1:31:47] that's right he's going to fight against
[1:31:49] you
[1:31:50] he's going to lie against you he's going
[1:31:53] to bear false witness against you
[1:31:56] he's going to try to trap you
[1:31:58] david says he sets the snares before me
[1:32:01] you know what i mean so you now you've
[1:32:03] left the struggle you've made up your
[1:32:04] mind you made your decision now you're
[1:32:06] in the battle oh my the battle
[1:32:12] a lot of people get struck stuck right
[1:32:15] there
[1:32:16] because they never understood
[1:32:21] that
[1:32:22] life is a constant warfare
[1:32:26] it's a battle
[1:32:30] but god didn't equip us
[1:32:32] for the battle he gave us the best thing
[1:32:36] to fight the battle and that's his word
[1:32:42] that's his word we had a lovely uh
[1:32:45] brother's breakfast uh
[1:32:48] um
[1:32:50] there and and i invite all the brothers
[1:32:52] to come
[1:32:53] if you if you you can't come for the
[1:32:56] word's sake come for the burritos
[1:33:08] but
[1:33:11] if you
[1:33:12] testify
[1:33:14] and and and we we we we had this
[1:33:17] wonderful
[1:33:19] brother breakfast brothers breakfast
[1:33:21] about
[1:33:22] a
[1:33:24] testimony
[1:33:26] of a true witness
[1:33:28] and and everything testimony
[1:33:32] you can have a testimony and you can
[1:33:34] have an experience
[1:33:37] you can say i got delivered
[1:33:41] i i got saved i got the spirit was taken
[1:33:44] off me
[1:33:46] i prayed for somebody but you've got to
[1:33:49] take that back
[1:33:52] back to
[1:33:54] the word of god
[1:33:56] you've got to take that experience now
[1:33:59] this is exactly what the prophet of god
[1:34:01] taught i didn't bring the quote but he
[1:34:03] said you've got to take that experience
[1:34:06] and line it
[1:34:08] up with the words
[1:34:11] you've got to find that experience in
[1:34:14] the scripture
[1:34:16] so now it doesn't have
[1:34:18] a
[1:34:19] an identity
[1:34:21] outside of what god's done
[1:34:27] it can't be coincidence
[1:34:31] it can't be a blessing
[1:34:35] oh god blessed me
[1:34:38] according to what
[1:34:42] according to
[1:34:44] romans
[1:34:46] 5 and 8.
[1:34:51] according to
[1:34:53] philippians
[1:34:55] 2 and 10. i'm just pulling those
[1:34:57] scriptures up
[1:34:58] i could probably say
[1:35:00] second corinthians 21 and 6
[1:35:04] and somebody would go looking for it
[1:35:09] it's not there don't look
[1:35:13] but you've got to take it back to the
[1:35:15] word of god
[1:35:16] because once you've taken it back to the
[1:35:19] word of god
[1:35:21] now it's weaponized
[1:35:24] that's right
[1:35:27] you understand so you've got to
[1:35:29] weaponize your testimony
[1:35:35] because it's not the testimony of the
[1:35:38] end of the struggle
[1:35:40] that's the beginning of your testimony
[1:35:43] your testimony now is the word in the
[1:35:47] battle
[1:35:51] you've got to weaponize let me tell you
[1:35:54] too many christians
[1:35:57] never weaponized their testimony by
[1:36:00] bringing it back and anchoring it in the
[1:36:02] word where's faith's final resting place
[1:36:06] the word of god
[1:36:08] this happened to me
[1:36:10] because god
[1:36:12] said so
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:19] he can't rob that
[1:36:23] he can't rob that from you
[1:36:28] he can take your experience
[1:36:33] he can take your feeling
[1:36:36] but as long as you've got that
[1:36:37] experience anchored in the word you know
[1:36:41] that it's not
[1:36:42] the feeling might have been temporary
[1:36:44] but the victory is eternal
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:51] because you've angered it in eternity
[1:36:56] let me take it a step further
[1:36:58] the reason you can anchor it in eternity
[1:37:01] because that was god's expected end of
[1:37:05] the struggle
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:10] you didn't get out of the struggle
[1:37:14] he got you out of the struggle
[1:37:19] and how did he get you out of the
[1:37:21] struggle
[1:37:23] we'll say by grace
[1:37:25] by mercy
[1:37:27] he got you out of the struggle by his
[1:37:30] word
[1:37:34] you were his word
[1:37:36] and he couldn't deny himself
[1:37:40] amen
[1:37:42] [Applause]
[1:37:44] i know that the first thing satan does
[1:37:46] we
[1:37:49] satan is
[1:37:50] the rear-view mirror
[1:37:53] it's all he is
[1:37:56] he's a real vermeer
[1:37:58] he can only criticize where you've been
[1:38:03] because he don't have one revelation of
[1:38:05] where you're going
[1:38:10] he's not a part of it
[1:38:16] didn't even believe jesus was jesus
[1:38:19] that's right
[1:38:20] he believed his own lies
[1:38:24] so when he rose from the dead what do
[1:38:25] you think he went and did he went told
[1:38:27] another lie oh they stole his body
[1:38:31] i've meant the stolen body
[1:38:39] you they might have stole it but i found
[1:38:41] it
[1:38:42] hey man
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:45] right praise god
[1:38:47] so we we enter we leave the struggle
[1:38:51] into the battle
[1:38:54] now we got to realize now i'm in a
[1:38:55] battle
[1:38:57] now i've got to be weaponized
[1:39:00] i got i've taken the victory of my
[1:39:03] struggle
[1:39:04] i found myself
[1:39:08] in the scriptures
[1:39:09] now this is going to be important as we
[1:39:11] go to the next step
[1:39:13] because i found myself in the scriptures
[1:39:16] i've seen
[1:39:17] that i've become
[1:39:20] prophecy fulfilled
[1:39:27] you say what happened when you got saved
[1:39:29] my sheep heard my voice
[1:39:35] and they won't follow another
[1:39:39] that's all that happened
[1:39:41] well what were you
[1:39:43] well i i could tell you what i was what
[1:39:46] i was was in a struggle
[1:39:52] of what path i was going to take in life
[1:39:56] but i came out of the struggle
[1:40:00] because there was a purchase price paid
[1:40:04] for me
[1:40:08] you hear what i'm saying especially
[1:40:09] those one of you wonderful young people
[1:40:11] that have
[1:40:12] come out
[1:40:14] you know i i i i don't want to just clap
[1:40:17] with you and rejoice in you
[1:40:20] when you could
[1:40:22] i was i know how to say this just right
[1:40:25] but the spirit's like wine
[1:40:31] it stimulates you
[1:40:34] you understand and so many people
[1:40:37] they they when the battle comes
[1:40:40] they think it's a hangover
[1:40:43] i probably shouldn't use those
[1:40:44] terminologies but
[1:40:47] you know i'm just trying to reach out
[1:40:50] and let you understand
[1:40:53] when
[1:40:54] when the battle comes
[1:40:56] it doesn't mean it's over
[1:40:59] it doesn't mean you lost
[1:41:04] that's right
[1:41:05] you know what i mean it doesn't mean
[1:41:07] you're back in the struggle satan satan
[1:41:11] tries to tell you
[1:41:13] it's the same old struggle
[1:41:18] he tries to tell you it's the same old
[1:41:21] thing the same old spirit the same old
[1:41:24] devil the same old call but you've got
[1:41:27] to sit there and say no
[1:41:30] liar
[1:41:39] because jesus didn't fight him
[1:41:44] even with miracles
[1:41:47] he didn't fight him with an
[1:41:50] experience
[1:41:53] he didn't fight him with one thing he
[1:41:55] fought him with one thing only when he
[1:41:58] was in the struggle and he was getting
[1:42:01] the victory and he finally went from the
[1:42:03] struggle to the battle
[1:42:07] he said it
[1:42:09] is
[1:42:10] written amen
[1:42:12] and he left the struggle
[1:42:15] he entered into the battle
[1:42:18] he weaponized
[1:42:22] his experience
[1:42:24] with the eternal word
[1:42:26] now he had something that when would win
[1:42:28] the battle any place
[1:42:31] any time
[1:42:32] anywhere
[1:42:35] doesn't matter what it is
[1:42:39] it's not what you're fighting it's how
[1:42:42] you're fighting it
[1:42:49] have you ever played charades
[1:42:52] i think that's a game right where you
[1:42:54] say something to this person he tells it
[1:42:56] and he tells it and he tells it and he
[1:42:58] tells it and when it gets down here it's
[1:43:00] like tenth hand experience
[1:43:03] you know
[1:43:06] and
[1:43:07] uh the first one was a rabbit
[1:43:11] run into the bush
[1:43:14] and then when it gets down to the other
[1:43:17] end it's the bushmen of australia were
[1:43:19] hunting rabbits
[1:43:21] it's nowhere near the same
[1:43:25] so if
[1:43:26] it's an experience from god
[1:43:29] it's got to be a word experience
[1:43:33] because the word's the only thing that's
[1:43:35] eternal heaven and earth will pass away
[1:43:38] but my word won't be eternal
[1:43:40] and then when you come to that place
[1:43:43] in the battle where you've weaponized
[1:43:46] your experience you've taken hold of the
[1:43:49] atomic bomb
[1:43:51] of god's word
[1:43:52] you you're operating this word by faith
[1:43:56] because now you're going to have the
[1:43:58] experience that's greater than the
[1:44:01] experience of deliverance you're going
[1:44:03] to have the experience of defeating
[1:44:06] satan
[1:44:10] oh that's fun
[1:44:14] i like that
[1:44:16] i like seeing people healed i like
[1:44:18] seeing devils coming out of you i like
[1:44:21] seeing people get filled with the holy
[1:44:22] ghost
[1:44:25] billy paul is telling the story you
[1:44:27] heard it he told it here that's why i'm
[1:44:29] telling it
[1:44:30] he said
[1:44:31] brother bosworth is always back there
[1:44:33] mumbling
[1:44:37] billy couldn't take it anymore he said
[1:44:40] he said he finally said brother bob what
[1:44:42] are you saying oh he's saying i'm saying
[1:44:45] poor devil
[1:44:48] poor devil
[1:44:50] where did we get this affinity
[1:44:53] and this love
[1:44:55] and this respect for the devil
[1:45:05] the fear of the devil
[1:45:07] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:45:10] you've never read that scripture
[1:45:18] it is
[1:45:20] first luther lucifer 3 and 14.
[1:45:31] the fear of the devil
[1:45:34] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:45:37] certainly
[1:45:40] who do you think created these
[1:45:41] skyscrapers
[1:45:48] look at how smart who do you think
[1:45:50] created those smartphones and those cell
[1:45:52] phones and all that stuff
[1:45:55] the only trouble is they're not eternal
[1:45:59] and god can't create something that's
[1:46:02] not eternal
[1:46:08] makes me glad my name's on the lamb's
[1:46:10] book of life
[1:46:14] i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i
[1:46:16] should be but i'm not what i used to be
[1:46:19] either
[1:46:21] so we
[1:46:22] we come into a battle now
[1:46:27] we're free from the struggle that's our
[1:46:29] testimony i'm free from the struggle
[1:46:33] but what happens when that's ten years
[1:46:35] ago
[1:46:44] you've got a living testimony
[1:46:46] or a historical testimony
[1:46:52] now you've got a new testimony
[1:46:54] it's not the testimony of the struggle
[1:46:57] it's the testimony of the battle
[1:47:03] satan came against
[1:47:06] me but i stayed with god's word
[1:47:12] many christians ask why they get sick
[1:47:15] or if i was a christian
[1:47:17] why did i get sick
[1:47:20] you know the prophet of god said he
[1:47:22] answered that question i think it's
[1:47:24] improving his word if you can go find it
[1:47:26] and read it he says don't we know that
[1:47:28] all things work together for the good
[1:47:30] who love the lord
[1:47:32] amen all right
[1:47:35] can only fight satan
[1:47:38] with one thing
[1:47:39] there's only one weapon
[1:47:43] that works
[1:47:45] for god's children and that's the word
[1:47:48] and we have a promise that no weapon
[1:47:52] that's devised against us
[1:47:54] will be successful
[1:47:58] so now we enter into the battle let's
[1:48:00] move on and i'll close because i want to
[1:48:03] get to the testimonies i want to hear so
[1:48:05] testimony so bad testimony service will
[1:48:08] begin at two o'clock
[1:48:15] five o'clock beautiful
[1:48:19] from battle
[1:48:21] to burden
[1:48:26] amen
[1:48:28] this is where
[1:48:31] a person that's maybe been in the fight
[1:48:33] longer
[1:48:37] many times
[1:48:38] stumbles
[1:48:42] but a burden is all of a sudden it's
[1:48:46] what it is
[1:48:48] it's like a burden
[1:48:50] it's a weight that comes on you
[1:48:53] it's it's
[1:48:55] sometimes maybe it's a heaviness of
[1:48:58] heart
[1:49:00] maybe sometimes it's a loss of direction
[1:49:06] maybe sometimes it's a burden to
[1:49:10] to move up higher
[1:49:14] you you feel like i'm a christian
[1:49:17] you know i i've tried to live my life
[1:49:19] and i look back and i see where he saved
[1:49:23] me and where i came out of my struggle
[1:49:26] and i've seen how many times he's fought
[1:49:29] for me and
[1:49:30] saved my children and healed the the
[1:49:33] sick and i've seen people delivered of
[1:49:36] this and i've seen delivered of that
[1:49:39] lord i've seen so many things and yet
[1:49:42] why am i here
[1:49:46] with such a hunger on my heart for more
[1:49:51] such a burden
[1:49:55] because
[1:49:57] it is a burden
[1:50:01] it's a burden he wants to bear with you
[1:50:08] that burden's there
[1:50:11] maybe a lot of times we find out that
[1:50:14] we've come to that
[1:50:16] that
[1:50:18] uh
[1:50:19] part in our life that
[1:50:21] that
[1:50:22] the the battle we we've we've
[1:50:24] established our fork
[1:50:27] in god's word
[1:50:31] we read our scriptures
[1:50:37] but
[1:50:44] that's still you
[1:50:49] you're battling for yourself
[1:50:53] your deliverance was for yourself
[1:50:55] you'll find out that the next part of
[1:50:58] christianity is that burden
[1:51:00] or it's no longer about you
[1:51:05] let this mind
[1:51:06] that was in christ be in you
[1:51:09] it's burden time
[1:51:12] all of a sudden you find yourself in
[1:51:15] that i'm carrying burdens
[1:51:19] i'm burdened
[1:51:20] i'm burdened for my loss
[1:51:23] the children
[1:51:25] i i'm burdened for i appreciated camp
[1:51:28] the testimonies that came back if people
[1:51:31] said oh i was at camp and i was just
[1:51:33] praying so much for
[1:51:36] uh
[1:51:36] for for somebody you know to uh
[1:51:39] just just got delivered like like
[1:51:43] uh gregory said oh christian was over
[1:51:46] there praying that great it up his game
[1:51:51] what happened
[1:51:53] a burden came amen
[1:51:57] a load came
[1:51:59] you know why a load comes because it's
[1:52:02] something that's got to be moved
[1:52:07] it's something that's got to be taken
[1:52:09] out of the way
[1:52:13] ephesians 2 and 10
[1:52:16] says we are his workmanship in christ
[1:52:18] jesus foreordained unto good works that
[1:52:22] we should walk in them
[1:52:27] you ever
[1:52:29] ask yourself this is just our family
[1:52:31] here
[1:52:32] you ever ask yourself
[1:52:35] like how do i know that
[1:52:41] how
[1:52:42] how do i know what is the good work
[1:52:45] that i should do
[1:52:50] you know we all want to go back
[1:52:53] and and have
[1:52:56] some sort of motion picture
[1:53:01] vision
[1:53:04] where we're going into hospitals and
[1:53:06] we're taking people by the hands how
[1:53:08] many has ever emptied the whole hospital
[1:53:10] out in your dreams
[1:53:12] you're so spiritual you know that you're
[1:53:14] walking and people are just flying out
[1:53:16] of beds
[1:53:18] and
[1:53:19] and then you wake up and find out you're
[1:53:22] still a human
[1:53:26] it's a burden
[1:53:28] god moves his church by burden
[1:53:36] he puts it on your
[1:53:38] heart amen
[1:53:43] now
[1:53:44] you win
[1:53:47] the burden
[1:53:50] with the same thing you win the battle
[1:53:53] now the burden becomes part of the
[1:53:56] battle
[1:53:58] the first battle that i was talking
[1:54:01] about is the battle for yourself
[1:54:06] right
[1:54:07] satan is trying to recover
[1:54:10] what he thought was his what's that song
[1:54:12] we said satan
[1:54:14] a sinner that satan thought he had you
[1:54:16] know i guess is that praise god my sins
[1:54:19] are gone satan lost the sinner that he
[1:54:21] thought he had
[1:54:23] the the
[1:54:25] battle that you enter into from the
[1:54:28] struggle
[1:54:29] is the battle of preservation
[1:54:35] you're fighting satan
[1:54:37] off from trying to reclaim you and
[1:54:40] recover you
[1:54:42] he'll lie to you oh you never got saved
[1:54:45] look at that you looked at that picture
[1:54:47] and you felt that little
[1:54:49] lust spirit come on you fight
[1:54:57] don't give in
[1:55:01] that's what the scripture says take this
[1:55:03] take because sin is when a man's drawn
[1:55:06] off by his own lust
[1:55:08] but when it's conceived
[1:55:11] then it becomes unbelief
[1:55:14] but that's why you got your sword
[1:55:18] put on the whole armor of god
[1:55:23] but the burden now
[1:55:27] and
[1:55:29] the reason
[1:55:30] that
[1:55:32] i'm coming to this point
[1:55:36] is that
[1:55:38] i believe the church
[1:55:41] has moved to
[1:55:44] a place
[1:55:45] of a new testimony
[1:55:54] our testimony is always god did this for
[1:55:56] me god did that
[1:56:00] for me
[1:56:02] it always has to do with
[1:56:04] my flesh
[1:56:07] my flesh was in a struggle god brought
[1:56:09] me out of the struggle
[1:56:11] satan tried to bring me back in i fought
[1:56:13] it off
[1:56:15] satan offered me this satan did this
[1:56:17] satan did this i i fought it off i
[1:56:20] followed but that's always
[1:56:22] it's always i thought for myself
[1:56:28] you know what i mean i i wish good
[1:56:32] satan
[1:56:33] and how many knows that if you're with
[1:56:35] dan satan he will what
[1:56:37] he'll flee
[1:56:42] now you're a mighty army
[1:56:46] we've taken
[1:56:48] our plowshares
[1:56:50] and we beat them in
[1:56:52] to swords
[1:56:54] now we're going to be the church of the
[1:56:56] burden
[1:56:59] probably god said when a church loses
[1:57:02] its burden
[1:57:04] for lost souls
[1:57:05] it loses its
[1:57:08] spirituality that's right
[1:57:11] when they lose their burden
[1:57:14] for the sick
[1:57:17] who satan's got bound by diseases and
[1:57:21] sicknesses that's the devil
[1:57:27] so how do you move
[1:57:31] and a lot of these questions are on my
[1:57:34] heart and i ask your prayer
[1:57:37] but how do you move out of that
[1:57:40] battle
[1:57:42] of of where well
[1:57:47] how do i stand up against this or
[1:57:50] how do i fight against this i mean i i
[1:57:52] just should learn to accept this or i
[1:57:54] just should learn to accept that or it's
[1:57:58] all in god's hands
[1:58:02] but the burden
[1:58:04] that i'm talking about is god
[1:58:07] transferring
[1:58:10] what he wants
[1:58:12] to accomplish
[1:58:14] unto the hearts
[1:58:17] of his children
[1:58:21] amen
[1:58:23] there's this soul over here
[1:58:27] lord we know you can go save that soul
[1:58:29] lord we know you can take them out of
[1:58:31] their struggle we know you can do that
[1:58:34] but now he's finally got a people that's
[1:58:36] called out he's finally got a people
[1:58:39] that's been separated he's gone he got a
[1:58:41] people that got the weapon in their hand
[1:58:44] and he finally tells his church the
[1:58:46] works that i do shall you do also
[1:58:54] how do you think jesus got to the woman
[1:58:56] at the well
[1:59:01] he got burdened
[1:59:05] i have need to go by there
[1:59:10] you don't want to go down there lori
[1:59:12] no i've got neat i'm burdened
[1:59:17] he got down there and he waited
[1:59:22] i don't know who else come by
[1:59:25] but finally the one that came by
[1:59:27] that he was burdened for
[1:59:31] how great was his burden for her
[1:59:34] we're still telling the story
[1:59:39] it became the identification of the
[1:59:41] ministry of the son of man in our day
[1:59:48] how about the widow
[1:59:54] so the burden
[1:59:57] the church moves from the battle
[2:00:00] of self-preservation
[2:00:03] in to
[2:00:06] the burden
[2:00:10] i care about this person
[2:00:13] i want i don't want satan destroying
[2:00:17] this person's life
[2:00:19] you young people that come out at camp
[2:00:24] i know satan
[2:00:27] it makes you
[2:00:30] that oddball feeling you get when
[2:00:33] there's so much peer pressure and
[2:00:36] there's so much trending stuff that's
[2:00:39] going on but let me tell you the boys
[2:00:42] and the girls around you are in a mental
[2:00:44] struggle that they don't understand
[2:00:48] and you're the only one that can explain
[2:00:50] it to them
[2:00:51] and lay it out they're really what's
[2:00:53] happening
[2:00:54] because satan is wrestling for their
[2:00:56] soul
[2:00:59] he's fighting for their mind
[2:01:04] how bad is this
[2:01:06] struggle they want to teach
[2:01:09] kindergartners
[2:01:11] first second and third graders
[2:01:15] about gender identity
[2:01:23] we need to move into the burden stage
[2:01:28] we need to come out of the battle
[2:01:32] and accept the burden
[2:01:34] and start fighting
[2:01:36] for others
[2:01:38] [Music]
[2:01:41] without fear
[2:01:44] we do not have fear of failure you
[2:01:47] understand success and failure all
[2:01:50] launches
[2:01:52] from the same platform from the same
[2:01:55] spot
[2:01:57] when you stand to make a decision
[2:02:00] you're faced with two things
[2:02:05] fear of failure
[2:02:07] or victory
[2:02:12] you'll never
[2:02:13] move from that
[2:02:17] when you pray for the sick
[2:02:20] i hope i'm
[2:02:23] you're not missing it but let's say i'm
[2:02:25] going to pray for billy
[2:02:28] he's sick i'm not saying he's sick but
[2:02:33] and i'm going to lay my hands on prayer
[2:02:35] now right now
[2:02:38] he's either going to get well
[2:02:41] right
[2:02:43] or he's not
[2:02:47] and i know we got that co
[2:02:48] quote
[2:02:49] all loaded up in our minds if he drops
[2:02:52] dead i'll pray for the next one
[2:02:54] they'll probably drop dead too
[2:02:58] because there's something lacking
[2:03:02] there's a whole lot of difference
[2:03:06] when i sit down and witness the gospel
[2:03:09] not for the gospel's sake alone
[2:03:12] but because i have a burden on my heart
[2:03:17] for billy
[2:03:21] the battle's not about me
[2:03:24] the battles the lords
[2:03:29] you understand this egypt this is the
[2:03:33] egyptian army that you fear so much this
[2:03:36] army will you see no more
[2:03:40] forever the lord will fight
[2:03:44] and the only thing that's going to start
[2:03:46] moving this church into the real works
[2:03:49] they should do is when they have the
[2:03:52] burden of the lord jesus in their hearts
[2:03:58] it's beyond
[2:04:00] the struggle
[2:04:06] it's beyond
[2:04:08] the battle
[2:04:10] i hope i've been able to describe those
[2:04:12] steps
[2:04:16] if you're driven
[2:04:19] by burden
[2:04:22] i can't stand
[2:04:24] to see this person in this condition
[2:04:28] anymore
[2:04:36] you know what satan wants to do wants to
[2:04:37] put you back through the process
[2:04:40] back through the struggle
[2:04:42] back through the battle
[2:04:47] but when we start acting upon burden
[2:04:53] we'll see victory
[2:04:57] because the word
[2:04:58] never
[2:05:00] fails
[2:05:02] when you yield your weapon
[2:05:04] for others
[2:05:08] remember the little blind man in mexico
[2:05:11] he came up to our messenger
[2:05:16] and
[2:05:17] so he comes up to our messenger
[2:05:20] and
[2:05:25] the prophet of god looks at him and he
[2:05:27] doesn't have no shoes
[2:05:31] what is he doing
[2:05:33] he's entering into the burden
[2:05:36] he says this man could be my father
[2:05:39] and he looked over and he put his foot
[2:05:43] up against his
[2:05:45] and he said he walked barefoot he had a
[2:05:47] wide foot i had a narrow foot
[2:05:50] i looked at my coat and he said it would
[2:05:52] have
[2:05:52] swamped him
[2:05:54] he entered into that burden
[2:06:00] and when he entered into that burden
[2:06:04] he took the word of god
[2:06:07] and applied the word of god
[2:06:10] to the burden
[2:06:13] the burden
[2:06:14] is god's way
[2:06:17] of leading you
[2:06:24] we just don't pick random works
[2:06:29] out of the sky
[2:06:30] right
[2:06:32] here pull pull
[2:06:34] okay that's
[2:06:36] go witness
[2:06:40] let's give brother mcgeary an offering
[2:06:46] you just don't pull random works
[2:06:52] you you understand what i'm saying i'm
[2:06:54] talking about i'm looking for a church
[2:06:56] that starts is going to have a new
[2:06:58] testimony
[2:06:59] all right
[2:07:00] the testimony of we testified to this
[2:07:02] person and they got healed we testified
[2:07:06] this person and they got baptized you
[2:07:08] can you know why they're doing all this
[2:07:10] work downtown and we've seen these
[2:07:12] baptized because joseph gordon one day
[2:07:14] sitting in his house he said somebody
[2:07:17] just came in here and i never said
[2:07:18] nothing to him about the lord and he got
[2:07:21] burdened
[2:07:25] and the burden began to eat them up
[2:07:31] you know what he said he hadn't left
[2:07:34] my driveway yet
[2:07:42] what's happening to us
[2:07:47] the holy spirit places unction
[2:07:50] on our heart
[2:07:52] to stand for something
[2:07:55] well
[2:07:56] i don't i can understand this not
[2:07:59] knowing what to do
[2:08:01] but when you start nick he's starting to
[2:08:03] hand out burdens
[2:08:09] you hear me
[2:08:12] he's starting to hand out burdens he's
[2:08:14] starting to face as god wants to move
[2:08:16] because he's got to represent this bride
[2:08:20] he's got to prove because he said that
[2:08:24] she would be the last voice of this
[2:08:26] dying generation he said this bride
[2:08:28] would have the same heart the same mind
[2:08:31] the same spirit that he had he'd have
[2:08:34] the same word in fact this bride would
[2:08:37] be him reincarnated
[2:08:39] in flesh
[2:08:43] how is he going to get that message to
[2:08:45] us
[2:08:47] by
[2:08:48] burden burdens aren't the lack of
[2:08:51] something
[2:08:54] they're the cry
[2:08:56] of the needy
[2:09:00] they're blind burn mess they're the
[2:09:02] woman at the well
[2:09:05] they're the leopards
[2:09:07] they're the demon controlled
[2:09:10] person
[2:09:14] they're jairus's daughter
[2:09:18] every single one of them was a burden
[2:09:24] that was moved upon
[2:09:27] god's passing out burden i'm closing
[2:09:36] i had so much that uh
[2:09:38] i wanted to read
[2:09:41] but god's getting
[2:09:42] burdened
[2:09:44] because victory
[2:09:47] comes from burden
[2:09:52] victory
[2:09:54] is the visible witness
[2:09:57] of the word of god made flesh
[2:10:06] and to testify
[2:10:10] i laid my hands
[2:10:12] on this person
[2:10:15] they were so burdened
[2:10:20] and i don't think we have to give a
[2:10:22] litany
[2:10:24] to go back and
[2:10:26] and
[2:10:27] and i could tell you so many times in my
[2:10:30] life that i've seen
[2:10:31] the hand of the lord move
[2:10:34] and i just recognize this
[2:10:37] that every time i've seen god do
[2:10:39] something it's because my heart was so
[2:10:42] burdened
[2:10:47] in mexico when we went to pray for that
[2:10:50] we were down in this camp down way down
[2:10:53] in
[2:10:56] guess it was way down in oaxaca and the
[2:10:58] native villages there in this brush
[2:11:00] harbor medium
[2:11:02] they come and rousted me out of the
[2:11:04] camper i'd preach
[2:11:05] 22 services in 28 days and
[2:11:09] was sick
[2:11:13] i was weak
[2:11:15] and they
[2:11:16] needed us to come pray i was with jerry
[2:11:18] dalton
[2:11:20] and
[2:11:21] so we got out of the camper and started
[2:11:23] to walk i put on what i had some shoes
[2:11:26] slipped on
[2:11:27] and i'm telling you they were climbing
[2:11:29] the swiss alps
[2:11:33] it was steep it was a long one the full
[2:11:36] moon was shining dogs were coming up to
[2:11:39] the gate it almost felt biblical
[2:11:43] and we went up these trails and
[2:11:44] everything and finally we come into this
[2:11:46] place and this lady was there
[2:11:49] and she had given birth to a baby
[2:11:53] and its legs were crossed
[2:11:56] i'm not a medical doctor i don't
[2:11:58] know anything about it but i know one
[2:12:01] thing
[2:12:03] those people were burdened
[2:12:08] they were burdened
[2:12:11] it's a deep calling to the deep
[2:12:15] when you get a burden for somebody how
[2:12:17] many caught that in the tape the other
[2:12:19] day
[2:12:20] there's the evil spirit
[2:12:23] that's right going back and forth
[2:12:26] it was one
[2:12:28] gallbladder condition
[2:12:30] screaming out to another
[2:12:32] gallbladder condition
[2:12:34] he called them out and they were both
[2:12:36] healed when you get a burden
[2:12:39] there's somebody there that's burdened
[2:12:42] it's a deep calling to a deep
[2:12:45] if somebody's calling up how many men
[2:12:48] that lady come up and she said i see you
[2:12:50] dropping things remember i see you
[2:12:52] sitting at this chair and you're picking
[2:12:54] up and you're dropping things over and
[2:12:56] over again the doctor said this and in
[2:12:59] and
[2:13:00] he
[2:13:01] he just testified that she was healed
[2:13:04] and then he looked out and he says it's
[2:13:05] all over the building
[2:13:08] you you you you you you've all you all
[2:13:11] suffer from the same things your nerves
[2:13:13] you can't hold on to everything you're
[2:13:15] dropping you're all healed
[2:13:20] it's a burden
[2:13:21] the identification of burden
[2:13:25] and
[2:13:26] god is going to start moving on this
[2:13:30] body by burden
[2:13:32] [Music]
[2:13:34] burden for one another
[2:13:37] burden for the loss burden for the sick
[2:13:40] burden for jobs burden for financial
[2:13:43] thing
[2:13:44] it's no more you in your own battle
[2:13:55] it's freely been given freely give
[2:14:02] we prayed for that child because when i
[2:14:05] saw him my heart broke
[2:14:08] right
[2:14:10] i i can't sit and tell you that i was
[2:14:13] expecting anything to happen
[2:14:18] because i didn't pray
[2:14:23] from
[2:14:25] the placement
[2:14:27] of expectation
[2:14:30] i'd like to get to that place
[2:14:33] this was 20 years ago
[2:14:35] but i prayed from the aspect that i was
[2:14:38] so burdened that satan had did that to
[2:14:41] that child and did that to that mother
[2:14:45] that the heart that was in me
[2:14:48] the love of god shed abroad in my heart
[2:14:51] by the holy spirit i just couldn't see
[2:14:55] how god
[2:14:57] would let that kid go through life
[2:15:00] never running
[2:15:02] i didn't have a vision
[2:15:06] i didn't feel no power i was as sick as
[2:15:08] a dog
[2:15:11] but we prayed for that baby and it got
[2:15:13] well and that mother got up
[2:15:17] because of a burden
[2:15:20] god
[2:15:21] moves his church by burden
[2:15:25] and what follows burden
[2:15:30] victory
[2:15:33] the word being manifested in flesh
[2:15:37] that's victory the word being manifested
[2:15:40] in you
[2:15:41] because
[2:15:43] you were out of your struggle
[2:15:45] you have fought the battle against satan
[2:15:48] and now you've moved to the place where
[2:15:50] this is no longer about you but it's
[2:15:53] about others
[2:15:56] and you haven't lived till you live for
[2:15:59] others
[2:15:59] you say who can be burdened a
[2:16:02] six-year-old
[2:16:04] can be burdened
[2:16:11] in my car many a times the kids would
[2:16:13] say daddy that person's hungry could you
[2:16:16] give them some money
[2:16:19] and i thought that's just a bum
[2:16:23] i'm not going to give them a nickel
[2:16:26] no but i'd roll down the window
[2:16:28] and give them something because the kids
[2:16:32] were burdened
[2:16:35] if we keep throwing off our burdens
[2:16:39] all's we're gonna be as a bunch of
[2:16:41] talkers
[2:16:46] we'll have no new testimony
[2:16:50] but the old testimony
[2:16:52] it'll be another bunch of testimonies
[2:16:56] about
[2:16:57] the great
[2:16:58] struggle
[2:17:00] it'll be another bunch of testimonies
[2:17:03] about the great
[2:17:04] battle
[2:17:06] but i'm looking for victory testimonies
[2:17:09] of the great burden
[2:17:12] do you want to rise to the challenge
[2:17:16] do you want to apply the token to your
[2:17:18] lives
[2:17:19] to your houses to your heart
[2:17:23] do you want to take on philippians
[2:17:26] let this mind be in you
[2:17:28] that was in christ jesus let every man
[2:17:31] look on the needs of the others and not
[2:17:33] his own
[2:17:35] you want to see
[2:17:38] the works
[2:17:41] that have been assigned to us
[2:17:45] do you want to see the works
[2:17:48] that you've been for ordained to do
[2:17:51] god's going to deliver that to you
[2:17:55] by way of burden

[2:18:05] victory for your children victory for
[2:18:07] your neighbor

[2:18:30] about the healing power of god he said
[2:18:32] well what happens if they don't listen
[2:18:34] that you know an answer care what they
