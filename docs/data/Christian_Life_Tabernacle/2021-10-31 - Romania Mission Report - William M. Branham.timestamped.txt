[24:29] perilous hour
[24:32] father we've come to fellowship tonight
[24:34] and we just ask that you bless our
[24:35] evening may it be a wonderful time may
[24:39] our hearts be lifted we ask these things
[24:41] in jesus name we pray amen man god bless
[24:45] you may be seated
[24:48] we're been at uh
[24:51] have a little
[24:53] special evening to
[24:55] night and
[24:57] i'm glad that you've come out
[25:00] and we're going to have a report
[25:03] on the missionary
[25:05] trip
[25:07] or the trip to romania we refer to them
[25:10] as
[25:11] missionaries there are believers there
[25:13] but
[25:16] about our effort here as our
[25:18] congregation
[25:20] trying to help the brothers and sisters
[25:22] in romania
[25:24] spread the gospel
[25:26] and so matthew and cosman are going to
[25:29] share
[25:30] with us their trip
[25:32] and then because you all came out
[25:35] tonight
[25:36] you'll get a sample
[25:38] of some romanian food and we call it a
[25:43] snap sample
[25:46] there's some egg
[25:48] not egg rolls
[25:49] cabbage rolls a wrong country
[25:52] we're not sponsoring any egg roll people
[25:56] at this time
[25:57] but cabbage rolls some romanian
[26:00] meatballs
[26:01] and some soup and bread
[26:04] and that'll be served to you right here
[26:06] in the back
[26:07] after service so i think that's a little
[26:09] extra
[26:10] thing you know sometimes we talk about
[26:12] the spiritual food and the spiritual
[26:15] food types the natural food
[26:17] but once you taste this food everybody's
[26:20] gonna want to be a missionary
[26:24] to romania so uh
[26:28] i i was a little weary this morning but
[26:31] i was in invited over for a fantastic
[26:34] dinner this afternoon and that just
[26:36] refreshed me and
[26:38] and after eating two and a half pounds
[26:40] of brisket i i feel really good
[26:44] so
[26:46] we're grateful for that but one thing
[26:48] that we'd probably recommend
[26:51] is if you're
[26:53] kind of farther back
[26:55] when we make the switch in the service
[26:58] maybe you might want to come up and fill
[27:00] in some of these empty spots and so you
[27:03] might want to be able to see better so
[27:05] that's just a recommendation that if you
[27:07] want to
[27:09] see it just kind of move
[27:11] up closer you know that is our
[27:14] commission
[27:15] is to go into all the world
[27:17] and preach the gospel and
[27:20] you never know
[27:22] when the word of god is going to
[27:25] move and touch
[27:26] somebody's heart
[27:28] you noticed in the tape today the
[27:30] prophet of god talked about
[27:33] the them refusing to go over into the
[27:35] promised land
[27:37] but he made a statement he said but lord
[27:39] they had the opportunity
[27:41] and you can never
[27:43] force people to choose
[27:46] the only thing you can do is present to
[27:48] them
[27:49] the opportunity
[27:50] and one day it may be their last
[27:53] opportunity but we don't know that so we
[27:57] continue to present the opportunity to
[28:00] as many people as we can
[28:02] to hear the word of god and to support
[28:06] anybody that goes out
[28:08] and of course cosmin being able to speak
[28:11] romanian it made us a great asset and it
[28:14] also gives us a wonderful opportunity to
[28:18] go
[28:20] to that country and and have some
[28:23] real fruit so
[28:24] uh i'm going to invite uh cosmic matthew
[28:27] this time so if you'd like to move up a
[28:30] little closer
[28:31] you just do that if you're so
[28:33] comfortable in your seat
[28:35] okay maybe when you start seeing it
[28:37] you'll want to move up closer but don't
[28:39] be ashamed
[28:40] to move up closer and and be able to see
[28:43] it so uh
[28:45] then after right after the the
[28:48] presentation this evening uh we'll come
[28:51] up and bless the food
[28:52] and then
[28:53] we'd like to let all the adults
[28:56] go first so
[28:59] we kind of keep the children this might
[29:01] not be exactly the kind of food the
[29:03] children think so
[29:06] natalie you can go first since it's your
[29:08] birthday
[29:10] amen
[29:11] natalie why don't you stand up so we can
[29:13] i'll tell you
[29:20] uh
[29:21] you know she is a little miracle
[29:24] so it's it's so wonderful and she's just
[29:27] been such a little shining light and
[29:30] and everything i really appreciate her
[29:32] and it just tells you what god can do i
[29:34] don't think she was any bigger in this
[29:36] tissue box was she
[29:38] she probably this could have been your
[29:40] bed
[29:41] all we had to do is cut the top of this
[29:44] out and we could have put you on those
[29:46] soft
[29:47] uh
[29:49] soft
[29:50] kleenex in there and you'd have been
[29:52] comfortable
[29:53] but god's mercy and grace
[29:56] shied down upon us and
[29:59] we want to keep a brother
[30:01] mike and sister liz in prayer
[30:03] because now she's a teenager
[30:06] and uh
[30:08] teenagers uh are a little wiser at that
[30:11] age and
[30:13] they uh
[30:15] they have so much to offer that we've
[30:18] just got to learn to accept their advice
[30:21] as we
[30:22] as we go through life so
[30:24] we're we're grateful for that
[30:26] and
[30:28] it's
[30:29] it's kind of sad in one way for me
[30:31] because this would have been her last
[30:33] year in our sunday school now she's
[30:35] moving up
[30:36] to our young peoples but yet we haven't
[30:39] been able to have sunday school and
[30:42] things so
[30:44] we don't have anybody now that helps us
[30:47] with sunday school
[30:48] so we need to pray that somebody can
[30:51] puts that burden on their heart
[30:53] to help with our young people and our
[30:55] sunday school and
[30:57] and especially our kids from four to
[31:00] twelve and
[31:01] maybe by the grace of god by this time
[31:03] next year we'll be pretty much into our
[31:05] facility
[31:07] so we just trust god for everything so
[31:09] let's just have a wonderful evening
[31:12] and uh
[31:14] if if
[31:15] is there any way if that somebody has a
[31:17] question that they could raise their
[31:19] hand and you could handle it sure sure
[31:21] if you have a question about something
[31:24] and uh
[31:25] and you just
[31:26] just raise your hand you know what i
[31:28] mean and it'll be good but anyway so god
[31:32] bless you tonight enjoy this time of
[31:34] fellowship
[31:36] in the service and
[31:38] i would tell you where our
[31:41] romanian food came from but i'm afraid
[31:44] you'd be over there every day
[31:47] so
[31:48] we just have to measure this
[31:51] just right so god bless you tonight
[31:53] god's good
[31:54] brother matthew husband we thank you for
[31:56] your trip and
[31:58] share with us your experience

[32:11] presence as we just go through some of
[32:13] the things that god is doing we just
[32:14] want to read out of
[32:16] the book of mark and we'll just read the
[32:18] great commission here found in chapter
[32:20] 16
[32:22] and verse 15 we're all familiar with it
[32:24] and it's very fitting for
[32:27] the message that we heard this morning
[32:31] and for the trip that we are on
[32:33] it reads and he said unto them go ye
[32:35] into all the world
[32:37] and preach the gospel to every creature
[32:40] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[32:42] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[32:44] be damned and these shines shall follow
[32:47] them that believe
[32:49] in my name they shall cast out devils
[32:51] they shall speak with new tongues
[32:53] they shall take up serpents and if drink
[32:57] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[32:59] they shall lay hands on the sick
[33:02] and they shall
[33:03] recover amen you can go ahead and be
[33:05] seated i would like to read

[33:23] at the end of the sermon he's praying
[33:26] he says oh eternal father send the
[33:28] gospel light across this city
[33:30] through this coming week of convention
[33:32] if there be any seed somehow by your own
[33:34] great wise providence
[33:37] like trying to illustrate in the sperm
[33:39] of the male and the female may they roll
[33:41] into the convention may the holy spirit
[33:43] give them light
[33:45] we realize that the time is perhaps
[33:47] later than we think it is
[33:50] we pray god that as we come here just
[33:52] believing
[33:54] that maybe there is something here that
[33:56] could be done
[33:57] that would help the people
[33:59] or catch that last sheep i believe
[34:02] that's our heart's desire no matter
[34:04] where we go
[34:05] whether we're sent overseas or whether
[34:07] we're right here in our community we're
[34:09] wanting to shine the gospel light that
[34:11] we can catch that last sheep
[34:13] we know when the sheepfold is full then
[34:17] the shepherd will close the door
[34:19] as it was like in the days of noah when
[34:22] the last member of the family was
[34:23] brought in god closed the door
[34:25] and they beat and pounded but it was too
[34:27] late dear god they had the opportunity
[34:31] you said i am the door to the sheephold
[34:34] and how striking the song from the poet
[34:37] are not 90 and nine enough for thee but
[34:40] no there was one more
[34:42] he might be
[34:43] a little black sheep
[34:45] or he might be a little nobody
[34:48] might be the little her or he we don't
[34:51] know where
[34:52] they are
[34:54] but that last one must come in and then
[34:56] the door will be closed oh god who knows
[34:59] all things
[35:01] search our lives this morning
[35:03] and send us wherever that we could go
[35:07] and that really just stuck out to me as
[35:10] god makes opportunity and the provisions
[35:12] to go
[35:14] he says and send us wherever that we
[35:16] could go that we might find that last
[35:19] one
[35:20] that the door would be closed and the
[35:22] shepherd inside with the sheep granite
[35:24] lord if there be that one here today if
[35:27] that one that is supposed to come in
[35:29] all the father has given me
[35:31] will come
[35:33] to me
[35:35] and can come except my cannot come
[35:38] except the father has drawn him amen
[35:41] you believe that so we're just thankful
[35:43] that we have the opportunity um
[35:46] kind of the way uh it transpired i had
[35:49] uh caused uh called brother cosman and
[35:52] we've just in our hearts we've uh wanted
[35:55] to do certain things for the believers
[35:57] or just
[35:58] facilitate a certain opportunity and i
[36:01] called him up and we were just uh
[36:03] talking about uh just praying and doing
[36:05] something for the lord
[36:07] and so when we we called him and just
[36:10] wanted to even look outside of the box
[36:12] if you will if there was something god
[36:13] could do overseas and as we got to
[36:16] talking and and cosmo went to prayer um
[36:19] he always had a a desire on his heart to
[36:22] go back to romania and so as we were in
[36:25] touch about that and just um
[36:28] started to put that before us uh brother
[36:30] cosman went to prayer and i'll just have
[36:32] brother cosman come now and and give the
[36:34] testimony of of how things transpired
[36:37] because we were um we had selected
[36:41] uh we we just looked at the calendar and
[36:43] it was like well it's only this week you
[36:44] know that weekend and it was on our
[36:45] heart to go and so we picked a weekend
[36:47] we bought our tickets we were going
[36:49] there by faith uh no one there to
[36:51] receive us we we knew uh cosmon grew up
[36:54] there somewhere
[36:55] we were going to go into the highways
[36:57] and byways and we were going to witness
[36:59] and
[37:00] testify we just wanted to do something
[37:02] for god and then in that in that process
[37:06] of us going uh the lord just opened some
[37:08] doors and i'd like brother cosman to
[37:10] come and then we'll just uh it's just
[37:11] gonna be a relaxed evening me and him
[37:13] we'll we'll do our best just to to walk
[37:16] together through the slides and and try
[37:18] to give you a picture and bring you on
[37:20] that journey as the lord brought us
[37:22] through romania so brother cosman if
[37:24] you'll come at this time if if they can
[37:26] make this mic hot that would be good
[37:29] for the cosmon
[37:32] amen god bless you
[37:36] um
[37:38] it was it was a privilege to just be
[37:40] able to uh just go back home and
[37:43] and just to see you know the believers
[37:45] there but
[37:46] just like matthew was saying the
[37:47] testimony and how uh things unfolded
[37:50] so um i would say about six to eight
[37:52] months ago the lord put a burden on my
[37:54] heart
[37:55] and the burden was to go in romania and
[37:58] uh
[37:59] you know spread this gospel to my own
[38:01] family
[38:02] we still have family in romania that are
[38:04] unbelievable i'm you know believers
[38:06] they're in the pentecostal church
[38:08] and so
[38:09] um
[38:10] when you realize the grace
[38:13] and what this message does to an
[38:15] individual
[38:17] all you want to do is go share the same
[38:19] life
[38:20] and not a life that you try to teach
[38:23] um not a life that you try to explain
[38:26] you know not a life that you could try
[38:28] to go and say hey this is how you do
[38:30] things this is how you do things but you
[38:31] just go
[38:32] like like paul said you go in power and
[38:34] demonstration
[38:36] and and you go and you try to shed this
[38:38] life this love this divine love
[38:42] so you know um
[38:44] as a lot of us have family here and our
[38:46] hearts you know
[38:47] burned for him to come to this message
[38:49] that was my heart and i said lord you've
[38:51] done it for me
[38:53] you put you pulled us out of the
[38:55] pentecostal uh church
[38:57] you're able to show me this grace i said
[39:00] what if i'm the only contact that they
[39:02] would ever have
[39:03] to this
[39:05] eternity
[39:07] and so
[39:09] you know that burden just become real
[39:10] heavy on my heart and i just went i went
[39:12] for prayer and
[39:14] that's when brother matthew had called
[39:16] and
[39:17] you know was feeling the burden himself
[39:18] so i said well you know let's just pray
[39:20] about it we're going to just walk by
[39:21] faith
[39:22] i don't know no believers in romania
[39:25] if i knew anybody
[39:27] you know my dad used to be a missionary
[39:29] so i
[39:30] was going to ask him hey can you
[39:32] speak to some people and get into some
[39:34] pentecostal churches we were going to
[39:35] bring the gospel one way or another it
[39:37] was on the corner of the street it was
[39:39] going to be in my family's house it was
[39:41] going to be in the church whatever it
[39:42] was going to be we were going to do it
[39:45] so you know
[39:47] what's amazing about just walking in
[39:49] faith and just taking the time to
[39:52] listen to that still my small voice is
[39:54] that he leads you and he guides you
[39:56] and sometimes we over overlook things
[39:58] like that you know we think that it's
[40:00] our own conscience you think that it's
[40:02] our own way of thinking
[40:03] but when you follow it
[40:05] and you believe it
[40:07] then it manifests it
[40:09] and the more you do it the more mature
[40:11] you become in that word
[40:13] so i followed that step of just you know
[40:18] going with that still small voice
[40:21] so we put it before the prayer so then
[40:23] one day i just called matthew and i said
[40:24] man
[40:26] i found tickets i said these are the two
[40:28] dates it's at this price or this price
[40:30] and he said well this date doesn't work
[40:32] good for me and
[40:34] so then let's do this date so i ended up
[40:36] buying them that night
[40:38] so i just i just told them i said you
[40:40] know let's just continue to keep it in
[40:41] prayer i don't really know how god's
[40:43] gonna manifest it i don't really know
[40:44] what's gonna happen
[40:46] um
[40:47] we're just gonna walk by faith and you
[40:49] know i had a plan
[40:51] and it was my natural plan
[40:53] it was the way that i was thinking that
[40:55] things were going to unfold
[40:59] and so
[41:00] you know i continued to kind of pray
[41:02] about it brother matthew was busy at
[41:04] that time traveling so you know i wasn't
[41:06] able to keep up and tell them some of
[41:08] these things but i just kept telling
[41:10] them i said continue to pray
[41:12] god's doing something supernatural
[41:15] so then he he wasn't
[41:17] at the end i ended up telling him
[41:19] but um
[41:21] so
[41:22] one day i was just around just looking
[41:25] online and so
[41:28] i figured i said you know if we're going
[41:29] to be in around this area
[41:32] i would like to go sit in
[41:35] at a message church
[41:36] and so
[41:37] um
[41:39] i ended up call i ended up finding this
[41:41] brother preaching online for a clip of
[41:44] about two minutes
[41:46] and um you know
[41:50] i i i try to
[41:52] i'm i'm a little good at research so
[41:54] then when i've noticed that after two
[41:56] hours i'm not finding his information i
[41:57] said well something's wrong
[41:59] i mean i typed his name i looked up his
[42:02] website to get on his website you got to
[42:04] put a password in
[42:06] so no information online
[42:09] i said okay lord so i was sitting on the
[42:12] couch
[42:13] and i was really like into researching
[42:15] and all of a sudden my wife looks and
[42:16] he's like honey what are you doing for
[42:18] three hours like you're just sitting
[42:19] there just
[42:20] said honey i'm doing something it's like
[42:22] i'm almost there
[42:24] i'm almost there
[42:26] so i believe after half an hour after
[42:28] she said that all of a sudden i found a
[42:30] flyer of this brother that preached
[42:33] a service
[42:34] in germany in 19
[42:38] either 1999 or 2001
[42:42] and he had his email he had his phone
[42:44] number there and i said well that's kind
[42:46] of old i i don't really know if that's
[42:48] going to work but you know i'm just
[42:49] going to take a picture of it and i'm
[42:50] going to see if i could contact that
[42:52] number
[42:53] so as this time was going forth
[42:56] i kept praying about it for the next two
[42:57] three days that really couldn't have the
[42:59] uh
[43:00] um
[43:02] you know the the guts to just make the
[43:03] phone call i was just kind of nervous
[43:06] so after like three days of praying and
[43:08] just having the comfort to just call the
[43:10] brother i ended up calling the brother
[43:12] and
[43:13] and this is the first i i've talked to
[43:15] brother gabriel
[43:16] so we were on the form for 45 minutes
[43:20] and
[43:20] you know
[43:22] when you know
[43:24] that someone's got the same spirit you
[43:26] have you don't have to me
[43:29] because it was the word that united us
[43:32] in our conversation
[43:34] i didn't ask him about his past
[43:36] i didn't ask him about what he was doing
[43:38] but as soon as we opened up the
[43:40] conversation we were talking about the
[43:42] lord we were talking about the prophet
[43:44] we were talking what the lord was doing
[43:45] today
[43:46] and the conversation just kept
[43:48] progressing
[43:49] so after 45 minutes i said you know
[43:51] brother gabriel i said uh me and brother
[43:54] matthew are planning to come to romania
[43:56] around this date
[43:57] and um
[43:58] so
[44:00] uh this is this is the dates we're
[44:02] coming um we're just gonna want to come
[44:04] sitting on a sit sit in on your one of
[44:06] your services he's like okay good
[44:09] and so um
[44:11] i ended up finishing the conversation
[44:13] with him
[44:14] now he at the same time as we were
[44:16] having that confirmation he said you
[44:17] know just make sure you realize that
[44:19] there's going to be some restrictions
[44:21] taking place in romania the next few
[44:24] months
[44:25] vaccine
[44:27] closing borders this new variant that
[44:29] just came out was really taken in effect
[44:31] at that time
[44:33] so
[44:34] i said okay we'll we'll continue to pray
[44:36] pray about it this was in i would say
[44:38] june
[44:40] so we kept praying about it i kept
[44:42] praying about it and i believe in at the
[44:44] beginning of august i um he ended up
[44:47] texting me and he said you know brother
[44:48] cosman are you guys still coming and i
[44:50] said yeah he said okay
[44:52] so tell me the dates again and i said
[44:54] okay told him the dates and he said okay
[44:57] well i'll tell you what um
[45:00] we're going to go ahead and and
[45:02] on those dates we're going to schedule
[45:04] you to come preach sunday morning over
[45:06] here
[45:07] press preach sunday evening over here
[45:09] we're going to have a service on
[45:10] wednesday we're going to have a service
[45:12] on thursday we're going to have a
[45:13] service on friday we're going to have a
[45:14] service of saturday
[45:16] saturday and we're going to have two
[45:17] services on on sunday and i said brother
[45:19] and she's like yeah we're going to go
[45:22] he said he said we're going to go have a
[45:24] revival
[45:25] i said praise the lord
[45:27] i said okay so so he said he said don't
[45:30] worry about a thing
[45:32] he said i'll organize everything
[45:35] i will schedule all our places to go to
[45:38] and i will meet you at the airport
[45:40] and we will take you
[45:42] now brother gabriel has been serving and
[45:45] he's been at domestic since 1989.
[45:48] so brother gabriel's got you know
[45:50] he's got a good influence upon the
[45:52] believers there as a believer and and
[45:55] holding to the message and and just
[45:57] knowing that he's he's a pillar
[46:00] so
[46:01] um
[46:02] you know as as this was unfolding
[46:06] um you know there was a few things that
[46:08] we had to do before we ended up going
[46:10] and one of those things was basically
[46:12] get vaccinated so we walked by faith and
[46:14] doing that
[46:15] and then you know as the time got closer
[46:18] but they gave up brother gable confirmed
[46:20] and and basically just
[46:22] said hey
[46:23] all is well
[46:24] we're going to take you guys over here
[46:26] this is what's going to happen we've
[46:27] already made all these arrangements
[46:29] these people are going to come at this
[46:30] church then that night we're going to go
[46:32] here and it just unfolded so well that
[46:35] you know we could ask for more
[46:38] and realistically we didn't have to be
[46:40] there speak or do anything other than
[46:42] just fellowship with the believers
[46:43] because you you realize that
[46:46] the same word
[46:48] that produces sons and daughters here in
[46:50] america it's the same word that produces
[46:53] sons and daughters anywhere else and
[46:56] it's not the man that does the work but
[46:58] it's god through his messenger to the
[47:00] word i came for that produced that
[47:03] and it was a blessing because you know
[47:05] um i've never had you know fellowship
[47:08] with my own people
[47:11] you know i i was born and raised there
[47:14] and uh you know it was it was a
[47:16] privilege because you realize the love
[47:19] and and you know just talking about the
[47:21] prophet in my language and just this
[47:24] thing that united us you know i didn't
[47:25] have to speak english i already knew
[47:27] what they were meaning you know and just
[47:29] it was it was just beautiful i was so
[47:31] blessed and you know
[47:33] they're already expecting our pastor you
[47:35] know they're they're wanting to do a
[47:37] meeting for him next year so you know
[47:39] the lord's gonna maybe take him over
[47:41] there and we'll go over there and he'll
[47:42] preach the gospel to him but you know
[47:45] they know
[47:46] uh because
[47:48] it's the love
[47:49] that we have one for another that
[47:51] determines
[47:52] the spirit that we carry and brother
[47:54] brahm talks about the divine love that
[47:56] we carry
[47:57] so it was it was a privilege
[48:00] and uh you know it's a testimony
[48:02] and and i want
[48:03] you know as as we're going through if
[48:05] you can if you can
[48:07] get something out of the presentation of
[48:09] what we're doing is
[48:12] this could be you
[48:15] this could be you
[48:17] but not you going and having a just just
[48:20] being you listening to him
[48:23] just you
[48:24] listening to that still my voice and
[48:26] acting upon the word of god in you
[48:29] and be now you become one with the word
[48:32] and now you can do the same works that
[48:35] jesus did
[48:36] and i want this to be an encouragement
[48:37] for you guys i want you guys to just be
[48:40] encouraged and know that you know you
[48:41] can go to a school and testify to
[48:43] somebody you know you can go on the
[48:46] streets and testify like we've seen this
[48:48] morning just what the words doing you
[48:49] know there was nothing that we've done
[48:51] we just played the prophet
[48:53] and the prophet's word
[48:55] attracted
[48:56] and it was one i mean it was it was it
[48:58] was her reaction to the word so just
[49:00] have faith and
[49:03] so we're going to get started
[49:06] so as kosman said
[49:08] there's this big itinerary plan that i
[49:10] know nothing about
[49:13] and i i maybe found out about it about a
[49:16] week to departure
[49:18] and um we were
[49:20] brother gabriel knew that uh cosmon had
[49:23] a burden on his heart and wanted to go
[49:25] and just witness or testify
[49:27] in any way he could about the word and
[49:29] what it done for his life and so i was
[49:31] able to talk to brother gabriel and he
[49:33] had about nine services
[49:35] um planned and he said well we'll we'll
[49:37] have you take six of them and we'll have
[49:38] brother cosman speak at three of them
[49:40] give his testimony however he feels led
[49:43] and so
[49:44] i had a week
[49:46] and i'm like well praise god we'll we'll
[49:48] just look forward to what the lord has
[49:49] and so
[49:51] um
[49:52] this would be uh the beginning but i do
[49:54] want to say this as as i found that out
[49:57] our initial like cosmic said we just
[50:00] thought maybe we'd go into the area go
[50:01] in the highways and byways but then as i
[50:04] as i talked to brother gabriel and
[50:06] realized that really if if you were
[50:08] wanting to do missionary work you'd want
[50:10] a guy like that in
[50:12] boots on the ground and so i realized
[50:14] well lord what's your bigger picture
[50:16] here because uh this brother's taking us
[50:18] to some places that have have have a
[50:20] knowledge of the message and they're
[50:22] believers so we started to search in our
[50:24] heart what our part was now it was
[50:26] almost like a pivot that that now if
[50:28] we're not the ones going in the highways
[50:30] and byways let's come in and speak to
[50:31] these believers and these certain ones
[50:33] and
[50:34] and preach a word that can
[50:36] encourage them and empower them now to
[50:38] go out in the highways and the byways
[50:40] because they'll be a lot more effective
[50:42] than i could ever be and so we'll just
[50:44] continue uh
[50:46] right now into the slide show here
[50:49] so romania mission trip
[50:53] and we arrived in bucharest on saturday
[50:55] which was september the 25th
[50:57] and uh brother gabriel and brother billy
[51:00] were there at the airport they were
[51:02] there to
[51:03] welcome us this is a picture of myself
[51:05] and
[51:06] and uh brother billy uh who has been a
[51:09] believing this message uh for for many
[51:11] years and has done a lot of traveling so
[51:13] many people in europe know him my uncle
[51:16] uh uncle dennis knows him and also knows
[51:19] brother gabriel so we were welcome and
[51:21] to receive there on that saturday night
[51:23] and uh we would end up staying in
[51:25] bucharest
[51:27] saturday night
[51:28] and then we would be traveling uh the
[51:30] following morning to the to the
[51:33] sunday services
[51:35] go ahead brother
[51:37] so as we were traveling in the morning
[51:40] we stayed in bucharest saturday night we
[51:42] woke up in the morning ate breakfast and
[51:44] went straight to church
[51:46] and
[51:47] as we were
[51:48] getting into the area where the church
[51:51] was
[51:52] we realized that it was just a
[51:54] neighborhood
[51:55] you know there was no church it was just
[51:57] somebody's front yard and
[51:59] and so um straight straight to church
[52:02] was an hour and a half drive right also
[52:05] so
[52:07] so yeah we woke up in bucharest and
[52:08] straight to church was an hour and a
[52:10] half drive and just to hop in there as
[52:12] cosmo was saying we start to drive into
[52:14] this neighborhood and we're just turning
[52:17] down like little neighborhood roads and
[52:18] all of a sudden you see
[52:20] these people in a suit and dressed and
[52:22] someone that looks like it so they're
[52:23] just walking down the road we start
[52:24] driving by him and we we go a little bit
[52:26] further and there's a few more and we
[52:28] turn down and we see believers just
[52:29] walking down the street down the down
[52:31] down the the neighborhood road and then
[52:34] they start filtering in through in those
[52:36] neighborhoods they they have like a gate
[52:37] that keeps you know
[52:39] they run all the way where you can't
[52:40] even see into their yards and they'll
[52:41] have big metal gates that are maybe
[52:43] chained together or something you got to
[52:44] open them up and they all they open up
[52:46] this gate and they're they're starting
[52:47] to go in through this gate and we come
[52:49] to find out the believers are just
[52:51] starting to congregate in this at this
[52:53] home in in the front yard and usually
[52:56] the believers in that area would just
[52:57] have a house meeting inside but other
[52:59] believers were coming from around so
[53:01] there wasn't enough room inside the
[53:03] house and as you can see here they just
[53:05] they just all started to congregate in
[53:07] the yard and this would be our our first
[53:10] service in the city of
[53:12] colorado
[53:15] and we have a we have a little
[53:17] i'm not going to say that
[53:21] yeah i guess i'll go ahead i'll get him
[53:23] i can say i can say a few words in
[53:24] romania but some of these cities get me
[53:27] so yeah we uh we went ahead and yeah we
[53:29] traveled over to cuddle colorado on
[53:31] sunday morning so this was
[53:33] this was part of their morning um
[53:36] service we're going to play a small
[53:37] little
[53:39] video service
[53:42] [Applause]
[53:43] [Music]
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:45] [Music]
[53:51] [Applause]
[53:54] yeah no ac no instruments um just just
[53:57] solo
[53:59] so we had we had great service that
[54:01] morning and um after brother matthew had
[54:04] preached uh there was a prayer line i
[54:06] believe we were um
[54:08] praying for about an hour hour and a
[54:10] half for the believers coming through
[54:12] there was a lot of them that came
[54:13] through and just asked for a change in
[54:15] their heart
[54:16] um some of them decided to follow the
[54:18] lord
[54:19] and you know one thing about areas like
[54:22] this where you're able to do a church
[54:24] service in somebody's front yard
[54:26] is that when things get amplified
[54:29] everybody gets curious
[54:32] so you had people just neighbors from
[54:34] off the street just coming in
[54:36] and just wanting to partake of that well
[54:38] you know the americans are coming
[54:41] that's that's the thing there you know
[54:43] the americans are coming they're coming
[54:44] with the gospel
[54:46] and they were expecting something from
[54:48] the lord and we've had people that you
[54:50] know were not even in the message just
[54:52] coming through the prayer line just
[54:54] asking i want to serve the lord and so
[54:56] it was it was great it was a great
[54:57] experience
[54:58] and and you know it
[55:00] it it produced a produce where some of
[55:02] them wanted to get baptized or here's a
[55:04] video of the location
[55:18] that's the river um it's a popular river
[55:21] that goes through there
[55:35] [Music]
[55:43] and this were the three souls that
[55:45] decided to get baptized
[55:48] brother matthew on the left by the billy
[55:50] on the right
[55:51] brother billy is kind of
[55:53] overseeing this area these two these two
[55:55] little areas here
[55:59] so there's uh
[56:00] there was a little sister to the right i
[56:02] believe she was either 11 or 12 and then
[56:05] the sister in the middle she was about
[56:06] 16 and then that was i believe a cousin
[56:09] and he was about 21 or 22.
[56:13] this is a little still frame of the
[56:15] video you just watched and i i wanted to
[56:18] point out this sister here because after
[56:19] we were done with the baptisms uh this
[56:21] sister just in her good sunday clothes
[56:23] there as we were we were about to start
[56:25] coming out of the water she just felt
[56:27] the lord move upon her heart and she
[56:28] said i want to get baptized too and so
[56:31] she just came walking out in the water
[56:33] and so this is a picture of us baptizing
[56:36] her
[56:36] there as she was baptized in in
[56:39] christian baptism and in the name of the
[56:41] lord jesus christ so we were just
[56:44] real honored for that and this next
[56:45] slide is just a picture of us and the
[56:48] brothers here
[56:50] if
[56:51] brother cosman
[56:53] if he'll just go ahead and start to
[56:54] explain the testimony we found out the
[56:56] brother
[56:57] next to him had a need he's kind of he's
[56:59] not a pastor uh per se but he's really
[57:02] uh feels
[57:04] uh to do his part to just get the
[57:06] believers together hearing the word and
[57:08] um we had an opportunity that brother
[57:11] gabriel mentioned that we were able to
[57:12] help him yeah so just like matthew was
[57:13] saying this brother here kind of isn't
[57:15] overlooking the the the believers there
[57:18] and you know he was even telling me
[57:20] sometimes if if they don't have a
[57:21] minister come through they'll just
[57:22] gather in a house and they'll just play
[57:24] a tape and just kind of listen to the
[57:25] prophet and just you know go forward how
[57:27] they can and how they're able to but
[57:30] continue believing so brother gabriel
[57:32] said hey you know this brother here
[57:35] is a very good brother he is the he's
[57:36] the brother that keeps things together
[57:38] here and the lord's really using them
[57:40] and he's got a car it's about to break
[57:42] down and
[57:43] um he would be good if somehow we can we
[57:46] can try to help him
[57:47] so
[57:48] um you know his name the brothers the
[57:51] brother's name is nelu
[57:53] so we the church helped them with a few
[57:55] dollars to be able to put towards
[57:57] replacing the new car
[58:00] and he was going to try to sell the one
[58:01] he's got because he was breaking down
[58:03] and try to put a little extra of what he
[58:05] had plus what the church gave him and he
[58:07] was able to use that and and gather the
[58:09] paper people you know a lot of people
[58:11] walk there
[58:13] you know a lot of people just they don't
[58:15] you can't have the funds to purchase a
[58:17] car and drive because it's expensive so
[58:19] sometimes you know uh you know picking
[58:22] picking uh pick and pick people up or
[58:25] you know just taking them the message
[58:26] books or whatever he can do to support
[58:28] the ministry there i i thought that was
[58:31] a really good um really good donation so
[58:34] we even noticed that the the vehicle you
[58:36] it was in was a very older vehicle and
[58:38] you had a bunch of people piled into
[58:40] there and so uh just know that that
[58:43] y'all were a part of that uh the church
[58:45] uh and and what y'all give y'all were a
[58:47] part
[58:48] in providing a brother there in southern
[58:50] romania transportation to continue to
[58:54] get the word to the bride and to keep
[58:56] them in fellowship so we that y'all are
[58:58] a part of that that is something you did
[59:00] um and so we want you to know that and
[59:02] so after uh going out there in the
[59:04] danube river
[59:05] as uh we picked a location there was
[59:08] nothing but shells
[59:10] on the bottom and
[59:16] yeah so the i'm i'm sitting to the left
[59:19] well to my left uh brother nello is
[59:21] right next to me i'm i'm putting my arm
[59:23] around him the brother in the middle
[59:25] right next to matthew and brother nello
[59:27] that's brother billy
[59:29] then you got brother matthew and then
[59:30] the one with the blue shirt that's
[59:32] brother gabriel
[59:33] so he's the brother that we traveled
[59:35] with
[59:36] amen and so after after going into the
[59:40] new river there and feeling like i was
[59:41] standing on razor blades for
[59:43] for a while i would have worn my shoes
[59:45] in there but i didn't have any change of
[59:47] clothes really where we got another hour
[59:48] and a half two hours to our next service
[59:51] and so um just as you see coming right
[59:54] out of the water right into the car
[59:57] right to the next service
[1:00:01] another hour drive
[1:00:02] to church
[1:00:04] on on the back on on the back sides of
[1:00:06] the roads of romania you know romania's
[1:00:09] is um
[1:00:11] it's not known for having good roads you
[1:00:14] know
[1:00:15] you have to avoid you have to avoid a
[1:00:17] lot of holes and potholes and cows and
[1:00:19] cows
[1:00:21] so so we we traveled we came we came to
[1:00:24] the evening service
[1:00:26] and this was uh our fellowship here on
[1:00:29] on that same evening service this is now
[1:00:31] sunday evening september 26th the first
[1:00:34] sunday we were there
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:54] we were there praying for people for
[1:00:56] about an hour so he kept leading songs
[1:00:57] for an hour and he almost lost his voice
[1:00:59] that night
[1:01:02] yeah brother um
[1:01:04] brother cosman had an opportunity to
[1:01:06] testify and just give his a testimony
[1:01:08] what the word's done for him and how he
[1:01:10] wanted to be a witness and there was
[1:01:12] many people that come up for prayer that
[1:01:13] that were wanting to have that same type
[1:01:15] of of of
[1:01:17] a move in their life to where they would
[1:01:19] start to take this message and really
[1:01:21] live it out into the community so we had
[1:01:23] a good response to that and were able to
[1:01:26] pray with many so it was a it was a a
[1:01:28] fruitful fruitful evening as well as in
[1:01:30] the morning
[1:01:32] so one thing that you guys will see uh
[1:01:34] going forward from this first and second
[1:01:36] services that
[1:01:38] we fellowshipped around food a lot
[1:01:43] romanians like to eat let me just say
[1:01:45] that and so when you fellowship around
[1:01:47] food all the time then you just start
[1:01:51] it just wears you out
[1:01:53] so
[1:01:54] here's here's the beginning of it
[1:01:57] and and and i'll say this these you know
[1:01:59] they're they're precious brothers and
[1:02:01] sisters just just like our own and they
[1:02:03] they would receive us and it it was like
[1:02:05] special meetings for them amen and
[1:02:07] having that it was almost
[1:02:10] back-to-back nights it just there was
[1:02:12] there was food
[1:02:13] and more food
[1:02:16] so um some of the brothers here the
[1:02:18] brother that you guys see with the with
[1:02:20] the sweater he actually just called me a
[1:02:22] few a few days ago his name is uh
[1:02:28] i forgot
[1:02:32] it'll come back it'll come back but you
[1:02:34] know so yeah we
[1:02:35] we we fellowship with some of these uh
[1:02:37] some of these people so this is sunday
[1:02:38] evening and so we uh we're going the
[1:02:41] next day uh we're going to break up
[1:02:43] about 11 hours worth of driving for our
[1:02:46] service and by amare so we're going to
[1:02:48] take monday and tuesday to travel
[1:02:51] and this next slide is um monday morning
[1:02:55] after we went and did a little
[1:02:58] sightseeing at the in the at the port
[1:03:00] there in uh
[1:03:04] how do you say that
[1:03:06] costanza costanza
[1:03:08] um we we after we saw the port there and
[1:03:11] cosman really enjoyed it because he
[1:03:12] didn't ever see the port there in
[1:03:14] romania where all the shipping comes in
[1:03:16] and these believers invited us over
[1:03:18] their house and as they were always
[1:03:19] putting this food down in front of me i
[1:03:21] really didn't know that
[1:03:23] i was fulfilling scripture because
[1:03:26] luke 10 verse 8
[1:03:28] says
[1:03:29] and into whatsoever city he enter
[1:03:33] and they receive you
[1:03:36] eat such things as are set
[1:03:39] before you
[1:03:47] and that i did
[1:03:56] but you know
[1:03:58] i never even thought um
[1:04:01] i never even thought about it twice
[1:04:02] because these are my brothers and
[1:04:03] sisters in christ this is their labor of
[1:04:06] love
[1:04:07] and so um
[1:04:09] i'm thankful that they have good taste
[1:04:13] and um
[1:04:14] we but we enjoyed it it was good and so
[1:04:16] now uh this next this next frame is
[1:04:19] going to just show our journey now over
[1:04:21] the next uh a couple days a total of
[1:04:24] about 11 hours
[1:04:26] and so we were able to break it up into
[1:04:28] two days and and do a little
[1:04:30] sight scene
[1:04:32] on the way we were able to stop at this
[1:04:34] salt line and and just look at some of
[1:04:36] the countryside but this this next slide
[1:04:39] is is going to be as we're arriving into
[1:04:41] bayamari
[1:04:43] and um so this now is wednesday uh
[1:04:46] probably about five uh in the afternoon
[1:04:48] maybe four in the afternoon um so we we
[1:04:51] took uh uh monday
[1:04:53] uh tuesday doing some traveling
[1:04:56] and then um now we're we're we're coming
[1:04:58] into bayamari and i just thought it
[1:05:01] would be good to to um
[1:05:03] to show this to you because
[1:05:05] as we came into bayamari we come into
[1:05:07] this restaurant and i noticed that we're
[1:05:10] the only people there
[1:05:12] and you know i
[1:05:14] i didn't realize until a little bit
[1:05:16] later i started to to talk to brother
[1:05:18] cosman about it but actually this
[1:05:20] restaurant was owned by the pastor
[1:05:22] brother florin in by amare
[1:05:26] his family members owned this restaurant
[1:05:28] and because
[1:05:30] brother gabriel and sister mary had not
[1:05:32] been vaccinated they actually just
[1:05:34] closed down the restaurant so we could
[1:05:36] eat there and so we were able to have
[1:05:38] some good fellowship there and because
[1:05:40] they weren't vaccinated they they didn't
[1:05:43] want to have the restaurant open and
[1:05:44] that's when we started to realize that
[1:05:47] the romania was starting to um enforce
[1:05:51] restrictions and what they would say is
[1:05:53] that the the the town has now turned red
[1:05:56] and we found out that every time we'd
[1:05:57] come into a city it was almost like
[1:06:00] clockwork when we would leave that same
[1:06:02] night that the town would be turned red
[1:06:05] which means now curfew is in place you
[1:06:07] couldn't be out after eight o'clock and
[1:06:09] you couldn't go out into public if you
[1:06:10] didn't have a cur didn't have a
[1:06:11] vaccination which would have eliminated
[1:06:14] believers being able to come to the
[1:06:15] services and we realized that we'd come
[1:06:17] in and then right as we were leaving
[1:06:19] they'd like our they're actually at a uh
[1:06:21] 11 p.m tonight that uh we're turning red
[1:06:24] and so it was really it was really a
[1:06:26] blessing to see how the lord was allowed
[1:06:27] to get us in there before the curfews
[1:06:29] were in place and then we'd get out
[1:06:31] just in time
[1:06:36] so this is uh this is our lunch in that
[1:06:38] same restaurant
[1:06:40] you got brother paul sitting to the left
[1:06:43] he's actually
[1:06:44] out of spain and he um he's got an
[1:06:47] amazing testimony but he actually works
[1:06:50] for a lot of people that um
[1:06:53] might know you know soccer fame but he
[1:06:55] actually works for the owner of real
[1:06:57] madrid
[1:06:58] so you know he he does some sort of
[1:07:00] sales and he was in romania and he's
[1:07:03] been in romania working this project for
[1:07:04] about 10 years so he was able he's a
[1:07:06] believer so he was able to come
[1:07:07] fellowship with us you got brother
[1:07:09] gabriel right behind him and you got
[1:07:12] brother matthew all the way in the back
[1:07:13] brother billy and
[1:07:14] and myself and as you can tell you might
[1:07:17] not be able to see back where matthew's
[1:07:18] eating but he this is the first time he
[1:07:20] tried the tribe soup
[1:07:22] um
[1:07:23] good and uh
[1:07:25] i was i was surprised i i really didn't
[1:07:27] know that he would he would he would he
[1:07:29] would do i think all the believers there
[1:07:30] were surprised that i i uh i took it all
[1:07:33] on and i ate everything that was put in
[1:07:35] front of me gladly
[1:07:37] gladly so this is a picture right here
[1:07:39] that we sent over to our pastor brother
[1:07:41] david and he took one look at it and he
[1:07:44] said you know what
[1:07:46] cosmon
[1:07:47] you look tired
[1:07:49] matthew you look tired you look like
[1:07:51] zombies
[1:07:53] you need to get some rest
[1:07:55] and so
[1:07:56] after this meal we went to check into
[1:07:58] our hotel to get ready for the evening
[1:08:00] service and i was i was talking to
[1:08:02] brother cosmo and i was like you know
[1:08:03] what
[1:08:04] uh uh the pastor uh brother david feels
[1:08:07] like we're tired and we need to get some
[1:08:08] rest so we we need to just let them know
[1:08:10] send back a report that we're doing okay
[1:08:13] and so we just took a picture
[1:08:15] and we sent back and said hey
[1:08:18] we're here we're encouraged
[1:08:21] the lord is with us
[1:08:23] how we're doing good
[1:08:24] we're not tired we're not tired we're
[1:08:27] good we're good we're not tired
[1:08:30] we might look tired but we're not tired
[1:08:31] we're good
[1:08:33] so that was a little uh a photo we sent
[1:08:36] back and so then off into the car again
[1:08:39] a service is going to be only about a 10
[1:08:40] or 15 minute drive from the hotel where
[1:08:43] we were staying in bayamari and we would
[1:08:45] pull up to brother florence church here
[1:08:47] if you'll notice
[1:08:49] this would be what would appear to be a
[1:08:51] picture of just a regular home but
[1:08:53] in the picture um that the door that's
[1:08:55] closest to you and the vantage point of
[1:08:57] that picture would be the entrance into
[1:08:59] his house um if you can zoom in towards
[1:09:02] the uh if it's possible to zoom in
[1:09:04] towards the entrance of the um
[1:09:07] the sanctuary and you can tell that uh
[1:09:10] to um
[1:09:12] the right there where he's pointing that
[1:09:14] is actually the entrance to the
[1:09:16] sanctuary and you'll find that
[1:09:19] most of the services that we are in they
[1:09:21] were either in a home they were in a
[1:09:23] rented office space and so brother
[1:09:26] florin uh was able to
[1:09:29] build a home in the sanctuary on the
[1:09:31] back side of it and so you'll notice in
[1:09:34] the next few clips
[1:09:36] this will be the service
[1:09:38] taking place just in the adjoining
[1:09:40] sanctuary on his home
[1:09:45] so this was wednesday evening this was
[1:09:47] um
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:55] they didn't have the street like
[1:09:57] matthew caldwell down there
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:22] all right so that was the song service
[1:10:24] and brother matthew uh preached a
[1:10:26] service here
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:42] so the sister here um she's got an
[1:10:44] awesome testimony and we're going to
[1:10:46] play a few a few seconds of her of her
[1:10:49] song that she wrote but
[1:10:52] she was sitting one day in the kitchen
[1:10:55] and the present of the lord come down
[1:10:57] and she wrote this song in five minutes
[1:11:01] and it was melody
[1:11:03] and the words
[1:11:05] and so
[1:11:06] it was just you know she was testifying
[1:11:08] that she was writing it was just flowing
[1:11:10] through and you can tell that there was
[1:11:12] a inspiration from the lord there but um
[1:11:15] i'll try to translate as she's singing
[1:11:18] it so that way you could understand what
[1:11:20] she's saying um
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:30] i didn't know anything
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:33] for your grace
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:49] i now understand
[1:11:54] what you did for me
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:11:59] with your love
[1:12:02] you created me
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:08] you gave me
[1:12:09] the word
[1:12:12] you gave me
[1:12:14] the prophet
[1:12:17] so i can understand
[1:12:20] who i am
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:26] so she's got three verses um it's it's
[1:12:30] absolutely an amazing song
[1:12:32] and you know it just it just shows you
[1:12:34] that when we have the word then we speak
[1:12:36] the word and it could even be in a song
[1:12:38] like that i mean that's just it's just
[1:12:40] marvelous
[1:12:41] this is some more food
[1:12:45] yes
[1:12:47] you know we've
[1:12:48] you know the romanian culture is it's so
[1:12:51] awesome that you know they just pour
[1:12:52] everything they have
[1:12:54] and you know the the way they can try to
[1:12:56] blush you in any way is just to feed you
[1:12:59] and so um you know it takes work
[1:13:02] it takes a lot of effort i'm sure the
[1:13:04] sisters know
[1:13:06] and we were blessed by every bit of it
[1:13:08] the brother to the right has got an
[1:13:10] awesome testimony his name is brother
[1:13:12] viorel
[1:13:14] so
[1:13:16] right before matthew spoke at the
[1:13:17] service
[1:13:19] uh brother gabriel said hey why don't
[1:13:21] you go ahead and greet the people and
[1:13:22] just sing a song and so we were able to
[1:13:24] sing a few songs and and and just
[1:13:26] testify a little bit to the people and
[1:13:28] so i told the people you know we're from
[1:13:30] dallas and this is this is what um how
[1:13:33] the lord brought us to the message and
[1:13:35] just testifying a little bit so after
[1:13:37] the service he come to me and he said
[1:13:40] you live in dallas so i said yeah he's
[1:13:42] like um you know i have a brother that
[1:13:44] lives in dallas i said okay he said
[1:13:47] what's his name so he said his name is
[1:13:49] george i said okay i said what church
[1:13:51] did he go to he's like well he goes to a
[1:13:53] pentecostal church there in dallas i
[1:13:54] said okay well what church is like i
[1:13:56] don't really know i said okay well
[1:13:57] what's his last name
[1:13:59] so he said george zimbru
[1:14:01] well
[1:14:02] you know the amazing part about it is
[1:14:04] that i used to go to church
[1:14:07] with that brother
[1:14:09] at the pentecostal church here off of 30
[1:14:13] and forest or
[1:14:15] you what is it um
[1:14:17] ferguson
[1:14:19] so we were involved there for two three
[1:14:20] years i know the brother i know his sons
[1:14:23] we used to serve together and i thought
[1:14:25] that was pretty neat that you know he
[1:14:26] was in the message and he said that he's
[1:14:29] told his brother about the message but i
[1:14:31] told him that i'm going to get his
[1:14:32] information and when i come back we were
[1:14:34] going to get in contact with him and we
[1:14:36] were going to try to see if we could
[1:14:38] testify you never know
[1:14:40] you know you never know he could be the
[1:14:41] last one so you know it was it was you
[1:14:44] know
[1:14:45] you just realize how how united we are
[1:14:48] with one another and sometimes we think
[1:14:50] this is a coincidence
[1:14:52] but it might be the plan of god so you
[1:14:54] never want to question or put away or
[1:14:56] put aside any things like this so i'm
[1:14:58] looking forward to it maybe he might be
[1:14:59] in our midst maybe you might see him
[1:15:02] amen i do want to testify that um you
[1:15:04] know it's it's the word that makes the
[1:15:06] difference and as we would come in and
[1:15:08] share the burden on our heart um just
[1:15:10] some of the testimonies that would come
[1:15:12] forth and you know that especially in
[1:15:15] this service one of the brothers said
[1:15:16] just the way that the word would come
[1:15:18] and discern the condition of our church
[1:15:20] and where we are and what we need and
[1:15:22] you just you just heard that uh multiple
[1:15:25] times
[1:15:26] and so
[1:15:27] that's what we expect in our own
[1:15:29] services that's what you expect over
[1:15:31] there is that the word of god is sharper
[1:15:32] than any two-edged sword and still a
[1:15:35] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:15:36] the heart so we might be kind of going
[1:15:38] through this in order and geographically
[1:15:41] and might not have as much time maybe to
[1:15:42] spend but but on the all the testimonies
[1:15:46] and and all of the words that that were
[1:15:49] given back of what god had done and how
[1:15:51] god had spoke to him how god had touched
[1:15:53] their heart but in every one of these
[1:15:56] meetings it was supernatural people
[1:15:58] would come testifying they were touched
[1:16:00] they were prayed for
[1:16:01] there was a sister that was
[1:16:04] really touched um
[1:16:06] in um
[1:16:08] this uh service here and and she she
[1:16:10] gave testimony of it and then also um
[1:16:14] brother paul as you'll see here in a
[1:16:15] couple slides later he said that he knew
[1:16:18] these brothers were coming from america
[1:16:20] and uh this and he he just wanted to um
[1:16:25] uh he needed to hear something from lord
[1:16:27] there was a a situation in the family um
[1:16:30] that they they were
[1:16:32] needing an answer and certain things to
[1:16:34] get processed and get done and approved
[1:16:36] and this is brother paul there the
[1:16:38] closest in the picture and he testified
[1:16:41] that i came to the service expecting to
[1:16:43] hear he said what was spoken was was
[1:16:45] directly to my heart directly to the
[1:16:48] need and he said the very next day he
[1:16:50] got reports back from from home that uh
[1:16:53] the things had already been processed
[1:16:54] and already been approved and he had got
[1:16:56] the answer and god had taken care of
[1:16:58] everything and i believe that's just if
[1:17:00] when you come expecting when you come
[1:17:02] believe in you you come and have a need
[1:17:04] and and that's how it always should be i
[1:17:06] believe in the local assembly many times
[1:17:09] um you know it's where we become common
[1:17:11] one to another
[1:17:13] but if we can look past the veil and
[1:17:14] whenever our pastor gets up to speak we
[1:17:16] know that's god speaking and if we can
[1:17:18] approach the office approach the word
[1:17:20] that same way and say god you you know
[1:17:22] my heart the man does it and i believe
[1:17:24] that by faith god will speak to your
[1:17:25] need every time
[1:17:27] amen this was a little uh mountain area
[1:17:30] right next to bayamar the brother
[1:17:32] gabriel just kind of took a smaller
[1:17:34] detour and brought us through here
[1:17:36] um
[1:17:37] so in this picture here uh you got
[1:17:39] brother florin on the left where me and
[1:17:41] matthew are taking individual pictures
[1:17:43] that's the pastor there
[1:17:45] and uh
[1:17:46] he's also right there in the in the big
[1:17:48] picture and this this is his home that
[1:17:50] we showed you the front door that just
[1:17:52] right behind us there you'd come in and
[1:17:53] this is where we're having the
[1:17:54] fellowship and then of course the
[1:17:55] sanctuary was just adjacent there
[1:17:58] in the home
[1:18:04] so i believe it was that that same day
[1:18:08] after we got done with
[1:18:09] visiting this place here we immediately
[1:18:11] got on the road and did more driving so
[1:18:13] thursday so we had service wednesday now
[1:18:15] it's thursday
[1:18:16] and now we're on our way to cluj we're
[1:18:18] on our way to cluj
[1:18:19] about a two hours and 20 minute drive
[1:18:22] and
[1:18:23] we get to a hotel i believe um
[1:18:27] really late because we weren't expecting
[1:18:29] traffic
[1:18:30] so now we're getting in trying to uh
[1:18:33] trying to change real quick and then try
[1:18:35] to make service
[1:18:36] so we're gonna
[1:18:38] be with brother marius bunya
[1:18:40] there's a small little church there
[1:18:42] there are about 40 saints in that church
[1:18:43] and he's kind of he's the pastor over
[1:18:45] there
[1:18:46] and uh you know
[1:18:48] it's just amazing to see how the lord
[1:18:51] just united us just with the word and
[1:18:54] how our fellowship always been it's
[1:18:55] always been around the world and the
[1:18:57] testimonies and and how things just done
[1:18:59] for us and
[1:19:00] as we were driving to the church um
[1:19:04] we pulled up into this area
[1:19:07] and so matthew did a good job at
[1:19:09] recording uh the location
[1:19:13] we parked and we're following the
[1:19:14] brothers to church and also i'm looking
[1:19:16] around like all right this is the way to
[1:19:18] church so i was like i better get this
[1:19:20] get this to show the saints because this
[1:19:22] is what they have to walk through to go
[1:19:24] to church right here and i thought i
[1:19:25] would give some good perspective
[1:19:27] so we've just walked through this
[1:19:29] supermarket
[1:19:32] and um
[1:19:35] this is the way
[1:19:37] we're walking
[1:19:40] to the church
[1:19:41] so we parked on the other side of this
[1:19:43] building
[1:19:44] and now we've just walked through this
[1:19:45] marketplace
[1:19:48] and so now we're heading into this
[1:19:51] building
[1:19:52] so then we would go up about four or
[1:19:53] five flights of stairs to i don't know
[1:19:55] to the third or fourth floor and that's
[1:19:57] where they had rented a little office
[1:19:59] space and that's where the thursday
[1:20:02] evening service would be their inclusion
[1:20:04] september the 30th
[1:20:06] so this was a little bit of their song
[1:20:08] service that
[1:20:16] evening you notice the believers they
[1:20:19] they're singing those familiar songs so
[1:20:21] it's always good when you go over there
[1:20:23] and and you see the statue of a perfect
[1:20:25] man you see the pillar of fire they're
[1:20:27] singing the same familiar songs you you
[1:20:30] know you're in the right place
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:46] you know a lot of a lot of the churches
[1:20:48] like we were saying earlier you know
[1:20:51] they're not buildings they're just a
[1:20:53] gathering there's just an area where you
[1:20:55] might not even expect it but it doesn't
[1:20:57] matter you know they just want to be
[1:20:59] together they just want to be around the
[1:21:00] world and and that's that's that's what
[1:21:02] united is that that's what united them
[1:21:04] together so that's uh that's
[1:21:06] something that was always on my heart is
[1:21:07] just just to be aware of or just how the
[1:21:09] lord would deal with
[1:21:10] deal with me is
[1:21:12] is it's one thing to have a knowledge
[1:21:14] that god sent a prophet but there's such
[1:21:16] a depth to what god has done and his
[1:21:19] doing and so we're just always
[1:21:21] wanting to be mindful to encourage the
[1:21:23] people to go further in the message to
[1:21:25] go further on with god and that god was
[1:21:28] using them he was there was more for
[1:21:30] them and because you you find if we're
[1:21:32] not careful a lot of people will set up
[1:21:34] camp they'll set up shop they'll think
[1:21:36] they've arrived and just because we sing
[1:21:38] the songs and we got the you know the
[1:21:40] statue of a perfect man uh doesn't mean
[1:21:43] we've arrived but yet we need to keep on
[1:21:45] going with the message and follow that
[1:21:46] pillar of fire as it's leading us
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:51] so this was a service thursday night
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:31] it was it was uh just a little tough for
[1:22:33] me to try to preach in romanian
[1:22:35] i know before i left but the david said
[1:22:37] you know you need to preach in your
[1:22:38] language so i i uh
[1:22:40] i uh matthew told me the same thing
[1:22:43] so i did it but you know if you look in
[1:22:45] the in the video at the end
[1:22:47] you see brother gabriel sitting right in
[1:22:49] the front he was like my coach so if i
[1:22:52] didn't know a word in romanian i would
[1:22:54] look at him i would say it real fast and
[1:22:56] he would help me translate but you know
[1:22:57] but but just a few times he only needed
[1:23:00] it yeah by the by the grace of god he
[1:23:02] was because he speaks romanian yeah
[1:23:10] so this was uh we were traveling uh that
[1:23:13] day more traveling
[1:23:16] this is brother gabriel now we uh we
[1:23:18] just stopped at a fruit stand just on
[1:23:20] the side of the road and we found some
[1:23:22] jelly
[1:23:23] and some apples
[1:23:25] eating eating hey brother gabriel
[1:23:27] that'll just hear some fruit we'd pull
[1:23:29] over here so brother gabe we are so
[1:23:30] stuffed from last night we can't eat
[1:23:32] another thing but but he was gracious
[1:23:34] but beautiful countryside romania
[1:23:37] absolutely gorgeous we just put a few
[1:23:39] pictures in here just to show the
[1:23:41] countryside and this next slide that
[1:23:43] we'll come to is
[1:23:45] a salt mine
[1:23:46] called selena turda assault mine and
[1:23:49] uh it was you can't even
[1:23:52] really even know what's going on here
[1:23:54] but that's
[1:23:55] way down in the bottom there is uh
[1:23:57] people are actually down there there's
[1:23:59] water surrounding those little
[1:24:00] constructions and people are little
[1:24:02] paddle boats and that's that whole wall
[1:24:04] is a big cavern of salt that's thousands
[1:24:07] of feet deep i believe and and it's just
[1:24:10] an amazing thing so
[1:24:12] at some point we'll be able to uh maybe
[1:24:14] just in fellowship show some more
[1:24:15] pictures of that but that that
[1:24:18] going into here gave me some inspiration
[1:24:20] because now we're we're on our way to um
[1:24:23] service
[1:24:24] in honodora and um
[1:24:27] i just uh i got some inspiration out of
[1:24:29] this because when you pull up to this
[1:24:31] salt mine it's just on a little hill and
[1:24:34] there's just this little entrance and i
[1:24:36] just thought you know that's so true
[1:24:38] when you when you when you come up to
[1:24:39] something you don't just stop at the
[1:24:41] entrance but if you'll go in and you'll
[1:24:43] go down the little hallway and you'll
[1:24:44] keep going a little further and all of a
[1:24:46] sudden you go all the way down into the
[1:24:48] deep depths of it you look up and around
[1:24:50] it's just like oh my and i just use that
[1:24:53] as some inspiration to encourage the
[1:24:54] people to keep going further in the
[1:24:56] message because there's so much more
[1:24:58] that god has for you and this is a
[1:25:00] little clip here we
[1:25:02] they would pop up out of the middle of
[1:25:03] nowhere but has anybody ever heard of
[1:25:04] gypsies
[1:25:06] well i know a few
[1:25:09] and it's amazing though that they they
[1:25:11] they will uh they will just take these
[1:25:14] homes and they'll put all this
[1:25:16] gold and metal and put it all over but
[1:25:18] they'll just you'll be just driving and
[1:25:20] also to pop out of nowhere and and since
[1:25:22] on this trip we were following brother
[1:25:24] gabriel and brother billy uh we we
[1:25:26] followed close behind him
[1:25:28] i don't know for 12 days straight and so
[1:25:30] that's all we did is we stayed right
[1:25:31] behind him so we couldn't pull over and
[1:25:32] take pictures that are only so we drive
[1:25:34] by and so fortunately i caught a little
[1:25:36] clip here and i just wanted to to share
[1:25:38] that with you that you so you could see
[1:25:39] these
[1:25:40] these uh gypsy homes that they would
[1:25:43] i'd they would just put a
[1:25:44] so much stuff on there and all of their
[1:25:46] fences would they would they would coat
[1:25:48] them with
[1:25:49] i doubt real gold but they'd make it
[1:25:51] look that way for sure
[1:25:54] so that was a really neat uh just kind
[1:25:55] of seeing those uh pop up as we'd be
[1:25:58] driving through and also out of nowhere
[1:25:59] you see this big colorful house with
[1:26:01] with all these uh
[1:26:04] real bright and all this metal and
[1:26:05] things all over it so that was on our
[1:26:08] way to juanadora so now it is friday
[1:26:10] evening we have service at six pm
[1:26:14] and we've traveled now how far how many
[1:26:16] hours was that um that was uh about two
[1:26:18] and a half hours
[1:26:20] so this was the service as we were kind
[1:26:22] of traveling through um
[1:26:24] you know we we ran into some traffic as
[1:26:26] well
[1:26:27] we're uh
[1:26:28] running 4 30 4 45 we still have some
[1:26:31] time and now we're having to drive
[1:26:33] straight to church we can't get changed
[1:26:35] matthew just kind of improvises and and
[1:26:37] changes in the car and we get to the
[1:26:39] service we're already 15 minutes late
[1:26:42] and so um brother matthew we job of the
[1:26:45] matthew offer brother gabriel
[1:26:46] and so you know parking's not like we
[1:26:48] have here at our church
[1:26:50] it's like going to a downtown area so
[1:26:53] you have to go look and you have to
[1:26:56] park and you sometimes you if it's
[1:26:58] illegal you just do it you just pay the
[1:27:00] ticket you know you just move forward
[1:27:02] so um
[1:27:06] that's that's just the mentality of a
[1:27:08] romanian you know it's just what it is
[1:27:10] whenever they talked about it was in
[1:27:12] romanian so i didn't know what they were
[1:27:13] doing
[1:27:15] so we we ended up parking so me and
[1:27:17] brother billy we ended up walking a few
[1:27:19] minutes late brother matthew was just
[1:27:21] getting ready for service sitting in the
[1:27:22] pew
[1:27:23] in the chair pulling up his notes so
[1:27:25] then i walk up
[1:27:27] and so we're walking in the into the
[1:27:29] service um
[1:27:33] we're walking into the service around 6
[1:27:35] 15.
[1:27:36] i just got in i put my bag down and
[1:27:39] brother gabriel just looks at me and he
[1:27:40] said
[1:27:41] go say something and go sing a few songs
[1:27:44] literally he just walk i mean parks the
[1:27:46] car walks in doesn't even have a chance
[1:27:48] to move in to the chair he sets it down
[1:27:50] and looks at brother gabriel and he
[1:27:52] points
[1:27:53] so he goes up and uh he leads a song and
[1:27:56] and maybe we'll have a chance sometime
[1:27:58] to sing the song together but we got a
[1:27:59] little clip of some singing here
[1:28:02] that uh the romanian star was leading us
[1:28:04] in worship here it was wonderful
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:23] i was excited
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:34] the saints were an expectation here they
[1:28:36] come believing and you could feel uh the
[1:28:38] atmosphere was charged and they were
[1:28:40] really looking for god to do something
[1:28:41] so
[1:28:42] it was neat to just be able to walk into
[1:28:44] those services and see those believers
[1:28:46] already singing and creating an
[1:28:48] atmosphere and expectation for the word
[1:28:52] and this word this song
[1:28:54] talks about the word having power
[1:28:58] and um
[1:29:04] and here they reply yes it does
[1:29:07] they're just responding to the song
[1:29:14] but you know
[1:29:16] right before we uh
[1:29:18] ended up singing the song
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:22] i wanted i wanted them to understand
[1:29:23] that you know
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:26] when we sing these songs
[1:29:28] they have a meaning you know and
[1:29:30] sometimes you know you grab some of
[1:29:32] these songs that come from different
[1:29:33] writers or from you know just bringing
[1:29:35] it from an old pentecostal church that
[1:29:37] written you know but you know just like
[1:29:39] that song was saying the word has the
[1:29:41] power well you know you're trying to
[1:29:43] identify and explain
[1:29:44] you're the word
[1:29:46] so if the word has the power sing the
[1:29:48] song like you have the power because the
[1:29:50] word is in you so you bring it back to
[1:29:53] what the prophet had said
[1:29:54] you know even though it was written
[1:29:56] maybe it was song the different way in
[1:29:58] the pentecostal church because some
[1:30:00] people came from pentecost well look the
[1:30:02] prophet says this
[1:30:04] so when you sing the song identify what
[1:30:06] the prophet says and if the word has
[1:30:08] power you're the word you have power and
[1:30:11] it just it just brought an enlightenment
[1:30:13] to their to their way of how they sing
[1:30:15] and how they worship the lord and you
[1:30:16] know in in our language
[1:30:18] but so this is uh the service that
[1:30:22] friday night and there's more food
[1:30:25] more food
[1:30:26] they ordered some pizza
[1:30:28] so we ate some pizza that night
[1:30:32] whether matthew was just excited
[1:30:38] you know it's pizza it's american stuff
[1:30:42] he felt comfortable eating that
[1:30:45] so that's the friday evening service and
[1:30:47] now
[1:30:48] we're going to be traveling over towards
[1:30:50] um
[1:30:51] a rod where brother gabriel's hometown
[1:30:53] is so after the friday evening service
[1:30:56] we're going to drive about two hours two
[1:30:59] and a half hours
[1:31:00] to arrive where we're going to stay at
[1:31:02] brother gabriel's home now and we'll be
[1:31:05] staying there
[1:31:07] friday night saturday night and sunday
[1:31:09] night
[1:31:10] and this is a picture of myself and
[1:31:12] brother cosman
[1:31:14] and brother gabriel's son
[1:31:16] whose name is my brother reuben brother
[1:31:18] reuben that's right
[1:31:21] and so now we're gonna just that's gonna
[1:31:22] be our home base for uh a couple days
[1:31:25] we're gonna have um
[1:31:26] um so that's friday night we're gonna
[1:31:28] have service saturday night and so uh we
[1:31:31] got about um
[1:31:33] i would say it's about almost a two hour
[1:31:35] drive over to our for our saturday
[1:31:37] service and this was uh really neat
[1:31:39] because um
[1:31:41] once again i need help with these names
[1:31:44] brother langella brother lingell
[1:31:47] my uncle dennis uh
[1:31:49] brother dennis mcgeary ministered at
[1:31:51] this brother's church 30 years ago
[1:31:53] and i was just i thought it was really
[1:31:56] neat just the same exact building
[1:31:58] and so
[1:31:59] i'm coming 30 years later just to to
[1:32:01] minister in the same place and i thought
[1:32:03] that was really neat so
[1:32:06] they were
[1:32:07] one brother billy was even showing
[1:32:09] pictures
[1:32:10] if i would have thought better i would
[1:32:11] have included that slide in in here that
[1:32:14] brother billy sent a picture of of
[1:32:16] himself and uh uncle dennis when he was
[1:32:18] there 30 years ago and so that that was
[1:32:21] really neat
[1:32:22] and so we have a couple slides at this
[1:32:24] service here
[1:32:28] this was a service at 4pm
[1:32:33] once again familiar songs
[1:32:36] amen
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:49] i have i had fun building this thing i
[1:32:51] really did
[1:32:53] i really had a good time it was
[1:32:55] it was awesome
[1:32:58] so this is more food
[1:33:00] so once again um you know in a lot of
[1:33:02] the homes there if you're familiar with
[1:33:05] what i would call like zero lot lines
[1:33:07] when i there's some communities around
[1:33:09] town where it's like the the home
[1:33:12] adjacent to you is like built right on
[1:33:13] the property line so it's like their
[1:33:15] wall of their house
[1:33:16] is is the end of the property and then
[1:33:18] your yard would start there and so this
[1:33:21] uh where they're having service was in a
[1:33:23] home
[1:33:24] um and right behind us is a wall to
[1:33:26] another building but there's a little
[1:33:28] courtyard there
[1:33:29] and they set up this table with all this
[1:33:31] food and just right above us was this
[1:33:33] arbor of grapes that was just growing
[1:33:36] and so
[1:33:37] you'd see the believers stand up on a
[1:33:39] chair and just grab a cluster of grapes
[1:33:41] and they would eat the grapes and i just
[1:33:43] thought you know it was really neat
[1:33:44] because we had a wonderful service and
[1:33:47] then they come out and they had a table
[1:33:49] spread full of food and and there under
[1:33:51] this uh grapevine we sat there and and
[1:33:54] feasted with the saints there and so
[1:33:55] that was just a really neat experience
[1:33:58] there at that service
[1:34:01] and this was saturday evening so sunday
[1:34:03] morning and sunday evening we had
[1:34:05] services here at uh arad um october 3rd
[1:34:08] this is the sunday before we're heading
[1:34:10] out
[1:34:11] so brother gabriel how to reserve both
[1:34:12] services for his uh sanctuary and
[1:34:15] that's his brother gabriel in his office
[1:34:19] you know you see all the all these
[1:34:20] pictures of the prophet and
[1:34:22] the lord jesus and the statue of the
[1:34:24] perfect man and a picture of israel and
[1:34:26] the flag and just the love of the word
[1:34:28] and he's such a wonderful brother and we
[1:34:31] have such a good time
[1:34:32] you know
[1:34:33] it just it just
[1:34:35] it just
[1:34:36] shows you the love of this message and
[1:34:38] how it they cling to it just as much as
[1:34:40] we do here
[1:34:41] you know and and that was that was
[1:34:43] a testimony so here's a few clips of
[1:34:47] the services there
[1:34:53] this is their youth group just singing
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:35:12] no
[1:35:15] david i don't know if you can pause that
[1:35:16] so we can move over to the next video
[1:35:18] but
[1:35:19] um
[1:35:20] this is about two minutes
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:28] and this these are songs that i grew up
[1:35:29] with
[1:35:30] you know
[1:35:31] i remember i remember the songs when i
[1:35:33] was a little kid five six seven year old
[1:35:35] and we were singing these these songs in
[1:35:37] church
[1:35:38] you know
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:50] so here's here's the song that i usually
[1:35:52] do at a church and let's see if it's
[1:35:54] going to play
[1:36:00] okay now
[1:36:01] that was that was cosmin on the squeeze
[1:36:04] box yeah
[1:36:05] so this was a sunday morning service um
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:22] anointed to just translate
[1:36:24] you know he was just in the spirit with
[1:36:27] matthew and
[1:36:28] you know they were united and it was
[1:36:30] just um the word really came forth
[1:36:32] it was it was uh it was really a good
[1:36:35] time
[1:36:36] this is our fellowship after church and
[1:36:39] no that's not brother darian
[1:36:45] he did not come to romania and
[1:36:46] fellowship with us for one service
[1:36:51] that's brother chris
[1:36:54] his name is brother chris
[1:36:55] christie in romanian
[1:36:57] wonderful brother
[1:36:59] he's my brother
[1:37:00] and so we um
[1:37:02] you know we fellowship around the word
[1:37:03] and you know the picture to the left is
[1:37:05] me and brother billy and his two sons
[1:37:06] and brother gabriel and
[1:37:08] brother matthew at the at the edge but
[1:37:10] yeah there was it was more food and more
[1:37:12] fellowship and
[1:37:13] it was good
[1:37:16] this is the sunday evening service that
[1:37:18] night
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:33] so as we were traveling the next monday
[1:37:36] after the services were done
[1:37:38] we started uh leaving our out we're
[1:37:40] heading to our service on tuesday
[1:37:42] evening to cebu so we had monday as a
[1:37:46] travel day and we were just traveling
[1:37:48] through some romanian country
[1:37:51] and we've come upon some of these um
[1:37:55] areas where you really have true
[1:37:57] shepherds
[1:37:59] and that is a shepherd's coat not a true
[1:38:02] shepherd by shepard's coat well yeah
[1:38:06] because that's cosman and myself
[1:38:09] and those we
[1:38:10] we put those on
[1:38:13] but they were you stop by certain places
[1:38:14] and they they have some of the you know
[1:38:16] the traditional
[1:38:17] um romanian garb or whatnot you could
[1:38:20] put on and take a picture so
[1:38:22] we're on our way um
[1:38:24] i guess ultimately we're going to say bu
[1:38:25] yeah we're going for tuesday and we did
[1:38:27] some sightseeing there we're able to uh
[1:38:29] pull over some of the mountain views and
[1:38:31] here we got a little picture of uh
[1:38:33] uh brother gabriel and sister mary
[1:38:36] and just a little if you could just see
[1:38:38] those mountains behind you we're about
[1:38:40] maybe seven thousand eight thousand feet
[1:38:42] and we had a really neat experience as
[1:38:44] we were just kind of driving through the
[1:38:46] mountains uh we were just looking down
[1:38:48] this expansive mountain range and then
[1:38:50] we kind of looked off to the left and
[1:38:51] then just coming around the mountainside
[1:38:53] you saw there's these little speckles on
[1:38:55] the side and then you you gotta you
[1:38:57] could tell they were moving and all
[1:38:58] sudden you realized it was just uh
[1:39:00] hundreds of sheep that were coming
[1:39:02] around the the side there and so we just
[1:39:05] kept driving down and we pulled over to
[1:39:08] get pictures and we just felt me and
[1:39:10] cosmin both just without really even
[1:39:11] talking like we just wanted to go we
[1:39:13] just felt attracted to to go up there
[1:39:16] and there was a oh i believe over a
[1:39:18] thousand sheep that was just coming over
[1:39:19] the ridge and so we just started to run
[1:39:21] up the the mountain side and taking
[1:39:22] pictures and video and then then we saw
[1:39:24] off behind this there's the shepherd
[1:39:27] there and he come up on a little knoll
[1:39:28] there and we heard him uh uh screaming
[1:39:31] towards the uh uh the sheep he was he
[1:39:33] was hollering to the sheep and so we we
[1:39:36] have a little uh uh a clip here uh
[1:39:39] because cosmon understood of course what
[1:39:41] he was saying because he speaks romanian
[1:39:43] and
[1:39:44] so so john john 10
[1:39:47] 1 says
[1:39:48] john 10 1 says i am the good shepherd
[1:39:51] the good shepherd giveth his life for
[1:39:53] the sheep so as we come up there cosmon
[1:39:55] had heard what he was saying and he was
[1:39:57] uh we started to talk to him and cause
[1:39:59] them started to ask him what you were
[1:40:00] saying and we were able to actually use
[1:40:03] what his occupation was as a tool to
[1:40:05] testify to them about the good shepherd
[1:40:08] and then he went to confirm with him and
[1:40:10] start to ask him what was it that you
[1:40:12] were saying to those sheep and we
[1:40:14] actually were able to get uh get that on
[1:40:16] film of what uh what was happening
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:44] instead of saying something else to her
[1:40:45] he said you call her a wanderer and then
[1:40:48] she'll get back in line wow
[1:40:50] that's exactly with the vision yeah
[1:40:54] get back in step yeah get back in step
[1:40:57] absolutely so even we even put the uh
[1:41:00] the just that quote up there brother
[1:41:02] bran i'm saying and ashamed he says one
[1:41:04] of them got out of step and i was
[1:41:05] getting her back in step
[1:41:07] two of them it was and that's what i was
[1:41:10] supposed to do
[1:41:12] keep that bride and step and so it was
[1:41:13] just neat to see a natural shepherd
[1:41:15] standing there and and he said i don't
[1:41:17] have to say anything else i just have to
[1:41:19] let them know they're getting out of
[1:41:20] step hey and and the actual word he was
[1:41:22] using he'd go you're wandering and when
[1:41:24] the sheep heard that they were wandering
[1:41:26] they would just he just say you're
[1:41:28] wandering and they would get right back
[1:41:30] in and close with the fold and i thought
[1:41:32] how beautiful that is
[1:41:34] that we've received a message and that
[1:41:36] when we just listen to the prophet and
[1:41:37] listen to the message and and and if if
[1:41:40] you start getting off the path is get
[1:41:41] back in step just just you'll be the
[1:41:44] final voice to the final age under your
[1:41:46] messenger and so we just want to stay
[1:41:48] under that voice and that's the message
[1:41:50] that we were sharing with the believers
[1:41:52] in romania that that we've received a
[1:41:55] great message and stay with that word
[1:41:57] and so now we arrived in cebu so this
[1:41:59] was a as we we draw to a close on our
[1:42:03] our
[1:42:04] uh report um
[1:42:06] this was actually an extra service that
[1:42:08] we did not plan for originally because
[1:42:11] our flights uh for we were originally
[1:42:14] going to fly out on tuesday but it was
[1:42:16] canceled and there wasn't no flight on a
[1:42:18] monday
[1:42:19] tuesday and wednesday the airline was
[1:42:21] not offering any return flights so the
[1:42:24] only thing that was available was to
[1:42:25] come to extend our trip to 15 days and
[1:42:28] come back on thursday and so this was
[1:42:30] the service
[1:42:32] uh that was an extra service that was
[1:42:34] added
[1:42:35] and so i started to consider you know
[1:42:37] well lord if if um
[1:42:39] what what would you what would your mind
[1:42:41] be for this service because um you know
[1:42:44] the flights were canceled we wouldn't be
[1:42:46] meeting with the believers they usually
[1:42:47] uh met on thursday and they agreed to
[1:42:49] meet on tuesday uh to be able to receive
[1:42:52] us and so we we come into the uh the
[1:42:55] service there we're like well lord what
[1:42:57] would you have and the pastor greeted me
[1:42:59] there at the very beginning and he said
[1:43:00] i've listened to you i was able to go on
[1:43:03] and i've listened to you preach and
[1:43:05] we're happy to have you but
[1:43:07] we want to let you know that we have a
[1:43:09] curfew and so we we nee we need to be
[1:43:11] done by seven o'clock and you can't you
[1:43:14] can't uh you can't be too noisy
[1:43:20] so
[1:43:21] i said well praise the lord we're happy
[1:43:22] to be here amen
[1:43:24] you know we'll we'll we'll do our best
[1:43:26] but but that's how um they were because
[1:43:29] actually um
[1:43:31] they they were afraid of some of the
[1:43:33] complaints and that night actually i
[1:43:35] believe it was that day that that town
[1:43:37] had just turned red
[1:43:38] um as it was turning red that evening
[1:43:41] and so they were going to be enforcing
[1:43:42] that's why they had to be uh curfew by
[1:43:45] seven i believe so the believers could
[1:43:47] be home by eight so as we came into that
[1:43:49] city they had turned it turned red but
[1:43:51] uh we had service at five
[1:43:53] and so uh by god's grace though we we
[1:43:57] about the first 30 minutes you know um
[1:44:00] we were we were doing uh you know just
[1:44:02] uh some more
[1:44:03] uh perspiration then maybe
[1:44:05] uh you know we were plowing away but
[1:44:06] then the spirit really broke and the
[1:44:08] people really received the word and and
[1:44:10] we felt lord what this was the extra
[1:44:12] service what would you have for them we
[1:44:13] just wanted to let them know to to keep
[1:44:16] going on with the message
[1:44:18] and uh we were able to tie in and and uh
[1:44:21] uh uh use that little experience we had
[1:44:23] about um
[1:44:25] there on the mountainside with all those
[1:44:26] sheep
[1:44:27] and be able to uh uh tell them about how
[1:44:30] this message and how god is as leading
[1:44:32] his sheep so
[1:44:39] so this is a picture with the pastor
[1:44:41] there
[1:44:42] uh brother nick who is that right
[1:44:44] and
[1:44:45] i believe this would conclude that the
[1:44:47] services that we had
[1:44:49] uh that was tuesday night so now
[1:44:52] um we're going to be traveling um
[1:44:55] start to travel back towards bucharest
[1:44:57] but we're going to that evening we
[1:44:59] actually cosmon wanted to stop into his
[1:45:01] hometown there and be able to meet with
[1:45:03] some family so go ahead
[1:45:05] so as brother matthew was saying i i
[1:45:08] really wanted to go by and still uh
[1:45:11] see them you know the family that i was
[1:45:13] talking to you guys about earlier about
[1:45:15] bringing the message
[1:45:17] and that day um
[1:45:18] as we were traveling wednesday we were
[1:45:20] able to stop and
[1:45:21] just go by and just see them and and
[1:45:24] just talk to them and you know
[1:45:27] what was beautiful is that out of the
[1:45:28] four hours that we
[1:45:30] were able to spend together three of
[1:45:32] them were about the lord
[1:45:35] and so we were sitting in his house and
[1:45:38] you know he just started pouring his
[1:45:39] heart out
[1:45:41] and so i had both of my cousins there
[1:45:43] and their kids and so as we were just
[1:45:45] bringing the prophet into the image and
[1:45:47] as we were bringing the lord into the
[1:45:49] image now and as we were just talking to
[1:45:51] him to them about the lord they
[1:45:52] recognized that
[1:45:54] the things are that they're it's
[1:45:56] happened they're not getting any better
[1:45:58] and so they they they realize how and
[1:46:01] and they have the influence of a
[1:46:02] pentecostal church there but it's dead
[1:46:04] it doesn't produce anything you know
[1:46:05] there's barely anyone come in the church
[1:46:07] anymore
[1:46:08] so
[1:46:09] they um
[1:46:10] they really responded to the lord and
[1:46:12] you know my cousin in the back on the
[1:46:14] left
[1:46:15] uh she's in her 50s her name is nicolina
[1:46:17] she that night she wanted when we prayed
[1:46:20] she wanted to give her heart to the lord
[1:46:21] so
[1:46:22] i mean
[1:46:23] he went up beyond what we could even ask
[1:46:26] you know and and and you see the desire
[1:46:28] and the burden that the lord put upon my
[1:46:30] heart and upon brother matthew's heart
[1:46:32] and he orchestrated in such a way that
[1:46:34] everything that he had in plan
[1:46:37] was accomplished by just walking and
[1:46:39] stepping in faith amen if enough i could
[1:46:41] say that it would the lord really showed
[1:46:44] us favor because um with all of the
[1:46:46] restrictions and the traveling
[1:46:48] i mean going through customs going
[1:46:50] through security going into the
[1:46:52] countries and and just traveling around
[1:46:54] um it the lord really granted us favor
[1:46:57] um and we were able to freely move
[1:46:59] throughout the city um and through
[1:47:01] customs and on our travel and like i
[1:47:03] said we'll we just in time we'll be able
[1:47:05] to share more with testimonies and
[1:47:07] certain uh things that god did there but
[1:47:10] this just kind of gives an outline
[1:47:12] of of our journey and how we traveled
[1:47:14] and so this is just a little map to show
[1:47:17] that we
[1:47:18] we went all over romania
[1:47:20] i traveled a little over 2 000 miles but
[1:47:22] about 30 over 30 hours of driving or
[1:47:26] more and we ended up traveling in about
[1:47:28] 10 different cities uh we ministered at
[1:47:31] nine different churches um and be able
[1:47:33] to meet with a number of believers and
[1:47:36] so it's just uh it was such a grand
[1:47:38] opportunity we really thank you for
[1:47:40] sending us for supporting us with your
[1:47:42] prayers it made a big difference
[1:47:44] this work is uh what you're a part of
[1:47:46] and i i had to step back and realize
[1:47:49] that you know what we thought maybe we
[1:47:51] were going to do is going in the
[1:47:52] highways and byways and witness but god
[1:47:54] allowed us to to get contacts all over
[1:47:58] romania now and so we actually we know
[1:48:00] the believers throughout romania so we
[1:48:03] it's on our heart to go again and now we
[1:48:05] we know we can go into these areas and
[1:48:07] be received and then that can be a place
[1:48:09] to launch from in the communities and
[1:48:11] also just encourage the believers to
[1:48:12] continue to take this message out into
[1:48:15] the highways and byways and we want the
[1:48:17] believers in romania doing what we're
[1:48:19] doing here
[1:48:20] we want to be going out in the highways
[1:48:22] and byways because we're looking for
[1:48:23] that last sheep amen
[1:48:25] praise the lord
[1:48:26] so as brother matthew was saying
[1:48:30] fellowshipped over 500 believers um
[1:48:33] you know the church was able to help a
[1:48:35] few families and as we were telling you
[1:48:36] about the brother with the car
[1:48:38] but you know the most important thing
[1:48:40] that
[1:48:41] that we were able to see was the
[1:48:43] fellowship of the believers you know
[1:48:45] even though they didn't have much
[1:48:46] whatever they had they put on the table
[1:48:48] they wanted to be a blessing
[1:48:50] and you know just know that there's the
[1:48:52] same group of people
[1:48:54] maybe with a different
[1:48:55] culture maybe with the different
[1:48:56] tradition but they're fellowshipping
[1:48:58] around the same word
[1:49:00] expecting the same thing
[1:49:03] and so it was just a privilege to be
[1:49:05] able to just have fellowship with them
[1:49:06] so um right at the end as we were
[1:49:09] leaving cbu
[1:49:11] um we ended up just taking a video of
[1:49:14] brother gabriel just bringing his
[1:49:16] salutation to the church and to our
[1:49:18] pastor
[1:49:19] and so i had this
[1:49:22] video of him just recording a a
[1:49:25] salutation to the church so
[1:49:27] um
[1:49:28] this is this is brother gabriel and as
[1:49:30] we're playing it brother
[1:49:32] this will conclude our our um
[1:49:34] our missionary reports we'll just ask
[1:49:36] our pastor to come at this time and this
[1:49:38] will be brother gabriel just greeting
[1:49:40] you and just giving his salutations to
[1:49:43] the church so god bless you

[1:51:39] so now there's a special treat
[1:51:43] so you can further
[1:51:45] experience
[1:51:48] what these brothers suffered
[1:51:51] didn't look like they went through too
[1:51:52] much suffering didn't they

[1:52:21] anyway what we'll do is we'll we'll let
[1:52:23] the
[1:52:25] uh thing that we stand for we'll let the
[1:52:30] elders go first
[1:52:32] and then you can kind of fall in line
[1:52:35] after that whatever pecking order
[1:52:38] that you think you're in but there's
[1:52:40] there's enough for everybody to have a
[1:52:42] sample so let's stand together
[1:52:45] let's keep let's keep the
[1:52:47] uh this work on our heart
[1:52:50] and we're going to put some of our
[1:52:52] effort
[1:52:53] uh and our finances towards the work in
[1:52:56] romania it it it's a work that's suited
[1:53:00] for us having
[1:53:02] romanian uh
[1:53:04] ministers with us and brother stephen i
[1:53:06] i'm
[1:53:07] working with him to
[1:53:09] have a service
[1:53:11] for us and
[1:53:12] he's shy and running
[1:53:15] but i've always i've already met the
[1:53:17] best runner
[1:53:19] from the ministry i ever met and that's
[1:53:22] brother billy so nobody can run from the
[1:53:24] ministry like brother billy ran from the
[1:53:26] ministry so but we wrestle them in and
