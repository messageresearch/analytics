[41:48] [Music]
[41:53] [Music]
[42:05] uh verse
[42:06] 7 it says but if we walk in the light as
[42:09] he is in the light we'll have
[42:12] Fellowship we have
[42:14] Fellowship one with another and the
[42:17] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[42:20] us from all sin amen gracious father we
[42:24] ask you bless your word to us in the
[42:26] name of Jesus Christ pray
[42:30] amen man who try not to be too long I
[42:35] I've been trying to
[42:37] just be very efficient be delivered from
[42:41] the preacher
[42:43] syndrome you know to be able to
[42:46] just somehow speak one word and be
[42:49] understood you know
[42:53] um you know I believe it was a prophet's
[42:56] desire not to pray preach to long and I
[42:58] believe if I have that also it's not a
[43:01] bad
[43:04] thing I want to and I I trust you enjoy
[43:07] the word this
[43:09] morning you know I I've always said as a
[43:12] Christian I believe the word of God is
[43:15] given to to challenge us wherever we are
[43:19] I I don't ever want to get to a place
[43:21] where the word is preach and I feel like
[43:24] I'm satisfied that there's no
[43:26] improvement needed I've got it covered
[43:29] you know uh Trouble Comes when we get
[43:31] too comfortable you know it's when we
[43:34] sit around and we feel like we've made
[43:36] it and you know when we give ourselves
[43:39] various designations I'm the bride I'm
[43:42] this I'm this and I don't need to do
[43:44] anything that's when the devil is closer
[43:47] you know but it's when we take the word
[43:49] of God and we apply it and we
[43:52] continually Paul will say that I press
[43:54] towards the mark and it said I don't
[43:56] count myself having apprehended all
[43:59] things yet but I continue to press I
[44:01] believe that's the attitude of a
[44:03] Christian I you know you will hear so
[44:05] many times even the prophet on the tapes
[44:08] he'll be praying and says oh Lord even I
[44:10] lift my hand so I go if the prophet is
[44:13] lifting up his hand what should we do
[44:15] you know you will hear the the scripture
[44:18] will speak in reference to uh Jesus
[44:21] Christ being the the branch and it says
[44:24] if it was done to him how much more if
[44:26] it's done to us you know if he who was
[44:30] one with a father who knew everything
[44:32] and and he will come and he will cry out
[44:35] and say and and pray and go on the
[44:38] garden of Gan how much more us for the
[44:40] Fulfillment of what God has given us so
[44:43] I just pray that within our heart that
[44:45] we we have the attitude of always
[44:48] receiving the word of God and always
[44:50] challenging ourselves and that's how we
[44:53] can become successful as our Pastor said
[44:55] it this morning and and it this is just
[44:58] something that's been on my heart and
[45:00] and I told Brother David this morning I
[45:02] said he just went basically from Genesis
[45:04] to Revelation so I'll just repeat some
[45:06] of the things they said um and this has
[45:09] just been on my heart and um you know I
[45:12] know a pastor from the beginning of the
[45:14] year he's been talking about the way
[45:16] forward and and how to be successful in
[45:20] those things and and and all of that uh
[45:23] this has just been something that's been
[45:24] on my heart and I believe you'll
[45:26] probably go along the same way um and
[45:30] there's some similarity in what I have
[45:32] in my heart and my title tonight like I
[45:35] said I'll try to
[45:36] be uh uh very
[45:40] short on purpose my title tonight is uh
[45:45] uh God desires fellowship and not
[45:50] religion God desires fellowship and not
[45:53] religion um you know and and I that's
[45:57] say this is just even just for me
[45:59] because I believe sometimes the
[46:01] preaching is not necessarily to the
[46:03] people but you have to look inward you
[46:06] have to you a Believer after you've been
[46:09] in for a while you get to a place where
[46:12] you're just tired of
[46:13] religion you know and and there is a
[46:16] part of religion that's not bad per say
[46:20] you know we we have to have the church
[46:21] ordered they had to be in order in the
[46:24] way we do things and all of that but
[46:26] what we we do not want is to get caught
[46:28] up within that we we don't have to be
[46:31] caught up in uh how what how was the
[46:34] music where do I sit and I was not sit
[46:37] at the place that I all of those things
[46:40] of hey the preaching was it my taste was
[46:42] it not my because if you do that then
[46:44] you're missing the complete purpose of
[46:47] God the it's set up so we can have a
[46:49] certain order that things has to operate
[46:52] there's nothing wrong with that but we
[46:54] want to make sure that when we come to
[46:56] church we are actually in communion with
[46:59] God himself we we don't let people's
[47:02] personality uh uh uh hinder us we don't
[47:05] let the temperature in the room hander
[47:07] us we don't let the noise because of
[47:10] there's a baby crying over here or
[47:12] because of somebody how they're dressed
[47:14] and everything we don't let those things
[47:16] come into the way of what we came to
[47:18] receive and that's what I'm talking
[47:20] about it's a fellowship and and the
[47:23] prophet will talk and he will see and he
[47:25] will say that we we were made to
[47:28] Fellowship we were made to have
[47:30] Fellowship uh you know often time you
[47:34] know marvel how that we we can come to
[47:37] church and often time when service is
[47:39] over people will hang outside and
[47:41] perhaps with one two hours you know
[47:44] sometimes we are outside more than we
[47:45] are in the church and there's nothing
[47:47] wrong with that I'm saying that because
[47:49] to show you that there's something
[47:52] within the heart of men that desire to
[47:54] have Fellowship we like to talk with one
[47:57] another we like to get together we like
[47:59] to do those things and God made us that
[48:02] way it's not anything unusual like we we
[48:04] heard about the The Thirst and and all
[48:07] of those things so God made us so we can
[48:09] love Fellowship in fact God created man
[48:13] for the purpose of having fellowship
[48:15] with him and so he created us he made us
[48:18] we can come and we hear the word of God
[48:20] and and often time you know just
[48:22] thinking about what's going to come
[48:24] Monday you know the the thought about it
[48:26] just messes up your mind you want to
[48:28] have more Fellowship you wish you could
[48:30] spend more time together we love that
[48:32] more than we love anything why because
[48:35] we are made to be creatures of
[48:36] Fellowship we are made God made us that
[48:39] way and he he put in us a desire to have
[48:43] Fellowship God made us so we can have
[48:45] fellowship with him and with one another
[48:48] and and you cannot have Fellowship
[48:51] unless you have something in
[48:54] common uh you know but when I'm have say
[48:57] that they will say that if you find a a
[48:59] a young child with a grandmother
[49:01] something is wrong if you find them
[49:03] hanging around together something's
[49:05] wrong the grandmother must have
[49:07] something special for that kid and you
[49:09] know they we we our fellowship is around
[49:12] our interest you'll you'll find out that
[49:15] when we perhaps the the with the country
[49:18] we from the food we eat our interest the
[49:20] jobs our Hobbies those things creates
[49:24] the need for fellowship and perhaps we
[49:26] do the same type of things and all of
[49:28] that but our greatest Fellowship is
[49:31] around the word of God and I want to say
[49:33] and now has to be the most above
[49:36] everything else it has to be around the
[49:39] word of God uh I remember you know the a
[49:42] couple of years ago um uh we me and
[49:46] brother Mike were in the same room uh uh
[49:49] uh uh sitting around uh we had uh uh
[49:52] some meetings that our company had
[49:54] organized uh we were trying to modernize
[49:57] our Technologies and and the things that
[49:59] we do um uh uh and all of that so we
[50:03] invited some of the vendors people we do
[50:06] business with some of the people we buy
[50:07] stuff from and brother Mike's company
[50:10] was one of them in fact I think it was
[50:12] at the last minute that we find out that
[50:14] we were both going to the same meeting
[50:16] so we were sitting around and you know
[50:18] opposite from each other and we sat
[50:21] there and I went and I did a
[50:22] presentation and they were there in
[50:24] order for them to look at what we
[50:26] were're doing and all of the things and
[50:29] and and and be able to tell us what how
[50:31] we can improve the things that we were
[50:33] doing and all of that and and they came
[50:36] and you know after that you know they
[50:38] came and they went and buy us uh take us
[50:40] to the nicest restaurants around town
[50:43] and and pay our bills and all of that
[50:45] and and so we had fellowship and and and
[50:48] and and around work and everything and
[50:51] and and then couple of uh I believe it
[50:53] was a year or so later it was right here
[50:55] at church I don't I don't know if you
[50:57] you some of you remember we had an issue
[51:00] where uh we were being attacked my
[51:03] company we had a a Dos attack where they
[51:06] were just trying to take everything that
[51:08] we own out of from the internet so
[51:10] nobody can access it we had a lot of
[51:13] customers that were affected and and and
[51:15] so um we tried everything we spend the
[51:19] whole day working on it in fact I think
[51:22] after Sunday morning service I had to
[51:24] leave because it it just continually was
[51:26] happening and we try to call companies
[51:29] around to help us including B Mike's
[51:31] company and and and nobody would would
[51:34] would was able to do it fast enough they
[51:36] were telling us how many days and what
[51:38] we need to do and everything so I
[51:40] finally called bik and I said hey this
[51:42] is what we're going through don't you
[51:44] guys have a service that could um uh get
[51:47] us resolve this as quick as possible he
[51:50] said sure and and then uh a couple hours
[51:54] later I got a call from a VP from the
[51:56] company and I was able to set up
[51:58] meetings with our internal VPS and
[52:00] everything and and and the issue was
[52:02] resolved and right after the call the VP
[52:05] from my company asked me who did you
[52:10] call and I thought it pays to have
[52:15] Fellowship I want to say this Fellowship
[52:17] will save you when you need help
[52:20] Fellowship will come to your rescue when
[52:22] you really need it why that's why God
[52:25] wants us to be in Fellowship ship with
[52:27] him men wants a relationship where God
[52:30] is sitting up in heaven and and we are
[52:33] here down here when we need something we
[52:35] run and get it and we need something and
[52:37] even David will say the the unbelievers
[52:40] their children's stomach is full and
[52:43] they come and they they'll take from you
[52:45] and they'll go use for other purposes
[52:48] and they said but your children are
[52:50] hungry but he said but as for me I will
[52:53] look to your face until I become even
[52:55] like you so David had a pure desire in
[52:58] his heart he wanted Fellowship he didn't
[53:01] want the relationship with him and God
[53:03] to just be one that will come and take
[53:04] and go away but he wanted something
[53:07] permanent a God that he could walk up
[53:09] with a God that he can go to work with a
[53:12] God in fact banam speaks I believe in
[53:14] the message the unveiling of God he
[53:16] talks about this King he said there was
[53:19] a king and he said that one day he
[53:21] called all his people he says today is
[53:23] the last day you're going to see me on
[53:25] the throne and they they they asked him
[53:28] a question where are you going what's
[53:30] happening to you he said well today is
[53:32] the last day because what I really want
[53:34] to do as a king I'm tired of just
[53:37] sitting here I don't want to just sit
[53:39] here and you come and go you come and go
[53:41] I want to be the type of King that will
[53:43] go to work with you and a type of King
[53:46] that will go to school with you and a
[53:48] type of King that will be with you in
[53:50] the kitchen whatever you are doing I
[53:52] want to be the king that's walking with
[53:54] you God he he he has a concern about you
[53:59] he wants to know you better he wants to
[54:01] care about you whatever you're going
[54:03] through he wants you to talk to him
[54:05] about it he wants to help you in the
[54:07] situation you're going but man is
[54:10] designed this type of Kingdom where he's
[54:12] always wanting to push God far away man
[54:15] is the one who stole God he said don't
[54:18] speak to us let Moses speak to
[54:21] us it's man who wanted that why because
[54:25] he couldn't uh uh uh just helped to see
[54:28] God closer and closer but uh God's
[54:31] desire is always to be one with men I I
[54:34] was uh one day I believe I was listening
[54:37] to radio or my phone or something and I
[54:39] heard a man and I thought this was a
[54:41] perfect description of Fellowship he
[54:43] said uh there was a man
[54:47] a a man who came and he was giving his
[54:50] grandchildren uh uh gifts and they came
[54:53] and he offered one and he gave he gave
[54:55] them and then looked at the other the
[54:57] last one he told him it says you come to
[55:00] my house and I'll give you your gift and
[55:02] the other kids turned around and said
[55:04] why would you do that how come you
[55:06] calling him to your place he says first
[55:08] of all it's none of your
[55:10] business second of all he comes to my
[55:13] house when he doesn't need
[55:16] anything so I will give him whatever I
[55:19] want to give him in other word the other
[55:22] one had a relationship with him the
[55:24] other one knew something and when they
[55:26] told him you're going to come get your
[55:28] gift he knew what that meant but the
[55:30] others were concerned because they
[55:32] wanted a gift comparison they wanted to
[55:34] see which one gets the bigger but they
[55:37] had no relationship at all with
[55:40] him let me say this God wants us to have
[55:43] relationship with
[55:47] him fellowship and uh Fellowship is a
[55:51] god-given attribute let me say that we
[55:55] say that even human humanly speaking we
[55:58] find out that uh it's a characteristic
[56:01] that we were born with something that we
[56:03] desire to spend time together but when I
[56:06] will say it's two fellow is in one
[56:10] ship two fellow in one sh they can uh uh
[56:14] uh uh uh talk about
[56:16] anything understand each other you know
[56:19] often time when you don't know really
[56:21] well about somebody all you need to do
[56:23] is spend time with them often time we
[56:26] judge people by what we look and we see
[56:28] them a far off and we think and we have
[56:30] our own uh characteristic build about
[56:33] them but the moment we get to know them
[56:35] everything that we had in mind falls
[56:39] off and that's what God want we God
[56:42] don't want us to come in and and let me
[56:44] just say this uh religion as our Pastor
[56:47] said this this morning religion is a
[56:50] covering religion is a pretension it's
[56:53] trying to do something that you that you
[56:56] the trying to be something that you are
[56:58] really not it's finding human
[57:03] Comfort it it's trying to fit the
[57:07] pattern and with human effort religion
[57:10] is is is is the devil uh trying to get
[57:14] you to fell short of what true
[57:16] relationship and fellowship can
[57:21] produce and and and because remember the
[57:24] the prophet will tell us that if the
[57:26] devil can't get you on one side he will
[57:29] get you through the other so if he can't
[57:31] get you to be a complete unbeliever what
[57:33] is he going to try to do he'll try to
[57:35] make you a church member religion is a
[57:38] man coming up with a substitute to what
[57:41] the requirement
[57:43] is in other word what you have to be
[57:46] born again so religion looks it says
[57:49] okay what is it mean to be born again
[57:51] well you got to have this works you got
[57:53] to do so you try to run to the works and
[57:55] repr produ the work without the
[57:58] requirement of the new
[58:01] birth and and I'm speaking last because
[58:04] let me say this with sincerity within
[58:07] each one of us there's a measure of
[58:09] religion that we need to flash out
[58:12] there's a measure of an understanding
[58:14] that we've built about oursel but what
[58:16] we need is God to come and make himself
[58:19] real to us the word is given so that the
[58:22] spirit of God can come and Quicken it to
[58:24] your heart so God can become a reality
[58:28] we don't want the word to remain just it
[58:30] as an expression within our head we want
[58:33] that which we know to be made a reality
[58:35] into our lives so religion is is men's
[58:39] desire is men's desire to try to show
[58:42] that that he's doing something about it
[58:46] is man's and that's why I said to some
[58:49] measure there's nothing wrong with that
[58:51] but to stop there there's a problem with
[58:54] that because God is offering a
[58:57] relationship and if you stop in religion
[59:00] you're missing what God is
[59:03] offering so religion is man's desire
[59:07] trying to show that he's doing something
[59:09] is doing its part religion is is for
[59:13] show it is so that people can see that
[59:16] I'm religious look at the way I dress
[59:18] look at the way I talk and look at my
[59:21] understanding of the message look at
[59:23] this and let me say this with you having
[59:26] all of those attributes without the life
[59:28] it serves of
[59:30] nothing in fact they looked at the
[59:32] prophet and they looked at him and they
[59:34] said you don't even know your Bible he
[59:36] looked at him and says I don't know my
[59:38] Bible but I know my the author real well
[59:41] what we need is to know the author and
[59:43] the author will give you the
[59:45] interpretation now the knowing the
[59:47] author doesn't mean you don't need to
[59:49] read the Bible in fact knowing the
[59:51] author will cause you to read his word
[59:57] religion is is is for sure and and but
[1:00:00] Fellowship Is For Real it is somebody
[1:00:03] who's not ashamed is somebody who when
[1:00:06] they have a need they're not ashamed to
[1:00:08] say I have a need Lord and I want to be
[1:00:11] changed is somebody who desires to see
[1:00:14] the reality of God into their lives
[1:00:16] religion is is the disconnect between
[1:00:19] the requirement and the
[1:00:23] works it a a it bypasses what the
[1:00:26] requirement is to die and it goes right
[1:00:30] to The Works religion is to go back and
[1:00:34] look and say you know that's why says
[1:00:36] people will come and will say oh the
[1:00:39] question it says uh uh uh what is it
[1:00:42] that's required it says You must receive
[1:00:44] the new birth or the requirement be a
[1:00:47] Christian cannot lie cannot steal and
[1:00:49] everything and you work yourself so hard
[1:00:52] to fulfill those requirement oh I don't
[1:00:55] want to steal it I don't want to do this
[1:00:57] I can say this you can fulfill those
[1:00:59] requirements that still don't got it
[1:01:01] what you need is God by Fellowship to
[1:01:04] bring his word to come to pass in your
[1:01:06] life let me say this Fellowship will
[1:01:09] take you from where you are and bring
[1:01:11] you to the Finish Line Fellowship is God
[1:01:14] taking you the regardless of what
[1:01:17] happened to you regardless of whatever
[1:01:19] condition you were in and God himself by
[1:01:22] his Spirit causing you to stop those
[1:01:24] things
[1:01:26] yeah he said they asked a question uh
[1:01:29] how can I what what do I need to do to
[1:01:31] be born again he said they didn't tell
[1:01:33] them what they need to stop to do they
[1:01:36] told them what they were supposed to do
[1:01:38] that you must be born again because when
[1:01:40] you are born again you will stop all
[1:01:42] those
[1:01:46] things
[1:01:48] religion
[1:01:50] Fellowship
[1:01:52] Fellowship is established by revelation
[1:01:57] Fellowship is God and and for all of
[1:01:59] this I like I said I don't want to take
[1:02:01] too much time I'll just read quotes and
[1:02:03] quotes to to go through all of this
[1:02:06] Fellowship is established in
[1:02:09] Revelation is God bringing his word to
[1:02:12] come to pass in your life through
[1:02:15] Fellowship his Spirit working in you
[1:02:19] giving you what you need in order to
[1:02:22] overcome where you are weak he made
[1:02:25] strong
[1:02:26] and I can say this anybody who's ever
[1:02:28] been born again you know you didn't do
[1:02:30] it by your own strength anybody who's
[1:02:33] ever receive anything from God you know
[1:02:36] even right now you know that Lord if you
[1:02:38] leave me for one second I will fall if
[1:02:42] you stop for one minute I'll be nothing
[1:02:45] if you just stop for one second I'll be
[1:02:47] done all I am and everything I can do is
[1:02:50] only by your grace that's what
[1:02:53] relationship will produce you can stand
[1:02:55] there that's why the disciples you can
[1:02:57] see their action before and after on the
[1:03:00] on the other side they'll talk oh tell
[1:03:02] her to stop and over here they say why
[1:03:05] don't you call fire down to do this and
[1:03:07] everything but oh when they had that new
[1:03:09] birth and they come to the other side
[1:03:12] their conversation fully changed why
[1:03:14] because now they had the true
[1:03:16] relationship why the spirit that was in
[1:03:19] Christ was now in them and they can Now
[1:03:22] understand what he was talking about
[1:03:25] so God created men for Fellowship but
[1:03:30] when I'm will talk about in the
[1:03:31] beginning and you'll say God in the
[1:03:34] Garden of Eden and and and and forgive
[1:03:37] me if I I I seem to go through much in
[1:03:39] this because it's really the burden of
[1:03:42] my heart I can only speak what's on my
[1:03:44] heart and and I was just beginning he
[1:03:46] says in the beginning God created man in
[1:03:48] His image for the purpose of fellowship
[1:03:51] and and I thought about this now think
[1:03:53] about this God who's omnip present
[1:03:56] omnicient God who created Man In His
[1:03:59] Image came down every
[1:04:02] evening think about it now he already
[1:04:05] knew what Adam was doing he already knew
[1:04:08] but he came down every day in order to
[1:04:11] Fellowship to hear from the mouth of
[1:04:13] Adam what was
[1:04:15] happening he'll come down and sit and
[1:04:18] say tell me how was your day they say oh
[1:04:20] today you know we were walking and we
[1:04:23] saw that mountain we saw that tree and
[1:04:26] Eve you know were sitting there trying
[1:04:28] to just get the best view but there was
[1:04:30] a mountain and there was a tree on the
[1:04:32] way and we wanted to see better we just
[1:04:34] moved it a little bit to the side today
[1:04:37] when I was walking I saw this bunch of
[1:04:39] animal and I looked at them and I began
[1:04:41] to name them God looking at man and
[1:04:44] seeing the representation of himself and
[1:04:47] let me say this God could not have
[1:04:50] fellowship with men unless they had
[1:04:52] something in common
[1:04:56] what is it that they had in common man
[1:04:58] was made in the image of God let me say
[1:05:01] this you always have to know and
[1:05:03] remember that you are made in the image
[1:05:05] of God a man was made to talk like God
[1:05:09] to act like God to think like God his
[1:05:12] Fellowship was in the fact that they
[1:05:14] were one they were together in fact God
[1:05:17] was looking at man God himself looking
[1:05:20] at what he wanted to
[1:05:23] be you say God wanted to be man
[1:05:27] absolutely he always wanted God God is a
[1:05:30] family
[1:05:31] man God is not some M somewhere that
[1:05:34] wants to operate by themselves and and
[1:05:37] just be free and run around God wants to
[1:05:40] help people he wants to do good he wants
[1:05:43] to help he wants to lift up the needy he
[1:05:45] wants to help those that are down he
[1:05:47] wants to help he wants to see his family
[1:05:53] together often time we operate like
[1:05:56] individuals like people you know it
[1:05:58] seems like nobody has a burden and I'm
[1:06:00] not talking about you here people don't
[1:06:02] have like the burden of helping you know
[1:06:06] you you people just sit there to
[1:06:08] criticize oh that was not good that was
[1:06:10] not good what are you doing jump in and
[1:06:14] help jump in and assist whatever if if
[1:06:18] you saw it then you go do don't tell
[1:06:20] somebody else you go do
[1:06:23] it we we are above we are made to
[1:06:26] function together just because you think
[1:06:29] you're not part of the body it doesn't
[1:06:30] make you part of the body there's no
[1:06:32] Schism in the
[1:06:35] body we are made to work together God
[1:06:39] wanted he came every evening to talk
[1:06:41] with
[1:06:43] Adam and and and let me say this that
[1:06:45] hasn't changed that God wants to come
[1:06:48] this evening he wants to come to that
[1:06:50] now to talk to you and say that problem
[1:06:53] that you're going through that challenge
[1:06:54] I know about tell me about it he says I
[1:06:57] already know but I need you to tell me
[1:06:59] oh God you know I was trying to I've
[1:07:01] been trying to do this I can't he wants
[1:07:03] to have fellowship and let me say this
[1:07:06] your Victory will come through
[1:07:08] Fellowship we want to obtain Victory by
[1:07:11] religion God wants to give us Victory to
[1:07:14] Fellowship he wants to walk with us
[1:07:17] every step of the way until the results
[1:07:20] are brought
[1:07:22] forth Fellowship is trying to take God's
[1:07:25] power and use it however we want
[1:07:28] Fellowship is the at the the very
[1:07:31] characteristics the very nature of God
[1:07:34] residing in you so you know what to do
[1:07:37] with the
[1:07:40] word power aside from character is
[1:07:43] satanic so God came and made man made in
[1:07:48] the image of of God and and and in his
[1:07:51] likeness to have fellowship with him and
[1:07:54] and what they had in common was the fact
[1:07:57] that man was actually made in the image
[1:07:59] of God man was made in the image of God
[1:08:02] he was made to think like God to act
[1:08:06] like God he he didn't have religion back
[1:08:09] then he had
[1:08:12] Fellowship Adam didn't know what
[1:08:14] religion
[1:08:15] was until sin came
[1:08:20] in Adam had a mind of
[1:08:23] God because the scripture says when he
[1:08:26] named
[1:08:27] them God came and looked at him and says
[1:08:30] that's
[1:08:31] it he didn't wonder he didn't come to a
[1:08:34] place where he says well am I actually
[1:08:36] let me name them and then when God comes
[1:08:39] I'll ask if that's the name and then
[1:08:41] we'll figure it out
[1:08:42] no he was in full
[1:08:45] Fellowship The Same Spirit that was in
[1:08:47] God was in him what he desired was what
[1:08:51] God
[1:08:52] desired what what what he what his
[1:08:54] heartbeat was was he he and let me say
[1:08:57] this the motive was always love he
[1:09:00] didn't do it in spite he didn't do it in
[1:09:03] Revenge he didn't do it to hurt he
[1:09:05] didn't and that's the heart of
[1:09:09] God it it it's when you have that kind
[1:09:11] of heart you know we we hear the word
[1:09:14] like we heard this morning and and if
[1:09:16] you're not careful people don't don't
[1:09:19] understand that God is wanting to help
[1:09:21] us we we can't be slowful we can't just
[1:09:24] come and and and and remember that the
[1:09:27] the the word bam talks about how can I
[1:09:29] overcome it was the branch that sat in
[1:09:32] the water in the water that's supposed
[1:09:34] to give life it rotted right then and we
[1:09:38] don't want to rot right in church we
[1:09:40] want to bring
[1:09:42] life and God came down that evening and
[1:09:45] to fellowship with them even though God
[1:09:48] himself he knew and will say this I
[1:09:52] sorry I didn't take the title of the
[1:09:53] message but you can find it say so I can
[1:09:56] see Adam and Eve Eve going down through
[1:09:58] the garden and the winds blowing and the
[1:10:01] little bride saying Adam the winds is so
[1:10:04] strong and and and he will say peace see
[1:10:08] man was actually made to be God do you
[1:10:12] know that the Bible says Jesus says if
[1:10:15] they called them to whom the word of God
[1:10:18] came which were Pro which was prophit if
[1:10:20] they were if they were God then how can
[1:10:23] he condemn me when I say that I'm the
[1:10:26] Son of God the prophet were considered
[1:10:28] gods it says man was was was give men uh
[1:10:32] it says made a Lesser God as had given
[1:10:36] Dominion on the earth that's the reason
[1:10:38] that word that world that's the
[1:10:41] reason that the world today is groaning
[1:10:44] waiting for the full manifestation of
[1:10:47] the sons of God there's a great deep and
[1:10:49] blessed uh teaching uh in that it says
[1:10:53] that someday men man will still come
[1:10:56] back into his right place is and his
[1:11:01] dominion and will be on earth and he
[1:11:03] will speak to the tree or the mountain
[1:11:06] or to anything and he will he will go to
[1:11:09] his place just like he was intended to
[1:11:12] be we are Fallen creatures let me say
[1:11:15] this today the evening time message this
[1:11:19] end time message that we have received
[1:11:21] is come to restore you to that and we
[1:11:24] have seen it with our own eyes and let
[1:11:26] me say I begin to think yes God even the
[1:11:29] prophet will say God came in the Garden
[1:11:31] of Eden he will come and and now
[1:11:34] remember the fellowship with Adam was a
[1:11:37] very restricted Fellowship there were
[1:11:39] things that God could say that Adam in
[1:11:41] that state will not understand but when
[1:11:44] I will say God can come and say oh I'm A
[1:11:46] Healer Adam had no knowledge of that oh
[1:11:49] I'm a deliverer Adam could not
[1:11:52] fellowship with God into that but oh my
[1:11:54] brother my sister the fellowship at the
[1:11:56] end time is a much greater Fellowship
[1:12:00] why because the man that God had in the
[1:12:02] Garden of Eden had a limited Fellowship
[1:12:05] but at the end time it's a full
[1:12:08] Fellowship the fellowship that even
[1:12:10] angels had no idea what we are talking
[1:12:15] about now he he let the fall happen for
[1:12:19] the purpose of
[1:12:21] Fellowship just I I now I want you to
[1:12:24] understand how important Fellowship is
[1:12:27] to
[1:12:29] God he he doesn't want us you know I
[1:12:33] mean it's like you you take a kid and
[1:12:36] and and you just let him run around and
[1:12:39] you know with some power they're going
[1:12:40] to destroy
[1:12:42] everything it's through
[1:12:44] Fellowship that you bring them into
[1:12:47] understanding it's through Fellowship
[1:12:50] that you bring them to uh responsibility
[1:12:53] and obedience and understanding of what
[1:12:56] our power can do and and if we are
[1:12:59] looking for power without character
[1:13:01] without Fellowship then we fail to
[1:13:04] understand what really God God who
[1:13:06] defeated the devil in heaven God who
[1:13:09] defeated the devil at Calvary God wants
[1:13:12] to deil the devil in your body he he
[1:13:15] doesn't want you to go do it by yourself
[1:13:18] he wants to be in you doing the same
[1:13:20] thing yes sir that's true
[1:13:42] Fellowship but I'm
[1:13:45] say when
[1:13:48] man fall after that they were sitting
[1:13:51] there
[1:13:53] and and it said that then God heard the
[1:13:57] news that man had
[1:14:03] fallen he he didn't say Angels you go
[1:14:07] look and and go tell me what's happening
[1:14:10] but man says God
[1:14:12] himself he came
[1:14:14] down now I want you to remember right
[1:14:17] before that Lucifer sined and he was
[1:14:20] kicked
[1:14:21] out in fact God didn't even look at his
[1:14:24] face he saying angels to go deal with
[1:14:26] that but when man
[1:14:29] fall he didn't send no angels He didn't
[1:14:32] send anybody he himself came
[1:14:40] down because of the fellowship
[1:14:45] and he he's asking as if he didn't know
[1:14:49] Adam what happened who who did this to
[1:14:52] you he he you could see the heart of God
[1:14:54] he he cared he he wanted that he had
[1:14:58] Fellowship what happened to you who told
[1:15:00] you you were
[1:15:04] naked and the prophet will say God he he
[1:15:08] looked at it now when he told them that
[1:15:11] if you eat you shall die he never added
[1:15:15] anything to it that was it but the
[1:15:18] moment it actually happened but what I'm
[1:15:21] say that God right away he not willing
[1:15:25] to be defeated he made a
[1:15:28] way he made a way why because the
[1:15:32] fellowship was so dear to him the
[1:15:35] fellowship was so important to him he
[1:15:37] made way and he said and I saw love come
[1:15:41] down in the form of L he takes a lamb
[1:15:44] and he slays him and he takes a skin and
[1:15:46] he wraps them and he watches them
[1:15:48] walking with the skin slapping on their
[1:15:51] legs
[1:15:55] and the scripture will say that then he
[1:15:58] stopped them and he said I made he said
[1:16:01] I put imity between thy seed and the
[1:16:04] woman's seed why God making a way that
[1:16:08] Fellowship will be restored one day God
[1:16:11] making a way to know that you didn't go
[1:16:14] I I I let you go I'm watching you go but
[1:16:17] the same way I'm watching you going I'm
[1:16:19] going to make a way so you can come
[1:16:22] back what love
[1:16:26] and let me say this we we say love love
[1:16:29] requires
[1:16:32] Fellowship to to say you love someone
[1:16:36] and not have a relationship or a
[1:16:39] fellowship what is it called
[1:16:44] illusion it's an
[1:16:46] illusion love demands that something may
[1:16:50] be done love is there to establish and
[1:16:54] and to be put forth and to show that
[1:16:57] what I'm talking about is real love has
[1:16:59] Works attached to
[1:17:02] it but oh my the scripture says that
[1:17:04] they with their mouth they Proclaim but
[1:17:08] their hearts have fall from me with
[1:17:10] their mouth they'll say Lord I love you
[1:17:12] and Lord I worship you but their heart
[1:17:15] is far from me who did that religion did
[1:17:19] that religion did that but so it's in
[1:17:22] the Bible that says they will stand up
[1:17:24] like the uh I'm sorry I was to say
[1:17:27] republican but the the publicans they
[1:17:30] stand there in the synagogue and speak
[1:17:32] about oh holy is me look at me and I've
[1:17:36] done this I've done this
[1:17:40] and they're not speaking the
[1:17:43] truth they just did it for
[1:17:46] show how can it be that when they
[1:17:49] claimed to have waited for him when he
[1:17:52] showed up they didn't even give him one
[1:17:54] second
[1:17:57] but true love requires Fellowship I
[1:18:01] begin to think about J oh my oh job and
[1:18:06] and and and he was there h i I tell you
[1:18:09] this I I was reading it and it just came
[1:18:12] to my heart job needed something that
[1:18:15] was more than
[1:18:17] religion the the word told them that oh
[1:18:20] you know when you do wrong when
[1:18:22] something happen just go offer sacrifice
[1:18:24] just go offer and they your sin will be
[1:18:26] forgiven and he did it and he worked but
[1:18:30] something happened that job knew that
[1:18:33] even My Sacrifice I need something more
[1:18:36] than
[1:18:37] that let me say this things happen in
[1:18:40] our lives where we realize I I I go to
[1:18:43] church and I do all I pay my tithes I
[1:18:46] pay my offering but that's not enough I
[1:18:48] I I you know I do all that I can and I
[1:18:51] pray and I do that but I need a god with
[1:18:53] skin on him
[1:18:56] that's a desire of a True Believer I
[1:18:58] want something that I can touch I want
[1:19:01] somebody I can speak to who can speak
[1:19:03] back to me I want a god with skin on
[1:19:08] him we we cannot let me say and and God
[1:19:12] you you couldn't have that desire unless
[1:19:15] God placed it in
[1:19:17] you don't thinking strange don't I mean
[1:19:21] let me say this if nobody else desires
[1:19:23] it you desire it you go after it yes sir
[1:19:27] don't don't be ashamed and don't feel
[1:19:29] like anybody is restricting you if you
[1:19:31] desire god with skin on him you ask for
[1:19:37] it job offer the sacrifice and we
[1:19:40] understand we know the story very well
[1:19:42] and after he's done that and and and and
[1:19:45] and everything and his soul began to
[1:19:48] desire more than that he was no longer
[1:19:51] happy you know these friends came and
[1:19:53] accused him and everything and I love
[1:19:55] how the Bible says Joel began to he
[1:19:58] cursed the day that he was born and and
[1:20:00] he says oh that I may know where he
[1:20:03] lives that I may go up to his door and
[1:20:06] knock on it and and sit down with him
[1:20:09] and and put words in my mouth and argue
[1:20:12] with him and and let him tell me the
[1:20:14] reason why all of this is happening he
[1:20:16] wanted a God that he can communicate
[1:20:19] with a God that can understand him and
[1:20:22] he can understand that God but what says
[1:20:25] that job wanted a god with skin on him
[1:20:29] that job wanted H he calls it a go
[1:20:33] between somebody who can understand the
[1:20:36] issues of
[1:20:39] man isn't that what we desire and that's
[1:20:43] you that desire is there so God can
[1:20:45] fulfill it The Thirst is there so God
[1:20:49] can fulfill it he doesn't want us to
[1:20:51] come to church and become a church
[1:20:53] member and pay our tithes and pay our
[1:20:56] offering and come Wednesday come Sunday
[1:20:58] and that's the extent of our fellowship
[1:21:00] no he wants to talk to you every
[1:21:05] day when when you leave your home don't
[1:21:08] leave him in your house take him with
[1:21:13] you when we come to church I hope we're
[1:21:16] not just coming to find him I I was
[1:21:19] talking with the brother and I said you
[1:21:21] know the problem is you know and and I
[1:21:24] always say this we are all Catholics
[1:21:27] somehow we are being taught from a young
[1:21:30] age that religion is that we come the
[1:21:36] responsibility is given upon the
[1:21:38] preachers and everybody that comes out
[1:21:40] here I just come and pay my ties and
[1:21:43] watch everything
[1:21:51] unfold that that that I think that's the
[1:21:54] the that's how we are raised and and
[1:21:56] it's part of every organization it's
[1:21:59] part of it but if you go back to the
[1:22:02] true church that God began he wasn't a
[1:22:05] people that was just got a it was
[1:22:07] everybody had a testimony to bring
[1:22:09] everybody who came in had been touched
[1:22:11] by God they knew what God was in fact
[1:22:14] they knew so that if you came and said
[1:22:16] something that was not it they would
[1:22:17] know that what you're talking about is
[1:22:19] not
[1:22:20] it it wasn't built by intellect it was a
[1:22:23] bunch of people some couldn't write
[1:22:25] their names and some couldn't spell it
[1:22:27] but they knew one thing is they had met
[1:22:29] God
[1:22:33] Amen why it was
[1:22:36] fellowship and I want to say this I I
[1:22:40] that's what I want within my life and my
[1:22:42] heart I want Fellowship I'm tired of
[1:22:46] religion I'm I'm tired of this circle of
[1:22:49] doing and I want within the operation of
[1:22:53] the things that God wants us to do I
[1:22:56] want to see him manifested I want to see
[1:22:58] him appearing I want to see him move I
[1:23:01] want to see him I want to touch him I
[1:23:04] want to see him in my brother I want to
[1:23:05] see him in my sister I want to see him
[1:23:08] operate I want to see him functioning
[1:23:11] within the body God himself education
[1:23:15] will produce religion but revelation
[1:23:18] will produce
[1:23:21] Fellowship religion is man trying to
[1:23:24] fight follow the word of God and trying
[1:23:26] to fulfill the word the best that they
[1:23:28] can but Fellowship is God bringing his
[1:23:32] word to come to pass in
[1:23:34] you God making himself known unto you
[1:23:39] let me say this I was thinking about
[1:23:41] this it said oh my when Jesus said
[1:23:45] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:23:47] blood you have no part with me religion
[1:23:49] came and said this man wants us to be
[1:23:53] vampires what now think about think
[1:23:55] about it so religion wanted to actually
[1:23:57] make himself more holy than the word
[1:24:03] was Revelation looks at him Fellowship
[1:24:07] looked at him and said I don't know what
[1:24:09] you're talking about but one thing I
[1:24:11] know is it's you that has the words of
[1:24:14] eternal
[1:24:16] life when Jesus said who do men say that
[1:24:19] I
[1:24:21] am religion looks at him and say well
[1:24:24] read in the Bible some say you are
[1:24:27] Jeremiah some say you are some type of
[1:24:29] prophet and you are some kind of John
[1:24:32] the Baptist plus two number two or
[1:24:35] something like that and that's kind of
[1:24:36] what I see and that's what I understand
[1:24:39] but oh my fellowship looked at him and
[1:24:41] he says Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:24:43] the Living God let me say this
[1:24:46] Revelation or Fellowship will give you
[1:24:48] the right answer every
[1:24:51] time because why Fellowship will bring
[1:24:54] you close to him religion will drive you
[1:24:57] away from
[1:25:03] him we we we
[1:25:05] don't pay attention that it it's the
[1:25:09] devil's tool that he trying to bring
[1:25:12] within our minds and and and and is
[1:25:15] trying to cause us to to to to to REM
[1:25:20] remember but say this a as long as you
[1:25:23] can Proclaim within your mouth every
[1:25:26] time all you do is just an empty
[1:25:29] confession the devil is there taking a
[1:25:31] nap and is perfectly fine with
[1:25:34] it I'm a Christian well as long as
[1:25:38] there's no Works attach to it it's fine
[1:25:40] right oh I'm a bride go
[1:25:44] on you know I'm the second coming of
[1:25:47] Jesus yeah no
[1:25:50] problem but the moment life appears
[1:25:55] now he can no longer sleep now he's got
[1:25:58] to get to work why because what he's
[1:26:01] afraid of it's not what you say what
[1:26:03] he's afraid of is you having a
[1:26:05] relationship with that word and that
[1:26:08] word operating in
[1:26:11] you we we can make all the claims there
[1:26:14] were those that made
[1:26:16] claims remember the scripture speaks
[1:26:19] about the son of skas
[1:26:22] right we know Jesus
[1:26:25] we speak in the name of Jesus it says
[1:26:28] Jesus
[1:26:30] yeah you know Jesus now these are the
[1:26:34] demons speaking right he says we know
[1:26:37] Jesus the demons had better understand
[1:26:40] of Jesus than they did of Jesus Jesus we
[1:26:44] know Paul we
[1:26:46] know who are
[1:26:49] you I don't ever want to be in that
[1:26:51] situation
[1:26:55] see they lack
[1:26:58] Fellowship they lack relationship they
[1:27:01] just went and took some Bible some word
[1:27:04] somewhere and a bunch of religious
[1:27:06] people and went around claiming to have
[1:27:09] been with
[1:27:12] Jesus and I think we have to be careful
[1:27:16] sometimes to oh I'm a message believer
[1:27:18] what life are you living you know I
[1:27:21] that's why the prophet said I'd rather
[1:27:23] have the right Spirit and the right
[1:27:25] Doctrine why because I want the spirit
[1:27:27] that was in Christ to be in me if I have
[1:27:30] his Spirit he will teach me and guide me
[1:27:33] in all truth and righteousness so I know
[1:27:35] what to
[1:27:38] do but we can make claims and not be
[1:27:42] able to back it
[1:27:44] up I'm sorry I went be
[1:27:54] it's easy to say when you're sitting
[1:28:01] there so it it's the relationship and
[1:28:06] and and the prophet will speak it says
[1:28:09] so the the it's love requires uh uh
[1:28:13] Fellowship when when you love something
[1:28:16] or you love someone it has to uh bring
[1:28:19] you in relationship with that person so
[1:28:23] that that because of the fall of Man God
[1:28:25] provided a place of fellowship and and
[1:28:29] let me say this it it was by the blood
[1:28:32] that God provided the place of
[1:28:34] Fellowship under the shed blood and it
[1:28:36] doesn't matter what condition you are in
[1:28:40] God provided a place that he can meet
[1:28:43] you yes right and and let me say this
[1:28:45] that's why it's so important that we
[1:28:47] fail in love with Fellowship because God
[1:28:50] is not judging us for what we are or
[1:28:52] what we have done what he's wanting us
[1:28:55] to do is regardless of what situation we
[1:28:58] find ourselves he's saying that I'm
[1:29:00] willing to have fellowship with you in
[1:29:02] fact I have a provided place that I want
[1:29:05] you to be so I can have fellowship with
[1:29:08] you you you you know what whatever
[1:29:11] you're going through you're struggling
[1:29:13] with something God is here to say that I
[1:29:15] have provided the shed blood so I can
[1:29:18] come that through Fellowship I can bring
[1:29:22] Deliverance you you you you you're
[1:29:24] lacking the Holy Spirit God is saying
[1:29:26] that I have provided the shed blood so
[1:29:29] when you come under the shed blood I can
[1:29:32] come in and give you the holy spirit so
[1:29:35] it's not oh oh I I I'm not made or I
[1:29:39] can't have Fellowship no it's to say
[1:29:41] that regardless of what situation we are
[1:29:44] in whether we have the Holy Spirit we
[1:29:46] don't whatever we are we have we come
[1:29:49] with the understanding that God is
[1:29:51] providing a place where we can have
[1:29:54] fellowship with
[1:29:55] him he doesn't want us to walk out of
[1:29:58] here as educated Believers and those are
[1:30:02] the tough ones to
[1:30:05] save because now they know how to defend
[1:30:10] themselves you know they come educated
[1:30:14] and they go out educated everything you
[1:30:16] you tell them they find a way to spin it
[1:30:22] around we want to humbly come and say
[1:30:25] Lord I have need of you and I want to
[1:30:29] just be honest I say this I don't know
[1:30:31] how you know someone cannot need the
[1:30:33] Holy Spirit every day and I'll just say
[1:30:36] for me I pray for the Holy Spirit every
[1:30:39] day Lord I need your spirit I I've
[1:30:41] always feel like I don't have enough
[1:30:43] Lord I need more why because with all
[1:30:45] that's happening with all that we have
[1:30:47] to deal with if you don't have his
[1:30:49] Spirit you can
[1:30:52] survive hey don't don't be ashamed if
[1:30:55] you need something don't don't because
[1:30:58] he's wanting through Fellowship he can
[1:31:00] give it to you a church is not built so
[1:31:02] we can come and say I got it who's got
[1:31:04] it who doesn't got it that was not the
[1:31:06] purpose it's a place so we can come
[1:31:08] under the shed blood and whatever we
[1:31:11] have need of is here to provide
[1:31:13] it where we can come and be honest with
[1:31:16] ourselves and say Lord I have need of
[1:31:19] you I've messed up over here I've messed
[1:31:21] up over there a Christian shouldn't do
[1:31:23] this and shouldn't do that I don't want
[1:31:25] to go fix it by myself I need your
[1:31:27] spirit to help me walk in
[1:31:33] it who who we
[1:31:37] fooling and but if a person doesn't have
[1:31:40] the
[1:31:42] relationship then all it becomes is a
[1:31:45] book of law oh H they told me not to do
[1:31:48] this oh this is not do oh this is not do
[1:31:51] or or they go and accumulate at teaching
[1:31:55] and figure out within themselves how am
[1:31:57] I going to fit him like our Pastor said
[1:31:59] the
[1:32:00] puzzles trying to feed ourselves in
[1:32:03] something that we were not made to
[1:32:05] be you know I'm starting to realize even
[1:32:08] through The Thirst that the message that
[1:32:10] our pastor went through that even all
[1:32:13] the desires that comes in you God let
[1:32:16] them happen for a
[1:32:20] purpose God is really wanting to have
[1:32:23] Fellowship with you you go and be honest
[1:32:25] and say Lord I have this desire in me
[1:32:28] it's not according to you how can I do
[1:32:30] this how am I going to deal with it and
[1:32:33] through that through Fellowship he can
[1:32:36] take it and mold it you know the one who
[1:32:40] God God made you to be a certain nature
[1:32:42] you don't go and say God I don't want to
[1:32:44] be this nature I want to be like that
[1:32:46] one no through Fellowship he will bring
[1:32:49] you into what he wants he made you thus
[1:32:52] for a reason he he has a place for you
[1:32:56] he has a place that you would fit
[1:32:58] perfectly but if he makes you like that
[1:33:00] one then you won't fit
[1:33:03] it but you couldn't know it just by me
[1:33:05] talking it's by
[1:33:08] Fellowship it's by
[1:33:11] Fellowship but one of them will
[1:33:14] say he will say he talks about the
[1:33:17] church the World Council of churches it
[1:33:20] says that's why they are fighting and
[1:33:22] and uh over to them eles and they are
[1:33:24] cutting throats and how they can how
[1:33:27] they how can they even get Fellowship it
[1:33:29] says when when people in there are
[1:33:31] trying to even believe in God he says
[1:33:33] infidels and everything else he says how
[1:33:36] can Jesus says how can the two walk
[1:33:37] together except they agree how can they
[1:33:39] do it they only there's only one way to
[1:33:43] walk with one uh with with with another
[1:33:45] man it says that's when you agree with
[1:33:48] him so so so how are you going to cut
[1:33:52] off in denomination and so forth and
[1:33:54] make an agreement when when one
[1:33:57] separates himself from the other and yet
[1:33:59] God wants us to Fellowship he says
[1:34:03] there's something in US think about this
[1:34:05] there's something in us to make
[1:34:08] Fellowship man is always wanting to
[1:34:10] Fellowship wanted to do it but he's
[1:34:13] always trying to achieve by his own
[1:34:16] knowledge how to bring how to bring it
[1:34:20] and he will never be able to do it
[1:34:23] that's right
[1:34:26] you'll never be able to do it you we can
[1:34:29] never quench the true thirsty of
[1:34:32] Fellowship that God is placed in Us by
[1:34:35] our own selves he's placed it so we
[1:34:38] could bring it to him and let him do it
[1:34:41] for us so we can bring it under the shed
[1:34:44] blood and let him through Fellowship let
[1:34:46] me say this when you have Fellowship
[1:34:49] there's such an
[1:34:51] understanding you know that's why Jesus
[1:34:53] could speak in Parables and others are
[1:34:55] looking and losing their minds about it
[1:34:58] but those that had fellowship with him
[1:34:59] they'll just wait when everybody else is
[1:35:02] losing a money say oh no don't worry
[1:35:03] about it he's going to tell
[1:35:05] us yeah how did Abel know what to do
[1:35:11] when they were given the same exact
[1:35:18] instructions same exact instructions one
[1:35:22] goes doeser one way and the other does
[1:35:25] it the other
[1:35:26] way and God looks at one and says I'm
[1:35:29] not going to take yours I'll take the
[1:35:32] others yeah wait a minute you told me to
[1:35:35] do this the first fruit of what you do
[1:35:38] and this is what I did but the problem
[1:35:41] is one had fellowship and they matched
[1:35:44] something that was already existing and
[1:35:46] the others was just a reproduction of
[1:35:49] his own religious belief
[1:35:54] that's why we don't believe the word the
[1:35:56] word of God we it's it's by Revelation
[1:35:58] it's not you going to read the letter
[1:36:01] the scripture did Paul said that the
[1:36:02] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[1:36:06] the the the churches that are around the
[1:36:07] corner is the same Bible is the same
[1:36:11] they read the same Bible that we read
[1:36:13] how can they come up because they lack
[1:36:15] Revelation they lack an understanding
[1:36:18] they like a fellowship that would open
[1:36:20] it up to them
[1:36:24] so it's not the the the actual action of
[1:36:28] just reading but it's the fellowship
[1:36:31] that comes to help you understand what
[1:36:34] you are reading the unic read the
[1:36:39] Bible but it took one to come and
[1:36:42] explain to him what he was
[1:36:46] reading but it couldn't be done unless
[1:36:49] be by
[1:36:51] fellowship and the prophet will say
[1:36:54] it says there there's only one there's
[1:36:57] only and a continuation of the same it
[1:37:00] says there's only one place of genuine
[1:37:03] fellowship and that's under the shed
[1:37:05] blood of an innocent it says there's
[1:37:07] only one way we can have it it says we
[1:37:10] would have to uh uh we would have
[1:37:13] fellowship with every Church uh uh would
[1:37:17] be a Lutheran if every Church would be a
[1:37:20] Baptist or so forth we could have
[1:37:22] Fellowship under the denomination right
[1:37:26] but it says there's only one way we can
[1:37:29] have it we would have fellowship with
[1:37:32] every uh every Church would be a
[1:37:34] Lutheran or or every or or if it would
[1:37:37] be a Baptist or so forth or or so forth
[1:37:41] we could have Fellowship under the
[1:37:43] denominational rights but it says but
[1:37:47] who reads the Bible knows that these
[1:37:49] things makes uh make us disagree it says
[1:37:52] now there's only one thing we can have
[1:37:55] Fellowship under I is like we said here
[1:37:59] tonight Methodist Baptist Lutheran and
[1:38:02] whatever more we we it says when we are
[1:38:05] under the shed blood of an innocent it
[1:38:07] says that was God's requirement and God
[1:38:11] never does change his program when God
[1:38:14] wants make a decision he has to uh
[1:38:18] forever remain with that decision
[1:38:24] it says now he's
[1:38:27] infinite we are not infinite we are mul
[1:38:29] of things so forth we are we are finite
[1:38:34] so we cannot we can be we we cannot be
[1:38:37] infinite so then when we uh it says so
[1:38:40] then we make
[1:38:42] promises we make promises you have to
[1:38:45] break them you do something today and
[1:38:48] tomorrow you'll know more about it so
[1:38:51] you C you so you can you can do it
[1:38:54] better tomorrow he says next year you
[1:38:56] still do it better than you did that day
[1:39:00] because you learn more about it because
[1:39:03] you are finite bound to uh this little
[1:39:08] uh tree Dimension that that we live in
[1:39:11] but God is infinite therefore God can
[1:39:13] speak once and his decision is perfect
[1:39:18] think about it
[1:39:24] and he can it says and can never
[1:39:28] change and that's the reason my faith is
[1:39:31] build on nothing less than Jesus blood
[1:39:34] and righteousness when all around my
[1:39:36] soul gives way then is All My Hope and
[1:39:39] stay for on Christ the solid Ro the
[1:39:43] solid rock I Stand All Out the ground
[1:39:44] and seeking sand and Christ is the
[1:39:51] word I love that
[1:39:54] because the denominational understanding
[1:39:57] had made Christ to be anything oh is
[1:40:01] this and is that but Christ is word is
[1:40:05] the word and is the word upon he said
[1:40:08] that heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:40:10] my word shall never pass away not a word
[1:40:13] it says not one word can fail because
[1:40:16] his God because it's God's word you
[1:40:19] cannot and in the last in the last book
[1:40:22] of the revelation he says whatsoever
[1:40:24] shall take one word or take away or take
[1:40:27] out of
[1:40:29] this or add one word to it the same will
[1:40:33] be taken out his part from the book of
[1:40:36] life therefore any Creed anything else
[1:40:41] that would add
[1:40:42] any to the word of God or take anything
[1:40:46] out of it it's death to it's death to do
[1:40:49] so like it was to Eve in the beginning
[1:40:52] it's death penalty to take or add just
[1:40:56] take it the way it is it says the Bible
[1:41:00] says it's no private interpretation it's
[1:41:03] already uh interpreted just read it and
[1:41:06] believe it God watches over his word to
[1:41:09] keep it therefore his
[1:41:12] word therefore it is therefore it his
[1:41:14] word what we do uh what we have to stand
[1:41:19] on and let me say this
[1:41:23] Revelation and the prophet will say this
[1:41:27] I believe in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:41:30] revealed Revelation through
[1:41:33] Fellowship causes God to whisper to his
[1:41:37] elect the
[1:41:39] secret of what he's
[1:41:42] doing think about it the reason why you
[1:41:45] know what he's doing is because he's
[1:41:48] Whispering secrets to
[1:41:51] you that others don't know about
[1:41:55] is God himself making himself known by
[1:41:57] Revelation and helping you so you can
[1:42:00] make it religion is man trying to
[1:42:04] interpret the text for himself and
[1:42:08] coming up with his own
[1:42:17] interpretation if the musician could
[1:42:19] come like said I didn't want to be too
[1:42:20] long
[1:42:32] and the question
[1:42:34] is why do we need
[1:42:40] Fellowship I want to say this in
[1:42:46] Fellowship we receive spiritual
[1:42:50] strength and Revelation to know
[1:42:54] just
[1:42:55] how to use the word of God and how to
[1:43:00] overcome the scripture will say in first
[1:43:03] Thessalonians 5:1 it says wherefore
[1:43:05] Comfort yourself together and edify one
[1:43:11] another in
[1:43:15] Fellowship there's God support he's he's
[1:43:19] there to carry you over
[1:43:23] so you not only know what you're
[1:43:26] supposed to do but it's God helping you
[1:43:28] so you can get to the
[1:43:32] destination Fellowship brings
[1:43:36] Unity you
[1:43:38] know it's marvelous because bam will
[1:43:41] take this and I don't have time but he
[1:43:43] will compare it to um a person being
[1:43:47] married it said that we live in the
[1:43:48] three-bedroom house you compare it even
[1:43:50] to the Tabernacle you had the uh the
[1:43:54] outer Court the inner court and the
[1:43:56] holies of holies we understand that
[1:43:58] through that process one that would come
[1:44:00] and uh if you come to the outer Court
[1:44:02] you were subject to whatever the weather
[1:44:05] was if it was hot or cold or rainy or
[1:44:08] whatever but when you went into the holy
[1:44:10] place the you were subject to the
[1:44:12] candlesticks and that was the type of
[1:44:15] relationship you had and and it was
[1:44:17] always in need constantly in need of the
[1:44:20] water uh I'm sorry of the oil for the
[1:44:22] cand stick to continue to burn but when
[1:44:25] you went into the holy of Hest the
[1:44:27] relationship
[1:44:28] changed and and when you enter in there
[1:44:32] everything that happens outside didn't
[1:44:34] bother you
[1:44:35] anymore and I want to say this and I
[1:44:38] just thought within my own heart the way
[1:44:40] forward if we really want to move
[1:44:42] forward we desire a greater
[1:44:45] relationship let that that I I I don't
[1:44:47] want to be bothered about what's
[1:44:49] happening out there I don't want to be
[1:44:51] bothered by politics I don't want to be
[1:44:53] be bothered by anything I don't want to
[1:44:55] be bothered by the unbeliever I don't
[1:44:57] want to be bothered by any I want to
[1:44:59] have fellowship with you and you alone
[1:45:01] and that's the end of the
[1:45:03] story you say well you don't care about
[1:45:06] politics you know you don't want to talk
[1:45:08] about the Pres well if you talk about
[1:45:09] the president you got to talk about the
[1:45:11] Senators you got to talk about this you
[1:45:13] got to talk about
[1:45:15] everything and and you know it's almost
[1:45:17] like trying to say oh you you know this
[1:45:20] has to be fixed that has you can't fix
[1:45:22] everything everything what you need is
[1:45:24] relationship with him so he can keep you
[1:45:27] going politics is not going to keep you
[1:45:30] going right and trust me your job is not
[1:45:33] going to keep you
[1:45:38] going what we need is fellowship with
[1:45:41] him and and so we need and he will talk
[1:45:44] about it's a it's a it's a relationship
[1:45:47] he says now when you come it's like a
[1:45:50] man being married if you come in and you
[1:45:53] are sitting in the the kitchen it says
[1:45:57] that's really not Fellowship it says
[1:45:59] that's just you come in it's the
[1:46:01] beginning of Fellowship it's like one
[1:46:04] come to church to believe the word of
[1:46:06] God that's just the beginning and then
[1:46:08] you move there you go into the living
[1:46:10] room and you eat there you fellowship
[1:46:12] and all of those things and you will
[1:46:14] talk that's not the fullness of
[1:46:16] Fellowship the fellowship happens in the
[1:46:19] bedroom where it move from fellowship
[1:46:21] into you become one with one another
[1:46:25] that's the fullness of Fellowship where
[1:46:28] says that's where we need to be we need
[1:46:31] to become one with
[1:46:34] Christ it it's not given to just come
[1:46:37] and and and then just come and we we
[1:46:39] hear the word of God but what God is
[1:46:42] Desiring and let me say this I said it
[1:46:44] before it's what it desired from the
[1:46:46] beginning of
[1:46:48] creation is so that he can have a full
[1:46:51] fellowship with you
[1:46:53] where we can have life his life in us
[1:46:58] that we can bear for fruits that are
[1:47:01] that are going to look like him we can
[1:47:03] do the works that he did we can do
[1:47:05] everything that he did and become one
[1:47:07] with
[1:47:08] him that's the kind of Fellowship he
[1:47:10] want he doesn't want us to be educated
[1:47:13] Believers he wants us to have Fellowship
[1:47:16] I'm walking with him when he talks to me
[1:47:19] I listen and I do it I I don't know much
[1:47:22] I don't know anything but every moment
[1:47:25] he talks to me I want to do what he
[1:47:27] wants me to do it doesn't matter what
[1:47:29] people think about me I care more about
[1:47:31] what he thinks about me than you are in
[1:47:34] fellowship with him let's all
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:49] stand Fellowship to bring us in unity
[1:47:53] because the scripture says that we have
[1:47:56] fellowship with him and we have
[1:47:59] fellowship with one another we couldn't
[1:48:02] our fellowship with one another wouldn't
[1:48:04] work unless we have fellowship with him
[1:48:07] first because have me fellowship with
[1:48:10] him first Smooths out
[1:48:13] everything if we just to create
[1:48:15] fellowship with one another my goodness
[1:48:17] we'll see all the mistakes look at that
[1:48:19] one and it's you know and then before
[1:48:22] for too long you know you look and said
[1:48:24] oh you know that one is not doing this
[1:48:26] and and then you know you move from what
[1:48:29] they're not doing to what they're
[1:48:30] supposed to do and what they should be
[1:48:33] doing but if you have fellowship with
[1:48:36] him then he allows you to look at the
[1:48:38] other one and pray for them because
[1:48:41] remember butam said that Jesus asked for
[1:48:45] one
[1:48:45] thing that the same Fellowship that he
[1:48:48] had with the father that you would have
[1:48:51] access to that same Fellowship ship when
[1:48:54] we meet a sinner what we desire is not
[1:48:56] for him to know all the word of God is
[1:48:59] so that the fellowship the same God who
[1:49:02] touched us the same God can touch
[1:49:06] them if if you want to just blow the
[1:49:09] minds with the scriptures it's not going
[1:49:11] to be helpful you're going from the
[1:49:14] standpoint of what was done to you and
[1:49:17] Jesus prayed and he said father if I'm
[1:49:19] going to do this there's one thing I
[1:49:22] asked
[1:49:23] that you may allow them that the same
[1:49:27] Fellowship I have with you that they may
[1:49:30] have access to that same
[1:49:32] fellowship and God said I'll give it to
[1:49:36] you and that's why the scripture the
[1:49:38] prophet will come and he said that the
[1:49:40] same Fellowship it says the same Harmony
[1:49:43] that existed between God and Christ that
[1:49:47] same Harmony is now existing between
[1:49:49] Christ and his bride
[1:49:52] why because it can only come when we are
[1:49:56] under the same Fellowship under the shed
[1:50:00] blood that's where that could come for
[1:50:03] our gracious father we're so thankful
[1:50:04] Lord for your word
[1:50:06] and Lord
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:10] we always look at your word and within
[1:50:13] our heart with desire Lord
[1:50:15] and the Heart of every True Believer is
[1:50:18] always Desiring more and of the
[1:50:21] closeness and more of the one oness with
[1:50:23] you Lord
[1:50:25] and and father we're just speaking from
[1:50:27] my heart and tonight and Lord I desire a
[1:50:32] closer Fellowship a closer walk with you
[1:50:35] [Music]
[1:50:37] and father not just speaking it but
[1:50:40] really Desiring
[1:50:43] that the union that you promis in the
[1:50:46] end time that will be one as you are one
[1:50:49] father that we may walk in it
[1:50:52] father that we can
[1:50:55] have your eyesight your way of viewing
[1:50:58] things
[1:51:00] and father when we look at in the
[1:51:02] scripture it's so amazing how you just
[1:51:04] kind of knew what to say and knew what
[1:51:07] to do under circumstances and you just
[1:51:11] had the perfect words for every
[1:51:14] circumstance you just knew the perfect
[1:51:17] thing to do under every
[1:51:20] circumstance Father a true born again
[1:51:22] son and the daughter desires the same
[1:51:25] thing
[1:51:26] Lord we know that challenges are going
[1:51:28] to come we know the circumstances are
[1:51:31] going to
[1:51:32] arise but father what we desire Above
[1:51:34] All Things is just to have the same
[1:51:38] nature that same characteristics that
[1:51:42] same spirit that was in you Lord to
[1:51:45] dwell in us and to do the same thing oh
[1:51:47] God help us I pray Lord father I believe
[1:51:51] it with my heart that we couldn't desire
[1:51:54] it unless you were here to to give it to
[1:51:57] us so we pray tonight I lift my hands
[1:52:00] and say Lord just help us where we are
[1:52:02] weak oh God
[1:52:04] and Father come and be one with us and
[1:52:07] make yourself real in every aspect of
[1:52:09] our lives
[1:52:11] and Lord that those that are around us
[1:52:14] and at our jobs and our work everywhere
[1:52:17] and at home and that they may look at us
[1:52:19] and really see Christ Living in US
[1:52:23] that they may know father that we may be
[1:52:25] those that can really project and show
[1:52:28] that the characteristics and the nature
[1:52:30] of Christ lives in
[1:52:32] us we commit what we are into your hands
[1:52:35] father we're so thankful for everything
[1:52:37] you do father bless our pastor and his
[1:52:41] heart's desire Lord to just keep us in
[1:52:44] unity and in your word and I pray father
[1:52:47] you just strengthen him and even give
[1:52:49] him abundant Revelation and the
[1:52:51] leadership and the direction that you're
[1:52:53] taking us I believe this is for a
[1:52:55] purpose Lord and I believe with with all
[1:52:58] my heart Lord is uh it's because we want
[1:53:01] to really be real Lord in everything
[1:53:03] that we do we desire to see the true
[1:53:06] nature and characteristics of the Bride
[1:53:09] being manifested in us that's why we cry
[1:53:13] out to you we pray father that because
[1:53:17] only you can fill it only you can can
[1:53:20] quench it so therefore we cry out to you
[1:53:23] that you come and do it according to
[1:53:24] your promise be with us I pray father we
[1:53:28] commit the remaining of the service into
[1:53:30] your hands and father as we are
[1:53:32] dismissed we C that Lord you walk with
[1:53:34] us every step of the way we love you and
[1:53:37] ask those things in the name of the Lord
[1:53:38] Jesus Christ we pray
[1:53:41] amen amen let's just sing now
[1:53:48] amen oh sh
[1:53:53] with
[1:53:55] God in a
[1:53:59] secret
[1:54:00] place oh
[1:54:04] there in the
[1:54:07] spirit
[1:54:09] hold
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:15] his new
[1:54:17] power to
[1:54:20] run the
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:26] our to be shut
[1:54:31] in sing it
[1:54:33] again
[1:54:38] oh with
[1:54:40] God in a
[1:54:47] sec there is the spirit
[1:54:54] behold in
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:55:01] his
[1:55:03] power to run in
[1:55:09] the
[1:55:11] I to be
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:17] sh Hallelujah I trust we all enjoyed
[1:55:20] that tonight you know it truly spoke to
[1:55:23] my
[1:55:24] heart you think about it with the
[1:55:26] sermons that our pastors been preaching
[1:55:28] and the the ministry's been preaching
[1:55:30] success of the believer and what brother
[1:55:33] Billy just preached just now about
[1:55:35] Fellowship it strikes something in me
[1:55:39] because in the world when you want to
[1:55:41] when when you seek for a mentor somebody
[1:55:43] that knows more than you and something
[1:55:46] that you're Desiring to
[1:55:48] be you you listen to what they have to
[1:55:51] say you don't want any distractions to
[1:55:54] be around because they have what you're
[1:55:56] looking for but us we want fellowship
[1:55:59] with Christ we want to be one with him
[1:56:03] the prophet of God would say where life
[1:56:04] is death can't be yet we say we walk
[1:56:07] with God but we have dead things that we
[1:56:09] hold on to that hold no
[1:56:12] fruit truly if we want success we have
[1:56:14] to have a singleness of heart with him
[1:56:16] True Fellowship is you in Christ nobody
[1:56:19] else
[1:56:21] involved let's sing this song In Christ
