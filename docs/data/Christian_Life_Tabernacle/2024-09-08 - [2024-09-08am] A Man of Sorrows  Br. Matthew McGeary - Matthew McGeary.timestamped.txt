[39:00] the way and just walk us through your
[39:02] word Lord that we might know you in a
[39:03] greater way that you could minister to
[39:05] our hearts Lord we love you we ask these
[39:08] blessings in your name the Lord Jesus
[39:10] Christ amen praise the Lord if you have
[39:12] your Bibles would be reading out of
[39:14] Isaiah uh
[39:18] 53 and verse three amen it's good to be
[39:22] in the house of God this morning amen
[39:24] another day to serve him his mercies are
[39:27] new Every
[39:29] Morning
[39:32] amen Isaiah
[39:35] 53 we'll just read
[39:38] the verse three and four for
[39:46] now says he is
[39:50] despised and rejected of
[39:53] men a Man of
[39:55] Sorrows and acquainted with with grief
[39:59] and we hid as it were our faces from
[40:02] him he was despised and we
[40:05] esteemed him
[40:07] not
[40:09] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[40:12] carried our
[40:13] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[40:17] smitten of God and Afflicted amen we ask
[40:20] a blessing on the word you may be
[40:22] seated just for a a title this
[40:25] morning I want to
[40:27] speak on a a Man of
[40:31] Sorrows you know and last time uh we
[40:35] ministered we we were speaking on you
[40:38] know come to the word
[40:40] first and then watch the miracle and you
[40:45] know a lot of times when we Minister and
[40:47] certainly times as I've ministered from
[40:49] a an Evangelistic
[40:51] standpoint uh you know we we we we
[40:53] preach Revival and we we we we're we're
[40:56] preaching deliverance and and uh for for
[40:59] those to to come out of the valley and
[41:02] to come out of maybe that dark place uh
[41:04] where you you enter in and and you have
[41:06] newness of life and uh from being born
[41:09] again or from being in bondage but you
[41:11] know I uh it it's we understand uh that
[41:15] those things are needful we have to have
[41:17] those and we preach the mountain top but
[41:19] I I just want to say we we also have to
[41:21] preach the
[41:22] valley uh because we go through valleys
[41:25] and we live in valleys
[41:27] a and God has a purpose for that I
[41:29] appreciated the word by Brother David uh
[41:31] Wednesday you know uh uh God has
[41:33] deposited a seed and so there's going to
[41:35] be seasons and things that we go through
[41:38] uh that can break up the ground and and
[41:40] can cause that seed to to come forth and
[41:44] to express the attributes that God has
[41:46] placed in there but it it comes under
[41:48] severe pressure it comes under some
[41:50] heartaches and some trials you know when
[41:52] you would even think about brother
[41:53] Brandon would speak of the gold and the
[41:56] dross you know that it has to be beat
[41:57] out of there until until the one that's
[41:59] beating the gold can see his own
[42:01] reflection in there so uh we never we
[42:04] don't want to be ignorant to the fact
[42:05] that we go through valleys because a lot
[42:07] of times if we're not careful Satan can
[42:10] take a season or something you're going
[42:12] through and he'll just get you all tore
[42:14] up in such a way that you're the problem
[42:16] it's all your fault this is why you're
[42:18] going through this your job situation
[42:20] your family and and this illness and
[42:23] he'll be able to take all of these
[42:24] things and just put it in such a way and
[42:27] if you're not careful we we lose sight
[42:29] of how God has actually ordered our
[42:31] steps to go through hard times we we go
[42:34] through valleys and Seasons where we're
[42:36] we're at our lowest point and it's in
[42:39] those places that God is doing something
[42:41] he's dealing with your heart and you
[42:43] know even as we would we would read this
[42:45] scripture um in Isaiah you you know but
[42:48] you you go back and if you you look into
[42:50] Isaiah 9 and six it says unto us a child
[42:53] is born uh his name is wonderful
[42:56] counselor uh the Mighty God oh he's the
[42:59] Everlasting father and and and my oh and
[43:02] that's what all of Israel was looking
[43:04] for my this this this one to come
[43:06] amongst
[43:07] us but yet then later he says but he's a
[43:11] man of
[43:12] sorrow he's rejected he's despised and
[43:16] you're like I wait a second how does
[43:18] this how does this go together he he's
[43:22] all these great things but yet why is he
[43:24] suffering why are there these sorrows
[43:27] why why is rejected and you know we too
[43:30] being the word being Christ manifested
[43:33] in this day in this hour we too no no
[43:36] doubt we we have all these great
[43:38] attributes and things that we point to
[43:40] and and all the mighty things that God's
[43:42] done for us but yet there's times of
[43:44] Affliction he was a man acquainted with
[43:47] grief and we too on this side we too
[43:51] have to go through times of Sorrows and
[43:54] acquainted with grief and agony
[43:57] and I like this uh how brother brandom
[44:00] and getting in the spirit would say this
[44:02] he says you know everybody wants a
[44:04] Hilltop
[44:06] experience and they never want to take
[44:08] the
[44:09] valley everybody the Pentecostal Church
[44:11] too every night if you're not shouting
[44:14] dancing jumping up and down speaking in
[44:16] tongues and running around over the
[44:18] floor or something another you didn't
[44:20] have any kind of meeting well you know
[44:23] it's all right to be on the
[44:25] Mountaintop that's good but let me tell
[44:28] you your fruits will freeze up there at
[44:30] night and when the cold spell comes
[44:33] you'll lose all your
[44:35] fruit that's what's happened now we put
[44:37] too much on mountaintop experiences of
[44:40] dancing and shaking and jumping around
[44:44] instead of all night prayer meetings
[44:47] down in the valley of
[44:50] decision where you come down there and
[44:53] meet God and really pour out your life
[44:57] until something takes
[45:01] place look at the emphasis now we're not
[45:04] doing away we got to have Mountaintop
[45:06] experiences it's part of it we we
[45:08] believe in all these things but the
[45:10] prophet's showing us there's another
[45:12] there's another way as well there's the
[45:14] way of the valley there's the way of all
[45:17] night prayer
[45:19] meetings he
[45:21] says we've we've growed fruits up there
[45:24] but the freeze kills it that's right
[45:26] every time it comes a little cool spell
[45:29] you've got nothing to rest upon when the
[45:31] emotion dies down then the shout is all
[45:34] gone the noises EAS then where are you
[45:39] at you see it's the valley that proves
[45:42] the
[45:42] fruit it's the valley that proofs the
[45:45] seed when you're on the mountain top
[45:47] everybody can jump run Scream and
[45:50] Shout but down in the valley is there an
[45:53] anchor there and I'll say this for the
[45:57] seed there's an anchor many times you
[45:59] don't even know's
[46:01] there but when the storms come the
[46:04] Trials come and you you want to give up
[46:07] you want to throw in the towel there's
[46:08] something there keeping you holding you
[46:13] when you've let go and All Is Lost
[46:15] there's something there that's holding
[46:20] you The Temptations come along then you
[46:24] can't take it what we need need is get
[46:28] down to that grinding
[46:30] place down there in that Valley dig
[46:34] out as David would say in Psalms 34:17
[46:38] he'd say the righteous
[46:40] cry and the Lord
[46:42] heareth and deliver them out of all
[46:45] their
[46:46] troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that
[46:48] are of a broken heart and save as such
[46:51] as be of a contrite spirit many are the
[46:55] afflictions of the
[46:58] righteous but the Lord
[47:28] the scripture speaks of he that cometh
[47:30] to God must be
[47:32] tested he's made you an
[47:35] overcomer in order to be an
[47:38] overcomer you have to have something to
[47:42] overcome and overcome means to stand the
[47:48] test brother Brandon would say this in
[47:50] how can I overcome and Jesus said to him
[47:53] that overcometh the test the test is the
[47:56] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[47:59] you I believe it's written in the
[48:01] scriptures Peter said that our trials
[48:04] are worth more to us than precious gold
[48:06] it's a testing time it's one good
[48:10] evidence to us that God is with us when
[48:13] we're tested for all children of God are
[48:17] tested and tried James 13 and 4 would
[48:22] say knowing this that the trying of your
[48:24] faith worketh patience
[48:27] but let patience have her perfect work
[48:29] that you may be perfect and entire
[48:32] wanting
[48:34] nothing
[48:36] it's character
[48:39] development when you're
[48:42] tested and when you claim God's
[48:45] word when you're baptized and you claim
[48:48] to be identified with Jesus Christ the
[48:51] devil's going to be right there to test
[48:53] you on what you
[48:55] believe when you claim you have a
[48:57] revelation when you look into the word
[48:59] and you identify yourself with the word
[49:02] Satan is going to test you he's going to
[49:06] try you God is going to allow things to
[49:09] come into your life that'll have an
[49:12] effect on you in such a way because if
[49:15] you're a son you're going to be tried
[49:17] you're going to be tested things are
[49:18] going to come upon you to see if you
[49:21] know what you're talking
[49:22] about and what I love about it is when
[49:25] you fall when you don't
[49:27] passed the test it does not mean that
[49:29] you're not a
[49:32] son no because because you are a son you
[49:35] are being tried you're being tested and
[49:38] as you heard the prophet say the test is
[49:40] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[49:42] you what it's showing that you got to
[49:44] you got to get down into that Valley of
[49:46] decision Lord if I'm not overcoming the
[49:50] test I know that you have deposited
[49:52] something in me that can overcome the
[49:56] test because your word will defeat Satan
[49:58] every time anywhere any place on any
[50:02] ground Lord then then there's somewhere
[50:04] my connection has been disrupted there's
[50:07] something in my life that gots to move
[50:09] out of the way there's a seed or an
[50:12] attribute that's inside of me that I
[50:13] know if it comes in contact with that
[50:16] word and the Holy Spirit comes upon that
[50:18] word it will defeat the enemy it will
[50:20] bring this body into subjection so Lord
[50:23] let me I I need to pour out I need to
[50:25] get into prayer I need to be in that
[50:27] Valley of decision oh God cuz I realize
[50:30] my life isn't adding up I believe your
[50:32] word I I know you've made me an
[50:34] overcomer I know greater you are that's
[50:37] in me than any trial than anything that
[50:39] I can face Lord but I see I'm shrinking
[50:41] back lord so I want to get to a place
[50:43] where I'm pouring out I'm digging out
[50:46] Lord because I want to see those
[50:49] attributes that you say are in me in
[50:55] reality we go through those valleys and
[50:58] hard
[50:59] times and I like this how David would
[51:01] say though I walk through the valley of
[51:03] the shadow of death I will fear no
[51:05] evil for thou art with me I I like how
[51:09] the prophet of God would pick that up
[51:11] and he'd say notice it's it's the
[51:14] shadow of death he says see it's not
[51:17] completely dark because if it's
[51:19] completely dark you can't have a shadow
[51:22] he said so there has to be light
[51:24] there in order for there to be a shadow
[51:27] so David saying though I walk through
[51:29] the valley of the shadow of death oh
[51:31] there is light and if you walk in the
[51:34] light as he is in the light oh we have
[51:37] Fellowship one with another and the
[51:39] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[51:41] all our
[51:43] sins are you walking in the light are
[51:47] you walking in faith or are you walking
[51:50] in
[51:53] unbelief he's with you I want to say
[51:56] there's light in the
[51:59] valley there's light in the valley for
[52:02] he is with you even until the end you
[52:07] know just on that thought I was looking
[52:08] at that just
[52:11] how even though David is writing there
[52:13] and saying though I walk through the
[52:15] valley of the shadow of death I will
[52:17] fear no evil for thou art with me it's
[52:20] certainly not a place that I I would
[52:22] really want to be and maybe if you look
[52:25] at the scripture and in a way of maybe
[52:27] coming to the end of your road and and
[52:29] maybe you're coming to that place of
[52:31] crossing over then we would welcome that
[52:33] for God's time we know death is just
[52:36] just a a tool in God's hand as the
[52:38] scripture would say uh precious is the
[52:41] death of of of of his Saints in the eyes
[52:43] of the Lord so we do not fear that but
[52:47] sometimes the trial and the and and the
[52:49] sickness and the things that we're going
[52:51] through it's it's like the shadow of
[52:53] death and everything's just hanging
[52:55] around your life and and and it's a hard
[52:57] place to
[52:58] be if you've ever been
[53:01] there and as you live this life I'll say
[53:04] this you know life is is is not easy you
[53:09] know when you're when you're young and
[53:10] and and unfortunately uh uh uh some uh
[53:14] Young have had really hard lies um but I
[53:17] would hope most you know as you're young
[53:19] and you don't have a care in the world
[53:21] and and the worst thing ever for you is
[53:23] having to do your homework oh my
[53:25] goodness gracious life life is just so
[53:27] terrible I got to do homework you know
[53:31] and you don't realize the own Comforts
[53:33] that have been afforded to you a roof
[53:35] over your head and and and the bills
[53:37] being paid and a loving mother and
[53:39] father maybe you have a broken home you
[53:41] have a a loving parent that looks out
[53:43] over your life and and what blessings
[53:45] but you know as you grow older and as
[53:47] time goes on you you find heartache
[53:49] comes and a and you lose loved ones and
[53:52] and and those things that are dear to
[53:54] you seem to be stripped away and and
[53:56] that's how life is and just thinking
[53:58] about this as David would say thou art
[54:01] with me you know that's what happened
[54:02] with the disciples one day they were out
[54:04] on the ship and out on the sea and and
[54:06] the storm came in and oh my the the
[54:09] waves were just so powerful you know
[54:12] that that the it tore up their Sals and
[54:15] and and they just got into such a place
[54:17] where where you know brother Brandon
[54:19] would dramatize that and talk about how
[54:21] they were out there you know talking
[54:23] about the things they had seen and and
[54:25] the goodness of God and the Miracles and
[54:27] everything and he says you know that's
[54:28] what Satan does you have a good meeting
[54:30] or you have a Revival you make a move
[54:32] for the Lord and and it seems like
[54:34] things are good you're fellowshipping
[54:35] around the things of God he said that
[54:36] Satan wants to come in and interrupt
[54:39] that so so don't be don't be
[54:42] amazed at what you're going through
[54:44] don't be amazed all of a sudden you're
[54:46] having trouble well if you're
[54:47] identifying yourself with the word if
[54:49] you're wanting to live for God Satan's
[54:51] going to try to disrupt
[54:53] that come on am I speaking to some
[54:55] Christians here that are wanting to live
[54:56] the message of the
[54:59] hour I say if Satan's not attacking you
[55:02] maybe there's a
[55:06] problem maybe he already got you maybe
[55:08] you're so comforted and Lady you'll see
[55:10] you that you know I go to church and I
[55:12] do I do what I need to do and I really
[55:15] don't have that many many hard times
[55:17] Well tired living for
[55:20] Jesus you'll find out hard times will
[55:22] come start start sacrificing your own
[55:25] will for his will
[55:27] you'll find out things will start to
[55:29] happen and things will take place and so
[55:31] the they were out there just having a
[55:32] good time and and Jesus was down
[55:35] sleeping on the boat and and all a
[55:37] sudden trouble
[55:39] arose and brother Brandon would say this
[55:41] in calling Jesus on the scene he'd say
[55:43] Satan he won't let you rest upon it very
[55:46] long when you go to talk about the Lord
[55:48] Jesus and about his Works he's going to
[55:51] be right there to interrupt that then
[55:54] troubles arose all of a sudden the ship
[55:56] began to rock and the sails blow off the
[55:58] ores broke water filled up the boat
[56:00] trouble at hand see it happened suddenly
[56:02] all hopes of survival was gone they
[56:06] though they had seen him do so many
[56:09] great
[56:11] things when trouble strikes they
[56:14] forget all about
[56:16] it is't that
[56:19] true how we testify of his goodness and
[56:22] his mercies and and we thank him for
[56:24] salvation and oh what what great Miracle
[56:26] is it a man who was in sin uh with with
[56:30] no hope but God with such great love
[56:33] would come to you he would call your
[56:41] name look there's a whole bunch of
[56:43] people out
[56:45] there groping in
[56:47] darkness but God called
[56:51] you God wrote your name on the Lamb's
[56:53] Book of Life he predestinated you you
[56:57] that's right is that that never should
[57:00] never become
[57:03] common if you ever let the grace of God
[57:05] become common something's
[57:07] wrong cuz God's grace come with
[57:10] sacrifice a man of sorrow acquainted
[57:13] with grief and Agony he didn't have to
[57:16] do it but he did it for you that you
[57:18] might be
[57:20] free yes we might have hardship on this
[57:23] side but oh it's just a vapor right and
[57:27] because of his great love wherein he
[57:29] loved you one of these
[57:31] days oh one of these days it's all going
[57:34] to be
[57:36] over but how easily when it strikes
[57:40] us we get so so we're so enveloped in
[57:44] the trial we're we're we're so concerned
[57:47] with everything man the the the sales
[57:50] are gone the ores are broke the water's
[57:52] coming and what are we going to do
[57:59] now I want to ask you
[58:00] something as a
[58:02] brother isn't that about the attitude of
[58:05] the people today will'll come to church
[58:07] here and shout and praise God when our
[58:10] brothers and so forth speak the word we
[58:12] can hear the promises we just praise God
[58:15] for what he's done listen at the
[58:17] testimony of that one saying I once was
[58:19] blind my eyes were blind now I see once
[58:21] say the doctor had given me up with
[58:23] cancer in two weeks or two days or some
[58:25] there was there was was it one Speck of
[58:26] cancer that's been a long time ago they
[58:29] can't find it no more yet I laid Bound
[58:31] in a wheelchair paralyzed I walk as good
[58:33] as anybody else we hear those
[58:36] testimonies but just like it Let It
[58:39] Strike our little house one
[58:42] time then we forget all about that Glory
[58:46] that we've been
[58:47] enjoying all those great things oh it's
[58:51] on us
[58:54] now now watch what he said
[58:56] see those things happen for a
[59:01] purpose they happen to try you now
[59:06] trouble that we can't remedy seems like
[59:09] the doctors can't remedy and there's
[59:11] nothing that can remedy so we're not
[59:14] talking about something you know that
[59:17] you can put a Band-Aid on we're not
[59:19] talking about something you run to the
[59:21] medicine cabinet we're not talking about
[59:24] something that you can remedy on your
[59:27] own but something that if there's not a
[59:30] miracle or divine
[59:32] intervention you lay
[59:37] helpless just as in this story of these
[59:40] disciples they were soon to
[59:44] perish they were
[59:47] helpless and God will let you come into
[59:50] places in your life where you're
[59:54] helpless you you you you you can't run
[59:57] you've gone to the
[59:59] doctor he he says there's nothing that
[1:00:02] can be done you've ran all the test
[1:00:04] they've tried to find out what it is
[1:00:07] they they've done this test and that
[1:00:08] test you've run to this this doctor that
[1:00:10] doctor this specialist they sit you here
[1:00:12] they sit you here and they're just
[1:00:14] guessing and they're probing and after
[1:00:16] it's all said and done and after all the
[1:00:17] money and everything you sit they're
[1:00:19] like what am I going to
[1:00:21] do I've tried everything I've spent my
[1:00:24] whole living
[1:00:29] and you lay there feeling
[1:00:31] helpless but what you can take some
[1:00:35] comfort in knowing is he says see those
[1:00:39] things happen for a
[1:00:41] purpose they happen to try you you mean
[1:00:43] that's to try
[1:00:45] me well that's what the prophet is
[1:00:49] saying when it can't be remedied the
[1:00:52] doctors can't remedy and there's nothing
[1:00:53] can remedy
[1:00:57] in that moment just like the disciples
[1:00:58] the sails all torn up their ores had
[1:01:00] broke Waters coming into the boat
[1:01:03] Satan's determined to sink oh don't you
[1:01:05] don't you know Satan's determined to
[1:01:06] take you out he wants to seek you he
[1:01:08] sink you he wants to try to disrupt your
[1:01:10] faith in God and in the
[1:01:12] word he wants to take you out he wants
[1:01:15] to get life scenarios so so bound up
[1:01:18] this way and that way you just you like
[1:01:20] you know what I just I I better just
[1:01:23] compromise on the word or I won't be
[1:01:24] able to pay my bills
[1:01:26] watch
[1:01:27] out that's the
[1:01:30] testing you stand there and say I'll
[1:01:33] take God at his word I'll believe his
[1:01:35] word he's never seen the righteous
[1:01:37] forsaken or ever begging bread but I got
[1:01:39] to work on Sunday to pay the
[1:01:43] bills that doesn't
[1:01:46] dovetail it doesn't I'm sorry I can only
[1:01:49] say the word and I don't mean to preach
[1:01:51] my convictions but it's a day of rest
[1:01:53] unto the Lord
[1:01:56] and many times we want it both
[1:01:59] ways but I not to say names but I can
[1:02:02] tell time and time again where I've seen
[1:02:05] the test come down to a
[1:02:07] Believer they make a move for God and
[1:02:10] they make a stand for God and God
[1:02:12] blesses them and and it seems like
[1:02:13] everything's going fine and they testify
[1:02:16] God gave me a job I was able to move to
[1:02:18] the Aira everything's good and and oh
[1:02:20] now they can actually afford to pay for
[1:02:22] this home and and and my everything's
[1:02:25] just God's just blessing their life and
[1:02:26] all of a sudden well you know um there's
[1:02:31] been a shift
[1:02:32] change and uh we need you to work while
[1:02:36] you're having
[1:02:38] Church what is
[1:02:40] that oh but if all of a sudden oh my
[1:02:44] goodness I'm I'm not going to be able to
[1:02:46] I just God just gave me well God gave me
[1:02:48] a new house and certainly he wants me to
[1:02:50] pay for it he gave me the job and so I
[1:02:54] mean certainly I don't I have to give
[1:02:56] all that up so all all's all they're
[1:02:58] asking me to do is to miss church here
[1:03:00] or
[1:03:02] there well wait a second hold on I I
[1:03:04] thought the whole testimony was is that
[1:03:06] that God had blessed you that you could
[1:03:07] be in fellowship and that you could be
[1:03:09] in church and now that you got a few
[1:03:12] things now what's what's happening the
[1:03:14] test
[1:03:15] comes and how many
[1:03:17] times do you see
[1:03:20] compromise how many times oh God wants
[1:03:22] to bless me and somebody gets a job and
[1:03:24] it's taking them to no
[1:03:26] Fellowship I'm saying there's a test
[1:03:30] there oh and and and Satan can present
[1:03:33] it in such a way we have a testimony
[1:03:35] right here in our church where where you
[1:03:37] know God gives us jobs he gives us favor
[1:03:40] with people He blesses us in in
[1:03:42] organizations and then sometimes you
[1:03:44] allow a test to come in such a way where
[1:03:46] the organization wants to take you a
[1:03:47] certain direction and if you're not
[1:03:49] careful it looks like it's the hand of
[1:03:52] God but sometimes we got to get down in
[1:03:55] the valley decision say
[1:03:57] Lord I don't know what to do I need your
[1:04:00] help and God will come and speak to you
[1:04:03] and you start to really get down in
[1:04:05] there and find out what your desire of
[1:04:07] your heart
[1:04:09] is and if your desire is just to make
[1:04:11] more money if your desire is just to
[1:04:13] have a nicer house and if you're not
[1:04:15] careful you'll follow your desires right
[1:04:17] out of the will of the Lord but if your
[1:04:19] desires are according to the word then
[1:04:22] you can say Lord you give me the job you
[1:04:24] give me my house and then I'm just going
[1:04:26] to stand upon your word Lord then
[1:04:28] whatever else comes oh God I'm coming to
[1:04:31] the word and then I'll watch you take
[1:04:33] care of everything
[1:04:35] else and many times your stand for the
[1:04:38] word can take you into a dark
[1:04:41] Valley inte great
[1:04:47] testing doctors say there's nothing that
[1:04:49] can be done tried everything mental
[1:04:53] troubles nervous breakdowns
[1:04:56] we forget all the Miracles and the call
[1:04:57] of God upon our life and the doubt
[1:04:59] starts to swirl and and fear starts to
[1:05:02] press
[1:05:03] in prophet of God says
[1:05:06] notice trouble that they could not
[1:05:09] remedy then fear sets in just like it is
[1:05:13] now even we got fears and National
[1:05:16] troubles we got fears in church troubles
[1:05:18] we got fears all around everywhere now
[1:05:21] we say well now now what can we do about
[1:05:25] it
[1:05:26] if we could only
[1:05:29] remember that he is in the
[1:05:33] ship see you say but but but yes he is
[1:05:39] in the
[1:05:41] ship though I walk through the valley of
[1:05:44] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:05:47] because thou art with me he's in the
[1:05:52] boat this morning oh if God by his grace
[1:05:55] will help me deliver my heart some of us
[1:05:57] are going through really hard
[1:06:01] trials dark times and dark testings and
[1:06:04] you you feel there's no hope and it
[1:06:06] seems like you're very the core of your
[1:06:09] your heart is being broken and Stripped
[1:06:11] Away from you and you you hardly know
[1:06:13] where you stand your mind is felling you
[1:06:16] oh but you have a promise that Jesus is
[1:06:19] on the boat
[1:06:29] here this is him in the beginning was
[1:06:33] the word the word was with God and the
[1:06:36] Word was God and the word is the same
[1:06:39] yesterday today and
[1:06:41] forever it's still just take this it's
[1:06:46] the remedy it's the medicine it's the
[1:06:49] cure for every breakdown now follow now
[1:06:55] it's a cure for every breakdown look if
[1:06:59] we're not careful we preach such a
[1:07:02] Mountaintop
[1:07:04] religion that we're not afforded to go
[1:07:07] through hard times and to go through
[1:07:09] mental breakdowns and to battle against
[1:07:12] depression and if you're not careful you
[1:07:14] can get a religious spirit on you and be
[1:07:17] incapable of helping your brother and
[1:07:19] sister that's in a valley because you're
[1:07:21] not
[1:07:23] spiritual oh but if you're spiritual
[1:07:26] and know that our Lord was a man of
[1:07:30] sorrow he was acquainted with grief and
[1:07:34] Agony that when you would be in that
[1:07:36] place oh he's he's a Kinsman he's a high
[1:07:40] priest that's touched by the fing of
[1:07:41] your infirmity he knows how to get down
[1:07:44] to where you're living he can bear you
[1:07:47] up he can hold you he can keep you he
[1:07:52] can take you through the valley because
[1:07:54] he's on the boat
[1:07:56] he's with
[1:07:58] you Satan wants you to
[1:08:01] forget the word in that trial in that
[1:08:06] struggle in that
[1:08:09] breakdown in that depression brother
[1:08:13] Matthew you mean a born again believer
[1:08:17] can battle
[1:08:20] depression oh well read your
[1:08:24] Bible look at the message of the
[1:08:27] hour many men of God and spiritual
[1:08:30] people battle depression and breakdowns
[1:08:34] why because they're spiritual they're
[1:08:36] they're they're oh they're on the firing
[1:08:38] line they're doing battle oh you know
[1:08:41] the natural types the spiritual you
[1:08:43] think our men and women that have served
[1:08:45] our
[1:08:49] country our men that have been in war
[1:08:52] and been War torn and bombs and and and
[1:08:55] and and and and the things that they've
[1:08:56] seen and come back and just because they
[1:08:59] hear a loud bang they run off and
[1:09:01] they're rolling on the floor and they're
[1:09:02] crying and everything and you just look
[1:09:04] over and say that ain't no
[1:09:07] Soldier how could that be a soldier
[1:09:09] laying out of the house of God shame on
[1:09:12] you do you not know what that man's been
[1:09:16] through maybe protected and saved more
[1:09:20] lives and brought more people to the
[1:09:21] gospel then you ever will we sit on a
[1:09:23] pedestal
[1:09:26] that ain't no Soldier I can't believe
[1:09:29] he's gobling and rolling around and
[1:09:30] crying like that you don't know the
[1:09:32] battles you don't know the hardship you
[1:09:35] don't know the
[1:09:36] heartache you don't know the valley that
[1:09:39] they're they're they're they're living
[1:09:40] and going
[1:09:42] through but I say one
[1:09:44] thing if anything can resonate with your
[1:09:48] heart if you've ever been
[1:09:50] there if you've ever been in a place
[1:09:54] where it's so dark
[1:09:58] God's nowhere to be found and you feel
[1:10:00] all alone you feel
[1:10:04] forsaken you're losing your mind you're
[1:10:06] having a nervous breakdown you seem like
[1:10:08] everything's wrong but you come back to
[1:10:10] yourself you say what nothing's
[1:10:13] wrong uh my family's right my church is
[1:10:16] right everything's right but somehow
[1:10:18] someway you're in the darkest despair
[1:10:21] you're in the darkest Valley something
[1:10:23] that you never knew you could get that
[1:10:25] love
[1:10:29] oh oh but thank God there's an
[1:10:33] anchor I was thinking you know the enemy
[1:10:36] comes in like a flood it's it's almost
[1:10:38] like if if the the roof opened up and
[1:10:41] and sand was was pouring down and you
[1:10:43] were trying to keep the sand off of you
[1:10:45] there'd be no way to do
[1:10:47] it you try to Shield every fiery Dart of
[1:10:50] the en but you couldn't do it oh but one
[1:10:52] thing we have is the word
[1:10:55] the devil can can be so on you no rest
[1:10:58] in your mind just seem like if you rest
[1:11:01] for one second you'll have a nervous
[1:11:02] breakdown he's constantly bombarding
[1:11:04] your mind over and over and over and if
[1:11:06] you let up for one minute oh the
[1:11:08] thoughts comes the emotions come the
[1:11:10] depression comes those Spirit comes all
[1:11:12] those things they they start to war
[1:11:14] against you and all of a sudden you feel
[1:11:15] like you're going to lose it you're
[1:11:16] going to lose your mind and you got to
[1:11:17] keep saying the word saying the word
[1:11:19] speaking the word speaking the
[1:11:21] word oh has somebody ever been there
[1:11:28] I say if you've been there then if your
[1:11:29] brother's
[1:11:30] hurting or going through a valley it
[1:11:33] will create a
[1:11:34] compassion and an
[1:11:37] ability to reach down and bind together
[1:11:40] with
[1:11:47] them just keep trying to move in this
[1:11:52] quote this is the remedy it's the
[1:11:54] medicine it's the cure for every
[1:11:56] breakdown it's the cure for every Cancer
[1:11:59] it's the cure for every ailment it's God
[1:12:02] manifested word the word is God Jesus
[1:12:05] said it's a seed the seed being planted
[1:12:07] in the right ground it'll grow exactly
[1:12:08] what it is and every promise will be
[1:12:13] produced now sometimes that
[1:12:15] takes a
[1:12:18] valley we forget all about
[1:12:20] it know that he is in the ship they
[1:12:25] should have known that he knew that
[1:12:27] thing was going to happen do you believe
[1:12:30] that certainly he knew it he knew all
[1:12:34] the time it was going to happen I pray
[1:12:38] that would just start to bring somebody
[1:12:40] some comfort and peace and deliverance
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:42] now your sickness your job situation
[1:12:46] your
[1:12:47] marriage your family
[1:12:50] member that did not surprise our Lord
[1:12:58] he knew all the time it was going to
[1:12:59] happen
[1:13:00] why why did he do
[1:13:03] it why did God all let this come upon
[1:13:06] your
[1:13:08] family why did God allow this sickness
[1:13:10] to come upon your
[1:13:14] life say what it
[1:13:18] is why are you going through this why
[1:13:21] are you living in this Valley
[1:13:28] why he only did it to
[1:13:31] prove to
[1:13:33] test their
[1:13:36] faith and sometimes he does the same
[1:13:40] thing for you and
[1:13:41] me he lets things happen just to see
[1:13:45] what we'll do about
[1:13:48] it do you believe
[1:13:51] that the scripture said every son that
[1:13:53] cometh to God must be tried Chason
[1:13:56] proved Satan will make you prove every
[1:14:00] inch of ground that you
[1:14:03] claim he certainly will so sometimes God
[1:14:07] lets those things
[1:14:10] happen so now think about
[1:14:13] that you're going to be challenged on
[1:14:15] every inch of ground you
[1:14:19] claim we live in an
[1:14:22] age where we can claim all ground
[1:14:26] yes every promise is
[1:14:31] yours you are the bride you can do the
[1:14:34] Greater Works you can speak to the
[1:14:40] mountain we claim that we believe
[1:14:45] that maybe I can say it again I know
[1:14:47] this ain't a shouting service
[1:14:50] but do you believe it do you believe
[1:14:53] that you can do the Greater Works do you
[1:14:55] believe you are that Invincible Army
[1:14:57] that Malachi 45 spoke
[1:14:59] of I believe it with all my heart do you
[1:15:02] believe oh if the Lord did not carry in
[1:15:05] a moment in a twinkling of an eye you'll
[1:15:08] be
[1:15:13] changed Satan will make you prove every
[1:15:16] inch of ground that you claim he
[1:15:19] certainly will so sometimes God lets
[1:15:23] those things happen all right so now
[1:15:27] okay we're in the
[1:15:29] valley oh we're coming off the
[1:15:33] Mountaintop and some valleys can be
[1:15:37] long
[1:15:38] narrow
[1:15:40] dark
[1:15:43] hard not just a month or
[1:15:47] two they can be
[1:15:52] Seasons sometimes you'll go through a
[1:15:56] valley and God will take you
[1:16:01] home so we know and we believe the word
[1:16:03] and everything that has been
[1:16:09] spoken but don't be surprised when you
[1:16:11] go into the
[1:16:12] valley and you feel like you don't feel
[1:16:15] his
[1:16:19] presence you haven't heard from God in a
[1:16:21] long
[1:16:23] time you've prayed to be delivered
[1:16:25] you've come up for prayer you Proclaim I
[1:16:29] believe and now the time just keeps
[1:16:32] rolling
[1:16:33] on what are you going to do about
[1:16:38] it hey let's get down to where we're
[1:16:40] living what
[1:16:42] about the Sanctified life what about oh
[1:16:46] I got the victory over this and that and
[1:16:49] that Spirit of lust and and these
[1:16:50] problems and over the internet and and
[1:16:53] over social media and all of a sudden
[1:16:56] the test comes
[1:16:57] back what do you do
[1:17:01] now brother brandom says in the invasion
[1:17:05] of the United States he says I'm afraid
[1:17:07] we've made it too
[1:17:09] easy I think love I think Joy certainly
[1:17:12] I I believe that all Joys lays in Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ that's right I believe it's
[1:17:17] joyful and happy but remember
[1:17:20] brother it's the way of Agony and
[1:17:25] suffering and the
[1:17:27] cross you must realize that
[1:17:32] too that's right I wonder if we haven't
[1:17:35] painted it a little too
[1:17:38] [Music]
[1:17:41] smooth oh it's just a bunch of Joy
[1:17:44] running around like Superman Mountain be
[1:17:48] moved and we're all just one of these
[1:17:51] days I'm going to be
[1:17:53] Superman no
[1:17:55] no when I look at the life of my Lord
[1:17:59] no oh was he was his is his name
[1:18:04] wonderful is he the
[1:18:06] counselor is he the Prince of Peace is
[1:18:09] he the Mighty God is he the Everlasting
[1:18:12] father and in all that he was a man of
[1:18:17] sorrow a Man of Sorrows you know sorrow
[1:18:20] means
[1:18:21] pain mentally or physically
[1:18:26] many times we
[1:18:29] dismiss the mental pain and I say out of
[1:18:33] any age that we've ever lived in no
[1:18:35] coincidence the prophet preaches the
[1:18:38] greatest battle ever
[1:18:40] fought and it's up here in your mind and
[1:18:43] if we ever live in an age where your
[1:18:44] mind is constantly
[1:18:48] bombarded I mean when's the last time
[1:18:50] you got out in nature and just let the
[1:18:51] trees and the birds and the skies and
[1:18:54] the and and the clouds talk to
[1:18:56] you because I one thing I love about it
[1:19:00] you won't find it
[1:19:04] negativity they can minister to
[1:19:07] you that Cool Breeze or you see the
[1:19:10] birds or the the animals and the Rolling
[1:19:14] Hills you get away and then you can find
[1:19:16] some
[1:19:18] peace but oh there's spirits on the
[1:19:21] cities and the towns and your jobs and
[1:19:24] wherever you are and it could just wear
[1:19:26] on you I wonder if we haven't painted a
[1:19:29] little too
[1:19:30] smooth where we forget you know what I
[1:19:32] got to
[1:19:34] fight this is a
[1:19:38] battle it's not
[1:19:41] smooth it's not
[1:19:45] easy and remember it's the way of
[1:19:49] suffering it's a way of
[1:19:51] Agony it's the way of the cross
[1:19:55] just as our text would say he was
[1:19:57] despised and rejected a man of sorrow
[1:19:59] acquainted with
[1:20:03] grief I want to bring your attention out
[1:20:06] of the saman church
[1:20:10] age he says he may commit you to death
[1:20:13] as he did
[1:20:14] Paul everybody feeling
[1:20:18] okay let God speak to your heart
[1:20:22] because it's in the valley if we're not
[1:20:24] careful we lose sight of what God's
[1:20:28] doing it's in the valley where we we we
[1:20:31] start to long for the Mountaintop and we
[1:20:33] miss what God's doing in the
[1:20:36] valley see God will bring you into a
[1:20:38] trial he'll bring you to a valley and
[1:20:40] and because of you claim and because of
[1:20:42] the seed and because of the word it's in
[1:20:44] that Valley that your fruit that seed
[1:20:46] word is going to be
[1:20:49] proved that you can stand a test he says
[1:20:51] he may commit you to death as he did
[1:20:53] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[1:20:55] he did job that is his prerogative he is
[1:20:58] Sovereign but it's all with a purpose if
[1:21:00] he did not have a purpose then he would
[1:21:02] be the author of frustration and not of
[1:21:07] Peace oh if we've if we've ever lived in
[1:21:10] a time you know in this age there's such
[1:21:13] senseless acts of violence and and and
[1:21:17] just it's just uh hard to understand all
[1:21:20] of the the things that we go
[1:21:23] through and you see how there's school
[1:21:26] shootings and a and hardship at Young
[1:21:29] ages
[1:21:30] and people go through great tragedies
[1:21:33] and great
[1:21:36] losses there's people who have broken
[1:21:38] marriages and broken homes and they're
[1:21:40] estrange from their children or their
[1:21:42] spouse and and it leaves people with
[1:21:44] broken hearts and crushed and feeling
[1:21:46] empty and they they feel like they're
[1:21:48] Shipwrecked yes that's that's the people
[1:21:51] we that's all of us we go through the
[1:21:54] times and these
[1:21:57] hardships as job would say in in in 141
[1:22:01] he says the man that is born of a woman
[1:22:03] is a few days and full of
[1:22:05] trouble Paul would say if if we only had
[1:22:08] hope of Christ in this life then we're a
[1:22:10] people most
[1:22:11] miserable because there's there's a
[1:22:14] Greater Hope Beyond this life because
[1:22:16] it's full of trouble it's full of
[1:22:18] Heartache it's full of
[1:22:21] Sorrows I I was listening to rejected
[1:22:24] King there a mother comes up and she's
[1:22:26] just so overwhelmed and and to me I
[1:22:29] thought it was so amazing because Here
[1:22:31] Comes This Woman She's overwhelmed and
[1:22:33] now here stands the gift of God
[1:22:35] Discerning the heart he's standing there
[1:22:37] and she comes up and he says I see a
[1:22:39] beautiful woman standing over
[1:22:43] there speaking of beyond the curtain of
[1:22:46] time and she goes oh no I'm not praying
[1:22:49] I'm not I'm I'm I'm up here I'm I'm for
[1:22:52] my Bo I'm I'm here for my boy
[1:22:56] now now I think what's profound she was
[1:22:58] missing it she's like I I'm I'm up here
[1:23:00] for my boy go he go and he goes oh oh he
[1:23:04] he's he he's he's gone out he's like no
[1:23:07] no he's he's in the hands of God he goes
[1:23:09] oh Oh you mean he's gone on he goes yes
[1:23:13] and I I don't want to be here anymore I
[1:23:15] just want to go to
[1:23:17] him and she was in such grief and
[1:23:20] despair and she said oh I just want to
[1:23:23] go if God would just take my life I want
[1:23:24] to go be with my boy and I thought
[1:23:27] amazing here as she would stand up there
[1:23:29] that God would give her the very end say
[1:23:31] look you're going to be there I see you
[1:23:34] standing over there as a young woman the
[1:23:36] prophet would come back and he say look
[1:23:38] you're going to meet your son it's just
[1:23:39] a short span on this side I say what a
[1:23:42] great comfort and a great peace that
[1:23:44] that a mother was going through the
[1:23:46] greatest
[1:23:47] grief of losing a child and she was
[1:23:50] seeking something from God and God was
[1:23:52] telling her don't worry
[1:23:55] I've already made a way for you I'm
[1:23:57] going to bring you into a union you're
[1:23:59] going to see your boy again I say oh
[1:24:01] that would be bring some comfort in the
[1:24:04] midst of the
[1:24:07] trial but we go through these things
[1:24:09] church that doesn't make you less of a
[1:24:12] Christian it's God allowing the trial to
[1:24:16] test your faith and prove that you
[1:24:17] really
[1:24:22] are his Purp
[1:24:24] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:24:29] while thank
[1:24:31] you we would be made perfect be
[1:24:35] established and strengthened and
[1:24:38] settled
[1:24:40] now I want to just say that being
[1:24:42] settled is not a
[1:24:45] mindset as here not too long ago God was
[1:24:49] dealing with me I'm being settled just
[1:24:51] you know you be
[1:24:52] settled you're aable you're
[1:24:55] settled that's not something that's a
[1:24:58] can be a
[1:24:59] mindset it has to be a
[1:25:03] character I don't know it just makes me
[1:25:05] think of Stonewall
[1:25:07] Jackson you can't talk yourself into
[1:25:10] being a Stonewall
[1:25:11] Jackson I'm just gonna be just like
[1:25:14] Stonewall Jackson I'm gonna stand there
[1:25:17] let the bullets fly let the Cannons go I
[1:25:20] guarantee you you can get up there and
[1:25:21] talk yourself into it
[1:25:24] let them bullets start
[1:25:26] flying let that Cannon go off and I'll
[1:25:29] see whether you're a stone wall or
[1:25:31] not and I dare to say you'd be off of
[1:25:35] your high horse real
[1:25:37] quick but there was something in that
[1:25:40] man there was a character there I
[1:25:43] believe there was a
[1:25:45] faith believing in
[1:25:49] God see to be
[1:25:52] settled it has to go beyond the five
[1:25:56] senses it has to be a character within
[1:25:59] you that you're resting on something
[1:26:00] beyond what your mind can figure
[1:26:05] out as job said he puts strength in us
[1:26:09] there it is you see he himself suffered
[1:26:13] he learned obedience by the things that
[1:26:15] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[1:26:19] by the things that he suffered Hebrews
[1:26:22] 58-9 though he were a son yet learned he
[1:26:25] obedience by the things which he
[1:26:27] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:26:29] became the author of Eternal salvation
[1:26:31] and all them that obey him in plain
[1:26:34] language I like plain language in plain
[1:26:38] language the very character of Jesus was
[1:26:40] perfected by
[1:26:43] suffering and according to
[1:26:46] Paul he has left his church a measure of
[1:26:51] suffering that they too
[1:26:54] by their faith in God while suffering
[1:26:56] for him would come to a place of
[1:27:02] perfection now Satan's going to try you
[1:27:04] on that you're going to go through some
[1:27:07] hard
[1:27:08] times we say I believe it I'm the bride
[1:27:11] without spot without
[1:27:14] wrinkle
[1:27:17] amen well the trials and the text are
[1:27:19] going to come to mold that character
[1:27:21] into
[1:27:22] you because what character is
[1:27:25] a a
[1:27:27] victory character is not a gift so then
[1:27:30] all of the attributes that are laying
[1:27:32] inside of you the trials and tests are
[1:27:34] going to come so that you get the
[1:27:36] Victory and have the character that's
[1:27:37] laying within the seed that's already in
[1:27:43] you hey this is this is this is good
[1:27:45] food for your
[1:27:49] soul we get so wrapped up in lady OA we
[1:27:52] think putting on a tape once a week and
[1:27:54] coming to church that's going to create
[1:27:56] the body
[1:27:58] change oh I'm just going through another
[1:28:00] hard time and I'll just bite my time
[1:28:03] let's find out what God is trying to do
[1:28:04] in your life let's find out maybe if
[1:28:07] you're not failing a few tests and God's
[1:28:10] allowing you to go through these things
[1:28:11] because he's calling for a deeper
[1:28:12] consecration in your
[1:28:14] life and and just think about this now
[1:28:16] as we we just try to turn a corner
[1:28:18] towards a
[1:28:20] close just as he mentioned job let's
[1:28:23] look at job for a few minutes we'll just
[1:28:25] try to be maybe about 10 15 more minutes
[1:28:28] we'll have to just quit but I I don't
[1:28:31] want to lose you by being too
[1:28:33] long and pray something that would be
[1:28:36] said that can help you in the season
[1:28:38] that you're going
[1:28:40] through but if you look into Job chapter
[1:28:43] one maybe you just turn in your
[1:28:50] Bibles I think this is
[1:28:57] an amazing portion in scripture in Job 1
[1:29:02] verse seven it says and the Lord said
[1:29:04] unto
[1:29:05] Satan whence comest thou then Satan
[1:29:09] answered the Lord and said from going to
[1:29:11] and fro in all the Earth from walking up
[1:29:13] and down
[1:29:14] it and you know Lord Al obviously knew
[1:29:18] what he was walking up and down at
[1:29:21] four because he he's going about like
[1:29:24] roing line seeking whom he may devour
[1:29:26] right so God knew his intent so he just
[1:29:29] comes right out and says it and says
[1:29:31] okay the Lord said unto Satan hath you
[1:29:33] considered my servant job
[1:29:36] now here's what I want you to see he
[1:29:39] said that there is none like him in all
[1:29:41] the earth a perfect and upright man one
[1:29:45] that feareth God and a showeth
[1:29:48] evil then Satan answered the Lord and
[1:29:50] said do does job not fear for not
[1:29:54] go to the next verse heast thou not made
[1:29:58] a hedge about him and about his house
[1:29:59] and about all that he hath on every side
[1:30:02] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[1:30:03] and his substance and his increase in
[1:30:05] the
[1:30:07] land now now now look at God's thoughts
[1:30:10] towards
[1:30:13] him of he's he's a perfect and upright
[1:30:16] man in his generation there's none like
[1:30:20] him now don't you know that God's
[1:30:22] speaking the same thing about you that
[1:30:25] you're perfect and
[1:30:27] upright I just pull up Ephesians 1 look
[1:30:31] look at look at how God speaks
[1:30:35] concerning you if you pull up Ephesians
[1:30:38] 1:1 I don't know we don't have to turn
[1:30:40] there but I thought we
[1:30:44] could there we are thank you Paul an
[1:30:47] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:30:49] God to the sanctuary at Ephesus and to
[1:30:51] the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:30:54] Grace be to you and peace from God our
[1:30:56] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:58] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:31:00] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[1:31:01] with all spiritual blessings and
[1:31:03] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:31:06] he has chosen Us in him before the
[1:31:07] foundation of the world that we should
[1:31:09] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:31:11] love I mean my Mountaintop
[1:31:14] Hallelujah I mean you you go through
[1:31:17] there and you come into Ephesians 4 and
[1:31:19] and all this my we're joint HS with
[1:31:21] Jesus Christ we're heir to all that the
[1:31:23] father has us we're predestinated we
[1:31:26] can't miss it we're going in a body
[1:31:28] change we're going in a Rapture praise
[1:31:30] the Lord and then he comes to chapter
[1:31:31] six and says Now put on the whole armor
[1:31:34] of God wait a second hold
[1:31:37] on I thought I made it right I I thought
[1:31:41] I was predestinated under good works and
[1:31:43] I thought I was join HS and a man I'm on
[1:31:45] the mountain top I'm screaming I'm
[1:31:47] shouting I got all the promises of God
[1:31:49] praise God we made it my name was
[1:31:51] written on the Lamb's uh a book of life
[1:31:54] and and you cannot miss it now it's time
[1:31:57] to fight wait
[1:32:00] what I would wait a second here yes
[1:32:03] you're perfect have you considered job
[1:32:06] There's No One Like
[1:32:07] Him notice God's thoughts for job and
[1:32:10] then the trial
[1:32:15] came he's perfect There's No One Like
[1:32:18] Him have you considered and so all of
[1:32:20] this evil starts to befall
[1:32:22] job job don't know what's going on but
[1:32:27] God
[1:32:28] does oh we've received a message Malachi
[1:32:31] 45 has come the Lord himself shall
[1:32:34] descend with a
[1:32:36] shout we've come into into an invisible
[1:32:38] Union with Christ soon is the body
[1:32:41] changed but just like Ephesians right
[1:32:44] Joshua parallels Ephesians we've entered
[1:32:47] into our Promised Land we've come into
[1:32:49] our land Every Blessing oh you're seated
[1:32:53] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus now
[1:32:55] what do you got to
[1:32:57] do you got to
[1:33:00] fight well that's what the prophet
[1:33:02] taught you come in you come into the new
[1:33:03] land it wasn't the Millennium I think
[1:33:06] that's the problem are are some of y'all
[1:33:08] thinking this is the Millennium I'm
[1:33:12] disappointed now I know spiritually I'm
[1:33:15] raptured I know I'm in Union with him I
[1:33:19] know I can't miss it I I know my just
[1:33:22] how God deals W with the individual he
[1:33:24] deals with the church and he deals with
[1:33:25] the world this world's going to have to
[1:33:27] be burned over in fire my soul's already
[1:33:29] been burned over with fire I'm already
[1:33:31] raptured I'm already seated in Heavenly
[1:33:33] places in Christ Jesus but that seed
[1:33:35] word that's been deposited oh it's time
[1:33:38] to fight yes and if he ordains me to go
[1:33:41] through hard
[1:33:43] trials look at
[1:33:46] job all of the son know he's perfect
[1:33:49] he's
[1:33:51] upright oh but you've built a about
[1:33:54] him all
[1:33:58] right I'll let you come
[1:34:00] in I'll let you affect his
[1:34:04] job I'll let you affect his
[1:34:09] welfare if you're not
[1:34:13] careful you forget who you
[1:34:16] are you forget Ephesians 1 2 3 4 5 you
[1:34:22] forget what has been spoken of you and
[1:34:26] you're distracted just like the
[1:34:28] disciples in the ship I mean you know I
[1:34:33] I love the word because we like to think
[1:34:35] what we would have
[1:34:37] done we'd have just been on our
[1:34:40] recliner hey boys put up a hammock man
[1:34:44] these are some pretty big waves let's
[1:34:46] try to Surf this thing man not a care in
[1:34:50] the world because you would think what
[1:34:52] do I have to worry
[1:34:54] if Jesus is on the
[1:34:56] boat that should be the
[1:35:00] attitude but you see it's the storms
[1:35:02] it's the waves it's the afflictions it's
[1:35:05] the distractions we
[1:35:07] forget that Jesus is on the
[1:35:11] boat our sufferings and our hard trials
[1:35:15] we forget that God's allowed you to
[1:35:18] enter into that
[1:35:21] season I know it's hard
[1:35:27] but just as he was a Man of Sorrows
[1:35:29] acquainted with
[1:35:31] grief we too have to
[1:35:38] suffer oh
[1:35:40] but thank God our suffering has a
[1:35:45] reward not not not that our suffering
[1:35:49] purchases anything no he already
[1:35:52] purchased our reward
[1:35:54] but that we too might have a Christlike
[1:35:58] character our suffering has a
[1:36:03] benefit you look out on the world
[1:36:05] there's people
[1:36:07] suffering losing children to senseless
[1:36:11] acts broken homes and wicked
[1:36:15] situations and they go through all that
[1:36:17] heartache with no hope
[1:36:23] and if you've ever gone through any
[1:36:26] heartache like
[1:36:29] that you would want to have compassion
[1:36:31] on them and bring them some hope in
[1:36:33] their
[1:36:35] trial I say there ought to be a love in
[1:36:37] your
[1:36:39] heart to look out on those in great
[1:36:44] Affliction you know you know we were
[1:36:47] having a little bible study and brother
[1:36:48] Andrew we always pray at the end of
[1:36:51] it he's out on a job in in Arlington you
[1:36:54] know and he's you know they're going
[1:36:56] through a water problem out there let's
[1:36:58] pray for
[1:36:59] them you know you you you you you
[1:37:02] think why because there's a heart that
[1:37:05] say you know what these people have a
[1:37:07] need and how would you feel if you were
[1:37:09] going through that he was entering in
[1:37:12] we'll just continue for a few moments
[1:37:14] we'll get to something concerning that
[1:37:16] but notice God's thoughts concerning job
[1:37:19] and then the battle
[1:37:20] come seems like the battle's over man
[1:37:24] but then all of a sudden ay it's time to
[1:37:27] fight and we'll just speed up for the
[1:37:29] sake of
[1:37:31] time a as as this evil starts to befall
[1:37:35] job he gets you know his three friends
[1:37:38] come to him his three comforters come
[1:37:40] and and and they just sit there for
[1:37:41] seven days and don't say a
[1:37:44] word and then job finally after this
[1:37:46] many times he opens up his
[1:37:49] mouth and he starts to speak out
[1:37:54] he says curse the
[1:37:57] day that I was
[1:38:01] born here this perfect and upright
[1:38:05] man perfect and in his
[1:38:08] generation is going through the deepest
[1:38:11] darkest trial man could
[1:38:13] know he lost
[1:38:15] everything then Not only was all the
[1:38:17] substance taken from him what was taken
[1:38:19] from him his
[1:38:20] health and then his own comforter which
[1:38:24] they didn't sound like comforters to
[1:38:26] me you secret sinner like that's not
[1:38:31] helping I thought you were supposed to
[1:38:33] be my
[1:38:34] comforter and sometimes the devil will
[1:38:37] take your mind and you'll come to church
[1:38:40] where the word's here to comfort you and
[1:38:42] he'll make you think about the man he'll
[1:38:44] make you think about the veil he'll make
[1:38:46] you think about situations and all you
[1:38:48] will hear is you're just a secret sinner
[1:38:53] and all you see is judgment and you miss
[1:38:56] the
[1:38:58] grace that God is wanting to pour out in
[1:39:02] your life even his own wife turned him
[1:39:05] down his church turned him
[1:39:08] down and the prophet of God would say in
[1:39:11] that dark hour where he didn't know
[1:39:13] where he was going from
[1:39:16] there Jesus came
[1:39:19] along said I know my redeemer liveth and
[1:39:22] in the last days he'll stand upon the
[1:39:24] Earth though the skin worms destroy this
[1:39:26] body yet in my flesh I'll see
[1:39:29] God see all that trial all that
[1:39:34] testing was proving that there was a
[1:39:36] revelation inside of
[1:39:38] job God was proving
[1:39:41] job God was proving to the devil what he
[1:39:46] said about
[1:39:48] job thank you Lord did not God come and
[1:39:52] say you are his
[1:39:57] victory come on did he not say that you
[1:40:00] are the Invincible Army did he not say
[1:40:03] that you will do the Greater
[1:40:05] Works then all the testing and all the
[1:40:08] trial is just proving to that old devil
[1:40:11] what he said is
[1:40:13] true and God wants to use you to go
[1:40:17] through the hard times and go through
[1:40:18] those trials and those times of Agony
[1:40:21] and sorrow and mental pain and suffering
[1:40:25] because there's a revelation inside of
[1:40:27] you that's going to prove to the devil
[1:40:29] prove to you that you are what he said
[1:40:31] you
[1:40:37] are wow we just don't have the time to
[1:40:40] do it
[1:40:43] but you go in and you listen
[1:40:46] to on the wings of a snow white dove the
[1:40:49] prophet of God would start talking about
[1:40:51] how he suffered
[1:40:54] he would say you don't know what I've
[1:40:55] suffered just mental oppression every
[1:40:58] seven years that comes all my
[1:41:00] life that's where I'm at now 7 eight he
[1:41:03] says I I was so distressed I cried I
[1:41:06] begged I pleaded and I remember when my
[1:41:08] finally thought I I had enough money to
[1:41:10] go to Mayo for examination to find out
[1:41:13] what the trouble was they said they'll
[1:41:14] find out what the trouble is wife and I
[1:41:16] Becky Sarah was a little bitty fell I
[1:41:18] just entered into my Healing Ministry
[1:41:20] and we took off for males well huh you
[1:41:23] just entering into your Healing Ministry
[1:41:26] and you're going to the medical
[1:41:30] clinic it doesn't sound like it's adding
[1:41:32] up and sometimes you feel like things
[1:41:35] aren't adding up in your life but God
[1:41:37] knows all about
[1:41:39] it God knows your heartache he knows the
[1:41:42] trial he knows the situation he
[1:41:44] understood right where his Prophet was
[1:41:46] though he was battling mental oppression
[1:41:49] and being all nervous and tore up and he
[1:41:51] was wanting to go to a clinic and yet
[1:41:53] and all that God was using him to bring
[1:41:55] a healing Revival to the
[1:41:58] world but you see when you've been in
[1:42:00] Dark Places we'll come to a close
[1:42:03] quickly when you've been in Dark Places
[1:42:06] when you know what it's like to be
[1:42:08] alone when you when you when you feel
[1:42:10] like no one knows your
[1:42:13] pain I believe somebody here this
[1:42:16] morning is going through a really dark
[1:42:21] trial and you're going through a really
[1:42:24] hard
[1:42:25] time oh if I had time to express my
[1:42:28] heart I I I I've I I've been in a
[1:42:31] valley I've been in a hard
[1:42:34] time where you feel so helpless and you
[1:42:37] feel your mind's done forsaking you you
[1:42:40] feel like God's nowhere to be found and
[1:42:42] you're in agony and you're rolling
[1:42:44] around on the ground and you can't make
[1:42:46] sense of
[1:42:49] anything and you're at your lowest e in
[1:42:52] your darkest
[1:42:55] power I say what it'll do it'll create
[1:42:58] something in
[1:43:01] you where you can say oh God if my
[1:43:04] brother or sister's feeling anything
[1:43:06] like
[1:43:08] that is there something I can do to help
[1:43:11] them
[1:43:14] Lord Lord I want to look out
[1:43:18] there and have
[1:43:21] compassion I want to look on the
[1:43:24] heart I don't want to judge a man for
[1:43:27] his deeds and his faults and his
[1:43:28] failures but I want to have compassion
[1:43:30] on him with where he's
[1:43:32] at we we uh you know it's like we allow
[1:43:35] all the cares of life and all the
[1:43:37] mistakes and failures and and past
[1:43:39] circumstances and things that have done
[1:43:41] and conduct from from one another and I
[1:43:43] it just builds up a big thick crust on
[1:43:45] top of the water and and it just we just
[1:43:48] allow it to become stagnant but and we
[1:43:51] never get down beyond all of it down to
[1:43:53] where somebody's living down to the
[1:43:54] heart of the matter and find out you
[1:43:56] know what are you going
[1:43:57] through maybe some things were done
[1:43:59] maybe some things were said may you know
[1:44:01] may maybe I know that's not really who
[1:44:04] you are or what are you going through I
[1:44:06] want to be able to help you when you've
[1:44:08] gotten down in those places then it
[1:44:10] really creates a compassion where you
[1:44:12] can help somebody
[1:44:13] else as Paul would say in Ephesians 4:32
[1:44:17] be kind-hearted one to another forgiving
[1:44:19] one another even as Christ's sake has
[1:44:22] forgiven you
[1:44:24] now think of this as we're just moving
[1:44:27] quickly the prophet of God said I want
[1:44:30] to tell you a secret of praying for the
[1:44:33] sick I'm not a Healer God knows that but
[1:44:37] God answers prayer for me many times and
[1:44:40] the only way it can be
[1:44:43] done I'm just by God's help
[1:44:48] taking a fruit of your hard
[1:44:51] time your trial that you go through the
[1:44:54] character that it's molding in
[1:44:57] you the only way it can be done you've
[1:45:00] got to enter into the fellowship of
[1:45:03] their
[1:45:04] suffering you've got to really feel it
[1:45:08] we know the story about the young mother
[1:45:09] who saw that I mean I believe she she
[1:45:11] was she had been a mother or was uh her
[1:45:13] kids were grown but she looked down at a
[1:45:15] young mother and and she her baby was
[1:45:17] just fussing and something inside of her
[1:45:19] she's like I got to pray for that
[1:45:21] baby she had compassion
[1:45:23] she know what it was like she said oh
[1:45:25] her baby's suffering that poor mom she's
[1:45:27] nervous going back and forth something
[1:45:28] compelled
[1:45:30] her she could enter into that
[1:45:35] suffering brother brandom said you have
[1:45:38] to feel the person's condition or you'll
[1:45:41] never help him you got to enter into
[1:45:44] their suffering if you don't just
[1:45:46] cold-heartedly it'll never
[1:45:48] work so you got to be able to place
[1:45:51] yourself into their suffering Look what
[1:45:52] Jesus was a man of sorrow he was
[1:45:55] acquainted with grief and Agony he knows
[1:45:57] how to place himself right into where
[1:45:59] you're
[1:46:01] living He says in the queen of the South
[1:46:04] you can never help anybody unless you
[1:46:06] get right into it with them you got to
[1:46:08] enter into their suffering if you don't
[1:46:10] do it you just you're just out you got
[1:46:13] to have a love in something that makes
[1:46:15] you just right with
[1:46:18] them that's why the prophet could stand
[1:46:20] there because I I I tying this together
[1:46:23] because the prophet knew what hardship
[1:46:25] was the prophet knew what Agony was the
[1:46:28] prophet knew what it meant to be poor
[1:46:30] the prophet had suffered he had gone
[1:46:32] through things right when his own
[1:46:33] Healing Ministry starting out he's
[1:46:35] trying to go to a
[1:46:37] doctor for something he's begging and
[1:46:40] pleading God to be delivered from but
[1:46:43] you know I believe one thing that the
[1:46:45] prophet was able to do we was able to
[1:46:48] look at somebody else that was suffering
[1:46:50] and going through a trial and he could
[1:46:52] relate to to
[1:46:57] them he could enter in to their
[1:47:00] suffering that's why he could stand
[1:47:02] there as he he saw that he was down in
[1:47:04] Mexico and there's an older man he said
[1:47:06] he maybe a brick l or something like
[1:47:08] that he looked at him and he said you
[1:47:09] know he'd be about my Daddy's
[1:47:12] age what was he doing he was starting to
[1:47:15] enter in to a place of identification he
[1:47:19] he got to putting his foot next to his I
[1:47:21] wonder if my clothes would F him what
[1:47:23] was he doing he was entering into the
[1:47:25] fellowship of his
[1:47:27] suffering and I say one ability I would
[1:47:31] say the prophet had to be able to do
[1:47:33] that was because he too
[1:47:36] suffered he too was poor he
[1:47:40] too knew what sorrow was he too was AC
[1:47:43] acquainted with
[1:47:45] grief he knew what a dark hour was to
[1:47:48] stand there pleading for his six-month
[1:47:50] old baby
[1:47:53] already his wife
[1:47:55] gone now he's pleading for his little
[1:47:58] Sharon Rose Lord don't take her please
[1:48:00] don't take
[1:48:02] her and then that black curtain come
[1:48:04] down and he knew God would not hear his
[1:48:10] prayer and then the devil really started
[1:48:12] to pour it on him to tell him see he
[1:48:15] don't love you now we're talking about a
[1:48:18] dark Valley
[1:48:23] and maybe that's where you're at right
[1:48:25] now you're going through a dark
[1:48:27] Valley but it's just a testing
[1:48:31] time it's a proving time that God has
[1:48:34] deposited a faith seat on inside of you
[1:48:36] that will pass the test and if you feel
[1:48:39] like you're falling don't worry Jesus is
[1:48:41] in the boat we'll just invite the
[1:48:43] musicians to
[1:48:51] come but I say we we
[1:48:55] all were suffering under the penalty of
[1:48:58] sin and
[1:48:59] death and Christ entered into our
[1:49:02] suffering that we could be
[1:49:05] free free from the law of sin and
[1:49:09] death as Philippians 2:8 would say and
[1:49:12] being found in the fashion as a man he
[1:49:13] humbled himself and became obedient un
[1:49:15] death even the death of the
[1:49:17] cross say he's our kinsman
[1:49:20] redeemer he's our high priest who can be
[1:49:22] touched by the feeling of our
[1:49:25] infirmities you might feel like you're
[1:49:27] in hell and there's no way
[1:49:30] out you might feel like you're in the
[1:49:33] deepest trial and there's no way you're
[1:49:34] going to get out but I know somebody
[1:49:36] who's went there for
[1:49:38] you that he could bring you out for
[1:49:40] David would say in Psalms 8613 he said
[1:49:42] for great is the mercy toward me and
[1:49:46] thou Hast delivered my soul from the
[1:49:47] lowest hell as the poet would write the
[1:49:50] love of God is greater far that Tong or
[1:49:53] pin could ever tell it goes beyond the
[1:49:56] highest star and reaches to the lowest
[1:50:00] hell maybe we could sing
[1:50:05] that oh he it would say someone in their
[1:50:09] Darkest Hour pinned these words on the
[1:50:11] walls of an insane asylum could we with
[1:50:14] ink the ocean
[1:50:16] F and were the skies a parchment made
[1:50:19] where every stock on earth a quill and
[1:50:21] every man a scribe by trade to write the
[1:50:23] love of God above would drain the oceans
[1:50:26] dry nor could the scroll contain the
[1:50:28] hole though stretched from Sky to Sky oh
[1:50:33] they found that written on the walls of
[1:50:35] an insane
[1:50:36] asylum I like to think of it this
[1:50:40] way somebody was
[1:50:43] there in their darkest
[1:50:46] hour and their hardest trial and Jesus
[1:50:50] came along
[1:50:52] they found out that no it seemed like
[1:50:54] they had no hope here they're
[1:50:57] trapped between these walls in an insane
[1:51:00] asylum and yet they found out after all
[1:51:03] that Jesus was on the boat oh it was
[1:51:07] Jesus keeping them all the time and they
[1:51:10] would pin those words on the
[1:51:16] wall he was wounded for our
[1:51:18] transgressions surely he has borne our
[1:51:21] griefs
[1:51:23] and carried our sorrows oh you might
[1:51:27] feel oh this might be like a
[1:51:32] paradox but you're feeling the weight of
[1:51:34] the
[1:51:35] trial the hardship you're at Your
[1:51:38] Darkest Hour but
[1:51:42] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:51:44] carried our sorrows for he was wounded
[1:51:46] for our transgressions he was bruised
[1:51:48] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[1:51:50] our peace was upon him and with his
[1:51:51] stripes we are
[1:51:55] healed all we like sheep have gone
[1:51:57] astray we have turned everyone his own
[1:51:59] way and the Lord hath laid on
[1:52:02] him the
[1:52:04] iniquity of us all what a
[1:52:07] redeemer What A
[1:52:10] Savior oh that he would take our
[1:52:14] place I say then if we got to go through
[1:52:17] a little suffering on this side
[1:52:19] church we go through some heartache we
[1:52:22] lose some some loved
[1:52:23] ones we go through some great trials
[1:52:26] it's just working for your good it's
[1:52:29] just perfecting the character it's just
[1:52:31] bringing the seed to
[1:52:34] maturity that you too can have a
[1:52:36] Christlike
[1:52:40] character oh just say Amen to the word I
[1:52:42] know we don't want
[1:52:44] it I know we want a Mountaintop
[1:52:47] experience I know we want to just scream
[1:52:49] and shout the victory but you got to
[1:52:50] come down into the valley
[1:52:54] and I say if if that's the way God has
[1:52:57] to bring us to bring forth the character
[1:52:59] I say Lord be it unto me according to
[1:53:01] Thy
[1:53:03] word I know you're crying out for a
[1:53:05] healing and you're already healed
[1:53:08] because God said he's a Healer and God
[1:53:11] said by his stripes you're already
[1:53:13] healed you just stay with the
[1:53:16] word if he said it I believe it so then
[1:53:20] your season of your Valley might seem
[1:53:23] like it's long but God's working a
[1:53:25] Perfection within
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:34] you Paul said in Philippians 3:10 that I
[1:53:36] might know him and the power of his
[1:53:39] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:53:42] suffering being made conformable unto
[1:53:45] his
[1:53:47] death there's Fellowship in that
[1:53:50] suffering
[1:53:52] let's all
[1:54:03] stand Prophet would say in the sermon
[1:54:06] job he says you say I'm not
[1:54:08] worthy to walk out of this wheelchair
[1:54:11] tonight that's right you're
[1:54:13] not but God don't examine
[1:54:15] you he examined
[1:54:18] Christ and if he's worthy
[1:54:22] then you can
[1:54:25] walk see that's
[1:54:27] right now for a moment I just want you
[1:54:30] to take your eyes off the
[1:54:33] trial
[1:54:35] because many times we feel like we're
[1:54:37] the
[1:54:39] reason or we're the ones
[1:54:42] responsible no it's because you're a
[1:54:44] Believer and your faith is being
[1:54:47] [Music]
[1:54:49] tested it's not your righteousness it's
[1:54:51] his righteousness
[1:54:54] that's right you're not but God don't
[1:54:56] examine you he examines Christ and if
[1:54:57] he's worthy then you can walk that's
[1:54:59] right depends on what you think about
[1:55:01] you say brother random I'm an awful
[1:55:03] woman I've lived illegally I've even
[1:55:05] broke my marriage vows I've done this
[1:55:07] and Mr brandom I tell you I've been a
[1:55:08] drunker I've done this no matter what
[1:55:10] you've done God never looks at you he
[1:55:12] looks at the lamb and he's already
[1:55:15] accepted the lamb so you're
[1:55:18] free God can't see you he sees the lamb
[1:55:21] dies in your stad that's enough to make
[1:55:23] a fellow fellow shout isn't it sure is
[1:55:26] when you think of that it's those basis
[1:55:28] upon the word I want to say he's
[1:55:32] worthy then you can walk that's right
[1:55:35] he's worthy then you can be free he's
[1:55:38] worthy then you can have joy he's worthy
[1:55:42] he'll bring you through your trial he's
[1:55:44] worthy that no matter how hard it gets
[1:55:46] you can say praise the Lord yes he's
[1:55:49] worthy so you can walk he's worthy yes
[1:55:52] and I say if I got to go through a hard
[1:55:55] trial I say he's
[1:55:57] worthy if I got to suffer that I might
[1:56:00] have character that would please him I
[1:56:03] say he's
[1:56:05] worthy and my my hard time and my trial
[1:56:09] and my pain isn't because of my
[1:56:11] unrighteousness God's not looking at
[1:56:13] that he's looking at the
[1:56:16] lamb so that I say be free from
[1:56:20] condemnation be free from
[1:56:22] guilt don't let sat Satan pile up on
[1:56:25] those things in your life as you've been
[1:56:27] going through the season in your life
[1:56:29] Satan's just been dropping in all these
[1:56:33] lies you should have done this and you
[1:56:35] should have done that well if if that's
[1:56:38] the truth then you know what you do Lord
[1:56:40] forgive me I'm sorry I Repent I turn
[1:56:43] away from those things that's how easy
[1:56:45] that is to make that right you don't
[1:56:48] have to live in that
[1:56:49] condemnation then you can just say Lord
[1:56:52] I've pleaded the blood the sacrifice
[1:56:55] you're worthy Lord I'm going to walk on
[1:56:57] free and I know just as David said
[1:56:59] though I walk to the Valley of the
[1:57:00] shadow of
[1:57:02] death thou art with
[1:57:05] me the love of
[1:57:09] God is greater
[1:57:12] far than tongue or
[1:57:16] P the love
[1:57:25] and reaches
[1:57:34] to oh Bow Down
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:50] with oh
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:58:03] he oh love of
[1:58:06] God how rich and
[1:58:10] pure how
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:18] measur it shall for
[1:58:22] ever more
[1:58:26] Ure the saint in
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:34] name when
[1:58:37] time shall pass
[1:58:41] away and
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:45] Earth and Kings
[1:58:49] fall with men who
[1:58:54] ref
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:07] to oh shall
[1:59:12] still all
[1:59:15] meure oh and strong oh redeem
[1:59:23] gra to
[1:59:28] Adams the Saints
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:39] in how rich and
[1:59:43] pure how
[1:59:47] Mis and
[1:59:50] strong is shall
[1:59:54] forever more
[1:59:58] in the
[2:00:04] Saint just for a moment I want to read
[2:00:06] this here as they softly
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:12] play why does he stand
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:18] by oh maybe the agony the grief the the
[2:00:22] pain the oppression so great nervous
[2:00:26] breakdowns you don't know where to turn
[2:00:28] what to do why does he stand by the
[2:00:33] reason is this Romans 8:17 if children
[2:00:35] then heirs and Heirs of God and join HS
[2:00:37] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[2:00:40] him that we may be also glorified
[2:00:45] together for I reckon that the suffering
[2:00:47] of this present time are not worthy to
[2:00:50] be compared with the Glory which shall
[2:00:52] be revealed in US unless we suffer with
[2:00:56] him we cannot reign with him you have to
[2:00:59] suffer to rain the reason for that is
[2:01:02] the character simply is never made
[2:01:05] without suffering character is a
[2:01:09] victory not a
[2:01:12] gift when you go through the
[2:01:15] storm knowing these things doesn't take
[2:01:17] away the
[2:01:19] pain you still going to feel
[2:01:22] some Agony and
[2:01:25] Sorrows but the prophet of God said he
[2:01:27] lets trouble come and just harnesses the
[2:01:29] troubles puts bits in its mouth and
[2:01:33] makes it obey him that the trouble would
[2:01:36] bring you into a closer
[2:01:38] fellowship with
[2:01:40] God could we
[2:01:44] with
[2:01:45] the
[2:01:48] F and world

[2:16:02] the passing of his mother and also I
[2:16:05] just I like to welcome back my sister
[2:16:07] Sharon who was there for the family
[2:16:10] during that time it's good to have her
[2:16:12] back and the Lord used her in a special
[2:16:15] way just the testimonies and things
[2:16:18] coming forth and the answered prayers of
[2:16:21] God caring for our grandma just a
[2:16:23] wonderful blessing to know that on this
[2:16:26] side we'll have trials we'll have some
[2:16:31] heartaches we'll
[2:16:34] suffer but it's just for a
[2:16:38] moment and one of these days all those
[2:16:40] that we love and hold dear
[2:16:42] and the things that
[2:16:44] we've feel that have been stripped away
[2:16:47] from us there's going to be a reunion
[2:16:49] one of these days
[2:16:53] you know I just didn't have time to get
[2:16:54] to that but the scripture
[2:16:58] says you know that all of our sorrow
[2:17:00] will be turned into
[2:17:03] Joy you know in a moment one of these
[2:17:06] times we're going to be change whether
[2:17:07] we go by the way of the Grave or whether
[2:17:09] not
[2:17:10] but Revelations 21:4 is and God shall
[2:17:13] wipe away all our tears from our eyes
[2:17:16] there shall be no more death neither
[2:17:19] sorrow nor
[2:17:21] crying neither shall there be any more
[2:17:24] pain for the forer things will be passed
[2:17:28] away oh
[2:17:30] friends it can be
[2:17:33] hard but I say because of what Christ
[2:17:35] has done for us it's worth it God bless
