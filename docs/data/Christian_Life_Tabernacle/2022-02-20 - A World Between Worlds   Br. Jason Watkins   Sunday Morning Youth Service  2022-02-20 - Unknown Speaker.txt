========================================

[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] good morning beautiful morning i hope you all didn't stay up too late and that you are gonna have a smile on your face for the whole service and amen every chapter every verse every line and receive abundant revelation amen that's all that i'm asking of you that's not too much amen we uh i we wanted to make just a few uh statements uh before we start our service we did want to thank brother matthew and brother billy and brother andrew and david and julie and all the host families and all all this chaperones and drivers and and all those that help support this meeting and this time of fellowship we we just really want to thank you so much for uh because you know without you um you just it couldn't be done that's all there is to it you know so all of you supported this the finances that you helped with the youth coming and everything is wonderful again i don't really consider them like youth i guess everybody the way they talk about me i'm entering into my second childhood so i don't i kind of smile all the time but you know i i like to say this that god uses youth yes and and and you're a part of this family and a part of this army i i know sometimes we treat you like a a another element you know like you're something that has to be dealt with uh special you know because but you're not you're you're a living vibrant part of the bride of christ and and if you look through the scriptures i mean and you look at these great warriors that i'll mention like abel abel was a youth you know he was probably 13 14 years old and he he had revelation from god to choose the acceptable sacrifice you look at joseph just a young fellow when he had dreams and visions and was thrown in the well samuel was just a boy when the lord spoke to him and he went to the temple daniel when when they were brought into captivity the historians feel that they were around 12 years old and and shadrach meshach and abednego all young people all your age and look at what's been written of them through the scriptures and you know it's not some old preacher that they're talking about they're talking about uh what we would call youth but there were people that just were their age was didn't hinder god one bit you know you take naaman's maid just the wisdom that she had and the service she had and and how many times has she referred to in this scripture you know the lad that had the fishes and the lows you know one of the greatest bible stories was because some uh a youth or a member of our body that hadn't was young uh was led of the lord to be where he was at you even take mary the mother of jesus just a child 14 years old and and so you you understand that that i the challenge that's there for you is to be led of the spirit of the lord and that god can lead you so you know each one of you is writing a new chapter in the book of acts the acts of the holy spirit through you and and that's we're here to encourage you we we have these meetings so you can come from different places meet new friends meet one another have fellowship if it's the lord's will a companion or a relationship might join a friendship might join uh support from peer support one with another so all those things are there but we all sit under the same word there's not a young people's gospel you know what i mean it's the same gospel there's not a young people's god there's not a young people's holy spirit it it does the same thing on all of us and we we all come to the lord at different times in different ages and we start our journey but god's good and so i think more than anything i would love you to always know that you're needed that's right your your fire and your life and your dedication is an inspiration the young young ladies that go to school or go to your jobs or whatever you do and you should let the light of the gospel shine and your young men that don't get caught up in the folly of the world it's a great testimony and your reward is going to be marvelous and i know it's hard to live down here but this isn't a staying gospel this is a leaving gospel it's all about one day one morning in a twinkling of eyes we're going to be changed and when you're dancing over there everybody that's left here is going to wish they were you so i i just i i want to uh commend you and tell you how much respect i have for you how fortunate i am that you the lord has led you in the path of truth and righteousness and i believe god's got abundant blessings for you so don't ever let anybody as we read in timothy and i think it's just such a a great scripture he said in timothy 4 and 12 and i'd just like to read it again let no man despise thy youth but be doubt an example yes and i've seen many young people come back from a fellowship meeting with on fire for god and inspire their parents to turn their lives around so don't ever let any complex on you that would think that you don't have an effect because you're 12 or 13 or 15 or whatever age you are let no man despise thy youth but beat out an example of the believer in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and in purity i believe you can do that i believe you're called to do it and i just want to let you know you're a true inspiration to us we thank you so much the visitors and our young people that have come together i hope you've had a wonderful time and once again thank you for making this possible and god richly bless you may you prosper and be in good health may the grace of god be abundant to you may you increase in revelation and understanding and most of all may the love of god be shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit god bless you all thank you [Music] amen here we are again gathering his presence amen i trust you

place of refuge where we can just feel the presence of a loving merciful god here and lord we're here for one purpose that the young people and young and old that we could just all be blessed by your

there are some that are seeking revelation straight from heaven this morning your prophet said that's what we should pray for more than anything else was revelation grant it and open the eyes of the people that are here we ask we ask that your blessings would also be on the minister as he would bring forth the word we thank you lord for your love we thank you for your blessings we give the remainder of this service to you and may you just have your way in it lord in touch lies we ask may people be edified all in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen man god bless you may be seated

on amen i just want to say this don't feel isolated you say well they're surrounded but even in a crowd like this you can feel isolated and i felt that last night when our brother was preaching at the end he said you tell the enemy you know you're a liar and something just kept saying there's some that feel isolated even in this and i want you to know you look at that enemy and tell satan i am not isolated i am surrounded amen by soldiers of the cross and then you just keep pressing on you have been redeemed amen you have been redeemed aren't you glad that he took the book amen so we have something to sing about on this song you probably know it just worship with me [Music] seems like all i could see was the struggle i was haunted by ghosts that lived in my past bound up in shackles of all my failures [Music] i was wondering how long is this gonna last [Music] then you look at this prisoner and said to me son stop fighting a fight that's already been won singing now i am redeemed

voice that's why we've gathered together oh my what a wonderful time i'm so thankful to be in his presence amen well we just want to take an opportunity to just make a few announcements um also there's somebody's lost a wedding band or a wedding ring so if that would be yours you might want to claim that just talk to one of the deacons and also we do want to invite you to the worship service tonight at 5 pm if we weren't able to get to your song specials we we apologize but if you want to sing or would come back at five we'll be happy to enjoy your song special so just turn that into one of the deacons or myself or brother billy and we'll be happy to to call you this evening sister alicia arredondo says god bless you brothers and sisters just wanted to thank the lord because me and my children are back thank you for all your prayers amen and brother arthur writes i wanted to thank the lord jesus christ for blessing me and my wife with 25 years of marriage it is not easy but because we started with god he has kept us and blessed us abundantly amen now you can interpret that any way you want to but you know life on this side isn't easy we go through a lot of heartaches a lot of trials and the devil would want to destroy a marriage pitch you against each other but it's the grace of god amen the something keeps holding me something's keeping you amen we're so thankful for his grace and we just wish uh brother daniel lorenze a happy birthday amen and we just want to take an opportunity to remember brother joseph frank as he has a sincere request because he has some very important and complicated situations that he is facing this week he needs god to undertake on his behalf [Music] i know god's just and faithful and his word says that a prayer of a righteous man availeth much we don't want the formality of a church service just to read something that's been written down and us just let it pass us by like we don't have any responsibility but each one of you have a responsibility to this request that was just written you might have traveled from several miles but god might lay that burden on your heart and you might take it back to louisiana or to arkansas and when you're on your knees before the lord maybe that burden will strike you see lord i remember that request from my brother joseph god would you move on his behalf maybe there's somebody that wants to lift up a hand right now and say lord i also have an urgent need i have an urgent request well just brother aaron oglesby to come and ask a blessing over the tithes and offerings and over these prayer requests why don't we just stand together with him lift those hands up if you have that need remember brother jason as he comes forth with the anointed word and why don't you start asking god to start speaking to your heart and you know by the preaching of the word god brings deliverance and the very need with these uplifted hands by the preaching of the word god can meet you and meet that need do you believe it let's just join together with him [Music] aren't you glad we have a god that not only hears but answers that knew of these needs before the foundation of the world and provided i'd also like to mention a need of a friend of ours brother donny's daughter sister erica parker who has been battling with cancer and tomorrow they're going to start her on a new series

folk and all of you here y'all are now all my ken folk praise the lord we're part of the family of god i think we proved that last night and man i was happy to find myself identified in the family book hallelujah well we're going to turn to the one of the best books in the bible we're going to turn to genesis chapter 28 and preach in the name of the lord and happy to be here and while you're finding your place in genesis 28 trusting that last night you know i i'm trusting last night will be a hallmark for you forever amen that you'll never again we concluded last night with putting the devil in the place that he belongs and deserves that he's a liar amen he doesn't run anything in god's kingdom he has no say in your life and you just need to believe that and i i'm i love telling him that i you know i i let him know all the time he ain't nobody i said you ain't nobody satan you don't make my you don't make decisions on my behalf my my whole life is guided by my father and you're not you can't even move against me without his permission i don't live by the mercies of lucifer i live by the mercies of jesus christ and so you know i remind him all the time you know it doesn't even matter what perceived victory he thinks he gets over me doesn't count doesn't matter amen so you know as we showed last night that the blood is what keeps us because it's perpetually continually atoning for us continually speaking she is me she is me she is me i'm innocent she's innocent i'm innocent she's innocent i was perfect she's perfect and uh and that's the conclusion of the word that we were in christ perfect in him before the world began i want to uh speak to you today and kind of continue on that thought and and i just wanted to kind of shore up you know that that that last night is a place where you were able to you know as brother branham would describe it drive your steak down my mommy used to use that on me when i was a boy growing up just drive your steak down have faith in god and you and if he comes to battle you which he will bring him back and show him that territory see because you're staking your claim in in the in the word the word is your promised land and so that's what you do when you go you know you go to open land and the government says stake a claim and if you can maintain it it's yours and so the word is my land and i went there and staked the claim what's your claim i'm the son of god how much of this land is yours all of it all of it amen and so i have given you the land he is his promise so stake your claim and get ready to fight amen get ready to fight that's uh you know the uh the special forces you know that's their that's the last thing that men you know when they're when they're inserted covertly behind enemy lines and you know the enemies approaching that's the last word they hear from their commanding officer is get ready to fight and that's when they know game on amen and this is for real and this is for keeps and uh so you know i how many how many spent some time on your facebook on god's facebook today amen remember god has a facebook yes you know so i wasn't i hope you all understand last night i wasn't here to preach against all those things in youtube and facebook i i had a facebook account i actually suspended it some time ago just because it was taking up too much of my time so if anybody's been trying to reach me by facebook and i haven't been replying i'm not i'm sorry this am i there anymore i'm not saying i won't go back but i i never i never used social media for me personally i i made a decision i wouldn't use it for um for social interaction i used my wall for posting quotes and things of brother branham and great thoughts and essays and things and so but uh it just became a little overwhelming and uh you know i've i've i've had my you know family members and snapchat and and and actually somebody said you have snapchat i said i think i do my grandkids i think put me on it and and then i said why did you guys aren't answering my text papaw you just need snapchat what's snapchat or we'll get it immediately and so i said okay create me a grandkids link and uh and so if you've tried if you saw me and you tried to friend me and i haven't replied it's because it's only for my grandkids and i probably wouldn't even know how anyway and so uh i have to get them to do it but anyway so i just wanted to clear the air on that say yeah yeah i think brother jason used to have a facebook you know well yeah that's true amen but but i have a facebook amen i behold him face to face and i'm gazing into him and i'm changed from glory to glory amen into his image amen so that's god has facebook too um i really enjoyed myself last night and let's get straight into the word i i appreciate all of you who have come from near and far it's so uh heartwarming to see brother david took me through the back and to see all the rooms full and and even the the minister study over here uh i was full and they're in the hallways and they're all over the place and and uh so that's just wonderful you know what it does it always reminds me especially uh what's today sunday so saturday when i went and saw all the all the young people at the park anytime i get around something like that i start thinking about the millennium what a day what a time that that's going to be you know there's just something precious about gathering with the family of god they become far closer you know a lot a lot of us and i'm me included have blood family who are not uh have have elected not to be in the family of god they don't want to be a part of it and i and you actually find that you become closer to god's family sometimes than your own blood family who are not in the kingdom of christ and and the the affinity you have and the camaraderie and the spree decor and the fellowship that you have is is is much richer and deeper uh but we're holding out for our family amen so praise the lord uh genesis chapter 28 we're going to begin at verse 10. and we'll read through verse 22 and let you be seated and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder was set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt prepare thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places wither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of and jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and he said how dreadful is this place there is none this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone he had uh he had had for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethel and the name of that city was called lose at the first and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be shall be god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee let's pray father now lord i just relax myself i have notes before me and and many hours of study and preparation and prayer i have multiple confirmations of supernaturally lord this morning that we won't even take time to testify of the lord i know and am convinced that i have your perfect will and your word for this audience today and father i'm just they sang a song they invited me out and i just followed you up here and and i'm just your servant that's it i'm just your assistant i'm just here to assist you lord that's all i am that's all i ever want to be so we give it into your hands completely now in jesus lovely name amen god bless you as you're seated so last night we were and i have a number of scriptures and quotes that i'm going to refer to and i was asked if i would like to display them and i i think not because sometimes if i'm in a certain gear and planning a certain pace i'll do that but for my for my feeling today i don't want to get kind of slowed down with displays i just want to go quickly and i might not even read whole but it'll be familiar to you anyway and i'll give you the reference for it and for people who are taking notes and what more and on the archive so last night we were talking about uh the expression of god and how that god and i want to just start right there uh to to really emphasize that the entire happenings of god's family down through history have all been pre-planned by god and that's direct tape teaching brother branham says i guess you know your life was pre-planned that's the exact word he uses it was pre-planned of god and uh set in motion and the the beauty of it is that you're going to see that jacob's life god already had a plan when jacob arrived and and nothing that jacob ever would do would change that plan and and god would say go here and you read in the text that jacob would actually go in another place and you know it's like god is saying i want you to turn right and jacob would turn left and so you know what god's reaction would be okay i'll turn left i'm just going to follow you i told you i'd stay with you i'm going to bring you back this way and you rather have went that way but i'm gonna follow you okay i told you to go to this city you went to another and i'm still i'm gonna go with you because because this is this is not about jacob being a good man in fact is he wasn't a very good man he never was a very good man until he had a name change and and and and that and that required him uh going to battle uh and and defeating himself see and so so i i don't want to get ahead of myself but but you're you're going to find that god has this purpose and we read to you last night and apparently according to the pastor you've been studying that very sermon and studying that principle how that god had one goal in all the bible and it's all about expression and brother branham says this morning we're going to see what it was and when you listen to that sermon you realize the whole plan of god is expression and god intended to express and so so because of that then everything is purposed by god everything is set in motion by god according to his purpose and plan and you you you'll see that that you know you can see progression through the word i i'm going to look at a number of examples today you know you you find where how that sometimes if you go particularly you know in um in in the book of genesis and you start catching you know genealogies and you'll see this you go and see it for yourself and you'll you'll say well you know here come a man and of the son of and here was a and he married this woman and then they had a son and and then that son and then they had another son and then that son married this one and had this son and it just breaks a family tree and and and sometimes most times you'll find it was go and he and he had a son and his name was and then he took a a wife of and had a son in his name and you'll see it go click click click click and it was kind of just peter out and that's it there's no more no more tracing of it and it'll die off and but then you'll find every once in a while you'll find it say and and he had a son and named his name and then he took a wife and had a son and you watch that and he'll just keep tracking it tracking it tracking it tracking it tracking and tracking all the way up to the time of christ and what you're seeing is you're seeing the seed of god the seed of christ traveling through the bible and this is this is how god is expressing what he's doing see and so the christ seed moving through the word and you know you find examples in the bible and i'm just giving you some that came to me off the top of my head i've studied them for years but you come to a time uh in the days of uh you know of the exodus and another here comes the children of israel and and we're way past the time of abraham and you know you've got moses leading them out and joshua taking them in and all of these all of this activity of the exodus taking place in the settling of the promised land and god comes along during that era and he says now concerning the concerning the days of abraham by my name jehovah was i not known i'm like what huh wait what i thought jehovah jireh father behold the fire behold the wood but where's the lamb for burnt offering my son the lord shall jehovah jireh he shall provide himself a sacrifice and and there's and so you realize that there's it's not a contradiction in the scripture god's not lying you understand but god is simply saying that you know if you take in the name you know elohim abraham worshiped him as elohim that self-existing spirit and when he came in the form of melchizedek then he called him lord and brother branham would always point out capital l-o-r-d and so abraham knew exactly who he was talking to it was none other than the creator of all things and and and that's why brother branham then would say now we don't hear no more of melchizedek because he became jesus christ and it was the same person see and so all you're seeing is god unfolding in a certain way and now he's taking a name that reflects what he's doing what he's up to so so now jehovah is not just the self-existing god it's now god dwelling with his family and that's where brother branham breaks it down to say that you know when he when he called them out of egypt they were god's people but when he took them through the wilderness now they now brother branham says now they became the chil the children of god of the the church of god of the wilderness see and so it's it's just god designated he's giving clues i'm on the move it's still me it's still me my you're still my family you're separated by hundreds of years they're my family you're my family i'm still your creator and i'm i'm unfolding myself see and so so you you you find that this is exactly why as i've said i don't know if i've said it here i say it around the world it it helps people to visualize you know this this is why brother branham would come and he would sit in the stand in the middle of trinitarians who had good friends noble men oneness men noble men good friends of brother branham supported his meeting said you fed my children and he would stand between them and say now frankly you're both wrong and it's and the answer's not the middle because if you he's not three and he's not one exactly like your finger would be one but he's also not two see and the reason that they would get so scrupled up is because they think of god linearly like that but he's not linear he's eternal and it's just forms of his expression and so the trinitarians were incorrect in understanding his godhead because in their formula they chopped him into three individual persons the oneness were wrong because in their formula they saw jesus only they didn't see his bride they didn't see his body which is a part of his godhead now that's direct tape teaching that's direct tape teaching brother branham says it just like that we're in god's godhead see his born-again churches is part of his godhead because it's part of his expression oh my and and you find then that that's what the seventh seal unsealed it unsealed the mighty god and unsealed mrs jesus christ that she's a continuation so when you come to you know the brag is gone in revelation 12 she's went up she goes up satan comes down the bible now of course he had already been cast down from his position to have a case against her that that was dealt with in zechariah 3 and satan sued god tried to take over the kingdom and brought brought a lawsuit against god in his own courtroom can you imagine the audacity of the devil to do something like that and he hauls joshua the high priest because the high priest represents the whole family who represents all of israel all of israel didn't have to come without offering only the high priest didn't that counted for everybody and when the hype when he brings the high priest up he's in filthy rags because israel's sinners they're all sinners they're backslid and the whole charge that satan is now suing god for control of of of the creation because god has said this would be his people but yet god can't uh can't countenance sin he can't there's no way to let sin be part of his economy and so satan is saying now you said they'd be your family but you couldn't keep them out of sin so your word is broken and now you have to let me have the throne and god in zechariah 3 is going to dismiss all of his evidence all of his dna all of his replay high def didn't matter cinematic didn't matter he's got the goods on israel and god's going to dismiss all of his evidence and throw his lawsuit out of court based on one simple thing election he's not going to debate him not going to argue the case the case is dismissed now get out of my courtroom and don't you ever accuse my family again see that's why when you come to revelation 5 you have you have a strong angel representing our prophet you have john representing our bride you have the one seated on the throne from daniel's vision you have the 420 elders you have the clear crystal glass seat in front of him you have the heavenly host the one person you don't have at the time when he claims the book is the accuser why because there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus because you find out that you didn't start here you're not finishing here you're not from here see you came from god you're going back to god you're you're a heavenly citizen here you're a pilgrim and a stranger but the beauty of it is in christ you have diplomatic immunity and you are immune from prosecution you're above the law has no applica application to you whatsoever you're free in christ see so we find that in revelation 12 the bride goes up physically and satan is literally physically cast out not just removed from his uh his ability you know to have a to have his case heard but now he's actually literally cast out because once the bride gets there there's no room for him and so he's he's cast out and i heard a voice in heaven and i heard a loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and catch it and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ and now here you've got father son see and and and and and but but really the godhead is understood once we had the opening of the seven seals we understood that godhead is husband and wife because father son don't produce anything you understand that's just god going forward in expression that great eternal being became an expression and took that designation of son it was a title it wasn't a name his name was jesus see and that's why mary was told implicitly make sure you call his name jesus because that had always been his name so so we find then that this is why a prophet would preach the invisible union see of the heavenly groom and the earthly bride because that's god's godhead you understand that's why he would that's why marriage and divorce was such an important sermon see that that's that's exactly why he's he's preaching the the you know here he's going to describe heaven he's going to describe earth and he's going to say the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride because this is the understanding that we're coming to understand and this clears up the godhead that's why we know he's not two lords it's just christ in his bride it's christ it's god and his family here it's god and his family now look at the progression when you come to the that's at the beginning of the tribulation and by the time you get to the end of the tribulation which is covered in the previous chapter remember you can't read revelation like a newspaper you can't read it linearly so revelation 11 these events are happening prior or after revelation 12. so and and in revelation 12 at the beginning of the tribulation it's the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ by the time you get to the end of the tribulation and the seventh angel sounded and there was great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ it's not god in christ now it's lord because now it's moved in the son who's our now our husband and it's mr jesus and mrs jesus you see the progression it's all progressing it's all unfolding and our god see uh uh uh the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ so i'm just going over these simple these are rudimentary things just to get your mind and going in the direction i want it to go this morning all right so god in christ then we find then of course in brother branham uh their brother brown teaches that in the seals and and sermons afterward where he talks about that that christ is the bride clearly that's tape teaching i'm not making that up and i can be happy to give you the references but so we find out then that it's coming the kingdoms of our lord and his christ and so here we see then the the truth of the godhead which we are a part of that it's god expressed in a divine family and we found out last night according to isaiah 42 that jesus is the elected son the creator of all that is and so he became a man to be a kinsmen redeemer and and so so back in that in the the very first thing that god did in fact is god the very first thing he created was to express himself his first act of creation was to move forward and express him and become the son and then the and then the and in that order in the order of the son he created everything that's why the bible says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made see he's not talking about the man the human standing in matthew 18 he he's going 118 he's going all the way back john john goes all the way back in the beginning was the word see it was with god in fact it was god now the only way that even can make sense is it's an expression of god it's not a second person see so so we and that's why brother brandon would say jesus wasn't a second person he was the person see and it's it's all bound up in the paradox of how he he became a man and brother branham you know that that's a lot of times where teachers get in trouble is they're just bound and determined for some reason to do away with the paradox i don't get it i mean brother branham called it a paradox and he keeps saying brother brandon would say i don't i don't understand how that how that he was god but yet he was a man he said but he was that's late in his ministry he called it a paradox a paradox is something that can't actually be but it actually is even though it can't exist it does so it's a paradox it can't be but it is though it can't be it's impossible but it is but it's impossible but it is amen and so brother branham said it was a paradox in his day how that great god could be a man and be the same person he said and it's a paradox today see and so it's not something it's not like a theological lesson you're not going to go to a uh uh you know a white board and draw god out like a like a an einstein formula and that's not a mathematical equation he he he defies that he he exceeds that there's no way to it's the unsearchable riches here's what we know i was in him i believe him he's a part of me he lives in me lives through me and i've got a kingdom coming of which i'm going to be a part of see and so i know he's the very god he's not a second or third person so he is the beginning of the creation of god so the act as we said of creation his first movement in creation was to move forward from being that eternal being and he's going to move forward into an expression of light that could be seen brother branham says that could be something that could be seen now at the time there was nothing to even see so if a tree falls in a forest and there's no one there to hear it doesn't make a sound okay we're going in circles here but but he says there was he did that so something that could be seen so the so the pillar of fire the logos being the first expression in creation as i said takes the designation son so it's a title it's not his name his name is jesus so he comes now so by so by the time as we said last night by the time we get to jesus of nazareth god's plan of redemption is already way downstream he's been working on that for millennia across the ark of the old testament of time he every king every priest every prophet every warrior champion of faith it was all portraying what he would be the fullness of you see and so so we find then that that he he when he comes in his incarnation in his human in his humanity which he was not half god and half man you see beca because there was no instrumentation it wasn't uh it wasn't god's seed in mary's egg brother branham says that's a false teaching he was a complete spoken word see and so so we find that that that that when he comes into the earth he's he's literally a prototype of an entire word-born family he's a brand-new type of man see the he's the only begotten of the father why is he why does it say that because he's born of a woman see not he wasn't just spoken in decree it's not like melchizedek god does come took calcium potash cosmic light build a body and stepped into it built another one for an angel built another for an angel he comes to he comes to uh to to to adam adam's not born of a woman the first adam but this second atom is a prototype for the coming kingdom he's a brand new type of person understand now every person is coming to be exactly what he would become see and and and he came without sin to redeem you who were trapped in sin to take us all back to our sinless condition that we enjoyed before the world began only he wasn't a redeemer so now when we get back there we bring more honor to him because we needed savings see so when you wrap your mind around the unsealed truth that you are now a continuation of that same creation and you're headed toward a body say well i don't have a body like his you will you'll have a body even like an unto his glorious body so today then you have arrived today here we are february 2022 and we have arrived at the stage of god's divine plan to become a family remember it's always better when you go back to genesis and and and and and you say well god created a family you'll do yourself a favor to realize that it's better thought of god became a family all right so he became a family because if you just think that through it's not difficult because remember brother branham said that that that we can't annihilate anything so you can even take a piece of paper and burn it say oh hi night lady said no you didn't all you did was turn it back to its previous gases he and brother brown said if time would go on long enough it could come back to paper again which means it came back to a tree again and got remanufactured and it's a sheet of paper so you understand so so in other words in other words when god was going to have a bride it wasn't just that he was going to just create something apart from himself like i mean the bible says he created hell for the devil and its angels it's not eternal remember the man said hell's not eternal it was it got created it had a time when it began had a time when it'll be done with it and he'll he'll disassemble it see so so god couldn't have a bride to where sometime if time went on long enough he'd finally have to do it again because she had come to an end he wasn't going to do it that way he was going to express a bride something from within him that would be a part of him as eternal as he is [Music] see it's on this basis that god was able to justifiably dismiss all of satan's charges even though he had the goods it didn't count because satan was basically saying god you're guilty of sin when he's saying your bride is guilty of sin he's saying god is guilty of sin and that's upsets god so he's he doesn't even like to be limited you don't limit the god of israel much less accuse him of injustice israel tried that and god got pretty upset over that he told the prophet you go back and tell them they say i'm unjust i'm telling you you tell them i said they're the ones who are unjust they say i'm unfair they're the ones who are unfair and then god goes into this big uh way of proving it and kind of put everybody to silence and so we find then that that we have arrived at the stage of god's divine plan to become a family create a kingdom of royalty to rule and reign with him over the expanse of the universe which as we were saying the other day science now believes that that that the universe is likely even still expanding and they can't already can't find the parameters of it and they and i just said wonderful because an ever-expanding christ and an ever-expanding kingdom is going to need an ever-expanding universe because the bible says of the increase of his that's christ of the increase of his kingdom the increase there shall be no end it will never stop increasing oh we're headed somewhere friends i'm here to tell you your future is bright oh your future is bright a little while longer don't worry god's under control so so then so then this is the this is the greater meaning behind saying that you are and i've repeated it several times and so now i'm aiming to unpeel some more layers because i'm get i'm aiming at the greater meaning behind saying that you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come that is to say that it's not just about oh wow armageddon's coming that is that's just that's sure but that's a very shallow take on it first of all you're not even going to have to worry about armageddon so what's what's the point of god even saying that to his church at all see so what it what but the greater meaning of it is that when when i say you have arrived you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come you have arrived at the end of mankind's 6 000 year journey in a fallen condition you are the generation you are the generation that will see the end of this 6 000 year journey you're the generation upon whom the ends have come the end of what the end of mankind in a fallen state the end of the earth in a fallen state we're not ever going to have to come back here and do this again hallelujah hallelujah oh my see not the end of the world world can end the world the world can't be annihilated it's an eternal attribute of god it's not the end of life you you're those upon whom the ends of the world have come not the end of life but a new beginning that will never end of the increase of the kingdom of jesus christ there shall be no end so this is the goal that he had from the beginning as we were reading to you the quotes from christ is the mystery of god revealed you've been studying it here and so this is the one goal that he had from the beginning and you yourself have arrived at this epic time in civilization see and the world is missing it they're missing it the most epic moment in human history and the world is as blind to it as a bat but blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear i tell you many great prophets and sages even angels have desire to understand the things that are given into your hands today oh no wonder we rejoice no wonder we're happy in the lord oh my you know epic is a is an often overused word a lot of times its original meaning is lost be but epic actually is a long poem it's typically one derived from ancient oral tradition narrating the deeds and adventures of heroic hall of fame or legendary figures or the history of a nation and so it's a long poem it's a it's a long story it's a saga it's a chronicle of legendary figures see and this this is exactly why brother branham would use the word drama in shalom he says to god it's all a big drama and and you know how many times i mean god is loves drama oh god loves to watch our lives and sometimes we get ourselves in a fix and and we're praying out to god and the world's on fire around us and i'm sinking i'm going under the waves and and and the enemies the enemies hurling javelins at me and i uh lord i'm about to be destroyed and he'll just wait and wait and wait and wait till all hope is gone and then he'll come riding in oh champion grab his darling put her on his stallion slay the dragon fly off to glory he loves that he brother branham said he god puts you in situations on purpose to see how you react oh you wanted to say where's my hero where's my hero i'm in a drama and i need my hero oh legendary heroes all warriors all the prophets priests and kings were legendary all the warriors of faith were legendary and you are you are the standing army of the lord in this hour and we're writing a book of the chronicles of the book of acts we're writing a legendary book hallelujah a legendary book that will become part of the hall of fame of heaven now this one goal you still with me so this one goal that he had in all the bible let's revisit it again this morning first when brother branham talks about one goal he comes to the message the queen of sheba 1959 and now the goal is kind of low altitude not very long looking it's it's it's uh noble watch watch how it goes he says it takes more than the power of gifts it takes more than joining a church it takes the birth of the holy spirit to break down our walls see now he's in he's in an interdenominational crowd and he's trying to stand in the middle and say we're all brothers trying to bring him together he says it's going to take more than gifts it'll take more than joining church it takes the birth of the holy spirit to break down our walls and to unite us together as one great christian body moving for one objective and one goal see now when he comes to christ is the mystery of god revealed now he's at a whole different altitude this is an eagle flying through the mind of god and he says he has shown or revealed in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ he says the entire bible is an expression here we go again one goal that god had one purpose that he wanted to achieve in the entire bible so we notice in these two quotes that that the goal of the word has always had more in mind than just making us ecumenical you see it's had it's had a much grander purpose than that that that's it's noble to say as brother branham being a gentleman said we're all one but see brother brandon knew a secret brother branham knew if ever if everybody of all their different denominations of every one of them got a real new birth by the holy ghost that they'd immediately leave their denominations that we'd all be the big family of god see so he he knew that in his mind the holy ghost will produce his real church and it won't be a man-made thing but we find then that that you see the progression in 1959 his one goal is to try to get all the all the churches together and get born again now he's not trying to form the council he's trying to get him born again see and so and so but by the time he comes after the seals it the goal has broadened the plan of god means a whole lot more now now he's standing at a higher altitude looking at the whole plan of god from the from the dawn before the dawn of time till when time is no more and he sees it on this ark of life he sees it all playing out and the whole thing to brother branham he comes said oh it's just god has one goal if you only knew it's just one goal and then later on he'd say see you see it's all just a drama to god it's just all a drama he wrote it it comes from his mind and we're playing our part and you've arrived to this hour where you're playing your part a prophet saw you hallelujah see so so we find out that that sometimes we you know he we we wonder at his dealings with us but you must always remember that that god's goal is not just limited to human cooperation it's always been about coming into his vision of his expression see in the form of his eternal family he's trying to bring you to something this perspective is important because sometimes we wonder at his dealings in our life see we are down across many years and sometimes even decades and some of you who are very young have a hard time really appreciating this effectively but to us who have been fighting a long time covered a lot of ground covered a lot of years cried a lot of tears had to got knocked down and had to keep standing up because i'm just never going to not stand up amen i'm just going to dust myself off and go forward again and if i get knocked down again well i'll just stand back up dust myself off and go forward again i'm never stopping i'm never quitting i'm going forward ever forward sometimes things that happen in our life can often seem to make no sense to us and leave us wondering but he's never been merely trying to make you a better human being and that's what you've got to own today he's never been trying to make you just merely a better human being he's been honing you into a vision that he had of you before there was stardust so a lot of times you don't understand what's happening in your life because you don't see the ark the big perspective you don't see this has all been part of god's plan and he's not caught off guard by anything and he's not sidetracked even by your stumblings i mean he he promised david that that that through him the messiah would come promised jacob jacob was a a shyster and a liar and david was an adulterer and a liar and a murderer you understand did that stop messiah from coming no it didn't stop the promise of god you can't stop the promise of god let me tell you something friends if you're the gene seed of god you're going in a rapture and there's nothing you can do about it see so so he's he's often needed to move us into positions unexpected so that he can so that he can better mold you into the image and the order that he had of you before the foundation of the world you realize that this world that we live in presently and here's my title today the world we live in presently is a world between worlds scientists and science fiction and hollywood and everybody likes to make a big deal over multiverse and are there and there are there is multiverse but it's they don't understand it's just dimensions they don't understand it's just dimensions see and so god's not somewhere far off beyond alpha centauri or you know he he'd be not far from us all right the the promise of the holy ghost is that we would know no longer would anyone need to say hey can somebody get in a ship and sail across the sea and bring him back to us or can somebody go and take flight and go to heaven and bring him back down because he's nighty even in thy mouth see he's right here among us and so so you realize that we live presently in a world between worlds this is what jacob came to understand now a world where we were i want you to think about your first world here's your first multiverse it's a world where we were perfect in the mind of god we read about it in job's vision last night morning stars sang together and sons of god shouted for joy sinless perfection they had never fallen god had not been able to be a redeemer yet i understand this was his whole family and his mind projected in that form of his mind that is reality now you don't want to trap him you know limit and put god in a box to think your concept of reality is his all i can say is that a prophet said in his mind you existed and his thoughts are not exactly like yours you get a thought you actually gotta draw out blueprints and go build the thing but in god's mind it already exists his thoughts are actually already real in substance that's why faith is the substance it's not a mental thought it's not a hope for it's a substance so the first world was a world where we were perfect having never sinned existing in the mind of god in a state of absolute perfection paul speaks of this in various places in ephesians 1 4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world before time was time you understand that we should be holy and without blame before him in love that was his determination before you got here and nothing you do here is going to undo that vision that he had of you see and so and so brother brandon picks it up in the c.a.b the the the and uh he says the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself he refers to ephesians 1 9 he refers to romans 9 11. it says that the purpose of god according to that the purpose of god according to election might stand see and brother brahm says you can't read it any other way the hard purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and so he chose from within himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so we see then in our first place in our first world we were perfect we were unmarred we were unfallen see but now it's interesting because if you go over into the book of revelation you find that you you you're many places i'm not going to track them all out today but the testimony that is constantly repeated you're constantly reading is you see a redeemed family in that world future there's a redeemed family who have been bought by the blood of the lamb who have overcome by the blood of the lamb who have been redeemed to god back to god amen so so there was this world where you were unfallen unmarred perfect in the mind of god there's this world going forward where you're going to be a redeemed people restored back so then that puts you in this world in the middle you say what's this world between those worlds this is the world where god would take that family and drop them into sin and take them through life and redeem their soul and bring them back to glory you're living in a world between worlds somebody asked me said so you don't believe in purgatory i said i sure do he said you do i said yeah i'm in it i mean now and i'm not going to give you any money to pray me out of it see so you see this let me just catch a few of these here's the bride revelation 5 9 brother branham identifies her said and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and hope the seals thereof for thou slain has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation you see in revelation 14 you see the hundred forty four thousand and they sung as it were a new song before the throne before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred forty four thousand which were redeemed from the earth so a world that now is where we were born in a fallen condition and at some point at some point uh brought back to god through the power of the holy ghost in a supernatural rebirth see so powerful is this new birth that you are reckoned as one sitting right now in heavenly places with christ jesus and brother branham said it takes the sinner and puts him back across the chasm back across that he couldn't get over that chasm christ bridged it and now the blood of christ puts the man back across the chasm sitting together in heavenly places he explains that in in in god hidden and revealed in simplicity and talks about it a little more in the breach and so so we realized then that you know now look at this position because if you think about david all right when when david when samuel i just want to show you what i just said in this as a principle in the bible when you go to david's anointing and samuel comes and and i'm here to anoint a son king and he lines up the hole and samuel thinks it's got to be this first one he's big tall dark and handsome god says no and rejected him okay well number two no not him either three no four no five no goes all the way down the line no no no no you got any more sons well i i do but he's kind of a i mean he's not really yeah he's just a scrawny little guy out here he's good for tending my sheep and that's about it and he says bring him to me and because god had already warned the prophet don't don't look at it like humans do i don't look at it like you do see and god saw a purpose in this in this david coming and he he had david out there learning how to be a king see and he he had him out there learning these things and so that brother branham said that's where he learned to write still waters and he leadeth me besides still waters and david and you know he he restores my soul and he said he was a man of the of the wilderness he wrote like that and so so we find that he anoints him king and it's it's interesting because brother branham says in the great warrior david he says notice he right then when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as a king right there and it'd be a long time before he ever sat on a throne and stood under a crown amen and so we find that that that he samuel poured the oil on his head and and said god has called you to be a king and right there before he's ever a king in god's mind he's already positionally placed brother branham says amen you are placed positionally in christ jesus as kings and priests is that right i ask you is that right the moment you receive the holy spirit god places you in the kingdom and air hallelujah i'm an heir of god i'm a joint heir with christ what a beautiful picture brother branham says there you are so the message then came to us for the purpose of calling the elect out of the ecumenical group to join with the word to be part of the end-time bride that's what the message came to do that is the message is revelation 18 4. malachi 4 speaks of the messenger the anointing he'll be under revelation 10 places him where he is in the in the hierarchical order of god unveiling himself but revelation 18 4 is the message come out of her my people and so we find that this revealed word of the hour restores us to the kind of faith that can mold us and it can shape us and it can make us ready for the body change you can't do it you're too strong for you you're too much in your own way you've got to let god come and do it so we find then that that this revealed word is what is what do what does it it makes us ready because faith comes by hearing right i was speaking to a man one time he was starting to look at the message and and i you know he just was struggling and everybody's trying to church is trying to witness to him people friends trying to witness to him and i just waited and i just waited kept praying until finally the lord showed me what his problem was and then i went to see him and we sat down and i already knew it's kind of you feel a little bit a little bit like jacob because you already got the answer and you're playing coy with him and i already knew what the answer was i know what his problem was and uh and i just kept guiding the conversation because i wanted him to say it and he got to the point where his problem was that he loved the doctor and he loved the teaching but this whole thing of the badger skin this prophet he couldn't seem to get past a prophet why don't god have a prophet i got my bible i got the holy ghost i got prayer god god got jesus what are you the prophet it's common it's a fair argument see and so i knew that was his issue and so i just kind of guided the conversation and finally you know you but you love you believe oh yes it's so wonderful i never heard anything like it but and i said well you know what's what's the well go ahead and say it just say what it is just i'm ready for you to say it and he said well you know this whole thing about a prophet and i said oh is that all i said goodness friend i said you don't have to believe in a prophet to go to heaven he said i don't i said no he said what about william branham i said you don't have to believe william branham was a prophet at all to go to heaven to go to heaven you have to accept the atonement of jesus christ at calvary see because i had secret intel i had the seventh seal where brother branham is talking about the foolish virgin and they end up in heaven but they go in a tribulation for their sin of unbelief and rejecting the message but they're but they're they're that remember the virgin even though they're unwise that you don't correlate them to the harlot daughters of revelation they're not the harley daughters they are virgins they are righteous they are saints and the kings shall say to the righteous matthew 25 and the righteous shall say to the king see and so they were sanctified living people they had brother adam said they're not saved in the tribulation they're already saved from destruction that's me adding that just for clarity they're not saved in the tribulation they're already saved but they have to go in the tribulation to receive their purging because they rejected the truth but they're virgins and they'll be now they won't make the millennium they'll they'll have to stay under the altar and god's got various places under the altar but but after the millennium they'll come up for the judgment and they'll come into eternal life and be granted eternal life the very fact that they're at the judgment bar shows they don't have eternal life because if they did they'd be seated with us on the throne that they're being judged shows they don't they were never born again see so you can have the holy ghost on your flesh go straight to hell you can have it anointing your spirit go straight to hell it has to contact the gene of god and come to life and annihilate an old nature and you become a new creation in christ jesus [Applause] and then it's like paul tried to explain although it's difficult in human language paul kept saying i i i'm alive but i i'm i'm not alive okay what is it paul well i'm i live but uh i i'm not alive i don't live but i live but but i don't live please paul cut to the chase okay here it is i i live but i but i don't live it's not me it's christ who lives inside me i died my old life old things are passed away all things have become new so we find then so then there i am armed with that intelligence and i said oh goodness you don't have to you don't have to believe william branham was a prophet he said i don't i said no not at all i said uh i said you can you can still go to heaven he said really i can and when i say that he just kind of relaxed and he lowered his shields and i bulls-eyed him and i said but now of course faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word so in order to go on a rapture i said now you're going to need rapturing faith and since rapturing faith you're going to need a rapture word and if you need a rapture word well we better talk about a prophet [Applause] all right won the day amen we won the field drove the enemy off so the nine the 1963 opening of the seven sealed mystery was to show us how that god redeemed the souls of his family through the ages and the power of the spirit that worked through those ages remember now the advantage is because we're at the omega we're at the last because remember he if you go in the book of revelation you always find him saying first and last alpha omega and he doesn't really say much about the middle it's always first and last alpha and omega and there's not a lot said about the middle and it's puzzling until you go you have to have a profit to untie that and brother branham explains it to say he said just imagine the the menorah the seven lamp stands and he said picture if you will jesus is walking in the midst of the seven lamp stands and he has his hands outstretched to the first stage and the last age he's the alpha the omega the first and the last the reason it doesn't say a whole lot about the middle is because while he was in the middle john saw him walking through the seven lamp stands he was always with the church he said i'll never leave you see so while he was while jesus was in the middle not everything in the middle was him because it had been mongrelized and and and denominations and creeds of man had mingled with it and made a mongrelized word so the promise was when i get to the omega it'll be the same as the alpha and i'm going to undo all of this mongrelizing and i'm going to bring back a pure word to my bride see so we find that that that's the final you know the final taking it has to be that way friends because the final when he claims the book you you have to remember that god is not coming back to rapture your bible this is the third iteration of god's word the first iteration was in the stars he wrote that one long before he wrote this one then he wrote another one in enoch's pyramid that was the second iteration this is the third one there's coming another one you know what former to be it'll be behind skin he's not coming to rapture a bible he's coming to rapture people who have become the bible who have become the living word you've been returned back in god's great drama see so that's exactly why it makes perfect sense all the visions and dreams brother branham had even when he tore the the capstone off and it's white stone and of course it would be there's no writing of course there wouldn't be because this mystery is going to be written behind skin it's not going to be on tables of stone the white stone was a new name see in in the white stone is a new name and brother branham said the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of god now how does god interpret his word he brings it to pass so it's not going to be written in stone it's going to be written behind skin it's going to be a living church a living bride the final voice to the final age this is jesus christ see so it all makes perfect sense it all lines up perfectly see so a world between worlds a world between worlds that we call life now the term life you know let's look at it in a minute for a minute in the in the light of god's meaning how we doing okay i haven't got an alarm yet i i'm always careful wearing my apple watch when i preach at home i have a dress watch when i travel i don't take it and i take my apple watch so many times i'll get to preach and get wound up and get jumping and screaming and waving my arms like a madman and and i'll get a buzz and i'll look down it's a good thing because she's about to call 9-1-1 and she do you need an ambulance i think i think she thinks i'm being killed and and so she's trying to call no i'm fine be quiet don't interrupt me and so i changed some settings recently hopefully i've avoided that last night i think i would have set her off and i didn't so we might be good amen so so we find then that that we're very often you know too often times we use the term life much too loosely we do we use the term life to describe many things and i'm not going to go into a laundry list today i'm just going to hit it as an overview but you hear it all the time this is my life you know uh that's your life you you live your life as we're saying last night do you i'll do me leave me alone i'll make all my i i said a girl one time we were preaching uh goodness where was i at we were in uh we were in the ukraine of all places and uh we were had a family camp there and uh the office where we had to go was a business office his only place we could call out and send emails and stuff and this young lady and we kept coming up she knew we were ministers you know devils are just disrespectful and and on purpose and yeah for real and and when we come in there finally she tries to start up a you know started chat me up and say uh oh you know she's bragging about her night on the town how she partied and it's just 20-something-year-old woman and and she just oh she got drunk and she had some friends and she had a good time and uh and i just and i thought goodness gracious she knows i'm a minister and i say and i start to speak to her about the lord and immediately when she saw that her allurements weren't getting to first base and i just want to talk about the lord immediately she puts up a wall and she just threw up her hand it's my life spoke broken english my life and i i i just i said to her i said sister who in the world told you that it's my life i said no it's not your life did you get it can you keep it it's not your life see but we use that term it's my life it's your life it's their life live and let live but rarely does a person and particularly a lot of times young people because of their lack of experience especially young people fail to grasp the true reality that it's actually his life lent to you for a purpose see it's not your life you didn't get it can't keep it see and that's why everything that has breath should praise the lord oh oh mays jackson the truck driver's special do you ever hear him brother david on the radio a truck driver special old maze jackson and he is to say i'll tell you friends the bible says let everything that has oh baptist preacher let everything that has breath praise the lord if you're not going to praise the lord stop breathing i said amen hey man i've repeated that around the world that's the one piece of baptist doctrine i agree with but rarely you know do we do we catch do we really take hold of the true reality that it's all his life given to you for a purpose and a grand purpose may suggest a grand purpose see as we've been speaking on and and this is why this is exactly why we gather young people to try to to try to our desires to impart years of wisdom to you to hope that that our mistakes can be stepping stones for you to say don't step there there's a pitfall you'll twist an ankle don't do that go around see and and and as we've as we've been learning that's why you know there's value as the bible talks about in the age then the council of of aged men and soul you know these are things that we've learned through observation through many uh trials and errors living life and learning from it and you know it's true that you do have to live your own life and you do have to make your own choice i can't make it for you see i i i'm not you know uh myself you know to accept the plan of god and to come to know him by the power of the holy ghost that's a decision i made that's a decision you've got to make i i'm not here you know to tell you what choice to make i'm only here to tell you you have a choice amen don't let the devil tell you that you don't see and so but all we can do myself a pastor parents mentors all they can do is guide you to him brother branham talks about it time and eternity blending together he talks about it many places how can i overcome we have seen a star in the east and have come to worship him who do you say this is and and he talks about the blending of time and eternity and we oftentimes much too narrowly think of that as just you know we sing the song terry tidwell wrote i'll speed up and they'll slow down there is a land remember that there is a land i'm homesick for and we we talk about i'll speed up they'll slow down time will blend with eternity but brother branham i'm not going to take all the time to read these quotes brother branham is going to explain that the greatest form the reason that's going to happen is because right now it's it's an eternal god trying to blend with you in time he's trying to blend it's it's the it's the holy spirit blending eternity with time you're stuck in time he's in eternity and the whole purpose of the holy ghost is to give you a blended life and that's why brother branham would say as much of the world as you can take out he'll come in and fill that and he'll feel that and he'll feel that and that's why paul said i want you to be have all the fullness i want you to be filled with all the fullness of the knowledge of god not just data not just theology but his experience see you learn by experience it far supersedes book learning so so we find then that he it is who gave you life and he's the only one who can blend life with blend you with him now so so when we begin to look at our life all right and if the time of your life expires before his return then he alone he alone is the only one who can give you eternal life now and change you at the rapture he alone that if you if your life expires before the rapture he's the only one who can call you from the grave so the so the purpose just remember that whenever you hear brother branham say time and eternity will blend just remember yeah that's right that's going to happen because he's blending heaven and earth are blending now see see our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in this earth as it is in heaven make this man look like that man make this vision look like that vision bring me to look like him i want to stop being me i want to be like him i'm going to tell you something friends i cannot get my mind around anyone who would ever see a vision of jesus and want to remain themselves once i saw the lord and all of his glory and all of his beauty i didn't want to be me anymore i was tired of being me i wanted to be him hallelujah he'll raise you from the dead i promise you'll never die again now can i get to my text i just need 10 more minutes all right so don't don't panic you'll be all right just breathe you'll be fine few mortals friends few mortals were ever given such an opportunity at so young in age to view the true multiverse as jacob did he's laying there on the earth and there's a ladder attached with its feet on the earth and the top is attached to heaven and it's so steady that angels are ascending and descending and then he looks and sees the lord standing at the head of it looking down on his life and talking to him he saw heaven above and the earth and he he's standing and here he is on the earth he lives on the earth just beneath and here's this ladder and and and and he's literally living at that moment tell the president i can't talk right now i'm preaching amen tell him i'll call him later we find that that here he is he's living in a multi-world reality and suddenly more clear it's more clear to jacob than ever before in all of his life he had heard all the stories of his grandpa he'd heard the stories of his prophet daddy he had been raised in message homes but now he's experiencing you mean this is real oh yes it's real this ain't just a story i'm you haven't believed cunningly devised tales you haven't been turned from truth to fables this is the logos this is the word this is the truth this is god see a world between worlds is this life a very narrow span spurgeon called it a very narrow span of mortal existence between eternal realms for you and i friends uh we're here in this in this eternal in this little narrow span between eternal realms of a previous existence and the realities of god's mind and we've been unfolded into an expression and and someday we're going to be in that perfect expression in the eternal ages to come in the former existence in the mind of god you weren't lost in the world to come according to revelation you stand redeemed in god and so now we see a further application this is why brother branham would call it a future application of the hidden manna now it had an application in the pergaming age but brother brandon said it also has a future application and he said it will be the eternal unfolding of the revelation of jesus christ and the eternal ages to come brother brown says how else do you make the scripture fit his unsearchable riches see so so so now you're seeing friends that if i started somewhere and i can already see i'm going somewhere then how could i not acknowledge that that i'm here on the move you say what's the significance of that i'm not just here i'm on the move i'm headed somewhere i'm living by a purpose i came for a purpose i'm here literally being brought into the image of god's vision that he had of me before the foundation of the world so between there and the eternity's past and the eternity's future reality something has happened and what happened is is that you came through a fallen birth you're going to be redeemed back now we call it the past and we call it the future but both of those words really past and future really are actually kind of incompatible with the term eternities see because the only context they in fact is when you once you conclude that that the only context that they could apply would be by comparison you know of mortality and a span of linear time that's the only way it even makes sense that's the only way i can even call that past because to god it's not past and that's not future it's all right now that's what brother branham experienced he tried to explain it when he came back from beyond the curtain of time he said it there is no yesterday there is no tomorrow you you've just arrived it's just it's just all of it see because that and he's struggling you can hear him struggling on the tape trying to find the words i don't have the words now he doesn't have any problem describing what he saw he doesn't have any problem describing what he heard but what he couldn't describe is how he felt see he couldn't get his mind he said i don't have enough language and so what i can tell you is that brother branham would refer to this life and and correlate it through a type when he's preaching flashing red light and really brother branham is trying to get you to understand this life is just a whistle stop as spurgeon said it's just a narrow little span you'll soon be acrostid why why did he say my my question becomes to you young people then why would you chase and put all your energies into something that's just a narrow span and it's just a whistle stop anyway and the only purpose this isn't life i'm i came from life i'm going to life see the only real life is god's life and the only real purpose is god's purpose because that's the only thing that's eternal hallelujah thank god we're living for a real purpose today so i don't chase it that's why jesus said don't lay up treasures here where thieves can break in and rust and moth can take it lay your treasures up in heaven it's just a narrow span you'll soon be a cross it means almost no well you say oh let me tell you all this life is is a training grounds it's just a training field it's a proving grounds you're just here come and fallen redeemed back to god and now you're set on the path to head to glory and god is now saying well why brother jason my goodness my life and this happened and this happened this happened and i look at my friend over here and this didn't ever happen to her that she'd have to go through that and why did i have to you know and here's another friend yeah brother jason you understand what i had to go through and here's a body of mine he didn't have to go through now i say look first of all you don't know what you'll be on the other side but he does see and he's got to have you ready here for your rulership there so how about you just let him be the captain how about you just let him guide the ship how about you just when you hear those as brother branham said you might be standing there reading the paper eating your peanuts and and people milling around he said but buddy when those bars come down and those lights and those bells ding ding ding ding ding ding he said you better throw those peanuts down you better put away that newspaper you better grab your bags because this thing's only stopping for a moment and you better be ready to get on board see so we find then that brother brandon when he actually drew it he drew a circle uh referring to eternity and at the bottom he he kind of drew this little you know and right at the bottom just like a little loop down he's coming around his eternal circle and he's preaching it to his church and he gets right here and he goes okay and then back up into it and he said now my wife mita she said bill that kind of looks like a hickey now that's an old southern term i i don't know if y'all know what that means it's it's like a duma flitzy you ever like a thingama thingamabob you know i mean i used to have a buddy i'd say what in the world is that he would say it's a doohickey from a thingamabob and so it you know it's it's like it they even it came it comes from like a pock like a like a fester like a sore and and we find that she said it's like a little hickey and really the whole beauty of it was was that what brother branham was trying to say was look you came from eternity and it's all just a big circle but to make him a redeemer he had to let you drop down into a space of time and then he saves you brings you back up into eternity and you just carry right on where you always had been that's what life is about so no wonder the bible would say cast your cares upon him for he careth for you oh if you just realize he's really got the whole world in his hands he's really got your children he's really got your family he's really got your marriage he's really got your health he's really got your finances he's got your churches he's got your pastors he's got the whole world in his hands see and i see myself there in his mind back in the first place i see myself in revelation as a redeemed expression and we realize nothing can stop him see i'm just seeing how much i need to skip yeah we've said all that last night good good good don't say it again you know when you really if you could grasp and i'm just coming to a close if if you could grasp what this means but a little friends you'd live your narrow span differently as young men and young women you'd make your mind up now to say wow i had all these plans for life and i come to these meetings and found out life's just a narrow span and i'm just caught between two worlds and and i'm purpose by god and i'm on my way somewhere and i'm gonna have to you might have to need to leave here and reformulate you might have to change your priorities a little bit nothing wrong with with you know going forward nothing wrong with excellence nothing wrong with improving yourself but how where's your priorities how is it that god and righteousness and holiness and spirituality is is four fifth six down on your list instead of first way up here see where brother ram said those priorities ought to be and i'm talking about religious remember we read the quote brother satan don't care how religious you are i'm not i've seen a lot of people get religious but brother aaron they don't never seem to get more spiritual they they get much more religious but they they seem to never grow up and mature and become spiritual and so if you really caught it but just a little bit you know you wouldn't toss your limited spend into the winds if some uh some lie the world is telling you some imagined freedom you you wouldn't you know as satan would like you to do as satan would like you to do you wouldn't toss it uh to reckless to recklessness and a life of sin and some idea that the hollywood promotes of throwing off all responsibility hollywood is so glamorized you know such a such a waste of this narrow span such a waste of this world between worlds you wouldn't allow your feet to run swift to mischief you would never agree to abandon morality nor would you agree to abandon any word of god see you'd realize what every prophet realized when they ascended into those high atmospheres moving between worlds past and present future they always taught humanity that that when you abandon the line and order of god's word you're abandoning life you cannot succeed you must fail you have to fail because anything outside of the line and order of god's word is not eternal and it has to come to an end and so so so the very source of life that that you know that the world thinks they understand what life is so misunderstanding what real life is but you here today and it is our hope and it is the hope of of all the ministry here at this church and the whole reason we've assembled you here and brother david bore the great expense and and his helpers bearing the great load is to get you to understand who you really are and what this life is about and what's your purpose here because i think i've established you have a purpose see the god of this evil age hides this awareness from you you just remember that when you go from here after today you remember brother jason told you that that's his that's he's a specialist at it of hiding this awareness of everything i've been preaching to you since last night and today everything he does is designed to keep you from seeing this high altitude view see where from here you know you you see you see the world for real i'm gonna i'm gonna move on i'm determined to get to this one last part so jacob saw this world between worlds and he purposes in his heart that the creator of these worlds would be his god amen it's interesting that jacob conditionalized his allegiance uh and he actually conditioned it to to joining you know to joining becoming the expression of god because he said if he'll do this i'll he'll be my god if he'll do this then i'll serve him if he'll do this i'll give him the tithe in other words uh everything that he wants me to be i'll if he'll help me and bring me back and take care of me and protect me and bring me back to my father's house in peace then i will acquiesce i will do all of that stuff and i will i will i will let eternity blend with time see and so so we find then that that that when you when you see yourself in this way you know he would commit his heart you know to nothing less and what's funny to me is that what that that jacob what jacob thought to say was exactly what god was planning to do god already had it it was god's intent all along in fact this is why god agreed to it so quickly god disagreed to it okay it's a deal i'll do this you'll do this you'll do this yes i'll do that if you'll do this okay it's a deal we're done we're going forward jacob unknowingly expresses the desire of god's own heart jacob jacob intrinsically aligns himself with god's eternal purpose for his life see god knew i mean listen friends you think god didn't know god knew he'd have jacob ready for that angel god knew he was going to follow him through all of his life the one standing at the top of the ladder remember the one standing at the top of the ladder i mean he he can see the future just as he says he can see the past see and that's why verse 20 said and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and and will give me bread to eat and ramen to put on see and so god could see his seed god could see his seed in the heart of jacob god is standing there looking down on his life god can see god can see that seed in your heart you wonder how why am i a believer i believe something my friend standing beside me says it's a cult to me it's life how is that possible it's a seed see and and and god could see the seed in the heart of uh of jacob jacob didn't jacob didn't even know god operated like that see and god had already god already had his finishing move ready for jacob he already knew he's going to break him down see and so jacob says so that so that i can come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and god is like you think yeah okay good idea jacob let's go forward see and and i mean we used to love my dad my dad was atarian and taureans are stubborn sorry if you're atarian god bless you my dad was a tyrant so the family always knew we had a neat little crafty way of always you know we wanted to do something we had to make him think it was his idea and you know because he was asking oh ain't we in doing that i'm like well actually i didn't say we how about just me can i go do it you know you know and he was always speaking the royal wait we ain't doing that and so i would have to work my way around and and suggest something and he'd go yo that's a good idea you should go do that thank you sir oh i wonder friends if we have a heart like jacob sometimes more than more than we'd probably like to admit a shyster yup sometimes aren't we come on all you holy people aren't we with his same ups and downs that i see in me you see his ups and downs in you brother branham said jacob he said it's hard to believe he said you really have to believe in the grace of god to believe in jacob this guy was not a good person and and we find out he was not a very good man at all he never was see and and here we are today i hope you can see yourself in the image of god's plan we also have our ups and downs we also sometimes we we where citizens say i haven't cheated anybody sometimes you cheat yourself out of god's blessing you take your life in the wrong direction and you end up costing yourself the bible says sometimes people forsake their own mercies see and so don't think that can't happen and so he was he was never even a very good man until he receives a name change until until until jacob could defeat himself in battle right i'm going to tell you jacob got to that point where by the time that angel comes on the scene brother he is jacob is so tired of being jacob he's so done with being jacob that's where i got that's where you need to get so i'm so tired of being me i don't do nothing but hurt me i cause me trouble i'm always up and down i'm always in and out i'm always on and off i want i don't want to be me i want to be him see oh my until he could defeat himself in battle wrestling with god and then god was there to keep a promise to his seed because that's really what it was all about anyway god had made a promise to abraham and here's god keeping us into the bargain see god has made a promise to your fathers and god is here today keeping a bargain your parents put a token over you your parents are holding faith what's god doing today he's here keeping a bargain he made with them that i'll bless you and and your offspring with you says the lord oh i'm gonna tell you something friends when it when he was at bethel and you know and and and he shares god's expression now this is this is my last point the the thing that jacob did that you have an ability today to do is jacob determined although he didn't even know what he was doing he actually determined to start cooperating in the vision that god had of him now he still was a long time coming 20 years he stayed a shyster stayed at trickster always going left when god said go right god stayed with him going to this city when god said go to that one god stayed with him till he finally comes back but but why would god agree to do all of that knowing i mean god jacob could say you'll be my god and the one standing up there on the ladder could just look back into into the future and go uh yup okay and and i'll serve you uh yup you will that's right and you'll be my god i saw that i get it that's what that's why i'm here see you you understand you think you're making a choice you're not you're only cooperating in my vision and whenever you come to find out that you're cooperating in his vision see that that's now that's what mary did because mary couldn't bring the word to pass in herself she even said it's impossible for me how's this going to be and the angel said the holy ghost will overshadow you and ma the only thing a real believer could do when they hear the word of god is do what mary did she said amen be it unto me and when god's family says amen to his word the only thing god can do is bring it to pass he won't do anything else when he gives you his word and you say it's me lord amen then god begins moving and nothing can stop him as a believer listen friends as a believer with the gene of god in you when you hear the word the only option you have is amen i'm just telling you now it'll haunt you it'll drive sleep from you it'll upend you it'll throw you in the ditch it'll set you on fire it'll do it'll put you out and then it'll run you again but i'm here to tell you when you hear the word of god and that something inside you starts going oh lord oh help me be merciful you might not even come at that moment brother branham laid at a campfire when he was just 18 in phoenix in the desert he's on a a roundup and he said oh slim he said he got his his coal mount he had a a reed on he said he started playing uh i forget down at the cross where my savior died something like that and brother branham said i knew he was calling me i knew he said something was like a deep calling to the deep and he said i'd pull the blanket up over my head and he said he just kept playing it and kept playing and he said i looked i pulled i looked up at those stars and he says all those stars he said like i could hear his voice saying adam son where art thou where art thou and all brother branham could say at 18 years old he said sir i don't know who you are but please don't destroy me without giving me a chance please please help me to know who you are and he he wrote notes and tried to put him in trees and he tried to talk to other people but he had to come and meet jacob's god he had to have a surrender of his whole life in his whole heart hallelujah and then he became legendary oh stand up all you legends come on stand up legends of faith warriors of faith warriors you're gonna your name is gonna hang in the hall of fame of heaven because why when the word spoke to you something intrinsic inside you said amen amen and when you when a believer says amen to god's word god has no option but to bring it to pass i'm here to tell you it's not about will god do it for me he has no option when you say amen to his word he has no option but to bring it to pass oh don't you love him friends i'm sorry to have kept you so long but the word is so delicious oh oh don't we love it oh hallelujah i just say blessed be the name of the lord i wrote a song down oh that that these brothers were singing and i want to sing it again what did i write down jesus messiah you're seeing this i know you can sing it yeah you are singing it too man they're singing it and then they're singing it you were seeing it i could hear all your voices jesus messiah you're a part of that family are you happy for that that should thrill you to realize my goodness the god of all creation the god who created the whole world is my father i have found out today see that's why brother ben would say you didn't come to an altar and become a son of god you found out you always had been that's right so see what what you're doing now here's your opportunity today start cooperating in the vision [Music] god has a purpose that's why i said to you last night if satan has told you that you can't make it call him a liar [Music] if he's told you and he so often does tells you you have no value maybe some experience you have that you wouldn't even want to share with your closest friend and satan has been able to put a place in your mind and say you have no value god doesn't love you do you know he tried to tell brother branham that see brother branham said he tried to tell me that god wasn't real he said but he couldn't because i had already seen him amen so he he didn't have no success at telling me god wasn't real because i had already seen him he said so what he did was he said well but he don't care about you if he cared about you this wouldn't have happened and this wouldn't happen and this wouldn't have happened and brother branham stood there reasoning like eve reasoning saying that's right and this wouldn't have happened that's right and this wouldn't have happened that's right the whole whole town thinks you're crazy you've lost your mind he said i had said no the girls won't talk to you nobody have anything to do with you they think you're nuts and he said i thought lord what have i done he said yeah come on dad will i get him on what have you done he said lord what have i done but preach the gospel night and day that's right that was going uh-huh that was starting to have a camp meeting yeah come on hey man that's right and i i i i fasted all day and i i i preach all day and collapse in a chair and i can go the next day he said so weak from fasting i have to bow my head and pray to put my spurs on to get up the light pole to fix a utility line and he said try to go everywhere go in the garage and say man can i tell you about the lord and the do you know christ and he said night and day night and day and he said and hear and then satan goes yeah and and said when it come to your own wife and baby not only would he not grant your prayer requests he wouldn't even talk to you brother branham said a black sheep come down an area i'm begging for my child and he said a black sheep come down as if god was just saying shut up i don't even want to talk to you and that's when he said see if he wouldn't talk to me then it was satan's turn and satan said now after all you've done for him and brother branham said that's right that's right and brother branham said i was just about to say well if he won't do that then i then i won't and he stopped and something caught something caught he had already hooked the line to calvary and he already realized he's caught and he can't take that next step he turns around to brother now when he says brother neville what if it hadn't been for that seed what if that hadn't been there we wouldn't know meetings like this we wouldn't have a message to believe i'm thankful i'm thankful i say oh god thank you for a vessel because i love this message and i love these meetings i love this word and we love god [Music] and our future is secure i don't know what your life has been i don't know what it'll be tomorrow but i'm here to tell you friends your future is bright you remember brother jason told you i say this to my young people all the time i said to all people i said on every continent this life is not has never been about this life this life is about the next one coming this is just a narrow span it's a world between worlds you didn't start here you're not finishing here you've got a grand purpose amen do you accept it you accept it then my mission is accomplished jesus messiah [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh let's sing a little bit [Music] foreign [Music] yes [Music] hallelujah [Music] sing that first [Music] [Music] across oh [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh bless the lord oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] never before [Music] [Music] i [Music] in desperation [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] right [Music] i am [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] i still [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus christ [Music] amen it's a wise thing to walk away from the world amen it's just a twinkling of the time the world is yes you know it's a great battle paul [Music] god had a plan for paul finally the lord looked at him and said paul it's hard to kick against the sticker it's hard to kick against the prick it's hard to kick against the seed that's already predestinated in you to do what it's going to do that's why we call it surrender that's where you just throw your hands up and say lord i i surrender i give up and and i just couldn't think of the wonderful words and the way it was expressed to you to accept the fact that god has ordered this for your life you didn't choose it you have not chosen me i have chosen you and if i started to work i will finish it to the end and nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand now that's hard to fight against amen you know a great word of wisdom was spoken by one of the writers and he said you know we're foolish people because we compare ourselves one to another and every single one of us in here is so unique and so special and so perfectly created in the mind of god that nobody can take your place so be determined when you leave here be determined to follow your spiritual calling your call from the other world first seek ye first the kingdom of god and all else will be added unto you your jobs your companions your life your homes your houses all the things that follow but if you set your vision to where our brother pointed us to to look over yonder to look across to the other side and know that soon our journey will be over here and we'll pass from this life to another life [Music] oh i pray that that becomes a reality to you our messenger said jesus rose from the grave to reveal to us the secret that there was life after death and i think our brother put it so beautiful this is just such a small sliver of where we've been and where we're going amen so let's don't look back okay if you have things in your life that aren't right well i say unto you your sins are forgiven you say can you say that yes i give you the keys to the kingdom that you can leave those things behind and you can go forward and so i pray that each of you will do that that you'll find your course [Music] and i want to say this too if there's somebody that's never been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ the true christian baptism and the lord's moved on your heart you'd like to be baptized we have the pool ready we'd be more than happy to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ if that's been a question on your heart we just want to make that available to you once again we'd like to thank all of those that drove the young people here that came and chaperoned all of you that opened your homes those of you that cooked but above all those of you who prayed and asked god to do exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think we're going to do that and young people don't ever forget the power of prayer you can move mountains with it so i just i was trying to think of a little song i'd like to sing kind of for a dismissal song it's about you know how that we look and yonder over the river you know i love that song no it's something like uh [Music] that's where i'm going i just call it another thing and then that's just think of what our brother told us this ain't our home in fact we're not even from here we're pilgrims we're strangers you are aliens and you're getting odder and hotter every day [Music] as he builds his kingdom so there's something in us calling a deep calling to a deed [Music] let that set in what our brother told us we are not from here and god wants to fulfill his vision in you and he wants you to look to the promise that he's made so as we're dismissed and we'll sing this as our dismissal let's bow our heads one more time in thanksgiving father we thank you lord we thank you for the word we thank you for the enlightenment to our hearts and a reminder that we are not of this world we are in this world but we are not of this world we are not setting our treasures here on this earth lord we're just passing through we just dropped here for a little space of time that we might know that you're a healer that you're a savior that your attributes might be expressed to us father but we're homesick lord we are so homesick for our home lord increase your strength and your spirit upon those that have received your word today and we ask you to bless them with thanksgiving father we're so thankful for our brother jason father that came and gave of himself of the other brothers that have come and joined side by side that we could praise your name father receive our thanksgiving we worship you and we thank you in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen this will be our dismissal song but this speaks to my heart this morning i'm kind of [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] with [Music] i'm [Applause] [Music] and someday [Applause] [Music] [Applause] shall be [Music] [Applause] [Music] are you looking [Music] [Music] is there's [Music] [Music] god bless you go in peace love one another [Music] uh [Music] okay [Music] is [Music] is [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] sweet [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] you
