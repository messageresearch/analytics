[14:42] God bless you and I welcome everyone in
[14:44] the house of God Amen may have your
[14:46] seats as you invited brother Mike for I
[14:48] saw him reading this morning
[15:10] good morning
[15:12] hope that uh
[15:14] I think that cold probably uh wakes
[15:16] everybody up a little bit hopefully this
[15:18] morning a little bit of a bite
[15:21] we're going to read Psalm 19 this
[15:22] morning
[15:24] it's a very familiar Psalm I think to
[15:26] pretty much everybody in the room
[15:29] but you know when David begins
[15:33] he makes this statement he says
[15:36] the heavens declare the glory of God
[15:40] and the firmament showeth his handiwork
[15:44] and I was thinking about that and you
[15:46] know brother Brandon reminded us that
[15:47] the Stars the skies were the first Bible
[15:52] you know in David's day this was still
[15:54] one of the primary ways
[15:57] that God spoke to people
[16:00] showed them himself
[16:03] and notice how David is we're going to
[16:05] read this here in a little bit describes
[16:07] that first Bible
[16:10] says the heavens declare his glory and
[16:12] the firmament demonstrates his work
[16:14] verse 2 day unto Day uttereth speech and
[16:18] night into night showeth knowledge
[16:20] every day
[16:22] that first Bible
[16:25] speaks of God
[16:27] and every night
[16:30] it makes God known
[16:33] in verse 3 there is no speech nor
[16:35] language where their voice is not heard
[16:39] there isn't a single person
[16:42] on the face of the Earth
[16:44] who doesn't sit under the ministry of
[16:46] that first Bible
[16:49] everybody sits under the witness of that
[16:52] first Bible
[16:55] he goes on to describe that witness
[16:57] we'll read it here in a little bit but
[16:58] the heavens declare his glory
[17:01] and the firmament shows his handiwork
[17:03] you know Paul says in Romans 1 for the
[17:06] invisible things of him
[17:08] from the creation of the world are
[17:10] clearly seen
[17:12] being understood by the things that are
[17:15] made
[17:17] and in Genesis 1 we read the account of
[17:20] him creating this first Bible
[17:23] you know it's in verse six and eight and
[17:25] then on in 14 and 19 and he describes
[17:27] how he arranged to the stars and how he
[17:30] arranged the sun and the path and the
[17:32] course of all of these things
[17:34] specifically to
[17:36] declare his glory
[17:38] and to make his handiwork known
[17:42] and when he had everything put in its
[17:44] place
[17:46] it said in verse 18 and God saw that it
[17:49] was good
[17:51] why was that was it because it was
[17:53] pretty
[17:54] was it because it was the right amount
[17:56] of time and the right amount of Seasons
[17:58] knows because everything was positioned
[18:00] just so
[18:02] to be an acceptable image
[18:05] of what he was wanting to declare
[18:08] it was good it was acceptable
[18:14] you know there's another Bible the one
[18:16] we hold in our hands or digitally or
[18:19] however we have it
[18:22] but you know there are all kinds of
[18:24] churches and people and
[18:26] religions that pour over this book
[18:31] you know trying to understand it from
[18:32] the back to the front in different
[18:34] languages and
[18:37] you know many of them can quote huge
[18:39] huge amounts of it
[18:41] but that was never the point of a Bible
[18:46] you know religion is to this Bible as
[18:49] astronomy is to the first Bible
[18:52] just as strong astronomers will peer at
[18:56] the skies to try to find the source of
[18:58] life
[18:59] or to try to find life
[19:01] all kinds of people will look at this
[19:03] Bible to try to find the source of life
[19:07] but you know I Think Jesus said it best
[19:09] in John 5 search the scriptures
[19:12] for in them you think you have eternal
[19:15] life but they are they that testify of
[19:17] me
[19:19] just as the heavens the first Bible
[19:21] declares the glory of God and chose his
[19:24] handiwork
[19:25] so also does this Bible declare the
[19:28] glory of God and show his handiwork
[19:33] see it's all about
[19:36] making a person known
[19:39] that was the whole point of a Bible
[19:43] you know and it doesn't matter
[19:45] whether the book
[19:47] has King James version on it
[19:49] or voice of God on it
[19:52] if it isn't about finding a person
[19:56] then it's just pouring over words and
[19:59] trying to understand teachings and order
[20:01] your life according to doctrines
[20:04] they are they which testify of me
[20:07] is what he said the heavens declare the
[20:10] glory of God
[20:11] and the firmament showeth his handiwork
[20:13] you know there was a time when Jesus
[20:15] went up on a mountain
[20:17] and he took some of his disciples with
[20:19] him and the scriptures say he was
[20:20] transfigured before them
[20:22] and it's in Matthew 17 and there was
[20:25] something that was made manifest in
[20:27] Jesus that caused Peter to just want to
[20:30] build a tabernacle and start worshiping
[20:31] on the spot
[20:33] something was made known in him but
[20:35] there was a voice that came
[20:37] and it said this in verse 5 this is my
[20:40] beloved Son
[20:41] in whom I am well pleased
[20:44] hear ye him
[20:47] you know just as God was pleased with
[20:49] his first Bible said that it was good it
[20:51] was acceptable because of what it spoke
[20:54] so also was he pleased with this son
[20:57] this firstborn son as he looked at him
[20:59] and said
[21:00] I am pleased with him hear him what he
[21:04] says you know he's so perfectly
[21:06] represents me
[21:08] just listen to what he says because he
[21:11] represents me just as the Stars the
[21:15] first Heavens represent him
[21:19] you know we read
[21:21] it's interesting as we read Psalm 19
[21:23] we'll go here toward the end here
[21:25] David's makes an interesting statement
[21:28] verse 14 he says let the words of my
[21:31] mouth
[21:32] and the meditation of my heart be
[21:35] acceptable in thy sight
[21:37] oh Lord my strength and my redeemer just
[21:42] as he looked at the first Bible
[21:44] and saw how it declared
[21:46] the glory of God
[21:48] and showed his handiwork now he was
[21:51] praying that he too
[21:54] would be acceptable
[21:56] just as the first Bible was acceptable
[21:59] you know I got to thinking about that
[22:01] and
[22:03] you know just like that first Bible
[22:05] and every Bible ever since
[22:08] has declared his glory
[22:10] and showed his handiwork
[22:14] you know my prayer is that may I
[22:18] declare his glory
[22:20] and show his handiwork
[22:23] you know it said that Jesus pleased the
[22:25] Lord and that it showed his image but
[22:27] you know he was the firstborn of many
[22:30] and it says in First John 3 now we are
[22:32] the sons of God
[22:35] and we know that when he shall appear
[22:39] the effect will be that will be just
[22:41] like him
[22:42] so just as he was pleasing
[22:45] just as he
[22:47] offered an acceptable
[22:49] declaration
[22:50] just as the first son offered an
[22:53] acceptable declaration
[22:55] so also is this our calling
[22:59] and that's my prayer for myself
[23:01] you know that may I declare his glory
[23:04] and show his handiwork we can go ahead
[23:05] and stand we're going to read Psalm 19
[23:07] together
[23:10] you know may I like every Bible he's
[23:12] ever had
[23:14] have a life that is constantly speaking
[23:18] constantly making known
[23:21] him
[23:23] May there be nowhere I go
[23:27] that his voice is not heard through me
[23:31] you know Psalm 19 is the witness of the
[23:34] sons of God
[23:36] you know what is declared
[23:39] in heaven what is declared by his first
[23:42] son
[23:43] David prayed that it will be declared
[23:45] through him
[23:47] let's just reads Psalm 19 here together
[23:50] the heavens declare the glory of God and
[23:53] the firmament showeth his handiwork
[23:56] day and today utterance speech and night
[23:59] end of night showeth knowledge there is
[24:01] no speech nor language where their voice
[24:04] is not heard their line has gone out
[24:07] through all the Earth and their words to
[24:09] the end of the world in them hath he
[24:11] said a tabernacle for the son which is
[24:14] as a bridegroom coming out of his
[24:16] chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to
[24:19] run aways is going forth is from the end
[24:22] of the heaven and his circuit unto the
[24:24] ends of it and there is nothing hid from
[24:27] the heat thereof the law of the Lord is
[24:30] perfect converting the soul the
[24:32] testimony of the Lord is sure making
[24:34] wise the simple the statutes of the Lord
[24:37] are right rejoicing the heart the
[24:40] Commandment of the Lord is pure
[24:41] enlightening the eyes the fear of the
[24:44] Lord is clean enduring forever the
[24:47] judgments of the Lord are true and
[24:49] righteous altogether more to be desired
[24:52] are they than gold yea than much fine
[24:55] gold sweet are also than honey and the
[24:57] honeycomb moreover by them is thy
[25:00] servant warned and in keeping of them
[25:03] there is great reward who can understand
[25:06] his errors cleanse thou me from Secret
[25:09] faults keep back thy servant also from
[25:12] presumptuous sins let them not have
[25:14] dominion over me then shall I be upright
[25:17] and I shall be innocent from the great
[25:20] transgression let the words of my mouth
[25:22] and the meditation of my heart be

[40:50] answered his prayer later that day after

[53:44] [Music]
[53:46] you know the
[53:49] easiest way to come into His presence
[53:53] is with your heart
[53:56] you're surrendering your heart
[54:00] taking everything that's in you and just
[54:04] offering yourself to him
[54:08] there's not a thing about you he doesn't
[54:10] know
[54:14] and he's not against you he's for you
[54:18] [Music]
[54:21] you may be ashamed to stand in his
[54:23] presence
[54:27] but his love will take that shame away
[54:31] because he'd be so glad to hear from you
[54:36] and to see you
[54:39] it's just whole heart's desire to be
[54:41] reconciled with you
[54:44] and for you to come closer
[54:47] to him
[54:49] so this morning as we pray
[54:52] would you turn your heart to him and

[56:15] we can't even

[56:21] so as the song says this morning Father
[56:24] listen to our hearts
[56:27] we don't have words we don't have life
[56:29] we don't have action
[56:32] we love down deep on the inside we love
[56:36] you Lord
[56:38] and we love you because you first loved
[56:41] us
[56:42] and we thank you this morning and ask
[56:45] you to bless us
[56:47] be with us this morning Father may we
[56:49] walk from here strong Christians this
[56:52] morning in Jesus preciousness
[56:56] holy name we pray
[56:58] amen God bless you thank you musicians
[57:02] each one of you God bless you
[57:06] we certainly uh would like to turn in
[57:09] our vitals this morning
[57:11] to the First with the gospel of Saint
[57:16] John
[57:17] chapter 1
[57:20] and um
[57:21] so it's great to see each one of you out
[57:24] in the house of the Lord I know it looks
[57:26] like a bomb went off outside
[57:29] but um
[57:33] where we've started and so there's a lot
[57:36] of
[57:37] empty ditches and a lot of dirt so we
[57:42] certainly asked the parents to watch
[57:44] their children we've tried to put fences
[57:47] up and and believe it or not that fence
[57:50] is for you
[57:52] it's not for the other person it's for
[57:55] you not to go past
[57:57] in Normandy people see a little opening
[58:00] and they think well I'll go through
[58:01] there because that's for everybody else
[58:04] no it's for everybody else but me
[58:09] I'm the only person that can fall in the
[58:11] ditch
[58:12] okay nobody else can fall into ditch but
[58:15] me so you leave the ditch to me please
[58:19] and so be be careful out there and they
[58:24] what happened was is we had a big storm
[58:26] as you know and all the pipes floated
[58:29] out of the ditch and they wanted to come
[58:32] this morning and dig and get all the
[58:35] ditches ready and I thought well
[58:38] I thought maybe I should have them come
[58:42] and then tell them no and invite him
[58:44] into church
[58:47] but we didn't do it I hope you enjoy the
[58:50] word this morning
[58:52] it's it's in my heart I I don't know
[58:55] exactly how to bring it out to you we're
[58:59] going to play 10 minutes of a portion of
[59:02] a sermon and we're going to build on it
[59:05] but let us read these scriptures here
[59:10] my
[59:11] subject this morning or if I had a title
[59:14] it would be called maturing to reality
[59:19] maturing to reality
[59:22] and it says
[59:24] um
[59:25] so let us read this and let's think on
[59:27] it just a moment
[59:28] in the beginning
[59:30] was the word
[59:33] so that's the original isn't it in the
[59:37] beginning was the word
[59:40] and the Word was with God
[59:43] and the Word was God
[59:47] so we know the word was an expression of
[59:50] himself
[59:51] the same was in the beginning with God
[59:57] all things were made by him
[1:00:03] and without him
[1:00:06] was not anything made that was made
[1:00:12] he made all things there's nothing made
[1:00:15] that wasn't made from him
[1:00:18] he is the source of all life
[1:00:23] in him
[1:00:25] was life
[1:00:28] and the life was the light of men
[1:00:33] and the light shine shineth in darkness
[1:00:37] and the Darkness comprehendeth it not
[1:00:41] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[1:00:44] word to us in your precious name we pray
[1:00:47] amen God bless you this morning
[1:01:00] um
[1:01:02] you know this this scripture
[1:01:06] uh
[1:01:07] is
[1:01:09] a great thing because
[1:01:13] everything that a man needs is
[1:01:15] encompassed in the word of God
[1:01:19] when you look at the word of God it it
[1:01:22] it's given for instruction
[1:01:25] for reproof
[1:01:27] it's given for in teaching and so it
[1:01:32] within it is all the framework of what
[1:01:35] God has for us so the word gives us
[1:01:39] warning instruction part of instruction
[1:01:41] is warning
[1:01:43] yeah I if you ever read a instruction
[1:01:46] label I know you sisters do us men
[1:01:49] haven't learned that yet you know we
[1:01:52] look at the pictures and then we
[1:01:54] perceive it in our mind and then we go
[1:01:56] about it and if it don't come together
[1:01:59] right it's the manufacturers fault it's
[1:02:03] not ours or we have the great gift of
[1:02:06] modification
[1:02:08] we'll just drill a hole right or we'll
[1:02:11] bend it or we'll we'll get it to work
[1:02:14] the way we think it should work
[1:02:17] but yet the word of God is like
[1:02:20] instruction it tells you how to do it
[1:02:24] the right way and the word of God also
[1:02:27] has a lot of warnings and like you said
[1:02:30] when you read a warning label it it'll
[1:02:33] it'll warn you to put on glasses it'll
[1:02:35] warn you to have ventilation it'll have
[1:02:38] all these warnings there because these
[1:02:41] are the things that will harm you if you
[1:02:45] don't take heed to them
[1:02:47] and there's a couple of great warnings
[1:02:50] in the Scripture it said that in the
[1:02:53] last days perilous times shall come
[1:02:58] that's a warning and that men would no
[1:03:03] longer wish to retain God in their
[1:03:06] thinking
[1:03:08] they no longer want to consider things
[1:03:10] the way God considers them
[1:03:13] so it said that that in the last days
[1:03:16] perilous times shall come
[1:03:19] men should be lovers of pleasure more
[1:03:23] than lovers of God
[1:03:24] and
[1:03:26] that this reprobation would come
[1:03:31] from man pursuing that and no longer
[1:03:35] wishing to keep God in their knowledge
[1:03:39] what follows is reprobation and perilous
[1:03:43] times that's the word of God
[1:03:46] and you're never going to change the
[1:03:49] word of God it'll always come to pass
[1:03:51] exactly the way that God's word says it
[1:03:55] and so also the scripture tells us that
[1:03:59] Satan should appear as an angel of Light
[1:04:03] that he is so caught up in his own folly
[1:04:08] that he would appear as an angel of
[1:04:11] Light and deceive many
[1:04:13] in fact he would deceive the very elect
[1:04:17] if possible
[1:04:19] so that's how great this deception is
[1:04:23] that if it if it would deceive you then
[1:04:27] you have to understand that you're going
[1:04:30] to have to battle with that deception
[1:04:33] that you are not free from it you
[1:04:36] understand what I'm saying the very
[1:04:38] truth of the scripture says it would try
[1:04:42] to deceive the very elect if possible so
[1:04:46] the elect has got to realize this angel
[1:04:49] of Light is going to appear to them and
[1:04:54] try to deceive them and in the midst of
[1:04:57] this deception the world around them is
[1:05:02] no longer wishing to retain God in their
[1:05:05] knowledge
[1:05:06] so yeah you it it sets up a a setting
[1:05:12] for an extreme isolation for the
[1:05:16] believer
[1:05:17] the world has left God
[1:05:19] they don't retain them in their
[1:05:21] knowledge they're they're there's
[1:05:24] perilous times they're doing destructive
[1:05:27] things oh I I love the statement that
[1:05:31] somebody sent me and it's out of uh
[1:05:35] birth pains and the prophet of God talks
[1:05:39] about science and how that man will
[1:05:42] destroy themself he says God doesn't
[1:05:44] destroy man man takes their wisdom and
[1:05:48] their knowledge and destroys themselves
[1:05:52] and and and so and this angel of Light
[1:05:56] that's appearing and deceiving they all
[1:05:59] feel like they're they're going for uh
[1:06:03] that they're in some pursuit of
[1:06:06] something that's wonderful and and they
[1:06:09] they don't uh realize that once again
[1:06:13] the scripture warns us that they'll say
[1:06:17] peace and safety
[1:06:19] and sudden destruction will quickly come
[1:06:23] so get just that man it gets into a
[1:06:27] sense where where and it throws Us in
[1:06:32] such a battle because Satan is
[1:06:35] continually uh trying to deceive us and
[1:06:39] and we had a wonderful example of that
[1:06:42] in the message the other day that we
[1:06:44] listened to where the prophet of God
[1:06:46] said I was driving along and all of a
[1:06:48] sudden Satan came into the car
[1:06:52] now you know I'm nowhere near a prophet
[1:06:55] but I I experienced that one time in my
[1:06:59] life I was in Montana and I was driving
[1:07:03] in my truck and and all of a sudden I
[1:07:06] felt like somebody was sitting
[1:07:09] in the truck next to me
[1:07:13] and it was a weird feeling you know like
[1:07:16] all of a sudden I was carrying on the
[1:07:19] prophet of God Satan who is speaking to
[1:07:22] my conscience
[1:07:24] you know what I'm saying and and he said
[1:07:28] what if
[1:07:30] what if
[1:07:32] and
[1:07:33] you know and I I have a saying I keep it
[1:07:36] all the time in my heart and ifs but and
[1:07:41] wise are all Satan's lies
[1:07:46] amen anytime you hear well if or but or
[1:07:52] and you know those are all the things
[1:07:54] that Satan told Eve
[1:07:57] no you won't do that if you eat this
[1:08:00] you'll be this and he'll do this and and
[1:08:04] so you just can't listen but the prophet
[1:08:07] God said that he came in there and he
[1:08:09] said Jesus you know
[1:08:12] Jesus he said you know Jesus was just a
[1:08:15] great man
[1:08:17] he didn't deny him he said Jesus was
[1:08:20] just a great man
[1:08:22] and you know he was just like Oral
[1:08:24] Roberts and Billy Graham
[1:08:27] just great men and he he gained in
[1:08:31] popularity and and popularity and all of
[1:08:35] a sudden everybody got the calling him a
[1:08:38] god
[1:08:39] and so it just went on like that from
[1:08:43] there and here we are today uh calling
[1:08:47] him God and he was just a a great man
[1:08:52] and
[1:08:53] what a deception
[1:08:57] that appearing as an angel of Light uh
[1:09:02] uh trying to tempt you and
[1:09:05] and break you down because we know that
[1:09:09] the battle is in the mind
[1:09:13] and so that that's the Battleground that
[1:09:16] Satan chose to fight now God didn't
[1:09:20] choose that ground
[1:09:22] the enemy chose that ground
[1:09:24] because God doesn't have to fight
[1:09:30] you understand God don't have to fight
[1:09:32] for nothing in the beginning was the
[1:09:34] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:09:37] word God and all things that were made
[1:09:40] at this this is this is such a great
[1:09:43] scripture all things were made by him
[1:09:47] and without him was not anything made
[1:09:51] that was made that's the sovereignty of
[1:09:55] God the rulership of God that's what
[1:09:59] makes him God there's nothing that made
[1:10:01] was made that he didn't make so if you
[1:10:04] don't have to defend himself
[1:10:07] he doesn't have to prove himself it's
[1:10:09] the enemy that appears as an angel of
[1:10:14] Light
[1:10:15] so with that great understanding that
[1:10:18] the word of God tells us things that we
[1:10:22] need to be mindful of we need to
[1:10:24] understand the day that we're living in
[1:10:26] we need to understand the spirits that
[1:10:29] we're battling and job said life is a
[1:10:33] constant Warfare and you can't get
[1:10:35] lulled to sleep you can't think that
[1:10:38] there's nothing at stake you can't think
[1:10:41] oh all's well you've got a the way that
[1:10:45] you know that all things well is that
[1:10:48] you put a Watchman on the tower and he
[1:10:52] watches and then you can and the
[1:10:54] Watchman Cries Out Watchmen what of the
[1:10:57] night
[1:10:59] what's been what are the might what do
[1:11:01] you hear what do you see what was the
[1:11:04] Watchman therefore the Watchman was
[1:11:07] there that the city would be called to
[1:11:11] arms and to be a prep for battle
[1:11:17] and in the book of Nehemiah I love the
[1:11:19] book of Nehemiah I love that book so
[1:11:21] much that I that we're building out here
[1:11:25] and I thought I'm just going to go back
[1:11:26] and do another teaching on the book of
[1:11:28] Nehemiah just for my own personal self
[1:11:32] I'm selfish you know
[1:11:35] well the scripture says to love your
[1:11:38] brother as you love yourself
[1:11:43] we need a real selfie
[1:11:45] not this fake selfie out here
[1:11:49] but we need a real selfie the real love
[1:11:51] of God shed abroad in our heart
[1:11:55] by the spirit of God but the the enemy
[1:12:01] those that were opposed to Israel
[1:12:04] they were they heard rumor that they
[1:12:07] were going to attack at night
[1:12:09] and so what they did is they gathered
[1:12:11] all the people from that were all
[1:12:13] outside the city they were all working
[1:12:15] how many knows the book of Nehemiah
[1:12:18] go back and start reading that book that
[1:12:21] book will set you on fire
[1:12:24] amen you'll all show up at church with a
[1:12:27] hammer and a nail
[1:12:28] you you know you wanna you'll have a
[1:12:31] mind of work you want to do something
[1:12:33] for God you know what I mean it just
[1:12:35] fires your soul up in there well so
[1:12:39] though they they put watches out
[1:12:42] Eric and the scripture says that that
[1:12:45] they they cut the people in half and
[1:12:49] half of them worked and the other half
[1:12:51] held two Spears one for themselves and
[1:12:54] one for the person that was working
[1:12:57] and that's their word and everybody that
[1:13:00] was working had one hand to the work and
[1:13:04] one hand on their sword in other words
[1:13:06] they all had their sword uh strapped so
[1:13:09] they were ready for battle
[1:13:12] ready for battle and and you cannot in
[1:13:18] this hour get long to sleep you must be
[1:13:22] ready for battle the enemy is not going
[1:13:25] to sit back he is not going to let you
[1:13:28] obtain what God wants you to obtain he's
[1:13:31] going to try to keep you from every
[1:13:33] promise he's going to try to fight you
[1:13:36] every step of the way he's like a
[1:13:38] roaring lion going about seeking whom he
[1:13:41] made to devour if he can keep you from
[1:13:44] missing your appointment
[1:13:47] he'll do everything he can
[1:13:50] and don't sit back and say well if I'm
[1:13:53] predestinated uh I will um
[1:13:57] you know I'll make it and if I'm not I
[1:14:00] won't that's not exactly the way that it
[1:14:03] works
[1:14:04] you know that's called Grace to disgrace
[1:14:08] the scripture also says you reap what
[1:14:10] you sow and he said some will obtain the
[1:14:14] award the their reward and others will
[1:14:18] retain it through fire
[1:14:22] oh yeah you might not you might not miss
[1:14:25] your reward
[1:14:27] that you might have to get it through
[1:14:29] fire I don't want to get it through fire
[1:14:32] I'd rather take the weight provided huh
[1:14:34] and then the then the permissive will so
[1:14:38] I I don't want to go God's permissive
[1:14:40] will some lazy life and some life
[1:14:43] without much very much God in it and no
[1:14:46] spiritual and no praying and touching
[1:14:49] and getting alone with God and getting
[1:14:51] in the spirit and seeking what the will
[1:14:54] of God is for my life and being on fire
[1:14:57] for God and just live some lukewarm life
[1:15:00] say well I'll get i'll get uh I'm
[1:15:03] predestinated so I'll be there okay I'll
[1:15:06] grant you that
[1:15:08] you know what I mean
[1:15:10] but I wouldn't want to take the
[1:15:14] consequences
[1:15:16] of that route because God's just
[1:15:20] and he couldn't take a man that
[1:15:22] dedicated his life and sacrificed for
[1:15:25] the kingdom of God and take him and
[1:15:28] reward him
[1:15:30] and then let you come in on some
[1:15:32] scapegoat a way of life he'll let you
[1:15:36] come in if you're predestinated but
[1:15:38] you'll also reap
[1:15:40] what you sow
[1:15:42] so as we approach this this morning I
[1:15:45] hope that in the next a little bit
[1:15:49] that as we go through this this morning
[1:15:53] that you will take it with sincerity
[1:15:58] sincerity what it is the Lord is
[1:16:03] Desiring uh
[1:16:06] for you
[1:16:07] and again our subject is maturity to
[1:16:11] reality
[1:16:12] we're going to play 10 minutes this
[1:16:15] morning
[1:16:16] of a section of the message
[1:16:20] and that's the one that we played
[1:16:22] Wednesday night we did have trouble with
[1:16:25] our internet Wednesday night uh
[1:16:28] uh we do everything we can to try to get
[1:16:32] people not to cut our wires but they
[1:16:36] just figure some way that they see those
[1:16:38] wires and they think oh I think I'll cut
[1:16:40] these
[1:16:42] but so we're going to listen from
[1:16:44] paragraph uh
[1:16:47] uh
[1:16:48] two
[1:16:50] 202
[1:16:53] I know some of you have phones if you
[1:16:55] had turned uh all your outside calls and
[1:16:59] noise off
[1:17:01] and if you want to get it on your phone
[1:17:03] and read it I know they'll put it on the
[1:17:05] boards here and we're going to listen
[1:17:07] through over to the end of 2 30.
[1:17:13] and that that's about 10 minutes I I
[1:17:17] know that this 10 minutes in here is my
[1:17:20] son Matthew some of his favorite uh
[1:17:24] portions of the message because he
[1:17:27] quotes them to me all the time so I
[1:17:31] think he has this memorized so he
[1:17:33] probably can uh just we could probably
[1:17:36] just have him up here and tell us but I
[1:17:39] want you to listen for just 10 minutes
[1:17:42] closely
[1:17:44] to what he's being said and what is it
[1:17:48] that he's trying to get across to us now
[1:17:53] remember
[1:17:55] only my sheep hear my voice
[1:17:58] and another they won't follow
[1:18:01] so because this is for his elected
[1:18:06] now I I can't understand how a man can
[1:18:10] stand there discern the thoughts of the
[1:18:12] tents of the heart
[1:18:14] have people that will testify that he
[1:18:16] praised prayed for them and through his
[1:18:19] ministry and his love they were raised
[1:18:22] from the dead demons cast out of all
[1:18:28] signs and manners of signs and wonders
[1:18:31] people coming by the thousands Jonesboro
[1:18:34] Arkansas the population of Jonesboro
[1:18:37] Arkansas I think quadrupled in one
[1:18:41] meeting they were camped everywhere the
[1:18:44] works and wonders that were done were
[1:18:49] beyond the imagination the story of the
[1:18:53] little girl that was blind and she was
[1:18:56] looking for her daddy
[1:18:58] and she bumped into brother Brandon who
[1:19:01] arranged that
[1:19:03] Hallelujah
[1:19:04] you know and she was going blindly all
[1:19:08] of a sudden grabbed him and and he she
[1:19:11] said mister
[1:19:13] can you get me in to see the Gila
[1:19:18] oh
[1:19:20] my goodness
[1:19:22] he said why he said I've lost my daddy
[1:19:26] well why don't you want me to take you
[1:19:28] to your daddy well if you take me to the
[1:19:31] Healer I'll find my daddy on my own
[1:19:37] he said well you know something
[1:19:42] I'm the guy
[1:19:45] you know
[1:19:47] I'm the one
[1:19:49] that's how he is you just might bump
[1:19:51] into him this morning
[1:19:54] and and that's the wonderful part about
[1:19:57] him
[1:19:59] he puts himself
[1:20:01] in your pathway
[1:20:03] that you can
[1:20:05] touch him for what you have need of
[1:20:09] so we're going to listen to this this
[1:20:11] morning just for 10 minutes and then
[1:20:14] we'll try to keep it as short as we can
[1:20:17] on the other side of this but I think
[1:20:21] this it will help you understand
[1:20:25] what motivated me
[1:20:28] and has caused this desire within the
[1:20:33] framework in my heart that I want to
[1:20:37] share with you today so thank you
[1:20:40] brother Mike and God bless you brother
[1:20:42] Steve it's good to see you man and uh
[1:20:44] each one this morning
[1:20:47] may you enjoy just 10 minutes so try to
[1:20:50] be attentive as you can for those that
[1:20:54] uh

[1:20:59] interpreters will be able to do the best
[1:21:01] they can if you can pull it up on your
[1:21:04] phone in Spanish or French or whatever
[1:21:07] language you have I don't know if it's

[1:21:16] but God bless you just listen this
[1:21:20] morning for just 10 minutes thank you
[1:21:25] the one that we played Wednesday night
[1:21:31] thank you
[1:21:34] how many knows what we played Wednesday
[1:21:36] night
[1:21:37] the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:21:40] Christ thank you
[1:32:00] if that don't like
[1:32:04] I don't even know how to preach after
[1:32:06] that
[1:32:10] but so
[1:32:13] what I want to in my heart uh
[1:32:20] share with you when I talk about
[1:32:24] um this
[1:32:26] great uh subject this morning maturing
[1:32:31] to
[1:32:32] reality
[1:32:34] maturing to
[1:32:36] reality
[1:32:39] and we know just by the little bit that
[1:32:43] we listen to and I'm sure that you
[1:32:46] understood it
[1:32:47] we know that
[1:32:49] Eve being a type of the bride and God
[1:32:52] always referring to his church as
[1:32:58] a female or a wife or a woman
[1:33:02] we know that in the beginning well the
[1:33:06] prophet of God said Adam was one being
[1:33:09] but he couldn't
[1:33:12] um
[1:33:12] but Adam couldn't fall
[1:33:15] because God couldn't create
[1:33:18] anything like that
[1:33:20] so he separated the two
[1:33:24] to be a part
[1:33:26] and in separating those two now that
[1:33:32] part of Adam that could be uh deceived
[1:33:36] as he said he knew that she would do it
[1:33:40] else she wouldn't have been God
[1:33:44] but he said he did that because that he
[1:33:47] wanted he had attributes and I'll read
[1:33:51] that statement again in its paragraph
[1:33:54] 211 if you did want to put it up Mike it
[1:33:58] said
[1:33:59] but see the attribute that's in God had
[1:34:04] to be displayed
[1:34:08] now that's what he said the attributes
[1:34:10] that were in God had to be displayed
[1:34:14] well why did they have to be displayed
[1:34:18] because that was one of his threefold
[1:34:21] purpose was to make himself known
[1:34:24] and there was parts of God that man
[1:34:28] would have never known that he was If
[1:34:31] God Was A Healer you would have never
[1:34:34] known that God was a Healer until you
[1:34:37] were sick somebody had to get sick in
[1:34:40] order for God to heal him
[1:34:42] someone had to be lost in order for God
[1:34:45] to to find them
[1:34:48] and so he had these attributes to
[1:34:52] displayed so he knew that Eve would fall
[1:34:55] and give him the opportunity to display
[1:34:58] these attributes but as we read down
[1:35:01] here he says but you see the attribute
[1:35:04] that is in God had to be displayed he
[1:35:08] was a savior
[1:35:10] and to make everything perfect the way
[1:35:13] he had it then there could be nothing
[1:35:18] lost
[1:35:19] so the way he had it
[1:35:22] there could be nothing lost so he had to
[1:35:25] allow that little drop
[1:35:29] remember that little thing in time that
[1:35:33] we're in this little space of time that
[1:35:37] you were in but you are not of this
[1:35:40] world nor are you from this world you
[1:35:44] are from another kingdom
[1:35:47] you have another father beyond your
[1:35:51] Earthly father
[1:35:53] I I hope that can start to set in so you
[1:35:57] can I can express it to you in my heart
[1:36:00] and then he makes this statement he said
[1:36:03] in that state nothing could be lost he
[1:36:06] said oh don't be
[1:36:10] children
[1:36:13] be man in woman
[1:36:15] another word he's talking about a
[1:36:20] maturity
[1:36:22] don't be immature don't be uh don't be
[1:36:27] children and and so we we see there that
[1:36:32] he made a call out to the church
[1:36:36] to mature
[1:36:39] the whole message that we hear that our
[1:36:44] message brought to us over and over
[1:36:47] again he talks about the seed going into
[1:36:49] the ground about it coming up coming
[1:36:52] through all these different stages and
[1:36:54] what was it heading to it was heading to
[1:36:57] maturity Harvest time he talks about the
[1:37:00] time it comes that the seed comes to to
[1:37:03] maturity and and so in in getting us to
[1:37:08] bring us to this maturity he he's got to
[1:37:12] bring us to an understanding in other
[1:37:15] words a mature person
[1:37:18] understands things that a child can when
[1:37:22] I was a child I thought as a child
[1:37:26] right but when I matured and I became
[1:37:29] adult I began to think like an adult
[1:37:32] and so now he's approaching our immature
[1:37:36] thinking
[1:37:38] are immature actions the way that we're
[1:37:43] acting the way that we're thinking the
[1:37:45] things that we do are expressing and
[1:37:49] showing her lack of maturity
[1:37:53] now okay you you know some of you I
[1:37:57] think are being gifted with teenagers
[1:38:01] some of us already received that gift
[1:38:04] and from that day we've longed for them
[1:38:07] to mature
[1:38:10] but you know the the thing of it is if
[1:38:13] is that they they they they don't want
[1:38:17] you telling them what to do that they
[1:38:20] want you to to trust them because they
[1:38:23] want you to think they know better
[1:38:27] and the reality of it is they don't
[1:38:31] they're in the shore
[1:38:35] they're they're not capable of making
[1:38:38] right decisions because they're not
[1:38:41] capable of fighting off the influences
[1:38:45] that come to attack them in their weak
[1:38:49] places the desire to be accepted the
[1:38:52] desire to know where they stand with the
[1:38:55] people that around them
[1:38:57] in trying to find their identity to try
[1:39:00] to find out where they stand where that
[1:39:03] they fit in what their future holds for
[1:39:06] them all these battles and things that
[1:39:09] they're questing out in their life and
[1:39:12] may I say this something to the parents
[1:39:14] don't leave your kids abandoned out
[1:39:17] there to fight that by themselves
[1:39:20] talk to him about it pray with them read
[1:39:24] the scriptures let them know that you
[1:39:26] know what you're going through and that
[1:39:28] you've been through it yourself
[1:39:32] don't take nothing for granted
[1:39:38] don't let all the little young boys and
[1:39:40] girls go down the hall
[1:39:43] and all play in the room while you all
[1:39:45] sit around fellowshipping
[1:39:49] don't let them children because remember
[1:39:52] they don't have a born-again nature till
[1:39:55] they're born again
[1:39:58] they're still part of the First Union
[1:40:01] the first husband that had rule over
[1:40:05] them and what was the first husband that
[1:40:09] had rule over you was the nature that
[1:40:13] you're born with you came into the world
[1:40:16] what
[1:40:18] speaking lies
[1:40:22] why because you got the nature of the
[1:40:26] liar
[1:40:30] that's the nature you're born with
[1:40:33] because the way that you came you came
[1:40:36] through sin
[1:40:38] is that right through a natural union he
[1:40:42] said you got here not the way God wanted
[1:40:45] here but grow up
[1:40:47] he said
[1:40:49] be mature understand that I'm the way
[1:40:53] that I am because I was born in sin
[1:40:57] shaped in iniquity came in the world it
[1:40:59] didn't matter how Godly my parents were
[1:41:02] I know people in here that Godly Parents
[1:41:07] but they couldn't help it
[1:41:10] right because they had to come to a a
[1:41:14] birth
[1:41:17] they had that nature had to die
[1:41:20] and they had to be reunited
[1:41:24] with their original nature the one that
[1:41:28] God had from him in the beginning
[1:41:31] they had to be reunited with that
[1:41:34] and kind of and so he's he's he he's
[1:41:38] trying to tell us in this little
[1:41:42] a section that you've got to mature
[1:41:47] you you've got to mature and we're
[1:41:49] talking about maturing to reality
[1:41:54] and so what is reality it says though
[1:41:59] it's the state of things as they
[1:42:02] actually exist
[1:42:07] the actual fact
[1:42:10] that's what reality is
[1:42:13] it's the actual fact
[1:42:16] the actual fact was
[1:42:19] the day that you eat of this tree that
[1:42:23] day you'll die
[1:42:26] so
[1:42:27] a lie came
[1:42:30] right and what a lie is it's a
[1:42:33] perception
[1:42:36] so we're talking about maturing to
[1:42:41] reality or maturing to the state of
[1:42:46] things as they actually exist or as they
[1:42:50] actually are
[1:42:53] so if you're not living in a reality
[1:42:55] you're living in a perception
[1:43:01] is what you perceive
[1:43:07] that's only if you're maturing from
[1:43:09] reality to reality
[1:43:12] so if you're maturing from what that you
[1:43:15] perceive
[1:43:16] and the perceptions that you have
[1:43:22] to what is actually the fact
[1:43:28] and that's a big gap
[1:43:31] because what is perception perception is
[1:43:35] the ability to see hear and become aware
[1:43:39] of things through the census
[1:43:46] oh
[1:43:48] my
[1:43:50] to be able to perceive
[1:43:53] and become aware of things
[1:43:56] through the senses
[1:43:58] that is a perception
[1:44:03] what do you think this great thing
[1:44:06] everybody trying to get you to perceive
[1:44:09] it
[1:44:10] see it become aware of it and understand
[1:44:15] it from their Viewpoint or their angle
[1:44:20] they try they try it that's what sales
[1:44:23] is it's trying to change your perception
[1:44:30] get you to see it different way
[1:44:32] understand it a different way
[1:44:36] so the the
[1:44:39] perception
[1:44:41] through this census
[1:44:43] is not reality
[1:44:47] now take this impersonal today
[1:44:51] because a lot of it is the way that
[1:44:53] you're perceiving yourself
[1:44:58] how that you look at yourself
[1:45:01] what your perceptions are in the mirror
[1:45:07] oh mirror mirror on the wall who's the
[1:45:10] fairest of them all
[1:45:12] well don't answer that question because
[1:45:14] you'll come up with yourself every time
[1:45:16] and that's a perception
[1:45:23] it's what you've become aware of
[1:45:29] through your senses
[1:45:33] it becomes to you
[1:45:35] your perception becomes your reality you
[1:45:40] believe that things are the way that
[1:45:43] they are because of how you perceive
[1:45:46] them that is a lie that is a deception
[1:45:50] that is from the father of Lies
[1:45:55] there's only one reality
[1:45:59] and that's God's word
[1:46:04] that's the only thing that's actually
[1:46:08] the way that it is
[1:46:11] because everything that was made was
[1:46:14] made by him and without him nothing was
[1:46:17] made that was made that's reality
[1:46:22] that's the facts
[1:46:24] the way they really are
[1:46:28] if it's not the word
[1:46:31] it's not real
[1:46:35] it's a what
[1:46:38] it's a perception
[1:46:41] look it's a
[1:46:44] it is something that you become aware of
[1:46:49] through the census
[1:46:53] God doesn't deal in those realms
[1:46:56] how does God deal
[1:46:59] not by perception but by revelation
[1:47:04] that's how that's how God does it he
[1:47:08] doesn't he reveals to you only one thing
[1:47:14] and that's what
[1:47:16] his word
[1:47:18] because that's reality
[1:47:22] so to mature
[1:47:27] means to
[1:47:30] grow to your finished product
[1:47:38] to come to what that you really are
[1:47:43] not a perception
[1:47:46] of what you think you are
[1:47:50] there was two people in the temple
[1:47:54] worshiping
[1:47:55] one was sitting there oh God
[1:47:59] I've given my arms to you
[1:48:03] I've served you Lord oh Jehovah
[1:48:08] you know all that I have I bestowed up
[1:48:12] for you father I fed the pure
[1:48:15] fed the poor and I I've done these great
[1:48:19] works for you o God hear me Lord bless
[1:48:24] me
[1:48:28] that guy was living in perception
[1:48:34] he got all his information
[1:48:39] from someplace other
[1:48:41] than reality
[1:48:45] which was the word
[1:48:47] there's another fella in the back
[1:48:50] he's going oh God I'm a sinner
[1:48:56] I don't deserve to be here
[1:48:58] I was born in sin shaped in iniquity I
[1:49:02] came in the world speaking lies
[1:49:05] Lord I have all kinds of my own thoughts
[1:49:08] and I have all kinds of my own works and
[1:49:11] and I I haven't given myself over to you
[1:49:15] a hundred percent Lord
[1:49:17] I'm still battling all kinds of things
[1:49:20] in my flesh have mercy on me oh God
[1:49:23] which one was in reality
[1:49:29] one's living in perception
[1:49:36] but One's Gonna
[1:49:38] but and one was
[1:49:40] living in reality
[1:49:44] believe it or not if those two people
[1:49:47] the one in the back
[1:49:50] who didn't even feel worthy to go to the
[1:49:53] front
[1:49:56] was the one that was mature
[1:50:03] the other one was so immature
[1:50:07] that no doubt he probably ended up being
[1:50:11] one of the money changers
[1:50:13] in the courtyard
[1:50:17] that's deception
[1:50:22] so we find that
[1:50:26] perception
[1:50:28] comes through the senses
[1:50:32] it comes through what you see
[1:50:36] what you think
[1:50:38] what you remember
[1:50:40] what your Consciousness is
[1:50:43] all those things develop into a
[1:50:47] perception
[1:50:49] if you're living by perception you're
[1:50:53] living in a false reality
[1:50:57] you're not living the way that the word
[1:51:03] says it is no way that it actually is
[1:51:07] you're not living in a life the way that
[1:51:10] it actually is you're seeing all kinds
[1:51:13] of things from the Viewpoint of
[1:51:16] deception and have no idea really what
[1:51:20] God's word says about it
[1:51:23] when you look at a person
[1:51:27] we call it first impression foreign
[1:51:32] that's what we we call it first
[1:51:35] impression or in other words first
[1:51:39] perception
[1:51:41] what does the person perceive about you
[1:51:45] the first time that you see them
[1:51:51] if you would have meant me
[1:51:54] you would have perceived a hippie
[1:51:58] you're going to perceived the drug
[1:51:59] addict
[1:52:03] you either perceived the one that sought
[1:52:06] after pleasure
[1:52:07] that hated Authority didn't want to be
[1:52:11] subject to nothing did his own thing
[1:52:16] your perception
[1:52:19] may have been true to the senses
[1:52:22] but it was a reality
[1:52:27] the reality that wasn't me
[1:52:33] even though it was perceived
[1:52:36] even though there was evidence
[1:52:39] of the census
[1:52:42] I see the long hair did I smell the
[1:52:45] drugs I hear these words
[1:52:49] everything that just proves to me beyond
[1:52:53] a shadow of a doubt it's a hippie
[1:52:56] but the word of God said I was a Son of
[1:52:59] God
[1:53:00] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:53:03] the world
[1:53:08] and what ruled over was perception
[1:53:12] what ruled over me
[1:53:15] was the perception of myself
[1:53:20] I thought I was cool
[1:53:23] I thought I was hip
[1:53:26] I knew the right people
[1:53:28] I knew rock and roll band people
[1:53:34] I knew the animals and kind of the birds
[1:53:39] wrong Garden
[1:53:45] you know I knew Steppenwolf
[1:53:50] wrong Garden
[1:53:54] oh I perceived you know
[1:53:57] I I had it going on
[1:54:05] perception
[1:54:09] she might sit there but you've got all
[1:54:12] kinds of perceptions
[1:54:14] we've got perceptions of one another we
[1:54:17] got perceptions of the church we've got
[1:54:20] perceptions of the ministry we've got
[1:54:23] perceptions of revivals we got
[1:54:25] perceptions of where we think God's
[1:54:27] moving and where he's not moving car
[1:54:31] absolutely living
[1:54:34] under all kinds of different perceptions
[1:54:40] can the truth of it is is that we need
[1:54:45] to mature to reality
[1:54:50] maturing to reality
[1:54:54] another if you're mature to reality
[1:54:58] you've got to mature to what the word
[1:55:02] really says about you
[1:55:10] regardless of your perception
[1:55:15] and so now our messenger just takes a
[1:55:18] little bit of time it says the reason
[1:55:20] that you're perceiving yourself
[1:55:24] the way that you do
[1:55:27] and you look at yourself the way you
[1:55:30] look at yourself is because of that
[1:55:34] nature you got
[1:55:38] when you were born into the world
[1:55:47] that's what the mirror says
[1:55:51] I'm really not a Christian
[1:55:53] I'm really not born again
[1:55:56] I'm really not an overcomer
[1:56:00] and there's I'm really haven't been
[1:56:02] Justified
[1:56:04] it's because I remember it
[1:56:07] he remembers it
[1:56:13] that's not what the word said
[1:56:17] I don't care
[1:56:19] what's your perception of yourself is
[1:56:24] I don't care what your senses are
[1:56:27] telling you
[1:56:31] I don't care what you're aware of
[1:56:36] I don't care how much evidence
[1:56:40] you have to prove
[1:56:44] that your perception is real
[1:56:50] it's not real unless it's the word
[1:56:59] reality is the word
[1:57:04] spoken word was the original seed
[1:57:08] everything that was sowed after that was
[1:57:12] a perception
[1:57:16] and in our own lives
[1:57:19] we get a perception of ourselves as a
[1:57:22] loser
[1:57:25] we get a perception of ourselves or it's
[1:57:29] fed to us
[1:57:35] little girls
[1:57:38] I know for a fact
[1:57:41] I've seen it myself I've got phone calls
[1:57:44] on it
[1:57:46] people have written me about it ask me
[1:57:49] about it
[1:57:51] not just once
[1:57:53] several times
[1:57:55] my little girl how how old is she she's
[1:57:59] 11.
[1:58:01] she thinks that she's gay
[1:58:09] no
[1:58:11] that's how bad
[1:58:13] the perception is
[1:58:17] if we get caught up in perception
[1:58:21] if we get caught up in determining life
[1:58:25] by our senses
[1:58:28] if if we've determined Life by the
[1:58:32] perilous times that we're living
[1:58:35] if we determine Life by Satan which
[1:58:38] appears as an angel of Light we are not
[1:58:42] living in the reality of God's word
[1:58:45] God's word said that we're more than
[1:58:48] conquerors God said word says that we're
[1:58:51] more than Victorious God's word says
[1:58:54] that we'll defeat Satan on every place
[1:58:56] every time every situation every
[1:59:00] circumstance God's word said he's the
[1:59:02] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:59:05] change is not
[1:59:08] I don't care what dress that Satan
[1:59:12] appears in
[1:59:16] the world's a mockery of itself
[1:59:22] I thought of the poor woman's movement
[1:59:28] of this
[1:59:30] time
[1:59:32] through history
[1:59:35] the scripture says that woman's the
[1:59:38] weaker vessel
[1:59:42] that's reality
[1:59:46] and just because I perceive themselves
[1:59:49] as being equal
[1:59:52] doesn't mean they're equal
[1:59:55] it's nothing wrong with that
[1:59:57] it's the perception that that's bad
[2:00:05] it's the perception she can make it on
[2:00:08] her own
[2:00:09] when the word of God said she couldn't
[2:00:11] make it on her own
[2:00:14] it's the same perception a man has when
[2:00:17] he thinks he can make it on his own
[2:00:19] without a husband we can't make it
[2:00:22] without him
[2:00:24] we are made to be sheep we are made to
[2:00:28] be followers the woman was a type of the
[2:00:30] church as husband and wife
[2:00:34] when they get into this thing well I'm
[2:00:37] equal and I can do the job just as good
[2:00:39] as as man can if if I have the same
[2:00:43] abilities he does and I can join the
[2:00:46] Army and I can fly a jet and I can do
[2:00:49] this can I can do that
[2:00:52] and they perceive themselves
[2:00:57] to be something that they're not
[2:01:01] and they've lived in that perception to
[2:01:04] Defying the reality of God's word which
[2:01:08] would bestow upon them blessings
[2:01:13] and life
[2:01:15] far beyond any life this false
[2:01:18] possession is going to give them
[2:01:21] so they finally come down to the time
[2:01:24] they're going to pick a woman of the
[2:01:26] year
[2:01:30] and you know what they pick
[2:01:33] a man that claims to be a woman once
[2:01:36] again a man can be a better woman than a
[2:01:39] woman can be a woman
[2:01:44] I'm telling you
[2:01:47] if you don't get out of your perceptions
[2:01:50] you will deceive yourself
[2:01:58] you can't live in perception you've got
[2:02:01] to live in the reality of God's word
[2:02:04] you've got to mature
[2:02:08] to reality
[2:02:10] the whole seed from the beginning
[2:02:13] through the church has went from one
[2:02:16] perception why what happened to Luther
[2:02:20] and the lutherans
[2:02:21] why did they denominate
[2:02:24] because they perceived they had it
[2:02:31] they perceived all they needed was
[2:02:34] justification
[2:02:37] they perceived that's all the farther
[2:02:40] they had to go my sins are forgiven
[2:02:48] and they stopped
[2:02:53] perception stops you from maturing
[2:02:59] it stops you from growing
[2:03:02] into what you can possibly be
[2:03:05] you say are you preaching in us no I'm
[2:03:07] preaching it myself this morning because
[2:03:09] I realized
[2:03:12] that it was my perception of the message
[2:03:15] that I thought that had reached the top
[2:03:20] I thought alls I needed was
[2:03:23] what I read
[2:03:27] and what I perceived
[2:03:31] I I finally got the understanding of it
[2:03:35] and then I began to see that he he's
[2:03:39] trying to tell us something
[2:03:43] and when he's always been preaching was
[2:03:45] you've got to mature
[2:03:47] you've got to mature
[2:03:51] that you've got to grow to something
[2:03:54] so what is he what is he trying to tell
[2:03:57] us here what is he trying to get us to
[2:04:00] grow into
[2:04:01] and and he begins and explains all about
[2:04:04] why that we the way we are the nature
[2:04:06] that we have why the way that we are why
[2:04:09] is he doing that because he's trying to
[2:04:12] wipe that perception out of your
[2:04:16] thinking
[2:04:22] then he tells you
[2:04:24] he justified you in other words you
[2:04:27] never did it in the first place well you
[2:04:32] know you did it
[2:04:37] your perception tells you did it
[2:04:43] you've got the memories
[2:04:47] that you did it
[2:04:50] you have the perception of your senses
[2:04:54] but the reality is
[2:04:57] you never did it
[2:05:01] not here
[2:05:03] because here isn't the first place
[2:05:12] here isn't the first place
[2:05:16] you've got to mature out of the
[2:05:19] perception and out of the awareness that
[2:05:23] you have of what you see from your
[2:05:26] senses that's why faith is the Sixth
[2:05:29] Sense
[2:05:33] Faith isn't governed by perception
[2:05:38] it's not governed by the false reality
[2:05:44] of the senses
[2:05:47] it's governed by one thing only
[2:05:50] God said so
[2:05:52] the father of our faith Abraham had to
[2:05:57] deny
[2:05:59] his perception
[2:06:04] Sarah
[2:06:09] she perceived it
[2:06:12] she said that dude's crazy
[2:06:16] me and my Lord
[2:06:18] together again
[2:06:20] I'm I'm 90 he's 100 or 80 or whatever
[2:06:24] they were
[2:06:30] but Abraham
[2:06:32] 's reality
[2:06:34] was based in one thing
[2:06:37] that God that promised it
[2:06:40] was able to perform it
[2:06:43] he had to move mature
[2:06:48] to reality
[2:06:52] God is trying to get this bride
[2:06:57] and this church
[2:06:59] and this end time message was given to
[2:07:04] mature
[2:07:06] this church
[2:07:08] into the reality
[2:07:10] of God's word another where you become
[2:07:14] to the place that what God Said is
[2:07:18] actually the fact
[2:07:21] it's actually the way that things are
[2:07:25] not your mind not your thoughts not what
[2:07:29] the scale says not what the mirror says
[2:07:32] I don't care what anything says I'm the
[2:07:34] best looking Son of God God could made
[2:07:37] because this is the way he made me
[2:07:40] Hallelujah
[2:07:47] there's nobody else thinks I'm gorgeous
[2:07:49] there's two people that think I'm
[2:07:51] gorgeous me and my wife
[2:07:56] it's the only two that matter
[2:07:59] him and you
[2:08:04] we think that we're there because we
[2:08:07] perceive we're there
[2:08:08] we think we have the Revelation because
[2:08:11] we perceive we have the Revelation lean
[2:08:14] not to your own understanding
[2:08:18] a whole message we don't lean to your
[2:08:21] perceptions don't lean to your
[2:08:23] understanding mature past it hear the
[2:08:26] word of God pray for Revelation there's
[2:08:29] only one way to receive reality and
[2:08:32] that's by divine revelation
[2:08:39] you've got to deny yourself
[2:08:43] so he goes on he begins to explain these
[2:08:45] beautiful things he talked about how
[2:08:48] it's not your fault
[2:08:53] Hallelujah
[2:08:55] it's not my fault I live the way I lived
[2:08:58] it's not my fault I did the things I did
[2:09:01] it's not your fault
[2:09:06] that's the nature you got
[2:09:11] but the reality is
[2:09:16] the reality is
[2:09:18] there was a German life in me
[2:09:22] but what did that life have to do it had
[2:09:25] to grow it had to mature it had to grow
[2:09:29] until it became in its full maturity it
[2:09:34] had to mature to what reality
[2:09:39] I had to mature
[2:09:41] to the place
[2:09:43] that I can look at myself and say it's
[2:09:47] not my fault
[2:09:50] who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:09:54] God's elect because the what seed of God
[2:09:59] remaineth in them I've got to mature to
[2:10:03] the reality that I know that that seed
[2:10:06] of God's in me because the word said so
[2:10:10] and if he said so that's the reality
[2:10:15] and the messenger came
[2:10:18] only to the elect
[2:10:20] only to those that had ear to hear to
[2:10:23] say the seed was in you before the
[2:10:26] foundation of the beginning of the world
[2:10:31] that's quite a statement
[2:10:34] but you realize you got to mature to
[2:10:36] that
[2:10:39] you've got to get rid of all the Mind
[2:10:41] battles
[2:10:44] you've got to say Amen if you do
[2:10:48] something you repent of it your sins go
[2:10:51] before you to be remembered no more
[2:10:57] you've got to mature
[2:11:00] to that reality he he says don't be
[2:11:04] children he said you had this verse but
[2:11:07] you have to be a good paragraph to 2 213
[2:11:11] he says you have to be reunited again
[2:11:15] with another nature
[2:11:21] how am I going to be reunited with that
[2:11:24] other nature
[2:11:25] what's God's plan how did he lay it out
[2:11:28] in the scripture
[2:11:30] it came through justification it came to
[2:11:33] through sanctification
[2:11:36] it came through the being reborn
[2:11:40] not the restoration of the gifts
[2:11:43] the new birth
[2:11:48] which is what Jesus Christ in you
[2:11:51] how did you get there you died to that
[2:11:54] old nature you said I don't want this to
[2:11:57] have rule over me I don't want to be the
[2:12:00] way that I am I don't want to think this
[2:12:02] way I don't want to be weak I don't want
[2:12:05] to keep stumbling I hate this thing that
[2:12:07] so easily besets Me and You Begin to cry
[2:12:10] Abba Father
[2:12:14] if you've been to mature
[2:12:18] and you matured and you begin to mature
[2:12:21] why because the life
[2:12:24] is working its way through all the
[2:12:27] perceptions so it could come into
[2:12:29] maturity why because he became you
[2:12:34] that you might become
[2:12:37] him
[2:12:38] it isn't that what he goes
[2:12:41] on to say he goes on to say here and
[2:12:45] he's starting to talk and he's coming
[2:12:48] about the bride and he's talking how
[2:12:51] your name wasn't there and you got rid
[2:12:53] of your natural desire and that that
[2:12:57] that was Babylon and you were
[2:12:59] impregnated with the wrong thing but he
[2:13:02] came to pay that price
[2:13:09] now we say these things all the time
[2:13:13] but it's evident
[2:13:16] by our conversation
[2:13:19] by our actions
[2:13:21] by the things that so easily be sent us
[2:13:25] that we haven't matured to that reality
[2:13:36] you plant a seed you walk out there and
[2:13:39] you say there's my Field of Corn
[2:13:42] because you know in that seed
[2:13:46] is every ability for that seed to
[2:13:50] transform and be mature
[2:13:54] but it's got to go through the maturity
[2:13:57] process
[2:14:00] and every denomination
[2:14:03] every person's they stop the maturity
[2:14:07] process because they already perceived
[2:14:10] that they're mature
[2:14:15] Paul said you're yet children not being
[2:14:17] able to discern between Good and Evil
[2:14:20] we can't tell a false Revival from a
[2:14:22] word Revival
[2:14:28] is maturing
[2:14:31] now I'm I don't care about the rest of
[2:14:34] the world I don't if I could do away
[2:14:36] with the internet I'd do away with it
[2:14:39] today
[2:14:41] you know but it's other people that want
[2:14:43] it not me
[2:14:44] I only want to preach to the people that
[2:14:46] are in this room
[2:14:48] in the back too
[2:14:51] or if you're out in the car
[2:14:53] I don't want a worldwide Ministry
[2:14:57] I want to be faithful to the to
[2:15:00] those of you who have made the decision
[2:15:03] to sit and fellowship
[2:15:06] around God's word here
[2:15:10] but we need to mature
[2:15:14] to reality
[2:15:17] and we need to get rid of the false
[2:15:19] realities
[2:15:22] one of the greatest things brother
[2:15:23] Branham taught
[2:15:25] was the perception of symptoms
[2:15:34] what is perception
[2:15:37] the ability
[2:15:39] to see
[2:15:40] hear and become aware
[2:15:43] of something through the senses
[2:15:46] my arm hurts
[2:15:50] my headaches
[2:15:52] I'm sick
[2:15:54] the doctor says I'm sick the doctor says
[2:15:58] I have that the doctor says I have that
[2:16:01] all those things I can become aware of
[2:16:04] they're telling me they're true
[2:16:11] don't tell me they're not true I feel it
[2:16:14] prophet of God says you got a bad case
[2:16:17] of symptoms
[2:16:22] what's reality
[2:16:28] reality is by your stripes
[2:16:33] I'm Healed
[2:16:35] now you think you've got that
[2:16:39] no you don't
[2:16:44] we're fooling ourselves
[2:16:49] we've got a mature
[2:16:51] to that reality
[2:16:53] we've got to mature then we can look at
[2:16:56] those things that are
[2:16:59] and look at them as they are not
[2:17:03] because God's word said different
[2:17:06] that's maturing to reality that is not
[2:17:12] something that just you make up in your
[2:17:15] mind
[2:17:16] you've got to mature your life to it
[2:17:18] you've got to keep my Commandments he
[2:17:21] said
[2:17:22] if you keep my Commandments ask the
[2:17:25] father in my name anyway you can't take
[2:17:28] the keeping Commandments out of it and
[2:17:31] take the other part and call it faith
[2:17:35] that's not reality
[2:17:39] that's perception
[2:17:43] we got a whole lot of perception going
[2:17:45] on because we don't even sit down and
[2:17:47] get in front of the presence of the Lord
[2:17:49] and say Lord rid me of my perceptions
[2:17:52] I'm full of them I got more perceptions
[2:17:55] than all of you I've had 73 years to get
[2:17:58] them
[2:17:59] I don't know if there's anybody in here
[2:18:01] older than I am
[2:18:07] ah what are you here one month or two
[2:18:11] older than I am huh
[2:18:14] thank you brother James I was looking
[2:18:16] for something to bail me out
[2:18:20] perception
[2:18:24] it's a curse
[2:18:27] it's the curse that Eve got
[2:18:31] because she perceived
[2:18:33] what Satan was telling her
[2:18:36] was truth
[2:18:41] when the reality was
[2:18:44] the word
[2:18:46] he goes on he tells us he said you've
[2:18:49] got to be reunited again with another
[2:18:52] nature
[2:18:53] now
[2:18:58] let me ask you I just I'm here for you
[2:19:00] this morning
[2:19:01] because when when I leave this pulp but
[2:19:05] that Devil's gonna be in the seat of my
[2:19:08] truck
[2:19:10] and he's going to bring everything I've
[2:19:12] ever done and everything I've ever said
[2:19:17] and I only have one weapon to fight him
[2:19:19] with
[2:19:22] and the word of God said maybe I'll fail
[2:19:25] myself
[2:19:26] but I have not failed to declare unto
[2:19:29] them the truth of the Gospel
[2:19:36] you've got to mature
[2:19:39] you've got the hunger
[2:19:42] have you asked in your heart
[2:19:45] do you understand that the word says
[2:19:47] you're battling this nature you're
[2:19:50] battling The Temptations of your flesh
[2:19:53] you're battling your senses but the word
[2:19:56] of God says there's another nature for
[2:19:59] you to be United with have you ever sat
[2:20:02] down instead of fighting your
[2:20:06] perceptions and battling yourself and
[2:20:09] trying to get yourself in order falling
[2:20:11] down saying oh God I'll never do it
[2:20:13] again why am I this way
[2:20:16] and say wait a minute
[2:20:19] the reality of God's word says that
[2:20:22] there's another nature that I can have
[2:20:29] I don't perceive that nature
[2:20:35] but he said it's there
[2:20:38] Lord make that nature
[2:20:43] real
[2:20:47] I pray father
[2:20:50] because his flesh Wars against the
[2:20:52] spirit
[2:20:53] and Lord I'm caught in this battle but
[2:20:56] your word says reality says I have
[2:20:59] another nature and I can die to this
[2:21:02] fella
[2:21:06] let me mature
[2:21:10] to that reality
[2:21:13] let the word of God mature me
[2:21:17] let me hear it take it bite by bite word
[2:21:21] by word let it build my faith because I
[2:21:25] want to mature to that reality where I
[2:21:27] say if God said I have another nature I
[2:21:30] have another nature
[2:21:33] it's thus saith the Lord and I'm going
[2:21:36] to mature
[2:21:38] till I come to that perfection
[2:21:42] he goes on to say
[2:21:44] the bride knows where she's at
[2:21:47] very few and then he makes this
[2:21:50] statement in paragraph 221
[2:21:54] but remember
[2:21:57] when it went down
[2:22:00] and the grain begin to ripen
[2:22:04] you find before the grain can ripen
[2:22:06] everything in the stock
[2:22:09] has to be dead
[2:22:11] Hallelujah can't you see where we're
[2:22:14] standing life is in the grain again
[2:22:20] what is it
[2:22:23] what is it that we're maturing to
[2:22:27] remember we read all those things
[2:22:29] earlier that if you don't know where
[2:22:31] you're going you can't get burned again
[2:22:33] unless you know what it does for you
[2:22:37] what does it mean to be borned again
[2:22:40] it means the old nature dies
[2:22:44] and the word nature the word comes into
[2:22:48] you what what is the new birth it's
[2:22:52] Jesus Christ revealed to you personally
[2:22:54] what is the holy spirit it's Jesus
[2:22:58] Christ Living in you
[2:23:07] Prophet God said don't give me the
[2:23:09] shouting
[2:23:11] that's all that's good
[2:23:13] but don't shout no higher than you live
[2:23:17] he said don't judge it by that heathens
[2:23:19] do all the same thing how do you judge
[2:23:21] your life because you've matured
[2:23:24] into the reality of the word
[2:23:28] you live by the word you think the word
[2:23:32] the word is way it is the word is
[2:23:35] reality I don't care what everything
[2:23:37] says I don't care what my symptoms says
[2:23:40] the reality of it is though it's
[2:23:42] manifested I don't care I'm not judging
[2:23:45] it by the census I'm judging it I've
[2:23:48] matured to the place that if he says buy
[2:23:50] my stripes by his stripes I am healed I
[2:23:53] am healed
[2:23:58] I I don't care what the perception is
[2:24:01] prophet of God said he sat there and
[2:24:04] he'd eat a bite and he'd spit it up he'd
[2:24:07] take another bite he'd spend it out he'd
[2:24:10] take another bite he's faded on he said
[2:24:12] by his stripes I am healed
[2:24:17] never failed
[2:24:19] to walk in that reality
[2:24:22] though he suffered
[2:24:25] but one day
[2:24:26] he saw that little squirrel
[2:24:29] jump up and get stuck
[2:24:32] on that thorn and he lifted his hands
[2:24:36] and said on the wings of a snow white
[2:24:38] dove
[2:24:42] I've seen my Deliverance
[2:24:44] I've seen my healing
[2:24:46] so he goes on he just says it up close
[2:24:49] this morning
[2:24:50] you find before the grain can ripen
[2:24:52] everything else has to die Hallelujah
[2:24:54] can you see where yours where we're
[2:24:57] standing life is in the grain again what
[2:25:00] is it just exactly like the same grain
[2:25:04] that went into the ground the same Jesus
[2:25:09] in Bride formed
[2:25:12] same power
[2:25:19] same church
[2:25:21] same thing
[2:25:23] same word
[2:25:28] in Bride form
[2:25:30] what am I maturing to
[2:25:33] do I see that in my perception no
[2:25:37] but the word said
[2:25:43] that I'm going to be
[2:25:45] him
[2:25:47] and he's going to be in me the bride
[2:25:50] form
[2:25:51] that the word and the bride become one
[2:25:56] as he is
[2:25:58] so am I in this world that's the reality
[2:26:03] of the word now I've got to mature
[2:26:07] into that reality and the only way I'm
[2:26:10] going to mature to that reality is not
[2:26:13] looking at what I was but looking at
[2:26:16] what I'm going to be and denying every
[2:26:20] perception and put the vision of the
[2:26:23] well man in front of me and walk into it
[2:26:29] start looking at myself as a Christian
[2:26:32] start acting like a Christian start
[2:26:35] acting like he said start thinking like
[2:26:37] he said let this mind be in you that was
[2:26:40] in him
[2:26:42] we kind of mature to that
[2:26:45] it isn't going to fall out of the sky in
[2:26:48] the form of an anointing
[2:26:53] and then all of a sudden you say oh I've
[2:26:55] got it Hallelujah
[2:27:00] The Works that I do
[2:27:02] shall you do also
[2:27:08] start defeating them in your own
[2:27:10] sickness
[2:27:11] then you'll defeat them in others
[2:27:16] get the victory in your life
[2:27:18] and then you can get the victory in
[2:27:20] others
[2:27:24] I don't want to walk through that gate
[2:27:27] by myself
[2:27:31] I want to share
[2:27:34] that's what he did
[2:27:36] that's what he wanted
[2:27:39] again that's what he says
[2:27:42] and then he goes on to say he says
[2:27:48] he says
[2:27:50] you're the in Bride form same power same
[2:27:52] church the same word sucked through
[2:27:55] through these others and come up here
[2:27:57] come into the head here and all the life
[2:28:02] that come through here picked up its
[2:28:05] people now it's forming like into the
[2:28:07] head for a Rapture Hallelujah and then
[2:28:11] he says what is it he said you separated
[2:28:14] from your first Union by spiritual death
[2:28:19] have you done that
[2:28:23] have you finally told that guy he's a
[2:28:26] liar
[2:28:28] he's not what he says you are
[2:28:31] and the perception he's trying to sell
[2:28:33] you
[2:28:34] of yourself
[2:28:37] is not what the word of God says about
[2:28:39] you
[2:28:45] he said well you're a hothead well let
[2:28:47] me tell you something he threw that in
[2:28:49] the sea of God forgetfulness
[2:28:51] I'm going to overcome that I'm going to
[2:28:54] mature
[2:28:56] why because there's a seed in me
[2:29:00] and that seed in me has the power within
[2:29:04] itself
[2:29:05] to transform me in to what God
[2:29:09] said I would be we've got to mature
[2:29:13] out of our perceptions
[2:29:15] to the reality of What God Says
[2:29:18] if he says you separate First Union by
[2:29:21] Death
[2:29:21] now you're born again
[2:29:23] or remarried again
[2:29:26] to the new spiritual union of not your
[2:29:30] natural life of the things of the world
[2:29:34] but of eternal life The Germ that was in
[2:29:39] you at the beginning
[2:29:41] found you
[2:29:44] you found the seed
[2:29:48] now that seed's got to mature
[2:29:51] how does it mature it denies every
[2:29:55] perception it denies every reasoning it
[2:29:59] denies everything that that it says
[2:30:02] everything that's thrown in front of you
[2:30:05] everything that that comes about you
[2:30:08] even if everything that you've ever done
[2:30:11] can you accept one thing the reality
[2:30:19] of God's word
[2:30:21] that said that seed found me
[2:30:24] I don't care what you think about
[2:30:26] yourself
[2:30:29] because that's not real
[2:30:32] what's real is what he said whether you
[2:30:35] accept it or not whether you feel it or
[2:30:38] not or whether you see it or not what he
[2:30:41] said is truth what he said is the only
[2:30:45] reality is the only thing will last
[2:30:48] Heaven and Earth will pass away that
[2:30:50] perceptions will pass away but my word
[2:30:53] will not pass away
[2:30:57] forget yourself
[2:31:04] I'm tired of you
[2:31:06] Give Me Jesus
[2:31:11] right
[2:31:12] I'm not looking at you the way you look
[2:31:14] at yourselves
[2:31:16] we'd all be insane
[2:31:19] I'm looking at you the way that he sees
[2:31:21] you
[2:31:23] are redeemed son and daughter of God
[2:31:27] that's going to mature into the full
[2:31:30] statue of the love of God what is the
[2:31:33] Capstone
[2:31:36] herein is the love of God made known
[2:31:40] herein is the Capstone made known herein
[2:31:44] is how we know the Capstone has United
[2:31:47] with the bride as he is
[2:31:52] so are we in this world
[2:31:59] is that a reality to you
[2:32:03] or would you say I need to mature here
[2:32:06] I gotta quit being a child
[2:32:09] I've got to start taking my position in
[2:32:12] Christ I've got to start claiming the
[2:32:14] promises
[2:32:15] I gotta quit trusting in my degree I've
[2:32:18] got to get rid of this idea I've got to
[2:32:20] finish school before I can have a family
[2:32:24] I've got to get this rid of this idea
[2:32:26] I've got to pair pay my for my parents I
[2:32:28] got to get rid of this false idea that I
[2:32:31] got to pay for my wife
[2:32:34] oh
[2:32:35] just kills me
[2:32:42] perception is garbage
[2:32:48] the word is truth
[2:32:50] father Thy word is truth
[2:32:54] that's we pray father may they be one as
[2:32:58] We Are One
[2:33:02] the maturing to reality then he he goes
[2:33:06] on it's he says the the he's separating
[2:33:10] he said the germ of life that was in you
[2:33:12] found it he says
[2:33:15] he said Your name's now but now you're a
[2:33:17] new bride what's he saying he's telling
[2:33:20] all these things and then he comes down
[2:33:24] it wasn't he said
[2:33:26] you was accused
[2:33:28] but you never done it in the first place
[2:33:31] the old Union is in the sea of God from
[2:33:34] forgive forgetfulness you wasn't married
[2:33:37] to it to begin with
[2:33:42] he the bridegroom Warrior shame himself
[2:33:46] for you
[2:33:48] for you in your place he took your place
[2:33:52] for you were predestinated for him to be
[2:33:57] in his bride before the foundation of
[2:34:00] the world the Bible said so you are
[2:34:04] predestinated seed
[2:34:09] how did you come to do this
[2:34:12] you were deceived into it by your first
[2:34:16] marriage
[2:34:18] to your adulterous parent Eve it's no
[2:34:23] fault of your own
[2:34:33] oh
[2:34:35] to mature to that
[2:34:38] yes I did that
[2:34:40] yes I did that
[2:34:46] but you made me Satan
[2:34:50] it's no fault of my own you tricked me
[2:34:54] because you got my mother
[2:34:58] to pass on
[2:35:00] a different nature to me
[2:35:03] then I was really supposed to have
[2:35:06] and I've lived under that nature long
[2:35:08] enough
[2:35:10] but now I heard reality
[2:35:13] now I heard reality and the reality was
[2:35:17] that I'm not that person
[2:35:19] that's not my fault I was deceived into
[2:35:23] it lying preachers lying churches lying
[2:35:27] spirits that Satan that appeared as an
[2:35:30] angel of Light
[2:35:33] that would deceive the very elect
[2:35:36] if possible
[2:35:39] this is reality
[2:35:43] it's no fault of your own
[2:35:46] by your natural birth
[2:35:49] you come after Eve who committed
[2:35:52] adultery that's the reason you was born
[2:35:56] an adulteress
[2:35:59] you're a sinner to begin with that's
[2:36:02] right you were deceived into it
[2:36:06] no
[2:36:08] you it ain't your fault
[2:36:12] you never did it
[2:36:16] how come you never did it
[2:36:21] because that little germ
[2:36:23] that was in you was to be you
[2:36:28] before the foundation of the world and
[2:36:32] put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:36:35] that little germ that was in you was to
[2:36:39] be you
[2:36:40] now I've got to mature
[2:36:46] into what
[2:36:50] that I was to be
[2:36:53] and I'm not David McGeary fighting this
[2:36:56] stinking flesh every day of my life
[2:37:02] I've got to
[2:37:05] surrender
[2:37:08] I've got to accept the fact
[2:37:13] I've got to accept my election
[2:37:16] I've got to call it the way the word
[2:37:19] says it
[2:37:20] I've got to live by God's word I've got
[2:37:23] to mature not to Sensations not to
[2:37:28] everything but I've got to mature to the
[2:37:30] place that it's Christ in me
[2:37:33] is my hope of glory if the same spirit
[2:37:37] that was in him
[2:37:40] dwells in me it'll Quicken my own mortal
[2:37:44] body I've got to mature
[2:37:49] out of my perceptions of religion
[2:37:53] out of my perceptions of worship out of
[2:37:57] all the things that man is coming up
[2:38:00] with
[2:38:01] and I've got to set this for me exactly
[2:38:04] what that he promised
[2:38:08] he promised that the I could be like him
[2:38:13] we always want the big works
[2:38:17] well how much little Works do you think
[2:38:19] he did
[2:38:20] every day in his life
[2:38:23] how many people do you think he pulled
[2:38:25] aside in the alley and talked to him
[2:38:29] and they got life
[2:38:32] how many
[2:38:34] people do you think he put his hand on
[2:38:36] and said go and sin no more
[2:38:41] he was a radiant
[2:38:43] Beauty
[2:38:44] of love
[2:38:45] shining in the lives of everybody he
[2:38:48] came in contact with
[2:38:51] don't you think we can mature to that
[2:38:55] Satan says you won't
[2:38:57] God says we will
[2:39:01] Satan says you've got too much flesh God
[2:39:04] said I threw it in the sea of God's
[2:39:05] forgetfulness
[2:39:07] Satan says I'm going to stop you
[2:39:11] nothing can stop God's word to come to
[2:39:14] pass
[2:39:15] Church don't be discouraged
[2:39:22] it's a day of rejoicing
[2:39:25] it's a day of rejoicing
[2:39:28] because we know that through the word of
[2:39:32] God we can mature
[2:39:35] out of our present condition
[2:39:38] and come into the full reality of Christ
[2:39:42] in us the hope of glory and I want to
[2:39:45] close with this this morning if I could
[2:39:48] just find it here
[2:39:51] I thought it was so
[2:39:53] beautiful how did he close this message
[2:39:58] with this request so where do I stand
[2:40:01] this morning
[2:40:02] I stand
[2:40:04] and I have to come to the realization
[2:40:06] that this body and this flesh and this
[2:40:11] nature is not my fault
[2:40:14] I didn't choose this
[2:40:17] I got it
[2:40:21] but I come to another reality
[2:40:24] that while I was yet a sinner
[2:40:26] he died for it
[2:40:30] and I realized something else as
[2:40:33] prodigal as I am
[2:40:35] the Good Shepherd
[2:40:37] leaves the 99.
[2:40:39] and finds the lost sheep
[2:40:42] and there's more rejoicing in heaven in
[2:40:45] him coming home
[2:40:47] I've got to realize that all these
[2:40:50] things in my mind all these things I'm
[2:40:53] thinking all these things that I'm
[2:40:55] seeing are not real
[2:40:57] they're just perception
[2:41:00] but I've got to mature to the reality of
[2:41:04] God's word that he took them all and
[2:41:08] threw him in the sea of God's
[2:41:09] forgetfulness
[2:41:11] and I've got to come to the place that
[2:41:13] what all
[2:41:14] things
[2:41:16] are possible
[2:41:19] all things
[2:41:22] how many things
[2:41:23] all things are possible
[2:41:27] I've got to come to the maturity if I
[2:41:30] ask anything in my father's name
[2:41:33] Hill granted
[2:41:35] I want to mature
[2:41:38] I don't want to stop here
[2:41:46] I want to get pulled from the shock
[2:41:49] into the full pure grain word
[2:41:52] and the prophet of God closed with this
[2:41:54] this morning I hope you took my words
[2:41:56] this morning as encouragement
[2:41:59] and if I'm shaking you a little bit this
[2:42:01] morning I'm not shaking you I'm shaking
[2:42:03] myself
[2:42:06] because time to
[2:42:08] see the greenness
[2:42:11] go out of the church and us to mature to
[2:42:15] real men and women yeah I don't care you
[2:42:17] can be 13 12 years old and be a real
[2:42:21] mature Christian
[2:42:24] Lord I'm asking the bride tonight
[2:42:29] the ones that feel
[2:42:32] has pulled away
[2:42:34] and waiting
[2:42:36] paragraph 340.
[2:42:40] and waiting may they separate themselves
[2:42:45] from everything in the world
[2:42:48] they must lay in the presence of the
[2:42:53] warm sunlight
[2:42:55] of the Son of God bathing in his word
[2:43:01] in his love
[2:43:03] granted
[2:43:05] Dear God
[2:43:07] what does the grain do in the Sun
[2:43:10] it matures
[2:43:12] into what it's to be in the first place
[2:43:17] what direction are we going in what are
[2:43:20] you trying to teach us where are you
[2:43:22] taking us pastor
[2:43:24] everything that I've been preaching and
[2:43:27] trying to tell you
[2:43:28] is that there's a maturity
[2:43:33] that we're going to mature into have we
[2:43:36] got there I don't know will we get there
[2:43:40] yes
[2:43:43] yes a prophet told us we would
[2:43:47] and that's thus saith the Lord to me
[2:43:52] do I need to lay in the Sun and ripen
[2:43:55] his word to mature yes
[2:44:00] am I doing it I need to do it more
[2:44:05] is the love of God shed abroad in my
[2:44:08] heart
[2:44:10] so my heart
[2:44:12] looks upon the needs of others though I
[2:44:16] speak with tongues of men and angels
[2:44:18] though I prophesy
[2:44:21] and have not charity
[2:44:23] it profiteth me nothing
[2:44:27] do I have room to mature
[2:44:31] I hope so
[2:44:33] I hope this isn't
[2:44:36] all that I can be
[2:44:39] Lord help me mature
[2:44:41] let me mature from perception to reality
[2:44:46] let me mature to the reality of your
[2:44:51] word because your word is reality

[2:45:00] Importance of Being Born Again
