[18:40] amen god bless you invite brother mike
[18:43] for our songwriting this morning amen
[18:45] god bless you
[19:06] good morning
[19:09] you know one of the
[19:11] things that
[19:13] technology has given us these days is
[19:16] the ability to
[19:19] communicate with anyone
[19:21] uh all over the world
[19:24] you know using nothing more than
[19:27] a little device
[19:28] in your pocket
[19:30] and just
[19:31] swipe of your finger
[19:34] you can
[19:35] call
[19:36] video text message tweet post
[19:40] to anyone
[19:42] and everyone
[19:43] all over the world
[19:46] anytime you want to communicate an idea
[19:48] to someone
[19:50] just a couple of tips of the finger and
[19:54] you can get that thought across
[19:56] and get that thought expressed
[20:00] but you know it occurred to me this week
[20:02] just as was dealing with some stuff at
[20:04] work that in this age where we have
[20:08] more communication
[20:10] technology available to us than ever
[20:12] before
[20:14] there's less real communication going on
[20:17] with people
[20:19] than ever before
[20:22] seems like
[20:23] you know no more often than not no
[20:26] matter how eloquent you are with your
[20:28] words
[20:29] how well written that email is
[20:31] what you try to convey in a text
[20:35] somebody is going to misunderstand
[20:37] your words
[20:39] no matter how eloquent it is they'll
[20:41] misunderstand it they'll misinterpret it
[20:43] they'll be confused by it they might get
[20:45] frustrated by it or angry about with all
[20:48] that technology and all that ability to
[20:50] communicate
[20:52] and express
[20:53] a thought
[20:54] no matter how well you use words
[20:57] somebody still
[20:59] misunderstands
[21:02] you know it's uh
[21:04] also interesting that
[21:07] brother david gave the example wednesday
[21:09] night about how
[21:10] you'll say something to one person
[21:14] and by the time it's gotten eight nine
[21:16] ten people down the line
[21:19] what they're saying
[21:21] is nothing like what you said
[21:24] and it seems like the further you get
[21:26] away from the person
[21:29] who's speaking the thought
[21:32] the less you're aligned with what the
[21:34] words really mean
[21:37] you know i got to thinking about that we
[21:42] you know there's a limit to what words
[21:45] alone
[21:46] can express
[21:50] there's only so much you can get of
[21:52] someone's thought
[21:54] with words
[21:57] the best way
[21:59] to truly
[22:01] understand what a person is trying to
[22:03] express
[22:04] with their words
[22:06] is to know the person
[22:11] you know not studying their words
[22:14] and their statements
[22:16] so
[22:17] deeply that you can understand every
[22:20] aspect of what it is
[22:22] that they're trying to say
[22:24] no matter how well you study their words
[22:27] you're not gonna get it right
[22:30] if you don't know the person speaking
[22:35] the only way
[22:38] in fact the best way
[22:40] to know what a person is saying with the
[22:43] words that they're speaking
[22:44] is to know that person so well
[22:48] that you know what they're going to say
[22:50] before they say it
[22:53] that okay it's
[22:56] if you were stuck in a situation boy i
[22:58] know what so-and-so would say if they
[23:00] were here
[23:01] or i know how they would respond
[23:04] if they were here
[23:06] you can't do that by studying someone's
[23:08] words and memorizing their words there's
[23:10] a point where
[23:12] your relationship with that person gets
[23:14] to such a place
[23:16] that you know what they're going to say
[23:18] even before
[23:20] they say it
[23:23] you know just as a
[23:24] word
[23:26] is a thought expressed
[23:28] a thought
[23:30] is a person
[23:32] expressed
[23:35] you know there was a time
[23:37] brother branham was questioned
[23:40] about how well he knew the scriptures
[23:43] compared to some of the other
[23:45] preachers of his day
[23:47] and he made this statement he said i
[23:49] don't know too much about the word
[23:52] the book
[23:54] i just know the author real well
[23:57] the one who wrote it
[24:00] you know so there's a difference between
[24:03] knowing
[24:04] interpreting
[24:06] understanding
[24:08] someone's words
[24:12] and knowing the
[24:13] speaker well enough
[24:16] that no matter how poorly they might
[24:18] communicate
[24:20] you still know what they were saying
[24:25] because you know their ways
[24:28] therefore you know their words
[24:32] we're going to read psalm 119 again this
[24:34] morning we're going to pick up at verse
[24:35] 33 and it begins with this statement
[24:40] it says teach me
[24:42] o lord
[24:44] the way
[24:45] of thy statutes
[24:49] doesn't say teach me thy statutes
[24:52] it says teach me the way
[24:54] of thy statutes
[24:57] it says in verse 35 make me to go in the
[25:00] path
[25:01] of thy commandments
[25:04] for therein do i delight
[25:07] see there's a
[25:09] difference between it be between being
[25:12] intimately familiar with his
[25:14] commandments his statutes
[25:17] and knowing the way
[25:18] of his statutes and his commandments
[25:23] you know it's uh
[25:26] the difference is whether you know the
[25:28] words the statements the quotes or the
[25:30] person himself you know it says in first
[25:32] corinthians 13
[25:35] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[25:38] and understand all mysteries
[25:42] and all knowledge
[25:45] and though i have all faith
[25:47] revelation
[25:50] so that i could remove mountains
[25:53] and have not charity
[25:55] which requires a relationship
[25:58] i am nothing
[26:02] it says in psalm 119 36 incline
[26:06] my heart
[26:07] unto thy
[26:08] testimonies not my head
[26:11] not my
[26:13] understanding or my knowledge
[26:16] but my heart
[26:18] my desire my
[26:20] relationship
[26:23] what did jesus say matthew 7 he said
[26:26] this not every one
[26:28] that saith unto me lord lord shall enter
[26:31] into the kingdom of heaven
[26:34] those who know his words
[26:37] but he that doeth the will
[26:40] of the father which is in heaven not the
[26:43] words
[26:44] but the will
[26:45] the path
[26:47] the way
[26:49] the
[26:50] intent
[26:52] you know when jesus was on the earth the
[26:54] religious leaders of the day
[26:57] they knew his words
[26:59] perhaps better than any other people in
[27:01] the world
[27:02] they knew them intimately they spent
[27:04] their entire lives studying his words
[27:07] and his statements and his quotes
[27:10] but yet when i am the way came on the
[27:13] scene
[27:16] their authoritative understanding of the
[27:19] words
[27:21] caused them to miss him by a thousand
[27:23] miles
[27:26] said in john 8 43 why do ye not
[27:28] understand my speech
[27:31] even because you cannot hear my word
[27:35] matthew 15 8 this people draweth nia
[27:37] unto me with their mouth
[27:39] with their words
[27:42] and honoreth me with their lips
[27:44] but their heart is far from me see they
[27:47] have all the word
[27:49] but they missed the way
[27:52] you know we have a phrase in corporate
[27:54] america whenever
[27:55] trying to get a project done
[27:58] we finally arrive at a point where we're
[28:00] just going to be whatever work we do is
[28:03] directionally correct
[28:05] that's the phrase we use directionally
[28:07] correct
[28:09] and though we may not have figured out
[28:11] all the details
[28:13] we're headed in the right direction
[28:15] because we know the way
[28:17] that we're headed
[28:19] so therefore the words
[28:22] will find their place
[28:25] you know david's prayer in psalm 119 33
[28:28] is teach me the way
[28:31] of thy statutes
[28:34] his desire was not to necessarily know
[28:37] the words
[28:38] or the commandments or the statements
[28:42] but to know the person himself
[28:45] is the religious leaders of jesus day
[28:47] showed us you can know all the words
[28:49] and still not be in the way
[28:52] but you can be in the way even though
[28:53] you don't understand all the words
[28:58] knowing the author real well
[29:03] we may not know all the words but he
[29:05] know we know what he wants done
[29:08] with the word
[29:10] you know and my prayer this morning is
[29:13] that i would know his way
[29:16] and then
[29:18] i will know his word
[29:21] oh that i might know the way
[29:24] of his statutes
[29:26] let's just read that this morning that's
[29:28] what stuck out to me we'll just read
[29:29] those eight verses in verse 30 starting
[29:31] in verse 33
[29:33] says teach me o lord the way of thy
[29:36] statutes and i shall keep it unto the
[29:39] end give me understanding and i shall
[29:42] keep thy law yea i shall observe it with
[29:45] my whole heart
[29:46] make me to go in the path of thy
[29:48] commandments for therein do i delight
[29:51] incline my heart unto thy own
[29:53] testimonies and not to covetousness
[29:56] turn away mine eyes from beholding
[29:58] vanity and quicken thou me in thy way
[30:01] establish thy word unto thy servant who
[30:03] is devoted to thy fear
[30:05] turn away my reproach which i fear for
[30:08] thy judgments are good behold i have
[30:11] longed after thy precepts quicken me in
[30:14] thy righteousness amen
[30:20] amen god bless you may have your seats
[30:23] [Music]
[30:32] oh do you know what it is not to have
[30:36] one guilty feeling not to wander away

[31:04] pain you believe in what you heard

[59:29] this morning
[59:32] we ask you to bless us this morning
[59:34] touch each heart
[59:35] each need that's here
[59:38] this morning
[59:40] we commit ourselves to your hands this
[59:43] morning
[59:44] father that you would just anchor us in
[59:47] your word
[59:48] for we ask these things in jesus
[59:51] precious name we pray
[59:53] amen
[59:54] amen
[59:56] god bless you if you have your bibles
[59:57] let's read two scriptures this morning
[1:00:00] before we take our seats and
[1:00:05] trust that the lord will
[1:00:09] bless us
[1:00:11] so
[1:00:13] uh we wanted to go back and read again
[1:00:15] in corinthians
[1:00:18] um
[1:00:20] the second chapter of first corinthians
[1:00:23] and uh
[1:00:24] where we got our inspiration from
[1:00:27] on wednesday night service and we're
[1:00:29] just continuing in that
[1:00:31] thought
[1:00:33] process
[1:00:34] of the things that we started that we're
[1:00:37] trying to
[1:00:40] bring us to a greater
[1:00:43] walk a greater growth amen we want to
[1:00:45] move up
[1:00:47] right we we don't want to look at the
[1:00:49] fields that we already have
[1:00:52] and the yields of the fields we already
[1:00:55] have we want to plant new fields
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:59] amen so it says here it says
[1:01:03] in the ninth verse
[1:01:05] but as it is written i hath not seen
[1:01:09] nor ear heard
[1:01:11] neither have entered into the hearts of
[1:01:14] men
[1:01:15] the things which god hath prepared for
[1:01:19] them
[1:01:20] that love them do you love them this
[1:01:22] morning
[1:01:23] so that scripture tells me that god has
[1:01:26] something
[1:01:27] that's prepared for you
[1:01:30] but it hasn't entered into your heart
[1:01:32] yet
[1:01:34] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[1:01:37] his spirit
[1:01:39] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[1:01:43] the deep things of god
[1:01:46] so you believe the spirit's with us this
[1:01:48] morning i certainly felt his presence
[1:01:51] i can see that his presence certainly is
[1:01:53] on you
[1:01:54] so that tells me that that spirit is
[1:01:57] going to
[1:01:58] seek and search
[1:02:00] all things yea the deep things of god i
[1:02:04] want to go deeper in him don't you and
[1:02:07] then let's also turn over to one of my
[1:02:09] favorite
[1:02:13] scriptures
[1:02:15] this scripture just came to light to me
[1:02:17] one day and just anchored in my soul
[1:02:21] when i was
[1:02:22] fellowshipping with brother james hayes
[1:02:25] and
[1:02:26] and this scripture just came up and it
[1:02:28] was gripping to me it says it's the
[1:02:30] fourth uh chapter of the first john
[1:02:34] so the epistle of john 1 john 4 and 17.
[1:02:51] and we'll just read the 16th first as
[1:02:53] you're uh turning there
[1:02:55] okay in uh
[1:02:58] first john the
[1:02:59] the fourth chapter the 16th verse
[1:03:02] and we have known
[1:03:04] and believed
[1:03:06] the love that god hath
[1:03:09] to us
[1:03:12] god is love
[1:03:14] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:03:18] god
[1:03:19] and god in him
[1:03:24] herein is our love made perfect
[1:03:28] that we may have boldness
[1:03:31] in the day of judgment
[1:03:33] because he is
[1:03:36] as he is
[1:03:38] so
[1:03:39] are we
[1:03:41] in
[1:03:42] this world heavenly father bless us this
[1:03:45] morning your precious name we pray amen
[1:03:49] god bless you may be seated this morning
[1:03:55] it's
[1:03:56] certainly wonderful to be in the
[1:03:59] house of the lord this morning and we
[1:04:01] trust that
[1:04:02] each of us can take something with us
[1:04:04] that
[1:04:05] uh
[1:04:06] raises us up uh higher in the lord and
[1:04:09] and closer to him and
[1:04:12] and you know i don't want to lose
[1:04:15] contact with those that are in the uh
[1:04:20] the overflow back there this morning
[1:04:22] you're certainly a part of us our hearts
[1:04:24] are certainly with you and we're trying
[1:04:26] to do everything we can to get you
[1:04:29] all of us together in one spot
[1:04:32] i think that's going to be a glorious
[1:04:34] day don't you
[1:04:36] you know i believe the lord's moving
[1:04:38] i i he moves in a lot of different ways
[1:04:42] and he he does a lot of
[1:04:44] different things but
[1:04:47] i i love to feel the hand of the lord
[1:04:50] and i've seen the hand of the lord this
[1:04:53] week in several
[1:04:54] different ways and manners and
[1:04:57] and seeing the lord come over
[1:05:00] obstacles and and do great things
[1:05:03] and uh that's our relationship and
[1:05:06] fellowship with him is that he gives us
[1:05:08] the desire
[1:05:09] of his heart i had an experience
[1:05:14] this week and it
[1:05:16] it has something to do with what's going
[1:05:18] on inside of me and the
[1:05:21] sermon
[1:05:22] that i'm preaching
[1:05:24] i had went to see the
[1:05:27] engineer
[1:05:29] the soil engineer and when you do work
[1:05:32] for the city
[1:05:34] um
[1:05:35] they've got a gift to complicate things
[1:05:38] you know
[1:05:39] but
[1:05:40] they
[1:05:41] they want to know you know all about
[1:05:43] your soil and
[1:05:45] how dense it is and how thick it is and
[1:05:48] how the water drains through it and
[1:05:51] they want to test your concrete to see
[1:05:54] how long it will do and
[1:05:56] i don't know where they keep all these
[1:05:58] records but at least they want to look
[1:06:00] at them
[1:06:02] so i had brought a a i was going to
[1:06:05] bring some soil over to my the soil
[1:06:08] engineer
[1:06:09] the one that does all the tests and
[1:06:12] everything and
[1:06:14] so i talked with him and he's a muslim
[1:06:17] and and he's a good friend of mine
[1:06:20] and uh
[1:06:21] and um
[1:06:22] he invited me to lunch he said david as
[1:06:25] soon as ramadan's over we're going to go
[1:06:28] have a big feast together and
[1:06:31] uh you know i respect him i respect
[1:06:33] someone that lives their religion
[1:06:35] you know what i mean that follows can
[1:06:38] and i i know the muslim faith in whole
[1:06:42] because of its extremist has had a um
[1:06:47] a
[1:06:49] you know bad maybe thing uh politically
[1:06:52] and all that
[1:06:54] but you know they're the children of
[1:06:55] abraham
[1:06:57] but they're just not join heirs
[1:07:00] with the seed i mean i god that was
[1:07:02] god's plan
[1:07:04] but the love of god still goes out
[1:07:07] in my heart and he's still a friend of
[1:07:09] mine and
[1:07:10] and so i got done talking with sam and
[1:07:14] i was heading up the street
[1:07:16] and i started to turn and as i was
[1:07:19] turning down the street there's a
[1:07:21] church there it's been there for a while
[1:07:23] but
[1:07:24] something just compelled me
[1:07:27] to go look at it
[1:07:29] and i thought well i want to go look at
[1:07:30] their sanctuary
[1:07:32] so i drove to in there and i parked my
[1:07:35] truck and i looked in and little fella
[1:07:37] come out down there and
[1:07:39] had a little hat on everything
[1:07:41] he said can i help you i said yeah i'd
[1:07:43] like to
[1:07:45] i'd like to see your sanctuary i'd like
[1:07:47] to just look at it and
[1:07:49] see how big it is and what your
[1:07:51] seating's like and all that
[1:07:54] and so i went in and and i we
[1:07:56] fellowshipped and and our spirits
[1:07:59] uh were um
[1:08:02] just a kindred you know you know how
[1:08:03] that is
[1:08:05] and uh uh
[1:08:07] he spoke some english i don't believe
[1:08:09] his wife spoke much english at all but
[1:08:12] but he ended up being the pastor
[1:08:14] and we talked a little bit about the
[1:08:16] church and we talked about
[1:08:18] the seating and how many it seated and
[1:08:21] the walls and how nice it was and
[1:08:24] i couldn't help it but
[1:08:27] i was drawn to that pulpit like
[1:08:31] like there was some sort of
[1:08:34] affinity with it you know what i mean i
[1:08:38] i i i didn't know i just i just had a
[1:08:42] sense
[1:08:44] of uh
[1:08:46] seeing the platform in the pulpit
[1:08:48] and of course we always relate the pulp
[1:08:51] with
[1:08:52] uh ministry you know what i mean
[1:08:55] and so i had this sense so that you know
[1:08:57] i'm gonna minister here
[1:09:01] you know what i mean and
[1:09:03] and i didn't and and i just i knew that
[1:09:06] i felt that
[1:09:07] and and i and i of course
[1:09:10] in my mind i thought well maybe i'll
[1:09:12] preach in that pulpit someday or he'll
[1:09:14] invite me to preach but i just knew
[1:09:17] there was something there and it moved
[1:09:19] me
[1:09:20] and so i was there and it's about time
[1:09:22] for me to go in this and this the sister
[1:09:25] came in the wife came in
[1:09:27] and she said brother
[1:09:30] uh their
[1:09:32] spanish
[1:09:34] they're a pentecostal church
[1:09:37] their hispanic pentecostal church they
[1:09:40] i don't know if they have any
[1:09:42] affiliation i believe they're
[1:09:44] independent
[1:09:45] but the wife came to me and she said you
[1:09:47] know i don't believe that god sent you
[1:09:50] here
[1:09:53] without a purpose i believe god sent you
[1:09:55] here to pray for us
[1:09:57] me and my husband
[1:10:00] that we're in a um
[1:10:03] i i guess they're in some sort of trial
[1:10:06] it could be with the church it could be
[1:10:09] with the family i
[1:10:10] it doesn't matter
[1:10:12] what the trial is
[1:10:14] as long as you know the trial fixer
[1:10:18] you know what i'm saying so that that's
[1:10:20] that's why when i go to trial i want the
[1:10:23] the judge and jury and the attorney all
[1:10:26] to be on my side
[1:10:28] amen so
[1:10:30] uh let him judge his own case
[1:10:33] and his case is i paid for him
[1:10:36] i washed his blood away with my sin so
[1:10:40] anyway i just i thought it was so
[1:10:42] important i was moved on and i just
[1:10:45] i thought now i want to pray for you but
[1:10:48] i said faith's got to have a place
[1:10:51] that it anchors
[1:10:54] i said you just can't go by the
[1:10:57] anointing of the spirit
[1:10:59] you can't just go because you feel
[1:11:01] blessed or you feel anointed or you just
[1:11:05] can't pray to him and and just speak in
[1:11:08] tongues and and pray
[1:11:10] and and never have it have a place that
[1:11:14] it can rest
[1:11:16] and
[1:11:17] and take root
[1:11:20] you know if you if you cast a seed
[1:11:24] that seeds fine it could float in that
[1:11:26] wind but
[1:11:28] it is until it come finds some ground
[1:11:32] that it can anchor in and then it
[1:11:36] germinates
[1:11:38] in that ground and that ground becomes
[1:11:41] the bed of its roots
[1:11:44] and it will grow from there
[1:11:46] so we know that if it falls on stony
[1:11:49] ground right it'll it'll get withered
[1:11:51] away if it falls on banned ground it'll
[1:11:53] get trodden under foot so when you take
[1:11:57] a promise it's just like any promise of
[1:11:59] god's word you've got to bring it back
[1:12:01] and you've got to anchor it in the
[1:12:04] scriptures so i said to i says now
[1:12:06] whatever your problem is i don't need to
[1:12:08] know
[1:12:10] and i suppose i could have fished around
[1:12:13] you know what i mean and found out but
[1:12:15] there there was something in my heart
[1:12:18] that said he knows
[1:12:20] and and and i've got to keep man out of
[1:12:23] it
[1:12:24] because if i can keep man out of it
[1:12:28] then they will detect that there's
[1:12:31] something supernatural
[1:12:34] and i want to tell all of you here this
[1:12:37] morning every one of you
[1:12:40] you are the possessors
[1:12:42] of the supernatural
[1:12:47] you are the possessors of the
[1:12:49] supernatural
[1:12:51] we haven't brought ourselves to that yet
[1:12:54] but that's our goal is to try to work
[1:12:57] ourselves there and as a pastor my
[1:13:00] desire is for you to become more aware
[1:13:03] even my sermon this morning is to try to
[1:13:06] get something that will make you
[1:13:09] more aware of
[1:13:11] of of the victory and the power that you
[1:13:15] possess
[1:13:16] in god's word
[1:13:20] and so that i and i told him it had to
[1:13:23] be anchored in the word so i just take
[1:13:26] your problem and find a scripture and
[1:13:28] anchor it in that scripture
[1:13:31] because this feeling will leave
[1:13:37] this anointing will leave
[1:13:40] but that word will not pass away
[1:13:45] and the scripture says heaven and earth
[1:13:47] will pass away but my word will not pass
[1:13:49] away that doesn't mean heaven and earth
[1:13:51] in the future that doesn't mean all just
[1:13:54] the world is going to go away but
[1:13:57] it's the the the present things of the
[1:14:01] world
[1:14:03] heaven and earth is passing away every
[1:14:05] day
[1:14:06] every day your world changes every day
[1:14:10] if that will change that'll pass away
[1:14:12] but my word will never change because
[1:14:15] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:18] forever it's eternally anchored in
[1:14:22] something that god had in his mind
[1:14:26] and we'll we'll move towards that so
[1:14:31] anyway we just
[1:14:33] uh
[1:14:34] and i i felt so empowered
[1:14:38] with the wisdom that has been imparted
[1:14:41] to us by his messenger
[1:14:44] the statements the explanation of the
[1:14:47] word the pointing to the word of god it
[1:14:51] it just felt wonderful to speak the
[1:14:53] truth
[1:14:55] to know that that truth is set you free
[1:15:00] and so as we just testified and we
[1:15:03] started to pray and the spirit of god
[1:15:05] come on them and they wept and
[1:15:08] and uh
[1:15:10] and it was uh uh the lord really moved
[1:15:13] on her i don't i i i when i left i said
[1:15:17] you know i i don't care i said you're
[1:15:19] gonna get what you aunt you asked for
[1:15:22] i said because god hears my prayer
[1:15:33] it was a
[1:15:36] it was a move
[1:15:38] a shift
[1:15:42] instead of oh letting it be done
[1:15:45] according to your faith or it'll believe
[1:15:48] but i took responsibility
[1:15:57] and
[1:15:59] and
[1:16:00] so
[1:16:01] that's
[1:16:03] where i want to take us
[1:16:06] this morning
[1:16:08] in
[1:16:09] in the word of god
[1:16:12] if if i could use
[1:16:15] some statements and read
[1:16:17] and and bring you to
[1:16:20] what
[1:16:21] my
[1:16:22] my heart's desire is
[1:16:25] if i
[1:16:26] if i had a
[1:16:28] a title sermon
[1:16:31] i would i would uh
[1:16:34] call it
[1:16:37] the
[1:16:38] see if i i have my notes if i brought
[1:16:41] them
[1:16:42] with me
[1:16:44] i'm sure i did somewhere here
[1:16:47] i don't know
[1:16:50] this happens to me all the time does
[1:16:52] anybody ever realize i'm the most
[1:16:54] unorganized person you'll ever meet but
[1:16:57] uh
[1:16:59] uh you might
[1:17:01] you might look in there jackson to see
[1:17:03] if they're on my desk and i'll fumble a
[1:17:05] little bit until i
[1:17:07] i get them
[1:17:08] but i like to call it maybe
[1:17:12] the plan of the third man
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:19] so
[1:17:23] the
[1:17:25] there's a lot of paper there but is
[1:17:27] there anything that says something on it
[1:17:29] that i can study
[1:17:34] all right
[1:17:36] yeah i can get a sermon out of this
[1:17:38] amen
[1:17:42] all right
[1:17:43] this is what i wanted now
[1:17:46] so
[1:17:48] there's something that
[1:17:50] i want us all to
[1:17:54] finally
[1:17:55] settle in on
[1:17:57] that we are different
[1:18:01] okay
[1:18:03] we are different
[1:18:05] you're you're different
[1:18:08] from before you ever got here
[1:18:11] you you are different
[1:18:13] you're different from the world
[1:18:17] and it's it's it's a great struggle
[1:18:20] when you
[1:18:23] try to fit in
[1:18:25] to the world
[1:18:27] and we talked about that
[1:18:29] last sunday we talked about the struggle
[1:18:32] the struggling and i think that
[1:18:34] i think i saw a little skit the young
[1:18:37] people did where they showed those those
[1:18:40] things that tuggle war of those
[1:18:42] uh
[1:18:43] those uh emotions and and the census the
[1:18:48] five outer senses the fight of inner
[1:18:50] senses
[1:18:51] and the struggle tuggle war of of those
[1:18:55] things pulling
[1:18:57] at each other
[1:18:58] and
[1:18:59] and that's a struggle
[1:19:01] and then when you make your decision
[1:19:04] to
[1:19:05] enter in
[1:19:07] to serving god you finally make your
[1:19:09] decision that you're going to serve god
[1:19:13] now you have an adversary
[1:19:15] because he was trying to win you
[1:19:20] but the minute that you
[1:19:23] chose him
[1:19:26] he's no longer
[1:19:29] trying to
[1:19:30] give you favor
[1:19:32] so from the day that jesus did not fall
[1:19:36] down
[1:19:38] and worship him
[1:19:40] fall down and worship me i'll give you
[1:19:42] all the kingdoms
[1:19:44] of
[1:19:45] the
[1:19:46] the world the day he chose get behind me
[1:19:50] satan
[1:19:51] you know it man doesn't live by bread
[1:19:54] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:19:58] out of the mouth of god
[1:20:00] from that day forth
[1:20:03] they set in their heart to crucify him
[1:20:06] now they became his adversary you you
[1:20:10] know what i mean they they questioned
[1:20:12] them at first they had the tug of war
[1:20:15] but when he didn't move from what that
[1:20:18] he believed and what that he stood for
[1:20:20] and what his purpose was now they became
[1:20:23] their adversary and satan becomes your
[1:20:25] adversary
[1:20:27] you know we told the testimony how that
[1:20:30] we god had given us this dirt
[1:20:33] well the the drivers that were bringing
[1:20:35] it they came to us and said well you
[1:20:37] know uh they uh they told us not to
[1:20:40] bring any more dirt here
[1:20:43] and i said
[1:20:44] oh why he says why is that and he said
[1:20:48] because the devil's against the truth
[1:20:55] i thought now that's a
[1:20:58] okay
[1:20:59] well
[1:21:01] if the truth is asking the question then
[1:21:05] he'll the truth will get the truthful
[1:21:07] answer
[1:21:08] right and so we he said that he and then
[1:21:11] i said oh okay
[1:21:13] and so then i we went and
[1:21:16] and
[1:21:20] saw i said he said you need to go talk
[1:21:22] to the guy
[1:21:24] so i said okay where is he at and they
[1:21:26] told me where he was i drove my truck
[1:21:28] down there i got out i walked up to the
[1:21:31] trailer where he was and
[1:21:33] and he was a real uh
[1:21:35] just
[1:21:37] you know
[1:21:38] yeah
[1:21:39] what can i do for you you know
[1:21:42] and i just sat there for a moment i i
[1:21:44] prayed on the way over here lord give me
[1:21:46] favor
[1:21:48] with this fella
[1:21:49] you know what i mean and i didn't want
[1:21:51] to say anything to in front of the guy
[1:21:54] that was there so i just stepped up and
[1:21:56] he came up and we just visited a little
[1:21:59] bit and i told him about the
[1:22:01] the dirt and how he wanted and i i said
[1:22:04] i'd like to buy you lunch and buy all
[1:22:06] your guys lunch if you get there i'll
[1:22:08] bring barbecue over and everything
[1:22:10] here's a little offering of our
[1:22:12] appreciation for for the dirt that you
[1:22:15] did give us
[1:22:16] and everything and he says i said oh
[1:22:19] okay then he said
[1:22:20] you know i will i will send the the
[1:22:24] the dirt over to your your place and you
[1:22:27] can have it that's good i said oh that's
[1:22:29] wonderful thank you i says i'll take
[1:22:31] care of he says oh no he'll take care of
[1:22:33] it
[1:22:36] and i thought i thought you know
[1:22:39] this is wonderful
[1:22:41] because something else is moving
[1:22:43] now i want to just lay a few little
[1:22:46] quotations the foundation so let's let's
[1:22:50] establish our difference
[1:22:52] in the word of god
[1:22:55] you don't look any different on the
[1:22:57] outside
[1:22:59] but your difference is not on the
[1:23:02] outside
[1:23:03] it's on the inside
[1:23:06] that difference
[1:23:08] is trying to work its way
[1:23:11] to the outside
[1:23:14] all right so
[1:23:16] he says uh
[1:23:24] he said
[1:23:25] if you're a catholic
[1:23:27] this is out of the message and note that
[1:23:29] not
[1:23:30] so if you're a catholic
[1:23:33] and i tell you
[1:23:34] it's not in the bible
[1:23:36] not to eat meat on friday
[1:23:39] and all these things like this
[1:23:41] the holy eucharist isn't a wafer because
[1:23:44] it's a spirit
[1:23:46] and so forth
[1:23:48] and you go to your priest and say
[1:23:51] here it is wrote right here in our
[1:23:53] document
[1:23:55] and if the church is your ultimate
[1:23:58] you don't
[1:23:59] give a hoot
[1:24:00] what anybody else says that's your
[1:24:02] ultimate
[1:24:04] so if the word of god's your ultimate
[1:24:06] what
[1:24:07] you don't give a hoot
[1:24:10] what
[1:24:11] anybody else says about anything
[1:24:15] because you've got your absolute right
[1:24:17] oh god help
[1:24:20] this to sink in
[1:24:22] to me the whole thing is wrong
[1:24:25] god's word is the ultimate
[1:24:28] whatever the word says then that's right
[1:24:34] now the only way
[1:24:36] up here in this sphere
[1:24:39] that you could ever
[1:24:42] be in this little inside man
[1:24:46] you have to be foreordained
[1:24:49] because you
[1:24:50] was with god
[1:24:53] you're a part of god
[1:24:54] now remember that's the three circles
[1:24:57] the outside senses
[1:25:00] the inner emotions and then down in the
[1:25:03] soul
[1:25:05] you know so that part of man
[1:25:07] he said
[1:25:10] he said
[1:25:11] it you're a part of god
[1:25:13] i was in my father
[1:25:18] i was also in my grandfather
[1:25:21] and in my grandfather's grandfather by
[1:25:24] seed i was in that
[1:25:28] he said and i was in christ and you were
[1:25:30] in christ before the foundation of the
[1:25:32] world
[1:25:34] he came to redeem his own
[1:25:37] his own that was in him hallelujah his
[1:25:41] children that was in him he never came
[1:25:45] to save the devil's children
[1:25:48] they never will know it
[1:25:52] so if they'll never know it
[1:25:55] then if i could just
[1:25:57] automatically
[1:25:59] use the law of contrast
[1:26:01] if somebody doesn't know something then
[1:26:04] somebody has to know
[1:26:06] it okay so the devil's children will
[1:26:10] never know it but god's children will
[1:26:12] know it
[1:26:14] now god's trying to get that to you he's
[1:26:17] trying to let that sink in you young
[1:26:19] ladies he's trying to get you to realize
[1:26:22] that you possess a virtue you possess a
[1:26:25] value
[1:26:26] the sacredness of your motherhood and
[1:26:29] your union with the husband that sacred
[1:26:32] satan wants just to blow that away he
[1:26:34] wants you to give that away
[1:26:37] he he doesn't realize that you're the
[1:26:40] representation of the church
[1:26:43] someone that made to be led by the
[1:26:45] spirit of god
[1:26:47] and he wants to sell that out and and so
[1:26:51] he never wants you to know that you're
[1:26:54] special
[1:26:57] and satan is
[1:27:00] driven by time
[1:27:03] because his time is coming to an end
[1:27:07] but god's children aren't driven by time
[1:27:11] we say oh i'm too old you're never too
[1:27:14] old to get saved you're never too old to
[1:27:16] get baptized hey god it just it you know
[1:27:20] it doesn't have nothing to do with this
[1:27:22] time
[1:27:23] with this body be dissolved i've got one
[1:27:26] waiting for me so i'm not worried about
[1:27:29] this time
[1:27:30] in fact to a believer time is no more
[1:27:33] there's something else that we're
[1:27:35] interested in
[1:27:38] he says you know he says
[1:27:40] they never will know it
[1:27:42] they are so shrewd in the ways of their
[1:27:45] intellect learning
[1:27:47] that you can't compare with them at all
[1:27:55] now
[1:27:56] can you imagine you trying to keep up
[1:27:58] with the world when you've got a curse
[1:28:05] really
[1:28:08] god said
[1:28:10] you will never be able to compare with
[1:28:12] them
[1:28:15] so for all you are trying to become bill
[1:28:17] gates or
[1:28:18] any of these other guys out there elon
[1:28:21] musk and all those guys let me tell you
[1:28:24] one thing they can't take it with them
[1:28:26] but what you've got you can take with
[1:28:29] you
[1:28:31] like we don't care about insurance
[1:28:34] you know you know and i mean
[1:28:37] we want what we want blessed assurance
[1:28:40] we want what can take us out not what
[1:28:42] can protect us from going in
[1:28:46] he said
[1:28:48] you can you can't compare them all you
[1:28:50] can out talk them but by faith you see
[1:28:54] it
[1:28:55] so there there's something that already
[1:28:57] separates you and it's your spiritual
[1:29:00] eyesight
[1:29:02] okay so i'd like to go over
[1:29:05] um
[1:29:06] and read uh hear a little more he says
[1:29:13] okay this is in paragraph 160. he says
[1:29:16] now
[1:29:17] you tell her that it's wrong for her to
[1:29:19] cut her hair
[1:29:21] the bible said so
[1:29:23] it's wrong for her to
[1:29:24] wear them shorts the bible said so she
[1:29:27] will say nonsense why her ultimate is
[1:29:31] not
[1:29:32] down here
[1:29:34] in that
[1:29:36] third
[1:29:37] man
[1:29:39] her ultimate is not down here in that
[1:29:43] third
[1:29:44] man
[1:29:46] the soul
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:48] predestinated
[1:29:50] and sent from god
[1:29:53] so what is the third man it's the soul
[1:29:58] that's predestinated and sent from god
[1:30:02] so each of you now possesses a soul
[1:30:08] something that's been predestinated
[1:30:11] and sent to you
[1:30:13] from god
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:18] oh
[1:30:24] but her ultimate is an organization out
[1:30:27] here
[1:30:28] that some man has organized outside of
[1:30:33] this outside of this word but if the
[1:30:36] word of god is down in that soul
[1:30:39] it says amen
[1:30:41] i see it it lines up with it
[1:30:44] now look here therefore
[1:30:46] the man that
[1:30:50] it lines up with it now
[1:30:53] look here therefore the man that's born
[1:30:56] of the spirit of god
[1:30:59] now if i could say this so we we
[1:31:01] realized that
[1:31:03] you possess
[1:31:04] something
[1:31:06] in other words you've got something that
[1:31:09] is
[1:31:10] the a soul that's predestinated
[1:31:14] and sent from god
[1:31:16] so we call it the seed
[1:31:19] of seed
[1:31:21] a inside man
[1:31:23] a part of god in you
[1:31:26] as we called it here the third person
[1:31:30] now by faith you know it's there
[1:31:33] okay so
[1:31:36] and so you know a lot of times uh
[1:31:39] if i you know we're always looking for a
[1:31:42] way to describe
[1:31:44] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:31:47] you know some people want a sensation to
[1:31:50] link to
[1:31:52] some people want a a change
[1:31:56] to
[1:31:56] associate with it but if i could just
[1:32:00] speak like it in in this simple
[1:32:02] terminology something that will help you
[1:32:04] but the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:32:07] the resurrection of the third man
[1:32:16] right when that soul that man on the
[1:32:18] inside is germinated by the spirit of
[1:32:21] god when the spirit of god comes in
[1:32:24] awakens something in you
[1:32:27] that there's something inside of you
[1:32:31] then then you realize hey i've got
[1:32:33] something in me
[1:32:35] it's that's what we're trying to lay
[1:32:38] down is you're difference
[1:32:40] and
[1:32:41] and so
[1:32:42] uh we could go to this and now he said i
[1:32:45] want you to see that
[1:32:47] that
[1:32:49] that these things are
[1:32:51] if i could say this there
[1:32:53] existing parallel because
[1:32:56] you're still in the world
[1:32:59] but you're not of the world
[1:33:02] and jesus was subject to all the lust of
[1:33:06] the world
[1:33:07] he was tempted
[1:33:09] even as we are tempted
[1:33:12] okay but so we're talking about how can
[1:33:14] we go beyond that remember we talked
[1:33:17] about the battle
[1:33:19] and so the battle is once that that
[1:33:22] inside man's been awakened satan is
[1:33:25] trying to is the adversary of that
[1:33:28] inside man he wants never wants that
[1:33:31] inside person
[1:33:33] to come to its full
[1:33:35] predestinated
[1:33:37] part
[1:33:41] he'll he'll do you'll use anything
[1:33:43] religion
[1:33:45] uh whatever he can he don't care as long
[1:33:48] as it never comes to its full what
[1:33:50] maturity
[1:33:52] he says now look here here's a little
[1:33:55] lady twisting herself down the street
[1:33:57] here's a young fella
[1:33:59] his eye catches it he's a member of the
[1:34:02] church he's pentecostal he's whatever he
[1:34:05] is
[1:34:06] but the first thing you know
[1:34:08] there's no hold post in there
[1:34:13] she says hello
[1:34:15] he's got curly hair kind of nice looking
[1:34:17] straight shouldered young man
[1:34:19] maybe trying to live right she starts
[1:34:22] walking up to him even at preacher the
[1:34:25] first thing you know what is it
[1:34:28] this out here
[1:34:29] the flesh desire
[1:34:31] and that and the spirit down here yet
[1:34:35] annoying it says don't do it
[1:34:38] don't do it
[1:34:39] but what will it do
[1:34:42] it'll move right around
[1:34:44] there
[1:34:46] they're hold
[1:34:48] there it goes
[1:34:49] first thing you know he's trying to make
[1:34:51] a date with her he's guilty of
[1:34:53] committing adultery whether he touches
[1:34:55] her or not
[1:34:57] but a genuine born-again son of god
[1:35:01] now i think you all went through this in
[1:35:03] camp where everybody's talking about
[1:35:06] deliverance and deliverance and
[1:35:08] and get free and and and and deliverance
[1:35:12] ministry has been going on
[1:35:15] uh for a long time
[1:35:17] and uh and and so
[1:35:20] people
[1:35:21] they want deliverance from this they
[1:35:23] want from deliverance from that
[1:35:26] but let me tell you year after year
[1:35:28] after year we see it's only a temporary
[1:35:31] deliverance
[1:35:34] right
[1:35:35] people
[1:35:36] end up going right back even though they
[1:35:39] made their heart to live right they go
[1:35:41] right back but what they're failing to
[1:35:43] get to
[1:35:45] is they're failing to get to
[1:35:48] that tie post
[1:35:53] they're failing to have
[1:35:55] that
[1:35:56] inside predestinated third man
[1:36:00] resurrected
[1:36:02] so that third man is god to come out of
[1:36:06] its
[1:36:08] human grave
[1:36:12] right because we are the earth it's got
[1:36:15] to resurrect out of the senses it's got
[1:36:17] to resurrect it doesn't mean that you
[1:36:19] won't have a battle with those things
[1:36:22] you understand but now you've become
[1:36:24] aware there's something different i'm
[1:36:26] different there's something else inside
[1:36:29] of me growing
[1:36:32] and a lot of times we as preachers miss
[1:36:34] it because we keep bombing you if you're
[1:36:37] tempted we keep bombing and if you go
[1:36:40] through struggles bomb we keep bombing
[1:36:42] you you don't have it you don't have it
[1:36:44] you don't have it
[1:36:48] but you know
[1:36:53] i knew what god did for me
[1:36:56] have i always lived true to it to my
[1:36:59] shame
[1:37:00] i say no
[1:37:02] but has it always drawn me back
[1:37:05] praise god i can say yes
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:11] he who saved sins not is a liar
[1:37:15] but praise god we have one that makes
[1:37:18] petition on our part
[1:37:20] and if we are faithful and just to
[1:37:23] convince confess our sins he's faithful
[1:37:26] and just to forgive them
[1:37:30] and so we we
[1:37:33] he says
[1:37:34] he says
[1:37:36] but a genuine born again son of god amen
[1:37:39] you can't do it yourself
[1:37:42] it's totally impossible for a
[1:37:45] red-blooded male to walk before a female
[1:37:48] like that without something taking place
[1:37:51] but when there's something on the inside
[1:37:55] that little born again something here
[1:38:00] right what do we call that this morning
[1:38:03] the third man
[1:38:05] right when when the soul that's
[1:38:08] predestinated and sent from god is there
[1:38:13] when that soul because we want to know
[1:38:16] we want to grow to an overcoming power
[1:38:21] now for those of you that are in that
[1:38:23] struggle
[1:38:24] that are in and out in and out you do
[1:38:27] good for a while you fall you watch
[1:38:29] something you shouldn't watch you
[1:38:32] you listen to something you shouldn't
[1:38:34] listen to
[1:38:35] and you feel all condemned and beat down
[1:38:38] and
[1:38:38] and then you know we just tell you god
[1:38:41] loves you god forgives you and you you
[1:38:43] get yourself up
[1:38:46] we want you to keep going through that
[1:38:48] struggle
[1:38:50] we want you to keep going to that battle
[1:38:53] because we're trusting the time will
[1:38:55] come that you come into the atmosphere
[1:38:58] where you get the revelation by faith
[1:39:02] you see it there's something there's
[1:39:05] another man in me
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:09] there's another person in me and now i'm
[1:39:12] aware of that person
[1:39:18] it's like happening like i said it's
[1:39:20] like having the seed
[1:39:23] and every time the sunlight comes along
[1:39:26] the seed is drawn to the sunlight but
[1:39:29] that the spirit is not the driving away
[1:39:34] of all temptations in your life where
[1:39:36] all of a sudden you're wearing a roman
[1:39:39] collar and you're wearing a little nun
[1:39:41] habit and you're you know you're living
[1:39:44] this little fake religious life
[1:39:50] life's a constant warfare
[1:39:55] but you've got something else in you now
[1:39:59] that's speaking to you
[1:40:01] that's coming to life
[1:40:04] it's growing
[1:40:08] he says
[1:40:09] he says
[1:40:10] but when there's
[1:40:12] something on the inside that little born
[1:40:15] again something here
[1:40:17] tonight that might
[1:40:19] that man
[1:40:21] might have shouted spoken tongues jumped
[1:40:24] dance everything anointed with the
[1:40:26] spirit then all the signs and wonders
[1:40:30] that god said
[1:40:32] in there
[1:40:33] by his spirit
[1:40:35] jesus said many will come to me in that
[1:40:37] day say lord haven't i prophesied in
[1:40:41] your name haven't i cast out devils in
[1:40:44] your name
[1:40:45] he said depart from me you that work
[1:40:48] iniquity what's iniquity something that
[1:40:51] you know to do and you don't do it
[1:40:53] depart from me
[1:40:55] for me you doer's iniquity i didn't eve
[1:40:58] and know you
[1:41:00] but down on the inside of that man if
[1:41:04] that little tie post
[1:41:06] is there
[1:41:08] that seed of god that was predestinated
[1:41:11] before the foundation of the world i
[1:41:14] don't care what takes place it holds him
[1:41:16] it's there
[1:41:18] to
[1:41:19] stay
[1:41:23] now think of it i'm not talking about
[1:41:26] lack of temptation
[1:41:28] i'm not talking about
[1:41:31] about
[1:41:33] anything i'm talking about the
[1:41:35] realization
[1:41:37] of the third man
[1:41:41] maybe i preach this in another sense in
[1:41:43] a way of
[1:41:45] contacting the third man
[1:41:48] that if if you can't
[1:41:50] contact that seed
[1:41:52] for some people it's not there to
[1:41:54] contact
[1:41:56] but when you're going through a struggle
[1:41:59] and you're going through a trial when
[1:42:01] you're going through a temptation
[1:42:03] but i hope that uh
[1:42:06] that you will understand the prophet of
[1:42:08] god said it like this he said sometimes
[1:42:10] he was talking about blind barmass he
[1:42:12] said blind bartimaeus just sat down
[1:42:14] there and started to think it over
[1:42:17] he said that's what a christian does
[1:42:19] he says i drive my car out in the woods
[1:42:22] someplace and i park and i get out and i
[1:42:25] drive out in a place and i get alone
[1:42:28] with god and i think it over
[1:42:34] and if we would stop
[1:42:38] and get along with god prophet of god
[1:42:40] preached it in another sermon called
[1:42:42] hear ye him he says we're too many times
[1:42:45] doing all the talking he said what we
[1:42:48] need to do is get still
[1:42:50] and get alone and get to the place that
[1:42:53] we hear him he can talk to you you
[1:42:56] understand he created that inside man
[1:42:59] that predestinated soul he's obligated
[1:43:03] to watch over it
[1:43:07] and he wants to talk to it
[1:43:11] amen
[1:43:13] because he's just trying to make contact
[1:43:15] with these other this these other
[1:43:17] spheres but you've got to set that
[1:43:20] inside man in in his presence
[1:43:26] where he can talk to it
[1:43:30] if we were really to ask this morning
[1:43:32] don't raise your hands but if i was to
[1:43:34] ask how many could raise your hand said
[1:43:36] i've talked i've had a conversation with
[1:43:39] god from the inside man
[1:43:44] we would find out we have very active
[1:43:46] minds
[1:43:52] but that's what we've got to get away
[1:43:53] from
[1:43:56] you've got to break away
[1:43:58] into that place where it's not by the
[1:44:02] mind
[1:44:03] it's like the resurrection
[1:44:06] of the third man
[1:44:11] it's where that
[1:44:14] inside part of you
[1:44:16] which i'm trying to tell you that that's
[1:44:18] what's supposed to lead the church
[1:44:20] the church isn't supposed to be led by
[1:44:23] my lips to your ears
[1:44:27] the church is supposed to be led by
[1:44:29] god's spirit contacting the
[1:44:32] predestinated seed
[1:44:37] this is just a small tool
[1:44:43] now a real this paragraph 181 a real
[1:44:46] chris genuine christian will cope with
[1:44:49] that
[1:44:50] inside man
[1:44:52] that spirit that was back yonder at the
[1:44:55] beginning which is the word
[1:45:00] cope
[1:45:03] what a
[1:45:04] what a word to use
[1:45:09] in other words there's obviously
[1:45:13] something going on right
[1:45:16] what is that something it's you and him
[1:45:21] that's right
[1:45:24] it's you submitting to him
[1:45:28] you've got to you gotta take time and
[1:45:30] think that out
[1:45:33] think it over
[1:45:36] you know
[1:45:38] you know i just you know i think samson
[1:45:41] just
[1:45:42] failed to sit down and think it over
[1:45:46] we might not have that kind of delilah
[1:45:48] but our delilah comes in the form of
[1:45:50] careers and jobs
[1:45:53] and and every other kind of thing
[1:45:56] that's out there because you know what
[1:45:57] we do
[1:45:58] we think that oh i'll go ahead and do it
[1:46:02] and then i'll overcome it later
[1:46:11] what
[1:46:12] which of you
[1:46:14] would take poison
[1:46:17] because you know that there's
[1:46:19] medicine to make you well
[1:46:24] that's not coming from the spirit
[1:46:29] that's coming from the flesh
[1:46:31] and not everybody can do that
[1:46:35] but you
[1:46:37] are different
[1:46:39] you have a third person
[1:46:42] amen i'm looking at your outside
[1:46:46] and then then when you speak and you
[1:46:49] talk i see your inside
[1:46:54] that third person
[1:46:57] that's in there i can only know him
[1:47:01] when he is manifested or she
[1:47:05] is manifested in the works of god
[1:47:12] because
[1:47:13] right
[1:47:14] because that inside man
[1:47:16] that spirit
[1:47:18] that was back yonder at the beginning
[1:47:20] which is the word so it only has one
[1:47:24] identification and that's the word of
[1:47:26] god
[1:47:28] and and how are you going to
[1:47:30] how are you going to make a choice when
[1:47:33] you come up to a choice all these other
[1:47:35] spheres are speaking but this inside
[1:47:38] predestinated man any red blooded man is
[1:47:41] going to feel something he gets in that
[1:47:43] situation but if that third inside man's
[1:47:47] been resurrected
[1:47:50] that becomes your tie post
[1:47:53] then the only reason why i know that
[1:47:55] inside man is there and who it is when
[1:47:58] it abides in the word and jesus said if
[1:48:02] you abide in me and my word abideth in
[1:48:06] you
[1:48:09] so it's together so
[1:48:12] even now maybe in some of your lives
[1:48:14] your mind keeps looking back at your
[1:48:16] flesh and everything but i want you to
[1:48:18] understand that the very deliverance of
[1:48:21] your flesh is in this third man
[1:48:24] this third man is here to deliver you
[1:48:28] from yourself
[1:48:32] oh thank you
[1:48:34] pray to him who
[1:48:36] is within you
[1:48:40] that word
[1:48:42] third man that's in you is him
[1:48:45] that's what was with him on the cross
[1:48:49] that was which raised up from the dead
[1:48:52] we treat trying to try to bring
[1:48:54] everything of god over into the flesh
[1:48:57] instead of us getting out of the flesh
[1:48:59] and getting into god
[1:49:08] as he was the fullness
[1:49:10] of all of you
[1:49:13] you were in him back yonder at calvary
[1:49:17] he foreknew you
[1:49:19] would be here
[1:49:21] he only broadcast what would take place
[1:49:26] and you were in him you died with him
[1:49:29] you died to your pride you died to your
[1:49:31] fashion you died to the world
[1:49:35] you died with him in calvary
[1:49:38] and you rose with him when he rose again
[1:49:40] on the third day
[1:49:42] and because you've accepted it now
[1:49:45] you're sitting in heavenly places in
[1:49:47] christ jesus hallelujah
[1:49:49] there you are it's
[1:49:51] that inside man
[1:49:56] as we are describing it today as that
[1:49:58] third man
[1:50:03] so you're really somebody else other
[1:50:05] than who you think you are
[1:50:07] you're all schizophrenic
[1:50:13] and the only cure
[1:50:15] to your schizophrenia
[1:50:17] is the revelation of the person that you
[1:50:21] really are
[1:50:26] let that person live
[1:50:28] let the third man resurrect
[1:50:31] let him come to life in your life and in
[1:50:33] your flesh and in your words and in your
[1:50:36] actions
[1:50:39] you don't give a hoot what the world
[1:50:41] thinks god will change the world for you
[1:50:53] that inside man
[1:50:56] that will punctuate the word
[1:50:58] hang with the word regardless
[1:51:00] you can't help it
[1:51:02] i learned that many
[1:51:05] years
[1:51:06] ago
[1:51:08] amen and i'm going to try to hurry up
[1:51:11] i i wanted to be short because
[1:51:14] you know sometimes our pre-service
[1:51:17] alongs a little longer but
[1:51:21] anyway
[1:51:24] then we come down here to paragraph 2
[1:51:27] 17 and just just a quick foundation and
[1:51:30] i'll try to go through my sermon really
[1:51:31] quick
[1:51:33] it's got to come from the inside
[1:51:36] which is the word
[1:51:38] from the beginning
[1:51:40] in the beginning
[1:51:41] of the creation of god when god began to
[1:51:45] create
[1:51:46] bring you into existence
[1:51:48] you see
[1:51:50] you started back there as a seed
[1:51:53] and worked down
[1:51:54] to where you are now
[1:51:57] and then
[1:51:58] you were in christ
[1:52:00] and then when christ died he died
[1:52:03] it redeemed all of you
[1:52:05] and you are a part of this word how can
[1:52:09] the bible
[1:52:11] the bible all of it
[1:52:14] precept upon precept line upon line here
[1:52:17] a little there a little
[1:52:19] not only jot and tittle shall fail
[1:52:22] now in the world you
[1:52:24] you can
[1:52:25] being a part of the word disagree with
[1:52:28] the rest of it or any part of it so
[1:52:31] anyway that's what we just wanted to
[1:52:33] establish
[1:52:35] was that you are a preet the
[1:52:37] predestinated third man
[1:52:41] okay now i just want to move on real
[1:52:43] quickly here
[1:52:45] so
[1:52:46] i also had a subtitle that i didn't know
[1:52:49] what i was going to call this sermon
[1:52:52] and then when brother brown described it
[1:52:54] as the third man it really struck me as
[1:52:58] a complete another being
[1:53:03] so
[1:53:04] if
[1:53:06] there's something
[1:53:07] predestinated
[1:53:10] right so let me tell you what religion
[1:53:14] did
[1:53:15] and what satan did and why he wanted a
[1:53:19] religious spirit
[1:53:23] because satan is trying to incorporate
[1:53:27] the flesh
[1:53:29] in god's plan
[1:53:34] you understand or is that god's got
[1:53:37] a plan for your flesh
[1:53:41] but god doesn't have a plan for the
[1:53:44] flesh
[1:53:46] the plan
[1:53:47] is for
[1:53:48] the third man
[1:53:50] the plan of god is for
[1:53:53] the third man
[1:53:57] that soul that person
[1:54:00] that he created in you this is from
[1:54:02] things to be
[1:54:05] therefore paragraph 37 it says therefore
[1:54:08] the bride in the rapture will come forth
[1:54:13] and there is
[1:54:15] and there is all pre-planned by god
[1:54:20] all backed up
[1:54:22] from the beginning he knowed every man
[1:54:25] every place who would set all about it
[1:54:29] it's all pre-planned
[1:54:32] god knew it would be here
[1:54:34] and and he made it that way
[1:54:38] so that when we get
[1:54:40] there he's going to prepare a place for
[1:54:44] us
[1:54:44] and when we get there
[1:54:46] it'll all be prepared just like even
[1:54:50] this night is prepared like this hour is
[1:54:54] prepared yes his great foreknowledge
[1:54:57] tells him all these things by
[1:54:59] foreknowledge so god has a plan
[1:55:07] you believe that
[1:55:09] if you don't believe god's got a plan
[1:55:11] then you're a rat in a maze
[1:55:16] no i shouldn't say that because we got
[1:55:18] no rats here
[1:55:22] maybe you're a dove in a cage
[1:55:28] if you are a christian now
[1:55:30] a genuine predestinated seed so what is
[1:55:33] the third man
[1:55:35] it's that
[1:55:36] predestinated soul
[1:55:39] so there there's there's people that
[1:55:41] have souls
[1:55:45] but they're they don't have that
[1:55:47] representation in that soul
[1:55:50] then there's people here that are
[1:55:52] different
[1:55:53] because their soul was predestinated by
[1:55:57] god
[1:56:01] was was that simple enough
[1:56:04] you know that
[1:56:06] soul
[1:56:09] i can't preach revelation i can just
[1:56:11] preach the word
[1:56:16] you always was
[1:56:17] he says
[1:56:19] you was in god before there was you
[1:56:22] always was in god
[1:56:24] the germ of your life
[1:56:26] which is an attribute of god which was
[1:56:29] his thought
[1:56:31] so there's people that have souls but
[1:56:34] they're not in the thinking of god
[1:56:37] they don't have the third man
[1:56:39] so god is not trying to conform the
[1:56:42] flesh to christianity
[1:56:45] he's not trying to conform the flesh to
[1:56:48] a way of living he's not trying to
[1:56:51] conform the flesh to a way of worship
[1:56:55] we don't want to become the message and
[1:56:58] we believe this way
[1:57:00] and we
[1:57:01] we this is what we teach and this is how
[1:57:04] we worship and this is how we treat one
[1:57:07] another which is all good
[1:57:10] nothing wrong with that
[1:57:13] but this gets down to become so
[1:57:15] individual
[1:57:18] that is each person taking the
[1:57:21] instrument
[1:57:23] what that third man in them
[1:57:26] and playing
[1:57:28] the part of the third man
[1:57:32] the inward soul
[1:57:34] that inward man that other part of you
[1:57:37] you've got to make contact with
[1:57:40] god has a plan for that
[1:57:46] it's just that
[1:57:49] we've been
[1:57:51] so much
[1:57:52] acting
[1:57:54] in the confines of the church world
[1:57:59] that we failed to seek
[1:58:02] the plan of god
[1:58:05] for our third man
[1:58:08] not the plan god has for your life
[1:58:13] i don't care where you work
[1:58:16] as long as the third man can work there
[1:58:23] i don't care where you live as long as
[1:58:25] the third man can live there
[1:58:31] he said before
[1:58:33] you always was in god the germ of your
[1:58:36] life which is an attribute of god
[1:58:39] which was in his thoughts
[1:58:41] say for instance
[1:58:42] this pretty little lady sitting here see
[1:58:46] god said in the day there will be
[1:58:49] a girl her name will be so and so
[1:58:52] and she'll be this and thus in this
[1:58:56] and even no to this very hour
[1:59:00] she would sit and listen to the message
[1:59:03] dressed in a red dress see
[1:59:05] that was his thoughts
[1:59:08] whoever your husband is whoever he is
[1:59:12] and he would
[1:59:14] bring this together
[1:59:16] and you would sit here
[1:59:19] in this this city at this day
[1:59:22] there could be no way for you to fail it
[1:59:25] see
[1:59:25] because you're growing
[1:59:29] and as long as your seed insides growing
[1:59:34] you have to produce just exactly what
[1:59:38] the seed said it would do
[1:59:42] that's exactly his word
[1:59:44] he keeps his word he watches over it
[1:59:52] now we're talking about maturing now
[1:59:55] we're talking about going up
[1:59:58] a little higher
[2:00:01] so he's got a plan
[2:00:04] but what man's done is they've left out
[2:00:07] the very first purpose of god
[2:00:11] god wanted to reveal who he was right
[2:00:15] he wanted to have preeminence
[2:00:18] and what fellowship
[2:00:20] god wants to fellowship with the third
[2:00:23] man
[2:00:24] he don't care if you're religious
[2:00:28] he wants to be in communication
[2:00:31] he wants to speak to that inside man
[2:00:34] do this do that do this
[2:00:40] talking about moving up we're talking
[2:00:41] about growing
[2:00:43] we're not talking about fear
[2:00:47] of what everybody else is going to think
[2:00:50] we're not talking about fear of the laws
[2:00:53] and rules
[2:00:54] all right so
[2:00:56] i it's already 12 o'clock so
[2:00:59] i'm i'm gonna just have to skip it and
[2:01:01] uh
[2:01:02] we'll we'll work on some things to uh
[2:01:08] i'm selfish i want all the time
[2:01:12] forgive me
[2:01:14] uh
[2:01:17] i i just want to express this and maybe
[2:01:20] i'll i'll finish up just by
[2:01:23] reading
[2:01:24] this
[2:01:26] to you and
[2:01:27] and
[2:01:28] it's
[2:01:29] from the message if you want to go home
[2:01:32] and re read it
[2:01:34] it's uh
[2:01:40] called
[2:01:47] god using his gift
[2:01:50] and i want i this i want to use this as
[2:01:53] my
[2:01:54] as the thing that will grant to me that
[2:01:58] i just have to get these pages in order
[2:02:00] here
[2:02:02] five
[2:02:06] ten
[2:02:30] so this is from a sermon
[2:02:34] that brother bran preached in 1956
[2:02:38] and i just want us to follow this
[2:02:41] through
[2:02:46] because brother brahm's talking about a
[2:02:47] change in his ministry
[2:02:50] he just had a tent vision but something
[2:02:52] came up in here
[2:02:53] that was very uh
[2:02:56] to me was was very beautiful
[2:03:00] to help explain
[2:03:02] what it is that we're trying to
[2:03:06] lay hold of
[2:03:07] this morning and we just trust that
[2:03:10] you'll be able to take this with you
[2:03:12] this morning with a greater realization
[2:03:16] and he's speaking in this message he
[2:03:17] says in reading the vision you notice
[2:03:21] how the holy spirit had showed something
[2:03:23] else is just fixing to happen
[2:03:26] 1956 brother abraham has the tenth
[2:03:29] meeting the lord talks to him about
[2:03:31] meeting him and hi there bill graham
[2:03:33] doesn't exactly know how it's going to
[2:03:35] come to pass but it stirred them because
[2:03:38] there's something that's taking place
[2:03:41] and in this kind of healing service
[2:03:44] that i'm having now until i get into the
[2:03:47] tent
[2:03:48] i i'm just like a child with
[2:03:51] with christmas anticipation
[2:03:54] i can hardly wait till i get in there
[2:03:59] this way i can only stand so long
[2:04:03] because your faith is
[2:04:06] it that's does it
[2:04:08] it's not me operating that gift
[2:04:12] it's god
[2:04:14] it it's not me operating that gift of
[2:04:17] god
[2:04:18] it's your faith of doing it see it's not
[2:04:21] me it's you
[2:04:24] brother man ken i can't do nothing it's
[2:04:27] you that's doing it
[2:04:30] you're just making me do it
[2:04:34] and and talking
[2:04:37] you're just making me do the talking
[2:04:40] your faith is doing that
[2:04:43] you you out there in the audience with
[2:04:46] disease and sickness and things it's you
[2:04:50] using god's gift see
[2:04:52] see you see god has a gift
[2:04:56] now let me measure it like this
[2:04:58] because if somebody might come in for
[2:05:01] the first time tonight jesus was the
[2:05:03] greatest gift that god could ever had
[2:05:07] don't you believe that
[2:05:09] and when he was here on earth
[2:05:12] he had the spirit without measure
[2:05:15] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:05:17] dwelt in christ now he was the whole
[2:05:20] ocean
[2:05:22] all the seas all the water which is
[2:05:24] about four fifths of the earth is
[2:05:26] covered with water
[2:05:27] all of that water was in him what
[2:05:30] comparison
[2:05:32] with him the blessings and the measure
[2:05:34] of the spirit that god had given him
[2:05:38] his servants and ministers
[2:05:40] we just spooned full
[2:05:43] of water
[2:05:44] in comparison of the ocean or the sea
[2:05:48] but the same chemicals that's in the
[2:05:50] whole ocean is in that spoonful too
[2:05:54] see it's got to produce the same thing
[2:05:58] if it comes from the same place you see
[2:06:01] that's the reason
[2:06:03] so
[2:06:04] the third man that's in you
[2:06:07] has got to produce the same thing if it
[2:06:10] came from the same place
[2:06:12] what's hindering you
[2:06:19] a deeper understanding
[2:06:22] the spirit
[2:06:24] it hasn't entered into our hearts
[2:06:27] the things that god prepared for us but
[2:06:30] he will reveal
[2:06:32] them
[2:06:34] to his they're revealed to us
[2:06:36] by his spirits for the spirits
[2:06:40] searches
[2:06:42] even the deep things
[2:06:45] of god
[2:06:46] so now we're moving into the deep things
[2:06:48] of god well i'm tired of people just
[2:06:51] tell me i'm saved
[2:06:55] that i've got the holy ghost
[2:06:57] and here's the proof
[2:07:02] you don't need to prove to me
[2:07:06] that david and matthew are my sons
[2:07:12] when they do good
[2:07:14] when they do bad they're leslie
[2:07:21] i mean i hear it all time you look
[2:07:23] exactly like your son you lose your son
[2:07:25] looks exactly like you
[2:07:28] i always say no he looks
[2:07:29] i look exactly like him he is here first
[2:07:38] and
[2:07:40] and so
[2:07:42] he says he says now i'm going to jump
[2:07:44] down he says and jesus of nazareth
[2:07:47] when this was this whole water
[2:07:50] or the spirit on him rather as i say
[2:07:53] water a while ago giving the parable so
[2:07:56] you understand
[2:07:58] he was god's gift
[2:08:01] and any time that god wanted him to do
[2:08:03] anything god just raised him up and he
[2:08:07] showed him what to do he said i'll do
[2:08:10] nothing in myself is that right i only
[2:08:13] do what i see the father doing
[2:08:16] did jesus say that
[2:08:18] then could not he could not lie
[2:08:21] that has to be the truth
[2:08:24] we might just as well settle that
[2:08:28] forever
[2:08:30] jesus said he had nothing except what
[2:08:32] the father showed him
[2:08:35] uh first what to do
[2:08:38] what i see the father doing that the son
[2:08:41] does likewise check that back with the
[2:08:43] bible and see if every prophet or
[2:08:45] everything ever done anything outside of
[2:08:48] the first seeing at first
[2:08:50] to be done
[2:08:51] because it can't be thus saith the lord
[2:08:54] unless the lord has said it and you know
[2:08:57] it
[2:08:58] and it ain't a mystical workup
[2:09:02] or some mental emotion
[2:09:04] it isn't a psychology
[2:09:07] a
[2:09:08] psychological or a psychology it is
[2:09:11] absolutely god for showing something
[2:09:15] that's going to happen correctly
[2:09:18] and it will happen every time it will
[2:09:20] never fail
[2:09:23] right now and now this is i want to
[2:09:26] appoint there's a now there's going to
[2:09:28] be a difference here
[2:09:31] and i want to catch the difference
[2:09:33] because i think this difference is going
[2:09:35] to apply to us
[2:09:38] now watch jesus natharis
[2:09:41] he comes walking through the audience of
[2:09:43] people
[2:09:44] and a little woman presses her way
[2:09:46] through the the unbelievers
[2:09:49] she was anemi she had a blood issue
[2:09:53] and she says in her heart
[2:09:55] i believe him
[2:09:58] if i could just touch his garment
[2:10:02] it'll make i'll be made whole
[2:10:05] and maybe she slipped under this man's
[2:10:08] arm and he pushed her back and she'd
[2:10:10] come around the other side and slip
[2:10:13] in the other side and went between
[2:10:16] one's knees and down until she got
[2:10:20] over to the place till she touched
[2:10:23] him
[2:10:24] and walked back away
[2:10:26] and walked out in the audience and jesus
[2:10:29] stopped and said who touched me
[2:10:32] and she
[2:10:34] and the rest of them said not me
[2:10:37] they all denied it and then we know the
[2:10:39] scripture the ma the disciples say
[2:10:41] master
[2:10:43] everybody's touching you
[2:10:46] so we know there's a this is a different
[2:10:48] kind of touch
[2:10:51] he says uh
[2:10:54] he said they denied it but he said i
[2:10:57] perceive
[2:10:59] that i got weak
[2:11:02] if your a translation is right virtue
[2:11:05] has gone from me
[2:11:07] what did she do
[2:11:11] he looked around
[2:11:13] tell his power of discernment caught the
[2:11:16] woman
[2:11:17] and
[2:11:19] who she was and said thy faith has
[2:11:21] healed thee
[2:11:23] and then she came and fell down to his
[2:11:25] feet and confessed it all thy faith has
[2:11:28] healed thee
[2:11:29] or saved thee rather thy faith has saved
[2:11:33] thee
[2:11:34] now she used god's gift
[2:11:37] that's what made him weak
[2:11:40] but when lazarus died and jesus was
[2:11:44] foreshown beforehand
[2:11:47] of god how he went away and stayed away
[2:11:50] for so many days till lazarus is dead
[2:11:53] and the appropriate days come
[2:11:56] for his body to to be deteriorating and
[2:12:00] now all this time god had showed him
[2:12:03] because he said that at the grave he
[2:12:07] said i thank thee father that thou hath
[2:12:11] already heard me
[2:12:13] he knew what was going to happen
[2:12:19] look over here
[2:12:21] our friend lazarus is asleep they said
[2:12:24] oh he rested
[2:12:26] said he's dead
[2:12:28] and for your sake i'm glad
[2:12:30] i wasn't there
[2:12:32] because it might upset your faith
[2:12:35] if you want me to go pray for him
[2:12:38] beg me to do it and i wouldn't do it
[2:12:42] then you might lose faith
[2:12:44] this way i'm going i wasn't there but i
[2:12:48] go wake him
[2:12:50] he knew it why he
[2:12:52] he said
[2:12:53] i do nothing till the father
[2:12:55] shows me first
[2:12:58] and he and he had to seed it first but
[2:13:01] notice when he stood there
[2:13:04] how much greater
[2:13:07] was the miracle of the resurrection of
[2:13:10] lazarus
[2:13:11] than the woman touching his garment
[2:13:16] but there was nothing said about him
[2:13:19] getting weak
[2:13:22] god had used his gift in christ
[2:13:26] to foreshadowing the resurrection of
[2:13:28] lazarus and the woman used god's gift to
[2:13:32] get what she wanted
[2:13:36] now
[2:13:39] i want to separate these two
[2:13:42] not to the days of jesus
[2:13:45] but to the fact the scripture said as he
[2:13:47] is in this world
[2:13:50] as he is
[2:13:51] so are we in this world
[2:13:54] so there was a part of jesus right that
[2:13:58] did nothing
[2:14:00] till the father showed them
[2:14:03] the other part made them weak
[2:14:06] but that part
[2:14:07] didn't
[2:14:10] it was even a greater work
[2:14:14] he said
[2:14:17] the woman used god gifts see in this new
[2:14:20] thing the lord has told me about
[2:14:23] it'll be god using
[2:14:25] his gift
[2:14:28] what made brother branham weak
[2:14:31] the people
[2:14:33] using the gift
[2:14:35] so there's a difference between the
[2:14:37] people using the gift and god using the
[2:14:41] gift
[2:14:51] and when you're standing here in the
[2:14:53] public before people
[2:14:56] out like this
[2:14:58] is just a constant draw
[2:15:00] it's just a miracle of god
[2:15:04] if a virgin born son of god one time was
[2:15:08] such a strain till it pulled him down
[2:15:10] and got weak what about me a
[2:15:13] a
[2:15:14] corruptible sinner and look at the the
[2:15:18] times it's happened
[2:15:19] see
[2:15:21] it's god using his gift or you
[2:15:25] using his gift
[2:15:29] two different things
[2:15:32] so it isn't
[2:15:35] isn't me that stands here
[2:15:37] it's you that stands here
[2:15:40] that does it
[2:15:41] you out in the audience
[2:15:44] you're here on the platform you're
[2:15:46] drawing from god's gift
[2:15:50] i'm not his gift the spirit is this gift
[2:15:53] it's not my voice
[2:15:56] it just picks up my voice
[2:15:59] i'm a deaf mute
[2:16:01] until there's something behind it
[2:16:03] speaking and so would i be
[2:16:07] dumb
[2:16:08] mute or anything supernatural unless the
[2:16:10] supernatural is using the instrument to
[2:16:13] speak through the lord
[2:16:16] bless you
[2:16:17] now i want to
[2:16:19] just close
[2:16:21] in this because i i took a long
[2:16:25] way
[2:16:26] around
[2:16:28] to
[2:16:30] get here uh
[2:16:33] because i i
[2:16:36] i believe that there's
[2:16:41] that
[2:16:42] this is in 56 brother branham is going
[2:16:44] to have this change in ministry
[2:16:48] so i thought that you know how much of
[2:16:49] that applies to us
[2:16:52] see
[2:16:53] we're always using god's gift
[2:16:58] right in our battle
[2:17:01] god do this for me god do that for me
[2:17:04] god do this god do this we're always
[2:17:07] pulling on god's gift god's gift we know
[2:17:10] jesus is god's gift to us we're always
[2:17:14] using god's gift
[2:17:17] and that it's almost like we're at the
[2:17:19] place
[2:17:20] that all that we've been taught to do
[2:17:25] call upon the name of the lord call upon
[2:17:28] the name of the lord
[2:17:30] but when the prophet of god's ministry
[2:17:32] changed brother branham didn't seek god
[2:17:35] for the seals
[2:17:36] god used him
[2:17:39] to break the seals
[2:17:41] he used him to lay out the church age he
[2:17:44] used him to open the mysteries you never
[2:17:48] notice you notice he never got weak
[2:17:53] in doing that
[2:17:56] because it came from the difference the
[2:17:59] difference of
[2:18:00] of us using god
[2:18:04] and god using him
[2:18:09] because he was the gift of god that was
[2:18:12] going to
[2:18:15] open the seals he was the gift of god
[2:18:18] that was going to break the bread of
[2:18:19] life to the gentile church there were so
[2:18:22] many things we could go into this
[2:18:24] ministry but what my point this morning
[2:18:27] is
[2:18:28] and can i i know i took a long way to
[2:18:30] say such a little simple thing
[2:18:33] but we're always using god
[2:18:36] and we never get to that third man to
[2:18:39] find out what does god want to use this
[2:18:43] third man for
[2:18:48] he created them
[2:18:53] he had a purpose for him
[2:18:55] he had a plan for him
[2:19:01] he stands independent
[2:19:06] it's an individual affair
[2:19:09] he stands independent
[2:19:14] it's a predestinated soul
[2:19:20] and jesus did nothing until the father
[2:19:23] showed them
[2:19:26] because that was god using him
[2:19:32] she
[2:19:35] reached out
[2:19:38] and used god's gift
[2:19:42] but when god used
[2:19:46] him to raise lathereth
[2:19:50] because he said i do nothing in myself
[2:19:52] only that the father shows me
[2:19:56] and lazarus wasn't even to a place where
[2:19:58] he could
[2:19:59] touch the hem of his garment
[2:20:02] but when god
[2:20:05] used him
[2:20:07] nothing could stand in his way
[2:20:09] not even death hell or the grave
[2:20:15] and we're never going to move
[2:20:19] into a higher level until we realize
[2:20:23] that we're a special people
[2:20:26] that have a third man in us that third
[2:20:31] man is not of this world therefore it is
[2:20:35] not bound by worldly things it's not
[2:20:38] bound by the thinking of the world the
[2:20:41] traditions of the world the education of
[2:20:43] the world it is a free spirit that if it
[2:20:47] can break this barrier that it hasn't
[2:20:50] even entered into the hearts of what god
[2:20:53] can do with that third man
[2:21:04] but we don't even seek it
[2:21:13] we just qualify ourselves because of our
[2:21:15] past
[2:21:21] we
[2:21:22] we just qualify ourselves because of the
[2:21:25] struggle
[2:21:28] but if we know he's got a plan
[2:21:33] i'm telling you god didn't create that
[2:21:35] third man
[2:21:36] and said that third man here without
[2:21:39] having something in mind
[2:21:42] without having a purpose for it
[2:21:47] it's not just to keep this
[2:21:50] outward man
[2:21:52] this five census man this
[2:21:54] inside spirit man
[2:21:56] from contaminating itself
[2:22:01] it's above that
[2:22:03] there's something above it
[2:22:05] brother ben i can't hardly wait because
[2:22:08] i know it's going to be him
[2:22:10] using me
[2:22:12] not you using his gift
[2:22:15] through me it's you that's touching him
[2:22:17] it makes me weak it made jesus weak
[2:22:21] but when he knew
[2:22:23] what the father's will was what the
[2:22:25] father's plan was it didn't matter when
[2:22:28] he went
[2:22:32] there was no urgency
[2:22:35] in getting there
[2:22:37] he was free
[2:22:42] he was free he could
[2:22:45] he could
[2:22:46] he could go
[2:22:48] he he was led and so i just want to say
[2:22:51] there's a difference in you using god
[2:22:54] and god using you
[2:22:59] we're we're always wanting the signs and
[2:23:02] wonders to follow us by us using god
[2:23:09] you know am i you am i making sense
[2:23:14] i'm not educated so satan beats me over
[2:23:17] the head with that
[2:23:19] you know the only thing i got was i i i
[2:23:22] don't know if jesus went to school and i
[2:23:24] know brother brown didn't get very far
[2:23:25] either so
[2:23:29] and i don't have words
[2:23:32] to find it
[2:23:35] but
[2:23:36] there's
[2:23:38] we
[2:23:39] we're just always talking and what i'm
[2:23:42] trying to say is when we always are
[2:23:44] trying to get god to perform the miracle
[2:23:47] to get jesus to hope for the miracle it
[2:23:50] makes us weak
[2:23:55] yeah we don't know if our faith has been
[2:23:57] it's going to come to pass we're afraid
[2:23:59] if it's going to come to pass what if it
[2:24:02] doesn't happen the way
[2:24:04] we have it
[2:24:07] we're not really getting stronger that
[2:24:09] way
[2:24:11] we're struggling
[2:24:17] so us
[2:24:19] using
[2:24:20] god
[2:24:21] is different than god using us
[2:24:27] so we preach to people use god use god
[2:24:30] use god overcome use god
[2:24:34] overcome use god how about god using you
[2:24:40] how about god giving you the word how
[2:24:42] about god giving you the outcome
[2:24:48] i totally i don't need to know
[2:24:51] god sent me here to pray for you god
[2:24:53] hears my prayer
[2:25:00] i wasn't telling them to use god she
[2:25:02] confessed
[2:25:05] god sent you here
[2:25:07] god is going to use you
[2:25:11] you're here for a purpose to pray for us
[2:25:13] god brother i believe god's saying
[2:25:15] because he wants
[2:25:17] to
[2:25:18] use you
[2:25:19] i thought oh my god
[2:25:24] i walked out of that room just so
[2:25:26] excited
[2:25:29] i didn't need results
[2:25:33] i didn't need to see anything
[2:25:38] i didn't need any vindications
[2:25:41] i didn't know need no stars on the my
[2:25:43] plaque i needed nothing man i was so
[2:25:46] happy
[2:25:47] to be a part of it
[2:25:51] i wasn't even going to share it but it
[2:25:53] it fits so much in my heart what god's
[2:25:56] doing
[2:25:59] and i just look at us i said we're
[2:26:01] always using him we're always using him
[2:26:07] but what's going to happen to this
[2:26:09] church
[2:26:11] when god
[2:26:14] uses us
[2:26:17] amen
[2:26:18] and i don't know if i can find it but i
[2:26:20] managed to read one thing
[2:26:22] in fact
[2:26:24] let us stand and then if i do find it
[2:26:27] uh
[2:26:35] i don't know if
[2:26:38] it got brought out here or not
[2:26:41] and
[2:26:42] if not i hope i can find it

[2:30:32] i'd like to read this says brethren says
[2:30:34] that's the way it is today
[2:30:36] we still teach those things
[2:30:39] what great pentecost was
[2:30:41] what a great thing peter and john passed
[2:30:44] through the gate called beautiful
[2:30:46] the man was healed
[2:30:48] what good is the jehovah of yesterday if
[2:30:51] he isn't the same jehovah today
[2:30:54] what good is a god of moses if he isn't
[2:30:57] the same
[2:30:58] today
[2:31:00] puts me in mind of a man with a bird in
[2:31:03] a cage
[2:31:06] he goes and gives them the best food
[2:31:09] he can
[2:31:10] bone building
[2:31:13] to make good strong bones on his canary
[2:31:17] but he keeps him in the cage
[2:31:21] so he can't fly
[2:31:23] what good does it do to give him good
[2:31:26] orthodox food
[2:31:29] if you keep them
[2:31:30] pinned up
[2:31:33] that's what's the matter today
[2:31:37] we're sending preachers to seminary
[2:31:41] we're bringing very orthodox and trying
[2:31:43] to give the best food
[2:31:46] but they're afraid to come out and tell
[2:31:49] the people
[2:31:50] that their faith can set them free
[2:31:54] and make them healed and well
[2:31:57] and jehovah is still the same
[2:32:00] what good does it does it to have a
[2:32:02] bible study
[2:32:04] what good does it do to preach the
[2:32:06] gospel if we keep the people in a cage
[2:32:10] brother every one of you tonight can
[2:32:13] take the word of the living god and go
[2:32:16] from here just as free as a bird out of
[2:32:19] the cage amen
[2:32:22] oh my
[2:32:24] i don't want to preach you in a cage
[2:32:28] i'm trying to tell you got another
[2:32:30] person in you that god wants to talk to
[2:32:33] he wants to lead that he wants to use to
[2:32:37] do the work
[2:32:38] don't be afraid of it
[2:32:41] because it'll never
[2:32:43] never
[2:32:45] fail

[2:39:06] spoke to us this morning
[2:39:08] lord we know it's a relationship that we
[2:39:10] have lord that goes both ways
[2:39:12] though we know within ourselves the
[2:39:14] times to call on you and when we need
[2:39:15] something from you lord
[2:39:17] it's your desire that we would do that
[2:39:19] lord as sons and daughters
[2:39:21] but there's also a time that you would
[2:39:22] want to reflect what you're trying to
[2:39:24] accomplish and you would want us to lay
[2:39:25] down our will you would want us to make
[2:39:27] ourselves available you don't want us to
[2:39:30] be able to have that unction that when
[2:39:31] someone needs prayer that we would be
[2:39:33] able to offer up that prayer for them
[2:39:35] when someone is seeking counsel lord
[2:39:37] that we would have the words of wisdom
[2:39:39] to be able to speak to them lord when
[2:39:41] someone is needing a deliverance and
[2:39:43] needing something to be done for them
[2:39:45] lord that we would be a vessel that you
[2:39:46] could use and work through
[2:39:48] but we know that that's your desire
[2:39:50] father and we want to make ourselves
[2:39:51] available
[2:39:52] or do we want to be a church that can
[2:39:54] hear from you and lord as we walk in our
[2:39:56] daily walk as brother david said at
[2:39:58] church or at school or at work or
[2:40:01] whatever wherever we may find ourselves
[2:40:03] that if you're wanting to move that we
[2:40:05] know that we're a vessel that you can
[2:40:06] move through
[2:40:07] lord we're a church that wants to rise
[2:40:09] up higher is even being preached to be
[2:40:12] have that next level of faith and just
[2:40:14] know that you're working you're always
[2:40:15] wanting to do something and accomplish

[2:40:24] accomplish what you're looking for lord
