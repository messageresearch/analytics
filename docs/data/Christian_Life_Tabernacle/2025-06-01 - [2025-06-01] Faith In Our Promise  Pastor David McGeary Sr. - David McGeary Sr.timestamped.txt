[13:04] just so aware. And Father, we just pray
[13:07] God that seeing us gathered here today,
[13:10] just a few, but enough that we know
[13:13] you're in in this place with us, God.
[13:15] You said you would be, and we we trust
[13:17] you, God. We pray that you' just bless
[13:19] this service, that you'd bless the the
[13:22] minister, the people as they worship and
[13:24] try to enter in, God, to hear your word
[13:27] and the bread of life broken to us. We

[25:34] moment I step through those doors,
[25:36] Satan, you are behind. Amen. I'm telling
[25:39] you, I'm here to worship the Lord. I'm
[25:41] here to give him glory and honor for all
[25:44] that he does for us. Amen. But Benoa has
[25:47] a special if you could bring it at this
[25:49] time.
[26:03] God bless you, saints.
[26:06] while John makes his way up here. You
[26:09] know, you get to thinking and you
[26:10] realize God called us to be on the front
[26:12] line. He called us to be soldiers. He
[26:15] called us to fight. And we have to take
[26:18] that personally and say, "I'm a soldier
[26:21] in the army of the Lord. This is my
[26:23] battle." So, like Billy said, when you
[26:25] walk into that door, this is the
[26:27] battlefront where I would say, "This is
[26:30] the training ground." And when you go
[26:31] right back out, you're going into war.
[26:35] Sing this
[26:37] song as an encouragement to you guys.
[26:59] [Music]
[27:14] has been
[27:15] made in the
[27:17] blood of the
[27:21] righteous and me
[27:24] today think they'll
[27:27] surely get
[27:31] by. Unwilling to
[27:35] stand or fight in the
[27:39] battle when
[27:41] Christians of
[27:44] old gladly gave their
[27:49] lives. Oh well.
[27:52] Oh,
[27:54] well are those rugged
[27:59] soldiers who stood on the front
[28:03] line and gave up their lives?
[28:08] Tell me
[28:10] where, oh
[28:13] where are those heavens so
[28:17] faithful
[28:19] standing shoulder to
[28:23] shoulder for the cause of
[28:28] Christ. Don't look to your
[28:31] neighbor when the word is going forth.
[28:38] Search deep within yourself. Search your
[28:43] heart and your
[28:47] soul. You'll know for
[28:50] certain if you're giving Christ
[28:55] strong. So lay down all those
[29:00] excuses. Oh, and pick up pick up your
[29:04] cross.
[29:06] Oh
[29:07] well, oh
[29:10] where are those rugged
[29:15] soldiers who stood on the front
[29:19] line and give up their lives?
[29:25] Oh,
[29:26] where oh
[29:29] where are those he ever so
[29:33] faithful
[29:35] standing shoulder to
[29:39] shoulder for the cause of
[29:43] Christ. And
[29:45] here, oh
[29:48] here is one rugged
[29:53] soldier. I'll stand on the front
[29:57] line. I'll give up my
[30:01] life. Oh
[30:04] here. Oh here, Lord. I'll be ever so
[30:10] faithful.
[30:12] Now stand shoulder to
[30:17] shoulder for the cause of
[30:21] Christ. Oh
[30:23] here, oh
[30:26] here is one rugged
[30:31] soldier. I'll stand on the front
[30:35] line. I'll give up my life.
[30:40] Oh
[30:42] here, oh here, Lord, I'll be ever so
[30:49] faithful,
[30:51] standing shoulder to
[30:55] shoulder for the cause of
[30:58] Christ. I'll stand, Lord, shoulder to
[31:03] shoulder. I'll
[31:05] stand shoulder to shoulder.
[31:09] Let me stand shoulder to
[31:13] shoulder for the cause of
[31:18] [Music]
[31:24] Christ.
[31:26] Hallelujah. Amen. For rugged soldiers.
[31:30] We're here for the cause of Christ.
[31:32] Amen. We've been selected for the
[31:35] armies. Amen. Amen. this morning. Man,
[31:38] it's good to see brother Jezef Kitupa
[31:41] back there. If you could stand, we just
[31:42] want to welcome him this morning. I
[31:46] know.
[31:47] Amen. He's in the process of moving from
[31:51] uh Atlanta to uh here to our local
[31:53] church. We certainly want to welcome him
[31:55] and uh that the Lord will certainly be
[31:57] his portion. Amen. Uh brother uh Jose
[32:01] Mendoza writes, he says, "I want to
[32:03] thank everyone for the prayers for my
[32:05] wife. Everything went well with the
[32:07] surgery. She's now resting and
[32:09] recovering. I just like to be remembered
[32:11] that she could just have a faster
[32:13] recovery and it said bless you all and
[32:16] miss uh miss you all and the services.
[32:18] We are currently streaming from Mexico.
[32:21] Amen. We certainly pray that the Lord
[32:22] will be with them and we thank the Lord
[32:24] for guiding the surgery. Amen. And I
[32:27] know there's a lot that are out and
[32:29] visiting different places. And Sister
[32:31] Rebecca, she wanted to be here, but uh
[32:34] we had a musician's practice yesterday.
[32:37] She wanted to be here so bad. But uh uh
[32:40] there was a situation where she had to
[32:42] go to uh Louisiana to go. Um we
[32:45] certainly want to remember her in prayer
[32:47] and an unspoken request. Certainly want
[32:49] to pray that the Lord will be her
[32:51] portion and bring her back safe home.
[32:53] Amen. That's our heart's desire. And I
[32:55] know there are many traveling. Uh we
[32:57] certainly all of them that are
[32:59] traveling. Brother Matthew is out
[33:00] preaching. We pray that the Lord will
[33:02] bring him back Seth home and all the
[33:04] rest of them. We have some requests up
[33:06] here when I read before the church.
[33:08] Amen. Before that, uh Sister Veronic
[33:11] writes an announcement. He said, "Happy
[33:13] birthday to baby John Modi."
[33:17] Now
[33:23] only now you you would have to have been
[33:26] here for a while to understand what baby
[33:28] John means. And uh my we so appreciate
[33:32] him. And I have never seen a talented
[33:34] person like our brother. And you know he
[33:37] helps us with the song and he's sitting
[33:39] back there and we're getting everything
[33:40] wrong and he writes it down and he lets
[33:42] me know that was not the right key. You
[33:44] got to do this over here. do this. We
[33:47] certainly appreciate him and may the
[33:48] Lord bless him and continually be with
[33:50] him and and and we pray that his
[33:53] recovery that the Lord will certainly
[33:55] grant him strength and all that he has
[33:57] need of. Our God is a healer. Our God is
[34:00] delivered. Whatever we have need of, we
[34:02] have confidence that he can do it. Amen.
[34:05] We certainly thank the Lord for that. Um
[34:08] there's another request up here. Please
[34:09] pray for Caitlyn and uh she was uh uh
[34:13] rushed to the ER uh with a severe panic
[34:16] attack this morning. Pray for
[34:18] deliverance uh from depression and
[34:20] anxiety. Our God is a healer. I tell
[34:23] you, no matter what, it doesn't scare
[34:25] me. At least I'll say that. I know that
[34:27] we have a God who can bring healing and
[34:29] all of that. Uh, Sister Sandy writes,
[34:31] "Please pray for uh on my left foot
[34:34] healing and and my right eye healing uh
[34:37] of uh aneurysm. We pray that the Lord
[34:41] will certainly touch and bring his
[34:42] healing touch this morning." If you have
[34:44] a need upon your heart, I don't know in
[34:46] a better place to be than to be in the
[34:48] house of God. Just lift your hand out to
[34:50] say, "Lord, here we are in your
[34:52] presence. We are here for you that all
[34:54] that you wanted for us to do for us that
[34:57] you may do it according to your word."
[34:59] Brother David Junior, if you could just
[35:00] come and the brothers that are taking
[35:02] the offerings, if you could just come at
[35:04] this time.
[35:06] Amen. Don't forget tonight is our
[35:08] communion service. Amen. I my desire is
[35:11] that we may just be as full as we are
[35:14] this morning and come back to the house
[35:16] of God for communion. Amen.
[35:22] Maybe another way of saying prayer
[35:24] request is attention soldiers.
[35:28] Let's just go to him together with our
[35:30] portions of faith. Heavenly Father, when
[35:32] we come before you, Lord,
[35:34] we so grateful that you're mindful of us
[35:37] that we have a confidence that you hear
[35:39] our prayers. Lord, we renew our hearts
[35:41] and strengthen what was accomplished at
[35:43] Calvary, Father. And Lord, we think of
[35:46] how you're so mindful of man that you
[35:48] would come and visit us. Lord, that we
[35:50] could say that we're a people who knows
[35:52] you. That in our hour of need, you came.
[35:55] And Lord, now there's been requests that
[35:57] have been brought to us. Father, think
[36:00] often of as a child would see another
[36:03] child that's in distress and they would
[36:05] run to a parent or someone that could
[36:07] help that's bigger than them. Lord,
[36:09] there's a desperation. There's a need,
[36:10] but there's a complete confidence in who
[36:12] they're going to can help. Lord, we're
[36:15] coming to you with a complete
[36:17] abandonment, complete confidence in you,
[36:19] Father, that the needs that have been
[36:20] spoken, you can meet, Lord. Lord, and
[36:23] not only that, but you already provided
[36:25] a place, a completed work at Calvary,
[36:28] Father, we could come and claim
[36:31] redemptive work and the price paid.
[36:34] Father, we thank you, Lord,
[36:36] that what you
[36:38] suffered is for our benefit. So, we
[36:42] claim the full benefit this morning,
[36:43] Father. Lord, this panic attack, this
[36:45] fear, Lord, we know that's of the
[36:49] enemy, Lord. He's a perverter. the very
[36:52] things that are meant for channels for
[36:54] you to move through, he's corrupted. But
[36:56] you're the prince of peace,
[36:58] Father. Lord, be to a savior to that one
[37:01] in need this hour, Father. Lord, here in
[37:04] this service, the hands that were
[37:06] raised, Lord, may you just move through
[37:10] our unbelief, Father. Cast out anything
[37:13] that's a hindrance, Lord. And may we see
[37:15] you plainly in your word this morning,
[37:17] present help in the time of need. We
[37:20] thank you for Lord our brother John.
[37:22] Lord each step he takes to me is
[37:24] victory. It's a a champion of faith
[37:27] Lord. He encourages my heart every time
[37:28] I see him Lord. The words he shares and
[37:31] Lord he's continually feeding in your
[37:33] word Lord. You're glorified in his life
[37:36] Lord. And we thank you for that. What a
[37:38] testimony you have. And Lord the healing
[37:40] is
[37:42] just waiting to be declared in full
[37:45] manifestation. And we thank you father.
[37:48] Lord, we want to just continue to press,
[37:52] Father, as good soldiers, Lord, to this
[37:54] very hour we stand in right now. There's
[37:56] needs, Lord, and we're not giving up.
[37:58] We're not turning back, Lord. We're
[38:00] we're coming to you completely as you
[38:02] gave your all. We're giving our all,
[38:04] Father. We thank you in the precious
[38:06] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[38:08] Christ. Amen.
[38:11] Oh, what gift of
[38:14] grace is Jesus my
[38:19] redeemer. There is no
[38:22] more from heaven now to
[38:27] give. He is my
[38:30] joy, my righteousness and
[38:34] freom. Oh, and my steadfast love. Oh
[38:39] mighty boundless me. Oh and to this I
[38:46] hope my hope is only

[47:42] humbly come before you and we
[47:47] exalt your great name.
[47:51] the great love that you showed
[47:54] us in sending your only begotten son who
[47:58] was free from
[48:00] sin but yet took our sin upon
[48:04] himself and he bore our
[48:08] reproach and the
[48:10] chastisement and correction and
[48:12] punishment that was due
[48:14] us. He took it upon himself
[48:19] [Music]
[48:21] And that by those stripes that they laid
[48:24] upon him,
[48:25] Father, through that great
[48:30] suffering, he granted us
[48:34] healing, spiritual
[48:36] healing, physical healing, mental
[48:40] healing.
[48:41] [Music]
[48:45] Father, the complete restoration of our
[48:48] hearts and our minds and our
[48:53] souls. And we this morning as we sing
[48:58] that song, we have not words even to or
[49:03] the mental capability of even
[49:06] comprehending this love which is so
[49:09] beyond understanding.
[49:11] why that you would do such a thing for a
[49:14] people such as
[49:16] us. But Lord, we believe you did and
[49:20] we're thankful this morning. And Father,
[49:23] may we partake in the benefits of
[49:26] Calvary today. We ask it in Jesus
[49:29] precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[49:34] bless you this morning. Let's turn in
[49:35] our Bibles to Hebrews.
[49:41] If you'll uh bear with me a little bit,
[49:44] I as many of you know, I had a
[49:48] a a I and somehow got a cyst on the back
[49:52] of my
[49:54] uh neck and in my neck and it grew in
[49:57] there. And I I told the doctor, I said,
[49:59] you know, I shower twice a day. He said,
[50:01] it doesn't have anything to do with
[50:03] being clean or anything. He says, "Some
[50:06] people get them and some people don't,
[50:08] you know, but I've been on a lot of
[50:10] antibiotics and and uh different pills
[50:15] and shooting shots. I've had quite a bit
[50:17] of infection
[50:19] uh that I've been battling through. Uh
[50:23] but the Lord is gracious, you know, and
[50:25] finally things have turned around, but
[50:28] it's leftly me a little weak and a
[50:31] little shaky. So, uh,
[50:35] um, I'm going to do the best I can this
[50:38] morning and, uh, so if I leave some
[50:41] stuff out, you fill in the blanks. Have
[50:44] you ever Have you ever done fill in the
[50:47] blanks? Well, we had a a Bible quiz the
[50:51] other day. they that someone gave me and
[50:54] I filled in all the blanks. But then
[50:56] they came to the what was the first
[51:01] marriage in the
[51:04] Bible and I got to thinking and I
[51:06] thought you know it's now because of my
[51:09] revelation it wasn't Adam and Eve. I
[51:13] said it must be Cain because the
[51:15] scripture says Cain went out and took
[51:16] for himself a wife right and of course I
[51:20] you know I I missed the quiz but I still
[51:23] think I was right.
[51:26] So anyway, I want to read in Hebrews the
[51:29] 11th
[51:31] chapter and the 8th and 9inth verse or
[51:35] 10 through the 10th verse and
[51:39] uh use this little scripture to just
[51:43] have fellowship with you this morning.
[51:44] Just Sunday school this morning. I'm
[51:47] gonna try to stay relaxed and just uh
[51:51] read a little to you and and uh and
[51:54] we'll just rejoice around God's
[51:57] word. It said, "By faith,
[52:00] Abraham," now Abraham's the father of
[52:03] our faith, right?
[52:05] By faith, Abraham when he was called to
[52:09] go out into a place which he
[52:13] should after receive for inheritance
[52:18] obeyed. And he went out, not knowing
[52:22] whether he
[52:24] went. By faith he so journeyied in the
[52:29] land of
[52:30] promise as a as in a strange country
[52:35] dwelling in tabernacles or tents with
[52:39] Isaac and
[52:41] Jacob heirs with him of the same
[52:46] promise. For he looked for a city which
[52:51] hath which hath foundations, whose
[52:55] builder and maker is God. Gracious
[52:58] Father, bless your word to us. In your
[53:00] precious name we pray. Amen. God bless
[53:04] you this morning.
[53:06] We want to fellowship a little bit this
[53:08] morning around the message uh proving
[53:12] his word
[53:14] and and uh just read some statements and
[53:19] just have a a time together. This
[53:22] scripture uh struck me a a whole lot
[53:27] about
[53:28] Abraham and the kind of faith that
[53:31] Abraham had and
[53:35] uh and being the father of our faith
[53:40] that we knew it wasn't the lineage of
[53:44] Abraham that was imputed, but it was the
[53:48] faith of Abraham.
[53:51] And being the children of
[53:54] Abraham, then we would have to have the
[53:57] same kind of faith that Abraham had. You
[54:01] You understand? In other words, it it's
[54:03] not a different faith. It's the same
[54:06] faith that Abraham had. And and this is
[54:10] such a a a wonderful scripture here as
[54:14] it begins to unfold. So Abraham was
[54:18] called out. He was told to leave where
[54:21] he was go. I like just how Paul puts he
[54:24] says A Abraham when he was called to go
[54:29] out. So he was called to go out to a
[54:33] place and and he had never been to a
[54:37] place called out to go to a place which
[54:40] he should after receive for inheritance.
[54:43] So he he went out he stepped out into a
[54:48] place was called out to a land to go to
[54:52] this land and that land was going to be
[54:56] his
[54:58] inheritance because he had a promise and
[55:01] so he obeyed the promise and Abraham he
[55:06] stepped out and made a move in to this
[55:10] land. He he he he so journeyied there as
[55:16] a
[55:17] stranger, you know, not knowing that he
[55:20] was going to fall heir to all that land.
[55:24] And we find out later through Jacob and
[55:27] and Israel and and
[55:29] and Isaac and the 12 tribes and the
[55:33] going into that and the coming back out
[55:36] and the establishing of the kingdom.
[55:38] That whole thing finally became the
[55:40] inheritance of Abraham and became the
[55:44] land that he dwelt in and the borders
[55:47] that he had. And Israel to this day
[55:50] still claims that to be their land.
[55:54] the land of promise. Now, politically,
[55:57] that's not very
[55:59] popular and has
[56:02] caused a lot of trouble and a lot of
[56:05] commotion. And we won't go through all
[56:07] those all that side of it, but we just
[56:11] want to talk a little bit about Abraham
[56:15] and and what what he did. So, he's
[56:19] walking in a land that's promised to
[56:22] him.
[56:25] It's his
[56:26] inheritance. It's his land.
[56:29] But he he's he he didn't know where he
[56:32] went.
[56:34] In other words, it it hadn't
[56:37] materialized, if I could say it this
[56:39] way. In fact, he was there in that land
[56:42] of
[56:43] promise almost like a stranger.
[56:47] This is strange to me. And I'm saying
[56:50] this to this morning because Abraham, he
[56:54] he stepped out and he made his move
[56:59] based on the promise. That's right. Not
[57:02] on what he seen, not what he felt, not
[57:06] what he heard, not on what he could
[57:09] explain. But Abraham moved into a
[57:12] situation.
[57:14] He moved into a
[57:17] lifestyle. He moved into a way of
[57:20] thinking, if I could say this way, with
[57:23] a hope on his heart, with somebody's
[57:25] longing in him and searching in him, he
[57:29] he walked into this place and he
[57:32] sojourned there even like he didn't
[57:35] belong.
[57:37] They didn't feel he belonged. Who's this
[57:41] guy comes over here and he brought his
[57:44] family with him? Uh he he brought Isaac
[57:47] and Jacob and and and and they were also
[57:51] heirs to the promise because he said to
[57:55] your seed and and your seed seed and so
[57:59] they were heirs to the promise. And so
[58:02] he walks into this this land. He moves
[58:05] to this place because God told him to
[58:09] move. And and he he does
[58:14] this solely not from anything that he
[58:18] could
[58:20] understand, but his faith was based
[58:25] on the
[58:27] promise. So he stepped out on a promise.
[58:30] And and this morning is kind of where
[58:33] I'm I'm going and we want to fellowship
[58:36] a a little bit around is
[58:40] you when you faith steps out into
[58:45] something and believes something that
[58:50] they haven't seen or understand.
[58:54] They don't walk by faith. We we're to
[58:58] walk by faith, not by sight. Isn't that
[59:02] correct? That we want to we want our
[59:05] lives to grow
[59:07] spiritually. We want
[59:09] to we want to
[59:11] fulfill what the will of God is in our
[59:15] life. But with that is a stepping out. I
[59:20] it's it's a leaving the place that
[59:22] you're comfortable. leaving leaving the
[59:26] things that you are and stepping into
[59:29] situations, stepping into circumstances,
[59:32] stepping into challenges, stepping into
[59:35] places of of confusion and and trouble
[59:40] and and all these things that surround
[59:43] us. and stepping out on faith. Not
[59:46] worrying about anything that's there,
[59:49] anything that's said, not worrying about
[59:52] whether you understand it or not, but
[59:54] knowing one thing. You have a promise.
[1:00:01] And the the believer's life like
[1:00:05] Abraham's
[1:00:06] life is based on promise,
[1:00:11] not on production.
[1:00:15] We've we've trying to take
[1:00:18] it too much upon ourselves to to feel
[1:00:24] that we have to produce a certain
[1:00:28] lifestyle or we have to produce a
[1:00:31] certain way of living. that we have to
[1:00:35] give up things and and and do this and
[1:00:39] do that and and
[1:00:41] and trying to grab forth of the
[1:00:45] responsibility. Abraham stepped out and
[1:00:49] into a land where he was promised that
[1:00:51] he was going to have seed
[1:00:56] offspring and he went out having no
[1:01:00] evidence.
[1:01:02] In fact, his wife and him that she
[1:01:05] couldn't even bear children
[1:01:09] and yet he's got this
[1:01:11] promise and his faith was
[1:01:16] not and you know the guy if you look at
[1:01:21] him you wouldn't measure up anything man
[1:01:24] twice he lied about his wife.
[1:01:28] we would think, oh, if he if he
[1:01:32] was, you know, this great
[1:01:34] patriarch, how could he do these
[1:01:38] things? And I think it's orchestrated by
[1:01:41] God so we can come to the place that
[1:01:44] that we grab a hold of this that was not
[1:01:48] held against Abraham.
[1:01:51] That was Abraham's
[1:01:53] carnal decisions and and his carnal
[1:01:57] battle.
[1:01:58] So he tells the king, "Now this is my
[1:02:00] sister." The king says, "She's
[1:02:02] beautiful." And the brother Ram says,
[1:02:04] "We have the revelation of that."
[1:02:07] Because a king's not going to like an
[1:02:08] old 80 100y old, you know, he's got
[1:02:11] everything. God transformed them. But
[1:02:14] anyway, so they're
[1:02:16] they're so he lies to the king. The
[1:02:20] king's righteous.
[1:02:22] So God goes visits the king and tells
[1:02:27] him he said this is my servant.
[1:02:32] Okay. This is I've chosen this guy. Go
[1:02:36] have him pray for you. Pray for me.
[1:02:42] Yes. Not because you're righteous, but
[1:02:45] because of who Abraham was.
[1:02:49] You understand? He wanted
[1:02:52] He that was a blessing to the king.
[1:02:54] Right.
[1:02:57] It if you have Abraham pray for you
[1:03:01] because of who that I made him, because
[1:03:04] of how that I called him, because who he
[1:03:08] is
[1:03:10] and what that I've called him and what
[1:03:12] part of it he's done and and that that
[1:03:17] he will attribute to you and and pass to
[1:03:22] you a blessing.
[1:03:24] It was because that Abraham was was
[1:03:28] chosen by God
[1:03:32] to to fulfill a
[1:03:36] plan. So God had a plan. Do you
[1:03:40] understand that? So God h had something
[1:03:43] that he's going to accomplish, something
[1:03:46] that's going to to come to pass,
[1:03:49] something that he said, "Uh, I'm I'm
[1:03:52] going to do
[1:03:53] this." You know, way back in the
[1:03:56] beginning before the foundation of the
[1:03:58] world, he he he wanted to have a people
[1:04:01] called out. He had this great plan in
[1:04:04] his mind how this was all going to uh
[1:04:07] unfold.
[1:04:10] And just like Noah, he knew the time
[1:04:13] would come that he would destroy the
[1:04:16] earth. And so he spoke to Noah. And Noah
[1:04:22] by promise,
[1:04:24] not by righteousness,
[1:04:27] not that he was an engineer,
[1:04:30] not that he had any ability or talent
[1:04:33] within himself,
[1:04:35] but because God chose him.
[1:04:41] And by the election of God's choice, he
[1:04:46] gave Noah a promise and told Noah it
[1:04:51] would rain and that God will provide him
[1:04:54] a way of
[1:04:55] escape. And Noah believed it. That's
[1:04:59] right. He didn't build the ark on
[1:05:01] science.
[1:05:03] He didn't build the ark on what he
[1:05:06] heard, what he saw, what he felt.
[1:05:12] He could He had no
[1:05:16] senses or
[1:05:19] logic that he could attribute his
[1:05:22] actions to.
[1:05:25] In
[1:05:27] fact, he was criticized.
[1:05:30] He was mocked. He he
[1:05:34] was
[1:05:36] had no doubt a tremendous amount of
[1:05:41] resistance, but the only thing that
[1:05:44] drove him
[1:05:46] was that he had a promise.
[1:05:51] Now, we're the children of Abraham.
[1:05:56] Do you understand? So, we can't go by
[1:05:58] what we see.
[1:06:02] But we've got to go by what's promised
[1:06:04] to us.
[1:06:07] And I I hope that I I won't be able to
[1:06:10] go too long this morning, but I I hope
[1:06:13] that that you can see that Abraham
[1:06:17] stepped out
[1:06:19] on that promise.
[1:06:21] So, we talked about this as our little
[1:06:24] study's been going about. You've got to
[1:06:26] have faith in your call.
[1:06:30] You got to know that God calls you.
[1:06:32] We're going to go over this again this
[1:06:34] morning. And you've got to know that the
[1:06:38] potential is in the promise. Abraham's
[1:06:42] dwelling in a land. And he's walking in
[1:06:46] a land. And it says he's
[1:06:50] sojourned in the land of promise, the
[1:06:53] very land that was promised to him. He's
[1:06:57] he as a strange
[1:07:00] country dwelling in tabernacles and with
[1:07:04] Isaac in them. So he steps out into this
[1:07:06] land. It's the land that's promised to
[1:07:09] him. It's the very land that that is
[1:07:14] heir to him. He's got his heirs with
[1:07:17] him. All this is his land. And yet to
[1:07:21] him it's like a a strange
[1:07:27] country. In other words, a place that he
[1:07:30] had never been
[1:07:35] before. And so many people fail to step
[1:07:39] out because of the fear of failure.
[1:07:47] They're not sure what will happen.
[1:07:52] They're not sure if I give up my job to
[1:07:57] do a certain thing for God, what what
[1:08:01] the result of that would be. They they
[1:08:04] feel that that there's certain things
[1:08:06] that they've got to make sure that they
[1:08:09] have. They I've got to have so much
[1:08:11] money in the bank. I've got to do this.
[1:08:15] I I've I've got to do that. And can And
[1:08:18] they won't step out
[1:08:20] on
[1:08:22] faith. Like it's into a land they never
[1:08:25] been before into places and situations
[1:08:29] and circumstances that they can't
[1:08:31] understand, but there's something inside
[1:08:34] of them, a faith inside of them that
[1:08:36] they felt God spoke to them.
[1:08:39] And because God spoke to them and God
[1:08:42] give them a promise, they stepped out on
[1:08:45] this
[1:08:45] promise. I will not see the righteous
[1:08:48] bake bread.
[1:08:50] Lord, I'm going to believe that. You may
[1:08:53] be ending up doing job that you never
[1:08:56] thought you would do.
[1:09:00] Things may not go, but you're part of
[1:09:02] the plan of what God has for you by
[1:09:06] promise. Now,
[1:09:10] Abraham was part of the plan of God in
[1:09:14] order for God to fulfill his word.
[1:09:19] Because all scripture must be fulfilled.
[1:09:25] So God has
[1:09:28] people that are
[1:09:31] elected and
[1:09:33] chosen and predestinated
[1:09:38] to
[1:09:41] fulfill and
[1:09:43] perform and bring the scriptures to
[1:09:47] pass.
[1:09:49] So they become part of the fulfillment.
[1:09:52] Abraham was part of the fulfillment of
[1:09:56] God's plan.
[1:09:59] Abraham didn't choose God. God chose
[1:10:02] Abraham. Amen. God knew Abraham would
[1:10:06] believe. He knew that there was
[1:10:08] something in Abraham that he created and
[1:10:11] put in there that Abraham was going to
[1:10:14] accept it.
[1:10:16] He he believed
[1:10:18] it. And when Abraham when God gave him
[1:10:21] the promise, come on.
[1:10:24] Abraham says, "Wait a minute. You know,
[1:10:27] we're we're dead. You know, Sarah, she's
[1:10:31] she can't have children. and I can't
[1:10:33] have children. What What are you saying?
[1:10:36] Didn't matter.
[1:10:38] He made his move not based on anything
[1:10:43] other than the promise.
[1:10:47] Now,
[1:10:49] Abraham was part and elected and chosen
[1:10:55] to be part of God's plan. So therefore,
[1:10:59] Abraham had to go through every
[1:11:01] circumstance, every challenge. God
[1:11:04] brought him through everything that that
[1:11:07] came against him, every battle that he
[1:11:10] had, even going to get Lot, you know,
[1:11:14] Sodom and Gamore, all the different
[1:11:16] things that that went on in Abraham's
[1:11:19] life. It all was transpiring and all
[1:11:22] came to
[1:11:23] pass and all transpired and developed
[1:11:27] according to the promise that God gave
[1:11:31] Abraham, right?
[1:11:34] It was based on promise.
[1:11:38] And and and there's promises for our
[1:11:42] day.
[1:11:44] And if there's promises for our day,
[1:11:47] there's people that God chooses
[1:11:51] to accept those
[1:11:53] promises and step out into those
[1:11:57] promises.
[1:11:59] Not faith in themselves,
[1:12:02] not in their ability,
[1:12:05] not in in their uh their intellectual
[1:12:12] uh expression. In other words, they draw
[1:12:15] the picture in their mind. They have an
[1:12:18] intellectual conception and they think
[1:12:20] that's the way it is.
[1:12:23] They think that's the way religion is.
[1:12:25] They think that's the way God works is.
[1:12:28] you know what they perceive, what they
[1:12:30] put together, their theology, they build
[1:12:32] the scriptures, they put the quotes
[1:12:34] together, they do whatever they want to
[1:12:37] do, and then they in their mind they
[1:12:40] think this is the way it is.
[1:12:43] It is the way God planned it to be.
[1:12:50] And you can't you can't put the events
[1:12:54] that happens into your life
[1:12:59] and make sometimes reasoning out of it.
[1:13:05] Because sometimes they don't make sense.
[1:13:08] That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:13:10] Why am I here? What did this happen? Why
[1:13:12] did I do that? How did I do this? You
[1:13:14] could go on forever there. There's no
[1:13:18] there's not the answer. The answer is
[1:13:21] God had a promise. He made a promise and
[1:13:25] he chose you.
[1:13:27] to be a part of that plan.
[1:13:31] Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] So if he elected you to be a part of
[1:13:35] that plan, then there's a part of that
[1:13:38] plan that you have to fulfill.
[1:13:43] And all you need to understand is is the
[1:13:46] promise.
[1:13:49] Did he promise to have a bride?
[1:13:54] Did he promise to have an elect?
[1:13:57] in this age. Did he promise to send a
[1:14:00] prophet messenger for this age? And you
[1:14:04] begin to see the things that are
[1:14:09] promised and you see those
[1:14:13] promises. You see these things that were
[1:14:18] foretold. You recognize them and you
[1:14:22] understand them. And now you're called
[1:14:28] to step
[1:14:29] out into that promise
[1:14:33] into the land of
[1:14:36] promise. And he he so Abraham had to
[1:14:40] step out and so journey in a land of
[1:14:44] promise. And that's where we are today.
[1:14:47] We're at the hour where we've got to
[1:14:50] start going into the land of promise.
[1:14:56] what's promised to
[1:14:57] us. And so I'd like
[1:15:01] to read a little bit and talk as we go
[1:15:07] uh out of the message
[1:15:11] um proving his
[1:15:13] word because God has chosen you
[1:15:18] to fulfill the promises of this age.
[1:15:28] And now he wants you to have the faith
[1:15:31] of
[1:15:32] Abraham. I have received this promise.
[1:15:37] I know this promise is mine.
[1:15:41] I believe that God is
[1:15:44] not that there is a God,
[1:15:48] but God is
[1:15:51] and he is a
[1:15:54] rewarder of those that seek him.
[1:16:01] Not that there's a
[1:16:03] God or I know there's a God. But when
[1:16:07] you say, "I believe that that God is,"
[1:16:09] in other words, I believe God's got a
[1:16:10] plan. I believe that everything that's
[1:16:14] happening is happening according to his
[1:16:17] word and his will.
[1:16:21] And I don't want unbelief
[1:16:25] to affect me.
[1:16:27] I'm going to have to realize that my
[1:16:30] calling, if it's the faith of Abraham,
[1:16:34] is going to have to be the same faith of
[1:16:37] Abraham. That I'm going to have to step
[1:16:40] out
[1:16:44] believing that these promises that God's
[1:16:47] given me for this age will come to pass.
[1:16:51] that there's potential in that promise
[1:16:54] to do exactly what God said. And Abraham
[1:16:58] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:17:02] because he believed and knew that God
[1:17:05] was able to perform that which he
[1:17:08] promised.
[1:17:10] Abraham didn't do
[1:17:14] anything within himself
[1:17:17] except
[1:17:19] believe. Right. That what God promised
[1:17:23] would happen.
[1:17:29] Now, we're the children of Abraham.
[1:17:32] So, as I read these little statements
[1:17:34] and we go through
[1:17:38] them, so you're going to have to be
[1:17:42] meant on the same ground.
[1:17:47] You're going to have to be in the same
[1:17:48] place Abraham
[1:17:50] was. You're going to have to be in the
[1:17:52] same place the disciples
[1:17:54] were. Every age has got a place where
[1:17:58] they look
[1:18:00] around. They recognize the hour that
[1:18:03] they're in. They recognize the promises
[1:18:07] for that hour. They accept the promise.
[1:18:12] Amen. And then they stepped out based on
[1:18:15] not what they
[1:18:17] see, not what they
[1:18:19] hear, not what they feel,
[1:18:22] not what they smell,
[1:18:25] but they walk out
[1:18:28] solely in
[1:18:31] obedience to the promise
[1:18:37] knowing that God is able to keep that
[1:18:41] promise.
[1:18:44] Amen. Nothing else.
[1:18:48] I'd like just uh if
[1:18:50] I there's a couple little statements in
[1:18:52] this I like so much. He
[1:18:56] says, "So, we know that God allotted in
[1:18:59] every age
[1:19:02] uh the word something in that age that
[1:19:06] would come to pass,
[1:19:10] right? In every age he's allotted what
[1:19:16] events would take place, who would be
[1:19:20] called, whose name was written on the
[1:19:23] book, how he would go out and find each
[1:19:27] one of them and bring them in. how h how
[1:19:31] he would seek them
[1:19:33] out and find
[1:19:36] them and choose them and elect
[1:19:40] them and put something in
[1:19:43] them that caused them to respond.
[1:19:48] And then in every age he expected if if
[1:19:52] I could I I don't know if the word
[1:19:54] expect is really the one I want but he
[1:19:57] knew that those people would hear the
[1:20:00] word of God. They would receive the
[1:20:03] revelation and then they'd meet the
[1:20:06] challenge. That's right. of stepping
[1:20:10] out and living their life based on that
[1:20:14] promise
[1:20:16] in the face of every negativity.
[1:20:20] So let's just follow this along if we
[1:20:27] could. He says he so he's talking here.
[1:20:30] He
[1:20:32] says, he says, "Now we see another one
[1:20:37] then you no doubt have heard the saying,
[1:20:41] seeing is
[1:20:43] believing." Okay, we're we're we're
[1:20:45] trying to understand now that we're
[1:20:48] going to move by
[1:20:50] promise, not by any other
[1:20:54] method. by
[1:20:56] promise. That's another old proverb we
[1:20:59] have here, but it doesn't work either.
[1:21:03] It doesn't work because man can sit and
[1:21:07] look right straight at anything and
[1:21:10] they'll not see
[1:21:11] it. The word sea, English word sea, has
[1:21:16] so many different meanings. Sea might be
[1:21:19] a body of water.
[1:21:21] See might mean to uh to to understand.
[1:21:26] See might mean to look at it. Oh,
[1:21:29] there's just all kinds of words you can
[1:21:32] use. But when you say seeing is
[1:21:36] believing, you're mistaken.
[1:21:40] So he's starting to
[1:21:42] eliminate all other avenues
[1:21:46] of faith
[1:21:49] other than promise.
[1:21:52] He doesn't want you to believe on what
[1:21:55] you see.
[1:21:57] He doesn't want you to believe on what
[1:21:59] you feel. He doesn't want you to believe
[1:22:03] on on any other senses
[1:22:08] or
[1:22:09] mental
[1:22:11] capacity other than he gave the
[1:22:18] promise. Because remember in Peter it
[1:22:21] says by these exceedingly great and
[1:22:24] precious
[1:22:25] promises that we are partakers of divine
[1:22:29] nature. So it it's it's not what how
[1:22:35] your life is. It isn't your
[1:22:38] righteousness that's is filthy rags. It
[1:22:41] it isn't your
[1:22:43] association. It isn't your church. It
[1:22:46] isn't your upbringing. It's not your
[1:22:49] family. It's not who you were born to.
[1:22:51] It comes down to one thing. Have you
[1:22:54] received the promise?
[1:23:01] Has God promised you anything?
[1:23:05] The whole book's full of
[1:23:08] promises. Every
[1:23:10] promise in the
[1:23:12] book is mine. Amen.
[1:23:16] Every chapter, every verse, every line,
[1:23:19] the believer reads this Bible for the
[1:23:23] sole purpose of receiving its
[1:23:29] promises. It's not a history lesson,
[1:23:33] though it is a history
[1:23:37] lesson. It's not
[1:23:40] education, though it is education.
[1:23:45] But really what it becomes to the
[1:23:47] believer, the word of God becomes the
[1:23:50] word of promise.
[1:23:55] Abraham when he received God's promise,
[1:23:59] I'm going to make you the father of many
[1:24:02] nations. You see this mountain, all this
[1:24:04] land that you walk on, it's yours. When
[1:24:07] you see this great thing, I'm giving
[1:24:09] this all to you. Your your seed will
[1:24:11] inherit this land.
[1:24:16] the very redeemer was going to come to
[1:24:19] the land. That's right. And and God had
[1:24:22] a long range plan
[1:24:24] even in the sacrificing of Isaac
[1:24:32] showing that the whole plan of God was
[1:24:36] was was laid out and it was
[1:24:41] working. And Abraham went up there and
[1:24:43] said, "Wait, God promised
[1:24:45] me. He gave me this
[1:24:48] seed. He promised he would be
[1:24:52] heir." So he was willing
[1:24:56] to obey because his faith was in the
[1:25:01] promise, not what he felt, not what he
[1:25:05] seen. And he said, "Wait a minute." He
[1:25:07] said, "God will provide a sacrifice." He
[1:25:10] was prophesying.
[1:25:12] about the lamb of God that was to come.
[1:25:16] Why? Because Abraham and Isaac were
[1:25:21] elected chosen
[1:25:23] pieces of the puzzle.
[1:25:28] And they had their place that they had
[1:25:31] to
[1:25:34] fulfill. So we want to build our faith
[1:25:37] and our faith has to have a resting
[1:25:39] place. So, as we read this, you can see
[1:25:41] it. He says, so we're going to read in
[1:25:45] paragraph 68 of proving his
[1:25:48] word. He says, "When you understand it,
[1:25:53] you believe
[1:25:55] it." Jesus said, "Except a man be born
[1:25:59] again, he cannot
[1:26:02] see the kingdom."
[1:26:05] In other words,
[1:26:07] understand the
[1:26:13] kingdom because the kingdom is the Holy
[1:26:18] Spirit in you.
[1:26:23] So the
[1:26:24] kingdom is the Holy Spirit
[1:26:28] in you.
[1:26:32] All right. A man's born again.
[1:26:36] another his old nature
[1:26:39] dies. Now he has something that's in
[1:26:42] him.
[1:26:44] Now I want to read this next statement
[1:26:46] just for a moment. It really I just read
[1:26:50] it over and over and over and over
[1:26:52] again. The Holy Spirit is the kingdom of
[1:26:56] God in you.
[1:27:00] And then look what he says.
[1:27:03] You have to
[1:27:04] understand what this is in you.
[1:27:13] You have to understand what is this
[1:27:16] spirit that's in me. So God gives me a
[1:27:21] spirit. And we're not going to go into
[1:27:25] how that you got it. Some people get it
[1:27:27] without sensation. Some people got
[1:27:30] there's just a change in their life.
[1:27:33] our our our sister that's going to be
[1:27:36] baptized. Something came along in her
[1:27:38] life. She saw something. She felt
[1:27:40] something. She wants her life to be
[1:27:42] different. God's dealing with her heart.
[1:27:45] She doesn't know it. It's just that
[1:27:47] God's picked her and chosen her to be a
[1:27:50] part of his plan. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:55] And she's going to step out in faith,
[1:27:59] be baptized, do the things, go forward,
[1:28:04] she's now going to go into a land that
[1:28:06] she'd never been before. A land that's
[1:28:09] strange to her.
[1:28:12] and she's going into that land based on
[1:28:15] the
[1:28:19] promise that Jesus will not forsake her
[1:28:23] or leave her
[1:28:25] and will keep her
[1:28:27] and that he's able to perform
[1:28:29] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:28:32] she can ask or think. She's willing to
[1:28:34] step out and go into that land.
[1:28:39] And yet here we sit tomorrow this
[1:28:42] morning and so many of us won't move
[1:28:44] forward into the land of
[1:28:49] faith. Do we
[1:28:53] understand what this is in
[1:29:00] you?
[1:29:03] So do you see
[1:29:05] it? Do you understand what this is in
[1:29:09] you now? This what is in
[1:29:14] you? The Holy Spirit that's in
[1:29:18] you, the seed that God put in
[1:29:23] you, you've got to understand
[1:29:26] it. Now, what is this
[1:29:31] spirit that God put in you? What is the
[1:29:35] whole purpose of the spirit of God is to
[1:29:40] fulfill the word of God.
[1:29:46] Absolutely. Now, this spirit's in
[1:29:50] you. It's driving
[1:29:53] you. It's got a plan. It's got a
[1:29:56] purpose. It It's got to get you to the
[1:29:59] place. It's got to reveal the promises.
[1:30:02] It's got to have you come to the spot
[1:30:05] because it's driving you to fulfill the
[1:30:09] promise.
[1:30:13] It's not an anointing
[1:30:17] only if I could use that. The word
[1:30:19] anointing is got great avenues.
[1:30:23] It's not a feeling. This spirit that God
[1:30:27] puts in you and calls you, forgives you
[1:30:30] of your trespasses, chooses you just
[1:30:32] like he did Abraham. Now, this spirit
[1:30:35] that is in you that he gave you has one
[1:30:41] quest. It has one journey. It has one
[1:30:46] thing on its mind. Fulfill the promise
[1:30:50] of God.
[1:30:57] It's kind of it's it's like you get
[1:31:01] it now. You've got a path set before you
[1:31:06] and a plan set before you to fulfill the
[1:31:09] word of God for your age.
[1:31:14] The word of God must be fulfilled.
[1:31:20] That's what Jesus said.
[1:31:22] All
[1:31:25] scriptures must be fulfilled.
[1:31:33] Why? The spirit that was in
[1:31:36] him took him to the
[1:31:39] cross, resurrected him. Because the
[1:31:42] spirit that's in
[1:31:45] you is not for
[1:31:48] you
[1:31:50] to go out and be able to lay your hands
[1:31:54] and do works in all this.
[1:31:57] That's not the goal
[1:32:00] of the spirit that's in you. This goal
[1:32:03] of the spirit that's in you is to
[1:32:05] fulfill the word of promise for this
[1:32:07] age.
[1:32:10] He's chosen you to fulfill the word of
[1:32:14] promise for the age. And and we'll go uh
[1:32:19] I'm going to have a close here pretty
[1:32:21] quick. He said, "You have to understand
[1:32:26] what this is in you.
[1:32:29] What is this thing in me? What's it
[1:32:32] doing with me?
[1:32:35] Why is it leading me the way it's
[1:32:37] leading me? That's right. Cuz it's got
[1:32:40] to fulfill all scripture
[1:32:44] must be fulfilled. There's going to be a
[1:32:46] bride without spot or wrinkle.
[1:32:51] The spirit in you has got one thing in
[1:32:53] mind. I've got to take this personal
[1:32:56] that God put me in and make them a part
[1:33:00] of that spotless
[1:33:02] bride. Amen.
[1:33:05] I've got to take this person and have
[1:33:08] them go into all the world and preach
[1:33:10] the gospel. I've got to take this person
[1:33:13] and have them build the statue of a
[1:33:16] perfect man. I've got to take this
[1:33:18] person and fulfill everything that God
[1:33:22] said in his word. I I'm I'm driven
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:27] to take the person that's received me
[1:33:32] and make them fulfill every promise in
[1:33:36] this book.
[1:33:40] And he don't care whether Peter said,
[1:33:42] "Think it not strange at the fiery darts
[1:33:47] of your enemy at the trying of your
[1:33:49] faith which is more precious.
[1:33:53] than gold.
[1:33:56] You got to understand where the spirit's
[1:33:58] taking us. There's so much confusion.
[1:34:04] Just get the
[1:34:05] spirit. Do you got the
[1:34:09] spirit? Well, how do you
[1:34:12] know whether you got the
[1:34:16] spirit? You know whether you got the
[1:34:19] spirit by where it's taking you.
[1:34:26] Now listen,
[1:34:29] okay?
[1:34:30] And the only way you'll understand it is
[1:34:35] to compare what it makes you do with the
[1:34:41] Bible said it would make you do.
[1:34:48] So what's the spirit do? It fulfills the
[1:34:51] promise. So what's the promise for this
[1:34:54] age? What did God promise to do? He's
[1:34:57] got a promise for every age. He He
[1:35:00] elects the people. Now the spirit is
[1:35:04] going to take those
[1:35:06] people and he's going to move them to
[1:35:11] fulfill the promise of the age, not
[1:35:15] another age.
[1:35:18] We're not building boats,
[1:35:24] right?
[1:35:25] But it's going to compare what it does
[1:35:29] with the Bible.
[1:35:32] Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, the lady of
[1:35:37] seeing church age, all the things that's
[1:35:40] promised. Now, this person can look out
[1:35:43] and see, is the spirit that's in
[1:35:47] me
[1:35:49] fulfilling the
[1:35:51] promises of the hour? Because the spirit
[1:35:54] only moves by promise. Let's just keep
[1:35:58] reading. And so, Brother Ben goes and
[1:36:02] talks about a bottle of water. You know,
[1:36:05] I see the bottle of water, but now I
[1:36:07] close my eyes, I don't see it. So, I
[1:36:10] feel it, right? And so now I I know the
[1:36:13] bottle of water's there because I feel
[1:36:15] it. Okay. Now I don't feel it, but I I
[1:36:19] know the bottle of water's
[1:36:21] there because I can smell
[1:36:24] it. No, I can't see it and smell it, but
[1:36:27] maybe it's there
[1:36:29] because I can hear it.
[1:36:34] Okay. But if I have a promise, I don't
[1:36:38] need any of those.
[1:36:40] Yes, that's right. Now, I'm going to
[1:36:43] understand the spirit that's in
[1:36:46] me. The spirit in me is not interested
[1:36:49] in the your sight. He He's He really are
[1:36:53] not He's not interested in all the
[1:36:55] problems that you've got yourself in cuz
[1:36:59] he'll get you out. Cuz he's got a job to
[1:37:02] do. And his job is to get you to fulfill
[1:37:07] every promise no matter what he has to
[1:37:09] do.
[1:37:14] Just like Abraham. Well, hey, Abraham's
[1:37:16] got a job to do. Sorry, king.
[1:37:25] But I've got I picked him
[1:37:29] to fulfill something and he's going to
[1:37:32] fulfill it.
[1:37:35] And no wonder brother Ram says you can
[1:37:36] save yourself and God a lot of trouble.
[1:37:41] Understand the spirit that's in you.
[1:37:47] You look at all your
[1:37:49] troubles. I don't care how bad your home
[1:37:52] life is. I don't care how bad anything
[1:37:54] is. If you can anchor in a promise
[1:37:58] and know the spirit of God is going to
[1:38:02] fulfill that promise in this age and
[1:38:05] he's elected and chosen
[1:38:08] you to be part of the
[1:38:11] plan that fulfills it.
[1:38:14] We'll
[1:38:15] just
[1:38:21] uh we'll just read
[1:38:23] here. He says now he says faith must
[1:38:28] have a resting
[1:38:31] place, right? It's got to have something
[1:38:34] it believes. So it can't believe in
[1:38:37] sight because we can disprove it.
[1:38:41] It can't believe anything that can be
[1:38:43] disproven wrong is wrong. For we know
[1:38:46] that that none of those things five
[1:38:48] senses is evidence of things hoped for.
[1:38:52] If you smell it, you know it's there.
[1:38:55] You're not still hoping for it.
[1:38:58] But you've got the
[1:39:01] promise. And the promise is that God
[1:39:05] will perform what he promised.
[1:39:08] Now, the
[1:39:09] spirit is going to
[1:39:13] get you like it did to Abraham to move
[1:39:19] out into that land of promise.
[1:39:24] Step out in
[1:39:26] faith like your soul journeying in a
[1:39:29] place that you've never been
[1:39:32] before. But your faith has got to
[1:39:35] anchor. I'm not afraid to make this
[1:39:37] step. I'm not afraid to make that step.
[1:39:40] God promised he'd be with me. He
[1:39:43] promised he'd never leave me nor forsake
[1:39:45] me. He provided that he'd provide all
[1:39:48] things. I'm walking out in faith. I'm
[1:39:51] believing. I'm resting in the promise.
[1:39:55] And the spirit that's in me,
[1:39:59] only
[1:40:00] identifies with the promise.
[1:40:03] That's right. Amen.
[1:40:05] doesn't identify with everything else
[1:40:07] that's going on in the world.
[1:40:12] We do.
[1:40:14] It don't.
[1:40:16] Let's just read. I'll I'll be done just
[1:40:18] a few
[1:40:20] minutes. I
[1:40:22] think faith must has a resting place.
[1:40:25] Anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:40:28] God, faith in God have no resting place
[1:40:33] unless it's
[1:40:36] a promise
[1:40:38] of God.
[1:40:45] Unless it's a
[1:40:50] promise. God can't do anything other for
[1:40:53] you than what he promised he would do.
[1:41:00] Brother Brand will go on to say it. He
[1:41:02] says, "You can say to the son, be
[1:41:08] still and it ain't going to change
[1:41:12] because it's set in order." Amen.
[1:41:18] is a
[1:41:20] plan and you're not going to change the
[1:41:23] plan of
[1:41:24] God. So, let's just read
[1:41:27] on. Unless it's a promise and and there
[1:41:33] it takes its eternal
[1:41:37] stand. It's a promise.
[1:41:42] The spirit in
[1:41:46] us is to bring to
[1:41:49] pass the promises of God to us.
[1:41:55] It's not a shiver.
[1:41:57] It's not a quake.
[1:42:01] It it's it's not a feeling.
[1:42:04] It's not a worship.
[1:42:07] It's got one goal. To take you from out
[1:42:10] of this world, buildeth in you the
[1:42:13] character and stature of a perfect man,
[1:42:16] and prepare you for the rapture.
[1:42:24] All the other stuff that's going on is
[1:42:27] just the great battle in your mind.
[1:42:32] Now, watch this this morning.
[1:42:36] But in the face of all
[1:42:40] these undoubting
[1:42:43] ages and things that we have went
[1:42:46] through and live in
[1:42:49] today, the worst of all, in the face of
[1:42:54] all this
[1:42:55] doubt, God goes God does go right on
[1:43:02] proving his word to be right
[1:43:07] as he has in every age.
[1:43:14] Don't matter what rises up, don't matter
[1:43:17] how evil it gets. It don't matter how
[1:43:20] dark it's it. God's going to go right on
[1:43:23] proving his word. The spirit of God
[1:43:27] is going to continue to take you to
[1:43:32] fulfill what's promised. Hallelujah.
[1:43:35] Now, that's what the spirit of God is
[1:43:37] doing now. He's trying to take this
[1:43:40] bride, not just to study it and go over
[1:43:44] it and and turn the pages and reread the
[1:43:48] quotes over and over again. Is trying to
[1:43:51] get this bride to perform that which was
[1:43:54] promised.
[1:43:56] Amen.
[1:44:01] You don't think you have power in his
[1:44:03] word. The prophet God God finally looked
[1:44:05] at him. He says, "Why cry?
[1:44:11] I called you. I elected you to lay hands
[1:44:16] on the sick, not the ministry. You
[1:44:24] to cast out demons." Amen.
[1:44:28] You don't just cast out demons by having
[1:44:30] a a a
[1:44:33] movie, you know, where you're going to
[1:44:35] lay hands and the demon's going to come
[1:44:37] out. You sit down and you tell somebody
[1:44:39] about the love of Jesus Christ. Deliver
[1:44:41] them from drugs, alcohol, you've casted
[1:44:44] out a
[1:44:46] demon. Yes, sir.
[1:44:50] When you move Satan out of the house
[1:44:54] and by the word of faith, you being
[1:44:56] Christ into that house, you've cast out
[1:44:59] a devil.
[1:45:01] You've evicted
[1:45:04] the occupancy.
[1:45:07] And that's what the spirit of God's
[1:45:09] going to do. He's going to have a people
[1:45:11] in this age that's going to hunt.
[1:45:14] Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] for their body parts.
[1:45:25] Amen. They're going to hunt for those
[1:45:27] that that make them whole.
[1:45:30] They're
[1:45:31] sojouring and a land of stranger. In
[1:45:34] other words, he didn't say, "Oh, I'm in
[1:45:36] the land now. It's all
[1:45:39] over." No, he he kept walking. The
[1:45:43] spirit kept driving him. God had a plan.
[1:45:47] Oh my, we could
[1:45:49] stay the the whole gospel
[1:45:54] forever. He said,
[1:45:56] "Unbelief doesn't stop
[1:45:59] God. It doesn't hinder
[1:46:02] him." Now, you've got to understand
[1:46:06] this because you're going to meet all
[1:46:08] the
[1:46:09] opposition. You're going to meet all the
[1:46:11] unbelief.
[1:46:13] You're going to meet all the criticism.
[1:46:16] You're going to meet everybody's ideas,
[1:46:18] everybody of how it should be. You'll
[1:46:21] even meet your own idea of how you think
[1:46:25] your life ought to be.
[1:46:30] If I was a Christian, I wouldn't have a
[1:46:32] trouble. If I had faith, I wouldn't have
[1:46:34] a great big growth on my neck.
[1:46:39] Well, he didn't promise me I wouldn't
[1:46:40] have a growth.
[1:46:42] He promised me when the growth would
[1:46:44] come, he'd take care of it.
[1:46:51] I didn't put my confidence in the
[1:46:53] doctor. In fact, the doctor I don't want
[1:46:55] to say it that way, but
[1:46:58] anyway. Yeah, he messed it
[1:47:02] up. It got all
[1:47:05] infected. It was terrible.
[1:47:09] I'm eating these antibiotics until I my
[1:47:11] blood inside of me I don't even think's
[1:47:13] real blood anymore. Alls I got in me is
[1:47:16] an antivirus. I got uh you know
[1:47:20] macafferty running in my veins or Norton
[1:47:24] or something, you know, just fighting in
[1:47:26] my body. You know, I'm just looking for
[1:47:28] some strength. I'm looking for some
[1:47:30] life. You know what I mean? I'm walking
[1:47:32] around like a zombie. But that don't
[1:47:34] matter. You know what that spirit in me
[1:47:36] is going to do? I'm going to fulfill the
[1:47:38] promise. If I got to drag you across the
[1:47:40] finish line,
[1:47:46] the Holy Spirit had to drag Abraham
[1:47:49] through all those deals
[1:47:53] cuz he was a part of the plan. He was
[1:47:56] chosen. God elected and chosen him to
[1:47:59] fulfill his word in him in this day. And
[1:48:02] the word must be fulfilled. And the
[1:48:04] understand the spirit that's in you,
[1:48:07] that spirit that's in you only has one
[1:48:09] goal. To get you to fulfill the word of
[1:48:14] promise that is in you.
[1:48:19] Unbelief doesn't hinder God. I don't
[1:48:22] care how much the world unbelieves. It's
[1:48:24] still going
[1:48:25] to happen.
[1:48:28] Why? It's promised.
[1:48:32] Unbelief doesn't do anything but condemn
[1:48:35] the
[1:48:37] unbeliever. The unbelief will send the
[1:48:40] unbeliever to hell. It'll rob him of
[1:48:44] every blessing God promised to
[1:48:48] him. But it doesn't hinder God from
[1:48:51] going right on with the believer. So
[1:48:55] unbelief doesn't stop God. It only stops
[1:48:59] the unbeliever.
[1:49:02] Don't let the unbeliever stop you.
[1:49:10] No matter how many woes they say, or how
[1:49:14] many fears if you step out on
[1:49:17] faith, oh, this is going to happen and
[1:49:20] that's going to happen.
[1:49:25] Wait a minute. Unbelief don't stop God.
[1:49:29] All right. The spirit that's in me, I'm
[1:49:33] going to step out into that land. Oh,
[1:49:36] what happens if it doesn't
[1:49:38] happen? What's going to happen to your
[1:49:40] testimony? Do you know success and
[1:49:45] failure launches from the same spot,
[1:49:51] the same position, the same launching
[1:49:54] pad.
[1:49:56] Everybody that succeed and everybody
[1:49:59] that fails stands in one spot.
[1:50:03] The failure was ruled by
[1:50:07] fear. The success is ruled by faith.
[1:50:13] Why am I not going to fail?
[1:50:18] Look at yourself, David. You're
[1:50:22] crank. You're mean. You're an alcoholic.
[1:50:25] You're a a drug user. Uh you're you're a
[1:50:32] work slave. Uh you know what I mean? You
[1:50:35] you you can't remember two sentences in
[1:50:38] a a row. Uh you know, how are you going
[1:50:41] to be successful?
[1:50:45] One way only. Yes, sir. By
[1:50:51] promise. That's right.
[1:50:53] He promised me. Yes, he did.
[1:50:57] That if he started the work, he would
[1:51:00] finish it. He promised me that he would
[1:51:04] not leave me nor forsake me. He promised
[1:51:07] me nothing could pluck me out of the
[1:51:10] palm of his hands. And the spirit that
[1:51:13] in in me only identifies with the
[1:51:16] promised word of God.
[1:51:19] Amen.
[1:51:22] Not the shivers, not the shakes, not the
[1:51:25] worship, not the miracles. It stands on
[1:51:27] the promises of God alone.
[1:51:34] God will not do for you anything other
[1:51:36] than that which he promised.
[1:51:43] The spirit wants in you is trying to
[1:51:47] connect with a promise.
[1:51:51] is trying to lead you to a promise.
[1:51:59] The spirit of God is to bring you into
[1:52:02] remembrance of all
[1:52:05] things that he said and
[1:52:08] promised. You say, "How do I know I got
[1:52:11] the Holy Ghost?" How is it leading you?
[1:52:16] Is it leading you to act upon the
[1:52:19] promise?
[1:52:23] Satan knows everything I know this
[1:52:25] morning.
[1:52:28] He just don't have the promise I have.
[1:52:34] He can fail, but I can't.
[1:52:38] I can make
[1:52:40] mistakes. I can cause a lot of wrecks,
[1:52:43] right?
[1:52:44] I can mess up a lot of things,
[1:52:48] but none of that
[1:52:50] stops God.
[1:52:53] Your own unbelief doesn't stop God.
[1:52:57] Now, he may have to work you over
[1:53:01] to make you desperate, but he's not
[1:53:03] going to lose. That's right.
[1:53:06] He said,
[1:53:10] he says, "But it doesn't hinder God from
[1:53:13] going right on with the believer." See,
[1:53:15] the unbeliever doesn't stop God. It only
[1:53:18] stops the unbeliever. You say, "The sun
[1:53:21] ain't going to shine tomorrow. I'm going
[1:53:23] to stop
[1:53:25] it. You try
[1:53:27] it." All right? You can't do it. God has
[1:53:31] set it in order and said that it would
[1:53:35] shine and it's going to shine. That's
[1:53:41] all. God selected
[1:53:44] you to be a
[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:48] fulfillment of the
[1:53:50] promises of Lady Oia and the promises of
[1:53:55] his bride in this age.
[1:53:58] And if you get the
[1:54:00] spirit, the spirit is going to conform
[1:54:04] to the word of God.
[1:54:08] It doesn't have its own agenda.
[1:54:12] And you can't take the spirit and try to
[1:54:16] use it to perform your agenda.
[1:54:21] We could go into false anointed ones at
[1:54:24] the end time.
[1:54:27] He
[1:54:28] says in order it would shine, it's going
[1:54:32] to shine. He said it would, and there
[1:54:35] might be some clouds under it, but it's
[1:54:38] still shining just the same. And you
[1:54:41] can't stop God with
[1:54:44] that. How does he make his word known to
[1:54:47] the
[1:54:49] people? First, God knowing that there
[1:54:52] would be
[1:54:54] unbelievers. Now watch the wisdom of
[1:54:57] God. Knowing there would be
[1:55:01] unbelievers and how the majority would
[1:55:05] be
[1:55:06] unbelievers. By his fornowledge, he
[1:55:10] predestinated a seed for every age that
[1:55:14] would believe it.
[1:55:18] That's a promise.
[1:55:24] Now, if you'll notice in
[1:55:28] there, for each age goes right on with
[1:55:32] the word, his
[1:55:34] word, everything right on time.
[1:55:38] Nothing's hindering
[1:55:43] God. I don't care how bad it
[1:55:46] gets, he goes right on. every click is
[1:55:51] moving just exactly right. We think
[1:55:55] sometimes it's not going to work right.
[1:55:59] But don't you worry, his clock is timed
[1:56:04] just exactly to the split instance and
[1:56:09] everything's working just exactly
[1:56:13] right.
[1:56:17] Lord, how come I don't got work? How
[1:56:18] come this isn't happening? How come
[1:56:21] that, you know, God might have to get
[1:56:22] you into a certain spot so he can kind
[1:56:25] of get the message to you that he's been
[1:56:27] trying to get to you?
[1:56:32] What do you do when everything falls
[1:56:33] apart?
[1:56:38] Do you do you do you uh do
[1:56:41] you put all your hope in uh you know Zip
[1:56:51] Recruiter? Oh, I sure hope Zip Recruiter
[1:56:54] comes
[1:56:55] through. Wait a minute, Lord. It's your
[1:56:59] word.
[1:57:01] I want to work. I want to be in a place
[1:57:04] where my light can shine. I'm promised
[1:57:06] that you'd set my light on the
[1:57:09] hillside. Job don't even come into it.
[1:57:14] Job
[1:57:16] secondary. It's what's the promise?
[1:57:19] What's the promise for my age? What's
[1:57:21] the promise for me of believers? What
[1:57:24] promises do I
[1:57:26] have? If I was to go down the aisle this
[1:57:29] morning and say, "Give me exceedingly
[1:57:31] great and precious promise that God gave
[1:57:33] you." What promise do you have for God
[1:57:35] to you? What's your promise? What's your
[1:57:37] promise? You tell me a promise. You know
[1:57:39] what we'd get? We'd get an
[1:57:48] F. Nobody would grab a hold of
[1:57:51] it. Job did.
[1:57:54] He went through all that stuff
[1:57:57] so he could get one revelation
[1:58:01] that there was a resurrection. You say,
[1:58:03] "What's Job's promise?" Job said,
[1:58:05] "Though the skin worms eat my flesh, yet
[1:58:08] I'll see God." Hallelujah.
[1:58:16] You listen to this
[1:58:18] message and you read your Bible to get
[1:58:21] promise.
[1:58:23] Faith only rest in the promise.
[1:58:27] The church is built on the promise. This
[1:58:30] message is built on the promise of
[1:58:33] Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, and Revelations
[1:58:37] 10:7. It was a promise that came to
[1:58:42] pass. That's why we're
[1:58:45] here. Sorry.
[1:58:52] He
[1:58:53] says, he says, "When I look around
[1:58:57] sometimes and see these Rickies and
[1:59:01] Rickheads that we got today on the
[1:59:05] street and how everything's going on, I
[1:59:09] think, oh
[1:59:11] God, ain't that the truth."
[1:59:16] I had some friends of mine, they went to
[1:59:18] a great big gigantic church, gigantic
[1:59:21] church
[1:59:22] in Arizona. They had a great big
[1:59:24] national youth convention and
[1:59:28] concert, you know what I mean? And they
[1:59:31] went
[1:59:32] there. Everybody's running around in
[1:59:34] shorts and tank tops and and you know,
[1:59:38] their music's just rock and
[1:59:41] roll and they're sitting there going,
[1:59:44] "Oh, God.
[1:59:46] Oh
[1:59:47] God, don't
[1:59:51] worry. It's all in time. It's all
[1:59:55] happening.
[1:59:57] So if that side of the promise is
[1:59:59] happening, don't you think the other
[2:00:02] side of the promise is happening? Let me
[2:00:05] let me finish this morning. Wait a
[2:00:08] minute.
[2:00:11] He said, "See, my time piece is turning
[2:00:15] just exactly
[2:00:17] right. I've got to put you upon the same
[2:00:22] basis I did the first man in them
[2:00:27] days. I put you on the same basis of
[2:00:30] Luther, on the same basis of Wesley."
[2:00:34] Because you see, sin wasn't known then
[2:00:41] like it is
[2:00:43] now. And when we get more
[2:00:47] knowledge now than we had then, when the
[2:00:51] enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit
[2:00:55] of God raises up a standard
[2:00:59] against it.
[2:01:03] Everything's perfect.
[2:01:06] Listen to what he goes on to say. It's
[2:01:08] all been
[2:01:10] prophesied. It's all right on time.
[2:01:17] The fact
[2:01:18] that boys are becoming girls and girls
[2:01:21] are becoming boys and and and all this
[2:01:25] craziness. Right on time.
[2:01:29] Millions of people right on time. Wars
[2:01:33] and rumors and hatred and violence right
[2:01:36] on time.
[2:01:39] He didn't say we'd fix it.
[2:01:43] He said we'd have victory over it
[2:01:47] and we would find and help all of our
[2:01:52] own out of Sodom and out of Gamora.
[2:02:02] He and now today we've got more
[2:02:05] knowledge, more
[2:02:06] understanding. So the rivers of unbelief
[2:02:09] is flowing in hard, but God raises up a
[2:02:13] standard against it. But
[2:02:16] remember, he always the reason that he
[2:02:20] predestinated these things to
[2:02:23] happen, he fortold them by his prophets
[2:02:27] they would happen. And when the
[2:02:30] righteous see these things
[2:02:33] confirmed, then they know it's right.
[2:02:36] Regardless of what anyone else says,
[2:02:42] you know this message is right. Amen.
[2:02:45] You see the days of Solomon. You see all
[2:02:48] these things that have all been
[2:02:49] predestinated to come to pass. And you
[2:02:51] have a promise that God would send you
[2:02:55] Elijah. You have a promise that he'd
[2:02:57] restore the faith back to the children.
[2:03:01] You had a promise that he would not
[2:03:03] leave your soul in corruption.
[2:03:07] You've got all these
[2:03:09] promises that now in the midst of all
[2:03:11] this unbelief and all this darkness, you
[2:03:15] live according to those
[2:03:18] promises. And he said, "I won't leave
[2:03:20] you nor forsake you, but I'll be with
[2:03:25] you
[2:03:26] even in you till the end."
[2:03:30] No, I am going to fulfill
[2:03:34] in you the role that I predestinated to
[2:03:39] be in you from the beginning. Amen. I am
[2:03:43] not going to fail. And then we'll just
[2:03:45] finish with this this
[2:03:47] statement. He said these things is known
[2:03:52] regardless of what anybody else has
[2:03:53] said. We find out there I believe it.
[2:03:57] First Thessalonians he said he had
[2:03:59] predestinated us to the adoption of
[2:04:02] children by Jesus Christ. God saying God
[2:04:07] not saying I'll choose you and don't
[2:04:11] choose you but by his fornowledge
[2:04:14] knowing what you would do. So he for by
[2:04:18] his fornowledge he set in order and make
[2:04:23] everything to work for his good and for
[2:04:30] your good.
[2:04:33] Do you believe the promise this morning?
[2:04:36] Do you understand? You've got to
[2:04:38] understand the spirit in you.
[2:04:43] the spirit in
[2:04:44] you the
[2:04:47] word and it does one thing only. Jesus
[2:04:50] said, "I must fulfill all
[2:04:53] righteousness. I must fulfill all those
[2:04:56] things that were spoken of me." Can you
[2:05:00] believe that this morning? Can you
[2:05:03] believe that you're that fulfillment of
[2:05:06] God's word? that your
[2:05:10] life that the
[2:05:13] tragedies and the sufferings and the
[2:05:16] things that you've been through your
[2:05:18] life that God will still keep you and
[2:05:21] protect you and he won't lose you cuz he
[2:05:25] promised. Do you believe it? What do you
[2:05:28] have for proof, brother
[2:05:30] McGary? Nothing but a promise.
[2:05:35] What's your evidence? a promise. Why are
[2:05:39] you going to heaven? Because he
[2:05:41] promised.
[2:05:42] How do you know your sins are forgiven?
[2:05:45] He promised.
[2:05:47] He promised if I confess them, he'd
[2:05:50] forgive them.
[2:05:53] How do I know
[2:05:54] anything by promise? What's the spirit
[2:05:58] that in me? I now understand the spirit
[2:06:01] that's in me. I understand where it's
[2:06:05] leading me. I'm not
[2:06:07] confused when the prophet of God said
[2:06:10] the evidence of the Holy Spirit is to
[2:06:13] say amen to every promise of God. I
[2:06:19] begin to understand that now. God bless
[2:06:21] you this morning. I'm going to be uh I
[2:06:24] won't be back here to minister till uh
[2:06:28] communion tonight. Uh and then I won't
[2:06:32] be back till the 22nd of September. I'm
[2:06:35] I'm going on a uh a a a couple week
[2:06:39] vacation of fishing in Canada. So,
[2:06:44] uh would you all stand on the bank and
[2:06:48] tell me to cast my lure here and cast my
[2:06:51] lure there that I can fill my boat with
[2:06:55] an abundance of catch? I let him go
[2:06:59] anyway, but pray for me. Um, I'm weary
[2:07:03] in my spirit and Satan's battling me a
[2:07:06] lot in my mind and and making a great
[2:07:12] struggle because I've got this
[2:07:14] burning in my heart of what I feel the
[2:07:20] path forward for the church is. And I
[2:07:24] believe the path forward is the church
[2:07:27] to start
[2:07:28] acting and
[2:07:31] performing what's been promised to her.
[2:07:35] And it's not sitting in
[2:07:39] camp agreeing that brother Brandham's a
[2:07:42] prophet.
[2:07:44] That's settled.
[2:07:47] Even the world believes Brother Bram's a
[2:07:49] prophet. They'll call him the great
[2:07:52] prophet.
[2:07:55] But that the spirit is not leading them
[2:07:57] to
[2:07:58] fulfill the promise of a bride. And I
[2:08:02] don't care. Don't look in the mirror.
[2:08:05] Don't look
[2:08:06] back. Faith only sees what's promised.
[2:08:12] And faith is the evidence of things
[2:08:15] hoped for, not yet seen. But it holds
[2:08:19] the promise knowing that God which
[2:08:22] promised it is able to perform. That's
[2:08:25] what she promised. Our sisters ready to
[2:08:28] be baptized that you could go around to
[2:08:30] the back. The brothers will help. God
[2:08:32] bless you this morning. Pray for me on
[2:08:34] my vacation. Thank you.
[2:08:38] [Music]
[2:08:50] Amen. Praise God. Let's stand this
[2:08:52] morning.
[2:08:55] Amen. Just want to
[2:08:57] say to me that was the perfect
[2:09:01] understanding of what the Holy Spirit
[2:09:03] is. What is it that's leading you? And
[2:09:06] where is it leading you to? It's God
[2:09:08] performing his word in the believer.
[2:09:11] Amen. Key of F. Amen.
[2:09:16] Oh, pour your spirit out on
[2:09:21] me. Fall just like the
[2:09:25] rain. Oh, and sit

[2:18:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[2:18:12] this morning. Ashley's come to be
[2:18:14] baptized because she wants to be a
[2:18:17] Christian.
[2:18:20] Amen. and she wants God to redirect her
[2:18:23] life and the Holy Spirit to perform all
[2:18:27] the promises that are in the book which
[2:18:30] are her promises to come to pass in this
[2:18:34] life. And so we'll go to the
[2:18:37] scriptures that's found in the book of
[2:18:39] Acts.
[2:18:44] find it
[2:18:48] here in the second
[2:18:51] chapter of the book of Acts, we read
[2:18:53] these uh great words that were
[2:18:59] spoken. It says, "Therefore, let all the
[2:19:02] house of Israel know that assuredly that
[2:19:05] God hath made that same Jesus whom ye
[2:19:10] have crucified both Lord and Christ."
[2:19:13] Amen. Now when they heard this, they
[2:19:16] were pricked in their hearts and said
[2:19:19] unto Peter and the rest of the apostles,
[2:19:22] men and brethren, what shall we do?
[2:19:26] Amen. Great question. Amen. And he gave
[2:19:30] him this beautiful answer.
[2:19:33] Then Peter said unto
[2:19:36] them,"Repent and be baptized, every one
[2:19:39] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:19:43] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:19:47] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." For
[2:19:51] this promise is unto you, and unto
[2:19:55] Ashley, and to your children, your
[2:19:58] children's children, to all them that
[2:20:01] are far off, even as many as our Lord
[2:20:04] our God shall call. And with many other
[2:20:08] words, he did testify and exhort,
[2:20:10] saying, "Save yourself from this up
[2:20:13] towards generation."
[2:20:17] Amen. That's what she's come today.
[2:20:20] to receive the spirit and to escape this
[2:20:25] evil
[2:20:30] generation.
[2:20:35] Our gracious heavenly father according
[2:20:38] to the word of promise to go into all
[2:20:41] the world and preach the gospel to
[2:20:44] baptize them in the name of the father
[2:20:46] the son and holy ghost and by divine
[2:20:49] revelation we know that's the lord Jesus
[2:20:52] Christ we baptize sister Ashley in the
