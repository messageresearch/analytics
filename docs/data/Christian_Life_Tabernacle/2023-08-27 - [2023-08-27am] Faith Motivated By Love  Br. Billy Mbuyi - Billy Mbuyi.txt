August 27, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

heads always just start our service this morning in his presence Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful to just be gathered in a place like this a better a day in that courts than a thousand house Lord your Prophet David had said and so Lord we're gathered here with expectation Lord we're gathered here with a desire on our heart to be able to have a union with your word with you Lord let it not just be words or just plain words of doctrine that hits our ear or our heart but let it be Revelation let it be life that strikes us Lord Jesus Lord in so much that it takes us from the condition that we are and just to reflect more into your reflected image that you want us to be father lower letters just to be able to put away our our ourselves and look more unto you and that I that I don't live for myself but Christ that lives inside of me Lord every day every hour every minute of the day Lord what good would it do to gain the whole world and Lose My Soul Lord is by that precious blood of Jesus Christ that we're redeemed and we know that we have life so we invite you this morning precious father to come and dine with us to speak to us to reveal to us your word Lord Jesus we just ask the blessing over the service and we're just bless you now in Jesus Christ's name amen you can just turn around and shake the hands of somebody tell them welcome to the house of the Lord God bless you as we invite brother Mike this morning amen good morning you may be seated for a few minutes probably one of the most anticipated blessed promises that we have been given to us as the promise of a rapture you know I think that probably not only everyone in this building but Christians and churches everywhere in homes everywhere you know look forward to that hope that promise that one day the Lord will come and catch away his people we don't want to miss that you know as we look at the condition of the world that we're in the struggles and problems and Sorrows of this life we look at how the age is increasingly dark and hopeless you know the Cry of our hearts hopefully gets stronger every day even so come quickly Lord Jesus but you know what's interesting is that word rapture never appears in the scriptures one time doesn't even appear anywhere in the Bible you know it's strange that the word we use most to describe this great promise can be found nowhere in the scriptures and yet Believers all over the world refer to his coming and this blessed hope as the rapture you know great sermons have been preached about the rapture whole fields of study in theology to try to analyze and understand the place that the Rapture and end time events if I place them all in time and understand what that will be like in the last days it's a promise that so anticipated you know it's wrapped in so many phrases and so much theology that you know except for the grace of God one would miss it because they're not looking for it the way he said it would be you know it's always been amazing to me that when God sent his messenger before his face and he began to deal with the subject of the rapture that he didn't go to any of the scriptures that the religious teachers or the theologians of hundreds of years used to teach the rapture he went right on past second Peter 3. right on past first Thessalonians 4 and even Matthew 24 and 25. and he settled on psalm 27. of all places to focus a people on the rapture you know it says in Malachi 3 1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple in Psalm 27 4 says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple you know the messenger preparing the way for his coming directing his people to a place of his appearing by causing them to seek his appearing in a place where he said he would come you know as we read Psalm 27 it maybe causes us to think about the rapture as something different than maybe we had previously thought after hundreds of years of religious teaching since our attention has been brought to this chapter by the messenger it's worth noting some of the interesting statements made in this Rapture chapter in verse 1 it says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid Who Shall I Fear who shall I be afraid of why all the mention of fear verse 3 though and hosts should encamp against me my heart shall not fear notice all the statements he's making this isn't a prayer this is a testimony this is a declaration I have no fear I'm not afraid there's no fear here though an army comes against me to consume me and it will I won't fear the war breaks out against me and it will not fear what's he saying here he's describing being in a place in a position that is free from Fear a place where all fear has been cast out you know this is a totally different picture of the rapture what he's describing here in verse 1 and 3 is the enemies and the foes are still there the armies are still there the wicked are still there there's still war rising up but in spite of everything that surrounds him he's in a place that is totally free from Fear he says it this way in psalm 23. yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me he goes on to say thou prepared a table before me in the presence not the absence of my enemies rapture see Psalm 27 isn't necessarily about being caught up in a place that's free from evil it's about being caught into a place with him that is free from Fear of the evil first John 4 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love the verse just before that verse 17. herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment not freedom from the day of judgment boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world this is about being caught up into a place with him into a place of perfect love free from Fear but still in the world being caught up into a place where perfect love has cast out all fear notice verse 2 when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes still there Came Upon me to eat up my flesh I stood against them and defeated them no they stumbled and fell they came after me to consume me and they fell away why in verse 5. for in the time of trouble how many can say we live in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me He Shall Set me upon a rock he's placing me somewhere he's hiding me somewhere he's putting me in a place where they cannot go the enemy is still there but I'm just being caught up into a place with him where they cannot reach where they cannot go verse 6 and now shall mine ahead be lifted up above might enemies round about me Out Of Reach be not afraid believe only they'll fall away you know Paul describes the Rapture in first Thessalonians 4 17 as being caught up together with him to be caught up to be carried away to be snatched up the idea of being snatched up into a place with him where perfect love casteth out all fear you know I thought as I was reading that am I being carried into such a place am I allowing myself to be carried into such a place you know the thing about fear is it's the opposite of faith and we were taught that Revelation that Rapture is a revelation which is faith but you know it's interesting yeah there's a body change there's a future going into an Incorruptible place but before we can assume a condition there we have to reflect that condition here Psalm 27 4 One Thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord that I may dwell where he dwells as he is so are we in this world all the days of my life not in the afterlife not after this life all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord all the days of my life and to inquire in his Temple all the days of my life let's stand you know as I read that I thought Lord help me bring me to that place of perfect love where no matter what enemy May rage around me I will fear no evil that I may be in that hiding place that place that he went to go prepare for me that where he was where that where I am present tense I may be also as he is so are we in this world one thing have I desired and that will I seek after you know it's no coincidence that the messenger of our hour brought us here to see what Rapture is that secret place caught up into that secret place into that Hiding Place with him you know I don't know about you this morning but my prayer is that I get in this place because it's in this secret place that I can begin to reflect here what will be manifest there just a wonderful chapter you could spend hours going through Psalm 27 let's just read that together starting in verse one the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacles sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord hear O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou said seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anchor thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me o God of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over to the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say I'm the Lord amen so you can have your seats I wanted to sing this song this morning redeem and how I love to

Daughters you called us to you o God you you pulled us out of every hole in the world and Lord you cleaned us and you gave us your grace and your mercy that we could stand in the congregation of saints and speak about your goodness towards oh God Lord if he had not been for your grace and your mercy where would our lives be oh God we only stand here because the grace was being extended to us oh God and we invite you this morning and Lord defense Believers we could be taken back to the time and reminded that we are here not by our own strength and by on our ability but it's the grace of God that came by our way Lord and Lord the scripture says when Adam was running in the Garden of Eden and he had sinned and he was running and Grace Came Calling after him Adam Adam where are you Lord your Prophet tells us it's not a seeking God and but it's you coming after us oh God and we're so thankful for the things that you do we invite you this morning Lord that you may have your will and way in our midst of God and Father that your word may speak to our hearts and that he may change or in a man and that we may be strengthened in order for us to live in overcoming life and Lord we're not here just to gather so we can say we went to church and but we desired to really be pleasing to you and to live an overcoming life and and we pray now by the way of the word may you just come and speak to every soul and all of those that are represented here all of those that will hear Lord that you may take them and father and you may speak to their hearts that they may never be the same oh God be lifted up in our midst this morning we lift your name up oh God we live we give you glory and honor that your name may be lifted up bless the word to us as we commit ourselves to you we remember our pastor this morning we pray father that you be with him and those that are out we ask the door us that have gathered here this morning that you give us something of an eternal benefit Lord that we may say surely was good to be in the hands of God we love you when we commit what we are into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen man God bless you want to welcome everyone in the house of God and all our visitors are certainly happy to have you with us today and amen before we read the scripture just once more I want to make sure you know that our meetings are starting on Friday this next Friday the 1st uh it's the Labor Day weekend the Friday service it's at 7 pm Saturday at six and Sunday at 11 A.M Saturday morning there will be the luncheon and the the the the the the activities and and the games I want to just want to say if you feel you are you've in your heart then you like to come you're welcome to come and and we'll certainly find a place for you amen God bless you this morning Amanda certainly bring you greetings from our pastor and God bless you let's open our scripture this morning are you happy to be in the house of God Amen let's open our Bibles um I thought the psalm reading was very much in line with what I had in my heart and we'll see how that goes let's start with Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians second chapter that says and verse one I believe they said and you had it quickened who were dead in sin and trespass and trespassing sin wherein in time past you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among who also we have had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where we're and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so he's wanting to remind you that you were the same when you look at the world and you see what's happening you were the same you were once the sin that you were once partakers of those things but ye one says them but he's saying now but God who is rich in Mercy now you you have to remember it's God who's rich in Mercy it's not because of your interact and it's not because you were eyes you find out well I'm wasting my time I need to do something better I'll I'll try God and find out no but he said but God who's rich in Mercy for his great love not your love for his great love where we wherewith he had loved us even he says even when we were dead in sin and trespasses Quicken us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and then he says and has raised us up together and made it made us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding Riches of his of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus now yes so he's doing this so that for the for the remaining of our time for eternity we may know about the grace of God we may understand what the love of God is so when we come together and when we talk or when we summarize everything that we know about God it will be all about his grace and his mercy and his love and say none of our works less any man should boast it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus unto good works he says which he had foreign that we should walk in them let's also turn in Hebrews chapter 11 and we'll start from verse one it says now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things that do appear by faith the Abel or for offer unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gift and by it being dead yet speaketh it says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was found and was was found and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he had pleased God he says but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek after him it says by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen yet move with fear prepare an ark to the saving of his house by which by which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to when he was called to God out of his place which it should be he should have received for inheritance obey and went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourn in the land of promise as a strange and in in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacle with Isaac and Jacob the air with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had the foundation whose Builder and maker was God let's just borrow has our gracious father we so thankful to be gathered in your presence once again Lord Jesus where could we say Lord then the prophet said bless the Lord O My Soul forget not all of these benefits and who forgiveth all thy iniquity and who healeth all that diseases Lord you are our all in all Lord and everything that we have need of Lord we find it in you Lord and we ask now that you may take these few words and the words that you have given us oh God from the Bible that we could stand upon them and that you can come and expand them to our hearts and let it be beneficial to someone Lord and that we may say certainly we we have come to the presence of God and you have spoken to us we commit everything to you and us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you may have your seats I I want to speak uh this morning and and I'm pretty sure we won't be able to bring it to a finish but we'll certainly just try to start and and see how far we can get with it and I was inspired by what our pastor has been preaching and in in general is perhaps almost in on the same line speaking of Faith but we will try to narrow it down as we get uh further and further to narrow and and I want to call it uh Faith motivated by love that's really where we want to get to when we get to the end of it Faith motivated by love and that's what we want to uh speak on at the very end and and so the prophet makes a statement in the message on partable sin it said paragraph 150 says for you are not saved by any Works any good works you are not safe by shouting you are not saved by dancing in the spirit you are not saved by speaking in tongue you are not saved by keeping the Sabbath you are not saved by Meat by meat eating you are not safe by joining a church you are say you are not saved by water baptism you are saved by faith you are saved by faith through Grace that you are saved right and it says and if you are truly saved these other things automatically come so the focus of the saving is for is Faith first and it's faith that is launched out it's faith that is presented and then he says all of this other things automatically come you speak with tongue and you you could shout and you can praise God the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet of the to the prophet it says when the pastor sees something wrong he says look looks look sister or look or old brother that's wrong you are it says you are submissive that's right you are submissive the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet you are submissive it says God God forgive me you said God forgive me I didn't mean to get out of order ready it says uh through the church and move on and then he says then you are going to see a church moving for the glory of God it says the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet everything is in order the church set in order so I and I want to say this on the outset the the very Foundation of a Christian Life is Faith you can never go past faith and and and and then get to God any other way because we understand if we are here this morning we we can certainly say we hear because we desire more faith than what we have this morning we we are saved by faith as the scripture says but the measure of faith that we have today we need more measure than what we came in with this morning because rapturing faith is not a different faith is an addition to the faith that we have it's a rapturing faith that comes by the revealing of the word that comes and head on top of what we already know so we have faith we need faith in order for us to overcome in the daily life we need Faith because the scripture will tell us that we faith is the is a faith is what for comes his faith is the victory that overcomes the world even the things of the world and I could say faith is what will give us Victory faith is what will take us from what we are and change us into what God desires for us to be but when I'm says that Faith knows no defeat so if this morning we're coming and we have needs and we have troubles and we have our human nature is bothering us the challenge of the world is bothering us we can come with confidence and say that if I come by the way of faith I will know what victory tastes like because Faith knows no defeat what iranam says that faith faith When Faith speaks everything has to shut up and I thought the problem with us is so many times we do our own speaking and we don't let Faith speak but if we can come to a place and you don't do the talking you let the faith that God has placed within you speak for you you'd have the victory that God promised you'll have but one of them says faith has got muscle and a hairy chest when friends speaks everything has to shut up and I want to say this morning that's the way we need to come that's the way that we need to approach God that's the way we need to approach life in order for us to have the victory that's promised so many times we want to do our own battle but he promised you he will do our battles he'll fight for us he'll provide our daily food he will do all those things and yet we are yet we are we always try to use the element of what we know in order for us to overcome by the scripture says that we walk by faith and not by sight oh and I want to say this so many things of what we do it's so dependent on the information we get in our brains and and and and and and this happened or this is our reaction that happened and this is our reaction and the scripture here says we we walk by faith and not by sight in other words your your God the way he created you and we'll get to it it's talking about the Sixth Sense God didn't make you so you can walk by what you see God didn't create you so you can analyze everything by your senses so you can judge everything by your sense and then and Conquer uh and come up with a response on what you should do and to that situation and see how it's going to work no God created you so you can analyze everything by the faith of God and by the word of God and then from the word of God find a response for you to come up with the the scripture says they just shall live by faith so if you if we are to have life within us if we are to keep life within us it has to be by the way of faith and oftentimes we we let this carnal mind this carnal understanding of the things of the world and and the things that we have learned and and throughout the years and the wisdom we've accumulated we let that lead us instead of being led by faith and I want to say this morning God wants you to consider his word God wants you to consider him and when a situation arises and you're about to make a decision and you're about to go in a certain direction you're about to do something God wants you to put in your mind to consider what he said and to consider his promise for you to consider what he promised he will do for you to consider where he got you out of to consider where he's trying to take you before you can come up to a conclusion he wants you to consider his word he wants you to consider his promise he wants you to take all of that into consideration before you can come up with the final conclusion the scripture will speak and and in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 25 it says therefore I say unto you take no thoughts of your life where ye shall eat or why he shall drink no ye no yet for your body he says what shall he put on he says is it not a life more than meat or the body more than women he says behold the fowls of the year for they so not neither do they reap knew that they got a grain but yet our heavenly father feed him are you not much more than they oh my brother my sister it seems like our lives every decision we made is about how we're going to eat and where we're going to sleep and how we're going to pick our take care of our bills and it seems like if you are not careful that takes precedence over the word of God our decision making is based on our own protection and and what we need to do to protect ourselves against this or against that but the Lord is telling you this morning consider his word the scripture speaks I believe in the Book of Job he said when the young lion when he cries up for it food who gives him food to eat who who provides for him who who makes sure that all of the seasons and all the things works together so they can have their food God does that and he does that and he says until more aren't you more that day then if he can feed the bird he can feed all of those things how much more would he take care of you but yet we are we fail to consider the things that he's given us we fail to consider his word in our decision making and and something will happen and all of a sudden our ego gets bruised our pride gets bruised and we want to show what we can do and we want to use all that we can so we can show we are somebody and we do that by failing to realize that we are have a god a heavenly father who cares about us will say in the message uh perseverance and I want you to hear this it says now paragraph 26 it says now you got five senses in your body God gave you those five senses to contact your Earthly home God gave you those five senses to contact your Earthly home it says that sea taste filled smells here but he says but it has nothing to do with God it says there isn't any one of them that will declare God not one of them he says no no because they are only given to you to contact your Earthly home see test filled smells and here says that has nothing to do with God at all and people rely upon them but you mustn't do that is admonishing us you mustn't do that it says faith is something different faith is the Sixth Sense which which you can cut which cut which can contact God you can only contact God by The Sixth Sense which is Faith he says he that cometh must believe that must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek after him in other words I want to say this if when we come in for our Salvation is by faith for our deliverance is by faith for everything that we have need of is by faith faith what what I'm says is a revelation faith is the gift of God faith is what God gives you in order for you to contact him and and if we have to contact God by faith any other sense is not given for us to contact the only way we can contact him is by faith faith is the only sense that will declare the reality of God in your life oh my when when you were saved it's not because you woke up and said well you know I want to be saved today and you went to the altar or you did and then you feel some tingling and then you say I'm saved no something was dropped in your heart you heard the word of God you believe the word of God and by Faith by believing in what you heard something changed the nature that was inside of you something took you from the things that you used to desire and move you into the other direction what did that Faith did that Faith did that so I want to say this I want you if you want to know God this morning you can only God know God by faith you can only approach him by faith and you can only know him by faith you have to come believing that what I'm hearing is the word of God and by hearing the word of God God will come and take his word and make it a reality to you oh my and then faith and that God he he when we when we we we think I was thinking about this you know oftentimes you know we we come and we are so blessed to to come into the revelation of this message and and I'll say this never forget that it's a blessing that you are sitting here this morning because don't ever take it for granted any second there's a lot that started with you that are not here to this morning there's a lot that came with great enthusiasm and great gifts and they they perform even signs and wonders but today they are not even in the message to begin with so if you are sitting here listening and hearing the word of God it's the gift of God to you so I was thinking this morning I said oh isn't it so amazing now we can you know we're here we hear about predestination and about God's election and and we Rejoice over those things and I want to say this there are people on this Earth they hear the same thing they hear every time you talk about predestination or election they look at you to say well what do you think you are what would you think you something special and now you I I didn't say you were not predestinated or elected I'm just happy to be elected what what makes you so mad about it isn't it amazing they hear the same word they hear the same Prophet speak and to them for some reason it's condemnation it gets them mad and they rejected by you here about the same predestination something within your heart say praise God for predestination I don't know something within my heart just when he hears the word I Rejoice over it and let me tell you this that is faith that is the faith of God you you you stood up this morning and you dress up and you got ready you came you didn't come by your own strength you didn't come by on my faith leaves you up from the bad faith got you ready Fred brought you into the house of God [Applause] I I hope you didn't come because it's your favorite preacher or or it's whatever you you came because you knew I need I have need to hear the word of God and Faith Rose you up to bring you here this morning but and let me say this I'll just jump let me say this you you don't never leave that right don't never get away from that don't don't ever move it needs from that because God is wanting to build upon that anything outside of that is inlay anything outside of what God has built for himself in your heart is working on the intellect so I want to say this but what I'm saying makes it Satan it says to a believer it's the faith of God that's moving and working in you to a believer in other words when when something is going on it's when when you wake up in the morning and you know it's Sunday in the faith and you if if it's something that drops in your heart or your mind to not come in the faith of God begins to work in you the faith of God begin to move in you why because the faith wants to come and hear the word of God because Faith Fades upon the word of God faith grows upon the word of God faith matures in the presence of the word of God faith gains strength in the presence of God I tell the dad you feed him something as faith will die so you you recognize the action of faith in your life you you come and you know and it's not something we come in this morning and say well you know I I don't know if I'm really saved I I really don't know and I say if you don't you need to go to the Altar and let God confirm it to you because I could surely stand here and say that I know what I was capable of I know what I was able to do I I'm a weakness of my own works and then at the same time I know that if I could be moved from this and become someone who's who's in favor whose Hearts is burning for God it cannot be my imagination it cannot be my strength it has to be Faith he has to be God moving in me don't don't don't don't don't don't come you know it's like you go to a doctor you know so many times you go and you know God will do something Supernatural and they'll come in they'll take an x-ray or whatever the case is that said you have this you have that and all of those things that you know the right or death sentence and they hand it over to you and tell you how you're going to die die in a couple of days you come days later they take the same thing and everything they don't find anything instead of testifying to Faith in Supernatural they begin to find the explanation well maybe the machine was not just calibrated right don't do that God comes and he does something Supernatural in your life and then just a couple of days later or months by Satan shows up with a great explanation or you know maybe it wasn't just exactly cancer maybe the picture was not taken in the right angle no faith come on the same God came on the same God changed the situation Faith came and brought to Victory and you gotta you ought to be thanking God for it but if Adam says this in the ever-present present Rock of the ever-present rock it says paragraph 159 it says it says when you are when you are saved listen to this carefully when you are saved God gives you Faith to raise you from to raise you from The Mark of the earth if you can put it out on the screen when you are saved God not your own faith not something you've concocted not you coming up and saying well I'm tired of sin I'm going to get out no God Of Heaven the creator of Heaven and Earth the only Giver of Faith he comes down and he gives you Faith to raise you from The Mark of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what was he what it says what is your faith your faith is that is the act that God did in you to make you a son of God they act that God came by your way when you are down in sin and trespasses and when you didn't hear your way when you don't know the difference between wrong and right when you couldn't help yourself let me say this faith is not for those that can help themselves faith is the gift of God to those that don't know the way they are lost as the girls God comes and he picks you up you know that God did this I couldn't do this myself that's why brother when I'm saying faith is something you know it's not some oh I oh I the Bible I see says this over here no you have to know what's in your heart that I am what I am by the grace of God I am what I am by the grace of God he says your faith is that act that God had did in your heart in you to make you a Son of God you quit your lying you quit your stealing it says you quit your drinking because for your faith Rises you up above it something outside of yourself something that God has deposited in the heart raises you up from all those things and then he says amen if I if you don't do it you don't have faith in you don't have any faith and by faith you are saved and that through faith as much Faith you will relieve you will be released that's how much power you can have because in you dwelleth all the power that makes Heaven and Earth God not a not a a watered-down version of God no God the creator of Heaven and Earth dwells in your heart the trouble about it is we've taken faith we put it here we've taken God we place him over here and so now we're saying I need Faith or do I need God I need faith in order for me faith in God is the same thing faith is God revealing himself in your heart faith is the reality of God born within your heart so you may know who you're talking to oh my he says God dwelling in you and you are a son and the daughter of God Amen there you are but it's your faith you said according to your faith be it unto me if you can't if you thou can't believe all things are possible fairly I say unto you and if you if I say unto you if you say unto this mountain be be moved and don't doubt believe what believe that was that's what you said amen now there's a statement here I want to go back to you it says etch much faith will be released that's how much power you can have now I want you to keep that in your mind we'll come back to it so we will certainly want to do that so and I want to say this uh Power that exists in you as a son and the daughter of God is Not different from the power of creation so so the power that came in and get you out of the mark and the marking and all of those things it's the same power that created heaven and earth God doesn't have different levels of powers where we can discriminate and say well there's one God who created the Earth but then there's another God who saves man no it's the same God it's the same attribute remember the prophet tells you there's only two Powers it's either the power of God or the power of the devil and oftentimes I think so many times here he is but one of them will talk about a man inspired by demons he says he will be ten times stronger and people couldn't help them down they would talk about whether it be a female he talks about a sister they try to hold him down and they will kick and they will his person speaking without even opening your mouth and doing just so much power and the person that couldn't even be a 50 or or 80 pounds or if the devil can possess somebody and cause him to do that how much more can the power of God do in your life this morning hey man it's the power of the Living God he's the creator of Heaven and Earth yet we've taken his power we've reduced it to nothing we've reduced it to a power of healing power of Deliverance and power you know that can just raise you up but you know not too high it's just average we sell ourselves short it's it's a power by faith I want to say this faith is the only Supernatural sense faith is the only Supernatural sense and and I want to be careful in saying this all of your other senses but one of you say they are given to you to communicate with the Earth around you and with the world that you are you are created in but faith is the only sense that's given to you to come to communicate with the supernatural God so faith is the only Supernatural sense you have and I want to say this faith is provided you to you as a Believer to lift you out of this past house that you are closed in don't ever forget it it's given to you to lift you out of this past house this first house all it brings is trouble [Music] it's almost impossible to go a day without a trouble an hour without trouble coming from somewhere oh the children have broken this and this is happening that one did this and this is going on and everything and you're like can I get like 10 minutes of peace yeah you you'll get into the fixing mode every time you got to get this right you got to fix that you got to do this you got to do this oh but let me say this faith is the only Supernatural sense that's given to you faith is given to you oh I love this and the prophet will say this faith is given to you so when you go to the doctor and the doctor gives you a report after they've done all of this scientific everything they've given you the news that there's no hope for you but Abraham says you have the right to petition God so that's when you come and say I need to activate the supernatural sin I need something that's beyond what the five senses are giving me and that's why I said you have to consider God always before you can come up with the final conclusion you have the right to be lifted up from where you are into the presence of God the trouble is we are stuck if if you only operate by the five senses I can't imagine the amount of trouble that's around us I can't imagine new brand new sense that's been created just to disturb you two hundred thousand demon demons like part of what David said they there they're just trying to keep you busy you gotta hunt for this you got to do this you got to do this but Faith takes you out of this world and it brings you into the presence of the Living God faith will tell you what the original Mind Of God was faith will drop something from Heaven faith will cause you to look at the things around you and say they are lying fantasy and I won't take them and faith will come and change the circumstance and let me say this it's given to you to get you out of this Fresh House when your Saints can see when when your your mind runs out of things to think when the doctors give you depression when all the things come to an end you have faith to lift you out of that situation don't ever think that everything that the doctor tells you is the final don't ever let yourself think that whatever report you get from school that and all of that that's the end of you no there's a supernatural God there is someone who created the Heaven and Earth they someone who's responsible for it all that someone who holds your destiny in his hand and he has the final say I want to say this what what we need today more than anything is faith now because remember I say that as much power can be released is based upon faith if we are sitting here today it's because of faith you understand that if we are going to get anything from God it can only be by faith and if we are going to get to some Final Destination it's only faith that will take us there there is no there's no no other way around that we can go outside of faith but what I'm saying says faith Faith he talks about in the message a super sense he says and the super sense is the Holy Ghost Faith the faith of God that dwells in you and if you will let that fire if you let the five cents yield to The Sixth Sense it will guide you and bring all other senses under control of the super sense so now he's he's lining up for you is basically giving you the order of operation to understand that as a believer not just the sixth sense but all of my senses have to line up to where the Sixth Sense is controlling the five sense where the it's not you letting the enemy attack you by the five cents and loosen it but having the Sixth Sense bring calm to the other senses so he says for it's so far above the natural senses the natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it's far as high as the heavens is above the natural man as the five senses it says it makes you believe things that you cannot see it says it makes you act where you would do to think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch the super sense that's far beyond he's Rich that comes from God it's called faith faith is that great thing oh it's the only sense that's above all the other senses it's the sense that the devil cannot touch it's the sense that God drops him and reveals to you what's about to happen and you are at peace no matter what trouble is around you it says and the five senses doesn't control the sixth sense but the six says control the five senses the super sense control natural senses and the five sense as the five sense is see taste filled smell here and the super sense is something that's make you that that makes you that make you believe God's word for for that's the only thing that he will speak about that he would speak about and he makes you believe for things that you can't see test mail failed here because it takes God's word and it will deliver that word to you and and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is there any other thing there be but God's word by faith faith does that Faith does that makes this interesting statement and I just put them all together so for the sake of time so so I don't take too much time it says faith is not what you feel faith is not what you feel faith is what you believe you you don't want your Measure of Faith to be directly related to how you feel because then every morning your faith is like ground level until you've had your coffee or you'll express her your whatever it is that you do or when everything goes and your faith God comes diving with it good yes preach it's not attached to emotion faith is not a myth we think faith is in some type of imagination of some reality that don't exist it says no faith is not an imagination faith is something you know that's why I said here frankly something you know and let me repeat it again we have to be built on the right foundation of faith we have to be built upon the foundation of faith that God started not that we have amassed and gathered and figured out what God is and what God is Not faith is only based upon what God did so in other words every time you come to God you have to remind him of what he has done [Applause] to start on the right foundation you have to be based not what he did for someone over here no God I am here because you saved me you took me out of sin I didn't know who you were I wasn't looking for you I'm not a good person I'm not this you made me what I am you chose me you Reveal Your word to me you come and you brought me out of my family you brought me out of my country you set me up at this faith I'm coming on the basis of that and saying I have a need [Applause] that's the foundation oftentimes we operate on the foundation that's not ours come on that's good we come on the foundation of of things we have intellectually put together you know goddess and this God did this then you can come and now you are on the right foundation now you can stand there and you can say you put me out and you did this just like you did in the Bible and you promised that if I come my word just like you did for Enoch just like you did for Joshua that's like you did for such inside I am coming on the same basis because those people didn't get to where they were by themselves you place them there you call them you chose them so the same God who called them the same God who called me I am coming to you now Foundation of faith faith is not something you manufactured God Of Heaven and Earth and you created the planes and the mountains and you created the axis of the earth and you keep it stabilized foreign we think we are trying to impress God we can't impress God he knows all about us he knows when we're faking it or you know oh Lord I love you he knows there's nothing that identify what you're saying that's right if we can only be honest God right now I I don't feel right I I don't feel like it I I I I I I feel like my love has gone down I feel like I'm not done fire the way I used to be I don't feel like I'm a Christian I don't feel stop there he will identify himself to you he will find you somewhere remember but when I'm said God a job was looking for a go-between he was looking for someone who can take his word interpret it to a living God here's a sinful man and all he knows is he didn't do anything wrong and he's trying to justify himself but yet before the holy God nothing can touch him everything is sin so job said that he needed someone who can come and put one hand on the sinful man and another God or another hand on the holy God a god between something who understand both sides we have a petitioner we have even Jesus Christ he was 100 man he was 100 God he knows the issues concerning man he knows she's concerning God that's the only place man and God can come together is by Jesus Christ that's why the prophet said there's only one place that God meets a man under the shed blood of Jesus Christ someone who can bring them both together who understand your need who understand the depths of your heart who understand your frustration sorry I don't think I'm going to be gone anyway but what I'm says faith is not a hope so you know Christians sometimes will become like people just throwing out throw everything that you can and see what will stick anybody can identify with that that's not God we can't come it's not by chance it's not oh I don't know what works but you know I'm good with it and then next time you come you play the same game no that's not the relationship he's looking for faith is something you know you can come every time and get the same result it says it's not a hope so or it could be right it's got to be absolutely a man good you're finding all of them let's get let's get it's got to be absolutely a man an absolute but when it says faith final resting place is the word of God a firm foundation something that doesn't sink it will be the same yesterday today and forever it will produce the same results every time what would the prophet say that if any man ever come the same way that the other men came God was obligated to do the same thing he says it's absolutely amen it's the ultimate it's your absolute it's the thing that that you are tied to Faith is not scientific in other words I've learned and I've studied a Bible and and somehow I feel like I can figure that God out so many times I like to respond to brother Brandon people will come and say oh you you don't know your Bible you don't understand why would you say this and then says you know I don't know that you may be right I may not know my Bible but I know the author real well I understand the reveal it real well because if I if if I'm let me say this the ground upon which you are standing is the ground of Faith it's always built upon the work that God did he knew that I'm standing here because an angel told me to do this yeah he said if you think what I'm saying is wrong you come and stand to my right hand because he knew who was standing there if you think you can correct me come stand to my right nobody ever did and now there are all kinds of critics raise up and everything where were you faith is truth faith is something that you know positive positive off faith is nothing you guess at Faith is what you know faith is the key but what I'm saying is in a message only believe it says now it says now it says now if we who have who are acquainted with a supernatural we'll just take a man where man where the man in his senses is limited by his senses but man in his spirit is unlimited the tree of knowledge can only can only climb so far and breaks back but the Tree of Life Goes On forever and how that science can take man father with his senses than we have with his soul it says well with God on top resources where all things are possible talk about the split of an atom and let me say this a Believer by faith you are being given access to resources that the world knows nothing about we we have to come with an understanding that I have been given access to every promise in the Bible by faith that I'm not coming by guessing or by trying to figure this thing out I'm coming because by faith I'm being given access to the whole entire Bible and let me say this this morning this book is the record of people that live by faith and what they were able to produce and the prophet came and told you in this age that we are going to write another book of Acts in other words people that have received the word of God that are supposed to produce works that are according to the same Bible this is the record of What Faith Can Do so if you have faith and you have a problem just go read the book of record okay what's going on here what's my problem well you know I have a sickness that the doctor says they can't help me oh really let me see if it's in the record Oh by faith the woman with a blood issue he came and he touched Jesus and by touching Jesus his blood problem was gone I have a record therefore I come before God oh Lord of Heaven and Earth I have a problem and I found it in the book of record I am coming upon the same basis so I can receive the same result [Music] where do you put your faith in the application of faith and let me jump forward and say this every person that you read in this book that had claimed to have faith there was some action attached to it by faith Enoch by faith Moses they're insane by faith Moses he just said in the house of pharaoh and he was contented with what he was and everything just went fine and after years he became king and then he let the children of God go no by faith he refused The Possession not the world had given him he rejected everything that the five senses had told him he went out into the Wilderness by faith God came and he testified to thy faith and what about him says God came an anointed our faith when God anointed our faith Moses came and he did the job that he was placed to do what we is an anointing of our faith God I know you place me here to be a pride you blessed me here to be an overcomer I need an anointing of that Faith so I can express what's inside of me to express but it's only by faith what when I'm says faith is the master of all circumstances notice now his haves faith perfect faith is the master of our circumstance perfect Faith Masters all circumstance listen now he says no matter what it is it Masters it no matter what it is a masters in now just watch when you believe anything do anything will you go you got faith in what you are doing no matter what the circumstance is don't have one thing to do with it see it Masters that circumstance if it's if it's in the room of of a room of sickness or the Lord has revealed to you is the Lord has revealed that these certain things is going to take place just speak on and go on now say this because I I feel this is important the the we we God works on the basis of faith and to this faith is a living faith is an alive faith is not some dormant thing that we let sit somewhere and then and then we come every once in a while and try to pick it up no it's a living faith that we walk by we live by we breathe by every day it's this connection that you have with God and this attentiveness to the spirit and what's it what he wants you to do and I want to say this and I want to be careful in heinous often time we try to work from an angle of frustration things are not going within the way we want and the other thing it's like oh come on in it but but the source of it is frustration we try to work from an angle of of Pride oh I can't believe I'm a Son of God and this and this it won't work that's why I titled it faith faith faith this is a faith I'm trying to speak about faith that is motivated by love so we come in and it's a pride oh it's a shame or anything we we try or or we feel hopeless and then we cry out we won't pay but there has to be a faith that operates by love there has to be a faith that operates by love Faith is the master of all circumstances so faith comes into the situation now remember faith is always looking for the will of God faith is always in tune with what God wants done with the situation faith is always in tune with I'm here Lord how would you use me what would you have me to do what would you do this and do that and then faith comes in and he operates from that angle faith is not based upon your own intellect where you can come and call it whenever you are is based upon forgiveness but Abraham says and it's based upon love and let me say this let me just jump ahead for the sake of time but what I'm going to say this and and many many says and many uh many of you friends they are praying and fasting and afraid to take hold of what you are praying for that's right well it won't do you any good to fast and pray unless you got some Works to go with it it says all Faith all the faith all your faith in the world won't do you a bit of good lest you step right out and talk to talk with it and take it that's all that's all it says you've got to go forward just go you it says you just gotta step it take a step right out and do it anyhow when you ask for anything to get it God it says God said it's yours so don't take anything less get what you asked for it says you do that and find out how it's going to work out it says yeah don't back up just say okay I'll I'll take second or say oh well I'll take some okay so he's saying you we take what God has said faith is based upon the word of God so when we come and praying and asking we come in and and we have something that we have need of when we have asked for we step right in when we go forward he says this you say well what good will Faith have this is in a message a way of Fellowship what good you say what good would it do to have faith it says faith signed your pardon faith can come in this morning and can sign your pardon frustration will not get you anywhere we we are not called to be beggars we are the children of God we have to approach him on the basis of what he has allowed us to come in with we have to come in this morning and say what is the basis of me coming today before God and what am I asking and you have to come in and stand upon the promise that he has given you for you to claim what you have need of he says faith can sign your pardon sure it says it says that's the value of Faith don't be worried don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first amen you have to have love first for love produces faith now that's what I've been trying to say love produces faith for perfect love and I thought brother Mike just hit it on the nail when he read that switch I said that's it perfect love cast out fears and I'm gonna just jump so I could get to the end here it's important but what I'm going to say we have an understanding that everything God does it does by love now remember we read the statement that your that as much faith or as much power could be released is based upon the amount of faith that you have and and like I said it's important that we have we have the right basis of our faith and and I was thinking about the prophet and most times then you would hear those prayer lines and and think and he would come and it would the description that he gave he said you know this poor mother and had this little baby wrapped in clothes and he died the night before and he came in and so many big uh you know people trying to stop him and she was only this shorter but then she pushed forward this so she can come and everything he will give you the description and sometimes he will tell you while I walk in this Homeland it looked like it was not much of anything and but yet I saw the picture of my Lord Jesus Christ now he's talking to you about the basis of his faith I want you to pay close attention he'll come and say well you know I'll take my food and put next to him and look at him and said perhaps my shoe can feed him and anything I can do the basis of it it wasn't so people can know that it's a prophet it wasn't so he can do some great demonstration the way he always approached it is always by love I even remember when he's talking about the the killable and when he's talking about the Hornets he didn't come and say hey kill a bull I'm the prophet of God and I have some important mission he didn't come and say I'm a Son of God and I say go back to where you belong no there was always love that was projected there was always the love of God that went on first because he knew if it was by love nothing can conquer love but the thing is we go by it by frustration rather than by law we stand on trying to demonstrate to somebody that we have faith it's not now I could read the scripture and I'm running out of time the the scripture says love doesn't try to prove anything [Music] loved us and lift itself up and loved us in cast a shadow and do this and do love is humble love is me love is interested in one thing I need to present to you the love of God where did that love come from it's the same love that saved me that's why you can't you can't do anything for anybody unless you yourself have been touched you talk about a God that you don't know you don't know what it means to be safe how are you going to talk about saving but one of them says when love is projected when I love because now it's no longer just you it's you reflecting the very attribute of God through you going directly to the individual now it's God himself being reflected and now you're bringing him to the greatest power there is love Faith motivated by love says this it says he says and he says this I want I want you to get this now and this is in perfect Faith the church has got to be lifted up in the power of God he says it says how we are too close to the end now and I believe that the church is in condition where we can teach the little a little deeper thing to rub off some of the make-believe out and get into something real it's got to be something that you know now the scripture will say in Galatians chapter 5 and I'll read just verse 5 and 6 it says for it says for the for for through the spirit we wait for the hope of righteousness by faith it says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcise uh are valid anything no uncircumcised by faith which worketh by love but to Faith whose motivation is love and what Abraham says this and Faith this is in perfect Faith paragraph 126 and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in The God Who is the very essence of love Faith and love works together [Music] thank you Lord when you look at a situation what is your motive for that situation to be changed it's just because you're tired of seeing it you're tired of anything it's good to be tired but your motivation has to be Faith by love your motivation because Faith but when I will say as we read it here Faith or love is what created what creates faith the more love we have the more faith we're going to have but it has to start by love you know it's not okay to talk about how bad someone is if there's no love to go help it's not okay to talk about how sinful someone lives if you don't have love in your heart to go help them that that's the difference between criticism and faith amen it's not okay to to just come and and see this wrong and see that wrong and see this wrong because the reason you do that is because your basis is not Faith it's criticism but if your faith your base is love that I want to see God move in this place I want to see God heal people I want to see God move people from here to there I want to see God save and and I want to see the manifestation of God you have to start by love love is the very source of faith we want to operate the power by frustration so people can think we are the biggest church we are the best church we have the church on fire start by love love will give you what you're looking for and yet it will keep you humble [Music] the more love we can have the more faith we're going to have but but when I'm I was thinking is talking and and I know I'm running out of time if you excuse me yeah he is he's about the the boy in in the story about the boy in Finland I'll skip some so I can try to get somewhere and I'll read it from what Christ speak and I want you to see now this is something that was revealed to him or given to him in a vision two years ago and now he finds himself in a situation and paragraph it at 88 and he says and I looked around and it was exactly and it was exactly the way the Holy Spirit told me two years before it says when all that it says when all of you wrote in your Bible Across the Nation that it would happen and out there and then the situation is in hand it says no matter how dead it says no matter how dead he is no matter what anybody else said it's all over he says he's got to come back and he's talking about the boy and he says I said if this child that's going to raise up from the dead it says then I'm a false prophet now I want you to what is the basis on the which is saying we'll find it at the very end so he's not here now boasting about himself and say well then I'm a false prophet no he is now so confident about what God told him that there's nothing that can stop him he wants you to know that if God doesn't come then you don't now I'll tell you we wouldn't have to believe what he's saying here if it didn't happen now because he doesn't want you to be built upon him he wants you to be built upon God now it says you you call me a false prophet I'm a misinterpretation of God for in the Homeland two years ago he says he told me this would happen and there it says that these ministers and all it's wrote on the uh a flight lift of of our Bible and here it is exactly read off of the the fly live and how it would be in this in a country it says um uh lapping rocks and so forth and be killed and it says be on the right hand uh side of the road and I said there it is nothing can stop it the situation is already under control that's what faith will do for you working not scoring crazy over there and everything and you go on your knees and when you stand up you know the situation is under control listen to what he says he says the faith that was within me my heart was anointed the faith that was in my heart was anointed my brother my sister what we need is God not to give us some new Faith somewhere but to anoint what that which is within us by the preaching of the word by prayer Lord I just want what's within me to be anointed and then it says if he could only if I could only explain that faith that God it says ahead in God it says that told me he never failed he told me the situation is under control now he says here is exactly what I showed you two years ago and yes laying exactly in other the only thing you have to do is speak the word and the little boy Rise Up from the dead and it happened you know why I say that to say the same Prophet comes it says now we have a more sure word of Prophecy he says this Bible this word is more sure than a prophecy yes yes it's more sure than a vision this is more sure than what he just told you what he just did there he says that every time you read this this will never change this Ephesian can fail but the word cannot fail but yet our faith will let the anointing to coming but when I'm says faith will put you in action when you hear the word of God it says listen to this perfect Faith they said here paragraph 127 he's talking about the relationship of love here just like a young couple you take a man and a young woman and they love and they fall in love one with another and they go along being it says being begin to know one another more and their hearts just being Beat Just it began to beat as one and they're not husband and wife but they love binds them together they have confidence with one another and if they really love one another really love one it says really love and you know that the girl love and and and you know that the girl loves you and that she knows that you love her You've Got Confidence it says faith in one another if you got faith in one another if you didn't you would do better not marry her notice you got you have you got you got to have faith and you separate them and put them one extreme self in one extreme North SM is still that love bits in the heart of one another no matter what it says no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one for another listen now and if you love the Lord not just trying to dodge hell but you love the Lord then you have faith in God see if you love him I I thought is our motivation it's just we don't want to go to hell you know that's why we come to church you know I've heard hell is a bad place I don't want to go to it and therefore I will believe so I don't go there and I say this that's not bad but that's not enough that's not enough and he says yeah they are they were together and they were separate apart but the heart still beats one for another you were separated from God but yet your heart somewhere we're still beating for God no wonder when you heard the word you recognize the heartbeat no matter no wonder when you heard the message something when Nino Han said I don't know how to explain it they something strange about this why it's the heartbeat that you had in the beginning it's not just talking about some random examples if you're talking about somebody whose heartbeat does not change and the faith that is based upon this love will always overcome he says if the musician could come Paul speaks in First Corinthians 13 and 1 and says though I speak with tongue of tongues of men and Angel and have no charity I have come a sounding rise and tinkling symbol and and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries and knowledge and though I have all faith and so and so that I can move mountains and have no charity of nothing it says and though I bestow all my goods and to feed the poor and though I give my heart and my body to be burned and have no at no charity a perfect me nothing charity suffer long and it's kind charity and vinod charity wanted not itself and the prophet not do not behave itself unseemingly seek it not her own glory and is not provoked easily provoked or think of No Evil he says Rejoice is not in iniquity or rejoice it not in in in the rejected not iniquity but rejoices in the truth not beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things and do with all things charity never fails I I want to ask this morning is your heartbeat really A Love Affair or is it moved away from the love of hair is it become something that we've taken out of love and it's become some principle or some doctrines that we walk by and and we stand firm and every time somebody strive to move away from the ranks we remind him that we have a principle to keep or is it something a love that motivates a love that's there to correct a love that's there to pick us up when we are down a love that's there to direct when someone is misguided a love that's there to always make a way a love that's there with one goal that he wants all of us to make it but when I was speaking he talks about a story of a young couple he says he talks about this he says this girl was a she was a Christian she would mean she had been a Christian for years but the young man was just converted and he's been a Christian for about two years I believe he said and then the the Mary together and and and and and this is the basis that the the young girl is realizing that this man and uh this young boy and has just became a Christian for about two years and and now he's talking to him and and look at the basis that is placing the love so that the man would have a proper understanding of what the what she feels for him it says she had been a Christian for many years with this young girl for a couple of years and and they fell in love and he says they got married and they loved one another and had confidence with one another they got married and and and and and and so that same woman and he says it says it must be hard on you you are just a young Christian I've had so many much to go uh with through with it says I said and you've had so much to go down with it says drinking is what it is it says you've got so much to go through with and and and said I know you are bound to be tempted hopefully uh awfully hard and said I want you to know one thing now it says if you happen to fall if you happen to fall into temptation it's over and is overcome don't stay away come home back come on back home now I say this this is the same Foundation that God is blessing upon you this morning if you happen to make a mistake if you happen to have gone astray if you happen to have done something you were not supposed to do if you happen to to have uh I thought you've gone astray I've messed it all up I've done wrong he's saying that don't stay away come back home come on come on back home don't stay away from home come on Becca he says you come right back cause I'm going to be right here waiting for you he says I'm going to help you pray through and again until you get Victory I'm going to stay here with you because then I because because when I married you I married you because I loved you now I I I this is not just a story I I think we forget to very understand the very love of God for us this is the love that fought for you this is the love that went to hell for you this is the love that gave Christ on the calvary for you this is the love that can never be defeated if faith cannot be defeated love cannot be defeated but Madam says the love is the greatest force on Earth there is nothing that love cannot overcome so he's telling you this morning you are placed on the base that no matter what you come on home and then he asked a question at the end they said how can a man do wrong being placed on the love like this how can you even think about going astray at the reason for that is when because remember when he prays Abraham he prays Abraham on the Covenant that it's not what you have done it's what I have done for you the reason for that is because you need to understand that there's not a thing that you can do to add to God's love or one thing that you can do to take away from his love his love is the perfect love his love is what bought you his love is what sought you his love is what redeemed you this love is what will take you to the end we're ready says so that in the ages to come in the ages to come when we are sitting around eternity and we are talking about our journey on Earth we will remember the love that carried us through my brother my sister if your faith is based on that love your lovely will be made perfect your faith will be made perfect that's the faith that we have to operate under not to love that not the faith that accuses one and call one's this name and call that one non-statement and talk about this and talk about no but the love that's based upon the foundation that I was wretched I was miserable I was in sin I was lost I am what I am by the grace of God and the same Grace that extended to me can extend to anybody it's not your job to look out there and pick and choose who God can save you just extend the love God knows who to catch faith that is motivated by love let your face be for your faith be by frustration don't beat your head against the stone come back to the word of God to the right foundation he taught spirit said who do men say that I am we said well some says this you are this and sometimes say you are Dad that says good but where do you say that I am because it's upon your Revelation not somebody else's it's upon your Revelation that will build my church it says Thou Are the Son of God thou are the son of the Living God the Christ the son of the Living God it says flesh and blood is not giving it to you flesh and blood is not import that to you it's what God has imported to you that's what God will build upon build upon your flesh or your character or your good nature or your bad nature no build upon what God is given to you let's all stand this morning foreign [Applause] [Music] that is filled upon the love of God [Music] am talks about [Music] it says in perfect Faith paragraph 132. if you could put it up there it says when we were in sin alienated from God without God in the world and in that mocking mud it says as I talked about this morning God came to us God taught us you never sought God no man can come to me except my father draws him first God came down in the mark it says what you were and sought you out and brought you out it says Thou Art to create perfect love that basis has to create perfect love look at what you was look at what you are what did that somebody that loved you it says can't you have faith in what is promised to you then the real genuine love will create confidence in his word look at what you was and what you are what what made the change it's love by his love to bring you here so we need to have confidence that that same love will come and it will take us to where we need to be it's always by love let's just buy our heads our gracious father we're so thankful Lord this morning [Music] thank you Lord it seems like even when we think we've amounted to something and we are reminded Lord that It's Always by your grace and your mercy Lord and your word is so good at humbling us and just bringing us right back lord so we could be grounded in the fact that it's always about you not about us [Music] it's always about your goodness and and what you have done for us we pray oh God that you forgive our shortcomings oh God and if there is anyone in our midst that's not saved Lord father can you just come by our way that they they can feel your love this morning and father if they have any questions that you come and you answer those questions Lord but father asked that have started Lord and as Paul will say that we begin in love and then we'll change out to something else and father that we begin in faith that the whole part of the way we have to continue in faith and love and knowing that he who started the work will finish it forgive us our shortcomings if we somehow behave puffed up and father said things that's not pleasing to you we ask that you forgive us Lord and bring us to that place where father where we'll always operate by the love that you place within our hearts lead us on the way of everlasting Lord and we love you and we commit everything in acid in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's just sing now oh faithful one you won't change [Music]
