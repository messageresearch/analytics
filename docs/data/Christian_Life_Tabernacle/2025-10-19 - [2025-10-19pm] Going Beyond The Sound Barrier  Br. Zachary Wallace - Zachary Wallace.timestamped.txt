[6:21] each other, Lord. Maybe,

[23:17] Matthew who's out and brother Billy
[23:19] who's in London and
[23:22] brother Daniel as we mentioned this
[23:24] morning
[23:26] and we've got a lot of needs. We're a
[23:28] needy people.
[23:30] We're so thankful that regardless of how
[23:32] many needs we have, God never gets tired
[23:34] of our requests.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; In fact, he invites us to ask of him
[23:39] anything.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; There's nothing too great for him. He's
[23:43] always got an answer. May the brothers
[23:45] are taking the tithes and offerings.

[24:08] thank God that God has different gifts
[24:11] and they come to nourish us and
[24:13] strengthen us by the word of promise.
[24:15] And you know, I I thank God even hearing
[24:18] remembering that there was a worthy one.
[24:20] And that's who we're going to look to
[24:22] right now in prayer for these needs and
[24:24] for your need. You know, it's because of
[24:26] Calvary that opened the door for the
[24:28] benefits. And so, let's let's think
[24:30] about what price was paid that we can
[24:33] receive what we have need of in this
[24:35] moment. Let's join our faith together,
[24:37] our voices together, our hearts
[24:39] together. Let's believe. Heavenly

[24:52] with us. And Lord, to make known your
[24:55] promises, Lord, and Father, we're such a
[24:58] needy people, Lord. We heard these
[25:00] requests, Lord. Our hearts are desirous
[25:02] to see you move on this scene, Lord, to
[25:04] bring about, oh God, the power that was
[25:07] spoken of this morning, Lord, to see the
[25:09] light of the gospel alive and well.
[25:12] Father, we commit the needs, Lord, the
[25:14] traveling ones of Brother Paul and
[25:16] brother Sergio. We pray you bless them
[25:18] as well. And Lord, as we oh God, prepare
[25:21] our hearts, Lord. And just unear an
[25:24] expectation to hear from you again
[25:26] today, Lord. May, oh God, meet the needs
[25:29] of every heart, Lord. And Lord, we just
[25:32] desire to draw even closer even as the
[25:35] songs were sung, Lord. We just want to
[25:37] have an atmosphere that you could come
[25:39] and deal with the our hearts personally.
[25:42] Lord, help us together, Lord, as we
[25:44] commit the service, the man of God, the
[25:46] offerings, and the tithes. Lord, may oh
[25:49] God go further further of your kingdom.
[25:52] As we commit ourselves, Lord, hear our
[25:54] hearts cry, Lord, and come and dine with
[25:57] us. Father, meet every need. We pray in
[25:59] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[36:10] in Christ alone
[36:13] who took our flesh.
[36:17] Fullness of God in helpless
[36:21] faith.
[36:22] This gift of love
[36:25] and righteousness
[36:28] and scored by the one he came to save.
[36:34] who on that cross
[36:37] as Jesus died.
[36:40] The wrath of God
[36:42] was sisfied
[36:46] for every sing
[36:53] of Christ.
[36:55] By the merry ground in the ground
[37:00] his body laid
[37:03] by the world my heart is slain
[37:09] in mercy
[37:12] glorious name
[37:15] from the grave he rose
[37:18] again
[37:20] and as he stands
[37:23] in victory Glory
[37:26] stress has lost his me.
[37:32] For I am his
[37:35] and he is mine
[37:38] in the precious blood
[37:41] of Christ.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our gracious father, truly we are
[37:47] the purchased of the blood of the lamb.
[37:51] Lord, our hearts just are lifted with
[37:53] joy knowing those things. We ask you to
[37:57] bless us this evening, Father, as we
[38:01] receive more of your word, Father,
[38:05] directing our path, Father, encouraging
[38:08] us along the way, Father, making known
[38:12] to us your power and your benefits. We
[38:16] certainly long to have more of you,
[38:20] Father. to overcome that we might
[38:23] reflect more of you. We ask for your
[38:26] mercy and grace in this. In Jesus' name
[38:29] we pray. Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoyed the service this morning.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. A God that's alive.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen
[38:38] &gt;&gt; and real. And you know, just think the a
[38:42] word is a thought expressed.
[38:45] And so when God had his thoughts,
[38:50] he expressed them to us and then he
[38:52] backed it up with a promise.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; And you know, and that's what that's
[38:56] what it is is believing every promise of
[39:00] God's word. And he's not only he just
[39:03] didn't make the promise and go away. You
[39:06] know, that sounds like me. you know, I I
[39:10] promise you something and then I'll take
[39:11] off and I won't be found anywhere to
[39:14] carry out the promise. But he made the
[39:17] promise, paid the price for everything
[39:20] that would keep you from that promise,
[39:22] then rose from the dead to be here
[39:25] &gt;&gt; to bring that promise to pass. My,
[39:28] that's just like a that's a good program
[39:31] right there. That's something I can
[39:32] believe in. Amen. Not a God that's
[39:35] forsake us, but a God that's with us.
[39:38] because he said, "I'll be with you even
[39:40] in you till the end." He I will not
[39:43] leave you nor forsake you. And so we can
[39:46] certainly are are grateful for that. And
[39:50] so it's graceful to have our brother
[39:51] with us again this evening and to bring
[39:54] the word of the Lord. So we'll just turn
[39:56] it over to him and if he has a song he'd
[39:59] like to sing, we'll let him sing. He
[40:01] sounded like he had a pretty good voice
[40:02] to me. So, but Zachary, it's been a a
[40:06] pleasure, my brother, and hope to see
[40:08] more of you through God's time. Lord
[40:10] bless you this evening. Thank you for
[40:12] being here.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I look forward to spending a
[40:15] lot of time together, Brother David.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; When uh when you won't be you won't be
[40:20] old and I won't be young. We'll just all
[40:23] be the same. Time won't mean anything.
[40:26] Age won't mean anything. Be in the
[40:28] glories of God.
[40:30] So, I I I don't have a song right now.
[40:34] Um I I wasn't thinking that direction.
[40:37] It took me by surprise, but uh uh I I'll
[40:42] just go ahead and go into the word and
[40:44] uh I'll I'll uh I'll ask our brother Ben
[40:48] to have a song ready when we're
[40:50] finished.
[40:52] So, uh, if we could just turn in the
[40:56] Bible to, uh, the book of Romans,
[41:00] we'll read a portion of scripture there.
[41:03] And,
[41:05] you know what? Let's, let's go to
[41:07] Hebrews uh, 13. That that scripture in
[41:09] Romans is is later in my I'll get to it
[41:12] a little bit later. Hebrews 13 and verse
[41:15] 11.
[41:17] a little bit after that very familiar
[41:19] scripture that Jesus Christ is the same
[41:21] yesterday, today, and forever.
[41:24] And so, but just after that, he says
[41:27] here, Hebrews 13:11. We'll read a
[41:29] portion there, but bring you greetings
[41:31] from my family. I did fail to mention
[41:33] that I I do have a wife back home and
[41:35] five children. So, the Lord's been good
[41:38] to me and uh enjoying many blessings.
[41:43] Hebrews 13:11
[41:46] says, "For the bodies of those beasts
[41:49] whose blood is brought into the
[41:51] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[41:54] burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus
[41:58] also that he might sanctify the people
[42:01] with his own blood suffered without the
[42:04] gate. Let us go therefore go forth
[42:09] therefore unto him without the camp
[42:13] bearing his reproach.
[42:15] If we could just pray.
[42:18] Lord Jesus, we just ask that you would
[42:20] anoint your word to our hearts this
[42:22] evening. Lord, there's there's nothing I
[42:24] could say that would be a help to your
[42:26] people. There's nothing I could do. But
[42:28] Father, if you'll come down and you'll
[42:29] just speak your words, Lord, that's what
[42:31] we're looking for and that's what we
[42:33] have need of, Father. for you are not
[42:35] only aware of the needs that are in this
[42:37] building but you have the supply for
[42:39] every one of them. So we just want to
[42:41] welcome you and we want you to be
[42:43] glorified and to have your way among us
[42:45] this evening in Jesus Christ's name.
[42:47] Amen. Can be seated this evening. Glad
[42:51] to see some of you are taking them
[42:53] gospels and make it back to church.
[42:54] That's good. And uh I I want to take a
[42:58] little thought on uh going beyond the
[43:00] sound barrier. But uh before we get to
[43:04] going beyond the sound barrier, I I
[43:06] almost want to just stop and say going
[43:07] beyond the sound because there's a lot
[43:10] of noises. There's a lot of there's a
[43:12] lot of sound. There's a lot of voices
[43:13] out there that would try to hold you
[43:15] back and that would try to limit you
[43:18] from going beyond.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, he preached a
[43:22] whole sermon on going beyond the camp.
[43:25] And tremendous sermon. I I've been
[43:27] enjoying it lately, going beyond the
[43:29] camp. But I I just want to look at at
[43:31] this thought of you really like going
[43:34] beyond the sound of of what other people
[43:36] would say. Going beyond the sound of
[43:38] what other people would think. And
[43:40] because we're not really worried what
[43:41] other people were thinking or what other
[43:43] people are going to say. What I'm
[43:44] concerned about is what does my Lord
[43:47] think? What does my Lord say? That's
[43:49] that's who I'm here to please and that's
[43:51] who I'm here to glorify. And so let
[43:53] everything else just be secondary but
[43:56] that. And so, you know, in the Old
[43:59] Testament, they had the the the
[44:01] tabernacle and they had the three courts
[44:03] and and if you were in the outer court,
[44:06] you know, it was a blessing to be there.
[44:07] The mana was falling. It was a good
[44:09] place. They had a a brazen altar and
[44:11] they had a a lather where they washed
[44:14] the sacrifice and it was good. But there
[44:16] was an even greater place where you
[44:17] could step into the holy place and
[44:20] you're there with the the showbread and
[44:22] you had the light from the manora
[44:24] candlestick. wasn't just dependent on on
[44:26] the sun shining or the clouds not being
[44:28] there. There was a there was a greater
[44:30] walk that could be had and it was a
[44:31] little bit better. It was a little
[44:32] farther and that's good. But then there
[44:34] was a place where that that high priest
[44:36] could go and he could step beyond the
[44:39] veil. He could step through the barrier.
[44:41] He could have a breakthrough personally
[44:43] and he'd step into a place where he was
[44:46] in the presence of the shakina glory.
[44:49] He'd go beyond every man-made tradition,
[44:51] every man-made thing until he was just
[44:53] him in the presence of the shikina glory
[44:56] and the word. Oh, that's where I want to
[44:59] be. That's where I want to live. And the
[45:01] prophet of God tells us something
[45:02] special about that place. He says in
[45:05] that dimension, in that place, in that
[45:07] holiest of holies, they could hear the
[45:10] bell ringing from inside of there
[45:11] saying, "Holy, holy, holy." He says,
[45:13] "But it was built in such a way, it was
[45:15] a supernatural way that you could not
[45:18] hear anything from outside. It was
[45:20] soundproof to the things outside. And if
[45:22] you can ever get yourself locked away in
[45:25] the holiest of holies where it's just
[45:27] you in the shakina glory, it doesn't
[45:29] matter what grandpa said anymore. It
[45:31] doesn't matter what some denominational
[45:33] person said somewhere. What matters is
[45:35] you're in the presence of your Lord
[45:37] Jesus Christ."
[45:39] If you can get into that place where the
[45:42] sound of this world doesn't affect you
[45:45] anymore, you're getting somewhere.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; And now I I want to take us back to that
[45:51] to you because that that Old Testament,
[45:53] we seen that it was a type. It was a
[45:55] representation. But it was once a year
[45:59] that he would go in there because the
[46:02] way hadn't been made yet.
[46:05] But my Lord Jesus Christ came a way
[46:08] maker and he made a way. And it was
[46:10] through his own body. His own body was
[46:12] tore apart that he might make a way for
[46:15] us to enter into that holiest of holies
[46:17] so that we could enter in there. And it
[46:20] wasn't just something that could be done
[46:21] once a year, but a person could live and
[46:24] dwell in the presence of almighty God.
[46:26] And so because there is a way made in
[46:29] this hour that that we could enter into
[46:32] that. I want to look at the the start of
[46:34] that which was the day of Pentecost
[46:37] because that's where the the church got
[46:39] started got inaugurated on and and in
[46:42] Acts chapter 2 I I know you're familiar
[46:44] with it but I'm not here to tell you
[46:46] anything new. So, we're just going to
[46:48] continue on in Acts chapter 2 here. It
[46:50] says, "When the day of Pentecost was
[46:52] fully come, they were all with one
[46:53] accord in one place. And suddenly there
[46:56] came from heaven as of a a rushing
[46:59] mighty wind, a sound, and it filled all
[47:01] the house where they were sitting. And
[47:03] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[47:05] like as a fire, and it sat upon each of
[47:07] them." A and I just want you to notice
[47:09] here where many times the the
[47:11] Pentecostal denomination, I mean, let's
[47:13] just establish this real quick. There's
[47:14] a great difference between Pentecost and
[47:16] a Pentecostal religion. There's a whole
[47:19] great big difference. Now, I am
[47:21] Pentecostal, but I'm not Pentecostal by
[47:23] organization. I'm not Pentecostal by
[47:25] joining a church. I am Pentecostal by
[47:28] experience because I'm a part of what
[47:30] these apostles had here back in that
[47:32] day. And and and if you notice though,
[47:33] there first there comes a sound of a
[47:35] rushing mighty wind. That's good. That's
[47:38] fine.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I I've heard it. I enjoy it.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. But there's more.
[47:44] and and there was a mighty wind came
[47:46] through and it filled all the house
[47:47] where they are sitting. And there
[47:48] appeared under them cloven tongues like
[47:50] as a fire. That's wonderful. I I haven't
[47:52] had the privilege of of seeing the
[47:53] pillar of fire with my personal eyes. Uh
[47:56] not not in a natural sense, but I have
[47:58] seen it in a recorded sense that was
[48:00] recorded by God for my benefit and I'm
[48:02] appreciative of that, you know, and I'm
[48:04] thankful that, you know, I recognize
[48:06] when the pillar of fire is is coming
[48:07] through a building. That's wonderful.
[48:09] And if I could see it, I'd be thankful
[48:10] and that's good. But there's more.
[48:13] There's more than just having the Holy
[48:15] Ghost come and and that pillar of fire
[48:17] and it and it sat upon each of them. And
[48:19] that's wonderful. I love feeling the
[48:21] Holy Ghost come on my body. There is
[48:23] nothing this flesh enjoys more than
[48:25] getting into the presence of God because
[48:27] that's what I was created for. Angels
[48:30] were created in heaven to worship God.
[48:32] And that's what their purpose was. God
[48:34] created man and he placed something
[48:35] inside of him. I don't care if he's a
[48:37] pygmy over in Africa somewhere or if
[48:39] he's over in India. He is going to
[48:41] worship because it's something God
[48:42] placed within him. And you were created
[48:45] to worship God. There's something inside
[48:47] of you. I don't care if you if you don't
[48:49] realize it, you don't accept it. There's
[48:51] something in you that's calling out for
[48:53] worship to the one who created you. And
[48:55] when I get to do what he created me for,
[48:58] when I get to get in his presence and
[49:00] say, "God, you're worthy. I love you,
[49:02] Lord. I want to praise you." It just is
[49:04] so wonderful because I'm fulfilling part
[49:07] of my purpose.
[49:09] Oh, Adam in the Garden of Eden, he'd get
[49:11] with the he'd get there and they'd come
[49:13] down and he would just enjoy that
[49:15] fellowship in the cool of the evening,
[49:17] walking with the with the Lord Jesus in
[49:19] the pill cool of the evening. That was
[49:21] the privilege Adam had. And in this day,
[49:24] we have the restoration of all things so
[49:26] that man once again can have fellowship
[49:28] with their creator.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I enjoy it.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I enjoy feeling his presence. It's
[49:36] wonderful. But there's more.
[49:39] And it says that that sat on each one of
[49:41] them and they were filled with the Holy
[49:44] Ghost. Now, don't stop short of that.
[49:47] You know, if the rushing mighty wind
[49:48] comes through here, praise God. But
[49:50] there's more. If you see the pillar of
[49:52] fire, praise God. I'm glad for any
[49:54] experience you had. Wonderful. If you
[49:56] feel the presence of God anointing your
[49:58] body till you stagger around like a
[49:59] drunk person, praise God. But whatever
[50:01] you do, make sure you go all the way and
[50:04] get filled with the Holy Ghost because
[50:06] that's what will take you into rapture.
[50:08] That's what's going to get you out of
[50:09] here is when you've been magnetized to
[50:11] that great magnet of the Holy Ghost. And
[50:13] and he says they were each one filled
[50:15] with the Holy Ghost. And and they began
[50:17] to speak with other tongues as the
[50:19] spirit gave them utterance. And and and
[50:21] all the Jews round about began to hear
[50:23] what's going on. What what's going on
[50:26] with this this bunch of people? And and
[50:28] they were amazed. And they began to hear
[50:30] every man speaking in their own tongue.
[50:31] And and there was this great stir
[50:34] throughout the city. And I pray God that
[50:36] this city of Dallas gets a stirring
[50:37] where they began to ask a question.
[50:39] What's going on in that little church
[50:41] over there? Do they have they all lost
[50:42] their mind? They all gone crazy. What's
[50:44] happened to them people? What what's
[50:46] going on? And they begin to say, "No,
[50:48] they're just a bunch of holy rollers.
[50:49] They're just a bunch of fanatics. You
[50:51] know, they're just been they got on some
[50:52] kind of a new substance. I don't know
[50:54] what it is, but it makes them act crazy.
[50:56] It's called the Holy Ghost.
[50:58] It'll do something to you that this
[51:00] world could never touch. There isn't a
[51:02] drug out there. There isn't an addictive
[51:04] substance. There isn't an alcohol or a
[51:06] wine that can do for you what the Lord
[51:08] Jesus Christ will do for you. He is the
[51:11] satisfying portion.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And you know, I've never tried any of
[51:16] that stuff.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't have to.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; When you got the genuine, why would you
[51:22] take a substitute? When you got a
[51:24] satisfying portion, you're not looking
[51:26] for something else.
[51:29] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, and they began to go
[51:31] staggering around and and they said,
[51:33] "These men are drunk on and they began
[51:35] to criticize him. They began to mock
[51:37] them." And they said, uh, and and and uh
[51:40] verse 12, he said, "And they were all
[51:42] amazed and were in doubt and saying one
[51:44] another, what meanth this?
[51:48] What's going on with these people?" And
[51:50] they were all amazed and were in doubt,
[51:52] saying to another, "What meanth this?"
[51:54] And others started saying, "I want this,
[51:57] too." Is that what it says? Others
[51:59] saying, "Oh, I wish I could be." No,
[52:01] they just started making fun of him.
[52:03] They said, "Oh, these these people are
[52:05] just drunk. They're all drunk on some
[52:06] kind of a new wine." And they were. And
[52:10] Peter stood up with the 11 and he said,
[52:12] "Listen, they're not drunk the way
[52:14] you're thinking." He says, "They're not
[52:16] drunk. They're drunk on a revelation of
[52:18] the personal a personal revelation of
[52:21] Jesus Christ. They're drunk on something
[52:23] that every one of you needs to get
[52:25] intoxicated with. And and he says,
[52:27] "They're not drunk as you suppose, but
[52:29] this is the fulfillment of prophecy.
[52:32] This is what God said he would do, and
[52:35] he's doing it."
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, God sent the
[52:39] Holy Ghost because he promised to.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; He promised to send it, and he's a God
[52:44] who is faithful to his word. And so, I
[52:47] speak to you. You say, "You desire to
[52:48] receive the Holy Ghost. God promised it.
[52:51] You want a refilling of it. The dynamics
[52:53] of this church will be a refilling of
[52:56] the Holy Ghost.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Brother says in message ashamed. He says
[53:03] because you know there was a lot of
[53:04] people who were ashamed of of that
[53:06] Pentecostal outpouring of and there's
[53:08] people to this day that are still
[53:09] ashamed to be identified as Pentecostal.
[53:12] I'm not a Pentecost is not a dirty word.
[53:15] That's my heritage. That's my that's my
[53:18] fathers of the faith. And I I believe
[53:20] for everything that they stood for and
[53:21] I'm not ashamed of it one little bit.
[53:23] And he says here in 1965, ashamed he
[53:27] said, "Whosoever is ashamed of me and my
[53:29] word and he and his word are one." So
[53:33] being ashamed of his word in this sinful
[53:36] present generation, I'll be ashamed of
[53:39] him. Now notice today if somebody says,
[53:41] "Are you a Christian?" It's it's very
[53:43] popular thing to say, "Oh, I'm a
[53:45] Christian." See, but do you believe the
[53:47] word of God where it said these signs
[53:48] shall follow them that believe? Oh, even
[53:51] ministers will blush. Are you ashamed of
[53:54] say divine healing? Are you ashamed of
[53:56] the full gospel? Are you ashamed of your
[53:59] Pentecostal experience? That's being
[54:02] ashamed of his word. That's his word
[54:05] made flesh in you.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, I'm not
[54:09] ashamed of my Pentecostal experience. I
[54:12] am enjoying the benefits of Jesus
[54:14] Christ's resurrection because he lives.
[54:17] I can live also because he lives. He's
[54:20] living inside of me. And I have
[54:22] experienced what they experienced there
[54:25] in the book of Acts. I'm blessed and
[54:27] enjoying my Pentecostal experience
[54:30] because it's the word being made flesh
[54:33] in me.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil the devil will try to make
[54:36] you ashamed of that. The devil will try
[54:39] to shut that down. He'll try to put it
[54:41] behind some kind of tradition of of
[54:43] barriers of creeds and dogmas and say
[54:45] that's not for you. That was for another
[54:46] day. That was for the apostles. That was
[54:48] for I don't care what it is he's trying
[54:50] to say. Don't you listen to one word of
[54:52] it. That's your inheritance as a member
[54:54] of the body of Jesus Christ.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Jude, he said, "Brethren, I'm giving
[54:59] diligence to write to you that you
[55:01] should contend. You've got to fight for
[55:04] this. You've got to contend and fight
[55:06] for the faith that was once delivered to
[55:08] the saints because the enemy is coming
[55:10] in and he's trying to take away from you
[55:12] what the original church actually had.
[55:16] Now I I'm getting a lot of this
[55:18] inspiration from a sermon that I really
[55:20] enjoy. It's called Why I am a holy
[55:23] roller. Anybody all heard that sermon?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Who else heard that sermon? Why I am a
[55:28] holy roller? All right. Hey, it's a good
[55:31] one. And uh I was down in uh down in the
[55:35] uh in Nicaragua one time and I was we
[55:37] were driving up uh well we were actually
[55:39] up on a river and I was just sitting
[55:41] there and and it's it gets a little bit
[55:43] lengthy sometimes riding and is that
[55:46] Shiloh?
[55:49] God bless you. Sorry that took me back
[55:53] uh a long ways back to when we were
[55:54] younger. Anyway, uh I was riding in this
[55:58] uh this river boat and you're in that
[55:59] river boat for seven, eight hours and
[56:02] you're riding on a 2x4.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; It just is not very comfortable, you
[56:06] know. And so I was like, I got to do
[56:09] something to endure this this suffering.
[56:11] And so I found a I got my earbuds out
[56:13] and I put it in and I began to listen to
[56:15] this this message of why I am a holy
[56:17] roller. And you know, I got to feeling
[56:19] pretty good. And that 2x4 got to just
[56:21] kind of going off into the background. I
[56:23] wasn't paying attention to it anymore.
[56:25] But I I was listening to that and when
[56:27] we came out of there, we we went to a a
[56:29] youth camp out there in the city. And
[56:31] and when we got there, I I began to
[56:34] realize because I I started preaching on
[56:35] this this thought of why I'm a holy
[56:37] roller. And and I realized I'd been at
[56:39] that youth camp. It'd be about 10 years
[56:41] back now when I'd met my first holy
[56:43] roller.
[56:45] And I I I actually I wasn't sure what
[56:47] was going on because there was there was
[56:49] a the group of young people up at the
[56:51] altar and they were just really calling
[56:52] out to God for for a a baptism of the
[56:55] Holy Ghost. And they they them young
[56:56] people got down on their knees and they
[56:58] began to pray and they prayed for one
[57:00] hour and then they prayed for two hours
[57:01] and they just kept on going. I remember
[57:03] one sister, she'd come up, she knelt
[57:05] down right there at the front and she
[57:06] grabbed a hold of the corner of the
[57:08] pulpit like she was holding on to the
[57:10] horns of the altar and she wouldn't let
[57:12] go until she got what she desired. You
[57:14] know, when the church gets to hungering,
[57:17] when a church gets to hungering for the
[57:18] outpouring of the spirit of God, God's
[57:20] going to be there to meet that hunger
[57:22] and that desire. And them young people,
[57:24] I seen them get changed and filled with
[57:26] the Holy Ghost. And and just a couple
[57:28] months ago, I was down there and I met a
[57:29] sister. She says, "10 years ago, I was
[57:31] in that meeting and God filled me with
[57:32] the Holy Ghost." And my life's always
[57:34] been changed from that moment on. And
[57:36] that's why we're preaching, friends.
[57:38] We're preaching to see lives that are
[57:40] changed, that can be touched by the
[57:41] power of Almighty God. And I I was in
[57:44] that service and and we were I was
[57:45] looking I was watching over things and
[57:47] kind of praying with different ones and
[57:49] and they were all just kneelled down
[57:50] just crying out to God and and the piano
[57:53] player was playing until the power of
[57:54] God struck her and she just jumped up
[57:56] and started dancing off across the
[57:57] building. We didn't have any piano
[57:58] player and and you know but it was all
[58:01] right. The presence of God was there and
[58:02] and when the spirit of God's moving,
[58:04] it's all right. Don't get worried. Don't
[58:06] get worked up. The spirit of God's in
[58:08] control. He's still on the throne and he
[58:10] knows what he's doing. and and I seen
[58:11] this young man just rolling all over the
[58:13] floor and I'm like, "Well, I don't know
[58:17] what this is, but we better go check on
[58:18] it, you know, and and so he was just
[58:20] rolling all over the place and and he
[58:23] was just screaming and I'm just like,
[58:25] my, you know, that's quite a quite a
[58:27] case." And and so I I don't speak
[58:29] Spanish very well. And so I'm trying to
[58:31] listen to what he's saying. And I asked
[58:32] the brother, I said, "What what's he
[58:34] saying?" Because he was just yelling it
[58:36] out again and again and again. And the
[58:38] brother listened. He's like, "Oh, he's
[58:40] saying, "I'm so happy. I'm so happy." I
[58:43] said, "Leave him alone.
[58:47] I I I I met my first holy roller there,
[58:50] and he he was having himself a time."
[58:52] And you know what? If some of you could
[58:54] have a time like that where you got
[58:56] under the power of the anointing of the
[58:57] Holy Ghost and got so happy you didn't
[58:59] know what to do with yourself, it
[59:01] wouldn't hurt you none. And so I I I was
[59:04] there and I I I remembered back when I
[59:06] was listening to the sermon, I was like,
[59:07] I actually met a holy roller one time.
[59:09] And he was over there laying on the
[59:11] floor just having himself a time. And
[59:13] and so I was listening to this sermon
[59:14] when I was when I was over there right
[59:16] where that church was. And so I I went
[59:18] ahead and preached on why I am a holy
[59:19] roller in the place where I met a holy
[59:21] roller. And and uh but I I listened to
[59:23] that sermon. I just want to share with
[59:25] you some of the the things I I I I
[59:27] snagged from that. I just wrote down
[59:28] some notes. I don't have time to really
[59:30] get into all of it tonight, but but
[59:32] there's just a lot of good things in
[59:33] that sermon. And and and that he says
[59:35] first out to start it out, he says,
[59:37] listen, he says, there's no church that
[59:39] has a church name called Holy Roller.
[59:40] There's no organization I found that has
[59:42] a church name called Holy Roller. He
[59:44] says, it's just a name to try and shame
[59:47] the people of God.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And uh he he was showing how it's just
[59:51] the enemy trying to put a reproach. You
[59:54] see, there's always been a reproach for
[59:56] the cause of the word. There's always
[59:58] been a reproach for those people who are
[1:00:00] the true, genuine, Holy Ghost fililled
[1:00:02] children of God. There's a reproach that
[1:00:04] goes with that.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And that's all right.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; They reproached him.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; There's a reproach for the cause of the
[1:00:12] word. You look at Jesus Christ sitting
[1:00:14] over there in the corner with dirty
[1:00:15] feet.
[1:00:17] Reproach.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't come the way their
[1:00:20] denomination thought he ought to come.
[1:00:22] But
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; you know that woman came over and she
[1:00:26] took the dust off of his feet and she
[1:00:29] put it in her hair and wiped it off and
[1:00:32] she used her glory to bear his reproach
[1:00:34] and he took her sin.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's worth it to bear the reproach
[1:00:39] for the cause of Christ. But but this
[1:00:42] this sermon, why I am a holy roller, I I
[1:00:44] just jotted down about nine different uh
[1:00:47] bullet points from it. And the things I
[1:00:49] I I walked away from there was one, the
[1:00:51] prophet of this age was a holy roller.
[1:00:54] He said, "I am a holy roller." And the
[1:00:57] faith once delivered to the saints was
[1:00:58] holy roller religion. The sons of God
[1:01:01] before the foundation of the world were
[1:01:03] holy rollers. The children of Israel
[1:01:05] following a vindicated prophet led by a
[1:01:07] pillar of fire seen their enemies
[1:01:09] defeated and they were holy rollers.
[1:01:12] David, a man after God's own heart,
[1:01:14] seeing the word being brought back to
[1:01:16] its position, became a holy roller. The
[1:01:18] apostles were holy rollers. You will
[1:01:21] either be a holy roller or you'll be an
[1:01:23] unholy roller. Take your pick. You'll
[1:01:27] either be a fool for Christ or you'll be
[1:01:29] a fool for a basketball team somewhere.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; You'll either be a fool for for sports
[1:01:34] or for politics or or something like
[1:01:36] that and and do some crazy thing. And
[1:01:38] here's the thing. You go to a basketball
[1:01:40] game and you shout and you scream and
[1:01:42] you holler and you make yourself a fool
[1:01:44] for the basketball team and they might
[1:01:46] lose.
[1:01:48] Half the time they do.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody loses.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; But my Lord Jesus has never lost a
[1:01:56] battle.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; I'll be a fool for him. I'll be a fool
[1:02:00] for Christ. You can call me a holy
[1:02:02] roller, but my God's never lost a
[1:02:04] battle. I'm cheering on the side that's
[1:02:06] going to win.
[1:02:09] Malachi 4 shall turn the heart of the
[1:02:12] children back to the their day of
[1:02:15] Pentecost holy roller fathers.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Then the last little point I put down
[1:02:21] here, he said I I put down listening to
[1:02:25] how brother Brandham described
[1:02:26] everything and I just said the reason I
[1:02:30] want to be a holy rolly roller is
[1:02:32] because my God deserves to be worshiped
[1:02:35] with abandonment. He deserves to be
[1:02:37] worshiped without reservation. He
[1:02:39] deserves to be worshiped without without
[1:02:41] pride or thought of self. I'm not here
[1:02:45] to worship God so you can be impressed.
[1:02:47] I'm not here to worship God so that you
[1:02:49] can say, "Oh, wow. Look at how good he
[1:02:51] sings or look at how I don't care who's
[1:02:54] in the building. I'm not here to worship
[1:02:56] you. I'm here to worship my Lord Jesus
[1:02:58] Christ. He is the one that's worthy of
[1:03:00] my praise. He's the one that's worthy of
[1:03:02] my worship. And I'm not going to let any
[1:03:04] noise from any denomination, any dogma,
[1:03:07] anything try to keep back my worship to
[1:03:10] my Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; because he's worthy of it.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, our desire as a church should be to
[1:03:17] let God have his way among us, for
[1:03:19] Christ to have preeminence, for the
[1:03:22] spirit of God to have liberty to move
[1:03:24] among us and to be welcome. The spirit
[1:03:26] of God should be welcome to move, not
[1:03:28] restrained.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Because it's an antichrist spirit that
[1:03:32] tries to keep back the moving of the
[1:03:35] spirit
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of God is the Holy
[1:03:39] Ghost and and the the antichrist spirit.
[1:03:43] It just very simple antichrist. He's
[1:03:46] against the spirit. He don't like it. It
[1:03:48] really messes up his kingdom. You know,
[1:03:51] the prophet of God said in in the
[1:03:53] sermon, the power of God, he said, uh,
[1:03:55] he says, you know, pet Peter on the day
[1:03:57] of Pentecost preached and and 3,000
[1:03:59] souls came in, he says, and the devil
[1:04:01] never even moved over in bed.
[1:04:04] He says, but then a few days later at
[1:04:06] the gate, beautiful. He says when he
[1:04:08] raised a paralytic man, he said all hell
[1:04:12] turned loose. He says the devil hates it
[1:04:14] when you preach divine healing. He hates
[1:04:17] it when the power of God is displayed.
[1:04:19] Well, if the devil don't like it, then
[1:04:21] that's what I want to be doing. I want
[1:04:23] to tell you there's power in the name of
[1:04:25] Jesus Christ to heal every sick person,
[1:04:28] there's power in the name of Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ to raise you up and give you
[1:04:31] everything that you have need of. There
[1:04:33] is power and it's in my Lord Jesus. And
[1:04:36] he's here right now to release his power
[1:04:38] in your life.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; And if that makes the devil mad, then
[1:04:42] that makes me happy.
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:45] Now, restoration of the bride tree, a
[1:04:47] sermon I'm sure you're all familiar
[1:04:49] with. Brother Brandham, he he talks
[1:04:51] about how the first thing that happens
[1:04:52] was was a palmer worm came in. He says,
[1:04:55] and he says, "And that little bug came
[1:04:57] in and it began to destroy the fruit of
[1:04:59] the tree."
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And he began to show how the first thing
[1:05:02] it began to eat at was the joy.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He says it come in and he says, "Now you
[1:05:06] go back in the history and you see the
[1:05:08] first thing was a dignified group got
[1:05:10] among the common people.
[1:05:13] And you know what they began to say?
[1:05:14] Well, you know, we got to make this a
[1:05:16] little bit nicer. I mean, how am I going
[1:05:18] to go and bring my colleague from work
[1:05:20] to a group that's a bunch of holy
[1:05:21] rollers? How am I going to present them
[1:05:24] to a a religion like this? And and so he
[1:05:27] says they they said, "Well, we ought to
[1:05:28] get it out of where the bigger class of
[1:05:30] people can understand it and the better
[1:05:32] class and the mayor and the judges and
[1:05:34] so forth and and the dignitaries of the
[1:05:36] city. And as long as you all are
[1:05:38] carrying on the way you are, they'll
[1:05:40] never come around." See, they're afraid
[1:05:42] of you.
[1:05:45] You know why? Because it's the old time
[1:05:48] Holy Spirit. And the devil won't go near
[1:05:51] it. That's the reason people fear it.
[1:05:53] But it's good enough for me. Give me
[1:05:55] that old time religion. Give me that old
[1:05:58] time religion. Give me that old time
[1:06:01] religion. It's good enough for me. But
[1:06:04] the devil don't like it. And so they
[1:06:06] were trying to change the church to make
[1:06:08] a lukewarm spirit comfortable in the
[1:06:10] house of God. But that's not what we're
[1:06:12] interested in doing. We want to make the
[1:06:14] Holy Ghost welcome in the church, not
[1:06:16] some kind of a dignified spirit of a
[1:06:18] devil.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; That Palmer worm began to eat away at
[1:06:31] the fruit of joy.
[1:06:34] That's what he began to attack. First
[1:06:36] thing, first attack, get at the joy. If
[1:06:38] he can get away from to get the joy out
[1:06:40] because the joy of the Lord is your
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to fight against
[1:06:46] somebody that didn't have any strength?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Kind of makes it easy.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Kill their joy.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You need to fight for your joy, brothers
[1:06:53] and sisters.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to take your joy and
[1:06:57] he's trying to destroy it. He's trying
[1:06:58] to try and take that out of your life
[1:07:00] because when you lose that joy, you
[1:07:03] become weak. But when you can hold on to
[1:07:05] that joy of the Lord, there's something
[1:07:07] about it. The joy of the Lord just puts
[1:07:08] a strength in your life. It puts a
[1:07:10] strength in your arm to take that sword
[1:07:12] and take his head off.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; But the devil, you know, the devil's not
[1:07:16] an idiot.
[1:07:18] You know, he's been defeated. He's been
[1:07:20] stripped of every power. He's been he's
[1:07:22] been everything's been taken out of his
[1:07:24] hand, his abilities, his or his uh his
[1:07:27] weapons. He's been stripped by Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ. So, he's a defeated foe with no
[1:07:31] weapon. And so, he has to sit there and
[1:07:33] try to come up with an attack against a
[1:07:35] people that have been well equipped by
[1:07:36] the power of God.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; So, he tries to convince them to lay
[1:07:40] aside the word, lay aside the power, lay
[1:07:42] aside the joy, lay aside because then if
[1:07:44] he can get you stripped down of
[1:07:45] everything God gave you, well, he can
[1:07:47] handle that.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; But I ain't laying down for no devil.
[1:07:51] Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; He says over here in a deceived church
[1:07:54] by the world, he says, "Where is our
[1:07:56] power? Where is our glory?" And now I
[1:07:59] want you to recognize that I'm talking
[1:08:01] he's talking to a people who had
[1:08:03] rejected the message of the hour in in
[1:08:06] in a big picture. That's what he's
[1:08:07] speaking to. And he's calling to them
[1:08:09] that they they should have recognized
[1:08:11] it. But if you can recognize the trans
[1:08:13] the opposite of that, if they rejected
[1:08:16] the word and it stripped them of their
[1:08:18] power, if you receive the word, you're
[1:08:20] receiving deity, which is omnipotence.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Now he says, where is our power? Where
[1:08:25] is our glory? Where is it? Because we
[1:08:28] went after a wisdom of man instead of
[1:08:30] the power of God. Why? They got our
[1:08:34] preachers and things so stiff and
[1:08:35] starchy till they're organized. Till
[1:08:37] we're so starchy and stiff necked. Till
[1:08:39] people, you never hear a shout in the
[1:08:41] church no more. You never hear anybody
[1:08:43] cry. The mourner's bench is put in the
[1:08:45] basement and there's no more glory in
[1:08:48] the church. And all we do is just sit
[1:08:50] back just as stiff as we can be. And and
[1:08:52] we're not free. We're bound. The devil
[1:08:54] with his modernistic demons has bound
[1:08:57] the church of the living God. That's
[1:08:59] right. This is in a parallel of Samson
[1:09:01] is how he's bringing this out. He says
[1:09:03] there's no more powers in the church.
[1:09:05] There's no more freedom. The people are
[1:09:06] so starchy and stiff. Why? The God can
[1:09:09] come in the midst of Pentecostal people
[1:09:11] and show that he's God and prove his
[1:09:14] signs of his resurrection. It don't even
[1:09:17] shake them. Oh, glory. Why? It's a
[1:09:20] disgrace. I walk across the country, God
[1:09:23] working, performing signs, and people
[1:09:25] sit and say, "Well, I guess that's all
[1:09:27] right. Oh, I know it can be done." It
[1:09:30] doesn't move them. Why? They're bound
[1:09:34] with Delilah. The world they're in
[1:09:37] feathers. But I refuse to be bound by
[1:09:40] demons of modernistic religion that try
[1:09:43] to keep me from moving under the power
[1:09:44] of almighty God. When I see what God did
[1:09:47] in this generation, when I see the power
[1:09:50] of God that was released and showed the
[1:09:52] manifestation of the son of man, it does
[1:09:54] something to me, brothers and sisters.
[1:09:56] It begins to move me. It puts a joy in
[1:09:58] my heart to know the hour that I'm
[1:10:00] living in. There is a power and a
[1:10:03] reality in this message that it does not
[1:10:05] leave you sitting in some kind of a
[1:10:07] Delilah feeds. It raises you up under
[1:10:09] the power of the spirit.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Bound by modernistic demons.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Not this one.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; No sir. I believe in liberty. I believe
[1:10:26] in the freedom to yield to the spirit.
[1:10:30] Now, now people get this mixed up idea
[1:10:32] in America especially about liberty
[1:10:34] because it's one of the few countries
[1:10:35] where we actually have it. But you know,
[1:10:37] they think liberty means I get to do
[1:10:39] whatever I want.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; No. No. Because you might want to do
[1:10:44] something that's going to hurt somebody
[1:10:46] else. That's not what liberty means.
[1:10:48] Liberty doesn't mean you get to run over
[1:10:49] and kick somebody in the shins. That's
[1:10:51] not liberty. Liberty is the freedom to
[1:10:54] do what's right. That's what liberty
[1:10:56] actually is. And that's why in the
[1:10:58] government of man, it's such a conflict
[1:11:00] because nobody knows what's right. But
[1:11:02] this nation was established based off of
[1:11:04] the premise that God's word was right.
[1:11:06] And they had a biblical foundation for
[1:11:08] this nation. And because they
[1:11:09] established it on that, we actually had
[1:11:11] true liberty because the people were
[1:11:13] permitted to do what was right. Now, in
[1:11:16] the church of the living God, liberty
[1:11:18] doesn't mean you get to run over and
[1:11:19] kick somebody in the shins. Liberty
[1:11:21] doesn't mean you get to do just whatever
[1:11:23] you want. Liberty means you have the
[1:11:25] freedom to yield to the spirit of God.
[1:11:29] It means when he comes down, he's
[1:11:31] allowed to do whatever he wants.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And there's vessels that are willing to
[1:11:35] let him flow through their life.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I believe we need to be flexible.
[1:11:41] You go into the Palmerworm and the
[1:11:42] locust and brother Ram Tar's talking
[1:11:44] about them trees and how there was a
[1:11:46] group of trees that were really stiff
[1:11:47] and cold and formal. He says, "But there
[1:11:49] were some other ones that were flowing
[1:11:50] and flexible and yielding. When the
[1:11:52] spirit of God would come down and move,
[1:11:55] they would just jump and they'd move and
[1:11:57] they'd flow with the moving of the
[1:11:58] spirit."
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, we need to be
[1:12:02] flexible however God wants to move.
[1:12:05] We're not here to say, "God, you have to
[1:12:07] come down and make everybody speak in
[1:12:08] tongues." No, no, no, no. You're putting
[1:12:10] my God in a box, and he don't live in a
[1:12:12] box. You say, "Oh, well, God, you got to
[1:12:14] come down and you got everybody make
[1:12:15] everybody weep at the altar." Well, my
[1:12:17] God just doesn't work inside of a box.
[1:12:19] He doesn't work inside of your program.
[1:12:21] He's an omnipotent God and he does it
[1:12:23] his own way. He's a sovereign God. But
[1:12:26] if he wants to come down and make
[1:12:27] everyone in this church speak in
[1:12:29] tonesues, then I'm going to be one that
[1:12:30] says, "Lord," then I'll speak in
[1:12:32] tonesues. If he wants to come down and
[1:12:34] he wants to give every one of you your
[1:12:36] joy shoes today, then I say, "Let him
[1:12:38] have his way." He's at liberty to do
[1:12:41] what he wants in the church of the
[1:12:43] living God.
[1:12:45] There's a lot of places that won't make
[1:12:46] him welcome. There's a lot of places
[1:12:48] that won't give him the liberty to do
[1:12:50] what he wants to do.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But brothers and sisters, this bride of
[1:12:54] Jesus Christ, she is yielded to his
[1:12:58] will.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I remember I was talking to a
[1:13:04] brother and he was a he's about three
[1:13:07] 400 lb. A great big old guy and and not
[1:13:10] all that tall. and and he was talking
[1:13:13] about how he was really wanting the Holy
[1:13:15] Ghost, but he'd seen some people when
[1:13:18] they got the Holy Ghost start to
[1:13:19] dancing. And he just said, "God, you
[1:13:22] know, I want the Holy Ghost, but I I'm
[1:13:24] not going to dance." He says, "Cuz I'd
[1:13:26] look so embarrassing as a 400 pound man
[1:13:28] dancing across the building." He says,
[1:13:30] "I" He says, "I'd be bouncing and
[1:13:31] jiggling all over." He says, "I won't do
[1:13:33] it. I won't do it."
[1:13:36] And he didn't get it. And he didn't get
[1:13:39] it. And he got more and more desperate.
[1:13:41] And finally he said, "God, I don't care
[1:13:44] what happens. I don't care what I have
[1:13:46] to do. I don't care what you do to me.
[1:13:49] Just give me the Holy Ghost." And when
[1:13:51] the Holy Ghost struck him, you know
[1:13:53] what? It did take his pride out of him
[1:13:54] because he jumped out of there and he
[1:13:56] took off screaming and ran across the
[1:13:57] building. A great big fat guy jiggling
[1:13:59] all over the place. But he got the Holy
[1:14:01] Ghost and that's what mattered.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Don't tell my God how you're going to
[1:14:06] receive it or how you're not going to
[1:14:08] receive it. Just say, "God, give it to
[1:14:10] me cuz I want it."
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; You got to be flexible. However he wants
[1:14:15] to move, Lord, you're welcome to move.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; You know, we live in we live in this
[1:14:20] world. This is a leodyian last church
[1:14:22] age that we're living in here and all
[1:14:24] around us. There is a lukewarmness and
[1:14:27] that's the spirit that's on this age to
[1:14:29] be lukewarm. So, if you know the
[1:14:32] conditions is to be lukewarm, then don't
[1:14:34] lean towards cold formalism. Lean toward
[1:14:36] fieryism. All right. Like if we know
[1:14:39] which way the age is going, let's kind
[1:14:42] of try and get on the side where we know
[1:14:44] the spirit of God's moving.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; The sermon Why I am a holy roller, he
[1:14:49] says, uh, having a form of godliness
[1:14:52] fundamentally
[1:14:54] just as fundamental as the other one
[1:14:56] was. you know, in Balum Balam and he'd
[1:14:59] seen the he's seen the church and he
[1:15:01] seen them there and he had his church
[1:15:03] and he had his religion and he had his
[1:15:04] altar and he was seeing all the faults
[1:15:07] and the failures and if I were to sit
[1:15:09] down and I were to pull out my critical
[1:15:10] eyeglass, I could pick apart anybody's
[1:15:12] life here because you know what? You're
[1:15:14] all sinners saved by grace. Every one of
[1:15:17] you has mistakes in your life. And if
[1:15:20] you don't, then uh you're either in a
[1:15:22] theophony or you're deceived. And so we
[1:15:26] could look at that and we could look at
[1:15:27] the faults. We could look at the
[1:15:28] failures in this church. And that's what
[1:15:30] Balam was doing. He was looking at the
[1:15:32] faults. He was looking at the failures.
[1:15:34] But you know what? He failed to
[1:15:35] recognize
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; the shout of the king at the camp. He
[1:15:39] failed to recognize there was a pillar
[1:15:41] of fire and there was a brazen serpent
[1:15:43] there and there was a sacrifice for the
[1:15:45] sins of those people.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He failed to recognize the supernatural
[1:15:49] God was present in the midst of them
[1:15:52] people with all them problems. But here
[1:15:54] he says they having a form of godliness
[1:15:57] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:16:00] turn away. Then brother Bram says I did
[1:16:03] and I became a holy roller that when the
[1:16:06] wind goes to blowing I can give into it.
[1:16:08] Say yes Lord I believe you're the same
[1:16:10] Jesus Christ that rose from the dead.
[1:16:12] You live yet today and the spirit of God
[1:16:14] just sweeps it from one side to the
[1:16:16] other. You think we're crazy but we're
[1:16:18] just not. We just got the life and
[1:16:20] flexible. Go ahead and mourn if you want
[1:16:22] to. God's moving his his undergrowth
[1:16:25] coming right on up. She's going right on
[1:16:28] in the seed. Look, I I'll stand with the
[1:16:31] St. Paul this afternoon and say this. In
[1:16:33] the way that's called heresy or
[1:16:35] foolishness, crazy. That's the way I
[1:16:37] worship the God of our fathers. And what
[1:16:39] the world calls today holy roller,
[1:16:41] that's the way I worship Jesus Christ.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, it's not an
[1:16:48] accusation. It's not an insult. It's a
[1:16:51] compliment. If somebody calls you a holy
[1:16:53] roller, you ought to live such a life
[1:16:55] that the people at work think that guy's
[1:16:57] just a little bit different. You know,
[1:16:59] he's not quite like the rest of us are.
[1:17:02] You're right. I'm called a holy roller.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; I'm called a a Pentecostal. Acts 2:38
[1:17:08] blabbering young. And why I'm a holy
[1:17:11] roller here one more place. He says,
[1:17:13] think of it now. Are you filled with the
[1:17:15] Holy Spirit? Are you in the kingdom of
[1:17:17] God or are you just a strictly a
[1:17:21] fundamental believer
[1:17:23] and God's never a vindicated anything to
[1:17:26] you yet? Oh, step away from that tree.
[1:17:29] Get over on the other side here where
[1:17:31] the powers of God is moving.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, it's not See, if you find
[1:17:37] yourself in a position, that's not the
[1:17:39] time just to sit down and and say, "Oh,
[1:17:41] how miserable and how terrible and how
[1:17:42] horrible." Just get up and move. get up
[1:17:44] and go over where the power of God is
[1:17:47] falling and say, "God, I'm not staying
[1:17:49] in that condition. I'm coming over here
[1:17:51] and saying, God, pour out your spirit on
[1:17:53] me. Give me that flexibility to follow
[1:17:56] your leadership however you would move."
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; What I'm telling you this evening is to
[1:18:02] break through the denominational
[1:18:04] man-made barriers. Now, denominations,
[1:18:06] friends, it's not just something out
[1:18:08] there with a church steeple on it. It's
[1:18:10] not just something that you know is
[1:18:12] registered on the church registries of
[1:18:14] churches in the country. Denominations
[1:18:16] is when somebody takes a thought
[1:18:18] contrary to the word of God and they
[1:18:20] hunker down on that and they begin to
[1:18:21] separate fellowship and they begin to
[1:18:23] hold to something else besides the word
[1:18:25] of God. But I say this church is not to
[1:18:28] be a denominational church. She is to be
[1:18:30] a word church that stands for the word
[1:18:32] of God. But when the enemy comes in and
[1:18:34] tries to put something there to keep you
[1:18:36] from getting through to the blessings of
[1:18:38] God,
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; just blow right through it.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be subject to it.
[1:18:43] You're not a denomination. You are a
[1:18:45] free independent woman.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; What I'm telling you this evening is
[1:18:50] that it's time to go beyond the sound
[1:18:53] barrier. It's time to break past that
[1:18:55] limitation that says, "No, that's not
[1:18:57] for you." trying to break past that
[1:18:59] limitation that says no that's not
[1:19:01] really for the church of God says who
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; my Bible says it's for you and to your
[1:19:07] children and to as many are as far off
[1:19:09] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:19:11] ever call.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; He's still calling because he called me.
[1:19:15] So I I know it's true.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is it's time to break
[1:19:19] into the bride's revival. It's time to
[1:19:22] get away from man-made religion,
[1:19:24] man-made theology, and man-made
[1:19:26] revivals, and break into the revival of
[1:19:28] the opening of the word of God.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Now, to to break this down a little bit,
[1:19:33] Brother Brandham says here in the third
[1:19:34] seal, he's talking about how the
[1:19:36] churches, they don't really have a
[1:19:38] revival nowhere. And then he says the
[1:19:40] bride hasn't had a revival. He says
[1:19:43] there's been no revival, no
[1:19:45] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:19:47] yet. He says, "We're looking for it now.
[1:19:49] And it'll take those seven unknown
[1:19:52] thunders back there to wake her up
[1:19:55] again." See, he'll send it. He promised
[1:19:57] it. Now, watch. Now, if you notice, that
[1:20:00] was in the third seal. He's talking
[1:20:02] about how how the there there hasn't
[1:20:04] been no great revival, no great
[1:20:05] stirring. There hasn't been, you know,
[1:20:07] they've got churches. They got a million
[1:20:08] more in 44. But he says there's been no
[1:20:11] revival to stir the bride.
[1:20:14] He says, "But it'll take the seven
[1:20:16] unknown thunders." And if you understand
[1:20:19] the message, he answers in questions and
[1:20:20] answers 1964.
[1:20:23] He says, "They were asking, "What about
[1:20:25] the seven thunders?" He says, "Well,
[1:20:27] they were revealed in the seven seals.
[1:20:30] That's what the thunders was about."
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; So the bride's revival that was going to
[1:20:35] come by the seven thunders is what was
[1:20:38] happening when the seals were being
[1:20:40] opened. That's what released the bride's
[1:20:43] revival to the church of the living God
[1:20:45] was that opening of the word. The
[1:20:47] opening of the word is the bride's
[1:20:49] revival. The opening of the word is the
[1:20:51] awakening of this bride out of a dark
[1:20:53] denominationalism.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Now, what does it mean to be in revival?
[1:20:59] What are we what is this that happened
[1:21:01] in this last day? It's a word revival.
[1:21:03] It's prophesied by the scriptures. It's
[1:21:05] it's in Acts chapter 3. He said the the
[1:21:09] angel, they asked him, "Well, what about
[1:21:10] this?" And and they said, "He shall send
[1:21:12] Jesus Christ, which was before preached
[1:21:14] unto you, whom the heaven must receive
[1:21:17] until
[1:21:19] the times of the restitution of all
[1:21:22] things, which God hath spoken by the
[1:21:24] mouth of his all his holy prophets since
[1:21:27] the world began." And the prophet of God
[1:21:30] said, "Now is the day of the restoration
[1:21:34] of all things."
[1:21:36] So, where are we living at? We're living
[1:21:38] in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:21:40] That is the hour we're living in. And
[1:21:42] and in the rising of the sun, he he
[1:21:44] tells the people, listen, he says they
[1:21:46] didn't know what it was, but we knew, if
[1:21:49] you'll just look this away, it's our
[1:21:51] Lord up there. You see, he's the one who
[1:21:54] opened those seals.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was our Lord Jesus Christ. That
[1:21:59] mighty angel that came. He took the
[1:22:01] book. He tore off the seals. and he came
[1:22:03] down to reveal it to his people.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, what's attraction on
[1:22:08] the mountain? I know you understand
[1:22:10] these things. You're a well taught
[1:22:11] church, but uh we're going to go right
[1:22:14] back over it again.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "And this happened on Sunset
[1:22:17] Mountain. It's the evening time, sunset
[1:22:20] time, the sunset message through a
[1:22:22] setting of history, a setting of
[1:22:24] prophecy rather, being fulfilled, and it
[1:22:26] shall be light in the evening time upon
[1:22:29] Sunset Mountain at the Coronado Forest."
[1:22:31] What was he talking about? That cloud we
[1:22:33] see. He says that's our Lord up there.
[1:22:37] That's when he said that he came to open
[1:22:39] them seals. And he says, "What happened
[1:22:40] upon Mount Sunset?" God confirming his
[1:22:44] word. That's what all this noise is
[1:22:46] about. It's God fulfilling his promised
[1:22:48] word again of Revelations 10:1-7. In the
[1:22:51] days of the sounding of the voice of the
[1:22:53] seventh angel's message, the mystery of
[1:22:56] God should be finished. The hidden
[1:22:58] mystery of Revelations 10:1-7. You
[1:23:01] remember there was the seven thunders in
[1:23:03] there. Revelations 10:1-7. The last
[1:23:06] message to the last church age fulfills
[1:23:08] exactly in this age. St. Luke 17:30, the
[1:23:11] day when the son of man shall be
[1:23:14] revealed.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, the hour we're
[1:23:18] living in is the hour of the bride's
[1:23:19] revival. And he says here in uh anointed
[1:23:23] ones at the end time he says and
[1:23:24] remember the third poll was the opening
[1:23:26] of them seven seals to reveal the hidden
[1:23:29] truth that's been sealed in the word.
[1:23:32] Now now I want to just you know this
[1:23:34] this might seem a little bit deep or
[1:23:37] technical but we look at the the opening
[1:23:39] of the word. We look at the seven seals.
[1:23:41] We look at the revealing of the son of
[1:23:43] man. We see all of these things and it
[1:23:45] it's it's a great and a glorious thing.
[1:23:47] But I don't want you to get caught up in
[1:23:49] thinking it's an intellectual
[1:23:50] understanding. It's not. It's a
[1:23:52] revelation. This message was sent not to
[1:23:55] tickle your mind, not to tickle your
[1:23:57] understanding or or make you feel more
[1:23:59] educated than your neighbor. It was sent
[1:24:01] by revelation to the bride of Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ. And and so this this this
[1:24:06] bride's revival, this opening of the
[1:24:08] word, this opening of the seals, I just
[1:24:10] want to go just one step farther into it
[1:24:12] and see that bride's revival in both the
[1:24:15] prophet's message and in the book of
[1:24:17] Revelations
[1:24:20] book. If we turn over here to
[1:24:23] Revelations chapter 5,
[1:24:28] because the bride is to have a revival
[1:24:31] and John as a type of the bride of Jesus
[1:24:34] Christ gives us a demonstration of what
[1:24:37] that revival is about.
[1:24:39] And we see that he was standing there
[1:24:41] and he was weeping. Now, if if there's
[1:24:44] no worthy one,
[1:24:47] then then we should be weeping. If
[1:24:49] there's no worthy one, then we should be
[1:24:51] in sorrow and we should be in sadness
[1:24:53] and we should be discouraged and we
[1:24:55] shouldn't have any joy in our life. If
[1:24:56] there is not a worthy one, then you've
[1:24:59] got a right to have a long face. But if
[1:25:01] there is a worthy one,
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And it says in it says in Revelations 5
[1:25:07] and:e 3, there was no man in heaven nor
[1:25:09] in earth, nor under the earth was able
[1:25:11] to look upon the book, neither to to to
[1:25:13] open the book to look thereon. And and
[1:25:15] John began to weep because there was no
[1:25:18] man found worthy.
[1:25:20] No man. But then he heard a message
[1:25:25] said, "Weep not, John. Don't cry. Don't
[1:25:28] weep. Because the lion of the tribe of
[1:25:30] Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed
[1:25:33] to open the book, and to loose the seven
[1:25:35] seals thereof." And when he turned to
[1:25:37] look, he seen a lamb. He seen a lamb
[1:25:40] that was bloody, and it was had been
[1:25:42] slain, having having seven horns. and
[1:25:44] he's seen that lamb. It was the Lord
[1:25:47] Jesus Christ which was the worthy one.
[1:25:50] He was a kinsman. He had to be a man. A
[1:25:54] man that was found worthy to take that
[1:25:56] book and to open it. And when that one
[1:25:58] was found, it brought forth such a joy
[1:26:01] and such a revival in John. When he took
[1:26:04] that book and opened it up, it says John
[1:26:06] began to ha scream and shout and have
[1:26:08] himself an oldfashioned holy roller
[1:26:10] meeting. Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandaman, the sermon breach
[1:26:15] between the seven church ages and the
[1:26:16] seven seals. He says, "Talk about a
[1:26:19] jubilee." Now, I'm I'm tying this
[1:26:21] directly in with the bride's revival.
[1:26:23] Because you remember the bride's revival
[1:26:25] is the seven thunders. It's the opening
[1:26:27] of the seals. It's the opening of the
[1:26:29] word. That's the bride's revival. And
[1:26:31] so, we see right here, he says, "Talk
[1:26:33] about a jubilee. Talk about a time when
[1:26:35] the lamb walked forth." See, the book is
[1:26:38] even sealed in heaven. the mysteries are
[1:26:40] say is my name there I don't know I hope
[1:26:42] it is but if it is it was put on the
[1:26:45] book before the foundation of the world
[1:26:47] but the first thing that represented
[1:26:49] that redemption come the lamb that had
[1:26:52] been slain from the foundation of the
[1:26:53] world and he took the book oh glory he
[1:26:56] opened the book and he tore off the
[1:26:58] seals and sent it down to the earth to
[1:27:01] his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:27:04] people
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah there you are oh my what
[1:27:08] happened. The screams, the shouts, the
[1:27:10] hallelujah, the anointed, the power, the
[1:27:13] glory, the manifestation.
[1:27:15] And old John who'd been standing there,
[1:27:17] our brother crying. Why? He said,
[1:27:19] "Everything in heaven and everything in
[1:27:21] the earth and everything in the sea,
[1:27:22] heard me holler, "Amen. Amen. Blessings,
[1:27:26] honor, and might, and power be to him
[1:27:28] that lives forever and ever." Talk about
[1:27:31] a happy time when them seals broke. John
[1:27:35] must have looked in and seen a past the
[1:27:38] curtain of time and said, "There's
[1:27:40] John."
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brothers and sisters,
[1:27:44] this bride's revival is based off of
[1:27:47] something more than what the the
[1:27:48] presbbiter said to say. This is based
[1:27:51] off of something more than what the Pope
[1:27:52] had to say. This bride's revival is
[1:27:55] based off of the word coming open. And a
[1:27:57] people see their identity and they say,
[1:27:59] "I'm a part of this from before the
[1:28:01] foundation of the world." There's
[1:28:03] nothing in time that can ever take me
[1:28:05] out of his hand. There's nothing that
[1:28:07] can happen to me that could keep me from
[1:28:08] going in a rapture. If that don't put a
[1:28:10] joy bell ringing in your heart, I don't
[1:28:12] know what would.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Oh, John got almighty
[1:28:18] happy. Another place he said, you know,
[1:28:20] that got next to John, he must have saw
[1:28:23] his name wrote there when them seals
[1:28:25] broke. He must have got real happy.
[1:28:29] And you know what that holy roll of
[1:28:31] religion from before the foundation of
[1:28:33] the world when the sons of God were
[1:28:34] shouting for joy. You know what the
[1:28:36] prophet tells us? He said, "No wonder
[1:28:38] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:28:40] sons of God shouted for joy." When they
[1:28:42] seen the plan of salvation, God putting
[1:28:45] your name on the book before the
[1:28:47] foundation of the world.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; So this bride's revival, these sons of
[1:28:51] God shouting for joy was before the
[1:28:53] foundation of the world because of names
[1:28:55] being on the book. And here we are at
[1:28:57] the closing of time and we're shouting
[1:28:59] and we're rejoicing and we're praising
[1:29:01] God because we've seen into that book
[1:29:03] and we've seen our personal
[1:29:04] identification by a revelation that says
[1:29:07] you're a part of this.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Oh brothers and sisters, when that word
[1:29:11] comes open and it's no longer a question
[1:29:13] of I hope so, maybe so maybe I'll take a
[1:29:15] rapture. Possibly I could. But when you
[1:29:18] realize you're a part of this by the
[1:29:20] elective grace of God from before the
[1:29:22] foundation of the world, why, you can
[1:29:24] let off the pressure, friends. You can
[1:29:26] just let down your hair and have a good
[1:29:28] old time.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; John had himself a revival when that
[1:29:32] book came opened. The opening of the
[1:29:34] word gave him an identity. It gave him a
[1:29:37] position. He knew who he was. And boy,
[1:29:40] that that that gives you some courage.
[1:29:42] Gives you something to stand on because,
[1:29:43] you know, we we come into this age and
[1:29:45] there's a spiritual amnesia that's come
[1:29:48] and it's on you and and you say, "Oh, I
[1:29:50] don't know who I am. I don't know where
[1:29:51] I came from. I don't know where I'm
[1:29:52] going. There's all this confusion." But
[1:29:54] God sent a message to break that
[1:29:57] spiritual amnesia to give you an
[1:29:59] identity to tell you where you came from
[1:30:01] and who you are and where you're going.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, we don't have
[1:30:06] to be living in a day of hope. So maybe
[1:30:08] so confusion we can stand in our
[1:30:10] identity as the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; here in Christ the mystery of God
[1:30:15] revealed he says oh now we're going to
[1:30:19] get to where all that group together
[1:30:21] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:30:23] harmony and and God expressing it
[1:30:25] through his word by the same actions the
[1:30:27] same things that he did making the word
[1:30:30] manifest. Oh, if the church only knew
[1:30:33] its position, it will one day. Then the
[1:30:35] rapture will go when it knows what it
[1:30:38] is.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's only the opening of the word
[1:30:41] that can reveal it to you. It's only
[1:30:43] that revelation of of your identity in
[1:30:45] Christ Jesus and who and what you are to
[1:30:47] get that picture. And you won't get it
[1:30:50] out of some denominational almanac. Get
[1:30:52] your hands off of all them commentaries
[1:30:54] of denominations and get yourself into
[1:30:56] the message of the hour because it's
[1:30:58] your eagle food. We're not supposed to
[1:31:00] be feeding on chicken feed. Leave that
[1:31:02] for them. It's good for them. Don't take
[1:31:04] it away from them. That's for them. But
[1:31:06] you're eagles. You should be feeding on
[1:31:09] eagle food. Get your face out of the
[1:31:11] magazine, out of the television, out of
[1:31:12] the YouTube, and get yourself into the
[1:31:15] revealed word of the hour. That'll
[1:31:16] change your mortal body.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; This message of the hour has called your
[1:31:22] name. It's called you by person. It's an
[1:31:26] identifying name. And it said, "You are
[1:31:29] my bride,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; not just a church."
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God speaking, I've had this,
[1:31:35] "Who is this Melzdc talking about that
[1:31:37] eagle scream?" And he says, "Then
[1:31:40] after," because you say, "Well, what's
[1:31:41] it mean to to see my name? Am I going to
[1:31:44] go over there and and what's your name,
[1:31:46] brother?"
[1:31:47] Greg.
[1:31:49] Are you looking in the Bible trying to
[1:31:51] find where it's written Greg? You know,
[1:31:53] maybe when you were a kid, you did a
[1:31:54] search. Is Greg in the Bible? Brother
[1:31:56] Jonathan, did you you ever you ever go
[1:31:58] through there and when you read about
[1:31:59] Jonathan, doesn't it just kind of nice
[1:32:01] to read Jonathan and identify that, hey,
[1:32:04] I'm one that stands with the anointed of
[1:32:06] the Lord, doesn't that just it just kind
[1:32:07] of does something for you? But, you
[1:32:09] know, I'm not looking through the Bible
[1:32:11] trying to find my name written like
[1:32:12] that.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; But when I read
[1:32:17] my identification, when I read, there's
[1:32:21] going to be a people that will revive
[1:32:22] and remain to the coming of the Lord.
[1:32:24] When I read, "Behold, I send you Elijah
[1:32:26] the prophet," I say, "That was for me."
[1:32:28] I see my identification because that
[1:32:31] message was sent to me. I'm beginning to
[1:32:33] read myself into the book. I begin to
[1:32:36] see that everything that was a type of
[1:32:38] of of you see how Joseph was a type of
[1:32:40] Jesus. You see how uh these different
[1:32:42] ones were types and shadows of Jesus,
[1:32:44] but Jesus came and he was the reality of
[1:32:47] every one of those types and shadows.
[1:32:48] And I am beginning to see something in
[1:32:50] this hour. how that there was a type in
[1:32:52] Esther and there was a type in Ruth and
[1:32:54] there was a type in in all these
[1:32:56] different ones through the scriptures.
[1:32:57] There was a type in Enoch. There was a
[1:32:59] type in Abraham. But I'm not looking at
[1:33:01] a type today. I'm looking at the
[1:33:03] manifestation. I'm looking at the
[1:33:05] reality of the shadow standing in front
[1:33:07] of me. the bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:33:10] all of those was a shadow. Oh,
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says here,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; then after you recognize the very word
[1:33:18] of God was eagle food. Then you left the
[1:33:22] other thing. You have been formed into
[1:33:24] the living image of the living God. You
[1:33:26] heard from your theophony. For if this
[1:33:29] earthly body be dissolved, we have one
[1:33:32] waiting invisible union. Just like I
[1:33:34] said the other day, that little eagle
[1:33:36] when he heard the bridegroom's voice.
[1:33:40] Oh, do you recognize who this message
[1:33:41] is? This message is not the thoughts of
[1:33:44] William Brandom. This message came from
[1:33:46] that pillar of fire that used his voice
[1:33:48] to speak a message to you. This message
[1:33:51] is Jesus Christ. He says, "And when you
[1:33:54] just like that eagle, when you heard the
[1:33:56] bridegroom's voice and he went to it,
[1:33:59] the anointed vindicated word of God for
[1:34:02] the last day." Oh, have you recognized
[1:34:05] the bridegroom's voice? Have you heard
[1:34:07] that cry and something said, "That's my
[1:34:09] anointed. That's my mate, the anointed
[1:34:12] word. That's what I've been called to.
[1:34:14] That's the one that I'm in love with."
[1:34:16] Oh, brothers and sisters, you have heard
[1:34:19] from your theophony when there's
[1:34:21] something inside of you that connects
[1:34:23] with the message of the hour.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, end time evangelism here. He says
[1:34:29] the end time message is to get the bride
[1:34:31] ready and prepared for the rapture. What
[1:34:34] can it do according to Malachi 4 is
[1:34:37] bringing them back to the faith that was
[1:34:39] once delivered to the saints. Bring them
[1:34:41] back to the faith of the fathers. the
[1:34:43] Pentecostal part. In the restoration
[1:34:46] time, I will restore saith the Lord.
[1:34:50] That's real event, end time evangelism.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; How many wants real event in time
[1:34:57] evangelism? He says it's a restoration
[1:35:00] back to what I read about this morning.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; A restoration back to the Pentecostal
[1:35:06] part. He says, 'I dare anybody, the
[1:35:09] indictment, I dare anybody to come under
[1:35:12] the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any
[1:35:14] promise in there, God is obligated to
[1:35:17] take care of it.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Well, that's pretty strong speech. But
[1:35:21] when you know your identity, when you
[1:35:23] know at the as the wife, you have a
[1:35:25] right to the checkbook. When you know
[1:35:26] that as the wife of the of the groom,
[1:35:29] you have a right to everything he paid
[1:35:31] for. It's not a question of, "Well, I
[1:35:33] wonder, could I, maybe I." Your name's
[1:35:35] already written on that checkbook. You
[1:35:38] can take possession of what everything
[1:35:40] you have need of. Says, "I dare you to
[1:35:42] come under the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:35:44] claim any promise in there."
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[1:35:51] believe.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; But you know, the devil, he don't want
[1:35:55] you getting into the effects of the
[1:35:56] resurrection. He don't want you getting
[1:35:58] into the power of God. He doesn't want
[1:36:00] you to get your blessings that Jesus
[1:36:02] Christ paid for. No. And so he caused
[1:36:05] man-made religion to come and to crucify
[1:36:09] Jesus Christ.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; The second time
[1:36:13] in the indictment here, he says they are
[1:36:15] crucifying the effects of the gospel
[1:36:19] upon the people by their creeds.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; What is a creed? A man-made idea.
[1:36:27] The devil's got many a creed sitting in
[1:36:29] a message church.
[1:36:31] Devil comes in, puts some kind of a
[1:36:33] man-made idea in your mind that says you
[1:36:35] can't have it.
[1:36:37] And you'll let that manmade creed that
[1:36:40] the devil put in your mind have more
[1:36:42] preeminence than the word of God. But I
[1:36:45] say, brothers and sisters, it's time to
[1:36:47] lay aside every thought. It's time to
[1:36:49] lay aside every man-made creed and let
[1:36:51] the full effects of the gospel loose in
[1:36:54] the church of the living God.
[1:36:56] He says that's the crucifixion. That's
[1:36:58] where the public set in these big morgs
[1:37:01] called churches, denominations, and draw
[1:37:03] a line of creed that they had. And the
[1:37:06] word can't have an effect upon them
[1:37:09] because they condemn the very thing that
[1:37:11] Christ said would take place. It just
[1:37:13] don't come according to their creed. And
[1:37:16] neither did Jesus come according to
[1:37:17] their understanding of him. He come in
[1:37:19] the way that God sent him. And he come
[1:37:21] exactly with the word. And no wonder he
[1:37:24] said he hid it hid from the eyes of the
[1:37:26] wise and prudent and revealed it to
[1:37:28] babes such as would learn. Oh, do you
[1:37:31] understand? Oh, they have crucified the
[1:37:34] effects of the word. That's what that
[1:37:36] antichrist spirit is trying to
[1:37:38] accomplish. It's trying to crucify the
[1:37:40] effect. You want to believe in
[1:37:42] salvation? Fine. But it's not going to
[1:37:44] do you any good. It's going to be for
[1:37:45] somebody else. You want to believe God
[1:37:47] heals? Fine. But it's not going to have
[1:37:49] any effect in your life. He's trying to
[1:37:51] take the effectiveness of the gospel of
[1:37:53] Jesus Christ out of your life. But I say
[1:37:56] that this bride of Jesus Christ is going
[1:37:58] to be living under the full effects of
[1:38:00] the word of God. She's going to be
[1:38:02] enjoying every benefit and blessing of
[1:38:04] Calvary. For she is not under man-made
[1:38:06] teaching. She's not under a man-made
[1:38:08] creed. She is under the headship of the
[1:38:11] word. Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:38:18] Christ. For it is the power of God unto
[1:38:21] salvation to everyone that believeth.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; There's no shame. There's no hesitancy
[1:38:27] about this gospel of Jesus Christ. There
[1:38:29] is a boldness. There is a courage. The
[1:38:31] devil's trying to to to put these
[1:38:33] barriers. He's trying to put these
[1:38:35] limitations there. But it's time for a
[1:38:37] breakthrough. It's time for a people
[1:38:39] that'll say, "I'm not going to be held
[1:38:41] back by any devil trying to keep me from
[1:38:43] the blessings and the effects of the
[1:38:45] word of God. I want every blessing
[1:38:47] pouring out in my life." We need a
[1:38:50] courage. We need a a boldness. We need
[1:38:52] to be unashamed.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Go listen to that sermon the prophet
[1:38:56] preached on ashamed. Oh, you talk about
[1:38:58] some boldness. He had it there. He said
[1:39:01] in that sermon, he says, "I got God."
[1:39:04] There's a people that he says, "They've
[1:39:05] got to where they look like when they
[1:39:07] pray for people, they apologize. Mr.
[1:39:10] Devil, would you please move out and and
[1:39:12] let me nothing." He said, "Faith has got
[1:39:16] muscles and hair on its chest. When it
[1:39:18] speaks, everything else shuts up.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't go in, Mr. Devil. And and
[1:39:23] you move out. It's not how you're
[1:39:25] supposed to talk. You come there with
[1:39:26] some boldness. Get out of here. I'm a
[1:39:29] son of God. commissioned of God. Leave
[1:39:31] them alone. Now that moves.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; You have no apology to the devil.
[1:39:36] Nothing to do with them. Not ashamed of
[1:39:38] the word of God. Not ashamed of your
[1:39:40] commission. Not ashamed of who we are.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, the only thing we have to be ashamed
[1:39:46] of is our humanity. But I'm not ashamed
[1:39:48] of who he said I am. He said you are the
[1:39:51] virgin. He spoken of speaking of my
[1:39:53] life. He spoke of Christ. He said he was
[1:39:55] the virgin born son of the living God.
[1:39:57] But when he spoke of me, he said, "I was
[1:39:59] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ."
[1:40:01] And he said, "You are the pure,
[1:40:02] virtuous, sinless bride of the son of
[1:40:04] the living God." And if he says that
[1:40:06] about me, I'm not ashamed of it. I
[1:40:09] confess it. I say, "I accept my identity
[1:40:12] as the bride of Jesus Christ." If he
[1:40:14] said I'm perfect, then I'm going to
[1:40:15] confess by the blood of Jesus Christ, I
[1:40:18] am perfected.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of of his word. I'm not
[1:40:25] ashamed of the effects of the gospel.
[1:40:27] I'm not ashamed of the effects of the
[1:40:29] Holy Ghost. I'm not ashamed that it
[1:40:31] turns people into holy rollers. In fact,
[1:40:33] I really enjoy being one.
[1:40:37] Oh, he says, "But it seems today that
[1:40:39] that when when people are are going, it
[1:40:42] seems to be a day today when people are
[1:40:44] going beyond the limitations, going
[1:40:46] beyond the barriers." And he he speaks
[1:40:48] in this sermon going beyond the camp. I
[1:40:50] need to bring this down to a landing
[1:40:52] here, but I'm also wanting to take off.
[1:40:54] So,
[1:40:55] He says, "It seems to be this is the
[1:40:57] hour that that people are going beyond
[1:40:59] the barriers, going beyond the
[1:41:00] limitations and and they're breaking
[1:41:02] into to different, you know,
[1:41:04] breakthroughs and you'll have the
[1:41:06] breakthroughs in science and you'll have
[1:41:07] the breakthroughs in research and in
[1:41:08] education and all these different
[1:41:10] things." But then on on the devil's side
[1:41:12] of it, he says, "I see Satan is also
[1:41:14] taking people beyond the camp of
[1:41:16] reason."
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:41:21] and they want to call you a fanatic for
[1:41:22] believing in God.
[1:41:24] It's not reasonable.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; They ain't got no room to talk, friends.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Taking them beyond the camp of reason of
[1:41:33] of of common common sense. Taking the
[1:41:36] people the other way, beyond the camp.
[1:41:39] God taking his people beyond this away.
[1:41:41] And Satan is taking the people beyond
[1:41:43] the camp of common decency.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; You see the this age that we're living
[1:41:48] in, people are going to extremes.
[1:41:51] They're just there's just extremists
[1:41:53] everywhere.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brothers and sisters, I want to
[1:41:58] see some extremists who were extremists
[1:42:01] for the word of Jesus Christ. I want to
[1:42:03] see some people who have gone all the
[1:42:05] way. They've gone beyond the camp of
[1:42:06] man. They've gone beyond the camp of
[1:42:08] human reasoning. They've gone beyond the
[1:42:10] camp of common sense. And if God says
[1:42:12] it, they just simply say, "I believe it.
[1:42:15] If he said it, I confess it. I stand on
[1:42:17] it. I don't care how I feel. I don't
[1:42:19] care how the situation looks. I don't
[1:42:21] care how my body feels. If he said I'm
[1:42:23] healed, then I'm healed. That's the
[1:42:25] final word on the topic. Going beyond
[1:42:27] the camp of reason.
[1:42:31] Now uh to get to the I guess to my final
[1:42:35] point here he says in going beyond the
[1:42:38] camp he says you know I was told some
[1:42:40] time ago that they had a jet plane and
[1:42:43] and they can makes them noises we hear
[1:42:45] around here and that shakes the windows
[1:42:47] and it's when the plane has got to so
[1:42:50] fast that it crosses its own sound
[1:42:52] called the sound barrier and when it
[1:42:54] goes beyond its own sound barrier it's
[1:42:56] almost unlimited to what it'll do and to
[1:43:00] I think in there that we get a lesson
[1:43:03] when we go beyond our own sound barrier
[1:43:06] into the word of God then it's unlimited
[1:43:09] what God can do with a man that's ready
[1:43:11] to go beyond the camp the camp of man
[1:43:14] that is
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; now you know what something kind of
[1:43:18] interesting he was saying though these
[1:43:20] sound bears we hear the the rattling of
[1:43:21] the windows and things did you know they
[1:43:23] outlawed
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; the uh
[1:43:27] commercial jets and all these things
[1:43:29] that that normal people would fly on
[1:43:31] from breaking the sound barrier.
[1:43:33] You know why? They said it disturbed too
[1:43:36] many people.
[1:43:41] And so they made it illegal for the
[1:43:44] common man to get the experience of
[1:43:47] breaking the sound barrier because it
[1:43:49] disturbed too many people.
[1:43:53] And now, brothers and sisters, I think
[1:43:55] it's time that this church goes and
[1:43:57] breaks beyond the sound barrier. They
[1:43:59] need to go beyond. I don't care what
[1:44:00] anybody else said. I don't care what
[1:44:02] anybody else thinks. If my God is
[1:44:04] calling me to come up higher. If we're
[1:44:06] living in the astronaut age, and we are,
[1:44:09] then it's time for takeoff. It's time to
[1:44:11] go past every barrier, every limitation,
[1:44:14] and go into the unlimited powers of
[1:44:16] Almighty God.
[1:44:18] But I want you to notice he says the
[1:44:21] sound barrier of your own sound.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You see, it's the plain's own sound
[1:44:28] that's holding it back.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; It's the own negativity that the devil's
[1:44:33] putting in your mind that's saying, "Oh,
[1:44:35] I can't do it. Oh, I'm not good enough.
[1:44:37] I'm not a part of this." It's that
[1:44:38] unbelief, that sound that's coming from
[1:44:40] your own voice confessing the wrong
[1:44:42] thing that says, "Oh, I can't be healed.
[1:44:44] I've been sick so long." Brothers and
[1:44:46] sisters, it's time to go beyond our own
[1:44:48] sound barrier. And I say, break past the
[1:44:51] reasoning, break past the common sense,
[1:44:53] break past every limitation of our own
[1:44:55] thinking and say, Lord, I believe if you
[1:44:58] said it's for me, that I'm going to
[1:44:59] break past the barriers. I'm going to
[1:45:01] break through and I don't care what
[1:45:03] anybody says. I don't care what anybody
[1:45:05] thinks. I'm ready to break through into
[1:45:08] the powers of almighty God. When you're
[1:45:10] ready to do that, then it's unlimited
[1:45:13] what God can do with that man.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm ready for my God to be
[1:45:19] unlimited. And I'm ready to be walking
[1:45:22] in a dimension of unlimited power in my
[1:45:25] Lord Jesus Christ. It's time to go
[1:45:27] beyond the sound barriers. It's time to
[1:45:29] go beyond the sound barriers of man and
[1:45:31] the sound barrier of your own negativity
[1:45:33] and say, "Lord, I believe. I believe
[1:45:36] your word. I don't care what anybody
[1:45:38] else says. I'm standing on the promise.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, the power. You know, when you break
[1:45:46] that barrier, then it's unlimited.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Once you break that barrier, it's just
[1:45:51] smooth sailing from then on.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for some smooth sailing?
[1:45:56] Are you ready for unlimited power to be
[1:45:59] released in the church of the living
[1:46:00] God? Brothers and sisters, I'm ready.
[1:46:03] I'm ready to go past the sound barrier.
[1:46:05] I'm ready for a breakthrough. I'm ready
[1:46:07] to step into the power of almighty God
[1:46:10] because he promised it.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet this evening.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; This is the astronaut age. This is the
[1:46:19] age of a people that aren't going to
[1:46:20] just be held down by Earth's gravity.
[1:46:23] They aren't going to be held down by
[1:46:24] anything of this earth, but they're
[1:46:26] going to break out of this sphere into a
[1:46:28] dimension that's completely beyond the
[1:46:29] horse and buggy age, completely beyond
[1:46:31] the airplane. We're going to a place
[1:46:34] that's far beyond this dimension because
[1:46:36] there's a power that's resonating in the
[1:46:38] hearts of the bride of Jesus Christ. It
[1:46:40] is the bride's revival. It's the opening
[1:46:43] of the word that's told you who you are.
[1:46:45] And when you catch who that is, when you
[1:46:47] catch what you are, brothers and
[1:46:49] sisters, it's time to go home.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What's that song you came up
[1:46:55] with, Brother Ben?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good, friends.
[1:47:01] We have a glorious gospel of Jesus
[1:47:04] Christ. And I'm so happy I heard a voice
[1:47:06] that said, "Come out of her, my people.
[1:47:09] I'm not in that mess anymore. I have
[1:47:12] resurrected out of that dark
[1:47:13] denominationalism. And I have come into
[1:47:16] the power of the living God. And I'm
[1:47:18] happy to be here." And you know what?
[1:47:20] Right now, I'm in a dimension where I
[1:47:22] have the opportunity to praise my Lord.
[1:47:25] And you know what I'm going to do when I
[1:47:26] get out of this dimension and I go into
[1:47:28] the next one? I'm gonna get there and
[1:47:30] we're gonna gather around the throne.
[1:47:32] You and me, Brother Greg, are going to
[1:47:33] gather around the throne and we're gonna
[1:47:35] worship and we're gonna give praise and
[1:47:38] we're gonna say, "Worthy is the lamb.
[1:47:41] Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[1:47:44] I'm not waiting till I get there to give
[1:47:47] him my praise. I'm not waiting till I
[1:47:49] get there to worship my God. I'm going
[1:47:52] to worship him right now. I'm going to
[1:47:54] give him the praise that he is worthy
[1:47:56] of.
[1:47:58] He is worthy.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's worthy of it, friends. He's
[1:48:08] worthy of our praise. Just worship him
[1:48:11] tonight.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him your praise. Give him your
[1:48:15] worship.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know the song, Worthy is
[1:48:21] the lamb. Worthy is the lamb who was
[1:48:25] slain.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's power in worship, Prince.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; He inhabits the praises of his people.
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Sing a new song.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Little sick song.

[1:51:11] awesome wonder.

[1:51:20] Jesus.
[1:51:22] Jesus made his power
[1:51:26] worth

[1:51:57] King of Kings.
[1:52:00] You are my everything and I will adore
[1:52:06] you.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, let me tell you,
[1:52:12] there's power in praise.
[1:52:15] There was a time when there was some
[1:52:17] believers that got into a really rough
[1:52:18] spot and they were found to be all bound
[1:52:21] down by the things of man. But Paul and
[1:52:23] Silas, they just began to worship and
[1:52:26] they began to give God praise. And in
[1:52:28] their praise, they were suffering. They
[1:52:30] were in pain. But in that worship, in
[1:52:33] that praise, God came down and inhabited
[1:52:35] that praise and he shook the chains off
[1:52:37] of them. And he broke through every
[1:52:39] barrier and set them free.
[1:52:42] Oh brothers and sisters, if you have a
[1:52:44] need tonight, give him praise.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; If you want him to come down and be
[1:52:49] present in your life, in your home, then
[1:52:52] make your home a place of praise and
[1:52:54] worship.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing that song uh in prisoners
[1:52:58] chains.
[1:53:01] I bless your name.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] I bless your name.
[1:53:16] I bless your name.

[1:53:35] truth the way.

[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:50] challenge
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:07] [Applause]
[1:54:11] to see.
[1:54:14] Their chains were loose
[1:54:18] and they were free.
[1:54:22] I bless your name.
[1:54:27] I bless your name.
[1:54:31] I give you all.
[1:54:35] I give you praise.

[1:54:44] truth of
[1:54:47] God bless your name.
[1:54:52] I bless your son.
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:55:00] If you should find
[1:55:05] the praise
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:11] [Applause]
[1:55:12] we shall praise
[1:55:18] your
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:22] will
[1:55:25] in Jesus nameless.
[1:55:30] Bless your name.
[1:55:33] I bless your name.
[1:55:37] I give you all.
[1:55:41] I give you praise.
[1:55:46] You are
[1:55:50] the true.
[1:55:54] God bless your name.
[1:55:58] God bless.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads tonight.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you, Lord.
[1:56:09] Lord, and we just are so humbled to be
[1:56:12] in your presence here tonight.
[1:56:16] Lord, the the King of glory came down to
[1:56:20] be with his children here tonight,
[1:56:22] Father. And we're just so humbled that
[1:56:24] you would do that, Father. And we're so
[1:56:27] thankful, Lord. And and we just want to
[1:56:29] recognize your presence here among us,
[1:56:31] Lord. Lord, and we just ask for this
[1:56:34] people here tonight, Lord. Lord, if the
[1:56:36] enemy's tried to put some kind of a
[1:56:38] weight or a burden on them, Lord, may
[1:56:40] they just lay aside every weight and the
[1:56:43] sin that would so easily beset them,
[1:56:45] Lord. Let them just shake it off and let
[1:56:47] them break through into the glories of
[1:56:49] God. Lord, let them break past the
[1:56:51] barriers of man-made thinking, the
[1:56:53] barriers of man-made denominations, and
[1:56:56] let them step into the glories of this
[1:56:59] bride's revival for this hour. Oh God,
[1:57:02] may you just reveal it to them. May they
[1:57:05] read their identity, Lord. Lord, I pray
[1:57:07] that you would make it personal to them,
[1:57:10] a personal revelation of their part of
[1:57:12] this hour that we're living in, Lord.
[1:57:15] Lord, as your your when you were here,
[1:57:17] you opened the book and you read it and
[1:57:20] and you said, "It's it's me."
[1:57:23] Lord God, the the anointing that came
[1:57:26] upon you was the greatest anointing ever
[1:57:28] when you found your identity of the
[1:57:30] prophecy in the book. And I pray that
[1:57:32] this church here would read their
[1:57:35] identity of prophecy in the book and
[1:57:37] your anointing would come upon them to
[1:57:39] give them a strength and a courage for
[1:57:40] this hour that we're living in. Lord,
[1:57:43] may they not be ashamed, Lord. May they
[1:57:45] be a courageous church to stand for this
[1:57:47] message of the hour to stand for every
[1:57:49] benefit and every blessing that you paid
[1:57:52] for, Lord. Lord, we don't want the devil
[1:57:54] to take one thing from us, but we want
[1:57:56] every bit blessing and benefit that you
[1:57:58] paid for. Lord, I'm asking that this
[1:58:01] church would be a Holy Ghost fililled
[1:58:02] church, Lord. It would just be
[1:58:04] overflowing, Lord. that this sick and
[1:58:06] dying and hungry world would know that
[1:58:08] there's a fountain of God that's been
[1:58:10] opened in this place where the Holy
[1:58:12] Ghost is being poured out and where
[1:58:14] lives can be changed. Father, I pray
[1:58:16] that you would make this a soul-saving
[1:58:18] station. Lord God, I pray that you would
[1:58:20] make this a place where hungry souls
[1:58:23] would come and would be fed with sheep
[1:58:25] food. Lord, I pray that you would take
[1:58:27] this place where addicts would come.
[1:58:29] Lord, where those that are bound by by
[1:58:31] the things of this world would come and
[1:58:33] be set free by the power of the living
[1:58:35] God. Lord, make this a Holy Ghost church
[1:58:37] where you have freedom and liberty to
[1:58:39] move. Father, we just want you to be
[1:58:42] welcome to move however you want to
[1:58:44] move, Lord, to do whatever you desire to
[1:58:46] do. For we want to give you preeminence,
[1:58:49] Lord, in our hearts and in our lives,
[1:58:52] Lord. May you grant it. May you have
[1:58:54] your way. May there be a complete
[1:58:56] surrender in this place to your word.
[1:58:58] and may your word have preeminence.
[1:59:01] May you grant it, Lord.
[1:59:04] And every spirit of the devil that would
[1:59:06] try to hinder the church of the living
[1:59:08] God, I stand here as an anointed servant
[1:59:11] commissioned by God to cast him out. And
[1:59:14] I declare liberty and freedom in the
[1:59:17] house of the living God.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; We declare it in the name of Jesus
[1:59:22] Christ.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:29] Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] [Music]
[1:59:50] [Music]
[2:00:02] Do you love them?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; The spark of dynamics,
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; is revelation.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; You know what the faith of our fathers
[2:00:18] was?
[2:00:19] The faith of our fathers was they saw
[2:00:22] God in human flesh.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; That was the faith that was to be
[2:00:27] restored back in this day. Here the Lord
[2:00:31] Jesus veiled in a prophet
[2:00:35] was standing on the scene
[2:00:39] performing exactly the same thing
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; that he did. turned his back to the
[2:00:46] audience
[2:00:48] and discerned the thoughts
[2:00:51] and intents of the heart.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; To a gentile revelation.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Who do men say that I
[2:01:13] am?
[2:01:15] And he says, "Some say you're Elijah.
[2:01:18] Some say you're this. Some say you're
[2:01:20] that. But who do you say I am?" He says,
[2:01:22] "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[2:01:25] living God."
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Flesh and blood hath not
[2:01:29] revealed this to you, but my father
[2:01:32] which is in heaven has revealed this to
[2:01:35] you."
[2:01:36] It's revelation, church.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; The church is built on revelation.
[2:01:44] And God didn't call a church. He called
[2:01:47] individuals.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; No wonder he said, "Pray for revelation.
[2:01:55] Pray that your eyes
[2:01:57] will be opened.
[2:02:00] Pray for eyes
[2:02:02] that thou mayest see.
[2:02:05] Take light rainmen
[2:02:08] that the shame of thy nakedness does not
[2:02:10] appear. Buy of me gold
[2:02:15] tried in fire. You don't want something
[2:02:18] that
[2:02:20] just
[2:02:22] works in this atmosphere
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; because you know the the power is in the
[2:02:30] battle.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; That's where the power is.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; The victory comes from war.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:39] you know, the ability to overcome by the
[2:02:43] word of God. That's what that's what you
[2:02:46] want.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; You know, in here it's beautiful, isn't
[2:02:49] it?
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; The atmosphere here is wonderful.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Everything faith is strong.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; And he's the same.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; But you want to be able to take this
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; out there. And when you meet that devil,
[2:03:03] I've seen a lot of people dance in the
[2:03:05] spirit.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; But when that demon's on the floor,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; and you see it, Leslie and I've watched
[2:03:13] it.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; And that it just snakes around.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; That's when
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; you want to know he's the same
[2:03:25] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:30] Revel
[2:03:31] music's great.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; It makes you leave, but revelation
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; is eternal.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; It's eternal.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And when you know when when Peter
[2:03:43] finally went there, he said, "Silver and
[2:03:46] gold have I none, but that which I have,
[2:03:48] I have a divine revelation that God
[2:03:52] spoke to me."
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; And and young people, that's what we're
[2:03:57] trying to preach to. If you will seek
[2:03:59] it,
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; he will reveal to you
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; that you are his child.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Do you say does my record
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; come on
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; speak against me? No. The blood throws
[2:04:13] that record in the sea of God's
[2:04:16] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; There's only one place that God meets
[2:04:25] anybody. It's under the shed blood.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Your power is in the word.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Spirit is Jesus Christ,
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; the word.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; It's his promise to you.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's his promise
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; is God's personal
[2:04:53] promise to you. And by these great and
[2:04:57] exceedingly great and precious promises,
[2:05:00] we are partakers of divine nature by
[2:05:04] promise.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; And when God reveals to you that promise
[2:05:10] is for you,
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; you can walk out of here say, "I'm going
[2:05:13] to have my fellowship with my son
[2:05:15] restored. It's thus saith the Lord."
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Because it is thus sayaith the Lord.
[2:05:23] Oh church,
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; faith final resting place
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; is the word of God.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he came down and he
[2:05:37] put his foot on the land in the sea?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Opened the book.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; I remember when that was first revealed
[2:05:46] to me.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, renew it, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I I was so excited. I thought everybody
[2:05:52] would love it.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; We went out and preached the mighty
[2:05:56] angels put his foot on the land and the
[2:05:58] sea, the books open.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[2:06:06] I like what you said about the sonic
[2:06:08] boom. Most of you probably have never
[2:06:10] experienced sonic booms, but I live by
[2:06:13] myar Naval Air Station
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; before they outlawed it. And those jets
[2:06:19] would come by and they go boom.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And then they go boom,
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; boom. I mean, it was it was exciting.
[2:06:28] And you'd hear the boom and you'd look
[2:06:30] and it was so far gone.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can't live in the boom. You've
[2:06:36] got to live in the plane.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; You can't live in the the results of the
[2:06:41] word. You've got to live in the word
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; because these signs follow them that are
[2:06:46] in the word.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; That's where we're living.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; We're not chasing booms.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; We're not listening for booms.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; We're driven by the dynamics
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; of divine revelation.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to be healed." God's a
[2:07:06] healer. He's all healed. You know what
[2:07:09] heals you is the revelation.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; When God shows you personally that it's
[2:07:17] your time, it's your hour. You'll beat
[2:07:21] yourself to death
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; trying to grab a hold of him,
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; You'll wear yourself out.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; But if you'll just stop
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, reveal to me.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Open my eyes. This is mine. And then
[2:07:39] when you got revelation, don't say,
[2:07:40] "Step back. Say, yes, sir.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Here I come.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; God said so."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; I've got thus sayaith the Lord.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; I ain't You not got nothing on me.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Because he spoke.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; I have heard,
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; but now I see.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I know he had it.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And I know he had it. I know she had it.
[2:08:11] But now I got it.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I I want to I like to
[2:08:17] see a man that's been in battle.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Not talk about battle.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; But he's faced Satan face to face.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; And he knows what it's like.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; He knows what it's like to be down. He
[2:08:30] knows what it's like to have somebody so
[2:08:32] brokenhearted that they can't see
[2:08:34] straight and have the love of God
[2:08:36] burning in their heart to raise them
[2:08:39] back up again. That's the God I serve.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; I serve a God in power. Yes, sir.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; I serve a God in reality. I serve a God
[2:08:49] that meets Satan. It just don't talk
[2:08:52] about God, but it's willing to meet
[2:08:54] Satan in the battle.
[2:08:59] Hallelujah.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's exciting.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I've heard testimonies of people that
[2:09:07] have just thrilled my soul.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; But it's not until you can take that
[2:09:14] testimony
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; and anchor it to a word,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; right,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; that it becomes your possession.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Back to the promise. What was our
[2:09:24] promise?
[2:09:28] What was our promise?
[2:09:31] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:09:34] angel,
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; the mysteries of God should be revealed.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; As it was in the days of Noah,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; so shall it be in the day of the son of
[2:09:47] man.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's our gospel.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:57] That's what makes us what we are.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; We're the elect
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; by divine revelation
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; who has seen the pillar of fire.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Not only just saw the man but saw the
[2:10:13] son of man, Jesus Christ revealed in
[2:10:16] flesh. God in flesh.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; That was the faith
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; of the fathers.
[2:10:26] The works was the result of the
[2:10:28] revelation.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Faith
[2:10:34] is work expressed.
[2:10:36] Don't sell yourself short, church.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; What God has revealed to you is what
[2:10:41] makes you who you are.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; I think it was Big John Beal. I call you
[2:10:46] big John Beal because you're kind of big
[2:10:48] for John.
[2:10:50] He was listening to I don't know if it
[2:10:53] was TWW Armstrong or or some other
[2:10:57] ministry that he followed and the guy
[2:10:59] mentioned brother Brandham's name.
[2:11:02] [Music]
[2:11:04] John said William Brham.
[2:11:07] He began to look at it, listen to it.
[2:11:12] His eyes come open.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; He knew that was a prophet.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:18] John, you could hang on to that
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; no matter what the battle is by divine
[2:11:24] revelation. Flesh and blood did not
[2:11:26] reveal that to you, my brother, but the
[2:11:29] father which is in heaven revealed that
[2:11:31] to you. Can you can stand on that as
[2:11:34] your faith. No matter what trials you
[2:11:36] have, no matter what battles you have,
[2:11:38] you're his. He chose you. He gave you
[2:11:41] Isab that you might see. Amen.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Each of you
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; have given you Isaac.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Now, why can't you if you've seen that,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; then doesn't that make everything else
[2:11:55] he said to you true?
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Doesn't if you've seen that promise,
[2:12:01] what he would do in that day, doesn't
[2:12:03] that make every other promise he's ever
[2:12:06] spoke to you true?
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. And by your revelation,
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; you are entitled
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; to take that word.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; And open every day.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; We just keep beating ourselves down
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; with our faults.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; When he who is in you is greater than
[2:12:26] your faults.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Use your revelation, church.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Use your
[2:12:34] revelation.
[2:12:36] It's God's gift to you.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Revelation is God's gift to you.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; It is the spark of all the dynamic
[2:12:49] power. God does nothing unless he first
[2:12:53] reveals it
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; to his servant, the prophet. And once he
[2:12:58] reveals it to a servant's prophet, it's
[2:13:00] revealed to you. And then you possess
[2:13:04] the same power of the revelation. Oh my
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; glory.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Claim it.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; You want more of God? Claim it.
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; You got You've got God give you the gift
[2:13:21] of revelation.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Don't ask me why,
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; but he did it.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know why, but he did.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to deny
[2:13:38] that he gave me ice after
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; that I saw.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't have done it.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Just ask your heart
[2:13:49] for revelation.
[2:13:54] The church is built
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; on revelation.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just
[2:14:08] give me another
[2:14:11] worship a moment. You want really want
[2:14:13] to worship him? Worship him for where he
[2:14:15] is.
[2:14:18] Worship him for where he is right here
[2:14:21] tonight.
[2:14:24] The son of man
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; has been revealed.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; The mysteries have been open.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 has come
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; to call the bride out.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; That's what I worship you, Lord. I'll
[2:14:39] worship you in the word of God that
[2:14:41] you're in.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Help me sing. How great
[2:14:49] is our God?
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; You believe it to say, "Lord, I believe
[2:14:53] you sent a prophet.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe you opened the seals.
[2:15:00] I believe you named the messenger and
[2:15:02] the church ages.
[2:15:04] I believe in water baptism in the name
[2:15:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe
[2:15:09] Lord, you reveal that to me. I worship
[2:15:13] you.
[2:15:17] How great
[2:15:20] is our God?
[2:15:23] Sing with me. How great.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's individual church. He's our
[2:15:29] God.

[2:15:36] how great
[2:15:39] is our God.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:15:48] And the
[2:15:52] king.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? and
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; you're entitled to every promise in
[2:16:00] God's word if you're a believer
[2:16:06] [Music]
[2:16:19] when darkness
[2:16:25] He trembles at his voice.
[2:16:29] Treles at his.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it. Don't you love it?
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; How great
[2:16:37] is our God.
[2:16:41] Sing
[2:16:42] how great.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:45] He's our God.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:16:50] How great,
[2:16:53] oh how great
[2:16:56] is our God
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:05] and
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm a believer
[2:17:13] and
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; you let me see you, Father, in all your
[2:17:16] splendor.
[2:17:18] You wouldn't have done that if I wasn't
[2:17:20] yours.
[2:17:22] [Music]
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to go forward with you.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't call me to lose me, Lord.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; You didn't call me to let me go off in
[2:17:43] the air.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, you called me to make a stand.
[2:17:47] Heavenly Father,
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; How great
[2:17:54] is our God.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Sing with me. How great
[2:18:02] is my God?
[2:18:05] Promise me. How great,
[2:18:10] how great
[2:18:13] is our God.
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:21] Praise the name of God.
[2:18:29] You are worthy of all praise and my
[2:18:37] heart.
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:40] How great
[2:18:43] is our God is our
[2:18:47] [Music]
[2:18:51] praise the name of
[2:18:54] [Music]
[2:18:56] for you are worthy. We are worthy of all
[2:19:04] the holy
[2:19:08] mercy.
[2:19:10] How great
[2:19:13] is our God
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:20] and how great
[2:19:24] is our God
[2:19:28] [Music]
[2:19:32] is our God
[2:19:35] and don't see our brave.
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:48] That's the God
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; that goes with you
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; when you walk out these doors. That's
[2:19:55] the God
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; that goes with you.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:02] That's the one
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; that'll never leave you
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; nor forsake you.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; That's the one that promised you nothing
[2:20:13] could pluck you out
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; of the promised hand.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; That's the one that promised you if I
[2:20:19] started a work in you,
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; I'll finish.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care if Satan tells you it won't
[2:20:26] get done.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; It'll get done. Come on.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; If he started it,
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; it'll get done. Yes.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; If he gave you a revelation, if he
[2:20:34] called your heart to repentance and you
[2:20:36] give your life to him, I don't care
[2:20:39] where you go,
[2:20:43] the seeking shepherd
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; will find you.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; And he'll bring you back.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; I hate to admit it. He's brought me back
[2:20:54] many times.
[2:20:57] But I can promise you, he said,
[2:21:02] if I started it,
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; I'll finish it.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want him to be a god of a
[2:21:09] church.
[2:21:11] I don't really care much about whether
[2:21:13] this church
[2:21:15] has the Holy Ghost. I want you
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; to have the Holy Ghost. I don't care
[2:21:21] much about what this church does, but I
[2:21:23] care about what you do out in the world
[2:21:26] where you're a shining light.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; I want you as an individual to have the
[2:21:32] power of the resurrection. I want you as
[2:21:35] an individual to open this book, take a
[2:21:38] promise, say, "That's my promise." Now,
[2:21:41] Satan, I'm going to meet you,
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take the sword of this word
[2:21:46] and meet you face to face.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't call a church. He called a
[2:21:52] body.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Born again
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; individuals
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; with the power to meet Satan.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; I always wondered until tonight, I
[2:22:05] always wanted a deeper revelation of why
[2:22:08] the prophet of God said you could have
[2:22:10] the Holy Ghost
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; without sensation.
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:16] And now I understand it more than ever
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; because it's by divine
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Oh church.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, what we ought to praise him for.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; For opening our eyes,
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad you saw the message,
[2:22:34] brother Tommy?
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Me and Tommy have a little story.
[2:22:41] I drove up on the curb one day and
[2:22:44] trying to get the mail and Tommy said
[2:22:47] something to you about what are you
[2:22:48] going to do? Take out the mailbox. I
[2:22:50] just looked around and said, "What are
[2:22:51] you a critic?"
[2:22:53] And we laugh about that, you know. But
[2:22:56] I'll tell you one thing. I sat over a
[2:22:58] pickup truck and Tommy had about five,
[2:23:00] six pack of empty beer cans in the back
[2:23:03] of his truck with a cigarette pack
[2:23:06] rolled up in them.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; He's lost his deuce.
[2:23:10] But you won't meet nobody no more
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; that hadn't been born again,
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; been filled with the spirit of God and
[2:23:17] has passed from death unto life.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; He may not dance or shout or sing or go
[2:23:25] about, but I know there's a fire
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; in his heart for the kingdom of God. And
[2:23:31] when he lays his hands on me to be
[2:23:33] prayed for,
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; I get better.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:38] That's the church.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; That we want.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's the church we want that's
[2:23:43] motivated by love, by experience,
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; cuz they've tasted the love of God.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; John, it don't care how many problems
[2:23:51] you have, brother. The family, it don't
[2:23:53] matter.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; He's got you in the palm of his hand.
[2:23:56] And nothing can pluck you out.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; And no matter what happens in this life,
[2:24:00] he said that whoever you loved and
[2:24:03] whoever loved you will be there.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; And you can rest in that. You can turn
[2:24:08] it into his hands and say, "Father,
[2:24:10] you've got it all.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you battle, church.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; He has not left you,
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; nor forsake you, nor will he ever leave
[2:24:21] you or forsake you because he promised
[2:24:26] he wouldn't." Let's pray. Our heavenly
[2:24:30] father,
[2:24:33] you gave us your word,
[2:24:37] before there ever was a star,
[2:24:41] before there ever was a moon,
[2:24:44] you slipped the wedding band of
[2:24:46] predestination on our hand there.
[2:24:50] And you put us in your thoughts.
[2:24:54] And you said, "If we weren't in the
[2:24:55] thoughts of God in the beginning, we
[2:24:57] won't be there.
[2:24:59] And you wrote our names on a book
[2:25:03] and you said nothing could put it on and
[2:25:06] nothing could take it off.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Father, if you would open our eyes to
[2:25:12] that
[2:25:14] where each heart and here could say,
[2:25:16] "Lord, I'm yours
[2:25:20] because I was with you in the
[2:25:21] beginning."
[2:25:23] And as you read through the pages of the
[2:25:26] message, our messenger keeps telling us
[2:25:29] that over and over and over again.
[2:25:34] You were with them in the beginning.
[2:25:40] You're him
[2:25:43] here now.
[2:25:47] And he sent a messenger to give us Isa
[2:25:51] that we might see. Our brother prayed
[2:25:54] tonight and preached tonight, Father,
[2:25:56] that we might see who we are.
[2:26:00] That we might be overcomers,
[2:26:03] that we might face Satan face to face
[2:26:07] and say, "You are a liar
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; and there's no truth in you.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; You're the father of lies.
[2:26:17] And I believe what he said.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; And he said, "My name was on a book."
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Do you feel it? No.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Yes.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:26:35] Cuz he
[2:26:37] said so.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; And that settles it.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Father, may we keep it simple.
[2:26:44] May we keep it real.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Make your church live by your word,
[2:26:49] Father. It's our promise.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; We ask it mightily in Jesus wonderful
[2:26:58] and precious name. Amen.
[2:27:02] Isn't there a song goes I am?
[2:27:31] That's the song I always sing. I know I
[2:27:35] we sing it all the time when we close.
[2:27:40] Joy, what?
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; No. Uh, God is good
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; God is good all the time.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; Now, why would I forget that?
[2:27:51] I I experience that every day. God's so
[2:27:55] good to me, church, I can't stand it.
[2:27:59] Amen. Is he good to you?
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; He's good. You heard word tonight.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Take that word with you.
[2:28:07] Live it.
[2:28:08] Tell that devil. Possess the gates of
[2:28:11] the enemy. Drive them out. Glide the
[2:28:13] token.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Watch the power of God move you. Give
[2:28:17] you the desire of your heart. That's the
[2:28:19] word of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:28:26] if you're walking,
[2:28:29] God bless you. Are just
[2:28:33] there shadows
[2:28:35] all around.
[2:28:39] Oh, do not fear.
[2:28:43] He will guide you.
[2:28:46] He will keep you safe and sound.
[2:28:52] Oh, cuz he's promised
[2:28:55] to never leave you
[2:28:59] nor forsake you.
[2:29:02] And his word is true. God is good and he
[2:29:08] is all the time.
[2:29:12] He us
[2:29:19] God is good.
[2:29:21] Oh all the time
[2:29:25] and through the darkness
[2:29:30] will shine. God is good.
[2:29:35] God is good
[2:29:37] all the time.
[2:29:41] Oh, we were sing
[2:29:44] so hard. Amen.
[2:29:48] So for us, he chose to die.
[2:29:53] Lift us with
[2:29:57] his Holy Spirit.
[2:30:00] How we can sing and tell you
[2:30:06] that is love in the truth is
[2:30:13] that his mercy is never.
[2:30:18] [Music]
[2:30:22] Oh, all the time
[2:30:25] he put a song of praise in this part of
[2:30:30] God. God is good
[2:30:34] all the time.
[2:30:37] And through the darkest night, a light
[2:30:42] will shine. God is good.
[2:30:46] Oh, God is good
[2:30:50] all the time.
[2:30:52] all the time. God bless you.
