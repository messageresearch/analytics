[4:32] good evening
[4:34] let's bow in prayer
[4:38] oh lord jesus how
[4:41] faithful and true lord thou art
[4:45] father to be
[4:47] mindful of us lord
[4:50] father just to think of the cross lord
[4:53] in
[4:55] making it
[4:56] personal i
[4:59] know i'm
[5:01] not alone when i think oh god
[5:04] how
[5:05] could you do that for someone like me
[5:07] lord
[5:10] mother
[5:12] let it
[5:13] sink in so
[5:15] deep lord into the heart father that
[5:21] lord that the appreciation and the
[5:25] respect that we
[5:27] should have for your choice in choosing
[5:30] us father that it would produce fruit
[5:32] father a real
[5:33] nature and an
[5:35] atmosphere and a character father that
[5:37] would draw the attention of
[5:40] your lost ones and
[5:42] father they would make an impression
[5:44] father on the world as you would see fit
[5:47] father the world that you've placed each
[5:49] one of us in father to
[5:52] reflect your light father that you might
[5:54] be
[5:55] lifted up father that your glory might
[5:57] be made known lord and
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] even the glory father that we had with
[6:03] you before the world was that father
[6:05] that we would come into that lord and
[6:09] father we thank you for the word that
[6:10] you
[6:11] spoke to us this morning father and your
[6:15] love father to
[6:17] remind us of the warnings father that we
[6:20] see all around us and
[6:23] to recognize how late the hour is and to
[6:27] to take inventory lord of the things
[6:30] that we're
[6:31] putting our time and attention and
[6:33] effort sent to father and to hone
[6:35] ourselves down father and be
[6:37] single-minded that our whole body be
[6:40] full of light lord we're not looking to
[6:43] do these things within ourselves father
[6:47] though we know it's written that the
[6:49] bride has made herself ready father but
[6:51] it's by you father that we do these
[6:54] things by your spirit father not by our
[6:57] own
[6:59] human efforts father and so we're here
[7:00] tonight father we're gathered together
[7:03] lord according
[7:04] father to
[7:06] the certain sound that we've heard
[7:08] father we believe that you brought us to
[7:10] this place tonight father you have
[7:12] something for us
[7:14] father we counted a privilege to take
[7:16] part in foot washing and communion
[7:18] father we know it's written that would
[7:20] be happy so we just want to commit the
[7:23] service to you tonight lord help us
[7:25] father in our feeble attempts to worship
[7:27] you or to praise you for all that you
[7:30] are all that you've
[7:32] done for us to bring us this far and all
[7:34] that you promised to do and to the end
[7:36] father and so we commit all things unto
[7:39] you father even the man of god that
[7:41] would speak the word tonight in the name
[7:43] of the lord jesus christ we pray amen

[18:53] lord knowing that the price has been
[18:56] paid and we claim their healing in jesus

[19:25] we know we can come boldly before your
[19:27] throne and ask that you touch his heart
[19:29] once again lord for a physical healing
[19:34] though we committed into your hands
[19:37] trusting in you lord that you'd be with
[19:39] him from the beginning to the end
[19:43] lord the many other needs that are on
[19:44] the hearts of your people lord this

[30:55] praise god
[31:03] [Music]
[31:07] god
[31:08] [Music]
[31:30] tonight before communion um it might be
[31:32] a lot of scripture
[31:34] um
[31:36] just see how much
[31:39] we might be able to get through but
[31:41] um
[31:42] we're not gonna
[31:44] minister necessarily but we just wanted
[31:46] to maybe be able to place a communion
[31:49] in the bible
[31:50] and
[31:52] not not even
[32:17] lord for your grace and your mercy lord
[32:19] as we would just read in your scriptures
[32:21] tonight before communion or we pray it
[32:24] would be a blessing lord just that your
[32:25] word would become more real to us
[32:28] lord that we would come into a deeper
[32:30] communion
[32:31] a deeper revelation a deeper
[32:33] understanding of these things lord
[32:35] many times we take it for granted
[32:38] lord it becomes
[32:40] maybe more of a routine
[32:43] but lord we want it to be a personal
[32:45] relationship with you lord so we just
[32:48] ask that you would come father and
[32:50] just make this more personal to us we
[32:53] pray we love you we ask this in the name
[32:54] of the lord jesus christ
[32:56] amen
[32:59] so just reading in john chapter 13 which
[33:02] is um we're all familiar which starts
[33:06] uh our reading that we would normally
[33:08] read for
[33:11] communion and
[33:12] foot washing so it says in verse one now
[33:15] before the feast of the passover when
[33:17] jesus knew that his hour was come that
[33:19] he should depart
[33:20] out of this world and to the father
[33:22] having loved his own which were in the
[33:24] world he loved them unto the end amen
[33:27] you may have your seats
[33:32] and so i just thought
[33:35] by the way it's good to be back with you
[33:38] amen god was gracious on the trip me and
[33:40] brother cosman had to romania to be with
[33:42] the young people there
[33:44] um i had some just powerful meetings of
[33:46] the holy ghost lives transformed and
[33:48] changed
[33:50] um there was one moment uh that was
[33:52] really moving to me as we we sat back in
[33:54] our chair after we had uh just been
[33:56] praying with the youth and and and
[33:58] calling out to god we just could see the
[34:00] the tears and and the wet spots along
[34:03] the altar from from where people had
[34:05] been giving their heart to god and that
[34:07] that's just an image that's ingrained in
[34:08] my mind now
[34:10] and so we couldn't have gone without you
[34:12] uh we are sent by the church and so we
[34:14] just we thank you brother gabriel brings
[34:16] greetings uh to to each of you and we're
[34:20] just thankful to be back here amen
[34:23] so here just in john
[34:25] chapter 13 it says
[34:27] uh we just read it now before the feast
[34:29] of the passover when jesus knew that his
[34:31] hour was come that he should depart out
[34:33] of this world unto the father having
[34:35] loved his own which were in the world he
[34:37] loved them unto the end and supper being
[34:39] ended the devil having now put it into
[34:41] the heart of judas iscariot simon's son
[34:44] to betray him so notice here in john
[34:46] he's making the distinction he's saying
[34:47] now supper has ended so they've come to
[34:50] the upper room and now the supper is
[34:52] over and so now john's going to start to
[34:54] to show uh what takes place after the
[34:57] supper has ended and and and just to
[35:00] maybe if this is for a hell a help i i
[35:03] hope it's not too academic for you i'm
[35:05] not much of a
[35:06] of a teacher i would say but if if we
[35:09] can just read the bible and maybe have a
[35:11] better understanding of being able to
[35:13] place the scriptures i believe it'll be
[35:14] a blessing to us so if you just look
[35:18] into the scripture here and just uh as
[35:20] you do a little brief study and you look
[35:21] into the message uh the day that they
[35:24] are having communion who knows what day
[35:26] it is what day of the week are they in
[35:28] the upper room it's thursday
[35:31] so they're in the upper room and the day
[35:33] is thursday because tomorrow is going to
[35:35] be friday which is the day our lord is
[35:38] going to be crucified
[35:40] and so as you just start to place this
[35:42] in scripture you can even start to uh
[35:44] follow the dates and the times and
[35:46] and if you you do a little study on it
[35:48] it's more than likely the dates april 6
[35:52] 80 30. here it's thursday during the
[35:55] week and uh palm sunday has just
[35:58] happened which um it was april 2nd 80 30
[36:02] and if if if you want to be skeptical uh
[36:05] about the dates brother branham says in
[36:07] the 70th week of daniel now jesus the
[36:09] messiah rode into the city of jerusalem
[36:11] triumph on the back of white
[36:13] mule on palm sunday april 2nd 80 30.
[36:19] i'll take it
[36:21] i did an extensive study
[36:23] and many theologians have a lot of
[36:25] different dates and as i had some
[36:27] fellowship with some brothers i said
[36:28] i'll go with the vindicated prophet
[36:31] and and sure brother branham was a
[36:33] student of the word he he very well
[36:35] would have been a student and got the
[36:37] date maybe read something else of a
[36:39] historian
[36:41] and and gave the date and and i just
[36:43] thought if i was the historian i would
[36:45] be fascinated that a vindicated prophet
[36:47] vindicated my estimation of the date
[36:51] you know some some people get so bent
[36:53] out of shape that that that brother
[36:55] branham used dates and and used other
[36:57] studies from other men and they try to
[37:00] use that to to disqualify brother
[37:02] brenham's efforts but to me that was the
[37:05] greatest vindication that those
[37:06] theologians could have ever had is for a
[37:08] vindicated prophet to pick it up and say
[37:10] you know what that looks right
[37:13] i'll use that and to have the liberty to
[37:15] take that because you know it was the
[37:17] age of man if you look into the age of
[37:19] man
[37:20] under that man anointing
[37:22] um god did mighty things
[37:25] in the church and and and so many things
[37:27] were translated and and into so many
[37:29] languages and and while we have even the
[37:32] word and that we have today in the
[37:34] written bible is under that age of man
[37:36] of everything being uh transcribed and
[37:39] and just so just kind of trying to set a
[37:41] just a little uh
[37:43] uh
[37:44] just to give you the visual of what's
[37:46] taking place here because um john's
[37:48] account starts when supper has ended
[37:51] and but you realize when you read this
[37:53] you start into john it says and supper
[37:55] being ended well but there was a lot
[37:57] that actually happened
[37:59] during the supper
[38:01] and if you don't comb through the
[38:02] scriptures and you don't go back and
[38:04] really and then we we just read we we
[38:06] read john 13 as a congregation every
[38:09] month that we do communion and supper
[38:11] being ended and if we're not careful we
[38:13] really lose the gravity
[38:16] and how monumentous this actually is
[38:19] that now jesus has come to this place uh
[38:22] to to do uh to to have the last supper
[38:26] and
[38:26] to wash the disciples feet we we really
[38:29] if we're not careful we just allow it to
[38:31] become a ritual we allow it to become
[38:33] education and it really loses its value
[38:36] and its meaning and it's just oh it's
[38:38] just it's just communion it's just john
[38:40] 13. but there's such a richness and a
[38:43] depth to the word of god that i believe
[38:45] if we can be students of the word and we
[38:46] can and we can pour ourselves into it
[38:49] that we can really uh uh uh
[38:52] get a whole lot more out of it
[38:54] i hope maybe i'm the one that's lagging
[38:57] behind
[38:58] we all pray for me i i i enjoy getting
[39:01] in the word of god and studying the word
[39:03] of god and being a a workman
[39:06] that needeth not be to
[39:08] be a ashamed you know it doesn't say to
[39:11] study to show yourself a workman that
[39:13] you're you're not ashamed right that
[39:14] means you can be ashamed
[39:19] i've been ashamed many times
[39:22] now we we we
[39:24] we should fall in love with this message
[39:27] really fall in love with the bible
[39:29] uh let it be a new book to you but i
[39:32] just want to maybe uh jump into some of
[39:34] the other gospels and and also use john
[39:37] and i try not to be lengthy
[39:40] um that was the idea in reading a few
[39:42] scriptures before communion but as you
[39:43] start to comb through it and you go
[39:45] through it all saying like well my you
[39:46] can hardly get through this much and
[39:48] that much and then you realize you you
[39:50] bit off more than you can chew but i
[39:52] would think that if we could just read
[39:54] our bibles tonight before communion i
[39:56] believe we'll be blessed
[39:58] amen so just to set the stage we
[40:01] mentioned palm sunday so if you can even
[40:03] in your minds just start to understand
[40:05] where we're at in jesus ministry he's
[40:08] coming now to where he's having the last
[40:11] supper and it's on thursday
[40:13] and and after this last supper he's
[40:15] going to be betrayed in the garden and
[40:16] he's going to be crucified just hours
[40:18] later and so when you look into the
[40:20] scripture though if you jump back into
[40:22] john chapter 12 you just find that he
[40:25] came riding into jerusalem
[40:27] which was palm sunday fulfilling
[40:29] prophecy of zachariah behold he cometh
[40:32] meek and lowly riding upon an ass and
[40:34] here they're all saying hosanna hosanna
[40:36] hosanna and so palm sun that's on so
[40:39] it's called palm sunday because that
[40:41] happened on sunday and what we're
[40:43] talking about in scripture about the
[40:45] upper room having communion and foot
[40:47] washing is the thursday following palm
[40:49] sunday
[40:51] okay so if we if you can kind of just
[40:54] get that in your mind and so if you look
[40:56] into the scripture here in john chapter
[40:58] 12 and i just grab your bibles we'll try
[41:01] to get it up on the screens like i said
[41:03] we just do a bunch of reading if if
[41:06] that's okay i hope it's not too awkward
[41:08] for you uh but i think it would be a
[41:11] blessing
[41:12] but if you look into your bibles
[41:14] um in in john chapter 12
[41:17] uh it says in verse one it says in jesus
[41:19] six days before the passover came to
[41:21] bethany where lazarus which had been
[41:23] raised from the dead and he
[41:25] whom he had raised from the dead there
[41:27] they made a supper and martha served but
[41:30] lazarus was one of them that sat at the
[41:31] table with him then mary
[41:34] then took mary a pound of ointment of
[41:36] spikenard very costly and anointed the
[41:39] feet of jesus and wiped his feet with
[41:41] her hair and the house was filled with
[41:43] the odors of with the odor's appointment
[41:46] now you might uh uh
[41:49] the reason why we're backing up a little
[41:50] bit because john here in verse two he's
[41:53] making a very uh
[41:56] profound statement because he's saying
[41:58] and supper being ended
[41:59] the devil now having put it in the heart
[42:02] of judas iscarion
[42:04] and so you back up into the scriptures
[42:06] about
[42:08] about a a week before
[42:10] um here's mary coming in must must be
[42:13] led by the holy ghost must something
[42:15] moving upon our heart that she would
[42:16] take this ointment and want to break it
[42:20] and start to to to anoint jesus feet and
[42:23] here in verse 4 you find that
[42:26] one of the disciples judas
[42:28] iscariot simon's son which should betray
[42:30] him says why was not this ointment sold
[42:32] for 300 pence and given to the poor
[42:37] he's looking at now mary coming and and
[42:40] offering a praise and a worship and and
[42:43] doing something that was needful
[42:45] doing something she was predestinated to
[42:48] do
[42:50] this this was something that i believe
[42:51] mary was ordained to do that god moved
[42:54] upon her heart i believe there was
[42:56] something in her maybe she even she even
[42:58] looked at it was like
[42:59] oh but but this was so costly maybe i i
[43:02] you know they say the value of that
[43:04] would took several days in one place
[43:06] they'll say it took 300 days to make to
[43:08] make that kind of money i pence a day's
[43:10] wage but but whatever the value was very
[43:13] costly
[43:14] and something moved upon her heart in
[43:16] such a way where she couldn't take it
[43:18] anymore and she just moved in there and
[43:20] she broke that alabaster but she started
[43:22] anoint jesus feet and and wipe wipe his
[43:26] feet with her hair
[43:28] and here's one of the disciples that is
[43:29] questioning
[43:31] her offering
[43:33] questioning why she is doing this
[43:35] questioning the value of why would you
[43:38] do this this could have been sold and
[43:40] notice what jesus would say uh he would
[43:42] say this he said
[43:45] and notice john points out here he says
[43:47] in verse six he says uh he says
[43:49] this he said not because he cared for
[43:51] the poor
[43:53] but because he was a thief
[43:55] and had the bag and bear what was put
[43:58] there in
[43:59] and then jesus said let her alone
[44:01] against the day of my barian hath she
[44:04] kept this
[44:06] so so notice that mary had a purpose in
[44:08] what she was doing but judas was so
[44:10] blinded by greed
[44:12] judas was so blinded that and so void of
[44:16] understanding he couldn't even accept
[44:18] the rebuke
[44:20] that jesus was given to him because
[44:22] jesus was correcting him
[44:24] but but if you jump into matthew i
[44:26] believe this is just like i said we're
[44:27] just going to walk through the scripture
[44:30] so
[44:32] we'll keep walking
[44:34] matthew chapter 26 verse 12.
[44:42] we're going to grab out of matthew how
[44:44] matthew's going to to make a statement
[44:46] about this story
[44:49] so now we're in matthew chapter 26
[44:51] he's given a same account he says for in
[44:53] this she has poured this ointment out of
[44:55] my body she did it for my burial verily
[44:58] i say unto you whosoever this wherever
[45:00] this gospel shall be preached in the
[45:01] whole world there shall also this that
[45:04] this woman hath done be told for a
[45:06] memorial of her oh i just wonder how
[45:09] that just
[45:10] judas just couldn't take it
[45:13] because here he was you know he was the
[45:15] i'm in charge of the money here and she
[45:18] was just very wasteful and then jesus
[45:20] goes on to say leave her alone she's
[45:22] done this for my burial and even more so
[45:26] that this is going to be preached
[45:28] wherever the gospel is preached i i just
[45:31] i just feel like judas couldn't take it
[45:33] he just couldn't stand it because you
[45:35] notice the next account that matthew
[45:37] would give
[45:38] it shows that right after jesus says
[45:40] this it says then one of the twelve
[45:42] called judas iscariot went unto the
[45:43] chief priest and said to them what will
[45:45] you give me
[45:47] and i will deliver him unto you and they
[45:50] covenanted with him for 30 pieces of
[45:52] silver and from that time he sought
[45:54] opportunity to betray him so you see how
[45:57] just coming down in the last week of
[45:58] jesus earthly ministry here how how he's
[46:01] his feet are being anointed it's about
[46:03] to be palm sunday he's he's moving
[46:05] towards the upper room and foot washing
[46:07] and now it's been put in the heart of
[46:08] judas iscariot to betray him you could
[46:10] just imagine that the gravity of this
[46:12] moment and the atmosphere and how thick
[46:14] and how everything's coming down and how
[46:16] jesus knows that he's living out his
[46:18] last hours before the crucifixion and
[46:20] just to think here
[46:22] this is prophecy being fulfilled because
[46:24] if you look into psalms 41 9
[46:26] david would prophesy and say yay my own
[46:29] familiar friend and whom i trusted
[46:32] which did eat of my bread hath lifted up
[46:34] his heel against me
[46:37] and even earlier as jesus
[46:40] would there in john chapter six you know
[46:44] as many would start to to leave he would
[46:46] say look i've chosen you twelve but even
[46:47] one of you is a devil
[46:50] and so judas wasn't fooling nobody
[46:53] i j jesus chose him knowing he was a
[46:56] devil
[46:57] but it was that the scripture might be
[46:58] fulfilled
[46:59] and so you could just see the the
[47:01] gravity of everything uh just moving up
[47:04] to this moment and i i i put this into
[47:07] the study here in second thessalonians
[47:09] uh chapter 2 verse 3.
[47:13] i just think this is um
[47:15] just to
[47:16] cast a little light on here
[47:18] he's saying let no man deceive you by
[47:20] any means for that day shall not come
[47:22] except there come a falling away first
[47:25] and that man of sin
[47:27] be revealed the son of perdition and i
[47:29] just want to show that make a note here
[47:32] of how that jesus is now coming to
[47:33] communion with his disciples he's coming
[47:36] there in the evening time and he's about
[47:38] to break bread and he's about to have
[47:39] communion and do foot washing with them
[47:41] and it's in this hour think of this son
[47:43] of man ministry it's in this moment of
[47:46] communion that the son of perdition is
[47:49] revealed
[47:50] and it just reminds me how
[47:52] as we we have received the son of man in
[47:55] our day a son of man revealing the son
[47:57] of man it's in the evening time that
[47:59] that the son of man is revealed but also
[48:01] what else is revealed in the evening
[48:03] time the son of perdition is also
[48:05] revealed
[48:06] and so as we just keep moving on in our
[48:08] study i want to jump into the book of
[48:10] mark mark does a a good job of of just
[48:13] laying the foundation to bring us into
[48:15] the upper room if you turn to mark
[48:17] chapter 14.
[48:20] maybe i don't know if you're able to
[48:21] make notes if this if we're moving quite
[48:23] quickly but we'll
[48:24] uh just continue reading mark chapter 14
[48:27] verse 12.
[48:30] so once again we're just we're just
[48:31] setting the stage for the last week
[48:34] of of
[48:36] jesus earthly ministry there from palm
[48:38] sunday now we've we've come down and
[48:41] he's he's gone to the you know on monday
[48:44] he went to the temple and he he cleansed
[48:46] the temple and then it was probably
[48:48] around tuesday if you follow the
[48:49] scripture that he cursed the fig tree
[48:52] he's going to go into the temple and
[48:53] teach and and give parables and talk
[48:56] about the widow who gave of mites and
[48:58] just many things uh oh my so much
[49:01] transpires uh it's actu actually uh
[49:06] as i started to jump in and study it
[49:08] with some of the brothers and and just
[49:09] look at these things it's to find out
[49:12] how much actually transpired in the last
[49:14] week of jesus earthly ministry is
[49:16] overwhelming
[49:18] of what the disciples heard
[49:21] uh they they they sat there on the mount
[49:23] of olives and heard them preach the
[49:25] seals and they they were in the temple
[49:27] and and all of these things were being
[49:29] said and so much happened to the last
[49:30] week it just makes me you think about
[49:32] the disciples in that last week and then
[49:34] you think about all them saints sitting
[49:36] there and that that week there in
[49:38] jeffersonville in march in 1963 and them
[49:40] seals breaking you know that's when you
[49:43] say praise god for a tape recorder
[49:47] i mean
[49:49] i i believe it well what did he say
[49:52] he said it
[49:54] you can imagine it yeah you so you think
[49:56] of these disciples and
[49:57] and and how much was being said to them
[50:01] and and jesus said tell him look what
[50:02] i'm doing you can't bear it right now
[50:04] you can't bear it right now you get kept
[50:06] letting know but these things had to
[50:07] fulfill because
[50:08] he was he was fulfilling prophecy he was
[50:11] fulfilling scripture but there was
[50:12] coming a day that he'd send the
[50:13] comforter and he'd remind him of all
[50:15] those things and praise god we have that
[50:17] same same promise that we don't have to
[50:19] try to digest the whole i mean that's i
[50:21] think in our in our
[50:24] in our youth in our zeal we make the big
[50:25] mistake of thinking we're going to sit
[50:27] down and digest spoken word as the
[50:28] original seed and just i'm going to come
[50:31] out and do a book report on it it
[50:32] doesn't work like that it's spiritual
[50:34] food and due season it speaks to you
[50:36] when you need it you can never exhaust
[50:38] the word of god
[50:40] you i don't care what it is 47 through
[50:44] 65 it's spiritual food and due season
[50:47] study it out show yourself approved come
[50:49] back to it and let god speak to you
[50:51] again it'll speak to you in a whole new
[50:53] light a whole new meaning a whole
[50:54] different way because it's god's
[50:57] speaking it's it's spiritual food and
[50:59] due season and thank god he gives you
[51:02] the holy ghost
[51:03] that can take that word and feed your
[51:06] soul
[51:08] he'll bring into remembrance those
[51:10] things
[51:11] because if it was left up to this old
[51:13] noodle here we wouldn't have a chance
[51:16] you know just look at those disciples
[51:18] you know could you imagine them trying
[51:19] to run around with a steno pad wait you
[51:22] said what what's the times at the end
[51:24] and you you said wait did you say wait
[51:26] you're going and i can't follow you but
[51:27] you're gonna go away so you can come i'm
[51:29] confused
[51:32] you see everything was happening so mark
[51:34] here
[51:35] just does a beautiful job of leading us
[51:37] up to
[51:38] the upper room it says in the first day
[51:40] of unleavened bread when they killed the
[51:42] passover
[51:43] his disciples said and where wilt thou
[51:45] th
[51:46] that we go and prepare that thou managed
[51:48] to eat the passover
[51:50] and he sendeth forth two of his
[51:51] disciples
[51:53] and saith unto them go into the city
[51:55] and there shall meet you a man bearing a
[51:58] pitcher of water
[51:59] follow him
[52:01] and wheresoever he shall go in
[52:04] say ye to the good man of the house the
[52:06] master saith where is the guest chamber
[52:09] where i shall eat the passover with my
[52:11] disciples and he shall show you a large
[52:15] upper room furnished and prepared there
[52:18] make ready for us note that it mark
[52:21] makes that distinguished uh distinction
[52:23] that it's a large upper room
[52:26] and they made ready the passover and the
[52:28] evening
[52:29] notice this verse 70 and in the evening
[52:32] he cometh with the twelve
[52:35] and the prophet of god would say this in
[52:37] fellowship he'd say and we notice eating
[52:39] is implied in fellowship
[52:41] you want to know why we eat so much
[52:45] there you go
[52:48] eating is implied in fellowship
[52:50] what do we have a breakfast why don't we
[52:52] just meet and talk but there's something
[52:55] about eating that brings a fellowship
[52:58] and now did you notice jesus the closing
[53:01] of his life's journey he wanted a little
[53:03] time of fellowship with the disciples so
[53:06] he called them apart
[53:07] set a table and broke bread blessed it
[53:10] and had eating and the last supper was a
[53:13] fellowship with his disciples just
[53:15] before he crossed over into the other
[53:17] land to be our high priest
[53:20] what wonderful words the prophet is is
[53:23] is is showing us what this last supper
[53:26] with the disciples was and so just
[53:28] continuing on in mark verse 18 now
[53:30] chapter 14 verse 18 it says and as they
[53:33] sat and did eat jesus said verily i say
[53:36] unto you
[53:37] one of you which eateth with me shall
[53:39] betray me well this this dinner just got
[53:41] awkward
[53:43] i mean yeah
[53:45] i thought
[53:46] i thought we were gonna have a good time
[53:48] i thought we were all just gonna
[53:50] muck it up and just you know talk about
[53:53] all the miracles
[53:54] and
[53:55] you can imagine the atmosphere
[53:58] and imagine the feelings but but i i
[54:01] hope if i can say this right now as we
[54:04] move towards the communion table
[54:07] as we move towards foot washing
[54:09] that maybe by god's grace there can be a
[54:12] sobriety
[54:13] and a sincerity in our hearts of what
[54:16] we're really approaching
[54:20] because here jesus there they're coming
[54:22] to the communion table and he's sitting
[54:24] down he said one of you that eateth with
[54:26] me shall betray me
[54:28] and they begin to be sorrowful and to
[54:30] say unto
[54:32] him one by one is it i
[54:34] and another said is an eye what are they
[54:36] doing they're searching they're they're
[54:37] they're asking
[54:39] is it i
[54:40] and you would think
[54:42] that
[54:42] you would think they're asking
[54:45] that if he would at least reveal to him
[54:47] what's in their heart then they could
[54:48] make it right
[54:51] is it i and he answered and said to them
[54:53] it is the it is one of the twelve that
[54:55] dippeth with me in the dish the son of
[54:57] man indeed goeth as it is written of him
[54:59] but woe to that man by whom the son of
[55:01] man is betrayed
[55:03] good were for that man to have never
[55:05] been born and as they did eat jesus took
[55:07] bread and blessed it and break it and
[55:10] gave to them and said take eat
[55:13] this is my body
[55:15] now remember we've jumped into the
[55:17] gospels to catch
[55:18] what
[55:19] what john comes in at the end of this
[55:21] and saying when supper was ended
[55:23] so all of these things are being are
[55:25] taking place before
[55:27] we get to that portion in john
[55:30] so he says and he took the cup and when
[55:32] he gave thanks he gave it to them and
[55:33] they all drank
[55:34] of it and he said unto them
[55:37] just some of some of it does overlap
[55:39] john does mention that later
[55:41] some of it's overlapping but just moving
[55:43] he says and he said unto them this is my
[55:44] blood of the new testament which is shed
[55:46] for many verily i say to you i will
[55:48] drink no more of the fruit of the vine
[55:50] until that day that i drink it anew in
[55:52] the kingdom of god
[55:54] i mean what a mouthful these disciples
[55:56] are getting
[55:58] one of you are going to betray me
[56:00] but i'm not going to drink no more fruit
[56:01] of the vine until the day i come in the
[56:03] kingdom you know you can imagine that
[56:05] the atmosphere
[56:07] and and they're looking around at their
[56:09] brothers and saying who who in the world
[56:11] would betray the lord
[56:13] what is what is happening here that you
[56:15] no doubt you could feel the atmosphere
[56:18] in the room and and and i just want to
[56:20] um
[56:21] just to make this statement here that if
[56:23] you were to go into the book of matthew
[56:25] you you would find matthew will give
[56:27] this it's it's almost verbatim in
[56:29] matthew chapter 26 verse 20 through 29
[56:32] it's identical to mark 14 with where
[56:34] we're reading but but matthew makes one
[56:37] distinction that you don't find in the
[56:39] other gospels where in matthew 26 25
[56:42] when they're all asking is that i is it
[56:44] i actually matthew makes note of this in
[56:47] matthew 26 verse 25 says then judas
[56:49] which betrayed him
[56:52] so think of this
[56:54] judas is already you know
[56:56] he had enough of about a week ago when
[56:58] when mary
[57:00] you know mary had had uh
[57:02] um you know
[57:04] wasted 300 pence he he about had it so
[57:07] what did he do he went he betrayed the
[57:10] lord he had set it all up to betray him
[57:12] so he's already done it
[57:15] he has already conceived this wickedness
[57:17] in his heart to betray the lord and you
[57:19] wonder now is is he
[57:21] is it is he this is he that ignorant or
[57:24] is he is he asking to know if he's
[57:26] caught
[57:27] i'm you almost like
[57:28] is he asking did he find me out
[57:32] it's really quite
[57:33] profound to think but i tell you what
[57:35] when a strong delusion comes upon you
[57:38] you can live and stay in a condition
[57:41] if you just don't flat out call out to
[57:43] god say oh god
[57:44] i want to be right with you lord if i've
[57:47] done something wrong if i've done
[57:49] something to betray you lord if you're
[57:51] asking is it i don't don't do it in a
[57:53] way like
[57:54] you know i am i caught have i been found
[57:57] out because how many times have you been
[57:58] caught for something and you are not
[58:00] sorry you did it
[58:01] you're sorry you got caught
[58:05] unfortunately that's
[58:07] most of the time
[58:09] especially when you're dealing with your
[58:10] kids they ain't sorry they did it
[58:12] they're sorry they got caught
[58:14] or they wouldn't have done it
[58:15] they don't tell on themselves very often
[58:17] but every once in a while as they grow
[58:18] and and god deals with their heart
[58:20] they'll come and make stuff right say
[58:21] you know what i did this and i shouldn't
[58:22] have done it you're like man praise god
[58:24] for that
[58:25] and they don't have to be sorry when
[58:27] they get caught they're sorry they did
[58:28] it because god convicted their heart so
[58:29] he says he says in this
[58:31] uh verse 25 then judas which betrayed
[58:33] him answer said master is it i
[58:36] and he said unto him thou has said
[58:39] i i want to maybe pick that up here a
[58:41] little later but just think of that
[58:44] thou hast said
[58:47] now
[58:50] we're we're in the book of mark
[58:52] and we were talking about how it
[58:54] parallels
[58:55] uh with with matthew
[58:57] um i think verse 25 and 29 say the same
[59:00] thing about eating the fruit of the vine
[59:02] and so i'm i'm letting you know that
[59:04] because i'm about to read a quote where
[59:06] brother branham is referring to matthew
[59:08] 26 29
[59:09] um which is also mark 14 25 i believe
[59:13] but brother branham says this in
[59:14] adoption uh number four he says but but
[59:17] listen to the 29th verse i say i will
[59:20] not drink henceforth of the fruit of the
[59:21] vine
[59:22] until that day when i drink it anew with
[59:24] you and my father's kingdom
[59:26] what the same thing melchizedek did
[59:29] after abraham had got his position set
[59:32] his men in order and won the battle and
[59:35] had come home and melchizedek come out
[59:37] with bread and wine
[59:39] after the battle's over then we'll eat
[59:41] the wedding supper with the lord jesus
[59:44] in the new world so now we're seeing a
[59:47] prophet take that scripture and he's
[59:49] telling us what the meaning of it is
[59:52] i wouldn't have figured that out
[59:55] but he's he's telling him right now that
[59:57] that's what mark 14 25 that's what
[1:00:00] matthew 26 uh uh 29 is he's speaking of
[1:00:05] we'll eat the wedding supper with the
[1:00:07] lord jesus in the new world
[1:00:09] and i just want to keep uh
[1:00:11] just reading scripture here as we
[1:00:13] continue to move and jump into the book
[1:00:15] of uh luke now if you'll turn with me to
[1:00:17] chapter 22.
[1:00:28] so once again we we've come now to the
[1:00:30] upper room and this is luke's account
[1:00:32] in luke 22 verse 14
[1:00:35] and he says and when the hour was come
[1:00:38] luke chapter 22 verse 14 and 15
[1:00:42] he sat down and the 12 apostles with him
[1:00:46] and he said unto them with desire
[1:00:50] i have desired to eat this passover with
[1:00:53] you before i suffer
[1:00:56] you think of these words how that would
[1:00:59] i i would feel that if i was the one in
[1:01:01] that room and here my lord is looking at
[1:01:04] me and and no doubt you could you could
[1:01:06] feel the
[1:01:07] you could just feel it from his eyes and
[1:01:10] him looking at at them and maybe the
[1:01:12] atmosphere in the room and and how
[1:01:15] everything that's transpired over the
[1:01:16] last week and everything that's being
[1:01:18] said and and knowing that they're
[1:01:20] they're seeking to kill him and to take
[1:01:21] his life and here he comes to this upper
[1:01:24] room and he's telling them all with
[1:01:25] desire
[1:01:27] i have desire to eat this passover with
[1:01:30] you
[1:01:32] before i suffer and i just want to pull
[1:01:34] these scriptures
[1:01:36] up
[1:01:37] and link them together because in
[1:01:39] revelations 3 20 he says behold i stand
[1:01:41] at the door and knock
[1:01:43] and if any man hear my voice and open
[1:01:45] the door i will come into him and will
[1:01:47] suck with him and he with me
[1:01:51] i have desire to have fellowship with
[1:01:52] you i have desire to have communion oh
[1:01:55] i've looked forward to this moment i
[1:01:57] look forward to this time i i've been
[1:01:59] i've just everything that's within me
[1:02:01] i've been wanting to come to this moment
[1:02:03] and with desire i have desired to eat
[1:02:05] and commune with you
[1:02:08] and the prophet of god would say this in
[1:02:10] the message to the lady is he in church
[1:02:12] in 1958 he would say now sup here means
[1:02:15] to commune or fellowship
[1:02:17] jesus wants fellowship that's what god's
[1:02:21] heart longs for tonight
[1:02:25] fellowship
[1:02:27] if anything this last supper this
[1:02:29] communion this this fellowship here that
[1:02:32] he's having with his disciples he knows
[1:02:34] this is the last time
[1:02:37] that he's going to eat with them
[1:02:40] and that corporal body like that until
[1:02:43] he comes again
[1:02:45] into the new kingdom is that not what
[1:02:46] the prophet said is that not we've read
[1:02:48] so just think about uh th this is this
[1:02:51] is the last meal this is the last supper
[1:02:54] and and and he's he's he's cherishing
[1:02:57] this moment of fellowship with his
[1:02:58] disciples to be able to to break bread
[1:03:01] and to be able to eat it
[1:03:03] now we know many more things happen
[1:03:06] uh after his resurrection but but yet
[1:03:09] just think of how it's said
[1:03:11] in that form and that corporal body and
[1:03:13] the way that he was there he's saying
[1:03:14] look i'm not going to be able to i'm not
[1:03:16] going to eat of the fruit of the vine
[1:03:17] until i come again in my kingdom
[1:03:19] and that's um
[1:03:22] just there's so much
[1:03:23] studies on everything we're moving
[1:03:25] through quickly but just continuing on
[1:03:27] in the book of luke in verse 19 he says
[1:03:29] then he took bread and gave thanks and
[1:03:31] break it and gave it unto them saying
[1:03:33] this is my body which is given for you
[1:03:36] do this in remembrance of me
[1:03:39] likewise also the cop after supper
[1:03:41] saying this
[1:03:43] cup is the new testament in my blood
[1:03:45] which is shed for you
[1:03:50] now
[1:03:50] we know paul said you know follow me as
[1:03:52] i follow christ
[1:03:54] and i just want to throw this in there
[1:03:56] because
[1:03:56] paul picks this up in first corinthians
[1:03:59] chapter 11
[1:04:00] verse 18 and and i'm certainly in uh
[1:04:03] just
[1:04:05] wanting to just give you scripture so
[1:04:07] you can
[1:04:08] read it pour over it
[1:04:10] study it yourselves not trying to say
[1:04:12] anything more than what the scripture is
[1:04:14] saying
[1:04:17] so notice he just said in in in verse 20
[1:04:20] there likewise also the cup after supper
[1:04:22] saying this is the cup in the new
[1:04:23] testament of my blood which is shed for
[1:04:26] you and paul now he's going to pick this
[1:04:29] up and and
[1:04:30] i won't expound um
[1:04:33] on it but just read
[1:04:34] what paul says because many times when
[1:04:36] we get to
[1:04:38] verse 23 it seems like he's just saying
[1:04:40] this out of nowhere
[1:04:42] um
[1:04:43] but
[1:04:44] paul is going to say now i think we're
[1:04:46] speaking about communion about coming
[1:04:47] together
[1:04:49] having communion with the lord
[1:04:52] and paul's going to pick this up and say
[1:04:53] for first of all when you come together
[1:04:55] in the church i hear that there be
[1:04:57] divisions among you and i partly believe
[1:04:59] it for there must be also heresies among
[1:05:02] you that they which are approved may be
[1:05:04] made manifest among you when you come
[1:05:06] together there into one place
[1:05:08] this is not to eat the lord's supper for
[1:05:10] an eating everyone taketh before another
[1:05:12] his own supper and one is hungry and the
[1:05:14] other is drunken what have ye not houses
[1:05:17] to eat and drink in or despise you the
[1:05:19] church of god and shame them that have
[1:05:21] not what shall i say to you shall i
[1:05:23] praise you in this i praise you not for
[1:05:26] i have received of the lord that which i
[1:05:29] have delivered unto you that the lord
[1:05:31] jesus the same night in which he was
[1:05:33] betrayed took bread now
[1:05:36] this all sudden should
[1:05:39] should really catch your attention that
[1:05:41] paul is now
[1:05:43] showing that even even the same night
[1:05:46] that the communion was taken
[1:05:48] jesus was also betrayed
[1:05:50] that same night
[1:05:53] and now just jumping back into luke
[1:05:55] chapter 22 verse 21
[1:05:59] notice he continues to say but behold
[1:06:02] so what did paul just said he said the
[1:06:04] same night
[1:06:05] the lord
[1:06:07] took communion the same night he did as
[1:06:08] he was betrayed and now we're we're
[1:06:10] right back at the table with the lord in
[1:06:12] verse 21 of luke chapter 22 verse 27 he
[1:06:15] says but behold the hand of him that
[1:06:16] betrayeth me is with me on the table
[1:06:20] and truly the son of man goeth as it was
[1:06:22] determined but woe unto that man by whom
[1:06:25] he is betrayed and they began to inquire
[1:06:28] among themselves which of them was that
[1:06:30] should do this thing and remember we
[1:06:32] read matthew 26 25
[1:06:34] where where
[1:06:36] where judah said master is it i
[1:06:39] and he said thou sayest
[1:06:41] and you know what strikes my heart is is
[1:06:43] that was an opportunity for him to
[1:06:45] repent
[1:06:49] am i the one that did this thing thou
[1:06:50] sayest
[1:06:52] oh if there would have been
[1:06:54] if that would have been me
[1:06:56] oh i i would have i would have cried ass
[1:06:59] oh god please don't let it be forgive me
[1:07:02] o god
[1:07:03] if i've done anything to transgress your
[1:07:05] word if if i've done something lord that
[1:07:07] i would be the one to betray you or
[1:07:09] please
[1:07:10] forgive me oh god what can i do to make
[1:07:12] it right
[1:07:14] see that was his opportunity that's just
[1:07:16] how it spoke to me
[1:07:18] once it was exposed hey you know
[1:07:21] he had conceived it in his heart and
[1:07:23] he's asking him is it i and he's like
[1:07:24] look thou says thou know you know what
[1:07:26] you did
[1:07:27] and many of us we know what we did
[1:07:30] we know how we're living
[1:07:32] and we're coming to the communion table
[1:07:34] you know your condition you know the way
[1:07:36] that you're living
[1:07:38] you know the sin that you're committing
[1:07:43] is it eye master thou sayest thou know
[1:07:47] but we're going to move on and what paul
[1:07:48] says i mean what yeah what paul says
[1:07:50] that many are sick among us
[1:07:53] because we're not discerning the lord's
[1:07:55] body
[1:07:57] thou sayest see he knew what he had done
[1:08:01] and i feel many times i say oh god what
[1:08:03] was our pastor talking about
[1:08:06] about conviction
[1:08:09] if you've done wrong it's the grace of
[1:08:10] god to have conviction
[1:08:12] because it just seems that judas was
[1:08:14] void of it
[1:08:16] he's like yeah did i get caught am i the
[1:08:18] one that did it thou says yep
[1:08:21] you know he didn't have that ability
[1:08:23] but god being a just god i i know he
[1:08:25] gave him a space to repent he gave cain
[1:08:27] a space to repent but it wasn't in them
[1:08:28] to repent
[1:08:30] i say oh god if you ever give me a space
[1:08:31] to repent
[1:08:33] let me be quick to repent oh god
[1:08:37] so just continuing on now
[1:08:40] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 27
[1:08:42] now he says wherefore so we're just
[1:08:44] jumping back into paul's account now
[1:08:49] he says wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:08:51] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:08:53] lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:08:56] of the body and blood of the lord
[1:09:00] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:09:03] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:09:05] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:09:07] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:09:10] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:09:12] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:09:14] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:09:17] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:09:19] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:09:22] chastened of the lord that we should not
[1:09:24] be condemned with
[1:09:25] the world
[1:09:28] my
[1:09:29] approaching the communion table should
[1:09:31] be sobering
[1:09:34] we should stand before that year in
[1:09:35] thumb and just like these disciples were
[1:09:39] is it i lord
[1:09:40] am i though am i the one that did it
[1:09:44] and here paul when he jumps into
[1:09:47] chapter 13 and he starts to talk about
[1:09:49] communion says hey when we all come
[1:09:50] together there's dispens
[1:09:52] we're disputing and we're fighting and
[1:09:54] some are living this way and some are
[1:09:56] living that way it shouldn't be that way
[1:09:58] and then you look at these disciples and
[1:10:00] they're they're doing the same thing
[1:10:02] because you could jump back into the
[1:10:04] luke and and and right after
[1:10:06] right after the lord says
[1:10:08] one of you are going to betray me and
[1:10:10] they're all asking is it i is that i you
[1:10:12] you jump into luke chapter 22 verse 24
[1:10:15] and all of a sudden there's strife among
[1:10:17] them which of them should be accounted
[1:10:18] the greatest i mean these guys are
[1:10:20] carnal man
[1:10:23] yes
[1:10:24] am i the worst sinner in here am i the
[1:10:27] one that betrayed you and all of a
[1:10:28] sudden i mean weren't they getting some
[1:10:29] fight now well he wouldn't know you
[1:10:31] wouldn't do that like well then if we
[1:10:32] can't figure out who's the worst of us
[1:10:34] all who's the best of us i mean how did
[1:10:36] that happen how did they go from
[1:10:38] wondering am i going to win all said
[1:10:39] well if i ain't the worst of them maybe
[1:10:41] i'm at least the best of us
[1:10:43] what's wrong with us
[1:10:45] ain't no big eyes or little users our
[1:10:47] pastor says the human factor
[1:10:50] and imagine the gravity of this moment
[1:10:53] of approaching the communion table
[1:10:56] and we're thinking about all this
[1:10:57] nonsense
[1:10:59] and so we could spend some time there in
[1:11:01] luke and and how um
[1:11:03] my they're just carnal well then who's
[1:11:05] the greatest of us and then and then the
[1:11:06] lord would would all of a sudden speak
[1:11:08] to simon and say satan's desire to sift
[1:11:12] you as wheat and boy and it seems like
[1:11:13] satan's i would like you know peter's
[1:11:15] being called out now maybe they're like
[1:11:17] is he is he the one
[1:11:18] and he's going to go on and and and and
[1:11:21] there there's much more that could be
[1:11:22] said about that because he's about to
[1:11:23] tell peter look you're going to betray
[1:11:25] me and now they're thinking he's the guy
[1:11:28] oh i'm telling you these these disciples
[1:11:30] were a mess
[1:11:32] i don't know about you but i actually
[1:11:33] kind of makes me feel okay
[1:11:37] because i've been a mess
[1:11:39] so many times i've been an absolute mess
[1:11:42] but i can at least say like the
[1:11:44] disciples
[1:11:45] you know they might have been a mess but
[1:11:46] you know what they kept doing
[1:11:48] they kept following the lord
[1:11:51] they didn't know what else to do and i
[1:11:54] tell you it's the same thing with the
[1:11:55] message of the hour i i i don't i don't
[1:11:57] i can i can get in all of a mess and
[1:11:59] think i got this figured out and that
[1:12:01] figured out and this person over here
[1:12:03] says that and then you think you got you
[1:12:05] know you you got this
[1:12:07] figured out and all of a sudden it runs
[1:12:08] back together and it you know one quote
[1:12:10] pulls your whole foundation out from
[1:12:12] underneath you on this thought and you
[1:12:13] realize do i even know what i'm talking
[1:12:15] about
[1:12:17] but then there's something in there that
[1:12:19] no matter what
[1:12:22] you know
[1:12:23] that you will say just like peter
[1:12:26] lord thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:12:28] where in the world am i going to go from
[1:12:31] here
[1:12:32] because it's not something that you've
[1:12:34] done it's something that god's done it's
[1:12:36] something that god put in you because
[1:12:37] them disciples would have been gone a
[1:12:39] long time ago
[1:12:40] and the the fact the grace of god they
[1:12:42] make it to the upper room it was
[1:12:44] something that was keeping them so just
[1:12:45] to move towards a close here so we can
[1:12:47] get to communion
[1:12:49] but now we're back here at the very
[1:12:51] beginning just
[1:12:52] in john
[1:12:54] chapter 13.
[1:12:58] supper being ended the devil now put it
[1:13:00] in the heart of judas iscariot simon's
[1:13:02] son to betray him at verse 4 in john 13
[1:13:05] says he riseth from supper and laid
[1:13:07] aside his garments and took a towel and
[1:13:09] girdeth himself
[1:13:10] and after that he poureth water into a
[1:13:12] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:13:14] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:13:16] wherein he was girden
[1:13:18] now we got the scene here
[1:13:21] of
[1:13:22] of now foot washing imagine everything
[1:13:24] that's been going on everything that's
[1:13:25] going to be being said and who's the
[1:13:27] greatest who's the least who's going to
[1:13:29] trace peter you're satan desire to sift
[1:13:31] you as we you know uh uh one of you
[1:13:33] here's uh you can imagine
[1:13:35] uh the gravity of this moment just think
[1:13:37] of now even over the last week
[1:13:38] everything that's transpiring
[1:13:40] and the atmosphere in the room and how
[1:13:42] they're all feeling and knowing they
[1:13:44] feel unworthy and fellow who's going to
[1:13:45] betray what's going to go on what's
[1:13:46] going to happen and all of a sudden
[1:13:48] jesus rises from supper
[1:13:50] and he girds himself and now he's going
[1:13:52] to start washing their feet
[1:13:56] you could just imagine how surreal
[1:13:59] this this this feeling of these
[1:14:00] disciples would be just like what it
[1:14:02] what is going on here
[1:14:06] and remember they're in a large upper
[1:14:08] room
[1:14:09] it's a special prepared place that has
[1:14:12] been furnished it's in the evening time
[1:14:14] that he's come with the twelve and he's
[1:14:16] doing football he's doing he's had
[1:14:17] communion and now he starts to wash
[1:14:20] their feet and the prophet of god would
[1:14:22] say in the unwelcome christ and hear the
[1:14:24] greatest of men
[1:14:26] the greatest of all men god manifested
[1:14:29] in the flesh become a foot wash flunky
[1:14:31] with humility
[1:14:33] the king of all eternity all glory the
[1:14:35] creator of heavens and earth washed the
[1:14:36] dung off of men's feet
[1:14:38] then we think were something we got on a
[1:14:41] fifty dollar suit and oh
[1:14:43] god have mercy on us
[1:14:46] i wish we could feel the sincerity of
[1:14:48] that quote
[1:14:52] that here god manifested in the flesh
[1:14:54] washed the dumb
[1:14:56] off of the disciples feet
[1:14:59] but we get a we get a little piece of
[1:15:01] garment or nice clothes and we think
[1:15:02] we're somebody we get a nice job or we
[1:15:05] get something we think we've done
[1:15:06] something
[1:15:09] well the scripture would say in proverbs
[1:15:11] 15 33 that the fear of the lord is the
[1:15:14] instruction of wisdom and before honor
[1:15:17] is humility
[1:15:18] proverbs 22 4 by humility and fear of
[1:15:21] the lord are riches and honor and life
[1:15:26] you find in the old testament humility
[1:15:28] also means meekness
[1:15:31] where psalms 37 11 will say but the meek
[1:15:33] shall inherit the earth
[1:15:35] and shall delight themselves in
[1:15:36] abundance of peace
[1:15:39] and and this is the scripture
[1:15:41] that you see just even the more
[1:15:43] fulfillment of it as he just come in on
[1:15:45] palm sunday zachariah 99 says rejoice
[1:15:48] greatly o daughter of zion shout o
[1:15:50] daughter of jerusalem behold thy king
[1:15:52] cometh unto thee he is just and having
[1:15:54] salvation
[1:15:55] lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a
[1:15:58] cult the full of an ass lowly
[1:16:00] poor afflicted humble to so much where
[1:16:03] he even humbled himself to a foot wash
[1:16:05] flunky are you willing to humble
[1:16:07] yourself to a foot wash flunky where you
[1:16:09] you don't think yourself above anybody
[1:16:17] jesus said take my yoke upon you and
[1:16:19] learn of me for i am meek and lowly in
[1:16:21] heart
[1:16:22] and ye shall find rest upon your souls
[1:16:28] foot washing communion
[1:16:30] you think of
[1:16:32] the the atmosphere in that room
[1:16:36] the things that have been being talked
[1:16:37] about
[1:16:39] how they've really been challenged
[1:16:42] to search their heart
[1:16:44] and their motives and their objectives
[1:16:47] and him saying look who eateth and
[1:16:49] drinketh of this drink damnation unto
[1:16:51] themselves
[1:16:54] testimony upon the sea in 62 you know
[1:16:57] when you go into their homes there
[1:16:59] the first thing they do they take a foot
[1:17:01] wash flunky now that's the lowest paid
[1:17:04] man of the bunch is a foot wash flunky
[1:17:06] he goes out there and when a guest comes
[1:17:08] in he sets up his feet and he takes his
[1:17:11] sandals off and washed his feet because
[1:17:14] they walked on the road and the animals
[1:17:16] walked on the road you understand where
[1:17:18] the animals and had got the dust and
[1:17:20] when they walked they had a robe on and
[1:17:22] it picked up the dust and it settled on
[1:17:24] their limbs and things and oh the stink
[1:17:26] from the animals it wasn't nice to go
[1:17:28] into a home so they had a foot wash
[1:17:30] flunky he was the lowest paid man of the
[1:17:33] bunch and he got he'd get out there and
[1:17:35] wash their feet
[1:17:36] and then then make them welcome you see
[1:17:39] put them on a clean pair of sandals and
[1:17:42] jesus
[1:17:43] became a foot wash flunky the lowest job
[1:17:47] in the earth
[1:17:50] and somebody failed to wash his feet
[1:17:53] referring to jesus sitting there with
[1:17:55] dirty feet
[1:17:58] i say oh god
[1:18:00] may i never be guilty
[1:18:03] may i be quick lord to wash your feet
[1:18:05] with my tears
[1:18:07] and with honor
[1:18:10] in humility
[1:18:11] bow before the lord and reverence and
[1:18:13] worship
[1:18:15] jesus would say in matthew 23
[1:18:18] but he that is greatest among you shall
[1:18:19] be your servant
[1:18:21] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[1:18:23] be abased and he that shall humble
[1:18:25] himself shall be exalted
[1:18:27] i just want to end right along these
[1:18:29] lines
[1:18:30] just to think of peter here
[1:18:33] watching all of this unfold
[1:18:36] think of how astonished peter would have
[1:18:38] been
[1:18:39] just all the events leading up to this
[1:18:43] you know here they're thinking of you
[1:18:45] know restoring the kingdom
[1:18:47] you know here christ is coming to
[1:18:48] restore the kingdom and we're going to
[1:18:50] kick out all the all the romans and
[1:18:53] we're going to be a victorious people
[1:18:55] and and we're going to get the kingdom
[1:18:56] back in power and he chose us i mean
[1:18:59] we're like the first ones man we're the
[1:19:01] first 12 we're going to be right there
[1:19:03] riding in victory and our king that
[1:19:06] cometh in all glories
[1:19:08] he's washing dung off of our feet
[1:19:12] and it
[1:19:13] it's it's not registering
[1:19:16] they don't understand what's going on
[1:19:17] think of peter looking at this
[1:19:19] and that's why verse 6 john
[1:19:22] uh verse six john 13 verse six p peter
[1:19:25] simon peter peter saith in the lord just
[1:19:27] thou wash my feet
[1:19:31] lord you're not a foot wash flunky what
[1:19:32] are you doing lord
[1:19:34] this isn't a job that you should be
[1:19:36] doing this is below this is below me
[1:19:37] this is below you what are you doing
[1:19:40] the prophet said look my text tonight
[1:19:43] speaking of images of christ he says
[1:19:45] just for a short time the subject of
[1:19:47] images of christ and i want for a
[1:19:48] subject what what would this be what
[1:19:52] does it take to make a christian
[1:19:55] that just left an effect on me because
[1:19:58] what has jesus done he's put an image
[1:20:00] now
[1:20:02] that these disciples will never forget
[1:20:06] peter says answer to what
[1:20:08] jesus answered him said look jesus
[1:20:11] answered said unto him what i do thou
[1:20:12] knowest not now
[1:20:14] but thou shalt know hereafter
[1:20:19] that should have been enough but it just
[1:20:21] couldn't match up to peter's the image
[1:20:23] in his head
[1:20:25] of what the lord
[1:20:27] should have been doing but i'm thankful
[1:20:28] he said look what i'm doing right now
[1:20:31] you don't understand
[1:20:34] but you'll know hereafter
[1:20:36] and that's why i believe we should pray
[1:20:37] for revelation as we come to the close
[1:20:39] here john 13 8 says peter sayeth in him
[1:20:42] thou shalt never wash my feet jesus
[1:20:44] answer said if i wash thee not thou hast
[1:20:46] no part with me simon peter said it unto
[1:20:48] the lord
[1:20:49] not my feet only but also my hands and
[1:20:51] my head
[1:20:52] peter look you don't know what i'm doing
[1:20:54] right now
[1:20:56] but you'll know here later
[1:20:59] and i just want to say this that from
[1:21:01] that time
[1:21:02] i believe that those
[1:21:04] disciples never looked at a foot wash
[1:21:06] flunky the same ever again
[1:21:09] i i i believe it changed them forever
[1:21:14] no matter what house
[1:21:16] what restaurant wherever they went
[1:21:19] whenever they went into a building and
[1:21:20] all of a sudden
[1:21:22] that one came
[1:21:24] and started to wash their feet
[1:21:26] they could they could almost see his
[1:21:27] face
[1:21:29] and something in their heart
[1:21:31] would start to well up oh
[1:21:33] what a savior
[1:21:36] he humbled himself to the lowest job to
[1:21:38] even wash our feet
[1:21:42] what a savior
[1:21:45] he humbled himself even unto death
[1:21:48] philippians 2 3 8 would say let nothing
[1:21:50] be done through
[1:21:52] strive for vainglory
[1:21:54] but in lowliness of mind
[1:21:56] let us esteem each other better than our
[1:21:58] themselves
[1:21:59] look not every man on his own things but
[1:22:01] every man also on the things of others
[1:22:04] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:22:06] in christ jesus
[1:22:08] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:22:10] not robber to be equal with god
[1:22:12] but made himself of no reputation
[1:22:15] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:22:18] it was made in the likeness of men
[1:22:21] and being found in the fashion of many
[1:22:23] man he humbled himself
[1:22:24] and became obedient unto death
[1:22:27] even to the death of the cross
[1:22:30] peter
[1:22:32] he that washeth needeth not
[1:22:34] saved to wash his feet but is clean
[1:22:36] every
[1:22:37] and ye are clean
[1:22:39] but all nah but not all not all
[1:22:42] because judas was there but he said ye
[1:22:44] are clean
[1:22:46] oh he was speaking of another cleansing
[1:22:47] that was coming
[1:22:49] peter i'm
[1:22:50] i'm to go
[1:22:52] lay my life down at the cross and shed
[1:22:54] my blood
[1:22:56] because i'm that true sacrificial lamb
[1:22:58] and when you're washed
[1:23:00] oh and you're washed in the water
[1:23:02] of the word when you're washed into the
[1:23:04] blood of jesus christ there's coming and
[1:23:06] washing peter what i'm doing right now
[1:23:08] you don't know but hereafter
[1:23:10] you'll know so much more we could we
[1:23:13] could continue on in that but just
[1:23:14] that's just a portion as we just need to
[1:23:17] cut it so we can get into communion so
[1:23:18] god bless you
[1:23:20] [Applause]
[1:23:29] amen didn't you enjoy that
[1:23:32] you know you could just see all those
[1:23:34] different emotions going different
[1:23:36] things and i like what that verse um
[1:23:40] um
[1:23:42] he's closed with
[1:23:44] in
[1:23:45] he says in matthew in luke the 26th
[1:23:49] verse of that chapter
[1:23:53] of 22 he said
[1:23:55] but you shall not be so
[1:23:57] but he that is greatest among you let
[1:24:00] him be as the younger
[1:24:02] and he that is chief
[1:24:05] as he that death serve
[1:24:08] for whether
[1:24:10] wither is greater
[1:24:12] he that sitteth that meat
[1:24:14] or he that serveth is not he that
[1:24:17] sitteth that meat
[1:24:19] but i am among you
[1:24:22] he
[1:24:23] that serveth
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:26] i think that
[1:24:27] but it puts a lot of things into
[1:24:29] communion
[1:24:30] really what we should be coming to
[1:24:32] communion for
[1:24:34] and what it is that we should be
[1:24:35] communing with
[1:24:37] we should be communing with that spirit
[1:24:40] that makes us serve
[1:24:42] and love and look everybody upon
[1:24:45] everybody as greater
[1:24:47] than ourselves if the brothers would go
[1:24:50] bring the communion
[1:24:52] together
[1:24:53] we'll just stand for a moment
[1:25:02] and let's just read those same
[1:25:04] scriptures
[1:25:06] right there in the 22nd chapter of luke
[1:25:13] and he says and he took bread
[1:25:16] and gave thanks and break it
[1:25:19] and he gave it unto them saying this is
[1:25:22] my body
[1:25:23] which is given for you this do in
[1:25:27] remembrance of me
[1:25:30] and likewise also the cup
[1:25:32] after supper saying
[1:25:35] this cup is the new testament
[1:25:38] in my blood which is shed for you
[1:25:43] amen
[1:25:44] and then we know the rest of these
[1:25:46] scriptures so let us keep it on our
[1:25:49] heart as the brothers bring and we pray
[1:25:52] for our bread and for our wine
