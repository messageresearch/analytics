John the First Epistle of st. John I thought they called first John and let's read in the fourth chapter of first John and you know this morning we talked a little bit about the condition and the way things are going but tonight we're going to talk about the great hope that we also have amen because you know there's one thing we know for sure that God always equips his people to meet a challenge that's what he does so we're just gonna have a little fellowship tonight and a little bit of word of encouragement and I'm I don't know what the right word is you know it just felt within my heart if it was like maybe being led or sometimes I even used the word motivated I just felt to take a look and and and meditate on out of the message he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world and I thought how perfect that fits and we just want to talk about that and then it when you can go home and you can sit back and you can listen to it and maybe as you're listening to it you can see the little context of this thought now there's more in that message than I could ever preach in a lifetime now now this guaranty of that but it's really a good comforting message to increase our understanding so let's read these scriptures he said beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world we know that means preachers we know that means voices we know that means messages so there's a lot of false messages a lot of false things that have gone out into the world and so we just we don't want to believe every spirit and that's what we talked about this morning stop in for a moment say what effect is this having on me what is it doing to my faith what is it doing to my thinking it says it says hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God may I say here again that is not a historical recognition Amen that is a personal identification by experience Amen it's not saying oh I believe Jesus came 2,000 years ago I'm a I have the spirit no how could the spirit the word contradict itself it says Satan believes and fears and tremble so there's something deeper there that he's saying here and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of Antichrist this is the spirit of Antichrist where ye heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world god bless you you may be seated you know I just get such joy over just taking a message and and reading it and looking at the things that are said and and all that God has packed in it's it's a wonderful message it talks about some of the experience he's having the things that he's going through in life but I just like to take this little thought out for us in the hour that we're living because I certainly believe that this is spiritual food and due season and it's been spoken in just the manner that it was spoken in and maybe a lot of people kind of criticized maybe the grammar or the education behind it but there just seems something sometimes to be about just the sentence structure that that just causes an Enlightenment and and here's a message that brother branham's spoke on and I'd like to use this I guess kind of a context or a platform if we would use it in that light and this is from the message called look away to Jesus and he says the Bible said in isaiah 45:22 we find that god said look unto me all the ends of the earth and now when the earth has come to its end or the systems of the earth has come to its ends let the people look unto him now you might say we've heard this generation after generation we've heard this for a long time that is true and it's been preached for a long time many ministers have look at this same text thousands of them but here is the thing I want to ask you tonight for the next few minutes but when you look the question is now here's the question and and we want to use these these questions that he's going to ask and use these questions to go back and look at what is he that is in you em and so if I could just put it out like this if we want to we want to be stimulated by this this viewpoint to take a look at this message and and so we want to look at it to the eyes so he's asking a question and the question is but when you look the question is he says for the next few minute but when you look the question is what do you see when you look that is one of the questions what do you see when you look okay that's important I've always liked those pictures you know that have like us a snow flakes and and if you stare at it long enough all of a sudden something comes out of it and I always used to use it I says well that's like a revelation you know it's there but you can't see it till everything comes together you know and I've had people that they just can't see it and we were other the other day visiting with her brother and everybody could see it but him so we just told him he wasn't elected you know but but so that's the one question what do you see when you look so we're talking about look away to Jesus what do we see when you look the question also was what the he that doesn't confess that Jesus has come in the flesh is Antichrist so what do you see when you look what is it what do you see what do you understand that's what see means it means to understand it doesn't mean to see with your eye it's what speaks to your heart when you look when you hear that what how does it speak to your heart how does it move you how does it what rises up in your heart and then here is the other great question he says what do you see when you do look so the question there just the way he said it the emphasis isn't on the scene it's on the wind when you what do you see when you do look or when do you look I mean how how long do we wait to look towards the Lord how long do we wait to to seek an answer how long do we wait the prophet of cantata C says the trouble with man is they put God on the back burner and he's got to make them so desperate you know what I mean he's got to bring them into such desperation he's got to put them under so much pressure to get them to turn and look to him if he's there but man never seeks God first he that's what he said he says you have not sought me I sought you again so that's that the nature of man man has to exhaust himself before he'll finally humble himself to to give in to the Word of God where it ought to be the first place we go so many times it's the last place that we go so the question is what do we see look when it when we look away to the Lord what are what are we seeing well what does that mean to us I are messenger laboured with the people probably one of the greatest challenges he had is to to get the people to bring him out of history and make him the same yesterday today and forever to get the people to realize one that he was here and that he was the same and so it was no difference if if if the if the same Jesus came back in the same body that he was back when he walked on earth he would do the same work now that same Jesus was here but he was veiled in the veil of human flesh in the using the Ministry of a prophet debate it still was him and so when people looked what did they see they said they just saw the veil they saw the man they saw the flesh well that had to be that way because back in the days of Jesus that's what they saw - they just saw a man they saw a carpenter's son they saw an illegitimate Roman child they didn't you see what that was so that when they looked they they couldn't even see that they were blinded and and so the that would that was a great question to ask and and as the word of God began to unfold if it begin to unfold so he had and the question here is what do we see when it says that he that the Antichrist spirit even does now work you know what do we see when we look for the Antichrist spirit you know so many people think that it's what can you say maybe something that'll just fish maybe a certain being or a certain devil working in a certain way or a certain thing the mark of the beast what do people think the mark of the beast is and oh my goodness I've heard so many times people think it's a chip they're gonna put in you well they're whenever even chips invented so many years ago and people were still coming up with a definition for the mark of the beast and all along just think of it the mark of the beast was that Trinitarian baptism the Father Son and the Holy Ghost because the mark was one on your forehead which represented the way that you think it's a mark on your thinking and anybody that looks at God and sees them as three persons then they'll never be able to come into the Fellowship of Christ coming in the flesh because he's a second person he's somebody that that was there and came down and they'll never be able to see that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church so they'll never be able to confess that he has come in the flesh and that's why they couldn't see the message of the hour they couldn't seen the same God that was that came to redeem us not born of sex but created in the womb of Mary not using Mary not the mother of God but God Himself begotten a son a man there's one mediator between God and man the man Jesus Christ God created a man a second Adam and he dwelt in that man that man had the personality of God but God raised him up as a son oh he did he learned obedience by the things that he suffered we read in the scripture that in the wilderness that in his personal life he contended with himself that he had desires I I don't have the I didn't have the time to look it up but it crossed my mind somewhere it was spoke that that that he would have married Mary Magdalene I believe it was that he had in the affections you say all know he didn't yes he did he was tempted in every way that we were tempted in fact the scripture said he learned obedience and he humbled himself he became humble you talked about when he was in front of Pilate mine he could have showed off then couldn't he he said I've got angels if I was up this world my army would come fight for me yeah could you imagine little ol dinky Caesar's army against the army of God of all my I'd like to bend there to see that but then I wouldn't have been here so God's got a perfect plan amen but see they don't see it so what do you see when you read that scripture we've been taught by by the Antichrist spirit back what he said that spirit even does now work but little children you are the children of God so we asked the question what do we see when we look and the other question is when do we look what events have to take place what conditions have to come on us what has to transpire to to cause us or to make us bring us to that win or in other words it's realization time for me to look John said that spirit of Antichrist even now did you've heard about it coming but it even now is in the world it's even now working denying deity in flesh okay so we see that so we we want to ask ourselves I think now and and that's the whole theme that's been in my heart and I've expressed to you dear in this whole worldwide shut down and sure he showed you one thing it shows you that man isn't in control there's some micro body spirit out there that's got man under control we're ruled by an amoeba virus amoeba that's what rules the world the rules world ruled by fear some little unseen thing no under the scripture says we don't fight those things which we can deal see with our hands but we smite spiritual wickedness in high places and when is it going to cause us and and make this look at can see and because the the question is look away to Jesus look away to him so we're not talking about looking at him historically so there's got to be something that we should be able to look to there should be something that we should be able to find there should be some truth or or if I like this word better through some revelation that we can anchor on that lets us know where we stand how protected we are the the what we're fortified with that if God be for you who can be against you or as we say he that is in us is greater than he who is in the world when do we look at that when do we look away to that scripture because to look away to Jesus means to look away to the world because he was the word when do we look away to that when do when does it come down that we look away and we see we see the spirit of Antichrist even death word the spirit of Antichrist is confessing that Jesus Christ hasn't come in the flesh the spirit of Antichrist even now death work we look at the mark of the beast it's on the forehead which means that's the way that man thinks and the mark on the hand stood for the obedience to the rule and so what I thought was so marvelous about how quick this pandemic swept in and the measures that that man took in their desperate fight you know years ago if we were really a copy nation we would all fell down and sock laughter sock I'll get my tooth put back in and I'll be able to say some of these words and ashes you know what I mean it just we would have repented we were to call unto God we would have looked up at that if it was any other time in the period of man if we were the children of Israel we would have went crying unto the Lord we would have turned our hearts back to the Lord and the Lord would have came and had mercy on us no but we're just gonna do it ourselves remember the vision brother Ram had where he was look those he saw those people working in those test tubes and everything and they and he was warning them about what they were doing and oh they just kept going on they just looked up and went on working I don't trust him I don't I've got to the place that every word of man is a lie and every word I think fake the guys that talk about fake news are fake you know what I mean I'm I'm telling you there's only one place that we can anchor it's the Word of God so what do you see when you look at the Word of God where is the Word of God what do you see when you look when you look at all the false prophets all the thoughts voices all the false ministries all the false things that are out there what what have you finally came to that you've anchored on that this is the truth you can't be tossed to and fro he said if you're lukewarm I'll spill you out of my mouth you can't piece things together you can't take a little bit from here and a little bit from there and a little bit from there and can't have so you know this guy's contrary to this and this guy's contrary to that and there's all this confusion Satan's the author of confusion that's what's John saying little builders try every spirit there's many false prophets there's many false voices there's many people trying to feed you something to feed you a way to a think a feed you approach a feed you a spin feed you a false comfort tried evil spirits try do they manifest Jesus Christ in the flesh do they create that in you do they create Christ in you the hope of glory if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell in you that is that scripture that's what that's critter he that denies that the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ can be in you is Antichrist and if you want to go to a mall and you really get down to it they don't believe that same spirit that was in Jesus Christ the works that I do shall you do also because when it came and that spirit was present with us veiled in flesh doing the same signs and wonders raising the dead discerning the thoughts and tense of the heart they did exactly what they did in that day they called it Beelzebub and all you have to do is sit back and read what he said listen to what he taught I I marvel how that I'm getting off my track but I can't help myself I marvel at how all of a sudden people say oh he lied and it wasn't true all's you have to do is go look at out of their own mouths Tommy Osborne said this was a god man he testified who is that big old woman with all that hair and 25 pounds of making up on Tammy Faye right she talks about this and and all of them they're all testifying testifying what a great ministry what a great thing and everything yeah you're trying to tell me that anybody could make all that up and we'll have it all fit together and have so many people heal that's Antichrist spirit my spirit says God come in the flesh Jesus Christ came in the flag I don't have to try to write a disclaimer oh he wasn't God well Jesus without God wasn't God the scripture says there's only one mediator between God and man the man yeah you don't have to write disclaimers and you don't have to write disclaimers about yourself either we don't have to write disclaimer about ourselves that's just Leslie and I well we first heard about this message we we weren't clear you know I'm not going to my testimony but we were just young hippies and we had this big Christian coming in and we have this lady that sold a Watkins products you know it's like Avon back in them days there's no such thing as Amazon people actually showed up at your door and sold your hair brushes that's how old I am and you know we had a milkman how many those are the milkman is nobody knows what a cow is and so we're there and this lady comes in our house and nice lady I mean she had one of them pixie haircuts I don't remember if any of you remember pixie haircut looks a whole lot like mine does and you know they had those earrings on you know and and she'd come in nice lady and everything and we asked her we said have you ever heard a William Branham William Branham she said I was bromance meetings of course we're like wow we couldn't believe this was the first contact in flesh that we ever had of anything concerning brother Branham it was like really it's really real and she said oh yeah I had severe migraine headaches I mean so severe that that and I haven't had a migraine but they say Yoko actually drive you blind they can be so severe and she said he prayed for me he said and instantly I lost my headaches my headaches left me she said you know but something else really happened and she said I never understood this part of it she didn't even confess to be a Christian I mean she walked into our house and it looked like you were walking into a church you know we had Bibles everywhere and crosses everywhere you know and and she never even confessed to be a Christian never even made a comment about the gospel never even talked about thing you know pray or nothing and she said but you know the strangest thing I don't understand she said but I got the gift to play the piano and we look at her she says yeah she's I've been played I don't know how many years she said I haven't played in seven eight years you know you got to remember we're talking early 70s so brother Bannerman just gone off the scene so seven eight years would have been in 63 64 she said here I'll show you she went and sat at our piano took that piano little lip up and I'll guarantee you that piano was out of tune but I'll guarantee anot one note she played was out of tune and she started playing the piano like you believe there was an anointing came into that room that was so powerful it was just absolutely divine anointed piano player I don't understand it maybe God gave her that gift for that one moment at that time because he knew he had a son and a daughter and believers down the road that we're going to come in contact with this message and he set that vindication just so real and she played that piano and that piano has never ever sounded that good it never will sound that good in fact we sold that piano I tell you where it went to but I sold it to a fella that I knew that turned out to be a pretty famous musician around the world but it that piano had its day and from that moment on it was downhill I believe that God man can orchestrate that kind of thing the supernatural what was there and it was so evident and even the effect I've had personal healings in my life by listening to discernment and have brother Branham discerned somebody else with the same problem and faith rise up and be able to accept that same prayer on my behalf and see results you'll never come too late that's Antichrist spirit it shouldn't even be considered it shouldn't be messed with it shouldn't be given even the one special time or our heart should be so secure so let's just take a few moments if you don't mind - I'd like to read a few things and so we're talking about we're gonna look for a moment and see what we see and we're gonna sit back and we're gonna say when do we look well I think now is a good time to look so this is on page nine paragraph 44 of he that is in you and I'm sorry for my interpreters I forgot to give them the quotes they asked me for the scriptures but I forgot to tell them what message we're looking in but if you can find it on your phone or your tablet and I guess I don't know if we can put it up on the board here or not I can tell you one thing I remember the first time because anybody remember that little ebook that came out and I remember preaching a sermon right after the first time that book ebook came out and we used to say brother Branham said you know well I say brother Branham said in 50 people heads were down and they were all looking for it you know I found out you couldn't paraphrase like you used to you know what I mean and I also found out a lot of things that I thought brother Branham said he never said I do you know so that's why God don't give secondhand revelation he deals with the heart of the believer but now let's just take them on it can you put that up there on there up you can he that is in you paragraph 44 and it starts like this now everybody listen real close before I read the scripture okay now I read the scripture but he's saying everybody listen real close before I read the scripture all that ever would be redeemed God put their name on Pam's book of life before the world ever come into creation how many know that that's the scripture and the Antichrist in the last days is going to be so close like the real thing real Church everything just like Judas was until it would deceive the very elect 'add if it was possible is that right but no man can come to Jesus except God sends him but no man can come to Jesus except God sends him you know doesn't that put just a little different thought on the word draw we always think that we were pulled but there's another part that he's revealing to us that were sin so there's got to be something in you that was sent amen so that draw and scent you can see it working together or in other words how that God works that out just a beautiful way that it's spoken there he said is that right no man can come to Jesus except God sends him and all that God did give to him will come to him and when he takes that book that last name see all in the Luther age he pulled them out all in the Wesley age he pulled them out all in the different ages the Pentecostal age he pulls them out they're over here won't be judged with them they're rapturing and then when over here won't be judged with them they're rapturing and then when the last name comes out that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life that was slain before the foundation of the world when that last name has been redeemed his work is finished he comes forth to claim what he has redeemed that makes our heart bleed but if it went on a thousand years later there would not be one redeemed and no one can be redeemed unless they were a part they were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world who are they I don't know nobody else knows he just got alone I'm trusting that every one of us our names are on that book if mine was on there I'm sure to be there if it wasn't I won't be there that's all see it it's just up to God it's not in him that willeth him that runneth but God that showeth mercy see what a marvelous place amen now to me that's something we should be able to look to he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world we can't understand that yet we say we believe it and we know it's true but we really don't on understand it greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world what is in you that's greater it's Christ The Anointed God that was in Christ is in you greater is He that is in you than he that was in the world then if he is in you it's not you anymore living it's him living in you now we take that statement and we automatically start judging ourselves and the minute you start judging yourself in that statement you will fail every time because you still are in the flesh and the flesh wars against the spirit in the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary one to the other so you're in a built-in battle so it's not saying if Christ be in you then then he'll live in you and you will do what you do and say okay I shouldn't have any flesh no because we're tempted in the flesh there's something else that we're looking to before I read the scripture I want you to understand something that your name was put on a book before the foundation of the world he almost tells us in advance what he's going to try to show it and so he goes on and he says it's not you living anymore living it's him living in you see it's not your thinking and what you would think about this is what he said about this see then he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he said and he's trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through so if your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he cannot deny what he said he cannot deny you but he's looking for the person that that can be vindicated in when do we look and what are we seeing what is it that we're looking at what is it that we're expecting God to do what is it that we're expecting to be manifested if we know who we are but what are we what are we what is it that God is going to perform in us because he who is in us is greater than he who in the world so where was that put in us it was put in us before the foundation of the world brother Reza - not there I'm not going to be there Oh everybody wants to work their way in God it's a gift of God lest any man should boast not a he that willeth or he that runneth but God that show us the mercy and so as we reread here he says he absolutely would not deny what he said now that doesn't mean he had a I'll just read he says now but he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church that's God in you he that's in you no wonder the winds obeyed him in the waves obeyed him his word obeyed his word because it was God's Word through him he was a man that he was the Word made flesh see and when he spoke it was God speaking through human lips Amen just going to read a couple more statements to you John told the disciples you've heard of the Antichrist who is to come and is already here working in the children of disobedience but little children you are not of this world oh I wish I could grasp that little children the Antichrist spirit works but you are not of this world he's all crazy he's already here working in the children of disobedience but little children you're not of this world you're of God you're of God and greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world that's Christ in you the Creator he that created the heavens and the earth he was made manifest in the person of Jesus Christ God in Christ reconciling the world to himself let's see you say that wasn't the Son of God Oh brother branham all right let's find out if he's eternal and the everlasting God the same God that is in us tonight not only with us but in us he provided he proved he's within us greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world what are we afraid of the world now I can't just go through because there's so many great revelations tied up but I just want to share this with us tonight greater was God in Moses than Egypt in all - that Egypt it was greater was God the God that was in Moses was greater than the kingdom of Egypt or the Empire of Egypt the ruler of the world the magnificence of Pharaoh was so magnificent their science their education their their geometry their mathematics their hieroglyphs everything that they were that Kingdom was so magnificent that they thought that Pharaoh was divine they thought he was dot they thought it had to be divinity manifested in the flesh now isn't it amazing that when God came in the flesh he took a man with a stick an outcast of their Kingdom claiming to be his son oh if the types and parallels just start really getting exciting if you wouldn't don't watch it you'll go off into Pere mala ji and all kinds of things like that but it's just there here's a rejected guy who used to be in the palaces of Pharaoh he comes back with a donkey behind him and a stick and goes up the ferrule and says let my people go and people look at this Pharaoh as he's divine the power he's got the might he's got the army he has but greater was he that was in Moses that he that was in the world you could take Joshua the realm explained it this way the creator himself was in Joshua that's why Joshua could say moon be a son be still that's why he could command what that he had because it was what was in Joshua that was greater than what was in the world the creator was in Joshua he was there he was in him you take day Daniel what was in Daniel was greater than the Lions what was in Daniel meant more to him than any position he could have any place in the world so what was greater what was in Daniel than what was in the world little children you are not of this world ye are of God let me say this to you before I read the scripture before there ever was a star there ever was a moon your names were putting on the Lamb's Book of Life you were in his thinking you were part of him before there ever was a world before I read this scripture I want you to have this understanding because by this revelation you can understand how the Creator was there David greater was what was in David the courage that David had to go out and meet Goliath that courage was in greater greater was that courage in David greater was the creation that was in David greater that what was in David than that which was in the world so there was something in David in him that was greater than he who is in the world no this is what I want to share because we don't know this is just a foretaste because this is just a little wake up for us to bring this back on the track to contend with ourselves to look at ourselves to recommit ourselves to read this brother branham said to get bullets straight clear blue sky you know fire religion that just cleans it all out a menace to make sure we're not hatched out of an incubator if to make sure that we know our Redeemer I thought that song was so perfect this morning I know my redeemer lives who hung the moon who long the Stars who did this that's my brother Graham said in the message this morning the world falling apart he says who was it that put all those stars and came the Sun what's hanging it there and he said that all those stars go in their cycle helping one another out I never knew they helped one another out what he said they all work together the invisible things of God are clearly seen in the visible things around it what was in David that gave him the courage something welled up in David that he went out there I believe he was willing to take the consequences of death versus submit to that lie he would die for the fact that God was the only living God but what was it and this is what I I hope that in your own private study and as you would go read this book because brother Graham talks about being on the mountain and speaking the storm and and that talking about the squirrels he said what was it when I just spoke those squirrels what do you have need of and he spoke this world and this is what I hope to see me that we can just look to we can take a moment and look what do we see when do we look I think now's the time to look what do we see when we look you take Moses you take Joshua you take Daniel you go all down to the scriptures you take Gideon you take all of those people greater what was in them then whatever challenge was before them and I wrote it to express it this way it wasn't God working from the outside it was God working from the inside they already had something in them because their name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that seed of God was in them they overcame because he that was in them and where did that come from before there ever was a world before there ever was he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he can no more deny that than anything that's what the Antichrist spirit will never confess it would never confess that it was what was in Moses that was greater they will always teach it was God working from the outside it was God working from the outside it's God working from the outside but that's not what he said he said why Christ because it's in you Christ in you is the hope of glory you say where does my salvation come from it comes from your name being put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world for God to be just and to manifest himself he paid the redemption price that was required he did that for mercy and that this place that he meets us he meets us under that shed blood but we always look at it God working from the outside God working from the outside but it wasn't God working from the outside it was God working from the inside what he put in you from the from the beginning in the Lamb's Book of Life the word came in quickened and made that word alive what happened David was moved on by the spirit what was in him was quickened up he went out and meant that that giant not afraid he had something in him that was ready to meet that giant he knew it was real Moses knew it was real speak speak what was it Joshua speed what do you have need up speak I like Josh well that angel shows jump rope pulls the sword and maybe ready to fight for God he said who are you enemy or foe he said I'm the angel come from the presence of God praise God there was something in Joshua where did that come from that came from the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it's got to be quickened rising of the Sun quicken quickening spirit quickening power we always look out and yet the very messenger of the hour because he can only speak this to the elect he said pray to Him who is within you it was greater than that who was in them then he was in the world greater is he that is in you you've got to look past your flesh sometimes and look to what the Word of God says about you you've got to take what's in you to defeat the flesh that's outside of you you got this thing from that other guy papa gotcha were divorced from this why because something else has come alive in us we know that he that is in us is greater than he was in the world even greater than this flesh that is in the world he that is in you can overcome your flesh blessed is he that overcometh because it's given to him to sit with me on my Father's throne you're the overcomer because it's not God from the outside it's God from the inside where did that come from it comes from the foundations of the beginning of the world and he cannot deny himself he that is in you he that is in you what was wonderful if you go back to read this book you hear Oberman talks about the burden that he was under and how he went and looked and and all the burden was under and all of a sudden this burden was lifted and he realized that it was he that was in him that he was made that he was created he was predestinated little children as many false spirits but anyone that denies that he's come in the flesh is Antichrist you cannot deny your origin you can't do it there is no way that any of us deserve salvation there is nothing we've done no works that we have it's not even it's not even our work it's him in us that was put there it's not always him working from the outside because God works from the inside out in everything he does you say what is faith God works by faith without faith it's impossible to please God faith is the evidence hope for things not yet seen it's an evidence it's something that's real prophet of God said it's something that you possess is something you have it's in there faith is a gift of God lest any man should boast it's in you it was put there the word comes and quickens that brings that to life then all of a sudden you feel the mop the member has said the muscles of faith will up and he just saw that big ol alley loop and he was just a big boo he was a fake because what was in him was greater than what was in the world may I say this it's like looking for the Hat on your head where's faith where's faith where faith it's here it's in me faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God understanding quickening power comes by the word of faith come here quickening and bringing what is in you to life then he that is in you is greater than he is in the world it's not always this approach it's God working from the outside God working from the outside Oh God when are you gonna get here I'm here we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus join heirs of the kingdom we're in fellowship we're together you say me yeah you how could he choose you I don't know heartlessly but praise God I know he did right I know he did I know there was an a man in my heart when I heard this message it was amen amen I didn't know nothing I wasn't Catholic to a core I had been reading my Bible but it was through my own eyeglasses and when I heard Christianity versus paganism and I heard that same voice that spoke to my heart I knew it was him and all that can wring out of my heart was a man a man a man even when it hurt it was a man and believe me that don't come from the flesh because I have stuck-up and proud and arrogant as anybody could be you couldn't tell me nothing I know sometimes I'm still like that but you did peep reign for me I'm working on it no that had to come from someplace else do you understand it had to be in you that's all he's doing he's resurrecting this message is resurrecting the creator in you it's bringing the realization of what that he put in you is greater than what's in the world what you possess in Christ Jesus will over anything he can throw at us bugs spirits laws rules whatever that's what I've got to be anchored to faith let that word reveal Christ in us what is the book of Revelation since the revelation of Jesus Christ it's him manifesting himself in the believer through the ages manifest brother brain just said he pulled them out of he manifested himself in justification pulled him out manifest their sanctification pulled him out put the gift of the spirit pulled him out in this last day he's got a bride on this earth and these two become one he that is on the inside is greater he that is in you the he that was in you is eternal if you have eternal life you always had eternal life oh how marvelous and what thrills me about this is that God always equips his people he said in the greatest battle ever fought if God could give us a better weapon he would but when he gave us was his word his promise not our intellectual interpretation of the Bible that's not the word his word is a promise it's the promised vindicated word that's our weapon our weapon is that what he says he does and that's why if he said he put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life and nothing can tape it off and nothing can put it on we can anchor our soul and our eternal destiny on those words we can say he that is in me is greater that's the part of us that's got to step up what's inside of us the word in us the God in us has got to meet the challenge we've got to stop just crying out two four four end up to come down come down come down when you got it in you to do something about it you've got it in you to make a stand you've got it in you to claim a promise it's like waiting for the bus when you're on it no I know the first thing that goes in your mind is your flesh why do you think he's going to do away with your flesh because he knows there's something else in there that he can veil with a new body a resurrected body but the off any body and eternal body of glorious an incorruptible body unbelief don't stop God oh I can just hear Billy Graham's head these are the sickest thing I know is the body of Christ what is sickness when something's not functioning the way it should function he's saying the body's not functioning the way it should function it's not acting you understand what he said it's Christ in you it's no longer you doing it it's Christ in you doing it it's what he put in there doing it it's what he said he would do it a greater is He that is in you greater is the word that he put in you before the foundations of the world that put you here to be that bride that any being the world's God and I believe it's coming the flesh this flesh and this flesh and this flex and this pride from this flesh and this flesh in this list I believe it's coming the flesh the Antichrist says it doesn't come into play but it has so great is he that is in you it can overcome yourself your own worst enemy it can bring your flesh under subjection you got a habit you got a burden you've got a weakness you've got a record that's all spotted out the very God that's in you can overcome blessed is he that overcometh he that is in us is great in the world do you understand he's equipped us for what's ahead he's given us the revelation to match the hour that was what his complaint to the church was he says what they're teaching will not match the challenge of the hour he says they don't have anything in them to believe with but there is an elect people who possessed something that was put there before the foundation of the world that he can't deny and he has got to quicken and bring it to life and vindicated and manifested it he vindicated and manifested in the prophet of the hour by speaking squirrel's by the three poles by doing what he was doing to show that if that's the first fruit then there's fruit coming after it [Music] when do we look when do we look what do you see when you look you see a victorious bride whose names written in the land but filled with the Holy Ghost able to perform God's Word or do you see some weakling the Prophet lived that himself he went through that himself he said him finally God got so I don't know the word I was going to use the word fed up but I don't know what God felt brother Branham knew he said why cry speak you were made for this you were created for this you were the word I made you I created you I called you I put you here that's good enough he can't deny himself he can't deny himself oh if you go back and read it what he said he said they're already rapturing they've already been pulled out now there's a last work that has to be done a people that he's vindicated that greater is He that is in us that's greater than he that is in the world he's equipped us for this challenge I don't even know all that's in there but I know one thing I've studied it for 20-some 40-some 50 some years not that I'm tired of hearing it I'll never be tired of hearing it if Billy Paul showed up here this afternoon and sat down and began to tell every one of those stories I'd be so thrilled I'd sit back then I'd listen to him over and over and over and over again and the shivers would go up and down my back and I just I loved it but I want to study it anymore I want it in me I know it's in me now Lord manifested in me bring it to life in me father your word promised it I faith I have faith in your word that you can live in me Amen light that's the exit this revelation is the exit he that is in you is greater than he was in the world if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwelling you it will also quicken your mortal body are you a possessor of the Resurrection yes yes yeah I am you say I don't feel it it don't matter if you feel it he said so he puts your name on the lamb he wrote it there before the foundation of the world he that is in you is greater then he who's in the world oh if we could just get our self out of the picture it's no longer you that's doing it it's no longer you living its hey man maybe I've said enough but I'm telling you when I thought of he that is in you I thought what are you afraid of I love the way he says it what are you afraid of the world like the world's just nothing you know what I mean it's late you ever seen somebody just go hysterical over a mouse give me a break get a broom just absolutely lose it over a mouse it's like really go look in the mirror I was going to say you're 200 pounds but this the sisters are usually who's afraid of the mice oh you know you're a hundred and five pounds what are you worried about a little mouthful it's imagination vain imaginations it's the battle in your mind why because we don't look when do we look at the word when do we look when are we gonna look at the word when are we gonna look at this message where are we going to creep quit treating it like history when are we gonna quit looking at it as a finished work the message was a spoken word that was going to speak a bride into existence our messenger even said his work wasn't finished at Calvary it was to finish up in this aim what what you know what are we afraid of when are we gonna look when are we going to finally sit back and say what is this message saying what is it telling me why do we continually treat it like history when it is living living living word its Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever performing every promise he's ever spoken it's real word it's real and if he's real you're real if your names on the book and you have eternal life everything that he is you are the works that I do shall you do also I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun will come again and I will be with you even in you until the end greater is He that is in you then as in the world we talked this morning about the mental attitude of this virus and and this world system trying to rob us from the leadership of the Holy Spirit well let's don't let the virus of our flesh and the virus of our personality and the virus of our upbringing and the virus of our backgrounds rob us from the spoken promises of God that were revealed to us in this last day by the manifestation of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 30 revelations 10 seven and God Emmanuel Jesus Christ in the Ministry of the Son of Man hailing himself in the veil of a profit that a people could look past the veil and see the unveiling of God through the veil that he was veiled in and understand what he's trying to tell us you say brother David you don't know I've just got a terrible problem with lust he that is in you is greater than that problem I've got a terrible temper he that is in you is greater than that temple I'm full of jealousy I just get so jealous I can feel it in my body I can feel it I get so nervous I bit so broke down stop look away look away what do you see when you look you see the promise word standing there you see a pillar of fire telling you a pillar of fire telling you your name's on the book nothing can pluck you out of my hand if I started to work on you I will finish it I will not leave you nor forsake you my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow what do you see when you look you see yourself that's the most pathetic thing you can look at is yourself I like when brother Branham said I'm I I may be mad I didn't know if he meant mad like crazy or mad like angry I don't know how they interpreted that one but I get so mad sometimes I could just spit can you imagine if that's what I looked at I'd go home and I get me and some of those cotton lint sheets and just curl up in a ball not even go outside no more I wouldn't face it no more no but there's something on the inside little Brook why are you happy because the deer drink because the flowers grow because I'm here no he said I'm happy because there's something in me that pushes up you hate haven't you experienced it when you have done evil and you are defeated and deflated and discouraged and you're full of guilt and you're full of shame and you think everybody knows what you've done every I and the church is on you that little thump on the inside would just start thumping I want God I want to be forgiven I don't want to go I don't want to quit where can I go that alone has the words of eternal life it just starts working its way like the grass under the concrete it's going to work its way it's going to work its way why it is in you Christ in you is the hope of glory it's not you got the glory now Christ is in you know it was because Christ was seeing you well you were yet a sinner that's where the glory was he died for his own oh my hallelujah he's we've got what we need amen the world may fall apart but this Brides not gonna fall apart the world may fall apart but his elects not gonna fall apart because nothing is going to pluck them out of the palm of his hand he is going to finish this work he is going to redeem everybody whose name is on that book he's going to love them till the end he'll never forsake him he'll never leave him even the scripture says he loved his own which were in the world and he loved them until the end go back and read Saint John 17 and run around your house a few times shouting the glory of God father that may may be one as we are one I'm gonna go to that cross and I'm gonna die and I'm gonna lay my life down but I asked you for one thing that they might know the love wherein you love me oh it's time to rise up churches trying to get rid of this petty doubting this petty flesh looking this self-pity party and it's time for us to take what the prophet of God said it's time for us to look time for us to look when do we look now we need to look and what do we need to see we need to see him standing in the revealed spoken word of be our may man God richly bless you Dan I don't know what's on my screen but I got YouTube up here man you want to discourage me in a hurry just let me look at myself on YouTube I thought they might arrest me after this morning you know I didn't say it was a communist plot though did I I wanted to I mean it's crazy what people go through now they're saying it's the democrats and republicans the republicans are saying if you look every state that's got a pandemic it's a democrat state and all the democrats don't want to open up and all the republicans do work out what kind of mental bondage are people in get your head out of politics and get it back in the Bible amen for every one second you listen to one of these talk-show hosts you need about two hours a good solid message to clean that stuff out of it'll poison you there's no hope in it he brother branham said this morning there's no life in education there's no life in science there's no life in politics there's no life in a Christ the word is the life hey man I better stop god bless you you're wonderful you're the children of the Living God and I don't know what's going to happen we may not ever build a church we may not ever have any fellowship we may grow this may be all that's left but I know one thing one day we're gonna be with him amen that's Austin even I'm sure glad God didn't ask for our opinions would we wanted to be or how he wanted to make us and everything him and he did it all by himself hey man hey man I like that quote that says I obviously I can't remember everything right now he said that you look at the state that you were in and unnatural that you had to come to victory
