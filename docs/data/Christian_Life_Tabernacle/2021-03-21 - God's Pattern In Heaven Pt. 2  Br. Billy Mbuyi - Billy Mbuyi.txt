Description:
God's Pattern In Heaven Pt. 2
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Morning Service
Sunday Service: March 21,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

with us and it's good to have you in service with us today all it's good brother to be here sister rhonda sends her love and she says appreciate every one of y'all in your prayers so [Music] i'm just getting into his word i don't want to get emotional gracious heavenly father we do appreciate this time that we can gather together lord lord not in a building lord or under a roof or as a group but to gather into your word father lord to become one with thy holy spirit lord i feel so comfortable coming here with a group of believers though physically i've not i've not been here in a while lord it's the same spirit lord it's the same comforting love lord that has always been here father i what's on my mind is the you know back before the world began lord you went over the earth with your cloud lord with a mist lord at the time of noah's time lord you said you put your your promise in the midst of a cloud lord and our word to save your lord jesus went up into a cloud lord and who we are in the last days it was a cloud to us lord god we're the promised in the middle of it lord jesus lord and that's what we stand upon that revealed word in this last hour lord god that's what's in our hearts lord that's what we come to do lord is to worship you lord through that word that's where you put your name in these last days lord into that word so lord jesus i thank you lord for your goodness father lord if there's anything any sin or iniquity lord within us lord that would hinder us from entering into your presence lord we laid upon the altar of your sacrificial blood lord we ask you to receive us lord in jesus christ's name we thank you amen and praise the lord you may be seated amen we'll ask brother mike to come at this time and just feel free to remain seated until brother mike ask you to stand and if he wants you to stand right away he'll let you know or if he waits till the reading of the word but we just want to make a couple announcements while he comes um we want to meet with all those in the youth group that will be attending the easter meetings at brother tim's for the youth only or any parents that might have any questions just or anybody that's volunteered to be a chaperone or a driver we'll be meeting immediately after service and the overflow or sunday school room or big space we've been trying to think about what to call that place back there but uh just meet there in the back amen so that'll be for the youth meeting then also um brother jackson said there was a set of keys lost for a i believe a honda so i don't think you'll be going anywhere if if you don't retrieve those keys just ask one of the deacons or it should be there in the back table so amen just remember our our pastor brother david and sister leslie they're in california and so they'll be there for a couple weeks i believe returning maybe midweek so just remember them and so we just asked brother mike to come at this time for our psalm reading good morning in uh first samuel 8 verse 5 there's the story of when the elders of israel for speaking to the prophet samuel they want a king and they say this behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways notice they never said anything about god's ways they pointed to a man's ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations they wanted a man to judge over them why you would ever want to commit your judgment to another man rather than to the righteous judge is beyond me but it's a perfect example of man's image of a king some royal powerful mighty man to reign over them to judge them to tell them what to do you know god never really intended man to rule over man this is something man put into place and it's always ended with bloodshed with violence with corruption first samuel 8 verse 7 we see god's response to this request the way that he felt about this desire he said they have rejected me that i should not reign over them and that's the bottom line when man sets a king to rule over himself he's making that statement that he'd rather man than god rule over him someone else between me and that relationship they've even done that in the church by creating a vicar a pope to rule over them you know god has a different view of kingship we might be familiar with the scripture where john is speaking in revelation revelation 1 verse 5 he says and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father in chapter 5 verse 10 the 4 and 20 elders started singing a new song and they make this statement again and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth notice how he says he's made us kings unto him you know this isn't rulership over man this isn't man's idea of a king but this is the positional placing by god of his people into a place of dominion you know that's what a king is it's someone who has dominion where things are under his control you know and we know that's the original image of man when god created him in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let him have dominion not over man but over earth starting with this earth you know but this isn't the man-made placing it says that he has made us it is he had that hath made us and not we ourselves [Music] we're going to read psalm 21 this morning if you want to go ahead and stand you know psalm 21 is the witness it's a testimony of a god-placed king and notice some of the things that this god-placed king says in his testimony starting in verse one it says the king shall join thy strength in thy strength o lord and then thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice in verse two thou has given him his heart's desire and has not withholden the request of his lips are there any kings in here that can say amen to that has there been one time where he has withholden the request of your lips does this testimony sound familiar this is what dominion looks like for god placed kings in verse 3 thou prevented him with the blessings of goodness he said he has basically overwhelmed us with blessings to the point where we can hardly bear them verse 4 he asked life of thee the king asked life of him and thou gavest at him even length of days forever and ever everlasting life do you see yourself in the vision the placing of kings on the earth but you know you reach as we read chapter 21 this morning and all the blessings of this king notice that this king only had to do two things none of this was the result of his action except for two the first in verse three he asked life of thee and thou gave it he asked for life and he was given eternal life everlasting life and in verse 7 the king trusteth in the lord that's it that's what made this king a god-placed king everything else in his dominion is the work of the lord in fact the very last verse of chapter 21 it says this be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power so as we'll read in psalm 23 it's the picture of god placing all things under the feet of this king and as a result of that that king becomes the reflection of his strength in his dominion so as we read psalm 21 together put yourself in the vision put yourself in the scripture as god placed kings who have been given dominion over earth let's read that together in psalm 21 the king shall joy and thy strength o lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice thou has given him his heart's desire and has not the request of his lips selah for thou prevented him with the blessings of goodness thou satist a crown of pure gold on his head he asked life of thee and thou gavest at him even length of days forever and ever his glory is great in thy salvation honor and majesty has thou laid upon him for thou hast made him most blessed forever thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance for the king trusteth in the lord and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anchor the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to perform therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power amen r amen praise the lord you may have your seats key of g i just came to glorify amen well i just came to glorify [Music] glorify your name oh and i just came to glorify glorify your name for there's no

david texted me and he said that he just wanted me to let you know that he's doing fine and the their mom is doing okay and uh certainly uh uh thankful for that amen amen let's turn our bibles in genesis chapter one says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth it says and we let's drop off to verse 26 chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make men in our image in our likeness let us let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air over the cattle of the of of the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in an image of god created he him male and few and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth and subdue and subdue it have dominion over the fish and over the sea of the sea and over the files of the air and over every living thing that move it upon the amen let's also turn in exodus chapter 25 we're gonna start let's read from one through a nine it says then the lord speak unto moses saying speak speak unto the children of israel that you bring me an offering of every man that give that giveth he that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my he shall take my take my offering and in and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and rem skin dried red and badgers badger skin and shatim wood oil with oil for the for the light spices for anointing for anointing oil and for sweet incense onyx stones and and the stones to be set in the e-pod and for the breastplate and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them and i want you to remember that at a sanctuary that arabic trail among them according to all that i have shown thee after the pattern after the time after the pattern after the pattern of the tabernacle the pattern of all instruments thereof even so shall we make it man god bless this word you may have your seats this morning man want to continue on the same thought line that we talked about last sunday i believe on god's pattern in heaven god's pattern in heaven when we look at the word pattern i was looking at it this weekend is it speaks of it's a obviously there's a lot definition i thought this was almost in line with what we have in our heart it speaks about a regular way in which something happened or the way something is done is a regular arrangement of line shape colors etc for example as a design of material carpet or something a pattern is something that happens or appear in a regular or repeated way so it's something that that established something that you can follow it happens in the regular or repeated way a pattern exists a pattern exists in variable form they could be found in mathematicals and arts and everything so as we read this what we just want to bring to the attention so the when you it's set up in a way that it could be repeated so it carries a message within the pattern there's a message there's something that could be placed in a way that somebody can look at it as an example and follow and and it's there so that it allows that something could be traced that something could be reconstructed that something could be looked at and put back together by knowing the pattern behind it and we said that in everything there's a pattern we see patterns in everything that we look around us and and in god's words we see that there's a pattern uh we read in genesis chapter one even as we read the scripture says uh in the beginning god the spirit of god was moving upon the face of the earth and brother branham talks about how that god came and he was the the the great uh spirit it was the fountain of love in the beginning and he was the one who filled all time in space he didn't have a place that could contain him it's it's like i said last time it's beyond our own imagination or understanding to think when we because every time we try to think we think in terms of the world we think we try but to think that before even the world was that there was somebody and the world came out of him it becomes a challenge for us to even put that together so he came and he says it was this great fountain of love who filled all time in space and he was this fountain of many colors and that's what it was and and within him he decided that he wanted to do something he decided that he wanted to create he decided that he wanted to bring out something and the first phone that we know that's spoken of in the bible is he became the logos and but branham says that one place says the sun at the footstep door of the father the logos we know that to be the word so he comes and he takes a certain form and from that form he creates everything from that form the creation is made and and i i want to get back to this to say that in this form as god is creating the purpose is for him to reflect himself the the purpose of the earth was not so the earth could be something that looked nice that we could look at and enjoy it and everything but random says this it said when a man builds a house is for him to dwell in it so when god created his creation when he puts it together when he put the heavens when he put the earth it was for the sole purpose that we could look everywhere and see god we could look in nature and see god we could look around and see the mountains and see the animal kingdom look at the fish and look at the sea and look at all of that and in everything we need to look be ha have the ability to see god reflected in it that's what his desire and i'll say this just the same way he wanted to reflect himself in the world god wanted to reflect to himself in our flesh because remember the same thing that the same way verbatim tells us that he deals with the earth he's the same way that he deals with man if if the creation of the world was to be a reflection of god the creation of man was to be the ultimate creation of the reflection of god in fact it created him to have dominion he created him to be a god on earth and one that god can look and see himself through and and we are told that even as he was naming the animal he'll come and call him this is a lion and this is a lamb and he named him according to the nature and everything god will come and approve of it and say this is exactly what i was looking for so he came from the mind he came from this uh heaven that we talked about it's not the sky per se but this mind that constructed everything and he wanted to display it in the world so so we find out as we said the earth and the creation was being made to match something that god wanted to achieve and and and we we we talks and he says uh he began to speak uh about the things around us he says now um these he speaks about the creation and he speaks about um the the the very dimension that exists and the reason for the dimension that we live in today and it says now uh uh these things it says these people here in this channel so he's speaking about uh here we are if we say just to lay it out down before i move on uh this dimension that we live in is the dimension of manifestation uh we it's the realm of manifestation if i may say and there's a spirit rhyme on both sides that is pressing to be manifested in this realm and we understand that and we see that we we identify spirits by the way they manifest themselves or we understand even ourselves we are not just this flesh we are the human or the spirit that dwells within the flesh uh this flesh is just a means by which we can manifest or that we can uh come and show what is it that the spirit that's behind this flesh is so he comes and he speaks about the dimension it says there's dimension up and there's dimension down and that's what i'll pick up and it says now this people here in these channels is influenced from two sides from two different sides it said now this this one side going up uh this way and here's the trinity and this side going out the the the away it's a trinity it says now now the first place on this side is the soul of the anja's and he's speaking about the dimension below so this is the dimension of manifestation if it drops down below is the soul of the unjust it says when a man die he goes into a place waiting for judgment jesus went to preach to the souls that were in prison there next is the demon so behind the unjust right below the unjust justice the demon he says the next is is devil is is the devil and hell going up it says first he says now then there is there is a ghost the spirit of the dead that never repented it says they are waiting for the judgment and the only thing they know is frolic and what they and what they did he says now now he says now up here there's a christian uh there are these christians are influenced from above it says this is the parable up here in another ghost is the holy ghost the ghost of a man it says jesus says the holy ghost the holy ghost influences his church this rhyme of the mortal so the holy ghost is here to influence the realm of the mortal and then it says the devil and these spirits influence man it says now look the next is the angel and the next is god it says now here is here now here every model here is influenced by one of this world see what i mean so now he's speaking to us to see uh even as i'm getting back here these these spirits so this realm are pressing into in order for them to manifest themselves in order for for what they are to be shown on the other side in order for them to display themselves on the other hand in order for or for what they want to achieve and and and and and where they want to take you and what they want you to display and there's no such thing as just me doing it myself and that's why even as a human we have to be aware that there's a power influencing every single one of us to do the things we do you know if i do right there's a power behind me uh moving me to do right and if i do wrong there's a spirit behind that's trying to cause you to do wrong they all dare to press in order to create a reflection to be seen in this realm and then the prophet also speaks how you know in who's this melchizedek so now this is now we're talking about the kingdom of god pressing and trying to reflect himself in this realm now he speaks about how this melchizedek was talking about it was this great spirit how that became this great fountain of love that we talked about he came and he moved into a form of logos and the final goal he says he was always wanting to move towards flesh but he said when he came when he came to abraham it was it was that same logos or that same theophany it was not yet the flesh of jesus because the flesh of jesus was not yet born but yet it was the same god who came and he manifested himself and him says he took he just took off the uh 16 element he took off the earth and he just blew into it and he used the body to come down why it was the same god that came and manifested and the scripture says that abraham looked at him and called him god and that becomes very important because that same manifestation happens here at the end time when we look at him we can't call him anything different we can look at a man turn his back and reproduce the same words and we can look at him and say we have seen god you know i i i come to a place that it's very important we begin to realize regardless of our own limitation let's not limit the word of god regardless of our own lack of understanding or lack of revelation let the word say what the word says and let the word prove itself and let god come to you and give you the revelation that you need in order for you to move upwards because yes where we are we can see god in creation and we thank him for it we rejoice over it we can talk about the great fountain of love and and see what he did in the beginning we can go back and look at jesus christ and see that the fullness of god dwelled in that man and we knew it was the main jesus and god dwelled in him for the purpose of revealing himself you know there was no man like he was and god took the body and glorify it oh but in this end time it's not so much the flesh of jesus christ we have to go right back into that theophany that word that was in the beginning that came back and it's manifesting himself again here [Music] and i want to say this it's very important we realize it's the same god why because we we can't say that god was in the heaven god was the fountain of love it was in christ and come back to ourselves and begin to doubt about that same god dwelling in you somewhat it becomes a watered-down person that's not strong enough that's not good enough that cannot achieve anything no it's the same god it's the same attribute it's the same power and it's in you to accomplish what he predestinated you in that flesh to do he didn't call us in this flesh to die on the cross he didn't call us on this flesh to to to to perhaps give our lives like he did on the other the purpose of christ coming is because it was the sacrificial lamb he gave his life it was the only sinless that there was but the purpose that he did that was so he can clean the human race so he can clean a group of people and like in a group of people that he himself not another god he himself can come and dwell in them so it becomes very important that we look at what the word said what in that mind what was the purpose behind what was spoken because remember that's the reflection that we have that's the only thing we want to reflect because remember we read it last time as he said as he came to job and he looked at him and says i it says yeah you are and it's just things that are happening to you and you're lamenting and finding out oh you know i cursed the day that i was born and and he spoke so many things and and how and the scripture says that god came to him in the form of whirlwind he steps out and he began to look at him he says now i want you to i want to ask you where were you when the sons of god when i lay the foundation of the earth when those sons of god rejoice and shouted for joy where were you at that time why because if you can answer that question then you can know that in god's mind it was all settled [Applause] why because if you can answer that question what were you exactly what part were you playing in this what part when you were rejoicing when you were there i saw you there you were already there so everything that's happening here nothing will change that because remember it's the word of god he already spoken it and nothing can change it so he comes in and he begins to speak he he says let us make man in our image and i want to say this this was a perfect plan let us make man in our image and he made the man in the image it was a spirit man that he made we understand that because it was the spirit that moved upon the face of the earth so he came and he made a spirit man and and and because he he wanted some reflection he created the spirit man who was in his own reflection and he didn't stop there the scripture says that there was no man to till the earth god takes that spirit man and dwells it into the flesh so he can contact the earth earth for contacting the earth and then the spirit to contact in god and and and and yet we are we we look at ourselves oftentimes we saw concern about the flesh then we are the spirit and yet we are we take care of this ten cents person we we worry so much more about him than we worry about the soul and the spirit that was created in the image of god yet we are because remember it it's the reflection of god and the flesh is not the reflection of god in fact the flesh is a curse that that came by the way when men sin and and it caused him to sin this flesh can never be redeemed the scripture says that if this body of flesh be dissolved we have another one already waiting now it didn't say when you die then the body will be made no it's already waiting in fact what branham says when you heard this message you heard from your theophany you heard from that other flesh just calling it calling come up i i it says it's like a baby being born it says that you when when you have need of something when the flesh needs something he has to send a signal something has to be sent to this flesh so we can be prepared to fit into that body my brother my sister we can say just like jesus said i come from god i go back to god there's no difference at all why because that body was already made [Applause] i got to prepare you a place so that where i am that you may be also why it's the mind that created all things and not mind is a perfect mind so he comes and we look at him and we see him in this realm of manifestation and he comes and is reflected and manifest in this reign of mortal the holy spirit the holy ghost influencing his church in this realm of motto it says and the devil by his spirit influencing man also i began to think about jesus as he was tempted the scripture tells us that he came in 40 days and went through the wilderness and he began to be tempted and the same devil came now i want you to know years jesus is laying out a pattern for all the believers because remember barumanam says that he was the most gifted man that there is but yet he never used his gift to cast out the devil he never used his gift in order for him to cast him out he says he use what the word now i want you to what is the word he's basically reporting back to the perfect mind of god that can never be changed what is the word it's that creative power that made all things to come into existence it's that form that place that god gave god when he began to create all things so he comes and he began to be tempted and now he says to him why don't you do this it's written this and this and this jesus tells him it is also written and i was just thinking about that it's written it's written what does that really mean it means jesus was quoting something that had the authority something that was that had the final say that even the devil knew that could not be changed when you say it's written you say there's a decree it's there's something that's in stone there's something that cannot be moved there's something that's already uttered and cannot be taken back when you say it's written you're showing that this is the final say of god and it cannot be taken away and that's what jesus overcame by and he overcame by it because he knew that he would have his brothers and sisters come behind him that would overcome by the same word so i want to say to us tonight this morning unless we establish a pattern unless we get into the pattern that god's established for us to get back into eden we're not going to be able to make it we cannot as we read here god didn't ask moses and say go build yourself a temple make it as nice looking as possible and then i'll come and dwell in it but you know what that's what all the churches have done they've constructed themselves a temple they've constructed themselves arcs and they've constructed themselves all kinds of things our pastor preached on one man denomination what is it it's man bringing his own interpretation and thinking that god will meet him in in his interpretation no god interprets his word by bringing it to pass and the word of god comes to the prophets so by by by not taking the word of god and following it at the letter doing exactly what he said god cannot dwell in that temple so it was only after moses followed everything that was given to him built it according to the speck and the colors and everything that god gave him that's when the glory of god came down and dwell in that temple and so it is with us unless we can follow we can repent from our sins and be baptized and and repent of everything and sanctify that's when the holy ghost will come into the temple amen the scripture says we read this last time he says ye are a chosen generation ye are a chosen generation a royal priest priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into the marvelous light in that yes the scripture is telling us the pattern that by which we should walk it says you are chosen people you're not like just anybody out there israel was hand picked to people god verbatim calls about talks about the calling of abraham it says abraham signify election there was nothing that abraham did in order for god to choose him there was nothing that god abraham did for god to love him and everything it was all god trying to achieve something it was all god trying to reflect himself in the world it was a god trying to build himself a nation and he picked a man by which he will build that nation he called him out and out of his country and he he bring him to a place and and and he he gave him a son and and we we understand that the promised son was jesus christ and i will come and he will uh uh uh this one will be the natural sun by isaac that will build the nation of israel but yet there was another spiritual son that was to come and save the world so all of that was god's doing and he had nothing to do with abraham all that abraham was to do was to walk in the pattern in the world that was laid before him it said father it took him and he took him from his own country he followed wherever he took him and followed whatever god wanted him to do he did even after he done wrong god was able to bring him back why because god said that the son was going to come by abraham and sarah so god preserved them until the sun came so is it with us today we have to be mindful that we are not made to be like the world we are not because i say this because you know i i understand we are in the flesh and we were but we have to understand the reason that we are in the flesh is for the purpose of manifestation because this is the realm of manifestation but we are so easily taken up into the things of the world we are so almighty so easily because remember the devil what he wants is he wants you to stay away to keep you away from you manifesting god to this generation he wants you to keep you away from the purpose which you were put here and in doing so we realized that we find ourselves always carried into the things of the world and failing to achieve the things which we were called to do we find ourselves in the fashions of the world in the games the entertainment of the world and it's not calling us necessarily uh to go out and to do uh insanely sinful stuff but what he wants us to do is to keep our mind occupied with the things of the world engage into the things of the world that we fail to realize that i am here to reflect something and i want to say this god cannot be marked your life reflects who you are [Applause] the the way we connect ourselves the way we do things how we we we we live our lives every day it reflects something it reflects who you are who or you are influenced by one or the other kingdom and i want to say this the influence it depends on who you give yourself to you can be a christian but if you are not given to god the devil can influence you the devil can cause you to do things you don't want to do it can cause you to think things you don't want to do it can cause you to go in directions you want to want to go that's why we are called to hold on to the pattern find out what he said that we need to do and get to do it you know i'll say this i was uh uh just thinking you know there's often because of where i was born and how i was brought you know there comes days where you know i just woke up and and and in my heart i just feel like eating fufu it's just i can eat all the mashed potatoes and all the tacos and all the pasta and all that i could do but these days where i woke up it's just in me to eat it i just want to eat it because i feel satisfaction when i eat it and there's nothing that can replace it i can eat all the things i want to eat and it won't satisfy so is it with somebody who came from the pattern of god somebody who came from this mind you can feed him all the trash of the world that you want that will never satisfy why because that that thirst that that hunger is for specifically the word of god something that comes from that wrath in order for him to manifest it down here well how do we hear from our theophany it's the word in other words it's time for you to come up and it's time for you to get activated also the the triophane says this is the time oh and god comes and he knows this is the program i'm gonna meet him at that junction i'm going to meet him at that corner and you get activated and your heart starts on hungering for things that the world cannot give you and we need to feed that hunger we need to feed that hunger so we can gain strength well brandon picks it up he says speaking about god talking to job and he speaks about this old colored man he said the first i seen somebody with the holy ghost was an old colored man with a big long overcoat on they had to help him out he was so old like this and and he got up there and began to preach he says a lot of them preachers begin to preach about oh what it takes place here on earth he took the text back in job and he says where were you when i laid the foundation of the world and this is where my inspiration came from it says when the morning starts sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy he said you think you got some kind of new kind of religion said brother i just got the old times taste it says a brand new a brand new case of old time religious religion oh i tell you that's what we need we don't need something new to get us excited oh we just need that old one let it sprinkle with the spirit let the spirit reveal it to you and you will bring up the holy ghost and it says it says i just got this i said the brand new case of the old time religion and then after a while it says after a while the holy ghost got hold of him he says poor old fellow was so stiff he was standing there and he stretched himself up and kicked his heel together and said glory hallelujah said you ain't got enough space here for me to preach and walked off the platform that's what the gospel will do to you that's when you read your bible you begin to pray you just feel like this flesh cannot contain you anymore you just feel like you're about to burst then you just feel like i can't take it anymore why because it's the it's that inner man calling for the offering to come on a manifestation he said i said brother if it's god if if he'll do that for a man 80 years old what will it do to for me it says i want it and i want to ask this morning is that the kind of gospel we want is that the kind of god we want we don't want to be all stiffed up but random talks about the church condition just be all starchy and and people coming you know dressed up and you know when they sing the gospel they just put the nose up in the air and just wait you know move their head a little bit you know just you know bring it on and you know just introing and and and you know just as you know stiff as could be and everything oh no i want something that will just get me going i want something i can praise my god for oh i tell you when they sing the songs i'm not looking at the song leader i'm thinking about where god got me i'm thinking about the opportunity i've been given to sit in the congregation of saints realizing that i'm not i'm not worthy of it all at all realizing that he saved me he gave me the opportunity to praise him and i want all the world to know that he's a wonderful god [Music] it says i want to say this it's important we realize we're going somewhere and if you've lived long enough on the earth you don't need to live many years you know that there was some now with us that went by the graveside you know that some not worth with us they were no longer with us you see the evolution you know that man is given a certain number of years to live you know that one day the end is coming whether it be by rapture or by natural death the end is coming and and and believe his heart desire is to be at the place where i know i've been walking on the right pattern i don't want to be caught outside i don't want to be caught doing something that god didn't call me to do i don't want to be called outside be caught outside of the the provision that is given i want to make sure when my time comes that i'm doing exactly what he called me to do that i'm walking according to the pattern that he's given me that i'm obeying and walking according to the word the prodigal son was taught right he was giving all the right instructions but he decided to go taste something else but madame speaks about how the parent's heart was broken how they would hear him out and he would say what i want to say he got with the wrong crowd they gave him the wrong kind of instruction he came and he said father i want you to give me all that mine i want you to give me all my man because everybo it says all my friends this is what they're doing this is what they are into you know a new app comes in oh this is what everybody's going you know a new something comes up oh this is the new fashion you know this comes up oh this is what everybody's doing following the mass always trying to appease something always trying to make sure that i don't look like i'm left behind i want everybody to make sure that i'm i look cool just like everybody that's what he did he didn't want his friends to know or he didn't want them to know that he stood for something that he didn't want them to he didn't want to feel ashamed to get to a place where i said i have good parents at home they give me everything i i have i don't need to come with you he followed and we know the scripture says that he took him to a far country someplace with no destination seems like the destination and we know that destination is hell but it's like it seems like it's always it's a far place away from where you're supposed to be but the scripture says one day he came back to himself one day that theophany came calling one day because he was already in the mind to begin with because the scripture says every day the father will come and wait for him in the father's mind the son is never left in the father's mind the picture of the son was always there in the father's mind his room was always prepared in the father's mind they didn't take away everything they always laid everything they knew he would come back oh i tell you in the minds of god if we can understand that our sons and the loved ones that we have in the world i tell you in the perfect god mind of god we need to be like god we are called to be like god and know that his god is not going too far why is god i haven't given to god and there's no way he can go too far he can go as much as he wants but i know one day he'll come back why because that's exactly that was in the father's mind so the prophet speaks he said he speaks about the very image of christ in the laodicean church age i want you to listen to this it says now we find out that it puts some it puts a man right back in the place the people today the bible says over here in the scripture written down here i'd like to refer to it jesus said in the third chapter of revelation he says the audience church age it says that in the last age it says we always believe that we are living in the end time and this is the last age now compare this age with he compares this age with a rich young ruler compare them it says now didn't jesus say laodicean church was rich increased with good and need of nothing the congregation said amen he says isn't that the condition of the church today and yet christ is unfolded himself through three church ages through luther through wesley and through pentecostal age unfolded himself he says his word of justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the restoration of gift and now his own personal identity among them now think about that his own personal identity among them and he says and see trying you reach young rulers business chicago see this this morning it continues on and he says laodicean we find out that all of all the other churches jesus was still in the church but in the laodicean church age he was outside now i want to say this and i think we read it all the time i i just read it this morning it just my mind kind of just woke up the devil is trying to keep jesus out of your life by all means possible if it's by providing by by way of technology by way of science by way of education he doesn't want a believer to rely on faith like we heard a couple a couple of months ago he doesn't want faith to have to do with anything he wants us to rely on this civilization and everything that they have to offer outside he doesn't want you to ever consider god in your mind when you're sick he wants to provide the medicine he wants to provide hospital you like a job the government will help you out he never wants you to go down on your knees and say god i need your help he's trying to keep and and and if he cannot get you there he's trying to keep you look warm the kind of believer oh you know that believes that that says they believe everything but there really never seeks for any of them i i believe god is the savior i believe god is a healer but you know i'll rely on my medicine and everything and no no problem with that because the prophet tells us to take it if it doesn't work then we go to god but to get you in a situation where you never actually depend on god to get you to a situation where you mix it up so much that it doesn't make any difference he says but only allowed to see in church age he was outside knocking trying to get in and in this age it says and in this age that when the manifestation of christ so perfect in the image of christ in his church until the church and as the brother said a while ago is closing the door and yet stand with love knocking if any men hunger and thirst it says but when i'm knocked it says do you understand the congregation say amen they said you expect you you expect a closed door it's loud you see in church age but the bible said he will be that way and we find out in the message identity of christ we find out two classes of people and that goes along and all and it says on one side is a fundamentalist the other is the pentecostal now the the pentecostal got something but they don't know who they are and the fundamentalists you know something but you ain't got nothing with it it says so now there it's just like a man has got money in the bank and can write to check the other can't write a check the either can write a check but it's got no money in the bank if you could ever get them together it would be a great thing listen he said but now in the face of this way we're trying to carry out the meeting is for you it says you as an individual for your need in christ salvation the healing the divine healing whatever you have need of whatever you have enough is to it says by faith know that you are in the presence of christ by faith you reach and get and get you reach and get it it says that's the only way we'll ever get it by faith we are saved by faith we are healed nothing that god can come down and do again he's already done it he says so you see the whole thing is god becoming tangible the whole thing is god becoming tangible the whole thing about us the whole thing about the reflection is so that god can become somewhat tangible we it would do us no good to come and preach the gospel and and talk about a wonderful god and all that he could do if we there's no way by which we can touch him if there's no way by which he can express himself if there's no way by which it can come and touch one another that's why it's important that we we we we reflect god for one another we we gather here as licks of fires put together we gather here as people that have brought something within the heart that they can come and put together and build a big fire [Music] we're not gathered here as sinners that just came and they all want to be saved and they all want to be safe they save the sunday they go back sinners they come back next sunday to be saved that's not the economy of god the economy of god is he's looking for people to reflect something to reflect the works that he's done for them to reflect his goodness to reflect his grace to reflect his love he continues on it says it says and on that great day that's come that's to come when christ sits upon the throne of david and reign in the millennium it's god tangible in the earth it says he is now in you you are his and and and you've got eternal life your life your your life always was and and and you was god's thinking the color of your air whatever you are you you was you was god you was in god's thinking and you were you you were just materialized and then he says that's what god was when he was in the materialized in when he materialized in christ god displayed manifested in flesh in flesh in christ he became material god that was that we couldn't that we could touch first timothy 3 and 16 it says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness that god was manifested in flesh he says it was god being made manifest god being manifested getting ready in the message continues on i believe same message he says then see god came down and the characteristics of god was christ he was the reflection he was god made visible notice god made visible in the beginning was the word it wasn't even god then god is is an object of worship one thing it says he was he was the eternal and in him was the attribute uh in him was the attribute and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to the word and the word was made manifest he said what is it it's all god becoming tangible you are part of god and jesus came to redeem those that were put that whose name was put on the land books of life before the foundation of the world it was in god's thought and and and what he what he came down to redeem and as soon as he strikes them they see it because the life is in there we've been stricken why because life is in there we see it because life is in there we see it because there's something that he placed in there and then i say if something is in there then the desire of that person is to reflect heaven it's not to reflect earth we don't want to just be caught up within this flesh there's a heaven to be reflected you know the scripture tells us in the end time it says that the the this is satan's eden but talks about how hell is on earth how that it's a reflection of the devil and and he says about even what he saw about the woman painted and all those things he looked at it he thought he was in hell but at the same time he lets us know that heaven is on earth why because there is a people here to reflect heaven [Applause] there has to be god is never left without a witness somebody is going to believe his word somebody is going to manifest it somebody will take him at his word somebody will believe it and carry the seed and manifest it we can't be left on our own devices he has placed us here to be a reflection of heaven amen he says now remember in things that are to be he says now remember the bible says if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved if we perish be dissolved we have one already waiting now he walks through the process of birth of a little baby he says just as a little baby it's it's a it's it's a little muscle in the mother and twisting and turning it says and you notice you can take a woman if she's ever so foul he says but when she's becoming a mother the little he says just a little while before the baby is born there's a kindness about that woman but about the woman he says get around her there's always something she's more tender why there's a little angel spirit waiting to receive the natural body just as soon as the body is born the breath of life comes into it it says god's breath is in there and it becomes a living soul now just this baby just as this baby is being born then the spiritual body is there to receive it it says and now when this body drops here in the earth like the little baby is dropped also there is an immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into it again it says oh what a great thing we are now in christ jesus amen babies babies in christ children of god waiting to be fully delivered waiting for the full deliverance sorry and the coming out of the lord jesus to receive up to receive us up unto himself when the body the mortal will take on immortality but when they there is a great file this it talks about the great file it says god has a foul of you in heaven and this is before you could be even manifested here on earth he has this foul of you in it on in in heaven and what you are to him is the manifestation of the file back here on earth and no doubt we go through our trouble and we try to figure it out and all those things and everything and god is just waiting he knows the day he knows the time when not when when when you when you come to a place where the birth hits you directly on communication right back home and you're talking back to that image of you that file of you that he had while you get back sync you sink back home you connect right back home to where you were or what you were supposed to be why because then on god can deposit of his own he can take you and bring your true sanctification to justification the baptism the holy holy spirit and bring you all the way up into adoption why because now he can say like he said to adam he says that's right that's right and we sent him do it in jesus christ the way he can look at you and say that's right i tell you this word is where we are bringing into it's where we are walking into if we can walk into that reflection if we can only follow what's being said if we can only follow the pattern that is laid it will lead us right back home like the little the the young man who was lost who had amnesia the young boy he came and he didn't know his home they looked at him he couldn't remember his name or anything oh i tell you we have amnesia here on earth we have that amnesia troubling us and then he just they saw him just move around and and the people wanted to stop him he said no just leave him let's watch what he doesn't and that's just because he stumbled into a train and he began to go in the train they're just watching him and says what is he gonna do oh my god where is he going he says no just watch him and he watch him and he goes and he goes and they see him stop at a certain place and and just get out of the train and they stop him and and he looked like just glimpse of things they they don't even know what he was doing it was making sense to him or not and he just looked and he lifted up his eyes and saw the water tower oh he began to walk and and going directly straight home why something was within him even after he lost his mind something was within him calling him home you can never forget home oh i tell you the same thing with believers this morning there's something within you that's calling home that wants to go home i want to go home i'm tired of this world and i don't like what i see in this world that this world is not my home i want to go home and because you desire that god is obligated to take you home the issue is we don't call home we don't need home we we rejoice in the things that we see we okay with the world the way it is but oh if we can hunger and trust the scripture says happy are those those that hunger and thirst that will be filled there's a promise for that says after in this who's this melchizedek then after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other things it says you have been formed into a living image of the living god we are being formed into the living image i'm not talking to your flesh this morning i know you think we're crazy by hearing this thing that's all right sometimes i think we're crazy too but i'm talking to your spirit i'm talking to the person inside of you it's the living think about it you didn't get here by your own efforts you didn't work yourself up to be what you are right now in fact you didn't even choose by what parent you will come what country you will be born you chose nothing oh i tell you but if this morning we can come barbara says with the desire within our heart to see that manifestation it will come to pass why because if in the natural we didn't choose and this happened because that's the way god wanted it how much more when he places something within our hearts that's desiring to see those things the scripture says he will come to pass [Music] into the image of the living god he said you heard from your theophany if this earthly be dissolved we have one waiting right you said is that right brother branham he says all right let's take a couple of uh he talks about a couple of eagles he talks about moses and then he talks he talks about moses on if the musician could come this morning i want to say this this word of god and this message that we have received it just didn't tell us about the beginning we could take that quote and they'd all call it men and what i'm talking about he talks all right back into the beginning and he's just not telling us about the situation here but i also want you to remember that he went beyond the curtain of curtin of time and told us what was in the future he told us what was in the future people that he preached this message too we're already there waiting people that heard the things that we are hearing this morning they're already on the other side oh my brother that's the kind of pattern i want to follow i don't want somebody to try some new stuff on me uh-uh it's not working i don't want any other gospel i want something that's confirmed that's talking about where i come from it's talking about today and it's already talking about the future and explaining about the people i'm not talking about people in other generations i'm not talking about oh he saw moses he saw abraham no people that believed this word of god the seventh angel word of god the reveal one of this hour that's what i'm talking about those people were already there i'm telling you let's skip the pattern let's skip the word let's keep walking let's keep believing it there's no chance you're going to go somewhere else if you believe this oh but if you let men well bring your own understanding and explain it away for you you're probably going to end up somewhere but if you believe it like the prophet said it you will be there [Music] why it's a pattern it shows where something is getting it's showing the formula to get there and this formula has been proven it to be true just like jesus he took the inoculation of himself he came and he resurrected to show to the brothers that if you believe this if you take this you will be resurrected in the last day and here we are at the last day the scripture says if this body be dissolved we have another one waiting in as a matter of fact it says in christ he says you are you're not gonna die the second death that in christ you already resurrected your death is already in christ now he doesn't even stop there now he's telling you he saw you there oh my he saw the people that believed this word already there i'm telling you brother we are on the right track don't let anybody they can talk about the cloud they can talk about the breeds they can talk about all they want i know for a fact that this will get us over there amen god bless you let's stand this morning he says in question and answer he says [Music] many of you women i said this last time he says he doesn't know when you are going to cut a piece of good you lay a good you you lay the goods out there and lay a pattern on the top of it on on this like this and you cut out goods just according to the pattern is that right it says the rest of the good is just the same as the goods but it's just a pattern it's just what god chose it says is that right but this is like the kind this is the kind that you take you might lay the other way far away to use but the goods is just cut off he says now who placed the pattern god by election [Music] who placed the pattern wouldn't come here and say stood up at the door said you are elected you come in you come in who got everybody here phone number and invited them to church this morning who put people from all the all over the world and brought them this morning just brought them from whatever country we're from and put us here this morning and say we're going to have church this morning who put the pattern this is not man's doing this is not what david's doing this is god's doing and we have to be able to see the pattern when you see the pattern you understand god is behind it if you fail to see the pattern what guess what you
