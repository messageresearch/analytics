bless each one in jesus precious wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles let's just turn to a scripture found in saint john and we'll just read in the first chapter of saint john and just read that wonderful portion of scripture there the gospel of saint john the first chapter it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not amen our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray tonight amen amen god bless you you know there's it's um it's uh certainly a time where you're always looking for new ways to figure out how to do things you know and everybody's coming out with different ideas and things i went out to see my mother and and you know as you know as you know my mom's 98 years old and and uh you know she's uh her arms she don't lift her arms as high as she did so i had to rebuild her closet and lower her clothes rack down and now she can't go down steps with just by herself so i built a little rail so she could hold on to and now the steps are getting too tall so i'm gonna have to go divide all the steps in half you know but as as she has a need there's you know you come up with ways to uh meet that need and uh and it wasn't until the the need was there that you even looked for a reason to uh to go further and do something and you know i i saw an article the other day that said out is the new in and it caught my eye so i thought well i'll read this article and it was talking about how everybody's eating outside now and so you can't eat inside but you eat outside and so now out's the new inn and i thought now that's about getting as confusing as it it can be you know and and so you come up with things and and and that's sort of what i'm kind of going through in a lot of ways here at church is trying to figure out ways to come up with things to meet all the different challenges and all the different ideas and opinions that are coming up and and the the sunday school children have been on my heart and uh um i i go have coffee uh sometimes in the morning i go to mcdonald's and uh and sit down and and meet with a bunch of old guys you know that all have their own ideas how the world should run and every now and then we get to just say a few things about the gospel you know and and talk about the gospel and we enjoy that and there it uh mcdonald's they have the back room blocked off and they don't let anybody go in there but every time i'm there there's a young boy there and he's the son of one of the workers and he's there back there on his computer trying to go to school and she'll wait on the customers and then come running in and help him with his problems and everything and and you know my heart began to break because that's where that kid spends his day you know and i know his mother's trying to do all that she can to you know raise her him and her family i don't know her her status in life maybe she's a single mother maybe she's a working mother and everything but you know and i just got thinking about our young people and and so we wanted to do something for them and so what we wanted to do was we can't have sunday school here anymore we don't have the spacing we don't have the room but so what i wanted to do was maybe take a saturday morning maybe once a month or every three weeks or whatever and just have the kids that can come and want to come a saturday morning that we can come and they we can get together and we could have a little bible school lesson and and then have maybe some activities and have a little a fellowship or food and i i watch how they all get together after service and run all around and everything and and so we just wanted to provide something now you know everything that we do is all voluntary you know all our deacons are our volunteers you know what i mean they don't get really paid anything here as far as monetary things and there's a blessing that comes with it and the trustees and the sunday school teachers and the musicians those are all just services of sacrifice you know they're you're not obligated and we never want anything to ever be done by an obligation you know so uh uh and and i know like anytime we have a saturday activity maybe your children or some of them might be in a little little league or baseball or soccer or whatever some of the sports are that they play football and and if you're committed to that that's fine but everything that we do is for those that that want to do it and alls we can do is make the opportunity available for them to come so and even those that are listening in so you know saturday i think it's from is it from 9 to 12 is that what it is i don't see cosmond where are you hiding 9 to 12. 10 to 12. okay they shortened it up so i don't know what we're doing away with but uh okay so it's going to be 10 to 12 so we want to have a little sunday school um lesson and then maybe some activities outside some sort of some games to play and then we'll eat some pizza so the parents are welcome to come you're welcome to bring your kids and we'll probably i'll probably teach a little sunday school class to everybody here in the morning and then um have that and maybe some just some time of fellowship for the kids but it's for the kids it's for those who want to be here if you can bring your children i understand that's wonderful if you can't bring your children we understand that too we're just making it available to whoever can you know who's ever hearts in it we just want to do something for the kids that want to come out and and if there's 10 we'll have a good time with 10. if there's 20 praise the lord you know what i mean and uh and so we just want to create a an atmosphere and uh and and do a little something for our our children and and i certainly uh know that in the situations that are we're in now i i've never seen a time where people are getting burned out so easy you know i mean there's their fuses are short and they're looking for some kind of relief somewhere or anything i i went to my doctor while i was out helping my mom i injured my thumb again you know which was my own fault because i knew not to do something but because i knew not to do it i figured i'd be okay doing it and i remembered why i got a first-hand lesson on why you don't do that you don't tighten a drill chuck with your drill plugged in and so that's just kind of a rule and you lock it if it's a battery drill but anyway so uh but i went to the doctor and everybody in the doctor's office is coughing and i thought and you're going to take my temperature you're going to ask me all these questions and all you people are in there and it's from it's from wearing those masks all day long okay you know what i mean and so you you know i'm sitting there and it's and i'm watching the nurses go down the hall and every time they turn the corner they're going they're stretching it out like this you know trying to catch a breath you know what i mean so everybody's coughing you know and it it's just like man isn't it it's not going to be long there's going to be a whole thing out of how that wearing mask causes deep respiratory trouble and everything but there's one thing i do believe i do believe everybody's going to be hearing better because all their ears are like this now and uh so that is certainly gonna make it uh where we can hear uh better you know but uh i'm sure the dry skin and everything behind your ears is gonna be there and so we're just going through a challenge and and it's real important i think in a way of how that we react to the challenge and and i think there's a reason for it so i just want to spend a few minutes uh uh talking to you tonight a little bit about expression and we we know that uh the scripture is if we go on and a read here in this uh scripture of john it says that this was the true light with light of every man that cometh into the world that's the ninth verse and he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now think of that the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received them not but as many as received him to to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believed on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and and so we know that that this great love that god had for us that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but god sent his son because his son was an expression god's love was expressed in his son jesus god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and and what it was what that jesus was was he was the love of god expressed and and when when jesus uh was here on the earth and he began to live his life the scripture tells us that he was tempted in every way that were tempted and you know i always noticed that that was one of the things that satan always tried to do is he he he never had problem with people seeing the deity of jesus christ making him all god because if he was all god then there you never would have any aspiration of being like him or you would ne you would it would it would be impossible for you to even comprehend or perceive that you could be christ-like so as long as satan could put him out of reach and make him to a place that he he wasn't obtainable he wasn't touchable but you you notice how john wanted to to say here he says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the only begotten of the father and he said that that we we touched him and we beheld him and we knew him and we seen them so that they they saw him as a man but they saw what that it was that was in him and he went on to say uh even in in preaching he says he who have seen me have seen the father and so he he was an expression of of the love of god in other words god wanted to have some way to show fallen man who by the fall in the garden had stepped out of the grace of god out of the atmosphere of protection that he was in as long as adam and eve stayed in that garden they would have remained the sons and daughters of god they would have continually had their dominion they would have continually lived right but something had to come in and to defile them and to and to break them down and in the masterpiece brother branham teaches he said that god saw his broken fallen family and right then in his heart the the very thing that he wanted to do is restore that family back to what that they had lost and and when we we realized it it's hard for us to realize but he said to as many as believe on him he would give them power to become the sons and daughters of god so god wanted to share what that he was that was the purpose that he made man in the beginning and when you think of man you might think well he made adam in the beginning god dwelt alone and god wanted to have fellowship god wanted to share himself and so we come a part of that we were in his mind we were in his thinking and the reason that he he was there is because he wanted to share himself he wanted to express himself and when man fell and separated out from god they they what took over man was unbelief and we know we know that through that tree of good and knowledge good and evil that cain's seed came up and man begin to seek after knowledge they begin to seek after intellect they begin to make a way for themselves in fact they begin to worship god after their own method by building their own altars bringing their own sacrifices offering their own praise and yet man could never find his way back to god god had to provide a way for man to come back to him and can understand that if you backslide or if you fail and you have a failure in the flesh you lose your temper you you look at things you shouldn't look at you get frustrated and say things you you don't really mean to say one of those spirits of gossip just comes flying around and they find you at a weak spot you know what i mean and you're all bummed out and you've worked hard and you know you're you're about ready to like i said i'd pull out my hair sometimes if i could and that spirit just drops on you and in the moment of pressure you you say things that normally you wouldn't say or or you caused something to happen you do something hurtful if you you know you just maybe lose your temper with your children or your loved one or or whatever those circumstances are the prophet of god said in that message letting off the pressure he said he walked up there and he asked that nurse you know uh you know how do i get to himself aren't you someone from just she just read them the right act and you know and i this thought is so beautiful he just stepped back and said wow she's under a lot of pressure you know what i mean if she something has made her to do that and when when you do something like that and you you you you find that the the flesh rises up you know god's made a provision for that he's made a way back out of that circumstance he he's he's made a way back to himself and this is what he did this is why he sent his son he wanted to show man that he may he gave a way back for man to come back to him because without god life is absolutely a drag i i mean there's no joy there's no peace there's no hope there there there's no even any anticipation of a deliverance you know i'll tell you one thing i'm looking up a lot more than i ever had saying boy my redemption draweth nigh i'll tell you what words are starting to come out of the believer's mouth more than ever even so come quickly lord jesus lord is it even possible for this thing to go any uh any deeper into uh into the condition to that that it it's going into and you know i i just come from the you know what the california so you know that that's where the civilization finally ended up now all the filth of the world comes from out there every kind of philosophy and thinking and an ungodly conception that's being birthed out there and being sold to the world through entertainment and through songs and music and and politics and philosophy and everything and the greatest equation to it all is exactly what the scripture said they no longer retain god in their thinking they no longer desire to retain god in their thinking so their conscience has been snared with the hot iron and so all their actions are no longer uh no longer considered to to involve god at all and so the world there he was in their midst and the world knew him not they no longer risk to retain god in their knowledge that's what the word of god said we have come to that place where man does not want to keep god in their knowledge and that's the most important thing for us to do is to remember in the beginning god in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god that that is the ultimate uh truth of the uh that that there is of god and now there's god there's a commercial out about all and the whole commercials shows guys and test tubes and all this and talking about the answer and talking about the deliverance and i almost felt like bringing it in playing it here at church and they say what causes that science oh boy i'm going to put all my trust in science an ungodly scientist and that's what the world does and here's this little voice crying out in this day in a little old body just a humble ministry saying science is of the devil manic is looking so they're they're looking to science uh they're looking to government they they begin to look they begin to look this way and they begin to look that way and they begin to point and there's many voices that says lo he is here in other words you know it's not somebody that says they're jesus it's somebody that's offering deliverance that's what they say in other words though he's here in other words there's peace and safety here you know there's peace that we're going to come up with a vaccine that is going to give you all peace and put you back to normal well i'll tell you something a lot of people are glad to be six feet apart and i've seen a lot of people i'm glad they're wearing a mask you know i want to see all that you know paint and all that stuff i think they look real good in the mask i mean you understand that that you cannot let what is being presented and the atmosphere that's being created affects you because the atmosphere is what draws out the attribute and i want to point that out this evening that that the attribute is drawn out so when god wanted to express his love in his son god had within him attributes we we know that we could we we read it we read it in uh he says he said a thought is it's a thought when it's expressed is a word and a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought then a word then it's spoken so what draws out the attribute is the the atmosphere now god wanted to man to know that he was a god of mercy he wanted man to know that he wanted he wanted to express to man even though they had fallen even though they had sinned even though they had rejected him within him lied an attribute of mercy he was willing to have mercy and so here's blind bartimaeus he he's he's blind he's stuck in the corner the crowd is just screaming everywhere and he cries out about son of david have mercy on me he's crying out thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stops yes because that cry that that atmosphere that it drew the attribute out of jesus that god wanted to express he was an expression so the the situation arised by the knowledge and orchestration of god to create the atmosphere to draw the attribute out of jesus because that was jesus's purpose he who hath seen me hath seen the father the works i do i do not by myself but it's the father in me that does the works in other words it's the attribute of god being expressed through me that's the work the work was in god in the beginning because god was merciful so when jesus came across an atmosphere or circumstance or situation that called for mercy there had to be what a mercy to respond well how did that situation how did the call get there sure the call was orchestrated by the father so that the attribute could be manifested just like when he fed the five thousand he had compassion on him he was a provider that attribute was in god that he was a provider and therefore that situation was orchestrated by the hand of god that caused jesus that the work that the father was in him fulfilling the expression of who that the father was because there was no way for man to know god unless god expressed himself and the only way you can know god is by what that you are remember you can't mix with the dog it's okay the only way that it could that you could relate to it if it came from the flesh it had to come by way of something you could relate to as long as it was a supernatural as long as it was an angelic as long as it was something out of the realms of human in the supernatural you could always dismiss it for yourself because you knew that you are flesh but he was born in every way that we are even tempted the way that we are so that we could look at a man and see that god was manifested in the flesh and he who says that christ has not come in the flesh is antichrist so now they saw a guy is not this the son of joseph is not just a legit illegitimate roman soldier kid who that man joseph covered up for they never saw jesus as god it had to be revealed you say oh yeah they didn't know when he calmed the stores and the wind they sat back and said what manner of man is this they saw a deity moving in flesh and that was god's victory in christ that god so loved the world that he poured himself into a man and that man began to express i don't do these works by myself it's the attributes that god put in me that are being pulled out of me by the atmosphere and the circumstance that's presented before me he couldn't help himself and we saw that that so we saw that attributes of mercy we saw that attribute of forgiveness the woman's caught in adultery here's all these self-righteous people that know no more about god in anything me and matthew were fellowshipping the day it was so beautiful he said you know that in the temple they had the temple right you know why they built that temple to house the ark the ark of the covenant but the ark of the covenant was stolen in and i think it was 586 bc there was nothing in there they were playing church oh how was it to go into the holy of holies oh it's really something there ain't even nothing in there the the the ark was gone it was built the holy of holies was built to house the ark because god the the the it represented the mercy seat it represented the things of god the blood offering the sacrifice it wasn't even he had departed and then when he came in flesh they rent the veil another they tore the veil open so the people could look and see there was no mercy seat there there was no covenant there there wasn't even a covenant there anymore the covenant now was hanging on the cross [Applause] [Music] god's sacrifice for our sins glory how beautiful showing this old empty temple and where was he he was in a man a man showing the attributes of god and then so you you take forgiveness so here's this woman he that's caught in adultery and all these self-righteous guys were going to stone her the law says this the law says that oh my very stuck what has to happen god's real thinking what is it has to be an attribute first then a thought then a word so the real attribute of god the way that god really looks at the circumstance the way god thinks about the circumstance god's what that wasn't stone the sinner stoned the woman no no here's the expression of the attribute of god made flesh now here's a circumstance and he can't help himself he's got to express mercy because that's the thought of god god's thought towards that woman was forgiveness i forgive her he knew her sins he knew what she done she he knew what she'd been doing we don't know why you know there was a harlot in the scripture that was more righteous one of the fathers of israel she didn't have any seed she didn't have any offspring she didn't have any inheritance so she posed you know the story as a harlot enticed to get a child and for witness had a witness and when she revealed herself he said thou art more righteous than i am and she claimed her inheritance don't you get all bent out of shape when you find somebody in a bad circumstance because they might be allowed to be in that circumstance so they can claim their inheritance which is the attributes of god our inheritance is the attributes of god the works that i do you shall do also that's our inheritance our inheritance is not the miracles the miracle is the result of the attribute the miracle is the result of the love he looked at that woman thought oh my goodness daughter boy that serpent's got you in a mess and he looks he says and she finally says he says woman where are thou accusers i'll tell you i i i i'm looking he said that's one of the people i want to meet in the scripture because i can identify with that condition that she was in she didn't try to hide her sins she said master there's none to condemn me but you and he said neither will i condemn thee go thy way and sin no more and she become one of the patriarchs of the scriptures and the bible why because she was a recipient of an attribute of god that's the works the works that i do you'll do oh we want the work that you can see the physical manifestation we want the old stiff leg to come straight and then oh oh praise god miracle i'll tell you what a miracle is someone being born again that's a miracle and and so you you look there and so all of a sudden the circumstance drew out the forgiveness because that's what he was he was an expression of the father we could see the father not see the flesh you can't see the father till you can see the attribute you can relation my mom bless her heart she's a catholic and she'll go in that room and put that mass on you know and they're in there singing oh ramu's day and all these chants and saying the rosary and everything and and you know i'm just going oh mama mama yeah that it it your you're you're in a coffin you know and you say well what do you do you know what my mama's got going for her two sons that believe the message your mama's got that going for her too yeah if if the woman believing wife can sanctify the unbelieving husband and vice versa don't think when the prophet of god said all that you loved and all that loved you will be there let me tell you you've got a lot more going on in you then you realize i i'm not preaching this weekend george smith is preaching but you yeah i want you to see that that it was the the atmosphere was right the person was right god allowed her to be there how many believe the footsteps of the righteous order of the lord do you believe that jesus's footsteps was ordered by the father i do nothing unless the father tells me first i have need to go by there i'm going to go this way i'm going to go down this street today i feel compelled in my spirit remember he was led by the spirit go get us into the tape he was led by the spirit to the circumstance how can he be led to the circumstance if the father didn't already know the circumstance would be there oh we need to get rid of our self-righteousness get out of here self-righteousness so he expressed that he had to express it because that's what he was doing was expressing the father he was the father's victory over the serpent seed i will put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed i'll i'll i'll win this victory i'll redeem my family all the father hath given me will come so there so then he had in him deliverance so he meets the woman at the well how many husbands have you had oh i'm not married you know i i know what i'd have done liar liar pants on fire nose is longer than the telephone wire he says oh you've spoken the truth you're not married but you've been married five times and the one you're with now is not your husband why why because there was deliverance the circumstance the atmosphere was calling for deliverance she she went to that well to get delivered he went there to deliver hallelujah there was going to be a collision amen sin and life was going to meet the prophet of god said every time the spirit comes there's a conflict there's a battle there's a war going on oh i don't have one he said give me the drink you know you don't have nothing to draw with he said oh if you know who you were talking to you'd ask me for living water in other words i've got something to give you you know you should be knowing where i'm going with this message deliverance the man possessed with demons deliverance he had the attribute of deliverance salvation he had the attribute to save he's walking down the street and everybody's crying and everything he comes along and all of a sudden he stops and says zacchaeus come down i'm going home to eat with you because the son of man has come to call sinners to repentance so you you you see he it was he he was the revelation of the father christ was the mystery of god revealed he was the revelation of the father all that the father was he poured into christ every move he made was an expression of the attributes of god deliverance healing saving okay everything joy peace sorrow entering into the burden raising the dead you could just go through all his life and every work and remember those works weren't his works he was sent to express the father it was the father that did the work and let me put that in the god in the beginning was the word the word was a thought it had to be an attribute first then it became a thought then it became the word in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the expression jesus was an expression of god therefore jesus was god but there's one mediator between man and god the man jesus christ the beautiful thing about the lord that when you've seen jesus when you've seen his works if you can't believe me for my words believe me for my works because i do not these works myself it's the father that does the works in other words you didn't see me you saw the father this is how the father thinks can i say that again that was how the father thought when jesus meant an atmosphere he thought about that atmosphere the way the father thought about that atmosphere so the thought came first the attribute was there god then the thought then the word receive thy sight i will not condemn you go sin no more come down the son of man saves you then the word went out because it now became word that's a longer sermon so he was the revelation and therefore what was so beautiful is that when jesus was expressing it he was now making the love of god available to man all that the father was the attributes by displaying those attributes and by showing how the father looked at it by revealing what the father would do how the father thinks he was now making available to you the thinking of the father let this mind be in you that was in christ don't look upon thy own needs but look upon the needs of others you know it's hard for us to think our kids have needs it's hard for us to think our teenagers have needs but sometimes you've got to think what a father do and so we begin to see that that that he was in able to impart what he was to us that was what his victory was we are his victory jesus was the father's victory we are jesus's victory we he was victorious when he was able to impart the thinking of the father to the children where you could think like he thought where you could be one with him where when you meant the circumstance and the atmosphere that attribute would be drawn out of you you don't think god knew this whole mess would be here this whole mess is here so that the true attribute and the true thinking of god towards the whole thing would be manifested in you are you worried i don't worry well what happens if you get sick brother mcgarry what happens if you get c19 guess what i'm going to do i'm going to call the elders of the church and have them lay hands on me i'm going to confess my sins that i'll recover because that's thus saith the lord i'm not opposed to doctors i've been sick enough i asked the guy do you got a gun i've been so seasick that i would have paid you to throw me overboard i i really i said there's a captain got a rifle i don't i don't want to live another minute sick out of my mind so sick i crawled off the boat and kissed the dock and hugged the hug the thing they tied the boat to you know and we have something that's called land sickness you get rocking so long that when you get on earth the earth still and you're going woo in everything yeah we can get sick we can get down we can get out but don't you understand something that when you get there that circumstance calls for the attribute of god it calls for the attribute of god where's that attribute at does anybody know where that attribute at is there anybody here can give me a witness anybody can raise their hand and say brother mcgary it's here it's right in me amen so when i get in that place my condition is going to call for the attribute that is in you because you are his victory that he imparted that attribute to you the works that i do shall you do also i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again in other words the attributes will come again and be with you even in you until the end i don't have to worry about being sick as long as you're not sick and if we bo if we're sick that's what we'll do we'll pray together because wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there i'll be you know that he couldn't be a healer until there was sickness so we're his victory so he he's imparted into us we say his spirit like it's some sort of rub oil a spirit's got identification the five identifications of the church a spirit the identification of the spirit these are the fruits of the spirit these are the identification of the spirit this by your fruits you will know them by you the attributes what you're known by hear me now what you're known by is what the atmosphere draws out of you that's your identification you're not known by your words remember what brother branham said he says that's like the ballistics of a bullet he said it'll go so fast it'll travel so far he said that's the bible that's the word but you've got to shoot the gun you've got to let the attribute be pulled out of you that's why it's there that's why you find yourself the value of what gives something value is the test think it not strange of the testing of your faith it's more precious than gold to be in the circumstance in a situation where you're tempted where you're trapped where you're forced and you get stuck and and to be able to realize and and stop a moment and wait and let that attribute manifest to the circumstance that's what he's looking for then you become his victory father i've imparted myself in them father they respond the way i responded i've won the victory i've showed him my love i've given them my spirit i've put my mind in them that's what he came for that he could bring man and god back together in fellowship that god the threefold purpose right brother and that god could have the preeminence in other words god thinking would be in those who jesus redeemed if god's thinking isn't in you then he has not redeemed you but you say well it's not there all the time if it's there one time you start praising god hallelujah because it's like yeast right a little a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump a little bit of spirit will live in the whole body it'll liven the whole life it'll fill the whole soul it'll go to work on you those attributes will grow he'll tutor you and he'll raise you out and he'll bring you into his image amen so we are the victory of christ jesus the works that he does is not the miracles the miracles are the result of the attributes the the works was the projection and the expression of the attributes of god he said i'd rather have mercy than sacrifice oh church this is what we're heading to the statue of a perfect man the fruits of the spirit the the re the christ-like response in the circumstance that he has planned for us to be in everybody's against you oh everybody hates me nobody loves me i'm gonna go eat worms just stop a moment say he knows i'm here there's a deep calling for a deep there's a god that wants to express i was going to read the quote but i already said it that he said you are an expression god thought it now here you are you're here to do what to express him you're here to prove to this world that everything jesus said is true to prove that his sheep hear his voice and another they won't follow to prove that the works that i do and oh i wish i could lay that down everybody always thinks works is a carnal physical expression and the greater works is a spiritual love of god projected to create and change the atmosphere but anyway this is an eternal subject and just remember you are eternal people you can't take an eternal people and try to place them in time he's on the mercy seat he's not on the mercy seat we're here we're there no wonder he said times no more your eternal people and what is in eternity there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life and god is his attributes expressed amen be the victory remember the circumstance the atmosphere is to draw out the attributes god's allowed this rotten stinking atmosphere so he can draw the real attributes of god out blind barmas drew that attribute out the woman at the well drew that atmosphere out the woman caught an adult he drew that atmosphere out zacharias drew that atmosphere out we could go down and down and down all those were drawn out of jesus because he's an expression now you are his expression because you and him has become one so think it not strange if you find yourself in all kinds of rotten atmosphere because the true bride masters every circumstance amen god bless you brother billy will come and close our service if he's here somewhere where are you hiding there he is here he is i thought billy did a wonderful job senator i was just just having a jubilee brother randy really a wonderful job i almost thought of not coming back but brother george will be here this weekend and and so i didn't mean to go so long but i'm just excited no matter how wretched i am i know that it's predestinated that i'm the circumstance will draw out the attribute because the seeds in there so lord richly bless you tonight let's stand and have a word of prayer and and and everybody anybody in church that wants to come bring your children i think our children are 4 to 12 and if you want to drop them off and go shopping for a couple hours feel free to do that it's not exactly mother's day out but whatever you want to make it is fine and if you want to stay with your kids and listen and watch them play games and eat pizza feel free to do that but whoever feels led if you have other things to do we certainly understand if you're a sunday school teacher and you're already obligated to do something don't feel that you have to change your plans amen i i wanted to do this so it's all on me you know what i mean i wanted to do something for the kids i wanted to make the opportunity available for him i just felt that that was something that i should do so if nobody can make it be all right but you just feel free to come and go as you please and we'll have that a few hours there from 10 to 12. if we go a little overeating that's fine so you're all welcome to bring your kids if they're between the ages of four and uh the twelve and and uh and we'll have some lesson and some sort of fellowship and we just trust the lord some of our believers are out of town we just pray that god makes them prosperous that they be in good health and yeah keep my mom in prayer you can tell that um this is the first time that i could say that i've seen her go go down a little bit and you know i i already know the prophet of god said he prepares you so i could tell it in the actions of her dog you know i knew something was up they they sensed things like that i don't know how long she'll be with me i hope a couple more years but [Music] it's it's coming in and i believe god will have a place for her my dad was a rough guy but my dad was good to my family and in being good to me that goodness was able to help other believers through time my dad helped build my house for me many a person stayed and ate in my house i believe that will be attributed to the mercy that god shows upon my father he may not be in that city and he may not he may not be in the where the lamb is the light but there's people that live on the side of the mountain and they go pick the leaves off the tree and they walk into the city holding that leave up like a day pass like a passport and they can come in and out but the bride's going to dwell there forever amen that's where i i want to go let's just bow our head tonight [Music] maybe we'd ask ourselves this evening [Music] lord him am i meeting the circumstances of this hour with the attributes and works that you presented lord i ask tonight that you impart those attributes to me i'm not worried about the miracle the miracle will follow if i have the attribute every miracle was motivated by divine love and without the attribute we could do all kinds of works and he would just simply say i never knew you the father i i pray that the attributes of of mercy and faith and deliverance and healing [Music] that those that's what flows from me father that i can be the expression because that's what you thought of me you could only think of me of what that you were like brother billy said you brooded over us so that we would come into your image and to be in your image we have to express the same works and attributes and thinking that you expressed may we not be discouraged at the darkness so as the darkness does is manifest the light and i pray father that each soul is stirred up to be christ-like let the love of god just be spread about in their heart by the holy spirit and may this town and this city meet little messiahs walking everywhere that the attributes of the mighty father of heaven would be poured out upon every circumstance whether received or not but the out tribute is there offering opportunity to whosoever will i ask you father i'm the most needy person here please work in me father forgive me of my sins and my unrighteousness forgive me of my selfishness lord forgive me of my lack of discernment of good and evil and lord i call out my circumstance calls for mercy my circumstance calls for deliverance my circumstance calls for salvation lord there's a deep in my heart calling and i know there's a need to respond and i pray for those that feel the same way this evening grant it to them in jesus wonderful name we pray [Music] amen i'll come [Music] oh [Music] oh running after you [Music] foreign i am [Music] and i'll come running after you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] this [Music] the presence of the lord [Music] [Music] oh it is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the presence [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] satisfied for every single [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] from [Music] is [Music] fears [Music] is [Music] righteousness [Music] satisfies [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh
