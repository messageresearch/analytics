[10:53] we pray amen
[10:56] amen as we get brother mike to come and
[10:59] do our song reading
[11:00] uh we have a quick announcement um
[11:02] sister lester just writes uh the
[11:04] pictures for the directory have been
[11:05] postponed due to the weather
[11:07] so uh i'm sure there will be another
[11:09] announcement made when um the pictures
[11:11] would just resume back so that's what
[11:13] the mic comes
[11:25] good morning
[11:30] and i think we were all struck this week
[11:34] by the
[11:34] scenes that played out in the news
[11:38] you know crowds of people converging on
[11:42] a city and
[11:43] maybe in anger or fear or frustration
[11:47] or hatred kind of screaming and
[11:51] shouting their slogans of support for
[11:54] one thing or another
[11:56] you know or to cry something some of
[11:59] them to fight some of them to
[12:01] do violence or to force their way into
[12:04] government buildings
[12:06] you know i don't know about you but i
[12:08] can't remember a time
[12:10] when we lived in such an hour of
[12:12] demonstration
[12:14] seems like there's almost every week
[12:17] almost every day
[12:19] some demonstration about something
[12:23] going on in the in the world
[12:27] right it's almost like
[12:30] this has been the year the hour the age
[12:33] of demonstrations
[12:35] you know and their voices and their
[12:36] people and their messages and their
[12:38] slogans all trying to influence someone
[12:41] or
[12:42] change something or you know what's
[12:44] interesting is everyone's taking a
[12:46] position
[12:47] where they're all declaring where they
[12:50] stand
[12:51] on something giving voice to their
[12:54] demonstration or who they are or where
[12:56] they stand
[12:58] and if that isn't proof that we live in
[13:01] an hour of demonstration
[13:04] an hour of manifestation i don't know
[13:06] what is
[13:09] you know in each of these if you're not
[13:12] careful
[13:13] we're all not careful it's easy to get
[13:14] caught up in
[13:16] one demonstration or another one cause
[13:19] or another and forget
[13:21] that this is the gathering of the people
[13:24] into bundles
[13:26] and you know the thing is is that it's
[13:29] not
[13:30] just the people in the world that
[13:34] have the right to demonstrate you know
[13:36] the believer the bride has a
[13:37] demonstration as well
[13:40] so if there are so many voices in the
[13:42] world and so many
[13:43] causes and so many things to be
[13:46] demonstrating about
[13:48] you know i think we ought to spend some
[13:50] time paying attention to first of all
[13:52] that we're demonstrating
[13:54] the right thing amen but that also we
[13:58] know what the demonstration of the
[14:00] believer of the sons of god
[14:03] is i'd like to look at that a little bit
[14:06] this morning as we read psalm 100
[14:10] you know just to look a little bit at
[14:13] the demonstration
[14:15] of the believer you know in psalm 100 is
[14:19] such a short verse
[14:20] or some such a short passage we all know
[14:22] it well
[14:24] but it's interesting is you know first
[14:27] of all if you look in verse one 1
[14:30] we can make noise too
[14:33] this is our demonstration as we make a
[14:35] joyful noise unto the lord
[14:39] in verse 2 well all those around us
[14:42] might be making declarations about
[14:45] who they serve or who they will not
[14:47] serve
[14:49] our demonstration is this we serve the
[14:52] lord
[14:54] and with gladness not not some man
[14:58] not out of fear you know not out of
[15:01] hatred or mistrust we
[15:02] serve the lord with gladness
[15:06] you know instead of converging on some
[15:08] city somewhere
[15:10] or trying to stand at city hall
[15:14] chanting slogans of solidarity or
[15:17] support
[15:19] instead we come into his presence
[15:22] with singing
[15:26] if you look at verse 3 instead of
[15:28] declaring
[15:29] you know a position with one earthly
[15:32] administration or another
[15:34] our declaration is this
[15:38] know ye that the lord he is god
[15:42] amen amen instead of fretting about
[15:44] earthly rights and
[15:46] privileges that we have to somehow try
[15:48] to protect
[15:50] or champion
[15:53] it says our testimony is this it is he
[15:56] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[16:00] we are the sheep of his pasture
[16:05] in verse four instead of forcing our way
[16:08] into buildings or neighborhoods to show
[16:10] our support
[16:12] or our opposition it says in verse 4 we
[16:16] enter into his gates
[16:18] with thanksgiving and into his
[16:22] courts with praise
[16:25] you know what's interesting is not just
[16:26] everyone has an ability
[16:29] to enter into these courts you know only
[16:33] those that
[16:33] possess a certain access badge
[16:36] only those that possess that token
[16:40] can enter into this building and no man
[16:43] can force their way in
[16:46] as it says in john 10 he that entereth
[16:48] not by the door
[16:51] into the sheepfold but climeth up some
[16:54] other way
[16:55] the same as a thief and a robber
[16:58] and in verse seven verily verily i say
[17:00] unto you i
[17:01] am the door of the sheep you know as
[17:05] david said in psalm 84
[17:06] 10 for a day in the courts
[17:09] in thy courts is better than a thousand
[17:14] i had rather be a door keeper in the
[17:16] house of my god
[17:18] than to dwell in the tents of wickedness
[17:22] you know so rather than involving
[17:24] ourselves in earthly demonstrations
[17:26] let's be about the demonstration
[17:29] of the believer let us make a joyful
[17:32] noise unto the lord
[17:33] let us enter into his gates and into his
[17:36] courts with thanksgiving
[17:38] and with praise so let's read psalm 100
[17:40] together this morning again it's just a
[17:42] short one
[17:44] but you know just a little picture of
[17:46] the demonstration of the believer in
[17:48] this hour of demonstration let's read
[17:50] that together
[17:51] make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye
[17:54] lands serve the lord with gladness
[17:57] come before his presence with singing
[18:00] know ye
[18:01] that the lord he is god it is he that
[18:04] hath made us
[18:05] and not we ourselves we are his people
[18:08] and the sheep of his pastor enter into
[18:11] his gates with thanksgiving
[18:13] and into his courts with praise be
[18:16] thankful
[18:16] unto him and bless his name for the lord
[18:20] is good
[18:21] his mercy is everlasting and his truth
[18:24] endureth to all generations amen
[18:34] amen you may be seated let's just sing
[18:36] this song this morning i've been to the
[18:38] water i've been baptized

[42:32] all our visitors in the house of god
[42:34] this morning pray that god will be your
[42:36] portion amen
[42:50] first john chapter 3 and we start from
[42:53] verse 5
[42:54] it says and and you know
[42:58] and and ye know that he was manifested
[43:01] to take away our sins
[43:03] and in him is no sin
[43:06] it says whatsoever abide in him sinneth
[43:09] not whatsoever sinneth is not
[43:12] sin him neither no no
[43:15] none him little children let no man
[43:18] deceive you
[43:20] he that he that does righteous
[43:23] righteousness
[43:23] is righteous and he is and he is
[43:26] righteous
[43:28] and then he that committeth sin is of
[43:30] the devil and the devil
[43:32] sinneth from the beginning for this
[43:34] purpose the son of god was manifested
[43:37] that he might destroy the works of the
[43:39] devil
[43:40] amen let's also turn in matthew chapter
[43:43] 10
[43:43] we're going to read verse 5 matthew
[43:46] chapter 10 and verse 5.
[43:49] it says these
[43:53] these these 12 jesus sent forth and
[43:55] commanded them saying
[43:57] go it says go not into
[44:00] the way of the gentile in the way of any
[44:04] city
[44:04] of the samaria enter ye not
[44:09] by go rider to the lost ship of of the
[44:11] house of israel
[44:13] and then it says as ye go preach saying
[44:16] the kingdom of god is at hand
[44:19] heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise
[44:21] the dead
[44:22] cast out devil freely filly ye have
[44:25] received
[44:26] and freely give now i want you to see
[44:28] what commission is there given
[44:30] he's even telling them to go and raise
[44:32] the dead and we'll get to that in a
[44:34] moment
[44:35] and john chapter 14 and verse 12.
[44:39] john chapter 14 verse 12 he says verily
[44:42] verily i say unto you
[44:44] says ye that believeth on me the works
[44:47] that i do ye shall do also
[44:49] and greater works than these ye shall do
[44:52] because i go unto my father
[44:54] and whatsoever ye ask
[44:57] in my name that i will do
[45:00] that the father may be glorified in the
[45:03] son and
[45:04] if he asks anything in my name i will do
[45:07] it
[45:08] that's his guarantee saying that you go
[45:11] and then when you ask for something
[45:13] i'll make sure it happens amen let's
[45:15] just buy our heads our gracious father
[45:16] we thank you for your word yes you speak
[45:18] to us tonight
[45:19] this morning we commit everything to
[45:21] your hands and us in the name of jesus
[45:23] christ amen
[45:25] yeah you may have your seeds now we i
[45:27] want to just continue on on
[45:29] what we were speaking
[45:33] i believe it was last sunday
[45:39] the the just for for a cause and
[45:42] and and we just want to focus this
[45:45] morning
[45:46] on what the church mission is what is
[45:49] the church mission
[45:50] you know there's a statement perhaps
[45:52] we'll get to it
[45:54] but random says that that the church
[45:56] cannot progress
[45:57] unless you know on what ground you're
[45:59] progressing
[46:00] you cannot be successful unless you know
[46:02] what is it that you're trying to achieve
[46:05] and i want to just say on the outset
[46:07] that the church was not called
[46:09] to progress on the intellectual ground
[46:11] as we read the scripture he didn't tell
[46:13] them
[46:14] go and sit them down and teach them the
[46:16] gospel
[46:17] and debate on what the meaning of the
[46:19] scripture was and then once they
[46:21] understood
[46:22] walk away no paul tells us that the
[46:24] gospel was go to was sent to be preached
[46:27] with power
[46:28] and demonstration and years jesus
[46:30] telling them and you go
[46:32] you ask it says anything you ask i will
[46:35] back it up
[46:36] anything you go and ask i will back it
[46:38] up i will be right there with you
[46:40] you go you just go and preach you just
[46:42] go and do what i ask you to do
[46:45] when you ask and i said i'll ask my
[46:47] father so that the joy may be fulfilled
[46:49] now i was thinking you think about the
[46:51] cause i was thinking about this morning
[46:53] you know you think about the the the the
[46:56] the great freedoms that we enjoy i
[46:58] thought about even what what mike
[47:00] mentioned this morning you think about
[47:02] the american independence
[47:04] uh you you realize that there's been a
[47:07] lot of lives
[47:08] laid down for the cost of freedom in
[47:11] other words freedom is not free
[47:14] something had to be paid somebody had to
[47:16] lay down their lives so we can enjoy
[47:19] the things that we have so we can stand
[47:21] up here and preach the gospel so we can
[47:23] do
[47:24] all those things there was a life laid
[47:26] down
[47:27] and we realized that it's our
[47:28] responsibility to make sure that
[47:30] we keep in the same path and that's why
[47:33] there are laws and that's why there are
[47:35] things to make sure that freedom
[47:37] uh uh it it it's left to be free
[47:40] and i can say in the spiritual sense
[47:42] it's the same way
[47:44] the freedom that we enjoy in christ they
[47:46] are not free
[47:47] that he gave his own life so we may have
[47:50] them
[47:50] he gave her he lay down his own life so
[47:53] we can be free so we can come this
[47:55] morning and worship him
[47:57] he paid for our sins so we can come this
[47:59] morning
[48:00] and enjoy of the benefit of the death
[48:02] that he died
[48:03] and so we can come this morning and
[48:05] rejoice on those things
[48:06] and we realize with that also there
[48:09] comes
[48:10] certain things as a believer that we
[48:12] have to keep
[48:13] in order for the freedom to continue
[48:16] in other words one cannot come in a
[48:18] place of freedom
[48:19] and try to do something that would
[48:21] infringe upon another's
[48:22] rights because then it's no longer
[48:24] freedom it's freedom because
[48:26] everybody has to participate equally
[48:29] everybody has a part to play
[48:31] everybody has something to add so it can
[48:34] keep going on
[48:35] and we are here as part of god's army to
[48:38] keep the army going
[48:39] to keep the freedom going to keep the
[48:42] flag raised and to to show what party we
[48:44] belong to
[48:45] to show a country we belong to to show
[48:48] what part we are having to play in this
[48:50] freedom that god has given us
[48:52] and branham even speaks i was thinking
[48:55] uh he speaks
[48:56] you know even as the scripture says be
[48:59] not conformed
[49:00] it says by be ye transformed by the
[49:02] renewing of your mind
[49:03] so in that sense in other words even
[49:04] speaking and and letting us know
[49:06] according to the scripture
[49:08] we are called in this world that we're
[49:10] living in to not even be confirmed
[49:13] in other words how could you transform
[49:15] how could you change the world
[49:17] that you are sent to change by
[49:19] conforming to what they are doing
[49:23] how can you affect the world that you
[49:24] are sent to affect
[49:26] by conforming to its laws and to the
[49:28] things that they are doing
[49:29] is saying that you have to be
[49:31] transformed
[49:32] in other words to bring about the change
[49:35] a change that is happening within you
[49:37] from the kingdom that you've come from
[49:39] in other words for you to show it
[49:41] in the world that you are living in i
[49:43] have to come here and
[49:44] show that i come from a different
[49:47] kingdom i haven't been affected by a
[49:49] different kingdom
[49:50] and those things had to show in the
[49:52] kingdom that i'm living in
[49:55] we are not called to follow after the
[49:57] world we are called to transform it
[50:00] by showing that we've been affected by a
[50:02] different kingdom
[50:04] so but when i'm you know he speaks
[50:07] and i was thinking he speaks here in the
[50:09] message well i believe we read this last
[50:12] time it says
[50:13] it says when you are saved god gives you
[50:15] faith to rise from the muck
[50:17] of the earth so now he here you are in
[50:21] this world
[50:21] and we we know that when we are saved
[50:24] it's not so much that
[50:26] uh we were sinner we were we were bad we
[50:30] were
[50:30] we were devil and then we are changing
[50:32] to god but rather it's a recognition
[50:36] that i've been i i i really don't come
[50:38] from the kingdom that i mean right now
[50:41] it's a recognition that i'm not really
[50:44] what i think
[50:44] i was i am different i've been made
[50:47] different i come from a different
[50:49] kingdom
[50:49] and i've come to the realization of it
[50:52] i've come from god and i'm going back to
[50:54] god
[50:54] you come to that realization when you
[50:56] come to that faith
[50:58] rises up it's not a cocker bird being
[51:01] changed into a grain of wheat
[51:03] it's the grain of wheat that was always
[51:05] weak coming into a realization
[51:07] that i'm not of this world i'm not of
[51:10] the things of the world i'm different
[51:13] and then it says it says faith rises up
[51:16] something rises up within you to let you
[51:19] know
[51:19] you are not what you are doing right now
[51:22] you are not what you are supposed to be
[51:24] this is not what i called you to be
[51:27] now now i want you to think about this
[51:30] because barbara says that we may prove
[51:32] what is acceptable
[51:34] and and perfect will of god now how do
[51:37] we prove
[51:38] to prove is to bring into manifestation
[51:41] to prove is to bring into manifestation
[51:45] it says be transformed so our
[51:47] transformation
[51:49] is to actually bring into manifestation
[51:52] the things that god has spoken about you
[51:55] from the beginning
[51:56] the things which god has created you for
[51:59] the things which god is wanting to see
[52:01] out of you the things which were purpose
[52:03] to be here and do
[52:07] and then he says your faith overcomes
[52:09] the things of the world
[52:11] it says what is your faith your faith
[52:14] is the act that god has did it
[52:18] in you to make you a son of god
[52:21] it says you quit your lying you quit
[52:23] your stealing you quit your drinking
[52:26] because your faith rises up above it
[52:29] amen it says if you don't do it if you
[52:32] don't have any faith
[52:33] it says and by faith you are saved and
[52:36] through grace
[52:38] as much as much as your faith will be
[52:40] released
[52:41] that's how much power you can have
[52:43] because
[52:44] it dwells because in you dwells the
[52:48] power to make
[52:49] heaven and earth
[52:52] in you dwell the power to make heaven on
[52:55] earth
[52:56] god dwells in you you are a son and the
[52:59] daughter of god
[53:00] amen there you are but your faith
[53:04] says jesus according to your faith be it
[53:07] unto you
[53:07] if thou canst believe all things are
[53:10] possible
[53:10] verily verily i say unto you if you say
[53:13] to this mountain be that move
[53:15] and don't doubt but believe believe
[53:18] what you believe believe that what
[53:21] you've said
[53:22] so now here he is saying
[53:25] something within your heart has risen up
[53:28] faith has risen up to overcome the
[53:30] things of the world
[53:32] faith has risen up for you to come to
[53:34] victory
[53:35] faith has come to a place where is
[53:37] providing you the very overcoming power
[53:40] which the scripture tells us that faith
[53:42] it says it's the victory that overcomes
[53:44] the world
[53:45] and i'll say this that faith that rises
[53:48] up to overcome the sin
[53:49] and the lying and all those things it's
[53:52] not just saying for it to stop right
[53:54] there
[53:54] it's sand to destroy the works of the
[53:57] enemy
[53:59] it's that same faith that rises up to
[54:02] overcome
[54:02] the things of the world to overcome the
[54:05] depression to overcome not just for you
[54:07] for your children and for your neighbor
[54:09] for the whole world often time we we i
[54:12] i'll just say this we get restricted
[54:15] when we see it happen within ourselves
[54:17] we get happy and we stop and we think we
[54:19] need something else in order for us to
[54:21] do it for our neighbor
[54:22] no it's the same phrase that continues
[54:24] on why because it's sent
[54:26] and it's given to you to overcome
[54:35] but random says it says well
[54:39] you say isn't the holy ghost
[54:42] circumcision it says yes sir
[54:44] amen is that right it says the holy
[54:46] ghost is the seal
[54:48] is the seal of the living god it's the
[54:51] seal
[54:52] of god's approval of your faith
[54:56] it says ephesians 4 4 and 30 says
[55:00] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[55:02] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[55:04] the redemption
[55:06] hallelujah he says now now
[55:10] when you say i've got faith for divine
[55:12] healing
[55:13] something strike you and say move out
[55:17] that's the confirmation that god has
[55:19] received your faith for divine healing
[55:21] that's right when you've got courage to
[55:24] put your faith into action
[55:26] when you when you say you've got faith
[55:29] and afraid to let it to let it go
[55:31] your faith is dead it says
[55:35] but when you've got faith and willing to
[55:37] let it go
[55:38] then god confirming it with a with a
[55:41] science following
[55:42] you'll see your healing that's true when
[55:45] you've got
[55:46] faith so here he is it is again
[55:49] letting us know that there is a need for
[55:52] some action to be
[55:53] followed by the faith that we have
[55:55] there's a need for some
[55:57] belief for something to happen after
[56:00] i've claimed to believe
[56:01] in order for god to follow after that in
[56:04] order for god to come and confirm his
[56:06] word to us
[56:07] you know i was reading you know but
[56:09] branham says on that day of calvary
[56:11] he talks about the very purpose here is
[56:13] christ
[56:14] dying he's saying was so that we can go
[56:16] and preach the gospel
[56:18] and heal the second and then he says
[56:20] raise the dead
[56:23] raise the dead and not not the end of it
[56:26] it says we have to go
[56:27] and impart eternal life
[56:31] and then he asked a question it says you
[56:32] mean a man in part of
[56:35] eternal life he answers his own question
[56:37] he says yes
[56:38] a son of god can impart eternal life
[56:43] so we have to understand this is just
[56:45] bigger than our own selves
[56:46] this is the kingdom of god into action
[56:49] this
[56:50] is the kingdom of god being manifested
[56:52] for the purpose
[56:53] of achieving the purpose why he sent his
[56:56] word
[56:56] he sent his word and he healed them he
[56:59] sent his word he delivered them
[57:00] he sent his word and he saved them why
[57:03] is here to achieve
[57:04] something that he purpose to do since
[57:06] the beginning
[57:12] he continues on now he's comparing
[57:15] uh pentecost versus today says
[57:19] he speaks about when the holy spirit
[57:21] came on the day of pentecost it says
[57:23] they got into action yes when
[57:26] when when his promise was fulfilled when
[57:29] they seen that jesus promised
[57:32] uh what what what that jesus promised
[57:34] them that he would send
[57:36] the promise of the father upon them luke
[57:38] 24 and 49
[57:40] he says behold i send the promise of my
[57:43] father upon you
[57:44] but but terry he terry terry
[57:48] means pray it means wait terry means
[57:51] wait
[57:52] wait upon wait up there in the city of
[57:55] jerusalem
[57:56] until you're being dude with the power
[57:58] from on high and when
[58:00] it says and when this influence of the
[58:03] holy spirit
[58:04] struck them it filled them they seen the
[58:08] word
[58:09] that jesus promised fulfilled it says
[58:12] now
[58:12] i wonder if it would take the same
[58:15] influence on us this afternoon
[58:18] if we seen that promise to do in the
[58:21] last day the
[58:22] fulfillment of what kind of influence it
[58:24] would have to be
[58:25] to give us it says what all we have seen
[58:28] done in this in the last state
[58:30] we ought it ought to put us into action
[58:32] it shows how to do
[58:34] with reverence and humility it says
[58:37] beyond any shadow of doubt
[58:40] the claim that we have made 30 years ago
[58:44] about the pillar of fire
[58:47] that the camera caught your texas camera
[58:50] card
[58:51] not long ago it says scientific
[58:54] scientific research charted out and all
[58:57] kind of research that could find
[58:59] by the fbi and it says it
[59:02] took in texas for a texan it said when
[59:05] you see the sign
[59:07] it cannot be disproved it's true
[59:10] but it says but will you believe the
[59:13] voice that followed the sign
[59:15] the sign is scientifically proven now
[59:18] someday when jesus returns and catches
[59:21] the people
[59:22] all the way there you are you will make
[59:24] it known too
[59:25] notice the pillar of fire should put us
[59:28] into action
[59:29] as the pillar of fire vindicated his
[59:32] promise
[59:32] in the last day jesus said it comes from
[59:35] god and he goes to god
[59:37] when he was when he would he says and
[59:39] what he would do in the last day
[59:42] and here it is both scientifical and
[59:44] spiritual in the word proves it
[59:48] it says that he becomes that he comes
[59:51] that he comes from god and still remains
[59:54] the same
[59:55] he is still god for the promise of the
[59:57] last day it should put us into action
[1:00:00] signs of his coming at hand jesus says
[1:00:04] it was the it was the sodom it was the
[1:00:06] sodom
[1:00:07] just before the world could burn the
[1:00:09] gentile this would return
[1:00:11] and it should influence us and put us
[1:00:14] into action too
[1:00:16] when we see the word fulfilled when the
[1:00:19] promise
[1:00:20] when he what that what he promised it
[1:00:23] should put us
[1:00:24] into action i i want to ask you today
[1:00:27] even this morning
[1:00:29] that we we look at the the very message
[1:00:32] or the revealing of the word that we
[1:00:33] have received at the end time
[1:00:35] we but one of this year taking the day
[1:00:37] of pentecost and saying
[1:00:39] here they are in the upper room and and
[1:00:41] they were there waiting for the promise
[1:00:43] to be fulfilled
[1:00:44] and when the holy spirit fell on the day
[1:00:46] of pentecost
[1:00:47] it propelled them into action that they
[1:00:50] will go
[1:00:50] and do the signs and preach the gospel
[1:00:53] and do those things
[1:00:54] and i want to say this the holy spirit
[1:00:56] falling in this generation
[1:00:58] will not do anything different from what
[1:01:00] the holy spirit did when he followed
[1:01:02] that generation
[1:01:03] and i want to ask you for what purpose
[1:01:05] did he fall
[1:01:07] for what purpose was the holy spirit
[1:01:10] said because remember the promise of
[1:01:12] joel
[1:01:12] that i will send off my spirit because
[1:01:14] what one of them tells us that
[1:01:16] all that god was important to his son
[1:01:18] but then there comes at the end time
[1:01:21] all that god was all that jesus was he's
[1:01:24] pouring into his body
[1:01:26] into his church for what purpose
[1:01:29] when we we see the revealing of the son
[1:01:31] of man when we see
[1:01:33] now remember we are here sitting here
[1:01:35] today with the understanding that this
[1:01:38] message was not just talking about
[1:01:40] taking us back to pentecost
[1:01:41] but he actually vindicated something
[1:01:44] that has never been done before
[1:01:46] where a man is being returned back to
[1:01:48] adam
[1:01:49] where we see the very animal fall can
[1:01:52] come back into existence
[1:01:54] and create something and do something to
[1:01:57] prove that what god has died for
[1:02:00] to prove that the restoration message is
[1:02:02] in action
[1:02:06] to show that there are sons of god being
[1:02:09] returned
[1:02:10] back into that condition of eden where
[1:02:12] they can speak the word
[1:02:14] where they can come into action where
[1:02:16] they can continue the kingdom of the
[1:02:18] father
[1:02:18] where they can come to a place where
[1:02:20] they speak the word and the father
[1:02:22] honors
[1:02:25] hear he him he said it takes he gives it
[1:02:28] to the son
[1:02:29] whatever the son says the father will
[1:02:31] follow
[1:02:32] whatever the son says the father will
[1:02:34] honor
[1:02:38] then it just i just
[1:02:41] began to think within my own heart
[1:02:44] you you think about this great uh things
[1:02:48] uh this great message this great things
[1:02:52] that
[1:02:52] that the the great revealing of the word
[1:02:55] the things that which we have received
[1:02:57] the things which uh uh we have received
[1:03:00] in this end time
[1:03:02] what is it propelling within your heart
[1:03:05] you know there there's one thing i began
[1:03:08] to think of
[1:03:09] that oftentimes trips us most of the
[1:03:11] time you know we each want no doubt
[1:03:14] here we've been called by a supernatural
[1:03:17] way
[1:03:18] you could say well my parents brought me
[1:03:19] to church and this morning i came
[1:03:21] because my whole family came
[1:03:23] but but you have to look at it and
[1:03:25] understand that god is behind it
[1:03:28] we we can look at our own lives and and
[1:03:31] i began to think even
[1:03:32] while i was a sinner while we were all
[1:03:34] sinners that
[1:03:35] things happened that we never understood
[1:03:37] what they meant
[1:03:39] you know people said things or or event
[1:03:42] happened we couldn't put it together but
[1:03:44] only after we've been converted or
[1:03:47] after we received the holy spirit then
[1:03:50] things began to make sense and
[1:03:52] things you can connect back events and
[1:03:54] look and say i never understood this and
[1:03:56] now i look and i
[1:03:58] i realize why that's happening i
[1:04:00] realized why this happened when that
[1:04:02] happened
[1:04:02] now i and and often time we we receive
[1:04:06] the message
[1:04:07] but we keep looking back and looking
[1:04:09] back to make sense of what happened
[1:04:11] in the past to make sense of our own
[1:04:13] lives and i want to say this morning
[1:04:15] there's a forward looking that we need
[1:04:17] to also look because remember
[1:04:19] that all the event that happened in the
[1:04:22] past
[1:04:22] that you were trying to make sense of it
[1:04:25] made sense
[1:04:26] after you got saved but you got safe for
[1:04:28] the purpose of going forward
[1:04:30] for the purpose of you doing something
[1:04:33] for you to move into a direction
[1:04:35] for you to achieve something in other
[1:04:38] words but what have you even said the
[1:04:39] very holy spirit that we receive
[1:04:41] it's only the beginning it's not the end
[1:04:45] it's the very beginning he gives you the
[1:04:48] holy spirit
[1:04:49] it's only the beginning so he can drive
[1:04:51] you into some place
[1:04:57] speaks about the church mission he says
[1:05:00] this
[1:05:01] oh somebody said
[1:05:04] and i thought this was really profound
[1:05:07] he
[1:05:08] said somebody said how many can stand
[1:05:11] and let it says i says how can you stand
[1:05:14] and let
[1:05:15] somebody call you such a bad name
[1:05:18] it says you don't live
[1:05:21] for yourself you live for others
[1:05:26] it says you live for others that you
[1:05:29] might redeem
[1:05:31] that man you become a son
[1:05:35] and that is the trouble of it the church
[1:05:38] has forgotten they were sons
[1:05:42] the church has forgottens out there with
[1:05:44] sons
[1:05:46] it says you are sons you are taking
[1:05:50] christ's place you are sons
[1:05:54] you don't live for yourself you live for
[1:05:56] others
[1:05:57] it says well brother branham i can live
[1:05:59] for the brother
[1:06:00] because he surely is a nice man he says
[1:06:02] that's not it
[1:06:04] live for the man who hates you live for
[1:06:07] the person
[1:06:08] who would kill you if he if he could
[1:06:11] it says that's what he says that's what
[1:06:14] they done to him
[1:06:15] they killed him he died that he might
[1:06:18] save them
[1:06:19] that's eternal life when you get it
[1:06:22] that's the
[1:06:22] that's in your bosom that's it says you
[1:06:25] are facing heaven then
[1:06:27] but your sacrifice it says but you
[1:06:30] sacrifice your own things give them
[1:06:34] up like the sheep gives it gives its
[1:06:37] wool
[1:06:37] you look towards calvary and i thought
[1:06:40] that's the
[1:06:41] the very mission of the church
[1:06:45] but i'm says this and i want to just
[1:06:47] read this quickly
[1:06:48] uh before i i forget it says this it
[1:06:51] says
[1:06:53] now being that more i said being that
[1:06:56] this is more or less the message of
[1:06:58] faith and divine healing
[1:07:00] he says our first motive on this meeting
[1:07:03] is to save the souls
[1:07:07] now i want to ask even as we gather here
[1:07:10] do we come with that mindset within
[1:07:13] ourselves that
[1:07:14] our first goal in gathering this morning
[1:07:17] our first goal in being a christian is
[1:07:20] always to have that sensitivity within
[1:07:22] your heart
[1:07:23] to have that awareness of our mission
[1:07:26] everywhere we go and
[1:07:28] to come with that understanding within
[1:07:30] us in other words what makes you happy
[1:07:32] i remember you know being invited to go
[1:07:35] to a club or to go dance or
[1:07:36] a dance party and everything and him
[1:07:39] speaking
[1:07:40] and i'll just paraphrase it and he says
[1:07:42] that what makes him happy is to see us
[1:07:44] all safe
[1:07:46] is to get down on the knees on an altar
[1:07:49] with the sinner and pray until the
[1:07:52] breakthrough and i wonder what makes us
[1:07:55] happy
[1:07:55] is it to play our favorite video game
[1:07:59] or to eat our favorite steak and and to
[1:08:02] go our favorite place to visit
[1:08:04] and and to do is that really what makes
[1:08:06] us happy
[1:08:10] the church has long forgotten its
[1:08:12] mission we've gotten into the battle of
[1:08:14] intellect and and try to present the
[1:08:17] gospel with just an intellect and go
[1:08:18] back
[1:08:19] where he says signs and wonders will
[1:08:21] follow
[1:08:22] god is looking for a surrendered vessel
[1:08:25] someone who realizes that i'm only
[1:08:27] speaking because i'm sent to speak
[1:08:32] and i've not been commissioned to back
[1:08:34] up my own words
[1:08:35] because there's one behind me who's here
[1:08:38] to back up the things that i say
[1:08:42] it says it says to save the lost souls
[1:08:47] a body no matter how bad they are bread
[1:08:50] written
[1:08:50] how sick they are somebody they can die
[1:08:54] and then he says but if they've met
[1:08:56] perfectly whole tonight
[1:08:58] but that soul which is immortal
[1:09:01] when it's healed will forever live
[1:09:05] that's what we focus on we focus on the
[1:09:07] soul we focus on saving the lost souls
[1:09:10] he continues on in another message he
[1:09:13] says he says now he says
[1:09:15] when i think of the the lacking of it
[1:09:20] the lacking what they're lacking is
[1:09:23] is there's no soul travail people are
[1:09:26] not
[1:09:27] broken up enough there is no burden
[1:09:30] seemingly and they give me and then he
[1:09:33] says
[1:09:34] and you give me somebody that's so tore
[1:09:36] up about the lost souls
[1:09:38] that they just cry and are wanting
[1:09:42] a revival so bad till they can hardly
[1:09:45] eat just simply can
[1:09:51] now that this is the church mission
[1:09:54] and then it says if you would read the
[1:09:57] history of the world
[1:09:59] and the religion history you'll find out
[1:10:02] that
[1:10:02] it's always taken that kind of spirit to
[1:10:05] bring a revival
[1:10:07] that's right when zion travails i think
[1:10:10] that's a better
[1:10:11] travail that's a better word he says
[1:10:14] then she brought forth children
[1:10:16] you have to be tore up that's the
[1:10:19] atmosphere
[1:10:20] of anything when we come with a mission
[1:10:24] when we come broken up when we come with
[1:10:26] a desire with a passion
[1:10:28] to see something happen not just when we
[1:10:31] come content in the state that we are in
[1:10:33] not just when we come and know that well
[1:10:35] we leave it all up to god we are just
[1:10:37] yet to receive
[1:10:38] but when we receive that we are being
[1:10:40] made co-worker with him
[1:10:42] when we understand that we are part of
[1:10:44] the plan of redemption
[1:10:45] when we understand that the very reason
[1:10:47] why he sent his word in this last age
[1:10:50] is to redeem those redeemable
[1:10:53] and as you are redeemed you become part
[1:10:56] of god's plan
[1:10:57] to redeem the others
[1:11:04] he says
[1:11:09] i can clearly assure you
[1:11:12] where god gave the church the power to
[1:11:14] heal the sick
[1:11:16] now somebody show me
[1:11:21] he says somebody show me where he take
[1:11:24] the where he took that back
[1:11:26] show me that show me where it is there
[1:11:28] isn't
[1:11:29] he says is there
[1:11:33] is the power in the church it says is
[1:11:35] the power in the
[1:11:36] in the church but the church has
[1:11:39] forgotten it
[1:11:41] they don't practice it
[1:11:45] they don't put it into practice
[1:11:48] so you see it's become again a theology
[1:11:52] made man theology he says when it does
[1:11:56] it doesn't compare with god's bible
[1:12:00] god's bible still remains the same jesus
[1:12:03] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:12:05] forever
[1:12:06] the works that i do shall you do also lo
[1:12:08] i'm with you
[1:12:10] always even in you even in you
[1:12:18] even in you until the end of the world
[1:12:20] hit that believeth on me
[1:12:22] though he is dead yet shall he live
[1:12:25] whatsoever live and believe on me he
[1:12:27] shall never die
[1:12:28] believeth out this so yeah there is the
[1:12:31] prophet here showing
[1:12:32] that power is given to the church but
[1:12:35] the problem is
[1:12:36] the church is not practicing it and
[1:12:39] because they're not practicing it it's
[1:12:41] changing to theology it's just common
[1:12:44] you know just say some few words and and
[1:12:47] you know
[1:12:48] you know just throw out something out
[1:12:49] there with no desire no ambition
[1:12:52] whatsoever
[1:12:53] with no prayer asking for god to move or
[1:12:56] something
[1:12:57] you know you know if you see they'll
[1:12:59] catch it anyway no
[1:13:00] but a group of people that's on the
[1:13:02] mission a group of people that have an
[1:13:05] understanding a group of people that
[1:13:08] understand the position
[1:13:09] and the role that they are playing
[1:13:14] they are not satisfied with the devil
[1:13:16] just tearing everything into pieces
[1:13:18] they want to go into challenge like the
[1:13:20] prophet said they want to go toe-to-toe
[1:13:22] with the devil
[1:13:24] and they want to claim back what belongs
[1:13:26] to them
[1:13:27] they want to take back every inch that
[1:13:29] god has given to them
[1:13:30] if it's ours we're going back after it
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:35] that's the people that we ought to be
[1:13:37] why because the word has been made
[1:13:39] revealed
[1:13:40] and god is looking for a manifestation
[1:13:42] of that word
[1:13:43] and the manifestation comes when people
[1:13:46] are stepping into the word
[1:13:47] and claiming it
[1:13:51] now i want you to see now what he says
[1:13:53] this i thought this was very interesting
[1:13:56] in the church edge book it talks about
[1:13:58] the condition of the church
[1:13:59] he says thou sayeth is increased with
[1:14:01] good that's speaking about the church of
[1:14:03] laodicea
[1:14:04] he says this literally means i'm
[1:14:06] spiritually rich
[1:14:08] he says this sounds like the millennium
[1:14:12] with streets of gold and the presence of
[1:14:14] god
[1:14:15] but i wonder if this is so is the church
[1:14:18] truly rich and spiritual in spiritual
[1:14:21] things
[1:14:22] of god he says let ex let us examine
[1:14:25] this 20th century
[1:14:27] century laodicea boasts in the light of
[1:14:30] the word
[1:14:31] it says if the church is truly
[1:14:33] spiritually rich
[1:14:35] its influence will be felt upon the
[1:14:37] community
[1:14:40] life community
[1:14:42] should feel it it says but exactly what
[1:14:45] kind of life
[1:14:46] the dare these so-called spiritual
[1:14:50] spiritual and influenced men of the
[1:14:52] community live
[1:14:54] it says out of the suburbs it says out
[1:14:57] in out in the better class of district
[1:15:01] it says
[1:15:11] out in the suburbs out in the better
[1:15:14] class district
[1:15:15] this it says these classes
[1:15:18] these is this better class district it
[1:15:21] says
[1:15:22] there are there they abound wife
[1:15:25] swapping
[1:15:26] prostitution band of children crashing
[1:15:29] parties
[1:15:30] it is an exciting a terrible toll of
[1:15:33] property damages
[1:15:35] damage immorality has reached all-time
[1:15:38] high
[1:15:39] and promiscuous sex act narcotic
[1:15:42] addiction
[1:15:43] gambling stealing and all kind of evil
[1:15:46] and the church goes on to claim how
[1:15:49] fine in this generation how fine
[1:15:53] it is in this generation
[1:15:56] he says how full they are the churches
[1:15:58] and how responsive
[1:16:00] especially in how responsive even in the
[1:16:04] natives
[1:16:05] on the mission field the church has
[1:16:08] turned has turned the people
[1:16:10] over to the doctors especially the
[1:16:12] psychiatrist
[1:16:13] how can how can they pray about being
[1:16:16] rich spiritually
[1:16:17] is more than i know isn't it says it's
[1:16:20] it isn't true this they are bankrupt and
[1:16:24] don't know it
[1:16:28] it's speaking about the church look at
[1:16:30] the world look at the church
[1:16:32] they claim they send missionaries they
[1:16:34] go give up bibles they go do this and
[1:16:36] they go give her clothes they go give
[1:16:38] her dad and
[1:16:39] yet in their own neighborhood there are
[1:16:41] a bunch of crimes and
[1:16:43] kids in with in drugs and all kinds of
[1:16:47] uh uh things promiscuous sex and all
[1:16:49] kinds of things happening
[1:16:51] and yet they're claiming that they are
[1:16:53] making ground yet they're claiming that
[1:16:55] they are spiritual
[1:16:57] he continues on and he says take a look
[1:17:00] around around you examine the people
[1:17:04] that walk by
[1:17:05] that they walk by it says in a multitude
[1:17:08] and you can see
[1:17:09] you can pick up those that have the
[1:17:11] appearance of christians
[1:17:13] watch how they dress it says watch how
[1:17:16] they act
[1:17:17] hear what they say see what they go
[1:17:20] survey what uh surely
[1:17:24] they ought to be some real evidence the
[1:17:26] new birth
[1:17:27] among all those that we see go by it
[1:17:30] says
[1:17:31] but few they are few there be
[1:17:34] he says yet today the the fundamental
[1:17:37] church
[1:17:38] are telling us that they have millions
[1:17:40] saved
[1:17:41] and spirit filled he says spirit feel
[1:17:44] can you call a woman a spirit phil
[1:17:48] who around uh who who goes around with
[1:17:51] the freezy bob hair
[1:17:53] shorts and slacks and altars breathe and
[1:17:56] all painted up jezebel if those are
[1:17:59] abundant uh
[1:18:00] if those are uh are doomed
[1:18:03] in modesty a pill as become christian
[1:18:06] woman
[1:18:07] i would hate to think what it would be
[1:18:09] what it would be
[1:18:10] if we had the witness uh if we had to
[1:18:13] witness a display of immorality
[1:18:18] yeah they are and they're not coming to
[1:18:21] the realization
[1:18:23] that they have actually missed what the
[1:18:25] purpose was
[1:18:27] the purpose was not to go and give out
[1:18:29] gifts and
[1:18:30] and do all of those things the purpose
[1:18:32] was that the same spirit that was in
[1:18:35] christ
[1:18:36] will come into the church and by that
[1:18:38] spirit
[1:18:39] a people will be brought into a
[1:18:41] condition where they would manifest the
[1:18:43] same works that christ did
[1:18:45] where they will come in our community
[1:18:48] that we can go and shake up the
[1:18:49] community
[1:18:50] that we can save the lost and we can
[1:18:53] manifest
[1:18:54] christ with our neighbors that we can do
[1:18:56] all those things
[1:18:57] and yet they are claiming all those
[1:18:58] things and there's no proof at all
[1:19:05] if there are spirits feel then how come
[1:19:07] all those things
[1:19:10] he says now
[1:19:15] i know that the woman don't set the
[1:19:18] style
[1:19:19] hollywood does that but listen ladies
[1:19:23] they still sell yard goods and and
[1:19:26] sewing machines
[1:19:28] you don't have to buy what in what's in
[1:19:31] the store
[1:19:33] then use it as an excuse this is a
[1:19:36] deadly serious matter
[1:19:38] and i'm going and i'm going into it says
[1:19:42] it says have you not read the scripture
[1:19:45] that when a man looks upon a woman and
[1:19:48] lasts after her
[1:19:51] last after her in his heart that he that
[1:19:54] he he has already committed adultery
[1:19:57] with her you know in his heart
[1:19:59] it says that purpose and and and
[1:20:01] supposed to be dressed in such a way as
[1:20:04] to cause that
[1:20:05] it says that makes you his partner in
[1:20:07] sin even though
[1:20:09] even though you absolutely you you'll be
[1:20:11] absolutely unaware of it
[1:20:13] and being true virgin with no such
[1:20:17] desire yet god holds you
[1:20:20] accountable and will judge you
[1:20:23] i i just want to ask you what was the
[1:20:26] purpose
[1:20:26] for for for the messenger sending the
[1:20:29] message
[1:20:30] or even bringing this message to us it
[1:20:33] was to put us into preparation
[1:20:36] so we can come to a place where we come
[1:20:39] into the realization
[1:20:40] that the church has felt this mission
[1:20:43] and the mission was not to go just oh
[1:20:46] and give out all kinds of gifts
[1:20:48] but the purpose was actually to come
[1:20:50] into a condition where christ can come
[1:20:53] and manifest himself in his church
[1:20:59] he says in the smyrna church it says
[1:21:06] he says you have left the word
[1:21:11] of god repent and come back to the word
[1:21:15] from the first book in the bible in
[1:21:17] genesis to the last book of revelation
[1:21:20] there's only one reason for god's
[1:21:22] displeasure
[1:21:23] living the word it says there it is
[1:21:27] only one remedy to regain the favor
[1:21:31] back to the word the the church has long
[1:21:35] forgotten
[1:21:36] i was even thinking about that that
[1:21:38] vision but when i'm ahead about
[1:21:40] the church he says that he saw
[1:21:43] the bride he came into preview the first
[1:21:46] time
[1:21:48] he said she came and oh how she was
[1:21:51] dressed
[1:21:51] such immoral and he began to to even cry
[1:21:54] within himself he says
[1:21:56] is this really the word that we have
[1:21:58] preached is this really what we
[1:22:00] have worked for everything we have given
[1:22:02] is this really the purpose
[1:22:04] all the effort that we put in is this
[1:22:06] really what we're going to produce
[1:22:10] you know because we have to ask
[1:22:11] ourselves what are we producing
[1:22:14] our efforts our coming to church
[1:22:16] everything that we are doing
[1:22:18] what are we trying to produce and then
[1:22:20] he says but then
[1:22:21] the bride came back into preview the
[1:22:23] second time
[1:22:25] oh but when is he coming in the second
[1:22:27] time she was dressed as
[1:22:28] right and her hair was just long and
[1:22:31] right and
[1:22:32] and she began to walk and walk it and
[1:22:34] walk and he says then i noticed
[1:22:36] a couple that way at the end and they
[1:22:38] began to look and they were looking at
[1:22:39] me and they
[1:22:40] began to look and pretty soon they began
[1:22:42] to get out of step
[1:22:43] and he began to scream out and it says
[1:22:45] get back in step
[1:22:48] in step with what with the word that was
[1:22:51] given to us
[1:22:52] in step with our commission and step
[1:22:55] with the mission that we are here to
[1:22:57] fulfill
[1:23:01] he says
[1:23:08] if you are true seed if you are truly
[1:23:11] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:23:15] you will esteem the word above your
[1:23:18] necessary meat
[1:23:22] you will esteem the word above the
[1:23:25] unnecessary meat
[1:23:28] and yearns to live by every word
[1:23:33] that proceeded out of the mouth of god
[1:23:36] this is my earnest prayer for all of us
[1:23:39] it says may we may we have a ear
[1:23:43] what the spirit brings from the word
[1:23:46] i want the word to be my meat i want it
[1:23:49] to be more important than anything
[1:23:51] i want to to have it always before me
[1:23:55] i want to know what god says i want it
[1:23:57] to be always before me
[1:23:58] because i know that's the only way i can
[1:24:00] overcome the
[1:24:02] word was given for me to overcome and
[1:24:04] it's only by staying with the word that
[1:24:06] i overcome
[1:24:07] the moment i step out i have no right i
[1:24:10] have no place
[1:24:11] i have no protection i have nothing but
[1:24:14] when i stay with the world
[1:24:16] it might turn me to pieces it may cause
[1:24:18] me to go to my knees
[1:24:20] it may cause me to lose my mind but i'll
[1:24:22] stay right there because that's where my
[1:24:24] victory is
[1:24:25] [Applause]
[1:24:27] to esteem the word of god more than meat
[1:24:30] jesus looked at them and they came and
[1:24:32] they brought food and he says here's the
[1:24:34] food he says
[1:24:35] oh i already ate they said what did you
[1:24:37] eat it says
[1:24:38] to fulfill the words of my father that's
[1:24:41] me to me
[1:24:44] that actually fills me up naturally not
[1:24:47] just spiritually naturally
[1:24:49] i feel happy i feel happy i can dance
[1:24:52] i can jump in
[1:24:56] that's what we are called to be we are
[1:24:58] not out to just be
[1:24:59] some kind of passive group of believers
[1:25:02] you know we say this we
[1:25:03] fall with this we fall no we stand up
[1:25:06] for something
[1:25:12] i was thinking about brother brian he
[1:25:14] speaks about his own life
[1:25:16] and and for the sake of time i'll just
[1:25:18] skip some of these things it says
[1:25:21] he speaks about his own life and he
[1:25:24] speaks it says
[1:25:27] it says they came he came in their
[1:25:29] meeting and many times
[1:25:32] it says and many times having a meeting
[1:25:35] just like this right now
[1:25:37] and so this time it says when it comes i
[1:25:40] just feel like the light shining on the
[1:25:42] floor
[1:25:43] and he came across the four walking to
[1:25:45] me and a man
[1:25:46] it says a man some 200 pound
[1:25:53] dressing right robe and had a dark hair
[1:25:56] to his shoulders it says very pleasant
[1:25:59] sort of man i could not move
[1:26:04] i was shaking
[1:26:10] he says i heard i heard his voice
[1:26:14] and ever since i was little but when
[1:26:18] i've seen him
[1:26:22] it says but when but i've never seen him
[1:26:26] nothing but the whirlwind a different
[1:26:28] pill of fire
[1:26:30] it says i knew it was the same man
[1:26:33] the same voice that talked to me since
[1:26:36] since i was a little boy and he says i'm
[1:26:39] sent from the presence of the almighty
[1:26:40] god to tell you
[1:26:42] that your peculiar birth and life has
[1:26:44] been
[1:26:45] an indicated and indicate that you are
[1:26:48] to pray for the sick
[1:26:50] to the whole world and he says if you'll
[1:26:53] be sincere and
[1:26:54] and when you pray you'll get the people
[1:26:56] to believe you nothing will stand before
[1:26:58] your prayer
[1:26:59] and then he says for this cause i was
[1:27:03] born
[1:27:07] for this cause i was born
[1:27:11] so the prophet could look at his
[1:27:13] mysterious life
[1:27:15] things that happened to him you know it
[1:27:17] talks about a man on the bus
[1:27:19] or a woman or a man on the bus i can't
[1:27:21] recall looked in at him and he says
[1:27:24] you know under what sign you were born
[1:27:27] and
[1:27:28] that freaked him out so this was all
[1:27:30] this mysterious things happening
[1:27:33] and now now it comes to a place
[1:27:36] this angel or this angel who was sent
[1:27:39] from the presence of god
[1:27:40] comes face to face with him and says for
[1:27:42] this cause
[1:27:43] you were born now i want you to now hear
[1:27:46] it says
[1:27:47] well now he says i can be honest see
[1:27:52] that's that's that's that's always i
[1:27:55] always try to be
[1:27:56] to be honest with my people with the
[1:27:58] people it says with the people of god my
[1:28:00] friend it says
[1:28:01] well i was born and raised poor in my
[1:28:03] family i said i'm uneducated
[1:28:05] he said i'll be with you
[1:28:11] now remember we said we read the
[1:28:12] scripture says i'll be with you
[1:28:14] always whatever you ask i'll back it up
[1:28:16] whatever he's making the same claims
[1:28:19] that
[1:28:19] he makes to the disciple he's now making
[1:28:21] it now he goes on he says he says
[1:28:24] as the prophet moses was given two signs
[1:28:26] to vindicate his ministry
[1:28:28] this man came and tells him now that
[1:28:30] you'll be given two signs
[1:28:36] you'll be given two signs now
[1:28:40] i want to just say this the the
[1:28:43] god equipped the man that he sent
[1:28:48] and god is not going to send you without
[1:28:51] equipping you
[1:28:54] god is not i mean he didn't say well you
[1:28:57] know you go
[1:28:58] and whatever happened no he says he
[1:29:00] texts he says
[1:29:01] oh the word believe me says i'll be with
[1:29:03] you it says well you know i was born
[1:29:06] uneducated he says i'll give you two
[1:29:08] signs like i gave
[1:29:09] moses the same god has come here it's
[1:29:11] been revealed in this end time
[1:29:13] and is telling you the same exact thing
[1:29:16] because remember if god ever done one
[1:29:18] thing one way
[1:29:19] it's obligated to do it every time god
[1:29:22] cannot send one
[1:29:24] set of believers with signs and wonders
[1:29:26] promising to back them up
[1:29:28] and come back to the end time and leave
[1:29:30] us alone
[1:29:31] and say you just go and you just do what
[1:29:33] you want to do no
[1:29:34] it's the same god he does the same thing
[1:29:41] so the holy spirit power was given
[1:29:44] in order for them to continue the works
[1:29:46] of christ
[1:29:47] by receiving christ within them that
[1:29:50] receive
[1:29:51] everything that christ wants now i want
[1:29:53] not to sink
[1:29:54] by receiving christ they receive
[1:29:57] everything that christ was
[1:29:58] in other words if christ healed the sick
[1:30:01] they were able to heal the sin
[1:30:02] if christ raised the dead they had the
[1:30:05] same power within them to do it
[1:30:08] let's put it to practice let's not let
[1:30:12] it die
[1:30:13] let's not get too intellectual where we
[1:30:16] just think about
[1:30:17] oh you know this and this now let's call
[1:30:20] the power of god and
[1:30:22] the attributes of god let's have it
[1:30:24] manifested in our mission
[1:30:26] where a sinner can walk in and feel the
[1:30:28] presence of god
[1:30:33] he says this he continues on he says
[1:30:36] i have given my entire life for this
[1:30:39] cause
[1:30:40] now first he's he get
[1:30:44] he get revealed what his cause was
[1:30:50] it says for this cause i was born
[1:30:53] and now i believe it's in the same
[1:30:54] message he gets to another place it says
[1:30:58] i have given my entire life for this
[1:31:00] cause
[1:31:03] that i may say this with sincerity
[1:31:06] that if i had ten thousand lives i would
[1:31:09] never change
[1:31:10] my opinion
[1:31:15] can you say the same thing this morning
[1:31:18] now i want you to have to hear what he
[1:31:19] says this
[1:31:21] it says now
[1:31:25] in the message the image of christ it
[1:31:27] says
[1:31:28] we're speaking through the other day
[1:31:30] before the businessmen and we
[1:31:32] and there were tanners and attorneys and
[1:31:34] and fourth
[1:31:35] and one said it said one says what's
[1:31:39] your
[1:31:39] what's your main objective in life
[1:31:43] excuse me
[1:31:55] he asked the question what's your main
[1:31:57] objective in life
[1:32:02] if you ever ask yourself that question
[1:32:05] what's your main objective in life
[1:32:08] he says i says
[1:32:11] i said i have one it says what is it
[1:32:15] i said saving souls for christ
[1:32:21] it says the only thing my highest
[1:32:25] ambition and only ambition
[1:32:28] is to see christ glorified i
[1:32:32] live for that
[1:32:36] my highest ambition in life
[1:32:40] is to see christ glorify you you know i
[1:32:43] feel like sometimes we've replaced our
[1:32:45] highest ambition with our jobs
[1:32:47] with our family our lives and our
[1:32:50] businesses
[1:32:51] our everything and everything and and
[1:32:53] christ is somewhere in that packing
[1:32:55] order you know
[1:32:56] he pops up every once in a while you
[1:32:58] know every time if we forget we move him
[1:33:00] up and then he comes down again we move
[1:33:02] him back
[1:33:02] up but here's the man who's focused he's
[1:33:06] saying
[1:33:07] when i woke up in the morning when i get
[1:33:10] out of my bed and
[1:33:11] when i go out everything i do there's
[1:33:13] one ambition
[1:33:15] not two one there's one single ambition
[1:33:19] there's one ambition that i'm looking
[1:33:21] for and that's for christ to be
[1:33:22] glorified
[1:33:23] and then listen to what he says and i'm
[1:33:25] so pleased our testimony that
[1:33:28] 31 years it is making
[1:33:31] now it says i'm so hum i i i says i have
[1:33:35] i have humbly served him and if if i
[1:33:38] should have a million years
[1:33:40] i would i had i if i had that much life
[1:33:43] i would i want to live every minute of
[1:33:46] it
[1:33:47] for you for and i it says and if i knew
[1:33:51] that it would turn me down at the end
[1:33:54] it's such a privilege to live for him
[1:33:56] amen
[1:33:58] you mean it turns you down at the end
[1:34:01] but yet it's still a privilege to live
[1:34:03] for him
[1:34:04] if so it's so real so so good
[1:34:08] i have never found nothing in all my
[1:34:10] travels
[1:34:11] all my life that would that would that
[1:34:14] would anywhere compare
[1:34:16] with the fellowship that we have
[1:34:17] together when we are alone
[1:34:20] i he and i there's no sweet communion
[1:34:23] there's no greater love for any for my
[1:34:26] wife for children for
[1:34:27] anything is the love of christ is so
[1:34:30] good
[1:34:34] can we say the same thing
[1:34:39] that's the kind of atmosphere that's the
[1:34:42] kind of love that would produce
[1:34:44] something
[1:34:47] and i want to ask us this morning
[1:34:50] what what is the ambition of christian
[1:34:52] life tabernacle
[1:34:54] you know we gather here morning and we
[1:34:57] gather here
[1:34:58] sunday morning sunday sunday night and
[1:35:00] wednesday what is the ambition of the
[1:35:02] members
[1:35:04] as we gather here
[1:35:10] what what are we trying to see what are
[1:35:12] we
[1:35:13] yearning for what are we wanting to see
[1:35:15] god do
[1:35:18] you know and i want to say this the the
[1:35:20] promises of god
[1:35:22] we have been given in this end time
[1:35:24] there are things that we want to see
[1:35:26] because remember that this message has
[1:35:29] given us
[1:35:30] such a privilege such an understanding
[1:35:33] that god
[1:35:34] is wanting to make himself one with us
[1:35:36] god is wanting to take us back
[1:35:38] into the very same condition that adam
[1:35:41] was in the beginning
[1:35:42] and we have to strive for those things
[1:35:45] we have to have an ambition we have to
[1:35:48] strive to see the sinners
[1:35:50] save our children safe to see the lost
[1:35:53] ones come in
[1:35:54] we have to be here and and be motivated
[1:35:57] because we are here at the service of
[1:35:58] god
[1:36:00] we and and i want to say this the and
[1:36:02] the only way we can achieve it
[1:36:04] is if we come into a unity everyone with
[1:36:07] the same purpose with the same goal
[1:36:10] everyone putting the shoulder to the
[1:36:12] wheel everyone
[1:36:13] though the same motivation that's how
[1:36:15] we'll see god move
[1:36:17] it's not we come and you know this one
[1:36:19] oh well you know
[1:36:20] they didn't think my favorite song or
[1:36:22] you know they didn't do this and
[1:36:24] oh i really didn't like the way this
[1:36:26] sounded today you know no
[1:36:28] we're not going to achieve that's the
[1:36:29] devil trying to divide
[1:36:32] and as long as we are divided we can
[1:36:35] never achieve anything
[1:36:36] and that's what he wants but oh if we
[1:36:38] can come with one accord
[1:36:40] you know i was thinking about nimrod
[1:36:42] they they gather up together
[1:36:44] man they gather up together they build
[1:36:47] this great tower
[1:36:48] and god had to come down and destroy it
[1:36:52] because they were in such unity and if
[1:36:55] man can do that
[1:36:56] how much more the children of god you
[1:36:59] know the scripture says if one can put
[1:37:01] i believe a thousand you know two can
[1:37:03] put about ten thousand on all those
[1:37:05] things
[1:37:06] if we can gather up under with the same
[1:37:08] goal same objective
[1:37:11] i wonder what god can do through us
[1:37:14] oh i tell you i want to be part of
[1:37:15] whatever that is
[1:37:17] so god can come in this morning and say
[1:37:19] i i heard the prayer of the one sitting
[1:37:21] over there
[1:37:22] i heard the cry of the other one sitting
[1:37:24] over there i had the intercession of the
[1:37:26] other one
[1:37:27] i have the song of the other one we come
[1:37:30] in such unity where god
[1:37:31] is manifesting in his people
[1:37:37] the scripture speaks in ecclesiastes 49
[1:37:40] it says
[1:37:41] two are better than one because
[1:37:46] they have a good reward for their labor
[1:37:50] for if you if if they fall
[1:37:53] one will lift up his fellow
[1:37:56] but what to him that is alone when he
[1:37:59] falter
[1:38:00] for he had no not another to help him
[1:38:04] to help him up again if two lies
[1:38:07] together
[1:38:08] then they have heat but how can they be
[1:38:12] warm
[1:38:12] how can you be warm alone if one prevail
[1:38:15] against him
[1:38:17] two shall withstand him and threefold
[1:38:20] scored
[1:38:21] is not quickly broken
[1:38:33] what am i gonna say
[1:38:38] i'll get to a closing a little bit
[1:38:43] i i i just move in my heart when i read
[1:38:46] this
[1:38:47] it's the sir we would see jesus it says
[1:38:49] now i'll just get in the middle
[1:38:52] for the sake of time it says now
[1:38:56] if he is so great he speaks about jesus
[1:39:00] if he is so great and we see him in
[1:39:03] galilee
[1:39:05] as we see him through the bible as the
[1:39:07] pages unfold
[1:39:10] with his promise i wonder tonight
[1:39:13] if we as this church wouldn't have just
[1:39:17] as much right as those greeks
[1:39:21] did to come up to the worship and say
[1:39:25] we would see jesus do we have the same
[1:39:28] right
[1:39:29] he asked now he says now
[1:39:32] there's some things that the bible that
[1:39:35] there's some things in the bible that
[1:39:37] god
[1:39:38] wants us to challenge
[1:39:44] there are some things in the bible that
[1:39:47] god
[1:39:48] wants us to challenge he says
[1:39:52] god is all-powerful god
[1:39:56] and he gives his servants a commission
[1:39:58] to do great things
[1:40:01] now he says raise the dead heal the sick
[1:40:04] those are great things and then he says
[1:40:07] there are things that we need to
[1:40:08] challenge
[1:40:10] it says and we mustn't be afraid to ask
[1:40:13] god to do great things
[1:40:19] because he's asked us to do the
[1:40:21] impossible
[1:40:23] without him i want you to follow closely
[1:40:28] so if he's asked us to do the impossible
[1:40:32] we want to have the omnipotent god
[1:40:35] to do those impossible
[1:40:39] go ye in all the world preach the gospel
[1:40:44] to every creature these signs shall
[1:40:46] follow them that believe
[1:40:48] he says the impossible with man and we
[1:40:51] mustn't be afraid to ask god
[1:40:53] to keep his word i thought this just
[1:40:56] spoke to my heart god said go raise the
[1:41:00] dead
[1:41:00] i don't have power to raise the dead
[1:41:03] amen
[1:41:04] but he doesn't say it to say that you go
[1:41:07] do it by your own self
[1:41:09] now he said okay you want me to raise
[1:41:11] the dead well you know you said i'll go
[1:41:13] raise the dead
[1:41:14] and you ask me to do the impossible i
[1:41:17] want the omnipotent god
[1:41:18] to come and do that impossible the
[1:41:22] challenge of it that we run into is we
[1:41:24] are afraid to challenge god
[1:41:28] and yes he says god in the bible
[1:41:31] he wants us he's written some things for
[1:41:34] us to challenge him
[1:41:38] not us god wrote it put it in such a way
[1:41:42] that we can come and challenge him he
[1:41:44] says you said you raised the dead
[1:41:47] you said you healed the sick and we are
[1:41:49] here only here as your servant
[1:41:51] we are here only as your sons and your
[1:41:54] daughters and i'm calling upon the god
[1:41:56] who gave
[1:41:56] us his word to come down this morning
[1:41:59] and make his word real to us
[1:42:04] and that's how the impossible will come
[1:42:06] to be possible
[1:42:09] now if we back up we are afraid if we
[1:42:12] come and we are afraid
[1:42:13] you know you know we'll let him do it on
[1:42:15] his own time
[1:42:17] no that's not what he said in fact he
[1:42:19] says one place that there has to be a
[1:42:21] people
[1:42:22] that get tired of the devil kicking
[1:42:24] people around and kinking things around
[1:42:26] i'm telling you i want us to get to that
[1:42:29] place where we just
[1:42:30] get tired of the devil and the things
[1:42:32] that he's doing
[1:42:36] he's got this one he's got that one and
[1:42:39] this one falls
[1:42:40] you know you know i'll say this
[1:42:42] oftentimes we get to a place where
[1:42:45] you know you hear that such and such
[1:42:46] they have fallen away
[1:42:48] you're like oh you know they were not
[1:42:49] safe anyway
[1:42:55] yeah i knew i knew they were going to
[1:42:56] get there
[1:42:58] really what happened to
[1:43:03] i'm going after them
[1:43:06] what happened to i'm not going to let
[1:43:08] the devil take this one
[1:43:11] what happened to i'm going to manifest
[1:43:13] the kingdom of my father
[1:43:15] what happened to that just perseverance
[1:43:18] what happened to that just resolve to
[1:43:20] see god come and move in on it
[1:43:27] it says it continues on
[1:43:30] it says it says and the thing
[1:43:34] and the thing that anything that
[1:43:37] in the things that i do you shall do
[1:43:39] also he says after the resurrection
[1:43:42] if he was supposed to do if he was
[1:43:45] supposed to do
[1:43:46] that spirit that was sent back that was
[1:43:50] in christ came back upon the church
[1:43:52] and was to do the same works that jesus
[1:43:54] did when he was
[1:43:56] on earth when he was here on earth to
[1:43:58] make the covenant with people
[1:44:00] exactly the same with the same body it
[1:44:03] says this is the physical body now
[1:44:05] the physical body of christ now and when
[1:44:08] he is when when it is resurrected it
[1:44:12] goes to meet
[1:44:13] he goes to meet its mate christ jesus
[1:44:16] the husband and the wife as kings and
[1:44:19] and queen
[1:44:20] it's the same material that was in the
[1:44:23] body
[1:44:24] it is the same body of believer the same
[1:44:27] spirit that was in christ
[1:44:28] is in us doing the same works and
[1:44:32] and and if christ keeps his word
[1:44:41] i'll close with this if the musician
[1:44:43] could come
[1:44:50] he says
[1:44:53] we at the end time listen
[1:44:58] that's what the holy ghost does the holy
[1:45:00] ghost by
[1:45:02] justification just the light
[1:45:06] just as light shadows of it
[1:45:09] the holy ghost by sanctification a
[1:45:11] little deeper shadow of it
[1:45:13] the holy ghost but the baptism of it
[1:45:17] the deeper shadow now the holy ghost by
[1:45:20] restoration of
[1:45:21] every person being here
[1:45:25] forming the signs and wonders that he
[1:45:28] did in the beginning
[1:45:30] glory to god
