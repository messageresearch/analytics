[26:11] Who giveth this woman to be married to
[26:15] this man?
[27:09] You may be seated.
[27:26] Beloved, we are gathered here together
[27:30] in the sight of God and the presence of
[27:33] this company
[27:35] to join together this man and this woman
[27:39] in a holy matrimony
[27:41] which is commanded by St. born to be
[27:45] honorable among all men.
[28:08] It is therefore not by any means to be
[28:12] entered into unadvisably or lightly, but
[28:17] reverently,
[28:18] discreetly,
[28:20] soberly, and in the fear of God.
[28:42] Let us stand to ask God his blessing on
[28:46] this wedding ceremony.
[28:52] ceremony.
[28:58] Our precious and heavenly father,
[29:07] how grateful we are to be gathered here
[29:10] today
[29:17] for this wedding ceremony.
[29:21] The marage
[29:23] of Clever and Rebecca. The clever.
[29:30] Lord, we want to give you the full
[29:32] control of this ceremony
[29:39] that it may be to your honor and glory.
[29:46] This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ.
[29:52] Amen.
[29:54] You may be seated.
[30:04] It is a joy for me to take part in this
[30:07] wedding ceremony
[30:09] of Clever Aaron Mccori
[30:14] and Fallon Rebecca.
[30:20] participa.
[30:32] I thank Pastor David Mguri of Christian
[30:35] Life Tabernacle for asking me to perform
[30:40] the ceremony in English and in French.
[30:45] Pastor David
[30:56] France.
[30:59] I have known Rebecca and her family for
[31:02] several years in Switzerland.
[31:06] I had the privilege of baptizing her in
[31:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[31:12] being her pastor.
[31:15] We have appreciated
[31:17] her seriousness and dedication in her
[31:20] walk with Lord Jesus. We have seen her
[31:24] grow in the faith.
[31:58] Rebecca introduced me to Clever after
[32:02] meeting him in the States in 2024.
[32:05] before
[32:07] I had some enjoyable chats with him on
[32:10] the phone and found him to be a very
[32:13] congenial and spiritual man who loves
[32:17] the word of God.
[32:41] originally from Zimbabwe.
[32:44] He has grown spiritually under the
[32:47] ministry of pastor David Mgari for
[32:51] several years.
[32:54] Zimbabwe
[33:00] David.
[33:04] After much prayer, they felt it was
[33:08] God's perfect will for them to unite
[33:11] their lives in holy matrimony on this
[33:15] day.
[33:30] They are surrounded by their parents,
[33:34] family members, friends, brothers and
[33:38] sisters in Christ here and in Zimbabwe,
[33:43] Switzerland, France.
[33:46] Brother Clever's father and siblings are
[33:49] streaming the ceremony from Zimbabwe.
[33:54] Thank you for coming.
[34:08] France
[34:16] Zimbabwe
[34:18] mercy.
[34:22] They want to build a strong marriage
[34:26] founded on the word of God with the Lord
[34:29] Jesus Christ in the center of their
[34:32] home.
[34:47] We pray that the love of God will seal
[34:52] the union today.
[35:05] If there is anyone here that can show a
[35:09] just cause
[35:11] why they should not be lawfully joined
[35:14] together in this holy matrimony.
[35:19] Do you now speak
[35:21] or from hereafter forever hold your
[35:26] peace.
[35:49] I will require and will charge you both
[35:53] as you will surely answer at the day of
[35:56] judgment when and the secrets of all
[35:59] hearts shall be disclosed.
[36:02] If there is either of you that knows any
[36:04] impediment why you should not be
[36:07] lawfully joined together in this holy
[36:10] matrimony,
[36:11] do you now confess it?
[36:15] For be it assured unto you that any
[36:18] couple that is joined otherwise then
[36:22] God's word do that allow their marriage
[36:26] is not lawful.
[36:51] Mountain
[37:02] Nepa valid.
[37:07] Every wedding
[37:09] is beautiful.
[37:11] Do you agree with me?
[37:20] Everyone is welldressed.
[37:26] The flowers they flur,
[37:29] the smiles,
[37:35] the joy,
[37:37] the excitement
[37:40] lexit
[37:42] as Christians, it makes us think about
[37:46] the greatest wedding ceremony ever.
[38:00] the marriage of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:04] and his bride.
[38:16] The Bible speaks of it.
[38:20] It says that blessed are those who have
[38:23] been called to this marriage.
[38:31] Jesus told us how to prepare ourselves
[38:35] for this great event.
[38:44] In Revelation 21:9,
[38:47] we read, "And there came unto me one of
[38:50] the seven angels, which had the seven
[38:53] vials full of the seven plagues, and
[38:57] talked with me, and saying, Come hither.
[39:00] I will show thee the bride,
[39:04] the lamb's wife."
[39:08] The apocalypse enough.
[39:31] For the two to become one, they have to
[39:36] be compatible.
[39:45] Compatible means to be able to exist and
[39:49] perform in an harmonious and agreeable
[39:54] combination.
[40:11] Brother Brham describes to us the lamb
[40:16] nature.
[40:22] It forfeits its rights.
[40:28] It gives what it has.
[40:35] It doesn't fight in a
[40:39] surreners.
[40:43] It's humble.
[40:49] A lamb can only marry a hu lamb.
[41:03] The bride will marry Christ the lamb.
[41:12] She will not marry the lion.
[41:17] Even though Christ is also the lion of
[41:19] the tribe of Judah.
[41:26] But when the Bible speaks about
[41:29] heavenly spiritual marriage
[41:35] spiritual,
[41:36] it speaks about the lamb, Christ the
[41:39] lamb marrying his wife.
[41:49] So please remember that
[41:59] Marriage is a union of two compatible
[42:02] natures.
[42:04] And God is working with each one of us
[42:08] to mold into us the lamb, the lamb's
[42:13] nature.
[42:23] He has to humble us.
[42:29] He has to break us
[42:35] and fill us with the divine nature.
[42:42] Can you say amen to that?
[42:47] It's a wedding ceremony, but uh we are
[42:50] Christians. We want to uh to express
[42:52] what we believe.
[42:57] Amen.
[43:00] This spiritual marriage has to last for
[43:03] eternity.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Christ cannot
[43:13] make a mistake.
[43:20] It is sealed with divine agape love
[43:30] which is eternal eternal.
[43:34] Agape love is unconditional
[43:39] agape
[43:42] like the marriage covenant.
[43:48] It is stable
[43:52] doesn't have ups and downs.
[43:57] Stable.
[44:02] Do we need it?
[44:05] Oh God help us.
[44:08] It has no beginning and no end.
[44:16] It is not selfish in a posist.
[44:20] It is altruistic.
[44:22] Altruist.
[44:24] It expresses God's characteristics.
[44:30] Characteristic the Jew.
[44:33] The marriage of Clever and Rebecca is a
[44:37] type of the marriage of Christ and his
[44:41] bride.
[44:44] Clever.
[44:51] We pray that clever will be a worthy
[44:56] representation
[44:57] of Christ for Rebecca.
[45:02] Clever
[45:09] and Rebecca,
[45:11] a worthy representation
[45:14] of the bride for clever
[45:18] represent
[45:21] clever.
[45:26] Marriage is more than a wedding.
[45:33] Amen. In English you have two words,
[45:37] wedding, marriage,
[45:41] wedding
[45:44] and marriage.
[45:47] But a wedding is just a ceremony.
[45:55] But marriage
[45:57] is a union
[46:00] of two different people
[46:03] becoming one again
[46:07] to be complimentary
[46:25] And this is something I learned from the
[46:27] message of the hour.
[46:32] The Bible says that in the very
[46:34] beginning,
[46:36] God created one human being.
[46:45] And that human being who was in his
[46:48] image and after his likeness,
[46:54] he had both the masculine and the
[46:58] feminine attributes in one body.
[47:07] The rest of the animals came by pairs.
[47:16] But when God made someone in his image,
[47:22] he made one being
[47:27] who had the characteristics of both.
[47:34] And what did God do according to the
[47:35] Bible?
[47:39] God put Adam to sleep
[47:43] and while he was sleeping, he pulled out
[47:46] of him the feminate attributes
[47:56] and he put them in a separate body.
[48:03] And when Adam woke up
[48:07] here stood in front of him, someone
[48:11] looking like him.
[48:17] It was his other half.
[48:23] And Adam under the inspiration of the
[48:25] Holy Spirit,
[48:29] he said, "She is flesh of my flesh.
[48:35] bone of my bones.
[48:38] Amen.
[48:41] To me, this is the beauty of a marriage
[48:44] according to the will of God.
[48:50] And then these two had to become one
[48:54] again.
[49:01] They were one,
[49:03] they were separated and they became one
[49:07] again.
[49:14] That's the way I I understand it.
[49:18] Oh, it's so beautiful.
[49:22] What God does
[49:24] is perfect. Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Hallelujah.
[49:32] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[49:35] It is a soulmating.
[49:41] It is the beginning of a lifong
[49:44] process.
[49:49] V
[49:51] on this day they're officially getting
[49:54] married in the presence of God and of
[49:56] this company
[50:03] but the real union.
[50:07] It will take a lifetime.
[50:16] In the home of brother David and sister
[50:19] Julia, I was watching Sister Lilian
[50:23] putting together a 1,000piece puzzle.
[50:40] Think about it. A thousand pieces.
[50:45] There were many options.
[50:49] But which piece is compatible with
[50:52] which?
[50:58] I've been watching her the last few
[51:00] days.
[51:03] It takes time, a lot of time,
[51:09] patience,
[51:13] and perseverance.
[51:16] Perseverance.
[51:18] God is the mastermind
[51:22] who knows which piece has to go with
[51:26] which piece.
[51:35] God makes no mistake.
[51:40] So is it in the body of Christ and the
[51:43] function of each member.
[51:53] Marriage is a challenge.
[52:02] Amen.
[52:05] As beautiful as it is, he broke his
[52:08] word. It is a challenge.
[52:14] It's taking a big big step of faith.
[52:28] Probably this is why many don't even
[52:30] marry anymore.
[52:35] They are afraid is
[52:40] so taking a big step of faith as no one
[52:45] but God knows the future.
[53:01] That is why it's so important to pray
[53:05] earnestly about it.
[53:14] And when God gives the okay, the
[53:16] revelation, we can go ahead and God will
[53:20] make it work.
[53:34] Psalm 37:4 says, "Delight thyself in the
[53:39] Lord, and he shall give you the desires
[53:44] of your heart.
[54:04] They can be two great persons on the
[54:07] outside.
[54:09] I've watched Sister Rebecca.
[54:16] She's a wonderful lady.
[54:20] For me, I've got to to meet and to know
[54:25] a bit rather clever. But a good man he
[54:28] is.
[54:32] Don't they look good?
[54:39] I know.
[54:41] And they are gifted.
[54:44] They are very skilled in in their field.
[54:52] God has blessed them, you know, in in
[54:54] their work.
[54:58] But once married,
[55:02] will their hearts beat in unison for the
[55:06] rest of their lives?
[55:22] People can have beautiful
[55:24] wedding ceremonies.
[55:38] It's more than the ceremony.
[55:45] Marriage creates a synergy
[55:49] to express each person's potential.
[56:03] May I give a little testimony to the
[56:05] glory of God?
[56:09] you.
[56:11] 55 years ago,
[56:13] God took a young Christian man in
[56:17] Switzerland,
[56:19] 20 years old, and sent him to Tucson,
[56:22] Arizona,
[56:24] to learn more about the message of the
[56:26] hour brought by God's end time prophet,
[56:30] William Brham.
[56:49] William Brana.
[56:52] Shortly after his arrival, God brought
[56:55] into the church he was in, a young
[56:59] Catholic lady, 18 years old.
[57:10] Right away the Lord started dealing with
[57:14] her immediate.
[57:17] She surrendered her life to Jesus
[57:20] Christ, was born again and filled with
[57:22] the Holy Spirit.
[57:31] This young man had started to translate
[57:34] the film
[57:36] The Deep Calling to the Deep, but he was
[57:40] hindered by certain American expressions
[57:44] he had not learned at school.
[58:00] This young lady had just graduated.
[58:08] It was the summer holiday.
[58:13] Having studied French for four years,
[58:17] she offered to help him translate the
[58:19] film.
[58:25] film.
[58:27] Four months later, they got married and
[58:30] are still married 55 years later.
[58:43] and record the message in French.
[58:52] Isn't it God's predestination?
[58:57] His grace, his workmanship,
[59:03] it's possible.
[59:06] Now,
[59:08] let's look at clever.
[59:13] born in Zimbabwe and moving to the
[59:16] states
[59:17] Zimbabwe.
[59:23] Rebecca born in Congo
[59:27] and moving to Switzerland.
[59:33] They met two years ago and were
[59:35] attracted to each other.
[59:44] Was it God
[59:47] or just human feelings?
[59:55] Today
[59:57] they are standing here to be married.
[1:00:06] They have human love for each other.
[1:00:15] It is selfish. It is fragile,
[1:00:19] selfish and shortlasting.
[1:00:22] Fragile, egoist.
[1:00:28] But the Holy Spirit brings divine agape
[1:00:31] love.
[1:00:36] It lasts forever.
[1:00:40] It is unselfish.
[1:00:44] It is the bond to perfection.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; We pray it will seal the union forever.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; The strength
[1:01:03] and durability of their marriage. I
[1:01:07] repeat, the strength and durability of
[1:01:10] their marriage will depend upon their
[1:01:15] personal relationship with the Lord
[1:01:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe.
[1:01:23] Our
[1:01:38] love,
[1:01:40] prayers and support
[1:01:43] will accompany them.
[1:01:52] Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Will you pray for them?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Will you encourage them?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Will you support them?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; They will need you. Is wonderful. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; You agree? You agree?
[1:02:14] We need one another more than ever
[1:02:16] before.
[1:02:23] Okay, clever.
[1:02:26] W thou have this woman to be thy wedded
[1:02:30] wife to live together after God's
[1:02:33] ordinance in the holy estate of
[1:02:35] matrimony
[1:02:37] with thou? Love her, comfort her, honor
[1:02:41] and keep her in sickness and in health,
[1:02:44] and forsaking all others, keep thee only
[1:02:48] unto her, so long as ye both both shall
[1:02:52] live. Clever.
[1:03:19] Amen.
[1:03:28] Rebecca,
[1:03:30] wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded
[1:03:34] husband to live together after God's
[1:03:37] ordance in the holy estate of matrimony?
[1:03:40] Would thou obey and serve him? Love,
[1:03:43] honor, and keep him in sickness and in
[1:03:46] health, and forsaking all others, keep
[1:03:49] thee only unto him so long as he both
[1:03:52] shall live.
[1:04:16] Amen.
[1:04:25] The couple will now exchange devours
[1:04:30] as we stand before God, the author of
[1:04:33] marriage.
[1:04:43] Jesus said that every idle word that men
[1:04:48] shall speak,
[1:04:50] they shall give account thereof in the
[1:04:53] day of judgment.
[1:04:56] For by thy words thou shalt be
[1:05:00] justified,
[1:05:02] and by thy words thou shalt be
[1:05:05] condemned.
[1:05:30] God's prophet said, "Here is when you
[1:05:34] are really married. You are married when
[1:05:38] you vow one to the other. When you
[1:05:41] promise one another that you'll take one
[1:05:45] another.
[1:05:47] As far as married, when you promise her,
[1:05:51] she takes your word, you take her word,
[1:05:57] and God takes both your word.
[1:06:06] Prophet
[1:06:29] accept
[1:06:35] you accept. except
[1:06:40] Jesus also said, "Whatsoever
[1:06:45] you shall bind on earth shall be bound
[1:06:49] in heaven."
[1:07:01] For the sake of the French-speaking
[1:07:03] congregation, I will tell the vows in
[1:07:06] French first, then in English.
[1:07:18] Mayor,
[1:07:39] I clever take thee, Rebecca. I clever
[1:07:42] take the Rebecca
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; to be my wed wife
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; to be my wed wife.

[1:11:44] Let us pray together for this couple.
[1:11:48] Our
[1:11:57] precious
[1:11:59] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:12:05] The Bible says that God is love.
[1:12:14] Real love, eternal love.
[1:12:21] There's no greater love than God's love.
[1:12:29] And Lord, we stand here as witnesses
[1:12:34] of this ceremony of this marriage.
[1:12:42] The ceremony
[1:12:45] as we see Clever and Rebecca
[1:12:50] expressing
[1:12:52] their commitment one to the other.
[1:12:56] Clever.
[1:13:02] We ask the God
[1:13:09] stand behind their words.
[1:13:18] These are human words.
[1:13:23] But Lord, if you anoint these words,
[1:13:29] they will stand true forever.
[1:13:44] Oh God,
[1:13:46] fill them with your Holy Spirit.
[1:13:54] It's only if you express yourself
[1:13:58] through them that their marriage will be
[1:14:01] solid.
[1:14:08] You are the one who gives durability
[1:14:12] to a commitment
[1:14:15] durability.
[1:14:18] So, oh God,
[1:14:20] be with them and help them.
[1:14:28] Only you, Lord, knows what lays ahead of
[1:14:31] them.
[1:14:33] said,
[1:14:36] "But Lord, they are putting their whole
[1:14:38] trust in you."
[1:14:40] But
[1:14:44] you know the future
[1:14:48] and they trust you
[1:14:52] and we believe that everything will be
[1:14:55] all right.
[1:15:03] Oh God, use their lives as a living
[1:15:07] testimony of your grace.
[1:15:15] The world in which we live needs to find
[1:15:18] and to see reality.
[1:15:25] in reality.
[1:15:27] Oh God, use them
[1:15:31] in sincerity,
[1:15:33] in genuiness
[1:15:34] to express your reality.
[1:15:48] Lord, we we just commit them into your
[1:15:50] hands.
[1:15:53] Bless their parents,
[1:15:56] their relatives,
[1:15:58] family, their friends, their loved ones,
[1:16:04] the members of the body of Christ.
[1:16:08] Oh God, use them to your glory.
[1:16:15] Lord, you have a plan for them.
[1:16:19] If it be your will, give them beautiful
[1:16:22] children.
[1:16:27] Lord, we know you always give us the
[1:16:29] best.
[1:16:34] Oh God, receive our praise and our
[1:16:38] thanksgivings.
[1:16:40] Oh,
[1:16:45] our gratefulness
[1:16:49] because what we have been doing here has
[1:16:52] been according to your word
[1:16:57] and it pleases you.
[1:17:02] And Lord, may we all be inspired today.
[1:17:10] And may our love for one another be
[1:17:13] rekindled.
[1:17:19] Oh God,
[1:17:22] only perfect love will enter there.
[1:17:32] Lord, we ask all these things for your
[1:17:35] honor and glory.
[1:17:41] In the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:45] Christ.
[1:17:52] Amen.

[1:21:51] have witnessed the same before God and

[1:21:56] and pledged their faithfulness to each
[1:21:58] other and have declared the same by

[1:22:08] they are husband and wife in the name of
[1:22:12] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:22:25] What therefore God has joined together,
