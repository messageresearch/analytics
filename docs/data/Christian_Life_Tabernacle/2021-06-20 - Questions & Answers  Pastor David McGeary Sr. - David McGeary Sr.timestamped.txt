[22:13] amen good to be gathering the house of
[22:14] god this morning man you want to welcome
[22:17] all our visitors
[22:18] god bless you this morning and please
[22:20] invite by the mic for our song meeting
[22:24] amen
[22:40] good morning we're going to be
[22:44] reading in psalm 110 this morning
[22:50] you know this is a scripture that has
[22:52] some familiar verses to us
[22:54] i'm sure we all recognize the opening
[22:57] verse of the chapter
[22:59] it says in verse 1 the lord said unto my
[23:02] lord
[23:03] sit thou at my right hand until i make
[23:07] thine enemies thy
[23:08] footstool you know we've heard many
[23:10] sermons about the scripture
[23:12] you know no doubt we rejoice in the
[23:16] idea that there was one who was sent
[23:19] who completed a redemption work who
[23:22] defeated
[23:23] every foe and now sits at the right hand
[23:27] of the throne you know and one by
[23:30] and there he sits until one by one
[23:32] things are brought under subjection
[23:34] to him you know what's so
[23:38] amazing though that this was written by
[23:40] david
[23:42] perhaps a thousand years before jesus
[23:44] ever came on the scene
[23:47] you know giving us an appreciation i
[23:49] think for the things he was speaking in
[23:51] the psalms
[23:52] under a prophetic gift you know i
[23:55] started to think about that declaration
[23:57] sit thou at my right hand until i make
[24:00] thine enemies
[24:02] thy footstool jesus said a couple things
[24:05] in in john
[24:06] chapter 5 he said in verse 22 for the
[24:10] father
[24:10] judgeth no man but hath committed all
[24:14] judgment
[24:15] unto the son and then he says in verse
[24:18] 27 and hath given him
[24:20] the son authority to execute
[24:24] judgment also because he
[24:27] is the son of man so we know that his
[24:31] work
[24:32] involves executing judgment
[24:35] you know judgment is someone under
[24:37] authority putting
[24:38] something or someone in its rightful
[24:41] place under the law
[24:44] that's what that's what the act of
[24:45] judgment is whether the declaration is
[24:47] innocence
[24:48] or guilt whether it's clean or unclean
[24:52] judgment is the declaration of your
[24:55] position
[24:56] under the law
[24:59] you know but i wanted to focus just a
[25:00] little bit on that idea of judgment
[25:02] if we look at psalm 110 which we're
[25:04] going to read this morning
[25:08] you know he describes the work
[25:11] of the son of man in the terms of
[25:13] judgment he describes his work like any
[25:15] job that somebody has
[25:16] when you have work to do there's the
[25:18] work that you do
[25:20] the workplace that you do it in and the
[25:22] tool that you use to do the job
[25:24] and psalm 110 describes his work his
[25:27] workplace
[25:29] and the tools that he uses to do the job
[25:32] you know his workplace in verse one is
[25:35] at my right hand
[25:37] that's the place where he's doing the
[25:39] work is at the right hand
[25:41] of the throne most of the chapter as
[25:44] we'll read
[25:45] is describing his work which involves
[25:48] judgment
[25:49] it says in verse 6 for example he will
[25:52] judge among the heathen
[25:54] so we'll go and we'll read and we'll see
[25:56] some of these examples but
[25:58] what's interesting is he also mentions
[26:00] the tools that he uses
[26:02] to do the job and that's in verse 2 it
[26:05] says the lord
[26:06] shall send the rod of thy strength
[26:10] out of zion rule thou
[26:13] in the midst of thine enemies you know
[26:16] the thing about
[26:18] he's the tool that he's using is a rod
[26:20] it's just a rod
[26:22] it's just a stick you know
[26:26] but what's interesting is the rod has
[26:28] significance in scripture it's mentioned
[26:31] several times it's used as a tool of
[26:35] measurement
[26:36] in leviticus 27 it's used as an eating
[26:39] utensil
[26:41] several times for samuel 14 as an
[26:44] example
[26:45] it's used for chastening and correction
[26:47] we're all probably most familiar with
[26:50] that
[26:52] it's used for comfort it's on 23.
[26:56] it's a token of inheritance and it's a
[26:58] symbol of the family
[27:01] number 17 psalm 74.
[27:05] it's used even for doing something like
[27:07] beating the chaff out of the wheat on
[27:08] the threshing floor isaiah 28
[27:12] it's used for shepherding sheep jews for
[27:14] prying a rock
[27:16] out of the way but
[27:19] a rock a rod is nothing more than a
[27:20] stick
[27:22] if you were to take a rod and set it
[27:23] here in this pulpit it would just
[27:25] sit there it would do none of these
[27:28] things
[27:29] until it's taken into someone's hand
[27:33] and then it becomes the extension of the
[27:35] work that that person is doing
[27:38] if they're doing a chastening work
[27:41] then that rod becomes a rod of
[27:43] chastening
[27:44] if they're doing a comforting work then
[27:47] that rod
[27:48] becomes an extension of their comforting
[27:51] work
[27:52] if it's a measurement tool it becomes an
[27:54] extension
[27:55] of their measurement work but it has no
[27:59] role
[27:59] in and of itself it's just a piece of
[28:02] dead tree flesh
[28:04] just a piece of dead flesh in the hand
[28:06] of someone
[28:08] doing a work and it becomes an extension
[28:11] of
[28:11] that work so in psalm
[28:15] even moses for example that just comes
[28:17] to mind here when he went to the burning
[28:18] bush he went to meet that meeting
[28:20] and he had a stick that was used for
[28:22] shepherding sheep it was a shepherd's
[28:24] rod
[28:24] when he walked away from that pillar of
[28:26] fire it was the rod of god
[28:28] because the work had changed
[28:31] in psalm 110 verse 2 when it says the
[28:33] lord shall send
[28:35] the rod of thy strength out of zion
[28:39] well then that's where that tool comes
[28:41] from
[28:42] and we know that zion is a people so the
[28:45] work that he does
[28:47] as he places all things in its position
[28:50] according to the word is a tool that he
[28:52] picks up and extends
[28:54] out of zion which is a people
[28:57] is there a people here i wonder who have
[28:59] become a tool
[29:01] dead flesh in the hands of the one who
[29:05] is doing a judgment work
[29:07] it's amazing the things that david wrote
[29:10] a thousand years
[29:11] before jesus ever came on the scene
[29:15] you know so my prayer and i hope yours
[29:17] is as well that is i can be that
[29:19] rod that tool that he can use
[29:23] to perform that positioning work in this
[29:26] hour
[29:28] the lord shall send the rod of thy
[29:30] strength out of zion
[29:33] rule thou in the midst of thine enemies
[29:35] his work
[29:37] his workplace and the tool that he uses
[29:40] to do the job
[29:42] let's read psalm 110 together it's just
[29:43] a short psalm
[29:46] starting in verse 1 the lord said unto
[29:49] my lord
[29:50] sit thou at my right hand until i make
[29:53] thine enemies thy footstool
[29:55] the lord shall send the rod of thy
[29:58] strength out of zion
[29:59] rule thou in the midst of thine enemies
[30:02] thy people shall be willing in the day
[30:04] of thy power
[30:06] in the beauties of holiness from the
[30:08] womb of the morning
[30:09] thou hast the dew of thy youth the lord
[30:12] hath sworn
[30:13] and will not repent thou art a priest
[30:16] forever
[30:17] after the order of melchizedek the lord
[30:20] at thy right hand shall strike through
[30:22] kings in the day of his wrath he shall
[30:25] judge among the heathen
[30:27] he shall fill the places with the dead
[30:29] bodies he shall wound the heads over
[30:31] many countries
[30:33] he shall drink of the brook in the way
[30:35] therefore
[30:36] shall he lift up the head amen
[30:42] amen god bless you may have your seats
[30:45] amen
[30:48] man speaking of melchizedek
[30:51] i mean if you haven't if you have a
[30:53] question and hadn't had a chance to
[30:56] submit it you can just go right outside
[30:57] and write it
[30:58] and they're going to take it over to
[30:59] brother david or you can just put it in
[31:02] the bucket outside and
[31:04] if he doesn't get a chance to answer it
[31:06] this morning he'll answer it tonight
[31:07] amen
[31:08] amen how many have enjoyed it was this
[31:10] much yesterday

[58:19] the ones in the future of the lord teres
[58:21] we just love the lord let's approach him
[58:23] this morning in prayer
[58:25] our heavenly father we've come to day
[58:28] in this natural country that we live in
[58:33] has
[58:33] declared this holiday as
[58:38] father's day lord
[58:42] another reason to
[58:46] go out and shop and buy presents and
[58:49] we're grateful for that
[58:52] but father the real father's day is
[58:54] because our father gave us a gift
[58:57] [Music]
[58:59] and lord that's what has brought us here
[59:02] from many different walks of life
[59:05] and many different countries and
[59:10] many different skill level and
[59:12] educational levels
[59:15] because we've all been birthed by one
[59:17] father
[59:19] and that's what makes us one and in one
[59:23] accord
[59:25] we're not a religion we're not a church
[59:29] we're not an educated theological group
[59:35] we are a people we are an offspring
[59:39] of jehovah and lord that makes us
[59:43] brothers and sisters
[59:46] and sisters with the same eternal
[59:48] creator
[59:50] and we ask you to bless us this morning
[59:53] in your great goodness in jesus
[59:56] precious and holy name we pray
[1:00:00] amen amen
[1:00:03] god bless you this morning we're going
[1:00:06] to
[1:00:07] try to do some questions and answers so
[1:00:09] let's turn in our bibles
[1:00:12] and uh over to
[1:00:15] the book of uh
[1:00:20] uh corinthians first corinthians
[1:00:25] and the 15th chapter
[1:00:30] and so our visitors that are uh
[1:00:33] with us today lord rich they bless you
[1:00:36] and and
[1:00:40] i'm sure that there may be things that
[1:00:44] you might hear for the first time and
[1:00:46] and we're grateful for that
[1:00:48] and if i can't answer some of the
[1:00:51] questions
[1:00:52] each one of you has a right to come to
[1:00:54] me and sit down and talk and i'll be
[1:00:56] happy to
[1:00:57] answer any personal questions or further
[1:01:00] clarifications
[1:01:02] that we have but i i'd like you to
[1:01:05] listen as we read this
[1:01:07] portion of scripture because it lets us
[1:01:10] know that we weren't the first people
[1:01:12] to have questions and so when you read
[1:01:16] it it's really amazing
[1:01:18] so let's let's talk about some of the
[1:01:20] things that
[1:01:21] were on the mind of the corinthian
[1:01:24] church
[1:01:26] and the questions that they have
[1:01:30] and and so we read start in the 35th
[1:01:34] verse of the 15th chapter
[1:01:39] of corinthians
[1:01:44] but some men will say how
[1:01:47] are the dead raised up
[1:01:50] and with what body do they
[1:01:54] come way back there
[1:01:58] you know and it says about fool and that
[1:02:02] don't kind of that word they use
[1:02:04] isn't the same way that we use fool
[1:02:07] it's got a little different connotation
[1:02:10] without fool
[1:02:11] that which thou soweth is not quickened
[1:02:15] except it die
[1:02:18] and that which thou soweth
[1:02:21] thou soweth not that body
[1:02:25] that shall be
[1:02:28] but bear grain
[1:02:31] it may change of wheat
[1:02:34] or of some other grain but
[1:02:38] god giveth it a body as it hath
[1:02:41] pleased him and to every seed
[1:02:44] his own body all flesh is not the same
[1:02:49] flesh
[1:02:50] but there is one kind of flesh of men
[1:02:54] another flesh of beast another of fishes
[1:02:58] and another of birds there are celestial
[1:03:02] bodies
[1:03:03] and bodies terrestrial but the glory
[1:03:07] of the celestial is one and the glory of
[1:03:11] the terrestrial is another
[1:03:14] there was one glory of the sun and
[1:03:17] another glory
[1:03:18] of the moon and another glory of the
[1:03:21] stars
[1:03:22] for one star differeth from another
[1:03:26] star in glory
[1:03:29] so also is the resurrection of the dead
[1:03:34] it is sown in corruption it is raised in
[1:03:38] incorruption it is sown in dishonor
[1:03:42] it is raised in glory it is
[1:03:46] sown in weakness it is raised in power
[1:03:51] it is sown a natural body it is raised a
[1:03:55] spiritual body
[1:03:56] there is a natural body there is a
[1:03:59] spiritual body
[1:04:02] and so it is written the first man
[1:04:06] adam was made a living soul
[1:04:09] the second adam was made a quickening
[1:04:13] spirit how be it that
[1:04:16] was not first which is spiritual
[1:04:20] but that which is natural and after
[1:04:23] that which is spiritual the first man
[1:04:27] is of the earth earthly
[1:04:30] the second man is the lord from heaven
[1:04:35] as the earthly such are
[1:04:38] they also that are earthly and
[1:04:42] as the heavenly such are they
[1:04:45] also that are heavenly a great scripture
[1:04:48] of predestination
[1:04:51] and as we have borne the image of the
[1:04:54] earthly
[1:04:56] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:04:58] heavenlies
[1:04:59] now this i say brethren that flesh and
[1:05:02] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[1:05:05] neither does corruption inherit
[1:05:08] incorruption
[1:05:09] father we ask you to bless your word in
[1:05:11] your precious name we pray
[1:05:13] amen god bless you may be seated this
[1:05:20] morning
[1:05:22] we have uh several uh questions this
[1:05:25] morning
[1:05:26] uh and they're good questions
[1:05:30] and all the answers kind of tie together
[1:05:34] this this subject of malchezidak's a
[1:05:36] wonderful subject
[1:05:38] it's just it it it's just so
[1:05:41] rich and it's deep and it's beautiful
[1:05:44] and what we hope in doing this is that
[1:05:48] we can find ourselves in
[1:05:51] the word in the plan of god and you know
[1:05:55] god
[1:05:56] uh he loves us i mean that's
[1:06:00] i don't know why many times you know
[1:06:02] what i mean but
[1:06:04] he has he loves us so much that he gave
[1:06:07] his only begotten son
[1:06:09] for us and we all realize
[1:06:13] that if we look back over time
[1:06:17] we understand that life has progressed
[1:06:21] it progressed and progressed
[1:06:23] and it seems like the longer man lives
[1:06:26] the more trouble that he has
[1:06:30] their sicknesses and diseases like we've
[1:06:33] never seen before and we become
[1:06:36] to the place where we begin to realize
[1:06:40] that we're fragile
[1:06:43] we always have this terminology
[1:06:46] that people different people i know
[1:06:50] use when one of those people will drive
[1:06:53] down the road and
[1:06:55] at alongside you and you're on the
[1:06:57] freeway and
[1:06:59] you're keeping your eye on the
[1:07:00] speedometer because you're right at the
[1:07:02] top of the match you know
[1:07:04] and uh and here comes somebody
[1:07:08] by you on a motorcycle going 120 miles
[1:07:12] an hour on one wheel
[1:07:16] and we would often make the the
[1:07:18] description
[1:07:20] that person has a death wish
[1:07:23] in other words they're they're they're
[1:07:26] dealing
[1:07:27] with death and or they're on the edges
[1:07:31] or the fringes of death
[1:07:35] they don't realize how dangerous what
[1:07:38] they're doing
[1:07:39] or how close to the edge of
[1:07:42] catastrophe they are
[1:07:45] and being in such a precarious
[1:07:48] position and trusting so many people
[1:07:53] around you and you know
[1:07:56] all it would take is one person having a
[1:07:59] bad day
[1:08:00] to just do that little jerk with this
[1:08:03] car
[1:08:03] and and cause something to happen
[1:08:07] so we're aware of that there's an acute
[1:08:09] awareness when
[1:08:11] something like that happens that it
[1:08:13] brings a sense to you
[1:08:15] well that's crazy that that's flirting
[1:08:17] with death
[1:08:18] that's playing with death well there's
[1:08:20] one thing
[1:08:21] certain for all of us we're all playing
[1:08:23] with death
[1:08:26] i don't care how far you go back in your
[1:08:28] lineage
[1:08:29] i don't have a father today to call
[1:08:33] because my father's passed on my natural
[1:08:36] father
[1:08:36] i do have a heavenly father that i can
[1:08:40] call
[1:08:40] but we realize that there is a time
[1:08:44] that our time on earth is done
[1:08:47] and we are not here this morning to
[1:08:52] prepare for the
[1:08:55] time allotted to us in this life
[1:08:58] your parents were given to you to do
[1:09:01] that
[1:09:01] school was given to you that you made
[1:09:04] those life
[1:09:05] choices of picking your occupation
[1:09:08] picking your education
[1:09:10] picking your mates picking the places
[1:09:13] that
[1:09:13] you choose to live and those are your
[1:09:17] life
[1:09:17] choices that you make we're here to
[1:09:22] talk about something eternal
[1:09:25] because the choices that you make in
[1:09:27] this life
[1:09:28] not only have your life consequences but
[1:09:31] they have eternal
[1:09:33] consequences the wages of sin
[1:09:36] is death and and
[1:09:39] the another word for sin is unbelief
[1:09:43] you know of murder robbery
[1:09:46] all those what we would call crimes or
[1:09:49] those are the attributes of sin they're
[1:09:52] not
[1:09:53] sin sin is unbelief
[1:09:56] and one that doesn't believe
[1:10:00] in eternity and doesn't believe
[1:10:03] in life after death that disbelief
[1:10:07] will cause them to live a life that will
[1:10:10] lead them to death
[1:10:11] because there's no regard for somebody
[1:10:15] that's eternal
[1:10:17] there's no regard for the maker
[1:10:20] there's no regard for the creator
[1:10:23] and there's no regard for
[1:10:26] why that he made things and so
[1:10:30] he's not brought into the conversation
[1:10:33] and that's what the word of god says he
[1:10:35] says not wishing to retain
[1:10:37] god in their knowledge
[1:10:40] so they no longer wanted to think about
[1:10:42] god they didn't want to consider
[1:10:44] god in their life choices i'm going to
[1:10:48] make this
[1:10:48] choice how does it affect me eternally
[1:10:52] how does it prepare me for life after
[1:10:55] death
[1:10:56] and they don't they no longer wish to
[1:10:58] retain that
[1:10:59] in their thinking so god gives them over
[1:11:02] to
[1:11:03] a reprobate mind another a mind
[1:11:06] that doesn't consider spiritual things
[1:11:09] so
[1:11:10] everything in their life becomes carnal
[1:11:12] how much money i can make how much
[1:11:14] prestige i can gain
[1:11:16] how much pleasure i can
[1:11:20] receive and their lives are motivated by
[1:11:23] carnal things and the scripture tells us
[1:11:26] that to be
[1:11:27] carnally minded is to be an enemy of god
[1:11:32] because god created us for a purpose
[1:11:35] and part of that purpose god's purpose
[1:11:38] was us to have an eternal side
[1:11:42] of our life so god never intended us
[1:11:45] just to live in this flesh only
[1:11:48] just to have 70 years on earth
[1:11:51] or or longer uh uh
[1:11:55] you know i'm i'm only 71 i'll be 72 in
[1:11:58] october
[1:11:59] uh one poor brother the other day
[1:12:02] thought i was too old to eat steak
[1:12:04] and so no i i still got my teeth they're
[1:12:08] they're a little wore out but uh uh
[1:12:12] you know i i hope god allots me a lot of
[1:12:15] years you know
[1:12:16] i hope when he takes me home i'm still
[1:12:18] mentally capable
[1:12:20] of preaching the gospel but but we're
[1:12:23] here
[1:12:24] to talk about eternal
[1:12:28] and part of this eternal question
[1:12:32] was even raised back there
[1:12:36] when men begin to talk about the
[1:12:38] resurrection
[1:12:40] because not everybody believed in the
[1:12:42] resurrection but
[1:12:43] there were people that believed in the
[1:12:45] resurrection
[1:12:46] and he saved but some men will say
[1:12:50] how are the dead raised up and with what
[1:12:54] body do they come so the the question of
[1:12:58] eternal life is a great question
[1:13:00] and it's a good question to get answered
[1:13:03] and get
[1:13:04] settled in your heart for sure
[1:13:07] you know i have meant people i i as you
[1:13:10] know my testimony
[1:13:12] there was a period in my life where i
[1:13:14] hung around
[1:13:15] with the hells angel motorcycle gang and
[1:13:18] those guys will testify
[1:13:20] right to your face i'm going to hell
[1:13:26] they know it you know what i mean they
[1:13:29] don't
[1:13:30] they don't pretend to be religious you
[1:13:32] know i remember when i first got
[1:13:34] converted i brought
[1:13:36] bibles to the guys i know and i i
[1:13:39] testified them
[1:13:40] to them about the lord and the real guys
[1:13:44] they brought it back to me and handed me
[1:13:48] the bible back and he said man i
[1:13:50] appreciate what you're doing you know as
[1:13:52] far as i'm concerned
[1:13:53] you're forgotten you know you're you
[1:13:55] don't owe us nothing
[1:13:56] you know what i mean you go go serve the
[1:13:59] thing
[1:14:00] you say but this isn't for me it looks
[1:14:02] like i'm just going to hell
[1:14:05] and you know you do anything in your
[1:14:07] life to express
[1:14:09] to them that the love of god is greater
[1:14:12] than any sin
[1:14:13] that they could have ever done that
[1:14:16] that that that's why he came
[1:14:19] and that they were
[1:14:23] trapped in the sin and and it's
[1:14:26] and i wish i would have known back in
[1:14:29] them days about election
[1:14:31] you know possibly i would have had the
[1:14:34] words to
[1:14:35] speak that i could speak past the mind
[1:14:38] to that seed that light in the heart
[1:14:40] and that they would be so generated
[1:14:44] in in the love of god but i'll read you
[1:14:47] the questions and then we'll kind of go
[1:14:49] through them and it says the first
[1:14:53] question in is what is the order of
[1:14:56] melchizedek
[1:14:57] and and then here's another question he
[1:15:00] says
[1:15:01] when melchizedek was in his theophany
[1:15:05] and fellowshipped with abraham did he
[1:15:08] have his five
[1:15:10] natural senses
[1:15:14] another question the question was
[1:15:17] jesus's glorified body
[1:15:20] the same as melchizedek's
[1:15:24] now these are sometimes questions huh i
[1:15:26] hope you didn't expect to get any
[1:15:27] answers for me
[1:15:32] and then this is what is the difference
[1:15:35] between abraham melchizedek
[1:15:39] jesus and brother branham and another
[1:15:43] question is did the fullness of the
[1:15:46] godhead
[1:15:47] bodily dwell in
[1:15:50] brother branham so we'll kind of
[1:15:53] you hold those questions up and we'll
[1:15:56] kind of go through some things
[1:15:58] and within those things trusting that
[1:16:01] we will find the answers but
[1:16:04] let's just take kind of the last
[1:16:07] question
[1:16:07] first because we're going to battle
[1:16:11] something all morning long as we go
[1:16:14] through these answers i'm going to try
[1:16:15] to hurry so
[1:16:17] uh we can try to get out it's a lot to
[1:16:20] cover but
[1:16:22] is we're always going to battle our
[1:16:25] mental conception and our
[1:16:29] definition of words
[1:16:32] okay so paul said here there's a natural
[1:16:36] body
[1:16:38] and a spiritual body so that
[1:16:41] lets us know that there's two types of
[1:16:43] bodies
[1:16:44] now none of us have a clue
[1:16:49] what a spiritual body is
[1:16:54] naturally you know what i'm saying
[1:16:57] we know they exist as some
[1:17:01] you know maybe some of you have had
[1:17:03] dreams and seen things
[1:17:05] maybe some of you have seen spirits
[1:17:07] there's people that have
[1:17:09] gifts to see spirits and and so i know
[1:17:12] that they're real
[1:17:14] and and and in my own way of testifying
[1:17:18] i've seen things that weren't in the
[1:17:20] flesh
[1:17:21] but but everything that we're going to
[1:17:24] relate to
[1:17:25] we only relate to to what that we know
[1:17:28] and what that we sense we have words
[1:17:32] that mean things to us so what is a word
[1:17:36] a word is a thought expressed so i
[1:17:39] try to use a word that expresses my
[1:17:42] thoughts
[1:17:43] but also is a word that connects
[1:17:46] with your thoughts and
[1:17:50] so that's why some people go through
[1:17:52] great dissertations
[1:17:54] and use lots of explanation and lots of
[1:17:58] words and lots of their hand movements
[1:18:00] too
[1:18:01] to try to communicate the thought
[1:18:04] by words and actions so our minds can
[1:18:08] get on the same
[1:18:10] level you know do you get it do you
[1:18:12] understand what i mean
[1:18:13] you know there's some place in there
[1:18:15] there's got to be a satisfaction
[1:18:17] that you've communicated what that
[1:18:20] you're trying to
[1:18:21] express and so this great this is a
[1:18:25] great question
[1:18:27] did the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:18:29] dwell on brother branham
[1:18:31] now we know why that question comes up
[1:18:34] that question comes up because of the
[1:18:37] works
[1:18:38] that god did through him
[1:18:43] we understand in in the scriptures and
[1:18:46] you notice we have this picture here
[1:18:48] which you probably wouldn't find in most
[1:18:51] uh
[1:18:51] christian churches because some people
[1:18:54] would think that
[1:18:54] might be a form of idolatry but
[1:18:58] there's no other savior of man saved the
[1:19:01] lord jesus christ
[1:19:04] what what saved men was
[1:19:07] the sacrifice that was made on
[1:19:10] calvary the blood of the lord jesus
[1:19:13] christ
[1:19:14] that's what forgave us of our sins
[1:19:18] and and that's that's the ultimate
[1:19:22] uh sacrifice that was made on our behalf
[1:19:26] the law of god said that there's a
[1:19:28] punishment for sin
[1:19:30] and so if if there was a punishment made
[1:19:33] for sin
[1:19:34] then everybody would have had to receive
[1:19:37] the punishment of sin
[1:19:38] what was death but if the chastisement
[1:19:42] of
[1:19:42] our peace was upon him in other words
[1:19:45] he paid the price for our sins
[1:19:49] so instead of us taking the reward
[1:19:53] or the just do for our sins he took
[1:19:56] that upon him he paid the price he paid
[1:20:00] the price with his own life
[1:20:01] and he laid that life down for
[1:20:05] us and then he gave us hope by
[1:20:08] resurrecting
[1:20:09] now so we realized that through the
[1:20:11] scriptures there was
[1:20:13] promises made in the word of god and
[1:20:16] after the lord jesus had died and
[1:20:18] resurrected
[1:20:19] he commissioned his prophet and his
[1:20:22] apostles to go into the upper room
[1:20:25] and wait to be endued with power from on
[1:20:27] high
[1:20:28] i will not leave you comfortless but i
[1:20:31] will come again
[1:20:32] i'll be with you even in you till the
[1:20:34] end of the world
[1:20:35] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:20:38] the disciples went up there they were
[1:20:40] restored once again
[1:20:42] with the power of the lord they went out
[1:20:46] and they began to preach the gospel
[1:20:48] every man hearing them
[1:20:50] in their own tongues and signs and
[1:20:52] wonders followed
[1:20:54] without going into lengthy bible
[1:20:56] teachings we understand
[1:20:58] that satan rose up against that
[1:21:01] spirit and he began to move against the
[1:21:04] church
[1:21:04] in four spirits identified in four
[1:21:08] horse riders in the book of revelations
[1:21:11] and he began to politicize things he
[1:21:14] began to join the church and state
[1:21:17] until he formed the catholic church and
[1:21:20] we realized that in the dark ages
[1:21:24] every all religion at that time
[1:21:29] had come under one headship of
[1:21:31] catholicism
[1:21:33] and we understand that was a fulfillment
[1:21:35] of scripture that the seed had to go on
[1:21:37] the ground
[1:21:38] then that life began to come forth in
[1:21:42] luther
[1:21:42] and that life moved on farther through
[1:21:45] wesley
[1:21:46] came back into the restoration of the
[1:21:48] gifts
[1:21:49] at pentecost and then the promise
[1:21:53] in malachi 4 5 is that all that the
[1:21:56] palmer worm and the cankerworm and the
[1:21:58] locusts had eaten
[1:22:00] i will restore saith the lord
[1:22:03] so we understand that the true word of
[1:22:06] god
[1:22:06] because in this age we realized that
[1:22:09] there was going to be a famine
[1:22:11] not only for food but for the pure
[1:22:13] unadulterated word of god
[1:22:15] that god brought forth a ministry
[1:22:19] that would restore back the faith
[1:22:23] or restore back the true revelation
[1:22:26] of the word of god to his elect children
[1:22:30] that the mysteries that those four
[1:22:33] horses that went out in revelation
[1:22:36] covered up and hid every time that horse
[1:22:40] rider went out he robbed something from
[1:22:42] the church
[1:22:43] and he replaced it with something hybrid
[1:22:46] something man-made and then commit and
[1:22:49] then
[1:22:50] so and god would fight it and then he
[1:22:52] would go farther and he
[1:22:53] he rode out in in a a
[1:22:56] a red horse and we realized that that he
[1:23:00] slew he killed everybody that was
[1:23:03] against the catholic church as heretics
[1:23:05] and
[1:23:06] i was a catholic and studied to be a
[1:23:08] priest for one year so
[1:23:10] don't think i'm just anti-catholic i'm
[1:23:12] not anti-catholic i'm
[1:23:14] revelated and and saved
[1:23:18] but i believe catholics can be saved and
[1:23:21] so don't
[1:23:21] that's not the issue it's where they
[1:23:24] stood in history
[1:23:25] they got a vicar of christ the pope
[1:23:28] instead of
[1:23:28] of the lord that they put nickelodeon
[1:23:31] spirit cardinals bishops
[1:23:34] of priests parishes to rule over the
[1:23:37] people
[1:23:38] is a system a denominational system and
[1:23:41] every denomination has come from that
[1:23:43] they're the daughters of of the great
[1:23:46] harlot that's spoken up in the book of
[1:23:48] revelation we're not against the people
[1:23:51] by no means we're against a system
[1:23:54] that blinds the people and
[1:23:57] that's what happened and through that
[1:23:59] time every time he would fight
[1:24:01] man would mix they'd keep mixing their
[1:24:04] ideas their definitions their ideas
[1:24:07] until we got to this age and in this age
[1:24:10] god promised to send a ministry
[1:24:14] that would impersonate
[1:24:18] it and that's not a good word but
[1:24:21] or maybe us the word would be better
[1:24:23] mirror
[1:24:25] the ministry of the lord jesus christ in
[1:24:28] this
[1:24:28] age to the gentiles so
[1:24:32] at the end of the jewish age the lord
[1:24:35] jesus showed up but that was god in
[1:24:37] flesh
[1:24:38] but he his ministry was that as a
[1:24:40] prophet
[1:24:42] that's what they call them rabbi young
[1:24:44] prophet
[1:24:45] and he he he did works he prayed for the
[1:24:47] sick
[1:24:48] he preached the gospel he discerned the
[1:24:50] thoughts and tense of the heart
[1:24:52] he did that to the samaritans and he did
[1:24:55] it to the jews
[1:24:57] representing the three races of people
[1:25:00] handshaft and japan
[1:25:01] but that work and that sign had never
[1:25:05] been
[1:25:05] performed to the gentiles so at the end
[1:25:08] of the gentile age god
[1:25:10] promised to send a ministry back
[1:25:15] that would do the same works
[1:25:18] that jesus did when he was on
[1:25:21] earth to the jew and to the
[1:25:25] samaritan and then he would do it to the
[1:25:29] gentiles
[1:25:30] so the gentiles would have the same
[1:25:33] opportunity
[1:25:34] that the jews had either to accept
[1:25:38] or reject and so that ministry showed up
[1:25:42] right on time right when god promised it
[1:25:45] and it was extremely supernatural
[1:25:49] and so we we understood it as it was in
[1:25:52] the days of noah
[1:25:54] they were married and given into
[1:25:56] marriage so we recognized that that
[1:25:58] description
[1:25:59] of that time had come to full
[1:26:04] nutrition in this age
[1:26:07] where i almost seven out of ten
[1:26:09] marriages fail
[1:26:11] uh there's lots of divorce and and
[1:26:14] remarriage
[1:26:15] that and and that has nothing to do with
[1:26:18] anybody's soul
[1:26:20] okay we're not here to start to figure
[1:26:23] out
[1:26:23] fresh fleshly problems we're here to
[1:26:26] move above the flesh
[1:26:28] you can have a lot of problems in your
[1:26:30] life and get saved
[1:26:32] converted so it it
[1:26:36] it's nobody with a perfect life is going
[1:26:38] to be there
[1:26:39] the scripture says if you say that
[1:26:41] you've sinned not you're a liar
[1:26:44] but we have one that paid the price
[1:26:46] that's a
[1:26:47] mediator a partitionary for us making
[1:26:50] intercession to the father
[1:26:52] on our behalf and then so this
[1:26:55] this ministry that was promised came
[1:26:59] now that
[1:27:02] what was operating that
[1:27:06] ministry was not
[1:27:09] the vessel
[1:27:15] it was the same person
[1:27:20] that was in the lord jesus
[1:27:24] it was that same person that was
[1:27:27] operating that gift else
[1:27:30] it wouldn't have been equal
[1:27:35] so when the jew saw jesus
[1:27:38] they saw a man born
[1:27:42] of a woman
[1:27:45] that's what they saw they knew his
[1:27:46] father their father
[1:27:48] aren't this is james and such and his
[1:27:50] brothers aren't these the guys that we
[1:27:52] know
[1:27:53] up here in nazareth isn't this
[1:27:56] joseph's son some of them sent others
[1:27:59] said
[1:28:00] that he was illegitimate and
[1:28:03] so that's what they saw
[1:28:06] they they saw flesh
[1:28:10] but what was operating in that flesh
[1:28:14] was not the flesh
[1:28:17] okay to answer this question let's turn
[1:28:20] to
[1:28:22] saint john and the 14
[1:28:26] 10.
[1:28:46] let's just start and this is
[1:28:50] we this great uh scripture we'll just
[1:28:54] start with the seventh verse
[1:28:57] if ye had known me you should have known
[1:28:59] my father also
[1:29:02] and from henceforth ye know him
[1:29:06] and have seen him philip said unto
[1:29:10] him lord show us the father and it
[1:29:13] sufficeth us
[1:29:15] jesus said unto him have i been
[1:29:18] so long with you and yet hast thou
[1:29:22] not known me philip he that
[1:29:25] hath seen me hath seen the father
[1:29:29] and how to say is that thou then
[1:29:32] show us the father believeth doubt
[1:29:36] not that i am in
[1:29:40] the father and the father in me
[1:29:44] the words that i speak unto you
[1:29:48] i speak not of myself
[1:29:52] but the father that dwelleth in me
[1:29:56] he doth the works
[1:30:00] believe me that i am in the father and
[1:30:04] the father and me or else believe me
[1:30:07] for the very works sake
[1:30:11] amen and then he goes on to say verily
[1:30:14] verily i send you
[1:30:15] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:30:17] do
[1:30:18] shall he do also greater works than
[1:30:21] these
[1:30:22] because i go unto the father
[1:30:26] and and if so so we see there that
[1:30:30] if they saw a man but what was
[1:30:33] in that man
[1:30:38] was who was doing the works
[1:30:41] so they when brother brown would come to
[1:30:45] a crowd like this
[1:30:46] brother brahm wasn't there to promote
[1:30:48] brother branham
[1:30:50] what he was showing was a
[1:30:53] fulfillment of a promise
[1:30:57] that god made that when the world got in
[1:31:01] a sodom condition
[1:31:03] how many of those were in a sodom
[1:31:05] condition you're marrying
[1:31:07] they're given into marriage and noah
[1:31:09] condition
[1:31:10] they're going to and fro science and
[1:31:13] education is
[1:31:15] multiplying upon the earth that's the
[1:31:17] noah
[1:31:18] condition the sodom condition was the
[1:31:22] the destruction of the morality of
[1:31:24] motherhood
[1:31:27] the misuse of the created form of woman
[1:31:31] and of men and women burning in their
[1:31:35] own lust
[1:31:37] turning their desires to
[1:31:40] one another not wishing to retain
[1:31:44] god in in their knowledge and therefore
[1:31:47] they went into what's called a sodom
[1:31:50] condition
[1:31:51] this country is just like it was in the
[1:31:54] days of sodom
[1:31:55] where um same-sex marriages
[1:31:59] was lawful and legal
[1:32:03] they functions that way it becomes
[1:32:06] normal
[1:32:08] that way the idea that you can choose
[1:32:12] your own identity
[1:32:15] in other words god has no part of your
[1:32:18] creation
[1:32:19] you now can recreate yourself
[1:32:25] i mean this is the truth i'm sorry i
[1:32:27] hate the i
[1:32:28] i hate that it's even a subject matter
[1:32:30] that i've got to discuss
[1:32:32] too many of the pulpits in this country
[1:32:34] today
[1:32:35] are too weak to address them and the
[1:32:40] scripture
[1:32:40] says when they get there they're going
[1:32:42] to gnash upon them with their teeth
[1:32:44] and they're going to wonder how come you
[1:32:46] didn't tell us the truth
[1:32:49] but it's insane for a parent to tell
[1:32:52] of their child that when you get old
[1:32:55] enough you choose whether you want to be
[1:32:57] a boy or a girl
[1:32:58] right then they've they have not
[1:33:01] taken the leadership to raise that child
[1:33:05] with any kind of character a real
[1:33:08] christian mother
[1:33:09] raises that daughter to be a mother she
[1:33:12] teaches her
[1:33:13] how to be subject to authority how to
[1:33:15] honor and respect
[1:33:18] what it means to labor and be satisfied
[1:33:24] and i know our our sisters
[1:33:28] some of them have to work because they
[1:33:29] don't have husbands
[1:33:31] and i understand that and
[1:33:35] if you can get a little bit of school
[1:33:37] and and get a little better job or you
[1:33:39] have a little better control of your
[1:33:41] environment
[1:33:42] i'm all for that i think it's hard for a
[1:33:45] christian girl to be a waitress for
[1:33:48] example
[1:33:49] you know where she gets all kinds of
[1:33:50] people and all kinds of sassary marks
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:53] and all kinds of into windows thrown at
[1:33:56] them and
[1:33:57] and put them stuff but if you get
[1:33:59] something that you can be in a place in
[1:34:01] a
[1:34:01] workplace that you can call the
[1:34:03] environment because you have to make a
[1:34:05] living that's fine
[1:34:07] if you're in a position of authority and
[1:34:09] you're
[1:34:10] a sister and you don't have a husband
[1:34:12] yet you conduct yourself as a christian
[1:34:16] you don't observe authority with
[1:34:17] bitterness in your heart
[1:34:19] and in those things you you act like a
[1:34:21] lady you treat other people like the
[1:34:24] lady
[1:34:24] you do your job as unto the lord all
[1:34:27] those things are
[1:34:28] are life situations that we un that
[1:34:31] we understand and and and we're not
[1:34:34] condemning them but you can't raise a
[1:34:36] child
[1:34:37] in the way it should go
[1:34:41] isn't that a scripture didn't i used to
[1:34:43] re hear that scripture
[1:34:46] if you don't know what it is
[1:34:49] you might as well give it a dog bone and
[1:34:51] put their food in a dish
[1:34:58] no it's the truth
[1:35:01] you know you can't even how can a man
[1:35:02] really preach the gospel
[1:35:04] if he can't tell women how to conduct
[1:35:06] themselves as women and dress like a
[1:35:08] woman
[1:35:09] that's why we don't wear those high
[1:35:10] heels that's why we don't wear those
[1:35:12] clothes that's why we don't wear those
[1:35:13] seedless
[1:35:14] things we don't look wear low-cut
[1:35:16] blouses we don't
[1:35:17] lean anything we never present our
[1:35:19] sexuality
[1:35:20] out in any form that it can be looked
[1:35:23] upon
[1:35:24] that the adultery would be committed
[1:35:29] you know everybody thinks it's your
[1:35:31] choice it's not our choice
[1:35:33] it's his choice and his choice was the
[1:35:35] word of god
[1:35:37] and that's what we live by we live by
[1:35:39] the word of god
[1:35:40] but once you take the core root out of
[1:35:43] the word of god that he made them male
[1:35:45] and female
[1:35:46] then you've taken him out of the whole
[1:35:48] plan of
[1:35:50] of of redemption you've taken
[1:35:53] him out of the whole plan you can't even
[1:35:56] say that he planned or predestinated
[1:35:58] your life
[1:35:59] because now they've taken it and put it
[1:36:02] into your hands
[1:36:03] well i know me i don't want my life
[1:36:06] in my hands i've already messed it up
[1:36:10] enough
[1:36:17] that's all part of the answer
[1:36:23] this is from things that are to be
[1:36:26] so we we we understood that there was a
[1:36:28] man that stood here in this day
[1:36:30] fulfilling the promises of the word of
[1:36:32] god the lord jesus christ
[1:36:34] was doing the works through his body
[1:36:38] so god was veiled in flesh
[1:36:43] okay he promised to appear in this day
[1:36:46] in the ministry of a prophet
[1:36:50] prophet son of man in the days
[1:36:53] when i'm revealed
[1:36:57] in the ministry of the son of man
[1:37:00] so the same spirit that was in the lord
[1:37:02] jesus the same ministry that was there
[1:37:05] came in this day veiled himself
[1:37:09] in a man man
[1:37:12] m-a-n and this will answer the question
[1:37:16] let's just get this one
[1:37:17] we'll go to the next one it says this is
[1:37:21] from things that are to be
[1:37:23] therefore the bride in the rapture
[1:37:27] will come forth and there is
[1:37:30] and there is all pre-planned
[1:37:34] by god all backed up from the beginning
[1:37:38] he knowed every man every place
[1:37:42] who would set all about it it's all
[1:37:45] pre-planned
[1:37:46] god knew it would be here
[1:37:50] and when he made it that way so that
[1:37:53] when we
[1:37:54] get there he's going to prepare a place
[1:37:58] for us
[1:37:59] when we get there it'll all be prepared
[1:38:03] just like even this night is prepared
[1:38:07] like this hour is prepared yes his great
[1:38:10] foreknowledge tells him all these things
[1:38:14] by foreknowledge he's omnipresent
[1:38:19] because he's omnipotent
[1:38:22] omnipotent because he's omnipresent
[1:38:25] therefore by foreknowledge now he
[1:38:29] can't be just like the wind
[1:38:32] over the earth because he is a being
[1:38:39] he just isn't a myth he's a being
[1:38:43] he dwells
[1:38:46] he even dwells in a house he dwells in a
[1:38:50] place
[1:38:51] called heaven and therefore by
[1:38:54] his omni being omnipresent
[1:38:58] omnipotent and knowing all things
[1:39:01] then he's omnipresent because he knows
[1:39:04] all things right now in the message
[1:39:08] who is this about piece of brother brahm
[1:39:10] talks about the architect
[1:39:13] that's going to build something and this
[1:39:16] is where
[1:39:18] it separates and
[1:39:21] what makes god omnipresent
[1:39:24] omnipotent and knowing all things
[1:39:28] he had it in his mind is that right
[1:39:31] i was trying to find a big blackboard so
[1:39:34] i could doodle
[1:39:35] but i spell words wrong
[1:39:38] and then that's all i hear about for the
[1:39:40] rest of my life
[1:39:42] my kids grew up believing it was the
[1:39:44] holy spirit
[1:39:46] because i'd always put an e at the end i
[1:39:48] don't know why
[1:39:49] that's just the way i did it well
[1:39:52] so god is he's
[1:39:56] everywhere right i mean he's all that
[1:39:59] there is that's the best way i can
[1:40:02] explain it
[1:40:04] now he's got a plan and he's going to
[1:40:07] make heavens and earth
[1:40:10] so everything that's going to come forth
[1:40:13] he's going to make
[1:40:15] heavens and earth so that's what he's
[1:40:17] going to plan to do he's going to plan
[1:40:19] he's going to make heaven and earth
[1:40:20] he's got it all pre-planned he knows
[1:40:23] exactly
[1:40:24] uh what he's fixing to do and
[1:40:28] and so he's he's ready to move on
[1:40:32] so he said and so that's the the the way
[1:40:36] it is
[1:40:37] uh with the lord he says
[1:40:41] so god dwelt alone
[1:40:44] is that right it was just him he dwelt
[1:40:47] alone
[1:40:48] with his attributes so there's there was
[1:40:50] nothing there
[1:40:51] but him uh by himself
[1:40:54] so he says now in the beginning god
[1:40:57] dwelt alone that's paragraph four to
[1:40:59] four forty six of who of this
[1:41:01] melchizedek
[1:41:03] with his attributes as i spoke of this
[1:41:06] morning
[1:41:07] that's his thoughts there was nothing
[1:41:10] just
[1:41:10] god alone but he had thoughts
[1:41:14] so there's just god alone now
[1:41:17] he had thoughts
[1:41:20] okay and we know what some of those
[1:41:24] thoughts were because there's a heaven
[1:41:28] and there's the earth and the scripture
[1:41:30] tells us the invisible
[1:41:32] things of god were clearly seeing in the
[1:41:34] visible things around us
[1:41:36] the invisible things of god were his
[1:41:38] thoughts
[1:41:39] but they were just thoughts until they
[1:41:42] were expressed
[1:41:43] that like you can be mad at somebody
[1:41:49] but then if you can't keep it under
[1:41:51] control you're going to express
[1:41:54] what's on your mind you are the sorriest
[1:41:57] human being i've ever met in my life
[1:42:00] it would have been better off if you
[1:42:01] were never born
[1:42:03] i hope i don't ever see you again and
[1:42:06] you blow the steam off you let it now i
[1:42:09] know what you're thinking
[1:42:13] one minute ago i thought you liked me
[1:42:18] but now you've expressed your thoughts
[1:42:21] well it's like an architect right
[1:42:24] like a great architect he's got a
[1:42:26] thought now he's going to manifest that
[1:42:29] thought
[1:42:32] but an architect can't create
[1:42:35] so if god is going to manifest his
[1:42:39] thoughts
[1:42:41] he can only think
[1:42:44] what he is
[1:42:48] because he doesn't have anything on the
[1:42:51] outside to influence his thoughts
[1:42:53] he doesn't have any place else to gather
[1:42:55] information to gather
[1:42:57] things he doesn't have a light bulb come
[1:43:00] off
[1:43:00] doing or he doesn't see something many
[1:43:04] inventors or have seen something and all
[1:43:06] of a sudden they see something they
[1:43:08] think oh
[1:43:08] this would do that and they go develop
[1:43:12] that and and so somebody that's handy
[1:43:15] with their hands or understands
[1:43:17] machinery
[1:43:18] can understand how they do things and
[1:43:21] and
[1:43:21] and i like to watch machines how they
[1:43:23] make things and
[1:43:25] so but god he's not going to cr he's not
[1:43:28] going to use
[1:43:29] nothing he's absolutely the creator
[1:43:35] so every part
[1:43:39] down to the littlest molecule
[1:43:42] he's going to make and he's going to
[1:43:46] create
[1:43:47] and it's going to come from him
[1:43:49] therefore
[1:43:51] he knows all of it
[1:43:55] he knows what's it going to do
[1:43:58] when it's going to do it because it all
[1:44:02] came from him if you if you
[1:44:05] look in the gospel of of of saint john
[1:44:10] in the first uh
[1:44:15] the third verse of the first chapter of
[1:44:18] the gospel of saint john
[1:44:21] the first the first three verses in the
[1:44:23] beginning was the word
[1:44:25] the word was with god the word was god
[1:44:28] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:44:30] all things were made by him and
[1:44:33] without him was not
[1:44:37] anything made that was made
[1:44:40] so everything that was made was made by
[1:44:43] him
[1:44:44] and it without him in other words he
[1:44:47] made it all himself
[1:44:49] he made every screw every nut every bolt
[1:44:53] every spring all the laws
[1:44:57] that govern it okay so
[1:45:01] if he had it all in his mind
[1:45:04] you understand and now he creates it
[1:45:09] and he creates the time it's going to be
[1:45:11] there
[1:45:12] he already foreknows it
[1:45:21] before it's ever there he can't learn
[1:45:24] about it
[1:45:27] he made everything so
[1:45:30] really everything came
[1:45:33] from him the molecules the atoms
[1:45:38] not the perversion man's went out and
[1:45:41] mixed things and perverted things and
[1:45:43] changed things and done everything
[1:45:45] but the original plan of god god knew
[1:45:47] they would do that it's all part of his
[1:45:49] plan
[1:45:50] but everything came from him so he
[1:45:53] is already in it
[1:46:00] so he knows it he doesn't know it
[1:46:04] by being there
[1:46:07] he knows it by it being there
[1:46:10] before it was expressed
[1:46:15] that's how well he knows it
[1:46:19] remember the little man with the
[1:46:20] carburetor the guy just couldn't get it
[1:46:23] right the guy
[1:46:23] steps up in his suit walks over he says
[1:46:26] do you mind if i try the guy looks up at
[1:46:28] this guy goes
[1:46:32] why don't you go back in the waiting
[1:46:34] room where you belong
[1:46:36] the guy was so frustrated he said sure
[1:46:39] the guy took a screwdriver
[1:46:43] went in there and made a couple of
[1:46:45] little adjustments said try it now
[1:46:47] room room room the thing ran perfectly
[1:46:50] the guy said what did you do how did you
[1:46:52] do that
[1:46:52] he says well i'm the chief engineer at
[1:46:54] general motors
[1:46:56] i made this carburetor
[1:47:03] well he didn't make the gaskets right
[1:47:06] but god made the gaskets he made the
[1:47:09] screws he made the screw holes
[1:47:11] he made the amount of may he made
[1:47:13] everything he was
[1:47:14] he absolutely already knew everything
[1:47:17] there was
[1:47:18] ever to know about it so
[1:47:21] therefore he is
[1:47:26] omnipresent
[1:47:29] by what for knowledge
[1:47:32] or by creation
[1:47:36] but god has a place he dwells
[1:47:40] he dwells in heaven now brother brahm
[1:47:42] uses the word
[1:47:43] house for us to get an idea
[1:47:47] that he's a being he's not a wind he's
[1:47:51] not a myth he's a bean
[1:47:56] and he was a being without form
[1:48:00] but he took on a form
[1:48:06] he formed himself towards flesh he took
[1:48:08] on the form
[1:48:10] and and and he became
[1:48:14] he became the word
[1:48:19] and and so he took on that form now
[1:48:23] when you say that the fullness
[1:48:29] of the godhead bodily
[1:48:33] dwelt and brother branham
[1:48:37] there's two things happening
[1:48:40] one the person that says that is not far
[1:48:43] from the truth
[1:48:45] they're using that terminology to
[1:48:48] express
[1:48:51] that that was deity that dwelt in
[1:48:53] brother branham
[1:48:56] in other words it wasn't brother branham
[1:48:57] that was doing the works
[1:48:59] it was the promise that god made to
[1:49:02] fulfill
[1:49:03] in him so god was only doing
[1:49:07] in prophet of god what he had already
[1:49:10] promised
[1:49:11] he would do in the prophet of god
[1:49:16] jesus ministry wasn't even
[1:49:20] fulfilled when he was here on earth
[1:49:24] there was a part of it left he came back
[1:49:26] and he says
[1:49:27] this they read the scripture he said
[1:49:29] this day this scripture to bind up the
[1:49:31] brokenhearted
[1:49:32] there was another part of his ministry
[1:49:34] to bring judgment
[1:49:35] which is happening in this day
[1:49:39] and so when they express that they're
[1:49:42] saying
[1:49:43] that was deity that was god in there
[1:49:47] that was all god
[1:49:50] yes sir but
[1:49:54] what happens is they take a terminology
[1:50:00] to express it that because of our
[1:50:03] vocabulary
[1:50:04] and the way we've been taught
[1:50:08] it it can't be comprehended as that
[1:50:12] because what you're saying
[1:50:16] to those that have that question when
[1:50:18] you use
[1:50:19] that expression you're saying that god
[1:50:23] changed residence
[1:50:28] he's not there by foreknowledge
[1:50:33] it's just like if if this was ocean
[1:50:36] water
[1:50:38] it's all ocean water
[1:50:41] it's a measure of ocean water it's not
[1:50:45] all the ocean in this cup
[1:50:48] but everything that that ocean is
[1:50:52] everything that that ocean has in it is
[1:50:55] in this bottle of
[1:50:59] water
[1:51:03] so what was in manifesting in
[1:51:06] brother branham was god it was
[1:51:10] all god it was a hundred percent god
[1:51:13] but it was only what god wanted
[1:51:17] to manifest himself
[1:51:20] for this age
[1:51:23] so all of it was god
[1:51:26] but only a measure of god
[1:51:30] was manifested
[1:51:36] he didn't change places
[1:51:40] so when you say the fullness of the
[1:51:42] godhead bodily dwelt some
[1:51:44] somewhere that means he's not any place
[1:51:47] else
[1:51:48] he's only in this
[1:51:52] vessel now that's not what they're
[1:51:55] trying to express
[1:51:58] but they have a revelation of deity and
[1:52:02] they recognize it wasn't brother branham
[1:52:04] that did those works it was god that did
[1:52:06] the work
[1:52:07] and it was god doing his work
[1:52:10] but you with the minute you say that
[1:52:15] you break the other revelation
[1:52:19] that was revealed in brother branham
[1:52:25] and that's the part that we are going to
[1:52:27] come to
[1:52:30] so was it deity yes was it all god yes
[1:52:35] was everything that god was from
[1:52:38] beginning to end
[1:52:40] did god change his resonance
[1:52:44] notice he no longer lives in a house in
[1:52:46] heaven
[1:52:48] he's left heaven
[1:52:51] and he's come down and now he's
[1:52:55] only in here this is where he dwells
[1:52:58] fullness means all every bit everything
[1:53:02] of god well
[1:53:04] it's all ocean but it's only
[1:53:07] the measure of god now god could have
[1:53:11] he did he created in the prophet of god
[1:53:14] he spoke squirrels into existence
[1:53:16] he stopped storms he did everything in
[1:53:19] this ministry
[1:53:20] that he did when he was here on flesh
[1:53:26] it was all him
[1:53:30] that that the terminology is the problem
[1:53:37] because it there's other revelations
[1:53:39] involved
[1:53:41] okay and when you your desire of your
[1:53:43] heart
[1:53:44] is to express the deity
[1:53:47] that was veiled in flesh in our day
[1:53:52] and to look at that flesh man yeah that
[1:53:55] was william branham from
[1:53:57] from jeffersonville indiana from
[1:54:00] up from new albany area you know that
[1:54:03] that kid that
[1:54:04] ran around here that tim well that's
[1:54:06] what they did with jesus that's just
[1:54:08] jesus of nazareth
[1:54:10] but what god was fulfilling
[1:54:13] was the word that was prophesied
[1:54:16] for this day to be fulfilled
[1:54:20] that would only be seen by divine
[1:54:22] revelation
[1:54:23] that god would open your eyes through
[1:54:26] divine revelation
[1:54:27] you would look at that flesh and you
[1:54:30] would say that's more than william
[1:54:31] branham
[1:54:32] that's none other than the lord jesus
[1:54:34] christ himself
[1:54:36] using that body to do the things that he
[1:54:39] promised he would do
[1:54:44] it was all god fulfilling the word that
[1:54:47] he promised he would do
[1:54:49] in this age but to say
[1:54:52] that god changed his residence
[1:54:57] would mean that all the foreknowledge
[1:55:01] was all there
[1:55:07] and
[1:55:11] if i all i can tell you is
[1:55:17] is it was all god
[1:55:23] but you got to remember that brother
[1:55:25] branham was born in sin
[1:55:28] shaped in iniquity come in the world
[1:55:31] speaking
[1:55:32] lies
[1:55:36] never was a lie in god
[1:55:39] what is one of the descriptions of god
[1:55:43] he can not lie
[1:55:49] end of story
[1:55:52] why was the fullness of the godhead
[1:55:55] bodily
[1:55:55] in jesus
[1:56:01] which among you can accuse me of sin
[1:56:10] there was no sin found in him
[1:56:14] no lies no nothing and this kind of goes
[1:56:18] to our
[1:56:19] our answer of uh
[1:56:22] what what's the difference between
[1:56:25] that well when you you got to know what
[1:56:28] each one of them is
[1:56:29] or what the difference are okay jesus
[1:56:32] was not
[1:56:33] born by sin
[1:56:36] he had a flesh body but he didn't come
[1:56:39] by
[1:56:40] sex he came by the word of god
[1:56:45] and so that's why we don't use
[1:56:49] the terminology the fullness of the
[1:56:52] godhead bodily
[1:56:54] dwelt from brother branham because it
[1:56:56] sends
[1:56:57] a different message
[1:57:02] it and it by saying
[1:57:06] trying to express it that way
[1:57:09] then you lose the other things
[1:57:13] that were being expressed through
[1:57:15] brother branham
[1:57:17] the fact that sinful flesh
[1:57:20] could come to the place that deity could
[1:57:24] dwell in them
[1:57:25] and the same works that i do you can do
[1:57:29] also so you're no longer
[1:57:33] looking at what god fulfilled
[1:57:38] in in the seed coming to maturity
[1:57:41] and the same life coming up being
[1:57:44] manifested in the flesh
[1:57:46] you're saying no that was performed
[1:57:49] not by the plan of god but because
[1:57:52] god came down and dwelt in him fully
[1:57:56] in other words it was no longer
[1:58:00] william branham in any form
[1:58:06] brother branham hunted
[1:58:10] he fished you know a lot of people
[1:58:14] didn't think brother bram should hunt
[1:58:17] but he was a man
[1:58:20] that's not what he was pointing at it
[1:58:22] wasn't pointing at what kind of car he
[1:58:24] drove
[1:58:25] where he lived what kind of house he had
[1:58:27] what kind of
[1:58:28] food he ate he never pointed to himself
[1:58:34] now he might have preferred a four
[1:58:36] that's fine
[1:58:41] you know it's all there's
[1:58:45] all kinds of things that he did
[1:58:49] as a man
[1:58:52] you know i mean he hiked
[1:58:57] you know i mean i i wouldn't get up if
[1:59:00] he call me up say bird dave let's go for
[1:59:02] a 15 mile hike up the side of the
[1:59:05] mountains up here a pure to needle rock
[1:59:09] i would love to go i would start out
[1:59:13] man the guy traveled six miles an hour
[1:59:19] i'd say one thing before we start you
[1:59:21] lay hands on me
[1:59:22] you fill me with supernatural power
[1:59:25] because i can't do that
[1:59:30] and he could see he had
[1:59:33] the eyesight to be able to hunt to see
[1:59:36] i don't have that kind of eyesight
[1:59:40] i'm left-handed in my primary eye eyes
[1:59:44] my
[1:59:44] left eye gotta hold the gun on this one
[1:59:47] try to shoot her i got to hold the hand
[1:59:49] over my eye you know what i mean
[1:59:51] and it's hilarious no he was a man
[1:59:54] natural
[1:59:57] but what was doing that work
[2:00:00] in him was it is not i that does the
[2:00:04] work
[2:00:04] it's the father in me that does the work
[2:00:08] he had a great understanding of the
[2:00:11] deity
[2:00:12] spirit that he was in fellowship with
[2:00:16] that's the same thing jesus had
[2:00:20] read perfect faith he had a great
[2:00:23] understanding of the father
[2:00:25] in him i do nothing until the father
[2:00:29] shows me it's not i that does the work
[2:00:31] it's a father
[2:00:33] he learned that that spirit being
[2:00:36] that was dwelling in him that's the
[2:00:38] spirit
[2:00:39] that knew all things
[2:00:42] that's what made jesus omni
[2:00:46] present and omnipotent because the
[2:00:48] creator
[2:00:49] and maker of all things was his father
[2:00:52] he didn't come by sex
[2:00:54] and he had learned total obedience and
[2:00:57] surrender
[2:00:58] to that spirit
[2:01:05] so what was the difference between
[2:01:09] adam well i think the first thing
[2:01:12] to realize is we got to
[2:01:16] understand what adam was
[2:01:19] adam was a flesh man
[2:01:24] he was created by god
[2:01:28] adam he was a body a flesh man
[2:01:32] that god created he was born
[2:01:36] without sin right he was the first son
[2:01:41] of god
[2:01:43] and it god made him so he
[2:01:46] god could display fellowship
[2:01:50] and and display
[2:01:53] his attributes that that's what
[2:01:58] that adam was
[2:02:02] until the fall there was no sin
[2:02:05] in adam
[2:02:12] there wasn't
[2:02:15] he he was
[2:02:19] he had no sickness
[2:02:24] no pain he had dominion
[2:02:30] over the earth adam was what
[2:02:33] every son and daughter of god would have
[2:02:37] been
[2:02:38] if god didn't take the part of eve
[2:02:41] design her so she would be deceived
[2:02:44] that man would fall that god could
[2:02:46] explain his attributes
[2:02:48] we won't go into that token you first of
[2:02:51] all
[2:02:52] realize what adam was adam was the
[2:02:54] creation
[2:02:55] of of god in a form of a person man
[2:03:00] so that god could have fellowship he was
[2:03:03] flesh
[2:03:06] he took out of that flesh eve
[2:03:09] so we would fall that god could express
[2:03:12] himself
[2:03:14] in sin so adam was created
[2:03:18] without
[2:03:22] any relationship between
[2:03:25] a man or a woman and and he was
[2:03:28] put in the garden and left to have
[2:03:31] complete
[2:03:33] dominion so the first the difference
[2:03:36] between
[2:03:37] adam and melchizedek is melchizedek
[2:03:41] is what created adam
[2:03:47] all things were made by him
[2:03:50] and without him was nothing that was
[2:03:53] made
[2:03:54] made and uh so we're going to close up
[2:03:58] because
[2:03:59] we will never pick this up this evening
[2:04:02] and so adam was
[2:04:06] a man okay and and
[2:04:10] he he as we know he fell
[2:04:14] what's the difference between adam and
[2:04:17] melchizedek
[2:04:18] melchizedek was god
[2:04:22] he was god
[2:04:25] god was just a
[2:04:28] everything he was he dwelt alone and
[2:04:31] then
[2:04:32] with his thoughts and then he formed
[2:04:35] himself
[2:04:36] towards a body a person
[2:04:40] and from that person he
[2:04:44] went uh and created
[2:04:47] heaven and earth by the word of god
[2:04:49] that's why
[2:04:50] he knew all things brother ben expresses
[2:04:54] it
[2:04:55] this way if if i could
[2:04:59] say it now the difference between him
[2:05:02] and you as a
[2:05:05] we're talking about melchizedek here
[2:05:08] correct
[2:05:10] he says so let's just read this he says
[2:05:12] now melchizedek
[2:05:14] is god
[2:05:18] he said notice now his attributes
[2:05:22] okay this is paragraph 55 his attributes
[2:05:25] then the attributes was first god
[2:05:29] the thought the attributes itself
[2:05:32] so in other words god couldn't think
[2:05:36] anything but what he was
[2:05:39] because there was no other source of
[2:05:41] information
[2:05:43] nothing else to influence so what his
[2:05:46] thoughts were were his attributes
[2:05:48] but they weren't expressed yet the
[2:05:50] minute they be
[2:05:51] were expressed they the word god's
[2:05:54] thought the attribute itself
[2:05:55] all in one without being expressed
[2:06:00] first just god alone and when he
[2:06:03] expressed
[2:06:04] secondarily he became then
[2:06:08] the word and then the word
[2:06:11] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:06:15] john first chapter first first notice in
[2:06:17] the beginning
[2:06:18] before the eternal notice in the
[2:06:21] beginning
[2:06:22] was the word and when time began
[2:06:26] it was the word before it was word it
[2:06:28] was
[2:06:29] attribute a thought then it was
[2:06:31] expressed
[2:06:32] in the beginning was the expression
[2:06:36] the word now we're getting
[2:06:39] to where malchizedek is that's this
[2:06:42] mysterious people
[2:06:44] person in the beginning was the word and
[2:06:46] the word was with god
[2:06:48] and the word was god and then the word
[2:06:51] became flesh
[2:06:52] and dwelt amongst us first
[2:06:55] was spirit god supernatural
[2:06:58] all right the great eternal second
[2:07:03] he begin to form himself towards flesh
[2:07:06] in a theophany that is called the word
[2:07:11] a body so that's melchizedek
[2:07:16] okay that's different than adam
[2:07:20] all right this is where adam came from
[2:07:24] watch the progression of god unfolding
[2:07:29] he said the word body this then
[2:07:32] is the state that he was
[2:07:36] in when he met abraham
[2:07:39] now when he meant abraham was called
[2:07:43] malchezadek
[2:07:44] he was in the form of a theophany
[2:07:47] so that that's the state he was in that
[2:07:50] was the
[2:07:51] form he was in when this great
[2:07:54] untouchable
[2:07:55] unseen god that
[2:07:58] he meant abraham he took on the form
[2:08:02] of a body and he meant
[2:08:05] abraham in in that
[2:08:09] state was the state that he meant
[2:08:12] uh abraham
[2:08:15] in that was the state he he was in
[2:08:19] when he meant abraham so if you turned
[2:08:22] over to
[2:08:23] a paragraph uh
[2:08:28] let me see
[2:08:35] do 64-65 have it there paragraph 64.
[2:08:43] there we go now god
[2:08:46] in this stage
[2:08:49] in this stage of his creation
[2:08:53] later formed in the flesh jesus from
[2:08:56] what
[2:08:57] from the great eternal spirit
[2:09:01] then came down to be word
[2:09:04] bringing itself out the word doesn't
[2:09:08] yet make itself it's just
[2:09:12] spoken out immorphy later
[2:09:16] he becomes flesh jesus mortal
[2:09:19] to taste death for all of us sinners
[2:09:23] when he meant abraham as melchizedek
[2:09:26] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[2:09:29] will do in the final end every son of
[2:09:31] god of
[2:09:31] abraham every son
[2:09:35] of the faith will absolutely do the same
[2:09:37] thing now
[2:09:38] but watch how we had to come now
[2:09:41] we see the attributes sons of the spirit
[2:09:45] have not yet
[2:09:46] entered into the word form body
[2:09:50] but a theophany is a body
[2:09:53] is subject to the words earnest and we
[2:09:56] went through all that
[2:09:58] the changing now listen here he says
[2:10:01] what's the difference between him and
[2:10:03] you as a son
[2:10:05] he was at the the beginning
[2:10:08] the word amorphy morphy
[2:10:11] means changing states he came
[2:10:15] and lived in that person
[2:10:18] of melchizedek then later
[2:10:21] he never heard no more of melchizedek
[2:10:25] because he became
[2:10:28] jesus christ
[2:10:37] he was a priest and and
[2:10:40] but he became jesus now you bypass
[2:10:43] that because in that form he knows all
[2:10:47] things and you have never been able to
[2:10:50] know that yet
[2:10:52] that's why when he took on the form of
[2:10:54] jesus the fullness
[2:10:56] of the godhead bodily dwelt in jesus
[2:10:58] because the spirit that was in him
[2:11:01] was without measure
[2:11:06] that's distinctly laid out in the
[2:11:08] scriptures
[2:11:09] but you come like adam like me
[2:11:12] you become from attribute to flesh to be
[2:11:15] tempted
[2:11:17] but when his life is finished here it is
[2:11:20] earthly tabernacle is dissolved
[2:11:22] we have one already waiting that's where
[2:11:25] we
[2:11:25] go that is the word
[2:11:28] then we can look back and see what we've
[2:11:31] done
[2:11:32] now we don't understand it
[2:11:36] we have never become word
[2:11:39] we just become flesh
[2:11:42] man hey that's what adam was
[2:11:47] he was a flesh man that's what we are
[2:11:50] that's what jesus was he was a flesh man
[2:11:53] but he was a man without sin amen
[2:12:01] and and so he goes on he says
[2:12:04] in this paragraph 71 but you bypassed
[2:12:08] the theophany and became
[2:12:10] flesh man to be tempted by sin
[2:12:13] then if this earthly tabernacle be
[2:12:15] dissolved we already have wanting
[2:12:17] we have not yet the bodies
[2:12:21] and that i wanted to see if i can
[2:12:24] find this
[2:12:27] just give me a second here
[2:12:34] so
[2:12:40] and and so we recognize that the the
[2:12:43] difference
[2:12:43] what melchizedek was he was god
[2:12:46] in a state and a form
[2:12:51] that he could fellowship abraham so the
[2:12:54] question
[2:12:55] was here it says when when
[2:12:59] when abraham meant
[2:13:03] melchizedek was in his theophany and
[2:13:06] fellowsh with him
[2:13:08] did he have his five natural
[2:13:11] senses well we know he ate
[2:13:17] we know he talked we know he listened to
[2:13:21] abraham
[2:13:23] green oak sarah said now
[2:13:26] he didn't need those senses
[2:13:33] but he took on the form of that
[2:13:36] because by doing that he was revealing
[2:13:39] to all of us
[2:13:41] what we would be so
[2:13:44] in other words and when jesus
[2:13:47] was here jesus had those five senses
[2:13:52] right he had those five senses but he
[2:13:55] was not in a glorified body
[2:13:58] he was in his sinful body is that
[2:14:02] what he said in other words he could die
[2:14:06] he could
[2:14:10] he could taste death he could do all
[2:14:12] those things
[2:14:13] that melchizedek couldn't
[2:14:17] so the difference between jesus and
[2:14:19] melchizedek is
[2:14:21] as melchizedek was god
[2:14:25] just in a form that he could
[2:14:28] fellowship and communicate with abraham
[2:14:32] so he took on a form so and by taking on
[2:14:35] that form
[2:14:36] abraham could know what all his seed
[2:14:39] faith
[2:14:40] would become so did he have his five
[2:14:42] senses yes he had five senses
[2:14:45] did he need them probably not
[2:14:49] because he was the creator of the taste
[2:14:56] he was the creator of the smell he knew
[2:14:59] all things and dwelt everywhere
[2:15:02] by for knowledge but he gave those
[2:15:05] senses
[2:15:06] as a means of communication and that's
[2:15:09] later what james said
[2:15:10] we touched them we felt them we handle
[2:15:13] them with our hands
[2:15:14] the lord of glory who could be touched
[2:15:18] by our infirmities
[2:15:21] so the only thing that i could pre
[2:15:24] pre zoom to that would be
[2:15:28] uh uh was yes because on
[2:15:31] paragraph 58 he says ethernet
[2:15:35] a theophany is
[2:15:38] uh look we'll go to paragraph 55.
[2:15:43] notice now his attributes then his
[2:15:46] attributes was first
[2:15:47] god's thought the attribute itself
[2:15:50] without being expressed
[2:15:52] secondary then it became the word
[2:15:55] and then the word was made flesh and
[2:15:58] dwelt
[2:15:58] among us he and he says down here in 50
[2:16:03] now ethanol theophany
[2:16:06] is something that you could not see
[2:16:09] it could be right here now yet you can't
[2:16:12] see it
[2:16:14] just like well like television it's
[2:16:17] in another dimension
[2:16:22] people are moving through this room
[2:16:24] right now
[2:16:26] singing there's color also but the
[2:16:30] eye is only subject to the five
[2:16:33] senses your whole being is only subject
[2:16:37] to five senses rather
[2:16:38] and you are only subject to what the
[2:16:41] site
[2:16:42] has limited to see but there is another
[2:16:46] dimension
[2:16:47] that can be seen by the transformation
[2:16:51] of television and and so
[2:16:56] we recognize um
[2:17:00] right there that this theophany was in
[2:17:03] another dimension
[2:17:05] so we're trying to take this dimension
[2:17:09] and express something supernatural
[2:17:13] in the understanding of this dimension
[2:17:16] but there's another dimension that that
[2:17:19] theophany lived in
[2:17:21] samuel moses and elijah
[2:17:25] all appeared in their theophany bodies
[2:17:28] they could appear and disappear they
[2:17:31] weren't
[2:17:32] subject to this flesh body adam
[2:17:36] was a flesh man
[2:17:40] jesus was a flesh man but
[2:17:44] he wasn't subject
[2:17:49] to the limitations of this dimension
[2:17:56] was a flesh man but he wasn't subject
[2:17:59] to the limitations of this dimension he
[2:18:02] created
[2:18:02] fish he walked on water he
[2:18:06] he moved like you know
[2:18:11] he walked through the crowd when
[2:18:12] scripture says i don't have the exact
[2:18:15] description
[2:18:16] but it was like he walked out into their
[2:18:18] midst and they didn't even
[2:18:20] know he was there he was a flesh man
[2:18:23] but he wasn't subject to this dimension
[2:18:28] adam was given dominion
[2:18:31] but he forfeited that dominion when he
[2:18:34] became sin
[2:18:36] so when jesus came to die he came to die
[2:18:40] to bring us back to what adam
[2:18:44] had forfeited
[2:18:47] so did when he appeared to have
[2:18:50] fellowship with adrian
[2:18:51] that he had his five senses yes he had
[2:18:54] his five senses
[2:18:55] but they were for abraham's sake
[2:18:58] not that he needed them question was
[2:19:02] jesus glorified body the same as malkie
[2:19:05] adax
[2:19:09] it had a lot of the attributes of
[2:19:11] malkiesidek
[2:19:13] but it wasn't exactly
[2:19:18] uh we could say
[2:19:24] like uh
[2:19:28] malcasidax because
[2:19:32] really it was more like adams
[2:19:38] because jesus had a fleshly body
[2:19:42] right it was tempted
[2:19:46] remember uh
[2:19:50] let's read paragraph 95
[2:19:54] and then we'll make the separation
[2:19:56] between malpisodic and adam
[2:20:02] now the true revelation of malchezadec
[2:20:05] comes into view what
[2:20:06] he was god the word
[2:20:09] before he became flesh
[2:20:13] he was god the word before he
[2:20:17] became flesh all right
[2:20:20] let's jump up to paragraph
[2:20:27] 90 well right in the middle of 92.
[2:20:31] he says see he had become the word
[2:20:35] and was part of the word and he entered
[2:20:39] from the flesh life
[2:20:40] back into the body that was prepared
[2:20:43] before him
[2:20:45] before the foundations of
[2:20:48] the world he entered into theophany
[2:20:51] which was the word you get it there's
[2:20:54] where all believers go when they turn
[2:20:58] from here in this is 93
[2:21:03] then in that form the veil
[2:21:06] then is lifted you see you
[2:21:10] are the word also when you enter
[2:21:13] into there you just got to read the
[2:21:17] whole sentence
[2:21:18] so when we leave this flesh we go into
[2:21:20] that theophany body
[2:21:22] where that's where god had the original
[2:21:24] thought of us and then we see where the
[2:21:26] word
[2:21:27] and a whole bunch of stuff will make
[2:21:29] sense
[2:21:31] okay now the true revelation of malchez
[2:21:35] comes into view
[2:21:37] what was he was god the word before he
[2:21:40] became flesh
[2:21:42] god the word because he had to be
[2:21:45] no one else could be immortal like him
[2:21:48] see
[2:21:49] i had father and mother
[2:21:53] you did too jesus had father
[2:21:57] and mother not mother the way we know it
[2:22:01] but jesus came by the same birth that we
[2:22:04] came by he was born in the world just
[2:22:08] like we were born in
[2:22:09] but god didn't use the egg of mary
[2:22:13] he he created both egg and seed
[2:22:16] in mary he was the father
[2:22:20] of of it all mary is not the mother of
[2:22:22] god
[2:22:25] see he had father and mother you did too
[2:22:29] jesus had father and mother but this man
[2:22:32] had no father
[2:22:34] or had no mother jesus had a time he
[2:22:37] started
[2:22:39] this man didn't jesus gave his life
[2:22:44] this man couldn't because he was
[2:22:47] life and it's the same man
[2:22:50] all the time i hope god reveals it to
[2:22:53] the same
[2:22:54] person all the time so the difference
[2:22:56] between malkie zadak
[2:22:58] adam and jesus was melchizedek
[2:23:02] was god he was the word he was a creator
[2:23:06] of heaven and earth
[2:23:09] now when jesus
[2:23:13] died
[2:23:17] and he was rose again the question
[2:23:20] is was his glorified body let like
[2:23:23] melchizedek
[2:23:25] well jesus was tempted i'm going to
[2:23:27] close with this
[2:23:28] this way later and i want to go jesus
[2:23:31] was tempted
[2:23:32] in every way that we were tempted
[2:23:34] melchizedek couldn't be
[2:23:39] jesus got sick
[2:23:43] he was a man
[2:23:46] he got tired he was a man
[2:23:50] but there was no sin in him
[2:23:53] he was the second adam a a quickening
[2:23:57] spirit
[2:23:58] so when and the question is
[2:24:01] is is about did he get the glorified
[2:24:04] body
[2:24:05] that that when god appeared that
[2:24:09] melchizedek is jesus glorified
[2:24:11] body like malchezadak's body
[2:24:14] melchizedek's body
[2:24:15] would come and disappear it would go
[2:24:20] okay jesus raised the same body
[2:24:25] that he died in
[2:24:28] now this is the difference if jesus was
[2:24:31] going to be
[2:24:31] adam's kinsmen redeemer he had to come
[2:24:35] in the same body that adam came in
[2:24:39] in order to redeem it
[2:24:43] back redeem means to be brought back
[2:24:46] so he's going to bring mankind
[2:24:49] this flesh body back to
[2:24:53] what it was when it was in the state
[2:24:56] of adam now let's look at adam before
[2:24:59] sin
[2:25:01] that body that adam had was glorified
[2:25:07] no sickness
[2:25:10] can you imagine
[2:25:14] no pain no
[2:25:17] suffering no emotional hurt
[2:25:22] dominion over everything
[2:25:28] glory i mean you can't even imagine the
[2:25:31] love adam must have had for eve
[2:25:36] he must have been like abraham and he
[2:25:39] said
[2:25:40] i'm gonna kill my son but he'll raise me
[2:25:43] up
[2:25:45] he must have known in his spirit because
[2:25:48] he came from god
[2:25:49] he had god's personality he had gods
[2:25:52] after him but he must have known if i go
[2:25:54] out with her
[2:25:55] god will have to bring it back and
[2:25:58] that's what he did i promise to put
[2:26:00] enmity between thy seed and the woman's
[2:26:03] seat
[2:26:04] so if you can imagine jesus said i have
[2:26:07] not yet been glorified
[2:26:09] he said don't touch me i haven't left or
[2:26:11] had i haven't entered back into that
[2:26:13] state
[2:26:15] where there's no sin no pain no
[2:26:17] temptation
[2:26:18] no suffering no death
[2:26:23] that's this body
[2:26:26] glorified so we go up and we have a body
[2:26:30] waiting for us
[2:26:31] that's our theophany body but then god
[2:26:34] is going to take that body
[2:26:36] and we're going to pick up a glorified
[2:26:39] body
[2:26:41] a body that's got flesh form
[2:26:45] that we can communicate and talk and
[2:26:48] taste and see
[2:26:49] and have fellowship and everything there
[2:26:52] it won't be it won't be anything sexual
[2:26:56] whatsoever there won't be a difference
[2:26:58] between
[2:26:59] man and woman and others neither bond or
[2:27:02] free male nor jew or greek
[2:27:04] in christ but we are all christ we're
[2:27:06] all there
[2:27:07] in person fleshly person
[2:27:11] just like what abraham was seeing what
[2:27:13] melchizedek was
[2:27:16] in a glorified state
[2:27:20] so the the body that
[2:27:23] melchizedek had was emorphae
[2:27:27] it changed it moved from
[2:27:30] melchizedek to jesus
[2:27:34] and then from jesus it it
[2:27:38] it moved in the form of the spirit
[2:27:41] and then we saw him show up again in
[2:27:44] this
[2:27:44] generation veiled in the ministry
[2:27:48] of the prophet of god so is it the
[2:27:51] glorified body of jesus the same as
[2:27:53] malchester
[2:27:54] it's the same in type
[2:27:58] it'll possess the same attributes
[2:28:03] but it'll be the glorified body will be
[2:28:06] a body like this fleshly body
[2:28:10] so it's really
[2:28:14] the promise was in the lord jesus
[2:28:18] they're so blended together
[2:28:20] that it's it's hard to separate them but
[2:28:23] it's not the same as
[2:28:25] mel keys of that but it is
[2:28:28] the same as what malchizedek represented
[2:28:32] and i i know that answer might not be
[2:28:35] good and
[2:28:36] uh enough but i hope that there will be
[2:28:39] some
[2:28:40] form of a trust in it so
[2:28:43] we see that the difference between adam
[2:28:47] was adam was the son of god placed
[2:28:50] here on earth in a glorified body
[2:28:54] with his own spirit jesus was a man
[2:28:58] that the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:29:00] dwelt in
[2:29:01] to redeem us brother branham was a
[2:29:04] redeemed
[2:29:06] man
[2:29:09] tempted the way that we're tempted
[2:29:13] that god could dwell
[2:29:17] in and measure
[2:29:20] and manifest the word of god but what
[2:29:23] brother branham
[2:29:24] represents is the first fruit
[2:29:29] of what every true believer will come to
[2:29:32] to be able to take the rapture
[2:29:36] and and so we can touch on on
[2:29:39] a few more of these things and and
[2:29:42] maybe i'll just find and get a couple
[2:29:46] quotes this evening if you have any more
[2:29:48] questions but so
[2:29:50] the each one of those differences and
[2:29:53] why god did it that way
[2:29:55] is he's trying to manifest something in
[2:29:57] each one of them
[2:29:59] what he wanted to manifest in
[2:30:01] melchizedek melchizedek was just the
[2:30:03] beginning
[2:30:04] of it all then he wanted to manifest in
[2:30:06] jesus christ
[2:30:08] his love for us his deity
[2:30:11] joining with flesh what he wanted to
[2:30:14] manifest in the prophet of god
[2:30:16] is he has not forgot us he will restore
[2:30:19] us
[2:30:20] and he will bring us back and believe me
[2:30:24] that gospel
[2:30:25] has been lost in the church world today
[2:30:31] they asked a great evangelist today
[2:30:33] what's his secret to success
[2:30:36] why does he have thousands and thousands
[2:30:38] of people
[2:30:41] coming to his meetings he said because i
[2:30:44] don't preach against sin
[2:30:51] that's the next best thing to the
[2:30:53] catholic church
[2:30:55] catholic church is great you could sin
[2:30:58] as long as you showed up a confession
[2:31:00] and told the priest all your sins you
[2:31:02] can do almost
[2:31:03] anything for a few hail marys and a few
[2:31:05] glory bees
[2:31:08] but it didn't have eternal life so
[2:31:11] anyway lord bless you this morning
[2:31:15] we'll go through these i i know when we
[2:31:18] start talking
[2:31:19] i i know parts of the congregation are
[2:31:21] getting left behind and
[2:31:23] that really is hard on me
[2:31:26] you know because i think a lot of people
[2:31:28] can fend for themselves
[2:31:31] you know what i mean and and part of our
[2:31:34] job is to feed the lambs
[2:31:36] but those are the great
[2:31:40] things is why the fullness of the
[2:31:42] godhead didn't
[2:31:43] bodily dwell in brother branham because
[2:31:45] god didn't change his residence
[2:31:47] that's right you know uh was it
[2:31:50] did he have his five senses yes
[2:31:54] he came in a body like the body we're
[2:31:56] going to have
[2:31:57] the difference is those five senses
[2:32:00] won't have a carnal spirit
[2:32:03] to contact so those senses will never be
[2:32:07] temptation
[2:32:09] never be the lust of the eye never be
[2:32:11] the pride of life
[2:32:13] never lead to guttingly or heartburn or
[2:32:16] anything like that
[2:32:21] you know what i mean yeah we experienced
[2:32:24] that the other day didn't we
[2:32:28] yeah i couldn't eat another ounce
[2:32:32] and my precious brother just kept
[2:32:35] bringing me food that
[2:32:36] you couldn't resist so we won't have
[2:32:40] those type of senses there there'll be a
[2:32:43] different
[2:32:43] spirit connected with those five senses
[2:32:47] so every time you think of these five
[2:32:49] senses you think of them in this
[2:32:51] dimension
[2:32:52] those bodies are in another dimension
[2:32:55] so there won't be any temptation believe
[2:32:58] me
[2:32:58] you are not going to look in the mirror
[2:33:01] and think that you are too heavy
[2:33:03] that's right
[2:33:06] forget that or too skinny
[2:33:10] or bald
[2:33:14] i'm not bald my maker knows where every
[2:33:19] single one of them is
[2:33:21] and he can give him back to me anytime
[2:33:23] he wants
[2:33:26] but that's what we're looking forward to
[2:33:29] and that's why it's so important to live
[2:33:31] for him now
[2:33:32] but lord bless you this morning because
[2:33:34] those were just some of the questions
[2:33:35] that came up
[2:33:37] and uh and i know we kind of
[2:33:40] went through each of these answers but
[2:33:43] just
[2:33:44] to sum it up each manifestation that god
[2:33:48] had
[2:33:48] melchizedek abraham jesus and brother
[2:33:51] branham all were
[2:33:52] a significant purpose of god
[2:33:55] condescending
[2:33:57] coming from the word coming to adam
[2:34:01] coming to jesus tempted
[2:34:04] just like we're tempted laying down his
[2:34:06] life taking his life down
[2:34:08] and then coming in the prophet of god
[2:34:11] god condescending
[2:34:12] showing that he's with us all the way
[2:34:14] through and he's going to bring us all
[2:34:16] back
[2:34:17] to where we were in the first place and
[2:34:19] that's back to eden
[2:34:21] amen how many want to go back to eden
[2:34:24] and the only way back to eden is through
[2:34:27] the lord jesus christ
[2:34:29] i am the way the truth the life no man
[2:34:32] comes unto the father
[2:34:33] but by me i go to prepare a place for
[2:34:36] you
[2:34:37] if it were not true i would not have
[2:34:39] told you
[2:34:41] if if i go to prepare a place i will
[2:34:45] come again
[2:34:46] that where i am you may be also
[2:34:49] don't forget that friend no matter
[2:34:53] you know anybody's welcome to come to
[2:34:55] this congregation and serve god
[2:34:58] we have many different preachers we have
[2:35:00] many different types of service
[2:35:02] this was a different type of service
[2:35:04] this morning i'll be the first to admit
[2:35:06] that
[2:35:07] but he's the same and
[2:35:11] in living without him is is
[2:35:14] is i don't know how you do it i couldn't
[2:35:17] do it i wouldn't be alive today
[2:35:19] if it wasn't for the grace and mercy of
[2:35:21] the lord jesus so god bless you happy
[2:35:23] father's day
[2:35:24] and i hope your crop pox didn't burn
[2:35:28] or wherever you go uh but uh the lord
[2:35:32] will be with you so god bless you
